B00000JCB2|1.0|Limp Bizkit is not a good band. Pure and simple. If I have to hear another one of Fred Durst's songs of craptacular badness then I will have to go up to him personally and kick his (...).    This album lacks creativity, is nothing but computerized garbage, and is starving for attention. What it is good at is sucking and blowing, neither of which I'm a fan for.    If you have half a brain, let alone half a brain cell, it will tell you not to buy this album but rather to steal it and burn it in a ritualistic like fashion. Limp Bizkit deserves to be slapped in the face a million times for this.    I wish that Limp Bizkit would just stop with this silly charade and try to make music for once, maybe it will be good for a change. Either that, or they will probably be even worse, take your pick.

B0007TKNL0|3.0|Well, I do like musicals a lot. I didn't get to see this one on big screen so I rented the DVD instead. I'm giving it 3 stars [well maybe 3 1/2] just because I like the originally story but seriously quite a few things are wrong with this musical film.      Okay, I'm not a music expert but I truly don't get it when a lot of reviewers here said the actors/ actresses voice was great. I have a set of Phantom CDs and even with my uneducated ears, I can tell you that what was sung in the film isn't even close. It's just mediocre.  Also, I once saw Phantom on a London's stage and even though it was years ago I still remember I got goosebumps all through my sitting. For this musical film, not even once I got that kind of feeling. That BAD!    Another thing, what's with the leading actress? She's got a sweet face all right but she can't act and she has ZERO screen presence. I think if the singing is going to just passable like this, it would have been much better to use a famous actress, one whom you can't help but look at in awe and admiration.. at least the whole watching experience would be much more interesting. Both male actors are somewhat tepid too. Hmm..    And on top of that, if you are going to make a bad imitation of a famous musical, why not give it your all like they did with Chicago. Who knows.. the flashy factors might have helped offset the weakness of this musical film.      Well, to sum it up, I'm disappointed. Must be because I expected too much.    PS: I still don't understand how it is possible for anyone who has seen a stage version of Phantom to give this quite bad musical film a five.
B00000K0EA|5.0|I have all the bonds movies on DVD, but every time I see one on tv I catch myself watching them. Yes, some are better than others, but all and all it's still Bond and Tomorrow Never Dies is no expection. I enjoyed it start to finish just like every Bond. Pierce Brosnan's at the top of his game and I hope to see him in a few more movies, but who ever they pick to be the next Bond I'm sure will be good. I would give this movie ten stars if I could!
B00005JLEU|5.0|Outside of Family Guy and South Park, I'm not exactly hot on animation. My favourite films are usually adult in content, be it the philosophical ramblings of Fight Club, the surreal film noir of Mulholland Drive or the intense yet touching Irreversible. So naturally I was sceptical when my friend asked if I wanted to watch Spirited Away, a Japanese Anime that I assumed was for kids. It looked like something to watch with your girlfriend or something.<br /><br />How wrong I was, because Spirited Away isn't just the best animated film I've ever seen, it has quikcly risen to being one of my favourite feature films ever. Gorgeous animation, drenched with mood swings (from happy to sad to angry to confused) and filled with subtle details, Spirited Away captures the beauty of love, the frustration of being misunderstood, how frightening it is to be thrown into a new situation, the greed of humankind as well as showing how a little human kindness goes a long, long way.<br /><br />Spirited Away follows Shihiro (aka Sen) as her family unwittingly wander into a spirit world and treat it with utmost disrespect. Her parents are held captive by the head honcho Yubabba while Sen must learn the ways of the spirit world in order to win them back and return the real world. I won't give anything awy, but she starts of a frightened and pathetic little girl and finishes a strong, intuitive young woman.<br /><br />This isn't a kids films with enough charm to win over the rest of us, its a genuinely wondorful piece of work with messages that apply to everyone. Leave reality at the door and get lost in this fascinating world of the spirits.
B0007TKNKG|5.0|I've been a big Stallone fan since \\"The Lords Of Flatbush\\"He is a definite icon to be admired and ranks highly with Hollywood stars past and present.This film is one of my big favorites.A Stallone classic.Keep more like it coming.May Sly's star never fade.
0887306667|4.0|\\"The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing\\" is a short, consice book about the \\"laws of marketing\\".  Ries and Trout explain the 22 laws that a company needs to obey in it's marketing strategy, along with multiple examples illistrating the laws.<br /><br />Some of the laws seem to go against common current wisdom, for exmaple the \\"Law of Line Extension\\".  If most companies have a great brand, they tend to but their brand on as many products as possible.  However this book explains why it isn't a great strategy.<br /><br />I liked the short and to-the-point nature of the book.  It is well written and easy to read.  My only beef with the book was that it's a little outdated and I found myself wanting more explaination of more current companies.  Plus with the examples, you always have to keep in mind that this was back in 1991 and not now, which makes it a little annoying.<br /><br />However the advice in the book is solid.  A good book for anyone in marketing.  4 out of 5 stars.
B000089CJI|1.0|This is the worst excuse for music I have ever heard. Since when does playing tunes on a Casio Keyboard qualify anyone to think they have what it takes to become a musical artist? I am  baffled by the fact that there is someone out there willing to produce such garbage. I would rather listen to a bunch of starving, whining alley cats than be tortured by The Postal Service. Don't waste your money.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This is the best album I own. Shadows, the singer, has one of the best voices in rock. Zacky and Synyster lay mind-numbing guitar licks. Unfortunatly, the bass is barely heard. Also, The Rev is one of the best drummers I've ever heard. This band is great, you can hear 2 of the songs from their new album City Of Evil, coming out in June, on their site. I reccomend this album to anyone.
B000089CJI|1.0|This music is worse than Kenny G. and Michael Bolton put together. I'm surprised this is actually considered music. This is an embarassment to Postal Services across the world. This is like listening to a CD that has been scratched up by a jackhammer. Theres nothing anybody can do to make this music better. When I hear this music playing it makes me want to throw up in my mouth.
B00003CWNR|4.0|Homer(Tobey Maquire) was an orphan brought up in a remote orphange run by Dr. Larch (Michael Caine). The orphanage was a loving, idyllic and peaceful place, and the orphans all appeared to be happy, well looked after, and got along well with each other. Dr. Larch was a loving, caring, benevolent doctor who had the the best interests of the orphans at heart. However, Dr. Larch also performed illegal abortions, abused ether, and later on even falsified medical credentials for Homer. Homer was an innocent, naive and sensitive young man who was so generous and helpful to anyone that he met both in the orphange and later on in the world outside the orphange. However, he also had an affair with the girlfriend(Charlize Theron)of the soldier(Paul Rudd) who gave him the opportunity to see the world and then went to war, expecting Homer to take care of his girlfriend and her mother. The black foreman (Delroy Lindo) was very nice to his crew of apple pickers, but also loved his daughter \\"so much\\" that he was an incest perpetrator. I think the film tries to make us not to see people as either good or bad.  It delivers the message that it is not only human to make mistakes, but being human (unless your are psychopathic)will also mean that we will suffer,as a result of our guity conscience, from the consequences of making mistakes. It is a great film abut humanity and humaneness.
B0002X314C|4.0|A pretty good cd!! <br /> <br />I can't give this 5 stars because i can't listen to this frequaently because i like rap a lot more then this music.(R&B) But i figured  i like kanye west so i woould like this guy because kanye west signed him. He is pretty good.  <br /> <br />My top 3 favorite tracks are: <br />1}Number One feat. Kanye West <br />2}ordinary People-1st single <br />2}Used To Love You-2nd single  <br /> <br />If you like Kanye West then get this cd!! <br />
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish. The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.  <br /> <br />Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film.  <br />
B000021XR5|4.0|This is the heaviest and most straight forward album the Stone temple pilots have done, and its broken up nicely by more acoustic sounding songs like \\"Sour girl \\" \\"I got you\\" and \\"atlanta\\" <br /> <br />Does'nt really break new ground like their other albums, but is defintiley worth having.
B00000HZHS|5.0|First off, you should buy this version of In Utero instead of the normal, unedited version. Why?  <br /> <br />1. This version is cheaper.  <br /> <br />2. This version is exactly the same (song-wise) as the unedited version, aside from \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" being remixed into a cleaner, overall louder sound (the way Kurt wanted to hear it). <br /> <br />Yes, the outside package says \\"Waif Me\\" instead of \\"Rape Me\\". However... the song itself has not been touched or edited in any way. And in \\"Milk It\\" they did not edit the word s**t at all (but I had to in this review, just for the sake of politcal correctness). So overall, the only way this cd is different from the unedited version is that the \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" Scott Litt remix is included... which is actually better than the one on the unedited version! Plus this version isn't even $10! It's like the best version of In Utero is the least expensive one! <br /> <br />Now, about the cd in general. In Utero is, in my opinion, Nirvana's best cd. I love every song on this disc. The following is a short review of each song on the cd. Note: this cd was produced by Steve Albini, who did a great job. But 3 of the songs were taken to Scott Litt to be remixed, and make them sound cleaner. Two of those songs, \\"Heart-Shaped Box\\" and \\"All Apologies\\", are only available with the Scott Litt remix. On the unedited In Utero, \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" appears in its original Steve Albini form. Granted, that version is good, but Kurt was not happy with it. On this version of In Utero, the Scott Litt \\"Pennyroyal Tea\\" remix is included.  <br /> <br />Serve The Servants- Probably about Kurt's youth. Great opener. <br /> <br />Scentless Apprentice- About the book \\"Perfume\\". Kurt's songwriting at its best. <br /> <br />Heart-Shaped Box- First single off In Utero, might be about Courtney Love (or might not). This was mixed by Scott Litt. <br /> <br />Waif Me- Actually called Rape Me, B-side to the All Apologies single. And beleive it or not, it's an antirape song. <br /> <br />Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle- This song is about actress Frances Farmer. In my opinion, this song was good enough to be a single (but probably too long). <br /> <br />Dumb- A nice, mellow song. For some reason, it gets a lot of radio airplay, even though it was never a single. Good stuff here. <br /> <br />Very Ape- Short song, about jocks and muscle men who think they're smart, but aren't. <br /> <br />Milk It- About fame and dealing with demands from people. B-side to the Heart-Shaped Box single. One of my favorite Nirvana songs. <br /> <br />Pennyroyal Tea- This is about someone who is on the edge of their own self- inflicted death. One of Kurt's favorites, and one of mine, too. This version is the Scott Litt remix. This was going to be their 3rd single, but with Kurt's suicide, it was cancelled. <br /> <br />Radio Friendly Unit Shifter- Originally called 9 Month Media Blackout. About writing and singing songs that are radio friendly. <br /> <br />tourette's- This song is great. All it is is Kurt yelling and screaming stuff. Tourette's syndrom is a disease where you yell out random swear words. <br /> <br />All Apologies- The 2nd single off In Utero. This is such a great song, very peaceful, yet has a sonic edge to it. It was mixed by Scott Litt. <br /> <br />And here I will end my lengthy review. In Utero represents Nirvana in their best, most creative state. I recommend buying either of these versions of In Utero, edited or unedited. They are both almost identical, but for the few differences. I also recommend buying the All Apologies single, as it is available again, and was out of print for several years. Long live Nirvana.
B000002HMH|3.0|To everyone that expected Black Album II, you were in for a rude awakening. Metallica has changed on this album, and it is a far cry from everything else they have done. If a different band recorded this I would think that they did a decent job. The tracks are still heavy, but not nearly as fast as the way I like my metal. The songs also sound somewhat like blues, and have lost some edge. And what happened to the metal ideology? Grow your hair as long as it goes and play the loudest rudest angriest music ever? I must admit that I like this album, but I did something on it I have never done with a Metallica CD. I skipped tracks. I suppose it is selfish of me to want every song to be my favorite, but it felt wrong.  <br /> <br />This had to be expected. When a band puts out so much great music like Led Zeppelin did, you have to expect that at some point they will start to decline.
B0000CD8A8|5.0|Is this reissue remastered in some way...? <br />Anyway, this album is considered by many people to be the best metal album ever recorded, indeed.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Like a spoiled little brat having a temper tantrum in his overstuffed playroom, Roland Emmerich loves to destroy things - only he does so on a scale far beyond the dreams of even the most literal-minded schoolboy.  Cars, buildings, national monuments, whole cities - nothing is too grand or sacrosanct that it can't be reduced to rubble in the filmmaker's quest for the almighty buck.  He began his assault on the planet and audience sensibilities back in 1996 with \\"Independence Day,\\" in which he used aliens from outer space to do his dirty work for him.  Two years later, in \\"Godzilla,\\" he resurrected a campy cultural icon to smash New York City into tiny little pieces for our pleasure and edification.  Now, in \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" Emmerich has gone for the gold by having Mother Nature herself - as the ultimate woman scorned - pushing humanity to the brink of extinction as payment for our sin of casual indifference to the ecologically-sensitive world around us.  This is mass-market filmmaking with a social conscience.<br /><br />\\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is what people generally have in mind when they refer to \\"mindless summertime popcorn entertainment\\" - a big-budget disaster picture with state-of-the-art special effects, minimalist plotting and wafer-thin characterizations.  This current vision of worldwide apocalypse shows what happens when mankind fails to heed the warnings of global warming: storms of unprecedented scope and ferocity are unleashed on major metropolitan areas in the Northern Hemisphere and a new ice age begins.  The Chicken Little of the piece is one Dr. Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), a climatologist who can't get anyone to listen to his dire predictions for the future until it's too late and the sky has literally fallen in.  The \\"plot\\" involves Jack setting off on a suicide mission to rescue his son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal) and some of his classmates who have been entombed in a snow- and ice-bound New York City.<br /><br />As a storyteller, Emmerich pays a price for his pedantry and social crusading, failing to provide the kind of dramatic arc that turned \\"Independence Day\\" into such a rabble-rousing entertainment.  In \\"The Day After Tomorrow,\\" once the destruction of LA and Manhattan have been effectively dramatized - the former by tornadoes and the latter by a tidal wave-cum-blizzard - the film lapses into a mundane narrative pattern, so that the final hour or so consists of little more than people trudging through the snow trying to stay warm.  The film turns out to be almost all build-up with very little pay off.  Nevertheless, some of the imagery is indeed fantastic, especially that of the skyline of New York City literally frozen under a coating of ice and snow.  The characters barely register as people and we really don`t care what happens to any of them, but there's still an irresistible pull to much of the film, particularly in the first half, mainly because it shows us how very vulnerable we are to the great natural forces that rule our planet.  The movie makes us feel as if we are mere guests in this world, being allowed to exist here only by the grace and whim of a power that - either through malice or fatal indifference - could wipe us out in no time flat.<br /><br />\\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" is the movie equivalent of a 50-car pileup.  You know there's nothing particularly edifying to be gained by watching it, but you can't help looking at it anyway.  You can con yourself into believing that you're studying it as a warning against unsafe driving when, deep down inside, you know that what is really holding your attention is all that destruction and carnage.  So it is with this movie.  The salutary environmental message is really only the pretext for watching the human race get a first-class ass-whippin`.<br /><br />My only question is what can Emmerich possibly do for an encore?merich pays a price for his pedantry and social crusading, failing to provide the kind of dramatic arc that turned \\"Independence Day\\" into such a rabble-rousing entertainment.

0451528956|4.0|This book was very suspenseful and interesting. At first I was alittle leary about the book and didn't think it would have much to offer to any student.But when i read it, it became apparent that it wasn't just about the addiction to opium but it was also gave moral and social values and was a very thrilling mystery. The characters kept you going throughout the book while trying to solve the so called \\"mystery\\". It was a book that you just didnt want to put down. I would reccomend this book to any high school senior english class.
B00005JLXE|3.0|Daredevil is a pretty good action flick, but nothing makes it stand out as a time-enduring classic.<br /><br />The Good: Nice action, realistic (somewhat) hero, decent plotline, good characters, comic-book feel<br /><br />The Bad: Weak dialogue, Ben Affleck (though his face is covered most of the time), standard super hero story<br /><br />Overall, not a waste of time, but not anything to go out of your way for.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|Finding Neverland is an emotional movie that will leave you crying.  It's a sweet movie, that have some excellent performances, especially from the children.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This is a killer movie. It is the first really fresh farce I've seen since the \\"Airplane\\"/\\"Naked Gun\\" continuum of cookie cutter comedies started to run in the early 1980's. The movie is well photographed, smart, clever and funny. The humor is a little goofy (imagine if your high school class clown were allowed the budget and resources to make a serious movie), but it is satisfying.    There are many current movies that had bigger budgets and can only wish they were as well made and well scripted as \\"Shawn of the Dead.\\"    The filmmaker is well versed in traditional zombie movie/\\"Night of the Living Dead\\" cinematic mythology, and you'll see a lot of familiar horror movie symbols skewered.    It pains me to say that this movie probably couldn't be made by Americans today (the cast and writers are relentlessly British) because of Hollywood's fear of original and clever thinking. The tradition of British humor which prides itself on originality of thinking is a key element at work in the success of \\"Shawn of the Dead.\\" Of course Hollywood will try to clone the film, but the product will look like all the rest of the recycled spew churned out by domestic filmmakers.      Take note Anglophobes: there's nothing in this movie except the accents you won't approve of. In fact, there's little in the film that won't make perfect cultural sense. This is the kind of slacker movie that every Twixster living in his mom's basement from Shepherd's Bush to Malibu dreams of making. It's surely the movie they want to watch.    Best of all, since my family purchased the film we've watched it several times. There's always something new to see. This is critical in a film that you will purchase for your own collection.    WARNING: As I said, this is a smart movie! Like all of the best comedy there are some barbed social comments at work here. You've probably thought the film's main theme yourself: in the modern technological world if we aren't careful, we all wind up \\"living dead\\" zombies.If you can't deal with a film that rises well above the profanity and bathroom humor of \\"Scary Movie\\" you won't like \\"Shawn of the Dead,\\" but if you need some real humor that's a step or two above the drivel you put up with at the cinema day in and day out, check out \\"Shawn of the Dead.\\"
B000002N3N|3.0|There's much to enjoy in \\"The Memory of Trees\\": the whimsical yet rich 'Tea House Moon' instrumental with the ethereal whistle synth pioneered by Tomita so many years ago; the moody 'Pax Deorum'; the gorgeous 'Athair ar Neahm' and a moving ode to love in 'Hope has a Place'. 'The Memory of Trees' and 'On My Way Home' nicely bookend this disc although the finishing chorus of the latter goes on a bit long.<br /><br />Left at this point I'd give \\"The Memory of Trees\\" 4 1/2 stars,  but then there's 'Anywhere Is' -- the first verse starts out promisingly, but the second verse and most of the rest descend into word rhyming mush; e.g., \\"...the moon still keeps on moving / the waves still keep on waving / and I still keep on going...\\" I still keep on wishing / that the singing / was not rendered in Englishing...<br /><br />'Once You had Gold' is an equally overreaching word salad... \\"No-one can promise a dream for you, Time gave both darkness and dreams to you\\". Jarring. Similarly, 'China Roses' tries to pack too much imagery into a single song schizophrenically contrasting with the flowing music. Seriously, can you take poetic offerings such as these without critique?<br /><br />Lastly, we have La Sonadora which to my ears is the highlight of Enya's voicings - it is beautifully sung, but the arrangement is very somber -- didn't seem to fit together as well as it might have.<br /><br />As Enya didn't actually write the lyrics, I give the her musical contributions my original 4 and 1/2 stars. And, poetic objections notwithstanding, The Memory of Trees is another very worthy effort from the voice from another plane of existence.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Great album. Its not as dark, and heavy as \\"The Downward Spiral\\" But its a great mix between his first 3 albums. I would say its a bit more mainstream than most of his past efforts, but its consistent, full of energy, and its definitely Nine Inch Nails. <br /> <br />Enjoy
B00003OO3O|5.0|UFO went through many a guitar player in their carear, Mick Bolton, Michael Shenker, The guy after Shenker and then again with Shenker later in their carear. BUt there is no question about it Michael Shenker was the best, and the albums and the music that was made during the time Michael was in the band was unarguabley the best. This, Force It, being the best album the band ever made. Full of blistering solo's and killer guitar riffs by Michael Shenker only to be complamented by Phil's amazing vocals.<br /><br />The album starts out with it's best songs, and my personal favorite(along with Lights Out), 'Let It Roll' is filled with a lightening fast guitar solo, and a killer riff by Shenker. Phils vocals as always are amazing and Ways bass is most prominant in this song then any other UFO track. Next the album goes into the classic rocker 'Shoot Shoot' which contains one of Shenkers all time best guitar riffs. Next is the beautiful acoustic track 'High Flyer' which honestly you have to hear it to truly understand how good it is and to fully appreciate it. 'Love Lost Love' is one of UFO's better songs, with cool lyrics and of course out of this world guitar. This track sounds like classic 70's hard rock(what good music should sound like). 'Out In The Street' is like a ballad but not, with great piano. This track more then any oother really shows off the amazing vocal talent that Phil had in his hayday. Next is the hard and heavy 'Mother Mary' which is truly one of the coolest songs I have ever heard. Shenker plays some of the most fiery leads of his life on Mother Mary, I dont see how anyone could not like this song, it's truly brilliant. 'Too Much Of Nothing' is another distorted rocker that hits you like a ton of bricks in the head. A great set up for the next track Dance Your Life Away.' Dance Your Life Away features one of my favorite guitar riffs of all time, not just by Scenker. It has a cool chorus to boot. 'The Kids (including Between the Walls)' is the absolute best song to finish the album. It's hard and it's heavy and it leaves you wanting more UFO, more Phil, and more MICHAEL SCHANKER!<br /><br />As you can see I am a big UFO fan but I am an even bigger Michael Schenker fan. He is truly on of the all time best guitar players, ever!!! He is with out a doubt the best German music export ever, better then his brother Rudi (The Scorpians) and Uli Jon Roth(The Scorpians and Schenkers replacement). SO if you are a fan of killer guitar pick up this album and any other Schenker album, or if you are a fan of classic hard rock pick up all the UFO albums with Schenker, but ths one first because Force It is the bands all time best!olute best song to finish the album. It's hard and it's heavy and it leaves you wanting more UFO, more Phil, and more MICHAEL SCHANKER! <br /> <br />As you can see I am a big UFO fan but I am an even bigger Michael Schenker fan.

B000001AJG|5.0|Whatever has been said this album is Stevie Wonder's most creative piece of work,consisting primarily of instrumentals that are early precursers to new age music.The peppy \\"Outside My Window\\" and the almost incomprehencable \\"Race Babbling\\" are the best of the uptempo songs featured here.But as for the hit \\"Send One Your Love\\"...I have alot of trouble talking about it even now.Musically speaking it's a beautiful song but the meaning it holds for me personally is very different.<br /><br />  It is a song about different ideas on the concept of love-not reflected in a sappy manner but in enough of a way that effected me when I first heard it-when I myself first fell in love.That love was unrequited to the very extreme and quite hurtful and this song,as the lyrics state so well tends to serve as a reminder that love tends tends to seem unreal.The song and the album take the listener on a journey to a pastoral Garden Of Eden like place and will doubtless have an emmotional effects on you.It did on me.

B00001OH7Y|5.0|If 'Ziggy Stardust' was Bowie's scale for measuring his 70's work then this album does the same for his work up to today.At it's most basic 'Scary Monsters' is David Bowie's hardest rocking album of the decade.Both parts of \\"It's No Game\\",the title cut and \\"Teenage Wildlife\\" all feature Robert Fripp's slashing guitar riffs strung into wild,disonant patterns.So if songs such as \\"Up The Hill Backwards\\",\\"Kingdom Come\\" and \\"Because Your Young\\" all carry on the warped and disonant guitar rock sound,they also carry an equally mutated wall of sound-like production and (yes) very catchy writing.Of course this album will be remembered commercially for two reasons-the tongue in cheek dance-rock of \\"Fasion\\",with it's great rhythmic backup and the jerky \\"Ashes To Ashes\\",the twisted follow up to 'Space Oddity' where Bowie implies 'Major Tom was a junkie'.<br /><br />  So is there a good reason to say that any Bowie album today is and I quaote 'his best since 'Scary Monsters'?Well there is-this album ushered Bowie into the era of the music video (Fasion and Ashes To Ashes both have their own clips-worth searching for) and everything on this album has a particularly timeless quality.Because of his clout Bowie knew he'd succeed no matter what so he committed himself to his own artistic vision rather then to being ultra trendy.In fact as is the case here he went out of his way to mock those trends when he could.By far his most consistant album of this decade.
B00004XOWM|1.0|i usually dont travel to the other side of the musical spectrum to bash bands that i dont even listen too.... but this over here is just getting out of hand! kids are bashing the living sh*t out of da Bizkit.. then suggesting more 'mature' bands like Korn, Slipknot, Lamb of God.... PLEASE!!! cmon guys! if we're going to kill limp bizkit... we have to suggest GOOD music in its place....  lamb of god metal? no... for metal listen to Deicide, Megadeth, Iron Maiden, Morbid Angel... ect ect. and the Pink Floyd ripoff (my way) is absolutely intolerable... fred will definately see time in hell for this. as well as for his butchering of behind blue eyes.. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm a huge Buffy and Angel fan, but I did not hear a thing about this show when Fox aired it.  I certainly didn't buy the DVD for a while after it came out, either.  I heard how good it was, so one day I found myself in a store, holding the DVD, pondering.  I bought it.  I love it.  I love Buffy, Angel and Firefly for different reasons, and my mood ultimately picks which DVD to pop it.  Most of the time, it's Firefly. <br /> <br />The people are real, and they do what they must to survive in a world that isn't always easy to survive in.  The bonds on the ship are that of a family who take care of their own.   <br /> <br />I enjoy a lot of different types of shows.  I love Friends, Veronica Mars rocks my socks, N3mbers is fantasic, and I enjoy the occasional Dawson's Creek(for Pacey).  Ultimately, Whedon and company have my heart and my DVD player.   <br /> <br />I warn you, fall for Firely, and you may fall for Buffy and Angel.  And not just for that handsome devil David Boreanaz.      <br />
B0000CDLA7|1.0|I WISH DT WOULD READ THESE REVIEWS- THEN MAYBE THEIR ALBUMS WOULDNT BE SO BAD ANYMORE- ATTENTION DT- YOU ARE A PROG BAND- STAY TRUE TO YOUR FANS- YOUR FANS ARE WHY YOU EVEN FREAKIN EXIST- PLEASE THEM- NOT YOURSELVES!!!!
B0000019PA|5.0|This is one of the most emotional records I have ever heard, and that is what I love about it. Neutral Milk Hotel are not a very talented band, and if the only kind of music you like is music made by a band where everyone is a master at there instrument then dont even bother buying this album. But if you like songs that are full of emotion and beautiful lyrics then you might consider buying this album. Now im gonna do some track reviews <br /> <br />King of Carrot Flowers Pt 1: A song about teen love and abusing parents. The accordian is a real nice touch 5/5 <br />King of Carrot Flowers Pts 2 and 3: The weirdest song on the album besides untitled. Dont get turned off because of the lyrics about jesus. 5/5 <br />In the Aeroplane over the Sea: A flat out beautiful song, from the acoustic guitar stumming, the simplistic bass line, to the singing saw this song is wonderful. 5/5 <br />Two Headed Boy: The first song with just Jeff and his guitar. Really weird lyrics. 5/5 <br />The Fool : The first of 2 instrumental songs, this is a good example of the weird instumentation. 5/5 <br />Holland 1945: This song is about Anne Frank, and how Jeff wishes he could go back in time to save her 5/5 <br />Communist Daughter: More weird lyrics \\"Semen stains the mountian tops\\" 5/5 <br />Oh Comely: This is another song about Anne Frank, Its amazing how Jeff can keep your attention with just a guitar and his voice for almost 6 minutes before the trumpets kick in. 5/5 <br />Ghost: I think this song is another one about anne frank but im not quite sure. Distorted acoustic guitar, trumpets, and drums are the  main instruments in this song <br />[Untitled]: This is probably the weirdest song that i have ever heard, the only instrument i can recognize is the drums and the trombone <br />Two Headed Boy Pt 2: My favorite song on the album, this song is partially about Anne Frank. Everytime i hear this song i want to cry, its that beautiful.  <br /> <br />Oh and by the way its not a concept album, about half the songs on here are about Anne Frank, Jeff Mangum had somewhat of an obsession with her. Most of the time Jeff says she hes talking about anne frank. <br /> <br />Too bad there will never be another Neutral Milk Hotel album.
B0001NBMBC|5.0|1. \\"Prelude 3.0\\" (C-). Average opener.    2. \\"The Blister Exists\\" (A+). Fassst. This song will have you moshing the whole way through. Great for blasting in your car, and anywhere else really. The guitar is ruthless.     3. \\"Three Nil\\" (C+). Nothing great here but nothing bad either. I usually skip this though.    4. \\"Duality\\" (A). Very versatile song that shows Coreys wide range of talents. Goes from slow, to loud, to fast, to slow again. Great choice for a single.     5. \\"Opium of the People\\" (B-). Doesnt stand out but is good enough to be in your rotation.    6. \\"Circle\\" (B+). One of the best acoustic songs Ive heard lately.    7. \\"Welcome\\" (D+). Sounds too 80s.     8. \\"Vermilion\\" (A-). Great song that really picks up around the 2 minute mark. You can really sing along to this ish.    9. \\"Pulse of the Maggots\\" (B). A tribute to us. And we love it. Great live, go watch.    10. \\"Before I Forget\\" (A). Perfect mix of sounds and riffs. Also has an anthem like chorus that gets you pumped.    11. \\"Vermilion Pt. 2\\" (C). Preferred part 1.     12. \\"The Nameless\\" (A-). The chorus will have you scratching your head because its so soft, but the end drops with a bang.    13. \\"The Virus of Life\\" (D). A filler.     14. \\"Danger\\" (B+). Great way to close the album. I love the piano in the backround. Creepy, yet deep.
B0007O38F8|5.0|<br /> <br />Wow,  I am very suprised at 50!  I thought he was going to get caught up in the sophmore superstition of jinx's,  But this premiere artist has done it again.  I respect  \\"fiddy\\" as being an artist and knowing what the peeps want to hear, not just what he wants to put on the records as well.  Starting out with the intro of this CD, <br /> <br />5 mics <br />\\"Intro\\" - it connotates the true meaning of\\" The \\"Valentines Day Massacre\\" which was the original name for the album that was suppose to be released on Feb 9th.  Anylyze it for yourself! <br /> <br />4.5 mics <br />\\"In My Hood\\" - I get the Dark type of groove and mood from this song, which reminds me of the whole Get Rich or Die Trying Disc.  He's showing you that \\"even though I do have the money, I am staying true to myself and the hood by telling you the way that I actually am.\\"  Furthermore, he explains what life is like in the Hood!  What is it like \\"fiddy\\"?  <br /> <br />4.5 mics <br />\\"This Is 50\\" - Explains itself. ... Honestly I dont like the Production that much, but who am I?  Well I do!!  I dont know! that beat is crazy. <br /> <br />5 mics <br />\\"I'm Supposed To Die Tonight\\" - Same feel as the second track.  But  On this track I can envision what it was like a little when Tupac, and Biggie died, a little, they knew that htey where supposed to die. The night was still but loud!  Loud in their minds.  Otherwise, I feel Curtis Jackson paints pictures like Picasso, and Jackson Pollack on this record.  Abstract and errogeneous paintings of Blue, Red, and Black: gunshots, feet running and streaming blood flowing. <br /> <br />5 mics <br />\\"Gatman and Robbin\\" - You got it, Batman and Robin.  And He uses the term cleverly -- Robbing as to Robbin', the slang term.  Come on here folks (Eminem and Fiddy)!!!????? <br />  <br />4.5 mics (both) <br />\\"Candy Shop and Outta Control\\" - Those are Clubn Bangers no matter what You think.  Hate or Love It (NO PUN) their great for the club. <br /> <br />5 mics<br />\\"Get In My Car\\" - Vivica?  I honestly dont think he did the record for Vivica.  The only reason is Because 50 only does one track for the ladies on each album.  i.e. 21 Questions; Massacre - \\"Build You Up\\" \\"Intro\\" on this Disc; Beg For Mercy - \\"Smile\\"-- Lloyd Banks.  In turn Maybe he will record no songs for the ladies on the next project I'm waiting for! <br /> <br />5 mics (all 4) <br />\\"Ski Mask Way\\", A Baltimore Love Thing, Ryder Music, Disco Inferno - Those Songs, I got nothing to say! <br /> <br />4.5 mics <br />\\"Just A Lil Bit\\" - This is a good Dance type record, I Like It.  It probably lacks one component in the beat or the production of the song as a whole. <br /> <br /> <br />5 mics (both) <br />\\"Guns Come Out\\", \\"My Toy Soldier\\", \\"Postition of Power\\" - All three of these song are great concept, I also Enjoy the different moods that he uses on all of these songs.  On the same account,  the order of these songs in the Disc work very well for this story that 50 Cent is depicting called the \\"Massacre\\" <br /> <br />5 mics <br />\\"Build You Up\\" - Thats One of the girl songs I think also. It reminds me of A Tupac in \\"Keep Your Head Up\\". <br /> <br />5 mics <br />\\"God Gave Me Style\\" - I really wouldve given It infinite mics I could, but whatever.  My fav. track on the whole disc, well This is Honestly my fav. track from his Whole Career:  Underground Mixtapes to 50 Cent Is the Future to His Most recent \\"the Massacre\\".  All around everthing on this track is beautiful.  The production is awesome, and What he says amazes his fans.  Reminds me of a Nas \\"World is Yours\\", Jay-Z's \\"Regrets\\" and Tupac's \\"To Live and Die In L.A.\\".  P E R F E C T!!! <br /> <br />5 mics <br />\\"So Amazing\\" - - Amazing! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002TYX|5.0|Beatles Anthology 1, like most say, is not for people just getting into the Beatles. Some believe the Beatles sounded better in their younger days, and yes, some of the songs on here that appeared later in their career have better versions when the Beatles are younger. Some live versions are good and some practice versions are good. If you love the Beatles, go for this album. If you like originals and do not like live tracks, this album is probably not for you. But if you like the Beatles, this album is worth every penny.
B000065PUE|4.0|This CD was my introduction to the Pixies, and I must say, it's quite good. The second half drags a little, but it is still better than other bands regular songs. The frantic screaming, the quaint sweet melodies, the... uh... odd lyrics, It all comes together to make a very enjoyable and odd listening experience.  <br /> <br />Stay Out Of The Daylight! <br /> <br /> <br />Isaac!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Aahhh...Green Day. I remember first hearing Green Day when I was 15 and their album was Nimrod. I loved the album a lot especially the song \\"Time Of Your Life\\", which incidently was used on E.R. (my favourite show at that time). So, for me...Green Day were like the fathers of punk rock. Fast forward to 2005, and we have all kinds of clowns with high pitched voices singing punk rock tunes, about everything from \\"doing it with Madonna\\" to \\"Stacy's mom\\". Green Day, while occasionally coming out with catchy tunes, never really shone the way they did on Nimrod. But with the release of American Idiot, I really have to admit, they have outdone themselves. <br /> <br />This album is really good. It has catchy tunes which stays in your head, it has good lyrics and it's a bit more experimental compared to Green Day's previous records. There are 2 songs both about 9 minutes long, something I've never seen coming from Green Day, but it works so well. If you're turned off from buying this album based on their 1st single \\"American Idiot\\", don't worry...in my opinion, that's the weakest song, although not particularly bad. Honestly, this album is very impressive from the vocals to the music...everything sounds great. I also managed the catch a live show of Green Day...man, these guys rock hard. The intensity is amazing. <br /> <br />Some people like to criticize that this group is not rock, it's pop. Some say they give rock a bad name and some even say they're overhyped. Well, everyone has their opinions, but what I want to ask them is \\"Did you enjoy the album?\\". To me, the answer is a definite yes and no matter what \\"genre\\" these guys come from, I'm proud of owning this album. That much I can say. Hope my review has been helpful.
B000007T1M|5.0|Wow, System Of A Down is incredible. On first listen, it may seem chaotic and unmanageble.(spelled wrong, I know), But what makes this band great is thier attention to detail. They are somewhat like the Beatles. They All sing, They arent afraid to make \\"interesting\\" music with exotic time changes, rythyms and key signatures, They have odd facial hair, they are not afraid to sing in a falsetto, they have sublime lyrics, and the lead singer (serj is to lennon) both have whiny voices that sound great. Serj sounds like a drill Sgt. During some parts, a beatnik during others, and serj everytime else. The Drumming Is great. The Basswork is Great. The Guitar Is Great. So this is why thier self titled is my favorite. NO,its Toxicity. No, its steal this album... I dont Know. All I have to Say is that out of all the TERRIBLE bands today i.e, everyone on mtv and radio, This band is an oasis in a cultural wasteland. BUY NOW!!! <br /> <br />Stay Out Of The Daylight! <br /> <br />Isaac.
B0002IQJUK|4.0|This has got to be the surprise of the year for me. Someone recommended this album to me, and I decided to give it a try. And I don't regret it one bit. First off, I don't normally listen to this kind of music....in fact I hate artists like Ryan Cabrera and Jesse McCartney. It's nothing against them, it's just not my taste in music. I have also never watched \\"One Tree Hill\\" which I heard uses one of Gavin Degraw's songs as the theme. So, you're probably wondering what's so special about this album then... <br /> <br />Well, something I really like about this album is Gavin Degraw's voice. There's a kind of honesty to the guy's voice without sounding sappy and overproduced. When you listen to this album, it doesn't seem like he wants to sell records, it feels like he just wants to tell you a story. The lyrics are nothing spectacular, but as I said...it is entertaining. I normally mention standout tracks, but they're all equally good. <br /> <br />In short, give this album a try...I'm sure you'll enjoy it, I sure do. It's especially a nice listen when you're in a calm, and relaxed mood. Highly recommended and great debut by Gavin Degraw.
0451528956|4.0|I am reading this book for my senior literature class.  This was one of the best books that we have read all through high school.  I would definaly recommend this book to anyone.  This book lets you explore many cases of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.  You would definatly enjoy this book if you like mystery because the whole book you are trying to figure out the mystery behind the two main characters.
0393035158|5.0|\\"The End of Faith\\" by Sam Harris, is a clarion call to the world.  Sam Harris is the Thomas Paine of this century.  Thomas Paine was the greatest of the Founding Fathers of the United States of America, his tract, \\"Common Sense\\" in 1775, stirred the colonies to go to war against the Church/State government of England so that a free, independent, secular government would allow people to think for themselves and become free of belief in blind faith.  Then, while in prison in France he wrote \\"The Age of Reason\\" in 1792, which clearly showed the fallacy of \\"revealed religion.\\" <br /> <br />Sam Harris is now pointing out where we stand today, after failing to heed Paine's warning.  The world now stands on the brink of destruction because people believe by faith, without evidence, that they will go to \\"Paradise\\" and the \\"infidels\\" they kill will go to \\"hell.\\"  They believe this because their \\"holy book,\\" the Koran, tells them so.  The Muslims have believed this, without evidence, since the seventh century, but the difference now is: WMD are available and they will be able to kill people by the millions instead of mere thousands as on 9/11/2001. <br /> <br />Harris points out the fallacy of political correctness which says that polite people should never criticize another person's religious beliefs!  He points out the fact that people in the West are mistaken in believing that the \\"terrorists\\" are Muslim extremists, when in fact all Koran believing Muslims are extremists, because the Koran IS an extreme book that promotes death and hell to ALL infidels and eternal bliss and happiness to ALL true believers in Islam!  He lists several pages of quotes from the Koran to illustrate this truth (pp. 31-35; 109-116; 231). <br /> <br />Harris does not let the West off the hook, he points out the passages in the Old Testament that promoted death and torture to \\"heretics\\" that led to both the Inquisition and the Holocaust in Europe.  Basically, Harris shows that faith without evidence, whether Muslim, Jewish or Christian, is a bad thing, just as any science without evidence would be a bad thing.  People don't accept science without evidence, but in the case of religion they do and he gives the reasons why.  Unfortunately, we no longer have the luxury of time, time is against us.  In the seventh century Muslims had swords with which to kill the infidels; today they may acquire nuclear weapons at any moment and given their faith based beliefs there is no reason to think they would not use them! <br /> <br />Harris quotes the book of Hebrews in the New Testament, \\"Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen\\" (Hebrews 11:1) (p. 64), pointing out how this verse makes faith self-justifying.  The \\"fact\\" that there's no evidence for things hoped for \\"proves\\" our belief in \\"faith,\\" which is of course utterly ridiculous! <br /> <br />Every American needs to read this book, just as most of the people in the colonies read \\"Common Sense\\" in 1775-76 and we were delivered from the King and his Church, now we desperately need to be delivered from beliefs based on faith without evidence!  Without question Harris will be smeared and vilified as Paine was after publishing \\"The Age of Reason\\" in 1794.  He has only appeared on two or three TV shows since October of 2004, I'm sure he is being boycotted by the mainstream press - his work is too on the money - too true for them to publish! <br /> <br />R.

B0009KA7BS|4.0|This movie has almost no chance to make anybody happy. Constantine graphic novel fans will be disappointed because the character is changed and quite different from the books. Keanu fans won't see Neo (except for some time when Constantine was indecisive) and there aren't super kung fu fight sceens.  <br /> <br />That said, it's a slow moving, laid-back plot with a lot of back story which takes a bit to figure out. Rachel Weisz is very good but her character isn't developed as completely as it should have been. Keanu plays it very laconic (which, after all, is his strength) and it mostly works. But I think he should have been a bit more animated and I would have been interested in some sparks between him and Rachel.  <br /> <br />All in all, this is actually a pretty interesting movie, part The End of Days and part The Omen. I did enjoy it and I'm likely to get the dvd. Give it a rent, it's definitely worth a look.
0393317552|5.0|Damn UCLA, not only do they got all the pretty girls and a campus you wont get shot at, but they got Jared Diamond.  This book is great if you want to look at history from an analytical view.  Honestly, with the advent of modern medicine the world has forgotten how important disease is.  It's crazy to think that most epedimic diseases are enzootic, but what's more insane is that alot of people don't know what enzootic is.  A good friend of mine was asking what the latest book I read, and I started on about this book, and all I got was that he didn't study science in college, neither did I.  In a funny way, this book got me to think about Sun Tzu and the Art of War, if you know the rules of something but choose to disregard most except what you want, you win.  By this books acounts disease can only happen if a set of other variables happens, and then it can come in and wipe out civilizations or alter them.  It would of been nice if the ice age didn't wipe out horses in the Americas, then the Spaniards would of had a fight.
0312995423|3.0|I am an information technology student, and base on my knowledge I can tell you Dan Brown did not do his research well, there are several things that are not right about the \\"facts\\" of this book. Many of them are merely technical, but others are really bad mistakes that are the base of the story. For instance, you can only do a brute force attack on an encrypted text if you know the algorithm used to encrypt it. So if they didn't knew the algorithm used to encrypt the \\"unbreakable code\\" because it was encrypted with itself, trying to break it with TRNSLTR was senseless. Second, if with a key you could decrypt the code, you need a decryptor program for that algorithm, and so the decryption part of the algorithm needed to be decrypted for the \\"key\\" to be useful. If the whole algorithm was encrypted with itself, then there was no way to decrypt it even having the key. So there was no sense in putting it in TRNSLTR or in any computer, besides, the idea that it was in fact a virus and not really an unbreakable code came to my mind at the very begining of the story, so if I am just a student, someone as \\"experienced\\" as Strathmore could not be so stupid to make that mistake. Next, the \\"Caesar code\\" is simply called a \\"column transposition\\" algorithm and was not used in Rome. I could just list tons of other facts to destroy Dan Brown's story here, but my review would get very boring. Why did I gave it 3 stars then? It's a very entertaining story, as Dan Brown's normally are, so even with those severe mistakes I could enjoy the book, but it could have been a lot better if the \\"facts\\" were more real. <br /> <br />An additional thing: for those who care about it an \\"unbreakable code\\" actually exists: if you use any algorithm, no matter which, with a key longer than the cleartext, you will have more keys than cleartexts and that would make a brute force attack useless because by trying every possible key you will also get every possible cleartext, and there's no way you couldidentify the real one.
B0007P3582|1.0|This album takes the word horrible to a brand new level. It is a prime example of what is happening to rap. The only thing 50 raps about other than himself are his material possesions and hoes. This is the worst album I have ever listened to.  <br />   My friend burned this for me right after it came out. I listened to it once, took it outside, and shot it with my pistol.  <br />   If you want a good rap/hiphop album, get out and cop something by MF Doom, Wordsworth, Kanye West or De La Soul. <br /> <br />   Overall I would give this album a 0/10. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!! THE MORE YOU BUY THE MORE GARBAGE HE WILL PUT OUT!!! <br />
B0000DZEA1|5.0|This is one of the best soundtracks in the world, one a Lord of the Rings fan-- even the lowest one-- needs to own. It captures the heart and soul of the mvie so easily it almost scary, and the music will forever be stuck in your head.<br /><br />  If you listen to this CD with your eyes closed, you can see the entire movie. And what's more, if you read the book while listening to it, it becomes something truly amazing.<br /><br />  LOTR fans, 'the hour of need' is upon us. Get this soundtrack now, or your mistake will forever be the \\"fool of a Took'.

0790732203|2.0|I ended up watching this movie on the TV the other night (quite late on, so it wasn't censored), and I'm so glad I didn't buy the DVD, cos although I managed to sit through the movie, it never really got going for me. It just seemed to plod along at it's own pace and never really got going. At least for me. I've heard it compared to (better) films like most recently, The Girl Next Door.<br /><br />Tom Cruise didn't really convince that he was playing a teenager, and I can't figure out why either. The director tried to make him look more like a teenager, by making him work out 7 days a week in order to lose ten pounds. Once that had been accomplished, he immediately ceased working out and ate extremely fatty foods in order to add a layer of baby fat. This is how he achieved that \\"fresh-faced\\" teenage look. I'll agree that he did look fresh faced, but not enough to convince me. I just can't put my finger on it.<br /><br />I liked Rebecca De Mornay in The Hand That Rocks The Cradle, and her practically brief appearance in Identity, but in this she was average. And for the guys, she appears briefly full frontal. Hasn't she had a bit of work done since then?!<br /><br />For me, this film was well below average, and not worth watching at all. I'm so glad I didn't waste the money I didn't have on a DVD. Don't believe everything you hear.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Finally, it's happened- Mariah Carey's comeback. For real, this time. After three crappy albums (\\"Rainbow\\", \\"Glitter\\", and \\"Charmbracelet\\"), a humiliating breakdown, getting paid $28 million by Virgin to take her ass elsewhere, and wrecking her voice to tatters from a decade of glass-shattering histronics, the divine Miss MC is back and ready to rock the pop charts all over again. Carey hyped up \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" by proclaiming it was a new direction for her and liberating both musically and lyrically. The R&B-driven dance and pop ballads are still here, so essentially it's the same formula since she began exploring hip-hop with \\"Daydream\\" and tackled it head-on with \\"Butterfly\\". Yet the feeling on \\"Emancipation\\" is one of incredible confidence. For the first time since the '90s drew to a close, Mariah Carey actually sounds comfortable and believable in her surroundings. There's no more of the wannabe street diva that defined \\"Rainbow\\", no more of the unfocused, I'm-a-superstar-because-I-can-be vibes of \\"Glitter\\", no more of the forced overhaul in cleaning up her shattered image and career with the bland \\"Charmbracelet\\". \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" takes the best of Carey and finally puts it all together cohesively. Kick-off single \\"It's Like That\\" is a sparse Neptunes-inspired number that boasts more fun than her other attempts at hip-hop jams, while \\"We Belong Together\\" is a sweet, simple ballad with a bit more grit and far more reserve than her previous show-stopping slow jams (i.e. \\"Hero\\", \\"Through the Rain\\"). With an explosive No.1 debut and \\"It's Like That\\" and \\"We Belong Together\\" performing impressively well on the charts (\\"We Belong Together\\" became the sixteenth No.1 single of her career), it seems as if the rest of the world is ready to embrace \\"Mimi\\", and while it may not be on the same par with her two best albums of the '90s- \\"Daydream\\" and \\"Butterfly\\"- it's certainly the best record she's issued in this decade.
B00006AFUR|4.0|Coming out of the gate, 30 Seconds To Mars had a lot to prove, seeing as how a lot of attention was paid on frontman Jared Leto, and not the band as a whole.  Would the band be good enough to come out on top of this focus?  Actually, after listening to the album time and time again, I think a better question would be who would have thought that any band fronted by a popular Hollywood actor could have turned out to be this good?  To put it simply, 30 Seconds To Mars is a good band.  Really good.  <br /> <br />30 Seconds To Mars doesn't really play the style of music that one would expect from a band fronted by Jared Leto.  Instead, they play the style of music that a band with a name like 30 Seconds To Mars should play.  With a sound reminiscent of Tool mixed with Pink Floyd with a dash of Rush thrown in, 30STM flies around in the space-rock vein of modern music. <br /> <br />With lyrics that often return to the topic of astronomy and astrology and heavy guitars that dip into flights fueled by echo and delay, this album is not your average modern rock.  However, that's also part of it's appeal.  The songs are interesting and unique and, to top it all off, they're really well written. <br /> <br />Starting with the spacey, head-rush that is Capricorn, the album goes for the stars and almost makes it to its destination. <br />Throughout the entire length of the album, the band makes it clear that they can play.  They are not just another vanity project, and it's an added bonus that Leto can actually really sing.  Song after song provide surprise after surprise with two stunning numbers coming by the names of 'Oblivion' and 'Buddha For Mary'.  These two numbers prove just how excellent the band can be, with 'Oblivion' showing how intricate, crushing and beautiful the band can be musically and 'Buddha For Mary' showcasing what a unique and gripping lyricist Leto can be. <br /> <br />Sure, not all the songs on the album go as far as the others (The Mission and 93 MillionMiles are probably the two weakest cuts here, but to be honest, it's difficult to pick a 'weak' cut), but for a debut album, it's pretty amazing.  If all modern rock bands were this interesting, well, the rock world would be an entirely different game today.
B00003CXCT|5.0|First off VERY LITTLE CGI WAS USED TO REPLACE EXISTING SCENES! HAYDEN CHRISTENSEN OVER SEBASTIAN SHAW(that bothered me as you'll read on). THE SARLAC WAS GIVEN A MOUTH (oh,boo hoo) AND IAN MCDIARMID REPLACED CLIVE REVILL. THE PICTURE WAS ONLY ENHANCED AND CLEANED UP! THE IMPERIAL MARCH WAS NEVER PLAYED WHEN DARTH VADER BOARDED PRINCESS LEIA'S SHIP (ORIGINAL OR ENHANCED). AND THE RANCOR WAS NOT SWICHED TO CGI. FOR YOU PEOPLE WHO DO NOT LIKE THIS SET, GET YOUR INFO STRAIGHT AND STOP TELLING LIES! I did my best to compare this set with the original VHS versions. If I missed anything crucial I'm terribly sorry. I'm writing this from an honest human perspective. Improved picture quality and sharp edge lightsabers. This is a good thing. Only a fool would tell you otherwise. For anyone who hasn't read this review before the change, I did state having Jabba the Hutt in A NEW HOPE was a good idea. However, now that I think about it, the Jabba sequence should have been left out for the sake of maintaining the mystique of who this talked about character was until revealed in JEDI.  One change I find interesting is the Cantina scene. Originally there is a black werewolf taking a drink from a cup. It's replaced by a lizard in a floppy beret taking a drink from a bottle. I personally prefer the werewolf. The Death Star explosion is more dynamic. This is good. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK;changing \\"You're lucky you don't taste very good\\" to \\"You were lucky to get out of there\\" is bad,very bad... Using Ian Mcdiarmid for The Emperor hologram? Definately a good thing. RETURN OF THE JEDI; New song at Jabba's palace sucked.  Sucked is too vague.  Not appropriate is more like it. Not appropriate in the sense that it did not fit in with what you would expect the crowd at Jabba's palace to listen to. And of course, I do not like the fruitified Lord of the Ring sounding music at the end. Even though the original Ewok music was a little hokey and embarrassing, at least it seemed more fitting with the scene. Removing eyebrows and changing eye color of Anakin for unmasking? Good idea. Using Hayden Christensen as Anakin's ghost? Bad idea. The best idea would have been is to take Sebastian Shaw, keep him bald, clear up his scars, digitally of course [I'll accept this] and have him in a black cloak. Getting this DVD box set? Good idea. Whining like babies and telling others not to buy the set because it doesn't meet with your approval? Bad, selfishly bad. SO YOU SEE FOLKS, I TOO HAD SOME ISSUES WITH THIS SET, BUT I EXPERIENCED ALOT MORE HAPPINESS FROM IT. SHOW ME ONE PIECE OF DOCUMENTED LAW THAT GEORGE LUCAS HAD TO PUT THIS TRILOGY ON DVD AT ALL. I for one am grateful for what he's given us. LIKE... I... SAID... \\"SOME CHANGES I LIKED, SOME I DIDN'T\\"  I hope no one has a stroke or massive heart attack. While the one reviewer uses a persuasive arguement for the use of Hayden Christensen as Anakin's ghost, I still say Sebastian Shaw made more sense. Here's why. It shouldn't matter your level of Jedi power. It should matter the goodness of your heart. When Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker sacraficied his own life in order to destroy the Emperor and save his son (who was the only one who had faith in his goodness). He then finally became the selfless good Jedi that brought balance to the force. That's why the movie is called RETURN OF THE JEDI. Also Hayden Christensen's Anakin Skywalker was NEVER 100% on the good side of the force. Therefore, that is why it is totally senseless to have his ghost appear in JEDI. Sebastian Shaw however diplayed genuine remorse and atoned for his evil deeds. Plus we didn't see a Ewen McGregor Obiwan or a PHANTOM MENACE CGI Yoda. Continuity my butt.  Face it Hayden was used only to promote REVENGE OF THE SITH and increase the female audience. Oh yes, I forgot to mention there's also the bonus disc. Lots of great stuff. Enjoy!
B0002OERI0|2.0|Heavy guitar riffs, pulsing drums, and pop-punky alternative--it's what Green Day was meant for. I loved their 90's albums, such as Dookie and Nimrod: songs like \\"Hitchin' a Ride\\" and \\"Long View\\" were always my favorites. <br /> <br />Now, with American Idiot... Green Day has kind of shamed itself. It's gained popularity with the average pre-teenage consumer base of pop-music, sure, but it's lost the respect of me. All of the songs are deathly rotting slow, processed sounding, with predictable melodies, unhappy emo-kid lyrics, and none of the fun that Green Day's past albums had. <br /> <br />With the exception of the title track \\"American Idiot\\", I found most of the album downright dull and overrated. While \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" was alright at first, after the first 40,000,000,000,000 times played on the radio, I grew tired of even that. The cd as a whole seems to be trying too hard to be deep and thoughtful, more mature I suppose--however, all it ends up doing is putting me to sleep. <br /> <br />If you're a big fan of the pop-punk and drowning emo-sounds heard over the radio these days; I say go for it. It's the perfect cd for you. But if you're looking for the elusive, non-processed, fun to listen to, and dancy 90's Green Day who had -their own- sound, find an earlier album. This isn't worth it.
B0009MDPYM|3.0|I enjoyed this movie ... even though Keanu Reeves seems to play the same character in everything he does!  Still, this movie was visually interesting and had some good ol' standard Good vs. Evil stuff going on.  Not as good as other good vs evil movies I have seen but not too shabby.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|Hey, what else can I say?  That's my opinion.  Maybe I'm just too old (47) to get the juvenile, excretory \\"humor\\" of this film, but I just thought it wasn't very intelligent.  Lots of stereotypes, bad songs, grossouts, and cursing (mf, f, etc.) make \\"Team America\\" an exercise in bad taste.<br /><br />It looked like a propaganda film from the Bush administration.  American actors (F.A.G.) are made to look like collaborators with Kim Jong-Il, the very strange \\"Dear Leader\\" of North Korea.  Americans who wish blow the hell out of everything are the heroes of this movie.  Thing is, I wouldn't have really cared which side the heroes or bad guys were on if this movie was really funny-which it is not.  The \\"gags\\" are gross and disgusting, and not worth laughing at.<br /><br />This was one of those \\"not finished\\" DVDs, I'm sorry to say.  When the dude puked up a Lake Michigan-sized puddle of you-know-what, that was pretty much it.
B0007NFL1S|4.0|I am a Gen-Xer who grew up with Rap and Hip Hop ... and while I am sick to death of these artists exploiting black women in their songs and videos I will say that there are a few of these folks who have tremendous talent.  50 cent is one of them.  I don't always agree with what they say in their songs, but I can tell who's got game and who doesn't.  50 cent is all over it.
B00030590I|1.0|This is one of the worst big budget movies ever made. It is very much on the same order as Ed Wood's films, \\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\\", etc. The spectacular fight scenes that \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\" maintained effortlessly, only destroy the suspension of disbelief in this movie. And going over the story of what actually happened three different times, with three different explanations, becomes less and less interesting each time through. The director's attempt to explore a philosophical point while making an action movie fails completely. If I had been in a movie theater instead of at home, I would have walked out before the film was finished.
B000059Z8J|5.0|There are just some human beings on this planet that were made to play certain roles:  Linda Carter as Wonder Woman, Tobey Maguire as Spiderman, Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones ... and Christopher Reeve as Superman.  You just can't get much better than this!!  What great casting for this movie.  Gene Hackman is absolutely brilliant as Lex Luthor.  This movie along with greats like Star Wars, Jaws and Jurassic Park will go down in history as the Gen-X classics!  Christopher Reeve:  What A Super-Man ... Rest in Peace, my dear!
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I only gave this movie 1 star because no stars was not an option.  It was so hyped that my wife and I watched it.  I love dumb humor when done well.  But to put this movie in perspective, think of the worst movie you have seen and then rank Napolean Dynamite lower.  This movie was such a worthless piece of crap that the producers should have to pay me restitution.  I did not laugh once during this pitiful excuse for a movie.  After seeing this movie a traffic pileup on the evening news will look funny.  Instead of wasting money on this \\"movie\\", save it and send a thank you or a dollar to anyone who warned you from it.
B0007GAERG|3.0|What ever happened to the good ol' days for Mariah?  When this woman first hit the scene she was absolutely fabulous.  Just about everything she put out worked.  The last few albmus she has done have been horrible.  What the heck is going on?  Who's picking her music material.  This woman has a voice to die for and she isn't using it the way she used to.  Other than the song It's Like That (which is really just a silly, low grade, catchy tune) the rest of the album is very a-typical of the current Hip-Hop, Pop and R&B scene now:  shallow, uninspiring with everything sounding exactly the same.  Can you truly distinguish between what Beyonce, Mariah, Amerie and others put out?  No!  They all have the same sound -- its so used up and passe!  I hate that.      Mariah used to be unique, but now she's just towing the same old R&B line.  I think we may have lost her for good.  I don't think this CD is all that great.  If you like typical silly cookie-cutter R&B pop then you'll like this.  If you like Mariah in her early days, you won't.  Keep that in mind.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Before I write this, know that I do not usually stoop to the level of writing track by track specific reviews, but \\"With Teeth\\" is not so much a cohesive \\"album\\" per se as a NIN album like \\"The Downward Spiral\\". This is definitely Reznor's most different album, with the majority of the influence drawn from \\"Broken\\" and \\"The Fragile\\", in my opinion. The heavy tracks are heavy, and the mellow tracks are mellow (for the most part). Also, this album would probably get 4.5 stars, but since that option is unavailable, and also to try and average out the terrible 1-star \\"OMG TRENT SUX\\" reviews. <br /> <br />\\"All The Love in the World\\" - The opener is a brilliant piece of music, creating a pulse that throbs until 3 and some odd minutes into the song, where the lovely piano line takes over. From this, Reznor rides the line until the end of the song, with a stong returning vocal performance. 9/10 <br /> <br />\\"You Know What You Are?\\" - The first kick to the face. Speedy double-bass drums and Trent's enraged vocals bring the listener back to the \\"Broken\\" days, with the chorus completely exploding through the listener's speakers. A stellar track. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"The Collector\\" - A weaker song, much more laid back and different from the first two. The lyrics are also lacking, but the synth/bass line holds the song together very well. The vocals aren't as impressive as the first two tracks, but the song is decent nonetheless. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"The Hand that Feeds\\" - Ah yes, the object of so much controversy, hype, excitment and all else. It is also probably the most simple song on the album. The lyrics are still down a bit, but the effectiveness of the song writing on this track are evident, and it's message is carried across very well. 9/10 <br /> <br />\\"Love is Not Enough\\" - This will take most a few listens to appreciate, but it's industrial to the core. Vaguely a reminder of \\"The Collector\\" in it's \\"New-NIN\\" style, I find it to be a charming song, with a neat little synth in the chorus. Still, the best is yet to come. 8/10 <br /> <br />\\"Every Day is Exactly The Same\\" - Arguably the album's breadwinner. Lovely chorus, effective use of synth in the verse and overall a heartfelt performance. The songwriting is utilized to perfection on this track, definitely one of NIN's best ever. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"With Teeth\\" - This one is bound to be misunderstood. An awesome, industrial, heavy song, with an unexpected break in the middle, leading to an absolute explosion of am ending. The lyrical content is also nice, with Reznor's \\"obsessiveness\\" shining through clearly. \\"AWITHA TEETHA\\"! 9.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Only\\" - Without a doubt, the album's strangest song. A sort of Michael Jackson influenced drum beat, with a very, very 80's style synth. Reznor sounds absolutely upbeat here, seeming to have a good time. This one is definitely a love or hate. I appreciate it, but it's not one of my favourites. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Getting Smaller\\" - Probably the most \\"rock\\" song on here, it's a bit strange after the last track, but very nice. The live drumming is a wonderful touch on this album, and is wholly evident here as an asset. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Sunspots\\" - Here we go. A killer synth line, beautiful lyrics. One of the best tracks, has to be heard. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" - Quite the \\"steam of consciousness\\" of the album. It's not quite \\"The Day the World Went Away II\\", but it's close. Not one of my favourites, just because the next song completely blows it away. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />\\"Beside You In Time\\" - A song to be heard under the influence. Probably the best song on the album, in my opinion. Emotional, trippy, beautiful. 10/10 <br /> <br />\\"Right Where It Belongs\\" - A new \\"Hurt\\"? No, (I will get crucified by the NIN fanbase for this ) I feel that it is a much better song. The chord progression is completely astounding, the lyrics are beautiful, as all as the piano line. NIN really puts together the total package for thelast track here, and walks away with another winner. 10/10 <br /> <br />Overall, \\"With Teeth\\" is my choice for the best album of 2005 thus far (Today being May.15). I can only hope that NIN will continue to produce such excellent music in the future. Definitely a worthwhile purchase, and also a landmark in the realm of modern music.
B0007Y08I8|4.0|This movie is crazy.  It makes fun of everybody and that's what makes it great.  You see everyone's faults.  This movie is so damn gross, but it is funny.  Not for the faint of heart!  When I saw this at the movie theatre, I noticed a young boy there with his parents.  I'm sure his parents were trying to cover his eyes and ears throughout the show ...  <br /> <br />A great laugh and oddly enough a very accurate view of the times we live in ... get this and laugh your you-know-what off.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Andrew Lloyd Webber and Joel Schumaker did a fantastic job bringing this well loved musical to the screen.  I am glad they didn't try to duplicate the stage show.  With a film, you can see the actors' faces and see the emotions.  It's more intimate.  They were wise to capitalize on this.  Gerard Butler is quite charismatic on the screen and it's easy to see how Christine might be torn between him and Raoul.  Emmy Rossum is marvelous!  What a presence she has on screen, especially for a person so young!  Her singing voice is beautiful with an innocent quality to it.  Patrick Wilson, who played Raoul, has a truly beautiful singing voice.  I appreciate that they made him more of a swashbuckling hero in the movie. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />I have noticed that a lot of people criticize this movie by the way it relates to the stage show.  I don't get this criticism, truly I do  not.  For one thing, Andrew Lloyd Webber himself was intimately involved with the making of this film.  He was there when the principal roles were cast.  \\"Behind the Mask,\\" a documentary featured in the extras on the 2nd disk, has interviews of him where he says that he wanted his Phantom to have a \\"rock and roll\\" sensibility to him.  With Gerard Butler, he got it!  Not only did Butler do a fine job with the singing, his acting was incredible! I don't think Michael Crawford, as lovely as his voice is, has the screen presence Butler has.  Films and Stage productions must be different by definition, and I think the filmmakers were wise to recognize this.  As ALW said in the interview, if you don't have the contrast between the \\"dangerous\\" Phantom and the lovely lyric tenor Raoul, you don't see why Christine might be attracted to the Phantom.  I must say I agree.
B000127LW2|3.0|Early seasons of Star Trek Voyager are a bit bland and uneven.  Everything just feels a little off.  Personally, I don't think Voyager gains its sea-legs until well into the 3rd and 4th seasons.  Having watched all the Star Trek series religiously, I was disappointed in Voyager ... had high hopes for it especially do to them making the captain a woman.  Plus the Voyager crew was the most diverse Star Trek crew there was with the exception of the original trek:  A female captain, a Native American first officer, A Black Vulcan, A half human half klingon bridge officer ... what more could you ask for you say?  How about better dialog and better acting!  It took a while for these folks to fill their roles.   <br /> <br />When buying Star Trek DVD's my belief is always that you should buy the whole collection.  Its not complete otherwise ... but don't expect every season to be good.  The gist with TNG, DS9, Voyager and even Enterprise to a lesser extent is that they get better as the seasons progress.  DS9, hands down though, is the best!
B000001Y79|5.0|This is definately No Doubt's best album to date. The songs are bouncy, catchy, and just plain fun to listen to. The band made wonderful hit songs without being dirty and without cursing every other lyric (something I find very cool and interesting...).  <br /> <br />THE BEST ON THE CD: <br /> <br />Happy Now (4/5) <br />Hey You (5/5--they used a sitar or harpsichord, or something. anyway, the solo is amazing!!) <br />Sixteen (5/5 for the chorus) <br />Don't Speak (of course...6/5!) <br />Tragic Kingdom (4/5--I wish I could shave off the last 2 minutes of this song, cuz it really goes on, but it's an interesting view on Disneyland!) <br /> <br />All in all, this is THE No Doubt CD to buy. Amazing in every way!

That my friends is what Iron Maiden has done for some 28 years and here is no different. Dance of Death is full of great lyrics, solos and songs that will be among their best.

156224003X|3.0|This book could be described as an attempt to apply pseudo-Zen teachings to music practice and performance. While it contains some valuable thoughts, much of it is totally impracticle, idealistic, and in conflict with how musical development actually works.<br /><br />At the beginning, Werner claims \\"Innovation IS Jazz!\\" and he fills  half a page with \\"proof\\" of this assertion. First, I do not see the relevance of this page to the rest of the book. Second, Werner is not an jazz innovator; if he knows the secret of jazz innovation, why hasn't he produced any innovations?<br /><br />There is some valuable advice in the \\"fear\\" chapters. Werner describes some harmful mindsets many students get into when they are practicing, listening, teaching, and composing.<br /><br />The affirmations Werner recommends are useful if you do not really enjoy playing or if you are not satisfied with your current ability. While they won't actually make you play better  (at least not much better), they may be able to help you overcome mental blocks that are preventing you from enjoying the experience of playing music. (It is supposed to be enjoyable, as  many musicians seem to have forgotten these days!)<br /><br />There are far too many specific points to go into in this review, but I will highlight a couple.<br /><br />First, Werner thinks interference from the \\"mind\\" while practicing is destructive. I disagree. When practicing, the execution of a passage should never be repeated thoughtlessly. After each repetition, you should use your \\"mind\\" to decide what was correct about that execution and what needs to be changed. Through this constant process of self-correction, your playing becomes more and more refined. If you merely play things over and over again without thinking, this will occur much more hap-hazardly, if at all.<br /><br />Second, Werner believes that things need to be practiced to TOTAL mastery before you move on to something else. This is both silly and dangerous. First, you will never achieve TOTAL mastery over something in the way Werner sees it. There is always room for human error; it is always possible to botch something no matter how thoroughly you have mastered it. Second, it takes far too long to reach the point of mastery Werner is talking about for it to have any practicle value. It would take years to accomplish much of anything by this method. There are far more efficient practice methods that allow you to improve much more quickly. It is simply not necessary to achieve total mastery over every single little thing you practice.<br /><br />I could go on at length, but those are some of the more important criticisms I have of the book. I recommend it for some of the valuable insights and advice it contains, but the reader needs to think critically about what he actually adopts into his practice routine.mastery over something in the way Werner sees it.

B00030590I|2.0|This movie basically tells one story in a few different ways.  A warrior and friends are attempting to kill the emperor.  That is about it for plot.  There are several martial arts scences in this movie, but most of them are just too unbelievable.  In one scene, the main character single handedly stops hundreds of arrows without even getting hit once.  This is impossible, and that is coming from someone who used to watch DragonBall Z.    There are also to many inane comparison of fighting to various things.  Fighting is compared to music and to caligraphy, which both have nothing to do with fighting.  The is even a long, drawn out story plot in the movie involving caligraphy, which I found really boring and did not really feel that it served a purpose in the movie.    The ending of this movie is also very disappointing.  I'm not going to ruin it, but I will say that it made the movie seem rather pointless.  I really don't know why the main character was considered a hero, and frankly think that the movie was too limited on plot and did not even have a good story to begin with.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw is incredibly talented.  He has an awesome voice that sounds even better live than on this CD, which is a huge feat considering the worth of the album.  The album is fantastic.  I definitely recommend that you check it out.
B00003CX5P|4.0|The first episode of galactic saga series finally saw the light of day as the fourth Star Wars release in 1998. Previously only the fourth to sixth of the nine-episode series, THE NEW HOPE, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and THE RETURN OF JEDI respectively, had been produced during late 70s to early 80s.<br /><br />Lucas hired some Eastern philosophy element as the core theme of the story, influenced in large part by the samurai movies of AKIRA KUROSAWA. Yoda, zen-master-like character seems to be the very prototype of Miyagi-san in Karate-Kid movies. Jediism is the galactic adaptation of Bushido, the way of samurai. Also Japanese comics such as Star Blazers and Captain Harlock seemed to have given impetus to complete the setting for the movie. For example Han Solo reminds me of Captain Harlock the galactic pirate. And vivid fighting scenes of Star Blazers. (Both comics were early 70s masterpiece by Leiji Matsumoto).<br /><br />I was the bit skeptic on how the story of Darth Vader's youth could become such an entertaining movies because it would be filled with sadness, hopelessness and darkness. Now that I have seen the finished movies of the episide I and II, my anxieties faded. Part of the reasons may be that Lucas himself become mature enough to describe the development of the dark side. Also the advancement of technology gave the crew the more agility to create the scenes beyond reach during 70s.<br /><br />The villain Darth Maul does not have so much apprearance but he is so splendidly perfect foe. His movement is so glaceful and does not seem to rely on stunts.<br /><br />Anakin boy also is well charactered so that the viewer sense some slight shade in the Jedi-elect boy's mind.<br /><br />It is no dougt the nice start for the galactic saga.<br /><br />Verdict: A boy named Ani who later would become a you-know-who.<br />Rating: 84 out of 100.<br />Recommended for: Darth Vader fans and Star Wars fans.
B0009K7QZ8|4.0|Alright! Another new season of THE OC. The season has been good, although the first one was much better. This season has its shares of gaspable shocks. Not just 'dark' but you get more personal. The problems ar epersonal. My favorite aspect of the second seasonw as the whole 'Atomic County' story arc of Seth's comic. a good follow up, but not quite the revelation the first season was. bring on season 3 w/ Demi Moore as Summer's mom!!

B0000CDLA7|2.0|I want to start off by saying that i am a HUGE fan of DT and i went into this album thinking i was getting a great album, as we've come to expect from DT. Well, let's just say i was very disappointed. DT totally dropped the ball and made a mediocre Metallica-esque album that is not bad, just not DT. All of the songs sound almost the same, except the pitifully terrible Vacant, and the Superb Stream of conciousness. All of the other songs are okay, but they don't have that talent or oomph that we usually get from DT. There are some monstrous Petrucci and Portnoy moments, but they don't seem to match the song they're in. It wouldn't be a bad album if it wasn't from DT, because we expect so much more from them. Unless you're truly diehard, or you are open to new types of music, AVOID.
B00005RHGK|2.0|I had to watch the second one to fully understand the whole concept of this creature. My advice - just watch Jeepers Creepers 2. It is much better!
0393316041|5.0|This book is definitly a fun read.  As one progresses through the book there is this feeling that you are sitting with an older Mr. Feynman who is just telling you about adventures of his life a story at a time.  Very enjoyable, but just be warned that this is not a biography in a sense that his life is talked about from birth to death, it is simply a collection of terrific anecdotes, but its worth the read.

B000056NX5|3.0|Not the original, but a new British take on this classic play. Herein, I feel the aethetics are more to the point, particularly demonstrated in the polarities between the followers of the nazarene, who are basically filthy egalitarian peasants, vandalizing walls, dressed in rags {& the apostles were tattooed with crosses on their shoulders}, & who are dispersed & disciplined by `Imperial Guard'-looking enforcers {whose helmets look like Darth Vader's}, whereas the elite rulers of the day, The Sanhedrin, are frocked in black leather trenchcoats, commanding from their darkened chambres, & wearing silver medallions - verily, they could even be called \\"The Sanhedrin Grotto\\" for the overall effect of their powerful presence.<br /><br />  In this remarkable presentation, jesus is portrayed in plain `uniform' prole vestments, sans a beard - looking more like a portrayal of an angel Gabriel than a wandering jewish madman - although the character does demonstrate his self-destructive insanity, as typical of the nazarene myth.<br /><br /> Judas Iscariot is decked in what can be seen as \\"commie-punk\\" attire, which goes along well with his communistic mentality - although again, he does appear to be a much more interesting character, & a much more groomed one. It seems, according to this version, the \\"eviler\\" you are, the cleaner & neater one is.<br /><br />  So jesus disrupts the marketplace, which moved into the `holy temple' {which is quite a statement, considering the money-begging evangelists of the day}, which contained, among other things, a slot machine, voluptuous dancers, & jesus actually tosses a television set across the room. So you can see, there was much artistic liscence taken with this presentation.<br /><br /> Another mentionable dynamic I observed was the undelying homosexual undertones between the two, as well as among the apostles themselves. The embraces were more to the intimate manner, particuarly seen when Judas disturbingly gives jesus the \\"death kiss\\", with just a bit too much lingering.<br /><br /> Still more telling, jesus sings in a falsetto high, whereas Caiaphas is a deep bass baritone.<br /><br /> One impressive scene transpired when the nazarene was being led away from the Garden of Gethsemene, phantom figures in black assailed him with ghostly pallor & flashlights - the women wore shawls & cloaks {a very gothic aesthetic}, whereas the men wore leather trenchcoats & fedoras - an overall LaVeyan look.<br /><br /> Although probably the most impressive character was that of Pontius Pilate, who appeared in again, a black leather trenchcoat & general's hat, but armored in a muscular design  reminiscient of the Roman militia - an imposing figure emminating authority & Power, in a  solid 12 o' clock frame. He fiercely grills jesus while in the Roman court, & adresses the bloodthirsty crowd, who claim no other allegience except to that of Caesar. Tired of the problematic & pathetic nazarene, he sends him to be judged by Herod.<br /><br /> Herod appears on the scene surrounded in his Las Vegas-ornamented environment, complete with bowtie, ragtime cane & showgirls,, who, after a comical musical repartee', sends him back to Pilate, who sends him to be flogged, crowned with thorns, & finally, crucified. Interestingly, while on the path of pain, dragging his misery cross up to Golgotha, Judas, who had previously hung himself before a crowd of enthusiasts, appears again, dancing about with fetishistic angels {angels never looked this `good'}, who adore him accordingly, & he actually blasphemously stands upon the cross, beneath which is the crawling nazarene, jiding him impishly.<br /><br /> Mary Magdalene is played by a sexy young black girl, who arrays jesus with love & affection - the only `man' she ever loved. This originally caused some contension between Judas & she, despite her chosen profession.<br /><br /> In the end, they all witness the suicidal masochist-demigod perish like a deranged common criminal - & that is where it ends. No fantasies of resurrection, no scriptures , no blindlight references, just the display of a tragic myth in all its morose, & torment-filled splendour.anged common criminal - & that is where it ends.

B000007NZ5|5.0|An \\"occult classic\\", in My opinion, being that this album is under-appreciated and underrated, remaining a more or less \\"hidden\\" classic of Macabre Metal.<br /><br />The musick herein is memorably melodic and powerful, with an operatic voice that is truly an instrument in itself here, with clearly decipherable lyrics, which are arranged in a story-teller format, with the mood it creates as one of an eerie ambiance, and best listened to at night, in My opinion. Very theatrical in a Metal/Gothic/Horror sort of way - a wonderful combination, which is just pure dark entertainment which one can visualize in the theatre of the mind.<br /><br />\\"The Gates of Hell\\" begins with the ominous sounds which brings to mind permeating fog as an arched stone gateway creeks open, unleashing the horrors within; and therefrom, straightaway into Headless Cross, an omenic tiding as a warning to the local villagers that something wicked this way comes; but probably one of the best songs is \\"Devil & Daughter\\", which speaks to the charm of The Satanic Witch entrancing mankind while smashing all detractors; \\"When Death Calls\\"  is a ballad-like Faustian auto-eulogy of a man about to walk through the veil of mortality warning the living of the terrors to come, and to dare not mock the face of death, lest your tongue blister; I also really enjoy \\"Kill in The Spirit World\\" which to Me, grants the impression of a Magical Victory against a truly deserving individual - despite the lyrics, as a justified execution, not a so-called \\"murder\\"; \\"Call of The Wild\\" affirms the enjoyment of life to those who have the courage to accept it in all of its carnal joy; \\"Black Moon\\" is another exceptional cantible, about The Devil rising and calling forth His own by the nocturne; and as if to compliment the previous, \\"Nightwing\\" summons the creatures of the night to witness the glory of the flight.<br /><br />Obviously, there are certain typical depictions from the Judeo-Christian mythos, but it is very artfully done, with haunting tunes that float into the ether to join with the glowing moon. A frequent pleasure.done, with haunting tunes that float into the ether to join with the glowing moon. A frequent pleasure.
B00026YO36|5.0|I just, finally, discovered Mark Lanegan -his solo work- after so much time. I regret that I didn't do it earlier. I just can't see how I survived without his music. And it's hard to understand why he's not well known outside the fanbase of QOTSA and The 'Trees. I've been listening to Queens of The Stone Age for some time. And then some Screaming Trees. I finally decided to check out Lanegans' solo efforts and I'm just taken aback at the huge amount of great music and incredibly great lyrics he's produced. I really loved The Screaming Trees 'Dust' album, but his solo efforts are better. Not to be compared really, but it is apparent that he really is in his right element with his bluesier material. Lanegan is, most certainly, one of the few great songwriters. And his collaborations with P.J. Harvey are so beautiful and perfect!
B0007GAERG|3.0|Vocally, this is the best Mariah album in years! Let's face it, Charmbraclet had some good songs, but it wasn't even close to Mariah's high vocal standards. With \\"Emanicipation\\" Mariah is back to her vocal pwerhouse roots....but the songs are still dragged down by her obsession with bland rapper collaborations...something that has plagued her albums since \\"Butterfly\\" *although it worked on that one.* <br /> <br />\\"It's Like That\\" was the leadoff single and was a decent hit for her...especially compared to her last five or six solo singles. It peaked in the top 20 on the Billboard Hoy 100. It's minorly catchy, but nothing to write home about. \\"We Belong Together\\" is definitely a winner and is her biggest solo hit in years. Other winners include \\"Stay the Night\\", \\"Your Girl\\" and the only truly decent collabo, \\"Say Something\\" with Snoop Dogg. The worst track...\\"Get Your number\\" is painful. how did this make the album? <br /> <br />Sadly, the rest of the album just falls flat with me. However, I must be in the minority because the album is doing well as are the singles because WBT has re-introduced her to mainstream radio....a place where she truly has not been a dominant force since 1995-96. I'm glad for her and wish her the best, but i still miss my early/mid 90's Mariah...the Mariah that flirted with hip hop, but never let it domiante her music.
0393317552|5.0|Diamond's work here is of a fundamental nature.  He's asking a few simple questions--Why have European peoples dominated the world?  What makes them different, and why weren't they dominated instead by other groups?  Jared's answer?  They were just lucky.  They were in the right place at the right time with the right resources to accomplish an eventual empire and dominion over most  of the world. <br /> <br />An awful lot of reviewers on this site have disavowed this answer as too simplistic--too biased.  However, their criticisms miss the point entirely. <br /> <br />A common claim among these reviewers is: You can't rule out societal influences--the human, cultural factors of the rise of civilizations.  Certainly, Diamond never makes the case in Guns Germs and Steel that cultural factors play no role in the development of civilizations.  Instead, he's stating that the culture of industrialized nations had to arise due to the circumstances unique to their area.  Diamond is discarding the idea that people are somehow different mentally from one another--that there is some sort of cognitive difference, or an inherent difference in core thinking from one group of people to the next.  Culture is not spontaneous.  Our mores and thinking are the results of coping with our respective environments.  The social aspects of a society are formed in response to environmental limitations.  To claim otherwise is to fall into the trap of racial determinism.  Diamond makes the case convincingly that race does not determine culture.  Even the racial distinctions of humanity are adaptations to local environments!  <br /> <br />The naysaying reviewers on this subject may be well-read, even educated people, yet, they show a considerable lack of understanding of Diamond's ideas.  My guess is that they disliked the book before even reading it and simply scanned through it looking for weaknesses to attack.  It's not a surprise really.  Daily I meet people who read voraciously and yet never grasp what they have read nor care to understand the world around them that they study so intently.  Ideas are not thought provoking to them, only obstacles to their worldview. <br /> <br />Diamond asks great questions and provides convincing answers.  I can't ask for much more from any author.  His Pullitzer is well deserved.
B000002J1U|4.0|I have to admit. I'm a Zeppelin amateur. I am a diehard Hendrix fan, and I have every single Experience album, but I recently got Led Zeppelin 3, and I was blown away. It is just such a beautiful album. What an assortment of songs, just some great rifts and it's just a great sound. Believe it or not, I think \\"Immigrant song\\" is the worst somg on this album even though it's the most popular song on here. It just doesn't fit in with the rest of the style, which is a lot of calm of acoustic. But I highly recommend this album to a Zeppelin beginner, but as always I recommend anything by Sir Hendrix.

B00005JLEX|4.0|The \\"Seinfeld Era\\" takes a new turn as it enters the DVD realm. Milllions of people have been waiting for this to happen in the last ten years. This collection of Season One and Season Two episodes bring us back to where it all began, including the pilot that most don't remember as \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\". The earlier episodes take some \\"warming up\\" to, but Season Two Episodes begin to shape the Seinfeld culture as we know it today. The turning point, involves the \\"Chinese Restaurant\\" episode, which defines the essence of this legendary show, the \\"commonality\\" of every day life. Who hasn't wasted precious time waiting in a restaurant to be seated? This episode alone makes it a \\"must have\\" for any Seinfeld fan.

B00004WKII|5.0|This box set of four cd's offers a look into Jimi Hendrix's entire music career, including music from one of his first concerts to his last ever studio recording, a beautiful 1:45 blues jam, slimply called \\"Slow Blues.\\" The recording was damaged, so it cuts out abruptly. I think it symbolizes his abrupt death, and the end of the recording always brings a tear to my eye, because it just makes me think, \\"well, that's the end of Jimi.\\" This compilation is for a diehard Hendrix fan. It consists mostly of alternate takes and live cuts. It gives some of the earliest cuts of some of his songs. In fact, it gives the first cut of (Have you ever been to) Electric Ladyland? and that's the goood stuff as far as I'm concerned. There are many songs on here that Jimi never released, but you can find some of them on South Saturn Delta. What's amazing to think though is that if Jimi's family released a full length album of material that he never released every year for the next 20 years, there would still be more unheard music. The guy was only recording for three fu***ng years! Look at all the man accomplished. He was a genius, a brilliant genius, and he would have accomplished even more had he not died on September 22 1970 in his sleep of asphyxia. This box set is as close as we will ever get to the true Jimi and who he really was, and any real Jimi Hendrix fans will adore this. But keep in mind, there is still so much more Jimi to be heard.

0975991477|5.0|The Biology of Belief by Dr Bruce Lipton has changed the way many people will think about the so-called hereditary diseases, their lives till now being  \\"programmed\\" by Mom's and Dad's genes, not to mention aunt Bea's quirky behavior.  In a word - he is a revolutionary of our scientific era.  Moreover, as a scientist, he elegantly abstains from making spiritual statements or, God forbid - religious indications of what his discoveries might mean for believers in higher powers, in God, Jesus or any other spiritual teacher for that matter.    However, he does say:    \\"In the end, these cellular insights serve to emphasize the wisdom of spiritual teachers throughout the ages.\\"    Dr Lipton is not only a researcher par excellence, but he is wisely reluctant to enter the field of spiritual answers and \\"how-to\\" in his writings.  This is not a job of science, no matter how much he rocks its precepts and how much of his own scientific career he risks and how many of his colleagues might wish to call him a delightful genial half-wit . . . marginalized malcontent . . . or an underclass dropout for making these revolutionary statements in his book.    By not telling one how to unleash the \\"powers\\" available - he offers those who know where to find the answers an opportunity to do their part.  So, here is one.    For millennia the Great White Brotherhood of the Ascended Masters has offered such spiritual teachings.  Confucius, Buddha, Jesus, Apollonius of Tiana, Lao Tze, Hilarion, Saint Germain, to name a few, explain and prove by example the science of self-healing and true control over one's four lower bodies (etheric, mental, emotional and physical), as well as freely offer opportunities for spiritual attainment here and now - in the physical body, while on the path of discipleship anticipating ascension at the end of the road that leads to this ultimate victory over \\"sin, disease and death.\\"    I highly recommend these older than the world teachings.  Try practicing the welltested and researched techniques, over the centuries of their application with results, presented by these alchemists of the spirit.  Beware, though - there are no shortcuts to this level of attainment, just as there are no shortcuts in Dr Lipton's research - if his partial findings took him 15 years - allow yourself to be patient - be positive, believe that one is able to get there, for it is a path of many incarnations to eventually wave a hand as Jesus did and heal the leper or raise Lazarus from  the dead or even himself on Bethany Hill.    Do not worry about \\"scientific reviews\\" of Dr Lipton's book telling you that it is all new age nonsense and pseudo-scientific clap-trap.  After all - Giordano Bruno's and Galileo's beliefs were considered nonsensical in their time.  Aren't we grateful that burning at stake has become out-dated and is not fashionable any more?    Thank God for America, for freedom of speech and thought and for Men of Integrity like Lipton!    This book will rock your world!  then - you will feel right at home on earth.    May You Win All the Way!    Eva Victoria Tame  [...]

Kenny (I think it's Kenny) says \\"We spent the last few months getting high while doing this record\\", and I replied saying \\"We can tell\\". The first actual song, \\"Love You To Death\\", is my favorite song on this album. It has \\"classic\\" written all over it. Peter's vocals are amazing as ever! I love his falsetto screch at around 5:45. Other great songs here are \\"Haunted\\", \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\", and \\"Cinanmon Girl\\" (also in CG, listen to it around 0:09 to hear something strange...).

B000002NHN|5.0|I purchased this CD, \\"The Book of Secrets\\", after being told that the music was quite similar to Enya's (and I am a big Enya fan).  At the time, I wasn't sure that anyone could compare to Enya's angelic & soothing voice, so I was ready for a disappointment.  Boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />Loreena's voice, although distinctly different from Enya's, is absolutely beautiful!  I was hooked from the first time I listened to it.<br /><br />I am drawn to the beauty of celtic music, and if you are too, this CD is definately a great choice!  I just noticed that it is no longer for sale at Amazon.com (maybe it'll come back), but I must say that it's worth searching for a used copy - it's that good.

B00000G3AZ|5.0|Emma is a movie that has stood up to repeated viewings.  Although it does not remain entirely faithful to Jane Austen's novel (Paltrow seems much nicer than Austen would have intended, and the language is a bit more relaxed), it is an enjoyable take on the classic novel.  I am a fan of period films such as this one, and I also really like Austen's writing, so this was right up my alley.  It's just a fun, light-hearted romance.  The actors seem to fit well into their roles and the movie comes off quite nicely.  I highly recommend it.
B000002LUB|3.0|After six years of revolving door line-ups and often half-baked efforts, Tony Iommi reunits with the Mob Rules version of Sabbath.  Actually, the idea to reform came from Geezer Butler and RJD after playing a Dio gig together in Minneapolis in 1991.  Tenuous as this reformation may sound, the results are quite good and satisfying.  Gone is the watered down hard rock and money motivated ballads of TYR, replaced by the bone crunching riffs and down-tuned bass playing that recalls the classic albums of yesteryear.  But the production is the difference here, giving a modern feel to all that sounds comfortable and familiar yet brand new all at the same time.   <br /> <br />The best tracks are the heavies, such as \\"After All (The Dead)\\", <br />\\"Sins of the Father,\\" \\"I\\" and \\"Buried Alive\\" along with the sort-of ballad \\"Too Late!\\"  I get the feeling that either Geezer was responsible for writing most of the lyrics or that Iommi and Butler asked Dio to take a different angle, because they sound little like anything Dio has penned prior.  Most themes deal with real life and the darker side of humanity, not dungeons/dragons and rainbows.  This is generally to good effect, as the gothic imagery of Dio's solo albums had been tirelessly reworked by the time Lock Up the Wolves was released.   <br /> <br />Nothing overly impresses on Dehumanizer, it's just a solid piece of work from a reunion of seasoned, highly talented veterans.  They have all stepped it up for the 90s, leaving the hairband riffs and cheesey drum fills behind.  It would have been nice to see more experimentation on Dehumanizer, maybe an instrumental or more guitar/bass interplay like on Mob Rules.  This is more of a collection of songs, along the lines of Heaven & Hell (albeit to lesser effect) than concept albums like TYR.  As it turns out - Dehumanizer is just another interesting side note in the long Sabbath history.  By late '92, Dio was gone again to reform his own band.  Iommi and Butler would solider on bringing Tony Martin back to the fold with the classy Cross Purposes in '94.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Wow! I bought the soundtrack on a whim and having heard it, I had to have the DVD, too. And was all jittery 'till it arrived. <br />I popped it into my player and... remained speechless through the end titles. <br /> <br />I adore Gerard Butler as the Phantom (and yes, I do have the original cats recording with Brightman and Crawford). Unlike Crawford, Gerry Butler is perfect for the Phantom. Dark, sexy, tender, loving, passionate, obsessed... oooh, baby. It made me wonder why in all the blazes Christine chose Raoul. <br />And his voice has that nice rough sound to it, but can be so tender at times (Point of no Return - God, I wish someone would sing it to me like that). What he lacked in training, he compensated by knowing how to act, which can't be said for the original cast (they just seemed wooden). <br />Emmy Rossum was perfect for the role of Christine. Young, vulnerable, sweet, round eyed... and a nice voice (perfect contrast to the roughness of Butler's) - 180 from Brightman... <br /> <br />Anyway, I ADORE this movie (and I'm so thankful to have bought the CD, if not I would have never heard this movie was made - they didn't show it in my country) and have been watching it constantly over this weekend... and crying like a baby whenever Phantom sings \\"Christine, I love you\\". [snif, snif] <br />This DVD has become my new best friend.
630522885X|5.0|Max Ophlus' s masterpiece is a true straight forward step in the cinematographic language, daring and betting against all the odds, in this extraordinary, genial and unrepeatable film that belongs to the Pantheon of the greatest movies ever filmed in the Cinema Story.<br /><br />When Wagner established the concept of Total Art, he proposed to integrate all the artistic disciplines. Ophlus in minor measure did the same with this admirable portrait, though the ravishing illumination, the amazing edition work, overwhelming locations subordinated to pay tribute to that strong female character, who broke the laws and bet hard with the conventionalism of those times. She lived intensely, and lived several lives in just one.<br /><br />And she, despite of having been the most scandalous woman  in the world, makes her last appearance in a dangerous act, which is by itself an ironic device; if you think it over the Circus' charm resides precisely it is a like a matrix, that brings up back to our childhood. Lola Montes represents the  love and liberty without hindrance, epitomizing free willed, free spirited and brave woman who stands in defiance of social rules; a  passionate and hot lover, but also a very smart and sensitive human being.<br /><br />Like all of Ophlus' women, Lola exists in a world of impermanence, or transition. You must be thinking in George Sand, her audacious behavior and constant scandals. \\"For me the life is movement\\", and that is why Ophlus's camera is in constant motion, simply following accurately her way of life and uncertainties in her existence.<br /><br />Max Ophlus is not only considered as the cinema master of the mobile camera, but also the screen's ornamentalist placing his women. And his previous films such La Ronde, Le plaisir, and the Earings of Madame de.. are a must for any true cinema lover.<br />Just to name some notable directors influenced by the spell of this unequal master we could remark Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Douglas Sirk and Eric Rohmer. Three genius of three different countries who understood the huge importance and transcendence of this colossus artist.<br /><br />Max Ophlus died in 1957, two years after the European release of Lola. And I have not any drop of fear stating I have seen this film at least a dozen times.<br /><br />A true giant masterpiece!ree different countries who understood the huge importance and transcendence of this colossus artist.

B000063DFQ|5.0|These guys must have had so much energy to keep putting out quality metal.  Here we have the most popular Maiden lineup of Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Dave Murray (guitar), Adrian Smith (guitar), Steve Harris (bass), and Nicko McBrain (drums).  Nicko is the newest addition here, coming from the french band Trust.  This album also stands out because of the production.  Songs like 'Flight of Icarus' and 'To Tame a Land' have an epic nature about them that is brought out by the professionalism of the recording.  For example, when you hear the line \\"When the sun breaks above the clouds/an old man stands on a hill,\\" you can actually picture this environment in your mind.  I feel like the three Maiden albums before this one were more on the 'raw' side while this recording sounds like a little more time and money were put into it. <br /> <br />My favorite song on this release is 'Die With Your Boots On' - I like it for it's heavy nature and catchy chorus.  It is also a fan favorite at live shows.  Another great tune is 'Still Life' which has a catchy guitar harmony up until the first solo which is right on the money.  It's truly an air-guitar classic! <br /> <br />The more popular songs here are 'Where Eagles Dare' (which is based off a movie), 'Flight of Icarus,' 'Revelations,' and 'The Trooper,' the last of which is the most famous, and take it from a guitarist - It's fun to play.  I remember the video for this song; it was full of clips from old black and white cowboy and indian movies. <br /> <br />I agree with another reviewer that 'Quest For Fire' is the only bad song here.  Once you hear the line, \\"At a time when dinosaurs walked the earth...,\\" you know it's going to be corny.  My friends and I used to joke that the song is probably about someone who was searching for a lighter or matches in the middle of a nicotine fit!    <br /> <br />When an individual like myself gives just about every maiden album *5* stars, it is difficult to recommend one over the other.  Thatshould tell you that this is a consistent band when it comes to putting out quality music.  With that said, you should definitely own this album, as well as most of the other stuff in this band's catalogue.  I can't say which album to get before or after this one...just make sure you own it! <br />
B0007N1AI6|4.0|Angel of Retribution is Priest's do or die album; it gave them an opportunity to prove their long-standing \\"Metal\\" as godfathers of the genre or to be shot down in flames.  Fortunately, it turned out to be the former, as AOR seers almost entirely from start to finish.  Opener \\"Judas Rising\\" is similar to the opening minutes of Sad Wings of Destiny, which I'm sure is the very intention.  After the quiet, moody opening minute, the song blasts into full-out Painkilleresque metal. <br /> <br /> At many points throughout AOR Priest seem to be reaching back into their catalouge, bringing the best attributes from each era together on one disc.  From here, \\"Deal with the Devil\\" is a straight-forward riff rocker which reminds me of \\"Riding On The Wind\\" from Screaming for Vengence.  As stated in many reviews before, \\"Revolution\\" generously borrows the riff from Deep Purple's Stormbringer and updates it for a modern, yet classic sounding gem.  It's the best song on the record, particularly the closing minutes where Rob rants in his patented high-pitched schriek over a chugging rhythm. <br /> <br />A couple of songs, also mentioned in previous reviews, sound as if they were recorded off the Painkiller sessions.  Both \\"Demonizer\\" and \\"Hellrider\\" (song titles evoking the same themes as Painkiller as well) both kick ass as turbo charged double-bass drums thrash about over some of Downing and Tipton's most energized playing in years. These songs aren't especially inspiring, but they do serve as the obligitory heavy anchors of this release. <br /> <br />\\"Angel\\" and \\"Eulogy\\" are the ballads, \\"Eulogy,\\" which resembles quieter moments on albums such as \\"Sin after Sin\\" and \\"Stained Class\\" (even laying reference to the later's album title) serves as more of a intro to the monstrous (pun intended) epic \\"Loch Ness.\\"  \\"Angel\\" is more of a typical Priest ballad in the vein of \\"Fever\\" or \\"Night Comes Down\\" and features some of Halford's best, most understated singing.   <br /> <br />\\"Lochness\\" deserves a short review of its own.  At 13 1/2 minutes, its the longest in the entire Priest catalouge.  It's slow and thick, barely moving in some spots, which I guess is exactly how we'd invision this mythical beast.  Sometimes ridiculous, sometimes over-the-top, other times actually chill inducing, the song is too ambitious for its own good.  There's no doubt that Rob knew he was going to take some serious criticism for writing a song about centuries old mythology, much like something Rainbow would have written back in the Dio years.  But, let's give them some credit for stepping out of the ring and attempting something this collalsal, even if not entirely successful. <br /> <br />Overall, AOR is a very welcome addition to the Priest repetiore.  It stands considerably better than the material recorded with Ripper Owens and could serve as a fitting final chapter in their now 4-decade old career.  Side note: the bonus DVD on the \\"Special edition disc\\" doesn't really add much; the live material has all been seen in similar formats dozens of times before. The band interviews are interwoven between the live footage, and everyone seems oddly somber and reflective.  Of course, Rob doing most of the talking as usual.  I'd stick to the regular disc and save yourself the five or so bucks.
B00000DC10|4.0|It's always hard to describe what punk bands sound like, but this is an amazing album.  More artsy than their earlier stuff, and the album title is pompous as hell, but they pull it off with style.  They have a real talent for songwriting.  If you listened to this for the first time and knew something about the intelligent (can't think of a better word) punk sound of recent years, you'd think the refused were pulling together good things about a whole slew of other familiar bands and just refining them.  But then you look at the date and realize it came out before those bands had even formed. <br />It's like the songs were written to be a mix of black metal and bebop, and then given to a punk band to play. <br />If you're going for a little less artsy, get songs to fan the flames of discontent.  That's more riff driven than melody driven, and more pounding than dynamic.

B000063COX|5.0|These are the roots of Iron Maiden...sure, there's no Bruce Dickinson here but Paul DiAnno was still a great singer; he just didn't have the range that Bruce has.  I know many fans who are turned off by this album because Bruce isn't on it.  I whole-heartedly disagree because here we have some major classics like 'Running Free,' 'Prowler,' 'Sanctuary,' 'Iron Maiden,' 'Remember Tomorrow,' and 'Phantom of the Opera.'  All of these songs can be found on one or more Iron Maiden live albums and 'Iron Maiden' is performed as the encore at just about every Maiden concert.  These facts cannot be overlooked! <br /> <br />If you like this album, I also recommend A REAL DEAD ONE which has Bruce doing a lot of these older songs.  You also get a rare live version of 'Transylvania' on it that puts this version to shame! <br /> <br />These are simple hard rock songs, for the most part, with some good harmonies and guitar solos.  The brainchild of this band, Steve Harris, had already developed most of the 'Maiden sound' that we hear today when this album was originally released.  I would also say the styles of the songs are inconsistent within this album.  I think this is great.  We hear wah pedals used on 'Prowler' which is the only Maiden song I can think of that uses them.  We have 'Remember Tomorrow' which is full of time changes and modulations...almost borderline progressive.   <br /> <br />The only songs I don't care for much on here are 'Strange World' and 'Charlotte the Harlot,' the latter of which is a rare Dave Murray original.  This would be Chapter 1 of a four part story about this hooker named Charlotte.  Chapter 2 is '22 Acacia Avenue' from NUMBER OF THE BEAT.  Chapter 3 is 'Hooks in You' off NO PRAYER FOR THE DYING, and Chapter 4 is 'From Here to Eternity' from FEAR OF THE DARK.  These other songs are great, but I think Dave Murray should stick to soloing and not to writing songs! <br /> <br />You also get a much more raw sound that you only really hear on the firstthree Maiden albums.  Like I said, DiAnno is great...he still has a nice range, and these songs cannot be overlooked, so pick this up if you plan on calling yourself an Iron Maiden fan.

B000021Y77|5.0|I saw this German movie almost two years ago. However, I can remember this movie clearly, because it really impressed me. It is very philosophical and also exciting movie. Moreover, it is only 80 minutes movie, but I assure you will be fluttered through the entire movie.  <br />To sum up this movie simply, heroine Lola have to arrange a hundred thousand dollars in order to save her boy-friend Monni and she manage to arrange it. Monni had to deliver a bag with 100 thousand dollars to the boss of the gangster, but he left it to a train and a homeless man took it away. If they fail to deliver the money, he is likely to be killed by the gangster... From the beginning, as title goes, she is running and running.  <br />The movie is made of three short scenarios. They are slightly different with each other at the beginning, but the difference become larger and larger as the scenario proceeds.  So the scenarios end up very differently at the end. The style of the movie is fresh and its basic concept is nice. Smaller changes become bigger changes. It is not so special when we see it as words, but I think you will be surprised by this concept in the movie. To people who dissatisfy with the movie of just acrobatic action and seek for philosophical implication, I recommend this movie!
0783117523|5.0|this is my all time favorite movie. i love everything about it. i think angelina jolie did an AMAZING job playing Gia. it really shows her acting abilities in this movie. she was dramatic, funny, romantic, emotional, and a very strong character. My favorite part is the ending where she is walking in the hospital with the sheet around her and you hear angelina reading from gia's journals...its amazing. everyone should see this movie atleast once. i've probably seen it atleast a thousand times.
0975991477|5.0|The biology of belief, until now, has been more based on positive thinking than scientific discovery.  This book has taken this to a new level.  People's ability to function, to perform, to experience is highly based on their belief system.  I think this book will open great doors for those who have previously had issues with confidence and self-consciousness.  Another book I just read called The System by Roy Valentine is also an excellent resource, especially for men.  I recommend both book very highly.
B0006ZE7G2|5.0|If you are a fan of this film, as I am, please note that this release is an exact duplicate of the last DVD release but with new packaging.  The documentaries are worth the price of the disc alone, as they are excellent.  A great transfer of a great film.    As a side note to \\"Der Kommissar\\", the last I heard, we have freedom of speech in this country.  So, I am mentioning your \\"review\\" in my own and there is nothing you can do about it.  I could care less if you are a \\"top reviewer\\" or not - never presume to tell me what I can or can't do again.  Who the hell do you think you are?
0671027344|5.0|I loved this book!  Although my experiences were not quite the same as Charlies in 10th grade, the similarities were exceptionally familair.  Stephen Chbosky gave me the most articulate desription of an adolescence that I can remember from 25 years ago next to my own personal journals.  it was a gentle nudge to recall feelings and thoughts too hauntingly distant.  I so rarely do this...but I may need to read it again.  I originally bought this book for my 14 year old nephew, but I'm not so sure he'll \\"get it\\".  Charlie's POV is too rich with wisdom and insight only a seasoned human can savor.  Perhaps for his 20th year of life, hopefully by then he will have had such experiences which this book will trigger an affectionate reminiscence for.
B000002JSN|5.0|This is zeppelins most unlike theirselves moment in their carreer. Almost every song is an experimental, and the album for the first time in zeppelins carreer contains some filler, but hey all great double disc albums contain some filler (The Wall, The White Album).On this album Zeppelin are at their progressive rock peak with songs like Kashmir, In My Time Of Dieing and Ten Years Gone. Here what I think of the songs.    Disc 1  1.Custard Pie (4/5)-cool bassline, good opener  2.The Rover (4/5)- a great hendrix like riff  3.In My Time Of Dieing (4.5/5)-a great experimental slide guitar song  4.Houses Of The Holy (5/5)-One of the few non experimental songs on the album, and a great one at that  5.Trampled Underfoot (4.5/5)-A great riff, featuring John Paul Jones jamming alongside with Jimmy Page on keyboards  6.Kashmir (4.5/5)- The product of Plants trip to india, a good song but it gets too boring after 4 or 5 minutes.    Disc 2  1.In The Light (4/5)-Another Kashmir like eastern trip out song, and a good one at that.  2.Bron-Yr-Aur (3.5/5)- A good acoustic folk instumental  3.Down By The Seaside (3/5)-an experimental country song, an okay song  4.Ten Years Gone (4.5/5)- A great progressive rock song, Jimmy Pages opening and main riff is classic, the solo is great too  5.Night Flight (3/5)- It starts off good but after awhile just gets repetitive  6.Wanton Song (4/5)- A great song, Robert Plant sounds so different on this song  7.Boogie With Song (3/5)- An experimental 50's styled rock and roll song  8.Black Country Woman (3/5)-a strange folk song, kinda annoying  9.Sick Again (2/5)-A weird experimental song, total filler    I wouldnt recommend anyone buy this album without listening to it first because lots of people wont get it at first.    If You Liked This Album youll probably also like:  The Beatles- The White Album  Aerosmith- Toys In The Attic  Rush-Bastille Day  Rush-A Farewell To Kings
B000003TA4|5.0|Does anyone really need to write reviews about this album? I mean, we are really just expressing our love and gratitude for this work of art that will always be in our lives. Every song is a hand-crafted masterpiece. There is so much passion. Kurt's voice is just a ball of raw emotion. Thank god he gave us this gift before he died. Everyone should own this album, whether or not you like alternative music. This is way deeper than a particular genre. This is someone sharing their soul that happens to be accompanied with musical instruments. A must have for the lover of raw, real emotion at its finest. There will never be another Nevermind.
B00030590I|3.0|Basically, I think the graphic, plot, and theme all work fine and those who enjoy plays should be able to enjoy this movie as well (at least, I do). A major part of the movie, i think, is devoted to delineating and discovering of perspectives (narratives, you might say) related to the proper fate of China proper. In the end, a supposedly supported perspectives is revealed and the death of some characters might represent the painful but necessary abdication/self-annihilation for a better future. Even if there can be a better future, it necessarily involves an excruciating self-negating process. Something passionate, tender, free or even righteous must be given up. I'm not sure if every character and plot fits into this major theme very well because some do seem a little bit distracting, but still entertaining (nothing really needs to make sense as long as you like it). <br />Some might think the implied theme of reunification is a serious problem. I wouldn't totally agree with it for the reason the emperor wants to unify China and three characters give up assasinating him is for the longer peace of China. \\"If you want peace, prepare for war.\\" This is from Punisher, but it explains the logic well. However, I seriously doubt that the director made this movie to condemn Chinese nationalism, though I don't know if any trace of anti-cosmopolitanism is obvious in it. <br />Anyway, graphic is cool, plot acceptable, theme...a little bit cliche, and, because the theme cliche, the use of multiple narrative might seem childlish and rather less challenging. But for those who really have no idea about Chinese history during the end of Chou dynasty and the present situation between the strait, it might be interesting. That is why I gave it three stars. If I have know zero about China, I might give it four and a half.
B000002HPT|5.0|1997's FALLING INTO INFINITY has long been denigrated by fans as Dream Theater's weakest album, primarily because it moves away from the progressive excesses of past efforts.  What's ironic, though, is that this album contains some of their tightest songwriting.  It occasionally feels like an unusually rich commercial rock or metal album, but at other times it's Dream Theater through and through. <br /> <br />I personally prefer this album to those released after it, simply because Dream Theater's later albums (including the highly overrated SCENES FROM A MEMORY) grow more self indulgent and lose some of the eclectic variety that brings forth such a constantly diverse and intriguing experience in albums like this one and IMAGES & WORDS. <br /> <br />Some noteworthy songs on this album include \\"Peruvian Skies\\", \\"Hollow Years\\", \\"Hell's Kitchen\\", and \\"Trial of Tears\\".  The first is indeed one of my favorite Dream Theater songs, which is surprising given the apparent simplicity of its progression. <br /> <br />This is a good example of the fact that Dream Theater's technical showmanship is definitely more subdued here, but it makes for a more accessible and repeatable listening experience, without losing the intelligence that sets Dream Theater apart from commercial bands you might hear on the radio. <br /> <br />Because it cuts out much of the over-excessive soloing and self-indulgence found in later albums, I consider FALLING INTO INFINITY to be one of Dream Theater's strongest, and an excellent one to start out with if you're new to the band.  Give it a look with an open mind, and you won't be disappointed.
B000002J09|5.0|This is one of the greatest Rock albums of the 70's right up their with Pink Floyds Dark Side Of The Moon and The Who's Who's Next. This album deserves to be and usually is on every top 50 list of the greatest Rock albums ever. Led Zeppelin 4 is more than your typical generic sex and drugs rock and roll album, its also has some timeless folk pieces (The Battle Of Evermore, Going To California) some great experimentals (When The Levee Breaks, Four Sticks) some classic rockers (Black Dog, Rock And Roll) and of course Led Zeppelin 4 has one of the most famous songs of all time (Stairway To Heaven).Heres What I think of the songs.    1.Black Dog (5/5)-Classic song, one of Jimmy Pages best riffs  2.Rock And Roll (5/5)-A heavy metal rock and roll song  3.The Battle Of Evermore (4/5)-An acoustic hippie like folk song, yet another zeppelin song about The Lord Of The Rings    4.Stairway To Heaven (5/5)- I dont think its like the greatest song in the world and like its probably what they play at the gates of heaven like all the posers do but its still a great song.  5.Misty Mountain Hop (4.5/5)- Catchy guitar/keyboard riff  6.Four Sticks (3/5)-Experimental trip out song, I try too like it but it gets boring  7.Going To California (4/5)-An acoustic folk love song, great melody great lyrics, good song  8.When The Levee Breaks (5/5)-One of zeppelins weirdest songs, the harmonica makes the song    If you like classic rock or harder rock this is a must have. If you like folk music check this out you might like it. If youre expecting the regular old bluesy Led Zeppelin dont buy this album before listening to it because they didnt play so much blues on this one.    If You liked this album youll probably also like:  The Who-Who's Next  Deep Purple-Fireball  Lynyrd Skynyrd-Smokes
B0000508U6|5.0|Wow. I love this album. I like it better than their second. There seems to be more of an honest passion here. They were very young when they wrote this album, and I am impressed with their insite, and the song's melodies. Chris, though a bit nasily, has a listenable voice. I heard clips of their 3rd album, and it sounds like Clocks part 2. I just really love parachutes, and I am amazed at the people who have a rush of blood to the head, but don't have this one. Parachutes is just mellow and nice. Every song is really good. Ironically, \\"yellow\\" was there most popular song, and probably my least favorite. So, for those of you who are new to Coldplay, or just have a Rush of Blood To The Head, you are in for a treat!
B0002OERI0|4.0|OK, I was a little hesitant on this one based on some reviews.  But, I think this one is a winner.   <br /> <br />I really like a band who is willing to make a statement.  The upbeat sound of American Idiot and Whatername have such an 80's beat - kind of like the Kinks.  An call me crazy but I found Extraordinary Girl to sound a bit Beatles-ish. <br />
B00005JM0B|3.0|As a person sits down with their popcorn and soda to watch a movie...that person is prepared to utilize a principle of storytelling, this principle being \\"suspension of disbelief.\\"  It's used mainly to explain the unexplainable.  However, this suspension of disbelief doesn't work real well, when the individual viewing the movie remembers the main character looking a bit younger the last time around.  Ah-nold...is back as The Terminator...a little older...perhaps even a little wiser.  This movie is very average...The scripting is horrible, Arnold's lines that are made to make you laugh are kinda silly, and unlike the other Terminator movies...it doesn't scare you that much.  The effects are fun, but unfortunately do not carry the movie.  This goes up from a 2 to 3 star rating only because the basis of plot was a good idea to continue the series (considering virtually no one was on board except Arnold).  But 3 stars at best because it was not carried through that well.
B000002J0B|5.0|Houses of the holy is Zeppelins first album were they completely stopped playing blues and got into more progressive Rock music. But dont worry Houses Of The Holy still has youre typical zeppelin rockers (Dancing Days, The Ocean), youre folk tunes (Over The Hills And Far Away) youre experimental tracks (Song Remains The Same, No Quarter) and this time around even some experiments with funk (The Crunge) and Reggae music(Dy'er Mak'er). Heres what I think of the songs.    1.The Song Remains The Same (4.5/5)- Its kinda unfocused and all over the place but still a great song  2.The Rain Song (4/5)-A love song accompanied by acoustic guitar and an orchestra  3.Over The Hills And Far Away (5/5)-A folk rock song, great acoustic intro breaking in to one of Zeppelins best riffs  4.The Crunge (3.5/5)-A strange Funk song, sounds like something by James Brown   5.Dancing Days (5/5)-One Of my favorite zeppelin songs, the highlight of the album  6.Dy'er Mak'er (4.5/5)-A reggae like love song  7.No Quarter (5/5)-Another strange experimental track done by synthesizers to give that eerie synth effect  8.The Ocean (4/5)-It is the only song on the album that sounds like the old Zeppelin    If you like this album you might also like:  The Who-Quadrophrenia  David Bowie-The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust And The Spiders From Mars  Uriah Heep-Demons And Wizards  Deep Purple-Stormbringer

B000060OFT|5.0|Luhrmann's film is a modernised and very effective remake of the original Zeffirelli film.  The story of Romeo and Juliet, written by William Shakespeare, has now been shunted into a whole new dimension.  The original story is a thoroughly depressing tragedy, where two people from opposing families fall in love.  They get married in secret but after Romeo kills Juliet's cousin for stabbing his best friend.  He flees and Juliet's father tries to force her to marry another person she has hardly even talked to.  However to avoid this she fakes her death by drinking a sleeping potion.  Romeo comes back to find her `dead', and kills himself.  She wakes up, finds him dead next to her and stabs herself.  The grim reaper has his hands full with this one. <br /> <br />This film illustrates this story effectively, although to bring it into a modern setting, some clever changes have had to be made.  The beginning chorus is now narrated by a newsreader which I feel was a flash of inspiration as it is a brilliant way round having to have a narrator and sets the scene to the style of the film.  Some of the characters also have been updated to fit with the modern setting.  The Prince is now Chief Prince who is the sheriff of the city.  Also the two families are equally successful businesses with equal tower offices with equally huge signs with their respective names on the top.  All of these changes however help to make the film considerably more plausible in a modern setting. <br /> <br />Some very clever camera angles and shots are used to create a western style showdown, at a downtown petrol station.  Guns, of course, are switched from swords in the updating process, meaning that fight scenes would be a lot shorter if it weren't for Luhrmann's imagination.  Clever close-ups show the guns actually have names that would have been given to swords, an interesting bit of comedy to fit the story line.  Of course the show-off gun spinning and throwing goes with the western showdown, but fast camera shots give the whole sequence incredible speed.  This also adds a little comic effect, if it doesn't make you dizzy!  The sequence also has excellent background sound that really contributes to the pace and style of it.  The Zeffirelli edition had shockingly dressed people prancing around in psychedelic tights, poking each other with pathetic swords, whereas this version is infinitely more polished and acceptable to a modern audience.  Thankfully Zeffirelli's dreadful costumes have been dropped in place of even brighter Hawaiian shirts and gun holsters.  This fight soon turns into a full city riot thanks to the petrol station getting torched.   <br /> <br />After a few sweeping skyline shots showing the urban landscape of the city and the towers, the film presentation turns into a news item about the incident showing Chief Prince swooping down in his chopper and saving the day.  Then both heads-of-house are given a dressing down by Chief Prince.  However this seems to have one fatal flaw.  The Chief warns them `on pain of death' which seems unrealistic, as the death penalty these days is saved for only the worst criminals, not squabbling families.  Also he would need to go through months of legal proceedings.  Zeffirelli gives the Prince a lot more authority in his version as the camera is pointing up to him on his horse from below.  However, Luhrmann loses this effect by pointing the camera straight at him on the level with him sat down at a desk.  Zeffirelli must have chosen the heaviest horse for the Prince he could find for this sequence because when it moves, the sound of its hooves drowns out the Prince.  All you need is it to be sufficiently ugly and the ground to shake and Godzilla's back in town <br /> <br />Later in the film we come to the famous balcony scene, of which through most the balcony is nowhere to be seen as the swimming pool seems to have been cast for that part instead.  Romeo abandons his party of drugged up and drunk friends and proceeds to break in to the Capulet mansion which, given their status, has surprisingly low security.  He arrives in the pool area and hears the door opening.  Leaping on to the trellis next to it in a tacky suit of armour from the party, making a ridiculous amount of noise, he manages to stay out of sight of Juliet as she comes out.  She then starts to talk to herself as per the first sign of insanity.  Romeo eases his way off the trellis and follows her, behind her back about an inch away.  This is totally unbelievable as at that distance she would definitely know he was there.  Plus his head was practically resting on her shoulder.  I just hope for her sake he has not got bad breath.  When he speaks to her, she leaps out of her skin and grabs him, and the resulting scream and splash into the swimming pool is just sheer comedy.  The camera zooms out just in time to see both lovers plummet into the pool.  Then he does a bit of explaining as to why he was hiding there and they seem to get on fine thereafter.  To emphasize the urgency of the situation the camera switches between the two rapidly.  Then the nurse comes out and calls for Juliet, who rudely proceeds to drown Romeo until she goes away.  Not bad for a first date.  Zeffirelli just has the sound of the nurse calling whereas I feel seeing her is far more interesting and engaging.  Romeo then begs for a kiss and wanders off.  Zeffirelli does this sequence far better having Romeo running through the trees with the camera flying alongside him with the trees in zipping past in front of him, although everybody watching is wishing for a tree to take out either the camera or Romeo.  Surprisingly Luhrmann had Juliet in a fairly modest dress in this scene whereas Zeffirelli's was probably arrestably revealing at that time. <br /> <br />Luhrmann has done a brilliant job on this film updating it and presenting it to the modern audience.  The setting of the film is in an excellent location to portray the film, with scenes that fit with every aspect of the play.  He has used music in this play very well to compliment the scenes, whereas Zeffirelli's drowned out the characters and was just too distracting.  The only criticism of the play I have is that I find the language is harder to understand for a modern audience and so does not fit with the modern setting.  However if it was updated I am sure the play would be considerably shortened given Shakespeare's wonderful talent of fabricating the dialogue to a ridiculous extent.  Also it would ruin the character of the play and some of the effect would be lost.  The actors interact with each other very well in this film and show friendship and hate far better than Zeffirelli, who had Tybalt just aimlessly smiling at everybody for no apparent reason.  On the whole the film is a fabulous adaptation of one of Shakespeare's greatest plays <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah has truly bridged the gap with \\"The Emancipation of Mimi\\" and she takes you on a ride like none other. To put it blountly this album is full of hits. We Belong Together is one of her best songs ever, and songs like Joyride and Fly Like A Bird will make your jaw drop. Aside from the ballads uptempos like Say Something and Get Your Number will have you dancing.. As time passes this album along with her self entitled \\"Mariah Carey\\" album will be two of her biggest classics.. Mimi has already sold over 1 million copies in 4 weeks and is just getting started...Make no mistake that 15 years into an already stellar career Mariah makes you forget about the past and focus on the future.
B000005DQR|5.0|Think back to the year 1996. Before Radiohead was embraced as electronic rock geniuses, before the New York music explosion of 2002, even before Massive Attack became popular. Now listen to this album. It is extremely groundbreaking and paved the way for future artists to follow.<br /><br />DJ Shadow is an absolute genius. He was doing the trip-hop and using samples and slow repetitive melodies to create an amazing atmosphere before anyone. This album was at least 5 years ahead of it's time, before it was embraced by Radiohead for their album Kid A.<br /><br />The songs are just brilliant, with the slow groove of \\"Building Steam With A Grain Of Salt,\\" the slow jazz of \\"Changelings,\\" and the moody sounscape of \\"Stem/Long Stem.\\" This entire album was made using samples. There is hardly anything original on the album, yet DJ Shadow combines, cuts, pastes, and scratches these samples to make something completly new.<br /><br />If you're a fan of intelligent indie music, or trip-hop, this is for you. You won't be dissapointed.

B000002868|5.0|I have to agree with some of the other reviewers in stating that the best Weather Report recordings were during the Miroslav Vitous years. The debut album along with 'I Sing The Body Electric' are, for me, the best of the Weather Report recording efforts. After the passage of all these years (better than 30) I still find its sound to be bold and original. This is fusion where the emphasis leans towards the jazz side of the marriage. Perhaps because the fusion genre was so new and its core memebrs were fresh out of the master's (Miles Davis) house. What ever the reason its a great album and a 'must have'.
B00005JNTV|5.0|The nights are cloudy, the alleys are dark, the men are dangerous, bars are smoky and femmes are fatale. \\"Sin City\\" is a thing of dark, bloody beauty.<br /><br />It certainly says something if a graphic novel author helps out with a movie... especially if that creator swore he'd never let it be adapted. That is only one of the things that makes \\"Sin City,\\" the adaptation of Frank Miller's comic, such a fascinating film.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is actually made up of three stories: In the depths of Basin (Sin) City, scarred hulk Marv (Mickey Rourke) sleeps with a beautiful prostitute, Goldie (Jaime King), only to find her dead beside him the next morning. Enraged, he goes on a killing spree to find her murderer, and learns that sinister cannibal Kevin (Elijah Wood) is responsible. But there's a powerful figure behind Kevin, who calls the shots.<br /><br />Elsewhere in Sin City, Dwight (Clive Owen) does his best to defend Gail (Rosario Dawson) and the other Old Town prostitutes. But when Dwight kills a crooked cop, he has to somehow cover up the crime. And Hartigan (Bruce Willis), a cop with a failing heart, goes out of his job with a bang: He rescues little Nancy Callahan from a child molester who happens to be a senator's son. Hartigan is jailed, and when he gets out, he finds that Nancy (Jessica Alba) has grown into a lasso-twirling stripper. But the senator's son -- nicknamed Yellow Bastard -- is still after her.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is one of those few comic book adaptations that doesn't seem... well, cartoonish. Sure, it's the very image of noir, but the grim tone and grey characters are very real. It's not a movie for the fainthearted, but whoever enjoys the films of Quentin Tarantino (who directed one scene here) will surely be blown away.<br /><br />Like \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,\\" this film is done almost entirely digitally. But unlike \\"Sky Captain,\\" it has substance as well as style. All the sets and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white. Here and there we get a splash of colour -- red lipstick and matching dress, Yellow Bastard's face, green eyes.<br /><br />The contents of three \\"Sin City\\" comic books are interwoven here, and Rodriguez is constantly faithful: A lot of these shots could have been lifted straight from the comic's pages. He also preserves the stark, black-and-white style that the graphic novels are known for. You can't get much more faithful than that.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is not quite a \\"Kill Bill\\" bloodfest, though -- surprisingly, this brutal movie has a dark sense of chivalry. Each story is about an outcast man defending a woman's honor, safety, or memory, even if he sacrifices himself in the process. \\"Sin City\\" wears its heart on its sleeve, even if that sleeve is bloodstained and torn.<br /><br />Most of the actors do wonderful jobs -- Owen's dark photographer, Rourke's scarred strongman, Stahl's revolting Yellow Bastard, and Alba's surprisingly sweet stripper. Only a few, like Brittany Murphy, have lackluster performances. But perhaps the most memorable performances come from Bruce Willis and Elijah Wood. Willis plays his aging cop role with unusual grace, even when shooting the genitals off Yellow Bastard. And Wood plays Kevin with both creepy evil and spiritual ecstacy. All without saying a word.<br /><br />\\"Sin City\\" is a remarkable, bleak, intense movie -- a halfway point between Tarantino and Raymond Chandler. Outstanding.and props are done with computers, and nearly everything is in black and white.

B00005JMYI|5.0|If I watch a movie more then 3 times, I mark it down as a all time favorite. Anchorman is a movie I could watch over and over again. There are a lot of simple lines and humor that will be as everlasting as those in Dumb n Dumber, Happy Gilmore, Old School, Tommy Boy, etc... Lines like, \\"I'm gonna punch you in the ovary, that's what I'm gonna do. A straight shot. Right to the babymaker.\\" or \\"You have an absolutely breathtaking heinie. I mean, that thing is good. I want to be friends with it.\\"  <br /> <br />This movie was shot in a segmented style like that of a news program. It's kind of like a movie with many mini movies within. I like it that way because I can skip to my favorite parts. <br /> <br />I think this movie is great fun and very entertaining.
1592243754|5.0|Greed, gold-digging and deception sit at the heart of \\"Vanity Fair.\\" It's no joke that it's subtitled \\"a novel without a hero\\" -- William Makepeace Thackeray mercilessly skewered the pretentions and flaws of the upper class all throughout it. The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece..

0060090367|1.0|I found the main character and the story to be unbelievable.  There were also so many things that did not add up in the story.  On one page she had gone for her 6 month check- up after the baby was born and on the next pages she said she had the baby 8 weeks ago.  There were many more of these instances and it took away from the story.   Her husband's explanation as to leaving her was written very poorly. She never once woke up in the middle of the night to feed the baby.  It was almost as if the baby was an after thought.  The whole book was a big waste of time.  Rachel's Holiday was much better.
0812550706|4.0|I first read Ender's Game as a 7th grader when it first came out. I remember enjoying this book immensely and would not hesitate to hand a copy out to any youngster that I came across today. Now, as an adult I decided to listen to this book as I worked and was pleasantly surprised that I found it very enjoyable even at my advanced age. Ender's Game is obviously written for a younger crowd, but at the same time it is so well conceived that it will be enjoyable to all but the most jaded of readers.<br /><br />This book does not feel as spry as Rowling's Harry Potter books, but instead reflect the sparser writing of Phillip Pullman. If you have read either of these two authors and are looking for a book almost on par with these, I would recommend Ender's Game.<br /><br />Other books that might be of interest to you if you are looking to expand your sci-fi horizons would be Harry Harrison's first three 'Stainless Steel Rat' books, Robert Heinlein's pre-' Stranger in a Strange Land' books for a younger crowd (this would include the classic 'Puppet Masters,' or 'Starship Troopers') or Larry Nivin's short stories.<br /><br />For older readers I would recommend Philip K Dick's work including his complete short stories or 'Now Wait for Yesterday,' Neal Stephenson's 'Cryptomnicrom,' or on a fantasy note, the yet unresolved series of books by George R Martin.
B00006FDCJ|5.0|`Unforgiven' is an absolute masterpiece of film, and represents not only director and star Clint Eastwood's most mature work, but also the coming of age of the Western. It completely eliminates the simplex white hat/black hat, good guy/bad guy theme so common to Westerns. In its place, it gives us rich, fully drawn characters painted in the muddled shades of gray that characterize real life rather than the black and white of myth. And while it has abundant violence, it strips it of all of its glamour, and presents it as the stark horror that it is.<br /><br />The film deals extensively with the disconnect between what we are, and how we view ourselves. William Munny (Clint Eastwood), a bad man reformed by the love of his now deceased wife, is haunted by his past of cold blooded killing. Even as he takes on a final job of assassination to save his failing farm, he continually tells himself and everyone around him, \\"I ain't like that anymore.\\" His  companion, The Schofield Kid (Jaimz Woolvett), is young, dumb, and owns a gun, and is blustering and cocky about what a deadly killer he is until confronted with the actual deed. English Bob (Richard Harris) fancies himself a sophisticated, refined, gentleman shootist, but is soon revealed to be little more than a mannered bully and crude killer. Little Bill (Gene Hackman), sheriff of Big Whisky, believes himself to be a tough but fair enforcer of justice, and believes that he is different - more righteous, than the toughs that he confronts. Yet Little Bill harbors a deeply sadistic rage that can be deadly, and just as ugly as any outlaw's deeds. Finally, the working girls that contract to kill the offending cowboys see themselves only as seeking justice, and are blind to the fact that what they really want is not justice, but vengeance.<br /><br />`Unforgiven' reinvents how violence and killing are presented in Westerns. In the traditional Western, the villains are demonized to the extent that when they are killed by the heroes, we feel exhilaration and triumph, devoid of any of the inherent horror of the act. Not so in `Unforgiven', where each killing is felt like punch to the gut. When each character is shown in all their humanity rather than as a gross caricature, it is impossible for us to cheer their deaths. Eastwood's William Munny sums up the heart of the film when he says to the Schofield Kid, \\"When you kill a man, you rob him of everything that he has, and everything he's ever gonna have.\\" In a final shoot out scene, Munny ties together the themes of the gruesome nature of killing and our self deceit about our natures, when a man he is about to kill says to him, \\"I don't deserve this\\", and he replies, \\"We all deserve it,\\" as he dispatches him.<br /><br />`Unforgiven' stands as a landmark in the history of Western movies. Like John Ford's great film, `The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance', it explodes the myths and easy conventions of the genre, and presents us with complex moral questions rather than simple, pre-digested answers. It is well written, with brilliant performances, and beautiful cinematography - a masterpiece of its genre. If you are ready to see Westerns grow up, you must see this brilliant film.<br /><br />Theo Logosfeel exhilaration and triumph, devoid of any of the inherent horror of the act.

B0009KA7BS|4.0|I'm really baffled why everyone thinks this movie was quite so bad.  Keanu Reeves does a fine job of playing exactly what the character was.  There are some places where I would have liked to know a lot more.  My hope is that perhaps the dvd edition will include some deleted scenes or an ext version.  Its not a bad movie despite these odd reviews.  If you were expecting another matrix perhaps... /shrug
B00009V7P8|5.0|This album's simply unbelieveable. I can honestly say that i can find absolutely nothing to criticise, from his voice, his lyrics, the musical arrangements, nothing. I am involved in music as well, and i wish i had the talent that this man has. His lyrical capabilities reveals a certain cynicism and world-weariness that, coupled with the melodic arrangements on each song, reflects the genuineness of emotions that each song evokes within him and us, as writer and listener. Utterly brilliant. <br /> <br />'The Blower's Daughter' is just superb, it has to be my favourite track on 'O'. But that's not saying that the rest of Damien's songs are merely cannon fodder, far from it. Poignant, sarcastic, mellow, angry, satirical, this album has so many elements to it i've run out of words. 'Amie' is magnificent, whilst the Gregorian chanting on 'Cold Water' is a touch of class that i found refreshing.  <br /> <br />I won't bother to describe the rest of the songs, i'll leave it to you to find out for yourselves the brilliance that is Damien Rice's 'O'.

0451528956|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. At first it was very boring but after Stevenson introduced all the characters it began to be more interesting. This book has a lot of confusing events but you just have to stick with it until the end. Everything unravels at the end. I liked the mystery and the who done it kind of effect. I enjoy reading suspense type books such as this one. I beleive that some of the chracters in the book such as Utterson and Lanyon kind of suspect that they are the same person, but they just don't think that it could be possible. I think that they suspect it mainly because when Dr. Jekyll left his will and everything he has ever owned to Mr. Hyde it just didn't seem right. The way the crimes were commited were especially heinous during that period in time. I would recommend anyone who enjoys a suspenseful book to look into this one.
B000003WFB|5.0|Bach's work Matthaus Passion is an amazing piece of work and showcases some of the best classical music ever written. Being protestant Bachs music reminds me of going to mass and when the choir sings it is like being in Church. This production overseen by Jonathan Miller is simply put it stupendous and does justice to this incredible piece of music.  The book-let is very well done and has intresting tidbits about the reaction to the passion and the the singers and the conductor used for this grand recording.
B00005JN0T|5.0|My first reaction as this film began was \\"Wait!  This isn't Asimov.\\"  The Asimov I grew up reading was a weaver of ideas, more mind candy than adventure story.  But here I found myself in Will Smith's bedroom, and then suddenly catapulted into a wild chase after a purse grabbing robot.  A far cry from the delicacy used by Asimov.  It took a while for the shock to wear off but eventually the conflict between Smith's gritty performance as Del Spooner and his original inspiration in the reminiscences of Dr. Susan Calvin (played by Bridget Moynahan) wears off and the view settles into a film that is inspired by Asimov, but does not imitate him.<br /><br />The sooner that happens, the better, because this is an exceptional film in its own right, even if it does proceed with the speed of a video game.  Smith creates a wisecracking character with a deep mistrust of robots. He is called in to to investigate what appears to be an impossible killing - robots can't kill humans, it's the first law of robotics.  But Dr. Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) lies dead and the only suspect is 'Sonny' a Series 5 robot with some surprising circuitry (played by Alan Tudyk).<br /><br />The death is declared a suicide, but Spooner refuses to give in.  suddenly the automated world turns on the detective, whose unlikely ally is Dr. Calvin, a robopsychologist responsible for the psyches of masses of robots about to be distributed around the planet.  One hair-raising escape after another propels the story along until viewers find themselves at a surprisingly reflective conclusion.  Not exactly classical Asimov, but a great story nonetheless.<br /><br />Will does a good job as Spooner, but he is upstaged by Moynihan's performance.  And both are blown away by Tudyk and the animators performance as Sonny.  As you watch Sonny develop from being slightly more simpatico than the scenery into a full-blown personality there are countless moments of surprise.  Moynihan and Smith do their best, but from the moment Sonny turns to Spooner and says \\"Thank you... you said someone not something.\\" The film belongs to the robots.<br /><br />Excellent animation and CGI create a world that is a retro version of the future - perhaps exactly what Asimov imagined rather than what we would now.  The result is a compelling mix of the outr&eacute; and the mundane that sticks in the mind just as Sonny's wink does.<br /><br />This is not just an action film.  Threaded through it are the same questions that Asimov raised about the nature of self and intelligence.  Robots may never be human, but there are far more than furniture.  And if their thought processes are alien, they are more than the sum of their programming.  The result is one of the more carefully thought out science fiction films in recent times.from the moment Sonny turns to Spooner and says \\"Thank you... you said someone not something.\\" The film belongs to the robots. <br /> <br />Excellent animation and CGI create a world that is a retro version of the future - perhaps exactly what Asimov imagined rather than what we would now.

B0007X6ST2|5.0|It's a big job being Gordon Sumner. I'm not sure I have the hat size for it, but coming off a meteoric rise to fame with the Police, Sting had something to prove and was determined to show he was the creative genius in that band. Outdoing Stewart Copeland's move into avant-rock and world music, Der Stingle opted for a jazz-rck approach and put together a group of young lions who wanted to free themselves from the straight jacket of Wynton Marsalis. <br />So, with Branford Marsalis and Kenny Kirkland holding down the band, this tour rightly became the stuff of legend. The Police in concert were amphetamine fueled thrash ska that bore precious little resemblance to the studio band. Cleansing himself, Sting got back in the groove, re-discovered what an amazing bassist he was in his own write and worked his band through an incredible set list. I dare say that after the Soul Cages or the Dreaming Sea, Sting was never quite this good. Certainly after the death of his parents, his CDs were a mish-mosh of genius, and ideas that went terribly wrong in mid-air. He had more focus earlier on. His head hadn't outgrown his eyes. <br />In any case, both Marsalis and the late Kirkland are so incredible throughout this disc, it almost passes for one of their own CDs with Sting as vocalist. I'd highly recommend this disc for two very sound musical reasons: <br />1. It's just incredibly hot and passionate musicking <br />2. It will p*ss off Wynton to the point where he can't see straight.
0743487478|3.0|I bought this book after hearing the author on NPR. While I agree that time-outs, rewards, and punishments may be overused these days, I had trouble ferreting out what exactly he proposed as their alternatives. The book is more about his parenting philosophies and about criticising other parenting books than about giving practical advice to parents. There is little advice and few real-life examples.<br /><br />Two things I found upsetting about the book: one, his assertion that \\"other\\" parenting books would recommend that you deny your child their bedtime cuddling routine after a tantrum. I would like to know WHAT book he is referring to, because neither my Mommy friends nor I could recall ever hearing such advice. Secondly, he says that if a mother refers to herself in the third person (\\"let Mommy help you\\") when the child is old enough to understand the pronouns \\"me\\" or \\"I\\", that the mother is distancing herself from her child. Nonsense! I refer to myself as \\"Mommy\\" all the time, it's a title I'm proud to use exclusively when speaking with my daughter, and I am quite certain that I am not distancing myself from her by referring to myself as Mommy, subconsciously or otherwise.
B00020X88O|3.0|i seen the film before and didn't think it was worth buying, but then i read about how this set is pretty much designed for getting drunk, so i figured there must be an entirely other dimension to the movie that is only apparent when intoxicated.  Isn't that kinda sad?  Its as if the studio felt bad for you for buying the dvd, so they figured they'd help you get drunk in return with the shot glasses and drinking games. <br /> <br />Its worth it just for the party supplies.  People will see your \\"Showgirls\\" shot glasses and you can say \\"Yeah.  I actually own those.\\"

This movie won a permanent home in my VCR back then, and I watched it every night before bed, to prepare myself for the horrors of the next day in cubicle hell.  Thankfully, I no longer work there, but this movie has not lost it's luster with me, and anytime I encounter someone who has not seen this gem yet, I insist they sit down immediately so I can put it on for them.  They always end up loving it.

Except this little girl is the first daughter and is experiencing everything for the first time from falling in love to playing the arcade games at the carnival, to living with a college room mate. Everything isn't as it seems for Sam (Katie Holmes) and with her new found freedom comes a couple mokey wrenches along the way. Marc Blucas as James, Sam's love interest was right on, and Mia's character was good as well even if a little over the top when it regards reality. Overall, a good movie for romantics, and all young girls! Fantastic soundtrack as well, and great dancing scenes too!

I listened to some of the originals (mainly the tracks with re-recorded vocals [Take No Prisoners, Five Magics, and Poison Was the Cure]).  To be honest with you, I thought the originals sounded like garbage compared to the remastered.  Especially for Five Magics, Dave's voice is heard way better on the remastered and a lot clearer than the original.  In my opinion, I think Dave did us a favor by re-recording the vocals for those tracks.  I guess it's up to you if you want the original one or this one.  Lot of people are saying the original is way better, but I disagree.  Just keep in mind that this remaster sounds a lot clearer, and is polished.

B0000TLA9G|5.0|These guys f*ckin rock.  They can write a power ballad too.  I don't see anything negative or any big lows on this album.  It has every great memorable GNR song (maybe a little too many for AFD), but an all together awesome compilation.
B00005JNTZ|5.0|This is the only thing I was looking forward to see every week on TV. Excellent writing with main story going across all the episodes and sub-stories that get resolved at the end of each episode. Veronica Mars is a 17 years old daughter of a private investigator, a former sheriff. She's helping him with his cases, has her own to solve and she's decided to find out who killed her best friend Lilly Kane. Almost all the answers get answered by the end of the season. Excellent acting from all the actors. I cannot praise highly enough Kristen Bell as Veronica Mars and Jason Dohring as Logan Echolls. Highly recommended!
B000002H97|4.0|Metallica sure did make a dramatic change in sound on this one, however, it was pretty damn good.  James really stepped up on his songwriting here, showing pure emotion in every single song.  So maybe it isn't has fast as KEA, or as heavy as RTL, or as thrashy as MOP, but it's still a damn good piece of work.  Melodic heavy metal is what this is and it sounds good.  It't not your average Metallica, but it is Metallica.
0142004235|5.0|<br />Standing in front of monsterous shelves at Border's, staring at my summer reading list with 600 pages of Steinbeck in my hands, I think: \\"My teacher is trying to kill me.\\" That was two years ago. <br /> <br />If I could pin down any one reason or instance that transformed me from the proverbial couch potato to avid reader, this epic novel would be it. <br /> <br />Steinbeck's East of Eden is absolutely spacktastuler (yes, so good, I just had to fabricate a word for it).  The novel, set in the early 20th century, follows the story of the Trask family.  A parallel to the biblical story of Cain and Abel, the conflicts between members of the family in two generations serve to explore the nature of good and evil and mankind's tendencies toward each.  Steinbeck is able to envoke deep-seeded, universal questions while stunning the reader with a playful subtleness. <br /> <br />Perhaps most defined is the developement of character.  The reader cannot help but fall in love (or undying disgust)with each of Steinbeck's masterfully crafted personas.    <br /> <br />The book is long - 600 pages in four parts - but every bit the worth and more.  The ending, not to be spoiled, even served to leave a beading tear in the eye of this hopeless \\"tough guy.\\" <br /> <br />Truly a masterpiece of modern times.

B0002DB0FO|3.0|The WB has yet, again conjured up another dramatic-teen show and have basically not changed the premise of its characters or production at all. I'm not afraid to admit that I did watch this show for a while and did like it only because of its \\"hook-liner\\" premise: A family oriented television show concerning a man, Dr. Andrew Brown (Treat Williams undoubtedly is easier to look at when he's got hair on his face), who has lost his wife and deals with the difficulties he goes though trying to reconnect with his Son, Ephram, an overly emotional teenage boy who seeks his old home in New York after moving to Everwood and blames his father for his mother's death, and his daughter Delia who doesn't appear to have any qualms about moving except when concerning her new school. But as the show progressed it began to turn to be just like all the other teendramas on WB54; The brooding teenage boy meets the 'The girl every-guy wants, with a dark past' young blonde girl (daughter of a Doctor who becomes rivals with Ephram's father, who reminds me of \\"Squidward\\" of Sponge-bob square-pants) and eventually develops feelings for her later on in the show, everyone in high-school has to be \\"together/couple\\" when in reality its not like that all, the dramas concerning the young girl Delia is mediocore but its believable, and the teenagers, (who are, naturally about as wise as a undeveloped tomato) always ends up correcting the Parents on everything instead of the other way around.     The only real change is the more focus on the adults and their troubles. At least it was before the \\"O.C\\" and \\"One-Tree Hill\\" Reared their ugly heads. Teenagers who are into the heavy-drama type shows will enjoy \\"Everwood\\". It wasn't exactly what I was looking for, sadly.------- [a 3 out of 5]
B000929AJQ|5.0|What makes this album so good? You have the most creative individual in the music industry returning after a 5 year hiatus teamed up with the most brilliant individual in the  business (Dave Grohl)working to create a sheer work of art. This is the album the NIN fans will love and newcomers will get hooked into. The songs are a true culmination of all of Trent's past work. 'Only' is surly the best track because it brings back the new wave sound of Pretty Hate Machine. The rest of the tracks...a huge pleasure to enjoy. This album has the potential to be the best of the year and who knows...maybe even a grammy?
B00008LDPU|3.0|<br />Everyone who isn't a mad-mad \\"MAXTRIX\\" fan knows that the two movies of 2003: \\"Reloaded\\" and \\"Revolutions\\" were just ways to scrounge up more money because I qoute I heard one the producers that work with the two brothers who made up this movie series, they made the two movies and Animatrix because \\"they knew the first one made money, and there was doubt in their minds that these follow ups were going to do the same.\\" In short: the didn't care about a plot, character development, or anything else that makes a movie worth looking at over two times. And Considering that I'm no fan of the Matrix, I had no particular reason to believe that this assortment of cartoons done in the animatrix was any better than Reloaded and Revolutions. I had enough dignity to swallow my pride and rent this DVD, since my hunches aren't always right.  <br /> <br /> <br />To make a long story short only three out eight the movies on the animatrix DVD are worth watching and those were: \\"The final flight of the Oirsis\\" (an explanation to what Niobe was talking about in the game enter the maxtrix, using the animation from the final fantasy movie), \\"Beyond\\", and \\"A detective story\\", mostly because they go more hand-in-hand with the Matrix than the others.  <br /> <br /> <br />While the second renaissance explained what happened to the humans and how they became under the grasp of the machines it really just felt lame and really didn't reveal anything no one already knew about. The rest, kid's story, world Record, matriculated, and program are a hodgepodge of cartoons that really didn't feel as though it had anything to with Matrix, just a bunch of fillers for the DVD.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The art in the cartoons range from semi-good to absolute bad (take Kid's story, the second renaissance and World Record for example), and the stories are sometimes too flaky to take seriously (The second Renaissance, Matriculated, and Program).  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The content is a basis ofblood, gore, adult language, disturbing scenes and sexual content and situations making me wonder why this wasn't labled with a \\"R\\" rating. Because we all know Anime is all about blood gore, violence, sexual content, and disturbing images (nods head); YEAH RIGHT and my name is Linsdey Lohan, the smoker with bad skin.  <br /> <br /> <br />The special features on the disk are commentary from the directors on several of the movies, a documentary on the history of anime that's not really informative and shamelessly promotes old Anime like \\"Grave of firelies\\" \\"Akira\\", \\"Ghost in a shell\\", and \\"Astro boy.\\" They even had the nerve to go and call Japan Post-Apocalyptic because they were hit with the nuclar bomb in WWII, when in truth they're not. There's also an enter the Matrix trailer but that game sucked so badly I'm not even sure why they put it on the DVD aside from shameless promotion of their Maxtrix Products.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />All in all, by far the best movie on here is \\"the final flight of the Oiris,\\" [despite its corny dialogue] while the others which are basically moderate to watch are poorly executed plans in a motion picture format.------ [A 3 out of 5.]
B000063DGC|5.0|although i really love this album,from the day it came out, there is another recording that is better! its a bootleg,but somehow i doubt it! from montreal in july of 81.if you have ever wondered what it would be like to stand on stage during one of these shows then you need to go to ebay and find this bootleg!to hear all the band including the keybord player for the first time is a real treat! randy and keyboard playing of each other is something you dont hear on tribute, i guess they brought randy up in the mixing and dropped of the bass and keyboard!also to hear rudy and randy playing off each other is something special! the two grew up playing together and you can tell on this bootleg!you can even here tommy (drums) when he misses a high hat or looses a stick! this is why its hard for me to buy into this as an amature recording!go get this 81 copy grab some good headphones lay back close your eyes and you will be transformed back into time and right on stage with these guys! tribute is a great album but 81 bootleg is just alot of fun, like a show is meant to be! hear randy mix up his rhythm sections and hear these songs for the first time again!!!! july 28 1981 thanks randy!
0451528956|3.0|Dr.  Jekyll  and Mr.  Hyde  is a  very  mysterious  novel.  It  shows how people can have a good and  a   evil  side. Stevenson is a  extremely good  writer. He  knew that  this  book  was  going to  his  big  break. I  would  recommend this  books   to people  who  enjoy  short  and mysterious  novels.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have not been much of a fan of opera or musicals, but surprisingly enough, I thought this was the best movie I have ever seen. The characters were well casted and the storyline of the movie was kept pretty accurately to the actual opera play.  <br /> <br />I recommend that everybody should see this movie at least once. It is well worth the whole twenty dollars or any other reasonable DVD amount.
B00008DDSC|3.0|S&M can add some spice to life, but there's more than that going on here. Ridiculous as it was, the film kept me glued to the screen right up until the anti-climatic conclusion. To what degree is Secretary proclaiming itself as reality? If a film is surreal, then one does not necessarily try to make sense of it (to discern the intentions of the screenwriter, for example), and may instead choose to just view it in the abstract. If Secretary is not a surreal film, then we are running into some problems here.<br /><br />I could (but won't) echo some of the sentiments shared by reviewers who rated it at 4 or 5 stars. Overall, I'm on the fence about Secretary. Throughout the entire film I was trying to decide whether the protagonist [Lee] was becoming fulfilled, or whether her victimization was simply being prolonged (in a cage with golden bars). Do you condone a man who exploits a mentally ill woman because he has the status and means to get away with it? Well, that's exactly what goes on for the duration of Secretary, regardless of how much Lee smiles or masturbates when she thinks about her s#!thead boss. Whatever your opinion of S&M, keep in mind that Lee is more than a simple masochist. I'm far from an expert in the field, but my education included classes in psychology (including Abnormal Psychology), and I don't take the issue of mental illness lightly. While I'm not one to reinforce what is dictated to us as a mentally healthy lifestyle, I nonetheless find Secretary to be the opposite of liberating.<br /><br />Yet even as I despised the main male character in the film (indeed, most of the characters are easy to despise, other than Lee), it challenged me to view him from Lee's perspective. Whatever your take, Secretary provides a challenge for the viewer: if that's what you want out a film, then go for it.
0451528956|4.0|I read Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in my senior literature class.  It was a very interesting book.  It is truely a mystery because you never know what will happen next.  I would reccomend others to read this novel because it is an unusual story.  The whole time you think one thing will happen but the outcome is totally opposite from what is expected.  It is truely a good book and everyone should read it if they get the chance.
B00006AUIG|3.0|Don't get me wrong. This movie is not bad. The problem is, it's not really bad-ass either. This is all very strange because it has all the ingredients it needs. Great actors, good story & great scenography. The environments cash in most points for this movie. Very \\"Silent Hill\\" minus the monsters. Just take a look at the front of the DVD case and you'll understand. So what is wrong with it? The first thing is the pacing of the movie. For the first hour, you're not sure if this is a horror movie or a drama. It seems more like a story of five worker class men and their personal problems. They all have their quirks like fear of the dark, domestic problems, depression and so on. That feeling of \\"there probably are no ghosts in this house\\" surfaces after an hour of sighing and back streching. Just their personal demons, so to speak - which aren't very scary. You feel more sorry for the bastars than being scared for them. Over time, however the situation deteriorates as they start loosing it one by one. So why am I not scared yet? Because it's all just sooo predictable. Sure there are hints of a supernatural, evil presence in the dark halls, but there just had to be, right? Otherwise this WOULD be drama/mystery. They should have went for the asian horror approach. Where tight budgets force film makers to rely on storytelling and simple camera ingenuety to create that heavy tension that you can almost cut through with a knife. Not from of what you've seen, but from what you know. \\"Session 9\\" is definitely a step in the right direction from all those sucky slasher movies, but dispite all that budget it's still no match for asian horror like the \\"Ringu\\" trilogy, \\"Juon\\", \\"Dark Waters\\" and \\"The Eye\\". If you're All American and can't stand subtitles and foreighn laguages, I suggest you watch \\"The Ring\\" (am. remake of jap. \\"Ringu\\") and/or \\"The Mothman Prophecies\\". Unlike Session 9, these movies make it all the way.
B0007GAERG|5.0|so she had a nervous break down...at least she didn't ruin that amazing voice like Cracky Houston did!  This album is beyond great and well worth the 4 year wait!!!
6302641888|2.0|I fell asleep four times trying to watch this enigmatic masterpiece. The only thing that could have wrapped this mess up would have been a car crash killing the two leads. Instead, at the end, what we get is this flash of a movie crew to further frustrate the totally disinterested and removed viewer. What was that all about? I would have rewound the tape, but was tired and ready for this project to come to an end. How can so many people like this?! What about a story for crying out loud?! The most interesting scene is when Bibi Andersson freaks out and repeatedly slaps Liv Ullman in the face. It's kind of over-the-top--something you'd see in a Saturday Night Live skit. And please, no comments about how I'm missing the meaning, the poetry, the depth. First spark my interest, move me in some way, and then we'll discuss depth. In a word, BORING.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|\\"The Early Days\\" is a 2 DVD set that is ideal for major Iron Maiden fans; if you are a devotee of Maiden, you will not be disappointed, and if you are a fan of the New Wave of British Heavy Metal in general, these DVDs capture the golden age of that metal phenomenon.<br /><br />Disc 1 features 3 different concerts, the first feature Paul Di'Anno on vocals, the other two with Bruce Dickinson. The footage is presented as best it can, from oringal sources from the 80's, so the quality does not match \\"Rock in Rio\\" of course, but is still well-preserved. It was great to see Paul Di'Anno in concert, something I've never seen live or in video until I viewed these DVDs, and Bruce's performances stand out from his earliest days in the band. Especially interesting for me was the performance of \\"Revelations\\", a great song I've not heard live before, and also it features the only time I've seen Bruce play guitar.<br /><br />Disc 2 features a 90-minute new documentary that delves deep into the origin and history of the band. In the first years there were many line-up changes, and many original band members are included in the eye-opening interviews. Steve Harris's drive and determination and legendary bass-playing innovation are evident throughout the interviews. You will learn about the early venues and performances of Maiden, the powerful egos in the band, and the transition from pub acts to world tours.<br /><br />The \\"20th Century Box\\" segment on DVD 2 is an episode of the topical British Television programme that investigates the NWOBHM and focuses on Maiden. However, the television show is quite odd, with a strange artsy introduction and exit that is quite funny IMHO and feels like it's from the 1960's, and aside from Maiden, the show investigates a strange British phenomenon of cardboard guitars used by kids to emulate the hard-rocking stage acts of metal bands.<br /><br />Maiden fans will find lots of footage worth watching and will be pleased by the detail and care put into the transfers of concert footage and the production of the interviews. Some of it may be overkill for the casual fan; the greatest enjoyment will be for the dedicated Maiden fan, but the music and classic tale of hard working musicians make this a great value at the Amazon price.into the transfers of concert footage and the production of the interviews.

B0007XT87G|5.0|Being a huge fan of Porcupine Tree, Opeth, and King Crimson, this album was very easy for me to get into.  Porcupine Tree has some of my favorite vocal harmonies.  This album is filled with them, BUT there is a wonderful surprise in some.  An easily audible Mikael Aekerfeldt(Opeth) appears in a few harmonies.  You don't have to listen very hard to distinguish his voice.  I was very impressed with how Steve Wilson harmonized with Mike Aekerfeldt on Opeth's \\"Damnation,\\" but perhaps even more impressed with how Aekerfeldt harmonizes with all of Porcupine Tree.  Aside from Mike's vocal work, you can also hear beatiful solos from Wilson, of course, along with Aekerfeldt AND Adrian Belew (King Crimson).  This is also the heaviest PT album to date.  Obviously, Steve Wilson has been spending a lot of time with Opeth.  The entire album is amazing.  Track 5 is probably my current favorite track.  Buy this album.  You will not regret it.
B000002KHH|5.0|This is the first Black Sabbath CD I bought, and I wasn't disappointed. It's great. Overall a great addition to your collection. The songs are original, great lyrics, amazing vocals by Ozzy. <br /> <br />War Pigs (8/10) - a great way to start the CD. Although a bit slower in some parts, the lyrics are great. The guitar solos are amazing. <br /> <br />Paranoid (10/10) - best song from the album. Does not have any bad parts. Maybe even Sabbath's best song. Although its a bit short, its great. <br /> <br />Planet Caravan (7/10) - although a bit slower and weaker than the rest from the album, it'll grow on you. It's not bad. <br /> <br />Iron Man (10/10) - another masterpiece.  <br /> <br />Electric Funeral (10/10) - wow. This has been my favorite song for a long time. The lyrics are FANTASTIC. (robot minds of robot slaves, lead them to atomic graves). a perfect song. <br /> <br />Hand of Doom (7/10) - bit too long, with boring parts, but the guitar and drums are great. Ozzy didn't do such a great job with the vocals, though. <br /> <br />Rat Salad (6/10) - the weakest song from the album, but it's not bad. <br /> <br />Fairies Wear Boots - (7/10) - not bad, not too good.  <br /> <br />I love this CD. If you are a fan of heavy metal or Ozzy get this. If you are just starting on Black Sabbath, this is DEFINATELY the CD to get. You will not be disappointed.
B0000C9V3T|5.0|From the opening somber melody of Bang Bang to the closing Flower of Carnage Kill Bill Vol. 1 is a terrific CD that will be totally worth your buy. the mood of the film is captured so perfectly in this ensemble of artists. if you see the film after listening to the soundtrack you will be saying to yourself \\"wow this totally fits in, it sets the mood\\" <br /> <br />nancy sinatras bang bang is so quiet yet so pwerful and resounding. charlie feathers Johnny Cash attitude in the next track gives off a cool vibe.  <br /> <br />along with the songs there are so many instrumental pieces which sound so beautiful. the final lost sheperd is a flute piece that is astounding in how musically rich it is. and battle without honor or humanity has a perfect track to remember the film by with the sames fast and slow paces the films have.  <br /> <br />these are but a few descritions of the CD you have to listen to it a couple of times first to fully appreciate.  there are songs you will remember but realize you love and there will be songs you never heard before which you will never want to stop playing <br /> <br />a specific genre for this CD can't be found because no word describes the richness or diversity this soundtrack has. for a different sound of music buy this cd. you will not regret it

0743544676|2.0|I have listened about 1/2 way through this audio book and am amazed at the advice it gives. The main thesis is to give a guy zero chances--that he should chase after you, period. If he forgets to call, or something like that, it's all over. It also suggests only dating \\"the one\\" who will marry you, whoever that is.    I am a guy, and yes there is some truth to what the authors are presenting. But there has to be some middle-ground. Honestly, if I am with some woman, no matter how wonderful she is--if she starts talking about marriage before the salad arrives I'm outta there. They have a name for women like that: whackos.    This book is good on comedic value. It's like \\"Sex in the City\\" on audio. As far as a worthwhile dating and relationships text, I believe it only paints a false hope to women, who, in my opinion, should be out DATING men and seeing where things go, rather than MARRYING FIRST, then dating.    In my opinion this book presents a totally backwards viewpoint, in which the female puts up incredibly high barriers, and will only consider men worthy of dating if they are \\"the one\\". If you choose to follow this advice, good luck. You'll probably spend a lonely existence.. unless you get lucky.    Please give us guys a break and just date, have fun, and see where things go.    Update: I have finished listening to the book, and it does seem to even out its' tone. Essentially the authors could have summarized the entire work in just one chapter, rather than rehashing it 50 different ways.  That being said, I still believe the best approach is a moderate one; Be yourself, do what you love, and it will be okay. Yes watch out for the A-holes, both male and female. But that's just life--right?    Update2: Marie Forleo - \\"Make every man want You\\". That's the book to read.
0393324818|3.0|I prefer fiction, but when given this book that revolves around my love of baseball and youth's rooting interest, the Oakland A's, I had to take it in.  It's a fascinating read.  I am particularly appreciative of the A's attitude to 'think outside the box.'  I came away with a new positive outlook about a few people, player Scott Hatteberg high on that list, and not much respect for others.  Billy Beane's approach works, but I surely wouldn't want to work for such a volatile human being.  It will be interesting to see how Beane's disciples do in Toronto and Los Angeles.  The latter is new, but the former has been going without success for several years.  Many of the young players discussed in the books have just begun making it to the major leagues at this writing (spring, 2005) so that is another aspect to watch, how well everyone's plans and drafts work out.  The tension between innovation - divergent thinking, and conventional wisdom managed to strike a bothersome chord in me.  Philosophically, both are equally appealing to me.  In some places, my profession most prominently, I find that innovation by outsiders tends to be counterproductive, if anything.  In baseball, there's clearly room for it, but I think only to a limited degree.  If Beane's way became the norm, and more than a dozen teams were trying it, the dilution of Moneyball-appealing talent would be damaging to the teams and games, and those teams thinking outside Beane's box would get the productive, more conventional players, probably for less than they could now.  Beane's hit upon a divergent way that works on its small scale, but I suspect only there.  I'm glad I read it.  It was unsettling to my mind in some ways, something I appreciate.  Great, it's not.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Porcupine Tree has adapted the \\"hard\\" core of its sound -- crafty, somber alt-rock with great vocal harmonies and narcotic atmospheres -- very well to its heavier fix. The last album _In Absentia_ was outstanding, and _Deadwing_ follows up strongly. As always, there is a measure of balance: \\"Lazarus\\", with its lyrical pianos and tasteful string & choir mellotrons, is one of the most beautiful songs in their repertoire yet; the band's most flesh-hungry, heavy riff in the middle section of the 12-minute \\"Arriving Somewhere But Not Here\\" and Adrian Belew's (from King Crimson) gruesome solo on the title track tend to cut into the band's softer demeanor with sharper angles. The album does not seem to progress beyond the band's previous output -- it instead seems to fuse _Lightbulb Sun_ with _In Absentia_. Yet, while not anywhere near surprising as was _In Absentia_, the band's musicality and Wilson's craftsmanship (in song and production) are of the highest caliber in the rock world. Definitely get it!
0613325419|4.0|By \\"Newt Samander\\"  (aka J.K. Rowling), it is otensibly, Harry Potter's textbook, a compendium of the non- human or -wizard species one might run across.  For Harry's fans in need of a between-edition fix, this is a work for the charity Comic Relief.  The entries vary from the familiar fairies and ghouls and unicorns to creatures I can't help wondering if Rowling's fertile imagination contrived: froopers and lobalugs and mackled malaclaws.  Fortunately,the text notes each critter's Ministy of Magic Classification from one X (boring) to five X (known wizard killer) so studious types will know whether to worry about a Chizpurfle (XX) more or a Quintaped (XXXXX) more, should one encounter such.  Included are sophomoric doodles by both Harry and Ron Weasley.  Silly fun.  Great characters, no plot!

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|This DVD saves lives, so it says on the front cover. Nearly every other DVD you might buy in your local music store or supermarket is designed just to entertain you for a while. Then the movie or show finishes, and then that's it, until you play it again...  But not this one!! <br /> <br />The idea of Live Aid  as an international fundraising concert therefore has significance in that the usually-passive, one-way entertainment contract (you pay the ticket price, you sit/ stand/watch/get entertained, then you leave: end of story) has been changed so that you are now an active participant in effecting real change somewhere in the world. Sir Bob Geldof, the outspoken, noble Irish rock singer, conceived the project in 1984-85 as a pragmatic way to put a Band Aid on the gaping wounds being suffered by the population of East Africa as a combination of drought and debt claimed over a million lives.  <br /> <br />So many people in the rich parts of the world were horrified and maybe shamed into action that the charity single Do They Know It's Christmas? , released in Britain in December 1984, raised a total of over 8 million UK pounds. The money was used to buy grain and food oil, as well as set up a supply route to ship this aid from Europe to the stricken lands of Ethiopia and Sudan. <br /> <br />I bought my copy of this record for A$2.99 just before Christmas that year. I was nearly 15, and it was the first music record I ever bought. So it was nice to see the video, included here on this package, with a sort of \\"Class Of '84\\" of UK pop & rock musicians singing along to the Feed The World slogan. The USA did a similar thing soon after when a whole host of the most high-profile American musical stars performed We Are The World - one of the biggest hits of the decade. The video of this is on here too! <br /> <br />But the real interest is with the live concerts, which were staged on July 13th, 1985. Of course, there were two shows: one in London's Wembley Stadium, and theother at an open-air venue in Philadelphia. With the time delay, the UK concert started first. An amazing 8 or 9 hours of live rock followed. Looking back on it 20 years later, the performances are fantastic, even more so when you consider the haste the show was put together with, the potential clashing of star egos, the logistic difficulties, and the fact that no-one, anywhere had tried such an event before.  <br /> <br />The UK hightlights for me: <br /> <br />U2 - Bono of U2 is just the best frontman ever in rock. No one else makes such a direct connection wiith their audience. He jumped off the stage and danced with a fan! The strident urgency of their messages was a cut above nearly everyone else. <br /> <br />Queen - Their performance was electrifying and 100% engaging. Every single audience member contributed to the spectacle with upraised hands. The best British rock band, they had the incomparable talents of Freddie Mercury on vocals. <br /> <br />Boomtown Rats - Previously known here in Australia mainly  for the chilling but classic 1979 #1 hit single I Don't Like Mondays, Sir Bob commands centre stage. It was his idea, his day, and his glory. He conducts the Band Aid finale to the UK show too. <br /> <br />David Bowie - His 1978 song Heroes seemed very much to refer here to these Heroes of popular entertainment whose talents had been amassed here to such an effect.  <br /> <br />Dire Straits & Sting - Dire Straits were brilliant live. Sting joined them on Money For Nothing. This bit of the show was extra good. <br /> <br />Elton John - The Rocket Man is one of the biggest benefactors in the entertainment world. No other piano showman could possibly have been asked to play Wembley. He is terrific, and does a nice double act with the youngest Live Aid performer -  George Michael - on Don't Let The Sun Go Down On Me. <br /> <br />Paul Young & Alison Moyet - Two singers who may be less familiar to modern audiences (though very popular in 1985) team well on the great old Marvin Gaye tune That's The Way Love Is. <br /> <br />The US highlights for me: <br /> <br />The Beach Boys - They got things rolling at the US concert and did a flawless version of Good Vibrations that had just the desired effect on the summer's day crowd at JFK Stadium. <br /> <br />Crosby, Stills & Nash - Teach Your Children is one of my all-time favourite songs, and it was delightful to hear this tune performed acoustically by CSN at the front of the stage (as the organisers were changing the stage equipment behind the curtain) <br /> <br />REO Speedwagon - Although not a major fan of this band, I really like their two performances here - the exciting rock n' roll of Roll With The Changes and their recent US #1 hit tune Can't Fight This Feeling. <br /> <br />Phil Collins - Enjoying his best-ever run of popularity, good-guy drummer Phil boarded the now-defunct Concorde supersonic jet and dashed from Wembley to JFK to appear at BOTH shows on the same day!  <br /> <br />Patti LaBelle - The most dynamic singer seen at Live Aid, this powerhouse US soul performer was unforgettable, and wrung every ounce of emotion out of her 20 minutes on stage.  <br />  <br />Teddy Pendergrass with Ashford & Simpson - A truly beautiful moment not seen for 20 years was found in an archive and dusted off just in time to be included here. Soulful US singer Teddy, making his first public appearance since being paralysed in an auto crash, sings the inspirational Motown number about friendship :  Reach Out And Touch. <br /> <br />I can't find fault with this concert repackage. I know some might be upset about certain tracks not being included, but what is here is historic and magical, and should be owned by all fans of pop and rock music.  <br /> <br />And just when the last strains of the USA For Africa ensemble singing We Are The World have faded, there is an essential 1985 documentary : Food And Trucks And Rock 'N Roll that shows the horror of the famine, the valour of the charities and the global reach of the campaign to aid the victims.  <br /> <br />AND IN 2005 IT IS STILL HAPPENING AND WE SHOULD ALL KEEP TRYING TO HELP . BUY THIS VIDEO AND FEED THE WORLD!  <br /> <br />Peace. <br /> <br />Jeremy <br />
B00005JNVS|4.0|This movie is a joke - in a good way.  It wasn't meant to be a serious kung fu movie and if that is what you are expecting, you will be dissapointed.  If you enjoy a lot of humor with some good fight sequences woven in, you'll probably like this too.  The film is subtitled.  The stoy is there, works, and carries through (i.e. it's not just a bunch of slap stick tied together).   <br />Let your hair down, kick back, and get ready for a few laughs with this very good foreign film.
0792843584|5.0|There is just no beating around the bush when people mention Michael Cimino's 1980 film, \\"Heaven's Gate.\\" You either love it or hate it...there is only black and white when discussing this film. Having just seen the reconstructed director's cut, I will follow that trend and state: \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is a superior film.<br />I first saw the butchered, approximately 2+ hours version in the theaters several years ago and had to agree that it was pretty bad: incoherent, of course... badly edited...in both sight and sound. At the time it reminded me of those badly made European productions in which every actor is speaking a different language and after the fact, the film is dubbed into Italian or French. The film was literally a mess.<br />In its glorious 3-½-hours+ state, though, \\"HG\\" is a pleasure to behold. It is a grand saga dealing with greed, the loss of innocence and how money corrupts...to name a few issues it tackles. It's scope is on the grand scale of such films as Luchino Visconti's \\"The Leopard,\\" Sergio Leone's \\"Once Upon a Time in America\\" and Bernardo Bertolucci's \\"1900.\\" What makes these films special, thoughtful and important though is that they all tell their stories from the personal perspective of individuals: and \\"Heaven's Gate\\" does this as well...in the person of Jim Averill (Kris Kristofferson).<br />The film is gorgeous to behold (Vilmos Zsigmond was the photographer) but one big scene bears mentioning: the scene shot in the huge dance hall (actually called Heaven's Gate) in which the entire town is in attendance, everyone roller-skating to fiddle music, several cameras swirling around with the crowd...so involving, so dynamic as to take your breath away. On the other side of the coin the scene with Ella (a young, fresh-faced Isabelle Huppert) and Nate Champion (a rouged and mascara'd, Christopher Walken) in Nate's digs couldn't be sweeter: innocent and personal...Nate brushing off bread crumbs and straightening Ella's place setting on the table, Ella, nervous and jittery...is unforgettable.<br />All of the acting is first-rate but Walken, I think steals the movie with his quirky portrayal of a somewhat fey, yet obnoxiously macho, Nate. In one particular scene, Nate senses that Jim is back in town and tells Ella: \\"I can feel when he is around.\\" In another scene, Nate sneaks into Jim's room and watches a sleeping Jim with, for want of a better word, Desire in his eyes. Nate also picks up and rubs Jim's boot lovingly: interesting, distinctive stuff especially in the context of this great big, masculine film.<br />Isabelle Huppert is also a standout as a Madam, torn between her love for both Jim and Nate and as such is the catalyst for the jealousy and fire in the scenes between Walken and Kristofferson.<br />At the very least, this version of \\"Heaven's Gate\\" will stand the test of time as a personal and loving statement to a period in America when we began to lose our way and our innocence to boot. At the very most, this version will survive as a testament to how wrong a lot of people can be about a film's worth and importance. If you are a fan of American Films, you owe it to yourself to check out this beautiful, resonant, complex and resoundingly heartfelt movie.and jittery...is unforgettable.

B00005JMAH|2.0|'Prisoner of Azkaban' is, in some ways, a vast improvement over the Chris Columbus-led Potter adventures. For one thing, it feels like a real FILM, as opposed to a book report! But that brings me to my complaints. The movie is just too dark. Some people think \\"dark\\" equals \\"good\\" by default, but it doesn't. That tone isn't appropriate for Harry's third year. A lot of groundwork for future novels/films is laid in this outing, but really nothing terribly \\"dark\\" happens in the book. This tone would perfectly fit a film version of 'Order of the Phoenix' -- number five in the series -- but here it seems forced and out of place. Moreover (and as someone else mentioned) fairly crucial plot details are dropped in the adaptation from book to screen. Consequently the Marauder's Map and the Patronus Charm feels like contrivances to resolve the A and B-plots rather than crucial links to Harry's family and heritage. I live for the day when Warner Bros. hires a competent screenwriter to adapt the Potter franchise. As it stands, the damage is done and the sad fact is that it would've taken just fifteen seconds of screen time to clear up these details. <br /> <br />But hey, at least it's \\"dark\\"!!!!! :(
B000002OX7|5.0|The who along with led zeppelin and the rolling stones all created hard rock and set the bar for bands in the future(black sabbath?) This cd also showed how \\"progressive\\"(not the actual genrea) they were. Who could of thought that a whole cd filled with synths would do so good? Anyway the music,songwriting and the lyrics are all superb, moons drumming also seems to have hit it's peak, and even john entwistle seems to have advanced his playing...(of course daltry and townshend are great as ever)  <br />Even if you don't like hard rock GET THIS CD!...and also to stevie B goode's post down here,there are four great british rock bands =the beatles,led zep,the who, aned pink floyd.....
B00000612P|5.0|EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY is Rod Stewart's best album ever, displaying in full flower his roots in the Memphis-Chicago-Texas-St. Louis-Muscle Shoals- Detroit-New Orleans-Kansas City blues/rock & roll/R&B axis, country & western, and American and British Isles folk musics. The title track and \\"Maggie May\\" speak of young men experiencing life in ways they never believed they could; \\"Mandolin Wind\\" acutely describes the winters in Great Britain; \\"Tomorrow Is Such A Long Time\\" is a Dylan cover that tops the exceptional original, describing a search for inner peace that may mean giving up things once held close; \\"That's All Right\\" is a rockabilly song that's better than Elvis' version; and \\"Reason To Believe\\" points out why belief in what you're doing is sometimes the hardest thing of all. This album, taken as a whole, could be seen as questioning why people even try to hold on to their pasts. EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY is a great piece of work from an artist who would equal it with the follow-up, and make some great records and some garbage later on, but never truly equalled the first four albums.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|I was initially disappointed in Lullabies to Paralyze, which is, no matter what way you slice it, a substantially lesser album than Songs For The Deaf.  I think my issue is that as a cohesive whole, it doesn't accomplish much, as each song seems to have no connection to any around it - whereas Songs For The Deaf seemed to be on one grand arc to save hard rock as we know it (and for a while, it did - maybe it was having Dave Grohl and Nick Oliveri on the payroll).  So, that being said, that means that the song for song effort is at least solid, and occasionally brimming with the bravado, pulse, and sensuality of their best work.  \\"Burn The Witch\\" is a stomping anthem, \\"Medication\\" a slash-and-burn adrenaline shot, and the serious songs \\"I Never Came\\" and \\"Long Slow Goodbye\\" are as masterfully emotional as anyone creates these days.  Plus, the record's seven minute climax \\"Someone's In The Wolf\\" is astonishing on its own - at turns as invigorating and terrifying as it is melodic.  For songs that original and unexpected, I have no problem accepting a lesser Josh Homme effort.
0743454529|5.0|I just added this book to one of my all time favorites.  My favorite list is rather short so adding this one is an honor to Picoult.  I will not lend this book out as I know it would be passed on over and over and I will never get it back.   I am obsessive about my favorites and they need to be pristine.  I have enjoyed many of Jodi Picoult's books and will eventually read them all.  This book keeps you identifying and sympathizing with the various characters.  I don't know how she does it but Picoult keeps coming up with one hit after another.

B00003CX9E|5.0|A real masterpiece! I was extremely impressed with this movie. <br />Not merely for it's filmogaphy but, for the thoughts & emotions it provokes. One can not simply watch this movie without reflecting on the simple message it leaves us with. No amount of fame, power, and wealth can ever replace love! Because without love you have NOTHING. As Kane searched the world over for the finest things, created his own huge palace, enormous   success, he never found what his heart so desired. Because no amount of money or power could buy him love. Kane merely loved Kane.This is defintely a movie you'll want to watch more than once!
B000021XS0|3.0|OK, well...  I'm not sure whether I like it or not.  When I bought it I was looking for Images and Words/Train Of Thought type CD, instead I got alot of mellow acoustic songs, to me this isn't Progressive Metal.  Nonetheless it has a few good songs on it that you can't help but be amazed at Dream Theater's talent.  Mike Portnoy is amazing, Petrucci is a freak, these guys are total masters. But seriously, I much prefer Train 'Of Thought' to this, but  it just depends on what music you're looking for.  I'm amazed at how Dream Theater's sound changes so much throughout all their albums.  Dream Theater fans I suggest you get this, I'm not incinuating it's a bad album, just it is not what I was looking for.
B000929AJQ|5.0|What With Teeth is not:  it's not deeper, more creative, pensive, or artistic than The Downward Spiral; more experimental or fecund than The Fragile; or intense, angrier, or louder than Broken (an EP but I lump it in with the others).    What With Teeth is:  a bit of a return to what Pretty Hate Machine was, an energetic romp, a song-driven rather than concept/emotion driven piece.  This is is what makes With Teeth the most immediately enjoyable NIN album since Pretty Hate Machine.  Like Pretty Hate Machine, I immediately liked With Teeth; it took a few listens for TDS and TF to grow on me.  And sometimes I'm not in the mood to hear TDS or TF, whereas I can hear Pretty Hate Machine pretty much any time.    I recommend this album for most NIN fans. There is always the fringe fan for whom nothing but an artist's seminal work will suffice, but unless you demand a great deal of darkness, emotion, and experimentation from NIN, you'll enjoy With Teeth.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Surprisingly enough you can love this movie, without being an \\"indie\\" film person. It is (shocker!) possible to be effected by a movie just because you can relate to it. Not because magazines give it good reviews or what your friends think and quite obviously not what the people on Amazon think. Yes, it's true that most people my age (15) believe that a movie is good if  <br />a) someone/something explodes <br />b) sex <br />c) is a senseless romantic comedy <br />Anyone who has ever felt lost or lonely can relate and enjoy this visually stunning movie. With Bill Murray in the lead he gives a truly Oscar worthy performance. As an aging actor who is more than a little sarcastic yet not beyond looking for human connection. In a city (Tokyo) he knows nothing about. That's where Scarlett comes in as a young, Yale graduate who's photographer husband practically ignores her. Both are in a foreign city, exacerbating their feelings of isolation and really the question of; what makes life worth living if it's so hard? does it get any easier?  <br />They spend day after day with each other learning about Tokyo and the culture, but more importantly learning about each other and realizing that connection is not so hard with the right person. Although they know it cannot last as they both have to move on with their lives.  <br />Yet the point of that movie is that although their relationship doesnt last forever, it doesnt mean it effects us any less. Sometimes such limitations make them even more important and the memory, the bridge lasts forever. Also, alleviating the feeling of loneliness as you now know that there is someone in the world that understands. The conclusion is excellent and makes that point.  <br />What makes the movie so beautiful is that they have this relationship, beyond friendship but never sexual. When they're lying in bed, talking about life, you get the feeling of profound trust and mutual love. Something that most of us would be lucky to experience in our lifetime.
B0000C8AVX|5.0|Some Dylan fans in late 1964 were still trying to figure out why Dylan no longer sang protest songs. His most recent release, \\"Another Side of Bob Dylan\\", moved away from the overtly political and angst ridden lyrics of \\"The Times They Are A-Changin'\\" and \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\". Dylan began to write lyrics that probably seemed obscure and nonsensical to his fans at the time. Some are very funny. Some are so rich in imagery and layerings of meaning that even a few listens won't reveal what's going on. Or was the lack of obvious meaning the point? Nonetheless, \\"Another Side of Bob Dylan\\" still featured a Dylan playing accompanied by only an acoustic guitar, piano, and harmonica. Fans seemed okay with it until \\"Bringing it all Back Home\\" committed folk music heresy. Dylan went electric. And he didn't do it subtly.<br /><br />The album opens with a blast. \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" introduces the folk blues rock that would dominate the rest of Dylan's career. The lyrics read like a warning to young people who just entered the real world: \\"Lookout kid you're gonna get hit\\". \\"Maggie's Farm\\" continues the electrified onslaught with its 'take this job and shove it' theme. \\"Outlaw Blues\\", \\"On the Road Again\\", and \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\" (complete with its bizarre false start) further explore Dylan's new blues territory.  But blues rock doesn't exhaust this album's range. \\"She Belongs To Me\\", and \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" are beautiful ballads that explore the vicissitudes of relationships.<br /><br />The second half of the album features a mostly acoustic Dylan (with some subtle accompaniment). \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" went on to become one of his best known songs after the Byrds scored a #1 hit with it in 1965. \\"Gates of Eden\\", \\"It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding), and \\"It's all over Now, Baby Blue\\"  continue Dylan's new approach to lyrics. All are amazing songs in the acoustic Dylan tradition.<br /><br />One very interesting aspect about \\"Bringing it All Back Home\\" isn't preserved on the CD release. The vinyl LP release, like all LPs, had two non-continuous sides. Originally, side one ended with \\"Bob Dylan's 115th Dream\\". Side Two then began with \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\". This had the effect of creating two separate worlds whenever one flipped the record. The electric Dylan on side one and the acoustic Dylan on side two. Dylan's folk fans probably wore out side two.<br /><br />For all the reasons mentioned above, \\"Bringing it All Back Home\\" remains Dylan's most abrupt transistional album. It also represents the largest shift in style Dylan made in his entire career.<br /><br />It's hard to imagine the shock the electrified Dylan sent through the folk scene of 1965. Dylan's set at The 1965 Newport Folk Fesitval is now legendary (his band was booed). Cries of \\"sellout\\" and even \\"Judas\\" rang from audiences (the latter can be heard on the 1966 Albert Hall Concert CD set). The film \\"Don't Look Back\\" from this era shows his folk fans questioning him why he \\"no longer sounds like himself\\". It caused an outright scandal in Dylan's main fan base. Despite this alienation, \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" made the pop charts and greatly expanded Dylan's fan base.

B00005K9QP|5.0|This album is well recorded to CD and likely satisfying to the audiophiles out there still collecting Redbook CD. I'm listening to the Mobile Fidelity version right now on my tubed amplifier--the electric guitars on this recording are captured in vivid detail. You can feel the rich and precise pace of the music.     Historically, the album marks a significant moment in the transition from Blues to R&R. For me, having spent decades listening to, and playing R&R, this Bluesbreakers recording, particularly with Clapton, marked an addicting beginning to a deeper exploration of the Blues.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This show is awesome and very realistic. I like it more than Saving Private Ryan. The only thing that I don't like about it is the DVD packaging. While the tin case is nice, the folding disc holders inside are rather messy to deal with.

B00080Z53O|5.0|Alejandro Amenbar's new film is based on the real life of Ramn Sampedro, whose body had been long paralysed from the neck down because of the accident he had jumping into the sea in 1968, 25 year old.  I didn't know anything about him, but in Spain, I hear, he is very famous and the characters in this film also have the models. <br /> <br />Considering these facts, it is amazing that 35-year-old Javier Bardem plays so convincingly the role of Ramn who was in fact more than 50 years old at the time when the film describes.  Amenbar's film quietly follows the last days of his life, including the budding relationship with women surrounding him (including Julia, also terminally-ill, and Rosa, devorced), the family members (showing mixed emotional reactions to his final decision), and the legal matters. <br /> <br />[MORAL QUESTIONS] Now, here is a tough question about the moral issues dealt here.  Some professional reviewers argue, understandably to some extent, that the film is trying to manipulate the audiences, and shows the simplified views on the topic called euthanasia, or life and death.  I disagree.  For one thing, this is a fact-based film about the real person who really thought that his decision is the best one for him, so why not respect that?  It is true that 'The Sea Inside' keeps on stressing the belief of Ramn Sampedro.  Probably, his view is not yours (and not shared by many of the characters).  If the film manipulates (as good films always do), that's because you have to see things through his eyes, to understand his life, 'life as obligation' as he describes. <br /> <br />The acting is unanimously great, so it is pointless to name the names one by one.  I only point out that though Bardem was once Oscar-nominated for 'Before Night Falls,' it is this film that proves his enormous talent as great actor.  You see no 'sexy' or 'macho' image here.  Just the character. <br /> <br />In the end Ramn gets what he wants, and the descriptions of the videomessage recording (which really happened, and the tape was seen by many people in Spain) are very painfully realistic.  However, at the same time, Ramn remains very attractive throughout the film because of his personality, and in fact, according to the film, more than one women visit him repeatedly.  You only find the subtle treatment of the material if you look close enough at the characters.  In this way, 'The Sea Inside' poses many intriguing questions about his life, or life in general.
B0001L3LUE|1.0|Robert S. McNamara desperately wants to redeem himself on Vietnam before the \\"Grim Reaper\\" appears.  I am amazed that so many people rated this documentary so high.  While it may be a good artistic production, had someone else asked tougher questions, McNamara would not have been able to go unchallenged. <br /> <br />For all who think for a moment that RSM was candid and factual throughout this documentary interview, please read \\"Dereliction of Duty: Johnson, McNamara, the Joint Chiefs, and the Lies That Led to Vietnam, by H.R. McMaster.  This book sets the record straight.
0440213525|4.0|Interesting and very action packed. That is the only two ways I know how to describe John Grisham's novel \\"the client.\\"  From gun shootouts to murders this book is all action. Even the first chapter of the book packed with action and intriguing legal stuff. This book is for the medium to average reader. You might want to pick this book up if you are a fan of John Grisham or if you like legal styled books.  <br /> The book follows an 11-year-old boy named Mark Sway on his journey while he is on the run from some very unhappy mafia man. Mark and his little brother Ricky have a troubled life, they have no father and their mother has a hard time keeping track of the two of them. While they were out messing around one day they stumble across a crazy man that is on edge. This man is trying to take his own life. Before he does he tells Mark a secret that could end up getting Mark killed.  <br /> The book is told by a lot of dialogue. There are a couple of flashbacks but there is a lot of dialogue between all the characters. All of the characters really sound like they are who they are. This book has every type of literary element that is possible. I had a very fun time reading this book and there is no reason why you shouldn't. I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes to read.  <br />

The life of Dr. Jekyll shows how everyone has a dark side. Even the nicest people have a dark side. I think he had to express his dark side somehow and used drugs or a \\"posion\\" as an excuse to express himself. I recommend everyone to read this book.
0790731002|4.0|This was a great Batman movie.  Val Kilmer did an admirable job as Batman and Chris O'Donnell was fun if not slightly rambunctious as Robin.  And the villians were played PERFECTLY by Jim Carrey as the Riddler and Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face.  This movie was soooooooooo much more interesting and exciting that Batman Returns, which wasted so much time on the Penguin's plan for mayor, which was boring and ridiculous.  As a fan of Batman comics as a child, I can truly say to everyone that this was an excellent Batman movie that was slightly inferior to Batman but much better than Batman Returns. <br />

B0000E1ALR|4.0|I have been listening to Bruce since 1974 and so, was not surprised by his politics, only reminded that his music is honest and true to who he is.  There are many songs and albums that mean a lot to me personally and had there been enough missing, I wouldn't have bought it.  Except for a gold CD of \\"Born to Run\\", I have never been happy with the sound quality of Springsteen CD's. That's why I bought \\"The Essential\\" and it didn't disappoint because even though everyone says the first 2 CD's are not remastered, they sound much better here.  In the meantime, I am waiting, not so patiently for Bruce to bring the sound of his CD's up to the quality of his soulful music.  God bless, Bruce Springsteen.
0060194995|5.0|\\"Whoa\\" was all I could say after I finished the novel. I reckon this classic is one of the best novels I have ever read. The words used in the novel are very easy that variety of readers can enjoy. <br />Also, the story builds up strongly toward the theme of conscience that grows in Jean's heart and is denied by some town people. In addition, the story never neglects to work on characterization of main characters with some side stories. In their childhood, we can see and enjoy Jean and Jem's innocence when they play together. As Atticus as personal idol, Jean and Jem grow up to become caring, generous and wise. <br />This book is also historically valid, looking at how Southern states of America suffered from severe racism. the novel follows the historical background of the states very well. The segregation, enforced by Jim Crow law, allowed the hatred and ignoring between African Americans and Whites to be formed. Through the trial, we begin to question the connection between racism and conscience. As the story develops, Jean learns conscience, and her attitude toward African Americans changes a lot. So, the book can be very educational to growing teenagers. <br />
0440237688|1.0|BAD.  I hate this book, im currently being made to read it along with my other classmates in Reading clas.  I do not like it, and i dont understand how you other people can.  But hey, each to his own.  The only way i would reccomend this to someone is if you paid me a million dollars, and even then i would take the money, then write the reccomendation on a sticky note, and put it on the fridge.  Only read this if you dont have ANYTHING ELSE TO DO.   <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />*You know you love me* <br /> <br />PS- Sorry if some of you feel like  I bashed a favorite book of yours.  But hey......... i have a right to free speech.
B0001EKZOQ|5.0|When I first heard about this album, I felt skeptical - Cuban master pianist Bebo Valdes joining forces with a flamenco singer? Huh? But, my friends, what an amazing album this turned out to be. The instrumentation is very sparse (piano and bass most of the time, sometimes adding a horn solo, which perfectly complements the mood), and the incredible voice of Diego Cigala. This \\"nakedness\\" of sorts, makes for a powerfully touching, arresting emotional experience. You can feel every nuance in Diego's voice, every eloquent note of Bebo's piano, and the lilting pulse of the bass. Magic, pure magic. Like another reviewer said, this is a perfect album to just play in your backyard in a quiet night, sipping your favorite drink. Careful, though - you may start feeling a little choked-up with emotion. Ah, the power of music. Music without artifice, without gimmicks, without production tricks and polish. What a rare ocurrence in this day and age. Just the pure sound of 2 or 3 acoustic instruments and a pure, imperfect, but beautifully naked voice just bristling with passion. Amazing, simply amazing.
0375703861|4.0|Smith's use of language was amazing.  I loved every descriptive passage of this book.  I need to re-read it with a notepad to capture the new vocabulary words that I just gleaned from context on my first read-through.<br /><br />The characters in this book are terrific.  I was infuriated with Ahmad for his self-righteous religious-ness.  He was so real to me that I couldn't stop thinking about him.  Joyce Chalfen was the over-achieving new millenium mom, and every scene featuring her was a terrifyingly humorous portrait of the damage a driven woman can do in pursuit of enlightened motherhood.  Hortense Bowden was another rich character, full of her own set of religious beliefs that she followed in spite of common sense.  These characters were diverse in their lifestyles and opinions, and all of them blindly followed a personal code that led them to do damage to others in the name of their personal beliefs.
B00005JNTV|4.0|Basically it's Pulp Fiction without the wholesome family etertainment value.  <br /> <br />The movie shines in dark wit and uber-violence, but you won't like it if you think much about details like I did. I'm gonna be honest, this movie has fight scenes that are even more exaggerated than Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, a movie which this one reminded me off cause the karate chick in old town can fly. Basically all of the 'good' characters can withstand enough punishment to kill an entire infantry division worth of troops. But if you shut down the logic based part of your mind you'll dig it for it's awesome visuals and dark wit. <br /> <br />And honestly I just can't dislike a movie with so many boobies in it.
B000002UAX|5.0|The Beatles, without a doubt, is one of the most influential rick groups in the 20th Century. Though they have broken up, their music still remains and will remain for years to come. The White Album is indisputably one of thier finest albums. If you like the Beatles, you will love the White Album. <br /> <br />P.S. To all you folks out there who claim in their reviews (85% of which were \\"Kid's Reviews\\")that the Beatles lacked innovation and talent, you are all unfortunatly mistaken.
0670033375|5.0|There is no shortage of scary books that selectively present facts to promote a specific agenda - whether environmentalist, free market or whatever. This book on the other hand is very balanced and presents a thorough analysis of different points of view. That is what really makes it scary - you can't discount the arguments as a partisan polemic. <br />The author has managed to keep a certain pace and tell a story without diluting the analytical aspects. So this work of non-fiction is almost as engaging as a well-written fiction.
0679720200|5.0|Although Camus' The Stranger completely goes completely against my entire belief structure; it is a simple masterpiece of human indifference.  It illustrates how many people in this world think, react, and feel about the purpose of life and whether any of it has meaning.  The Stranger explores issues such as irrationality in the universe, the meaninglessness of human life, and how important the physical world is.  Camus was himself a proclaimed atheist and these bleak issues shine through in the most haunting way.   <br /> <br />The Stranger is told in first person by a character named Meursault.  He is attending his mother's funeral.  He really doesn't care too much that his mother has just passed away.  Merusault has a cold indifference concerning everything around him.  He feels nothing most of the time, but he still feels very much like a real human being and not a cardboard narrator.   On the day of the funeral, he mostly notices the weather and how hot it is, instead of what he should be focusing on: the death of his mother. <br /> <br />The day after the funeral, life is back to normal again.  Nothing has changed for Meursault.  He meets a girl, takes her to a movie, and spends the night with her.  This is a key sequence describing how logic never seems to grab hold of him.  Where did he develop this attitude from?  The novel never really explains, but our belief structure can never totally be explained. <br /> <br />Meursault, soon after, develops a friendship with a man named Raymond.  Raymond has a furious temper and has been known to assault women.  On one occasion he beats up his Arab mistress rather badly.  This leads to revenge that is attempted on him and Meursault later on in the novel by the mistress's brother and his friend. <br /> <br />The climax of novel occurs on a sun drenched beach.  Raymond has invited Merusault and his girlfriend Marie to spend the day there with a couple of friends.  The morning starts out well enough.  This small group ofpeople goes swimming, talk, and eat a pleasant lunch together. <br /> <br />After lunch Merusault, Raymond, and another fellow named Masson decide to go out walking.  They spot the Arab brother of this mistress Raymond assaulted.  He is with a friend, walking towards them.  As they grow closer towards one another a fight breaks out, Raymond is stabbed, and the two Arab's flee.  It turns out Raymond didn't suffer any major blows, however, and his is patched up at the hospital within a couple of hours.   <br /> <br />Later on that afternoon, Merusault and Raymond spot the two Arabs again on the beach.  They stare at each other coldly, but no outbreak occurs and the Arabs walk away, Raymond and Merusault continue walking and Raymond decides he needs a rest.  Merusault asks him for his gun and heads back in the other direction. <br /> <br />Merusault soon spots one of the Arabs lying down on the beach, and in one of the most explosive and tense scenes in all of literature, guns him down. <br /> <br />Part two of the novel deals with Merusault's time in prison, the trial of his crime, and the delivery of his sentence.  This is philosophical section of the novel and possible the finest.  Merusault is left alone with his thoughts which become increasingly urgent with impending doom weighing down upon his mind. <br /> <br />The tone of The Stranger is appropriately detached and empty, much like its narrator.  Notice how Merusault doesn't acknowledge anything by using judgment or emotion. <br />He simply points out the \\"physical\\" things that people do around him.  The weather being hot... the nice skin on a girl...the sand on the beach.  He never states emotional things such as:  I really loved being with her.....I liked the way she made me feel.....He had a good personality.  Things like this are not noticed.  Only the physical aspects of the world around him are.  This is an underlying symbol of his detachment with God and the emotional side of the world he lives in.  Merusault never breaks character.  Camus molds him into the symbol of his own beliefs and never once strays from that path. <br /> <br />It ironic that at the moment Merusault gives up all hope is the moment he is at peace and happy.  As long as he clings to hope he is miserable.  There is a key sequence at the end of the novel between him and the Chaplin.  The Chaplin cannot accept that Merusault will not turn to God in his hour of need, but Merusault cannot understand why the Chaplin can believe in something that is illogical and unreal.  When we die, that is all there is.  Human life has no greater meaning. <br /> <br />That is the central issue of the novel.  There is no logic in the universe.  There is no God, no higher being, no fate, destiny, or any outside force acting upon us.  We are simply creatures of chance and coincidence.  Personally, I feel that is a very bleak way to describe the world, but nevertheless it is a view many people believe in.   <br /> <br />The Stranger didn't change any of my beliefs, but it gave me a greater understanding into the minds of others.  It unflinchingly went against all that I hold sacred.  But it made me think long and hard.  It helped shed some light on why people are the way they are, and at the same time strengthened the beliefs that make me who I am.  That is one right we all have and no one can take from us: our beliefs and values.  I felt like I was right there with Merusault in his hopeless little world he lived in.  What makes a novel great is not whether or not you agree with the issues presented by an author, but rather the way the author presents them....and there aren't many greater at doing that then The Stranger. <br /> <br />Grade: A
B00001W9G0|5.0|This is a romance for viewers who like complicated, deep characters. Every time I see this movie, I see another aspect about male-female relations I missed before. Hubble (Robert Redford) is the beautiful goyim boy Katie (Barbara Streisand) falls in love with. She lives entirely on the outside of her skin and is always pushing, pushing for the causes she believes in, if only to lack time in which to think about her own failings and insecurities. Everything for Katie is black and white, but no so for Hubble. He comes from the WASPy, privileged set, and is intelligent enough to see the hypocrisy and falseness of his peers. He also knows he would not fit in if he let on what is going on in his brain, so he holds back and goes with the flow, always doubting his ability to stand on his own. Not many authors could pull off a believable romance between two such disparate characters, but this movie does it admirably due in no small part to the acting abilities of Redford and Streisand who imbue every look and line with the desperate longing Hubble and Katie have to be together and to make this relationship work.
B00006M183|5.0|After making the same style of in your face songs for seven albums, they've made a much different and better record than ever before. <br />It may take a few listens to get into it, and theirs no massive radio hits like off their other albums, but who cares. <br /> <br />The musics interesting and is just a really good listen. <br />
B00000I2PG|5.0|1982/1983 was a great time in music for me, as this was the era of the 2nd British Invasion.  While the first British Invasion of the 60's was sparked by the Beatles, this 2nd British Invasion was lead by MTV and their exposure of British New Wave bands.<br /><br />Along with The Human League and Soft Cell, one of the first bands to benefit was ABC.  I can remember how much I loved the high drama of \\"The Look of Love\\" when I first heard it on a \\"smash it or trash it\\" call in radio show in late summer 1982.  When the song went on to become a Top 40 hit, I was thrilled.  The video was quite fun as well, very funny and loaded with sexual inuendo.  What was quite odd about it, was the fact that the song was high drama and the video was like an episode of \\"Benny Hill.\\"  In early '83, the follow up \\"Poison Arrow\\" also became a Top 40 hit, although the accompanying video was more dramatic.  \\"All of my Heart\\" and \\"Tears are Not Enough\\" received airplay on video stations, although the songs failed to make the Top 40.<br /><br />ABC was often referred to as part of the New Romantic movement coming out of England at the time.  Some artists of the era went for a more street urchin look (2 examples are Bananarama before they became glamour models in the late 80's and Dexy's Midnight Runners).  Other's went for the futuristic look (2 examples are A Flock of Seagulls and Missing Persons).  But the New Romantics wore sharp suites, had precision haircuts, and their music was like a marriage between Blue-Eyed Soul and a James Bond score.  The other big artist in the New Romantic vein was Spandau Ballet.  Both ABC and Spandau Ballet had similar sounds and similar looks. But where as the Spand's had trouble following up their breakthrough smash \\"True\\", ABC went on after this album to have hits with songs like \\"Be Near Me\\", \\"How to be a Millionaire\\" and \\"When Smokey Sings.\\"<br /><br />If you like 80's Brit Pop with strong vocals and high drama, you will love this remastered version of this excellent CD.  It sounds even better today than it did back in the 80's when I had it on cassette.
B000002BFZ|5.0|With this albumn they moved away from the so called \\"grunge\\" sound and started being a proper band. <br />Its actually their best, they'll never do anything like it again, and is their most important album. <br /> <br />The songs are all fantastic, and its not all lectric guitar riffs, theres acoustic and piano on a few songs as well. <br />Forget Ten, Vs and Viotlagy and start here.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I think I can safely say this is the greatest musical of this generation, so far. The music in this CD is amazing! Once you see the play it means so much more. Every song is amazing and although the track \\"The Wicked Witch of the East\\" didn't make the album (even though the CD is only 71 minutes, it would've fit) it's still stands high as one of my top 25 favorite albums ever! I can listen to every song without skipping. The greatest tracks include the Fiyero/Scarecrow spell-bound song \\"No Good Deed,\\" a personal favorite of mine, \\"Dancing Through Life\\" and \\"Popular,\\" the most vibrant tracks on the album and most pop-friendly, and a little song just before intermission called \\"Defying Gravity.\\"  <br /> <br />Let me take a minute to reflect on the perfection that is \\"Defying Gravity.\\" There's a reason why the song's title is the slogan of the damn play. The power in that song is enough to trample any army, any being (other than God), any mountain. Speaking of God, the song, in it's own, it's a religious experience. I can say it's the greatest song of all time (at least to me and that means something). Idina is truly flawless in this song. When the bridge hits (\\"so if you care to find me...\\") you feel a sensation you might never have felt before. The message in the song is also a major point in how great the song is. You can take it as the play offers it or apply it to yourself. The song is about personal strength and overcoming ANY obstacle no matter how big it may be. Giving the people who try to break you or make you compromise your own values the big \\"F*** YOU!\\" Elphaba shows that she's MUCH more powerful than any obstacle because she believes in herself. And that's worth all the money in the world.  <br /> <br />So watch the play if you have the means because it sure helps make the album so much more special & actually more understandable. But if you're just looking for great music from an outstanding musical that encompasses all forms of emotion (sadness, revenge, excitement, regret, anger, hate and love) this album is a definite must-own.  <br /> <br />Top 5 songs on the album:  <br />(11/10) \\"Defying Gravity\\"  <br />(10/10) \\"No Good Deed\\"  <br />(10/10) \\"Dancing Through Life\\"  <br />(10/10) \\"For Good\\"  <br />(10/10) \\"The Wizard And I\\"
B000002N2P|5.0|This album is the real and exciting sounding Green Day. <br />This album makes you want ot flush \\"American Idiot\\" down the toilet. <br /> <br />If you want to listen to some music which is a good kick in the head ........well - get it then?
0440213525|4.0|Don't mess with the mob  <br /> <br />This is the first book I have read of John Grishum. The book is full of excitement and is really easy to follow. But the thing I liked about this book the most is that it describes the carters so well I can see them in my mind, well in other words the imagery was vary good. My favorite part was when mark describes how every thing happened and how he rembers\ to keep out sertent details. My favorite character was Mark he is vary muchur for his age. He saw some thing that other people would gust brake down and do nothing. This book also showed me how people can do stuff to mess up a court rooms and how the mob can kill people just to stay out of jail. The thing I didn't like is that there was too much legal things that I didn't understand. Yes I do recommend people to read this book because this book is filled with excitement. <br /> <br /> <br />Why I think the imagery is vary important in this book is because if the book puts your mind in the book and you can actually see what is going on and you can see what the author can see well that's a vary good book for me. The thing that really bugged me about this book is all the legal terms they used, I am not a layer     <br />
B0002VEXUA|5.0|10 years since the greatest debut album ever......probably....yeah definitley. <br />Well what a great reason to release, a DVD more celebrating ten years of Oasis rather than the record, as gooder record as it is, its nothing (on the whole) that changed the musical world, but more woke it up and said, this is what its all about, we mean it, and they did and still do, despite their albums falling short of expectations, and not only that. <br /> <br />They are still the most important band in the world.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I learned about Muse through a discussion board. I checked out their debut work \\"Showbiz\\" and liked them, but wasn't particularly impressed, since their similarity to Radiohead struck me as being too forced. After several listens of \\"Absolution\\" I confess I've learned to respect their work. There is absolutely not a single average track on this album. All of them showcase the work of a solid band that doesn't hide their influences, but rather builds upon them.<br /><br />With a lead singer that will remind you of Thom Yorke if you shut your eyes, their work will come in as musical candy to the fans of Radiohead in and around the \\"Bends\\" and \\"OK Computer\\" period. But they incorporate piano into their songs in a way more operatic and epic, if you may, than the influential legends of prog rock. \\"Absolution\\" by Muse is an absolutely incredible production that stands out comfortably by itself. Without a doubt, one of the best albums to have been released in 2003. Sad that I had to find out about it almost two years after it came out. Better late than never...
B0000027RL|3.0|This is Pearl Jams most successful and well known album, and besides being killed by the radio and selling out Nirvana - hooray!, that does'nt mean in anyway its their best. <br /> <br />Even Vs is not their best, as their sound on their albums has changed and for the better. <br />Their first two albums are their worst. <br />Best start at Vitolagy.
B00000I8BX|5.0|My opinions may be a little one sided because Fear Factory is my favorite band, but this CD is definatly one of my favorite CD's in the world, may even be my most favorite one.  Obsolete is my favorite CD out of the CD's Fear Factory has to offer. <br /> <br />Even though I already said all the songs on this album were good, the ones that stick out to me are Shock, Edgecrusher, Descent, and Resurrection.  If you have the bonus album the song Cars is a great remake from the band \\"The Cars\\". <br /> <br />Shock is a great songs because it opens with a great intro.  Burton C. Bell, vocals, opens saying \\"Shock!\\" with a great drum beat and guitars to back it up. <br /> <br />Edgecrusher is a great all around tune, arguably the best song on the CD.  It has awesome lyrics and cunning music tones.  A must listen song. <br /> <br />My favorite song on the CD and my most favorite song in the world is Descent.  This is a must listen.  The guitars in the song is one of the best tunes I have ever heard in my life.  The song is calm and hardcore metal at the same time.  The lyrics in the song are a masterpiece. <br /> <br />If you want to wind back from the headbanging for awhile and you feel too lazy to change the CD, I would advise listening to Resurrection.  It's a great song with a nice, soft beat.  Great lyrics are in the song. <br /> <br />If you like Classical Metal with a newer beat to it, Cars is the song you want to listen to.  It was a great hit back when The Cars made it and even a great hit now-a-days.  You can listen to this song even if you're not a metal head! <br /> <br />Overall, this may be the best metal CD out there.  I advise buying this CD and if you like the music, definatly buy other Fear Factory albums.  All of their albums are different but Fear Factory is a great band.  Thanks for your time in reading my review. <br /> <br />   -Dann L. Bell
B000068QY7|3.0|There are some great songs on Heathen Chemistry, but the album lacks some punch like there others. <br /> <br />Not really as good as the ones before it.
0451528956|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book, to me it was confusing at first then it got very interesting near the end. The novel is about a well respected doctor (Mr. Hyde) that invents a posion that can change a person into their alter ego. Dr. Jekyll drinks this posion, and becomes a character we know as (Mr. Hyde.) Mr. Hyde is known as a very disrupeted character that is responsible for the murder of Sir Danvers Carew. Before the Carew murder, Jekyll had become a disrupted person himself. After the Carew murder, Mr. Hyde is not seen nor heard from for a long time. The night of the Carew murder, Hyde leaves a note for Mr. Utterson. Also after Mr. Utterson received Mr. Hyde's letter he had received a dinner invitation from Dr. Jekyll that matched in handwritting to the letter from Mr. Hyde. After this Mr. Utterson investigates and later finds out that Mr. Hyde is only a figure of a posion. My Hyde is Dr. Jekyll's alter ego. At the end of the novel Hyde takes over Dr. Jekyll therefor, he kills himself. This novel was interesting because it makes you wonder whiel reading the novel, how is Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde connected, and who really killed Carew? At first, I thought that Mr. Hyde and Dr. Jekyll were good friends and Dr. Jekyll was lying for Mr. Hyde so that Mr. Utterson wont know his whereabouts. Later I thought that Dr. Jekyll was helping Mr. Hyde get away with the Carew murder, and was plotting to kill Mr. Utterson. It was even more interesting to find out that Mr. Hyde was only Dr. Jekyll's alter ego from a posion that Dr. Jekyll Invented.
B0000028UK|3.0|Vs is a very raw and messy album, back when Pearl Jam were noisy and screamed alot and had alot of long hair. <br />Of course their are some very very good tracks on here that deserve a standing ovation. <br /> <br />\\"animal\\" \\"Daughter\\" \\"Blood\\" \\"Indifference\\" and \\"Rearview Mirror\\". <br /> <br />The rest are just very, well certainly not bad, but to unfoccussed and undeveloped. <br />
1573226521|5.0|I saw the film first and found it to be incredibly engaging, but reading the book was something else altogether. Being the same age as Garland, I was truly inspired by his ability to masterfully create a gripping story, one that forces the reader to question his own morals and ethics.<br />Most of us have had fantasies or daydreams about escaping to an island paradise  to take solace away from the grit and grime of the world at large...Garland's novel in many ways is saying, \\"Be careful what you wish for!\\"<br />I don't like to summarize plots in my reviews as I find it gives away the intrigue in actually picking up a book in the first place but I can  say that the main character, Richard, is someone you will enjoy getting to know and the landscapes and situations are absolutely lush and brilliant if not at times sad an maddening. There are both danger and hilarity. The main point is, like the characters in the novel, the literal beauty of \\"The Beach\\" will reel you in like a mirage, but once it gets its hooks in you, I seriously doubt you'll be able to walk away for long. And, like a mirage, it will prove to be something entirely different than what originally meets the eye.This is one that you will continue to think about long after the quest is over. It's young and exciting and highly visual. Enjoy!
B00004T8RK|5.0|Theres something about the vibe of this album that is'nt that great, it sounds far to dreary. <br />That said, the songs are absolutley outstanding. <br />Some great guitar playing on \\"nothing as it seems\\" as well. <br />Brilliant stuff.
015603008X|5.0|With complete honesty, I can say that Flowers For Algernon is one of the best novels I've read in a very long time. Daniel Keyes tragic story about a human experiment gone terribly wrong is written in such a way that it is simultaneously poignant and thought provoking. His excellent writing and use of perspective takes us so deeply into Charlie's life that, by the end of the story, it takes a very strenuous effort for one to not feel sympathy towards Charlie's final fate. <br />Charlie Gordon is a 35-year-old man working in a bakery as a janitor. His IQ is 69, and he has a very hard time spelling and writing correctly. However, acting upon a leap of faith, Charlie agrees to allow his body to be experimented upon in an intelligence-increasing surgical operation. What happens after is nothing short of miraculous - Charlie soon turns into a genius with an IQ of 170, and becomes an \\"information sponge\\" that soaks in everything. His intelligence soon surpasses those of professors and the very same doctors who operated on him. His discussions with them soon turn one-sided, as his colleagues no longer have any idea what Charlie is talking about. However, he is still treated like a test subject instead of as a human being by other people. In his frustration and anger, Charlie runs away and decides to live independently. On this journey, we come to see of how intelligence is regarded in society, and how people have come to worship it. Towards the end of the story, Charlie makes a point of showing that intelligence by itself is nothing - only when intelligence pairs itself with affection will it ever amount to anything. Unfortunately, Charlie never retains the intelligence and knowledge he's gained, and by the end of the novel he loses it once again while returning back to a world of slow responses and poor writing and spelling. <br />Daniel Keyes represents the notion of intelligence excellently in this novel. By using Charlie's transformation from dimwit to genius as his vehicle, Keyes shows us that other virtues in life are regarded more highly then intelligence. Also, as we follow Charlie's tortured life, we can't help but realize that in some ways, a lack of higher intelligence can prove to be a benefit. Ignorance, in some parts of life, is bliss. By writing the novel as a collaboration of Charlie's private progress reports, the audience can easily connect with Charlie's personality. Thus, at the end of the story, when Charlie loses his intelligence once again, a feeling of sorrow can't help but be felt. <br />
B000002C25|5.0|How can you top \\"Wonderwall\\" and \\"Don't look back in anger\\" <br />sure it can be done, it always is possible, but when you've written the best songs in the world already and your doing loads of cocaine and all that carry on - well its the perfect excuse to make a nice loud album with loads of guitar noise, and throw it all back in the stupid peoples face. <br /> <br />I mean, any real Oasis fan would like this record anyway. <br />
B000001GGV|5.0|Ivo Pogorelich's Scarlatti CD is very fine. He has an extremely light touch in this music, very reminiscent of Horowitz (Horowitz being the standard for Scarlatti on piano against whom all others are measured). <br /> <br />His program combines well and less known Scarlatti sonatas, with a slight emphasis on the earlier works.  <br /> <br />One of the best all Scarlatti piano sonata CDs I know, along with Horowitz (Sony), Pletnev (Virgin), Maria Tipo (EMI Classics), and Andjaparidze (Naxos). <br /> <br />Very good sound. <br />
B000002MP2|4.0|That person below me (whoever he is) - BORING!! <br />No one wants to listen to some boring cult band which sells 200 records to its 200 fans, thats not music! Musics about being exciting and different, and having great songs (as long as they are'nt washed up torrential rain rubbish ones, that are recorded for money) <br /> <br />With American Idiot, (and yes its a terrible direction GReen Day took with it) it was just about him writing songs being annoyed with America and spokes people giving people of America a bad reputation. Anyway, that album is pretty bad, and besides, this is \\"Dookie!!\\" this is'nt a politcal album, your oviously not very..........\\"knowledgable\\" (in the politest way) about music. <br /> <br />This is Green Days, first a major album, and in a way their debut, its overated - \\"Insomniac\\" is a far more enjoyable listen, but theres some really great tunes on this one. <br /> <br />

The previews kind of made it look like a generic movie that everyone has seen dozens of times already.  Then it was released, and good press started to come in by the barrelful.  So I decided to check it out after all.  As the title of this review suggests, for the most part, this is a pretty good political thriller, but it kinds of runs out of gas at the end.  I don't know, maybe the writer couldn't come up with a good ending twist.  Whatever the case was, it's too bad, because with a better ending, this could have been a memorable classic in years to come. <br />Anyway, the story centers around Silvia Broome (Nicole Kidman), an African-born Caucasian who is filled with a desire for change in her homeland, but has chosen to do so with words rather than bullets.  She has become an interpreter for the United Nations (this is the very first movie to actually shoot on location at the UN building).  One night, while retrieving some of her belongings, she overhears some people discussing an assasination of a much-hated leader in Broome's home country. <br />When Broome reports this, US Secret Service assigns Agent Tobin Keller (Sean Penn) to protect/interrogate her.  Keller, while a very good agent, is a little on edge, due to problems involving his wife.  He is so ridden with angst and despair that he calls his own telephone number in order to hear his wife's voice on the answering machine. <br />As time goes on, the pair gets more and more involved in the conspiracy as people try to frighten them away from investigating the matter further.  Along the way, we discover some interesting facts from Silvia's past. <br />Both Kidman and Penn give great performances in their respective roles, and the acting is pretty good all around.  As I already stated, this is the first time that the actual interiors of the UN building has appeared in a movie, andthey are definitely a sight to behold.  The one thing is that the ending didn't really do it for me.  It seemed as if the writers took the easy way out instead of coming up with something truly shocking. <br />I guess I would still recomend this movie, although I do think that it is being slightly overhyped.
B00000099Y|4.0|Its just music, you do not need to open your mind and \\"trip out - man!\\" <br /> <br />Tools music is great, how and why anyone would compare them to a awful noisy band like the deftones is beyond me. <br />Aenima songs are alot more thoughtful and more moving sounding than the ones off Lateralus, so this must mean its there best. <br />Its bit of a mess of an album, alot of interludes, its meant to be that way, and its good if your into that sort of thing. <br /> <br />Overall, they're a very quirky and dark band, but thats good, it keeps everything ineteresting.
B000001Y42|4.0|this album has agreat sound to it. <br />Has a right mix of punk/hip hop i've ever heard. <br />It showed the band had a future. <br />Then Fred had to go and screw it up. <br />Fred just had to take the rap thing a little to far. <br />I can see what korn seen in the band at first. <br />But fred ran off wes whitch was a big part of why the band was so good. <br />This album will always be one of my favorites.
0451528956|5.0|Dr. jekyll and Mr. Hyde is a story of a struggle of good and evil within ones self. Jekyll is a scientist who has a evil side no one really knows about until a one Mr. Hyde appears. Hyde is the evil everyone fears and Jekyll is the man every one wants to be. It turns out they are one and the same. If you like mystery or science fiction, you'll love this book. Robert Louis Stevenson is a genius who got into his characters. This book is worthy of 5 stars.
0140277447|3.0|For those of you reading these reviews and wondering which hysterical side to believe, the answer is easy: neither. Chang did us a great service bringing this issue to light for the English speaking world, but she accomplished nothing new and still managed to make several serious errors. Ironically, she managed to play right into the hands of the Japanese conservatives by offering us shoddy scholarship on such an important issue. Many other works of higher quality lay untranslated in Taiwan and Japan (some in the PRC), but since they don't pander to Chinese nationalism, you don't know about them. After all, you have to have a market. <br /> <br />If you want an earful of what, exactly, Iris Chang got wrong, tune in to the Japanese right wing media circus. On the other hand, if you want to discredit the right wingers in Japan and their sycophantic followers around the world, just keep in mind that they've made an industry out of discrediting veterans who have come forward or provided damning evidence that the Nanjing Massacre took place. Veterans. Who were THERE. Recently a book by Ono Kenji was published with several diaries from Japanese soldiers from Fukushima who participated in the massacre, with oodles of evidence that it was a horrible incident. There is a lot of evidence in privately published documents (diaries, letters, memoirs) available in libraries across Japan and China to authenticate the Massacre (and many others, as well as \\"Comfort Women\\" and chemical/biological weapons testing and use). Ono's book, as well as plenty of solid evidence emerging every year (you don't have to go very far to find veterans in Japan who personally killed Chinese non-combatants) has buried the Japanese right. These sources also lead us to beleive that the Massacre didn't quite look like the way Chang, the Chinese government, and, more importantly, wartime Nationalist ideologues, described. <br /> <br />300,000 casualties is an absurd number, but only because it really depends on how you define the scope of the massacre. How long? Where? The Japanese right would exlude any death that wasn't written down by a general in the Japanese army, signed in triplicate, and published in at least three Japanese army sponsored propaganda channels. Chang would include any figure the Nationalists cooked up in Chongqing, or the opinion of some frightened, doltish foreigner hiding out in his imperialist enclave in Shanghai or Nanjing. Frankly, after reading Chang and many others, I just don't care any more. The point is: a lot of non-combatants died, and so did many other Chinese Nationalist soldiers, heroically defending their country from unwarranted imperialist aggression. One reason Chang did not sufficiently emphasize the efforts of the Nationalist Party to win the war for China is that it would piss off her cronies in the PRC, or, worse yet, require her to extensively examine Chinese language sources. Nevertheless, given the overwhelming evidence, the Japanese government has no excuse (but then, what excuse do we have after Iraq?).  <br /> <br />The Japanese apologized to China in 1995, and some comfort women have won cases in Japan. The real issue, as far as I can tell (the \\"real issue\\" keeps changing), is textbooks. The Japanese Ministry of Education is a notorious haven for insipid apologists. The PM did recently apologize to China again, incidentally, re-emphasizing the 1995 position. <br /> <br />Nanjing was only one part of a larger campaign of \\"punishment\\" against the \\"unrepentant\\" Nationalist Party. There is no reliable smoking gun to indict the Japanese army or wartime government for genocide, except that they told their men to win at any cost, and had no concern whatsoever for the safety of Chinese non-combatants. There was never any real program to exterminate the Chinese as a people, so the term \\"Holocaust\\" is inappropriate. The Japanese army, in effect, would kill resisters and anyone who got in the way. In Nationalist-controlled China, that is a helluva lot of people. They wanted to exterminate the Nationalists (and the Communists), not the Chinese as a people. If Chang knew anything about Japanese imperialism (which she didn't), she could never have made such a grossly inaccurate claim. <br /> <br />As I said before, this does not make Japanese aggression any less brutal. The Japanese were killing non-combatants from DAY ONE, and probably killed millions of Chinese people before 1945 (and the US effectively let them until 1941). Many Chinese did not submit (though many also did, including a prominent member of the GMD, Wang Jingwei) and many just got in the way (by not giving the Japanese all their food, or being in the wrong place at the wrong time). Anyone in Japan or in the US who claims otherwise needs to get a clue, or just stop lying. Learn Japanese AND Chinese, read published documents, conduct thorough research (no one on either side of this debate in high profile has really done so), or tone down the hysterics. The sad fact, poor readers, is that many of these people are talking heads with no real experience in historical research.  <br /> <br />That being said, for the neophyte, you might as well read this book. Keep in mind Chang DOES reproduce a lot of Nationalist propaganda and has no scholarly credentials (degrees or experience in archives), but this is because this issue was of extreme personal importance to her. The voice you get is just like the one you would have heard in 1938 from the Chinese Nationalist Party: shrill, inaccurate, and sometimes tragically ludicrous, but grounded in a horrible reality and an authentic concern for humanity.
0399143904|3.0|The premise of this novel is interesting enough...eco-terrorists want to cause an epidemic to wipe out most of humanity in order to \\"save\\" the environment.  Of course there are nutcases out there who would probably like to do just that, and as Clancy's novel postulates, it is not out of the question that some of them could conceivably put a plan into work to attempt something of the sort.<br /><br />This novel's strengths are Clancy's familiarity with military technology (as always) and his fairly good grasp of how Washington's power structure functions.  These strengths make this a fairly good read, despite the negatives.  The negatives are that this novel is at least twice as long as it needs to be, the storyline rambles, the terrorists are unconvincing, and the characterizations are not particularly good.<br /><br />All in all this is a good cautionary tale by a good writer who needed a stricter editor.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Amazon.com's \\"star\\" rating system makes rating Mel Gibson's \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" difficult.  Five stars, the top ranking, transaltes to \\"I Love It!\\"  It's hard to believe that anyone can watch this movie and have an \\"I Love It!\\" reaction.  Having just viewed the movie for the first time, I can attest that Gibson and team have made an amazing, top-notch film, but it's also a movie that I don't want to see again for quite some time. <br /> <br />\\"The Passion,\\" appropriately titled, focuses primarily on Jesus' (played with phenomenal range and conviction by Jim Caviezel) last 12 hours of life -- from the betrayal of Judas to his death on the cross.  Completely abandoning the sugary-sweet pablum of so many \\"traditional\\" religious movies, \\"The Passion\\" shows its characters as real-world men and women living in a hard-scrabble real world . . . raggedy beards, threadbare clothes, poverty, and none of the benign halos of self-knowing holiness that plague other depictions of Christ.  We get some flashbacks to isolated scenes, such as the Last Supper, some of Jesus' lectures, and poignant shots of Jesus as a child and also working as a carpenter.  But these incidents are short interventions in an otherwise streamlined narrative. <br /> <br />Jesus' betrayal by Judas is followed by aspects of Jesus' story that are largely unknown to Christians who attend church only at Christmas and Easter.  A \\"trial\\" by Jewish elders is followed by handing Jesus over to the Romans, who punt Jesus back to Herod for judgment (Pontius Pilate being savvy enough to avoid this hot potato).  But Jesus ends up back before Pilate and the elders demand the death of Jesus, whom they see as a dangerous rabble-rouser who is undermining centuries of holy teaching.   <br /> <br />The movie then turns to its most notorious aspects -- the torture and execution of Jesus.  While the gore is unrelenting, this is not mindlessly handled by Gibson and his team.  The extent of Jesus' suffering for mankind isthe precise point of the story, and it is impossible to watch this movie and not be affected.  This is a movie that brings Jesus' sacrifice home in the most powerful of ways -- by showing in graphic fashion how much the man endured and still managed to ask for man's forgiveness, \\"for they know not what they do.\\"   <br /> <br />This is a movie of powerful performances and visual artistry . . . for all its horrors, \\"The Passion\\" is a beautiful film.  The soundtrack is also understated, yet important - the few times I noticed it, I was moved.  And the special effects are perhaps too good - the violence unleashed on Jesus' body never looks cartoonish or unrealistic.   <br /> <br />I'll leave it to others to debate the charges of anti-semitism that arise from \\"The Passion.\\"  As a relatively uninformed observer, the movie appears balanced to me -- most of the Jewish elders demand Jesus' death (although there are a couple of elders who question this, but they are shouted down), but there are plenty of other Jews in the movie who decry what they see -- the problem is that they are outside the local power structure.  All in all, it doesn't come across as an anti-semitic movie unless one starts with the proposition that the movie tells an anti-semitic story.   <br /> <br />Few movies qualify as \\"important\\" in my book, but this one is right up there with Spielberg's two WWII movies, \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" and \\"Schindler's List,\\" as well as other flicks like \\"The Accused,\\" \\"Platoon,\\" \\"Mississippi Burning,\\" and \\"Ghandi.\\"  These movies generally aren't easy to watch, but they tell stories that I should know better, and they tell the story so well that it is seared into my brain.  \\"The Passion\\" is an unforgettable masterpiece -- it may be a couple of years before I feel the need to watch it again, but I'm sure that I'll remember every scene.   <br /> <br />A must-see.
B0002OERI0|5.0|WOW!  Thank you Green Day for being a band that actually challenges themselves to explore new realms and escape the norm of average pop music, not to mention making an incredible album while at it.  This CD was a nice change in tone from today's ordinary crap.  Good work guys.  A must buy!  Peace out!
B000002AGB|5.0|I listened to Live at Leeds based on the reviews that it was one of the greatest live albums ever. I listened to it, it was good. This cd has more energy then Leeds it appears, and the quailty of the cd puts you at the show. Ive only listened to 5 songs on the cd, and this is by far one of the greatest concerts ever put to a disc. The Who always amaze me, their songs are top notch and they can play as good and even better then Zepplin. I just hope im not disappointed by there late 70s, earlier 80s work.
0440213525|4.0|The book \\"The Client\\" is a mystery/adventure.  The other thing that's in this book is involves guessing. The book is really good if you like mystery and it gives you a good mystery. The book is about a suicide and a murder. It's about basically a true event that would happen to any of us. <br />It's about a man named Jeremy Clifford who was an attorney, who competent suicide. He kills himself because he couldn't take the pressure of his client and his client did murder a Senator, Burette. His client was Barry Muldanno. His was charge for murder and Clifford try's to prove innocent. When he was in the middle of killing himself, a boy named Mark Sway and his brother Ricky try to stop him. He does kill himself but before he does he tells Mark a big secret and the people who work for Muldanno go after Mark because Mark is attemped to tell the police what Clifford said. <br />The book has alot of foreshadowing. It keeps you guessing. But at the end it all worth reading the book and finding out what's happens in the end. There are clues that they give you and you think in your mind about what's going to happen. But then it will turn out if you are wrong or right.  <br />
B0000AM6LY|4.0|\\"Sunrise\\" , \\"Home\\" and \\"postiviely 4th street\\" are my three favourite songs from this album. Positively 4th street being the best. Not being a big fan of Simply Red  I didnt know what to expect.<br /><br />Sunrise was the single from this album and it features some really cool grooves and is one of the most catchiest summer songs I have heard in my life.\\"Home\\" suits the mood Mick Hucknell tries to sing about in this album.<br /><br />Positively 4th Street is an outstanding remake of the Bob Dylan hit. It features some really good vocals courtesy MH.<br /><br />What I disliked about the album is the fact that it lacked confidence.I like Pop/Rock genre but Simply Red are much better than ending the album the way did with this one.<br /><br />\\"you make me feel brand new\\" is a corny,unsingable song.However, if you liked this album , I recommend you George Michael's Patience and Simply Red - Greatest hits.<br /><br />Both are great compilations of songs sung with more heartfelt lives that only music comprehends.
0440213525|5.0|John Grisham is an awesome writer. He writes this book about a boy named mark that stumbles upon a suicide and tries to stop it, but he gets caught trying to save someone who doesn't want to be saved. The man who was trying to kill himself was Jeremy Clifford the lawyer of a man who was guilty of killing a senator, but wasn't convicted yet. Jeremy told mark something he shouldn't know. <br />   <br />   The dialogue was correct.  Little kids didn't talk like old people. Every thing was up to par nothing was left out. This book is really good. John Grisham did a good job on this one. <br />   <br />   I would recommend this book to any one who doesn't  want to waste their time reading a book that sucks. Because this one dose'nt. Over all this book was awsome. This is the first John Grisham book i've ever read  and beacuse of this book i'm going to read another. <br />
B0000640VO|5.0|The bad reviews for this movie are a bit funny--it's \\"cartoonish\\", it's immoral (there's a 5-second jab at Mother Mary), what is the main character thinking interfering with other people's lives and etc. etc. <br />The movie is fairly simple as far as plot goes, but it's presented beautifully, a free romp for the imagination for its own sake. It's made almost from a child's point of view and is the ultimate feel-good movie, but deftly avoids falling into condescension, a problem that plagues most movies of this kind. It teases itself and its characters--take for example, the scene when Amelie imagines her own death and the thousands whom she has helped mourning for her, or the fact that the 'prince charming' of the film is a clerk in a porn shop. The movie looks and feels like a daydream. Don't watch it for enlightenment or serious consideration of some important issues. Rather, treat it as a game, a game that the director has invited you to play with him, a game that is played simply because it brings joy.

B000001G7O|5.0|I am a little amused by the seemingly opposing views concerning this CD.  I proffer mine, which I hope may be helpful in some small way to those contemplating its purchase.  I think both criticisms and praise are valid but what matters ultimately I suppose, is the music and its enjoyment, which is purely a matter of personal tastes.   <br /> <br />My friend & I bought this CD some 10 years ago when I was buying some high-end hi-fi equipment and my friend was upgrading his.  We're not violinists or trained musicians.  We're just ordinary guys who love music and the electronics that reproduced it for our enjoyment.  We're not strictly into classical music but deeply appreciate some of it.  Back then, we've some CDs of classical piano, guitar but none of the violin.  The main reason is that we are so critical (or fussy if you like) of `reproduced sounds' that we have yet to come across any that meet our expectations and that can satisfy us.  We know it is extremely difficult, almost impossible, for a sound system to faithfully and accurately reproduce the sounds of a violin, next to the piano.  Very often, the sound reproduced comes across as what we like to describe as someone strangling, torturing or killing a chicken! (hear a beginner play and you'll know what I mean).  In this respect, we really wanted to have at least one representative CD of violin music in our collection so that we can use it to evaluate, audition, test a whole host of hi-fi systems to determine how good they really are.  When I first heard this CD on a very expensive sound system in a showroom, I immediately fell in love with it - it was the best violin music I've heard in all my years.  For this `review', I went back and listen to it again several times to confirm why I enjoy it so much.  Also, I've other CDs like Anne Sophie/Previn/VPO/DG (SACD), Akiko Suwanai/Kitaenko/MPO/Teldec,  Viktoria Mullova/Ozawa/ BSO/Philips and David Oistrakh/Ormandy/PO/Sony for comparison. <br /> <br />Why did I find this CD of the Tchaikovsky Concerto so attractive?   Without going into lengthy details I would say that:- <br /> <br />1.  The sound is clear and dynamic.  I can hear everything distinctly i.e. the soloist and orchestra, the very soft, slow as well as the very loud, fast passages.  The sound was not very warm and smooth but neither was it too cold or hard.  The balance was about right.  I consider the recording very good even if it could be better in terms of resolution.  On a good sound system, you can almost feel that Anne Sophie and the orchestra are in your listening room. <br /> <br />2.  Anne Sophie's playing was dramatic and griping.  She played like someone possessed and we, those hypnotised to follow her along deeper and deeper into the music, were unable to tear ourselves away.  The playing wasn't smooth, sweet, genteel and subtle but rather raw, direct, intense, engaging even exciting.  <br /> <br />3.  Some of the music played is very touching, moving.  I don't know how to explain this because I'm not a musician but there seems to be something that gives it a distinct Russian flavour.  Maybe it is the music itself or the instruments or the playing or all three.  The 2nd movement was especially beautiful and lovely.  It was filled with tinges of melancholy and sadness, tenderness and poignancy, reminiscence and nostalgia.  There was a deep sense of longing, like the desire to return to one's homeland and loved ones after a long period of absence. The sounds produced by the woodwind instruments was wonderfully airy which seem to make your mind drift into space.  All the feelings evoked are not something that I will forget or experienced again listening to recordings by other great artistes. <br /> <br />4.  The tone of the violin sounded good, even if it sometimes seemed a little bit brittle, harsh and sharp rather than full, smooth and `round' as compared to others.  I find that I can listen to this CD over and over again for hours without the slightest mental fatigue or strain on my ears - this at a volume that would send all my neighbours scurrying for cover!  I consider this is no mean feat having tried tens of violin CDs, even by famous artistes, and found that I couldn't stand the sound for more than 5 minutes!  This I believe attests to the high quality of this CD recording as well as the sound of the violin reproduced. <br /> <br />5.  The sound of some violins (or is it the playing) have this \\"crying\\", \\"wailing\\" character (check out Mullova's) which will tug at some heartstrings but which I personally dislike.  Others seem to be imbued with a smooth, full, rich, sonorous, `singing' or `ringing' quality (like Suwanai's) which I love.  Anne Sophie's somewhere in between I think and was therefore agreeably lovely.  Of course, this is all a matter of personal tastes like I've said. <br /> <br />So there you have it, some of the plausible reasons why people could possibly enjoy this CD so much and why it is reissued time and again!   I never grew tired of hearing it over the years, even after having acquired other recordings deemed superior in terms of performance and/or recording.  This is not a definitive recording but it is certainly a memorable one.  If you find that you're unable to enjoy, listen to it for long, then your musical taste is different else it's time to upgrade your sound system.  I think in the final analysis, Anne Sophie's wonderful talent and gift for music making definitely overrides minor technical failings.  Go get this CD as well as her newer and better version of this concerto on SACD.  Both are equally enjoyable....     <br />

B0001EFTVA|5.0|I loved this movie so much I watched it twice in a row.  Although very slow to start (my husband fell asleep) it is well worth watching and has an edge-of-your seat climax. The last third of the film is also quite hilarious.<br /><br />The story centers on three homeless people who have banded together during a cold, snowy, Tokyo Christmas.  There is Hana, an aging yet proud transvestite, Gin, a former professional cycler, and Miyuki, a sixteen-year old runaway teen girl.  Hana and Gin are Miyuki's adoptive \\"parents.\\"  Hana finds an infant girl, seemingly abandoned.  Rather than going to the police, Hana convinces the other two to try and locate the baby's mother, so Hana can ask her why she abandoned her child.<br /><br />The three set out, encountering a Yakuza boss on his way to his son's wedding, a Spanish-speaking hit man, a group of vicious teens, and many ghosts of their past that cannot be chased away, no matter how much running away they do.  Everything eventually hits the fan, and the end of this movie is moving beyond compare.<br /><br />This film has pervasive references to homosexuality, and has some very violent moments that convey the brutality humans are capable of.  But this is primarily a sensitive movie that shows the good people are capable of and encourages the viewer to look beyond a person's outer appearance. There is much crying in this film, and a close-up of babies nursing from breasts.  Anyone who is looking for anime in the way we have come to understand it will be disappointed.  This film is a story that could have used live actors or even been a stage play.  There is no magic except a Christmas miracle.  I think that is the best kind of magic.<br /><br />The DVD has a long and comprehensive making-of feature.  The director is interviewed by an executive in the Japanese film industry and by the voice actress who plays Miyuki.  The voice actors who played Hana and Gin also have a say.  The art and music is explored, as well as how the film played to a foreign audience (U.S., New York) and in Japan.<br /><br />One bone to pick: Hana's facial expressions and mannerisms are so over the top and drag queen cliche.  Is this the only way gay men can be portrayed in film, in the East as well as the West?U.S., New York) and in Japan.

Definitely a good one to pick up if you want the best of Eminem.
B000003TA4|1.0|Nirvana is the worst band the world has ever seen.  This impossibly $hitty band is the very worst of all that was wrong with popular music in the late 80s and early 90s--over distorted guitars, angry yelling, whiney lyrics about how miserable life is...Its just incomprehensible how incredibly horrible Nirvana was.  I hate it when people call that absolutely talentless @ss known as Kurt Cobain a brilliant songwriter.  Kurt Cobain a brilliant songwriter?  Is that when he's on cocain or heroin?  In the drug crazed world of the Seattle grunge scene, everybody was too stoned to realize that Kurt Cobain was nothing more than a dirty looking, no talent low life--out of his mind on drugs--who wrote inane lyrics while strumming the same 3 chords on his guitar.    <br /> <br />\\"Wow duuuuuuudes!  Kurt Cobain is a lyrical genius!  I can't understand anything he sings, so that must mean he's saying something profound.  Duh!\\" <br /> <br />Most blatently hypocritical of all is the fact that this whiney, noisemaking nitwit became a filthy rich, multi millionaire, even as he moaned and groaned about the evils of \\"selling out\\".  Nirvana fans, tell me this.  If Kurt Cobain really was so underground and hardcore, than why did he make so many videos for MTV?  Why did he perform live on MTV and Saturday Night Live?  Why did he have absolutely no talent?  Why did he sign a multi million dollar, major label record deal?  No answers to these and many other questions?  The answer is simple, Nirvana were not a real band.  They were just a corporate creation assembled in board rooms by fat, balding, cigar smoking buiseness men in suits and ties.  They were just an 80s version of the Backstreet Boys, designed to exploit a fad and separate a bunch of impressionable suburban teenagers from their money.   <br /> <br />Nirvana had no talent what-so-ever.  Anybody can string 3 or 4 distorted power chords togeather and add a bunch of brainless lyrics over them.  It doesn't take a brilliant songwriterto come up with \\"sell the Kids for food/Weather changes moods.\\"  Nirvana was just a blatent marketing scam.   <br /> <br />I have to admit, I once liked the corporate rock sellout band known as Nirvana, back when I was just a kid.  After all, I was 9 in 1994, when Kurt Cobain comitted suicide, in a futile attempt to compensate for his awesome lack of talent.  But I outgrew my dreadful obcession with Nirvana, and my old \\"Nevermind\\" casette has been gathering dust up in the attic, along with my Milli Vanilli, New Kids on the Block, Vanilla Ice, and Winger tapes.  All those groups togeather wouldn't even come close to being as bad as Nirvana.  I don't reccomend this dated piece of corporate rock trash to anybody.  Nirvana is so awful that their astonishing lack of talent can't even be imagined by anybody that hasn't heard them.   <br /> <br />Oh, and yes, go ahead and hit the \\"Not Helpful\\" button.  I don't care what you think!

The only match worth watching would have to be the main event triple threat which that wasnt even all that great either and possibly the Eddie/Angle match but overall this wasn't a good way to do the 20th year anniversary of the biggest show in the business, not at all impressed with it, most say it was one of the best and I dont see why but everybodys entitled to their opinion so judge this one for yourself but if you want my advice just borrow it from somebody.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is not only humorous, but its down-right flippin' brilliant.  I've watched Napoleon Dynamite numerous times and what impresses me more and more with each viewing is how \\"perfect\\" a movie it is.  Editing, filming, screenwriting - the whole \\"deelio,\\" as Uncle Rico would say.   <br /> <br />Hess displays an incredible economy with scenes and dialogue.  I'd be a bigger fan of \\"Indie\\" films (as much as I hate to use that stupid term), if more of them displayed the self-deprecating modesty and humility of Napoleon Dynamite, instead of their usual self-important preachiness. (Can you say, Vincent Gallo?) <br /> <br />In fact, I think that's a big part of the attraction of ND to people - the cast of goofy characters are more \\"real\\" and complex - the message, more universal, subtle, and poignant - than artsy fartsy films that try to be so deep and serious.  (Can you say, Vincent Gallo?) <br /> <br />Many of today's cutting edge film-makers think they impress us by pushing the envelope in their use of language, violence, and sex.  How about just impressing me with a GOOD MOVIE! <br /> <br />Keep an eye on Hess - he is a real talent.  The only problem is, he may have set the bar TOO high with his debut film.
B000929VKE|5.0|This is by far the very best movie I have ever seen!  It reminds me of my first love.  It is very real.  Everyone should see this movie.  It's rare that a film comes a long that can make this kind of impression.  It's not sappy (I'm not a fan of sappy) or corny.  It's just very real...and very worth the money.  I saw it in theaters and bought it the minute my local stores had it available for more than five minutes.  (It sold out as soon as it was put on the shelves.)  Buy it!
B00004RFCM|5.0|Okay, so I am a little behind. Since I don't have HBO I had to wait for it to come out on DVD (didn't want to watch it chopped up on TBS either). I just finished season 1. Now, I understand all the hype about it. This show is addicting. These girls are fabulous. It is so much fun watching them go through the many ups and downs of singledom (no pun intended ;)).
6305313687|5.0|In American History X, Derek Vinyard, a skinhead(Norton), is imprisoned for gunning down 2 black guys trying to break into his car. After his incarceration, his younger brother, Danny Vinyard (Furlong), writes a paper titled \\"My Mein Kampf\\". His principle is appalled, and having taught Derek, instructs Danny to write a paper on Derek. Throughout the movie, you see images and events leading up and during his imprisionment. He befriends a black inmate and gets brutally asaulted in the shower by a gang of white nazi skins he previously associated himself with. His younger brother gets invited to a party full of skinheads Derek knew. Some scenes are rather disturbing to watch but they play a vital part in the story line. In the end. while Danny is in the bathroom, his earlier good samaritain attempts at helping a young student from getting bullied by a couple of black kids backfires on him and the black kid shoots Danny. His paper on Derek was in his hand. Derek rushes to Dannys side at hearing word of what happened. This movie is truly compelling and gives a real life perspective of Skinheads in todays socity, and not just giving them a bad name
B0007OCG4W|1.0|I found this movie very boring and hard to keep up with. I just kept waiting for the ending. My favorite part of the movie was when the credits started rolling.
B0000DC13U|4.0|The coverage of the Rolling Stones in this movie is intentionally de-romanticized.  We only see the Stones in the awkward process of making a song; we never hear the song  finished, or even grooving--and we know that it did groove.  Be warned: it's not pretty, nor do the Stones even seem especially cool.  If you know what a rehearsing rock band usually looks/sounds like, you'll probably admit: my god, the Rolling Stones look like a band of young men putzing about and putting a song together--even as they made \\"Sympathy for the Devil.\\" While the film isn't conventionally \\"exciting,\\" it has some remarkable visual poetry in it.  The dated rhetoric in the explicitly political bits seems not to be the point, but the film's \\"point\\" may lie beyond that rhetoric, as the \\"complete\\" version of the Stones song exists only beyond these rehearsals,  after it gets its groove, after it hits radio, meets a mass audience,  and takes on a pop-mythic life of its own.   The Stones, though a big part of the film, seem finally to be a small element in a utopian meditation.  The movie is finally hard to paraphrase or verbalize, and I think that is to its credit: shouldn't some films resist recondensation into words?
B00005JO9J|5.0|Ok, I haven't seen the DVD's yet (since they haven't been released) BUT I have not missed an episode. I remember Patrick Dempsey from \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" but man, is he HOT now! The chemistry between Dr. Shepherd AKA \\"Dr. McDreamy\\" (Patrick Dempsey) and Meredith is off the charts. I also like the new romance between Cristina (Sandra Oh) and Dr. Burke (Isaiah Washington). If you by any chance missed this show rent the DVD's when they become available and Thank me later!<br /><br />**My husband bought me this for Valentines Day. I AM THRILLED to own this and have been watching it again. The bonus features are AWESOME! You get to see 19 unaired scenes.**<br /><br />Also, if you are a Katherine Heigl fan (Izzy) checkout \\"Love Comes Softly\\" and \\"Love's Enduring Promise\\" - Excellent movies starring her.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Let me just say that this album is without a doubt in my mind,a masterpiece. The Armenian wonders seem to have changed their style this time around, but at the same time have remained delightfully stable, maintaing the uniqueness that got themselves recognized in the first place. Catchy tunes such as \\"Radio/Video\\", \\"Lost in Hollywood\\", \\"Revenga\\" and the previously released \\"B.Y.O.B\\" deliver what may be the most pleasant shit ever to grace my ears.<br />System of a Down does not believe in fillers when it comes to constructing an album. This is made evident by the fact that every song on this album will thrill you, chill you and fulfill you. Considering that most bands as of late have left me LOW with new album attempts, I am pleased to report that System of a Downs' MEZMERIZE will blow your mind. Keep in your thoughts  also that the next record, HYPNOTIZE, will be hitting store shelves this Fall (Sept. 25 is the word on the streets).<BR>I've gotta go...
B00079FUI6|5.0|I am not a big tv person but I am so addicted to this show (and Grey's anatomy). I have yet to miss an episode. LOVE IT!
0440180295|1.0|To be utterly honest, I thought Slaughterhouse Five was really disappointing.  Prior to my reading experience, I heard from many former readers of the novel that it was excellent.  Hence, as my expectations were quite high, the magnitude of my dissatisfaction escalated when I realized the plot was so cluttered and random.  <br /> <br />Unlike other novels, throughout the entire course of the story, the main character travels erratically to dissimilar spheres of time.  Billy constantly goes back and forth into random parts of the past and his supposed future, leaving the reader confused as to how each portion is to correlate with each other.  I found these jumps in time annoying.  Yet, whereas the visits to his past are psychologically logical, the trips to his fabricated future are quite meaningless.  I especially had great difficulty digesting the part about Billy's abduction by toilet plunger aliens.  What is the significance of this particular part of the story? <br /> <br />Furthermore, another aspect of the novel that I found displeasing is its pessimistic tone.  Billy experiences the tragedy of war, the loss of his sanity, the loss of his colleagues and wife, the loss of true perception, and eventually, the loss of dignity.  How can one individual face so many hardships in the course of one lifetime?  Although he reaps the fruit of success in the initial years of his marriage and career, all of these things are completely disregarded with the traumatic episodes that occur afterward.  With Billy's tragedy in mind, I strongly believe that this story was way too dismal.  <br /> <br />Through my years of education, I have read many war stories as well as narrations of insanity.  Generally, with the two interconnected, novels normally comprise of characters and events that are realistic and rational.  Yet, in this particular novel, the author seems to overdevelop his characters and events pointlessly with ridiculous concepts.  While Vonnegut's introduction of BillyPilgrim's war experience is credible, the transitions that this character undergoes are absolutely absurd.  The later half of the book was just a collection of non-sense. <br /> <br />Overall, my perception of this novel is negative.  I found it strange, frustrating, and awkward.  Of course, I'm still thankful for the reading experience though.  Because of it, I discovered that not all stories are conservative.      <br />
B00009V7OR|5.0|First, let's address the bad reviews in this section; look at the grammatical errors, I wonder if in order to write well you have to like this movie? I'm just kidding there but this movie is a great piece of movie history. It is similar to Star Wars, and other science fiction movies, but that is the point, to many people think that it sucks for certain reasons because they are to stupid to listen to the lines in the movies. Example. Randy Quaid learns to fly the F-15 jet for the simple fact that he flew planes in Vietnam and did crop dusting. This is a great summer movie and one that you can bring to a friend's house and enjoy, you could probably bring it to a formal dinner party and become the biggest hit at the party! Trust me, I have liked this movie since I first saw it on TV and not I own 4 copies! That is how good this movie is!
B00000DFRS|5.0|I remember this album when I was in the 6th grade. I played this album out and I still do. Her vocals are a marvel of technical perfection. Equally at home with pop, R&B, or gospel, She exerted unprecedented control over her celebrated pipes, moving through a song like a graceful bird in flight. This quality made this album such a consistently satisfying work. She does not stick to any one formula and this album is all over the stylistic map. This album is a strong and varied collection. This album is a milestone in her career. This album is as diverse as her five-octave range. She swoops, she caresses she hip-hops and she bells. Never younger,more contemporary or more soulful. This is the best album she has ever made and solidifies her legacy and places in musical history. This album has been certified 3x Platinum. Remember,this was 1998-1999.
038542471X|4.0|<br /> <br /> <br />       <br />           The Book is The Client.The Client is about a boy that was Murdered and his brother Knows everything but he doesn't want to tell.Everybody want's to know what happen.He will tell nobody.not even his parents.I like it when he doesn't want to tell.What I don't like is when they keep asking him what happen even though they know he is not going to tell them. <br /> <br />          Other people should read this book.They could like this book onlyif they listen to it real good.The dialogue is unbelievable because it just keeps getting interesting sometimes it is boring but then it goes back up all the time.The Crook the one that murdered Mark `s Bother was supposed to act like that and that's why it is a good book.The people to where acting like they were supposed to and that's why that's why the book is interesting and then settles then goes back up again.So that's what making the reader keeps wanting to read it. <br /> <br />          I say the flashbacks come in when the other people asked him what happen his mind probably keep Going back to the murderer.So that's one of the reason he won't tell to, the more they ask the more he doesn't want to tell.There is a falling action to when the story goes back down to the boring parts.Then the Rising action is when the story goes back up.There is a turning point to when a new part comes into the story. <br /> <br />         The Character's were cool because every thing that is said about them was true about them.They acted the way they needed to,to get the story more interesting.The way some of the character's to were not acting the way they needed to.So that's probably way the story got boring.One other things to is that there were some characters but they didn't stay in the story it just said one thing about them and then that's all.So that's what some of the characters were cool to me. <br /> <br />         When the boy died then the whole story went wrong.The one thing that got me mad before he told somebody what happen.And the person he told know is going to tell so that's what got me mad.So the boy died because if he told he would got in trouble but one way or the or the other he would of got caught.So that's what I think the right thing to do is die. <br /> <br />        I think the author made a good story because it was cool to me.I will be good to others to.If they listen good like me they would like the story to.It had a lot of good parts to,to make the story cool.So I like it and that's why I like the book. <br /> <br />     <br />
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I remember this album when I was in the 11th grade. I love this album and I was so excited to get this CD. Britney's musical intensity and her evolution from a teen renegade into a provocative young woman are undeniable throughout this album. The CD shows her flexing notably strong and mature songwriting muscles. She co-wrote 7 out of 12 tracks. This album has been certified 2x Platinum. Remember,this was 2003-2004.
0975991477|1.0|As a scientist engaged in biophysical research, I feel the strong need to redress the many dangerous, erroneous, sophistic claims and attacks on science that Dr. Lipton is pandering to the public.  It would seem that Dr. Lipton is a well-meaning man, but I am afraid his departure from objective rationality is the equivalent of a man that has found religion and given his reasonings over to mere faith.  He states that environment has a profound influence over gene expression and that genes in and of themselves do not dictate biology.  He uses the word \\"epigenetic,\\" meaning above or beyond the genetic level.  Neither this term nor the idea that environment plays a role in biology however is new--and moreover there is nothing mystical about it.   <br /> <br />A case in point is the well studied model sea urchin gene called Endo16, which plays a very important role in the developing archenteron, or \\"gut\\" during the gastrula stage of larva development.  Endo16 is an amazingly intricate gene, its regulation controlled very precisely by certain modular components, which dictate when to activate the promoter region, which allows the cellular machinery that transcribes the genetic information into the code (mRNA) that in turn gets translated into actual protein.   <br /> <br />These modular, regulating components are extremely sensitive to the environment, and the environment serves as inputs, which then cause a series of logical responses of where, when, and in what amount the gene will be expressed.  The environmental inputs that play a role in regulation are various proteins, called transcription factors, which either induce or repress gene expression.  Temperature and pH level also play a role in the expression of many genes.  <br /> <br />Moreover, identical genes and cloned cells never behave identically.  This too is not owed to some mysterious mystical \\"conscious field\\" but rather to stochastic processes and noise inherent in the system, where a limited number of available transcription binding sites and competition with other proteins leads to a statistical range of possibilities.  What is amazing is that many biological systems have evolved an amazingly complex redressing of such seeming restrictions, leading to incredibly robust dynamics, meaning they can tolerate a wide range of changing environmental conditions.   <br /> <br />The rapidly emergent field of systems biology, still very nascent but making great strides and progress, is now integrating how genomes regulate single genes into a more encompassing organism-wide or so-called \\"cell-web\\" consideration.  Genes are not the only players.  The proteome, which is the set of all proteins at a given time is also important.  Also important is the metabolome, the entire set of metabolites that make up the metabolic chemistry of the cell.  There is even a more abstract consideration called the \\"regulome,\\" a term referring to how metabolites, proteins, and genes ultimately interact and dynamically play out over time.  The cell is an amazingly complex entity, and the integrative properties of how they interact leads to amazing synergistic properties!   <br /> <br />Despite having learned enormously from the Human Genome Project, Dr. Lipton attacks it as a \\"failure\\" for having mistakenly predicted that the number of genes in H. Homo Sapiens would be over 100,000 and asserts that researchers claimed the project would demonstrate the belief of \\"genetic determinism.\\"  Although it is true that the prediction of human genes was wrong, the Human Genome Project is far from a failure.  Quite the contrary!  It is one of the most incredible feats of human accomplishments-right up there with sending a man to the moon.  In fact, I would submit even more significant in accomplishment for the doors of continuous opportunities in research that is has now opened.  The project revealed two amazing things: 1) there are only around 23,000 genes in humans, and 2) so-called \\"junk DNA,\\" which comprisesthe majority of DNA and is non-coding (meaning it does not contain genes) is extremely important in regulating how the coding sections get expressed.  Moreover, the project showed the remarkably adaptive economy of human DNA.  The apparent dearth of genes is something of an illusion.  Although there are only 23,000 genes, these genes get alternatively spliced together, giving rise to much higher combinations of protein output that could not otherwise be achieved.  Lastly, no serious researcher involved in the Human Genome Project saw the project as the end-all of biology or seriously pushed for the notion of genetic determinism.  It was understood before the project finished that genes alone were not an end-all answer of biological functioning.   <br /> <br />Furthermore, Dr. Lipton claims that illness can be cured by mere belief.  This isn't only nonsense; it is incredibly unprofessional and irresponsible.  This is the equivalent of a TV Evangelist banging his palm against the foreheads of cancer patients, pushing them back down in their seats and proclaiming them cured, only to then say later to an investigating reporter who mentions that the patients later died that the Lord's magic stopped working because doubt entered into the hearts of the disbelieving patients.  What an incredibly cruel sentiment.  Yet this is in essence what Dr. Lipton is pandering to the public.  If conscious belief worked this way, bringing about the realities we wanted, then we'd all be six-feet tall, rich, and have the looks of professional models and possess super human strength and ability.  But where's the reproducible proof?  Alas, reality does not work this way.   <br /> <br />Lastly, I cannot commend Dr. Lipton for trying to merge science and spirituality together, for his attempt is based not on science-but anecdotal evidence and highly questionable research with no direct evidence or scientific proof.  What Dr. Lipton offers, then, is not a new science-but another new-age religion.  What is more, Dr. Lipton espouses quite frankly a ludicrous ideology.  The title of his book is \\"The Biology of Belief.\\"  Biology is a science, and as such it is built on a system of facts-not beliefs.  The Road Runner might levitate above a cliff and Luke Skywalker might levitate objects with his Jedi mind, but each respectively has Warner Brothers physics and Industrial Lights and Magic on their side.  For the rest of us, trying to walk on air by stepping off the balcony will prove a comical, if not outright fatal, flaw in reasoning.  I'm afraid gravity is not interested in what you believe of its consequential effects.  And all the deep, faithful believing of otherwise will not change the outcome. <br /> <br />Lipton however mocks science and the many dedicated men and women devoted in making true scientific progress and expanding our understanding of disease and the laws of nature.  To them, a debt of thanks is owed, for real scientific progress is made by them--and the only place belief has a place in that progress is the belief in the ability that we as a species can accomplish such marvelous, triumphant understandings of the world around us.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I just got this album in a week after it was released in April. I love this album. \\"Mimi\\" is her nickname. This album is an intimate portrayal of both the challenges and successes that she experienced during her rise to unparalleled fame. She is embracing her independence and celebrating the person that she becomes.  This album also offers more than glimpse into her world. This album marks \\"The return of the voice\\". She is poised to conquer new territory. Consistently evolving musically,personally,and creatively she will re-assert her claim as the best-selling female performer of all time with this album. This album should be promoted like her last album. This album will always be the year's top album hopefully.

0060751967|5.0|Shanna Whelan is a dentist whose life has turned upside down. After surviving a massacre by the Russian mafia, Shanna testified against them. Yet even the Witness Protection could not keep her safe afterward because those hunting her are vampires. Ivan Petrovsky is a Russian vampire determined to collect the bounty on Shanna's life. When Shanna is rescued by his nemesis, Roman, it becomes personal. <br />Roman Draganesti is the CEO of Romatech Industries. He is the creator of synthetic blood which has saved the lives of mortals around the globe. Unknown to mortals, he is also the master of the largest coven in North America and the synthetic blood is used by vampires so they have no need to bite mortals any longer. Roman's group is looking for ways to help mortals and vampires co-exist. So far, mortals are still unaware that vampires are real. It would be nice to keep it that way as long as possible. When Roman loses one of his fangs due to sinking his teeth into something he should not have, he goes to the only dental clinic open during the night. He finds the dentist fighting for her life and rescues her. But once Shanna fixes Roman's fang, how can she be sure her life will not be forfeit? <br />***** A spicy mix of good vampires, bad vampires, and the mortals who help them. I found this story to be fun, entertaining, and HOT, HOT, HOT! Author Kerrelyn Sparks brings the creatures of the night to life (pun not intended) and makes it seem realistic and normal. This author is a gem in the Super Natural genre. ***** <br />Reviewed by Detra Fitch of Huntress Reviews.
0743454537|2.0|There were many things about this book that were excellent. The topic of the book is timely and interesting.   Picoult's use of metaphor and multiple narratives kept things moving right along.  And unlike other's who gave this book a bad review because of the ending, I thought the ending underscored the point that everything can change in an instant.  While you're trying to prepare for one thing, something unforeseen can happen.  Life isn't fair, and that is one of this book's subplots.    Where she lost me was in the first 80 pages.  I nearly put the book down because of her use of unoriginal and annoying old wive's tales and urban legends inserted as fact.  What was that about?  Does she think her readers are stupid?  The story about the box of cigars being insured against fire damage is an urban legend, as is the tale of a tooth desolving in Coca-cola.  The story about fooling a nurse with apple juice as a urine sample is from a Normal Cousins book I believe.  And when someone has a seizure you don't put something in their mouth, and you certainly don't put your child into their car as a passenger since people with seizure disorders can't have a driver's license.    With all of those inaccuracies, I found myself not believing much of the other material that was presented.  If she couldn't bother to look up the veracity of the tooth in Coca-cola story, how do I know she looked up the medical facts that this book was based on?  That turned this book from a thoughtful presentation of both sides of a timely topic into nothing more than a cheesy romance novel.    The most believable character in the book was Jesse, but we don't see much of him, and he is miraculously \\"healed\\" in the last 3 pages, but we don't know how or why. I was also bothered by a lack of narrative from Kate.  I think it would be sensitizing to hear about how it feels to grow up with leukemia and know that your illness is having such a dramatic impact on the rest of your family.  We get a glimpse of this near the end, but so little during the first 400 pages that Kate ends up looking like an unsympathetic character.    If you like romance novels, then you will enjoy this book.  If you want to read something more meaty about the argument for and against stem cell research or designer babies, this isn't the book for you.
B00005AAFS|5.0|Mein Herz Brennt: One of my favorites. I can't really describe it, but the sample gets the main jist, and it alternates between slow and fast with increasing intensity throughout. <br /> <br />Links 2 3 4: Starting out with marching effects, this is a very rythmic song. Going exactly to the beat of the title (left 2,3,4 in english), this is another favorite song. Much better than what you might think from the sample. <br /> <br />Sonne: It starts with a cool transition (I won't spoil it) and changed gradually from heavy to mysterious. The lyrics are also very deep. <br /> <br />Ich Will: Rythmic like Links 2 3 4 and a bit creepy in the way it's played, I really enjoy listening to this one. <br /> <br />Feuer Frei: One of the fastest paced songs in this album. It starts slow and melodic, then it \\"explodes\\" to the rest of the song. <br /> <br />Speiluhr: Starts like a story time type thing, and the construction of the song can fit into a film intro. The chorus with the voice effects is also really good. <br /> <br />Zwitter: The construction is like Der Meister, and the tune is like Asche zu Asche, while the singing is like Der Meister and Laichzeit. Listen to these and you'll get the idea. <br /> <br />Adios: Another favorite, and very familiar at the guitar riff towards the end. It transitions a lot like in Mein Herz Brennt. <br /> <br />Mutter, Rein Raus, and Nebel: I really didn't enjoy these, so I didn't listen to them much, thus can't comment much. The lyrics are a turn off for me in Mutter and Rein Raus, and the overall pace of Nebel isn't enjoyable either. Others my disagree though, so just remember that.
1577314808|5.0|While Eckhart Tolle may not be as eloquent or intellectual as Alan Watts in illuminating the very same principles, maybe that is the point. Being too intellectual about these ideas is part of the problem for many of us. I have come to realize that just as we are all different, we all may need different teachers. Different aspects of their teaching styles can inspire different feelings and reactions in us.<br /><br />Arguing that Eckhart is a hypocrite is really beside the point. The teachings he restates here are ancient and timeless and we all know them to be true. Don't get bogged down by the messenger. We all know that no one reaches perfect enlightenment. If someone ever did it would be so powerful that they could transform everyone they came into contact with and this world would cease to be. (Believing that this physical world is just the manifestation of the journey from suffering to enlightenment.) Some say Jesus performed miracles and Buddha instantly transformed some souls, apparently this power comes on a continuum.<br /><br />Personally I prefer listening to audio tapes because there is more life force and its even less intellectual than reading. As per the teaching, you need to get out of your head, so using your head to get out of your head can be a problem. Alan Watts and Eckhart Tolle are also both hilarious in the spoken word.<br /><br />This book has already changed me in the week since I began reading it. I walk around lighter on my feet, am able to smile more readily, move less hurriedly, criticize the world less often.<br /><br />I highly recommend reading or listening to this book. :)
0743454529|5.0|I thought this book was amasing. Being a lawyer the issue of a girl taking her parents to court for the rights to her own body was one which interested me and the book was actually recommended by a friend. After the first chapter I was hooked.  I couldn't put the book down.  And every so often, without having noticed, I would realise I was crying! The way the book is written keeps the story going and lets the reader see the problem from all angles. I absolutely love this book and is now one of my all time favourites.  There are a few twists along the way and a very powerful and unexpected ending which makes this book a great read. I would recommend this to anyone...but read it with a box of tissues!!!
B00081PPX8|1.0|Stargate Atlantis is a wonderful series and absolutely worth buying on DVD - BUT NOT FROM THIS CLOWN. This is a bootleg burned DVD set taken from TV.  It's probably crap quality, it doesn't have any extras and it's illegal for this guy to do this.<br /><br />Save your money and do the right thing. Buy it when it's released by MGM later this year.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Don't watch this movie on a full stomach as the scenes are so funny, you may hurt yourself. A great movie that is sure to be a comdey classic, this movie was highly successful at the box office and is one you'll want to see at home over and over again. Good soundtrack, I highly recommend.
B0000073I5|5.0|For anyone who loves Genesis and pines for the days when musical composition meant being transported to another world - this is your album. If you've ever wished Genesis had put out an album that you somehow missed, this is a good bet. Nothing will quite replace the entire band - especially in its heyday - but you'll wonder how you missed this gem. If you disparage the current state of pop music, get Smallcreeps Day.<br /><br />Typically, I don't like solo albums because there's something missing from that magical eclectic nature inherent in the collaboration of aggressive composers. Of course, it's personalities, musical convictions and plane crashes that pull bands apart. I'll bet you could actually chart the cycles every creative band goes through... something like extreme creativity and daring, becoming discovered and building on gelled formulas (getting a sense of oneself), then in-fighting, solo albums, parting members or total breakup, and finally reunion concerts for sentimental fans. However, \\"the three\\" remaining warm my heart in their longevity as a band. I'm personally stunned at how good most of the members of Genesis' solo albums have been: Banks, Hackett(!), Rutherford and Gabriel. I'm truly thankful for Collins' energy as he stretched the band, but I'm less pop and more artrock. But, I digress.<br /><br />Someone commented on this forum that Smallcreep sounds dated. The only thing I can think of that would qualify is an annoying, vintage synth drum (novel at the time), but even that is diminutive. Hey, it was cool then! The melodies and chord structure haunt me after 25 years and I'm certain will continue for my remaining years.<br /><br />Lastly, this album has repeat-listenability. I never tire of it. Whenever it randomly appears on my iPod, I'm tempted to turn off the Random Mode setting and listen to the perfect sequence as a medley effect. I love this album, and I'll bet most of you who've read this far will too, and will wonder how you missed it all this time.missed it all this time.
0440213525|3.0|The Client is about a boy named Mark who got himself in deep trouble because he lied to the authorities about not witnessing or knowing anything about the case.  The police had a hunch that Mark and Ricky knew about the event.  Mark was the only person that really knew about what was going on.  Mark was reluctant to tell anybody the story because he was afraid of what his mom or what the `mob' would do.  Other than Mark, Reggie was the only other person that knew about the issue. Reggie Love was Mark's lawyer.  Reggie had agreed that she wouldn't tell a soul about what she had just heard, but later on they took in into court after the police took the questioning too far. To find out what happens next you will have to read the book. It has  dialogue in it like when Reggie love was talking to mama love about what happened.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|I never thought I would ever hear a work that melds North African music with the blues quite so well as this album does. It's almost uncanny in its naturalistic approach to the diverse sounds of all the myriad of influences that have made Robert Plant what he is today. Not once does the blending sound forced at all; and that is what amazes me. <br /> <br />Often when musicians try to blend a diversity of sounds it may sound great, but you can still hear the seperation between the different types of music...this is simply not so on Mighty Rearranger. In fact I dare say that it is aptly named; it sounds like a brand new music yet at the same time it sounds like a music that has existed for ages. It's like comparing a patchwork quilt with a solid piece of cloth: the usual patchwork feel of an attempt to combine diverse influences is avoided and instead it just feels like one solid piece of perfect cloth.  <br /> <br />It all comes down to three factors for me: Plant chose an amazing outfit to realize his vision. It must be kept in mind, above all things when listening to this disc, is that it is not so much a Plant solo effort as it is a collaberation. In fact, being so deeply familiar with all of Plant's solo material, I can tell you that this has him placed more as a memeber of an outfit than as a featured artist. These men work together in an almost surrealistic way. It's as though they had been playing for years together; each knows exactly what the requirements of the songs are and their musicianship is of the highest order. They really do sound that perfectly locked into place. The atmospheric keyboard work, the lush guitar arrangements, the soild and well-tempered kit drumming combined with the North African tar work all come together in a way so natural that you might be onclined to forget you're hearing such an array of influences. In fact, to the layman it would be nearly impossible to be able to pick and choose which sound comes from what place. It's interesting to hear a bendir work so tightly with a drumkit that one may not even be able to discern where bendir begins and drumkit ends. The beats are often in odd meters and slightly polyrhythmic, but never once sound forced. The guitar work takes blues into the desert in such a way that you might not even notice the semitonality placed effortlessly into the blues scales, and North African fingerstyles being used to play distinctly blues or rock riffs. <br /> <br /> <br />The second would be the simple and yet effective songwriting which lends itself easily to almost any format. It is certainly true that no matter how interesting or originally conceived an idea may be, without a good melody and singable lyrics not many people will want to listen for too long. I believe that Plant proved the adaptability of a good, simple and well-written song in the UnLedded days. This album carries that tradition into new directions.  <br /> <br />The third is the sheer atmosphere of the whole thing. It is beautifully recorded. I dare say that even the most negative listener would still have to admit this album has a sound that really sets it apart from the crowd. The acoustic intruments sound full and very natural, and at times are electronically manipulated to create new and interestingly luch textures without sounding tacky. The electronic soundscapes are perfectly subdued and blend with the acoustic sounds much in the way that diverse musical influences come together. Again, this album is aptly titled. <br /> <br />Now my only disappointment to admit is that I don't feel all of the songs live up to a quality that makes me want to listen to them intently. Plant is certainly not resting on his laurels, but I couldn't help but feel from time to time like Robert was just simply sounding like Robert. Now as a fellow musician I hate faulting people so do not assume that is what I am doing. In fact, I often get very upset whenever someone uses this website just to say they don't like something and so no one else should give it a chance. (I personally don't like peanut butter.) Everything is a matter of personal taste. I just personally don't like the usual blues-rock sound, and so a good deal of material on this disc just doesn't do it for me personally. But you might love it; and I wouldn't blame you. It's quality material. Give it a listen. <br /> <br />
0060574216|4.0|It's basically a worse case scenario handbook. If you're needs aren't being met, you don't feel understood, you feel smothered or things are just intense and unhappy. It points out all the major buttons that could be setting you or your partner off and how to quit pushing them.<br /><br />There are so many points that have hit home for me. It's a great relief to know his and her behavior is 'normal' and there's an explanation for it. Why men have caves, and women have wells. How our motivations in relationships are different and how to use it to our advantage. It has some great kiss and makeup techniques along with a dialogue translator.<br /><br />I must say I have a love/hate relationship with this book. I've seen great benefits in my understanding of the opposite sex and relationships with them from it. Most relationships go through rocky times and this book could keep drama down to a minimum.  Although, In my heart, Life has to get better than what this book describes.<br /><br />John Gray also has books for more specific aspects of relationships, read this one first for a better understanding.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book for singles looking to improve their relationship skills and couples that fight, have drawn battle lines, or desire meet each others needs more harmoniously.<br /><br />Four out of Five for handling a topic with excellent precision, minus one for noticeable repetition.
B0000640SB|4.0|You'll get a kick out of this sci-fi comedy/adventure starring Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith.  Since I'm a little late on reviewing this film(it's been out for awhile now), I won't delve too deep into the premise of the film.  Just know that Jones' \\"Kay\\" character handpicks Smith's \\"Jay\\" character to replace him and they form a hilarious odd couple with Jones playing the straight man and Smith being the goof-off.<br /><br />\\"Men In Black\\" provides plenty of laughs and action for even the toughest sci-fi critic.  Smith does an excellent job without coming across as smarmy as he did in \\"Independence Day.\\"  Jones' no-nonsense character is the perfect foil to Jay.  Rip Torn does a good job as Zed and Linda Fiorentino is good as the coroner in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Vincent D'Onofrio also does a good job as the big, bad bug.  Some of the biggest laughs come from Kay's encounter with an alien informer who hides out as a dog and Tony Shaloub's performance as an alien peddler with a pawn shop.<br /><br />The action is spread throughout the film at perfect intervals, often with great comedic sidelines such as the \\"noisy cricket\\" and Kay and Jay's drive through the tunnel in what Jay refers to as a \\"Ford POS.\\"<br /><br />Overall, a really fun movie to watch multiple times.  The language is mild for the most part, although a few words slip here and there.  Some of the alien action might scare younger viewers, especially the big bug conflict at the climax, but there isn't anything here that would scare children over ten.  I'll leave that up to the parents.<br /><br />Check it out for some good sci-fi fun.
B000000I0I|4.0|After years of noticing this album in the stores & only being vaguely curious about it, I finally went & got it recently & am wondering now why the hell I took so long! Like most, I discovered Mike Oldfield through Tubular Bells (via 'The Exorcist', for that matter).  <br /> <br />The liner notes on the most recent remaster of Hergest Ridge quote Oldfield: \\"HR is a completely different kind of record from TB; more folky & orchestral.\\" Here's where I'd have to disagree. I hear nearly identical structure in both pieces & nearly the same atmosphere. Oldfield didn't stray very far from the formula that made TB so successful with this one. Having said that, those traits are precisely why I enjoyed HR so much! I was looking for a \\"TB 2\\" and in effect, that's what you get on HR.  <br /> <br />I think what separates HR from TB is that it stands out on it's own without it being associated with a movie and also it lacks TB's somewhat dark aura. Part One has a \\"healing\\" ambience about it. The first few minutes of Part Two almost sounds like the background music for a fairy tale story being read aloud. It then shortly turns to an \\"impending evil\\" feel and then we get the 6-odd minutes of chaos at around the 9:40 minute mark. This is the part of it I think could've been much shorter. Goes on a *bit* too long as it's repetitive. But it comes to a beautiful resolution with the \\"fantasy language\\" being sung, yet with a hint of uncertainty on the lingering minor chord. \\"Does good triumph?\\"  <br /> <br />This album is a must-have if all you own is TB.  <br />
B0007YMUZW|4.0|First off we must stop comparing Ryan Adams Latest work with those of his past, simply because those songs are classics their a staple of alt-rock. The  songwriting, melody, and atmosphere can never be outdone. They are damn near perfect. This latest work is resemblent of those earlier works. Some songs are well put together and and great to chill and listen too, others are not but overall the feeling is still their and he is still Ryan Adams.- <br />                          Q <br />
0395389496|5.0|I generally think that books are better than the movies that follow them, and this book is fantastic, but with the marvelous graphics film-makers use nowadays, the movie was mind-boggling in its beauty and sheer magic! <br />What a ride!!! This author is sheer magic, too! <br />Reviewer is the author of THE TOONIES INVADE SILICON VALLEY
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been a Green Day fan since Kerplunk. I love their style of punk, whether its called \\"too poppy\\" by some or not. <br /> <br />I bought this record when it was first released and listened to it in my car for, like, 6 weeks straight. No radio, no other CD's. I just couldn't get enough. And it's not like I've gotten sick of it since. It's still very high on my car CD player rotation. <br /> <br />It is less punk than their previous endeavors, possibly. But they've successfully created softer-sounding tunes with the same edge as before that are likely their most \\"politically-motivated\\" to date. I don't necessarily think their songs are \\"political\\" (like Bad Religion, for example.) But they are socially significant. The fact that the songs flow with a \\"plot\\" makes the album a must-have. Hearing a few singles on the radio doesn't cut it. Listeners need to hear the whole story as it's meant to be heard...in order 1-13. <br /> <br />It is so melodic, which makes the softer edge more enjoyable and meaningful. It sounds cliche, but I called this Green Day's \\"masterpiece\\" within the first few rotations in the CD player. It's moving and fun and should not be ignored.
B00005UEAR|4.0|After Scenes from a Memory, i wondered how DT would ever follow it up. They made a pretty good attempt with six degrees, but it suffers from some pretty forgettable songs. The first CD starts out with probably their heaviest song, Glass Prison. It is a pure visceral romp from there, with great riffs and awe-inspiring lyrics. all of the instruments are well represented here, but unfortunately nothing as memorable as scenes. The rest of the first CD, save Glass Prison, is sadly boring. The second CD, however, is fantastic, but the fans may not like it as much, on account of it is a much more orchestral, instrumental adventure. No crazy rock here, maybe 10 minutes of the whole song, which is 45 minutes. They manage to achieve a great, large, powerful, upbeat sound, with some dark moments and back to more upbeat sounds. I personally like it but if you love DT's really heavy prog stuff, you probably wont like it. It is very good for an experimental album, but if you are new to DT, try Scenes from a Memory first.
B0007GAERG|5.0|As a Mariah fan since day one, I'm somewhat biased about her. I am very much a Mariah apologist, if need be, mainly because of her almost overwhelming vocal talent for which I have a great deal of respect and admiration for.  That said, I'm excited to see her get the well-deserved  critical acclaim her new album is getting - and the album requires no apologies. Upon noting that L.A. Reid co-exec produced with her - the first time I believe they have worked together, I knew the project was going to be special. I concur with Mr. Kingsley's critique -this album may in fact be her best work. \\"We Belong Together\\" is Grammy Song of the Year material - I have listened to this song countless times and have not tired of hearing it - that's always a sign to me of brilliance (lyrics, rhythm and vocal arrangement, and just the \\"way\\" she sings this song all come together on this track - a very powerful ballad). And the Kanye West joint \\"Stay the Night\\" and the Neptunes' \\"Say Something\\" are equally brilliant. Throughout her productive career (3rd all-time in sales behind only the Beatles and Elvis), Mariah has distinguished herself as one of the most talented lyricists in popular music and this album is no exception. The album also showcases some of Jermaine Dupri's best work.  All in all, a strong album of the year contender and a fine testament to the talents of one of the all-time greats. Thank you Mariah.
0385513755|5.0|The Da Vinci Code by Dan Brown was a book of excellence. It contained all aspects of a thriller with interesting theories regarding Jesus Christ, Mary Magdalene, and the ignorance of femininity within the church. The book was well paced and had quite a bit of unexpected surprises. However, it is true to say that the book did have certain gray areas that remained a mystery such as the ignorance of femininity in churches. As few other reviewers have already mentioned, churches regarded feminine such as Virgin Mary with high honor and respect. To create the church in such a negative viewpoint where it has strong gender discrimination seemed very irregular. However, the book is fiction and thus I think there were many different twists and turns along with opinions included within the story. The plot was indeed amazing and with the different codes and the theory behind the Holy Grail seemed very realistic. For example, the fact that the message \\"O, Draconian Devil! Oh, Lame Saint!\\" was in fact an anagram for \\"Leonardo da Vinci! Mona Lisa!\\" was pure genius. Codes like these that created curiosity and a mysterious atmosphere was probably the center for the powerful attraction that the book gave upon readers.
B0007GAERG|5.0|i think mariah's music in general took a turn for the worse when she was preoccupied with making movies......her new album the emanipation of mimi blends the old \\"good\\" mariah with a 2005 style...great blend of power ballads and hiphop beats.... <br /> <br />quite possibly her best album yet
B0000AUHPB|3.0|Overall, the movie is ok except for the ending which is like a cliffhanger.  It's like a Hitchcock movie letting you figure out what happened at the end.  I like the new remake (2003) which is a lot better!
B00005O3VC|5.0|possibly the most funny \\"random\\" style comedy ever made, this is just as good as it gets in terms of monty python movies.  there are some people who, surprisingly, don't get it (I am a member of generation y, where the main complaints seem to come from).  If you haven't heard of Monty Python  or are not a fan of british comedies in general, you are in for a big surprise.  I won't ruin any of it for you, just go get this, whoever you are.  And also get Life of Brian and, if you like those movies, The Meaning of Life (which is a lot weirder, more controversial, and not as strong a movie.  but it is still good, if you can get past all of the offensive material and are older than 18!)  I would say that this is the only Monty Python movie the whole family can watch.
089898890X|5.0|This book is awesome for the beginner.  I started with the first comping ideas and found myself progressing faster than all of the years of trying to play jazz.  To play jazz, one must understand its theory, and this book brings it. If you are interested in drums, and jazz drums, you gotta get this book and learn how to comp! In the CD, the author plays all the ideas in the book, which helps you to learn how to read and how each exercise should sound. Shish, Boom, Bang. Amazing!!
B000002MFN|4.0|At present, Madonna's Erotica cd can be purchased edited in stores.  I have listened to the edited cd, which largely means that I do not have the song, Did you do it?  Except for Where life begins, all of the other songs are actually good.  Some of the standout tracks include, Bye Bye Baby, Deeper and Deeper, Waiting, Thief of Hearts, Words, Rain and In this Life.
B00005B36H|5.0|Yes, there is NO WAY to describe this masterpiece, created by masterminds. This one is for a lifetime!
B000002MUW|4.0|When I listened to Bedtime Stories I was impressed with the music.  Some of the standout tracks include Secret, Human Nature, and Take a Bow.  If you are a fan of Madonna's earlier cds, I would strongly recommend that you purchase Bedtime Stories.
B000002HMH|3.0|I would give this CD a higher rating it it weren't by Metallica. <br /> <br />The songs are pretty good, but we all know what the band is capable of, so I had to ding it a little. <br /> <br />I recommend this to non-fans, but you will be VERY disspointed in it if you ever listen to Ride the Lightning or Master of Puppets.
038542471X|5.0|Small Town Danger <br />John Grisham has written an amazing book called the Client it is very exciting. It takes place in a small quiet t own. The main character is a small town boy by the name of Mark Sway. It is a very interesting book. I really got into it. It has danger, excitement, and a lot of interesting people. It was a lot of fun reading this book.                                                 It was so interesting that I could actually see all the people the imagery was great. I could see when Mark was in the courtroom on the bench while he was being questioned. The dialogue was good but Mark Sway sounded too much of an adult, He was only eleven in the book but in the courtroom he took the fifth not all little kids know what the fifth is. Other than that it was good. The foreshadowing was not in the book it didn't really tell us any little clues but it gave it a mystery behind it which was very good it helped to keep you on the story so that way you wouldn't be uninterested in the book. <br />I strongly recommend this book. It was exciting, thrilling, funny, and everything a good book should have. I loved it was awesome! I fell in love with the book the second we started reading it. <br />
0767803434|5.0|This is my favorite Harrison Ford movie and I am a big Harrison Ford fan.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|Star Wars was a film that not only succeeded as an entertainment but was a breakthrough. It was film that brought Science Fiction into the main stream. It also changed the role of female leads. Before Star Wars the role of the female lead in an adventure flick was to be rescued. To hang around looking tense until a male character sorted things out. Star Wars had a heroine who not only grabbed a gun and started shooting, but who was no stranger to control and exercising authority. The film also had one of the more original villains, Darth Vader.  <br /> <br />At the time the films success was seen to be the result of state of the art special effects. But the reality is that on top of the effects there was a tightly written script with dialogue that contained some humour and wit. The musical score was also important in developing the mood of the film. It has one of the most effective scores since Siegfried.  <br /> <br />Yet the success of the film lies in the plot density and the degree of invention and originality of scenes. If one looks at modern science fiction or action films it is unusual to see the degree of invention that occurred with Star Wars. Consider for instance the franchise competitor Star Treck. Star Treck films usually show a mock up of a space craft and then scenes set on something which looks like earth. Blade runner used the one set. Star Wars opens up in space but after that it does not stop. Lucas is a director who excels in tableaux.  With characters we open with Darth Vader but we quickly move on to two robots who will be the main vehicle for developing the plot. Shortly after we have a race of dwarf mechanics, sandmen and their animals, a bar full of strange musicians, a weird enforcer. The settings move from space to a desert planet and back to space. The visual variety of the film and the plot density more than cover any of the weakness of the dialogue.   <br />The film is also set in a rational universe. A central government is trying to exsert control over what was once a less authoritarian system. It is using military force to subdue the parts of what was a republic so that an empire can be consolidated. The plot is centred on the deployment of a weapon so powerful that it can decisively tip the balance in favour of the emperor who we do not see but only hear about.  Of course it was unusual that the events which occurred so long ago in a galaxy so far away so mimic out history. The term emperor for instance was one invented by Rome's first emperor Augustus. He used it as a propaganda move to avoid the hostility to the term king. Princess is another one of Augustus' inventions but developed later to refer to an emperor in training after the Empire was split into a Western and Eastern Section. However one should not be to picky in looking at the semantics of a film.   <br /> <br />It is interesting in the light of subsequent films that Darth Vader at this point does not seem that important. He takes orders from a character called Grand Moff Tarkin. Darth Vader has certain supernatural powers. He can strangle people through a thought process. However he is a person who appears to be on the way out. The other characters ridicule him in one scene and it appears a world in which technology is dominant and his skills are no longer in demand. <br /> <br />The end of the film was based on the battle of Britain. Lucas apparently used historical footage of second World War aerial dog fights to set up the last scene. It is a ants v elephants battle in which the ants through the use of careful targeting are victorious.  <br /> <br />At the end of the film the empire's special weapon has been destroyed, one of he main characters who appeared initially somewhat self-centred has shown his devotion to a higher duty and all the plot strands have been tied up except for Darth Vader who has lived to set up a sequel.  <br /> <br />
0812550757|5.0|I found this book amazing.  It is not as fast-paced as Ender's Game, but it is certainly at least as engrossing.  In the two days it took me to read this book I neglected almost everything else in favor of spending hours reading.  The length is wonderful, as my only complaint with Ender's Game was it's short length.  I feel that there is develpoment in this book that surpasses many things I've read.  Card manages to portray a very complex Ender, with his own emotions of guilt and his work as a Speaker for the Dead.  However, even superior to Ender's own character is the marvelous portrayl of how other's see him;  On one hand he is reviled as the worst person in history as Ender, on the other, as Speaker for the Dead he is almost worshipped by some.  At its heart the book deals with good and evil;  how it blurs, how people act upon their perceptions of them, and, ultimatly, how different cultures and people percieve them differently.  Not only is this book meaningful, but it is also an engrossing read.  When I finished I almost started it all over again, and I probably would have if I had not had Xenocide at hand.  Card is an amazing writer, taking his readers to a different place and letting them see how humans and those called \\"ramen\\", or a different species that humans can relate to, interact, with misunderstandings but also, ultimatly, acceptance and even rapport.
B00070Q8DQ|4.0|Truth be told, this is probably my first true death metal record. Im not a fan at all of heavy growling voices such as this (which xplains the 4 stars). The music I usually listen to are Sabbath, BLS, In Flames(old), Metallica(old), Mastodon, and others. But seeming that I listen to classic rock almost everyday and a dose of real heavy metal sometimes, this was refreshing. While metalcore bands pollute the music scene now (norma Jean, As I Lay Dying), a true blow of brutality struck me... Feeling in the mood for something hevy, I downloaded the album of the net. And lo and behold, it is indeed a musical apocalypse. Start to finish, this album RULES. Sculpting the Throne, Conquer All, Slaves Shall Serve, and The Reign... are the best cuts of the album. Very tight playing, musically complex, and plain brutal, start to finish, you will love this album.
B0000AMRJD|4.0|This movie is really something as the title of my review states that should be watched. Pacino gives a great performance as Tony Montanna. He also makes you feel the characters struggles, pains, and sucesses. Without ruining the story like so many reviews do, He was one of the thousands of people let go by dictator Fidell Castro. He rises up from being homeless in a refugee camp. The only off thing about his performance is the accent. However how can you expect an Itailan Actor to be able to do a decent cuban accent. It doesn't really throw the movie off that much but when you hear how his Hispanic friends talk you may think about it for a little while. Overall the movie is great. First of all let me just make something clear. It is NO Godfather(I think Pacino's best work) but it is something that you must give 3 hours of your time to. Pacino takes you on a thrill ride that shouldn't be missed. However even though it was released in 1983 the movie meets the standards of Profanity and violence as todays movies do(Maybe a little more then todays movies) so really don't let your kids watch it if they are young. But to a 14-15 year old its nothing they haven't seen before.
B00004XOWM|1.0|Who's worse? <br />Limp Bizkit or the 6 million Americans for buying this album and making them so popular. Lets face it, in their heyday you all loved them really. Thanks for letting another excuse for music pollute the world America.
B0002KVUKM|1.0|Usually I don`t give a (...)about a bad movie I've seen but this stood out from all that big budget crap by beeing one of the most poorly directed hollywood films I've recently seen. Lots of nonsense action loaded in it`s 2 hour duration(which is way too long for this genre). And when the script icludes ideas such as \\"Vampire eggs(?)(almost similar to the eggs in Alien-movies) that needs to be electrified by using power from the Frankensteins monster itself...\\", it`s just sad that any studio has showed green light to project like this.   Eventhough someone could manage watching this dispiting that the script seems like to be written by a 10-year old boy, it needs to be said that also the character and set desing showcases the total lack of talent. Not for people over the age of 12.   For the only one in this film why did Van Helsing(played by an australian actor) have to sound like an American? The story was set in Europe and everyone else had at least a brittish accent...
B00005JL78|3.0|When i was reading the review down below about this film being better than 'The Matrix', the soda I was drinking sprayed from my mouth onto my screen as I was paralyzed by laughter. Minority Report is a boring, complicated, and almost cliched story. While I feel the premise is good, I feel too much of the movie was talk, and they did not show enough of the futuristic Washington D.C. The parts they did show didn't look futuristic enough and looked too much like modern-day. And the story, is no more than a sci-fi remake of 'The Fugitive', and not a very good one, at that. While this movie has it's moments, I feel it's not mind-numbingly violent enough, like the Matrix was, and Tom Cruise is an awful choice for the role. Why must Hollywood insist on casting wimpy actors like Cruise instead of somebody with backbone, like Hugh Jackman.
B0002IU988|5.0|What a joy to hear new hard rock with great vocals, slashing and grinding guitars and pounding drums.  Why aren't there more CDs like this? <br /> <br />I enjoyed the Creed years but I really like the new path being forged by Alter Bridge.  If you thought Creed was maybe going a little too pop, then you will love this album.   <br /> <br />There are a few good ballads on the album, but for my ears, I really enjoyed the harder, edgier songs like Find the Real, Watch Your Words and Shed My Skin.  And what a great climax in \\"The End is Near\\".  I didn't see that coming at all and it slammed a punctuation mark on the whole album. <br /> <br />Definitely one of the top hard rock CDs of the year.
B000001H00|3.0|Bach is my favorite composer, and of all Bach's works, the Goldberg Variations, and these solo violin sonatas/partitas, are my \\"desert island\\" works. I've listened to many recordings of these sonatas/partitas, from Yehudi Menuhin to Jascha Heifetz, Grumiaux, Perlman, Podger, and others. Milstein's survey from the 1950s on EMI stands as my favorite, in comparison with his DG rendition in the 1970s.<br /><br />I had a conversation with one of the editors of the Penguin guide about these recordings, and Milstein was also his favorite, but he preferred the 70s DG version for reasons of sound quality and technical brilliance. I countered that the EMI Milstein set from the 50s was superior for the depth of insight brought to these pieces. Nathan Milstein was in his absolute prime when he first recorded this survey in the 50s. His insights into Bach are pure, with the required delicacy in slow movements, the right touch of silence here and there to let the music breathe, without being CONSPICUOUSLY slow, such as the Perlman set, which tends to drag at times. His fugues are perfectly light on their feet, his rhythms perfectly sprung, without making it a horse race. In short, Milstein stays out of the way of Bach in every moment of the EMI set, and we are face to face with the composer. But in this DG set from the 1970s, Milstein seems to be rushing through some passages (as does Grumiaux), with more regard for \\"technical brilliance\\" as the Penguin editor cited, instead of pure musicality and reverence of Bach. I have listened to both Milstein versions, and this DG recording simply does not reach down into the depths of Bach in the same way.<br /><br />The Jascha Heifetz rendition is also outstanding, but when you listen to it, you know that it's about Heifetz, not so much about Bach. Now, Heifetz was indeed the best of the best, in terms of his technical mastery. The one segment where Heifetz wins me over from everyone else is in the mighty Chaconne from Partita 2. In this Mount Everest of solo violin, Heifetz takes you on an exhilarating ride that leaves you speechless. I have never heard the Chaconne played with such fearless power and confidence than from Heifetz. For that one segment alone, I bow to him above all others. He was indeed the best.<br /><br />But Heifetz himself always heaped praise upon Nathan Milstein, which was exceedingly rare. Heifetz never praised anyone! Heifetz always demanded that his students go to see Milstein perform. If his students didn't go, they'd be in trouble! So Milstein certainly commanded a great deal of respect from Heifetz. And when you hear Milstein play the mighty Chaconne, he almost has the supreme technical mastery of Heifetz. Not quite, but almost. However, once again, when you hear the Heifetz version, you are hearing Heifetz, the master. When you hear the (50s EMI) Milstein version, you are hearing Bach.<br /><br />I invite the listener to compare one specific movement between these two Milstein versions, and then make their own decision. Listen very carefully to the opening Grave movement from Sonata 2 in A Minor. Compare and contrast the depth of insight in the 50s version on EMI, and the 70s version on DG. You will most likely come to the same conclusion as I did after making my own comparison. Then compare other movements throughout the set, but start with that one. For me, there is no doubt. The 50s set is pure, unadulterated Bach at its finest. No other violinist came closer to the heart of this beautiful music than Milstein did in the 1950s. Even HE didn't get as close to it when he remade this music later in his life. And by the way, in terms of sound quality, the EMI set from the 50s is perfect! There is no cavernous reverb, just the pure unadulterated sound of Milstein's violin, so clean and clear that he is right there in the room with you.

B000000OQF|5.0|Being 13, I can't really use the very popular \\"way back in '87\\" format, but I still have to say that Appetite For Destruction is the best rock album I've ever heard, and I've heard most, from The Beatles to ... everyone else.  <br /> <br />My cousin had just come back from America, and her boombox was blasting out guitar riffs that seemed vaguely familiar ... \\"Take me down to the Paradise City--\\" BANG. I found myself finishing the chorus. I had heard this somewhere before! And as I listened the album through (which I'm doing right now -- \\"My Michelle\\" is starting) I knew this was my favorite band on earth. Four years on, it still is. <br /> <br />\\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" rolles out the Welcomewagon with a party rocker, great riffs and a beat you want to jump to. \\"It's So Easy\\" has Axl sounding like ten more of himself, and then the masterpiece that is \\"Nightrain.\\" It's a fantastic song, and one of the best GNR tracks. \\"Out Ta Get Me\\" and \\"Mr. Brownstone\\" are galaxies apart as far as tune and beat go, but one is just as good as the other, that is, great. Then that fateful song, \\"Paradise City,\\" the immortal intro and the brilliant solo, ending with the chorus repeating constantly over some incredible guitar work.  <br /> <br />\\"My Michelle\\" is another great track about writing a letter to a chick called Michelle; \\"Think About You\\" is a great song, too. \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" deserves another 1000 words - no, paragraphs. The intro is genius, the lyrics are sublime, and the second half is beyond simple, perishable words that vanish as soon as they come out of your mouth. An incredible solo which is kicking off right now, and the ending keeps up the great tradition of Slash and Axl in very (very) loud mode, yet in harmony and complementing each other. Axl/Slash are just as good as Plant/Page, Tyler/Perry, Bon Jovi/Sambora and anyone else, probably better. After that, come \\"You're Crazy\\" and \\"Anything Goes,\\" both lots of fun and tracks you will never tire of. Both are fast-paced rockers, and they're GNR, so they guarantee their quality themselves. To finish, \\"Rocket Queen\\" is a brilliant song, one of the best. <br /> <br />From \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" to \\"Paradise City\\" to \\"Sweet Child O' Mine,\\" and lastly, but far from least, \\"Rocket Queen,\\" this is the only album on my iTunes that gets 5/5 straight through. As for \\"Rocket Queen,\\" it is the perfect ending. It ends with a very long verse, Axl professing love in a high-pitched voice, and Slash baffling you with the magnificence of the guitar that he plays. A GLOROIOUS ending. And I have only 2 minutes before it starts, so better hurry now. \\"Anything Goes\\" will be over soon ... <br /> <br />All in all, this is the best rock record ever, and a prelude to the two albums that, IMHO, are its two runner-ups. This made me hungry for destruction! And best of all, MY parents never objected to Axl's obscenities, and never objected to anything at all until my dad accidentally put on Hedwig and the Angry Inch. Alas! Poor, poor, desecrated disk ... I can mourn later, I've run out of time! Are you still reading? Get the bloody album!
B000929AJQ|3.0|At first, I was extremely dissappointed. Everything from the cover art to the music itself, seemed ...recycled. However, after listening to With Teeth in my car for a week solid now, it's grown on me a bit. The album is good, but it's not great.  <br />  <br />However, the songs- <br />  <br />\\"The hand that feeds\\" <br />\\"With Teeth\\" <br />\\"Only\\" <br />\\"Right where it belongs\\" <br />  <br />Really shine and are all definitely worth the price of admission.  <br />  <br />But after waiting five years, I was hoping this album would be a bit more fresh and exciting. Instead we get an album that, stylistically, feels more like a throw back to Pretty Hate Machine, the tracks \\"Only\\" and \\"Right Where It Belongs\\" especially. Which is not a bad thing (Pretty Hate Machine is, afterall, a great album), but this is just not what I, or probably most people, were expecting. And with \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" being the only power track, the album lacks much of the immediate hard driving fury of say The Downward Spiral or The Fragile.  <br /> <br />The title track, \\"With Teeth\\", is the only song that really stands out as breaking new ground. If more of the album had been fueled and focused in this direction, the praises would be higher across the board, because we'd be hearing something truly new from NIN.  <br /> <br />Instead we have a motley collection songs that could easily pass as lost tracks to previous albums. Which means we've waited five years for a new album that is entirely lacking a unique identity, leaving With Teeth, with no bite.

068485743X|1.0|I thought that this book would be a sophisticated look at how to grab an editor. Instead the first chapter deals with eliminating unnecessary adjectives and adverbs---this is writing 101. It takes a great deal more than than basics like this to get published. A total waste of money.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|Scarface exists on it's own terms - as a cautionary tale about a Cuban punk who arrives in Miami in 1980 and works his way to the top of the Cocaine power-heap, but it also begs comparison to Al Pacino's other work as that other famous gangster - Michael Corleone in the Godfather films.<br /><br />Oliver Stone's screenplay forms the foundation for Brian De Palma's film, and the violence and language are exceedingly raw.  This is not a film for the easily offended.  In fact, you could have a pretty strong stomach for excess violence and the F word and still be a little worn out by the end.<br /><br />Pacino's Anthony Montana has no redeeming qualities.  He has all the deadly sins, and double doses of most of them.  Where The Godfather's Michael Corleone is a conflicted character, Tony is sociopath through and through.  Michael Corleone begins the Godfather movies with no intention of getting involved in the family \\"business\\", and by the end he has become one of the strongest gangsters on earth.  He dreams of \\"going legitimate\\" and at various points in ALL of the Godfather films Michael ponders his place in the crime universe and how he can separate his life of crime from his family - who he seems to legitimately love.  Tony Montana in \\"Scarface\\" has NO ambition of going straight - only of becoming a MORE powerful druglord.  He treats women and his friends like dirt and walks through life with an arrogance that is, at best, unpleasant.  When he is REALLY riled he is capable of just about anything, and this film shows his character doing pretty much that - just about anything.<br /><br />De Palma's direction is a cut above average, and the cast of Pacino, Pfeiffer and some excellent support from Robert Loggia, Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio and Steven Bauer perform their roles adequately, but by the end I couldn't get over the feeling that I was essentially watching an extremely violent soap opera with a good cast.<br /><br />I'd say about 3.5 stars, but I'll round it to 4.
038542471X|5.0|I liked this book because John Grisham has written an amazing thriller in literature about the legal system. The Client is such a page-turner of life threatening secrets. This suspenseful book gives an interesting look inside the good and bad times of the U.S. legal system. I have never read a story quite like this. It kept me wanting more.  <br />     The dialogue made the characters came alive. It made the story seem more interesting and believable. For example, when Romey talks to Mark about why he's scared that he would be Barry's next victim.  <br />     Grisham tells a story about an 11-yaer-old boy who knows a secret that can put his life and his family in danger. <br />     Mark Sway and his little brother Ricky were having a smoke until they met a suicidal lawyer of a killer, who leaves them with a secret of where the most wanted dead body is buried. Mark is now between the legal system, who will do anything to have Mark talk, and the Mafia determined to keep Mark quiet. The only person who can help give his life back would be a woman named Reggie Love.  <br />     I would definitely recommend anyone who likes an awesome thriller about the legal system to grab this book. <br /> <br />

Not with Gavin, all talent and he is amazing both live in concert and on his CD. Trust me, I am not an easy one to win over, and the guy's voice is amazing and song writing incredibly insightful. Definately recommend... and I can't wait for a sophomore album.

B0007OCG56|4.0|James Brooks' \\"Spanglish\\" features Adam Sandler, but this is NOT \\"Happy Gilmore\\".<br /><br />I am reading many negative reviews here and I have to say the Mrs. and I didn't think it was that bad.  James Brooks has made some witty dramedies in the past, and Spanglish isn't going to make anyone forget \\"Terms of Endearment\\" or \\"As Good As It Gets\\", but it's not bad.<br /><br />Paz Vega stars as Flor, a Mexican immigrant who is in almost every scene yet speaks hardly any English.  Flor's husband has inexplicably left Flor and their young daughter, Cristina.  Cristina is portrayed as a 12 year old by the wonderful Shelbie Bruce.  She is not only an accomplished young actress, but most of her scenes are bilingual as she acts as interpreter between Flor and the Clasky family.<br /><br />Flor comes to America and is hired as a domestic for John and Deborah Clasky.  Sandler portrays John, who has opened a little restaurant after moving from New York and is declared by the New York Times the Greatest Chef in America.  Not much is made of his Cheffing - he could have as easily been Greatest Dog-Catcher, Salesman, etc.  Deborah is portrayed by Tea Leoni, and Deborah has issues.  I've read many reviews that suggest that her performance is a little \\"out there\\". Roger Ebert wrote \\"Deborah doesn't just go over the top, she waves goodbye as she disappears into cuckoo-land.\\"<br /><br />In my professional dealings I unfortunately encounter Deborah's kind frequently.  Deborah was a high-powered type A executive until she was downsized, and now she's all type A and no outlet.  Her family - in fact everyone in contact with her - suffers for it.<br /><br />Cloris Leachman has a wonderful role as Deborah's mother, an alcoholic who was once a notable jazz singer.  She loves Deborah when pretty much no one else can, and she insightfully tells us at the end of the movie that she hasn't had a drink in weeks, and no one noticed, which must mean that she was a pretty well-functioning drunk.<br /><br />The Clasky's have a little girl about the same age as Flor's Cristina, and Sarah Steele's performance as Bernice is as good as Shelbie Bruce's Cristina - just without the bilingual dialogue.  Bernice is a smart, cheerful pre-teen with a little weight problem, and Deborah does and says all the things that dent Bernice's self-esteem.<br /><br />Deborah is high-strung and neurotic, Flor is beautiful and sweet-natured.  Is it possible John might be attracted to someone other than Deborah?<br /><br />I expected conflict - maybe even a little adultery - but the way Brooks' screenplay works through these issues was both realistic and satisfyingly open-ended.<br /><br />Reviewers who complain that the film ends with many issues unresolved must live lives that have all their issues resolved as well.<br /><br />Not the best Brooks.

0440180295|5.0|I usually dislike using the word \\"awesome\\" simply becuase it is so overused, but I know no other word that I could use to describe \\"Slaughterhouse-Five\\" by Kurt Vonnegut without understating it's brilliance.  <br /> <br />A tale of the author's experiences in WWII told through the eyes of Billy Pilgrim, an unfortunate and rather foolish soldier who lives throught the fire-bombing of Dresden (which killed almost as many people as the nuclear bombing of Hiroshima) along with his adventures on the alien planet of Tralfamadorian and his travels through time, the book is one of the best pieces of American literature I have ever read. <br /> <br />The schizophrenic style of writing, which may be had to get used to at first, helps to emphasize the chaotic nature of the war that the author lived through, and the sarcastic, cynical, nihilistic voice that Vonnegut uses throughout the book is excellent at showing the postwar trauma the Vonneguy must have suffered from and the horror of war that he had probably seen. <br /> <br />A book that excellently reflects the morbid and violent side of war, as opposed to the novels of romanticism that tend to show war as a glorious fight for honor, Slaughterhouse-Five is one of those books that will open your eyes to the true, grim reality of the world if you bother to read it carefully. I would recommend it to anyone who would be willing to sit though a couple chapters of chaotic flashbacks in exchange for a fine piece of reading.
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence is one of the greatest bands of our time, and this is no joke, for the debut album is one of the most haunting and emotionally charged debut albums I've ever heard. In the darkness I have felt sad and cold, broken and empty, though these feelings were indeed harsh and cruel they taught me something more, something otherwordly, and I managed to understand my purpose and my strength. I have been taken down to sadness because of damaged love, we all have. Evanescence's cluster of beautiful eerie vocals, talented paino playing, and brilliant guitar riffs build an empire of dreams, the stream of mechanical echos bare of story of long lost hope and dreams. The sounds of Amy Lee's voice echoing against the background of solid darkness creates a feeling of fear, that fear is ever so honest and unknind. The songs tell a story that we can all understand, from going under to the fallen shadows, to feeling lost and being alone in the back of the classroom. Evanescence makes things seem more real in life, feelings, thoughts, nightmares and voices. The stirring of vocals blends together a wonderful sound of depression and often happiness, the album itself is a story of good and evil, right and wrong, darkness and light, love and hate. When Amy sat down to write the lyrics to this album she had to go somewhere else in her head to write, she had to feel sad or depressed, or even happy and glad. She is a great writer with a flawless voice from Heaven, she and the band rocks together. I went to see Evanescence in 2004 and it was one of the most amazing adventures in years, I think that Evanescence will be around for a very longtime. Fallen is a wondeful cd and if you are new to Evanescence pick this cd up it is a must, from track 1 to track 11 you will find yourself lost and you shall uncover something within yourself that is a little different than before. Something that is honest and truthful, something lively and simple. Life will go on and Evanescence will always rock.

0471463396|4.0|The back cover bills this book as `a must read for all disciples of value investing.' I don't exactly qualify as a traditional value investor, yet I found the book quite valuable.<br /><br />Greenwald and company do an excellent job in distilling the essence of value investing, giving an objective sense of what it is and how it's done. The picture they paint is clear and structured, yet flexible enough to cover the various manifestations of value investing out there.<br /><br />If you view the market as a sort of investment ecosystem, with multiple survival strategies in use--all of them interacting and influencing one another--then you naturally want to have an understanding of the strategies out there besides your own. In this sense, the mindset of the value investor is as interesting as the specific analytical tools he or she uses. And given the countless billions devoted to value, these guys leave an `ecological footprint' that can't be ignored.<br /><br />It's also interesting to note that value investing is far from simple and far from easy. As the book notes, Graham's treasured `net-net' situations have all but disappeared, except in cases where the company is on the brink of collapse or destined for slow demise. Furthermore, value investors profess to be `bottom up' rather than `top down,' and are actively disdainful of macro analysis on the whole... yet calculating `cost of capital,' a key element of valuation, is very much a macro exercise!<br /><br />To properly value the cash flow stream in question, you must benchmark it against the comparative risk-adjusted return, or `cost of capital,' demanded by investors. But to know what general level of return will be demanded by investors... i.e. to know the cost of capital... you will need to have a feel for interest rates, risk appetite, appeal of alternative asset classes, general propensity for valuations to expand or compress within the given time period, and so on. In other words, macro stuff.<br /><br />I found it ironic that such a basic tool of micro fundamentalists (discounted cash flow) turns out to be so macro dependent. To their credit, Greenwald & co. take this deficiency head on: \\"We should be struck here by a glaring inconsistency between the precision of the algebra and the gross uncertainties infecting the variables that define the model.\\" No kidding!<br /><br />They go on to note that `terminal value', in most cases the largest determination of net present value, can vary by huge margins in either direction based on small adjustments to initial input. In other words, a small fudge in your NPV (net present value) calculation can steer you hundreds of miles off course. But perhaps this is where the \\"margin of safety\\" comes in... value investors prefer plenty of elbow room to account for potential gigantic holes in their calculations, as well as hit-or-miss timing.<br /><br />After highlighting the follies of NPV, the book introduces Graham and Dodd's alternative methodology. In essence, G&D place much more emphasis on the certain present relative to the uncertain future. This creates issues of its own, however: For example, how do you value the intangible assets of an innovation-based company in a knowledge-based economy? How do you value things like strategic relationships and branding? How do you account for political risk, technological risk, demographic risk, etc?<br /><br />Perhaps the short answer is: as a `pure' value investor, you don't. You stick to your knitting and ignore the stuff that can't be nailed down. And yet, that answer doesn't really fly, because one of the things Graham and Dodd consider is the `franchise value'... which certainly can't be nailed down, is tough to account for on a balance sheet, and is subject to substantial change over time given ever-shifting landscapes.<br /><br />The point here isn't to suggest value investing is inherently flawed. Rather, it's to point out that successful value investors are much more than pure number crunchers. To do it right, they have to get into a lot of those nebulous, gray areas that dilute the purity of the discipline. \\"Dollar bills for fifty cents\\" just ain't that easy, and cheap is only good in the right context. I also had to wonder, how much of value investing is really just long range timing based on market cycles. Meaning take your shots occasionally, but mostly wait for those once-in-a-decade opportunities to load up on good assets marked down heavily, when Mr. Market is on Prozac, Xanax and Lexipro all at once.<br /><br />Objections aside, the value method can work well for its disciples. It just isn't the be-all-end-all that some make it out to be. There are many paths up the mountain, and value investing is but one of them. (Funny how the followers of feted disciplines often look down on or belittle the other paths, seeing their way as the \\"only\\" way. But that's actually a credit to this book, as Greenwald recognizes and acknowledges there are other paths that work too.)<br /><br />The second half of the book (a profile of eight value investors) was entertaining and informative, a cross-section of the value investing mindset in application. The section on Buffett got me thinking about his money troubles--that is, the trouble with investing $100 billion plus--and how Buffett's size issues reflect on the discipline of value investing as a whole. Could Berkshire Hathaway itself be overplayed? When a company reaches its peak valuation in the fullness of time, a disciplined value investor cashes out at least some, if not all, of their position. Can the Oracle of Omaha apply the same discipline to his own shop?<br /><br />In the world of commodities trading, the biggest CTAs (Commodity Trading Advisors) are trend followers, with tens of billions under management. Trend following is a wholly different strategy than value investing, with an entirely different niche in the ecosystem, and yet the big problem faced by trend followers and value investors is the same. That problem is: when there are too many others pursuing your strategy, the level of returns will erode until enough players are shaken out to make the strategy profitable again.<br /><br />Greenwald believes that value opportunities will always persist, and gives a number of reasons why institutions and large fund managers will continue to overlook value based opportunities. But he doesn't mention the proliferation of hedge funds which, in spite of bad press, is likely to only increase over the years. Rather than a top-heavy institutional model, perhaps we will ultimately see a much larger number of private money managers, with smaller funds in the tens of millions rather than large ones in the hundreds of millions or billions. And these guys will have no problem going against conventional Wall Street wisdom in pursuit of superior returns... making the value world that much more competitive, and good values that much harder to find.<br /><br />In conclusion, I'm not sure how well this book plays with dyed-in-the-wool value investors (as I am not one of them). But if you're new to value, or experienced in a different discipline and curious as to how the value guys think, I can definitely give it an enthusiastic thumbs up.bulous, gray areas that dilute the purity of the discipline. \\"Dollar bills for fifty cents\\" just ain't that easy, and cheap is only good in the right context.

The story line about the boy who heard about the wear a bouts of the deiced body of a U.S Senator was just great story telling. The dialogue and the way the book was written, was really good because the book kept me very interested. <br /> The two main characters (Mark, and his lawyer Reggie Love) formed a great team to fight off the FBI and the mob people. Mark being the super hero and supporting his mother and his little brother that is still in shock from seeing the lawyer blow his head off. Reggie helping children in the pass but saw that Mark really needed her help and diecided that she was going to do all that she could to help Mark. Mark fighting to stay alive and Reggie fighting to keep Mark alive in court I thought that this was a really great the way that they were both trying to help each other.  <br />        I would reccommend this book to alot of people. It had alot of imagery in it. I kept seeing a image or a picture in my head. This is a really great book. <br />  <br />
B00062IVKS|5.0|I recommend purchasing the Martin Scorsese Box Set from MGM, which includes this along with other Scorsese classics. \\"Raging Bull\\" is one of the great films of the 1980s and this DVD is an excellent companion piece. Highly recommended.
B000000WA4|5.0|This album is so good!!!!<br />The diversity here is amazing!!!  As a hardcore fan, there is no filler, but even a close to hardcore fan will love most of this.<BR>It has 28 songs!!!!!  Which other proper album has 28 songs???<br />This is the best smashing pumpkins release.  They are the best band of all time.  I have been a fan since 1998.  Dec 2, 2000 was one of the worst days in history because the pumpkins broke up.  They are sadly missed by me and millions of fellow obsessed pumpkins fans.  Get this; if there's one album you need in your collection; if you hate everything else; if you can only buy 1 album in a lifetime; get this!!!!<br />Get this !!!!!  Now !!!!!
038542471X|4.0|\\"The Client\\" was really a great book to read if you are interested in mystery books. Well it is written by John Grisham and eventually was turned into a movie because of how great a book it was. I think the message this book is trying to show people is that never keep secrets or else it will come back and haunt you. What I also think was how great the author used foreshadowing in this book make it really compelling to reader around the world. A thing I didn't like was the dialogue how it went along with the story of how it was told and sometimes it didn't make sense in my opinion. Yes it was really believable but sometimes they (the characters) would repeat the same things over and over as I read. For example when the characters kept taking about how Mark, the 11yr old by, was going to be sentenced they just repeatedly were talking about how people were going to get subpoenas which really didn't make sense as I saw it. <br /> \\"The Client\\" starts out with a boy named Mark and his younger sibling Ricky smoking and they come upon this guy who wants to commit suicide, which sets the whole tone of the story. It all turns disaster when they guy sees Mark and then abducts him. Ricky is in shock as later on goes into a coma. Romey as we find his name out tells Mark that his client Barry \\"the blade\\" Muuldonno killed senator Boyd Boyette and buried him in  <br />Romey's garage and now Barry is after Romey, which is why he wants to commit suicide. <br />This creates all the foreshadowing and suspense leading up to the end. The cops throw Mark in jail for not telling them what had happened so his lawyer Reggie Love helps him escape. Reggie Love is my favorite character because the way she lets nobody push her around. They are on the hunt to go find the body of Boyette as are Muldonno's boys. <br />Now it's your job to find out what happens with Mark and Reggie in the end. <br /> Now to rank this book I would give it four stars because of how great it was except for one problem. The problem is the dialogue, which is hold this story back from being a perfect five stars. As you know in my opinion that the dialogue is really weak. If the author told this story in narrative point of view I think it would be much easier to understand and even be more into the story with all the suspense it has. So now the only thing left to say is for you to go out to read it.  <br />  <br />
0375404635|4.0|I personally think that it is an okay book if a reader wants to read about how womans were like in 1950s and about mental diseases. It was interesting story about Esther trying to be healthy(in mental means) again after attempts to suiside. This gives readers, especially people who have depression, hope to readers that `This is not the end, so don't give away your life so easily.'  <br /> <br />Also the title of \\"Bell Jar\\" which is compared to Esthers mind that was closed and not letting the hope to come in and keeping the despair among herself.  <br /> <br />Eventhought you think that you will not have any mental diseases like depression, after you read the book, you wouldn't feel safe that a person like Esther was also having depression that she tries to end her life. This is a story of a person's life over one's life. I would recommend others to read it since there was no book like this in the world.  <br /> <br />
B0007TKNII|5.0|I saw this DVD and I enjoyed it quite a bit. It is different from the stage production, but it is understandable. I was about to put this DVD away when I noticed the other language on the disc was French. So I decided to give it a try. <br /> <br />I was totally blown away! The French version was amazing! Now this is the Phantom I was hoping for. I don't know French, but who needs to be fluent in it. I know all the English words already. The story is supposed to be set in Paris so the language made this film come to life with artistic style. The person who sings the part of the Phantom in French is infinitely better than the english version. He truly captures the true essence of the Phantom. The other actors also sound much better and it makes the movie even more fantastic. Christine truly echos amazingly in the journey to the Phantom's lair. All in all, I must say I recommend this DVD, and it is best heard with it's French soundtrack. It is not to be missed.

0553274503|5.0|If you like science fiction books based on a day by day journal you'll love this book. The main character is a mentally disabled man named Charlie Gordon . He had an operation  to raise his IQ. Charlie goes through great change in having friends to having no friends. He also falls in love with his former teacher. This is one of my favorite books.                                                                                                          <br /> I would recommend this book in a  heartbeat. I liked this book because I can relate to Charlie. I was made fun of just like him. I would rate this book at five stars. As a student at George Washington High School this book is a great book for connecting to every day life.
1400082773|5.0|Written years before he entered and successfully won the U. S. Senate race from Illinois, this autobiography is wonderful and masterfully written.  I would read this book even if he was not a well-known politician.  Barack Obama writes of life with great insight into his own life as well as the lives of the people he encounters.  He is an old soul--mature beyond his years.  This is a deep-thinking, sensitive, empathetic man.  I hope he will write many more books--he is gifted with a natural talent for writing.  I highly recommend reading this book.
B0000A118M|5.0|A Love Supreme has very significant meaning to me and many others who grew up in South Central L.A. at the time of its release.  We where kids and didn't really know what we where hearing but we listened with great intrest.  A love Supreme is a spritual experience set to music.  However it was quickly adopted as the national anthem of the Black revolutionary movement of the 60's.  All of the emotions expressed through Coltranes horn represented the feelings and attitudes of the times.  Which was for equality and peace. That era has past as well as Coltrane himself.  Ironically that cry for freedom can still be heard in this recording which will never die.
0812550706|5.0|I have read my fair share of fantasy and have therefore found several cases in which the author creates a well-crafted world. Orson Scott Card excels in this aspect, presenting a setting that is on the borderline between a fantastic world and a possible future for our own existence. One of the aspects that I enjoyed most about this work is the complex set of rules created by the author and the heavy weight politics and philosophy play in the story.<br /><br />Andrew Wiggin, also known as Ender due to his sister's inability for voicing his real name, is a very special little kid. His parents received a special permission from the government to have a third child due to their outstanding genes, overriding the law that prevents having more that two kids. As a result Ender has worn a monitor since his birth and every one of his actions has been analyzed in extreme detail. But now the monitor needs to come off, and the people that have been monitoring him are interested in making life difficult for him to unveil his reactions.<br /><br />Of course it does not stop there, and when the offer from Colonel Graff for joining the Battle school is presented to Ender, he has to go fulfill his duty and leave behind his family and the human being he cares about the most, his sister Valentine. The Battle School should not be taken lightly. Eighty years ago, the humans fought a war against the buggers and were only able to survive thanks to a brilliant commander. Now humanity depends on the ability of the high ranks of the military to find a new leader, and Ender is one of the hopes they have for salvation. The fact that he is younger than most in Battle School will certainly make things difficult for him, and keep things interesting for us.<br /><br />Besides providing with great entertainment, this book makes us think about what may lie in the future, what are the ethical implications of war and whether or not is OK to achieve our ends without caring for what the means used are. We also get an interesting fictional look at life in the military, and our fare share of action. One thing about this book is undeniable; it is like nothing you have ever read, so if you are looking for something different, this one is for you.e also get an interesting fictional look at life in the military, and our fare share of action.

B00007G207|4.0|This is a beautiful and moving story about love and nostalgia.  In the beginning, Salvatore, a middle-aged filmmaker of some renown, is informed of the passing of Alberto, the old projectionist who had befriended him and had first awakened his love of cinema. As he travel back to his hometown for the funeral, memories of his childhood and youth come tumbling out of him: the boy Salvatore's fascination with the workings of the projector, his growing friendship with Alberto, the raucous, communal warmth of the theater and the ectascy and heartbreak of his first love. These memories have a purity and richness sharpened by the passing time. We the viewers can't help but to be swept up in these vivid scenes and perhaps marvel, along with the older Salvatore at the end of the movie, how movies are akin to our memories and dreams, where colors are forever vibrant, beauty never fades, and love always just a heartbeat away.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I'll admit, I was worried.  I have been a \\"phan\\" for almost 20 years now, ever since I read the book in second grade.  I have been fortunate enough to see Phantom performed live on stage and I have owned and adored the original London cast recording and hightlights from the play for several years now.  I would never deny credit to Michael Crawford or Sarah Brightman.  But this movie exceeded my expectations.  In fact, it blew away any previous version I've heard or seen.  I was stunned.<br /><br />The movie pays homage to the play and is almost too faithful in this stage-to-screen adaptation.  Almost.  It retains all of the beloved elements of the theatre including the mist and rising candles, the chandelier and the like, and then improves upon it by fully utilizing its new medium of film.<br /><br />The chemistry on-screen is electrifying, and culminates with the passionate performances in The Point of No Return.  Emmy Rossum is stunning, both visually and vocally, and Patrick Wilson's voice is pure and perfectly pitched-ideal for the role.<br /><br />But where the filmmakers really excelled was in their casting of Gerard Butler as the phantom.  Not only did he understand the appeal of the story and of the phantom itself, he truly threw himself into the role and captured the very soul of the phantom.  Although he only speaks eight lines of the movie (the rest being sung), it was easy to be so drawn in to the movie to even forget that it was a musical.  Gerard performed the role with a passion, intensity and reverence for the character that is not to be missed.  He has the right \\"edge\\" for the part and his performances are impassioned, sincere and heartbreaking.<br /><br />In fact, the cast is so enthralling that I found I had to buy the soundtrack just to keep myself from watching the movie!<br /><br />Andrew Lloyd Webber himself said this of the movie:<br /><br />\\"The film looks and sound fabulous...it's an extraordinarily fine document of the show.  Of course, it's a difference animal to the stage show...but it doesn't threaten the integrity of the show in any way.  ...if anything it's expanded it and given it perhaps and even deeper emotional centre.\\"<br /><br />Be open-minded and watch it already!  You'll be missing out if you don't.Of course, it's a difference animal to the stage show...but it doesn't threaten the integrity of the show in any way.  ...if anything it's expanded it and given it perhaps and even deeper emotional centre.\\" <br /> <br />Be open-minded and watch it already!  You'll be missing out if you don't.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I saw the movie for the first time on DVD. After watching it, I had to see it in a movie theater.  The movie has been out for so long that the only place I could find to see it was a little over an hour away from where I live. Even so, it was worth every mile and minute I spent on the road.  It is now my favorite movie ever, and one of, if not THE best movie ever made.  I can't believe how many movie \\"critics\\" slammed this movie.  This move is outstanding!  The cast was outstanding!  Gerard Butler as the Phantom was amazing.  He's the reason why woman have fantasies.  He's so incredibly sexy, and sensual, and just oozes charisma.  And when he sings...Mmm, it's your soul that takes flight and you wish it were you he was dragging down to the dungeon of his black despair!  I could not imagine anyone else playing the Phantom...Even Michael Crawford.  He absolutely moves you to tears with the way he conveys everything that the Phantom is feeling and going through with his eyes.  You FEEL his pain, his anger, and the love he has for Christine.  He truly is an incredibly talented actor and singer.  And Emmy Rossum as Christine is amazing and also does a great job with conveying all the emotions and feelings of Christine.  My only complaint about the DVD is I wish it had A LOT more footage of Gerard and Emmy recording the songs and a lot more of the \\"making\\" of the movie.   <br />   <br />Bravo!  Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber for making a superb movie that truly makes your soul take flight.  <br />
B00003CX5P|4.0|When I first saw this movie I was very disappointed. In preperation for Revenge of the Sith, I watched Episode I & 2 this past weekend. For some reason it was an entirely different movie. I think it's actually on par the Episode 4-6. The story is stronger than in Episode 4-6. We have more character development and the action does not let us down.  <br /> <br />Yes, Jar Jar may still be the most reviled character in movie history, but on a smaller screen it's not as bad as in the theatres. Is the acting wooden at time? Yes, but this is Star Wars after all.  <br /> <br />Qui-Gon Jinn is the strongest character and perhaps the best Jedi  <br />in all films. He a character of integrity and strength. He always  <br />stand up for what is right opposed to the obeying every strict or <br />unreasonable order from the Jedi council. He sets the standard for Jedi.  <br /> <br />For many that hated Episode, I feel they're jaded and cynical and for those that think this movie is the best movie ever, they are disillusioned. This is an entertaining movie that deserves a second chance.
B00006IU73|5.0|I am an audiophile...I listen to my music a lot and very carefully.  I have band and compose my own music.  I really have to say... every instrument and every member of Porcupine Tree is one of a kind.  Voice, guiters, bass, drums, piano, and keyboards are uncommonly perfect.  This isn't just a collection of music... its a real album.  Awesome.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Here's the most well-designed disaster film since \\"The Core\\" that is long on looks and, well, lean as sizzlean on plot, acting and credibility.<br /><br />Maybe something can happen in the world to return us to another ice age, but can it happen in 15 minutes time? That is essentially the plot of this disaster film, which contains a lot of great computer-generated scenes of natural disasters mixed in with a little real life footage you will easily recognize if you've ever watched any TV program about natural disasters.<br /><br />Dennis Quaid is the star of this flick, whose disaster scenario builds around his quest to travel from Washington D.C. to New York to save his son, who is stranded in the city. Quaid and crew overcome a storm of the world and make it to New York, just in time to save the kid and a few others, who give hope that the end of the world -- which has essentially already happened -- can be reversed.<br /><br />Optimism after the beginning of a new ice age? That's what we're faced with at the end of this movie, a rather surrealisitc premise on which to base a \\"Day After Tomorrow 2\\". My wife and I had a lot of laughs in this movie for the effects and precarious situations of the actors. I don't get the impression the film was supposed to be a comedy, so I have to assume it was not completely successful in its premise.<br /><br />So don't expect too much from this when you it home and turned on in your DVD player. The scenes of tornadoes are not particularly realistic but they are sure big! The ocean rise that sweeps New York is more compelling but still bigger than anything that's ever been known to happen in reality, including the recent tsunami in the Indian Ocean.
B000007T1M|5.0|Pretty much every song on this album I've wanted to listen to specifically at one time or another.  I often ended up listening to more than just one song because all the songs have great beginnings that pull you in.  You should probably buy Toxicity before this album but if you liked it you won't be disappointed by this one.
B00005MP58|5.0|Their really is nothing new to say. Exceptional movie with great acting. One of my favorite movies of all time. Right up there with Gone With the Wind, Star Wars, Joy Luck Club, Steel Magnolias & Lord of the Rings (I love variety) for me. <br /> <br />One Star DVD- This movie deserves better. The transfer is poor. Since this the only version out there on Dvd, then we must settle for this. The movie transfer is watchable but it should be crisp and clean.  <br /> <br />Do not miss this gem.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|This is not just a movie, but a wonderful event.  Wonderful music and cast, beautifully filmed, beautifully sung.  On first viewing (in the movie theater) it seemed a bit long as it is almost non-stop music.  But on second and later viewings, especially viewing the DVD at home, I think this movie grows on you even more.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|Oh come on! <br /> <br />Please, the critics for this are probably either ignorants who don't understand the story fully, or Catholics/Christians who got offended by the movie! This movie deserves at least a 4.5/5! <br /> <br />Being an Atheist, I would expect to not understand the movie at all, instead, I come out of the theater extremely pleased and with very few minor questions about the movie. I enjoyed the plot, Keanu Reeves acted great, and sincerely, this movie deserves 5/5. I enjoyed it so much, I bought the soundtrack and some other items related to Constantine, and watched it 3 times more. <br /> <br />When I have time, of course I'll buy this movie! Especially a two-disk edition, which'll probably contain more scenes than the movie can get. <br /> <br />Overall, this movie is horribly underrated by bad critics, and deserves a solid 5/5.
B0002YLC24|1.0|I vaguely remember the first movie titled \\"Before Sunrise\\" and enjoyed it for what it was-a brief encounter of 2 strangers in an interesting environment with lots to see.  However, this sequel should never have been made.  Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy reunite for another brief encounter, but it is more of the same without all the great scenery.  Now they are older and more cynical and talk about the most insipid things.  Julie is now a bitter, left-wing enviro-kook that whines about all her boyfriends not marrying her.  Ethan stares at her with puppy dog eyes and a goofy grin and just vacuosly agrees with her anti-American rhetoric just hoping to get laid.  The ending left me with a feeling of dread that they might make a third.  If so, I know I won't be seeing it.  Avoid this one at all costs.

B0007VCZ50|5.0|It is about time that this ground-breaking video finally made it to DVD, making it even more of an audio and video treasure. I can still remember the first time I saw the special on A & E almost 20 years ago.  I had lost track of Sting and his wanderings after he had left the Police, and wasn't quite sure I wanted to find him anyway given the negative publicity (and my own disappointment) surrounding his departure from what is still regarded as one of the best rock groups of all time. Unsuspecting, while lounging on my back porch I flipped through the cable channels and stumbled onto the program as it had just begun. For the next 2 hours I became mesmerized.     The project was an unprecedented undertaking at the time, recording a band not only in live concert but through the whole process from inception to rehearsal to performance. The concept was as risky as it was revolutionary, especially for Sting who had everything to lose by not only gambling on a solo project, but by making this effort so accessible in such a unique manner to the viewing public. In its form and feature, it was also a prototype for what would become \\"reality\\" TV, long before there was such a category.     Beginning with location shots of the band in rehearsal at a French castle just outside Paris, we get an impressive portrait of Sting shaping a new musical ensemble: he lays out the rudimentary form of his original compositions, then brings them to life, gently but confidently directing his very talented charges, mostly accomplished African-American jazz players, through the complex arrangements, allowing for their contributions along the way. What becomes abundantly obvious, beyond his now-and-again reserve and arrogance, is Sting's finely-tuned sense of artistic expression, complemented by his technical knowledge of the medium. He knows what he wants and how to articulate it. In addition to the picture of music and musicians coming together, there are unpredictable and insightful interviewswith Sting and other members of the band spliced strategically into the body of the video. Apted's editing is excellent in these instances and rather spectacular overall. At times he even synthesizes the scenes from the concert performance of a song with those at practice, the two segments pieced together as one without missing a note or beat. We also are provided usually unseen glimpses of the band's manager, Miles Copeland, ensuring that peace reigns among the musicians while securing the preparations and publicity for their debut. We are fortunately not subjected to tantrums, petty arguments or catty exchanges, so typical of today's reality TV content, but we do see banter among the members and several spontaneous moments. The camera also, perhaps dubiously, follows Trudy, Sting's wife, to the hospital where we witness her giving birth to their son Jake. The event actually occurred while this was being made,  and it is still part of the footage.     The \\"Bring On the Night\\" video culminates in the live concert. Not surprisingly, despite playing unfamiliar music with an unorthodox mix of instrumentalists in front of an SRO French (that's non-English) audience in Paris, Sting brings the house down. The finished songs are both well-polished and exciting as is their performance, which is near flawless. He finishes the evening with an encore of a few selected Police songs, including \\"Message In a Bottle\\" which he sings alone on stage - while final credits roll. The show removed any lingering doubts in my mind, low those many years ago, that the lad from Newcastle is indeed a musical genius. Now in this digitized format, it sounds and looks better than ever and is as inspiring as it was two decades before.
B000004166|5.0|The artistic personality of Artur Grumiaux was undoubtedly very sober. In comparision with the warmth of a David Oistrakh or the powerful musculature of Heifetz, his golden and flawless intonation was if I may, unique. His sonority and style did not belong to bravura style. He was an accurate and impressive violinist. His Mozart is crystalline and innocent. Once more, his presence in various  performances in Prades Festival transformed and even improved his spelling touch. As you know all the artists who participated in this unequal Festival acquired a giant dimension. It is not by mere hazard that names of the height of Joseph Szigeti, Eugene Istomin, Rudolf Serkin, Sandor Vegh, Isaac Stern, William Kapell, Clara Haskill - above their innate skills - experienced Casals' spell. And because of this experience there was an immediate rapport with Clara Haskill and recorded one of the most incredible sets of Mozart `s Sonatas for violin that I'  have heard ever.<br />And, despite his brief existence 1921-1986 his name will be resounding in the world of the violin during years and years. His honesty and integrity , technique and musicianship, self possession and aristocratic feature confer a special honor place. Go and get all what you can about Mozart, Faure Sonatas, his Haendel sonatas for violin, his Debussy Sonata, Guilleme Lekeu, Paganini 4th, and his version of Franck's sonata for violin is one of the most lyrical ever recorded.<br />An unforgettable artist!
B0007OCG4W|2.0|Four of the most physically attractive and artistically talented actors of the Big Screen come together under the direction of the brilliant Mike Nichols to perform in \\"Closer,\\" an adaptation of Patrick Marber's brutal play, and the result is 104 minutes of utter depression and angst. I thoroughly appreciate the performances of Julia Roberts, Jude Law, Clive Owens and Natalie Portman. Their acting skills are not in question here, and frankly, they're all a pleasure to watch. Eye-candy aside, however, I just viewed the movie and feel like someone hit me over the head with a sledgehammer - not a state I appreciate, nor one I would pay to return to. \\"Closer\\" is a film about four loathsome people - actually only three are detestable, one is just terribly self-destructive, which is why she hangs out with the others. Although not devoid of merit, this is a cold and wounding piece that left me raw. I am not warning you away. But please do consider my comments before you commit to watch this film. Think aftermath.<br /><br />Dan, (Law), and Alice, (Portman), give each other the eye as they walk toward each other on a London street. She is luscious and so is he. When she steps off the curb and is hit by a cab, Dan is by her side in a second. Lying in the street, Alice regains consciousness, looks up at him and says, \\"Hello stranger.\\" As he accompanies her to the Emergency Room we discover that he is a journalist - a novelist wannabe - who writes obituaries by day. She is a former stripper from New York City, on a trip across the big Pond. The chemistry between the two is palpable and they hook right up.<br /><br />A year or so later Dan is being photographed for his newly published novel's back cover. The book is about the life of his live-in love, Alice. Anna, (Roberts), is the talented photographer, who specializes in making portraits of strangers. As she snaps away and poses Dan, he makes a play for her. They talk, flirt, kiss passionately - and then Anna discovers he is taken. She makes it clear to Dan that she is recently divorced and not about to mess up any one else's life. He is in a relationship with Alice. He is not available. Period! Alice comes to meet Dan at the studio. She senses something's up very quickly. Then Anna takes Alice's photograph, while tears run down the poor girl's face.<br /><br />Dan becomes obsessed with Anna and stalks her, unbeknownst to Alice. Shortly after the scene at the photography studio, we are introduced to Larry, (Owen), a dermatologist. He is fooling around in a sex chat room on the Internet, having torrid cyber sex with a person he believes to be a woman named Anna. It is really Dan. The outcome of this online tete-a-tete is a set-up for Larry to meet the real Anna at the aquarium. Dan's prank, revenge for the brush-off he received, results in a romance between Larry and Anna. Then the real fooling around begins.<br /><br />Four former strangers, all remotely connected, have become two couples. Each person seems to love his/her mate, yet are compelled to destroy their love, and each other's relationships. Betrayal is a characteristic three of the four share. Dan lusts after Anna, and believes himself \\"in love\\" with her, because Anna doesn't \\"need him.\\" Dan also loves Alice, who loves him madly, but she is too needy. Larry is crazy about Anna. He says it is love, yet people who love each other certainly don't act as manipulative and nasty as Larry does. But then, with Anna, manipulation may the only game in town. Anna is chronically depressed and doesn't think she deserves to be happy. She wants Dan, but he is not available, so she commits to Larry. Then she becomes unhappy and decides that deception may not be so terrible after all. And Larry, who is not to be underestimated, is ruthlessly capable of anything in order to get what he wants. Three characters are narcissistic, cruel, totally obsessed with pain and wrecking emotional havoc. The fourth, Alice, simply seems to hate herself. Is there a plot here? No!! As a character study, what's there to study? There is nothing complex about these people, nor their interactions. On a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being sublimely happy and 1 being suicidally depressed, these four never manage a 5.<br /><br />Natalie Portman does a superb job, bringing an appealing freshness and vulnerability to the edgy, jaded Alice. Clive Owen's character is the most complex, and his range of emotions really gets a work-out here. He is charming as Anna's suitor, enraged as the betrayed lover, and relentless as the gamesman out for revenge. Jude Law, the cad, comes on strong until his legs are knocked out from under him. Then he is appropriately devastated. Not pretty, but talented. And Julia Roberts, whom I love, is quiet, depressed and odious in her betrayals. The dialogue is very good at times, with snappy, caustic one-liners. My rating is more about personal preference than the movie's overall worth. While this may be an interesting cinematic experience for many, it gave me a headache.<br /><br />JANArself. Is there a plot here? No!! As a character study, what's there to study?

B00081U6EG|4.0|I have always trusted DVD products from Eagle Vision and in my collection of 300+ DVD concerts their label dominates my shelf. I have been anxiously awaiting the release of this product for a couple of months and upon picking up a copy a couple of days ago and  was thrilled to see the DTS logo on the back of the DVD case AND on the DVD disc within...after reading the line up of artists I looked forward to loading this disc up and enjoying the show in DTS! I cannot fault the venue, artists, camera work or video and sound of Dolby Digital 5.1, but THERE IS NO DTS SOUNDTRACK AS CLEARLY STATED ON THE DVD CASE OR DISC...if there is a DTS SOUNDTRACK there is no way to access same, what a pity, what a shame! While I will keep my DTS lacking copy of this concert as it is excellant in every aspect IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THAT MUCH SWEETER IN DTS (as advertised)! The availability of DTS certainly would have earned this Eagle Vision product a 5 Star rating in my eyes. I personally feel that Eagle Vision needs to issue an apology for such a bungle as well as sending duped purchasers a true DTS encoded version. [...] In future, I will be very wary of purchasing future Eagle Vision products that sport the DTS logo.

B0009KA7BS|1.0|Terrible adaptation of the great comic book \\"Hellblazer\\" is nothing short of a spit in the eye of the fans of the comic book with a terrible and down right crude performance by Keanu Reeves, who makes a joke out of one of the most beloved cult comic book characters made in the last twenty years. His performance is bad to the point of wanting to throw something at the screen just out of sheer rage. The screenplay is a joke and the dialog rages from bad to much worse as the movie progresses and the special effects are so badly done that the monsters would have been better off if they were puppets instead. Some of the actors in the film are better than the film itself with great performances by Rachel Weisz, who is the only ray of light this movie really has and Djimon Hounsou, who is the only actor who does his comic book character any justice. Despite Rachel Weisz, the movie is bad and not even her talent could have saved it.
B00005JLEJ|5.0|After seeing some of Kurosawa's early film classics I had high expectations for this later color film. To my surprise, the film turns out to be one of his best! The gorgeous cinematography and its striking approach to detail and composition place it in my list of greatest films. Criterion has done a great job - well worth the price of admission. The film also sparked some interest in me in the history of Japan and the life of Shignen.
0440213525|5.0|This is about some guy and his name is John Grisham. John Grisham is an author and he    wrote a book called \\"The Client\\". This is a pretty cool book because there was a lot of dialogue. The dialogue was awesome because throughout the whole book people would not stop talking. There were no parts in the book where the narrator pops up and says a few lines, the characters talk throughout the whole book. <br /> You probably already know what this book is really about. If you don't know, it's about a boy named Mark. He has a brother and his name is Rick or Ricky. They have a mother but I forgot what her name was. Mark and Ricky watched some guy kill himself and Mark talked to the guy who killed himself. Now they are on the news, the FBI wants to talk to Mark, and the mafia is after Mark and his family because the guy who committed suicide was affiliated with the mafia. <br /> This is such a good book and if you haven't read it you should read it. I recommend other people to read this book.They should read it because they could learn something from it. If they're interested in being a lawyer they should read it . that is something that I would do but I am not interested in law school. <br />
B0000025DR|5.0|Face The Music, the Electric Light Orchestra's fifth album, was the very first vinyl longplayer that I bought with my own money just over 29 years ago, and it remains one of the most innovative, best-produced records ever. I simply couldn't get enough of \\"Evil Woman\\" once I heard it around Thanksgiving of 1975, but the aptly-titled \\"Strange Magic\\" cast its own irresistible spell and closed the deal 3 months later (\\"Can't Get It Out Of My Head\\" - from Eldorado - apparently wasn't just a song title, but an ELO - related condition!) The innocent AM radio listener buying Face The Music and familiar with merely those three hits was accosted by the (still) scary-as-hell mutant soliloquy (which wouldn't have been at all out of place on the \\"Beneath The Planet of the Apes\\" soundtrack) and stentorian strains of \\"Fire On High\\", soon to become surprisingly inescapable well into the Eighties. Every second of this album has been burned forever into my mind; in particular, I will never forget the tribal, Native American interlude of \\"Waterfall\\". Or \\"Poker\\", the perfect Bee Gees/Sweet hybrid that pays much tribute to both groups. And it is such seemingly incongruous instrumental arrangements that elevate Face The Music to something more than just another post-British Invasion effort, the key to its enduring vitality.  A plaintive yet urgent paean to ELO co-founder Jeff Lynne's musical inspirations, \\"Nightrider\\" gallops off into the West End gloom, a third hit single that wasn't. Then again, EVERY song on this record had single potential. Lynne erred badly when he overestimated the willingness of fans to pay for another elaborate variation on the spaceship stage set that, at the time, had yet to become ELO's visual schtick, and the 2001 tour in support of ZOOM was doomed as a result, although Sony didn't make either a priority. Its cancellation was a major kick in the teeth for me, never having seen the group live, and ZOOM was one of the best albums to bear that florid ELO cursiveacronym; in fact, one of the year's best, period. The short-lived tour also featured a heartfelt, no-less ethereal rendition of \\"One Summer Dream\\", which to this day instantly transports me back to 1976, for better or worse. Like contemporaries Earth, Wind and Fire with \\"I'll Write A Song For You\\", better late than never, Lynne recognized that \\"One Summer Dream\\" was truly indispensible and finally made amends by adding it to the ZOOM setlist. While there have been many artists distinctly influenced by Face The Music,  none may have been more affected than Seal (was he not born to sing \\"Strange Magic\\"?) and a distinct appreciation of ELO can be periodically discerned in his material.....still an essential listen.
0440180295|5.0|This is a novel that I would like to suggest to anyone. Simply saying, it is enjoyable, yet thought provoking. Along with the attractiveness of a science fiction novel, it addresses various points, not only the gruesome aspects of the war but also issues involving crimes and punishments. <br /> <br />Despite the fact that the fire-bombing of Dresden was as worse as the atomic-bomb attack in Hiroshima, not many people gave attention to it, maybe because it didn't involve advanced and historical weapons, or didn't affect the overall war effort greatly. However, the number of people who died still matters. They are the same lives as the people who died by the atomic bomb. And this book's attempt to turn people's attention to the Dresden massacre has succeeded, performing its antiwar purpose.  <br />The novel also shows war criminals that have been punished, including Campbell who have committed suicide before getting a trial on treason, and poor old Edgar Derby who was sentenced to death because of a teapot that he took from the remaining. In addition, Billy later gets killed by an assassin because of a crime that he didn't even commit during the war. These examples show that punishments given during wars can't be fair, again emphasizing the injustice of war.  <br /> <br />It was a unique attempt to combine a nonfiction war story with a sci-fi, and I believe that it was quite successful. I guarantee that the readers' trips to Dresden and Tralfamadore with Billy would be both worthwhile and entertaining.  <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|Normally I don't write reviews on music this old, but I felt compelled to based on its high level of appreciation and talent. <br /> <br />Nirvana came around just as I had finished high school, a few months after I believe, and as I was entering college. Their new single \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" was like an anthem on my college campus, everyone knew about it and played over and over again. I knew about new bands back then like Pearl Jam and Soundgarden, but Nirvana seemed to have crushed them all with its fist, dominating radio waves as well as the music scene on campus.  <br /> <br />The first song \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\", a four-chord rocker, was something I immediately liked as soon as I first heard it. I would go on to eventually buy the album and then be stunned to find songs on here at the same level of intensity and creativity as their famous song. (I would eventually get a lap dance to \\"In Bloom\\" and make out to \\"Lithium\\") <br /> <br />Their other songs elevated to anthem status, with every song capturing its own spotlight based on what it was like. \\"In Bloom\\" was a very intense song, with incredible guitar work and crisp drumming. \\"Come as You Are\\" I found was a very gothic sounding piece, and I made me think of depressing times in my life. Yet, the song eventually caught on and became a work of art. <br /> <br />\\"Breed\\" is a very heavy song, and so is \\"Territorial Pissings\\", which not very many people like, but I do. These songs start off intense and end intense, they have no soft spots between them. Yet, there are soft songs on this album, \\"Polly\\" and the very awkward yet eerily soothing \\"Something In the Way\\". Each of these songs is a solo by Kurt and his guitar. <br /> <br />The other songs became masterpieces in their own right, \\"On A Plain\\" was very interesting to me and every time I put it on, it still confuses me a bit. I don't know why, it's just mystifying. <br /> <br />In the end, the album was rather remarkable. It changed the way rock was visualized and perceived. I thought of rock back in '91 as nothing but crazy guitar done by people in comical long hair and disturbing make-up. I was not a fan of this wacko music. Nirvana was different, they saw something different than what the mainstream saw it as, and changed it with this album. In the post-Nirvana age, people create music but you can tell some of them try to cop Nirvana's depressing yet angry style of play.  <br /> <br />I know that this album is so old and not really listened to that much anymore, but if anyone wants to hear classic grunge at its finest, I suggest you pick up this album. Trust me, you won't regret it.
B00008WT5M|5.0|To Be Thunderstruck !!!!!!!!!! <br />Excellent Sound in the remaster. Totally Awesome overall sound, with crystal clear guitar, great drums, and an awesome bass. <br />This Album to be played at VOLUME  lads !!! <br />I know the songs for the most part , but got it today with a introduction to some tunes I have never  heard before, all brilliant. <br />And this is the Album with AC/DC's great Christmas Song, and what a Christmas wish it is !!!!!!! <br /> <br />ENJOY !!!!!!!!
B0000028M7|5.0|This album has got to be one of the best works of music ever created. Jerry Cantrell is a creative genius who actually pours his heart into the guitar. He, in my opinion, is what made Alice In Chains so incredible and extraordinary. <br /> <br />Layne Staley, the troubled frontman, wrote lyrics that were a bit confusing but if you actually got what he was saying, you could tell he was an angry soul, spiraling downward apparently because of his strong addiction to heroin and cocaine. Songs like \\"Down In a Hole\\" and \\"Junkhead\\" are prime examples of his sickening addiction. <br /> <br />Behind the excessively depressing lyrics was the musical prodigy Jerry Cantrell, as I had said above. His guitar work flows smoothly with the theme of the album, angry and morbid. The sound of the guitar in \\"Rooster\\" and \\"Angry Chair\\" are great when matched with Layne Staley's lyrics.  <br /> <br />If you were to go out and try to find a similar album to \\"Dirt\\", I could guarantee you that you couldn't. Artists today do not put in feeling and past experiences into their music, but rather an \\"I'm confused\\" demeanor to talentless music, like the bands \\"Creed\\" and \\"Third Eye Blind\\". People just don't make music like they used to. <br /> <br />To find music with passion, heartache, and powerful messages, I suggest you listen to \\"Dirt\\". This album is similar to none, a unique feel to grunge music. The flow and theme of the album compare to that of a lost feeling, one in which there is no hope of regaining what you once had. This album smacked one right on the nose. <br /> <br />Hands down, there will never be another album like \\"Dirt\\". <br /> <br />
0440213525|2.0|I have listened to an amazing book The Client, this great book was written by John Grisham. I liked this book because of all the action in the book was great. Some people I think can relate to a story like this or they have experienced it. I liked the dialogue in the story the way it flows. The characters have a lot of great discussions in the book. Out of most of the discussions I liked it when 11year old Mark Sway and his Lawyer Reggie love were talking. The other conversations were also interesting, but there was something about Mark and Reggie in the story. Some how they just connected right from the start he knew he could trust Reggie. Everything that Mark had told Reggie he trusted her with some the secrets he had told her. <br /> As I was listening to the story I herd a lot of foreshadowing in the story. Like when the book was telling Mark's thoughts and actions. That quickly gave you an idea of what Marks next move was. The part when he called the cops he didn't say he was there when it happened. Then he thought to himself if he should tell the cops or not. He also kept thinking if he did he would be taken to jail, and never sees his brother or mom again. Right there the book told you that Mark wouldn't think the cops would believe him. The book also told you that he was not going to tell the cops what really went down between him and the man who commended suicide. <br /> I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to learn a lesson from this book. I learned that you should tell the truth or everything will turn in to a big mess. It better to tell the truth before you get in to any more trouble and face serious consequences. I am not really sure what other people will learn from this book. This book is really emotional you can learn to trust others around you or something. I think anyone who reads this book will learn something great from it liked I did. <br />
B000063DHK|5.0|If you are new to Iron Maiden or are simply looking for a good live album this is the one to get. It blows Rock in Rio out of the water because this was during Iron Maiden's \\"epic\\" age. You'll find songs like Phantom Of The Opera, Revelations, Number of the Beast, Die With Your Boots On Rime of the Ancient Mariner, Hallowed be Thy Name, and more! The sound quality is great too! This is their best live album.
0394586077|5.0|Dragon Lance is a great book. Some of the words are difficult but not too hard. There are great characters in this book. Tasslehoff \\"steals\\" the show, or as he would say \\"borrowed it.\\" Tanis is the main character. He is half-elf and half-human and very wise. My favorite character is Raistlin because he uses a magical staff to help him.  The writers created a whole new world, called Krynn. They made all new creatures. The world is amazing! I wasn't into reading books until my brother gave this book to me. The fights they get into are crazy, but they usually get out of them. <br /> <br />    I would recommend this book to any one that likes magic and sword fights, because this book is full of them.
B00070Q8DQ|5.0|Hey Death Metal fanz!  I'm one of you -- I like to write funny reviews that belittle every other form of music except the ultra-creative, highly informative, and extremely talented death metal.  Any other form of hard rock, or even plain old metal, will be the subject of my Satanic wrath!! \m/  I will not rest until my incendiary comments help drive away even more hard rock and metal fans, so that only rap and pop are left.  I mean, I really loved the band the Crown and Immortal, but it's o.k. to sacrifice them in the name of driving away fans and purifying metal, am I right? \m/ <br /> <br />I just like to keep it real like my boy Fred Durst's #1 fan.  By now you all know that he really is a Death Metal fan.  He writes funny reviews that are the opposite of the way that he actually feels.  All of this is disguised (very thinly I might add, but who cares?!? \m/) under a witty banter of fawning for band like Limp Bizkit, Staind, Trapt, etc.  But ... one time he was reverse-bashing a mainstream band (Mudvayne I think) while at the same time reverse-praising Megadeath.  That's confusing, because I remember the '90's and Megadeath were about the biggest sell-outs around.  I loved \\"Rust in Peace\\" - great metal album, but after that the boys toned it WAY down for the radio, culminating in the heaping pile of process fish sticks call \\"Risk\\".  Wow, that album made anything by Staind sound like thrash.   <br /> <br />Also, one bands that play solos can be given credibility.  THERE IS NO EXCEPTION.  Otherwise, how would you be able to tell if a band was any good, am I right? \m/  I mean, bands like Winger, Cinderella, Poison ... they all had solos, so they must be tha tru metal.  Ain't that right? \m/ <br /> <br />Anyway, keep it loud and proud metal fans.  Remember, our goal ... eliminate all forms of metal from the planet by 2008!  Although, its disappearing so fast it may be gone even sooner!! Two horns way up!!  \m/ <br />
B0002XDODU|5.0|The German industrial heavy metal band Rammstein (which means literally, a battering ram comprised of stone) formed in 1993. The band's six members that include vocalist Till Lindemann (who includes setting himself in fire as part of their performances), guitarist Richard Z. Kruspe-Bernstein, guitarist Paul H. Landers, bass player Oliver Riedel, percussionist Christoph Schneider and keyboard player Christian \\"Flake\\" Lorenz were all born in what was formerly East Germany.  Consequently, it is not surprising that Rammstein's music has been on the darker side; but their popularity across Europe, as well as the U.S., has only continued to rise with each new album.  This is certainly the case with their fifth album released in 2004 entitled \\"Reise, Reise\\". <br /> <br />\\"Reise, Reise\\" contains 11 highly poetic songs with most of the lyrics in Rammstein's native German and totaling nearly 48 minutes in length. <br /> <br />1. \\"Reise, Reise\\" (\\"Arise, Arise\\").  A song about sailors arising to fight. <br />2. \\"Mein Teil\\" (\\"My Part\\").  A very dark song about modern-day cannibalism that was probably inspired by a well-publicized case in Germany in 2003. <br />3. \\"Dalai Lama\\".  A dark song seemingly about a difficult airplane flight and crash; i.e., about people who died. The song's title refers to the leader of Tibetan Buddhists.  The current Dalai Lama is afraid of flying. <br />4. \\"Keine Lust\\" (\\"No Pleasure\\").  A song about feeling frigid. <br />5. \\"Los\\" (\\"-less\\").  A highly poetic song with multiple meanings talking about being nameless and songless and without music. <br />6. \\"Amerika\\" (\\"America\\").  With lyrics in both English and German, a critique of American culture and world influence. <br />7. \\"Moskau\\" (\\"Moscow\\"). With lyrics in both Russian and German, the song recalls Moscow during the Soviet Union with references to Lenin and a former Soviet youth group called \\"The Pioneers\\" that also existed in East Germany. <br />8. \\"Morgenstern\\" (\\"Morning Star\\"). A poetic song about an ugly woman. <br />9. \\"Stein um Stein\\" (\\"Stone by Stone\\"). Another poetic song about walling someone in, stone by stone. <br />10. \\"Ohne dich\\" (\\"Without You\\").  A song about a lost love. <br />11. \\"Amour\\" (the French word for \\"Love\\").  A song about love. <br /> <br />Overall, I rate Rammstein's 2004 album \\"Reise, Reise\\" with 5 out of 5 stars and highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys industrial heavy metal regardless fluency in German.
B0008ISM40|5.0|You should know by now if you like Trent Reznor's crazy industrial sound. If you do, this is a great album. Full of good songs ranging from loud to soft, but all with the great anger and bitterness that can only come from Nine Inch Nails. Oh, and buy it in Dualdisc if you have a surround setup that can take advantage of it. I've been listening to these songs in my room on a Logitech X-530 5.1 Channel Surround being pumped out of my PC by a Creative Audigy 2 ZS sound card. Makes all the difference. You'd be surprised how much you pick up in a familiar song listening to it in surround. Anyway... so... go NIN!
B0007OCG4W|1.0|Yes, I am one of the critics who feel that there was gratuitous profanity and unlikeable characters in this film. These are valid criticisms because I find it hard to understand why anyone would sit for almost two hours watching people who are detestable and who swear like Jerry Springer guests.     No, I am not from Fantasyland. I work in a profession that has more reality than the average person has to ever confront and I do not shy away from films which are steeped in realism. I am also not offended by profanity and speak my share of it.    Having said that, CLOSER is a pointless exercise in filmmaking because it simply turns a camera onto four vacuous, shallow people and expects to engage the audience in their meaningless lives. This approach fails for the following:      All four characters are cold, selfish, and detestable. I tried very hard to care about them, but it was impossible. They have no values, are all morally bankrupt, and believe only in using others like filthy washcloths. If this sounds like the kind of \\"real\\" people you like to engage with, then you will love this movie.      The four main characters spend the movie lying to each other and professing \\"love\\" for one another, but it is not love they exhibit, but merely lust. Their lives are empty, boring and tedious. There is no purpose to anything they do, except their own gratification.      The male characters keep asking their wives/mistresses for \\"honesty,\\" as if it's a commodity to be exchanged and bartered. This \\"honesty\\" usually involves a high level of profanity, which at times is so over the top one ceases to care what the characters are saying.      If this level of vulgarity is as common as others would have us believe, then I truly weep for civilization. Profanity for profanity's sake is not edgy, enlightening or subversive. It is merely crass, trashy and low-class.      Perhaps I'm showing my age (38) by criticizing this movie. I realized I might have enjoyed this movie when I was inmy 20's, when frivolous relationships and cussing were fun and exciting. As a responsible adult, this type of behavior to me now is abhorrant and I can't stand to be around ill-mannered boors like the ones depicted in this film.      I am nostalgic for Mike Nichols' earlier work, like THE GRADUATE, WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF, and CARNAL KNOWLEDGE, which were truly cutting edge. CLOSER is based on a play, which confirms for me why I don't see modern plays if they are this repellant.      The only plus is the acting, which is quite excellent, even the ubiquitous Jude Law, who can be quite annoying (anyone see ALFIE?). Natalie Portman is especially good as the hollow, spurned stripper with a heart of vinegar. Julia Roberts does well as a distant, emotionally stunted photographer, and Clive Owen steals the movie as the perverted, sex crazed, profanity spewing Neanderthal.      Again, this is not a review from Fantasyland. I like reality in my movies as much as those who rave about this movie (I loved THE WOODSMAN and A LOVE SONG FOR BOBBY LONG). However, none of the characters in CLOSER have anything redeemable or likeable to them and the movie becomes nothing more than a tawdry, repulsive, soporific soap opera. And that song that opens and closes the movie...who chose this dirge? The singer warbles repeatedly off-key, \\"Can't take my eyes off of you..\\" like he's having his appendix removed. This song almost drove me mad.    See CLOSER to discover why Clive Owen and Natalie Portman were nominated for Oscars, but prepare to be assaulted by crude language and cruder characters.
0061015725|3.0|I walk away from Prey with mixed feelings.  Admittedly, I was entertained by the book, but when I look back I feel somewhat tricked.  Prey reminded me of something that I did often in college - I'd get so hungry that I would seek out and consume an entire meal of exceptionally low-quality food; only upon finishing would I realize that it sort of sucked.  It certainly seemed good at the time.  In the case of Prey, mostly the entire thing was devoured at such a pace that I hardly noticed the book's occasional ridiculousness, particularly near the end (kisses of death?), nor did I really mind the thin characters (and thinner enemy).<br /><br />If that was all there was to say about Prey, I would have been pretty disappointed.  Fortunately, the book's look at various interdisciplinary sciences and technologies definitely held my attention.  Yes, it is a mostly negative portrayal of artificial life and nanotechnology (though Crichton never mentions it by name, the doomsday grey goo scenario definitely inspires this work) and yes, the events that take place here are over-the-top, but let's not fool ourselves - this is science fiction.  You could make an argument that one function of good science fiction is to get us to reflect on the impact that technology has/could have on our lives, despite how exaggerated and unrealistic the claims may be (hence fiction).<br /><br />In Prey, everything is oversimplified (it has to be) and at times way too much liberty is taken with emergence (think: \\"What?  The swarm can now ______?!  It must be emergent behavior!\\").  Ironically, I found that what really drove the book was, in fact, the emergence and evolutionary computing aspects - these were way more intriguing than the nanotechnology or Prey's thesis of unintended consequences.<br /><br />Crichton weaves all of this into a suitable storyline... I wouldn't say a \\"good\\" storyline, but it works, and it holds your interest for sure.  You weren't going to read this book for the colorful characters anyway, much like how I, in college, wasn't eating that greasy pizza for its rich, exotic flavors.  I was eating it because it was quick and tasty, and as I mentioned, Prey is a fast read and serves up some tasty ideas (many science-based, and many fiction-based).  Ultimately, this is what makes it safe for consumption.lorful characters anyway, much like how I, in college, wasn't eating that greasy pizza for its rich, exotic flavors.

B000001FRY|4.0|Some people may not feel the need to know U2 before the \\"War\\" album, or even \\"The Joshua Tree\\", but those folks are indeed missing out. This debut is a very strong album, from a band with many very strong albums. Obviously it has the most in common with \\"October\\" and \\"War\\", but this is the start right here. There's also as much emotion within these songs as there is in anything else they've done. In a way this is the band at their most simple, which really may be the best way to hear them. Much before the hype, much before the 90's make-over, this is U2 when they were....well, boys. A debut to rival \\"Murmur\\" and \\"Boys Don't Cry\\".
0743244257|5.0|Cosmopolis in years to come will be regarded as one of the shining lights of the DeLillo ouvre. This great American writer since the early 70's in his aptly named debut, Americana, has been telling us all what these United States of America is becoming - a country so awash in materialism and the false herald of the religious right that its people cannot understand any mock satiric of its way of life. The Amazon reviews of Cosmopolis reflect this sad fact. Let's make millions on the stretch limo drive to get a haircut. All is vanity in this the ultimate tale of greed.
0440213525|3.0|I like this book because it was about 2 little boys named Mark and Ricky Sway that witness a suicide that happens in the woods while they went out to have a smoke.The man they seen that had commit suicide was a lawyer named Romey.Romey wanted to commit suicide because his clinet known as Barry the blade had killed this senetar named Boi Boyette.Barry puts the body under Romeys garage then tells Romey about the body and where he had put it.Before Romey was about to kill himself he wanted to tell someone about the body of Bio Boyette and his clint Barry the blade.Romey tells mark all he wanted to tell someone before he had commit suicide.Mark calls the police and tells them that there was a suicide in the woods the police find Mark and ask him if Romey told him anything about a senetar named Boi Boyette Mark tells them he doesn't know anything about the senetar because he doesn't want to get in trouble.There is alot of dialogue in this book that's what makes this book so interesting an example of dialogue in this book is when mark frist goes to Reggie and tells har about his problem and having to meet with the FBI at noon.Yes I would recommend anyone to read this book.
B0007TKH66|1.0|Count me among those who \\"just don't get it.\\" Enterprise bored me from the very first episode, and even with the handful of better episodes that emerged in the fourth season, the show never came close to other Trek series. It had no sense of awe, no sense of humor, no original stories, and a wasted premise. Plus, Scott Bakula is without a doubt the worst starship captain ever, a one-note character played by a bland, boring actor. If you want good Trek, look to Star Trek Voyager instead. If you want great sci-fi, wait for Battlestar Galactica (the new series) to come out on DVD. Enterprise is one long snooze, and I'm glad it's over.

1558908323|3.0|The idea of a genetic mutation miscalculation which leads to the higher evolution of insects to adopt human ways is not impossible.  Del Toro took a very X-file-ish theme and created a very enjoyable sci-fi thriller.  The movie was very fast paced and both the horror and suspense elements were done just right, not too little and not too overdone. <br /> <br />A few things I didn't like about this film was some of its more subtle things.  Mira Sorvino was playing an entomologist, yet when she studies or investigate specimens, she takes no logical safety precautions.  The same recklessness occurs repeatedly for her and every other cast throughout movie.  Things like touching bugs that likely carry unknown diseases with your bare hands, or when they go underground to hunt for the roaches without any type of scientific or safety equipments is just very illogical to me.  To think that in the beginning of the movie, the city undergone a catastrophic epidemic that were spread by roaches and for them to go on the rest of the movie every time without any planning or taking precaution is just unthinkable.  The plot was nicely written and the story flowed well, but the reckless actions from supposedly \\"experts\\" just kills it.  It doesn't just happen once or twice, but every single time.  A number of scenes also seemed very forced and felt like they were put there just so the story can continue the way the director wanted, yet they made no logical sense. <br /> <br />Despite the few imperfections, this movie is still a great watch.  I definitely recommend a rental if you are looking for a nice action thriller to kill a saturday night.
B000002KB8|5.0|After Led Zeppelin had released there first 2 albums in 1969 the blueprint of Heavy Metal music was laid down. Now all that was needed was for someone to take that blueprint and expand upon it. With Their debut black Sabbath had taken the heavy Metal blueprint one step further, not quite there but close.Heres What I think Of the songs.    1.Black Sabbath (5/5)-Quite possibly the heaviest song ever,and probably the first song ever about Satan  2.The Wizard (5/5)-One of my favorite Sabbath songs, the harmonica goes so well with the song  3.Wasp/Behind the Wall of Sleep/Bassically/N.I.B. (5/5)-is actually called just N.I.B. the other titles are just different parts of the song divided up and given a name,a song about the devil falling in love,some say N.I.B. stands for Nativity In Black.  4.Wicked World (4.5/5)- Great blues song, the British LP features a cover of the song Evil Woman instead of this track  5.Bit of Finger/Sleeping Village/Warning (5/5)- A blues cover of the song Warning, one of Tony Iommi best performances on guitar    If you like Classic Rock, Hard Rock or Metal buy this album. If you like blues check this album out.    If you like this album you might also like-  Led Zeppelin-Led Zeppelin   Uriah Heep-Uriah Heep  Alice Cooper-Schools Out  Deep Purple-Deep Purple In Rock
B00005JMXX|4.0|If you are looking for a movie that's a feast for your eyes, then look no further.  The special effects within The Day After Tomorrow is one of the most gorgeous I've ever seen.  From the subtle hail storms in Tokyo to the tornadoes in Los Angeles, from the freezing blizzard in Scotland to the great flood and the aftermath of the catastrophe in New York City, every scene will leave you breathless. <br /> <br />Now for the negatives.  To be honest, this movie was probably never made with the intention of having people sceond guess the plot or figure out what is going on, so if you are looking for a philosophical, intellectual type of end of the world movie, you will not find it here.  I can't say the movie was crystal clear, but most of the plots were highly predictable, and the few parts that they did try to make it into something, it doesn't really contribute that much to the movie.  It just flowed like a beautiful picture book, but with few words or substance in it.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a great story, just not one that you need to ponder about or second guess the plotlines. <br /> <br />It's a fantastic movie for younger viewers, but due to its lack of substance, sophisticated adults will likely find it lacks a certain charm that makes a movie a classic.  None the less, I still think it's worth a buy for movie(DVD) collectors (like me) because it's just too beautiful of a motion picture to pass up.
0743454537|5.0|I am a fan of Picoult and was eager to get my hands on this book.  I was not dissappointed - had a hard time putting it down.  Exquisitely written, insightful and with believable characters.  Picoult handles a tought subject with care and a realistic hand.  Strongly recommended - especially if you enjoyed \\"The Pact\\" or \\"Vanishing Act\\"

0060090367|2.0|I have read Marian Keyes' Sushi for Beginners, The Other Side of the Story and now Watermelon. I have found her to be an entertaining writer. I have had several laughs. Having said that, I think Watermelon was not her best work that I have read as of yet. To put it bluntly, it annoyed me. I felt like the author had diarrhea of the mouth. She had her characters go on these tangents about absolutely nothing. She had inanimate objects and emotions have conversations for crying out loud. It was just plain silly. Come on...a sock having a conversation...jealously having a conversation?? Oh please. I could have dealt with this if it happened just a couple of times, but it was all through out the book!! Needless to say, I skipped many, many paragraphs. <br /> <br />One more annoying thing, the main character is talking directly to you, the reader. I always think that is lazy writing. It makes me think that the author wasn't skilled enough compose a fluent story, therefore had to use a more simple technique.  <br /> <br />Now that I got that out of the way, I read this book all of the way through. It obviously didn't annoy me enough to stop reading it. It was a light and quick read, which was just what I was looking for. <br /> <br />Although it wasn't nearly my favorite Keyes book so far, I will buy her others as I have enjoyed the two out of three that I have read.
0060930187|5.0|Wheh..this was very good. It was so interesting watching Esther slowly spiral into a place she couldn't escape. I can see why this novel caused such a stir, back in the day. I can imagine that there are still some pretty oppressive schools that would FREAK if a teacher were to assign this novel...although I think it would make great high school reading. Some of Esther's stifling obstacles are not quite as true in today's world, but most are and/or have been replaced by others.
0440213525|3.0|This is a good book yes, I would recommend other people to read this the Client  <br /> <br />because if you like mystery books this would be a good book to read. The Client holds  <br /> <br />you on the edge of your seat, you never know what is going to happen next. One of the  <br /> <br />literary terms that I recognized was dialogue. It was used in like every other sentence. In  <br /> <br />one sentence Mark would say something that would give us clues. In the next sentence  <br /> <br />Ricki would say something that would give is clues. Throughout this whole book its  <br /> <br />giving you clues. It was not only Mark, and Ricki it was sometimes it was Reggie, and  <br /> <br />Mom. Some of the main characters in the story are Ricki, Reggie, Mom, and Mark is a  <br /> <br />kid that thinks hes cool, smokes cigarettes to be cool. Ricki is a kid that wants to learn  <br /> <br />how to smoke so he could be cool like his brother. Reggie is a sneaky lawyer, example in  <br /> <br />the middle of the story Mark has to go in and talk to the F. B. I., so Reggie puts a small  <br /> <br />recorder on him so she can try and catch the F. B. I. Moms the character that has to take <br /> <br />care of everyone shes always worrying about her kids, and  if their gonna get in trouble or not.  <br /> <br />This is a good book i really do recommend everyone to read it.
038542471X|5.0|The author, John Grisham, did a very good job with this book.  He must have written a lot of good books. He kept me interested throughout the whole book from the beginning to the end. <br />He wrote the book with a lot of believable dialogue.  That's what kept me interested in the story.  This was sort of a mystery and action story. The characters were all interesting and believable. This story has a lot of friendship involved. <br />I recommend people to read this book because it is a very interesting and is a great mystery and action book.  I liked this book a lot.  The ending is the best part but the beginning and ending are sort of a mystery and people in the book try to solve it. <br />
B000008GHW|5.0|I first heard this in 1972, I still have the vinyl. The use of studio mixing and effects were way ahead of Jimis' time. The sound was heavy, psychedelic, rhythmic, musically sound. In my opinion this was his best effort. There would have been greater things to come. In from the storm AWESOME! Night bird flyin' great licks. EZ ryder, freedom, come on !!! This must have been a trip to be in the studio and listening to how all the tracks were put together. This album has just never gotten old for me.
B00005JLK1|2.0|While I appreciate Terry Castle, daughter of the great William Castle, with a new company called 'Dark Castle' trying to revive the quickie low budget horror genre that the 50's did so well, they're missing the mark by a longshot.  The cover of this flick looked scary enough but it never went beyond that.<br /><br />My biggest disappointment was the script, the amatuer acting and the fact that at the entire film was too well lit for any effective scares.  It was funny to hear the cast and crew say in the documentary that there are many dark room scenes?!?!  They all should really get together with notepads and watch some classic scary movies to see how it's done.  Someone on the cast also said this is a new story that has never been seen on the screen before. Maybe someone forgot to tell him about a 1953 film titled 'Ghost Ship' with a similar script.  I think all of these Dark Castle productions are remakes so far, and none very good. (13 Ghosts, House on Haunted Hill, House of Wax)<br /><br />For real and effective low budget scares, spend your time and money exploring the old classics like Last Man on Earth, The Haunting, House on Haunted Hill or Roger Cormans Poe films...
B0007N1AI6|5.0|I felt compelled to write a review for this new Judas Priest release because I have a somewhat unbiased approach to the CD.  Though I do like Judas Priest's music, I'm not one who would be identified as a fan.  In much the same vein, I like metal music, but I'm more of a casual fan. So, I listened to this CD with an open mind, but with no real expectations.  Having said that, I was blown away by \\"Angel of Retribution.\\"  I can't think of a better comeback release for a band.  Many artists or groups, like my favorite--KISS, often fail to live up to the bar set by earlier releases.  However, Judas Priest have returned with a stellar effort that is powerful, unique, and deserving of a place among the Priest catalogue.  If you're interested in this CD, I recommend it highly, even for casual fans like me.  Though there are a few (very few) weak spots (corny lyrics at times) this CD is one of the most complete and enjoyable releases to hit shelves in many years!  It's great to have Judas Priest back, and it's even better to have them release a CD that will stand up against their classics!
1932907009|5.0|In fact, I've already put this on the syllabus for my screenwriting classes.   <br /> <br />This ranks up there with Bill Martell's \\"Secrets of Action Screenwriting\\" and William Goldman's \\"Adventures of the Screen Trade\\" as a source for no-nonsense, straightforward screenwriting advice.  No can't-keep-'em-straight-without-a-program Campbellian archetypes, none of the \\"script-Nazi\\" McKee Commandments.  This is the real stuff, from a fellow who should know what he's talking about.   <br /> <br />Practical, intelligent, easy to follow, and funny.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|It's mind-boggling and disheartening to me that the ranking at Amazon for LOST IN TRANSLATION is currently so low, especially given its critical reception upon its release. This is one of the best movies I have seen in years, full of charm and insight, directed with a quirky but precise eye for detail. Wonderful performances. I can't recall who won the Oscar that year, but Bill Murray was clearly robbed. The karaoke scene begins with great humor (Murray singing Elvis Costello's WHAT'S SO FUNNY ABOUT PEACE, LOVE AND UNDERSTANDING? while an incongruously idyllic scene plays on the screen) and moves into touching beauty (Murray serenading his lovely young companion with Roxy Music's MORE THAN THIS). Well, no single movie is for everyone -- but do yourself a favor and give this one a look, because you may very well find it's for you.
0783233477|2.0|This film was mostly lost on me. I enjoyed the Pitt character though. His performance is vague, and weird, aptly playing death and all. Probably the best Ive seen from him I would say. The score was excruciatingly dramatic to the point of almost making me ill. and long ? you betcha, we got bland and lots of it ! <br />I agree with one of the other reviewers here too, all the romance just distracts from the \\"Ive come for your soul\\" premise. <br />Clair Forlani as a doctor seemed quite absurd too.
B0007P0U6W|5.0|James L. Brooks offers a mix of humor and seriousness with SPANGLISH.  Cultures clash between two different worlds, but not without the effort to bring an understanding of where each have come and where they want to be.  In this case, hollywood meets the third world.  This is a story of  single Latin American woman who ventures to the United States with her daughter to seek the opportunity to live a better life.  The daughter narrates the story as part of an essay she writes for college entry to a prestigious university.  She owes her determination and influence to her mother.  Life finally begins in the US when her mother happens to find a job working as a housekeeper with an upscale American family where she and her daughter quickly become part of the family.  In the process, she almost loses her daughter to the family.<br /><br />SPANGLISH contains an array of serious issues from alcoholism to infidelity over a laugh track of irony that each character encounter.  Adam Sandler, the chef-father, appears to take the serious guy persona as opposed to his previous comedic roles. Cloris Leachman basically steals the show as the mother-in-law who adds a little tongue and cheek one liners through out the film.  However, her daughter as played by Tea Leoni appears to be the downer of the film with her overbearing presence.<br /><br />One question comes to mind, why did Brooks choose upscale California for this semi-comedic film about a Latin American woman and her daughter making it in the United States?  Yes, stereotypes prevail, but not without the attempt to bridge the communication gap.  However, in the end each family return to their respective worlds where they can live comfortably, and possibly learn from each other's experience.
B000002LR6|5.0|Psalm 69 being their release in the summer of 1992 is one of Ministrys best albums ever. Songs like Just one fix, Jesus built my hotrod, NWO and Psalm 69 can be considered to be the most metal like album that Ministry ever recorded. It is filled to the brim with grinding guitars, angry and venemous vocals, explosive drums and special effects. Alain Jourgensen has created one of the best cross over albums ever and the lyrics and vocals showed that Jourgensen is a much better singer and lyricist then people gave him credit for previous to this ground breaking release.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This movie seems like a film that Hollywood is increasingly unable or unwilling to make, or at least unable to make well. Consider the following two facts about Finding Neverland: (a) there is virtually no profanity or sex and (b) it features a protagonist who is able to have a platonic, mature relationship with a woman who is not his wife, a relationship that he partakes in solely for the good of the woman and her family. But I think I liked the film mostly because it deals with one of my favorite topics: the human imagination. Some movies (Star Wars, etc.) are exercises in the human imagination, but don't really delve into how the exercise of imagination can affect normal everyday life. There is a tendency in some people to discount \\"escapist\\" cinema as being less worthy of artistic or cultural merit than movies that deal with \\"real\\" subjects. But as this movie shows, the fantastic can influence the real world in meaningful ways, and vice versa. It is the relationship with the widow's four sons that provided the impetus for J. M. Barrie to write his classic \\"Peter Pan\\" stageplay, and in Barrie's overactive imagination the boys found the strengh to deal with very real tragedies that had befallen their young lives. As C. S. Lewis (a writer of the fantastic whose relationship with another woman's sons is strangely similar to Barrie's) once commented, the only people who object to escapism are jailers.

B00025ETIW|3.0|MCR was a cult hit and was all the hardcore fan's \\"little secret\\". Sure, you could've gone in to Hot Topic a year ago and seen the shirt. That doesn't mean you could turn on your TV and be spammed with the overly played \\"I'm Not Okay (I Promise)\\" video.  <br /> <br />The fact is, this is a perfect example of what happens when something like MTV get's ahold of a band. Now, everyones listening to this band. The used-to-be hardcore fans now just have to let this band sweep by them and be picked up by the Crossfaders. <br /> <br />Well, while the CD lasted, it really was great. New breed of music. A kind for the emo, hardcore, rock, and punk fans in all of us. The lead singers voice is unmatched. You'll hear dark gothic whispers and high pitched screams, along with perfectly blended melodies.  <br /> <br />You'll like the CD, along with all the other couple million fans.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I avoided seeing this film for a very long time.  I hate, hate, hate hipper-than-thou indie films, and I thought this was one.  I was very wrong.  I laughed out loud from beginning to end. <br /> <br />The movie works because you like Napoleon just enough to root for him, but not so much that you feel badly for him.  He's a nerd, sure, but he's also kind of a jerk.  He hits like 3 people in the movie and never gets hit himself.  He's not a pathetic character, though you expect him to be, given typical movie stereotypes.  The understated performances are just perfect, and the little details make the movie. <br /> <br />
B00005OC0G|5.0|In Classical music, in which is never considered 'Popular' music in record stores and the general audience, Violin and Piano have been and are clearly the 'star' instruments. As a person who listens to Alternative music (Bjork, Tori Amos, Radiohead, Sigur Ros, David Bowie and others) more than Classical music, the details the previous reviewers were commenting on were useless to me.  <br /> <br />Anne-Sophie Mutter and Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, for me, are the only known violinists that makes me want to listen to classical music. In this recording, Mutter is simply breathtaking and remakes the boring (to most people) 'great' concerto into a remarkable paradise of creativity.  <br /> <br />This recording has made me dig deeper into classical music, yet her previous Beethoven recording made me feel nauseated and bored just the same as recordings by Joshua Bell and Itzhak Perlman.
B00005JMYI|4.0|I avoided this film as long as I could, watching every dumb chick flick I could find to banish the hot hairiness of Ron Burgundy from my mind. But just like I can't keep Burt Reynolds' Cosmo bearskin rug pic off my fridge, I couldn't keep Ron out of my bedroom for long. He's everything he promises, and more. Some lines in \\"Anchorman\\" had me spitting up wine, but dang if I could remember them later. The love story was moving, the sidekicks hysterical, and the setting in San Diego -- airhead/moronic anchorman capital of the world -- is sheer genius. Perhaps we should be sending \\"Anchorman\\" instead of Bibles around the globe to bring the finest of our culture to benighted heathens everywhere.  <br />Watch it and spit up.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|I had never heard of Nightwish Until I saw the video for \\"I Wish I Had An Angel.\\" I feel in love right away I have never been a big fan of metal music but this takes it to another level. Nightwish combines almost like opera with metal no one could have done a better job.
B00005JNDZ|2.0|There's really only one reason to see this movie: a recap of the great girly-man fight between Hugh Grant and Colin Firth. It's almost as funny as the first time around, with some great hair-pulling, body-slamming interludes. The rest of the movie left my mind almost at the same time I watching it, except some painful memories of cheesy looking sets and politically correct third-world prisons. Any movie set in Thailand with no filth and squalor goes way beyond comedy to a kind of propagandistic obscenity. Don't be fooled, tourists of the world, \\"Edge of Reason\\" is to the real Thailand what Woody Allen films are to the real New York.
B0001UL7RY|4.0|You know...Avril Lavigne just has her way with me :). Something I'll admit in the ever-evolving pop stars of our time.  <br /> <br />It seems that a lot of the music that comes out is just overhyped by a bunch of songwriters with creative instincts and then find random people to make the part. Not Avril. <br /> <br />Her music is genuine; written entirely by hand, and honestly? I LOVE IT! When her album \\"Let Go\\" came through, I just remember all the hype about her in her songs \\"Complicated,\\" \\"Sk8er Boi,\\" \\"I'm With You,\\" etc. <br /> <br />But enough on history. This CD, though not as good as its predecessor in my opinion (hence the 4 stars), shows Avril's obvious talents in songwriting yet again. Though I can't say she has the best voice in the world, she has talent and shows it in this album. <br /> <br />Again, the only reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is that \\"Let Go\\" was such a unique genre of music at the time. It literally drew me to it, especially since most of its music was just so fresh and new. I guess you can't get new things everytime, right? *sigh* <br /> <br />Rock it, Avril! ;)
0804115613|5.0|I regret not having read this book earlier. Fannie Flagg's exquisite combination of comedy, tragedy, and even horror into a single book is absolutely great. This book has so many events going on, as it moves back and forth in two different time frames. However, this adds on to be a positive aspect, since there isn't a single moment the book is boring.  <br /> The first time frame, from about 1920 to 1950s is about two woman: Idgie and Ruth. Unlike what most women of their age experience, they feel a different kind of love toward each other. Yes, they can be simply depicted as lesbians; however, they deserve something better than that. Their pure love makes me realize that there is no condition in which two people are allowed to fall in love with. The two are secretly engaged in a relationship, which society usually refuses to accept. Other people might point at their love with contempt, however, it was the most beautiful love story I have ever read. Idgie and Ruth's love never changes. From the moment they first met to years after Ruth died, Idgie holds the same emotion throughout the novel. One thing that represents their constant love is honey. In the beginning of the book, Idgie give honey to Ruth, while convincing her not to leave Whistle Stop. At the end of the book, honey reappears. This time, Idgie collects honey to remember Ruth and their pleasant memories.  <br /> In another time frame, Mrs. Threadgoode tells her new friend Evelyn about her life at Whistle Stop many years ago. Idgie and Ruth are the center of the stories she tells Evelyn. It is funny to see how friendship is constructed, while they talk about other people's friendship. Mrs. Threadgoode is the person who brings about change to Evelyn Couch. From a timid, unobtrusive woman, Evelyn turns into a superwoman who knows how to stand up for herself. I love the incident, when Evelyn crashes into a car seven times, because the car owner took away her parking space.  <br /> The part when Railroad Billis revealed is my favorite story in the book. It is very touching and unexpected, which makes this book very lovable. I would recommend this book to people who do not know what love is. It is because this book illustrates the perfect examples of love. However, I would like to warn them beforehand that not all love between friends in the real world can be as beautiful and exquisite as those between Idgie and Ruth, and Ninny and Evelyn.  <br />
0440224764|4.0|book was really really fun to read, interesting , deep, very nice and ingenius plot, but the ending killed it.  it would've had a nie ending, yet grisham chose to give the ending a surprising but out of place twist.  basically everything was good except for the last 2 pages of the ending.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Why the title? Because had any other band released this album, it would have been lauded as complete genious, a breakthrough in popular music. But instead, Radiohead released it, and as such it draws comparison to the titans OK Computer, Kid A, and even to an extent, The Bends and Amnesiac. Is Hail to the Thief as good as these albums? In some ways, yes. In other ways, no. I will go in to as much detail as I can comfortably muster...<br /><br />First, a major complaint is the album's cohesiveness. Or more like its lack thereof. It is true that the album stalls and restarts in spots. For instance, while \\"2+2=5\\" is like a punch to the face from one fist and \\"Sit Down. Stand Up\\" a follow up from the other hand, leaving you dazed and half-conscious during the beautiful, astral scenery of \\"Sail to the Moon\\", \\"Backdrifts\\" sort of stutters. \\"Backdrifts\\" itself is a pretty good song, and fits just fine after \\"Sail to the Moon.\\" However, it doesn't seem to provide an adequete enough bridge between the first portion of the record and \\"Go to Sleep.\\" In fact, the problem here may not be \\"Backdrifts,\\" but \\"Go to Sleep.\\" It just doesn't fit on the album that well. I love the song but it divides the record up.<br /><br />\\"Where I End and You Begin\\" and \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" pick up the album again after \\"Go to Sleep\\" drops it, indulging in creepy lyricism and emotionally-over-the-top music. \\"The Gloaming\\" is conceptually a high point of the album but musically a weak point. Still, it serves the album just fine where it is, and even manages to segway into \\"There There\\" effectively. There's a sort of \\"gloaming\\" in the album, everything before this track being the dusk and everything after it the night. This fits with the oftentimes political preoccupation of the album fairly nicely.<br /><br />\\"I Will\\" is a beautiful song, but the start of a scattered, unorganized part of the album. My biggest problems with the consistancy of this album mostly take place in this part. \\"Punchup at a Wedding\\" is a groovey, but under-written, song that fits poorly among the other songs. Perhaps if they had given it more time to age, it would have turned out a little better. Not a bad song by any means, but a low point in the album. \\"Myxomatosis\\" is a fantastic, adrenaline-driven thrill ride on the wave of surging distorted bass synth and Phil's mind-boggling swung drum beat. As good as this song is, it still doesn't feel as though it contributes to the flow of the album as much as it should.<br /><br />\\"Scatterbrain\\" brings the album back on track, with a crooning melody and guitars that hint back to the beginning of the record. It then flows seemlessly into \\"Wolf at the Door\\" which is one of my personal favorites on the album and a brilliant, unique album closer.<br /><br />The other common complaint is the \\"straightforward,\\" more live-production style. Radiohead fans have grown accustomed to studio-trickery and songs that are almost identical to their live versions (both in instrumentation and just general sound) was an alien idea to many. While I miss the spaced out, rich production of OK Computer, I have come to appreciate Hail to the Thief as a different album and a different bag of tricks altogether.<br /><br />While initially I was disappointed in some ways, I have grown to love this album. It contains many of my favorite individual Radiohead songs (2+2=5, Sail to the Moon, Where I End and You Begin, We Suck Young Blood, There There, Wolf at the Door.) It may not work as a full album quite as well as Kid A or OK Computer, but once you stop expecting Radiohead to keep topping themselves, you may realize that Hail to the Thief is a fantastic album. It's a \\"low point\\" in Radiohead's discography because it's not genre-redefining, but in the greater scheme of popular music, it is flat out amazing. Its diversity, while breaking up the flow of the album, is also part of what makes the album so charming.<br /><br />Overall, as a Radiohead album it gets four stars.But held up against the rest of the music world, it gets a five, easily.ts a five, easily.

B0007WV9WY|5.0|To begin with, \\"Under My Skin\\" is very good without the DVD, but the DVD improves it a lot! It includes some never-before-seen footage that you can get only with the DVD, and the bonus tracks in the CD are good, but I just have one complain about it: the replacement of \\"Nobody's Home\\". Instead of the regular version, there's a weird mix, that is not bad, but it's not the same, and also, the live version of \\"Tomorrow\\"... What is \\"Tomorrow\\" doing in Under My Skin??? I don't know...<br /><br />The DVD the album includes is very good, and the interviews and the \\"Under My Skin\\" documentary is very good, and you never get sick of it, like the documentary of the DVD \\"My World\\"
0446310786|5.0|Surprisingly, the novel To Kill a Mockingbird only took one week for me to finish reading the whole book. In fact, it usually takes about one week to finish one book for me. This novel contains humorous and serious aspects that made me not want to put it down. The strongest point of this novel is the distinct characters that are in it and the way it is written.    My favorite character, Atticus, the father of Jem and Scout, is a very attractive character in that he is not biased, intelligent, and open-minded. Unlike other characters in this novel, he is the only Caucasian who tried to prove Tom Robinson's innocence. In the section where he cares and worries about his children, I was truly impressed by him. Atticus reminds me of my warm-hearted father. My father never admonishes me but gently explains what I did wrong. He is like Atticus. In my eyes, Atticus is the ideal father figure. I also liked the other major characters in the novel, especially Jem and Scout.  Other characters such as Boo Radley, Calpurnia, Dubose, Dill and Cunningham also make this novel outstanding  The way this story is explained and expanded throughout from Scout's point-of-view makes this novel more special. From a pure and nave perspective, Scout sees the world and interprets it in her own way. I think this is a good aspect of this novel.   It is not a surprise that this novel won the Pulitzer Prize in 1961. I strongly recommend this novel to everybody, because it's easy to understand, humorous and teaches a lesson that relates to everybody. I can guarantee that after you read this novel, you definitely can feel your heart getting warmer.
0345350499|3.0|Does anyone else who read this that was Christian find it offensive? I mean, I read it for the story, but some parts of it seemed a bit unfair. They complained about how my God was so narrow, and they are open, but then they go on to constantly complain and say the same things they saw we do wrong. Its kind of hypocritical, and seems to be biast. It also says Christianity is simple, but its quite complicated what with the Eucharist. And they mention no history of their own religion. And if these people truly believe that all gods are one, aren't they insulting Christ and my God? So in otherwords the story of the book is great, but if this is truly more about Christianity vs. Paganism, then i must say she didn't do a very good job.
B00006D295|5.0|The Rocky Horror Picture Show is an outrageously funny and campy mix of musical/sci-fi/horror/comedy/B-movies. It's not supposed to be taken seriously like those straight Hollywood movies. It's a movie for the audiences to sing along and dance along, and put on some makeup and a wig if you dare,'cause Tim Curry is just a Sweet Transvestite! Susan Sarandon and Barry Bostwick had no idea what nightmare or crazy party they were about to experince when they entered Dr. Frankfurter's mansion, played brilliantly Tim Curry. This film is fabulously entertaining, and it's the perfect party movie, not neccessarily just appropiate for Halloween.
B00004D3C1|5.0|I just bought this cd last year.  I'd heard the name Fu Manchu before but I never really thought about buying any of their cds.  Flash forward to now, and I really hate myself for waiting so long to buy this cd (and most of their other one's for that matter).  A brief synopsis of what the fu is, simply put, down tuned guitars and solos abroad.  Scott Hill's vocals aren't anything very special (I'm not completely certain he can sing), but they're a perfect compliment to the deep, drudgy sounding guitars.  His voice definitely grows on you.  Some say that these guys are a black Sabbath rip off.  I really don't see how someone can draw that conclusion, as the only thing they really have in common is the guitar down tuning.  This album is easily the Fu's best effort (simply because of the power of the songs on this one), clicking on all cylinders right from the get go.  Favorites: hell on wheels, king of the road, over the edge, grasschopper, weird beard.
6305537321|4.0|Breakfast At Tiffany's is more memorable than other Audrey Hepurn films including My Fair Lady and Roman Holiday. Even though her character is not likeable to a lot of people in the film as well as the audiences, I do find her eccentricity fascinnating and grew sympathetic towards her by the end. Especially being a cat lover myself, to see her abandoning Cat and then ranning in the rain to find it again was such a touching scene.<br /><br />Holly Golightly(Hepburn) is a former farm girl living in New York city, and she's a callgirl/golddigger in search of a millionaire husband. She has breakfast(junkfood) outside of Tiffany's and she thinks she would one day have the money to buy those jeweleries. Enter a struggling writer named Paul Varjark(George Peppard), her neighbor who is a \\"rentboy\\" sponsored by a wealthy woman named Patricia Neal. At first, Holly has no desire to get involved with Paul knowing that he has no money, but gradually she realized that they were two of a kind. He relentlessly pursured her, but she rejected him for the possibility of becoming a wealthy wife of a Brazilian millionaire. Will Holly end up with wealth or love?<br /><br />Audrey Hupburn is very beautiful and glamorous, and her black boat-neck dress with pearl necklaces and updo hairstyle is a total classic look. George Peppard is very charming and wonderful in this film. The upstairs' Japanese neighbor with a vulgar attitude portrayed by a White actor is really annoying. Did they not have any Japanese actors to work in a Hollywood movie in the '60s? I loved the score, especially Moon River heard at the end of the movie, it's the perfect ballad that captured the romantic and sad mood. Of Course, Cat also stole some scenes in this movie. It's funny that Holly just called him Cat.
B000002JR8|5.0|I'm a huge fan of pantera, and this is by FAR their best record (once again, not saying that their others are bad in any sense of the word, this is just THAT damn good).  The songs flow spectacularly, and bring out the best (lyrically) in Phil Anselmo.  Dimebag Darrell's guitar was one of the best in metal, and the same could be said by his blood on the drums, Vinnie Paul.  Rex brown's awesome bass play rounds out easily one of the best metal bands EVER, and the strength and work of this band is evident on this record.  Favorites: good friends and a bottle of pills, I'm broken, becoming, hard lines and sunken cheeks, shedding skin, planet caravan.
B0007Y08PQ|5.0|Dear M. IMRAN \\"aka imranbecks,\\" <br /> <br />The last Star Trek Movie \\"First Contact\\" was not release in DTS 5.1 on the theaters.  Just like every other DVD that claims to be in DTS does not have the true DTS sound to them because they were not film with DTS sound, with a few exceptions of course. <br /> <br />The listing on Amazon.com only states Dolby while the last two Star Trek Movies states DTS 5.1.  \\"Star Trek Insurrection\\" was film in true DTS Surround Sound and I am just hoping that it is release this way.  That Amazon made a mistake but they probably didn't. <br /> <br />Please check this out and confirm if there is a DTS version of this movie. <br /> <br />When it comes to the movie I put it on the top with the few other movies that avoided the Star Wars style.  Star Trek is a science fiction dealing with idea and subjects to think about not to have the old one on one battle routine.  I know they fought back against the robots but that is not the same as killing other people and making it look as if this is the only answer to the problem.  War is sick and I am sick of war movies.  Please, they have now killed Star Trek because they turn \\"Enterprise\\" TV Series into a war story one episode after another and the last so called Star Trek Movie. <br /> <br />Star Trek has died because the people behind it could not see the beauty behind the previous Star Treks.  So, in my opinion \\"Insurrection\\" was the last Star Trek of any kind and is the reminder of the original concept of Star Trek. <br />
B00007ELEL|5.0|This is easily one of my favorite movies of all time. I've seen it several times, and it never failed to issue forth side splitting bursts of laughter from me. All of the characters are absolutely superbly acted, and the dialogue is simply hilarious. My favorite character is probably Walter, played by Jeff Goodman, who plays the most convincing derranged vietnam vet I've ever seen. The movie has become a classic in my family, and I have learned to abide by the truly transcendental quotes that arrise in the movie: \\"smokey, your entering a world of pain!\\".
B0002KVUKM|2.0|Steven Sommers got it right when he re-made The Mummy even though it wasn't that good, but it was still entertaining.  The Mummy Returns was only crap in my opinion because of the terrible CG effects, other than that it was pretty consistent in quality.  Van Helsing somehow tries to combine The Wolfman, Dracula, and Frankenstein into one movie called Van Helsing.  Though, Van Helsing is not the same character from Dracula and really has nothing to do with anything.  The mythologies of these three worlds are completely wasted for some crappy \\"comedic\\" lines and some overblown special effects.  The movie runs about 2 hours and 12 minutes and could've been edited to the pace that it was meant for.  Heck, it might have even been a good movie if it wasn't so long.  This film just reminds me of the 1979 Universal Dracula remake, which was crap as well and that's because it tried too hard to be great like it's predecessors, and with the classic Universal horrors you can't do that.  That's why The Mummy was good.  So, I say unless you like modern movies and their special effects circuses you might like this, but if you're a fan of respectable movies you'll recognize it as trash.
0679746048|4.0|In Girl Interrupted , I learned a lot about the real story , not the Hollywood Glamour Movie story .  <br />Allthough this book is insightful , at times I found myself flipping back and forth between chapters to follow the story . For example in one chapter Daisy dies , but several chapters later she is in the story again having a conversation with another person . After awhile , it all falls into place . <br />The book contains real parts of Kaysen's mental records which are really interesting to read .  <br />A caution to those who are offended easily , this may not be the book for you as there is STRONG language as well as sexual content that may not be suitible for younger children or if you cannot handle that sort of detail .
B000059H99|5.0|What can I say about one of the greatest movies ever made that no one else has said?  Well, I can say that if you haven't seen it you need to, no matter what type of movies you are into.  The story and characters will pull you right in and you'll be addicted to the film.  Of course, Sylvester Stallone definately gets my pick as best actor in this film as he plays Rocky, the innocent and lovable underdog boxer who is challenged by the world heavyweight champion.  This movie has some of the greatest moments and lines that should stay in everyone's heart and mine until they die.  There's only one thing I can't condone about this DVD:  The special features.  There really isn't anything except the director showing some 8MM footage of fight rehearsals.  What do real fans want?  I would want to see a documentary of each film on each seperate movie disk, but for some reason MGM is reluctant, and they just when through the whole ordeal of having to re-sell a crapload of their titles.  In the end we buy DVD's for the film, so I guess the film makes everything ok.  Rocky should never, and will never be forgotton as one of the greatest achievments in film history.
B00080ZG10|5.0|i finally saw this wondrous film last night in a $1.50 all seats theatre-it was packed to the rafters, and oh so deservingly so! this is scorcese at his film making best-some flaws included, but immediately forgiven, tho. the film is spectacular in every detail, and from start to shocking finish! and oh the acting how superb everyone was! from leonardo dicaprio, to the marvelous cate blanchett as the late great kate hepburn, to kate beckinsdale as ava gardner, etc. the list just goes on and on! there was even applause at the films climax-when was the last time any one of us has experienced that??! in spite if it's running length, the film moved as if it were 90 minutes long. the great screenplay, the awesome cinematography, the musical score, all blended together to make seeing 'the aviator' an unforgettable film experince! what a weirdo hughes became towards the climax of his life. it is not to be missed, and i just pre ordered my 2 disc dvd set for next tuesday release! it's such a brilliant and haunting film, it will be easy to view over and over! i, for one, cannot wait to see it again on my home theatre experience-i am sure all of you will feel the same! bravos to scorcese and kudos to some of the best acting ever.
B0001O3YC6|4.0|Ok, so Twohy has made a sort of Alien/Aliens ripoff, but cast that out of your mind as you start watching this movie and your experience will be alot better.  The whole visual style is excellent until we get to the \\"pitch black\\" section of the film, than it starts to look a little more like the same old sci-fi/horror stuff.  I belive in one sense the movie is just to show off how cool the character, Riddick, can be played by Vin Diesel, but on the other hand it is a good sci-fi movie on its own.  One thing that's a little unfortunate is the fact that we are left with so little characters in such a short time (Resident Evil, AvP).  We dont' really get to know anyone except the 4 or 5 main characters, too bad.  Although yes, it can be somewhat derivative and plot stealing in a sense, it must be watched in conjunction with the short, Dark Fury, and Chronicles.  I do recommend it to any sci-fi/horror or Vin Diesel fans, you won't be let down, I think.

B00000255F|5.0|This album is so good that the only bad review of it didn't even mention the music - it just blasted Springsteen for his politics. There is not a weak song on this album - every song is great. This CD is a must-have not only for Springsteen fans but for anyone who likes music.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|There are occasions when a rating systems just isn't enough.  On the scale of 1 through 5 stars, I'd give it a \\"10\\".   <br /> <br />Not only is this a highly enjoyable watch, it is intelligently written & performed by a group of actors that seem purposely born to do this show! <br /> <br />To say Lauren Graham is superb as Lorelai, is a gross understatement!  She, along with Alexis Bledel (Rory), Scott Patterson (Luke Danes),to mention but a few, bring back memmories of the classic style of Gary Grant and Rosiland Russell in 'His Girl Friday' - no small feat. <br /> <br />Kudoes to the writters, actors, and supporting cast members for a highly paced, witty, and enjoyable comedy-drama. <br /> <br />If you have only one series to buy this year, please do yourselves a favor and catch-up on the best show on T.V., in a very long time.  Buy all three seasons! <br /> <br />I'm set and waiting for the fourth season to be released! <br /> <br /> <br />Carolyn R. Koller <br />Columbia, PA

0440213525|4.0|A boring book <br />The story was great in my eyes. The ending was kind of boring. I enjoyed Mark when he was scared. Some of the things were just not important. Over all the book was good. The people in the story were very well described.  <br /> I like the way the writer pick things in the story to make the story more fun and exciting. I hope all of books are like that. The details are very good. I enjoyed the plot of the story. Something's I did not like fore example the MOB they were not really introduced.  <br /> The book need more action. I was rally not blown away by the story. I have all ready seen a lot of this kind of stuff. If I had to give this book a rating I wood give it a 8 out of 10. I mostly know what was going to happen. It needed some sort of bad guy.  <br />
B0000039PW|5.0|I wish I could give Ready to Die 10 stars. If you do not own this album, and consider yourself a hip hop fan, you need to buy it. Now. There's just no other way to say it: this is the best hip hop album ever put out. Biggie is the greatest rapper to ever grip a mic. These people in here saying he's trash and that Pac was better are fools. I love 2Pac, he is easily my 2nd fav rapper of all time, but he doesnt touch BIG. Nothing Pac put out even comes close to Ready to Die. Nothing any rapper has ever put out comes close to Ready to Die. Don't waste your money on trash like The Massacre, buy Ready to Die. You will not regret it.

B0007NFL18|1.0|Don't waste your time on this crappy album. \\"The Massacre\\" is selling units simply because of the huge hype machine that is the biggest sellout in the history of rap: 50 Cent. <br /> <br />Get Rich or Die Tryin' was a really good album and 50 is a decent rapper. My problem with him is that he is such a shameless sellout who cares only about making money, not about making great music.  <br /> <br />This album is very weak, but like Ludacris, Fat Joe, Nelly and all the other sellouts who are contaminating rap these days, 50 knows he does not have to make great music to have great record sales. Do yourself a favor and save your money for Ready to Die, Life After Death, or one of Pac's albums. The Massacre is trash.
0684800713|3.0|Reading one of Hemmingway's first acclaimed novels, I felt the Sun Also Rises truly transported me to a different time and place.  The simple narration was colourful and great, and the descriptions of the American and English friends frolicking through the cafes and restaurants left me stunk of wine, and merriment.  Reading this book made my drunk just by all the booze they were consuming.    Nevertheless, I didn't feel this novel take off until they arrived in Spain.  Brett is a character that is for sure, but everyone else seems relegated to supporting parts.  I kind of was hoping the story would tell a litte bit more about them.    I did enjoy the book but only in places, and I also feel that the book seems a bit dated.  But it's a good read no doubt. Yes I liked it.
0440211727|5.0|A Time to Kill definitely contains all the elements a great book should have: a firm, ongoing plot; stylish main characters with more minor, yet characteristic, characters; just the right amount of imagery - not too much, not too little; a perfect amount of dialogue that keeps your mind from wandering; danger, crime, love, and determination all in a single bundle of pages. <br /> <br />Tonya Hailey, a 10-year-old black girl, is raped by two white men. As the trial for these two rapists begin, Carl Hailey (the father of Tonya) decides to take the matter in his own hands. After acquiring an illegal M-16 rifle from a fellow Vietnam War veteran, Carl kills both men and accidentally injures another white police officer. Now the situation is awkward enough to make you catch your breath. A black man has killed not just one, but two white men - intentionally...for it is obvious that his murder was premeditated. This is where the hero of the day - young defense attorney Jake Brigance - enters the scene. Very reliable, very ambitious, and totally backed up with support from Lucien Wilbanks (former boss) and Ellen Roark (new law clerk), Jake is one of those guys that you can describe as: \\"if he can't do it, no one can.\\"  <br /> <br />As I pause in the middle of this summary, I would like to take this time to mention how fascinating the theme already is. Imagine a father's wrathful vengeance upon two young white men who didn't know what they were getting themselves into. Now imagine a black father's wrath upon two white men. And now imagine a white defense attorney trying to defend a pre-planned murder of a black man against two white men...with the argument of \\"insanity.\\" Because that is indeed what Jake Brigance does. He sets up an insanity plea, saying that Carl Hailey did not know what he was doing at the time of the murder.  <br /> <br />As the trial date approaches, the story turns drastic and racially-violent. The Klu Klux Klan and black protestors meet head on, each group inflicting deliberate and accidental violence on the county. My personal opinion tells me that the Klu Klux Klan (KKK) was more of a terror than the black protestors; after all, all the black protestors did was to scream \\"Free Carl Hailey\\" and fight the KKK members. The KKK, on the other hand, terrorizes individual members of the court, including the potential jury members, Jake, Ellen, and Jake's secretary Ethel. This outside conflict, resulting in numerous injuries and a few deaths, tells the reader that the plot has taken a sharp turn towards a more violent and more racially-involved storyline. <br /> <br />In the end, the all-white, ten-female, 2-male [they say that white females are the least sympathetic towards blacks] jury votes Carl Hailey as not guilty due to insanity. This expected, yet unexpected-at-the-same-time, verdict is a pleasant surprise to readers and gives a nice, calm ending to a rather volatile plot. In conclusion, as a book-lover myself, I recommend this book to anyone who wants to have a sophisticated adventure with many twists and turns - all in one sitting. John Grisham definitely doesn't disappoint in his first and best novel. <br />
B000003TA4|5.0|Basically in a nutshell, an album like this only comes out once in a long while.  It breaks down barriers, defines a generation, starts a movement, and then speaks forever.    Cobain and company did something miraculous which all defining albums do, take either Sgt Pepper, Led Zepplin IV, Never Mind the Bollocks, they tapped into some type of current consciousness that everyone knew of but someone had to say first.  They nailed it, and an explosion happened.  A MUCH NEEDED explosion.    I heard the music from this album shortly after it was released on the alternative video program on MuchMusic in Canada.  The band wasn't exactly on everyones lips yet then.  After hearing it, I knew this band was on to something, and they were going to be HUGE.  I mean MEGA-HUGE.  Even after listening to countless bands, when I heard Smells Like Teen Spirit, I litteraly RAN to the music store to get the album. There was ONE... ONE left copy of this album on the shelves (it was a tape all the CD's were gone) when I got there.  That's how succesful the band was.    After hearing it, music was never going to be the same again.  For the guy who started and officialy ended a musical miracle I say thanks.    And if you haven't heard this album, I envy you for getting to hear it for the first time.

B0007TKNII|4.0|this movie is such a visually gorgeous film. the sets and the colors are so vivid and bright. everything in the film keeps the action going. the music is tredendous, the story is well-known by all. i have to admit this film does drag at times (probably because i'm not much into musicals) but this film is amazing nonetheless. the gothic-romance horror of \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" serves to populate the ages, being remade better and better each time. i have to admit, it was an odd version of \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" song being played, i mean, it sounded all sythentsized and electronic compared with the rest of the music in the film. i think if they did it the original way it was, minus the synthesized drums and electric guitar, it would have added a more dark and grim appeal. not that this version is bad, it's just weird. Emmy Rossum...yummy, but also an elegant christine vocally. the phantom is awesome too.
6305696071|3.0|One cannot watch PRETTY WOMAN without having a little fun at its expense.  Some have described this film as a modern day \\"Cinderella\\" story.  I describe it as another remake of MY FAIR LADY.  What is the difference?  Well, in PRETTY WOMAN our protagonist is a hooker.  Hence, the problem.  But I would like to cast my vote somewhere in the middle of these two extremes.  On the one hand, we can certainly understand the film's detractors.  While it is not fair to say that prostitution is glamorized in this film, it is conveniently hidden behind the razzle-dazzle of Julia Roberts's new life.  Naturally, in the real world this sort of thing would never happen.  Additionally, I too was somewhat appalled at the way money is used to improve the self-confidence of Roberts's character.<br /><br />But PRETTY WOMAN is not entirely molded by these awkward premises and values.  For one, money is not completely glorified in this film, as Richard Gere seems to be having a crisis amid his endless pursuit of it.  Something is missing from his life and his unethical business practices are no longer fulfilling.  What he needs is a change: what he needs is, apparently, a hooker.  Seriously, however, PRETTY WOMAN only succeeds if you forget about the fact that Roberts is a streetwalker.  Remember, she is a smart girl and does not seem to fit into the hooker lifestyle.  Thus, we are supposed to treat her as a character who doesn't know what she is doing and ends up on the street as an accident of fate and low-confidence.  So should we be pissed off that a rich businessman saves her like a knight in shining armor?  I don't think so.  For let us not forget that both of our characters need saving, a point that the film makes quite clear, even in awkward dialogue.<br /><br />In the end, I believe that the acting in this film is very good (particularly amongst the supporting cast), but that the awkward storyline and premise prevent the film from becoming a truly successful love story.  Watch it for its entertainment value and humor: there is plenty.  Just don't watch it expecting a great tale of fated lovers.ertainment value and humor: there is plenty.  Just don't watch it expecting a great tale of fated lovers.
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Most negative reviews of this movie fit the following two categories: <br /> <br />1.  The language was vulgar <br />2.  The people are not likeable <br /> <br />Some movies depict Fantasy Land, where people are good, the endings are happy, and dancing munchkins pass out lolipops.  If you are looking for such a film, the Wizard of Oz is always an option. <br /> <br />Guess what? In the real world people swear.  People manipulate each other.  And the cowboy does not ride off into the sunset.  He gets shot in the back by the woman he burned.
B0000639FE|4.0|JERRY MAGUIRE is one of those films that I enjoy, even though I know I shouldn't.  Why not, you ask?  Well, it has a bit of a hopelessly optimistic viewpoint, it wormed its way into our vocabulary, and, overall, it's a bit too sugary.  But for some reason I continue to be affected by it whenever I watch it.  It is the believable story of a man who wakes up during the course of his life, has a revelation, and then refuses to accept the consequences of that revelation until the end of the film.  I love the fact that Tom Cruise fails to change overnight, that he is more complex than that.  And while I'm on the subject, I normally don't hand out a lot of praise to Tom Cruise, but this is another excellent performance of late.  Having just seen COLLATERAL, I am beginning to wonder why he has always been overlooked as nothing more than a heartthrob.  His performance in JERRY MAGUIRE is quite moving and he was perfectly cast.<br /><br />Ultimately, I like JERRY MAGUIRE because its main character stumbles throughout the entire course of the film.  Just when you think the sugar-coated lenses are about to come down on the film (and it happens a lot), Cameron Crowe throws a wrench in the gears and things come crashing back down around Cruise's character.  Like many of Crowe's films, it is a film that dabbles in several genres (romantic love-story, comedy, drama) and ends up something quite different, but altogether entertaining.  I highly recommend it.
1573301051|3.0|Not bad, although lets see, you have 3 \\"divas\\" trying to outscream and steal the show from each other, which becomes embarrassingly more evident as the show goes on. Riiiiight. <br />The real star of this show was Shania Twain. She actually writes her own material, concentrates on singing with heart instead of screaming and she can play guitar while performing....plus she doesn't have an ego like the rest of the performers and didn't try to upstage anyone *cough*Celine*cough* although as far as talent and attitude is concerned, Shania clearly outshined the rest.
B000002V07|5.0|Right up there with The Cure's Disintegration and Beck's Mutations.
B000002G7E|5.0|Writing for Rolling Stone about The Velvet Underground, Julian Casablancas, the ineloquent lead singer of The Strokes called White Light/ White Heat a \\"real f***-the-world album.\\"  I don't know if I could possibly disagree with him more.  White Light/ White Heat is one of the most experimental mainstream releases ever, it's brazenly atonal, and in its attempt, is subversively entertaining and influential.  What it's not is angry, not in the traditional sense.  Instead, it's a knowing, even joyful mockery of bourgeoisie morality - a morality that includes certain tropes of musicianship.  So the title song that opens the record feels the \\"white light goin', messin' up my mind,\\" and the result is a sort of ingestion and through-the-looking-glass capitulation of what culture really is.  The centerpiece, strangely, is \\"The Gift,\\" an 8 minute spoken tale of a bland, spoiled couple (Waldo!  And Marsha!) that turns into a tail of accidental murder - a track that's so transfixing and barbed, it's hard to figure out whether it's a triumph of music or storytelling.  The rest of the record is the epitome of the Velvets prickly difficulty, like the tune of \\"Lady Godiva's Operation\\" overtaken by outside voices, or the 17-minute opus \\"Sister Ray\\" - they're testaments to the brave specificity of the bands noisy compositions, presenting a countercultural assault on the coming faux-peppiness of the early 70's.  Doing so wasn't f***ing the world at all, it was saving it, with a toothsome grin.
B0002OERI0|5.0|First of all, I've been listening to Green Day since the time before Dookie and didn't like the last couple of albums...<br /><br />American Idiot is one of the worst songs on this album and it's a pretty good song. If you're basing your decision on whether or not to buy this album based on that song, you're making a big mistake.<br /><br />Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, and Boulevard of Broken Dreams are all completely different songs and take a different approach from their previous albums. Is this album less \\"punk\\" than their older stuff? Yes, it is. But, if you want to hear songs like Dookie, listen to Dookie. Get upset with a band when they take a step backward, not when they take a huge step forward and put out an album like this.<br /><br />Call it maturing, artistic growth, whatever else you want to call it. This band has changed and it's a change for the better. I was a little hesitant to buy it but it was on sale so I picked it up 6 days ago with some other albums. I decided to listen to it first and I haven't listened to anything else since then. I haven't even listened to the other stuff I bought last week. This album is that good and everyone I know that has listened to it agrees with me.<br /><br />_________________________________________<br /><br />I wrote what the last guy said because it is nigh flawless :)
0393314804|5.0|I loved this book.  It was gruesome and sick at times.  The Scottish dialect made the characters come to life when I read the book.  My favourite story was the second - eew!  Not for the light hearted!
B0007GAERG|5.0|For it to be a true comeback ablum, one would have to go back to what they used to do.  While Mariah doesn't quite reach the Early to Mid 90's she goes back as far as she could.  I would have to say that this cd rival's Music Box & Day Dream as Mariah's best cd.  Her voice is stronger than it has been in years and she stick to a formula that works: Singing and Writing good lyrics.      Mariah proves again that's she's the best at what she does.  The Tracks Joy ride and Circles showcases her vocal range.  We Blong together is the classic uptemp ballad, that hooks you both lyically and vocally.     Mariah then please her urban-style fans with the track Say Something, Get Your Number, & To the Floor.  These rapper collabos aren't your typical just throw a rapper in the middle of the song.  They are arranged pretty good.     Mariah then moves on to please the OLD-SCHOOL fans; The tacks Stay the Night, takes you back to the Jackson 5 and Mine Again, has a 70's night club feel to it.    As of recent albums Mariah has been adding Gospel like tracks on the cd, and Mimi is no expection. Fly Like A Bird is a beatiful track that encompasses everything that is MARIAH;vocals, lyrics, music.    While not the perfect album, it puts Mariah back on track.  There is one filler track on the album(To the Floor) IMO, but it should have been replaced with Secert Love( a track thats found on the Japanesse Version of this album). I would recommend this album, without hesitation.
B000092ZYX|2.0|Insipid.  There There is excellent, and Sit Down Stand Up is pretty good, but the rest of the album is slow, boring, pretentious treacle. I don't know why I wasted my money on it...maybe because I liked the video for There There. But honestly, this stuff just doesn't do anything for me. It isn't remarkable in the slighest. The point of music is to affect the listener emotionally; Hail to the Thief just doesn't do it. Music is supposed to be interesting! *Sigh* Need I go on?   I much preferred Kid A...at least the melodies could really strike a nerve  And by the way, I'm quite positive that most of the people who respond negatively to this review are avid Radiohead fans who have listened to Hail to the Thief a thousand times and already love it to death. Don't be bitter.  Face it: the album is bland.
B00006879E|5.0|I've read over the reviews on this album and most are accurate.  But as we all know, there are some who come from other record companies whose sole purpose is to throw salt on other artists' reviews and there are some disgruntled rock fans who were once Kara's Flowers fans (maroon 5's original band name).   <br /> <br />This CD is great for more than a few reasons. I enjoy the hybrid of rock and r&b.  Many rock fans prob would not appreciate that saying that they are a rip off of other bands but then again many people dont particularly care for eminem either in which many would argue is a rip off of some other well known rap artists.  <br /> <br />Some people complain about the content of their CD.  Too much love etc.  It makes me wonder, how many of you ranked a CD high when it contained countless \\"bitch and ho\\" \\"Shoot em up, kill em, bloody murder\\" refrences.  I'm sorry but five years from now, no one will care about those things.  Yet a CD that came out in 2002 is still making a buzz on the charts.  How many other artists who are out now can you say have accomplished this?  Not many.  A CD that some people would say that was bad would not sell 8 million copies world wide or sell out concerts all over the place and is able to cross age and color lines in popularity. Very few have accomplished that. <br /> <br />This CD has some gems on it and frankly some of the best stuff on the CD was never released.
B00005B36H|3.0|I used to love this album. But when I dug it out recently to give it another go, not having listened to it for about three years, I was taken aback. Most of the songs are overly dramatic and cheesy. In some ways the band is trying to resurrect their old sound; Ticks and Leeches, for example, is basically a re-hash of Hooker with a Penis...pandering to fans of AEnima, it seems. And the music videos seem to combine all the elements of their previous offerings...self-plagiarism, anyone? The lyrics, however, add a new metaphysical dimension, making me wonder if Maynard is familiar with Alan Watts. Overall, not a great album, though I must admit that Reflection is pretty goddamn hypnotic, even moving.
0440213525|4.0|This book \\"The Client\\" was a very interesting book and I do recommend this book to any one who wants to read a good book. This book is very interesting because of the investigation going on though out this book. This book makes you want to keep reading on to find out what's going happen next. In this book it makes you think and wonder if the body really is where Romey said it would be found. So this was a very good book and I do recommend it to anyone who enjoys good books.                                                                                                           <br /> <br />In this book there's these boy named Mark and Ricky both of them witnessed a lawyer named Romey commit suicide. After he commits suicide Ricky goes into shock, but before Romey commits suicide he tells Mark where the body of a guy is buried. They had been working on a case looking for the body that one of Romey clients killed. Well right before Romey kills himself he tells Mark where the body can be found. The police and F.B.I. suspect Mark knows where the body is located so their after mark try to get in to tell but Mark refuses to say a word.  <br /> <br />I liked this book because I really liked all the characters that were in this book. Many of these characters were good characters and interesting as well. I like this book because likei said it keeps you guessing until the end and you dont know what to expect. I really like the way the author told the story and he wrote it very well he used good dialoque and told the story very well. <br /> <br /> <br />  <br />
0440213525|3.0|The Client is about a boy named Mark that lies to the police about not knowing anything about an case.  Authorities believe that he and his younger brother Ricky witnessed a very dangerous event.  Mark makes up all types of lies to get out of trouble, but he only digs himself a bigger hole.  Mark also made up these lies to be sure that he doesn't get caught because he, `doesn't want to go to jail'.  The only person that knew the real story was Reggie Love, Mark's lawyer.  The case was taken to court after a questioning got too personal.  The story was mildly intriguing but I would say that most parts were pretty boring but then again, I'm not really a \\"mystery\\" person. John Grisham is an awesome writer and I would definitely recommend this book. <br />
0804115613|5.0|It was one of my favorite books I read recently, and I would love to recommend this book to anyone to read. At first it was quite hard to follow the story, because the story jumped back and forth between past and present. However after reading the entire book, I thought this technique was just one of the unique styles of Fannie Flagg's writing and it was overall very effective. It was better to tell different story each chapter  rather than telling the first story then end, and then move onto the second story. Not only the organization but the use of words Fannie Flagg used were very creative and humorous. Some of the jokes and descriptions made me laugh while I'm reading the book. This book also has a lot of meanings in it. Such as the strong friendship between Idgie and Ruth, and the examples of racial discrimination in the southern part of the United States. I give 5 stars to this book since  it was humorous, meaningful and creative. This book shouldn't be left in your bookshelf anymore. You should take out and start reading it. You'll love it.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|Let's face it. Throughout Megadeth's career, they were always a carbon copy of Metallica.  Although both bands pretty much killed metal in the mid-late 80s, Metallica's last several attemps came out fairly good, while Megadeth's \\"Risk\\" still remains the only album Dave made thats worth your time. While most Megadeth fans yell \\"Sell out\\" to everything after Rust In Piece, I truly think they were sell outs to begin with. <br />Peace Sells has music videos? So did Rust in Peace? <br /> <br />Now on with Risk. Risk isnt your generic thrash metal album with 3 minute long guitar solos or Halford-clonage vocals. Risk incorporates influences from pop, techno, and modern rock. Megadeth makes an album different from their pretty much dull catalog and got bashed for it. How many times do we have to hear Holy War carbon copies? <br /> <br />For those into long, endless guitar solos, look elsewhere. <br /> <br />For those who know what metal is all about, and understand that mixing different styles and experimenting is good, then this album is for you.
6305252572|1.0|I wasn't expecting a sophisticated film by the Cohen brothers or food-for-though from Jarmusch or other heavy weight director. I supposed it was going to be fun, but the film didn't do the trick: slow, violent, sexist and racist. And not even funny. \\"Showtime\\" and \\"Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man\\" are masterpieces compared to it. \\"48 hours\\" made me realize that if the last white guy available on Earth were somebody resembling Nick Nolte, I will surely pick a better human being from any minority. His character shows the poster boy of a sample of the worst pieces of \\"white trash\\" on film. A real LOSER \\"strutting his part upon the stage\\" before reality puts him in halt.
B000062YAZ|1.0|Behind all the spooky satanism , Slayer is nothing but a typical 80s metal band. Not concerned with song structure or emotion. Slayer basically plays power chords as fast as possible and combines them with solos that go nowhere. Is that what people find talented? Playing until your fingers bleed? If so, then Slayer, nor their fans know anything about what metal is really about. After listening to this album, It's no wonder thrash metal didn't even make it past 1991.
B00030590I|5.0|Okay, people...let's get a hold of ourselves.  Many have knocked the martial arts sequences in HERO as being horribly unrealistic and that this fact has ruined the movie.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  True, the martial arts in this film are not the \\"realistic\\" acrobatics of Jackie Chan.  Instead, it is pure visual poetry.  These martial arts sequences are absolutely beautiful to watch.  Anyone that can watch them without coming away with a sense of awe is just plain blind in my book.<br /><br />In fact, that goes for the entire movie.  HERO is one of the most gorgeous films I have seen in a long time.  Not only are the sequences superb, but the scenic locations are also breathtaking.  Moreover, the extensive use of color is astounding.  While watching it, I felt completely transported into a different world and found myself lost in the film's sheer beauty.  Furthermore, the mythical story is extremely complex, interweaving several themes & variations of the central plot.  The audience gradually discovers the truth of this film and it continued to surprise me throughout its length.<br /><br />I am not sure why so many people did not like this film.  I can only guess that they were expecting a pure-action film with Jet Li taking on a country, \\"Rambo\\" style.  I, for one, am happy that we were treated to something more.  HERO has plot, heart, emotion, and style.  And let us not forget the outstanding action it does provide: the action sequences in this film are some of the best ever captured on film.  Highly recommended.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I wrote this review after only listening to this album once.  Now, having heard it through twice, I can write a true review.  With their trippy riffs, overall effect of their lyrics, and amazing singing duets (Serj and Darron), they have become a favorite band of many people.  The major complaints of this album have been the length, which I will admit is way to short for an album this hyped up, and the overuse of Darron.  The overuse of Darron could create a problem if SOAD continues to have him write almost every song and have them all have basicly the same lyrics (party party blah blah).  Now, having put those concerns aside, this album ROCKS!!  Do not be fooled by some of the dumbasses who write on here putting this album down.  Mesmerize is definately a must-own.  The best tracks are B.Y.O.B., Revenga, Cigaro (one of my personal favorites), Radio/Video, Violent Pornography, and Question!  Every track is worth listening to.  This is a great addition to the SOAD family of music.  Don't pass this one over.  ~EtHaN
B000068OSK|1.0|This band blows and so does the album. How can anyone not jump off a building trying to listen to this crap? The most annoying vocals in the world, i swear. I mean, seriously anyone who listens to this junk has to be pretending to like it.
0060763280|1.0|I was deeply disturbed by this book and the guilt based ideas.  It appears to be a very long commercial for upgrading to his next big seminar or class.  It is just like being stuck in his seminar, you can hardly wait to get out.  Very poorly written and too much fluff.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|First of all, these guys are incredible.  I have been waiting so long for this release, and it was clear as soon as I heard \\"Cigaro\\" and \\"B.Y.O.B\\" that SOAD would be back and better than ever.  The creativity and originality of this album is unrivaled.  Mezmerize packs an instantly addicting punch of catchy riffs, vocal harmonies, and crazy screeching.  Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian are two of the greatest collaborative minds in music today.  Hypnotize is going to be amazing and it's coming out this year! <br /> <br />Every track on this cd will absolutely \\"mezmerize\\" SOAD fans and possibly others.  It's a must buy!  Absolutely 5 stars.  One of the best records I've heard in a long time, seeing as Steal This Album! came out like 3 years ago...
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I was more impressed with this album then i expected to be. Its a very solid release. I like the fact that Darron is singing more. he has a really nice voice and him and Serj sound great harmonizing together. This album is a great mix of their punked out metal side and their dark, errie, melody. It meshes well even though the album has a bit of a goofy over tone to it. not in a bad way though<br /><br />1.Solider Slide-3/5: A good intro. chilling infact<br /><br />2.B.Y.O.B.-5/5: I think this is a fun songs. crazy as hell!<br /><br />3.Revenga-5/5: This is a catchy well written song<br /><br />4.Cigaro-1/5: This is the only song that flat out SUCKS! I'm sorry but this sounds like a bad MSI song. Total Filler. This could have been a 5 star album if it weren't for this stupid song.<br /><br />5.Radio/Video-3/5: I love the opening riff! but the song doesn't progress that far. Its not bad but not one of my favorites.<br /><br />6.This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Track-5/5: The best song name on the album! this track is quite intence. Its perhaps the song that best emphsises their Dead Kennedys influence<br /><br />7.Violent Pornography-4/5: This one's quite wacky, and also magnificant<br /><br />8.Question-4/5: This one may be the one that most reminds me of the first album<br /><br />9.Sad Statue-5/5: One of my favorites on the album. If System wasn't so \\"metal\\" they'd probably be held in the same regard as U2.<br /><br />10.Old School Hollywood-3/5: The story behind this song is better then the song it's self. I think it has to do with a celeberty soft ball game that the band participated in with Tony Danza and some other C list celberties. The song ok, but i really like the synth parts.<br /><br />11.Lost In Hollywood-5/5: A great ending song! I can't wait to see where the next album goes from here.<br /><br />A Well rounded album that i wasn't expecting to like at all. only one dud. This album is worthy of all the hype it receives. I can't wait to see how they progress on the second part of this release.
0975991477|5.0|After quickly perusing Dr. Lipton's book, I was impressed with the level of candor and authenticity with which he is able to describe recent advances in developmental biology and the biomedical field. With a wit and humor that is accessible to a wide audience, Lipton deconstructs the dogma of DNA to provide information and knowledge to people on what is occurring on a cellular level. The integration of new chemical and biomedical research is well documented and cited for further reference. Lipton's book demystifies what medical professionals have clinically and professionally known, but fail to explain to patients.     [...] Rather he is shedding light on the value of epigentic research and noting the disparity between epigenetic studies that are funded versus studies that are underwritten by NIH/FDA/and pharmaceutical companies (for more information for the layman on this please read Marcia Angell's book, former editor of the New England Journal of Medicines, \\"The Truth about the Drug Companies...\\"). [...] the science of systems biology is not nascent - rather it is the equivalent of complexity science, a buzzword for a new style of research that permits once atomized lab researchers (such as myself) to harness ideas and form scientific communities - integrative, collaborative, computational, financially-interlinked and cross-disciplinary - and systems theory is also not emergent, being one of the older forms of biological-ecological pardigms.    Yes, Lipton brings in aspects of spirituality but this appears to be a personal commitment and also an attempt to provide a transdisciplinary perspective on why this research is cross-cutting between the sterile and controlled lab environment and to the broader \\"uncontrolled,\\" stochastic environment of our human lives and human nature.
0345350499|4.0|This should be a must-read for every single teenage/college-age girl. It's so nice to read a book where women are powerful and where baby girls are important to a society (so many times we read that far back in history, families always wanted a boy to be heir, etc.) From page one, I couldn't put this book down.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah has finally regained her balance, between satisfying the critics, the fans and mainstream radio!  I know everyone cites \\"Circles\\" \\"Mine Again\\" and \\"Fly Like a Bird\\" (all excellent tracks) as the return of \\"old Mariah,\\" but has anyone heard \\"Joy Ride!?\\"  This is my absolute favorite track on the album -- perhaps top 5 Mariah tracks of all time!  This song sounds as if it could pass as a previously unreleased track from the Daydream album!  Gorgeous! <br />I know many older fans were disappointed with Charmbracelet and Rainbow (including me -- especially Rainbow), but Emancipation showcases a more crafted, sensible selection of songs.  Keep in mind, there are plenty of hip-hop inspired cuts on the disc, but this album makes you believe Mariah when she states she is an \\"R&B\\" artist - Not simply a hip-hop princess. As for the hip-hop tracks, I love \\"Get Your Number,\\" and the old-school R&B track \\"Stay the Night\\" and funkier \\"One and Only.\\"   I've heard a lot of people say they like \\"To the Floor\\" and \\"Say Somethin\\" but I haven't warmed up to these songs yet. <br />Overall, this is one of those discs you can listen to all the way through without reaching for the \\"skip\\" button.  More importantly, Mariah has essentially re-launched her pop music career - and we like that.
B0000026CM|5.0|In this CD, the main Toto triad of Steve Lukather, David Paich, and Jeff Porcaro reach their height of musicical excellence and melodic songwriting.  With big assists from Joseph Williams and Mike Porcaro, this album delivers one excellent track after another, building on the combination of ballads, dancable beats, and west-coast rock sounds Toto had so much success with on Toto IV.  'Anna' is perhaps Steve Lukather's best ballad, while 'Pamela', 'Mushanga' and 'These Chains' deliver classic Toto fare - melodic, well crafted, and memorable.  The song which soars, though, is 'Stop Loving You' which delivers a hook so engaging it is reminiscent of the huge Abba hits of the seventies.  While this effort marked the end of mainstream commercial success for Toto in the U.S. market, it helped launch them internationally in a big way, and deservedly so.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I thought they would have grown up a lil bit by now. The only good songs on this whole CD are BYOB and Sad Statue. Everything else sounds like something Eminem would put out as his first single (\\"Without Me\\", \\"Real Slim Shady\\", \\"Lose It\\", \\"My Name Is\\".) AKA joke songs or they just arent very good. When this band acts serious once in a while they can make some great music. My favorite sh*t from them is \\"Spiders\\", \\"Aerials\\", \\"Toxicity\\", \\"BYOB\\" and \\"Sad Statue\\". Whether it be slow or fast, it should have a meaning. Now I'm all for a few comic relief tracks like Eminem does as I mentioned before, but this is pathetic. So overall this album really dissapointed me, and with a singer thats near 40 years old I thought theyd be past the Mushroom People at this time.
B000056JYC|5.0|frampton comes alive is one of the greatest live albums ever recorded along with free live,live cream and the who live at leeds.hugely recommended.disregard the one star reviews and get this masterpiece.
B0007TKNIS|3.0|The sets were in keeping with the period.  As with any film presentation of a stage play, the viewer is provided with extended details.  If you have seen the stage play with Michael Crawford, you will be very disappointed with this movie.  Emmy Rossum has a very nice voice, but lacks depth.  Gerard Butler as the Phantom was frequently off-key and did not have the voice to carry the role.  I, too, am very glad the stage version is still running.
B000002J09|5.0|led zeppelin's fourth album is an absolute masterpiece.it was one of the greatest heavy metal albums of all time.it contained immortal classics like rock and roll,black dog and stairway to heaven.Jimmy page and Robert plant are two of the greatest  musicians.Led zeppelin are a great band.get all their albums till presence.hugely recommended.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of A Down are back with their first studio album in several years, and it was more than worth the wait. Mezmerize, the first of 2 SOAD albums set for release this year, shows System as crazy as they ever were. The best way I could describe it is a combination of the frantic relentlessness of their self-titled debut and the melody found in Toxicity. With this in mind, realize it is something far different than either of those albums too. Longtime fans can see that they have changed a lot, but they are true artists, and they expand their music in ways they never have while staying true to their style of music. To start off the album is Soldier Side intro, a slow minute-long intro that leads up to BYOB. Surely everybody has hears BYOB by now, with the band asking \\"Why don't presidents fight the war?\\" From this point on the album is nonstop, in your face with great tracks like Revenga, Radio/Video, and Violent Pornography. In fact, there isn't one song I could find that wasn't catchy as hell. The closer on the album, Lost in Hollywood, is a lot calmer than the previous tracks, but ends the album on a high note. That one has single written all over it. <br /> <br />I have never anticipated an album as much as this one, and for me it is everything I hoped for. System of a Down have yet to release anything that was less than stellar or anything short of original in every way. In my opinion, System of a Down is the best, most motivated band out there today, one of the greats of this day and age. As said before, System is an acquired taste so it will not please everybody. But I think you will be surprised by the direction this album is taking them, so give it a listen and you might become a fan if you're not already.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You might as well order two boxed sets while you're at it--because you will be torn between your desire to lend it to anyone you like and respect, and your strong need to keep your own copy at home. So get one to lend. In truth, if it were possible to buy just the first disc, I'd say get that to lend out. After watching the first disc, most of your friends will be ordering their own copies. <br /> <br />I should also warn you that Star Trek and other sci-fi shows may seem a little cheesy to you after you watch Firefly. That's just how it goes. Oh, I should also warn you that you may find yourself doing things you thought you would never be geeky enough to do, like buying tee-shirts and coffee mugs with the Blue Sun logo, and reviewing the DVDs on Amazon . . .  <br /> <br />Ooops.
0792844882|1.0|Ah the wonders of showbiz. <br />How can a budding actress (Elizabeth Burkley) go from a sweet and funny teen comedy, to a cheap and physically sickening in-your-face sex movie. <br />Poor Elizabeth Burkley, this poor girl believed that Showgirls was to be her big break into hollywood however it turned out to be her big break into sex/shark attack scenes in a swimming pool. <br />That, i believe, was the final blow to classify showgirls as a barage of in your face nudity and bad sex scenes. I believe one movie critic (known as James Lee) described the infamous swimming pool sex scene as being a cheap imitation of a shark attack scene from jaws. I seriously doubt that this film will be winning any awards... apart from the award for the worst sex scene ever filmed. <br />Another flaw in this film was the apparent great dancing that was peformed by Ms Burkley in a club at the beginning of the film... however on seeing this i was very worried for her safety as it seemed as if she was having an epileptic seizure from the flashing lights. However when she was joined by a co star who also began to dance in the same way i realised that i was wrong. All in all this film is rubbish. Only be recommended this film to people you hate!!!
0596007124|4.0|As this was my first Head First book, it took a little to get used to the rather odd style of it, although the authors explain very well why this is and how it is to be used. <br /> <br />First of all, the book seems rather large with its some 640 pages. Do not let this discourage you however, as it is full of drawings, code samples and quiz questions, making it a relatively fast paced book to go through. <br /> <br />Covering all the basic patterns, it really adopts a down-to-earth relationship with these. Unlike most other books in the category, it does more than drown you with complex UML schematics and hardcore OO talk that does little more than make you feel inadequate. <br /> <br />I have 'only' rated it 4 because of two issues. First of all, I find that it repeats itself a bit too much. I know this is a deliberate style, but I find it a little excessive. And second; it does not really get down to the interesting stuff in all topics. It is clearly a basic tutorial where sometimes you must fetch a search engine to satisfy your curiosity.  <br /> <br />However, all in all, this is the best book I have seen introducing patterns and it can be recommended to anyone who does not understand why interfaces are such a big deal. In such cases, the book is definitely an eye opener to the reader.

B0002KVUKM|4.0|\\"Van Helsing\\" has not received so much publicity here, so I really did not know what to expect when I saw it. I knew it was connected marginally to \\"The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\", (where they mention Van Helsing's name once, I think). To say the least, I was very pleased with the movie overall, from the plot to the special effects.<br /><br />Van Helsing, (Jackman), starts the movie by doing in Mr Hyde, after which he is sent by a secret church order to Transylvania to help the beautiful, perhaps equally deadly, princess of an old gypsy family, (Beckinsale), save her family from Purgatory by eliminating Count Dracula, (Roxborough). Monsters from just about every classic book are in this movie from Frankenstein's creature, werewoves, and more.<br /><br />The action sequences are stunning, and the special effects used to achieve them are amazing. Van Helsing comes fully laden with lots of nifty goodies that are not so nifty for monsters. There are also moments of suspense in places that keep you on the edge of your seat for a bit of time. The balance between plot development, suspence and good, old-fashioned action has been well struck, and suits the movie well. It hardly feels like a movie that is over two hours long.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is very suave and cool in the role of Van Helsing. Jackman brings a very real sense of style to the role, bringing out the intense pain of a man that is tortured by a past that he doesn't remember and a life that he seemingly has no control over. Little wonder the makers were set on Jackman from the start. Kate Beckinsale is truly sultry and beautiful as Anna Valerious. She truly carries the driven and almost fanatical feel of the character well, and she really lets the viewer see the intense emotions of a woman driven by loss.<br /><br />There were only two points on which I would criticise the movie in a small way. First, was that the love interest between Anna and Van Helsing was a little bit predictable and unnecessary to the plot overall. Having said that, I have to also concede that the tension between the two provided some needed light relief from the overall darkness of the movie. Secondly, is Roxborough's Dracula, who seemed a little non-evil. In contrast to people like Anthony Hopkins, (Hannibal Lector in \\"Silence of the Lambs\\"), who can just ooze brooding and malevolent evil of the deepest kind, Roxborough seemed a little like a school boy try-hard succeeding in only reaching \\"mildly bad\\". Dr Evil in \\"Austin Powers\\" might term him \\"diet evil\\".<br /><br />If you can, the twin DVD set is an excellent buy and worth the money for the added features. They have an extensive section on the effects, which is incredibly interesting. I found it noteworthy that the actor who played Frankenstein's monster, also doubled as the human model in the scenes with Mr Hyde, so that Jackman had someone to look at before they inserted images of the computer Hyde into the shot. I also thoroughly enjoyed the sections on the making of the film, which provided some very cool background to the movie, and the bloopers, which were quite amusing.<br /><br />For a monster movie full of action and gadgets, \\"Van Helsing\\" is hard to beat. I loved it, and have seen it a few times without getting bored. The criticisms above are relatively minor and should not discourage you from enjoying what is a classic tale with lots of action. A fantastic movie, indeed.aid that, I have to also concede that the tension between the two provided some needed light relief from the overall darkness of the movie.

B00006RINF|5.0|First off i would like to say that i like this band more then evanescence and i love evanescence. Cristina Scabbia's voice is eretheral and angelic with a dark edge to it. I have to say that my absolute favorite song is comalies. The italian in it gives it a exotic quality that i like. It makes me sad, happy,and passionate. When i listen to the begining of comalies, i feel a little like crying for some reason. Overall great album. I do recommend it 100% to anyone!
B0000019PA|5.0|Well, the absolute first time I heard this album, (the first song, really) I broke down in tears.  Maybe it's just what I had been waiting for.  Maybe I'm hysterical. <br />I can't explain the sounds that exist on this album and how they manage to soak into your cells... <br />I've read a few of these reviews and the comments about Jeff's voice.  Well, sure it may be off at times, but that's part of what makes this album work so magnificently.  If you're looking for a completely polished sound, then perhaps more radio-friendly music is what you're looking for... <br />Rather, this album speaks to the very heart of your being with imagery that, to me, reminds me of the spiritual fanaticism I associate with Gabriel Garcia Marquez. <br />Immediately, I want to share this album with others who may not initally appreciate its scope, but hopefully over time, would come to enjoy, appreciate, and ultimately love this amazing work of art. <br />Do yourself a huge favor and own this album.
B00003OSSL|3.0|I approached \\"Random Hearts\\" with caution. I have begun looking into Sydney Pollack's filmography, and this was just one from the pile. He had disappointed me with \\"Havana\\" and \\"The Interpreter\\" lately and this one had quite a few bad reviews to weigh it down.  <br /> <br />It is not a perfect film, but it was an interesting examination of grief, loss, betrayal, and a strange route to recovery.If anything, it tries to do too much, that subplot about police corruption is absolutely needless, it has all the story it can handle already. Most romances are made good because of the chemistry between the two leads. Here the opposite is true, Ford and Scott-Thomas are anything but perfect for each other, and their personality conflicts make for pretty compelling drama despite stilted dialogue. They process the tragedy quite differently, and true to the spirit of the film, nothing is really resolved. They both end-up with a tenous grip on the reality of what happened. They took what they needed from each other, and benefitted from the relationship they managed to carve out of their mutual heartbreak. Anything more will have to wait. It''s refreshing to see that all was not repaired by the end titles. <br /> <br />The performances were wonderfully understated, Harrison Ford only does his trademark angry yell once and opts to be brooding and broken instead.  <br /> <br />The score is a delight.  <br /> <br />Rent \\"Random Hearts\\" its a film that offers no easy answers and that is rare today. <br /> <br />Also, it deserves extra points for winning me over despite the fact I was expecting an entirely different premise. I seem to remember a preview that suggested Ford's wife switched tickets with Scott-Thomas.
0792844882|3.0|Like \\"Mommie Dearest,\\" \\"Valley of the Dolls,\\" and so many others, taking \\"Showgirls\\" seriously will disgust and shock you - but watching it as a camp classic will bring howls of laughter. The DVD, with commentary from the Director, Stars, and Writer is a bonus because these guys take this film as a serious piece of art ! Reviewing this film is a waste of time - the writing, directing, acting, dancing - it is wretched. Elizabeth Berkley just is'nt showgirl material - she looks and talks  more like a hooker than anything but Gina Gershon pulls off her part fairly well. Kyle MacLaughlin is simply ridiculous and his sex scene with Berkley is the biggest laugh-riot of the film and poor William Shockley as the \\"hunky\\" Singer Andrew Carver looks like a shaggier, sleazier version of Michael Bolton.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Although not the same as the theatrical production, this is without a doubt the BEST Phantom Film in existance.  Its the truest to the book, and has a glorious score (of course).  The full orchestral score really adds in ways that the theatrical production lacks.  However, do not expect traditional opera vocals for the leading singers.  They are not that specific 'I'm going to impress you with my beautiful voice and sing!' but more so, they focus on the character's emotions.  I found that in certain scenes, I preferred the original cast, and in others, I preferred the movie cast because of the emotion they displayed (especially Gerard).   <br /> <br />Technically, the film was alright.  There were some scene shifts I thought weren't done very well, and some parts where transition from singing to speech was awkward.  The script is rather simplistic in some instances... however the focus is more on the music. The transitions from 'modern' paris to the Opera House Paris are awkward and disrupt the rest of the film for the most part, save in the beginning and the end.   <br /> <br />A final note on singing:  Christine is weak throughout most of the songs, she really shines in 'Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again' the 'Point of No Return' and 'Down Once More/Track Down this Murderer.'  Raoul is actually very good.  He's not as deep and resounding as the Original, but he lends a soft feeling to that compliments the character.  Phantom was outstanding in most of his songs with the exception of 'The Phantom of the Opera' and 'Music of the Night' which really do require a formally trained operatic voice to sound good.  Unfortunately, these are the notorious fan favorites and thus is the reason I think alot of people were disappointed.  However, Gerard gives the Phantom a much more twisted look, tortured, and vibrant feeling.   <br /> <br />Overall, the movie is a well done one, and worth the money to add to your collection.
B0007GAERG|4.0|Mariah did have tough times during the last years but that's all behind now with this album that is a proof that she still has control and credibility. \\"THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI\\" was produced by Mariah and Antonio \\"LA\\" Reid (in my opinon he's one of the best producers nowadays). And follows Mariah's style that goes from blues to pop and hip hop. A great combination that next to her delightful voice make an incredible mixture. The album brought Mariah back on top and I think that this happened this time because she was more relaxed and took time to do it right. \\"CHAMBRACELET\\" was a good album but it didn't have the strength that this one has. Just comparing the covers you can sense the different directions. The first cut for this album was \\"IT'S LIKE THAT\\" a very catchy song that is followed by \\"WE BELONG TOGETHER\\" which is a hip ballad. You go on and on through amazing songs and very good guests which are Snoop Dogg, Twista and Nelly. If you like Mariah you won't be sorry at all with this production. The two first singles which are Top 20's plus the dubut of the album at #1 on Billboard 200 (where it stayed several weeks on the Top 5) aren't fluke. Well actually I do't think that because an album sells millions of copies is better but this time shows an emancipation. Check the songs \\"STAY IN NIGHT\\", \\"CIRCLES\\", \\"GET YOUR NUMBER\\", \\"TO THE FLOOR\\" and \\"JOYRIDE\\".     <br />

B00006GA48|5.0|About \\"Closer to Home\\":<br /><br />Vintage Grand Funk Railroad sound! Holds its own when compared to GFR's invincible \\"Red Album.\\" \\"Closer to Home\\" is superior in variety of sound and composition, however. This record has Grand Funk's original lineup-Mark, Don, Mel, AND Terry Knight. All of the other GFR groups pale in comparison, and that's saying quite a bit, because the other group manifestations aren't bad. The songs on \\"Closer to Home\\" cover everything from simple love and attraction to the Viet Nam war. Now, I own all of GFR's albums, but compared to this era, the Terry Knight era, the other records are just plain weak. Grand Funk Railroad's peak did not occur during their Rundgren-Pop Billboard-Zappa-Christian-Rock phase; it took place throughout the \\"On Time\\" to \\"E Pluribus Funk\\" period, and \\"Closer to Home\\" is right in the middle of this era. (Not counting the \\"Live\\" album, this consists of live versions of previously released material.)<br /><br />FYI: The only CD that's a must-buy outside of the Terry Knight productions, is the Zappa produced, \\"Good Singin', Good Playin',\\"-because, well, it's Zappa!<br /><br />About the \\"Grand Funk Remasters\\":<br /><br />First of all, what took so freakin' long to release these records in this format? Why do we have to listen to crappy sounding CDs in this day and age? As Nathan (William Snape) says in \\"The Full Monty\\" during one of his dad's (Robert Carlyle) clumsy dance rehearsals--\\"that were crap!\\" Even the Beatles catalog is taking forever to get released on quality CDs! (\\"The Capital Albums Vol. 1\\") Oh well, better late than never, I guess! I just have one last thing to say to the record companies, et al involved concerning this faux pas; guess which finger I'm holding up!<br /><br />There's a world of difference between the sound of these CDs and the sterile sounding earlier digital releases of the same material; that fact alone justifies buying the remasters. However, the bonus music on these CDs makes them a must-buy for anyone who likes Grand Funk.them a must-buy for anyone who likes Grand Funk. <br />
B0002858YS|4.0|Very 80s sounding.  What I like is that you can understand the words, and that's a big plus nowadays. LOL   <br /> <br />Seriously, it's a well written and produced album.
0385504209|1.0|Exasperating... this is the only word I can find to describe this insult to the writing art. It could be forgiven only if it was the work of a budding 14 years old aspiring writer.. The characters are stereotypical mannequins monstruosly bumping aroud in a shallow, totally unrealistic plot devoid of any originality. The Harvard professor is shy and reserved, the english lord is snob and the french cryptologist.. well she is hot! Inconsistencies and blunders are scattered all over the place, and leave you in this strange state when you don't know if you want to throw the book away in a fit of rage or have a great laugh at such an helpless author. The Harvad professor and the cryptologist together have the brain of a turnip, fighting hard to solve little riddles that would be a joke for kid. But what made really burts with laughter was the choice of the super secret passord that should have securely guarded the cryptex (basically a bycicle lock) containing the precious Holy Grail secret.. the Gran Master chose his grandaughter's name! Anyone who has even a slight familirity with security knows that a loved person name is the first and most obvious and stupid password choice of a dummy! :)<br /><br />Another comical side is the attitude of Langdon and Sophie towards feelings and sex... when you read that Sophie has interrupted all contact with her beloved grandfather you imagine all sort of violent things..murder.. pedophily, ..rape and it finally turns out she just caught him giving a \\"ride\\" to a middle aged plump lady? Coooooome on!!!! And ok, you had to have a couple to make the story just a bit more stereotypical.. but at least make something reaistic, comlex and deep happen! No, by the end of the story Langdon and Sophie share only a timid kiss \\"full of promise\\". Is the author a teenager or just trying to win the favours of the neo-con prude wave?<br /><br />And the final blow.. at the end of all that road, the little secrets and passords and riddles.. there is nothing like the Grail but just a happy family reunion! In the best tradition of old telenovelas....<br /><br />Citing a really trashy italian TV show I could yell \\"Carramba che Sorpresa!\\".the Grail but just a happy family reunion!

B000021XS0|1.0|What's wrong with you people???? How can you actually listen to this junk. This loser band yet again makes another crappy album. This time they have this guy called \\"Rudess\\" or something lame, a poser who thinks he's the man because he's played a piano or two. Yeah right.   This \\"band\\" is so unoriginal and talentless that they repeat the same musak throughout their \\"album\\". If you listen to the song \\"overture\\" (this band also likes to make up words) you'll see that they repeat the same themes and notes later in the album. OMG what a bunch of uncreative lozers. If you take a musician like Avril Lavigne you'll see that she likes to change her music. She knows how to balance pure punk rebelliousness and emotional stuff. These guys could learn a thing or two from Avril. Also in one of her musak videos she's playing a piano. She could give this Rudess a run for his money!! Not only are these posers uncreative, they also use computer effects to make their music sound fast. There is no proof they can actually make these sounds with just instruments (live dvds don't count).
B00007L4OM|1.0|This was silly at the beginning, silly in the middle, and I don't what at the end given that I was so bored I stopped watching it halfway through. It intends to be funny but falls way short, the characters are annoying -the \\"spunky\\" daughter he suddenly inherits   is a willful smart-ass teenager, and the inspector is not convincing as a dad trying to protect his newfound daughter nor as a tough-cracking investigating officer. I regret the sleep I missed for this.
1594200106|3.0|Based on the blurbs, \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" was not what I expected.  It's not a bit profound, and Lucia Graves' translation seems rather clunky, but if you're in the mood for a florid, gothic entertainment, it's a fun way to pass the time.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Well, I must confess, I don't often write reviews, but, I feel that  after listening to this cd through a quite a few times, I should add my comments.  I will try and break this down into different categories which I find important. <br /> <br />Music (4/5):  I find musically, this CD is more of the same from SOAD.  There is nothing that really stands out throughout the entire CD with exception to Radio/Video which I believe is a unique, but certainly not to the extent which I know SOAD is capable of.  One of the great things about SOAD is their ability to toss in incredibly talented transitions, which is evident in this album.  I still vote the Music the best part of this CD.   <br /> <br />Lyrics (2/5):  I'm not quite sure what happened to SOAD's fantastic lyrics with this album.  I do realize Daron wrote a majority of the lyrics for this album which really pulls this album down.  I often look forward to SOAD's albums because of the crafty and great flowing lyrics; Mezmerize on the other hand, I find flows very poorly, with a lot of focus put towards the single BYOB (which is a great track by the way).  There is a lot of repetition in the lyrics lacking enough information to make them enjoyable to follow along with. <br /> <br />Packaging (4/5):  I quite liked the packaging of this album.  I quite like the originality of slightly raising the cover in certain spots, and the fact that everything seems a bit backwards.  The artwork is fantastic and I believe very well thought out and executed.  I would have liked to see some marketing gimmick added here with the addition of DVD ad-on or some other multi-media to watch, but, it's all about what's most important - the music. <br /> <br />Overall Content (2/5):  Where is the rest of this album?? Oh yeah, it comes out in less then a year.  The fact that this album runs it at under 40 mins is really disappointing.  I understand that by releasing one album as two separately drastically increases album revenue, but, please!Anyone with any sort of intelligence (which I believe a lot of SOAD fans have) will clue into this. A little bit of reverse psychology by convincing people that SOAD has done a serious amount of writing, and giving their customers two cd in less then a year! Now these guys seriously love their fans!!!  I guess I should stress that, I'm sure it's not \\"SOAD\\", but, the record labels.. At the end of the day, it's a business to make money, still annoying as I was expecting at least an hour of SOAD in my player on my upcoming 7hr drive to the mountains this weekend.   <br /> <br />I know I will buy Hypnotize when it is released.. This type of marketing works, so, 5/5 for that!! <br /> <br />Overall, worth the $9.99 (Canadian) I paid for it.  \\"Just Buy It\\"!
B00005RFVL|5.0|Listening to this super album I am shure The Rat Pack is  on some bar in heaven, having a blast of a time, just as I do, every time I listen to Robbie singing those swinging, mellow songs. <br /> <br />Specailly his Mack The Knife is out of this world, ha has that boyish charm, combined with an increadible  feeling of just the right tone <br /> <br />In my ears this music: swing must be th most difficult to sing. Often it becomes a flat, unpersonal performance, but Robbis hit it just perfect - if you get the chance buy the DVD concert from Royal Albert Hall, where one really has the chance to SEE Robbie as well, if one does not love him for that show, one is made of stone.

I can't wait for the 2nd season to come out in August. I am sure I will love watching it again and again as much as I have season 1!!
0694003611|1.0|I purchased Good Night Moon for my baby Grandson.  I thought this was the most over rated book ever.

I also think all of these people love this book because they think they have to like it for some reason. This Grandma can not recommend this book when there are so many better ones out there.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|The album is great, don't get me wrong, but I just feel as if some of their originality is lost in this one. It seems as if the style is starting to veer into generic hardcore or nu-metal. Also, some of the lyrics were rather boring, as if they're going \\"HEY LET'S STRING A BUNCH OF RANDOM WORDS TOGETHER THEN REPEAT THEM YAY\\" <br /> <br />Overall, I give it a four.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is the best album released in the 90s, better than anything released after the 90s and one of the albums of all time. Simple as that.
B00004RD54|5.0|For those of you looking to purchase this c.d. you might be interested to know that there is another c.d. called \\"Lou Reed Live\\" that is the rest of this concert. It took me years to find, thanks to the help of the internet, but it is just as good as this disc. If you've already had this album, then you probably like me thought it wasn't long enough? Thanks to the newly released version with bonus tracks it has been made better. But if that's still not enough, here's the answer. The \\"extended version\\" is available but it's basically the same as the original but with \\"explicit\\" lyrics included. Also included is Reed's best band ever! So if your buying Rock & Roll Animal you've got to make it a 2 pack & get \\"Live\\"! The complete show is worth the price of admission!
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|After being totally blown away with their last 3 CDs, this one just doesn't deliver.  There are a few standout cuts on here.  But not enough to keep my interest.  I'll probably listen to this one every now and then.  But their other discs will still get the most of my listening time.  Hopefully \\"Part 2\\" of this collection (Hypnotize) will be better.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|THIS A GREAT FOLLOW UP TO TOXICITY BUT ONLY 11 SONGS AND EVEN A BONUS TRACK, WITHOUT THE BONUS TRACK ITS ONLY 35 MINUTES.  THAT IS THE ONLY BAD THING ABOUT THIS CD OTHER THAN THAT ITS A REALLY SOLID EFFORT FROM SYSTEM OF A DOWN. I CANT WAIT FOR HYPNOTIZE, HOPEFULLY THEYLL STILL RELEASE IT LATER THIS YEAR LIKE THEY SAID, I CANT WAIT ANOTHER 4 YEARS FOR A NEW CD FROM THEM.
B000002VQQ|5.0|It gives me great pleasure to think that if anyone ever tried to cover any of the songs they would be making a complete joke of themselves. Ironically, \\"land of a thousand dances\\", a cover of a song made popular by wilson picket, and van morrisons \\"gloria\\" have got patti's guts all over um. If Neil Young was about one thousand times sexier maybe his \\"down by the river\\" could be a male equivalent. But, Patti Smith transends any gender issue despite the fact she and janus will never be matched in the female frontman category. If I had to attempt to show anyone the power of rock and roll I would just play \\"free money\\" and walk away. Also, the ballad \\"birdland\\" despite its 9 minute and 14 second span is probably the most captivating song on the album. She is simply put, fierce and fearless. Too many of our precious baby boomers missed this classic album in 1975 and now they scratch their heads as their own precious little one's slam good charlotte and simple plan into thier sad souls.  <br /> <br />
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is by far SOAD's best album. It's hard and soft at the same time and each song tells it's own story. When i first listened to the album I was simply in shock. I didn't think anything could be this great. The message is very clear...you will b MEZMERIZED!
0060930187|5.0|Reading the Bell Jar I got pulled into Esters world. Sylvia Plath pulls you into the world of a young woman and her slip into depression. In the first couple pages she speaks about seeing a cadaver for the first time, and that is just enough to  tweek your intrest. The way she speaks about some things can make you either bond with her or think she is compleatly insane.When I read this book i couldnt put it down and once i finished it stayed in my brain for days. This is possibly one of my favorite books that I've read in a long time and would highly recommend reading it.
B00008PW2D|4.0|but the writing and humor are just as good as any other of the seasons. Well worth watching.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This newest effort from System of a Down is, in my opinion, their best yet. I can't get over how great this album is, and it's only the first half of a two CD set. It opens on such a beautiful note, then goes crazy from there. Stirring up so many different emotions. This is unlike anything I've ever heard. I've been a fan since Toxicity. I love all their stuff. I got a little worried after hearing people's reactions from when they downloaded the album online(illegally), but all that worry has vanished. It's better than I could have ever expected. The only minor complaint I may have lies in the song \\"Violent Pornograpghy.\\" But then again, I've only listened to it a few times. The songs that stand out the most are \\"Revenga,\\" \\"Question!,\\" \\"Sad Statue,\\" \\"Radio/Video,\\" \\"B.Y.O.B.,\\" and \\"Lost in Hollywood.\\" The problem with some of the fans is that the album is so different from thier previous stuff. They want their self-titled album all over again. But SOAD has matured and grown artistically, and in a huge way. All great artists do. I can't wait until Hyponotize(the second of the two disc set) comes out. System of a Down is the greatest band out there right now, hands down. This is a must have for any fan of Metal, or music in general.
B00005JLPK|5.0|If visual arts warm your spirit and your soul is stirred by people who know how to express passion this movie is for you. I felt so WASP when I watched this movie. The music, the honesty of her life, the color... all were astonishing. I especially loved how Frida's works of art were presented. Truly inventive.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|I can remember...spring 1981, I was in 8th grade and was very curious about this band called Van Halen. One night, the dj on the FM station that played VH said that they were going to play Fair Warning in it's entirety and he said that \\"this is Edwards best guitar work..\\" It was like 1 in the morning and I made it through half of Meanstreet and feel asleep...well about a week after that I heard Eruption...and I freaked out!! Not knowing what album it was on, I went and bought Fair Warning..the \\"new\\" Van Halen album and that was it!!!! TO THIS DAY.... at 38 years of age...this is Van Halen's BEST album, BEST guitar work and THE highlight of the Roth era!!! After this album, they started to become superstars with 1984 and Diver Down...and I feel that the music started to lighten up. So, for those of you not familiar with Fair Warning...it's a good place to start...and finish!
B000089RVR|4.0|This one's a keeper.  Sure the hits are good but keep listening and the deeper into it the better it gets. \\"Mary's in India\\" is a wonderful song. Over all a nice cd. I hope Dido continues on her path to blend catchy pop music with something special.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I pretty much hated all punk music, but i got this album and was extremely impressed.  It goes way beyond the limited vision of all other punk music, with Strummer and co combining many musical differences and styles into a powerful mixture that is clear, idealistic, and inspiring.  I can do without any other punk album, but not this one.  I will always have a copy, it is an essential rock classic that everyone should own.  They really transcended the limits of punk to create a funky and fun album that is also serious and revolutionary.  go get it now!  Its just as good as the other reviewers claim.
B000000WHX|2.0|While it's obvious to hear this and think \\"Oh, so THIS is where Portishead came from...\\" (not to mention band alumnus Tricky) it's not in and of itself all that wonderful musically. The backing tracks are fairly decent and probably more interesting than the singing/rapping...and definitely moreso than the vocals.<br /><br />The three best songs here are \\"Safe from Harm\\",their cover of 70s hit \\"Be Thankful for What You've Got\\", and closer \\"Hymn of the Big Wheel\\".<br /><br />I can't compare this to their later albums, but I do know that I've found Tricky's solo work more compelling than what's here.
B000002J0P|5.0|this should be bought in conjunction with Deja Vu; it is just as strong an album and goes well in any cd collection.  it is very reminiscent of the 60's country rock movement, similar to Buffalo Springfield (one of these guys was in that band previously) and the Byrds (same thing).  In a way, CSN and CSNY was kind of a supergroup, which I tend to hate, but in this case they made some incredibly good music and had an honest message and approach to performance.  The myriad music legends that spawned from the crossing collaborations of these guys and Neil Young made some of the best rock music ever.  Check this out for some mellow rock magic.
B00000DLVA|2.0|On this one, the lyrics take a darker, more cynical tone, (\\"Do you really think/that love is gonna save the world?\\" from \\"Do you Believe?\\" is just one example) and the music adds quite a bit of electronic elements, even dabbling at times in trip-hop. In and of itself, growth and change is what keeps a band from stagnating, and generally I'm in favour of a band shifting from its strengths and struggling to find new ones.<br /><br />One thing that's non-negotiable in the search for new sounds, though, is strong hooks. The real problem with this album is there aren't enough \\"Wow!\\" moments: those songs that grab you and make you sing along.<br /><br />FIRST BAND ON THE MOON had \\"Lovefool\\" and \\"Been It\\" along with their cover of \\"Iron Man\\" and \\"Never Recover\\", all of which became stuck in your head with enough play. That just isn't happening for me with this one for the most part.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />\\"My Favourite Game\\" is the only immediate grabber here and a fairly gritty number for the Cardies. \\"Erase/Rewind\\" grafts a drum rhythm reminiscent of Queen's \\"Another One Bites the Dust\\" onto a shimmering keyboard part. \\"Starter\\" is a midtempo trip-hop number about reinventing yourself. (\\"Turning the pages/I used to hang on to/I was young and I have changed my mind/and I'm leavin' everything behind\\")<br /><br />LOWS:<br />\\"Nil\\" is a limp instrumental coda to the CD.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />If you loved the bubbly pop of \\"First Band on the Moon\\", you'll be disappointed in this. Even taken on its own trip-hop terms, I can't really say it compares favourably with Portishead and the like. Color me unimpressed.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|for all those uninititated in Beatle fandom, look no further than here.  This collection brings all of their \\"hits\\" (though not necessarily their best songs) into one place, though it infamously omits any songs from their oft praised \\"sargeant Pepper\\" album (I don't much like this album anyway, though)  this captures a lot of their most influential material; for me, the real magic is in the last half of the cd.  I feel that they were still a little immature at songwriting in the first half, and the songs are a little peppy, but you should still get this cd to see why they are so legendary.  Have fun!
B0001NBMBC|4.0|I am NOT, a 'maggot'. Nor am I fond of Iowa or thier self titled. However, this is quite a well made album. The drumming... That's the highpoint. As a drummer meself, I must say, its very, very good. The lyrics seem to be getting better as well. I must also confess that the lead singer has quite a good voice, and he screams well. However, the best track, in this humble reviewers opinion, is the faux live, Crushingly heavy, \\"Pulse Of The maggots\\". Well, if you are into metal, pick this up. I cant say I really am ( EXCEPT SYSTEM OF A DOWN!!!)but this album is really very well done. But anyway, this is quite an enjoyable listen... now if they'd only get rid of those damn masks... they might finally be taken seriously. <br /> <br />Stay Out Of The Daylight! <br /> <br />Isaac
B00006AG5N|4.0|I have a different set (I believe it is some obscure import) which has all of the original versions of these songs, and by comparison, this set is very good, sounds better, but is also a bit changed from the alternate takes.  I am not a huge Elvis fan, but I like many of his songs, and appreciate his contribution to popular music.  He is definitely the most famous rock star to ever go through the spotlight.  If you are a hardcore Elvis fan stick to the albums, but if you are new to Elvis and just want the hits, this is the best place to look, unless you also want the second disc that goes with this (which isn't necessary, I don't think).  This compilation gives Elvis the royal treatment of his legendary songs.  I just wish they had stuck to the originals on a few songs on this cd.
B0008ISM40|2.0|Sorry kids, been a fan of NIN since '89, old school hate machine and all that, but With Teeth is really bad. Really sophomoric in sound, like a 14 year old's vision of cheesy emotional lyric writing and rhyming and bad industrial. <br />And it's surprisingly a little lounge act-ish and barely electronic. <br />With Teeth (uh), the title track, has a musical interlude that sounds left over from The Fragile. <br />Who knew The Hand That feeds would be the best song off the album? And that is not saying much. <br />I counted several references to other NIN albums as if to remind us, hey Trent used to be good. <br />Sometimes I feel like I was one of the few people to like Faith No More's angel Dust but holy cow, only a few months ago Marylyn Manson rips off Be Aggressive and now Trent does it with Getting Smaller?! <br />  <br />Memo to Trent Reznor's best friends: for good of all of us, kick him in the nuts, make him unhappy, if you're his girlfriend, dump him and if you happen to have Danny Lehner and Charlie Clouser's phone numbers, please, by all means, pass them along to Trent because he seems to have misplaced the contact information for the two people who helped him forged the best music of his spiraling downward career. <br /> <br />You want something industrial, electronic, new and good, go try out VNV Nation's new album, Matter + Form
B00006V9A0|4.0|Okay, so Nirvanaphytes will always be critical of this release and say \\"where's this tune, where's that tune, etc.\\"  Fact is this CD wasn't made for Nirvanaphytes, it was made for the casual fan.  Sure, the diehards will come right back and complain that this is the only place to get the electric version of \\"You Know You're Right\\" and that they'll have to buy a bunch of songs they already have to get that one, but then that's why I have absolutely no sympathy for the recording industry in their plight against file sharing.      So then the question is - is this the \\"perfect\\" Nirvana compilation for the casual fan?  In other words, nevermind (pun intended) that it doesn't include fan favorites \\"Breed\\", \\"Drain You\\", \\"Something In The Way\\", \\"Serve The Servants\\", \\"Negative Creep\\", \\"Aneurysm\\" or non-album tracks like \\"Verse Chorus Verse\\" or \\"I Hate Myself And Want To Die\\".  Does it have all the anything beyond the Top 40 hits and the MTV videos?  Almost.  To me, it's aggravating that the song \\"All Apologies\\" is presented in its \\"MTV Unplugged In New York\\" version instead of the killer electric version from \\"In Utero\\".  Nor does the tracklisting indicate which version it is, which is also annoying.  One could argue that the unplugged version received more airplay than the original, but since tracks from that CD were put into heavy radio rotation in the immediate wake of Kurt Cobain's suicide, I tend to think this version had an unfair advantage.  If they had to go with multiple tracks from the unplugged CD, \\"Where Did You Sleep Last Night?\\", \\"Lake Of Fire\\" or better yet, presenting BOTH versions of \\"All Apologies\\" and/or \\"About A Girl\\" would make this a much more concise yet complete overview of Nirvana's career.      Having said that, for the middle-ground fan who neither has all the CD's nor the expansive box set, and doesn't think that this CD really gets the job done, here's what the 2-disc \\"Best of Nirvana\\" should contain:    DISC ONE:     Blew (from \\"Bleach\\")  AboutA Girl (from \\"Bleach\\")  Love Buzz (from \\"Bleach\\")  Negative Creep (from \\"Bleach\\")  Dive (from \\"Incesticide\\")  Sliver (from \\"Incesticide\\")  Been A Son (from \\"Incesticide\\")  Aneurysm (from \\"Incesticide\\")  Do You Love Me? (rare non-album track, Kiss cover)  Smells Like Teen Spirit (from \\"Nevermind\\")  Come As You Are (from \\"Nevermind\\")  Lithium (from \\"Nevermind\\")  In Bloom (from \\"Nevermind\\")  Breed (from \\"Nevermind\\")  Polly (from \\"Nevermind\\")  Territorial Pissings (from \\"Nevermind\\")  Drain You (from \\"Nevermind\\")  Something In The Way (from \\"Nevermind\\")    DISC TWO:    Oh The Guilt (rare non-album track)  Serve The Servants (from \\"In Utero\\")  Scentless Apprentice (from \\"In Utero\\")  Heart-Shaped Box (from \\"In Utero\\")  Rape Me (from \\"In Utero\\")  Dumb (from \\"In Utero\\")  Pennyroyal Tea (single remix)  All Apologies (from \\"In Utero\\")  Verse Chorus Verse  (non-album track)  I Hate Myself And Want To Die (non-album track)  About A Girl (live, from \\"MTV Unplugged In New York\\")  All Apologies (live, from \\"MTV Unplugged In New York\\")  Lake Of Fire (live, from \\"MTV Unplugged In New York\\", Meat Puppets cover)  The Man Who Sold The World (live, from \\"MTV Unplugged In New York\\", David Bowie cover)  Where Did You Sleep Lastnight? (live, from \\"MTV Unplugged In New York\\", Leadbelly cover)  Aneurysm (live, from \\"From The Muddy Banks Of The Wishkah\\")   You Know You're Right (non-album track)
B0007GAEW6|4.0|The four stars is for \\"L'via L'Viaquez\\" alone.  Thunderous riffs segueing into a beautiful latin groove, then to awe inspiring guitar pyrotechnics.  Don't know what it is about, but it is thirteen minutes of musical nirvana.   <br /> <br />As for the rest of it....astounding musicianship in desperate need of an editor.  There is a reason most music critics hate prog-rock. It can be pretentious as hell, and this album is not always an exception to that rule.  Nonetheless, I am glad I own it, and the aforementioned standout is on more than one of my mixes for the road. As an aside, I also have always been a fan of great drumming, and good God almighty this guy can play.

They have truely amazing and origianal sounds and beats.

0743487478|5.0|Alfie Kohn consistently writes thought provoking books which are well supported by research, which is carefully cited. As a result, you can easily follow up on any of the ideas he discusses. Because he provides a thoughtful and reasonable explanation of his ideas, you can generalize to many situations using the logic he lays out. His argument is deeper than \\"what works\\" or \\"what we have always done.\\" And that means it requires thoughtful consideration. It is well worth the effort. I am a parent, a grandparent, a psychotherapist, and a parent educator. I use all of Kohn's books, and I am extremely grateful that he has addressed the issues of parenting. It is helpful to be able to recommend good books to the parents with whom I have the privilege of working.
B00000255F|5.0|Bruce Springsteen has a remarkably fixed persona in the imagination of his fans for a guy who has radically changed his style several times.  \\"Born to Run,\\" his most essential album, was actually the end of one phase of his career--the phase when you could say his influences included Bob Dylan, Phil Spector and Leonard Bernstein.  During this period, he composed a number of very spacious music pieces that followed no obvious song structure, filling them with rapid-fire, clever wordplay and mysterious characters that seemed both familiar and exotic; and when the words ran out, he would offer long musical passages that have a cinematic quality, drawing on Broadway, jazz, early 60s rock, whatever he could get his hands on and teach his band.  Take \\"Thunder Road\\" for example.  I cannot figure out how that song is structured.  It is too excited to settle down in one place. And it is thrilling.  \\"Born to Run\\" and \\"Jungleland\\" are a little more organized in song structure, but each one is broken up by an instrumental section that has nothing to do, melodically, with the rest of the song.  And it's great in both songs. \\"She's The One\\" and \\"Backstreets\\" are more clearly homages to particular rock styles, but what power and passion he put into them. Roy Orbison, Frankie Valli, Ronnie Spector, but also Ezio Pinza and Mario Lanza seem to be lurking in his powerful vocals.<br /><br />\\"Born to Run\\" has precedents in his first two albums, especially songs like \\"Kitty's Back,\\" \\"Incident on 57th Street,\\" \\"Rosalita,\\" and \\"Spirit in the Night.\\" But I don't think he ever came back to making music remotely like this.  He moved on, in \\"Darkness at the Edge of Town\\" to a simpler verse/chorus/bridge/instrumental break/verse chorus pattern, and to words that were far more plain-spoken, while remaining beautifully poetic, and continued that in \\"The River.\\"  Then, with \\"Nebraska,\\" he became something else, a kind of neurotic Woody Guthrie, and with \\"Born in the USA,\\" something else again--the politically committed sex symbol. It's all just fine and a lot of great music has come out throughout his incredible career.  But it's little sad to me to hear the final howls of \\"Jungleland\\" and know that he never did another song like it.  For early fans like me, \\"Born to Run\\" seemed like a beginning when it came out; but it was an ending.the politically committed sex symbol.

B000060MY6|4.0|David \\"Twin Peaks\\" Lynch apparently takes great pleasure in thumbing his nose at viewers.  He creates marginally comprehensible plots with minimal explanation and makes us squirm trying to figure out what's going on.  \\"Mulholland Drive\\" is a flick that begs for multiple viewings.  The largely unsympathetic characters however made me not care to try establish a deeper understanding of Lynch's plot.<br /><br />Naomi Watts acted her roles of plucky aspiring actress and Ontario native Betty Elms and femme fatale Diane Selwyn with great aplomb.  We are led to believe that she's just arrived and will be residing in her Aunt Ruth's L.A. apartment while the aunt is away.<br /><br />Coincidently Laura Haring playing Rita has just survived a horrific high speed auto accident with leaves her with amnesia.  She stumbles through the L.A. canyons and winds up sneaking into Watt's aunts apartment seeking shelter prior to Watts' arrival.<br /><br />When they meet a sympathetic Watts offers to help Haring figure out her identity.  This ultimately results in a steamy lesbian sexual romp between them.<br /><br />In a seeming unrelated tangent, movie director Adam Kesher played by Justin Theroux is being pressured by two apparent gangster brothers to cast a particular actress in the lead role of his latest movie.  Not only does he come home unexpectedly to find his wife in the sack with Billy Ray Cyrus but he gets threatened by a mysterious cowboy urging him to cast that actress.  There are too many other tangents to the plot to enumerate but they serve more to confuse than clarify.<br /><br />About 2 hours into the flick Haring implores Watts to accompany her to a club called Silencio.  While there the creepy emcee announces that all that they see in the show is not real.  This proves to be a foreshadowing for the remainder of the plot.<br /><br />Apparently all the action leading up to that point was ostensibly a dream sequence.  Watts is actually suicide victim Diane Selwyn, whose life has been tragically played out before us.  The sudden unexpected ending is designed to suffice as an explanation for all that has happened before.  Guess what?  It doesn't.<br /><br />Lynch unfortunately doesn't make enough use of his bit part actors excepting Ann Miller playing maternal landlady Coco Lenoix.  The talents of accomplished Lee Grant and the very competent Dan Hedaya were not maximized.  The flick was beautifully filmed in and around L.A.  The surreal scenes in Club Silencio were some of the movie's best including the stirring, poignant song sung by Rebekah del Rio.whose life has been tragically played out before us.

1401200923|4.0|Concluding the story line, Batman volume 2 assures this story will be counted with the great Batman stories, such as Killing Joke, Death in the Family, and Dark Knight. Last issue showcased familiar friends and enemies with new twists, the second volume is no exception. Harley Quinn, Joker, Harvey Dent, Jim Gordon, Barbara Gordon, Nightwing, Robin, Clayface, Talia, Ra's al Ghul, Lady Shiva, and a few cast members that come back from the dead are all present to wrap up this arc.<br /><br />As before, Jeff Loeb's stories and Jim Lee's pencils blend seamlessly together, presenting a well through out, roller coaster of a tale. At the end, Batman is left exposed and unsure, which is a nice twist on the normally confident Dark Knight.<br /><br />I can't tell much about the plot without giving away the whole thing. However, I will reveal the reason I only gave this volume 4 stars: the villain seemed too obvious to me. I had it guessed a few pages into volume 1 and unfortunately I was right. I was hoping to be surprised. Still, I look forward to the next time this particular villain and Batman fight again.<br /><br />This is yet another one of the Batman comics's Lazarus pits, magical transformations that bring the book from good to perfect.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|This record has so much depth and variety that it's scary.  Suffice it to say that with each listen layers are added and the listening experience becomes one of incredible richness.  This is Ryan Adams' best record of his career, hands down.  He has put out excellent records, to be sure.  He has released amazing songs such as \\"Shadowlands\\" on his Love is Hell EPs.  But this album is absolutely mind-blowing in the consistency, poignancy and depth of the songs.  One needs to listen to this record AT LEAST three times before I believe a true appreciation of everything it has to offer can be absorbed.  I mean if you're a fan of Ryan's and you don't do yourself the favor of buying this album and living with it for a couple of weeks in order to gain this appreciation then . . . well, your loss.
1401200605|5.0|\\" Wow\\" was my first reaction when I learned Jeff Loeb and Jim Lee were going to collaborate on Batman. My second reaction was, \\" I hope this can live up to the hype\\". Not only did it live up to the hype, it blew it out of the water.<br /><br />Loeb and Lee begin Hush in this volume which collects Batman 608-612. The story doesn't begin with a whimper, but with a bang- a knock down, drag out fight between Batman and Killer Croc. Then, in a whirlwind Poison Ivy, Catwoman, huntress, Lois Lane, Superman, and the mysterious, bandaged Hush all build intrigue into this spectacular graphic.<br /><br />A few of the treasures I was particularly thrilled with were the flashbacks painted by Jim Lee depicting Bruce Wayne's childhood before the fateful gunshots that would change him into the Batman. Also, this graphic opens with a two page retelling of Batman's origin by the Hush crew.<br /><br />The only word of warning I have is since this is 1-5 of a 12 part story arc, vol. 1 will stop in the middle of the story.<br /><br />Hush is one of the great Batman stories and one of my personal favorites.
B0007P0U6M|1.0|Too bad I did not go on line before I paid $3.99 to see this movie.  Four stars in a trashy movie.  When I view a movie I don't like to come away with being depressed and disgusted.

0613667662|5.0|Fables: Legends in Exile reprints the first 5 issues of the Vertigo Comics' series, Fables. The concept of the series is well done, original, and interesting. The classic fairy tale figures of legend were driven from their lands by a mysterious creature named \\"the Adversary\\". Left with no choice but leave their lands or die, the Fables fled to New York City, living in secret, judging, policing, and governing themselves.<br /><br />This volume centers around the question, ` Who murdered Rose Red?\\" The beloved sister of Snow White is violently murdered, her apartment soaked in blood, her body missing. Immediately Snow White, who is now the Deputy Mayor of the Fable community enlists the help of Bigby Wolf, who is now the Sheriff. Together, they sort through a very unusual list of suspects, including Bluebeard, Jack (of Jack and the Beanstalk), and Prince Charming himself.<br /><br />Personally, I love this volume and Willingham's take on the characters. Happy ever after rarely means just that, everyone has distinct personalities that are more mature and devolved than the original fairy tales had time to discuss, and the characters are flawed. It makes for a brilliantly fun read.<br /><br />The only word of caution I have is this story has adult language and sexual situations, so keep that in mind when determining appropriateness. But for every adult out there, this is a great, fun graphic to read, with nice art and an original prose story by Willingham \\" A Wolf in the Fold\\".

While the posuers and party people hooked onto \\"Closer\\" my sophomore year, I first discovered an earlier effort called *Pretty Hate Machine*.<br /><br />Now founder and front man Trent Reznor brings an LP some believe harkens back to that seminal album. Yes, *With Teeth* stays true to established Nails themes and elements. Yet it evolves both musically and socially from the very sub-genre he helped create. Overall, *With Teeth*  is a fine addition to the NIN discography, though also quirky and different enough to put everybody off.<br /><br />-1989 Inch Nails--<br /><br />People seem to have trouble fingering this album. There's a lot a blanket comparisons to past works. That's understandable precisely because it isn't that simple. For example, people say track 2 sounds like something from *Broken*. But \\"You Know What You Are?\\" features chords, beats, tones, and lyrics almost alien to the 1992 EP. The track sounds more mature and expensive than probably the entire, earlier album. The only similarity lies in the sheer vocal aggression.<br /><br />Even more inaccurate and complicated are the comparisons to *The Downward Spiral's* \\"Hurt\\" and *With Teeth's* \\"Right Where it Belongs\\". Yes, both haunting pieces end their respective albums with a whimper instead of a bang-a NIN trademark. The former focuses on the dramatic ruin of a man.  It's a self-pitying tragedy. The newer track, aside from being a more complex piece of music, portrays a man fighting to live and to assert his identity in a mass media world. It almost contradicts \\"Hurt\\" to say \\"Hey, don't take this all so seriously! I'm just a rock star. Hear that audience cheering towards the end of the song? That's my idea of making fun of me and my fans alike!\\"<br /><br />Indeed, a lot of *With Teeth* sounds like an effort to break away from the mold he cast himself in his first three albums. \\"Only\\" draws PHM comparisons because of it's overtly 80's style beat, combined with lyrics bearing a superficial resemblance to \\"Down in it\\". But it doesn't seem to occur to people that this might be satire-even sarcasm. \\"Only\\", like \\"RWIB\\", seems to reflect a tongue-in-cheek reference to his entire reputation, in addition to his first album.<br /><br />-Breaking the Fragile-<br /><br />Standing 16 years from *PHM*, his latest album seems to draw from its immediate predecessor. Reznor's 1999 double-CD *The Fragile* remains among my favorite music albums of all time, in part because it demonstrated a musical depth and complexity far beyond anything attempted in not only in Reznor's earlier efforts, but that of many other artists.<br /><br />But Reznor, like many other meaningful artists who hit it big around 1994, made the mistake of waiting too long. It wasn't just a matter of the \\"Closer\\" poseurs leaving the show in the face of Reznor's improved musicianship. In his five-year absence, Britney Spears and Limp Bizkit stole the spotlight. The wings filled up with rap-rockers, piano girls, and strip-tease pop stars. In the `99 music environment, *The Fragile* went straight to the head of the stage--only to be pushed into the orchestra pit.<br /><br />-Somewhat Repaired-<br /><br />*With Teeth* sounds like a lessoned learned, being the most dance, single, and radio-friendly material he's made in my ears. It drops the instrumentals, and a lot of instruments, and cranks up the bass over guitars and drums. The first half rocks with catchy anthems and raps. Supposedly geared towards a more live or organic performance, the album sounds heavily synthesized to me, and frequently reminds me of David Bowie-reasons why people might compare it to *PHM*.<br /><br />Yet a lot of *Fragile* and *Still* mechanics exist here. Reznor pulls off a coup in retaining the complexity and depth of music while making it utterly stripped and digestible. And like its predecessor, many of the tracks abandon lyrics at some point to embark on lengthy and fascinating solos. The lyrics themselves tend towards *Fragile*  structure than those of prior albums. *With Teeth* also marks the second album in a row in which the song titles are as lengthy and involved as the music. Finally, it builds off the *Fragile* graphic design, employing a minimalist album art consisting of fuzzy close ups and maimed logos, as well as abandoning the distinctive font used in most of the NIN catalogue.<br /><br />Structurally, the album inverses *Fragile*, having a rocking first half and a more critical second. It also resembles *PHM* in being an anthology of songs. Yet it's extremely cohesive-one of the most cohesive pieces Reznor has assembled. I think it's as conceptual an album as anything Reznor's done. As the album progresses the tracks increasingly and dramatically segue, and plunge into increasingly challenging and interconnected layers. So too are the ideas in the songs.<br /><br />Overall *With Teeth* has at lot more depth and individuality than it may first appear to have, both beneath the public appeal and among NIN's prior albums. I can listen to \\"Right Where it Belongs\\" constantly though it's not something to tap my feet to as I'm driving to work. This is the sort of thing I look for in music.<br /><br />-And All that Could Have Spent-<br /><br />I'm also keeping a close eye on the disc. The 5.1 surround sound of the dual disc sounds great to me. But it's a dual disc--dual the music, dual the fingerprints and scratches and heat exposure. Also, I notice the CD side doesn't like my home theater system, and I get a lot of read errors.<br /><br />Which leads me to the album tray and cover. The layout compares to *PHM*: both albums are the only albums to feature Reznor's picture. Both also invoke computerized distortion in the album art. Then it departs for the first time from the practice of including lyrics and album information. The cover looks and feels like the same sort of thin cardstock used with *And All that Could Have Been* Deluxe, only with out the heavy cardboard slipcase. On the other hand, I paid less for *With Teeth* dual-disc edition than that of esoteric and anti-establishment CD's like King Missile's *Royal Lunch*.<br /><br />In the end, *With Teeth* seems to gain good reviews, but it's more of a challenge than people credit. No mere throwback, NIN critics probably won't be converted by its satires and self-references, while those who take the past drama too seriously may be disappointed by the very same. None of this wears the record for the worse. It's about as straightforward a band rock album as NIN manages while still being complex and unique.retaining the complexity and depth of music while making it utterly stripped and digestible.

0596007124|5.0|I don't know Java and don't plan on learning it, other than just being able to decipher it. I am a Coldfusion MX developer learning how to use components in OO methodologies. From looking around the Internet I learned every detail about the basics of OO but still couldn't grasp the OO thinking. You can learn everything about OO and when you sit down to program you'll just draw a blank. Knowing OO won't make you an OO programmer, thinking in OO will. <br /> <br />That's where Head First Design Patterns comes in. I picked up this book in a store and thought a miracle had happened. Finally the resource I'd been looking for all my programming life!!! I bought it and read it over and over again all the time and each time I make another discovery. It's the most valuable book in my library and the most read. <br /> <br />You don't just learn patterns, you learn OO thinking. I highly recommend this for anyone trying to grasp OOP in any language. Go through it and do the examples in your programming language and you'll see the light. It'll all come together so fast and easy. It literally saved me months or years of self-study to get this stuff down. If you want to learn OOP then I suggest looking around the Internet, then when your ready to think in OO pick up this book.
0345409671|5.0|I wholeheartedly think that this book should be required reading in every religious education class. It is a wonderful story that will shock all but the most stubborn of people. If you like to have your faith put in the spotlight and new ideas put in your head and heart, then read this book. If you would rather be another dull and uninspired person then I would suggest you stay right where you are. This book in my opinion only is not designed to place ideas in your head. It is simply designed to make you think.
B000003TA4|5.0|I will not add any praise to the thousands of positive reviews this album has had, as I clearly cannot say anything that hasn't been said. The only thing you need to know about this album is that it is one of thoses records that comes by every decade or so that totally changes the face of music (if not art). Nirvana will be remembered decades from now, probably to the same extent as The Doors. The only other band from the 90's that will be remembered is Radiohead, although they didn't revolutionize anything. They're just our generation's Pink Floyd without the Dark Side of the Moon (I'm still waiting).
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|This album shows that the wanderlust spirit of this man continues to take the journey of discovery within music. He doesn't rest on his past and he is familiar enough with the present so as to combine both for the 21st century. Mighty Rearranger is a nice continuation from the very stylistic Dreamland and continues the string of quality solo material dating back to Fate of Nations. His solo career jus might in itself be Hall of Fame worthy but what matters is the music. It's great stuff!! Blues, folk, and the sounds of Morroco all combine for a sound that's inviting yet not overpowering. The Enchanter is simply haunting and I love his lyrics on Tin Pan Valley which is one of his very best written songs he has ever pinned. The band is solid and a tight unit which works well together. Hey its not Led Zeppelin and it never need be. It's not 1975 anymore but like many have said this album probably has some of the same inspiration in its contents like that hard rock classic. Keep an open mind and you will be rewarded with an album from an artist who truly is like fine wine. He gets better with age.
B00028HBKC|1.0|I am not a Christian, but I used to be one, and I still attend church services with my family.  So with my history, I find it disturbing how seriously Christians have taken this movie.  \\"The Passion\\" has been shown more reverence than a Billy Graham Crusade.  The way I see it, this is evidence of religion being contaminated by the shallow dimensions of popular culture and by capitalistic stratagems.  A movie could reasonably deserve such  respect from the religious community if the movie contained an intelligent, illuminating, and thought-provoking message, but \\"The Passion\\" offers no such thing; just the visceral implications of seeing Jesus Christ get beat up.   <br />       It scares me that so many people who have seen the movie give it such high critical praises.  There has probably never before been a point in the history of American cinema where a movie has gotten such accolades and has so little deserved them.  \\"The Passion\\" is a crappy movie, plain and simple.  If the main character were just an ordinary Joe, this movie would have been a complete failure.  The storyline is only substantial enough to lead the film from one torture/humiliation scene to the next.  The dialogue is perfunctory at best; it exists merely to keep this movie from being an old-fashioned silent film.  The characters are vague and uninteresting.  In particular, the Roman soldiers who abuse Jesus are cartoonishly brutish in appearance and demeanor.  In regards to all the characters who are only passingly mentioned in the Gospels, it seems that Mel Gibson makes no effort to bestow these individuals with any personality.   In regards to the violence in this movie, I am myself somewhat of a gore-fanatic, so I can't really complain much in that respect.    However, this hefty of a violence element, when combined with a puny plot, dialogue, and characterization, seems to create an exceptionally bleak and grim result.  I usually enjoy movie violence, but in this movie, the violence just isn'tany fun.  Furthermore, I don't understand why anyone would want to purchase the DVD for this movie.  It was bad enough that I had to sit in a movie theatre and listen to audience members shrieking and crying, but why on earth would I want to watch this disturbing stuff in the comfort of my own home?  Only sadists have a good reason to buy this video. <br />       As a movie, \\"The Passion\\" is crap.  However, I can think of another, more positive, way of looking at this movie that salvages the perception of its quality.  \\"The Passion\\" is better viewed as a long montage of Christ's darkest hour, or a hybrid of cinema and visual art.  One thing that is obvious about \\"The Passion\\" is that the film is far more concerned with visuals and imagery than anything else.  I suppose, depending on how you look at it, this movie presents you with either silly and profuse melodrama or poignant visual poetry. <br />        <br /> <br />       <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is a great step forward for Greenday! Some people said the songs were slow and boring... Listen to the lyrics! The stories that the songs tell are both intriging and great! True, Bulivard of Broken Dreams is heavily overplayed, but the rest of the songs are just as good as that one! <br />Listen to Jesus of Sububia and Death of St. Jimmy, which are great and epic songs! Overall, Buy this! Each song is an experience, and you'll listen to it again and again!
B000002ULO|4.0|After coasting on mediocrity from the mid-1980s through the early 1990s, Paul McCartney's artistry resurfaces on \\"Flaming Pie\\" - one of his strongest post-Beatle efforts. Highlighted by memorable tracks such as \\"World Tonight,\\" \\"If You Wanna,\\" \\"Somedays,\\" \\"Calico Skies\\" and \\"Really Love You,\\" the album displays McCartney's renewed commitment to solid rockers and beautifully crafted ballads. It represents his best work since the classic \\"CHOBA B CCCP.\\"
B00008H2LB|4.0|im kinda torn when i go about writing a review on this cd. the upside: very catchy songs, cool effects, and chester is an awesome singer. the downside: im not a fan of rapping, but at least mike is bearable. then, the music. if anyone ever said lp are great musicians, they dont know anything about music. they can add cool effects to their songs and they can experiment with different sounds (like in \\"nobodys listening\\") but when it comes to straight up guitar/bass/drums, they are average, and far behind many underground bands of today. however, to spite this, they make great songs, even though alot of them sound similiar, this cd is amazing to listen to despite the lack of instrumental talent
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|You know, I'm sort of an old timer when it comes to metal. I loved the old Sabbath back in the day but my tastes in music have meandered (not mellowed!) over the years. I haven't really crossed into metal country in quite a while, but believe me, this band has my river flowing something fierce! <br /> <br />I just like what, to me, is good music. This is good music. Anytime a band takes their genre to a new level or creates something that is unique they deserve credit.  <br /> <br />This is heavy duty stuff, explosive even. But created with brains and talent not simply raw agression. <br /> <br />When I popped this into my car stereo today after picking it up the Intro/BYOB pair of tracks made me feel like I was on one of the most exciting thrill rides at any amusement park! <br /> <br />The smart lyrics, the sheer force and electricity of their sound and the unexpected tempo changes and even catchy harmonies at points make this one of the most suprisingly appealing releases of the year for me!

B00008OLYN|5.0|I have been a fan of most kinds of rock music since 1965, but I have always had a particular fondness for progressive rock.  During the past five or six years a good friend introduced me to the music of Porcupine Tree, and that band has become one of my favorites.  I became curious about Opeth when I noticed Porcupine Tree was opening for them on a tour during the last couple of years.  Apparently PT's leader Steven Wilson had been influenced by harder sounds, including some of those of Opeth, and it showed on PT's \\"In Absentia\\" album.    When I discovered that Wilson produced \\"Damnation\\" and provided assistance on keyboards and vocal harmonies, I immediately ordered the CD.  I was not disappointed at all, as this is simply one of the best discs I have purchased in a long while, including some of my Porcupine Tree CDs.      The songs smolder... something is bubbling beneath the surface in each and every number.  Opeth has a reputation as a \\"death metal\\" band, and this album conveys a sense of quiet desperation, sometimes agony...  but all the instruments have a \\"clean\\" sound.  There is nothing fast, nothing sounds muddy, and there is no screaming.  Instead, what you get is a fairly quiet but tense album full of emotions that are barely concealed, like in an aching heart ready to burst... with a band that displays remarkable patience in the musical arrangements.    The crisp drumming and Wilson's use of the mellotron (particularly on the album-opener \\"Windowpane\\") make me think of those aspects of King Crimson's sound in the Seventies.  Mikael Akerfeld's vocals are nothing short of incredible in that he can reveal so much emotion when he sings.  He has a beautiful voice, and it is wonderfully complemented by Wilson's harmonies.  The guitar-playing and bass-playing are solid, and the instrumental piece \\"Ending Credits\\" is outstanding.  The way the intense guitar lines snake around throughout the album lends the whole production a rather crawly feeling, as if somethingis about to explode.    While I wouldn't say this is an uplifting CD, I think it is a great one, a very satisfyingly organic work.  There is strength to be found in the way all parts work together to create a solid whole.  The result is a complete, mature, determined, fully realized work of art.    Now that I know more about Opeth, I intend to explore their louder side as well.  It is good to know Wilson has produced other albums of theirs, too.  Thanks to Porcupine Tree and Steven Wilson for helping me discover a great new band!  And thanks to Opeth for changing some of my conceptions about what makes a band what it is.
B0007WZUMO|4.0|I just want to say that I have been a fan of the band/man since 1990, as well as various side projects.  I would also like to say that \\"With Teeth\\" is not the album it should be.  It is more retrogressive rather than progressive from any of the other albums, using early forms of techno and even industrial disco (!), more than what is known as industrial metal such as Ministry and the like, or industrial dance such as KMFDM and the like.  Think more along the lines of bands like Kraftwerk, Cyberaktif, Divine, and early (read pre-1988) Nine Inch Nails while MTR was still experimenting in college in Ohio electronic music classes (can anyone say \\"Purest Feeling\\"?).  So if you like experimental Nine Inch Nails, you will like this, but maybe not so much.  A lot of fans are going to say \\"WTF!\\" for this album.  I just would like to say that this is apparently a bridge to what should be a great next album, possibly even better than \\"The Fragile\\".  But remember, every artist has got to have one album that everyone hates and loses them fans for them to re-evaluate and make a brillant next album.

B0002FR07O|5.0|I loved everything about the original release of \\"Signify\\"...  the cover art; the lush, dense sound; the songwriting and musical performance.  Songs like \\"Waiting\\" and \\"Sever\\" are classics in my book.  Steven Wilson is a virtuoso guitarist with a great voice and incredible writing and arranging skills, Richard Barbieri holds things together with his keyboard textures, Colin Edwin is as steady a bassist as one will find anywhere, and the band's original drummer Chris Maitland is technically gifted on the drums but definitely not to the point of not allowing emotions to come through in his playing.   <br /> <br />So why would a reissue be so much better than the original release?  I'm not an audiophile, but this remaster actually does sound a bit cleaner, maybe less \\"dark\\" in places, maybe due to the remastering, and that's fine...  but for me, this was the drawing card:  included here is a second CD of 10 demos by Wilson, recorded during the time of \\"Signify\\"!  And while these demos don't sound quite like a fully fleshed-out band, they do sound very, very good.  He does a nice version of \\"Nine Cats\\", which appeared on \\"On The Sunday Of Life\\", an early PT effort performed by Wilson.  Other songs include demos of \\"Sever\\" and \\"Waiting\\", and if you listen carefully to the other seven demos, you might notice sections of these songs that were eventually used on \\"Signify\\".   <br /> <br />All in all, the package offers the original album as well as some very listenable insights into its making.  For fans of Porcupine Tree, this is not to be missed.  For newcomers, there is a lot here to enjoy if you like good musicians playing and singing good, inventive music.  Check it out!  <br /> <br />

0553382179|4.0|This book has three strong points which make it a worthy purchase: <br />1.  Her method for establishing and keeping home routines running smoothly is simple and effective. There is not a better method on the market that I am aware of (and I collect home management books). <br />2.  Online support is available for those who wish to use her program and methods.  You will be e-mailed several times a day with assignments and \\"encouragement\\" (see note 1 under weaknesses). <br />3.  Her method assumes a very low starting point (cluttered home, sink full of dishes) and encourages steady, gradual improvement. (She refers to her method as \\"baby steps\\".) This is in sharp contrast to the massive whirlwind cleaning efforts that most people try on their own. <br /> <br />The book, like most also has some weaknesses. <br />1.  The author mixes a pseudo-Christianity and eastern mysticism (feng shui) to create her own little religion which she preaches throughout the book.  This was a HUGE turn-off for me. <br />2.  The author's focus is getting rid of extra clutter.  She gives very little direction on organizing and maintaining what is left.  I highly recommend \\"Organizing from the Inside Out\\" by Julia Morgenstern and/or \\"Confessions of a Happily Organized Homemaker\\" (especially if you have school-aged children) in conjunction with this book. <br />3.  Like every other organizational author that has pulled herself/themselves out of a horrificly dirty and cluttered home, she has a set of quirky \\"rules\\" that she feels are essential.  Take these with a grain of salt.  I feel no compulsion to shine my sink to a mirror-like finish, set out my outfit the night before, or even throw away 27 items at regular intervals.  Other authors have equally bizarre rules that dealt with their specific trouble areas but are far from mainstream home management skills. <br /> <br />This book is worth the purchase price simply for the method she uses to establish and maintain household routines.  Anything else you gain from it is gravy.
0767834739|3.0|I like Milla Jovovich as a superhero.  Her breakout role in \\"The Fifth Element\\" was all that was needed to sell me on her.  She was fine in the first \\"Resident Evil\\", which was better than perhaps it was given credit for.  But in \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\", Jovovich's Alice is given something of a makeover.  When we last saw Alice at the end of the first movie she had been captured by scientists from the evil Umbrella Corporation and was subject to some tests and experiments.  At the end of the movie we saw Alice walking alone on a street that was desolate and ruined, as if there were some sort of war or battle.  It is at this point that \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" begins.<br /><br />Raccoon City is the victim of the T-Virus from the Umbrella Corporation.  This virus turns ordinary people into flesh eating zombies (is there another kind?), and like any good zombie virus, it is highly contagious.  Umbrella Corporation apparently has the power to lock down the city and prevent anyone from leaving, but there are still some citizens left alive, including \\"disgraced\\" police officer Jill Valentine (Sienna Guillory).  Jill, and another officer attempt to hide before leaving the city and while being confronted by some nasty zombie creatures they meet Alice.  During that whole period where she was a captive and the victim of experiments, Alice has apparently picked up some sort of upgrade to her natural biology because she kicks serious butt here.  She fights like a super soldier or super hero, more like \\"The Fifth Element's\\" Leeloo than anyone else.<br /><br />Besides the hordes of zombies, there is also a new super zombie looking creature called Nemesis which is stalking the city.  Exactly what Nemesis is and where it came from is a little bit of a mystery, though a little thinking about the clues given will solve the riddle fairly quickly.<br /><br />This is a nothing special action/zombie movie.  Fans of the first \\"Resident Evil\\" may be disappointed.  I know that despite myself, I did enjoy the first movie.  There was more character interaction and character development, but this movie just had hordes of zombies and a bit too much action.  And while I like Jovivich as a superhero, this didn't seem to be a role that really needed to such an incredibly strong superhero.  I guess I didn't belive it.  The door was left open for a third movie, and perhaps there will be one, but until that point there is no real reason to watch \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\".  There are far better movies out there.<br /><br />Grade: C<br /><br />-Joe Sherrythat despite myself, I did enjoy the first movie.

He is able to tackle many problems of environmental destruction and arguments saying we should not worry about the way things are going. His accounts of modern and past socities focus on what went wrong and why such as the collapse of past socities such as the Easter Islands and the Anasazi and modern problems such as genocide in Rwanda and Burundi. His work provides accounts of the problems we face now and how we can change them.
B00005YUPO|1.0|I don't care for most of the Baby Einstein videos (I have only liked 4 out of 16 that I have watched).  Baby Bach happens to be one of the ones I don't like.  It's just music with toys and spinning things; like many of the Baby Einstein videos.  One toy was pretty neat (a spinning top with blue water inside).  Other then that, what really is the point of these videos?  I really don't get it.  I can just imagine my kid wanting all the toys they see.  This video also had some very ugly clown faces in it.   <br /> <br />I still don't like most of the Baby Einstein puppets and this video is no exception.  At one point in the video you see a chicken puppet clucking.  Then a you hear a voice that starts to say something and then instead of the chicken you see a little girl (Aspen Clark).  She's apparently telling a joke.  The first time you see and hear this you don't really know what's going on because she starts telling this joke while you still see the chicken puppet.  By the time you understand that it's a girl telling a joke, the joke is half over.  Her question is very difficult to understand.  I had to listen four times to get what she says.  She asks, \\"Why did the Mozart get rid of all his chickens?\\"  Then you hear a squeeky adults voice say, \\"Why?\\"  Aspen then says, \\"Because they kept saying Bach, Bach, Bach.\\"  Then you hear a bunch of adults in the background dying of laughter.  I am sorry but it's lame.  It's very poorly understandable and I don't think any babies or toddlers will even understand this joke.  I don't know why it was included.  At the very end of the video you see Aspen again and she says, \\"The video of me is all done?  I'm not the star anymore?\\" Again, the adults burst into laughter.  Sorry, I didn't find it funny.  I wonder how Baby Einstien got so popular?  Personally the only ones I like are Baby Neptune (water), Baby Galileo (sky) , Baby Newton (shapes), and Numbers Nursery (counting 1 - 5).  I have reviewed these and other Baby Einstein videos as well.
B0007PALZ2|5.0|in case you already have the CE, there is almost NO reason to upgrade to the SE. The only difference is a \\"new transfer\\". No new extras, commentaries, sound, docs, nada. What was wrong with the old transfer? nothing to me...slap a \\"special edition\\" label on it for a marketing gimmick...Weak.<br /><br />still the movie is near perfect and the DVD (CE or SE) is top notch. The documentary is one of the best I've ever seen -- even showing an \\"Alan Smithy\\" moment of doubt, the director's struggle for artistic control vs. the studio, and even a TEST AUDIENCE is shown. you won't see these things on any other DVDs...
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I loved Toxicity from the very first time I heard it and have been waiting for something of the same quality. \\"Steal This Album\\", was good but well disapointing. From The very first song \\"Solider Side\\"(which is one of the best intros Ive heard in a long while) I was blown away this is possible the best System album so far. There is just so many different styles from the screaming madness of \\"Cigaro\\" to the tecno sound of \\"Old School Society\\" it is like electricity straight to your brain. My own personal favorite is \\"Revenga\\". Love or hate System this album is diffently worth a listen and is worth every penny. There is just so much in this album Im almost speechless. Can Not Wait for \\"Hypnotize\\".
B000929AJQ|4.0|I dont believe this record can be compared to any of his others, or you'd have to compare each individual part to a different record, which really means it ISNT like any of his records. As with the [Collected] DVD it seems maybe this is a turning point, a recollection on previous times, it is definately nothing new, but it is a firm mix of what has done before, both by NIN and by hit songs--which by this I mean to say I see it as a more mainstream album, hell and I say good for him, he deserves money for what he does, and what he has made here is art, it's not him just whining about things, and it's not him directly copying formulas, he doesn't try anything new, but he blends them together soo well you can't see the individual fruits of his efforts in this smoothie of a record. Solid, with promise and a new feel to it, this record is worth the money you'll put down on it, which has been quite reasoneable.
0393317552|1.0|I'm a native Japanese. I've read about a third of this book and already found three major mistakes on Japanese culture. I'm not familiar with other cultures that he mentioned in the book, but just have to wonder how accurate they could be. Being a UCLA professor, I assume he could easily confirm the information with the native Japanese people, but he obviously didn't. Since his cultural understanding is so questionable and even childish, I don't think this book is worth reading.   <br />

B0002KVULG|2.0|I think that most people who buy this DVD would have already seen the movie in the theater or on TV and would like to see it as they remember it, with full colour and this colour washout version is generally a let-down for fans of this movie, myself included. I feel this was an error in judgement on Badham's part because when the movie shifts from one scene of moderate colour to the next scene of even weaker colour, this was actually a distraction that draws the viewer out of the movie experience -and that is one the worst things you would want to happen to your movie's audience. How easy it would have been for John Badham to state in the \\"Making Of\\" documentary that he had always  intended to release the movie in muted colour so if the viewer wanted to see the film this way please adjust the colour control on your TV accordingly. Or another option would be to present both versions of the film on the DVD disc as often films are presented in widescreen and fullscreen on the same disc. Please re-release this film as it was originally presented.
B00004RF83|5.0|Seven Days in May has everything going for it - directed by John Frankenheimer from a screenplay by Rod Serling with an all star cast including a number of great character actors such as Edmond O'Brien (D.O.A.), Martin Balsam (12 Angry Men), Whit Bissell (Trial), Hugh Marlowe (Come to the Stable), Richard Anderson (Six Million Dollar Man),  John Houseman (Paper Chase), George Macready (Gilda), Victor Buono (King Tut on Batman), Andrew Duggan, and even Leonard Nimoy (Mr. Spock) in a bit part, all in addition to the stars - Douglas and Lancaster, Fredric March (A Star Is Born) and Ava Gardner.  Douglas plays a Colonel at the Pentagon who finds evidence that his boss, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff (Burt Lancaster), is plotting to overthrow the government.  Concerned that the President's (Fredric March) new treaty with the Soviets has enervated the defense of the USA, Lancaster devised a scheme to kidnap the president during a military alert, and take over the nation's communication systems - primarily the major TV networks. Douglas goes to the president and convinces him to at least look into his suspicions.  You'd think the plot could be easily foiled at this point, but the president's few trusted friends each run into trouble trying to get the proof to stop Lancaster.  If you like movies about national consipiracies, like Twilight's Last Gleaming and The Pelican Brief, or just political thrillers like The Sum of All Fears, Seven Days in May is one of the earliest major examples, along with The Manchurian Candidate.  It's pulled off well, made realistic by the competent actors in every role.
0743482832|5.0|The Folger Shakespeare Library presents the optimal format for reading Shakespeare's single plays.  Each book provides the background and context of the play, a brief description of the theater as Shakespeare would have known it, and a brief bio of the writer himself.  But the most useful feature is the notation on the page facing the text, explaining Shakespeare's usage of words and phrases.  There is a wealth of scholarship embedded in these brief notes.  An experienced reader of Shakespeare may skip them, to maintain the momentum of the play, but even we may tarry to ascertain his ken.<br /><br />The Tempest is the birthplace of \\"there's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple,\\" \\"he receives comfort like cold porridge,\\" \\"what's past is prologue,\\" \\"misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows,\\" \\"Oh, brave new world*,\\" and \\"his complexion is perfect gallows.\\"  It is Shakespeare's farewell to London, and it is imaginative and enlightening.  It is also timeless, often giving rise to contemporary settings in its production.<br /><br />Prospero's supernatural powers, permeating the action of the play, will take an additional effort at the \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" which we always take to the theater.  Yet we are not at all reluctant when, in his epilogue, he boldly asks us to applaud his players.<br /><br />*  This phrase, \\"...brave new world...\\" was penned in 1611, and should not seem so \\"new\\" to our modern ears as it does.
B000002KDG|5.0|I don't know for sure, but I believe this album combines studio recordings and live recordings from the 1978 tour.  If you were to pick \\"Live Rust\\" over this album, you'd miss out on a lot. <br />You'd miss \\"Thrasher,\\" \\"Pocahontas,\\" \\"Ride My Llama\\", and a couple other songs in their entirety.  As for the songs that appear on \\"Live Rust,\\" the version of \\"Sedan Delivery\\" is augmented by weird transporting digital effects, and \\"Powderfinger\\" is the type of song that one should hear done more than once.  It is Young's best electric song and a great song in the American ballad/storytelling tradition.  And you don't want to miss out on those weird electrified synthetic clap effects on \\"Welfare Mothers\\".  They make you feel like you are in a Mad Max era rock concert. <br /> <br />It seems that Rust Never Sleeps is Neil's studio statement from that time, whereas \\"Live Rust\\" is just a (great) document of the live show he was doing.
B0007Z4S4C|4.0|The lyrics are almost as deep as the wrinkles on Plant's face.  His voice still resonates, but it sounds a bit tired and raspy.  With Dreamland, Plant mellowed, seemingly as a conscious decision; with Mighty Rearranger, it's evident he just doesn't have the energy to perform like he did in his 70s, 80s, even 90s prime.  I don't think he could do Fate of Nations, let alone Led Zep, convincingly anymore.  I have a feeling this will be his final studio album.  There aren't any songs on it that make me want to sing in celebration or dance on my own.  Everything on it is just so-so.  I don't really like the band much; the lyrics are too scattered and ponderous; but Plant's voice still shines through enough, even for nostaliga's sake, for a 4-star rating.  It's sad that rock stars have to age, but legacies never die.  Carry on my wayward one.
1573228737|5.0|I was expecting this novel to be like her first, Tipping the Velvet, but it was nothing like it.  However, it was just as good, if not better.  Affinity is a gothic tale of a 'spinster,' Margaret, that visits female prisoners.   <br /> <br />Margaret went through a depression after her father passed away a couple years ago.  She decides to spend time with the female prisoners on weekly basis in order to get herself out of the house and improve her mood.  She finds a mysterious prisoner, Selina, there and begins visiting her every week.  Selina is a spirit-medium and slowly begins opening up to Margaret.  I'd say more, but I don't want to spoil it. <br /> <br />Waters has created a story that weaves the reader in, out and around and leaves them at the edge of their seats until the last couple pages.  I highly recommend this book to anyone that enjoys edge-of-your-seat gothic suspense.  To everyone else, I still recommend it.
B00005JKG9|4.0|The other day I was discussing salespeople with a friend and we determined that nobody likes being sold anything. Coincidental, then, that I saw Glengarry Glen Ross that night, as the film seems to support our hypothesis, but it adds another dimension to it: the salespeople themselves may not necessarily even like selling anything. In fact, the men in this movie are selling for survival; if they don't sell, they don't eat. <br /> <br />Near the beginning of the film, a man from the downtown office (Alec Baldwin) offers encouragement to three salesmen who aren't meeting their quotas by way of verbal abuse. First prize is a brand new Cadillac, second prize is a set of steak knives, and third prize is the door: you're fired. The men are selling real estate, using the weak leads handed down to them from above. There is Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon), nicknamed The Machine for his past sales record, who has hit a wall in his career and can't seem to close any more sales. He desperately needs to keep his job to pay medical bills for his wife. Dave Moss (Ed Harris) is fed up with all of the bureaucracy, and doesn't feel people should be treated this way--and they shouldn't. George Aaronow (Alan Arkin) isn't the sharpest tool in the drawer, and tends to be swayed by his colleagues. <br /> <br />All three of these men are jealous of the only guy making any sales lately, Ricky Roma (Al Pacino). Dave is convinced that the rest of them would be doing just as well if they were getting the good leads that he is, but according to their by-the-book company-pleasing manager John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), only closers are worthy of the good leads--the Glengarry leads. Dave comes up with a plan to break into the office, steal the leads, and sell them to the competitor across the street, and tries to convince George to do the dirty work, and as a reward, he can take a cut of the pay and have a job with the competitor. We don't see the actual robbery, though--only the aftermath--and it'snot clear who exactly did what. Everyone's got their motives, but who had the guts to do it? <br /> <br />Glengarry Glen Ross was written by David Mamet based on his stage play of the same name, and it must have been an actor's paradise. There are no special effects, hardly any sets at all, and some fantastic dialogue, which flows with the cadence that only Mamet can produce. Nobody else can write profanity with such poetry. Director James Foley doesn't intrude on his actors, which is the perfect way to deal with this talk-heavy picture. The acting is excellent all around, especially by screen legend Jack Lemmon, though nobody is overshadowed by anybody else. <br /> <br />The only fault I found with the film was the abrupt ending, but to go into any more detail would be a crime against anybody who hasn't seen the film. The subject matter is fascinating, as most of us have only seen salesmen when they're being phonies. Here they are given personalities, and are struggling with not only their jobs, but with their lives, and they live in such a sheltered world that they can't even see the opportunities that might be available outside of this bubble. It's a really foolish idea to steal from the place you have to go to every day, but if you don't know any better, it makes perfect sense.
0385510454|2.0|Okay so I thought I was purchasing an intense thriller about a man who is given a second chance with a presidential pardon and then finds himself running from the most dangerous hitmen in the world. Boy was I surprised when the story consisted of Joel Blackman walking around and enjoying the citys of Italy and learning the language.  <br /> <br />John Grisham does a good job in developing the character of Joel Blackman, but when it comes to plot this novel has nothing. Grisham takes a chapter to describe hitmen that you expect will be trying to kill Blackman, but these hitmen don't even come into the story.  <br /> <br />The ending was kind of lame, too. Grisham leaves you with the plot only somewhat resolved.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I have always loved Mariah...but honestly I haven't LOVED an album from her since Vision of Love. This cd, has so much soul and purpose. It's like she started from the beginning with the basics. Beautiful music and flawless voice. Her music reminds me of the old scool r&b that I grew up on. I have gotten other cds this year and Mariah's is the best so far. You can play this cd without skipping songs...You can tell she put her heart in this one.
B0006J28BO|5.0|The Cat Returns is an extremely enjoyable film. It's as simple as that. I picked up this movie about two years ago, after reading a brief synopsis: A girl is magically transported into the world of cats after saving the live of the Cat Prince. Because it was done by Studio Ghibli, and I am an avid fan with a current collection of 13 of their movies, I was eager to see this. Not to mention I adore cats.  <br /> <br />I was delightfully surprised by how wonderful it was. It's not deep and spiritual like Princess Mononoke or Spirited Away (I seem to be one of the only ones who is not a fan of this particular movie). Instead, it sets out to bring you a light, charming tale of Haru and her cats.  <br /> <br />The Cat Returns is perfect for that hour and a half you have of free time. It is fun to watch and I can bet the smile doesn't stray from your face for too long. For the director's first movie, it's wonderfully done. The art is crisp, plenty of memorable characters light up the screen, and the music and ending theme made me buy the soundtrack.  <br /> <br />For feline lovers and anyone who likes to watch a fun movie where people's heads don't get blown off every other shot, you should pick up this magical film and watch it with those you love.  <br /> <br />(Please note that this review is based on the original Japanese with English subtitles.)
B00007JVBI|5.0|I've really come to love this album, though I'll confess it was slow to grow on me.  For once thing, if you are in the mood for something upbeat and energetic, this isn't going to be your album.  It is quiet, somber, reflective, minimalistic.  There are albums that have gripped me on a first hearing, but more often than not they tend to fade in appeal as time goes by.  This is a \\"difficult\\" album, but once you penetrate the apparent lack of diversity and instead the come to appreciate the subtle variations from one song to another, it can possess at a far deeper level than more accessible but ultimately more superficial ones.<br /><br />This is music stripped down to essentials.  I have been alternatively listening to this and a superb Teenage Fan Club album, and while I love both, the differences between the two couldn't be starker.  Teenage Fan Club hates empty space, to the extent of layering sound upon sound to produce a many layered, astonishingly dense result.  Chan Marshall, the artist who is Cat Power, not only is comfortable with silence within the music, she seems to quietly cultivate it.  Her songs are filled with spaces, and adds in new strands of sound only hesitatingly.  If a piano, a single guitar, and a backing vocal get the job done, why add in drums or bass?  Or even get rid of the guitar or piano.  The only way for the album to get any sparser would be for Marshall to sing the whole thing a capella. The effect of all this is to focus all the attention on the lyrics and the emotions Marshall is evoking.  The result sometimes feels almost more like confessional therapy than music, an attempt to put raw emotional experience into a form in which it can be confronted and absorbed.<br /><br />I couldn't recommend this album more strongly for listeners who are patient and comfortable with subtle music that reveals its treasures only slowly.
B000063DFN|5.0|When I was in high school, a friend and I used to jam out in his basement.  I'd play guitar or bass, and he'd play guitar, bass, or drums.  Everytime we jammed, there were *3* songs we always played to warm up - 'The Trooper' (off PIECE OF MIND) and 'Aces High' and '2 Minutes to Midnight' both from POWERSLAVE.  I can play all those songs on the guitar in my sleep and we never got sick of playing them! <br /> <br />This is easily the strongest Maiden release.  It also has my favorite Iron Maiden song - 'Powerslave'.  There's one moment in that song where there's an instrumental section in four parts.  The first part consists of a guitar picking through chords, another guitar playing a soft sustained lead as well as amazing bass playing where Steve Harris does some great harmonizing.  After that, Adrian Smith solos, then there's a wild guitar harmony part and then it ends with a Dave Murray solo.  I think of that musical boundary everytime I *think* of Iron Maiden.  You won't skip over any of the tracks on this album.  The ensuing world tour for POWERSLAVE produced some great concerts as well, and you can also purchase a 2-disc set called 'Live After Death' from that tour.  You get a bunch of songs from this disc plus material from all four previous records. <br /> <br />We are also given some other great songs like Bruce Dickinson's 'Flash of the Blade,' and Steve Harris's 'The Duellists' which also has some great layered guitar work on it.  We are also given the longest Iron Maiden song, 'Rime of the Ancient Mariner' clocking in at 13:00.  This song is all over the map, going from guitar harmonies to solos to a soft part where parts of the actual poem are read. <br /> <br />I also like the addition of Winston Churchill's speech in the beginning of 'Aces High' - as an American I feel this gives the music a certain type of British Nationalism - it adds character to the listener's perception of the music.
0393035158|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It does seem odd that the subject of this book has neatly evaded if not completely removed itself from the target of debate, discussion, or criticism. Why should that be? Harris brings up so many concrete and obvious examples of how religion (all religions) fail to stand up to their creeds. Even if they do, why should religion exist at all when even the most casual examination reveals how much damage and destruction has been and is being done in the name of various beliefs? It's time to hold religion up to immediate objective criticism in order to advance our future without being destroyed by the bondage of the past.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is album is good! Its not as heavy as previous albums, but the songs are hilarious, and they just flow so well. Just a creative album... my only complaint, the songs are so short!<br /><br />Dont look for a lot of hits off this album though... doesnt really haev any serious songs. But are their songs ever serious?
B00092ZMDY|5.0|These guys just keep getting better with age. This is a must for all Eagles fans. All I can say is: \\"Just buy it\\". You will not be dissapointed. The band brought out their own recording crew with them. The quality will be fantastic.
B00005JLEU|1.0|After hearing a lot of hype about this from the media and friends alike, another friend and I drove the hour and a half trip to see this movie in a packed theater.<br /><br />I knew only the very basic plot and the beginning started innocently enough. About twenty minutes in I started going \\"Huh?\\"<br /><br />As I've been studying Japanese for about three years, I am no stranger to their culture. There were several references I did get, though the rest could have been lost in translation with the pathetic dub. I haven't wanted to find a non-Disney subtitled version and see if it's actually as good as some people think.<br /><br />The story jumped erratically, and before you could understand the names of most of the supporting cast you were in a completely different scene. If they were reintroduced (and a lot weren't) you were left thinking, \\"Oh, right, that's that girl...What's her name again?\\"<br /><br />It was an unmemorable experience and I found myself wishing for a watch to check the time. The rest of the audience seemed as glazed over as I did. I don't remember any particular parts where I or anyone eles laughed out loud and the only time that I think made me smile was that I could translate some of their names. (Even with the horrible accents. Lynn is certainly not the way you pronounce it!) I knew the money I paid for my classes was actually paying off.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this, then great. More power to you. But if you want something enjoyable to watch, I urge you to find other Ghibli/Miyazaki films. For kids, Kiki's Delivery Service or The Cat Returns is fun, and if you do want deeper films you need turn no further than Nausicaa, Princess Mononoke or Grave of Fireflies.
B000929AJQ|4.0|This album was very anticipated, it was very dissapointing on the sound clip listen, but when I got it home and gave it 6-10 whirls I really enjoyed it.  The soundclips sucked so don't even bother, they do the songs no justice.  The album is like a mixture of all the previous albums, some of the raw techno feel of Pretty Hate Machine, the all out guitar crush of Broken (still the best album), the textures of Downward Spiral, and the effects and processing of Fragile.  It is pretty cool, as you listen and think this should have been on that album.  A nice collection of songs, a bit of a voacl challenge fro Trent too.  He really expands his range.  I won't comment on songs as we all think of them differently, but I thought there were 4 or 5 standouts for sure.  Worth the price, pick it up and listen listen listen, you won't regret it if you like NIN.
B00079FUI6|5.0|After last year's finale of \\"Sex and the City\\" I thought there would never be another groundbreaking women's comedy again,but I was wrong! This is great! And to you people that think this show is bad don't watch it, but the normal people out here who do watch it cause it's a great show! Thank you Marc Cherry!
B000002N25|5.0|This album is great for the hard rockin' riff song Imelda which <br />is one of my favorite MK songs by Coyote from TRD, & What It Is <br />from STP. It is a classic and is way better than Freebird or Stairway to Heaven. Other than that this album is not too good. <br />Here's a list of the best rock songs by DS & MK. <br /> <br />    HEAVY FUEL <br />    TELEGRAPH ROAD <br />    IMELDA <br />    MONEY FOR NOTHING <br />    TUNNEL OF LOVE <br />    SKATEAWAY <br />    SULTANS <br />    THE HARD ROCKIN' WALK OF LIFE FROM ON THE NIGHT <br />    MY PARTIES <br />    THE BUG  <br />    THE DESERT SONG COYOTE <br /> <br />Be sure to check this album out and don't listen to anything but <br />Imelda. Be sure to buy STP, TRD, LOG, OES, MM, OTN, & SOS-TVBODS <br />in addition to it. And Dire Straits will always be the best band <br />of all time ever!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|It's been four years since \\"Toxicity\\", the last real album of System of a Down. SOAD already proved with their previous cd's that nu-metal doesn't have to be bland, immature, predictable and unoriginal music (altough I'm not sure wether SOAD should even be classified as \\"nu-metal\\"). And with this album, they prove it again.  <br /> <br />Let's first get a few things straight. This is not \\"Toxicity pt. 2\\". Anyone hoping so will be disappointed. First of all, SOAD moves even futher away from the nu-metal genre. There's a lot of influence from classic metal and thrash metal on this album. Korn-like \\"chugga-chugga\\" riffs are mostly trown out of the window. Just listen to the opening riffs of \\"Revenga\\", \\"BOYB\\" or \\"Sad Statue\\" and you'll hear what I mean.  <br />Next to that, the screaming has been toned down a lot. This album is a lot more melodic and contains a lot of harmonizing between Serj (vocals) and Daron (guitar/backing vocals). And then there's a whole range of influences besides metal, ranging from folk to jazz to techno (!). <br /> <br />I guess these changes might upset some of the fans, but System doesn't lose it's signature sound at all. The album still is full of chaos, fast and furious guitarrifs, crazy unpredictable breaks, bizarre humor, tempo shifts and more without losing it's catchyness.  <br /> <br />All these elements result in a great album full of variation and great, solid songs. If there's one downside, it would be the lenght of the record. It's only 37 minutes, which is a bit short. But don't let that stop you from buying this! <br /> <br />Stand out tracks: BOYB, Revenga, Sad Statue, Radio/video, Lost in Hollywood. <br /> <br />
B00079FUI6|5.0|This show hits us all right at home. I love it....Its about women everywhere its the kinda show that your like yeah thats Sally down the block. Though it does have sexual  relations in it You don't actually see anything. So yes there is a difference between this show and Sex and The City. This show is witty and always keeps you on your toes. Like I said its real. Yes, women have problems raising their kids, yes, some of us get rotten kids, Yes some of us have great husbands and others not so great. Some of us quit are high paying job to raise children and some of us our out trying hard to find that one man that is for us and run into a bunch of worng men on the way. That is why I like this show so much. It is real....
0385513755|4.0|I wrote that dedication bit with a rose between my teeth. I'll preface by saying I read Angels and Demons when it was an airport paperpack (literally bought it in a terminal) on the rack next to all the Fabio-esque romance novels. I enjoyed that book when I read it.<br /><br />Little did I know that Dan Brown would turn into this, I'd forgotten about him until an International Marketing professor brought up how he just finished the \\"DaVinci Code\\" by Dan Brown. \\"Dan Brown, Dan Brown,\\" I said to myself, \\"Where in hell do I know that name? Oh yeah, I read 'Angels & Demons' couple years back.\\" The professor chirped on about this \\"amazing author\\", his words.<br /><br />I wouldn't call Dan Brown amazing, though, not in every area of literature. Needless to say, I procrastinated in picking up \\"The DaVinci Code\\" because I guess I was being a little snobby. But I eventually did pick up the book. I wouldn't call Dan Brown amazing because he could work on trite dialogue and cookie-cutter character mannerisms. \\"The Davinci Code\\" reads very much plot-wise as \\"Angels & Demons\\".<br /><br />Plot is not what made \\"The DaVinci Code\\" such a critical success. The consiracy aspect of the book coupled with arguments backing the premise are what make it critically acclaimed. Detail of setting and scene, a writing that has the reader hiding in the shadows of the Louvre or running out of breath with Langdon \\"to the next\\" cathedral. Impeccable foriegn city description puts YOU THERE. This is what made \\"The DaVinci Code\\" such a success.<br /><br />I loved reading about the conspiracies presented in this book. It doesn't matter how much flak is fired in retort to the novelist. In fact, those fools miss marginally. \\"The DaVinci Code\\" begs the reader to open HER eyes and question things and not be ignorant. A novel such as this BEGS the reader to do research on HER own. I began viewing women in a reverant light after I read this book.<br /><br />Perhaps Dan Brown has an Oedipus complex and I hadn't had one before I read his book, but the idea of the feminine divine, regardless of religion, creed, institution, beaurocracy, government, is a wonderful concept that has been exposed by the book. Can you deny the beauty of a flower? This is the heart of \\"The DiVinci Code\\".<br /><br />Don't expect \\"best ever\\" characters or unfolding events. They are not on these pages. It's a controversial book just as valid as its nit-picking retorts.<br /><br />I really recommend it to anyone who hasn't read it yet. YES! That means the both of you!<br /><br />Now I'll put that rose back between my teeth and shut up.x and I hadn't had one before I read his book, but the idea of the feminine divine, regardless of religion, creed, institution, beaurocracy, government, is a wonderful concept that has been exposed by the book.

B00026WU3M|2.0|Like many older fans of Bob Dylan, I missed this album when it was first released but looked for it in record stores and ultimately ordered it from Amazon after reading \\"Chronicles.\\"  I regret wasting the money: it may be his worst album (a distinction previously held in my mind for over 30 years by \\"Planet Waves\\").<br /><br />After reading \\"Chronicles\\" and seeing Dylan in concert recently I have finally discovered \\"Shot of Love\\" and \\"Love and Theft\\", two albums released 20 years apart that happen to bracket \\"Oh Mercy\\" chronologically.  I've enjoyed both of these immensely, so I don't think the problem I have with \\"Oh Mercy\\" is that I've gotten too old to listen to music that is new to my ears.<br /><br />I find \\"Oh Mercy\\" to be uninspired and flaccid both musically and lyrically.  I'll probably reread the parts of \\"Chronicles\\" that dealt with the production of this album.  I suspect the reason Dylan wrote so much about it was that he was trying to come to grips with a failure.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|The creators of South Park Trey Parker and Matt Stone made a film that is an odd theme to it: serious action and romance but it involves puppets with very visible strings. So of course it ends up becoming funny on that basis and on another basis due to the film itself. Some parts maybe aren't as funny but more often than that it hits its mark. <br /> <br />There's Middle Eastern terrorists in Paris and Team America, a force assigned to protect America although maybe not officially comes to the rescue. Only they end up causing more damage than the terrorists do and they lose one of their members. It's believed that Kim Jong Il, North Korea's dictator is going to strike but they don't know where. <br /> <br />So they hire Gary, a Broadway actor who's starring in Lease, a spoof of Rent(with its big closer \\"Everyone Has AIDS\\"). They hire him to infiltrate terrorist headquarters and find out their plans.  <br /> <br />As for the film's famous puppet sex scene, it's funny looking at it cause it looks funny but there's 2 sex shots that kind of ruins it and turns it from being funny to just weird and gross. It's funny that people got so riled up about it since the puppets don't even have \\"parts\\" besides the woman who's got breasts. It's more of the implied nature of the position/sex act which riles up people. Maybe you've done something they've done, who knows. <br /> <br />The violence is slightly over the top, only cause you're looking at puppets. One puppet gets the top half of his head kicked off while panthers(they're actually real live cats) starts snacking on a puppet's neck and taking the head with it.  <br /> <br />One great aspect of the film is the songs. It's got characters singing them or just part of the soundtrack but you got the aforementioned \\"Everyone Has AIDS\\", the Team America theme \\"America(F*** Yeah!)\\" and Kim Jong Il's ballad \\"So Ronely\\". He doesn't really pronounce words clearly so that's actually lonely or when he says Arec Ballwin instead of Alec Baldwin. <br /> <br />Like the title says, there's humor here that is so blatantly offensive you'd be shocked yet you'd laugh with everyone else and be like \\"hey wait a minute that's offensive! &lt;another funny scene, you laugh> why did I laugh at that again? Isn't it gross?\\"
B0007OCG4W|4.0|Julia Roberts, Natalie Portman, Jude Law, and Clive Owen star in this seductive and sometimes trashy thriller about lies, deceit, and hurting the one you love.  Roberts stars as Anna, a portrait photographer who takes pictures of strangers.  Portman stars as Alice, a stripper/waitress who has just arrived in London after a failed relationship.  Law stars as Dan, an obituary writer who has dreams of becoming a successful novelist, and Owen stars as Larry, a dermatologist who is addicted to internet chat rooms. <br /> <br />Dan meets Alice after she's hit by a taxi.  He takes her to the hospital and, after a while, a relationship forms, and Dan has begun work on his novel.  However, Dan also becomes involved with Anna (unknown to Alice).   <br /> <br />Larry is drawn in by Dan, who is posing as a woman on one of the chat rooms that Larry frequents.  Dan explains that his name is Anna and she wants to meet him.  Larry is given directions to Anna's photography gallery, where, after a brief amount of explaining, Larry and Anna form a relationship of their own and wind up getting married. <br /> <br />Eventually, all four become intertwined with each other in a deceitful web of lies and mistrust. <br /> <br />The characters do an excellent job of portraying the kind of relationship one hopes they never have; one based on lies and mistruths.  If you can stand the overabundance of very foul language, then you should enjoy this film.  The acting, especially by Natalie Portman, is very good, and Portman's portrayal of Alice is the highlight of the movie.  You'll also learn what you shouldn't do in a relationship: lie and cheat on the one you care about.
B00003CX8V|5.0|I read the \\"Reel.com's critic Sarah Chauncey's review of this movie and I think she watched it with her eyes and ears closed. I don't know how old Sarah is, or maybe it's just sad that a younger audience dosen't appreciate gentle and sweet anymore.  I saw this movie many years ago and I feel it has stood the test of time.  What's changed in an office setting?  Not much really. A few more woman have gotten executive positions, but it's still a man's world.  What have woman really gotten from \\"woman's lib\\"?  We do more work now than we ever did, we're exausted, our children aren't being raised by us anymore and are suffering dearly for it.  Jack Lemmon was one of our best actors, Shirley MacLane is still wonderful, take a look at this movie I think you'll like it.
B000929AJQ|5.0|Spend the few extra dollars on the dualdisc version that has the album in 5.1 surround.  It is definitely worth it.  If you don't have a 5.1 surround system, go find someone that does have one because you are missing out listening to this album in stereo.  There's nothing like having \\"With Teeth\\" surround you in five blazing channels.
B000286RNY|5.0|I have been going ape shizzy over this hilarious new half hour tv show that I have been recording off of that new tv network made for Asian Americans called \\"AZN\\"( get it?), because the episodes fit perfectly onto my PSP. <br /> <br />I am not sure if everyone can get this channel, but you can hunt it down through the tv channel guide at yahoo, or go to their website at azntv.com, but anyway... <br /> <br />When I showed my friend the \\"Kung Faux\\" episodes, she recommended that I check out the \\"shaolin Soccer\\" dvd, which I just picked up and I have to say that now I am in heaven because Amazon recommended that I also buy the uncensored version of the \\"Kung Faux\\" dvd that I didn't even know was out, which I also did and now I am hooked. <br /> <br />These two dvds have been the best money that I have spent in years! I have watched them both a thousand times and still laugh every time I watch them, now I am back to order more Steven Chow dvds and I can't wait for more uncensored versions of the \\"Kung Faux\\" dvds to come out because these guys can't be beat.  <br /> <br />You can not go wrong with these titles. They are like some kind of Ancient Chinese Secret medicine or something the way they make  me feel after every time I watch them. Dang they are good !!!
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|this album is awful. i sold it an hour after i bought it. there are two good songs on the album and the radio stations have already shoved them down our necks. save your money go buy a clutch album.
B000002UAX|5.0|i love this album, and about a year ago, i hated the Beatles and didn't know this particular album even existed. I told one of my friends how i thought they were just a stupid sixties pop group, and he told me that the early stuff they did was just that, stupid pop, but that the later stuff, such as Srg. Peppers, The White Album, and Abbey Road, was not. He by some chance had gotten the white album on vinyl from a relative and i gave a listen, and i was so surprised. I thought to myself, wow, this is actually music, not just crap. to this day i still don't like their voices, but i have to say that songs like Happiness Is A Warm Gun, Rocky Raccoon, Julia, Helter Skelter, Revolution, Blackbird, and almost every single song out of Abbey Road, have changed my idea of the Beatles and changed me. Now i like the Beatles a lot, and think that they have written some of the best songs of all time. Its like their a standard. I've never met someone who has never liked at least a couple of classic Beatles songs. but i advise to go for their last four or so albums, because i still think that their early stuff (before Srg. Peppers) is just crappy early sixties pop. I advise to listen to and love The White Album, Abbey Road, Srg. Peppers, Let it Be, and Magical Mystery Tour, because those albums really are apart of the best music of the sixties, and some of the most well written music of all time. I personally suggest the White Album, if your new to these guys.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is probably my favorite album of 2005 so far.  System of a Down has always been a very awsome band.  With there unique sound, protesting lyrics, heavy riffs, and some funny stuff, they are one of the best bands of today.  And this album is no exception.  It starts off with the intro, Soldier Side, a slower kind of moody peace and transferrs my personal favorite track, BYOB.  From there, it is just a roller coster ride of insanity.  I say, if you are a system of a down fan, you should definatly have this album
B000089CJI|5.0|Is there anything one can possibly say to justify such an amazing CD?  This CD is just utterly perfect in every facet of its being.  The songs are brilliant and poetic.  The music is electric and eclectic.  The songs will get stuck in your head time and time again.  It's gorgeous in every way.  If you don't own this CD, I don't know how you possibly consider yourself complete!
B0000028VT|2.0|First of all, I want to know why \\"Everything Fades Away\\" was not put on this album.  If I'm not mistaken, this song was released as the B-side to \\"Hero\\", and  it's better than almost anything else on here.  I just happened to stumble across a copy of it on the internet a couple of years ago when I just happened to be searching around for non-album songs by various artists.  It is a slow, powerful, ethereal number that is definitely worth seeking out if you can get your hands on a copy.  Anyway, on to my \\"Music Box\\" review... This album is an OK effort by Mariah.  It has its strengths, the main one being Mariah's gorgeous voice throughout.  The biggest problem that I see with this album though is that most of the arrangements just seem extremely unimaginative and uninspired.  One exception to this is the gorgeous title track, but as pleasant as it is, even it still suffers from some of the same general problems that plague this release.  This album somehow manages to be bland yet at the same time overdramatic.  As trite as her themes and content can often be, when Mariah is \\"on\\", her music can have a certain powerful, intimate beauty that makes it all worth it, but when she's not, it can end up just being bland and nondescript. That's exactly what most of the arrangements and production are on this album.  It's the main reason this album just sounds generally lifeless and listless overall.  But, there are still a few pretty strong compositions on here such as \\"Anytime You Need a Friend\\" and \\"Music Box\\".  The first four songs are generally pretty solid, even the saccharine soaked (which I guess you can say about much of this album, and heck--about *much* of Mariah's catalog) \\"Hero\\" is a decent song, its just that it sounds so cliche and overplayed to me that I can't bare to listen to it anymore.  One really positive thing that I can say about this album is that it does a particularly good job of showcasing Mariah's voice, and if you are a fan, then it is worth pickingup for that reason alone.  Overall, the problem with this listless album is that much of the material itself is just downright insubstantial.  It is very pleasant but at times you may forget that the album is even on. The only REALLY bad song on here though is the absolutely horrendous \\"Without You\\".  As if the original wasn't god awful enough, she had to go and make a cover that's even worse.  This album is pretty much for completists and dedicated fans only.
B0006399FS|2.0|I believe that u2 was one of the greatest rock bands of our time, not because they were Irish clovers but because they displayed true talent, and Bono's voice is very spirited and will always be however this album sucks. I enjoy old U2, when they first hit the fast paced mainstream universe they were very different and I liked what I heard. Now all I hear is this 'Vertigo' stuff and I think Bono has become like all the other pop stars in this world, money tree people! Maybe the next U2 album will be better than this one, how to dismantle an atomic waste of your money.
B000929AJQ|1.0|I am a die-hard NIN fan and have never heard a NIN album I didn't love... until now. I was so excited about the new album that when I bought it I had to race home to listen to it. As each track went by, my frown got deeper and deeper. There are maybe two semi-decent songs on this album that even deserve to be placed under the NIN name. The lyrics seem generic and uninspired. It was as if Trent found as many one to two syllable sad words he could find and threw them together. The feeling and emotion don't seem genuine. The background music is good for the most part, but not near as good as it has been on the previous albums. I had so much hope for this album. NIN was always one of the few bands that when they put out an album (no matter how long you waited), you knew it was going to be amazing and worth the wait and the money. I am taking this album to a CD store to sell it tomorrow. I am saddened by this album and it seems that this is the end of what was once one of the best bands ever.
B000002UY5|5.0|There's only one type of listeners this album could put off. That is, the ones that listened to the hits, and came looking for more Rain. <br /> <br />Well guess what. Blind Melon was one of the most original bands of the nineties, blending hard rock, funk, folk and 60's psychedelia. So you'll get much more than No Rain. <br />  <br />The only difference between people who wrote 4-5 stars reviews, and the people who wrote 1 star reviews is that the fist ones took the time to actually listen to the music. <br /> <br />Just give it a try. Really good music. <br />

B00003CXMG|5.0|As a writer I've come along way, and I know how difficult it can be working on a subject that is as dangerous as Rock and Roll, and learning how music is life and love. This film was great, I took a dull Sunday afternoon to watch this movie and I was entertained.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I really think this album is as good as anything SOAD has put out to date. I love the new sound they have on this album. They have advanced musically for sure. Every song start to finish is great.. thats all, short and sweet..can't wait for Hypnotize in the fall!
B000000WJZ|5.0|a masterpiece by the worlds best band. i like the whole cd, go on and get it
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Since toxicity in 2001, SOAD have been a bit quiet on the metal scene.  They are back.  Mezmerize is absolutely amazing.  If there is one album that you should buy this year, then this is it. Steal this album was a bit of a let down after toxicity, but then you would expect that from an album full of B-sides. Before I got this CD, I was expecting 4-5 good songs, and the rest fillers, but I was wrong. It is a 40 minute trip that explores music in ways that most other bands can't. Mezmerize is hard hitting, enjoyable, and an album that you can live inside for months. A definite must buy. Some recommended songs are B.Y.O.B, Radio/Video, Quesion and lost in Hollywood. Once you have heard these, you wont be able to wait for their next album later this year!
0671027344|5.0|This book has been out for several years yet I always thought it was adult fiction and not geared towards teens.  I should have known since it was published by MTV.   <br /> <br />The story is told through Charlie who tells us about his freshman year in series of letters written to an anonymous friend.  Through these letters, he speaks frankly of his social situation in the school an outcast or even a loner. <br />He has a close relationship with his English professor who realizes Charlie's intelligence by giving him books to read that are not required reading.  He also develops a friendship with two seniors who dramatically change Charlie's life and vice versa.   <br /> <br />What is most endearing about this book is the honesty that Charlie speaks with.  It is almost too honest so that the reader knows that something is not right with Charlie which we eventually find out in the end.
B000929AJQ|5.0|On first listening, I too thought Trent Reznor had lost his edge and bowed to, for lack of a better term, \\"God Money.\\"  After several more listenings, I realized that the traditionality is merely a veneer.  \\"With Teeth\\" is an exercise in perverting prototypes as unique as any of NIN's prior works, and is not a departure from the musical values that have made past albums great.  For example: the rhythm of the vocals is often just a little bit off the expected (see \\"Only\\"); what the gods of genre dictate should be sweet songs always have a razor current underneath the gentleness (see \\"All the Love in the World\\"); he even gives his own expansive laments a twist (\\"Beside You in Time\\").  Some songs ditch the veneer of tradition entirely.  The final track, \\"Right Where it Belongs\\", might be described as \\"Electroshock Blues\\"-era Eels crossed with \\"Hurt\\" ... sorta kinda.  The song \\"With Teeth\\" might have a hint of drudgecore ... sorta kinda.  You get the picture. <br /> <br />\\"With Teeth\\" may not have the synth-y accessibility of \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\", the rage of \\"Broken\\", the grit and gravel of \\"The Downward Spiral\\", or the complexity and sweeping scope of \\"The Fragile\\", but it is a worthy successor to those albums.  And, might I add, it's a lot more fun to listen to.  I was perfectly content to let the album loop for six hours.  In fact, when I realized that I'd spent the last week listening to nothing else, it was a struggle to break myself free of its clutches.  Only \\"The Fragile\\" and \\"Joshua Tree\\" have ever put me in such a state. <br /> <br />And for those that complain about Trent not sounding like he's on the brink of homicide, suicide, or both: so what?  Aside from the human factor and a vast increase in productivity (we may see another NIN album next year, not next decade), and aside from the unique flavor the somewhat-cheeriness lends, Trent is just as compelling wistful, contemplative, and irritated as he was when he was a shrieking demon or despairing sinner.If he ever reaches beaming, grinning joyful, I'll bet he'll be compelling there, too, and THAT, my angry friends, would TRULY be unique.

B00001OH7Y|5.0|Scary Monsters has a special place in my heart. <br /> <br />The (then) latest in recording technology really caught up to Bowie's bizarre visions.  He presents us with some truly strange soundscapes that evoke, among other things, isolation (Ashes to Ashes), cheeky ire (Fashion), and paranoia (It's No Game Part 1). <br /> <br />An epic, multitextural album.
0064407667|5.0|If you have begun to read this review then it is not too late to scroll down, or go play a funny game on the net, or pick up a book about happy go lucky children.<br /><br />For the book I review, Lemony Snicket's Seies of Unfortunate Events\\": 'The Bad Begining' is neither funny or happy or lucky.  This is a case account of the Baudelaire children:  Violet the ingenious inventer.  Klaus the scholarly reader.  And Sunny the baby who likes to bite things.  The account tells of the tragic demise of their parents who died in a fire which burned down their home.  And that's just chapter one.  Follow them as they try to escape the clutches of Count Olaf who wants their fortune left by their parents.  He will take this at any risk or cost.  A strange comic assassin with a tattoo on his ankle in the shape of an eye.  Count Olaf is truly a hateful person and should not have been put in charge of these orphans.<br /><br />This volume of the series deals with mysterious fires, loss of life, secrets about a strange symbol, a deadly money hungry guardian, italian dinner, a misguided Judge, and a grappling hook.<br /><br />Snicket has dedicated himself to tell the true story of the Baudelaire children.  But of course you have the option to never read this book which some people have called \\"mysterious\\", \\"enthralling\\" and a \\"outright lie\\".
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|If you loved their first three albums, go ahead and buy this one as well.<br /><br />It's refreshing to be reminded that some people can still think freely.<br /><br />PS You can disregard reviews from Idaho and Utah, unless the opinion of the severely misinformed, miseducated, ignorant, homogenized actually matter to you. If so, skip this album along with anything published after 1605 or in the \\"Index of Prohibited Books.\\" I'm pretty sure Rachmaninoff scares them as well, so why wouldn't System of a Down.
B00005JMCT|3.0|American Wedding is a hilarious movie, and offers a fun conclusion to the American Pie series. It ranks pretty close to the first one, and is much better than the second one, which was decent but felt really rehashed.<br /><br />The cast has been slimmed down, dropping the characters that really didn't do much in number two. Newcomer January Jones fits in well as Alyson Hannigan's sister, and Eric Allen Kramer is hilarious as \\"Bear.\\" The requisite gross-out gags from the first two movies have returned, as well as the obligatory nudity scene halfway in the flick, this time in the form of strippers at a bachelor party. However, American Wedding also manages some inspired non-gross jokes, such as a dance off where Seann William Scott gets to cut loose. There is also a nice role-reversal between Scott and Eddie Kaye Thomas that ends in some subtle character development for Stifler. Overall, these are the jokes that really carry the movie, and it might've been nice to see them rely less on gross-out humour this time around.<br /><br />The dvd comes with some decent bonus features, including commentary, deleted scenes, outtakes, etc. If you can stand the gross humour the series is known for, American Wedding is worth viewing.
B00001OH7X|4.0|Bowie returns to melody and narrative for this funky excursion into exotic musical forms. <br /> <br />Many of the songs describe wanderers--perhaps a metaphor for Bowie's philosophical wanderings?
B0007OCG4W|1.0|I have never in my life seen such a piece of garbage parading around as important cinema!  The dialogue could have been written by a 10 year old for all of the depth the script contains.  The issue is not the sexual content or swear words, it's that the movie has no soul, no irony, no layering, and essentially, no point at all.  Even worse, it is very self-important, and tries to portray all of this meaningless as some sort of \\"depth.\\"  Ha!  There is not a single iota of meaning or character to be found anywhere in Closer.  Just actors staring deep into the camera trying to look, well, \\"deep.\\"<br /><br />One has to wonder just how much Jude Law, Natalie Portman, and Julia Roberts were paid to appear in this rotten tomato.<br /><br />This is easily the worst movie I have ever seen.  Ever.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I must say that after listening to this album a few times, it leaves you wanting the second disc.  Mezmerize is a solid disc from System and arguably their finest work so far.  While this album is not as dark as their S/T nor as commerical as Toxicity, it is an \\"in-between\\" album as it takes the best aspects from both albums to create one big metal explosion.  Old System fans will love this disc and I would not be surprised to see this album pick up a few more fans as it blends a perfect mix of harmony, metal, and the signature System style.<br /><br />Music:  There is nothing to complain about here, the guitar riffs are very solid and catchy.  Daron has a lot to be proud of as it shows that he has spend time developing into an overall solid guitar player.  Songs such as BYOB, Cigaro, Violent Pornagraphy, and Sad Statue shows the evolution of Daron as he has indeed constructed some awesome riffs that fit the sound well.  Great drumming, your typical John \\"thrash\\" style but he knows how to slow it down in songs such as Revenga, Sad Statue, and Lost in Hollywood to keep the rhythm of the sound in great harmony.  If there was one flaw on this disc, it would be Shavo's bass lines.  While not clearly noticable such as in their previous works, Shavo as to the depth of each song.  Though it does seem that System wanted to make the album more heavy with stronger guitar riffs.<br /><br />Lyrics and Vocals:  To my surprise Daron is used a lot more not only in the songwriting but also sometimes serves as a lead vocalist and lets Serj handle backup such as in Lost in Hollywood.  This sound not disappoint the fans as Daron's voice and songwriting add depth to System's music that they may have been missing in the past.  Daron has a great voice and he shines in BYOB, Cigaro, and Lost in Hollywood.  Let's not forget about Serj, the vocalist that probably makes System what they are today.  It's the usuall screech and growl vocals but he does a fine job at singing a lot more in thisalbum as well.  Funny songwriting as well such as Cigaro, Violent Pornography, and Cocaine, these are your typical System songs that are fun to sing along to and great laughing material.<br /><br />Overall:  Great album, System has yet to disappoint the public even though some music fans don't like them.  This is an album that acutally shows they have worked 3+ years making, mixing and reconstructing.  I strongly recommend buying this album whether you are already a System fan (in which case you may already have it) or if you are looking on learning about System's style.  This album of course is not for everyone as most people get the first impression that their music is just noise, which they are sadly mistaken as it is part of their \\"Screw the Normal\\" style.  People do complain that this album is too short (just over 36 minutes) which they do have the right to since this album is loaded with A+ material.  I'm looking forward to Hypnotize in hopes that it will round out and complete this, so far, amazing double disc.
B000000WJZ|5.0|SD is their most polished alum. The production is shiny and the playing is stellar. Corgan does his job well, his guitar chops are dead on. But it's really James Chamberlain's drumming that makes this one happen. Mr. Chamberlain is a master of his instrument and trained in the traditional school of drumming- jazz. If you are into rock drumming at all, then you will love this album. If you aren't, then listen to this one more time and pay attention to every little drum lick. Overall, one of the great post punk-punk albums of all time.
B00001OH7P|3.0|This album is brilliant in ways that most people don't recognize.  While not the most fun or engaging Bowie album (thus, the three stars), ...Ziggy Stardust... does cleverly fool its audience, giving them the exact rock n' roll tripe and the exact disposable rock n' roll star it had come to expect from popular culture.  Many fans of this album miss this crucial point, bopping along mindlessly to such mindless \\"classics\\" as Moonage Daydream and Hold On To Yourself.  I'm not knocking the album, mind you--I'm merely appreciating another aspect of the album that most usually overlook. <br /> <br />Other aspects of the album go largely unnoticed.  For example, subtle messianic allusions abound, drawing comparisons between fan worship and savior worship.  In a world that lives vicariously through the exploits of celebrities rather than the exploits of the gods, meeting a celebrity is like a religious experience.  And like the \\"saviors\\" of old, rock stars often \\"die\\" at the hands of their own \\"people.\\" <br /> <br />The metaphors go deeper than signifying rock stars and saviors.  ...Ziggy Stardust... (and glam rock in general) sought to usurp traditional notions of \\"authenticity.\\"  Warhol, Bowie, and others realized that the function of surface is to signify substance (or lack thereof).  In a culture that defines one by one's \\"substance,\\" one can \\"become\\" just about anything by merely signifying it, even the archetypical pop star that self-destructs amidst a popular backlash.   <br /> <br />Born out of an era enamored of Warhol's idealization of vapidity, The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders From Mars was the first David Bowie album to capture the public imagination.  It is fun and upbeat, but it is a very empty album, even by Bowie's standards.  In my humble opinion, more engaging concepts lay in other Bowie albums. <br /> <br />For passionate, prophetic sci-fi in the vein of William Burroughs, check out Aladdin San and Diamond Dogs (not that they aren't without their own glam trappings and subtexts).  For the sound of a broken individual seeking escape and healing through solipsism, check out Low.  For some cocaine-fueled paranoid funk, listen to Station to Station.  For some occultism set to a happy beat, purchase Hunky Dory.  For some fractured, postmodern strangeness, give Outside a shot. <br /> <br />The rest of his albums are also worth your time.
0312330529|5.0|What a book!  What a story!  The characters are as real as your hand in front of your face and you'll want to hop on the next airplane to Bombay (Mumbai), India to drop in at Leopold's to chance a glimpse of the old gang.....<br /><br />This book will rip your heart out, stomp on it, and put it back in your chest all repaired by the ending.  It took me a week to read and it was the best week of my life.  I cried when it was over and haven't been able to read another book since.  Truly an epic masterpiece.
B00001OH7M|3.0|Contrary to popular conception, Space Oddity was not Bowie's first album.  That honor (or indignity, depending on how you look at it) goes to an album called David Bowie. <br /> <br />Nevertheless, Space Oddity is Bowie's first serious excursion into rock (barring the few tracks recorded for Deram that pinch rock cliches). <br /> <br />The album is typically hippy, although Bowie has his tongue planted firmly in his cheek on some of the tracks, and he blatantly criticizes the hippy community on Cygnet Committee.   <br /> <br />Nevertheless, the album sounds like the soundtrack to a love fest circa 1969.  If you like that sort of thing, you'll like this album.  If not, at least you can revel in the irony of Bowie doing a psychedelic rock ablum.
B0006FFRVQ|5.0|Diana does it again! Her smoky-voiced vocals and superb piano playing make these songs jump out of the speakers, regardless of whether you play the CD or DVD-A side. \\"Temptation\\" is a great track to show this disc's capability to your friends and to get them hooked on Diana as well. In defense of the Dual Disc format, remember that it's still a work in progress. I had no problems playing this, or any other Dual Disc I've purchased, on any player. The warning given about the CD side stems from the fact that the CD data layer is closer to the lens than is a standard CD, and some players may not be able to focus in on it. Newer players should have no trouble. The DVD layer on this disc provides the album in both DVD-Audioadvanced resolution sound, as well as Dolby Digital 5.1 and LPCM stereo, and some music videos. The inclusion of Dolby Digital is welcome for the ability to allow those who do not have DVD-Audio players to still enjoy the full surround version. And it doesn't sound bad at all. I agree that ALL Dual Disc releases should include 5.1 surround sound (after all, this is the 21st century), and that MLP DVD-Audio should be required on all discs, as well as the Dolby Digital, or even DTS track. (Are you listening, Sony BMG?) This format is still coming together. Let's embrace it and give it the chance to grow.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|A high-quality, respectable Bowie album. <br /> <br />As ever, Bowie collects and dispurses styles, often mutilated and/or reassembled beyond recognition.  Sometimes arty, sometimes kitschy, always provocative.  This album represents everything David Bowie's most intriguing qualities.
B00004ZB9D|1.0|Lenny Kravitz is perhaps the most mediocre, unoriginal and uninteresting musician of our generation. Emphasis on UNORIGINAL. He's a kitschy, commercialized, Diet Caffeine Free rip-off of Jimi Hendrix, minus everything good.
B00001OH7N|4.0|This is the album where some of Bowie's pet concepts started cropping up.  Evolution, totalitarianism, and the occult are all sung about in turn. <br /> <br />A hard, heavy album for the rock fan that is looking for a little more substance.
B00006JU7T|5.0|This is perhaps Sidney Lumet's finest film and undoubtedly one of Al Pacino's finest performances--in fact, on the basis of this film and the first two Godfathers, one could make a case for Pacino as the greatest American actor.  His work in Serpico is full of the beauty and rage of classic poetry. <br /> <br />Lumet's direction is street-smart, bordering on documentary style at times, absolutely riveting from the first image of a gravely wounded Serpico to the last shot of Serpico with his dog, all alone in the world with his integrity.  Lumet also manages to bring in humorous scenes, such as the one in which Serpico and other cops try marijuana and get the munchies--sounds silly, but it's not.  Lumet is an actor's director and lets his cast establish the momentum of the film. <br /> <br />The supporting cast is uniformly impressive, with Tony Roberts as an interesting foil for Serpico and a host of solid character actors playing various cops who are hostile to or just plain weirded out by Serpico. <br /> <br />The extras are not bad, although I was hoping to find out more about the \\"real\\" Frank Serpico.  He does have an interesting website and is very much alive and well, in spite of all the tragedy he has faced. <br /> <br />Actually, this movie shows that there are 2 \\"real Frank Serpicos,\\" and one of them was Al Pacino in 1973.  The only slight criticism I have of the movie is a tendency to make Frank look too good and everyone in the NYPD (almost) look like a scumbag--he almost comes across as Saint Francis, not just Frank--but, it's a movie no matter how gritty it is, and some oversimplification goes with the territory.  In any event, Serpico is a great 70s film, a great police film, and a document of the genius of Al Pacino.
B00001OH7T|3.0|A slick soul album from the master of irony. <br /> <br />If for nothing else, get this album for the classics, Young Americans and Fame!  You won't regret it!
B000094A6A|5.0|this film is hilarious, it had me in stitches throughout. will ferrell leads this film completely, he is hilarious, altho Luke Wilson and Vince Vaughn are excellent aswell. I recommend u watch it cos it is fantastic!! <br />The wedding singer in it rules lol
B00001OH7V|4.0|This music sounds like it was recorded with total abandon.  Far less melodic in most places than its immediate predecessor, Low, Heroes is strange, alive, and difficult to categorize. <br /> <br />You'll hear everything from chaotic disco to nightmarish ambient. <br /> <br />Recommended.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I just bought this album... well I downloaded it off iTunes.  I must say that it is an amazing album, better than Toxicity, and that was one of my favorites.  This band can only get better and better, each one of their CDs tops their old one.  Good job, System.  \\"Everybody's goin' to the party have a real good time, dancin' in the desert blowin up the sunshine\\"
B00001OH7U|5.0|This is some high-energy funk tinged with some unexpected (but perfectly fitting) ambient guitar squeals. <br /> <br />I love the epic title track and the high-octane Stay.  Wild As The Wind is the most romantic song I've ever heard.
0679805273|5.0|It's graduation time, so I'll be buying a copy of Oh, the Places You'll Go! for the two high school graduates we know this year. It's a great book for these young adults as they begin a new life passage. It's all about going out and finding your way in life, weathering its storms, and being in charge of and taking responsibility for your life and how it turns out. It begins...<br /><br />Congratulations!<br />Today is your day.<br />You're off to Great Places!<br />You're off and away!<br /><br />Isn't that a great beginning for anyone starting anew? Remember the old saying, \\"Today is the first day of the rest of your life?\\" It certainly fits here. This book was originally published in 1990 and has more text than many of Dr. Seuss books that are aimed at very young audiences (I know a 90-year-old who still loves Dr. Seuss's books). The book is 56 pages long (unnumbered) with illustrations as bizarre and wonderful as only Theodor Seuss Geisel could draw them. I also appreciate that on the back cover of this book is the entire list of Dr. Seuss books in the order in which they were written.<br /><br />Carolyn Rowe Hill
B00001OH7O|5.0|One of the most melodic, catchy albums Bowie has ever written.  Ironic, considering the themes of the lyrics. <br /> <br />Ever the seeker, Bowie's voracious quest for perspectives (notice I did not say \\"truth\\") led him to investigate myriad occult and philosophical concepts.  Hunky Dory finds him wrestling with these concepts, all the while confused and contradictory--in other words, all the things we love about David Bowie. <br /> <br />A concept-heavy, musically bouyant album!
B00005NC66|5.0|François Truffaut, Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol, Jacques Rivette and Eric Rohmer were film connoisseurs, who all worked as movie critics for the same magazine. Between the years 1958 to 1964, this group transitioned into filmmaking, and, along with other directors, such as Agn&eacute;s Varda, Jean-Pierre Melville and Louis Malle, ushered in the French New Wave Movement, (Nouvelle Vague). Their background in film theory and criticism was a major factor in motivating these artists to create a bold new cinema.<br /><br />Jean-Luc Godard's first feature, \\"Breathless,\\" was released in 1960, introducing the New Wave and changing cinema forever. Godard used jump cuts, handheld cameras, zoom lenses and a new editing style to take the viewer places never ventured before. No artificial, glossy stage sets in this movie. Along with the protagonists, we travel up and down small side streets, into local bars and sidewalk cafes, across boulevards and, for inconsequential moments, brush the lives of passers-by, who have nothing to do with the screenplay, but always play a role in our daily comings and goings. The fragmented rhythm of modern life is translated here. Godard used sound in the same way, adding street noises, bits of conversations and music to add to the movie's authenticity and pace. This was indeed innovative at the time. And it still holds up. Watching \\"Breathless\\" forty-five years after its debut, 21st century technology does not detract from its dynamism or relevance in the slightest. In fact, with each viewing, I find the film every bit as exciting and poignant as I did the first time.<br /><br />Jean-Paul Belmondo plays the feckless, foul-mouthed car thief, anti-hero and Humphrey Bogart fan, Michel Poiccard. Just a few minutes after the opening credits conclude, Michel's status changes from small-time hood to cop killer. His life's plans alter drastically as he becomes a hunted fugitive. Michel remains cool enough, however, to visit an old girlfriend and steal some money. Bogart would have been proud - not of the theft, but of the style. Michel spots gamine-like American, Patricia Franchini, (the lovely Jean Seberg), selling copies of the Herald Tribune on the Champs-Elysees, and pursues her, with roguish smiles and moody pouts. He curses her and moves off fast, though, when she gives him a hard time. He likes his women more enthusiastic. Instead of getting out of town fast, Michel hangs with fellow thugs and steals more cars.<br /><br />Patricia is an enigmatic character, who occasionally startles with her observations and revelations. Twenty years-old, with the naive face of an angel, she seems to have no direction or goals in life. She studies at the Sorbonne and says she wants to write, but is oddly detached. She shuns commitment. She does occasional odd jobs for the newspaper, but appears to live in a dream world. Of course Patricia winds up with Michel and together they gallivant around the gorgeous streets of Paris, as if they haven't a care in the world. Patricia does have at least one problem, however - she might be pregnant. Together the couple attempts to collect on a debt to raise enough cash to escape to Italy.<br /><br />Godard captures incredibly intimate moments between the two lovers, particularly in one lengthy, extremely realistic bedroom episode, filled with small talk, tenderness, petty cruelties, eroticism, mind games, childhood memories shared and loneliness. At the scene's end we have a better understanding of the self destructive individuals who make-up this twosome. A sense of burgeoning doom, which has hovered in the background all along, begins to increase here. Michel's bravado also escalates with the level of danger and, to his credit, he remains true to his idol, Bogart, to the end. The conclusion boggles the mind, at least it has always impacted me emotionally in a major way.<br /><br />Belmondo is brilliant as the restless thief, in this, his first film role. He reminds me of a French James Dean. Seberg is convincing and fresh. This is a dynamic film, witty, fast-paced, romantic and disturbing. It has long been a favorite of mine.<br /><br />JANArench James Dean. Seberg is convincing and fresh. This is a dynamic film, witty, fast-paced, romantic and disturbing. It has long been a favorite of mine. <br />JANA
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|The long awaited fourth release by S O A D is a solid disc that flows strong as do all the S O A D cds.  Songs BYOB and Sad Statue are personal favorites.  The only reason I didn't give the disc a 5 out of 5 stars is the lack of evolution from the band's previous efforts.  Not to say this album doesn't rock, but it is not as good as the debut self titled album or 'Toxicity'.  The vocals that surround the metal is what makes S O A D a great band.  Great lyrics, and hyper active good metal fun, should get you going throughout the summer or at least till the 2nd disk comes out.  Also Recommend: Tomahawk 'Mit Gas' (Mike Patton's other creations)  Death, Monster Magnet, Kyuss, QOTSA, Soundgarden, Audioslave, SOD, Suicidal Tendencies.  Well most of you know who these mf's are, but if you don't, check em out.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is Album of the year. Way too original. Way too good. Buy  it now. Every song is sick good. These guys are the best.
1591396190|5.0|Well written, easy language, chapters are clearly linked and in the right sequence, methodology is easy to follow, full of examples..... What else do you want? It's really a blue ocean pearl strategy! <br /> <br /> <br />   <br />
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Despite Kid Van WInkles rant, System of a Down are one of, if not the most, original metal bands out there right now. Yes, they definitely are an aquired taste, but they do what every successful band has done since the Beatles: write very catchy melodies and guitar riffs. I have to admit, I wasn't that thrilled with Steal This Album, but this album is tons better. System of a Down are very talented song writers who deserve credit for saying F' the norm, we are doing something completely different. If only more bands would take this approach
B0001KZM3O|5.0|This album,the final cut, is very intense mood-wise. You really get behind the mask of Waters, you can almost feel his heart. This album was written about Roger Waters experience with his father dying in the war, and his thoughts on the war. Many people compare this album with the wall, the mood is similar yes, and \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" is on the movie The Wall, but this album is all on its own. The lyrics are written in a first/second person perspective, and it really brings out the feeling. With all the mood changes within the songs, you travel through the mind of anyone touched by the cold hand of death from war, and with the orchestra backing the band it really projects the point of intention to impact your mind and show you how they feel. An overall magnificent composition. In \\"The Post War Dream\\" the lyrics give a childs-eye view, \\"Tell me true, tell me why, was Jesus crucified Is it for this that Daddy died?\\" and ends up with an older view of the same topic. Near the middle of the album \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\" it expresses society's view of our veterans \\"Did they expect us to treat them with any respect?  <br />They can polish their medals and sharpen their  <br />Smiles, and amuse themselves playing games for awhile.  <br />Boom boom, bang bang, lie down you're dead....\\",  <br /> how we just thorw them away in a shelter where they can tell their tales to their fellow shell-shocked partners who are all driving them-selves mad with their melencholy dispositions, because \\"It's the only connection they feel..\\". The lyrics then turn back to the idea of the war stricken minds. The last songs conclusion is the view of a man in a car crash and his family is dying around him his daughter \\"DADDY! DADDY!\\", he sees but a glimpse of the war heroes who were surrounded by this daily, the ending sentence \\"Ashes and diamonds Foe and friend We were all equal in the end.\\" When the cd is over you are left stranded (not hanging feeling unfinished) but alone thinkingover what you just listened to. A true masterpiece, one of floyd's finest.  <br /> <br />
B000000QFV|5.0|But not a Good SABBATH  album. <br />Totally a concept  album. This is a great set of songs about Norse Mythology. A great listen on a good audio  system. <br />However, the songs really meld together, until, it starts to border on being a style of album that YES made popular in the 70s. It is all good, but it is not Sabbath, not Iommi ( listen to his solo stuff for the difference, the 90s  stuff). <br />A nice surprise to see Iommi's skill, and the rest of the band prowess, I'll give them that, but its not a Sabbath masterwork.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is amazing! System of a Down never stop making incredible music. Even Steal This Album! was pretty good considering that album was made up of songs that weren't \\"good enough\\" for their other CD's. The first song I heard by them was Chop Suey! and after that I was hooked. Their self-titled album was awesome and so was Toxicity. Now, we've got Mezmerize. Definitley different from their previous stuff (Not in a bad way though), this album stuck to me right after I had heard Soldier Side- Intro. Every song is unique in its own way.  <br /> <br /> <br />1. Soldier Side - Intro- Great intro. The guitar is played beautifully and the lyrics are haunting. (10 out of 10) <br />2. B.Y.O.B.- SS leads into this song at bullet-train speed. The music and lyrics are dead on. The R&B chorus and the ultraspeed verses make it perfect. (10 out of 10) <br />3. Revenga- Great work by Daron. Serj's rapid-fire rantings are amazing. The bridge is incredible and the song overall is definitley one of my favorites. (10 out of 10) <br />4. Cigaro- This song about one's self-centered ego is fast and doesn't hold back. (10 out of 10) <br />5. Radio/Video- A circus-like tempo and beat accompany this song. Not really one of the favorites but still pretty good. (8 out of 10) <br />6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song-  Although I have no idea what this song means, it's still up with my favorites and I think it's amazing. (10 out of 10) <br />7. Violent Pornography- This song jumps around a lot and is pure System. The lyrics are quite raw and they clearly don't care what's said. (9 out of 10) <br />8. Question!- I love the begining acoustic guitar. It plays so beautifully and then stomps into a hardcore riff. Definitley like the transfer of tempos. (10 out of 10) <br />9. Sad Statue- These lyrics couldn't be more true in my opinion. This is the kind of political/poetic lyrics we need. The chorus is nice. (10 out of 10) <br />10. Old School Hollywood- This song revolves around a celebrity baseball game and the synth-heavy verses and choruses make it different but worth the listen. (9 out of 10) <br />11. Lost In Hollywood- Great outro. Amazing lyrics. The music is definitley one of the best and the bridge playing over the hums of Serj is fantastic. (10 out of 10) <br /> <br />Overall- I'd say this album is definitley Mezmerizing. (9.63 out of 10)
1400031362|5.0|I enjoyed this 3rd book in the series very much, and life goes on with more interesting adventures. <br /> <br />As you know in the last book, Mma Ramotswe was engaged to Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni. In this book, they still plan to marry of course, but Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni is experiencing a depressed mood unlike himself, and is not in the mood to run his garage. So he just took off and left the work up to his apprentices who only goof off and work hardly at all. That is, until the detective agancy experiences financial setbacks, and Mma Romatske has her secretary/assistant detective, take over at the garage as well. That way they can save money, and help Mr. J.L.B Matekoni as well to save the garage while absent. When Mma Makutsi takes over there, she puts her foot down, and makes these gentleman work harder than they ever have. And, shortly after a new case comes in. <br /> <br />The new case is the Government man who believes that his autistic brother is being poisined by his wife who only married him for the family money anyway. It is reluctantly that Mma Ramotske takes the case, and stays at the family farm for a 'respite' for a week so she can see what really goes on. What she finds out there is quite surprising. <br /> <br />Then there is another case taken by Mma Makutsi. There is a beauty competition run by a wealthy gentleman each year. Trouble is, he isn't sure which girl is deserving of the award as many of them are quite untrustworthy. So he wants Mma Makutsi to interview the candidates for this year's pageant, and figure out which girl has morality, and is worthy of the winner's place. <br /> <br />There is also a strange boy in the story this time as well. Mma Potokwane, the manager of the orphan farm, doesn't know what to make of him. He seems unable to speak, and won't wear any clothing. He is a wild boy, and attacks anyone who comes near him. So Mma Potokwane wants Mma Ramotske to figure out where this boy might have come from, and who he belonged to before. But it may not be easy when the boy won't even talk. Anyway she owes Mma Potokwane a return favor for helping Mr. J.L.B Matekoni snap out of his depression and seeing that he takes his pills properly. <br /> <br />The book was just full of events like this and it always makes it so interesting. It is hard to put down.
B0000797IO|2.0|This is one of those movies that has the power to make me uncomfortable. That is a rarity. I saw this movie on Oxygen and thought I'd watch a few minutes of it because I had never seen it. I wish I had kept flipping channels.  <br /> <br />Jennifer Aniston gave a strong performance as a married woman stuck in a dead end retail job in a small town. Her character seems reserved and emotionally blocked off, but Aniston handels it well. Her husband is a none-the-wiser lummocks who genuinely seems to care for her. Through out the film, I kept wanting her to confess about the tasteless affair she has with an emotionally disturbed young man who works with her at her retail job. The audience is lulled into a feeling of \\"no one knows about us\\", but before long, comments from co-workers and the security guard flat out tell her they saw this ill-fated pair in the store stockroom. <br /> <br />Some aspects of this film make me sick, but I was impressed with the performances. I wouldn't recommend this film for the story, but I would for the performances.
B0007Y4USW|5.0|GRAMMY MATERIAL!!!!!  <br />There is no other like Mariah. It's like listening to an Angel sing. Her voice is unique from all the other power house female vocalists. It's powerful but at the same time has an innocence, softness, clarity, beauty, and tranquil quality that is so completely mesmerizing. She is unparalleled. This is why no contestant on AI has ever attempted to sing one of her songs. Mariah is simply untouchable. She is an amazing talent that can sing, but can also write & produce her own songs and has done so from the start of her career. She debuted at #1 her 1st week on billboard. As for all the haters.... screw'em....it's not worth wasting my time. I just skip over their reviews, because obviously they need hearing aids. First, I think this is the best album of her career. It's hard to decifer because I love them all, but MC has really hit the jackpot with this one. It's a real work of art that offers an assortment of beautiful ballads and addictive dance/club/R&B tracks. Her next single should be either \\"Mine Again\\", \\"Get Your Number\\", or \\"Stay the Night\\". As always her genuine & sincere lyrics are well written, mature, articulate, and conveyed with pure emotion. I also love the angel-like look of the cd cover. She looks absolutely beautiful. As I previously mentioned, I have alot of respect for Mariah because she is the only superstar songstress that utilizes every aspect of her talent in writing and producing her songs (w/ the exception of Christina[Stripped] who is beginning to). This cd is magnificent. GO BUY THE CD & LETS CONTINUE THE #1 REIGN ON THE CHARTS. GO OUT & GET IT NOW!!!!! YOU WILL LOOOOOOOOVE IT.....I'M BACK.... SHE HAS SLIPPED TO #2 ON THE BILLBOARD THE 2ND WEEK, WHICH IS STILL RESPECTFUL.... BUT WE NEED TO HELP HER REBOUND BACK TO # 1.....PASS THE WORD....WE HAVE TO SUPPORT HER....
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Brilliant.  Absolutely brilliant!  Finally a band that is consistently creative.  They can write a RIFF and not just strum 3 chords with distortion on!  Lyrics that are more than just whining about girlfreinds and parents!!!  Awesome!
0446310786|5.0|This book surprised me, I thought it was going to be just another one of the books that you don't like reading in High School. The author, Harper Lee, actually did a excellent job on keeping the story interesting. I didn't want to stop reading, because I had to know what was going to happen next!He went in to great detail, to the point that I felt I was inside the story running along with Scout, Dill, and Jem. Overall the story was well structured and I wouldn't be surprised if i found my-self reading it again (other then in school!).
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|From the gentle opening intro, \\"Soldier Side,\\" you know that this isn't going to be like any other System of a Down album yet.  And while it is lacking in a couple nitpicky areas, Mezmerize shapes up to be a worthy follow-up to the 2001 breakthrough, Toxicity. <br /> <br />1) Soldier Side - Intro -- A nice, acoustic and vocals number that opens up the album in a smooth, gentle way.  The best thing about this track is the realization that, just because System seems to get heavier and heavier, their trademark harmonies are still solid. <br /> <br />2) B.Y.O.B. -- A frenetic, rollicking single that skips across dynamics and time signatures with ease.  Some of the lyrics are a little muddled, but they retain System's well-known political edge, and the guitar playing is crisp and tight. <br /> <br />3) Revenga -- This was my least favorite song on the CD.  For some reason, it just lacks that distinguishable quality, maybe because it doesn't exactly have a strong hook. <br /> <br />4) Cigaro -- Classic System.  Feels like what would happen if you took \\"Bounce,\\" \\"Chic 'N' Stu,\\" and \\"F**k the System\\" and threw them into a blender.  And only System could get away with the lyrical content, that's for damn sure. <br /> <br />5) Radio/Video -- Probably one of the best songs on the disc.  This track eschews the mostly punkish feel of the first few songs in favor of a more straight-ahead rock feel, pushing through a chorus that gets in your head like no other.  The feel of the verse is so unique, sounding almost carnival-like in its bounciness, yet it has such a natural cohesiveness, building towards an intense accelerando that caps the song off amazingly. <br /> <br />6) This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song -- One of the shorter songs on the disc, this one compares to \\"Revenga\\" in the respect that there really isn't anything that makes this song particularly distinct. <br /> <br />7) Violent Pornography -- Not the greatest song on the disc, but a fun one to sing along to since the lyrics are simple and repetitive.  Another tune that involves frenetic tempo and dynamic shifts. <br /> <br />8) Question! -- Showcasing the softer side of System, the guitar work on this track, from the expertly fingerpicked intro to the tricky picking of the heavier choruses to the obscenely fast bridge, are made even more impressive by the constantly alternating 6/8 and 5/8 time signatures. <br /> <br />9) Sad Statue -- Picking up where songs like \\"Toxicity\\" started, the unabashedly political content of this track is an excellent complement to some of the finest instrumentation on the album. <br /> <br />10) Old School Hollywood -- A track that exchanges the sound of a simple four-man metal group and instead infuses techno elements and synthesized sound effects.  Unfortunately, not much in the way of inventive or extensive lyrics. <br /> <br />11) Lost in Hollywood -- A pretty surprising track, featuring Daron on vocals almost exclusively.  Unique in that its subject matter seems so depressing, but Daron's voice remains plaintive but not whiny or fake.  A fitting conclusion. <br /> <br />This album is without a doubt some of System's most impressive work yet.  The musicality of the individual performers is more clearly evident than on any of their releases so far, and the group as a unit feels tight and powerful.  The thing that's most lacking here, however, is the lyrics, which sometimes feel a little too repetitive.  On the whole, though, this disc is only going to make fans salivate more in anticipation of September's Hypnotize release.  As well it should.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This movie made me want to read Peter Pan and see every feature film based on his story. Suddenly you see films like \\"New Adventures in Neverland\\" by Disney or \\"Hook\\" with Robin Williams in a brand new light. I like the fact that this movie is not a mere biographical portrait of J.M.Barrie. It makes the author part of Peter Pan's world and thus links our real world with Neverland.  <br />Certainly, you cannot expect to learn facts and figures about 19th century literature or Barrie's personal relations, but you'll find a new aspect of your own world which makes this movie absolutely worth watching. It's a must. Honestly. <br />\\"Finding Neverland\\", \\"Lost in Translation\\", and \\"The Girl With the Pearl Earring\\" are all some sort of quiet yet beautiful works which I regard more like a painting than like a plot-based story.  <br />One more thing: Johnny Depp makes a great perfomance and leaves enough room for a little English boy whose wet eyes will eventually make you sad and probably even cry.
B00003CXCT|4.0|I don't really have a strong desire to go into the whole Star Wars debate.  Yes, I think George Lucas could make a great deal of fans happy (and a great deal of money) to release the original untampered movies on DVD.  No, I don't necessarily think that putting Hayden Christensen in Jedi was the worst thing he could have done...before you \\"BOO!  HISS!\\" me, think about it...what was the last face Anakin wore just before he came to be Darth Vader?  He didn't look like Sebastian Shaw, he looked like Hayden Christensen.  I think there's a certain logic to it, wherein they revert to the way they were at their strongest point of being Jedi, and where was Anakin the strongest but at the end, just before he became Darth Vader?  I know hardcore fans won't necessarily agree, but I can see why they did it that way....Obi-Wan was strongest with the force just before Darth Vader struck him down, and Yoda...well, Yoda looks like Yoda.  I am just thrilled that I could go out and finally buy these movies on DVD to share with my sweet 3 year old son, who is already turning into a huge Star Wars fan.  I'll take what I can get, and whereas movies go, remastered or not, it's still one of the greatest.
B0000700KL|5.0|I saw this movie on T.V and I just had to purchase my own copy. The constant flow of imagery, rich music and cultural elements make you feel as if you are in a dream. It is the most artistic movie I know I'll ever watch. I also like the fact that it is not another boring and subjective documentary; instead you can let your imagination and spirit feel the beautiful sensations being thrown at you. It is a whirlwind of deep emotions that give you shivers while you \\"experience\\" this movie.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|\\"Mesmerize\\" is one of those rare gems that you can listen to from start to finish without having to skip tracks (ofcourse this may be due to the fact that the CD is only roughly 40 min. long).  <br /> <br />Their songs feature greater innovations, intense growth, and more eastern influence than ever before!  <br /> <br />\\"B.Y.O.B.\\" starts off as a typical SOAD track, but quickly turns into a song that sounds more \\"R&B\\" than Rock. This change does not last long as the band immediately switches into high-gear screaming into the ear of EVERY American: \\"WHERE THE F--- ARE YOU???\\" Adding to this ferocity, the band then takes aim at U.S. leaders chanting: \\"Why don't presidents fight the war?? Why do they always send the poor??\\" <br /> <br />The rest of the album is NO LESS captivating. \\"Radio/Video\\" and \\"Oldschool Hollywood\\" both carry an extremely \\"poppy\\" feel that has to be HEARD before its judged (very innovative stuff)! \\"Violent Pornography\\" not only carries an absolutely hilarious chorus, it also has a very serious message at the end of the song. <br /> <br />\\"Sad Statue\\" carries the political feel that SOAD is well known for, while the rest of the album features other memorable goodies. The album is flawless from beginning to end (if you're the kind of person who loves to debunk lyrics and break down how songs are composed). <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and BUY this album. Then do yourself another favor and reserve their next album: \\"Hypnotize!\\"

B0007TKNL0|4.0|I approached this film with some reservations.  In my mind director Joel Schumacher was a hack of the first order(\\"Batman and Robin\\", anyone?).  To give the devil his due this is probably Schumacher's finest moment.  Not to say he advances the cinematic landscape but he has made a successful entertainment in translating Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical to the screen.  The songs are fantastic and the story is consistently enthralling.  Gerald Butler makes a compelling Phantom, successfully combining both the menace and the pathos of the character.  Patrick Wilson makes a dashing Raoul.  The real star of the show is Emmy Rossum as Christine.  This kind of breakout performance is once-in-a-bluemoon event.  Why wasn't she nominated for an Oscar?  For that matter why didn't she sing the nominated song at the Oscars instead of Beyonce?  Rossum combines an expressiveness that combines innocence and sensuality.  The bonus is that when she sings your heart just completely melts.  The film also boasts an impressive supporting cast including Miranda Richardson, Simon Callow, and Minnie Driver.  All around, an enjoyable show.
B00005JMAH|3.0|I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan and \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\" is my favorite book in the series so far. I was looking very foward to seeing this movie. After seeing it, I was very disappointed. Cuaron, the new director, butchered the original story. There was many mistakes and there were too many things left out of the movie.<br />Cuaron changed the entire setting of Hogwarts. The grounds were completely changed. He added a stupid bridge to get into the school and changed the location of the Gryffindor common room.<br />Many scenes from the book were also left out. Cuaron did not put in the back story of the Marauder's Map, how Moody, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were Harry's father and his friends. There were very little scenes of Harry and his friends in class. The movie ended without closure like the first two. It ended, instead of them leaving on the train of the End of the Year Feast, ended with a freeze-frame of Harry flying on his Firebolt. There is much more that was changed or left out, but there isn't enough time to mention it all.<br />On a whole the movie was ok, but for fans of the book the movie did not live up to the story. Cuaron should be charged with TREASON for this abomination!
0064409422|5.0|In the time of WWII, four children find a wardrobe that leads to another world. A world will be saved...A destiny will be chosen...and the Chronicles...will begin... <br />All I can say is that this is one of the best books in the chronicles, the first one published. I have been to the website for the film and I cannot wait until It comes out! When I saw the teaser trailer on tv a few weeks ago, I got really excited. I let out a loud whoop of joy and my mom came to see what was wrong. It reminded me about how our copies of the Chronicles were getting dusty. I've read it 10 times since then. I also recommend the other Chronicles, too. <br />If you love The Lord of The Rings, Harry Potter, or fantasy in general, or you can't wait for the film to come out, READ THIS BOOK! <br />P.S. I also found out that if this film goes well, they might do PRINCE CASPIAN, VOYAGE OF THE DAWN TREADER, THE SILVER CHAIR, and THE LAST BATTLE!!
B00003CXI1|4.0|I am a HUGE Harry Potter fan. I love the books and when i first heard a movie was being made I was very excited. The movie was just as I hoped it would be. It had all the elements from the orginal book. Chris Columbus was able to catch the magical world of Hogwarts the way J.K. Rowling created it. He also was able to portray the friendship of Harry, Ron, and Hermione.<br /><br />Chris Columbus is an excelletent director that can bring to life a world of wizards, wands, brooms, and most of all magic.
B000031WBV|1.0|when you put this disc into an actual cd player you can tell its an old recording.i wouldnt recommend this garbage to anyone i care about...
B00008DDXC|4.0|After the great success of \\"The Sorcerer's Stone\\" I was greatly looking foward to seeing \\"Chamber of Secrets.\\" Chris Columbus once again captured the magical world of Harry Potter. The amazing settings, te characters, and the new creatures was all amazing. He recreated the most amazing scenes from the book perfectly.<br /><br />Columbus is a great director and he should have directed the thrid movie.
B000002MJC|3.0|After the amazing \\"Violator,\\" I guess there really wasn't anywhere left to go but down. With \\"Songs Of Faith And Devotion,\\" that's exactly where Dm slid. I have pondered wether or not Gore and Gahan's substance abuse problems were distorting their muses while this album was in the embryonic stages (think Aerosmith's plummet from \\"Rocks\\" to \\"Draw The Line\\"), or if the artistic and commercial peak of \\"Violator\\" caused them to panic creatively.<br /><br />Both would help to explain why \\"I Feel You\\" screech starts the CD with a weak impersonation \\"Personal Jesus,\\" and why the distorted grunge guitars wreak havoc on a great deal of the other songs. This being the advent age of Nirvana and Soundgarden, these productions were all the rage. But in all honestly, they sound like misappropriated clothes on \\"SoFaD.\\" Creative Panic would also explain the style lurches, like the gospel inflection of \\"Condemnation.\\"<br /><br />Where DM sticks to their strengths is when \\"SoFaD\\" at least stays listenable. Both \\"Walking In My Shoes\\" and \\"In Your Room\\" are worthy of space in the DM canon of classics, and \\"One Caress\\" is a very good ballad. Unfortunately, this album has not gathered any luster over time, in the way \\"Black Celebration\\" and even \\"Exciter\\" have.<br /><br />PS. The quickie \\"Songs Of Faith And Devotion Live\\" CD released within a year of this is completely avoidable.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|I looked at some of the reviews for this cd, and was immediately upset when some person claimed that Love is hell and rock n roll could have been shortened to one cd total because they deemed those cds to not be ryan's best work.  Please point to one song on Love is Hell that is not good.  If you think Love is Hell is a bad cd, you need to go listen to some other kind of music, because you are in the wrong arena.  Love is Hell is a masterpiece, and is my favorite cd of all time, and Ryan also believes it is his best work.  You are not a Ryan Adams fan if you only like Heartbreaker, because his other stuff was just as good, and Love is Hell is better and certainly could not have been shorter; should have been longer though because the songs he left off were even great.  All I can really say about Cold Roses is that it's great, and unless Ryan's other 2 cds coming out this year are better, Cold Roses will probably be my favorite cd of 2005.  The cd really grew on me and I keep listening to it and uncover different layers and find new appreciation in each song.  I didn't like the sound of the cd at first and was a little critical at some of the songs and the overall sound, vibe of the cd.  But once I bought it and played it in my car a time or two I started falling in love.  It's so good that I just want to lay under the stars with my girlfriend all summer and play this cd; it is just so beautiful.  What's better is Ryan is so confident right now and I think he could do anything he wanted to.  I saw him play twice so far this tour and he is playing at a level so much higher and intense than anyone else right now that it's chilling.  He totally blew my mind with almost every song.  Two more cds coming out this year, if he doesn't try to put out even more, and every song I've heard from those albums so far (he's been playing some of the songs live) have been unreal.  Songs like Trains and A Kiss Before I Go are great and just waiting to be released on the cds.  I can't wait, but for now, I'm enjoying this great album.  It's no Love is Hell, and doesn't have a great great great ryan adams song like a La Cienega, Dear Chicago, English Girls, I See Monsters, Come Pick Me Up, Jacksonville Syline, etc, etc, etc, but every song is solid and pretty and on the verge of becoming great, and with a couple more listens some of those songs will become my favorites if I feel they have timeless qualities like everything else ryan does.  IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN HIM LIVE YET THIS YEAR, GET OFF YOUR DAMN ASS AND SEE HIM, YOU WILL BE DOING YOURSELF A FAVOR, I PROMISE!!!!ait, but for now, I'm enjoying this great album.

B00005Y228|4.0|Kylie Minogue re-broke into pop stardom with \\"Fever,\\" her eighth studio album. And it's somehow not surprising -- \\"Fever\\" is infectious, dancey and perpetually catchy. Despite the \\"lovey\\" tone of the songs, Kylie's album is dancepop in its purest form, and is probably the best example of the type.<br /><br />It starts off on a rather middling note with the fast-paced \\"More More More,\\" before launching into the sparkling \\"Love At First Sight,\\" a more complex dance song that is surprisingly infectious. (\\"And everything went from wrong to right/the stars came up and filled up the sky/the music you were playin' nearly blew my mind/it was love at first sight!\\")<br /><br />Things coast on from there, including the infuritatingly entertaining \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head,\\" the funk-edged \\"Give It To Me,\\" and the sultry \\"Love Affair.\\" She also dabbles in softer electropop, in songs like the swoony \\"Fragile\\" and the swirling \\"In Your Eyes,\\" both of which turn down the tempo and up the emotion.<br /><br />It's always sort of nice when a guilty pleasure doesn't pretend to be anything but what it is. And \\"Fever\\" has no such pretensions. It's a fun, slightly suggestive album that you can dance to, with the forgettable lyrics of dancepop, and some truly enjoyable beats that have a tendency to stick to your mind like old bubble gum.<br /><br />Even her most ardent fans can't claim that Kylie has a great voice -- she has a voice that is lightweight, wispy and pretty. It matches the music, and she knows how to use it, never overtaxing the ol' vocal chords. In other words, no Britney-style chord-straining yowls or screeches. Rather than exceptional vocal quality, Kylie gets props for knowing her limits, and working with them.<br /><br />And the dancepop of \\"Fever\\" also gets props for unusual complexity. Rather than repetitive beats repeated on every song, several songs from \\"Fever\\" switch tempo, switch synths, and have their highs and lows. There are some distinct flavours to some of the songs, such as funk and a bit of disco, which add extra spice and memorability.<br /><br />\\"Fever\\" is a guilty pleasure, but at least it's a fun, entertaining one.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I had not planned on buying this cd at first. Then i heard Cigaro and BYOB. Then the cd came out and i have not stopped listening to it since i bought it. Every song sticks out in there own way. Can't wait for the follow up.
B000066BYE|4.0|British band Muse broke out in the US with their third album \\"Absolution,\\" and establishing them as a remarkable new rock band. They're epic, intensedark, and majestic in a proggy-Pink-Floyd-meets-Led-Zeppelin kind of way, and so it's hardly a surprise that \\"Hullabaloo\\" is a remarkably strong collection.<br /><br />No, it's not a new album. Rather, it's a collection of B-sides, rarities, and a 2001 live concert. Most bands don't sound too great in either case, but Muse does. The first disc is made up of their B-sides and rarities, which tend to be quite good actually.<br /><br />It doesn't start off promising, with the schizophrenic prog-rocker \\"Forced In,\\" which would be fine if it weren't for the endlessly cycling synth that obscures everything else. But things get stronger after that, with the explosive downward spiral that is \\"Shrinking Universe\\" (\\"There's nothing left to die for!\\"), the softer poppy \\"Recess,\\" and the surprisingly gentle acoustic ballad \\"Map Of your Head.\\"<br /><br />Most of the other songs follow those examples, either being epic and bombastic or quieter and more intimate. With, of course, some eerier songs thrown in, like the rippling sweetness of \\"Shine Acoustic.\\" Are they as good as Muse's proper albums, especially since a few B-sides sound like the lost soundtrack of the X-Files? Not really, but they are remarkably good, and still better than average.<br /><br />Which brings us to the live performance, which took place in October of 2001, in Paris's \\"Le Zenith.\\" Well, to put it simply, these guys rock. It opens with a cheering crowd, right before they kick off into a tornado of bass, drums and guitar. Unlike many rock bands, these guys lose none of their power or musical richness in live performances.<br /><br />The inevitable flaw? Well, that would probably be Matt Bellamy -- he doesn't sound too different from in the albums, but it's sometimes hard to hear him above the drums, explosive synth and spiralling bass. However, the guys lose none of their intensity musically, and it's hard to find a single flaw in their playing. If Muse are known for their prowess in live performances, then it's easy to see why.<br /><br />The B-sides are a minor treasure trove, while the live album is a gem in itself, bringing their concert to life as nothing -- except a DVD -- could. A must-have for Muse fans.er, the guys lose none of their intensity musically, and it's hard to find a single flaw in their playing.

B000002KHH|5.0|Some would argue that the first metal album ever was Sabbaths first release, but too me its too bluesy, its more like Heavy blues rock. Paranoid is responsible for some of the greatest Metal songs ever, aswell as some of the greatest guitar riffs ever. The only other metal album that could rival Paranoid as the best Metal album ever is Metallica's Master Of Puppets but I think Paranoid is much better. Heres what I think of the songs.    1.War Pigs (5/5)- Full of awesome guitar riffs and licks by the Riff Master himself Tony Iommi  2.Paranoid (5/5)-A classic, one of ozzys greatest vocal performances  3.Planet Caravan (4/5)-A slow, eerie melody   4.Iron Man (5/5)-The greatest metal song aswell as the greatest guitar riff ever  5.Electric Funeral (4/5)-a song about nuclear holocaust, great wah wah riff  6.Hand Of Doom (4/5)- breaks of into different directions throughout the song but still good  7.Rat Salad (4/5)-A guitar/Drum solo, reminds me of zeppelins \\"Moby Dick\\"  8.Fairies Wear Boots (4.5/5)-Hillarious song about ozzy trippin out on drugs and seeing \\"Faries with boots dancing with a dwarf\\"    If you like Metal, Hard rock or classic rock buy this album. If you like softer rock music than listen to this album, you might like it.    If you like this album you might also like:  Led Zeppelin-Led Zeppelin  Dio-Holy Diver  Blue Oyster Cult-Blue Oyster Cult

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Ignore all the reviewers who give this DVD a poor rating based on missing performances or poor quality.  These people are stupid.  The long and short of it, explained in the DVD booklet (which obviously far too many people failed to read) is that Live Aid was never intended to even be recorded.  Thus, there are holes in what was captured.  Yes, this means there are songs missing.  That in no way makes less of the ten hours of absoolutely breakthaking music assembled on these four discs.  It is not greed that keeps Led Zepplin's tracks from the set, but the simple fact that no footage exists of it. <br /> <br />What is here, though, is gold.  The greatest bands of the time, of EVER, even, in one box.  You will be blown away by the performances from Queen, U2, and more...  I've only just begun to watch, and it's utter genius. <br /> <br />Anyone who calls themselves a music fan owes it to themselves to buy this set.  The money raised goes to help the less fortunate - how can you possibly say no?
B000002U82|5.0|For those that are not into classic rock, there is no reason to purchase this album, and there is less reason to belittle one of, if not THE, greatest album of all time, especially using obscenely poor grammar and spelling. If you want to listen to compillations of useless sounds that express NO musical talent whatsoever, please listen to what has turned into modern \\"pop\\" and \\"hip-hop\\". If you actually want to hear something that took more than a few f-words and ten minutes with a beat-synthesizer with flahsy \\"dancing\\", buy Dark Side of the Moon. <br /> <br />For those of you who have not heard any Pink Floyd, or don't think you have, buy this album before you buy any of the rest of their albums, as this album is generally more easily appreciable than the rest of Pink Floyd's album. Also, this is what is known as a \\"concept album\\", so it should not be heard in tracks, but as a whole album, much the way the rest of Pink Floyd's albums should be heard, or like the way Sgt. Pepper's should be listened to. <br /> <br />I can't say that every song is excellent, as the album, as previously stated, is not a compillation of songs so much as one giant 42-minute song that can easily divided into tracks for radio purposes, but is best explained by dividing it into two parts: 1) before \\"Money\\", and 2) \\"Money\\" and beyond. What follows is a brief analysis of the album in those sections, but if you want a general review, just look at the stars I gave this album, and know that this is the #94 best-selling thing in music on amazon.com and is often heralded as the greatest album of all time (which I whole-heartedly agree with). \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is absolutely perfect in every way, and here's why: <br /> <br />1) The album begins with a heart-beat (\\"Speak to Me\\"), and eases its way into \\"Breathe\\", a very relaxing, excellently written opening track. This immediately cuts into \\"On the Run\\", an experimental instrumental piece that works well to build up to the first section's mainattraction: \\"Time\\". A far more angry track than the rest, \\"Time\\" is, artistically speaking, the album's best track, using the sounds of alarm clocks as a wake-up to introduce the track. It soon builds from a quite dark intro to a more heavy, classic-rock sound, ultimately climaxing with a softer sound that leads us into the closing track of the first section: \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\". The track provides a powerful vocal/instrumental (yes, she is singing without words) closing to the first section, but it is not strong enough to end the album there. <br /> <br />2) \\"Money\\" then opens up the second half, using some neat sound effects (cash-drawers opening and closing) to introduce the song, then follows with one of the most recognizeable bass-lines in all of rock. This is generally the most liked song, and is the main reason for the radio success of the album, providing some of the most quoteable, powerful lines in all of rock. \\"Us and Them\\" flows out of \\"Money\\" very well, but lacks the power and overall quality that \\"Money\\" had, making it seem like the albums sole weakness, but fits so well in the mix it is a definite positive otherwise (\\"Us and Them\\" is still and incredible song, it's just not up to the same level as the album's magnum opus, so it's bound to be a bit of a let-down). What follows is one of the most spectacular album closings of all time, with the tale of a lunatic that speaks out against society's views on \\"insanity\\" and how \\"loonies\\" should be treated (\\"Brain Damage\\"/\\"Eclipse). The end of \\"Eclipse\\" is so perfectly climaxed that satisfaction renders a brief break from all music necessary. <br /> <br />Side note: In case you hadn't heard, play this album on loop with \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" on mute. The timing is starting the album right when the MGM lion roars the third time. It's absolutely psychodellic.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I've been a long time fan of System of a Down & I know that they're an acquired taste. You really have to understand what's going on in these songs to like them...up until Mesmerize got in my hands. <br /> <br />This album is amazing...every track is hard-hitting & really, really catchy. If you liked the first single (B.Y.O.B) there is no reason why you shouldn't love this album. Even people who've said they didn't really like SOAD loved this album...believe me, the hype is real. Everything about this album will 'Mesmerize' you. <br /> <br />Some of the album's highlights (even though every track is good) are \\"B.Y.O.B\\", \\"Cigaro\\", \\"Radio/video\\", \\"Violent Pornography\\", \\"Sad Statue\\" & \\"Lost In Hollywood\\" (amazing). <br /> <br />Give it a chance...something about this album will catch your ear & I promise you won't go away empty-handed.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|If this movie tries to be satirical parody, it fails. None of the real life characters portrayed are parodied in the least, no attempt is even made to mimick their language. The closest you come to any real parody is the gibberish of other languages when the arabs say \\"mohammed jihad\\". Ha ha very witty. Well maybe Michael Moore is slightly parodied: he carries hot dogs because he's fat. The characters themselves are weak, none of them are memorable. Kim-jong il not only has the mannerisms, but also the voice of Cartman from Southpark. I expected this movie to be something it's not: a daring and funny movie with witty insights into the crazy world around us.

B0007P3582|1.0|I don't, and perhaps I'll never understand why people really enjoy listening to this. If you want great Dre beats, then listen to a Dr. Dre album. If you like good lyrics or rapping, then turn elsewhere. There are better rappers. Accept no flimsy substitutes.   <br /> <br />On Get Rich or Die Trying, 50 Cent's lyrics about his lifestyle of excess, materialism and thuggery were dwelling in CD players all over white suburbia. Here, the story remains the same. 50 Cent still revels in the environment of gangs, misogyny, violence and depravity from which he hails. On the energetic My Toy Soldiers, 50 himself says \\"Every word out my mouth is filth\\" with a string of expletives. However, 50 cent does try some topics that are constructive. For example, on Baltimore Love Thing, 50 cent talks about the power of heroin addiction. But the bad outways the good. <br /> <br />But what makes this album mediocre is that its just boring. After all, there have been rappers that turn up the \\"thug\\" factor to comic levels but have originality going for them. Here, 50 cent is traveling the long worn out road of G funk and mainstream hip hop. This is not something we haven't heard before.  <br /> <br />A bunch of the songs are just 50 rapping and \\"singing\\" along to menacing minor key string loops. Very seldomly it works, like on Outta Control, and sometimes its just repetitive. Am I the only one who notices how similar the beats for Candy Shop and Just a Lil Bit are? Occasionally, things get funky, but beats are little without good rapping. And IMO, 50 cent very rarely delivers on that front.  <br /> <br />That being said, I have nothing against those who like 50 cent. And, I'm not one to slam all rap as crap(at least not anymore), but this is. 50 cent's The Massacre is just mediocre in every sense of the word. While not being the king of the crap, it's not too far above the abyss.
1592400876|4.0|In my opinion, grammar has always been an under-taught and under appreciated facet of English education. This book seeks to change that. Lynn Truss offers the reader a passionate look at apostrophes, commas, and spelling, while mixing in a good dose of her witty British humor. If you don't catch on or even crack the faintest smile while reading the title, you really shouldn't even open the book. However, this book shouldn't be seen as one targeted to grammar junkies. She makes the prospect of becoming proficient with grammar worthwhile.<br /><br />  While citing sloppiness and laziness as common attributes of \\"mispunctuators,\\" Truss argues that the Internet Era has dramatically dampened the importance of punctuation. I like how she brings to light the notion of \\"sticklers.\\" While there has always been a negative connation associated with the word \\"stickler\\" as being obsessed with something, she sees one who is carefully honing their writing craft. My favorite passage from \\"Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation\\" perfectly depicts who Truss is targeting this book toward. She writes, \\"No matter that you have a PhD and have read all of Henry James twice. If you still persist in writing, `Good food at it's best,' you deserve to be struck by lightning, hacked up on the spot and buried in an unmarked grave.\\"

038551123X|1.0|A serial killer who helps the police solve murders?? Didn't we have that character last millenium in Hannibal Lecter??  And like Lecter's creator Thomas Harris, Jeff Lindsay becomes an apologist for serial killers with logic that goes something like this: \\"If you've been badly abused as a child, and you attempt to appease your homicidal psychoses created by this abuse by killing people that you deem worthy of death by torture, then it's acceptable to be a serial killer.\\"  PLEASE!!  Harris made a mistake when he tried to rationalize the monster Lecter's bestial nature by explaining it away as the result of torture by the Nazis.  Lindsay tries to convince the reader to wallow in his psychopath's unapologetic killings by turning him into a nihilistic crimefighter.  Neither explanation works. <br /> <br />I only made it through the first third of the book, so if I missed some major shift in character later on, others will doubtless take me to task.
068987474X|1.0|This book gives misleading information about men who are already in relationships.  It claims that a man will string-along his girlfriend while he waits for someone 'better' to come along.  The reality is, that most men just take longer to make relationship commitments than women do.  Research in psychology and neuroscience confirms this.  Most mature men do actually want commitments.  Many a woman who reads this book now believes that her boyfriend is 'just not that into her', when really, her guy is just on a different timeline.   <br /> <br />*I recommend books like \\"What Could He Be Thinking? How a Man's Mind Really Works\\" by Michael Gurian, and also the work of John Gray.  Books such as these provide well-researched* insights into understanding men and relationships.   <br />Lastly, I think it's a shame that a Hollywood t.v. writer can parade around as if he were an expert in human behavior, and receive so much positive attention for it!
B000050FEN|5.0|I think the only way a sequel to Se7en can work is if they go on the premise that John Doe had a partner. I get this from the taxicab scene in front of the police station. I mean, how could the guy call down a cab, all bloody, hop in, be carried to the police station without the taxi driver saying anything or calling the cops? You can see as John Doe gets out of the cab that he has no coat or anything to cover up the blood. He just hops out and walks on into the station. I think John Malkovich would make a great secret partner.  <br /> <br />Also, Morgan Freeman has to come back. Freeman was in his late 50s when he made the first one. Now his heading toward 70. That's a problem too. Also David Fincher has to return also (if he returns Freeman will be back for sure). Maybe even a cameo by Brad Pitt's Det. Mill's (maybe from a mental institution or jail)? Also, they have to get Andrew Kevin Walker (came up with the first movie/screenplay) back to at least give his touch to the screenplay.  <br /> <br />Or they could take it from what John Doe said about his \\"plan\\" being studied and pondered over. Some nut takes over and copycats.
B0002S947K|5.0|This album blew me away from the second I put it in my cd player. It has such intense feeling and emotion. Trouble is beautiful and I know it will stay in my cd player for a long time to come. You have to buy this record, if you don't you will never know what you are missing. This guy is pure genius.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|This CD is one of Robert Plants best of new and original material.  He continues to incorporate world music influences though it is enhanced with blues that rocks and brings down the house.  The ballads are reflective and passionate.  While there is not the usual love-hate relationship-type lyrics, this is a welcome change and, as he remarked in a recent \\"Rolling Stone\\"  article, he is at a \\"golden\\" time in his life.  This maturity shows.  This is not to disregard earlier material but it does  indicate that he seems serious, mellow and, yet, still has the ability to live life to the fullest at his time in life.  Many people his age (celebrity or not) seem to give up and stay in a complacent frame of mind. I have admired his music for many years (with and without Led Zeppelin). It has had a profound impact on my life through good times and bad.  I highly recommend his latest CD.      \\"Another Tribe\\" - This song, like many others on this CD, has North African groove to it though rhythmically and electronically.  It is evident that Robert has given a lot of thought to the future of the state of the world today.    \\"Shine It All Around\\" - The music almost seems reminescent of \\"Dreamland\\" and \\"Fate of Nations\\" CDs.  However, Robert pleads for all of us to be kind and show love to each other.  The vocals in this and all tracks are outstanding. What can I say?    \\"Freedom Fries\\" - The bendir is definitely prominent on this track.  The lyrics are Robet's reflections on the whole Middle East situation and questions he seems to have concerning it.  This sounds bluesy and upbeat in spite of the serious nature of the lyrics.    \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" - Techno meets the world through a higher power.  This is one of my favorite tracks.  The lyrics seem to discuss superficial people and their lack of sincerity in their views.  He comments on the quest for knowledge and the need to grow as a person in his life.  Musically, this is hypnotic but not to the point of being too overdone or stuffy.    \\"All The King's Horses\\" - Robert seems very comfortable, yet fearless during this semi-acoustic ballad.  The instrumentation is tranquil.  The more I listen to this CD I think this is possibly his testimony to Christianity, or other spiritual quest.  I'm not being critical I'm merely curious.    \\"The Enchanter\\" - The lyrics seem to suggest the fascination with all things spiritual - contemplation, devotion, good vs. evil, temptation, etc.  Musically, this is simply mystical.    \\"Takambra\\" - Robert's lyrics on this track seem to question what he may feel are the myths of freedom, especially in America (but could also be the world at large).  The music here seems to have a Moroccan feel to it.    \\"Dancing In Heaven\\" - It seems that Robert's lyrics encourage the listener to reach out for all that is good or contemplation on the Second Coming.  In this politically correct society, it's sad that words have to be chosen carefully to the point of being vague.  Mid to late 1960's semi-folk influences give this track an artistic move forward with a positive sound.  Myself and others have made comments about how music today has gotten away from originality. It's nice to know that Robert's music continues to blend the old and the new with much innovation.    \\"Somebody Knocking\\" - This blues-based tune has Rober's lyrics seem to be expressing his fight to stay positive in the face of evil.  This track also has an acoustic feel of street musicians of Morocco. I've never been there, but I have a CD of Moroccan music and also, it sounds like a variation of \\"City Don't Cry\\" from \\"No Quarter Unledded\\" with Jimmy Page.    \\"Let The Four Winds Blow\\" - With this track, Rober's lyrics seem to say come what may no matter what.  They also seems to say there comes a time when a person shouldn't sweat the small stuff and accept changes with a brave attitude.  The music sounds like Chicago blues in a way.    \\"Mighty Rearranger\\" - The title track; lyrically seems to say that the Master has helped him cope with changes in his life and not to feel uncertain about the future.  The blues on this tune seems to have a Missippi Delta feel to like John Lee Hooker or Robert Johnson.    \\"Brother Ray\\" - It's the shortest track on the CD (when I first listened to it). Then I realized it stops and blends into the \\"Shine It All Around/\\"Tin Pan Valley\\" Remix. I think it might be a musical expression of his tribute to the late Ray Charles.  The music seems to be a variation of \\"Wha'd I Say\\" with a laid back Moroccan acoustic rhythm.    \\"Tin Pan Valley\\" (Remix) - I'm not sure of the exact title since it wasn't listed after \\"Brother Ray\\" on the back cover sleeve of my copy of the CD. \\"Is this a remix of both \\"Shine It All Around\\" and \\"Tin Pan Valley\\"?  Is that the case on the cover or is there an error on my copy of the CD cover sleeve?  Anyway, the techno remix is great with a world beat.    Again, this CD is a must have item. Rober's band The Strange Sensation sounds tight and seem to share his musical vision.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Nu metal burst onto the scene in the 90's at least thats when I became aware of the style.  System of a Down was one of the biggest nu metal bands, the band grew sonically from the first to the second, the third was a compilation of unreleased songs, which led to a lack of flow.  On Mezmerize, Darin, the guitarist, steps up and contributes a large amount of the vocals.  I prefer Darin's voice to Serj's, this cd is shows how much the band has progressed since Toxicity.  From start to finish Mezmerize does not dissapoint, the only fault with the cd is its length, clocking in at under 37 minutes, which is the average for a system of a down CD, but the music is so good, that its difficult to be fully satisfied knowing another cd is coming out this year.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album is as close to perfect as most bands could wish to get, and Green Day has just blown away a world of music listeners.  Whether you are a die hard fan or have never listened to them before, this cd will take your breath away.  It starts off with the awesome Bush bashing American Idiot, then slides into one of two 9 plus minute songs on the disk, which are both brilliantly written stories that are so good that you completely forget how long they are.  Not too many other bands could put together one song that was over nine minutes long that would be worthwhile to listen to, but Green Day has two.  Every song on this disk just plain rocks, and I would not be suprised if every one saw time on the radio before it is over.  I cannot even pick a favorite song from this cd, they are all so good.  Green Day is officially gone from the California kids named after a 24 hour marijuana binge who sing about chronic masturbation to being the biggest band in rock.  And just think, before they put this cd together, Green Day was thinking of breaking up.  What a tradgedy that would have been.  When they talk about some of the greatest cds in rock history, Green Day's American Idiot will not be far from the top.
B00064MW6A|1.0|<br /> <br /> <br />Oh and about CATWOMAN; whatever you do; do. not. watch. this. movie. It was the most horrible movie made on an anti-protagonist Comic book character in the world. The entire focus of the movie was Halle Berry wearing that stupid strip-dancers costume with a mask that had cat ears on it and implied sexual content or sexual content.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The movie had no plot whatsoever (I happen to own pet cats and the movie puts cats name's to shame!), and they changed Catwoman's name from Selena Kyle to Patience Price (also they weren't in Gothom City). Also Benjamin Bratt was a cop in the movie and played Halle's love interest, Sharon Stone played a vain villain who created a facial make up that permanently damages the face.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Halle Berry happens to stumble in on Sharon stone's ploy to keep this from whomever authorizes skin care cream to be on the market and gets killed for it. She then is gifted with special catlike powers by a 1.0000 year old cat that an old lady owns. After being explained what happened to her, Patience (grrr!) goes out and decides to steal a necklace she had her eye on for quiet sometime (she beats up a bunch of crooks in the process), then proceeds to get her revenge on Sharon Stone's lackeys and then Sharon stone herself.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />And the CGI in the movie is horrible, Halle Berry's CGI animated self looked plastic and unrealistic. Its a really bad movie that was saying; Cat-women like cops instead of BATMAN! They put Catwoman to shame with that B-movie! If want to watch a movie with Catwoman then watch the very old Batman Returns (staring Michael Keaton and Michelle Pfeiffer) *Mutters angrily, incoherently* [a 1 out of 5] <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002858YS|5.0|This album is definitely a must buy for any fan of the new generation of alternative rock, and any fan of good music in general.  The Killers have really created a jem here, this album is good from top to bottom.  The high points are definitely Somebody Told Me, Mr. Brightside, and Smile Like You Mean It, but all the songs are awesome.  Brendan Flowers is a genius, and his use of the synthesizer really helps set this disk apart from all the other alternative rock bands out there.
B000089RVR|4.0|<br />I was rather skeptical with the release of Dido's second CD \\"Life for rent.\\" I kept telling myself it would probably be just like P!nk's second CD: Not as good with only a couple of good songs, however I soon realized that comparing a wonderful vocalist, songwriter, and musician to P!nk was a true insult to Dido's talent so I picked up the Second release and gave it a try. It took me awhile to get used to this sound of her music on Life for rent being all new to be and taken in a different direction, but I got used to it after 3 times and now I'm hooked and waiting for her next release.  <br /> <br /> <br />By far the best tracks on this CD has to be White flag, Life for rent, Don't leave home, Who makes you feel, which as a very cool and jazzy beat to it that make it enjoyable to listen to despite the suggestive lyrics, Sand in my shoes, a more light hearted song on the soundtrack. And lastly, This land is mine, and See the sun/The closer you get.  <br /> <br /> <br />The other tracks on the CD; Stoned, See you when your forty, Mary's in India, and Do you have a little time, aren't bad but aren't as moving and compelling as the other tracks on CD which is saying something coming from me, because I loved almost the entire NO ANGEL CD. All in all Life for rent shapes up to be one enjoyable CD with its share of flaws, but this should not suggest that its a bad purchase. If you loved NO ANGEL then this will be just as enjoyable and listenable as the first one. ---- [a 4 out of 5]

0140177396|5.0|As a senior in high school, looking back, Of Mice and Men has always been the book that has stood out to me.  It has taught me that not everyone is living what is known as the \\"American Dream\\".  <br />The two main characters, Lennie and George show a typical close-nit friendship with hardships, goals and memories.  As complete opposites they still have their mind set on the life they've always wanted, a farm with the freedom to enjoy the wealth of their own efforts. Throughout the story you learn to grow and love both of these characters despite the many upsetting situations and consequences. <br />All of the characters in the novel in some way show their need of a companion to satisfy their lonliness and the dreams of a greater life. Steinbeck's beautiful flow and obvious foreshadowing is what keeps a reader intrigued. <br />This book not only has a wonderful plot and storyline, it teaches people of all ages the lessons of life. We will never meet the American Dream no matter what the circumstance is, it is impossible to have the American Dream of pure satisfaction, complete freedom, and the \\"perfect world\\". <br />This book will always remain as my favorite novel, it exemplifies the power of dreams, a desire for companionship, what we want and what we'll never get to have in our own existance. The American Dream is unattainable.

B000003TAL|5.0|well... after listening to this album 50 times atleast it hit me 1 time in study hall what i was listening to, this is one of the most influencial albums ive ever listened to, i have evol and goo, but i still think this is their best. I didnt like it the first 30 times i listened to it, but it kept me coming back, then after awhile.... it hit me, this is AMAZING. im into jazz, fusion, and a little bit of rock. i think this is really an album any music fan could benifit from. You might not like it the first time u hear it, but to truely appreciate it you need to give it alot of tries. Sonic Youth not really a talented guitar band (i play guitar so usually it matters) but instead of having guitar talent they add in things that arent plesent to the ear, or something totally melodic, You can call it a \\"Noise\\" rock revolution. Buy this album, its worth it...  I used to listen to Teenage Riot which i thought was a great song, and when i listened to the rest, i was liek what is this crap.... But key truely enjoying this album is to listen to it alot before you just think u bought a horrible album. :)
0553278223|5.0|\\"The Martian Chronicles\\" is an incredible work of imagination by one of the Giants of Science Fiction.  It is a combination of some previously published shorter works (in some cases altered a bit to fit with the other stories in the collection), and some newer pieces.  The book as a whole was first published in May of 1950, with the earliest story first published in June of 1948. <br /> <br />Few writers in any genre can make the reader really feel the way Bradbury can.  Here he blends longer works, with shorter vignettes, to lay a rich tapestry to the overall book.  The longer works tend to be about specific individuals or groups, while the shorter pieces deal with society and the environment, and they set the overall tone and feel of the book.  One of my personal favorites is \\"There Will Come Soft Rains\\" in which Bradbury effectively delivers his message with no characters. <br /> <br />Several of the stories included in this book, also are related to other short fiction that Bradbury has written but that doesn't appear in this book.  For example, \\"Usher II\\" (originally published as \\"Carnival Of Madness\\") clearly comes after \\"The Exiles\\" (originally published as \\"The Mad Wizards Of Mars\\"), and \\"Way In The Middle Of The Air\\" clearly comes before \\"The Other Foot\\".  Both \\"The Exiles\\" and \\"The Other Foot\\" appear in \\"The Illustrated Man\\".
B00005HYHC|2.0|I saw the movie soon after high school and was duly impressed:  the animation was spectacular.  The movie was dark story concerning the growing emotional detachment and isolation of a rock star, Pink, who gradually descends into a fantasy world of fascist leanings.  Perfect stuff for highschool I thought and a story that lent iself very well to the big screen.  However, even though Pink Floyd was one of my favorite bands since Meddle, I never bought the album.  I'd heard it to death from my friends and though I was impressed at first, I became less so with each subsequent listen.  The Wall has a lot of problems, both in its scope and in its execution.  As a larger work, the concept is derivative of the Pretty Things far superior SF Sorrow (the first rock opera):  the alienation of a boy who loses his father in WWII and his emotional breakdown.  Musically, most of the songs with a few exceptions (Comfortably Numb is among their best works) seem to be filler: they perhaps further the storyline but aren't that compelling. In fact many are dull.  Perhaps this has something to do with the fact that Roger Waters hogged the song writing and prevented Rick Wright from making any musical contribution what so ever, which led to his leaving the group during the recording. Perhaps this has something to do with the over the top production of Bob Ezrin, surely the most overrated producer on the planet.<br /><br />Pink Floyd for me have since the Syd Barret days been primarily about the music, which was often groundbreaking and moving.  I've never given their lyrics as much weight although some were excellent, but for me they've always been secondary to the music.  With the Wall the lyrics are the main focus, the music takes a backseat and the album suffers for it.  There is a tremendous amount of filler music whose only purpose is to act as a backdrop to the lyrics/storyline.  With some notable exceptions, the music is either weak piano noodlings or overly theatrical bombast with little subtlety.  Which of course something that producer Bob Ezrin is known for.  Most importantly The Wall just doesn't sound like Pink Floyd.  After the wonderfully complex and even darker Animals, I expected more of the same sonic density, but instead I got what is essentially a Roger Waters solo album with help from the other Floydians and studio musicians.<br /><br />The plot of the Wall is unoriginal and just too long and ultimately boring.  It's just so much puerile pop-psychology about building an emotional wall because school sucks, Dad died and Mom is overprotective and then tearing the wall down, who cares?  The Wall doesn't move me at all, it's story pretentions are too facile, it's music too showtune grandiose to move me in any significant emotional way.  Unlike previous Pink Floyd albums, the Wall sounds childish, not childlike, and less adult.  It's whiny, self absorbed and worst of all maudlin.  There's a silly and cinematic or theatrical drama to the whole thing that I find very unappealing and cartoonish.  As a movie the Wall was more successful because of the visual element and tremendous animation, but as an album, well...  The music isn't very interesting: its mostly filler and bombast, and the storyline is just so much depressing and self-absorbed navel gazing.  Just get over your pathetic rock star self Rog.  After the Wall the Floyd as far as I was concerned was over, they never did anything that interesting again and Roger Waters solo career has been one bomb after another.  The Wall marks the death of Pink Floyd as a viable band.  Download it or rip it from a friend.with little subtlety.  Which of course something that producer Bob Ezrin is known for.

B000002P2V|3.0|How the mighty had fallen.  When this album came out I thought it was only OK. In all honesty the Who seemed to be on the decline, creatively and musically.  The spark that made them great was almost gone. Townsend was beset by his personal demons, Daltry didn't seem to care to interpret the lyrics in any other way but bombastic, Entwistle, well he's still the Ox.  And then there's the most tragic of the the four: Keith Moon.  He just didn't have the energy, motivation or ability to play the drums anymore.  When he was healthy the man was one of the greats, on this album he's sad and sloppy.  If Who Are You was the first time somebody heard Keith Moon they just wouldn't get what all the praise was about.  He died soon after the albums release from an overdose of a prescription drug designed to keep him from abusing alcohol.  I think he was 32, sad.<br /><br />Unfortunately the music on Who Are You is as tired as the men playing it.  None of the songs rate among their best material and to be fair none are particularly bad either. But the performances sound phoned in, and the mix and arrangements are simultaneously weak and overblown. The guitar tone is brittle with little power, and there is an overabundance of emasculatingly twinkly, prettified synthesizers that sap the energy right out of almost every track. These songs demand some Townsend power chords and he doesn't deliver. Punk rockers were then calling the seventies dinosaur bands like the Who and Led Zeppelin boring old farts and Townsend and company do little on this album to dispell the slander. Daltry sings with all the sensitivity of a drunken football hooligan and completely ignores the emotional nuances that the lyrics demand.  Moony as stated before is pathetic.  Entwistle is just OK and Townsend is more involved with questioning his own artistic relevance than rocking, tarts up every song with gobs of synth and forgets about the guitar.  Who Are You could have been much better but The Who's lackluster effort killed my interest in the band. I remember listening to Black Flag and the Dammed at a friend's house and then playing Who Are You.  What a difference, Who Are You sounded so tinny and had an almost baroque fussiness about it whereas  Black Flag's Jealous Again and the Dammeds first album were so much more immediate and exciting.  After Moon died the Kenny Jones era band produced some good music, but their energy level continued to wane as did my interest.  Punk rock, metal, post punk and new wave (whatever that is) came along and I just didn't care much about the Who anymore.killed my interest in the band.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I was very fortunate to recieve this album a few days before its release, so I've had little time to sit down and fully listen to this fantastic album.  This cd has proven to be different from System's in the past.  Mezmerize has a pure and oringinal angle to it.  I would think that those who liked System from Toxicity might be a little dissapointed because that cd was, shall I say, more commercial or mellow, also great all the same.  Mezmerize has that heavy crazy feeling that was present in their self titled, but has a more melodic aspect added.  Something very different on this album is that the guitarist Darron sings a lot more, in some cases is the lead vocalist (lost in hollywood).  I love the fact that he is singing more because he has a great vioce and when combined with Serj, the melodic hormoneys are amazing.  Other then the radio hit 'B.Y.O.B.', other songs that are my favorite are 'Radio/Video' that has funny polka feel, 'Old School Hollywood' that's just plan heavy and fun, and 'Lost In Hollywood' which is one of System's softer songs, but that obsolutely leaves you stunned.  Over all I give this album 5 stars for it's overall greatness.  I can't remember the last time an album made me want to drive friends home so that I could show them the cd, and for me to listen to it more.  Hopfully you will like it as much as I have and be left with the same felling, Mezmerized!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I don't normally bother reviewing albums, and all the reviews so far will run similar to this.. but i'm meant to be revising for finals so instead i thought i'd clear a few things up for that ignorant t**ser, 'MR.Kid Van Winkle'.  <br /> <br />1. i quote, 'I Will be glad when these pre-grunge posers leave'. Pre-grunge? no i think you mean 'post', refering to after the musical movement termed grunge eg. Nirvana, soundgarden, pearl jam, alice in chains.     <br /> <br />2. If your going to thrash like Slayer, then do it. If your going to mix rock and rap like Anthrax, then do it...  <br />Or if your goin to blend metal, armenianfolk and catchy melody then do it and then you have SOAD. Do you completly miss the point. YOu say system 'spew noise', but compared to bands you have reviewed like pantera, slayer etc... system hold a much softer side. So you can't even justify this on the basis you don't listen to any heavy music. (thats no attack on pantera etc. RIP dimebag).  <br /> <br />3. 'hammering out 2 word sentences song after song after song after album after album after album is so lame'. Where? when? come on justify yourself... lets have an objective review not just an ignorant redkneck spouting s**t because he has some inane idea that he's decended from a the Knights templar and as a freemason embodies some great power where he can say what he likes without reason !!! <br /> <br />sorry... i got sidetraked, as for the album <br />best since self-titled for me, much more precise than toxicity and obviously more structured than Steal this album. Great to see system keeping the trademark style while adding to it, armenian folk and some 80's synth mixed with tight, tight death metal riffs and scitzophrenic vocals mixing mike patton and phil anselmo!!! what more can u ask for! <br />Think hypnotise will tie it all up nicely for System!!! <br />lets give Kid Van Winkle's review to Darron etc.. bet they'd write a killer track about it!!! <br />
B00001W9G0|1.0|What a dreadful bore.  If this movie were rated in z's, it would be rated zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz.... <br />How anyone ever came to love Barbara Steisand, I'll never know.   <br />Talk about preachy! omg, what a harpy!  I will gladly admit she was enjoyable in Meet the Fockers, however. <br /> <br />Thank you Turner Classic Movie channel for saving me the $ of purchasing this DVD. <br />Run, don't walk, away from this sappy borefest.
B00003BDXG|1.0|oliver stone is overrated with every movie he has ever made.  this movie is a sugar coated piece of action.. the hype led me to believe this was going to be a great movie that doesn't hold back.  and it does hold back, and it comes across as lame.  there is no story and bad acting..   ooooo there is a bunch of f bombs..  good job oliver stone, go try to ruin the doors' image  again
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Keeping it short and sweet is a format that other bands should look into. Nearly four years after the release of toxicity, these guys drop this record that cashes in at 36 minutes and has eleven tracks. If you're looking for radio hit type songs like \\"toxicity\\" and \\"aerials\\", fortunately, they are nowhere to be found. These guys just said screw it, and wrote the most hardcore, honest record they have ever done. Daron Malakian (guitar) wrote just about everything on this album, with the exception of a few lyrical collaborations with Serj. And John Dolmayan continues to be one of the most innovative drummers on the scene. I bought this four days ago and it hasn't left my cd player yet. I would name the good songs on the record, but it would be shorter to list the songs that weren't good. I have regained full faith in these guys and I can't wait for the follow up \\"Hypnotize.\\"
B00009P1O0|5.0|this is my favorite neil young record.  i am so glad that it has been rereleased.  it is smooth music to sit back and enjoy on a cloudy day, or while you are falling asleep, or a sunny summer afternoon on the beach!  neil young is awesome..relax
0670033375|5.0|Professor Diamond has written an informative and mind-expanding book.  As he ponders the question of how decisions in a culture effect their survival, he invites you to question our present world situation and he inspires the reader to do something.  This book heightened my awareness of environmental degradation and how one can help change the direction of our present environmental policies.  I really learn a great deal from his writings.  I enjoyed \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\".  This one is a challenging but illuminating read!!!
6301763041|5.0|Firstly I would like to ask- how the heck is this film rated a 15?! My daughter watched it with me, she is 3- yes, 3- and she adores it now. She asks me to watch it several times a day!  <br />I have loved this film since I was around 12 and watched it with my friend over and over 'till the original tape broke. It isn't deep, it doesn't have a message and the plot has more holes in it then finest Emmenthal. But it's one of the silliest, funniest films I have ever seen and I never tire of watching it (I'm 25 now...) The spontaneous dancing, the cheesy lines, the stereotypes- I love every minute of this cr*p. There's a traitorous mouse, a helicopter hijacking, a Swedish milkmaid, Ricki Lake giving birth to what appears to be a 3- month- old infant in the back of a speeding car, Traci Lords (ex- porn star) in a cartoon bear suit and even Iggy Pop in a tiny tin bath \\"buck nekkid\\". But don't worry, there's no rudeness, no swearing and no aggressive violence- it's all very much of the Tom and Jerry variety. If you like meaningful films that stir your soul and deliver a 'message', buy this and use it as a doorstop- but if you have a juvenile sense of humour (like mine) and don't take things too seriously, watch this every day!
B00004XMS0|3.0|I watched every episodesx of cartoon series when I was grew up. here my thoughts <br /> <br />1. Batman(1989)- After Beetlejuice, Burton and Keaton teamed up for Batman saga. Keaton as Batman.  It got the first Batman/Joker(Jack Nicholson) duel. Involving with Vicki Vale(Kim Bagniser). Great, Tim. 5/5 <br />2. Batman Returns(1992)- Burton and Keaton are back. Keaton again as Batman. Bruce got interset with Selina Kyle, who is Catwoman(Michelle Pfeffier). Also team-up of Penguin(Danny Devito) and Max Shreck(Christopher Walken). Great, Tim. 5/5 <br />3. Batman Forever(1995)- No Burton and Keaton team-up. Joel stepped in with Val Kilmer as Batman and Chris O'Donnel as Robin. Team up of Two-Face(Tommy Lee Jones) and The Riddlers(crazy-funny Jim Carrey). Hook up with this so-called doctor(Nicole Kidman). Didn't like Kilmer's characterize to Bruce. Setting of Gotham has change. What's up with this, Joel. 2/5 <br />4. Batman & Robin(1997)- Joel returned with George Clooney as Batman, O'Donnel returns as Robin and an appeartance of Batgirl. Why she's Alfred's niece instead Gordon's daughter? Clooney was the worst. Teamed up of Freeze(Arnold the governor), Poison Ivy and an appearance of Bane. Parts of it was worst and the woman for Bruce, please. What were you thinking, Joel. 2/5 <br />In my opinon, Selina is perfect for Bruce. The saga continues in 2005 with Batman Begins. It brings Scarecrow.
1400043662|5.0|As you can see from the other reviews, this is a complex work that seems to have even staunch fans of Murakami torn over whether it indicates growth or regression. As you can guess from my rating, I'm definitely a fan of this piece. <br /> <br />Much like The Wind-up Bird Chronicles, I was continually finding myself jarred, and my frame of mind shaken by the ethereal substance of this book. Murakami finds ways to expose his characters to the most bizarre of psychological phenomena while managing to drag the reader along, half convinced such an episode might just truly happen. I think the core of the book lies in a comment that Oshima makes, about what the world would be like if exteriors were interiors of a person, and the true substance an exterior. Many have touched on the endearing qualities of Nakata, but I was just as enthralled by the tragic Miss Seiki (Psyche?), and enigmatic Oshima.  <br /> <br />I'm still finding difficulty, having just finished, in fully formulating the impact and power of this piece in words. Following the advise of the character, Sada, I will not bother to continue attempting to force into words what cannot be described ... at least, outside of the full-length allegory that is Kafka on the Shore.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|sure, this album is pretty good, i love soad. but any hardcore soad fan will agree this doesn't even come close to matching the bands first 2 albums which still amaze me today.
B000002UVX|5.0|Anyone who thinks Hendrix was in musical decline in the last few months of his life has not listened to this. It is true that drugs were beginning to take their toll, but this album shows Hendrix as a pioneering artist at the peak of his ability. Band of Gypsys also features Billy Cox on bass, and Buddy Miles on drums. With Hendrix and two other brothers, you just can't go wrong. And they didn't. This concert revealed a bold new direction for Hendrix - a more funk and groove oriented music, but not lacking the spacy and soulful psychedelia that characterized all of his playing.
B0000028RR|5.0|Ok first of all, I'm very cautious on throwing 5 stars out. But this album, Rage's first album from 1992, deserves each bit of these 5 shiney stars for their debut album. <br /> <br />First off, this is the best Rage album out there. It's obvious everything by Rage is good (even \\"Renegades\\" and they didn't even write those songs) but the self-titled debut stands out as the funkiest, most aggressive and most meaningful Rage album out of their catalogue. The songs are complex and well timed, each song is brilliant, each song is just as angry as the next(especially the closer, \\"Freedom\\" where Zach is absolutely screaming \\"freedom\\" from the bottom of his heart) and Tom's guitar playing is superb. This album probably shows Tom at his best, crazy unique solo's, great riffs, he's all over the place on this album. Tim's bass playing is excellent as well, funky, and aggressive, sticking tight with the drums (as the way it should be). The cover of this album means serious business as well, remember, this was Rage Against the Machine's first album, and looking at this cover added drama and suspense to who these guys were. You take a look at the cover and your first impression of this masterpiece is anger and (obviously) politics. What you hear, is what you get, violent, pissed off, meaningful, and straight from the heart. Especially with some lyrics, like Zach's veiw on \\"Fistful of Steel\\", \\"Silence, something about silence makes me sick, 'cause silence can bring violence sorta like a slit wrist.\\"  <br /> <br />This is an excellent album, one of the best in alternative rock music. If you settle for this album now, you'll settle for it later.
B0002XDODU|4.0|I listened to this album once-through on my way home from work yesterday, and I've listened to the first half again already.  If you like Rammstein, you'll like the album.  If you don't like Rammstein, obviously you won't like the album.  This is Rammstein doing what they do, and doing it well.  That's not to say that it is merely a rehash of their previous albums, it's merely to say that Rammstein (like all bands) have a sound.  They like that sound, I can only assume they enjoy writing songs with that sound, and so they are continuing that sound.  Having said that, there are some slight changes here.  I've always felt there has been a subtle progression throughout Rammstein's career from album-to-album, and that's definitely present here if you know where to listen.  There are a few stand-out tracks that vary slightly from the 1-2-1-2 chomping canter that we're so used to hearing from this band.  I remember one track had some kind of instrument that sounded like a harmonica on crack or something.  There was even a track with what sounded like an acoustic/electric.  There are also tracks with some different riff styles/guitar effects from these guys.  There was one song in particular (I forget which) that had almost a \\"waltzy\\" feel to it or something.  I dunno what it is about Rammstein's music, but once I saw them live I felt like I \\"got it\\" more.  They've just always struck me as honest guys honestly making the kind of music they enjoy making.
B00003CX5P|1.0|I remember when this movie came out because it was arguably the best theater experience in my life. For months the hype had been building to a fever pitch, as me and my friends battled in the front yard with light-sabers, played the soundtracks constantly, read the Star Wars books, downloaded the trailers, and talked ENDLESSLY in speculation. And what with the media hype and advertising campaigns... well you get the idea. Then of course there was the opening night.<br /><br />I waited in line for hours for a good seat, and that's only because my friends had been waiting in line for me since around 6:00 AM. When the people in from the previous showing came out there were cheers and screams so loud you couldn't hear yourself think (and earlier in the day my friends made the cover a newspaper with their cheering and cardboard sign holding {honk if you love Star Wars!}). When at last I finally got IN, the theater was packed with something like 300 people who were clapping their hands and stamping their feet BEFORE the movie started. I was so blown by the visuals (special effects), sound editing, fight scenes ect. that I saw the movie ELEVEN times in the theater!<br /><br />Then my enthusiasm lessoned. I figured out what everyone meant when they talked about the wooden acting (the kid who plays Anakin is the worst, but the Queen is pretty bad too), bad dialog (Jar Jar is so bad it hurts my head), and a THIN plot. Above all, this film is badly directed. Scenes that could be cool instead feel forced, and lifeless. Every moment in the film is loaded with eye-candy, and eventually you may figure out (as I did) that without the eye-candy, there is NOTHING HAPPENING 90% of the time. No intrigue, no character development, nothing.<br /><br />Of course almost every film has its good points. I'll say it again, AWESOME visuals. Sweet sound edited and not a bad sountrack (duel of the fates was sweet, no arguements there). Our new Obi-Wan was easily the best thing about the movie, and was totally believable in the role. Old senator Palpatine's manuevering and manipulating is great stuff. And Darth Maul, the guy with like two lines and only one purpose in the film (look evil, look scarey, try to kill the good guys, impress the audience, die) puts up one heck of a cool fight against our two jedi at the end of the film. Oh, and the fight choreography is sweet too, with the jedi knights slicing through droids like a hot knife through melting butter. But that does NOT a good movie make.<br /><br />This movie is a must have on one condition. If you have a great sound system and a huge high-def TV the sweet visuals and sound edits will definitely please as far as picture and sound tests go. Just go straight to one of the battle scenes (or my favorite, the pod race), and crank up the volume. Nice.<br /><br />At any rate, there are people who will love anything with the Star Wars name plastered on it no matter WHAT it is. This is one of those things. Personally I thought both of the prequels have been incredible disappointments compared to what they coulde have been. If you want more Star Wars and you're a serious fan, read some of the expanded universe books, play Knights of the Old Republic or one of the Jedi Knight games, or watch the excellent Clone Wars cartoons released by Cartoon Network. Just don't watch this one expecting greatness. It is not there.nd was totally believable in the role. Old senator Palpatine's manuevering and manipulating is great stuff.

B000929AJQ|4.0|In a time where a dying industrial scene is littered with obscure lyrics, over-abused voice effects, and chaotic songs with no real direction, its nice to breathe the fresh air that this album brings. <br /> <br />All of the old NIN grit is there, with a few new twists to keep it fresh.  The more I listen to this album the more i can't stop listening to it.  I'd recommend it to harcore NIN fans and newcomers alike. <br /> <br />The only reason the album got 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the drab song \\"The Collector\\" and that it seems that in some places Trent's lyrics feel sub-par. <br /> <br />The highlight of the album? \\"Right Where It Belongs.\\" One of the most beautiful songs I've heard in a long time.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|There is a legend surrounding the old opera house in Paris.  The story goes that some creature lives downstairs demanding things of its owner.  They must pay him rent and star his protegee, Christine.  But as the Phantom is finally showing himself to Christine, she is falling for another man.  And the new owners think they don't have to listen to the Phantom.  These events will force the Phantom to take action and his true nature to be seen by all.<br /><br />I've only seen the stage play once, so I went into this movie with very little expectations and no baggage.  I was very impressed.  There is a jaw dropping scene as we first move from the \\"modern\\" era black and white to the color setting of the story.  The costumes and sets are fantastic, bring the story to life in a way not possible on stage.  Yes, events from the play occur in different orders, but over all, the story is still preserved.  The music, including the new song, is still outstanding.<br /><br />So what's my complaint?  It's the same one I have with the stage version.  The Phantom is made out to be sympathetic.  This is even truer here as we see his past as a little boy.  The problem is he's an evil man whose true nature comes out the more people stand up to him.  I realize I'm alone in not enjoying this glorification.  At least he does realize how bad his behavior has been near the end.<br /><br />Overall, this is a wonderful musical brought to life beautifully on screen.  Stage purists won't like it, but the rest of us will be able to enjoy this outstanding musical.
B0007GAERG|5.0|I've never really been a fan of Mariah Carey, although I never denied her talent she really didn't impress me until 2001 with her Glitter which everyone says is her weak point. But with The Emancipation of Mimi I'll be going to see Mariah the first chance I get. With the lofty title THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI, it's clear that Mariah Carey wants listeners to know she's releasing an important record. Here she aims to reveal an aspect of herself that has previously been held back by career missteps and tabloid-worthy drama. It's refreshing, then, that 2005's EMANCIPATION returns the focus to Carey's remarkable voice, as the singer makes her most focused record in over a decade. <br /> <br />Carey opens the album by exhibiting some of the most sincerely soulful vocals of her career on the one-two punch of the up-tempo \\"It's Like That\\" and the beautiful ballad \\"We Belong Together.\\" Her able voice expertly complements both the hazy hip-hop of Snoop Dogg on \\"Say Somethin'\\" and the acrobatics of Twista on the dream-like \\"One and Only.\\" In her early years, Carey would have adorned the latter track with vocal tricks to show off her five-octave voice, but she has wisely learned to rein in her frills. In fact, restraint is the key word on THE EMANCIPATION OF MIMI, a straightforward and satisfying pop-R&B collection. <br /> <br />

0316172324|4.0|This is the first book I've read by Gladwell.  I heard about the book on NPR and it sounded fascinating.  If you've ever found yourself making a remarkable snap judgement in a stressful (or otherwise) situation, and wondered to yourself \\"How did I know to do that?\\", then this is the book to read.  At 254 pages, it's a moderately short read that will keep you coming back for more.  I didn't miss a single day of reading and managed to finisht he book in less than a week, which--for me--is fast.<br /><br />The book basically consists of 6 chapters in which Malcolm explores different facets of our unconscious mind.  From art experts to orchestra auditions to police mishaps to military strategy to taste-testing, he certainly explores many different facets of instinctual reactions.  Each chapter is divided into manageable, numbered, sub-sections that I really appreciated.<br /><br />I gave it 4 stars rather than five because it didn't make me say \\"wow\\" when I was finished.  Not to say that I didn't enjoy, it just wasn't anything superbly profound that I hadn't thought about before.  I would definitely recommend that if you've already got a mind to try this book out, you should.  I wouldn't, however, recommend it to everyone I meet.  All in all an interesting learning experience with a touch of entertainment value.
B00005QFE5|3.0|The movie starts with a man arriving back in his home village in China after being informed of the death of his father. He meets with his Uncle and the Mayor, they inform him that his father died after becoming ill while out in a storm trying to raise money for a new school. He also learns that his mother insists that her husband be brought home by men walking down the road from the city to the village as was the old custom. Much of the movie then reverts to his narrating the story of how his parents met and fell in love before ending with the father's former students and others bringing him home, just as the old woman requested. <br />This film was different in many ways for me. The present day scenes were Black & White while the flashback segment was in Color, the reverse of what I expected to see.  <br />The village had a primitive look like things hadn't changed much in centuries but the man's childhood home had a couple of movie posters for \\"Titanic\\" on the walls. I found the details of daily life very interesting, some of them I hadn't seen before.  <br />No sex, no violence (except for Zhang Ziyi taking an accidental tumble down a hillside), no kissing or any close affection but a lot of shy smiles. <br />I probably learned of the movie because of some Amazon \\"people who bought this also bought-\\" recommendation, I don't remember. It has no action and often seems to move slowly but there are a lot of interesting details if you'll sit and wait for them.  <br />I thought Zhang Ziyi did a good job, this is I think the only film of hers in which she hasn't been in something with a lot of action, if you want action you don't want this movie.
1932100385|5.0|What a fantastic book. I started to take a deep interest in my health when I discovered something in my body called a sciatic nerve several years ago in my late 30's...I had pain so severe that I really didn't know what pain was until I experienced my case of sciatica. This was my wake up call. To make a long story short, I realized I was almost 50 lbs over what my ideal weight was suppose to be which certainly is, to say the least, not very helpful for one with back pain/sciatica...plus all the other bad things that come along with excess weight. This was weight that I gained very slowly over the years via my careless eating, ie especially from my bad habit of eating to many empty calorie snacks late at night. After doing a bunch of research on the internet, including reading some of the general conclusions reached by Mr. Campbell from The China Study posted on the internet, I gradually concluded that with all the scientific evidence out there, a Vegan diet was the way to go for me. I lost my extra 50 lbs and have kept it off for over 1 1/2 years now. What shocked me is how much BETTER I feel...so much more energy, clearer thinking,intestinal issues I used to have are completely gone, etc. Eating as a Vegan, I'm shocked at how filled up I feel all the time eating a whole food Vegan diet....I have a BIG TIME appetite and that's saying a lot!!! <br /> <br />Again, I can't recommended this book enough. Even after all the reading I've done on diet and nutrition over the last several years, I still learned so much from this book. Reading this book just strongly reinforced the fact that my wife and I feel we made the correct decision for our health and well being in eating a whole food plant based Vegan diet. Mr. Campbell's writing style is extremely clear and kept me interested right to the end of the book. I'm a skeptical person by nature, but I feel this study proves its point beyond any reasonable doubt using both lab type studies and analyzing real world eating patterns of people. Comparing the differences in disease between cultures/people eating a plant based diet vs. a more \\"Western Diet\\" is truly an amazing comparision.
B00005K3NR|5.0|Carrie should not be judged as a horror movie and nothing else, in my opinion it is a psychological tragedy in which the director confounds the viewer by  forcing us to bleed our hearts out for a shy helpless girl and then goes and turns her into a merciless killer. The movie itself generates a creepy aura of wrongness with every scene, the different plot elements combine fantastically. Carrie's first period being such a terrifying ordeal for her is the metaphor for the film, innocence is savaged and mocked throughout. The film is an emotional rollercoaster, we empathise with Carrie's loneliness and confusion as a victim of bullying, even when she goes home she is psychologically attacked by her depraved religious fundamentalist mother who is hell bent on making sure Carrie should not enjoy a normal life. When a well-meaning student arranges for Carrie to join a popular high school cliche and attend the Prom, the negative forces in her life (bullies/mother) each separately conspire to bring about her ruin, psychologically they depend on the existence of a shy socially handicapped Carrie and cannot stand the thought of her escaping their need.    The acting performances in this film are incredible, two performances in particular stand out, Sissy Spacek completely revels in the role of Carrie - she manages to convey extreme shyness and vulnerability without ever becoming static or dull, she is animated and withdrawn at the same time as her eyes dart suspiciously around her while at the same time managing to look like a baby deer caught in a metal snare. When Carrie eventually unleashes years of pent up rage and bitterness, everyone gets splashed, righteous and unrighteous alike, Spacek adopts a frozen grimace of madness, her eyes bulge as the tables are turned on all those who thought her fair game for abuse, she gives it all back with interest and her fury ensnares some innocents. The second performance of real worth is that of Carrie's mother, played by Piper Laurie. Laurie deserved an academy award for her stunning portrait of the witchlike religious fundamentalist who's mental disturbance is psychologically damaging her daughter, indeed we are left in little doubt that Margaret White is a prime factor in Carrie's emotional problems. Laurie adopts a weird reedy voice for the role as she rattles off lines of scripture in a chopping fashion, tossing around directives to her daughter like a KGB chief on speed. Laurie's performance is also physically impressive, she is constantly moving about, waving her arms about and generally giving a very convincing interpretation of psychosis. We even feel sympathy for her as she describes her sad past one night to her daughter. A third performance of note is that of Tommy Ross, played by William Katt, i thought he injected a much needed note of humanity into the film, his portrait of the ostensibly tough and shallow jock was also laced with kindness, smypathy and tenderness when having been placed in the position of having to pretend he likes Carrie he finds himself actually starting to love her.     This is a somewhat difficult film to watch more than once, though just as interesting and compelling the ending is so sad and tragic and the pigs blood scene so savage that knowing what comes next is torturous, particularly as the worst scene comes just after the point where it seems Carrie has triumphed over adversity and carved a normal life out of chaos. The saddest lesson from this movie is catching a glimpse of the charming, delightful and gentle woman Carrie might have been (at the prom) and then seeing this vision so mercilessly butchered immediately afterwards. I saw once that there was some criticism off the insect ile like multi-vision perspective of Carrie near the end when simultaneously she sees the many faces of the crowd laughing at her in individual 'panes' and the ghostly cracked voice of her mother in her head intones \\"they're all gonna laugh at you\\", i think this was really clever and ingenious - the strangeness of it marks Carries transformation to madness perfectly while the multiple panes of vision convey her extreme sensitivity, she is acutely aware of every single individual mocking her (even her sympathethic teacher - an interesting question is wether the teacher really did join the others in ridiculing her), so ultimately from her perspective - they all must die, a stunning way to convey paranoia. The only let down is in the final confrontation between Carrie and her mother in the house, but then it would be very difficult to trump the scene which just preceded it. The final part with the hand - makes me jump every time, even though you know it's coming it seems to catch you unawares as though you just cannot pinpoint when exactly Carrie's bloodied hand is going to emerge from the debris.
B0000X61VE|5.0|This is a great workout that ties everything together, leaving you with a feeling that you've worked your whole body, not just your arms, legs, and abs.  It gets everything in between.  I've never injured myself using this workout.  I honestly don't know why it's gotten the bad reviews!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is pure visceral energetic creativity and a band that is truly at it's peak. Every second if this CD is brilliant and beyond entertaining (not to mention devoid of filler). Again, many of the lyrics are politically charged and satirical. It might be over the heads of some of you. The whole package is a completely natural progression for this band and I eagerly await Hypnotize.
B00005A3KS|4.0|The ultimate surf movie with all the lingo and enough attitude to make anybody want to take up surfing.    This 1991 movie starring up and coming Keanu Reeves as Special Agent Johnny Utah wanting to make name by solving a series of bank robberies in L.A.  Johnny goes under cover and meets up with a sexy surfer  (Lori Petti)who teaches him the basics and introduces him to surf guru Bodhi (Partick Swayze)  They become best friends and Johnny overlooks the possibility that his new friend could be the leader and brain behind the bank robberies.  With plenty of surfing, sky diving and chases, this makes it one of Reeves's most understated movies yet.    A thread of good against evil is present through out the story, and Johnny's choices to take the right decisions are ever evident.    Good entertainment. A surf movie that actually has some dialogue!
B00005JKCH|5.0|I've got to say, this movie had it all. Special effects, good story, morals and even some good music. If you watch it you'll see what all the hype was about. I know most people aren't into superheros. Well guess what? Neither was I! I didn't want to see this movie when it came out but when I did see it, I was very impressed. Trust me, get this movie and I promise, you'll love it.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I remember this album when I was in the 11th Grade. I love this album. On her album, she reflects on the fast-paced events of the past 3 years. The music on this album is continuous. With this album,an eager international music-buying public gets to see once more this amazing, multi-talented artist fully expressing herself with a dazzling array of new compositions.  This album has been certified 3x Platinum. Remember,this was 2003-2004.
B00006D295|1.0|20th Century Fox must be related to the Fox network.  The DVD would not play on one computer.  My other would play the DVD if I downloaded egregiously invasive software and registered it with an actual email addy.  In other words, I was giving Fox an invitation to spam. When the DVD finally began to play, I was inundated with ads to buy other Fox DVDs.  When I tried to expand to full screen, I was given an error message and requestd to download an 'enhancement' to the WIN '95 & '98 package (How modern the folks at Fox are...NOT!).  The enhancement felt that my birthdate was vital to the process.  No wonder people are pirating movies online. <br /> <br />Since I opened the DVD case (How stupid of me to think the movie would simply open and play as all my other DVDs have.) I violated the Amazon policy on DVD returns.  I am going back through my open orders and eliminate anything that has the Fox logo.
B000002G87|5.0|First, let me say that I believe this album will one day finally receive the acclaim it deserves. That acclaim is here (read any of the other reviews), but it's not yet widespread enough (as in \\"Stairway\\"-type recognition) to match up to the phenomenal music within. <br /> <br />I have for a long time though of the Layla album as a concept album. Perhaps it was intended as one; we may never truly know. Some of the tracks don't quite fit into my ideas, but I figure that's to be expected. Just review the tracks: <br />\\"I Looked Away\\": The intro piece. Sets the scene; it could be a man looking back sorrowfully on his troubled past. Then again, maybe he's come past his emotions and can quietly smile at his memories. <br />\\"Bell Bottom Blues\\": The protagonist takes us back to his day, when he could think of nothing but that girl that seemed so beautiful and when the next time he could talk to her was. <br />\\"Keep On Growing\\": His friends tell him he'll get past it. \\"Don't worry, kid, ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on.\\" <br />\\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\\": He hits a low point; he hasn't seen the girl in days. He hasn't heard that sweet voice or stolen a gaze at those alluring eyes. <br />\\"I Am Yours\\": He's back on top. He's seen the girl, talked to her about music, TV, and all the clichs of life. His head swims with the euphoria of the moment. <br />\\"Anyday\\": The euphoria begins to slip away. He fantasizes to keep his mind off the moment, but his mind wanders. <br />\\"Key To The Highway\\": He hasn't seen her in too long, and is trying anything he can to keep his mind off her. <br />\\"Tell The Truth\\": He thinks about what he'll say the next time he sees her. A meticulously placed comment here, a witty crack there. <br />\\"Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad\\": The night after the days he sees her again; he is happy enough to stay upbeat, but wistful enough to reflect. <br />\\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman\\": His friends (who still can't understand) think they know what he's going through. He doesn't think so. <br />\\"Little Wing\\": Tragedy strikes somewhere else in his life; probably a close family member or friend dies. He is crushed, already unstable anyway. <br />\\"It's Too Late\\": He sees here with another man. He laughs crazily instead of actually accepting the truth. <br />\\"Layla\\": The lowest of the low. He contemplates suicide, but lacks the resolve. His emotion tears him apart with violent force. But somehow... it all works out. She breaks up with the other man and comes to the narrator for comfort. He tells here everything. They fly to a little island in the Caribbean and sleep in a hammock on the beach. (Or something like that.) <br />\\"Thorn Tree In The Garden\\": She dies; we don't know how much later. He is sad, but treasures the time he had enough to stay clear. <br /> <br />These are mostly just some musings I threw down; now I'll get to the real review. <br /> <br />The opener, \\"I Looked Away\\", sets up the album perfectly. It mixes nice guitar work with the right feel to segue into... <br />\\"Bell Bottom Blues\\", the raging torrents of emotion surging together. <br />\\"Keep On Growing\\" is acceptable; not the best on the album, perhaps, but it's in elite company. <br />\\"Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out\\"; a classic blues standard with new life pumped into it. Allman makes his sizzling debut. <br />\\"I Am Yours\\", a blissful piece of calm. <br />\\"Anyday\\", full of emotion (though not the same caliber as \\"Bell Bottom Blues\\" or the title track). <br />\\"Key To The Highway\\", a nice, lengthy blues jam. <br />\\"Tell The Truth\\"; see \\"Keep On Growing\\". <br />\\"Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad?\\", blazing guitar work from both guitarists. <br />\\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman\\", the definitive version thereof, Allman and Clapton dueling calmly. <br />\\"Little Wing\\", the blistering Hendrix tribute. Stunning. <br />\\"It's Too Late\\", the nice little piece that gives the final setup to \\"Layla\\". <br />\\"Layla\\". The whole album builds up to it. I'll never forget how I felt the first time I heard it; me, this silly little teenaged kid who had had two crushes in his life, could feel every fiber of emotion raging through this piece. The guitar work is superhuman. The vocals are overpowering. And then, when you think it can't go any emotionally higher... it doesn't. The bliss of the piano coda crests over you, calming all your fears and worries. Let it suffice to say that if the Democrats lose in 2008, it won't be the first time \\"Layla\\" has prevented my suicide. There has never been a shred of doubt in my mind that it is the single greatest piece of music ever recorded. <br />\\"Thorn Tree In The Garden\\", the quietly beautiful closer. <br /> <br />If Rolling Stone submits its apologies and reranks the Layla album in the top five or ten, I would accept that.
B000002KY8|5.0|This album established the sound of the 80's. Prince utilized the new technology (Linn drum sampler) and the high resonance Oberheim synthesizer and created the sound for decade. The synths and drum machine are so loud it dominates everything on the tracks. The mix is very raw and sometimes distorted, the sound he was looking for. A weird video \\"Automatic\\" came from this album where Prince is tied down to a bed and beaten with whips. The original vinyl release has Prince's eyeball as the record label.
0684823454|4.0|What surprised me most about this book was the humour. I expected the familiar story of our greatest leader's early life, I expected an insightful account of Britain in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, I expected a stirring tale of a young man who was a practical adventurer just as much as politician and author. I didn't expect to laugh out loud regularly for much of the story.  <br /> <br />If you've seen the film \\"Young Winston\\", based on this book, you will be familiar with some of the events. Other programmes and books have adequately explained his war leadership and his contribution to many serious political issues. However, the films and documentaries I have seen fail to capture the mischievous spirit communicated through this book.  <br /> <br />This a fascinating study of a bygone age, when Britain maintained a great empire, when most politicians took the title Lord, and when politics and army officership were sports for those of independent means. Interestingly despite his aristocratic bloodline Churchill's family was not particularly wealthy and some of the most poignant lessons stem from this.  <br /> <br />Sometimes the sentiments in the book appear bloodthirsty or imperialistic, but you have to realise that at least part of the time Churchill is writing satirically, reflecting common values which you suspect he did not always share himself. When he is sincerely expressing his own serious ideals it is usually easy to detect.  <br /> <br />These beliefs link both his skilful analysis of historical events, and Churchill's account of his own development. For example he explains the British government's failure to be magnanimous after the early victories of the Boer war as the reason that a relatively fast-moving and honourable conflict descended into \\"shocking evils\\" on both sides. The same failing is shown as a prime force in the leftward drift of Churchill's own politics.  <br /> <br />Churchill was a great writer, but it's instructive to learn that his facility with English developed largely because he was judged early on to be too dim to cope with Latin and Greek. The classics loss was our gain, the legacy including both Churchill's great deeds and great writing.  <br /> <br />The last chapter is slightly disappointing, with Churchill's early parliamentary career an anticlimax, and the story stops rather than ending on a major event. That apart, the pace, interest and humour are consistent throughout.  <br /> <br />This book was written in 1930, when Churchill was already 56, but in the \\"wilderness years\\" before he regained high office and led Britain through the Second World War. It is interesting to speculate whether the book would have been very different if it were written either much earlier or later.  <br /> <br />If you want adventure, read this book. If you want to understand a great man, read this book. If you want to do both and have a good laugh, read this book. <br />
0312995423|3.0|I read every Dan Brown book and Digital Fortress is the last one so far. I did like it better than Deception Point, but it pales in comparison to the Langdon novels.  <br />In Digital Fortress we are presented a dilemma by a hacker that has hacked into National Securities (NSA) most powerful computer. If the Hacker gets his way electronic destruction will occurr unless the heros can locate the special code that can unlock it and end it's countdown. Problem is the Code is in Spain and there are sabateurs out there doing thier best to make sure the code falls into the wrong hands. <br /> The pace of DF was well maintained, the clues were fair, I didn't care for the hoaky dialogue, as well has the 2 dimensional chacters. But over all it was a decent read, just to fluffy for my tastes.
0783223676|5.0|This is one of the finest black comedies ever made, on a par with Alfred Hitchcock's \\"The Trouble With Harry\\", or Stanley Kubrick's \\"Dr. Strangelove\\".  The special effects achieve hilarious comedic moments throughout the film. <br /> <br />Much thanks to the review by R. Whitney regarding the fact that the movie was fimed using a \\"soft\\" matte, meaning that the aspect ratio for the DVD of 1.33 to 1 actually shows MORE of the movie than a widescreen version would.  Many of Stanley Kubrick's films have been released the same way.  Judging by many of the other reviews for this movie, I believe many people don't understand that they are actually getting more for their money by buying this version of the film.
B0002Y69NG|4.0|I was a fan before I watched these 10 dvds, now I am even more of a fan. My favorite author, Ken Wilber, on my favorite movies. If you obsessive and into Ken check out Kosmic Consciousness a 10 CD dialogue  with Tammy Simon of Sounds True.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|Why oh why must I constantly evoke Susan Powter, STOP THE INSANITY!  While newer groups like Keane and Snow Patrol pillage from the '60s catalogs of groups such as The Zombies and The Smoke, Jet is blamed for being a rip-off group!  Listen, take it from me - the former manager of a mid-level rock group - Jet is the real deal and not as derivitive as you might think.  Basically, groups have been influenced and inspired by each other for ages.  Jet is no different, except that their influences were more from the synth-pop '80s era.  You don't really hear it in this album because they've substituted guitars and acoustic keys for the synths of yesteryear.  I've done it myself, back in the day, more or less employing a kind of 'bait and switch' tactic so the audience never really knew they were getting recycled material.  I didn't make enough off my group to retire, but I can proudly say I survived the male-dominated music industry with my neo-feminist instincts intact.   <br /> <br />Oh, and my handsome boyfriend wanted me to say that this album is really effective when getting freaky in the bedroom.  Oh, that devil.
B000067UUJ|5.0|this band is the greatest band in the world, with every cd i buy from them they seem to get better and better, and this one is no exception.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Mezmerize shows that System Of a Down is using a whole new direction in their music.  When getting the CD, I listened to every track some songs were great, but others were sorta low on my status.  For example \\"B.Y.O.B\\"  The song started great and heavy, but once the chorus hit, It didnt impress me at all.  Daron Malakian's vocals always seemed to fit in on all their other albums but it just sorta got repetitive.  Overall, I think the CD was still good, but definatly not the best.  System Of a Down's first self-titled CD is still my favorite on choice.  Seconed obviously would be \\"Toxicity\\".  I do recommend buying this CD.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|These two are geniuses and i can't imagine life without their tremendous movies. Between watching South Park on a regular basis and watching Basketball over and over, this is just another contribution to the comedy world given to the people by Trey Parker and Matt Stone!
B000000OQF|1.0|I can compare this album to people trying to get over a dating relationship. While it is at its prime, it is all fun and games. Then later you realize it was a waste of time to begin with. But later you find it hard to let go of something that wasn't good to begin with. <br /> <br />People it is 2005, this album is very dated and these \\"bad boys\\" were elimanted by 93... Move on already..
B0009KA7BS|5.0|What the heck are you people talking about. THis was one of the best movies that i've ever seen. I'm sorry but if you people were looking for some \\"True to the Comics\\" movie or some deep drama, read the synopsis before you see it. If you're a fan of the Matrix, and the excorsist, you will love this movie. It had great effects and was another great add to Keanu's resume.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Since SOAD released their first cd, they just keep getting better with each one. This band is incredibly talented, and even if you dont like thier music you've got to respect that these guys are amazing at what they do. I'd like to say that i love the song Cigaro-- I think its hilarious, every song on this cd is just incredible, you dont have to skip a track, just sit back and litsen.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Great movie overall but Brad Pitt was not right for the part he played. He was over the top and couldn't compare to Eric Bana who played Hector. But the movie was overall great!
B0002EQ7EC|5.0|I'm not a big Paul Simon fan, in fact, I don't know many of his songs except for Mrs. Robinson, Bridge Over Troubled Water and such.  But this record was playing at my local used CD shop and I had to have it.  <br /> <br />From start to finish, the album is perfect, flawless. Every note is beautiful. It's something you can put on for a beautiful summer day and just sit around and lounge or listen to while summer roadtrippin' through beautiful country like Southern Europe or the Americas. <br /> <br />I would suggest the reissue w/ 4 bonus tracks, its nice having the record extended a bit, the fun lasts longer.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I vary on my music types, but I mainly stay in the metal category. I have all of the SYSTEM albums (like Im sure most people who like the do), and I feel that is a very great magnificent step for them. However, we cannot soley judge this CD becuas ewe have not seen the whole picture. We will tough, once \\"HYPNOTIZE\\" comes out. Until then, I feel that is an Awesome album and offers a great variety and mix in songs and song types. the songs draw you in and you cannot escape. The guitars just flash and bang and you constantly hear Serj's characterisitc fast-paced singing.
B0000TLA9G|5.0|Ive loved this band ever since I first heard them. I remember listening to Appeitate for Destruction, and thinking it was one of the greatest cds to ever be released. No matter how many times Welcome to the Jungle gets played, its still good to me. Its too bad Axel ruined the band, and basically made Guns n Roses into a joke. I still like GNR no matter what. This cd is for casual radio listeners, true fans will notice how many tracks are lacking. Coma, Locomotive, Rocket Queen are just a few songs that would have made it better. They also sing many songs live that are not featured on albums, that are better then a couple tracks on this cd. Guns n Roses are still one of my faviorte bands, no matter how bad Axel screwed up.
B000929AJQ|2.0|As much as I might like to say that this is the worst NIN album, I won't, because it will cloud the fact that based on it's own merits this album is weak, and weak is not a word I thought would ever describe a NIN album, but it is......weak! Really, a step backwards in many ways. The arrangements, the melodies, the vocals, the lyrics, etc. are not exciting, because they're not inspired and it is OBVIOUS.  I knew Trent was desperate the minute he had to attach Dave Grohl's name to the project, because it meant he needed help producing the album and selling the album. Grohl's drums are at best adequate and at worst annoying and boring (songs for the deaf was amazing, and I'm sure Trent was hoping for that spark!). Sorry! Trent played it way to safe! Low risk, low reward...period!
B000002VCT|5.0|This album takes me back to 1979 when I used to look to the night winter skies to seek serenity and solace with my little telescope. A fantastic album.
0871137380|5.0|This is one of the best military books I have ever read. The author uses great descriptions to keep you right in the action. The writing is tense, sharp, and easy to read. I was finding it hard to put down.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|Daft Punk is a great band that has some type of idea of direction. I realized that while sitting on the couch, watching some european MTV. The video for \\"Robot Rock\\" came on and I was blown away. Sure, the images were repeptitive and the song was too..but it didn't bother me. Simply because you could hear that some work was put behind it. These guys know good music...listen to homework..they give praise to some amazing artists. You can tell Daft Punk listens to different kinds of music, takes what they enjoy, blend it into their own sound and give us gold. Isn't that all we ever asked of any kind of music? Some kind of self interpretation that was different from our own? If not that, just a good beat to dance too. Even if you dont dance, you will find yourself making singing along in the car seat while making funny faces in the mirror.<br /><br />Nevermind the vehicles coming in the other direction that will think of you as strange.<br /><br />ANyways, you can have fun with this album. Its a real treat for your ears..its fresh..its new..its what you would expect of daft punk. For once there is a band that constantly delivers a good product.<br /><br />Thanks Daft Punk<br /><br />-DelVecchio
B0008ISM40|3.0|Trent brings us another album, but has he lost his touch or ran out of ideas?      This is a good album, but as some of the others I'm an old schooler when it comes to NIN.  I was introduced to this band back in my late highschool years, out one night at a dance club(around 1990).  I can remember for weeks trying to find out who sung the song that was so cool at the club that night.  Well one Sunday night I happened to be watching MTV 120minutes(or something like that, it was an alternative show that came on back then) and boom there it was.  I guess the reason it was so cool is because I had never heard any music like this before, guess you could say it was my intro to industrial style music(which NIN is more of industrial rock or something).     To get back to the review this albums is softer, less electronic than what you will be use to.  I guess I always have a preassuption that whatever he comes out with will be darker(I haven't had time to really learn the lyrics, so maybe they are darker than the instumentals make me feel).    If this is a change for Trent and NIN, then I'm sure they will continue to do quiet well.  I guess some of us oldschoolers will feel a little left out in the cold, but if this is part of what is helping him feel better emotionally/mentally; then who are we to judge?
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This is a quote from Natalie Portman's character, Alice, and it quite aptly sums up what should be your response to this movie, and the actors in it.  Frankly, I don't know why I wasted my time, except that all these people are supposed to be \\"stars\\" in their own right (maybe Portman is the exception but rising nonetheless), and I honestly kept expecting this movie to get better or at least get interesting.  This was nothing more than thirty-something tripe.  Roberts looked gaunt, Law was just reciting lines, and Portman did her best to look sexy in bad wigs and stripper garb (Why?  Because she didn't mind being exploited.)  If you have to award kudos, which this film doesn't deserve, I would give them to Owen who at least wasn't sleepwalking through his performance -- but be forewarned he really isn't a nice guy, and if you're used to seeing him that way and don't want his reputation tarnished, you're better off seeing him in something else.  Don't waste your money.  See something more worthwhile, like Nicole Kidman's \\"Dogville\\" if you must watch people behaving badly.  At least that movie left me thinking about it and talking about it with other people for days afterward.
B0002DB50E|4.0|Part of me wants to give this movie 5 stars, but I can't quite make myself do it.  It certainly could've been, and probably would've been had Cronenberg had a couple more months to work on the script before he had to start shooting, but we'll never know.  This film has strong performances, some very original and intriguing effects and some interesting ideas, but the plot falters a bit towards the end.  Through the first hour, the universe of the film is slowly built up, but the final half hour starts with a twist that radically pars down the film, and begins a sprint to the end.  And then, 15 minutes later, we have another twist which introduces some other ideas and new dimensions to the film's world, but these are never really examined with any depth.  But, what is there is very good, so it's certainly far from a total loss.<br /><br />Max Renn, played wonderfully by James Woods, is a smalltime cable station operator in the near future.  He, like most smalltime operators who are interested in money alone, specializes in giving people what they can't get elsewhere: Sex and Violence.  One of his employees catches a portion of a new broadcast: Videodrome.  This show takes things further than Max dared dream, as it is nothing but torture, mutilation and murder, and is utterly convincing.  Max is simultaneously intrigued and repulsed by this new discovery, and he looks into finding the source, and perhaps exploiting it on his own channel, all while he seems to be slipping out of sanity, and is experiencing bizarre hallucinations.  Specific details beyond this would perhaps be giving away to much, though suffice to say that there is a lot more to Videodrome than mere entertainment and money.<br /><br />James Woods is one of the great strengths of this film.  He plays Max as a total sleazebag, and he's both very convincing, and kinda charming and likable in spite of his nature.  All the other actors are capable, though none of the other characters are seen with all that much depth.  Thematically, 'Videodrome' is all over the map, dealing with conspiracies, snuff films, connection between man and technology etc.  Though these themes are interesting to consider, they're more interesting in the way they are portrayed on the film, allowing for some interesting visual ideas.  The primary effect of the hallucinations on Max's mind, at least initially, is to make inanimate objects appear to be alive: TVs and tapes pulse and throb.  Eventually, the borders between the natural and artificial are breached, as Max makes out with his creepy masochist girlfriend via the TV and he develops a nasty slit in his stomach, which allows for the implantation of artificial objects into his body.  These effects aren't necessarily terribly realistic, but perhaps they shouldn't be, as they are representing a change in the inherent nature of our world.  Suffice to say, these visual ideas are some of the most intriguing parts of the film, and 'Videodrome' deserves to be recognized alongside 'Blade Runner' and 'The Thing' as visionary films which display practical special effects at their best. (Though 'Videodrome' definitely isn't quite as impressive as either of those films)  For us horror fans there's some decent gore, including some nasty gun violence and a truly surreal scene where a character kinda explodes and melts down and turns into a bunch icky polyp things simultaneously.<br /><br />Finally, the battlegrounds of the film are set up, with a conflict between those who wish to use television and the media to manipulate the world, and those who simply wish to erase the division between the real and unreal, with Max unwillingly placed in the middle. (Or, so it appears, to the highly delusional Max.  It's tough for the viewer to say precisely where his delusions stop and reality begins)  Then, the conflict itself is very truncated and small scale, with an ending which that kinda fails to tie everything together.  This isn't to say that the final third ofthe movie isn't entertaining- it's generally more entertaining than the first 2/3.  But, it just seems like there shoulda been more, and with all the buildup the film the fruition of all the ideas could've been more detailed and extensive .<br /><br />Though obscenely expensive, the Criterion collection DVD is very nice, while the other one is a piece of crap.  The picture looks great, multitudes better than on the cheap one, and the packaging in very cool and classy.  I've listened to brief portions of the commentary, and they sound pretty interesting. (After actually listening to them I may need to revise this review, as they may have other insights)  I was pretty impressed with Woods' commentary, as he seems very excited about the film, and, unlike some actor's, he is particularly interested in discussing what the film is about, rather than just what making it was like.<br /><br />Somewhat flawed, but innovative and distinctive film making.  Definitely recommended.<br /><br />Grade: B+ining- it's generally more entertaining than the first 2/3.

B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I just finished listening to all four old albums by system of down. <br />including the new one. <br /> <br />MeZmErIzE: <br />It has it's awsome songs \\"B.Y.O.B, Cigaro, Radio/video, this cocaine makes me feel like i'm on this song, question, sad statue,and lost in hollywood\\" these are the songs that truly stand out in the CD, and i will be going through each song..... <br /> <br />Soldier side- intro: <br />This is just an intro, but it starts the CD off with a melow bang. <br />Perfect way to start the CD. <br />Byob: <br />This song is a fast passed song that is one of the best from the CD, it is a catchy song. <br /> <br />Revenga: <br />This song starts off with their weird and fast passed ryming sheme of serj's. <br />It is one of the songs that could've been left off the CD. <br /> <br />Cigaro: <br />This song is a catchy, but funny song(lyrical whise). <br />This is one of system's best songs on the album, it's fast passed guitar and lyrics that really get through to you. <br /> <br />Radio/video: <br />This song is starts off with a kinda slow start and blasts out into the chorus. <br />It's not a bad song, but it could've been left off of the CD. <br /> <br />This Cocaine makes me feel like i'm on this Song: <br />This song is the fastest song on the CD and it is a good song, but to new coming system of a down fans it might not suit you. <br /> <br />Violent Pornography: <br />This is again another song that could've been left off of the album, but it isn't a bad song the chorus is the only good part of the song. <br /> <br />Question: <br />This is without a doubt systems best song....it has awsome guitar riffs, and awsome vocals that just pull you into the song and you don't want it to end. <br />It starts off slow with an acoustic guitar and then jumps in with an eletric guitar. <br /> <br />Sad Statue: <br />Is a good song also, it's chorus is what stands out. <br />The Guitar riffs in it are raw. <br /> <br />Old Shool Hollywood: <br />This song is my least favorite song on the album. <br />The sound of the vocals puts you off when listening to it, it doesn't suit the album, but it isn't as bad as some of sytem's older songs. <br /> <br />Lost in Hollywood: <br />They ended the CD with a good song. <br />Lost in hollywood is a slow song that stays in your head after listening to the CD. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Overall this CD is just as good as the old albums if not better....it is a CD that grows on you the more that you listen to it. <br />This is without a doubt a CD that any new metal fan should buy. <br />I gave this CD 4 stars because of it's lack of really really mind blowing songs, but the good songs that this CD has are awsome. <br />So if you see it, buy it.....you won't regret it!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System Of a Down keeps things fresh in \\"Mezmerize\\", offering a new sound in songs like \\"Cigaro\\" and \\"Old School Hollywood\\", while sticking to their roots through songs like \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" and \\"Revenga\\". In other words, they've set themselves apart from the typical rock genre once again without losing any of their oddball originality. \\"Mezmerize\\" is an album that should be investigated by   anyone with a remote interest in rock, and is a must for any current SOAD fans.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Please do metal fans a favor a do not call this a metal album.  It's alternative, no more no less.  This band is in the same category as NIN, only not as good, and I hate NIN.  I made a big mistake and bought their first two albums.  Well ... buying one could be considered a mistake, but buying two ... that's just bad judgement (or stupidity). \\"BYOB\\" has got to be the dumbest song I have heard in a while. <br />
B00025ETIW|4.0|The 'Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge' album is great. I love the variation in songs and how catchy the album is. I also love the lyrics to the CD, they break away from the rest of the rock lyrics you see today. My personal favorites from the CD are 'Thank You For the Venom' 'Helena' \\"I'm Not Okay' and 'It's Not a Fashion Statement, It's a Fu*cking Deathwish'. I would definitely buy it all over again!
B00000K0E5|5.0|Pierce Brosnan's first outing as James Bond not only helped revitilize the series, but Goldeneye also became a modern day Bond classic that ranks up there with the best Bond films.  Martin Campbell (Mask of Zorro, Beyond Borders, rumored to be attached to the upcoming new Bond film as well) helms this installment, as Bond finds himself against a group of renegade Russians, led by his thought dead former partner (Sean Bean).  Brosnan's characterization of Agent 007 is the best since Sean Connery's; bringing a dark side to Bond's psyche while making him all the more psychologically complex.  The film is unbelieveably loaded with action from beginning to end, which makes it no surprise why Goldeneye was a runaway hit when released in 1995.  Judi Dench makes her debut here as well as Bond's superior M, while the rest of the cast includes gorgeous beauties Izabella Scorupco and Famke Janssen, as well as Alan Cumming, Joe Don Baker, and Robbie Coltrane.
B0002858YS|3.0|I will admit, The Killers have some catchy songs off of the album, but after awhile all of the songs start to sound the same... the same slow beat with the emphasis of the voice synthesizer. Also, I find that Brandon Flowers has trouble varying his voice. All of the songs are him talking fast over a synthesizer. I think that the album would be better more varied and with different arrangements of instruments. Finally, the lyrics are original, but are a bit repetative. I guess the album's okay overall.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Six years after the release of \\"The Fragile\\", Nine Inch Nails mastermind Trent Reznor has sobered up, and returned with \\"With Teeth\\".  Listeners will notice from the get-go that this is not the grinding, industrial-laced carnage that Nine Inch Nails made a name for themselves with, \\"With Teeth\\" goes so much deeper than that.  Opening track \\"All the Love in the World\\" isn't the best NIN song you'll ever hear, but the New Wave-inspired \\"Only\\" and \\"Getting Smaller\\" feature all the dark, lush melodies that Nine Inch Nails fans would come to expect.  The lead single \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" is undeniably catchy, and you can just picture it being played at raves and dance clubs, a la \\"Closer\\".  Many compare \\"With Teeth\\" to \\"Pretty Hate Machine\\", but that comparison is unfair.  On \\"With Teeth\\", we can hear that Trent isn't angry anymore, and for a majority of the album, he seems more focused than ever before.  \\"With Teeth\\" is possibly the most commercial Nine Inch Nails album to date, and it's certainly not the masterpiece that we hoped six years time between albums would help create, but make no mistake that this is pure NIN, and while fans may be split on it, this is still one of the best albums of the year so far.
B0002T7ZKW|5.0|Ok, first of all, anyone who screws the 'American Idiot' album has big problems. I admit I like the earlier Green Day music a little better, but this is one of the best punk rock albums ever made. Now, if any of you have a brain in your head, you'll know that Billie Joe is NOT dissing America... he's simply telling it like it is, and if you can't realize that than I think you should get out of the country because you're what's ruining it. Everyday I am surrounded by lazy idiots who are screwing this country with their brainless selves. The problem here is that no one in American wants to work at all anymore, they just think it's a free ride... and it's not. If any of you want to see America stay powerful I would suggest actually taking advice from Billie Joe's songs. They're alot more powerful than you'll ever know.
B00008G9JO|5.0|Another poetic and deeply felt masterpiece from Ian Anderson & Co., blahblahblah.  When a band has an endless string of genius level albums another testimonial is a bit boring I guess.  Still, I feel compelled to add a strong endorsement (out of pure neurotic music-fanatic drive) of Heavy Horses.  This was my first TULL purchase as a teenager in the seventies, although my Uncle had given me some of the earlier ones like Thick, Benefit & Minstrel that got me into them (in a big way).  I will admit that I liked the earlier ones more then, but after all of these years I am finding this one to be movin' on up in the favs.  The rolling, driving rhythms and tight, layered instrumentals on here are very addictive (the Glascock/Barlow duo is very impressive here - shed a tear that this was Glascock's last full album before he died).  There is an upbeat whimsical feel like Songs from the Wood (one of my favs) that keeps this one playing often for me.  I guess the lyrics are a bit more serious sometimes, but still, the catchy high energy feel of the album prevails.  A couple of great mouse songs, moths, horses, dogs (WHO is the dog?), cats, weathercocks, makin' love in the green grass, etc...country life hit IA hard I guess, but that's a good thing.  I love the complex and often cynical TULL of previous albums, esp. since many of them are hard rockers, but this post-farm enlightenment period is welcome (a dark edge is creeping back in here, the bad world economy was hard to hide from at this time).  I don't want to go into excessive detail on individual songs, it would take too long, but all songs on here are great to me.  Let me redirect you to the last statement, this is an all songs are great album (not the only one by TULL)!  Great 50 minute mental workout.<br /><br />I noticed Heavy Horses (the song) was the only one included on the bigger TULL compilation, which makes it clear to me that this album is essential and shouldn't be bypassed!  Very compelling TULL with a great remastering job and 2 interesting extras - Lyrics included on all songs- GO BUY (or your life may never reach its full potential)!!astering job and 2 interesting extras - Lyrics included on all songs- GO BUY (or your life may never reach its full potential)!!
B0002OERI0|5.0|What can I say? This is the best rock album I've heard. Also, it's quite apparent who's pro-bush on this review... bush is a screwball... get over. If you actually listen to this album you'll find that Billie Joe Armstrong is quite right when he says America's full of idiots. It's apparent that America's only going downhill with all of this stupidity. But back to the CD, this is AMAZING! Every single song on here is one that I can listen to time and time again. I almost have the whole album memorized! And as a side note... Green Day is not mainstream rock. I don't see any other rock bands with 9 minute songs that kick @ss. This CD is such a big step for rock music. Thanks to Green Day for bringing rock music back to America. <br /> <br />{{i made a point to burn all of the photographs}}
0975991477|4.0|I had the opportunity to hear Dr. Lipton on the radio and am now just ordering the book. A friend told me about seeing him lecture, and now I'm glad that his research and ideas are provoking people to think. [...]    From his radio presentations and lectures, I think he has touched on something big from his work - the power of the mind - fear, hope, love, anger, chemistry, and spirituality - are all connected to our basic functioning cellular components. The trick is to learn how to be present and work with your thoughts. From his talkshow, he was clear that he isn't providing a manual on how to do this - it is up to each and every one of us to master it - rather he is giving us the insight about how our bodies work, and that our cells that keep us all alive ought to be kept in a nurturing environment, and he gives us reasons why that is important - and however we want to nurture our personal environment is up to us. [...]Thank you Lipton for helping to make this world and life that I live a good place.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|There are always complaints about greatest hits albums, \\"Wheres this wheres that\\" Well, there shouldn't be any of that about this one, these ARE arguably THE best of Hendrix. So, stop reading this and start listening to \\"Voodoo Child\\" \\"Purple Haze\\" and \\"All along the Watchtower\\"
B0007Y08IS|3.0|The South Park guys have created an occasionally funny movie that does a decent job of lampooning gung-ho militarist and hollywood retards. As much as I enjoy watching pea-brained left-wing hollywood a-holes getting massacred in puppet form (please God, let it happen in real life), the movie just isn't as clever and funny as the five star reviewers seem to think. As a side note, I get a chuckle out of reading the one star reviews by left-wing rectums who can't stand getting a little taste of their own medicine.
B000002GFC|5.0|What do you get when you have one of the top 3 guitarists, a top notch singer and bassist, and an excellent drummer? You get Cream one of the all time greatest bands. (in my opinion) Although Sunshine of Your Love and Crossroads are well known, you will find yourself listening to those in addition to almost every other track. \\"Strange Brew\\" and \\"Swlabr\\" are paticulary good. So don't miss out on this Classic Rock classic.
B000696PWC|4.0|All the songs we know and love. Great. I love the Minogue's and their music, plus I do have to say it's really handy to have one double album of Kylie's best singles from PWL, deConstruction, all the way to Parlophone. It's great for the car. Or if you have gaps in your album collection.<br /><br />But what else can I say? There is nothing new for fans here since the two new tracks have both been released as singles, and there are no new remixes or videos included on this album. No new photos in the booklet (the cover photo is the slightly digitally altered photo from her `La La La' book). Nothing extra.<br /><br />We've already had unofficial `Greatest Hits' collections time and time again, so I had high hopes for the official, 3-different-labels `Ultimate' collection. But alas, It's not the `Complete' collection: `Made In Heaven', `It's No Secret', `What Kind Of Fool', `Word Is Out', `Finer Feelings', `If You Were With Me Now', 'Keep On Pumping It', `Where Is The Feeling', `GPI', `Some Kind Of Bliss', 'Cowboy Style' and `Your Disco Needs You' leave big gaps.<br /><br /> I'm sure if the powers that be had taken more time (and not taken advantage of the Xmas rush); the fans would now have a 3 disc edition, with b-sides and remixes. But we'll have to keep on waiting.<br /><br />3.5 stars
0743454537|5.0|This is the BEST book I have ever read! I read The Lovely Bones 3 summers ago and I thought that was the best book I ever read and I hadn't found one I liked just as much....I think this book tops that one! :) The ending shocked me. I sooooo didn't see it coming.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|The Lyrical intensity of this CD is awesome, but I wouldn't buy it if I was a die-hard republican, as most of the songs on this cd relate to Bush-Bashing.  For you righties, go back to your roots and buy a Garth Brooks CD because Mezmerize is not fo the faint-of heart.  Yea, it could be harder.  But I don't think that's the point of this CD, it's more of a lyrical intensive cd than a headbanger, although byob is pretty f-in awesome.  Not that the musical part isn't good, in fact, it rocks, but don't expect \\"Jet Pilot\\"-like pounding rhythms through all of the songs.  Must have in my book
B000002UJQ|2.0|Perhaps if this had come out well before \\"in the court of the crimson king\\" or \\"dark side of the moon\\" this would be some kind of innovative work. Instead, it is just a very derivitive mope-fest with little charm.  There are a couple standout tracks, but those are quickly bogged down by Floyd-lite numbers with no punch. <br /> <br />Radiohead does a nice job of mixing their influences, but goes a little overboard in directly lifting passages from Pink Floyd's Live Ummagumma disc. <br /> <br />The record now sounds tinny and dated. It was nice to see Radiohead learn from this and produce the organic Kid A, which is easily their best work and well worth owning.  This one is utterly forgettable.
0975991477|1.0|(...)  As someone who has read this book and just having heard the author on the radio, I can tell you that the book is more ambiguous than the above quoted description.  No where in the entire book does the author describe *how* cellular functionings are related to our spiritual natures, nor does the author detail any helpful or systematic way in which to achieve the kinds of potential he keeps repeating that we are able to attain.      Instead the author has written a book that redunantly keeps stating the premise that our biology is not controlled by genes but but how external events and stimuli get interpreted by our \\"subconscious programming,\\" which develops from how we've been reared during our first formative years.  For a man that is arguing against determinism of the genes, he sure does seem to be advancing a cultural determinism.    The author says until we rewrite or overrun these subconscious programs, we cannot free ourselves to attain the life we want.  But no where in the entire book does he tell us *how* to do just that.  Lipton bashes the scientific community for supposedly advancing the notion of being \\"victims\\" of a \\"dogma of DNA\\" mentality, but he offer no less a victimhood in saying we are effectively held hostages to this ysterious \\"subconscious programming\\" underpinning of human nature--when the author provides no means to break free from that supposed subconscious bondage.    Why did he write the book then if he is not offering a \\"cure,\\" as it were?      Moreover, one has to question the validity of the original premise that Lipton is presenting.  Does the human mind really work this way?  The \\"evidence,\\" although titilating seems too controversial and suspect and is far from being unquestionably accepted.  In particular the bringing in of supposed quantum-mechanical concepts seems rather new-age in tone and given other author's use of them, like Deepak Chopra, a bit contrived and trite.  Aside from the good-feel message, where's eithe the unequivocal evidence of these statements--and more important the supposed methods of healing ourselves of these underlying mechanism that the author claims is possible?    (...) The book did not deliver in what it advertised.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Arguably some of there best work. It's no doubt incredibly original, and an artistically beautiful masterpiece. Oh yeah Fu*k everyone who criticizes them for singing political songs, ever heard of artistic freedom dumba$$, they can write songs about whatever they want, even about how small your incompetent brain is!
0385513755|4.0|This book is a marvalous story with twists and turns around every page.  There are twists that change the book every moment.  The story makes you think and it makes you contridict the things the Catholic Church teaches, in some parts.  The story is great, keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time.  You can't wait to see what awaits you on the next page. I strongly suggest you going out and picking up a copy and reading it.
B00005QG9J|5.0|Simply put-Incubus amazes me.  I was never a huge fan of new-rock, but listening to this CD has converted me.  Every song is unique...a very rare find for a modern album.  Even the \\"heavier\\" songs aren't obnoxious at all...it is the perfect CD to keep in your car.
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|Having been a fan of Robert Plant for more than thirty years, I have had the pleasure of listening to countless songs, renditions and remixes of songs, Zep lead, and solo work. Robert Plant's career has been one of the most diversified and eclectic as any other in music and that is why I have stuck with him over the years. <BR>Yes, his time with Led Zeppelin was his gargantuan dive into the world of superstardom, and deservedly so. However, it's his solo work that has ultimately shown the man for what he is, a true musician.<BR>The solo career of Plant has given us a complete look at his capabilities both as an accomplished wordsmith and as a worldly, experienced musical conduit.<BR>I didn't think he could top the powerful and interesting Dreamland, but listening to The Mighty Rearranger has exceeded my wildest dreams. If you are a Robert Plant fan, or even just curious to see if he's 'still got the voice' you have to buy this album.<BR>There has been many reviews of how songs like Shine it all Around harken back to his Zep days. While it is a rockin' good song, face it people, Led Zeppelin is over. It was another time, another glorious place but the rest of the album shows us, in no uncertain terms, Robert has moved on. Let us all move on with him.<BR>Freedom Fries is a wonderful tune filled with his political views on world politics - a good shot at the American instigated war. Worth the price of the cd just for that tune alone.<BR>Brother Ray is a shout out to the late, great Ray Charles. A nice little rememberance.<BR>Tin Pan Alley really showcases Plants range of vocal talent, which incidentally, keeps getting better with age.<BR>The whole cd has an intimacy of voice that R.P. fans have come to know and love. <BR>Don't miss this great achievement.<BR>Let go of the past and travel along with Robert Plant on his magical trip through the musical ether. Close your eyes, breathe deeply, and let the journey begin....
B0001UL7RY|1.0|Avril Lavigne stinks!  You can tell how untalented an artist is when they constantly brag about writing their own music, but can't actually play it themselves.  Thats right, Avril fans.  Your idol, Avril can't play her own songs.  Why do you think she has two guitarists hired to play at her concerts?  Because she stinks!  Avril Lavigne can't play a note!   <br /> <br />In fact, she can't sing a note either.  All she does is yell into the microphone. I guess that must be why she's so popular. After all, thats what sells these days.  Don't bother learning or practicing your instrument.  Just scream into the microphone and crank the volume until everyone in the room is deaf.   <br /> <br />The only musical skills Avril Lavigne has are yelling, shouting, screaming, and turning up the volume knob on her guitar.  Yep, some talent that takes!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|1. SOLDIER SIDE/INTRO - great song to start off the album. I hope that on the Hypnotize album they will have an ending part.  <br />2. B.Y.O.B. - immense rhythm and pounding guitar. One of my favorite songs on this album! 11/10 <br />3. REVENGA - Kick-ass song from this album, the chorus is the best part of the song. 10/10 <br />4. CIGARO - awesome guitar, but the lyrics are kind of lacking on this one...8/10 <br />5. RADIO/VIDEO - this sounds like some kind of heavy Jewish wedding song, but still great nonetheless. 9/10 <br />6. THIS COCAINE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I'M ON THIS SONG: aside from its brilliant title, this song is not the best on this album. it's a great song to go crazy to though, lol...8/10 <br />7. VIOLENT PORNAGRAPHY - Another great song with a melodic chorus, and energized verses, telling of all the s*** thats going on, on TV. 10/10 <br />8. QUESTION! - the greatest song on this album! simply one of the most amazing songs System of a Down has ever done. 1000/10 <br />9. SAD STATUE - System has not lost its politically-enraged lyrics, and they show it one this song  <br />\\"You and me/we'll all go down in history/with a sad statue of Liberty/and a Generation that didn't agree\\" 9.5/10 <br />10. OLD SCHOOL HOLLYWOOD - this is unlike anything the band has done because it has synthesizer, making a techno/metal kind of feel, but this is an AWESOME song. 10/10 <br />11. LOST IN HOLLYWOOD - the lyrics on this one tell of the evils of Hollywood. this is the perfect ballad-like song to end the album. <br /> <br />KEEP ROCKING SYSTEM OF A DOWN! <br /> <br />This is without a doubt, System of a Down's most straightforward album to date, and the best. THIS RULES! Everything about this album is perfect: guitar, vocals, lyrics, and the whole feel to the album is MEZMERIZING......
1592400876|4.0|As an English major, I have read enough grammar books to satisfy my intellectuality, but I cannot recall ever reading one that was structured quite like this one. Lynne Truss' narrative style--spiked with sarcasm and humor-kept me reading, not just for the sake of grammar, but also to understand the \\"stickler\\" in her. This characteristic of hers is what I found interesting, appealing, hilarious, sympathetic, and relieved in the end.  <br /> <br /> Lynne Truss explains,\\" The reason to stand up for punctuation is that without it there is no reliable way of communicating meaning. Punctuation herds words together, keeps others apart. Punctuation directs you how to read.\\" Obviously, the majority of readers understand and can appreciate the importance of having punctuation and how frustrating it becomes when authors (like Faulkner) try to do without; thus we are left to stand up for our own interpretations of what the author really was trying to say! Hilariously enough, we encounter similar problems when we are trying to decipher just what some ads are about like \\"FAN'S FURY AT STADIUM INQUIRY\\" in not really about a single fan gone mad but a large mob of fans (editor needs to omit the apostrophe). This mistake would not evoke the stickler in me but I can be sympathetic on how misplaced the apostrophe must feel. It must have felt almost as bad when it was omitted from \\"Two Weeks Notice\\", which I am ashamed to admit that I never notice that it should have been \\"Two Week's Notice\\".  <br /> <br />Overall, Truss is able to passionately give punctuation its own attitude. Learning grammar has its advantages and rewards but actually finishing a grammar book completely without refueling on caffeine is a special reward of its own. <br /> <br />
0553296981|5.0|This book gave a good view of this young girl's life and what a lot of people had to go through during the holocaust.  Anne Frank wrote a good detailed account on how bad the holocaust really was and how she handled the problems.  They translated her writings to make it feel like you actually knew here and you felt sad for her during her hardships.  Her courage and strengths encourage many and this is a very good first person account on the holocaust.  This is a very powerful story that makes me fell horrible that those kinds of things were happening to people and that Anne Frank had to go through this experience.
0812550706|4.0|Ender's Game is an exciting Science Fiction set in the future where mere children hold the fate of the world in their little hands. Ender's Game is real page-turner and once you pick it up it is hard to put back down. Even though the character development is a bit weak, the intriguing plot makes u craze for more tales of Ender's feats.  <br /> Ender Wiggin is a 6-year-old boy who is the third in an age where having a third child is strictly forbidden. The overwhelming potential of Ender keeps him alive to go through many tests that will prove if Ender is capable of being the star fleet commander to lead hundreds of starships to destroy the dreadful and greatly feared buggers. Ender passes all his tests with flying colors, and brings great promise for the IF (International Fleet). Standard tests of mental and physical endurance don't seem to be enough to reveal Ender's true potential so bars are raised and rules are broken so that Ender may be pushed to his very limits.  <br /> Many fascinating themes come out in Ender's Game as Ender travels through the galaxy from one training facility to the next. Many common sayings can be matched with the themes that are throughout Ender's Game, such as `even one so small can do so much', and `think outside the box.' Ender is a very young cadet by battle school standards and is even small for his age, yet he achieves so much, proving the first saying, and his methods of achieving many of his goals go with the saying `think outside the box.' This novel also promotes the idea that `if you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything.'  <br /> Trial after trial Ender is worn down to fatigue, but despite his hardship he presses on. Ender has an unbelievable mental and physical capacity and endures all tests. Even though he believes that his efforts are useless he continues to simply finish his task set before him. Ender is put to a battle simulation where he is put against difficult computers that learn from his techniques as dailygrow more and more clever. Ender must rely on friends he has made during his training to help him command a simulated Starfleet to defeat the computers. <br /> Little does Ender know that he is no longer being tested, but now is actually fighting the war that he was trained to fight. With his ignorance of this fact, Ender fights to simply finish the tax, and finally rid himself of these annoying tasks. Without the worry and stress of knowing that he was sending real pilots to their deaths instead of simulated ships, Ender finishes the task set before him, and saves Earth from the threat of the buggers. <br /> Despite its lack of character development and somewhat farfetched science fiction, Ender's Game is a very pleasant read that I would recommend to other science fiction lovers. Ender's Game isn't a disappointing read, and is sure to snare its audience's attention. <br />
B00004RJ71|5.0|The movie I am reviewing is Blood in Blood out.  It was filmed in east Los Angeles.  This is a very powerful movie.  I saw this movie for the fist time about a month ago and I fell in love with it.  My name is Justin and I enjoyed this movie very much. <br /> This movie is rated R because of the violence and language.  The genre of this movie is drama and action.  This movie came out in1993. The producer of this movie is Taylor Hackford and Jerry Gershwin and the director is Taylor Hackford.  The writer Jimmy Santiogo Baca came to my school last year and talked about his life and told us about this movie and what inspired him to write it. <br /> The main characters are Miclo, Paco, and Cruz.  Paco and Cruz are half brothers and Miclo is their cousin.  At the beginning Miclo comes back to east LA from Los Vegas because he got in a fight with his dad.  Paco and Cruz are part of a gang called vatos locos and Miclo wants to be part too.  To prove that he can defend the neighborhood he breaks out the window of a car that three gang members from another gang and starts trouble. <br /> The guys in the car get their revenge on crus and break his back.  The  <br /> Votos locos retaliate the next day and paco and Miclo get caught by the cops.  Miclo goes to prison and paco go to the marines.  While Miclo is in prison he joins a gang called la onda.  He eventually becomes the leader of this gang.  They start to take over the prison and paco tries to stop him but his plan backfires and makes la onda stronger.   <br /> This story is about family.  Blood or not it is about taking care of each other.  Its about standing up for something you believe in.  I would compare this movie menace II society because of the story.  They both show the power of family.  They both show what it is like  who likes growing up in a place where the only way you will survive is if you have a strong family behind you.   <br /> On a scale of one to ten I would give this movie a ten.  It's a very powerful movie.  I would recommend this movie to any one who likes movies about struggles.  Also to those who like good movies.   <br />
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I have no clue how people don't like this if they ever considered themselves a SOAD fan. The band is always looking for ways to push themselves forward and progress. To me that's what makes them so damn original. <br />As for people not liking Darons voice is another mind boggling thing. While I don't think it's as good as Serj's voice I do think it's perfectly suited and compliments him perfectly. <br />The lyrics don't make sense? Haven't all of their lyrics always had a healthy dose of sarcasm to them? Haven't they always been outspoken on some sort of political issue? If you really think they're just talking about Hollywood in a literal sense you probably need a little help. <br />Reading comments like this \\"Finally, I always thought that Toxicity's songs were all over the place, but man, this cd took it to a whole nother level. On some of these songs, I'm thinking, is this really the same song? Some songs, the actual song itself, sounds like 4 different songs in one. It's really bizarre to tell you the truth. They are going to have a hard time finding another single from this one.\\" hurt my head. Damn them for being original, damn them for using weird rhythms, tempos, and time signatures. I highly doubt they care if they have another radio hit. <br />Overall I love this album start to finish and love that they keep progressing with each release. Definitely looking forward to the next release a little bit down the road. Very possible they could have the top 2 albums of the year on their hands.
B00001QEE8|5.0|I would give this movie ten stars out of five, if I could. It is that good. <br /> <br />My wife and I ordered this movie two months ago. Since then, we have watched it four times, each time with increasing enjoyment and delight at new nuances that come out with each viewing. <br /> <br />This movie is a masterpiece, the likes of which you see only once in a generation. Each character is fantastically rendered, with great voiceovers, lovely songs, hilarity, and a non-sentimental warmth. The story marches right along. There is not one dull moment in the entire movie. The drawings and the expressions are top-notch and superbly done. The photography and the artistry, as well as the recording itself, are breathtaking. <br /> <br />Disney should re-release this movie and make a new Broadway musical out of it. I really think this could become their biggest thing ever in terms of merchandising, movie ticket sales, theater income, and themed advertising.  <br />
B0007Y08IS|5.0|i dont really have to go into the details of the story of this movie, as almost everything pro and contra has been said, but regardless of what people think of its content, it is a really  a very well made movie. the producers have taken gerry andersons original 60's thunderbirds puppetry style and modernised it for a new generation and added a huge portion of overt sexuality. in doing so, they have managed to get away with many things that just wouldn't be allowed (let alone possible) with real live action. sure, it's daft and funny and completely over the top. personally, i actually loved this movie and for those who wish to own a copy, if you watch it over and over, you can discover new details each time you view it (such as the croissant shaped paving stones in the paris intro scene). the sound of this dvd is crisp and clear and the picture brilliant and sharp, with well balanced colours. one thing which no one mentions in any of the reviews however, is that this dvd is protected and therefore not suitable for chipped or re-programmed region 2 players, information which i think is important for uk, or european buyers. therefore be aware, team america is not suitable for children or chipped region 2 players.

I remember thinking, \\"Wow, this is probably the worst moment of my life.\\" I was wrong. Audioslave is like you stick Chris Cornell's whiny voice into a blender with Brad Wilk and YtimK's obvious hatred for music, and Tom Morello's \\"I-wish-I-was-Superman-because-I-want-to-save-the-world\\" attitude, puree, then pour it all down the sink because this album is TRASH. I'D RATHER HAVE AIDS THAN LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM. I wish God would make a choice. Kill me or Audioslave.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|Like most Phantom aficionados, I anxiously awaited the release of PHANTOM OF THE OPERA as a cinema release.  I anticipated sumptuous staging, terrific acting and, of course, musical performance at the highest levels.<br /><br />I got two out of the three.  PHANTOM OF THE OPERA is magnificently staged.  The stepping from black and white to color to indicate jumping back and forth in chronological time is superb.  When the theater, long forgotten and in decay, is suddenly transformed back in time to its former grandeur the effect is absolutely magical. Indeed, PHANTOM OF THE OPERA, from the standpoint of cinematography, is a feast for the eyes.<br /><br />I was equally impressed with the acting abilities of the major characters.  Each brings to the screen the necessary abilities to pull in the viewer with total believability.<br /><br />Andrew Lloyd Webber's score, turning to the foundation of the movie's music, is incomparable!  Truly a modern musical genius, Webber's tone poetry is movingly beautiful.  Which brings me to the vocal performances. Without mincing words, the vocal performance, especially when considering the stage work of Sarah Brightman and Michael Crawford, was absolutely appalling!  I could hardly believe it.  How did the composer allow such mediocrity? I suppose that he may have wanted to preserve the sanctity of the stage original but even then I was perplexed. While Ms. Rossum (Christine) was moderately fine (though not coming remotely close to Brightman's defining performance in the role) Gerard Butler (The Phantom) was awful.  Yes, he brought considerable feeling to the tortured character of the Phantom but, then, I have already praised the acting in this film. Ironically, the only person with a real voice in the cast, Minnie Driver, was not allowed to sing, having her voiced dubbed.<br /><br />So there it is. Three stars for the staging, acting and cinematography.  I just cannot get past the terrible vocal performances.  If you have never heard the original stage soundtrack or seen the piece on stage you may be fine.  Otherwise, be prepared for a feast for the eyes but not the ears.<br /><br />THE HORSEMANver heard the original stage soundtrack or seen the piece on stage you may be fine.  Otherwise, be prepared for a feast for the eyes but not the ears. <br /> <br />THE HORSEMAN  <br />
0780626966|4.0|This review refers to the bonus disc found in New Line Cinema's \\"The Nightmare on Elm Street Collection\\" boxed set. <br /> <br />THE WHO'S WHO: Starring Wes Craven, Robert Shaye, Sean Cunningham, Heather Langenkamp, Robert Englund, John Saxon, Rachel Talalay, Jack Sholder, Kevin Yagher, Dick Cavett, Chuck Russell, Frank Darabont, Dokken, Patricia Arquette, Renny Harlin, John Carl Buechler, Stephen Hopkins, The Fat Boys, Whodini, Clive Barker. (NR) Contains Very Mild Violence, Mild Profanity, Very Mild Gore, Very Brief Nudity and Mild Sexual Content; 240m.; 1999. Cumulative information for the film series as a whole includes an (R) rating for violence, gore, profanity, drug content, nudity and mild sexual content; 655m.; 1984-1994. The overall rating for the films included in this boxed set is four stars. For individual reviews of each film, please see separate titles. <br /> <br />WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?: Consummate \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" fans will be delighted by the inclusion of an eighth bonus disc as part of the series' boxed set. The central focus of this DVD is a \\"Labyrinth\\" video game, but all of the important documentary material that can be uncovered within the labyrinth is found on the index of the disc itself. However, the \\"Labyrinth\\" is the only place to uncover humorous outtakes and comedy interactions with Freddy Krueger. The bonus disc begins with the \\"Welcome to Primetime\\" (46:26) segment. Relevant members of the cast and crew for the original \\"Nightmare\\" film talk about the newspaper clippings that inspired the screenplay, how producer Robert Shaye was the only person who believed in director Wes Craven's script and how the original idea of Freddy Krueger was supposed to have him portrayed by a sixty or seventy year old man. Makeup man David Miller tells the story of how a pepperoni pizza inspired Freddy's face. There's also a small tidbit relating to the fact that New Line almost sold the \\"Nightmare\\" rights to Paramount. \\"Welcome to Primetime\\"concludes with the first alternate ending of the original \\"Elm Street\\" film. The index of the disc is divided into separate sections by film. The \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" section is just a breakdown of the \\"Welcome to Primetime\\" documentary with the addition of the film's trailer. Segments in this section include \\"Original Theatrical Trailer\\" (1:49), \\"It Really Happened\\" (3:03), \\"A Childhood Memory\\" (2:35), \\"Sometime in the Early 80's\\" (0:25), \\"So it Began\\" (4:47), \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" (8:42), \\"Making the Glove\\" (1:09), \\"Shapeshifter\\" (9:54), \\"The Shoot\\" (7:22), \\"The Revolving Room\\" (1:53), \\"All's Well That Ends Well\\" (4:04), \\"Talalay's Tally\\" (1:52), \\"It Couldn't Have Happened...\\" (1:51) and \\"Alternate Ending: Version 1\\" (2:00). The \\"Freddy's Revenge\\" section expresses Craven's concerns over the original screenplay for the sequel. We're also treated to horrendously bland interviews with director Jack Sholder who does nothing to bring perspective to his sequel, owing a lot of explanations and offering very few. He also sounds very indecisive of the choices he made now that he has the opportunity to look back on his film. Even production assistant Rachel Talalay admits the film's vast array of mistakes. Segments in this section include \\"Original Theatrical Trailer\\" (1:28), \\"Heroes and Villains\\" (6:23), \\"Psycho Sexual Circus\\" (3:28), \\"The Male Witch\\" (2:48) and \\"Freddy on 8th Street\\" (5:29). The \\"Dream Warriors\\" section finds Wes explaining how he wanted to take the film series to the next psychological level. Director Chuck Russell and screenplay writer Frank Darabont share discussions about the controversies surrounding the Freddy snake and the Robert Englund-improvised \\"welcome to prime time, b*tch\\" line. Englund is also on hand to relate a tale of how he had breakfast with transvestites across from the L.A. county jail. Segments in this section include \\"Original Theatrical Trailer\\" (1:37), \\"Fan Mail\\" (0:46), \\"Onward Christian Soldiers\\" (9:02), \\"Snakes and Ladders\\" (6:05), \\"Trading 8's\\" (4:10), \\"That's Show Biz\\" (2:01), \\"Burn Out\\" (3:39), \\"The House That Freddy Built\\" (0:39) and \\"Music Video: Dokken - Dream Warriors\\" (5:06). The \\"Dream Master\\" section finds Robert Shaye explaining how the 'stamina effect' helped director Renny Harlin get the job. Discussions are also held about how the writers' strike affected the outcome of the movie. Segments in this section include \\"Original Theatrical Trailer\\" (1:31), \\"Krueger, Freddy Krueger\\" (8:17), \\"Hopeless Chest\\" (3:46), \\"Let's Make-Up\\" (2:21) and \\"The Finnish Line\\" (2:28). The \\"Dream Child\\" section finds Talalay mentioning why her husband Rupert Harvey produced the fifth film and not her. Surprisingly, the Fat Boys music video was misplaced on the disc. Instead of appearing in the section for the fourth film where it belongs, it wound up here. Segments in this section include \\"Original Theatrical Trailer\\" (0:46), \\"Womb Raiders\\" (6:24), \\"The Sticky Floor\\" (5:46), \\"Take the Stairs\\" (0:57), \\"Hopkins Directs\\" (0:36), \\"A Slight Miscalculation\\" (1:27), \\"Music Video: Fat Boys - Are You Ready For Freddy?\\" (5:32) and \\"Music Video: Whodini - Anyway I Got to Swing it?\\" (3:26). The \\"Freddy's Dead\\" section is the lightest of all sections, though it does find Talalay talking about how the 3-D format of the finale limited her choice of special effects. Segments in this section include \\"Original Theatrical Trailer\\" (2:14), \\"Rachel's Dream\\" (2:50), \\"3D Demise\\" (2:19), \\"86'd\\" (1:41) and \\"Hellraiser\\" (0:40). The \\"New Nightmare\\" section focuses entirely on Craven himself. He discusses how he originally thought he would become a novelist and touches briefly on the friendship he shares with \\"Friday the 13th\\" creator Sean Cunningham. Segments in this section include \\"Original Theatrical Trailer\\" (2:41), \\"Becoming a Filmmaker\\" (7:55), \\"An Insane Troupe\\" (0:52), \\"Two Worlds\\" (2:04), \\"The Problem With Sequels\\" (1:36) and \\"Filmmaker\\" (4:38). The final section is entitled \\"Conclusions\\" and features horror master Clive Barker comparing Freddy's characteristics with Pinhead's. We're also able to see small sections of a 1989 interview with Robert Englund as he discusses the witty and sexy traits Freddy possesses. Segments in this section include \\"Where Gothic Plots Come From\\" (2:04), \\"Why We Like Gothic\\" (1:34), \\"Sadomasochism\\" (0:54), \\"Freddy v. Pinhead\\" (2:46), \\"Freddy's Manic Energy\\" (1:40), \\"Creating Lasting Characters in Horror\\" (1:33), \\"No More Magic Tricks\\" (2:28), \\"Monster With Personality\\" (0:33), \\"Freddy as Sex Machine\\" (1:59) and \\"Campfire Stories\\" (1:43). Overall, this is an enjoyable and highly informative way of killing four hours. <br /> <br />THEY SAY THEY'RE SPECIAL BUT...: The 1.33:1 full screen format is a solid presentation featuring even flesh tones, good coloring and stable black levels. The 5.1 surround sound is pointless during the documentary portions of the disc. The only time the surround sound really picks up is during the music videos and the theatrical trailers. Then the presence of the 5.1 is truly felt and truly appreciated. This bonus disc arrives packaged in one of New Line's atypical paper cases. The front cover features a fantastic \\"Hellywood\\" painting that fits the Freddy motif perfectly. The rest of the case is devoid of any artwork. The inside of the case spotlights the list of special features on this disc. The disc itself is painted with a montage of six different Freddy Krueger photographs. The entire disc is comprised of special features, however the ones not described above include the actual \\"Labyrinth\\" video game which is a wonderful way to experience the separate pieces of information for those who want to take the time. Graphics for this game are very entertaining and the sound quality is above par. DVD-ROM users are also treated to the final \\"Dream World\\" trivia game and an interactive Freddy that will \\"haunt\\" your computer. <br /> <br />THE YOLK'S ON YOU: New Line Cinema has packed their boxed set so well that they don'tneed to place hidden easter eggs on the separate discs. Of course, on this bonus disc, there are a few useful pearls of wisdom for the wary viewer. For starters, if you stand in one spot for too long at the entrance of the \\"Labyrinth\\" (where the question mark appears), Freddy will pop out of one of the doors on the left side of the hallway and quickly dart into one of the doors on the right. Also, if you make it down into the boiler room, look into the ashes of the furnace for awhile. Pretty soon, you'll be able to see the burning image of Freddy himself. Finally, for those viewers searching for the mythical \\"second alternate ending\\" to the film (which is not included as part of the index section on this disc), there's a very simple solution. When you come to the locked fire door, step up to it until you can see the individual diamond panes of the glass. There are three horizontal rows of clickable diamonds. Each row has four diamonds you can try. The alternate ending is hidden beneath the fourth diamond (the one farthest to the right) on the middle row. However, be warned that the \\"second alternate ending\\" is not worth the time it takes to find. Frankly, it's an incredible let down, even to a hardcore Freddy fanatic like myself. Forget the second alternate ending and try to uncover all the Krueger cut-ups instead. <br /> <br />THE LEWD AND NUDE ALERT: There is absolutely no stimulation on this bonus disc. However, since this is mostly a documentary forum, that's to be expected. <br /> <br />THE GORE REPORT: The bonus disc actually shows a bit of gore in the original theatrical trailer during Tina Gray's (Amanda Wyss) death sequence. <br /> <br />SAY AGAIN: \\"Sometimes a giant snake is just a giant snake. Yeah.\\" - Frank Darabont. \\"Exactly.\\" - Chuck Russell. \\"Which is why it wound up eating the little girl.\\" - Frank Darabont (during a conversation about the phallic symbolism of the Freddy snake from \\"Nightmare 3\\"). <br /> <br />THE FINAL SAY: Yes, I recommend buying this disc. As part of the \\"Nightmare on Elm Street Collection\\" boxed set, it provides an invaluable source of behind the scenes discussions and revelations. One wishes they would have had more interviews with the actual cast members of the films, but the crew members and Robert Englund provide a wealth of details. It's just a shame that this disc is not available separately as it stands very well on its own. Yes, I also recommend buying the boxed set itself. This is an efficient way of acquiring all seven films and is the only way you can receive the bonus disc. <br /> <br />PLAY IT AGAIN, SAM: \\"Freddy's Favorites: The Best of a Nightmare on Elm Street\\" Available on Varese Sarabande Compact Discs.

It's also about the places you will explore as you get older.<br /><br />It is a pretty easy book to read, it is not a chapter book. It is filled with pictures of colorful, weird, creative Dr. Seuss places.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to people who like easy and short books that are outside of the box.

(Although lets face it, it had to happen!) <br /> <br />I've never read any of the Shopaholic series (gasp!) and I'm not really a fan of girly-sugary books - possibly because I don't really give them a chance, but I must admit - I really enjoyed this book! <br /> <br />The book is well paced with some brilliant characters (Kelly and Jemima have got to be my favorites) and although the humor didn't make me laugh out loud I did smile pretty much the whole way through.  <br /> <br />The four stars instead of five are because I felt it could have been a bit funnier and it was a little predictable in parts (but this was also part of its charm!) <br /> <br />If you're looking for a quick, sugary sweet read where you don't have to think this'll be it.  <br /> <br />I look forward to trying the Shopaholic series because, whether I like it or not, this book had me hooked! <br />
B000001ESN|5.0|The blazing, famous guitar riff that begins \\"The Spirit of Radio\\" lets you know you're in for something entirely different with this record, and indeed on this album, Rush shakes off the last vestiges of their metal youth and fully flowers into maturity.  <br /> <br />Maturity in rock tends to mean going the way of \\"adult contemporary\\", but its the wrong way to think of this album-- its only with a calm assuredness that comes with experience in any field could such a bold statement be made, while it is the next step in the evolution of the band, they've pretty much abandoned their old song-- gone are the screamed vocals, the thunderous distorted guitar, instead a fully integrated synthesizer sound and expressive vocal takes hold. Not to say mind you that there isn't some incredible power trio work on here-- these guys have not forgotten how to play!  <br /> <br />The opening two tracks were the singles from the album, \\"The Spirit of Radio\\", with its great intro, killer verses, totally self-assured vocal from Geddy Lee, reggae bridge, and monster guitar solo from Alex Lifeson was and should have been a hit. \\"Freewill\\" is a bit different, more riff-based, structure based, also a good song, but not quite reaching the heights of the opener. What follows, however, may have been quite unexpected, \\"Jacob's Ladder\\"-- calm, patient, building tension. Synth washed, with some great subtle drums, and really made possible in this more subtle manner because of Lee's confident vocal delivery. Its really amazing listening to this album against the older ones to see just how much he's matured over the first several years of Rush's career. \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" is also the first signpost in the next direction the band would take, where synthesizers and keyboards become as important as guitars to the band's music.  <br /> <br />The album does kind of drift a bit after \\"Jacob's Ladder\\", neither \\"Entre Nous\\" or \\"Different Strings\\" are terribly memorable (the former does have a really heartfelt vocal delivery of sweet lyrics by drummer Neil Peart, but really isn't much to note). In many ways, these, like the three that proceed them, are Rush feeling out the future.  <br /> <br />\\"Natural Science\\" is a bit different, and over the previous couple tracks, a bit better-- as close to a return to the older sound as this album gets, it churns and boils and overflows, and like the epics one earlier albums, does have sections, but like the rest of this album, it has that confidence of delivery that prevents them from getting too self-indulgent.  <br /> <br />\\"Permanant Waves\\" is by a band that's been there, done that, and kept moving, only without a doubt they've hit their stride now, there's precious little thats not superb here.
B000002GJH|5.0|What more can you say. Temple Of The Dog's tribute album to Andy Wood of Mother Love Bone(another fantastic band, that i recommend highly)can sometimes bring me to tears with its sheer poetry and heartfelt lyrics. Chris Cornell and company go all out on this one, reaching deep down to the bottom of their hearts and souls to create some of the most passionate rock n'roll music i've ever heard, you MUST own this record. Make no mistake, music like this doesn't exist in 2005 where most artists have as much depth as a glass of water with the exception of very few. Bottom Line: BUY THIS RECORD *sigh* i miss the early 90's
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|This is probably my favorite album of 2005 so far. System of a Down has always been a very awsome band. With there unique sound, protesting lyrics, heavy riffs, and some funny stuff, they are one of the best bands of today. And this album is no exception. It starts off with the intro, Soldier Side, a slower kind of moody peace and transferrs my personal favorite track, BYOB. From there, it is just a roller coster ride of insanity. I say, if you are a system of a down fan, you should definatly have this album
B0000E64TR|5.0|By 1973, Elton John had moved from the realm of critic's darling to commercial success with the back to back numer one albums \\"Honky\\" Chateau\\" and \\"Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player\\". The next album, however seemed risky: a double album, with some songs stretching over 4:00. However, the gamble that was \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" proved to pay off, as it spawned four chart hits, topped the album charts for eight weeks and is regarded as one of the greatest pop albums of all time.<br /><br />For this 30th anniversary SACD edition, the cd has been split into two discs, like the original lp. It also has a beautiful booklet with lots of nice photos, lyrics and a brilliant essay.<br /><br />Disc One starts with the 11 minute epic \\"Funeral For A Friend/Love Lies Bleeding\\". Beginning with a chilling synth intro, it segues into a fast instrumental into an all out, take no prisoners rocker. Solid way to open the album. The next song may well be Elton's signature song. \\"Candle In The Wind\\" is indeed the original 1973 version of \\"Candle In The Wind\\", this one being a haunting ode to Marilyn Monroe. This song took on new resonance when Elton and lyricist Bernie Taupin rewrote it as a tribute to Princess Diana in 1997 and it became the biggest selling single of all time, but this version is still my favorite. \\"Bennie And The Jets\\" was the album's biggest hit, topping the charts. It is one of my favorite Elton songs, from its commanding piano thumps on the intro the sizzling organ solo at the end. A true classic. The next song is the era defining title track (and a number two hit). This song spoke to a generation of dislillusioned flower children of the 1960s' and early 1970s', as their hopes and dreams of peace and love burnt up and they were forced to fight in a war they did not want. Or at least this my interpretation of the song. No matter what the song is actually about, it's still a genuine classic. After this mini hit parade comes the underrated gem \\"This Song Has No Title\\". It lyrics harken bark to Elton and Bernie's esoteric earlier works like \\"Take Me To The Pilot\\". I like this song because Elton is the only musician on it but manages to capture all the ensity of a full band. The next track, \\"Grey Seal\\", was originally recorded in 1970 in a mellower, slower arrangement. This rerecording is given a much better arrangement, complete with pounding piano riffs and a great percussion section to boot. The next song, \\"Jamiaca Jerk - Off\\", is a happy reggae number. The title of the song may have seemed risque for 1973, but there is nothing offensive about this sweet ode to fun in the sun. Closing out side one is the ballad \\"I've Seen That Movie Too\\". This brooding ballad is a great way to close out this album.<br /><br />Disc Two kicks off with the beautiful ode to a prostitute, \\"Sweet Painted Lady\\" is one or Elton's best songs ever, hands down. It is so perfect in voice and music. I went to see him in 1999 in a solo show, and he performed this song flawlessly. \\"The Ballad Of Danny Bailey\\" (1909-1934)\\" is highlighted by the gunshot like insistency of Nigel Olsson's drumming, which is spellbinding and sobering at the same time. \\"Dirty Little Girl\\" can easily be judged as the weakest track here. However, this novelty has enough moxy to keep it in league with the rest of the album's tracks. Next is my favorite song on the album. \\"All The Young Girls Love Alice\\" is a no holds barred rocker complete with a charging rhythm section, a strong guitar sound and intense piano playing. This is a great song, and it deserved its place on the \\"To Be Continued...\\" boxed set. The next track, \\"Your Sister Can't Twist (But She Can Rock 'N' Roll\\" is a catchy pastiche to fifties rock and roll, while the next song is a true Elton classic. I can't think of anything to describe \\"Saturday Night's Alright (For Fighting)\\", except that it's one of the single greatest rock songs ever written. \\"Roy Rogers\\" is a mellow ode to the cowboy, and is definitely oneof the most underrated songs of his. \\"Social Disease\\" will be deemed forgettable to most, however I really like it. The next track is definitely a keeper. \\"Harmony\\" is one of the greatest pop songs ever written. A true moment of pop perfection.<br /><br />To commemorate the album's 30th anniversary, they've added bonus tracks. However, this is disappointing, since any fan knows that these three tracks were on the remastered 1995 edition of \\"Don't Shoot Me, I'm Only The Piano Player\\". Which is not to say they are bad songs. In fact, they're all very good. \\"Whenever You're Ready, We'll Go Steady Again\\" is a wild, Jerry Lee Lewis style rocker that is one of my favorite Elton songs. \\"Jack Rabbit\\" is another novelty number, but I like it nonetheless. \\"Screw You (Young Man's Blues)\\" rocks out, playfully capturing teen angst. The one previously unreleased track is an acoustic \\"Candle In The Wind\\". It's basically the original \\"Candle...\\" only with all signs of the electric guitar cut out.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of the greatest albums ever made and an aboslute must have. Go out and buy \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" as soon as possible.y one of the most underrated songs of his. \\"Social Disease\\" will be deemed forgettable to most, however I really like it.

B00000I9MK|3.0|This album is the debut from the Scottish duo and some of the elements that made DEAR CATASTROPHE WAITRESS a lovely surprise discovery for me are here: quirky literate lyrics and at times catchy pop. However, this also suffers quite often from pretentious lyrics (i.e. deliberately obscure and precious to try and show how intelligent the writers are) and the mistaken belief that underproduced is better.<br /><br />HIGHLIGHTS:<br />Best tunes here are the \\"I'm done with men\\" tune of \\"She's Losing It\\", \\"You're Just a Baby\\" and the schooldays awkwardness in \\"Expectations\\". The heroine in \\"Mary Jo\\" is also winsome and the vocal contributions from Isabelle add to the song.<br /><br />LOWS:<br />Worst here are the avant garde synth noodling of \\"Electronic Renaissance\\", which either samples or outright steals the pattern in Pat Benatar's \\"Love is a Battlefield\\" (as someone else correctly noted) and is an outright bad song. Other tunes cross the thin line between clever and pompous (the \\"see how well-read we are\\" Rip Van Winkle spoken bit in \\"I Could be Dreaming\\", the pseudo philosophizing of \\"We Rule the School\\").<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br />This is one to buy if you like to tell people you know more about music than they do. But in the long run, there's really not that much here musically. You're better off with DEAR CATASTROPHE WAITRESS or BOY WITH THE ARAB STRAP.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I saw Wicked in Toronto, sadly I didn't get to see the originals on broadway, but Stephanie Block and Kendra Kassebaum (as Elphaba and Glinda respectively) were perfect.  It was fantastic and I can't wait to see it again.  There are no words to describe how much I love this CD.   It is perfect to belt out in the car.  I hadn't heard Idina Menzel before but she shines in the role of Elphie and proves she can really sing.  I mean, with some of the notes she holds, the girl has to have a third lung.  Kristin Chenoweth is funny and lovable as Glinda, and the role showcases her voice perfectly.  Even if you haven't seen the production my advice is to get the CD, learn all the words and GO SEE WICKED.  You'll love it!!!  It will never leave your discman/CD player/car.  It'll make you happy.  And the music will forever be stuck in your head.  Which is a good thing.
B00005JNEW|5.0|I am now a high school senior in Florida who plays football.  This movie spoke volumes about how serious football is, not just in Texas, but the South as a whole.  Peter Berg does a fantastic job of creating a world where football is king, a placing the right amount of intensity, emotion, and pace into it.  This movie IS high school football in the South.  There is nothing like the feeling of winning a game and being widely celebrate by fans and classmates and people you dont even know.  These kids were seen as heros.  But it is more dynamic to see what issues the 'heroes' had to deal with. They were mostly average to below average students trapped in a world of no escape, no hope, no passion other than football.  I know exactly how some of these kids end up, and after they have such highs at a young age it is depressing to see some fall from youth.  It proves a point about education and balance.  The score is amazing and Explosions In The Sky could of been up for an Oscar.  Great acting all around and really good football action.  One of my top 15 all time.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Well i will start off by saying that this album is tight. SOAD will always find a way for something in their songs to stick to you. BUT i expected more songs and a little more of what they are use to banging out. Yes hypnotize will come out soon but when you are a fan and you know what you should expect from an album then it leaves you a little empty. But dont get me wrong this album is HEAVY and SOAD RULES!!
0792843584|2.0|You have to acknowledge Cimino's contribution to cinema. He gave us both the most over-rated film in history (The Deer Hunter) and the worst film in history (Heaven's Gate)- although I give it a second star for visuals. .  For 20+ years I listened to the critics and avoided &#34;Heaven's Gate&#34;-actually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film. Then a few days after seeing the documentary: 'Final Cut: The Making and Unmaking of Heaven's Gate', I stumbled on a used $9.99 DVD of the long version. My advice after 229 minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this film (you will find a wide selection), and imagine that the reviewer is Cimino's devoted mother and that she is doing everything she can to put a positive slant on her dear son's movie. Then you will have an idea of just how big a mess Cimino made.  If that is not enough here are some descriptions of Dennis Hopper's &#34;The Last Movie&#34; which are equally applicable to Cimino: &#34;gaseous and overblown mess, puerile, it is narcissistic but not introspective, self-gratification, overwhelming egotism, an extravagant mess, inflated pretensions, an embarrassment, an endless, chaotic, suffocating, acid-soaked movie, the work of a kid playing with a toy&#34;.  While pretty much everything is wrong with this film, what ultimately tips the scale to make it the worse ever (and a classic 'less than zero' example) is its shameless distortion of history. Although the cattlemen's association did send a group of regulators/gunmen to Johnson County and did have a list of targeted names, the actual facts of an interesting historical event are hopelessly exaggerated. On the morning of April 9, 1892, Nick Ray and Nate Champion were besieged and eventually killed by an army of about 50 cattlemen and Texas hired guns who had come to Johnson County to clean out &#34;rustlers.&#34; The citizens of the county then besieged the regulators who finally werearrested (or rescued) by the Army. Women did not actively participate in the fighting and aside from Ray and Champion there were minimal casualties. After all, these were sieges not assaults-and there were not wagons of immigrants riding in circles around the encampment of regulators (early westerns to the contrary this was a film making device and not an actual tactic of the Indians). And weeks prior to the arrival of the regulators a number of Johnson County residents were hanged without trial including Jim Averell, the keeper of a modest road ranch, and his wife Ella Watson (who Cimino resurrects as his two leads and he even shows Averell living to a ripe old age).  There is no movie-making sin greater than fictionalizing history, if you are going to play fast and loose with historical facts, then change the names and locations to protect the unsuspecting audience members who might go away from a film believing what they saw actually happened. Fortunately so few people saw this film that the damage was minimal. Perhaps it is harsh to blame Cimino for his distortion of history. He could probably escape blame anyway with an insanity defense-the film provides plenty of support. If Cimino was insane during the production of Heaven's Gate it would explain a lot of things. But my vote goes to 'lack of directing talent' instead of insanity.  There are some good things about Heaven's Gate. You can actually see on the screen where some of the huge budget went; expensive sets-beautiful epic camera shots-artful dance sequences. Isabelle Huppert (a strange casting choice that actually worked) gives an agreeable and likable performance although most of her scenes are extremely boring (that tends to happen when the director forgets to give the viewer any reason to care about the characters). The dialogue is generally solid if rather ordinary.  But don't fall for the crap that this film experiments with storytelling by intermixing carefully crafted moments of character interaction with textured pageant-like explosions of communal action. This implies that there was a method to Cimino madness. 'Experiments' is another word for when a filmmaker gets so lost in his project that a coherent story is no longer possible. The simple fact is that there is no evidence Cimino storyboarded a single scene or made any attempt at control or organization. What it looks like is that he just turned his DP loose to stage action and to get an endless selection of colorful shots-1.5 million feet of loosely staged scenes. Then he tried (without success) to pare this down and fit everything together in post-production.  The final battle scene is genuinely hilarious as babushka wearing townswomen (perhaps borrowed from a 'Fiddler On The Roof' touring company) throw countless sticks of dynamite at the regulators. Unfortunately each explosive falls just short of the target and explodes harmlessly. After you see this happen 50-60 times you can relate to the woman (the one who looks like something out of 'The Grapes of Wrath') who puts a huge gun in her mouth and pulls the trigger. This is probably what Cimino's mother did after writing that review.  So believe what you have been hearing about this film since 1980. It is a sloppy, disconnected, poorly paced, and historically distorted mess. Of value only as a 'how not to make a film' example for film historians and as a source of amusement to those knowledgeable about the actual history of the American west.  Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B000059MEK|5.0|daft punk has really scored a 10 out of 10 on this cd. it goes from hi enegry that makes you want to party all night(Aerodynamic)(One More Time) to chill out and spend time with someone you care about(Something about Us). this is one cd that will certainly be around for years to come and also be forever part of the greatesthits of all time. Normally echno cds have one hit but this cd has all hits.
1401301010|5.0|At first I really didnt know what to expect from this book. I started off thinking this was just going to be a typical rock star story, how wrong I was. Anthony reveals all in this book, everything from his childhood in Grand Rapids and later in Hollywood and later describes his first encounters with drugs and sex. And how drug addiction has been a never ending story for him untill now. I highly encourgae everybody to read this book I entered this book a fan of the chilli peppers and Anthony and leave it with a more profound respect for all of them. I am just thankful that Anthony let us in his life and see what it is like to be a person with an ongoing problem with addiction and still manages to overcome it with his own strong will.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I would probably put this album above \\"Steal This Album,\\" below \\"Toxicity,\\" and tied with \\"System of a Down.\\"  There is not a single forgettable song on this disc, be it the (what a local D.J. called) \\"thrash-polka\\" vibe of \\"Radio/Video\\" or the mournful sound of the last track, \\"Lost in Hollywood.\\"  Unfortunately, it seems as if the lyrics on this disc have taken the backburner to this music.  Less of the lyrical evolution can be seen on this disc as opposed to System's earlier material, but they more than compensate for this with the complex riffing and song structure.  I would highly recommend this album, if only for \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song.\\"
B000002BPS|5.0|I listen to the radio A LOT, and let me tell you, I hear the Offspring A LOT. And I've liked almost every one of their songs. One day, I heard another Offspring song and finally decided, \\"I'm tired of just hearing this band on the radio! I'm buying one of their CDs!\\" So, since this was the album that lots of people say is their best, I got it. This is one of the Offspring's least commercial albums, with the only songs you'd hear on the radio being Gone Away and occasionally The Meaning of Life.<br /><br />  This is Offspring's fourth full-length studio album and I must say, it's GREAT! There are a few songs that aren't exactly great and are basically filler, but there are so many good songs, it keeps it from being a flop album.<br /><br />  I'll go through all of the songs and rate them from a scale of 1(absolutely awful and it's a crime to make this song) to 10(GREAT!)<br /><br />1. The Disclaimer- All The Disclaimer is is the worthless intro that tells how offensive the album is. The album really isn't too offensive, but the guy talking makes it an actually good intro. I won't rate it, just because it's a waste of time to waste a 30-second song.<br /><br />Rating: NONE<br /><br />2. The Meaning of Life- A great way to start a great album. One of the only two commercial songs on the CD. One of the best songs here.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10<br /><br />3. Mota- I don't really like this song. It's not one of the strong points of this CD. There's not much to say, it's just not very good.<br /><br />Rating: 7/10<br /><br />4. Me & My Old Lady: This is actually a pretty good song, except for the parts where Dexter Holland(singer) says \\"She ain't no ball and chain\\" 19 times. That's really annoying. The music in this song is really good and so is the chorus, but the rest just isn't nothing special.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10<br /><br />5. Cool To Hate: Cool song where Holland sings about how he hates everything. This is my favorite song on the CD and will probably stay as my favorite Offspring song of all time. The whole song is flawless and there is no reason anyone would not like this song. FLAWLESS.<br /><br />Rating: 11/10<br /><br />6. Leave It Behind: This is a really good song, not as good as Meaning of Life or Cool To HAte, but this is pretty good.<br /><br />Rating: 9/10<br /><br />7. Gone Away: I really like this song. It's more depressing and emotional than anything else on the CD, and it is also one of the slower songs on the disc. This is the song that they play the most on the radio on the CD, and it's no surprise why. 2nd best on the CD.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10<br /><br />8. I Choose: This is one of the best songs of the CD. Funny lyrics. For example: \\"Now if I wasn't such a weenie, Do you think you'd still love me? Pretending I'm an airplane, On the living room floor!\\" Ha ha ha! One of the many songs on the CD that just wants to make you dance.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10<br /><br />9. Intermission: Intermission? I think this is the only CD that I've ever seen that has an intermission. But, hey, they even make it a little interesting and fun! Although it's just a little elevator music, the guy is going \\"Aaaah...\\" and making weird sounds. Wonder what he's doing? This needs no rating.<br /><br />Rating: NONE<br /><br />10. All I Want: This is a good song, and deserves just about the same rating as \\"Leave it Behind\\". It's good, but not the best. Not as good as I Choose, Gone Away, Meaning of Life and many others.<br /><br />Rating: 9/10<br /><br />11. Way Down the Line: This is a good song that tells about. even though you don't want to, most likely, you'll turn out like your parents. It's a really good song and one of the stronger points of the CD.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10<br /><br />12. Don't Pick It Up: This is a really good song and is one of the faster of the CD. Better than Way Down The Line, but not as good as some others.<br /><br />Rating: 10/10<br /><br />13. Amazed: \\"Amazed\\" is another slow, emotional song, just like \\"Gone Away\\". But, in my opinion, this one's not as good. I don't think this is very good. It's just okay.<br /><br />Rating: 8/10<br /><br />14. Change the World: This is a good song and a great way to end the CD. It's one of the better songs, but it's not as great as some others.<br /><br />Rating: 9/10<br /><br />  Okay, I'm done. All in all, this is a good CD and is great for any Offspring fan. Also, if this was your first CD by the Offspring, I'd recommend it, also. To finish up the review, I'll say what the best songs were and what songs they should have left out.<br /><br />The best songs...<br /><br />The Meaning of Life!!<br /><br />Cool to Hate!!!!<br /><br />Gone Away!!!<br /><br />I Choose!!!<br /><br />Way Down the Line!!<br /><br />Don't Pick it Up!!<br /><br />The songs that are just filler...<br /><br />Intermission...<br /><br />Mota...<br /><br />Me & My Old Lady...<br /><br />Okay, to summarize, BUY IT!s one's not as good. I don't think this is very good. It's just okay. <br />Rating: 8/10 <br /> <br />14. Change the World: This is a good song and a great way to end the CD.

0142000663|5.0|This last week I finished reading The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck. If you have not found your way to this book yet, you need too. Spawning from the Great Depression era, this intriguing piece follows the downfall of the Joad family on their cross country trip to California. The age of industry and of the machine forces the Joad's off their farm, and having few options, they pile into their broken down truck towards California in hopes of big jobs and big dreams. The Grapes of Wrath is a wonderful historical piece of fiction that is a must read for every American. It brings to life every American issue; the American Dream, family, capitalism, religion, and sexuality, as well as numerous others. I recommend reading this book in the Spring or Summer as it is very dark, but it has to be. It is a long book, with a controversial ending that still has people talking.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System continues to DOMINATE the music industry.  ALthough they may never top their first release this album proves to not dissapoint.  If you feel like losing touch and gettin' all sorts of sill pick up this album now.
B000062YB1|2.0|Like I said about South of Heaven: a lame attempt to sound relevant, poetic, and evolved.  But much of it sounds even more  strained and out-of-character than SOH.  Slightly more thrashy than SOH, but not in a good way.    They got rid of the cheezy monster-movie riffs which plagued SOH.  But they kept the dull, whiny vocals.  I guess Tom needed a few years to rest his voice after Reign In Blood.    On the plus side, \\"Hallowed Point\\" and \\"Born of Fire\\" are classic Slayer--more or less...  \\"War Ensemble\\"--a fan favorite for some reason--is awkward, as if they tried too hard to sound edgy, aggressive, and political.    If you're new to Slayer, I recommend their pre-SOH material, especially RIB.  If you're a hard-core fan after hearing RIB, or just curious, go ahead and try this, as you might agree with other fans who say this is their second best album.    Songwriting: 5/10   Musicianship: 8/10   Sound Quality: 7/10   Originality: 5/10  Listenability: 3/10
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Excellent album. It's insane, intense and instantly likeable. Yes, it has some intentional funny moments and some politics but so did Frank Zappa. If Zappa had done some heavy rock-this would be it. Though it's extreme it's also catchy. Recommended higly.
B0006M4SO6|4.0|Having just been given this album the other day it has made quite an impression on me. Although it is not the 'highest' music I have ever heard it has many beautiful moments and the recording sounds great. I've been off listening to other things for a while so to hear the lyricism of Metheny and Mays is refreshing to say the least.   Other reviewers have described the album in some detail so I won't. What I do want to remark upon is how many reviewers seem to have a very stale and fixed idea of what 'jazz' is and how they pour scorn over anything that does not conform to their limited ideas. This attitude has been a factor ever since Davis started to experiment with different sounds and forms and has continued in the Masarlis vein, etc. So what is jazz? Does it have to be an endless rehash of bebop in 'clever' contexts - nods and winks to the establishment and those who only want to be reinforced and not challenged? Or do we have to play the same standards over and over again? How much can you do with that music that hasn't already been done now? Isn't that why a lot of contemporary jazz sounds so dead and uninspiring? Beyond which quote to pull in the next moment, the spontaneity has been left behind somewhere.  Personally, I am relieved to hear Metheny steering away from yet another 'jazz' album and towards something that's actually sort of unique.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|If there was any proof that the guys behind South Park were genuises in their own right this movie is it.  It is funny, brutal, and in many cases down right wrong.<br /><br />The story here is that the Secret Task force of Team America hires on an actor to infultrate the terrorist in order to stop them.  After some success the whole organization is thrown into chaos by Kim Jong Il, the leader of Northern Korea and the Film Acotrs Guild (or F.A.G.).  It is up to the actor to save the day and protect the world from terrorist.<br /><br />This movie is very funny, but very wrong.  This movie features everything from brutal violence and gore, strong language, to Puppet Sex.  Yes Puppet Sex.  This is a movie that is not intended for a young audience.  In fact if there is any flaw to this movie its that in many respects it is going to offend a fairly large audience.  This movie is funny, but a little much for some.
0975991477|5.0|This is an amazing book that is sure to become a classic, ushering a paradigmatic change in long overdue thinking, which is holistic and spiritual-based.    Holding back little in terms of passion, Dr. Lipton reveals that the real illness of society is modern medicine and science.    Instead of such silly notions as genes having influence on illness, Dr. Lipton reveals that beliefs are more important.    Such breakthrough thinking will surely be resisted by the status quo, who want to maintained their dominance.     Instead of being hostages to their tyrannical, dogmatic hold, we have the new hope from the salvation of belief!

B00005JNBQ|1.0|A comedy is supposed to make you laugh, or so I am told.  If that is the case then why is this movie being called by so many as one of the funniest movies in years.  The whole time I watched it I maybe chuckled once, and even that was probably forced.  This movie is dull, stupid, and ultimatly pointless.<br /><br />The story here is that Napoleon is a high school student who seemingly gets no respect.  He makes friends with a hispanic student who transfers in and a girl who one day tried to sell him crap.  After his guardian gets injured in a ATV accident his Uncle moves in to care for them, and all he can think about is a get rich quick scheme.  The movie drags along at an unbearably slow pace and ultimatly is not funny.<br /><br />I am told it gets better with repeat viewings but the question is, if the movie sucks to begin with, why watch it again.  That's like saying \\"I shot myself in the foot, but I don't remember what it felt like so lets do it again.\\"<br /><br />Avoid, end of story.  Worst comedy in years.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of a down has established a style from their previously released albums. This album is different musically, sometimes, but still has the raw political vocals that make you think about america. I loved this album cause it was a huge suprise. System is not as hard and progressive in this album as they were previously. It is like they are establishing a new style off their old style and making a collaberation of amazing metal. This album kicks buttox and will make you think!!! BUY IT: <br />1. Soilder Side- Intro: 4/5 This was a good opening.  <br />2. B.Y.O.B.: 5/5: Great lyrics in this song. It was bringing back systems old stuff, the album does not sound like this all the time.  <br />3. Revenga: 4.5/5: Makes you think, but isnt perfect..you wonder what the lyrics mean...are they subliminal?? <br />4. Cigaro: 4/5: This song has a lot of lyrics that are all over and make no sense. It is cool because it brings back the rawer edge style of steal this album, more specifically \\"chicken stu.\\" <br />5. Radio/Video: 5/5: A excellent track on this masterpiece. If this isnt my favorite, it is my second favorite. It has great music, but the lyrics are a little unmeaningful.  <br />6. This Cocain make me feal like im on this song: 4.5/5: Has excellent guitar that really makes you want to mosh. Lots of Vocals! I loved this album..defineetly system style.  <br />7.

Question: 4.5/5A new style, again. I liked the vocals and the progressive choruses.. <br />9. Sad Statue: 5/5: Amazing opening and throughout the whole song just completely rocked ass. I loved this song, one of the best.  <br />10. Old School Holleywood: 4.5/5: Another more slow to progressive song. It was great, but not excellent. Good guitars, weird vocals...makes you think. It is very electronical.  <br />11. Lost in Hollywood: 5/5: A perfect song to end an excellent album. You can wait to hear the next album so the story and journey can end. This is a slower song, new style, but is excellent! Vocals and music are excellent! Excellent! Ecellent! <br />WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR, GO GET THIS ALBUM NOW!!!!!!!!
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|This is a simply good album. Although it doesnt compare to Toxicity or the S/T, it brings a more progressive style in the band. Malakian is the main focus on this cd rather than Serj compared to their past material, possibly since he co-produced the cd with Rick Rubin. Expect him on every song because he does get greedy as the backup vocalist. The entire cd is very energetic but don't expect too many stand out songs like from \\"Toxicity.\\" \\"BYOB\\" and \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" appear to be the only songs going to get good radio airtime. I am looking forward to \\"Hypnotize\\" where i heard bootlegged live versions of \\"Kill Rock Stars\\" and \\"Holy Mountain\\" which both sound very good.
0385510454|2.0|I read all of his books and enjoyed all of them including the bleacher unlike some saying it's a deviation.  Either he got lazy from his success and money or he lost his touch finally and unfortunately.  The book reads as if it's written by some assistant of his trying hard to be Grisham but not quite.  Something is missing.  Why so much tourism?  Was it sponsored by the Italian bureau of tourism?  I know it was necessary but he was overly impressed by his visit to Italy.  What about the ending?  Pathetic.  These days a mere million doesn't cut anything.  I'll still read his next book hoping it would be much better than this one.
B000002UB3|5.0|Could any band close such an unbelievable career as well as The Beatles? Wow. This album is a thing of beauty. Highly recognized as one of the greatest albums of all time, Abbey Road is one of those achievements that really seemed like it was planned.<br /><br />To begin, we start with Come Together, a well known composition that has all the components of making a great song. The chorus is excellent, as is the loveable intro. Of course Something is one of The Beatles' best guitar melodies, written by none other than the guitar master George Harrison. A classic solo. Continuing into the album, we reach typical Beatles tunes, all great, which include Maxwell's Silver Hammer, OH! Darling, and a rare composition by Mr. Starkey. However corny it may seem, it will have you singing along. Now we've made it to my favourite. This is one of the most incredible guitar melodies I've ever heard coming from I Want You(She's So Heavy), and I think the fact that this song goes for a lengthy 7 minutes and 44 seconds makes it all the more worthwhile. Lyrically, it is impressive in its simplicity, but it has within it a very well structured tune, brought up again and again. George Harrison will be most known for the next tune, Here Comes The Sun, a beautiful guitar strum that aspiring artists dream about writing. As we get into the 2nd side of Abbey Road, we begin to hear especially nice harmonies, first coming from You Never Give Me Your Money. So well tied together, when I was listening to the album on my discman for the first time, I didn't even notice they had moved on to another song. Mean Mr. Mustard seems to shine quite brightly in the mix of tracks for me, as does She Came In Through The Bathroom Window. Carry That Weight is just a phenomenal track, for its lyrical power and passion. The last 2 songs nicely end the career of a rock n' roll group who managed to achieve praise as the greatest band of all time.<br /><br />The Beatles were one of a kind, and I can only highly recommend really any of their studio albums. Abbey Road seems to be a must have though, and fits nicely in the casual fans' collection too. My recommendations for other Beatles albums would be Revolver, Rubber Soul, Magical Mystery Tour, Sgt. Peppers, and this delight. However, all choices are excellent.<br /><br />Note: I am aware that Let It Be was released after Abbey Road. However, this was their last studio recording, therefore in my mind marks the end of their career.ny of their studio albums.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|As an avid music fan, and a huge System of a Down fan, I will give my full analysis of Mesmerize: <br /> <br /> <br />The word from the UK, where the album was released earlier than in the United States, was mixed. I read in trepedation as many SOAD fans were displeased with the \\"new sound\\". They spoke of the band going too mainstream (a complaint mirrored here) and of Daron signing too much. I downloaded several tracks before the album was released and, to my digust, was horrified with what I heard. It was horrible music (save for Cigaro and B.Y.O.B. which I thought was only a 'decent' song.) <br /> <br />So, with much sadness I bought Mesmerize as any true fan would. What I heard shocked and appaled me : the songs I had downloaded on the internet were mislabeled and wrong- and the UK reviewers I had believed were direly mistaken- this is the System of a Down most fans know and love!! I have heard many complaints, and shared a few, before I took an unbiased listen and made my drew my own conclusions. <br /> <br />I would like to point out that I do not believe System of a Down have changed their sound much. I know that is not the popular opinion but I see the System from Toxicity and Steal this Album! present in many songs here. Tell me Cigaro, Revenga, and This Cocaine... don't sound like other songs: we have Serj coming in with fast guitar backing and the same old (not in a bad way) fast-chanting singing. On Mesermize they have strayed slightly from traditonal 'Nu Metal' or what classification you considered them and experimented a bit more- but within their normal parameters. Radio/Video mixes in some Russian and even Reggea influence, Question! has some latin influences....but this is still System of a Down. We hear chaos: insane melodies, haphazard disjointed riffs and tempos that come together and make beauty. Take out the purely metalaic riffs of Toxicity, look deep, and tell me this isn't what we always received from System. How have they sold out, or changed??? This is just a slightly new mix of sounds....but I wouldn't even consider the difference enough to call it 'their new direction'. I simply disagree that SOAD has changed. They have grown, and experimented, but remained the band we know. <br /> <br />Problems? The disc has been long anticipated. We saw Toxicity 4 years ago, Steal this Album! was not a new release but a compliation. Of course fans are miffed that it's short! This doesn't subtract from the artistic value or quality at all- but it does seem (and this comes from a VERY big fan) to maybe be a marketing ploy. These are real men behind all their morals and political activist belifs. They are a major label band, they appear on Saturday Night Live, have news stories on MSNBC and undergo interviews by Billboard. They want money! That doesn't make them any less gifted...but it does make the length (after us waiting) somewhat saddening. Not enough to upset me, but understand anyone who thinks it does. I know the band has said they split the album into two for artistic and digestive reasons, but I am not sure I buy it. <br /> <br />The only other problem we see hear is a lessening of Serj on vocals. Daron is good...but I find him slightly annoying on songs like Old School Hollywood- can't anyone agree with this? Listen to 'Tony Danza cuts in line' three times over. It becomes a bit grating. We all love System or we wouldn't be here and up to this point it has been mostly Serj singing; that is what lead singers do. Those who don't know, though, should learn that Serj has mentioned that System of a Down is only ONE of his many projects. He had a Jazz rendition on 'Bird up!' a remix of a classic Jazz legend, and was featured with his Axis of Justice ([...]) on many single and collabarative tracks. We may be seeing Serj handing over the reins to Daron- go to Billboard's website and read the interview. Here is an excerpt: <br /> <br /> <br />\\"I'm starting to compose music for films,\\" Tankian says, \\"and I don't like being committed to one thing, whether it's the singer of a band or one band in general. System Of A Down is part of what I do, but it's just part of what I do. I don't define it, nor does it define me.\\"  <br /> <br />So, we have a man wanting to branch out- of course Daron sings more. Eventually he may be the lead singer.....but I understand people who are upset with this fact. Overall Mesmerize is as good as any System of a Down relase with simply more experimenting of sounds. The band does experiment more, but to say they have gone in a totally new direction is a fallacy. Lyrically lacking? Someone please listen to the lyrics of 'Bounce' on Toxicity and tell me that song had superb lyrics. \\"Up pogo pogo pogo, Down pogo pogo pogo\\". System has always had strange, sometimes simplistic lyrics. They usually stand for something and mesh with the vibe. That's just how they do it. <br /> <br />
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|NOT WORTH THE MONEY- DONT MAKE THESE FAKE POLITICIANS RICH- THEY ARE LAUGHING AT YOU- THEY SUCK- THEY CANT PLAY MUSIC FOR CRAP
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Ofcourse, this group is not for everyone(even though they are platinum artists).And most will again say that they are talentless people who ride on the coat-tales of others. These people are WRONG.....very wrong. The mix sounds great and the songs are all catchy and thought provoking(what else would you expect). Many different topics are covered and the vocal harmonies are to die for. There are a few limitations here and there thus resulting in a 4.5 star rating. In my opinion SOAD has yet to release a 5 star album. I wonder what Hypnotize will sound like?    That is right this album debuted at #1 on the Billboard.............selling 453,000 units.....thats right!
B0000CDLA7|1.0|THIS IS ONLY TO MAKE MONEY- AFTER READING THE REVIEWS BELOW- GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA DT- WHY?????? I FEEL USED
B000002BPS|4.0|Yep the last Great thing the offspring ever did.Had they continued to produce music like this i would have continued to buy it.Nope its not Punk as in the first 2 albums,Its just good rock music.It starts out with The humorous Disclaimer feat Jello Biafra (of dead kennedys and DOA if you arent familiar).Then breaks into The meaning life of life which is pretty much just saying stay the f#@k away and just let me do things my way.The album continues on this route with tracks touching on Getting hammered\\"mota\\",Cool to hate which is a sarcast look at those that hate everything in order to fit in,Way down the line which is a warning about as dexter puts it \\"Nothing changes cos uts all the saame ,the world you get the one you give away,It all just happens again,way down the line),The track dont pick it up is just stupid but hilarious and Change the world sounds like a shot at those that claim they are trying to change the world but are only in it for themselves.All in all The last great Album from this once well respected band.Americana had one or two decent tracks but as a whole it sucked.In my view the best they released the first 3 are well worth buying as well.
0684833395|4.0|My name is Kayleigh Gunnoud, and I am a senior at Mercy High School, CT.  Catch 22, by Joseph Heller is a novel which makes a strong statement about the effects of war.  While there are many novels which address this topic, this novel is unique in that it comedy and sarcasm.  These methods help show the overall madness and lunacy of war, and truly make the reader rethink their opinions on war. <br /> The main character in the novel is Captain Yossarian.  Yossarian's view on the war change after seeing the death of his friends and after Colonel Catchart's continuous raising of the number of missions the men need to fly.  Yossarian finds himself unable to leave because of a mysterious law, Catch 22.  Yossarian becomes an extremely defiant of the military authority. <br /> This novel reveals another side of war.  While people are very quick to think about the glory of war, Catch 22 introduces you to the many soldiers in the war and gradually shows you their demise and death.  After developing a relationship with these quirky characters throughout the novel, one fails to see any glory provided to them after their death. <br /> I would recommend Catch 22 to anyone.  The comedy in certain passages is literary genius.  It is a very dynamic novel, with many unique characters and scenes one will never forget. <br />
B000001IQH|4.0|Not many bands can hold there own in a scene(Especially one as unforgiving as the punk scene) after 10 years worth of albums and MTV airplay.But thankfully rancid have,They have been accused of selling out,softening up,Being Pop punk and everything inbetween and through it all they still Hold their heads high and do what they always did,which happened to be making Good \\"modern\\"Punk rock.This album was rancids break though album.Its 19 tracks of OI,Ska and hardcore tinged Punk rock it also managed to have Major labels and MTV wiping drool from their mouths,especially after Time bomb and Ruby Soho hit the airwaves.As the title suggests rancid knew the major labels would come running and they did.Thankfully they refused to be bought out.Almost anyone of these 19 tracks could have been a single all as catchy as the next and touching on various subjects  Etc,Exessive Drug use,racism,Homelessness.The one thing ive always respected about this band is everything they do is done with heart and this album is no different.Many bands touch on similiar subjects but have no sincerity at all.Rancid on the other hand tell a story in every track and they all come from the heart.Its certainly not rancids best(not in my view anyway),but it is the most accesible and if your new to rancid this would be the way to go.
B000069CWE|1.0|I can't believe that Linkin Park fans actually bought this. As if the original version of Hybrid Theory didn't suck enough. What we have here is the collection of crappy songs that was Hybrid Theory remixed. I thought LP was supposed to be a metal band (well, not a real metal band, but a wannabe metal band)! This is basically no different than your average, crappy, talent-free rap album (except most rap albums are better than this CD). All of the tracks that are heavy on the CD suck, too. Is Linkin Park a real rock band? No. And this CD further supports my opinion. Name one metal band (besides White Zombie and Rob Zombie) that have released a remix album. One GOOD metal band. It will take you a long time to think of one, but hopefully by then your taste in music will have gotten better. If you want some real heavy metal, give Dimmu Borgir or Tool a listen.    And if you don't believe me when I say that the most of LP's fan base is made up of kids ages twelve and under, look below. More than half of the positive reviews this CD received were written by kids.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I wasnt going to buy this cd at first, but I was told that it actually isnt bad. And it is an excellent cd! I absolutely love Trent Reznor's voice and I really like the industrial sound to the whole cd. Best track: Every Day Is Exactly The Same.  Good to listen to when it's raining!
B000006TRV|5.0|BUY THIS CD!!! One of my favorite CDs. This is a CD you should sell your soul to be able to listen to just once. Gilmours tasteful guitar licks, Waters great story about his father, his old friend Syd Barret, and every other brick in his \\"wall\\". Rick Wright is an amazing organist, and Nick Masons drums hold all the songs steady. By far my favorite pink floyd CD. If you heard some of this songs by themselves, they're good, but because it tells such a great story you need to buy the CD, or rent the movie which is also great but very wierd. GO out and buy this CD, Wish you were here, Dark side of the moon, and piper at the gates of dawn just so you can hear Syd Barrets only CD with Pink Floyd before he went insane. I also recommend \\"a saucerful of secrets:the pink floyd odyssey\\" so you have an idea what these people went through to get to where they are today.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|This isn't per-say a bad album, tracks such as BYOB and Old School Hollywood (I can see this being their next single) are as creative as they are melodic and heavy. On the other hand, it doesn't really offer anything not already presented by SOAD... it's more of the same. And really, this album isn't even worth comparing to their first two. All of this being said, this is still the best album rock has produced in a long time (though doesn't stand up to albums such as Sage Francis' \\"A Healthy Distrust\\")... and SOAD IS WITHOUT A DOUBT THE BEST BAND ROCK OUT THERE. Still i'll be honest, as much as I love SOAD, I can see those of us who already own their first three albums (and some imports) getting tired of Mezmerize very quickly.  If you've never boutght a SOAD album and are thinking of buying one, buy the first one- it'll blow you away... where as this latest release may not even blow you.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|You can only love or hate this album. There is no middle ground. <br /> <br /> I have listened to BYOB in a radio playlist online and it cought my attention. I was not sure if I like it or not but it was something different. I listened to the song again and it is one of the best songs I have listened in a long time. The rest of the album is very good but I think I listened to BYOB 10 times today. The video is nice too and you can find it on the web for free. If you don't like the video don't buy the album. <br /> <br /> You will probably not find anywere an album with so many influences and still so different. I think that the nicest touch is brough by the armenian folk music influences.
0385486804|4.0|I have enjoyed reading this book. Jon Krakauer, the author, uses many examples of metaphors and imagery. This book is good to read if you enjoy a story about adventure and troubles that are overcome. The most exciting parts of the book are toward the end so it was very easy to lose interest in the beginning of the book. <br />I didn't like the fact that the book is a biography, meaning it has a lot of detail. With the main character not telling the story, it is all based on journal entries and letters sent to and from him. This makes the story more confusing. <br />I chose the book because of the cover and title. It is a picture of a bus driven into a snow bank out in the middle of nowhere. The title caught my attention because it is Into The Wild, and I thought it would be a good adventure book, which it was. <br />I wouldn't suggest this book to young children because of some offensive language. Yet, to anyone who can handle it, I would encourage you to read it.  <br />
B0001MDP3G|2.0|I thought Anthony Minghella did a wonderful job with The English Patient (he deserved the Academy Award even though I would have liked Fargo to have won best picture). Anyway, his direction was good in the beginning but other elements really brought the film down by the end. Well the score was great. The costumes were good. Jude Law deserved his Oscar nom. Renee Zellweger was a little over the top, but she did deserve recognition for making the film partially enjoyable when she stole some scenes. However, Nicole Kidman was such a miscast. I thought if any actor can go from a great comedy/musical/tragedy role like Satine in \\"Moulin Rouge!\\" then go to a great interpretation of a literary figure like the one she did Virginia Woolf in \\"The Hours\\", then this should have been a breeze. Unfortunately, she was not credible in this role at all! I read the book beforehand (it's beautiful and merits its huge popularity among readers) but the movie did slip on the importance of Ada being a kind of an \\"odd girl out\\" trying to fit into two types of society in the Civil War South and ultimately failing until she meets Ruby. A previous reviewer said Natalie Portman should have been in the lead role. I think she really could have pulled it off just from watching her short presence in the film. Nicole would not have been a problem if she weren't in half the movie looking like a perfect Southern Belle the whole time. Moreover, was there supposed to be a love story? It was not there. I was mostly disappointed in Nicole. Had the casting in that aspect been better the whole film would have been, at least for me, more enjoyable.
B000957O82|4.0|Will Smith has done it again. It is amazing how this guy can pull off any role, even in a non-action one like the one in \\"Hitch.\\" <br /> <br />Hitch is a funny and watchable movie. <br /> <br />Smith is a \\"date doctor\\" who helps people sort out their romantic problems and he has his formula pat down successfully. But, you know that a formula can have a successful run only for a certain period of time and then it is bound to hit a bump. In this case, Smith's succesful dating formula starts to unravel when his client's successful love life becomes the talk of the town. His client Kevin James,, who plays a bumbling tax consultant is in love with a widowed heiress, and somehow it leaks out that James's success is the handiwork of a \\"date doctor.\\" And the person who is responsible for getting Smith's life out of control is Eva Mendes, who plays a society gossip columnist.  <br /> <br />Eva Mendes and Kevin James did a fantastic job in their respective roles. I really liked James in this movie, and his dance moves are a definite highlight of this movie. <br /> <br />It is a great film to catch on a girls night out. My husband would definitely label this as a chick flick.
B000026C3T|5.0|Led zeppelin is one of the best bands that ever lived. If you want to spend the money, I recommend you go out and buy every single led zeppelin album that was ever made. But since most of you don't want to spend all that money, I recommend buying this CD. It has all the best songs, like dazed and confused, stairway to heaven, and kashmir. I recommend this for any person who ever liked any kind of music at all.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Then...what a shock! <br />It's tha same g-d aweful movie! <br />Same cliched characters, same basic plot, same dazzle special effects, just a different plot device! <br />Geeez...it's as bad as the Airport/Towering Inferno et al. crap of the 70s. <br />Fun visuals...though a subtitle should be \\"Physics, Shmysics!\\" <br /> <br />
B0007Y08IS|3.0|Christ. Am I getting old or just not falling for the same old d*ck and fart jokes...I bought 2 DVD's yesterday. Both on the opening street date 5/18/05...one was the 'Seinfeld' Season 4 boxset and the other was 'Team America'. First off, I'd like to say I love and I do mean this, \\"LOVE\\" Matt Stone and Trey Parker's collective sense of humor...if I were a chick, I'd probably try to have sex with or befriend one or the both of them just so I could stick around and laugh my ass off all the time. There's no doubting that both Matt and Trey are extremely talented, and I do mean \\"EXTREMELY\\" talented, (I would have never guessed South Park would have lasted this long and they seem to have an inexhaustible supply of new and original ideas to keep the show fresh.).    However, this movie...'Team America: World Police' is not all that funny. There were some funny moments in it, but for the most part I just sat through it \\"waiting\\"...\\"For what?!?\\", you might ask...well, for me not to think that what I was watching was not a piece of crap. Unfortunately, this thought never crossed my mind and ultimately I was left feeling...nothing.    Sure, this movie is vulgar...and sure, that vulgarity is meant to be really funny...but it's not. For example, the \\"Unrated\\" sex scene...I 'image' search the internet all day long some times looking for photos I can use in my Photoshop cartoon Skipper Clipper, which can be found at 'The Holy Temple of Shue' website via a link on the opening page. It's listed under most search engines so try and find it if you want to read and see what I'm talking about, but I digress...the sex scene...this should have been funny to me, but I've seen so many photos and videos of real people cr*pping and peeing all over each other that, to see puppets do it, well, it's not really that big of a deal. I can see where someone who's never seen these type of things might think it's funny, just because they've never been exposed to it and think it's a very bizarre behaviour not really practiced by anyone except perverts and sick-minded people...which, I guess for the most part, is true, but it's also a very \\"real\\" subgenre of traditional sex...much like the fetishes of people who like to masturbate to videos of chicks getting kidnapped in the woods, raped, and then put through a wood chipper or skewered on a log and roasted like a pig. This too, is a very \\"real\\" subgenre (...) to traditional sex, and although it's very bizarre behaviour, it's hardly funny, even for puppets.    I was soo disappointed at this movie...and I really, really was waiting for a long time for it to come out on video so I could see it. Anyway, it has nothing to do with the production values, all of the puppets and the world they inhabit are very believable down to the tinest of details, but my irritation did not come from the production value...it's in the humor.    One thing I've learned from listening to drunken idiot rednecks coming out of Wal-mart at 1 o'clock in the morning and shouting obscenities in the parking lot and that's, putting c*ck or balls or (...) in front of words or each other is not enough to be funny. It's repetitive and annoying, and coming from drunken rednecks or angry hispanic welfare moms it's close to unforgivable ignorance. Anyway, that's what this movie is...98 minutes (give or take) of crude sexual humor and foul language which makes no sense.     The actual story is okay and gets it's point across (i.e.-America's military will destroy any historical landmarks or mass quantities of other humans in the name of Freedom in order to achieve an objective whether it be a handful of terrorists or an oppressive leader who cannot be controlled by the U.S.).  I already knew this, so this and all of the other political view points (such as the political activist actor's guild F.A.G.) are old to me which leaves only the humor to carry the movie, which isn't all that funny considering that the ninth season of South Park is the most hilariousyet.     Anyway, I understood the movie, I understood the humor, I just didn't like either and I will be getting rid of my DVD tomorrow, however, I am keeping the 'Seinfeld' 4th season boxset. I've got nothing but good things to say about it. It's hilarious.    Matt. Trey. Stop trying to make me laugh and make me laugh! Damnit.
B00005ATQ9|5.0|The whole film is a work of art. Clichd as that sounds, Kubrick (known for his perfectionism) really accomplished a cinematic feat in visually transferring works of art to film. Scenes throughout the film really echo 18th century paintings. The cinematography is some of the most beautiful ever done. New lenses were created for this film so that it could be used to film in candlelight. Kubrick really pushed the costume-drama forward. I have noticed for most of his films from the 60's and 70's, he really pushed the standard for any genre he took on. Just look at Dr. Strangelove, or 2001: Space Odyssey. I will conclude by just saying the obvious, this is a visual masterpiece.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Well, it's been a long time coming for a new System Of A Down album. A long time. It's been almost four years since we were graced by the mega-successful sophmore album, \\"Toxicity,\\" and if you discount the outtakes/b-sides collection that followed in 2002, \\"Steal This Album,\\" this is the first smattering of new System Of A Down material since then. To put things in perspective, \\"Toxicity\\" was released a week before September 11th. Now think about all of the things that have happened since then. Wow, how I have missed this group.<br /><br />Those expecting things in System Of A Down's music to change will be sorely disappointed. Aside from increasing air-time from guitarist/co-producer/back-up vocalist Daron Malakian, not much has changed. Instead, the band's sound seems revitalized and all eleven songs are up to standard. And if you thought they would shut up after Bush was re-elected, that's your mistake. The lyrics on this album are just as, and maybe even more, political than ever before. Songs like \\"Sad Statue\\" and \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" carry their anti-war message very bravely and very clearly. \\"Sad Statue\\" is easily the emotional apex of the album, with the poignant and memorable line: \\"We'll all go down in history/With a sad Statue Of Liberty/And a generation that didn't agree.\\" Likewise, the first single \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" (Bring Your Own Bombs) throws just as many barbs at our government, with a rather catchy pop-chorus to go along with. Perhaps that line (\\"Everybody going to the party/Have a real good time\\") is an ironic take on the bloated tens of millions of dollars spent on the rather lavish and tasteless inauguration party of George W. Bush that took place just weeks after the Tsunami disaster? I don't know, maybe I'm just reading in a bit too far. Anyways, if all the political mumbo-jumbo makes your head hurt, or if you actually support our (p)resident, than you can still enjoy this album. Afterall, the two previous tracks are the only ones that tackle politics head on. Take, for example, \\"Old School Hollywood,\\" which tells the tale of Malakian's bizarre appearance at an all-star baseball game with random, slightly obscure/washed-up celebrities like Tony Danza and David Arquette. \\"Cigaro\\" and \\"Violent Pornography\\" are two other slightly slanted tracks, alongside more traditional System tunes like \\"Question!\\" and \\"Revenga.\\"<br /><br />Front to back, it's almost flawless. Almost. Like mentioned before, Malakian gets more vocal time, which means, unfortunately, frontman Serj Tankian is pushed into the background, or sometimes completely out of the picture! What's up with that? I don't have anything against Malakian, but a big part of who System Of A Down are is credited to Serj's unique vocal stylings and often poetic lyrics. That's the only angle this album suffers, but hopefully the follow-up, \\"Hypnotize,\\" (due this fall) will rectify that problem. For as good as \\"Mezmerize\\" is, I feel a much bigger and grander album is on the way. This seems like just a small taste of what these boys have coming for us.n.

Who, you may ask, is Dan Bowes? <br />Why, he's just about the greatest lead vocalist you've never heard. But, I promise you, if you listen to even ONE Thunder  <br />album , you will agree with me. This guy has a voice that cuts 'em all. And, Thunder is one hell of a good band. This, thier debut album, is very, very impressive. \\"She's so fine\\", Dirty Love, Until my dying day\\", go ahead, pick one, you'll love them all. Eleven great songs performed with a great deal of enthusiasm and skill by a great band with a singer you will not believe. Go ahead, buy a Thunder album. Take it home and tell me I'm wrong. Thunder...Dan Bowes. Great, great stuff. <br />
B000025802|1.0|Rafael Kubelik was a great conductor, whom I have alot of respect for.  However, I just could not sink my teeth into these performances.  I found them to be brash and over the top.  They were played way too heavily for Dvorak.  It was as if they thought they were playing Brahms.  Now, I know Dvorak was a great admirer of Brahms, and that he definitely can be considered a Brahmsian, but the the music of these two men is very different.  I prefer a lighter, more rustic approach to these works, like one finds in the Istvan Kertesz set on London.  This is certainly the set to stick with for these symphonies.  I have long since sold my Kubelik recording, because it just didn't do it for me... the Kertesz recording is a keeper.
0800141660|5.0|If I can ever get myself to sit through the entire A&E presentation of Pride and Prejudice, it could affect this statement. However, as it stands, Emma Thompson deserved her distinction as being not only a gifted actor but also an award winning screenwriter. I wish there were more people in Hollywood like her! Ang Lee is probably one of the most talented directors today. He reminds me of Stanley Kubrick in the fact that he likes to tackle different genres of film. Lee went from a contemporary Asian family-drama (Eat Drink Man Woman) to a Jane Austen period piece (Sense & Sensibility) and pulled it off. It is a shame that he does not have one Academy Award for his directorial efforts because he is more talented than some winning directors are. The acting is wonderful, with Kate Winslet really giving a passionate performance. Emma Thompson played Elinor well (despite the age of the character being much younger). To me she displayed wonderfully Elinor's sensibleness and self-control, until a very uplifting scene at the end. I really enjoyed this film and recommend it.
B0007Y08IS|3.0|I haven't seen the movie yet, although I look forward to it.    [...]How can someone decimate (reduce by one tenth) half of something?  An editor should know what the words he or she uses mean.  Destroy, demolish, yes.  Decimate, no.    This seems like one of the things Matt and Trey would make fun of.  Blatant misuse of a word.    Thanks for letting me vent.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Somebody mentioned to me that there was this great music DVD from the 80's about to be released. At first I was a little skeptical....you see I love 80's music and the thought of seeing all these bands live...well.... <br /> <br />I bought it, and sat down in a comfy chair with a cup of tea...sure in the knowledge id just helped out some hungry people....and then it happened....my head got blown off by a visual/sonic onslaught that did not waine for over 10 hours. I was hooked. Not only is the video --> DVD tranfer superb....but the sound quality is amazing. It captures the atmospher to a 'T'. For me (someone who's into modern electronic music making with synthesizers)...I was just over joyed by the sight and sound of seeing classic synths on stage. If any of you are an analog or digital synth geek like me....then this DVD is as sacred as the Bible itself. You can clearly see the keyboardists of various bands playing with (including amazing close up footage):  <br /> <br />Roland Jupiter 8's <br />Jupiter 6's  <br />Prophet 5's  <br />Pro-One's <br />MemoryMoog's <br />Oberheim OB8's and OBXa's  <br />DX7's and a DX1 (OMG!!!) <br />Emulator II's  <br />PPG Wave 2.2's <br />TR808's (drum machine) <br /> <br />The list goes on and on..... <br /> <br />Now, if you anything like me....your in for a real treat. Nick Rhodes from Duran Duran on his Jupiter 8. David Bowie and that amazing DX7 lead sound. Madonna and the DX7 overkill!! Ultravox and the amazing Emulator II and TR808 sound. Wow....I dont want to spoil it for you guys....but this DVD is compulsory viewing. <br /> <br />*Oh and just as a side note....one little observation Ive made. You know....back in the 80's there was alot of decent pop/rock music (can anyone say the same for todays?). All of the 80's artists were alot older....kinda in their late 20's and early 30's. Nowadays we have teenage brats with little talent filling the charts. Hmmmm....I smell a correlation here! <br /> <br />Hope you like my review.... <br />
B0000CABBW|5.0|Maori mythology comes to life in the form of Pai, granddaughter of the tribal chief. Tradition demands the next chief be a grandson, but Pai's twin brother and Mother died during childbirth. Left to live with her Grandparents Pai tries to prove her worthiness to her Grandfather but he insists his successor must be a male.<br /><br />The Maori claim to be descendants of the legendary Paikea who came to New Zealand riding on the back of a whale. This coastal, fishing community has maintained their close spiritual tie with whales for over a thousand years, their mutual destinies forever linked.<br /><br />When Koro (Pai's grandfather) decides to gather together all the young males of the tribe and teach them the \\"old ways\\" in the hopes of finding the next chief Pai tries to join the group but, is rudely dismissed by Koro. In desperation she cries out to the whales, asking for their assistance in her quest for acceptance.<br /><br />Now it is up to the whales to decide who's to be the \\"chosen one.\\" A massive herd answers her plea by grounding themselves on the beach. The whole community unite in an attempt to save these sacred giants, seeing their impending deaths as an apocalyptic omen for the Maori people. All their efforts fail and hope is lost until Pai realizes the moment of truth has finally arrived.<br /><br />What a beautiful, poetic movie. Keisha Castle-Hughes is brilliant as Pai as is the whole cast. It might be a little slow for younger children, but overall a wonderful experience for a family to watch together. Buy this DVD, you'll come away with something new with each viewing.
B000000OAA|5.0|I feel that Queen's Sheer Heart Attack is definitely their best album. It flows well and covers all grounds musically. It rocks. Although I do think it is possible that this album is more appealing to people with certain tastes due to some odder songs on the album. Songs: <br />Brighton Rock: My favorite Queen song. Starts with some cool carnival music and a guy in the background is whistling the same song that was being sung at the end of Seven Seas of Rhye on Queen II. Some thrashy guitar comes in and then Freddie Mercury too. He sounds like a girl but it just works on this one. There is a cool middle section that explores some metal styles and the song ends with another killer riff. <br /> <br />Killer Queen: They slow down for moment here with this classic. Some of Queen's best harmonies can be heard on this track (in my opinion). <br /> <br />Tenement Funster: This is a kind of mellow rock song sung by Roger Taylor. It's probably one of my favorites. I feel that because of the odd way that he constructs his songs, they are hard to get into. Once you do they are all great though and this one is kind of catchy. <br /> <br />Flick of the Wrist: The lyrics seem kind of violent here which is kind of weird. Great guitar by Brian <br />. <br />Lily Of The Valley: A nice ballad that is kind of insignificant because it is short. Ends this little medley. <br /> <br />Now I'm Here: My second favorite Queen song (the fact that they are on the same album is a coincidence). Interesting lyrics and a rocking tune. <br /> <br />In The Lap of the Gods: I honestly just listen to this track to hear Roger Taylor's background vocals. They are amazingly high. <br /> <br />Stone Cold Crazy: A little metal rush after In the Lap of the Gods. Great guitar work kinda weird lyrics. <br /> <br />Dear Friends: Another insignificant ballad. Not much to say here. <br /> <br />Misfire: This song has some really cool guitar stuff. The song is just incredibly catchy. Too short! <br /> <br />BringBack That Leroy Brown: This is a fun little ragtime bit that you have to be in the mood for. I think Queen's vocal harmonies actually help this song come alive. They just fit really well. <br /> <br />She Makes Me: This is a soothing track, but its too repetitive. I like the ending. <br /> <br />In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited: A different song from In the Lap of the Gods, but very similar. Starts out soft, has a little edge to it, and is consumed mostly by the chorus repeating over and over to the end. Very catch chorus, you'll wanna sing along. <br /> <br />I think this album can appeal to people of various musical interests and help them get into Queen. I think the album is spectacular.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|The american metal scene was down  during the ninetees. The big record companies wanted to \\"castrate\\" metal music from its row power by promoting the  so called alternative rock. Even the awards started to mix metal and alternative. As a result, all bands sounded the same -dull and uninspired. Good for the Family Values groups, bad for the music. SOAD, a new group in the 90s,  didn't sell to the big record labels asking them to stop shouting or to turn the volume down. Hats off to American  who signed them in! They turned out to be the best american band of the last decade! Their style is unique and innovative, they are heavy and melodic at the same time. They can mix all possible styles of music into a stunning metal song. They have just delivered their fourth consecutive mastepiece Mezmerize. In a way it's even better than its predecessors. They have grown musically and soundwise. Daron Malakian is a true genius and shows he's agood singer too. From the politically sharp BYOB (there are at least 4 songs in it in just about 4 minutes) to the techno -influenced fun song Old School Hollywood or the sarcastic Cigaro, they go from serious to grotesque in a blink of an eye.   Question is a beautiful song starting  with a   flamenco  rhythm and beautiful vocals  growing harder   as a metal ballad. There is  even some polka on Radio/Video.  Violent Pornography is another  incredible song  constantly changing with a clasical hard rock  chorus.  There is not a single weak song on the album. It's only 36 minutes but it is so intense and rich! It's worth every penny!
0441172717|5.0|i've read the negative reviews and could not believe my eyes! some people compared this series to the LOTR! first LOTR is not SCIENCE FICTION you idiots! it's FANTASY at it's best!!second i hate people who write a review without even reading the whole book! i've read all six of the original dune novels and the ones frank herbert's son wrote and i think all 11 books are great, especially the original novels..this series is not for novice sci-fi readers! so if you are new to this genre stay away from these books or if you don't like them keep your thoughts for yourself!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|this cd is the best new cd that is put out by an artist that has been out for a while. System of a Down has been true to their music and has not changed for stupid trends in the music industry. the only thing that I found weird is that daron sings a lot on the new cd but that dosnt make it bad. This cd a great and everybody that likes system of a down or just heard one song should go to their local music store and buy it.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Metal addict that I am, I rarely listen to anything non-metal. However, I happen to still have a rather large soft spot for System of a Down, so I picked this album up the day it came out. <br /> <br />Needless to say, I was most impressed. On Mezmerize, we see an older, more mature System of a Down that has stepped up the musicianship without losing any of the insanity. In fact, in terms of all-out craziness, this album is more reminiscent of their debut than the streamlined Toxicity.  <br /> <br />And there's another thing...this album actually borders on metal. System of a Down (just like all the other nu-\\"metal\\" bands) often get misclassified as metal (they're actually just hard rock), but on Mezmerize, even I have to admit there are some undeniable metal tendencies. In fact, if they used more riffs like the one at the beginning of \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" and maybe tossed in a few more guitar solos, I'd be forced to call them bona-fied metal. <br /> <br />Now, on to the music... <br /> <br />1. Soldier Side (Intro) - 1:03 - Just an intro, so I'm not going to give it a rating, but it's a good intro. All acoustic guitars and softly delivered vocals from both Serj and Daron. Daron actually sings quite a bit throughout the album, often trading off leads with Serj. Heh, there's something about how they sing \\"welcome\\" at the beginning that always makes me expect them to follow it with \\"to the machine.\\"  <br /> <br />2. B.Y.O.B. - 4:15 - You've all probably heard this one on the radio by now, so no surprises here. Daron's in peak form on the guitar, producing some frantic riffs that fall somewhere between thrash and punk. A very good song, though a bit repetitive. I give it 9/10.  <br /> <br />3. Revenga - 3:48 - Starts out mellow, but then Daron cuts in with some triplets reminiscent of Iced Earth, continuing the thrashy feel of B.Y.O.B. Serj is just as crazy as ever on the shouted vocals during the verses, but showcases his immense singing ability during the chorus. Daron also plays something like a solo at one point, but I wouldn't exactly call it a full-fledged guitar solo. This one's an 8/10.  <br /> <br />4. Cigaro - 2:11 - Another one most of us have heard before, since the mp3 was posted on Systemofadownonline.com well before the album came out. It's short and catchy, but has some good guitarwork and distinctly punk-style drumming. And the intro features one of Serj's deep roars...something that was missing from Steal This Album. Oh, and the opening line of \\"My c**k is much bigger than yours\\" is just the greatest. 8/10 for this one.  <br /> <br />5. Radio/Video - 4:09 - Whoa...this is almost reggae in places! It's a damn fine song, though, as we get to hear Shavo's bass-playing a bit more clearly than on most tracks. And Daron definitely plays a solo here, although it's clean (no distortion). There's a lot of tempo changes on this track, which makes it very interesting to listen to. The double bass from Jon at the ending is a very nice touch. Yet another rating of 8/10  <br /> <br />6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm on this Song - 2:08 - Yeah, you read that right. This crazy piece of work reminds me very strongly of \\"F**k the System\\" off Steal This Album, but it has much more musical depth. The lyrics are some of the album's most bizarre, but it's System of a Down-what do you expect? It's a good headbanger and I enjoy it quite a bit. 9/10 for this one.  <br /> <br />7. Violent Pornography - 3:31 - Now this is some good music! Definitely one of Serj's wackiest performances...the verses almost make \\"Storaged\\" (from the Sugar EP) seem like a slow waltz. And then the chorus comes along, slower, more melodic. Like many of the tracks on here, this song jumps around like a prog song played a 4x. Jon and Serj are the ones who really shine here, but Daron and Shavo get the job done. Maybe my favorite track on the album, it earns a 10/10.  <br /> <br />8. Question! - 3:20 - This one reminds me of \\"Aerials.\\" It's probably going to be a single eventually, as it's less wild and catchy as all hell. But that doesn't mean there's no substance to it; it's a heartfelt performance by everybody. Another one of my favorites. 10/10.  <br /> <br />9. Sad Statue - 3:25 - Another great track, featuring some more brilliant work from Daron. There are some more ridiculous lyrics, but again, what else would we expect from these guys? At one point, it almost sounds like Daron's going to break into a solo, but he never does. Despite that, this track still gets a 9/10.  <br /> <br />10. Old School Hollywood - 2:56 - This is only real throw-away track on here. It's kind of a generic nu-metal piece with more electronic noises than I've ever heard on any song by System of a Down. It has a semi-cool riff and some catchy vocal lines, but that's pretty much all it is. Still, I don't dislike it enough to skip it when listening to the CD, so I'll give it a 5/10.  <br /> <br />11. Lost in Hollywood - 5:02 - The album closes with a ballad in the vein of \\"Roulette,\\" but slower and better. Daron does almost all the vocals on this track and does a good job of it, too. He has a strange-sounding voice, but it's strange in a good way. I like this song a lot, so 9/10 for the closer.  <br /> <br />Overall, that averages to a 8.5/10 for the album, which is pretty respectable, especially when you consider that there's only one track on there that's less than an 8/10. If you leave out \\"Old School Hollywood,\\" the average comes to 8.9/10, which is not too shabby at all. That's worth a 4.5 on Amazon's scale, but they don't let us give partial points, so I rounded it down since a 5 implies perfection...and Behemoth's \\"Demigod\\" is the only album I can think of that deserves that rating. <br /> <br />Bottom line: Mezmerize is awesome. Get it. You won't be disappointed. Like I said in another thread, it's the System of a Down we all know and love...only more so.
B000068R1X|1.0|This version is rubbish! It's been remixed and has completely lost it's edge. No wonder it's always real cheap... because no one will buy it.

0380002930|5.0|Rabbits' lives are full of plants.  Their homes, their food, their hotels, their restaurants, their grocery stores, their beauty in the world are the trees, shrubs, grasses, clovers and flowers.  Rabbits live out in the wild, in a place where many modern humans take one glance and see \\"nothing\\" because there are no people, buildings or other man-made conveniences that they cannot live without.  Rabbits can and do live without them because they have plants.  People who blindly lump all plants together in their minds as \\"extraneous green things of little or no importance in our very important human world\\" may have difficulty understanding the importance of plants in Watership Down, and indeed the importance of plants to life itself by virtue of their fundamental place in the food chain as the primary producers on earth.  Richard Adams knows and values plants, and describes them beautifully and individually, quite possibly in an effort to cure this plant blindness in much of modern society.    <br /> <br />Watership Down was published in 1972 at a time when the terrible conflict in Southeast Asia was far from resolved and the Cold War was still raging in the wake of the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.  Look for echoes of these world events in the gassing of the burrows of the Sandleford Warren, and the eyeball-to-eyeball show down between General Woundwort and Bigwig on the last page of chapter 38 in which Bigwig doesn't blink, but stands his ground (and proves victorious in the end).  In today's American culture, if we think of gas in connection with war, we immediately think of Hitler, but I propose that the gassing of the Sandleford Warren is a better allegorical match with the Cu Chi or Ben Binh tunnels of Vietnam.  The whole Southeast Asia War was a terrible secret that Americans in general, still to this day don't or won't talk about - like the terrible unspoken secret at Cowslip's warren of the snares.   <br />   <br />The last few paragraphs of the Epilogue do record Hazel's death.  For those of you unable to grasp the meaning there, I am happy to translate.  Paragraph one:  \\". . . wild rabbits [only] live for two or three years.\\"  and \\"Hazel lived longer than that.  He lived a tidy few summers.\\"  So, we know from paragraph one that Hazel lived to be a very old rabbit.  Paragraph four begins recounting the death of Hazel.  It happened in the spring, in March when Hazel was so old that he couldn't smell well or run well anymore and so had to spend most of his time as an old invalid, napping in his burrow.  Hazel awoke from a dream, and the angel rabbit El-ahrairah was beside him.  Hazel was able to recognize El-ahrairah, from his shining silver ears.  The rabbit god, Lord Frith had given El-ahrairah those special ears after he lost them to the Black Rabbit of Inl at the end of chapter 31.  In the next-to-the-last paragraph in chapter 31, Lord Frith said to El-ahrairah, \\"I have brought a few [gifts] for you.  A pair of ears, a tail and some whiskers.  You may find the ears slightly strange at first.  I put a little starlight in them\\".  We also know that it was an angel rabbit with Hazel because the visitor was able to invisibly pass the sentry keeping watch at Hazel's door.  The angel rabbit El-ahrairah was there to relieve Hazel of the tiredness of old age. He said in paragraph seven of the Epilogue, \\"You've been feeling tired, but I can do something about that.\\"  In an earlier chapter we learned that rabbits always go out of the warren burrows and wander off to die alone, away from the other rabbits.  Again we are reminded of this fact in chapter 46 when General Woundwort's rabbit Thunder finds Fiver cold and comatose on the floor of the Honeycomb, apparently dead.  General Woundwort asks, \\"What do you make of it . . ?  Rabbits don't die underground.\\"  The angel rabbit El-ahrairah explained to Hazel in paragraph seven, that he could join the angel Owsla [in rabbit heaven], and he would take him there now if Hazel was ready [to die].  So in paragraph eight, Hazel went out with the angel rabbit, that no other rabbit could see, and since \\"[Hazel] would not be needing his body any more, so he left [his dead body] lying on the edge of the ditch\\".  Once Hazel had died and left his old, decrepit, slow body behind, he was able (in the final paragraph) to easily follow the angel rabbit El-ahrairah, running and leaping off to rabbit heaven in the woods with the spring primroses, where Hazel would be able to watch thousands of rabbits prosper down through the generations in the warren that he had founded.   Richard Adams chose not to use the words \\"angel\\", \\"heaven\\", \\"death\\", \\"dead\\", or \\"die\\".  He knew how sad Hazel's death would be for his readers, especially young readers who often are not ready to face death or accept it.  Angels and heaven are human concepts, and rabbits aren't human after all, even though, like us, they do die.  Richard Adams penned Hazel's death in such a way that each reader is free to experience their own personal feelings and beliefs about death, and either face it or not.  The fact that many reviews here have chosen to deny Hazel's death is testament to Adams' skill as a writer. (And in some cases quite possible that some readers view an epilogue as extraneous, unnecessary extra reading gladly skipped.) If young readers grow in life and maturity, and come back to re-read Watership Down, they may then have a new viewpoint and thus find more meaning in Adams' words. <br />
0316666343|2.0|Intriguing plot but not particularly original. The voice may sound authentic in the beginning. But as the mystery unfolds, it's obviously that the writer was camouflaging her lack of style and transition in the narrative of a teenager.
B000929AJQ|1.0|Another six years, another NIN album. Why, it seems like it was just last decade that the overbearing-but-pure-bloody-genius double-disc epic The Fragile was unleashed on us... oh wait, it was just last decade. <br /> <br />Folks and folkettes, here we have a diligent new album from the ever-busy (yeah right) Trent Reznor. Unfortunately, it doesn't do anything that The Downward Spiral didn't do. <br /> <br />The problem with a CD such as the Fragile, is that Trent was moving in a more experimental ambient soundscape/angry mainstream industrial hybrid direction, but leaning more to the left. Continuing on that path would have lost him all mainstream acceptance. Lemme put it this way. Have you ever heard of Danny Schuler? No? Case closed. <br /> <br />Anyway, this is essentially a mix of the worst elements of Pretty Hate Machine and The Downward Spiral. Unispired pap such as 'All the Love in the World,' which showcases lyrical degeneration (to the MAX) and a lack of new ideas. It's mellower, that's about it. <br /> <br />Next up, we have 'You Know What You Are?' Hey Trent, why didn't you call this song by it's other title, you know 'Somewhat Damaged?' Or 'Wish?' Or any one of thirty or so songs that he's written that all sound EXACTLY LIKE THIS ONE? Is it a part of your contract that you have to rewrite Wish once per album, or something? You know the drill, constant drumbeat, industrial-fuzzed riff, screaming from Trent... you've heard this already. <br /> <br />The Collector, huh? I am the Collector. I have a net. It picks things up. Feelings for me to feed off of. <br /> <br />That's all that's really needed to say.  <br /> <br />The Hand that Feeds, the big single. Well, it ain't that bad. Got a sexy dance beat probably formerly used by Static-X, and more lame lyrics, but it isn't too bad. I like the riff. <br /> <br />Love is Not Enough sounds like a Downward Spiral C-side. 'Nuff said. <br /> <br />Every Day Is Exactly The Same? He repeats the chorus too many times, he doesn't do anything new, he bores the everloving hell out of me... yeah, usual for {With_Teeth} <br /> <br />With Teeth has none. <br /> <br />Only is, unfortunately, NOT the 'only' good song on the album, thus removing my opportunity for a delicious pun. Damn you, Reznor, for not making this song good. <br /> <br />The rest? Same. All the songs sound the same, act the same, and are the same crap. <br /> <br />Don't bother. Buy the Downward Spiral reissue instead. <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br />Nile.
0671027344|5.0|Every page in this book kept my attention whether I was hoping for the best in the next turn of the page or was wondering what bad incident was around the corner.  This book is one that many mature teenagers could relate to in some way.  The main character, Charlie, went through and over many obstacles that teens face nearly everyday which makes it so realistic versus idealistic. <br /> <br />The reasoning why this is a book for mature teenagers is that it is so very realistic.  Stephen Chbosky did not censor any of the language used like so many other books often hide.  If you are offended easily by drug or party-like situations, this book might not be for you. <br /> <br />This book is in an interesting format, other than just the story, which also makes the book so great.  Charlie writes to an \\"anonymous friend\\" in a diary-like form throughout his freshman year at high school where deals with relationships, teachers, drugs, parties, family issues and the list goes on and on which makes it so easy to relate to somehow.  If you are not one that is offended very much and does not mind the reality of this book, this would be an excellent choice for you!
B00004Y6Q5|5.0|I bought the soundtrack right after seeing the movie and years later, listening to it still makes my heart thump the way it did the first time I heard \\"Le Sacre du Printemps\\" when the strings suddenly start coming in nonstop assault (my musical terminology is not the best, but people who know that work will hopefully know the part I mean). I have never been affected so much by a soundtrack, and it's not entirely a pleasant experience, but it's an unforgettable one. See the movie first.<br /><br />I have read complaints here about the shortness of some of the pieces, but they all hang together, and to be honest, I don't<br /><br />know if I could take them any longer.<br /><br />This is the aural equivalent of something you just can't look away from, as frightening as it is. The Kronos Quartet does an excellent job. The orchestration is amazing.<br /><br />Does anyone else here the hissed \\"happy tappy\\" in a couple of the pieces? Brrrrrrrrr.
B000059R8Y|5.0|I love E.C. and I have a lot of his music.this disk has the feel of a mix between the classic E.C. style and the newer direction he has been going. a disk dedicated to his family it really shows his wide range of talent I have many of his cd's and this is another that I play all the time. I put this in and let it play from start to end, but I do that with most E.C disks so it fits in well. I say listen to the shorts and give it a try I think it's a well rounded album and reccommend it highly.
B000002HMH|5.0|Delivered five years after their eponymous \\"black\\" album in 1991, Load captures Metallica settling into an uneasy period of maturation. Under the guidance of producer Bob Rock, Metallica have streamlined their sound, cutting away most of the twisting, unpredictable time signatures and the mind-numbingly fast riffs. What's left is polished - and disappointingly straightforward - heavy metal. Metallica's attempts at expanding their sonic palette have made them seem more conventional than they ever have before. They add in Southern boogie rock, country-rock, and power ballads to their bag of tricks, which make them sound like '70s arena rock holdovers. Metallica's idea of opening up their sound is to concentrate on relentless mid-tempo boogie - over half the album is dedicated to songs that are meant to groove, but they simply don't swing. Metallica sound tight, but with the material they've written, they should sound loose. That becomes apparent as the songs drag out over the album's nearly 80-minute running time - there are only so many times that a band can work the same tempo exactly the same way before it becomes tedious. It isn't surprising to hear Metallica get stodgier and more conservative as they get older, but it is nonetheless depressing.  <br />
1881273989|4.0|Readers of this book, you will have an unfair advantage. <br /> But we all know what they say; all is fair in love and war. <br /> If so, this book is a nuke with a big bang.  I have read 3 of his books and this one drove the nail home. <br />At first it was hard to understand what makes me feel loved is not what makes others feel loved.  I thought love was the same for everyone, boy was I wrong. <br /> If you are looking to connect with someone new, this will definitely help you. <br /> If you want to improve a situation at work, school, or at home, here is your answer. <br /> If you want to understand your parents and some of the things they have said to you, again here is your answer.  <br />I was surprised at my test results in the back of this book.  When I looked at the results I found out why my mom and I were so far apart for so many years, and why she said some of the things she said that bugged me so much.  Her love language was the lowest on my list. <br /> Why my Dad had such a profound effect on me was that he spoke my love languages fluently. <br />  What drove me into bad environments when I was troubled, why I drove around in my car going nowhere; it was because I was just trying to return to a place I felt loved.  Knowing this has definitely saved me on gas. <br />I figured out why so many of my past relationships were so shallow and others were so wonderful and special.  <br />The best thing of all is, I know what my love language is now and how to let others know what it is.  This makes me happier in all of my relationships.   <br />It is all about making life better, you can express to others what makes you feel better, help others in your life to figure out what their love language is, or figure out their love language on your own. <br /> It takes so little effort to make someone feel good. <br /> So why not? <br />
0395389496|5.0|In this wonderfully enchanting book by Chris Van Allsburg, a young boy learns that the true meaning of Christmas isn't in the number of presents he receives, but much, much more.  The story opens as a young boy lays in bed late on Christmas Eve.  Suddenly, he is startled by a loud noise outside his window.  Leaping out of bed, he is amazed to find a large steam locomotive train sitting in the street outside.<br /><br />Bewildered, he heads outside, where he is greeted by the conductor.  Soon, the train is headed on its way toward the North Pole.  The journey carries the children over long bridges, up huge mountains, and over slippery areas of sheer ice.  Eventually, the train arrives safely at the North Pole just before Santa sets off on his yearly journey.  The children are notified that one will get to choose the first present of the year, and the little boy is chosen.  He selects not a toy, but one of the reindeer's jingle bells.  The jingle bell symbolizes the belief in Santa, and as long as you believe, you'll always be able to hear the bell.<br /><br />Much to his dismay, he realizes that the bell has fallen through a hole in the pocket of his robe.  Arriving back home, he returns to bed, but on Christmas morning, he finds the bell wrapped especially from Santa.<br /><br />This is an excellent book, and it contains a wonderful message for children and adults. The story is captivating right from the start, and the pictures are bold and colorful. My children and I have seen the wonderful movie, and they enjoy hearing the book as well.<br /><br />Always believe in the magic of Christmas.  Adults still have some of the \\"kid\\" in them as well.  So when you celebrate Christmas, always believe in Santa and ring your jingle bells.
B00005NGZX|5.0|With the 2001 release of their fourth official studio album, Converge has put the final sealing blow on their status as a legend in the world of metallic hardcore. A relatively logical extension from the chain of events that led from Halo in a Haystack up to their split LP with Agoraphoric Nosebleed, Jane Doe seems completely watertight and flawless. Their churning, chaotic guitars are more dense and layered - fleshed out. Jakob Bannon's vocals seem somehow even more raw in the right places, more beautiful and ethereal in the others. Rhythms are as hectic and ADD-driven as ever, ripping back and forth, locking into mindless grooves, and then blurting back out in a structured mess. Experimentation with texture and mood unravels itself throughout the 12 tracks, yet maintains some cohesive element of undefined focus. Throughout all of the morphing and movement, some element of feeling remains, insisting that this album is an experience - an encyclopedic envelopment of so much at once
0671027344|4.0|This was a great book for the young adults. The main character, Charlie, talked about his life as a teenager in new surroundings like the high school with upperclassmen friends. I was able to picture myself in a lot of the same situations because the author made it so easy for you to \\"interact\\" with the book. There were surprises in the book dealing with friends, family and him self. This is one of those \\"hard to put down\\" books.  <br /> Throughout the book Charlie is writing to a friend. He never tells you who he is writing to or who he is. He uses code names for his friends and family. He also says that the places he is writing about are made up so you cannot find his whereabouts. I thought that this was one of the reasons I kept reading, just waiting for the reveal of the person he is writing to.  <br />  The Perks of Being a Wallflower dealt a lot with drugs, alcohol, sex and peer pressure which made the book a more realistic book for young adults. <br />
B00004YYDI|5.0|A superb film that definitely benefits from being seen in its full version. As other reviewers have done such a good job of describing the contents, I just wanted to allay the concerns of some potential viewers. <br /> <br />Some people have used variants of the word 'pedophilia' in describing the interactions between the 12 year-old played so brilliantly by Portman, and Leon. This is an inappropriate use of this often mis-used word. The Direction here is such that there is no exploitative footage, and while the story's Lolita undercurrents are clearly there, they do not detract from what is a superb thriller and action movie. <br /> <br />Such irresponsible mis-uses of the word ironically undermine the seriousness of true pedophilia which often involves children under the age of five, which is truly sick and obscene. <br /> <br />Portman's streetwise 12 year-old should not make anybody feel uncomfortable. She is a fine actress and this is a fine movie.
0440237688|4.0|I was introduced to this book as an adult working with adolescents. I could'nt put it down, it was imaginative, yet almost possible!!! It really made you think about how the world could be. It also made me gratefull for my freedoms in a simple yet strong way. I read this boook first on my own then re-read it with my ten year old boy, who loved it!!! As soon as we finished we went looking for its \\"sister book\\", \\"Gathering Blue\\".
B00009NHC5|5.0|This thriller stars Audrey Hepburn as Suzy Hendrix, a recently-blinded woman whose husband unknowingly brings home a doll filled with narcotics.  It belongs to some very unsavory criminals (including Alan Arkin and Richard Crenna) who will do anything to get the doll back.  They terrorize Suzy, who must use every bit of her cunning to defend herself.<br /><br />Hepburn is just great; lovely and sympathetic as Suzy, but Arkin really steals the show.  As thug Harry Roat, he is so cruel, creepy, and repulsive, you will be on the edge of your seat. I've never forgotten this film because of his electrifying performance (you will jump at the end!).  I recommend it for those who like to be scared; you will be.<br /><br />Kona
B000929AJQ|5.0|I got a copy of the new NIN album, and Im blown away. After listening to it a couple of times I realized what an amazing piece of work it is. At first I had to sit back and figure out what it was. It didnt sound like typical Nine inch nails, but as I listened on, I heard Nine Inch Nails all over it. Obviously The guy cant make the same album over and over again, so this is fresh, with some fresh sounds. The Lyrics are amazing, and his vocals are on point. It also has kick, and life, wich is what I look for yet still has those songs that give you the chills. All and all its amazing. Its a very mature album and I think it will be a classic. I give it five stars an advise everyone to give it a listen , seems like this guy is gonna take the world by storm again!!
0553573403|3.0|After listening to these books for 100 hours, with 15 hours left in the 3rd book, A Storm of Swords, I've had enough.<br /><br />  The story focuses in turn on individual major characters, namely a brave castle lord, his brave wife, his 4 sons and 2 daughters, an evil queen and her evil brother, and a teenage girl across the sea who considers herself the rightful heir to the throne.  Some parts of the story are exciting and fun, so I've kept listening in spite of many unsettling plot devices.<br /><br />  So far, the brave lord has been decapitated in front of his daughter, a son has been thrown off a building and left paraplegic, the family's ancestral castle has been burned and their loyal servants killed, 3 children are missing and believed (by the brave mother) to be dead, and the oldest son has been treacherously murdered in a banquet hall despite his mother's pleas.  Then the brave mother herself, the only remaining sympathetic adult character who might possibly have pulled the story to some satisfactory ending, has had the skin peeled from her face and been partially eaten by crows before being killed. Meanwhile the evil queen and her ilk are doing very well.<br /><br />  Why would the author write this cruel farce?  It's fair to say that he wants to avoid the appearance of sentimentality and perhaps introduce a \\"realistic\\" element into his strange brand of fiction, but we feel him pulling strings and jerking us around, so how realistic is that?<br /><br />  Mr. Martin should think about why people want to read fiction.  It's because we want to hear a good story - well-told, deep and meaningful.  Villains shouldn't be allowed to triumph to the point of wiping out all adult members of a story's central sympathetic family.  No satisfying vengeance is possible at this point, so why go on reading (or, in my case, listening)?<br /><br />  I realize the author is hoping that we'll plod on, in hopes that some of the younger children will grow up, become sympathetic, and deliver some belated justice to the wicked.  Well, sorry, but forget it.  I can't tolerate any more of this.elated justice to the wicked.  Well, sorry, but forget it.  I can't tolerate any more of this.
B0007GAEW6|1.0|The Mars Volta have been hailed as one of the most innovative bands out now.  Their complex song structures, philosophical lyrics, and no fear of long songs have critics penning them as the band that is making rock interesting again.  And if that's the case, my forthcoming three-hour recording of seven midgets taking a sledgehammer to a baby grand should sell like hotcakes.    What the critics call \\"complex song structures\\", I call \\"taking a 33-minute song and putting six track breaks at random intervals on the CD\\".  What they call \\"philosophical lyrics\\", I call \\"reading random entries from a Spanish-to-English dictionary\\".  What the critics call \\"no fear of long songs\\", I call \\"not knowing when to stop\\".  The end result is an unlistenable mess, catering strictly to indie music geeks and Lester Bangs wannabes too afraid of losing their precious \\"street cred\\" to admit that they secretly love Rush and Yes more than Hot Hot Heat or the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.    There is no shortage of bands that play complex music.  How TMV, the worst of the bunch, gets all the critical acclaim is beyond me.  Perhaps one of these days Cedric and Omar will admit that The Mars Volta was all a prank.  It's the only reason I could think of that this album would see the light of day.
B0007Y08IS|3.0|An amazing technical achievement, sure to please fans of Godzilla, StingRay, and Thunderbirds, especially when the film version of \\"Thunderbirds\\" wimped out and did NOT use puppets. I thought \\"Not their best writing, not their best songs, but I'm still in tears laughing!\\" What made \\"South Park, Bigger, Longer, Uncut\\" so funny was that it was a rich raunchy parody of various Broadway hits. \\"Team America\\" was political satire, and altho that is simpler, the boys manage quite a feat in walking a fine line politically - while we laugh at the dumbness of the \\"Team America\\" squad as it obliviously does as much damage as the terrorists, we also laugh as they fight the comically stereotyped Hollywood liberals.
B0000AM6K2|5.0|From the opening bars of \\"1972\\" we know this is going to be a special treat as Rouse opens with a homage, \\"She was feelin' 1972, groovin' to a Carole King tune, 'Is it too late baby?'\\"  \\"Love Vibration\\" hosts a flower power message with Rouse's joyful chorus, \\"Now you people all know what I'm talking about.\\"  \\"Sunshine (Come On Lady)\\" has Marc Pisapia's bongo rhumba beat upon which Rouse builds a shimmering little ditty.  \\"James\\" is a breezy melody with Jim Hoke's flute giving an airy feel about a loser who abandons his family and embraces a life of alcoholism.  James Haggerty's bass sets a nice jazz groove on \\"Come Back (Light Therapy)\\" and then Josh layers in a delightfully addictive soulful melody, \\"I'm gonna stay on this mountain high 'til you come running back.\\"  \\"Flight Attendant\\" starts with a Latin-flavored soft rhythm and then Josh's hushed Nick Drake-school vocals whisper, \\"I grew up so scared, the bible belt, redneck lifestyle; one day I'll fly free in the airplane.\\"  \\"Sparrows Over Birmingham\\"  starts off with a gospel flavor and then transforms into a soft shoe, \\"You grew up an isolated pup, you had some books, you had some love, oh god was watching over you.\\"  The CD concludes with \\"Rise,\\" a stunningly original melody, \\"I should of caught a ride on Brooklyn train, meet on the corner & I'll entertain.\\"  \\"1972\\" is a fully realized set that satisfies completely.  Bravo!
B0000C8AQM|5.0|If you are one of the many that find yourself sing <br />ing songs from this movie like 247 than <br />buy this cd its one of my new favorite cds. <br />Its very funny and all of the songs are really <br />catchy.When I say funny I mean like sometimes <br />they will have little phrases from the movie <br />on it its cool.Oh also they cuse just A teeny  <br />bit if that would bother anybody. <br />If you dont like rock music than you wont <br />like this cd.
B0000047EC|4.0|Although it's from 1997, \\"Beyond the Missouri Sky\\" sounds as freshly dreamy today as it did upon its release.  Pat Metheny grew up in Lee's Summit, Missouri and Charlie Haden in Forsyth; therefore, the title of this set.  No, this is not the CD that you want to put on to wake up in the morning to get you out of bed.  This is the weekend CD you want when you want to linger an extra hour between the sheets.  However, the mix between Metheny's guitar & Hayden's bass applied to some lovely melodies does create a variety of beautiful moods.  Metheny's \\"Tears of Rain\\" has dark elements and a good energy, much like the force of a good rainstorm.  \\"The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress\\" by Jimmy Webb is the melody I'm most familiar with and has a such a lovely contemplative feel compared with Linda Rondstadt's or Joe Cocker's pop versions, both of which I enjoy.  The opener \\"Waltz for Ruth\\" is a pretty tune with Hayden's bass exploring sonic space.  On Henry Mancini's \\"Two for the Road,\\" Hayden & Metheny produce a lovely sense of theatre as the song seems to embody the emotions of travel, an anticipation of what's to come & wistful sense for that left behind.  The CD closer \\"Spiritual\\" by Hayden's son Josh is a delicate melody that trickles a peaceful close to the set.  This is a lovely recording, one that is sure to find a cherished place for decades to come.  Enjoy!
0385474547|5.0|This book is one wonderful piece of literature, recently read. It shows the struggles between culture that did occur and it shows the despair of the man who held steadfast to his traditions, culture, and ancestors be usurped. Suggested reading along with this book: \\"The Second COming,\\" a poem by W.B. Yeats
B0000029DD|5.0|I feel a little fortunate that I had this album before the untimely passing of Jeff Buckley. I heard a version of \\"Hallelujah\\" in Los Angeles that swept me off my feet, and literally had to stop what I was doing till I found out who was singing it. I friend of mine at CBS hooked me up with this CD and was excited beyond anything I usually would hear from her. \\"Expect great things from this guy, Tim,\\" she told me. \\"We think he's going to be a major artist.\\"<br /><br />Little did she realize how prophetic she was. Three years after releasing his only fully produced album, Jeff took that ill-fated Memphis dive in the Mississippi. Which leaves us with \\"Grace,\\" an in-your-face statement of artistic boldness that pressed the folk-mysticism of Van Morrison with bursts of rock that would have made Led Zepplin proud. The songs stretch at their seams with both frustrated sensuality and unbridled joy, and an uncompromising musical vision.<br /><br />From the teasing come-hither of \\"Lover You Should Have Come Over\\" to the cabaret jazz curiosities that would lead him to cover \\"Lilac Wine,\\" Buckley's self-confidence carries \\"Grace\\" to an intensely personal level that so many artists shy away from. It made \\"Grace\\" a standout in 1994, and has kept it on my desert island list for over a decade. It's also the touchstone that his now rabid cult takes their cues from. After all, he delivered a stunning debut, cut a tragic profile even in life, and disappeared far too young. Fortunately for the casually curious, \\"Grace\\" lives up to its reputation.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Basically, \\"Mezmerize\\" sounds different from all their other albums, but if I had to compare it, it sounds most like \\"Steal This Album.\\"  It's not as hard as their self-titled, but it's faster and a bit crazier than most of their other songs.  Their guitar riffs and melodies are really catchy, like in B.Y.O.B., Revenga, Radio/Video, and Violent Pornography (possibly compared to Peephole.  A friend of mine compared some of these songs to Mr. Bungle, if you know who they are).  Then you have your slower, more serious songs, like Soldier Side - Intro, Question!, Sad Statue, and Lost In Hollywood (like Ego Brain, Spiders, Aerials, and Roulette).  There's the techno of Old School Hollywood, and the craziness of Cigaro and This Cocain Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song (like I-E-A-I-A-I-O, CUBErt, Psycho, and Bounce).  The guitarist, Daron Malakian, does a lot more singing in \\"Mezmerize\\" than any of the other previous albums.  In fact, he pretty much sings all of Lost In Hollywood. <br /> <br />Overall, I would say this is one of their best albums, but you really can't compare it to their others, because, like I said, they're all different, and the song comparisons I made are just to give you and idea of the kind of mood the songs might give you.  They don't sound anything like those songs.  You can tell they put a lot of effort into this album.  The only downside is that the album is short (about 35 minutes).  I guess you can say it's short, but sweet.  Let's hope \\"Hypnotize\\" is worth waiting for, and it's at least 40 minutes.  I consider 40 minutes to be a complete album.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Well here it is, \\"Mezmerize,\\" which I have been waiting on for some  time now. Now it's time to say something to the nay sayers... <br /> <br />This isn't just ANY band you're dealing with I hope you know. This is the type of band that if you don't \\"get them\\" you won't ever get a true understanding of them. So those who say it's the worst thing and to the one who said this should be in the comedy section...get a life. <br /> <br />Now with that aside I really enjoyed the debut album, Toxicity, and Steal This Album, so I figured this one can't be too far off.  <br />And, as usual, I ran up to Best Buy on my work break and jammed it right into my car CD player as soon as I could. Now I will admit in some sense even what I hear on this CD surprised me, as nothing came off more surprising then the song \\"Cigaro.\\" But for every weird point (Could Violent Pornography get any odd then it is?) there is a great song such as \\"BYOB,\\" \\"Question!\\" \\"Sad Statue,\\" and \\"Old School Hollywood.\\" I can also equate the beginning of \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" to \\"Aeriels.\\" But let's not disgard \\"Revenga,\\" \\"Radio/Video,\\" and \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I am On this Song\\" are also SOAD quality and could never be mistaken for any other band alive.  <br /> <br />But I do have a gripe or two actually which is why I gave this CD 4 instead of orginally 5. Two of the songs (Cigaro and This Cocaine) both clock in under 2:12 which really never gives them time to develop (not that Cigaro needed to improvise upon it's already childish theme.) Another thing which I found depressing is the fact that, unlike Toxicity, swear and curse words are thrown around as novelties instead of working into the rhythm of the song (the part in BYOB where Serj and Daron go \\"Where the F*** are You makes my point stand on it's own.)  <br /> <br />And finally, speaking of Daron Malakian, it appears to me he sings a lot more on this album then he ever did on a SOAD CD in the past. That can be a good and a bad thing because itoffers a contrast to Serj's often narrotive voice but at the same time Daron comes off sounding whiny and stretching his chords. I wonder how well Shavo Odadjian and John Dolmayan can sing?  <br /> <br />Well that's my review of the new SOAD CD Mezmerize so let me leave you with this final thought if you would have skipped the body of this review: this IS System of a Down. This is not like anything else that exists and this CD further proves not only the creative side but the experimental (listen to \\"Old Hollywood\\") both combine into one helluva CD. But few minor issues would keep this CD from a 5 in my book, but it is an essential for SOAD fans, metal fans, and politically incorrect people alike!
B0000027RL|5.0|Although Grunge has come and gone, this remains one that will echo through time. This album was perhaps the single greatest achievement to rock music aside from Nirvana in years. Pearl Jam would then continue to make music, but in my opinion, burnt out later on in their careers. <br /> <br />The album has many tracks which were popular among listeners of the radio as well as junkies looking for good music. \\"Even Flow\\" has one of the most memorable lines as well as \\"Black\\", which is a tad bit slower than the other songs on this delightful album.  <br /> <br />\\"Jeremy\\" is another interesting song, which kinda reminds me of people back in the day. \\"Porch\\" is another great contribution to the album based on its lyrics. Pretty good and soft, a great listen. <br /> <br />The best song on this album is \\"Alive\\", which makes me think of staying up, never backing down. \\"Hey, I'm still alive!!!\\" is one of the most memorable lines to this song. It just makes me think about going strong, living strong, etc.  <br /> <br />Anyone who heard these guys play back in '91 must get this album. It is not just essential to a grunge collector, but rather an audience with the starving ears for good rock music. This album is something you can't miss!!! <br /> <br />If you like this album, check out \\"Nevermind\\" by Nirvana, \\"Temple of the Dog\\" by Temple of the Dog, \\"Dirt\\" by Alice In Chains, and \\"Sweet Oblivion\\" by Screaming Trees.
B00078XKDE|2.0|It was through hearing the single 'The Good Ones' on a local non-comm station, that I was inclined to pick this up.  The song presentation is a moody and thick dirge.  Rude vintage guitar tones fuzz-smear their way into melding the bottom end with the vocals resulting in a single insistent ZZZZVOOOOBBB!! of a sound.  Being recorded in the midst of the analog heaven at Sear Sound in New York had everything to do with that.  Certainly the best tools were on hand to deliver the classic warmth this disc provides.    It took approximately one-point-two listens to this disc to nail down exactly why \\"No Wow\\" falters as a whole.  The Kills have managed to fill an entire album with exactly the same song- over and over and over.  Producer John Agnello should have exposed this fact to the band.  The culprit is that the verse vocal phrasing is identical on every song.  Rudimentary one or two bar ascending or descending  melody phrases take place within only a single octave directly result in nothing but boring-begets-grating-becomes-\\"didn't I just hear this song?\\"-insanity.    Having walked into a club in Detroit where the Kills were playing I can say that my feelings were immediately corroborated by the crowd reaction.  Mostly there because the media hype said they should be, the audience were a disinterested lot at best when confronted with this drum machine powered (oxymoron?) 2-piece.  At present there seems to be a glut of this guy/girl thing going on now too whether it be the Raveonettes, White Stripes, or even Ani DiFranco.    As a point of fact, there's a new service that the major labels are beginning to use called 'Hit Song Science' from Germany.  The service analyzes the waveforms of songs and then compares them to songs that have been past hits.  We all can speculate why this would be a bad, bad thing for the music industry.  Was it used here?  Don't know, but it sure sounds like it.  There are rumors to the fact that those responsible for that first Norah Jones disc used HSS in the process and unfortunately that disc suffers exactly the same fate. Let's hope this is not a trend to come...the sound of this band and recording had promise.

0316172324|3.0|The first one-third of this book had me recommending it to others because it confirmed my own belief in the importance of acting upon our first impressions and relying on our subconsicous to help us make good decisions.  The second third started to lose me, however, as the author got bogged down in examples of how those snap or \\"blink\\" decisions may be incorrect due to prejudices and biased information stored in our subconsicous minds, or because we lack sufficient knowledge and experience to make reliable snap decisions.  The final third of the book left me wondering what was the author's fundamental premise for writing the book since he seemed to contradict much of what came before.  He gave examples of \\"thin slicing\\" decisions but failed to mention how this may relate to the 80/20 Principle or Rule.  In fact, much of the book seems to be about pushing the 80/20 rule to an extreme, yet there is no reference to the rule at all.  Nevertheless, I found many of the numerous examples that were presented to be entertaining,interesting and worth remembering.  There are several examples and statistics that I will probably refer to in some of the courses that I teach.  And the bottom line is that although the author lost me in the details, the book encouraged me to trust my instincts and to apply thin slicing decision making even more than I already do.  For a more coherent presentation of the concept and power of thin slicing decisions I recommend \\"The 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Success by Achieving More with Less\\" by Richard Koch.
B00067189O|3.0|Extras on here are nice, but not nice enough to buy again if you already own a copy. If you don't already own this and were planning to buy it anyway, then it may be worth $1 or $2 extra, but it's not worth an extra $15 if you already own an earlier CD version. Yet another example of clueless music companies thinking they can still get away with jacking up the prices forever just because they decided to start throwing a few extras on.
0440180295|4.0|I think Slaughterhouse-Five was one of my first books I read with aliens involved in it. And because I considered all alien-involving things to be boring, I considered this novel to be the same. However, the novel turned out to be very interesting. Because I am a slow reader, I often got bored with novels. But this novel wasn't boring. The continuous time changes provided new stories, and the freshness of each scene kept my eyes on the novel.  I liked the idea that Billy, the main character, wasn't able to change the happenings of his life moments. Although he revisited same scenes of his life, he couldn't change what had happened before. It showed the importance of decisions, choices, and actions people made in their lives.    When I was reading the novel, I wasn't focusing so much on the anti-war theme(what other people commented about). Instead, I thought Billy was really traveling through time, and I tried to imagine his life through my mind. And I pitied Billy. And I decided that going back time or looking out to the future was not always something to be excited about because people don't always have good memories and your past could be full of resentment. And I thought it would be most meaningful if I appreciated my \\"present,\\" which Billy didn't have, and do my best to make my time full of happiness.    Slaughterhouse-Five taught me the value of life. It also planted me positive thoughts about alien-involving novels. Lastly, I just want to comment that the novel would have been more interesting if it showed more emotions. I wanted to see how the author would have made Billy feel. Although I liked the idea of leaving the interpreting the \\"very emtional part\\" to the readers, I wanted some profound emtions in order to understand the author's intention more fully. But overall, it was an exciting novel with various scenes and life-related morals to ponder on.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|im not a huge SOAD fan. i recorded their first album from a friend after i heard \\"spiders\\" and then i heard a few off Toxicity and went and got it....LOVED IT!!! when \\"Steal This Ablum\\" came out i didnt go get it because i wasnt a huge fan, i still havent heard it to this day. then i started hearing Cigaro and BYOB on the internet a few months ago and fell in love with both songs, so i knew i had to get this new one. Well, it came out today and although i still havent gotten a chance ot hear it all (i will tonight after work) i have heard maybe 4 songs off of it and i dig 'em. so since i cant go thru all the songs, i will say that i can tell already that it is a great album. a lot of SOAD fans bitch and complain about their political views, and you know what? i could care less, i couldnt give a frogs fat ass who they hate, love, support or dont support, i dig SOAD for their music and their sound. although i think Toxicity might be alittle better, this album rocks!!!
B000002VCO|5.0|Groups like Yes or Genesis or Pink Floyd or Moody Blues or ELO  have two different musical \\"eras\\", an early progressive period, and a later more \\"radio friendly\\" period.  You can find fans of either period and these fans can be quite \\"die-hard\\" in their preferences. The Alan Parson Project is no exception. <br />So...If you ONLY like the progressive edge of APP, this CD may not be for you.   <br /> <br />However,  if you simply want the pure guilty pleasure of <br />beautiful, well-crafted studio recordings,  this album is a must have!  It is a significant departure from the previous \\"Eye In The Sky\\" (also a 4 star release, in my opinion), but this album doesn't have a bad song on it. <br />Yes, it is more pop oriented.  Yes, it does have more verse-chorus 4 minute song writing.  Yes,  \\"Don't Answer Me\\" was played on the radio way too much at the time,  but from the <br />tick-tick-tick-tick of the high-hat cymbal at the beginning of <br />Prime Time to the last tracks final fade out,  I am taken away to some other place.   <br /> <br />If you aren't stuck in the 70's and think all rock after that sucks...find a comfortable chair and kick back for a tall, cool <br />glass of pure listening enjoyment. <br /> <br />
B0000AFX64|5.0|I don't judge a show by what the actors do after it ends, but the claim that most of the cast never worked again is false. Battlestar certainly didn't hurt Jane Seymour's career. Seymour did indeed work again. Dirk Benedict went on to one of the most popular shows of the 80's after Battlestar. Rick Springfield certainly went on to great popularity and was huge after Battlestar. Noah Hathaway's continued to entertain me in various projects when I was a kid. Ed Begley continued to act and went on to one of the most popular shows of the 80's. Glen Larson certainly had great success writing and producing hit TV series after Battlestar. Richard Hatch continues to be heavily involved in Battlestar related projects and fandom because of the original Battlestar Galactica. Terry Carter contined to act in too many things to mention and it should be noted that he produced and excellent film about Duke Ellington. And Herb Jefferson Jr continued to do TV work and may not have become famous but he is too damn cool all the same. Maren Jensen was astoundingly attractive and my affection for her as Athena remains. Laurette Spanning and Sarah Rush also still make my pulse race! I really had a fantastic time watching this DVD! Too bad there are negative Scrooges who refuse to enjoy the \\"hammy\\" bits. The \\"hammy\\" bits are part of the fun! Some claim that the 1.0 sound is a problem but I grew up watching this show in mono so it sounds far better now. It was really wonderful seeing this movie again!
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Who listens to this crap & really thinks it's great music? More of that tired silly pattern of mellow sleepy songs bursting into angry stupid pontificating. If you really are that driven by political issues then at least try and come up with a more creative method of expressing it. The only thing memorable about this music is how absolutely ridiculous it sounds.
B000002LCK|3.0|I thought there was more to this group.  I guess it's hard to imagine how new this kind of music must have sounded in its time, but since so many other groups did syntho-pop in the 80's as well, this band got lost in the historical shuffle.  Does this track sound distinctly New Order, or is it Depeche Mode?  Or maybe Dead or Alive?  Sad thing is that \\"Bizarre Love Triangle\\" is a masterpiece, and other songs on this album set could have been improved if someone had worked on them a little longer.  The salvation of a lot of techno music is in its complexity.  If a synth tune is limited to one repetitive theme and a dozen or so forgettable words, it loses some of its punch.
B0000009SG|3.0|After hearing great live versions of camarillo brillo, dirty love, zomby woof and dinamoe, i think the original studio versions are to slow and dull. Sorry, i just cant get used to them... <br /> <br />Im the slime has never been one of my favorites actually i think its one of his worst songs. Cant understand its on Strictly Commersial. <br /> <br />I like fifty-fifty; its powerful, weird and intense, like a cousin to \\"I come from nowhere\\". <br /> <br />Montana is always great. <br /> <br />Overall, this is tame for a Zappa album. The songs are better with other arrengments. Check out You cant do that on stage anymore 6 and you see what i mean!
B00065JTBA|5.0|Bon Jovi is one of the hairband rock groups that has managed to stay longer than the novelty would have permitted. Why? Because the group has been down for change and revamping image and substance. For example, they started out a little hard but began to merge towards rock balladry. Take for instance, \\"These Days\\" an album chock full of rock ballads and lyrically complex love songs. As they ventured into the 90's and 2000's, the group changed again to infuse the sounds of yesterrock with the sounds of alternative stylings. Their recent works still reflect that as a group, they have still got some gas in them. <br />So... 100,000,000 fans, whils sounding a bit absurd in numbers, may be a near accurate portrayal of those who hold the rock group near and dear to their hearts. What some neglect to see is this rock group is INSANELY popular outside of the USA as well.  <br />I am a fan of Bon Jovi. I love all of their albums to date. I anticipate future releases. So, in response to an earlier review about disbelief that there are so many fans of such a horrid music group, yeah... there are probably really close to that number.  <br />Bon Jovi offers their unreleased music... rarities... and B-Sides. It is fun to listen to each... and it is extreemly honorable of them to release a box set that features more than half of the songs as never released. A good buy for the fans who want something more from this continous rock group.
B00001QGPR|3.0|Having highly enjoyed the energy of Outside and Earthling, I was initially disappointed in this understated collection.  These songs have, however, endeared themselves to me over time. <br /> <br />This is Bowie (or at least the narrators of the songs) being introspective and reflective.  As a result, the music is ponderous, intentional, and cryptic. <br /> <br />Be patient with this record.  It'll be worth your time.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I have been a System fan for over 3or 4 years and I enjoy their music and their style. Mezmerize is another great effort by SOAD. I would recommend that all of the fans get this album. System of a down is an aquired taste. You either love them or hate them. Some of the standouts on this album are: BYOB, Radio/Video, Revega, Sad Statue, and Old School Hollywood.
B00011V8CW|3.0|If you're open-minded enough to like such diverse Bowie offerings as Never Let Me Down, Young Americans, and Tonight, you'll like Black Tie White Noise. <br /> <br />Hear Bowie combining elevator jazz, dance beats, and pop songs structures.  Listen to Bowie's dissonant saxophone (supposedly playing middle eastern tonalities) clash with funky bass lines.  Listen to forboding, fractured lyrics imbue tired arrangments with new meaning. <br /> <br />A good pastiche. <br /> <br />Some of the extra tracks (especially Lucy Can't Dance) are fun, and the bonus DVD is worth watching.  It's especially entertaining to watch Bowie defend his \\"heterosexuality.\\"
1400076943|5.0|The story evolves around a Nigerian family - narrated through the voice of 16 year old Kambili Achike. The voice is lucid, and we get insight into corrupt governments and their politics. Kambili's father is extremely religious, and is too conscious of his patriarchal role in the household...he often abuses his wife and children in the name of God. Papa will not hesitate to flog his wife or his children when he feels that they have sinned. This family is a microcosm of Nigeria in many ways. According to Adichie, the are so many churches being formed at every corner in Lagos, and yet Nigeria remains one of the most corrupt countries. Kambili and her brother Jaja are prisoners in their own home, until they take a visit to Nsukka, where Aunty Ifeoma lives. Kambili falls in love with Father Amadi, a young Catholic priest who also helps to morph her into a free spirit.    The story is all too real. I know people in life who are carbon copies of the characters in the book. \\"Purple Hibiscus\\"  reminds one of how Africa - with its dozens of countries and hundreds of languages - faces similar ills, and shares many cultural aspects. Yes, this novel is also a celebration of Igbo culture - - its cuisine and language. Adichie uses a sizable Igbo vocabulary, but does it very effectively without saturating the novel.    The story is very life-like and there are many lessons to draw from. It highlights family life and generational conflicts in Nigeria. It is an amazing debut, I am eagerly awaiting her next work!
B000065V1V|3.0|Don't get me wrong: this is another good Bowie album (does he really have a bad one, or just varying degrees of \\"good\\"?).  Tracks like Sunday, Slow Burn, Slip Away, and Heathen (The Rays) make this album a must-have. <br /> <br />At the same time, the stylistic shifts on this album make the listening experience bumpy.  You'll hear jagged, experimental arrangements like those on Outside alongside theatrical compositions reminiscent of certain tracks on Aladdin Sane.  You'll hear \\"straightforward\\" (is Bowie ever straightforward?) rock n' roll songs alongside dirges that could have come from hours...  <br /> <br />Granted, Bowie achieves some sort of consistency in his diversity, but I would have preferred that this album was mixed a little more consistently to tie the disparate styles together. <br /> <br />Not so much a cohesive statement as a sample-platter of the styles Bowie has played with over the years.
6300215954|5.0|Wonderful movie, fun, and very exciting.  John Wayne at his best.  I enjoyed the animals, Africa and the movie in all its entity.
B000000W9Z|5.0|Outside is one of Bowie's most engaging and satisfying works.  The sound is impenetrably dense.  The best way to describe it is jazz meets industrial. <br /> <br />The \\"storyline\\" is ambiguous, which allows (or demands) for each listener to superimpose their own meanings onto the proceedings.  The experience becomes interactive, unlike listening to writers that like to tell you exactly how they're feeling and what their songs are about. <br /> <br />Ultimately, I don't think the \\"storyline\\" is the point of this album.  I think it's about situations, textures, atmospheres, moments.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|this is the type of rock that gives itself a bad name- my friend bought this- and i started laughing- thats how bad it is--ahahaha- if you like this--then....hahahahahahaha
B000067CQK|3.0|I give this edition the same \\"score\\" as I do the original album.  I think the extra disc neither adds to nor detracts from the presentation of the original. <br /> <br />I do wish that \\"Sweet Head\\" had made the original cut.  It is so much rawer than anything that wound up on the album (not that ...Ziggy Stardust... was ever intended to be raw). <br /> <br />Holy Holy is also quite pleasing and contains an unmistakable, dramatic Bowie chord sequence.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|can you tell? i can! This album is not good.<br /><br />In a way it's a shame I don't like it - it's been touted as Dream Theater's heaviest yet, closest to thrash metal, furthest from prog-metal. I like heavy metal; I like crunchy riffs; I don't mind a lack of melody. I saw Dream Theater cover Metallica's Master of Puppets in its entirety at a concert in New York, and it was awe-inspiring. I was hoping they'd take that early-Metallica influence and do something cool with it. Instead, they've come up with their most tedious album since... uh... their last one. Sigh.<br /><br />Train of Thought is tedious in an entirely different way than Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence was. While it's chock full of similarly forgettable songs, they're forgettable mostly because they consist in large part of tired heavy metal riffs played really fast over. and. over. again. Keyboards play a much lesser role on this album; I never thought I'd miss the presence of Jordan Rudess (for a while I blamed him for Dream Theater's decline into suck-hood), but jesus! Anything to get Petrucci to quit showing off! Play Prog!<br /><br />So, yeah - Train of Thought is basically devoid of memorable melodies (the ballad \\"Vacant\\" is laughable and extraneous); and although it contains a few riffs that are pretty potent, most of them sound recycled and, frankly, dull. And none of them are potent or interesting enough to sustain songs that almost invariably extend to ten exhausting minutes or more.<br /><br />This review might be a little overly harsh. It just pisses me off that a band I used to like so much, and a band with so much techincal talent, can put out such garbage. I mentioned on a message forum that maybe Dream Theater should just become a Metallica cover band instead of trying to write their own songs. These days, I'd like them much better that way. It's going to take a serious turnaround for these guys ever to get my attention again.<br /><br />Thank goodness I'm finished with this review, so I don't have to listen to this album ever again.review, so I don't have to listen to this album ever again.
B00001OH82|4.0|Fans and critics that wanted Bowie to stay the same (when has he ever done that?) were offended when he did this hard and heavy rawk album.  Ignore their criticism.  This album is vital, gutsy rock n' roll with amazing drum and guitar theatrics.  In places, Tin Machine shows as much intelligence as anything else Bowie has done. <br /> <br />Give this album a chance!
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|What are these guys thinking? Are they trying to make a transition like Metallica? After listening to this album after I bought it; I realized that it dosent seem like they will be able to top their last album. Some music you shouldn't have to pay for; this is that album. My advise: DOWNLOAD it instead...
B00001OH80|3.0|This is Bowie's highly entertaining take on lounge schmaltz.  You will hear the cheesiest arrangements and Bowie's most melodramatic croon. <br /> <br />Fans that take their music too seriously need not purchase this one.
0743455967|5.0|Quite simply, this is the most inspiring book on the writing craft that you will ever read. First, because Stephen King gives you a glimpse into the early stages of his career as a writer, when he struggled as hard as anyone to get something published. He is brutally candid about the shortcomings of his early work, yet clear about how much he loved to write and the sheer volume of writing necessary to improve. <br /> <br />And second, because he gives you an honest description of his method of approaching a story. But he does so not in a pedantic, academic way but rather with the storytelling magic for which he's become so famous. It's the most entertaining look at the writer's craft that you're ever likely to read.  <br /> <br />Buy it to learn about the craft. Buy it to simply enjoy. It's as much fun to read as his novels.  <br /> <br />

0792833201|5.0|Though perhaps not as scary anymore compared to how I used to react when seeing \\"Poltergeist\\" when I was younger -times surely have changed, I mean; today we have asian-horror-masterpieces like \\"The Ring\\" and \\"The Grudge\\" (and many, many more of those), and imagination surely knows no limit -we're in 2005 and horror-movies are only getting creepier and creepier, but not many of the later horror-movies can be compared to the style and charm of \\"Poltergeist\\" -the story here does far more than just making people scared, we really get to \\"know\\" the characters -and the acting from the entire cast(!) is amazing. The chemistry between the members of the family \\"Poltergeist\\" is indeed there -and this way the movie and story is presented in a way as superb as was \\"Jaws\\" (though of course very different also). The highlights of the movie are many, so many legendary scenes like the pool, the toy-clown, the \\"they're here\\"-scene and so on and on.     \\"Poltergeist\\" is in other words famous for a reason, and highly recommended for horro-fans the world over!
B00005JMJG|5.0|I have not seen any of Charlie Kaufman's other films, so am unable to compare in that fashion.  Also, Michael Crane did an excellent job describing the movie.  My comment is on Jim Carrey.  Not only is he able to jump from over the top physical humor to dramatic acting, he did it in a way that made me forget his previous characters.  I thought his performance was incredible.  In addition, the chemistry with Kate Winslet was like listening to good music.  They harmonized :)  (With a little discordance thrown in by Elijah Wood)  Finally, the ending was perfect for the tone of the movie!    One caveat:  watch this movie when you have time to pay attention, there is a lot of nuance!  Always best to get it the first time.  Enjoy!
0060977493|3.0|John Updike, writing about this novel, says that \\"a novel of real ambition must invent its own language.\\"  This novel certainly does invent its own language, but that doesn't make it a great novel.  Frankly, I disagree with Updike's assertion; there are plenty of great, ambitious novels whose strengths lie in character delevopment, epic sweep, great dialogue, deep insights into human nature, etc. and don't invent their own language.  But whether Updike is correct is neither here nor there.  The newly invented language in this novel is cute for about twenty pages, then grows tiresome and feels forced.  It tends to confuse and bewilder more than impress.  Countless catchy turns of phrase simply had me scratching my head.<br /><br />Furthermore, the plot meanders aimlessly in a way that is at best distracting.  Roy is ambitious in her plot structure, too ambitious in my opinion.  A simpler narration would have been far more powerful.  This novel is a perfect example of a gifted yet inexperienced author reaching too far and coming up short.

B0002OOUP0|1.0|Can you say Cash In? The Stones are over. They have been for a long time. Actually they were done when they made that travesty, slap in the face to all Stones fans, Bridges To Babylon. Jagger makes me sick, Ronnie was always mediocre at best and the once unbelievable Kieth is a mockery of himself. He can't even write an entertainig song anymore and his playing is atrocious. Thank God for Charlie Watts, but he's been costing for the last 25 years. He wants out in the worst way. If it wasn't for Kieth pressuring him, he would have escaped long ago like Wyman did. Bill saw the writing on the wall. Believe me, I've tried to remain a fan, but having to sit through the BTB album and then the lackluster rehash that was the BTB tour, then the 'Stripped' album and tour and, the winner in the 'cash in' department (chuh-ching), the 'Forty Licks' album (with it's edited versions of songs) and tour. A tour backing up a greatest hits album. Disgusting! I just can't do it anymore. Now the Stones are on tour again, and they've become thier own scalpers. $100 a seat and $1500.00 for 'fan packages' to different cities sold through the Stones own website. I guess Jagger saw the scalpers making boat loads of cash and said to himself, \\"Why let them rob our fans when we can do it.\\" Not me, kids. Retirement is the answer. It's too painful to watch Sympathy for the Devil done badly again and again and again. The new album won't be out until after the tour starts. So what's that tell you? You know what that tells me? Bridges to Babylon 2. Another piece of garbage for you, the fan. It's too bad that the Stones have become victims of thier own hype. Remember when you went to a Stones concert and it was just the Stones playing? Now there are more non-Stones on the stage than Stones, and they're horrible. Bernard Fowler? This guy must have pictures of Jagger in compromising positions because he is just awful. I'd like to pour concrete in his mouth while he's singing. The worst. And he's the best out of all of them. It's sad. But I digress. How many times can you sell the same song? At the very least they could have put the last song not on any official Stones cd, 'Through the Lonely Nights', on this........ thing. At least that would have made it worth buying. Save your money. The Stones were great, but it's over. it has been for a long time.t out of all of them. It's sad. But I digress. How many times can you sell the same song?

1579124585|5.0|With the exception of The Electric Kool Aid Acid Test, no story is a better match for Wolfe's hyperbolic, stream of consciousness writing style than The Right Stuff.<br /><br />\\"the Honorable Mrs Squirming Hatch Blower!\\"--'nuff said.
0790731479|5.0|The most apt adjective to describe this film is \\"weird\\". On secend thought, \\"insane\\" comes to mind as well. It is so completely off the wall that it is difficult to describe but that does not stop it from being lots of fun. <br /> <br />The story is about a young married couple that was recently killed in a car accident. They find that they are stuck in their home and unable to leave. Just as they are getting used to their new situation, a family from New York moves in. The father just wants to \\"get away from it all\\". The mother is horrified that she is now stuck in the sticks away from the \\"art scene\\". Her solution is to bring her live-in interior decorator. And then there is the daughter, a teenager into the gothic and macabre. The dead couple does not like the newcomers and wants them out of their house. That's why they call in Betelgeuse, the \\"bio-exocrcist\\" to get rid of the living. <br /> <br />The antics of everyone in this film are hilarious to watch. Michael Keeton in the title role is especially fun. He seems to have a chemistry with Tim Burton that lets them come up with some pretty bizzare gags that work.  <br /> <br />The entire film is a feast of sight gags, one liners, snappy comebacks and unexpected happenings that are so outrageous that you cannot help but laugh. There is nothing spooky or scary about it; it is pure comedy. <br /> <br />This one is worth watching time and time again. It is a masterpiece of dark comedy.
B000099T2L|5.0|Beyonce's \\"Dangerously in Love\\" is the R&B album for the new millenium. Blending elements of hip-hop, pop, blues, and gospel, Beyonce delivers a truly awesome album that Destiny's Child fans as well as a more mature listening audience will tap into. This is how I feel each song stacks up: <br /> <br />Crazy in Love - The R&B single of the new millenium, fuses new hip-hop and old R&B into one of the best dance tracks in years. 10/10 <br /> <br />Naughty Girl - Great dance song, one of the top dance songs of 2004. 10/10 <br /> <br />Baby Boy - Yet again, another great dance song with a great foreign sound. 9/10 <br /> <br />Hip Hop Star - This song is just ok for me. 7/10 <br /> <br />Be with You - Beyonce sounds good slowing it down. 8/10 <br /> <br />Me, Myself and I - Great sexy mid-tempo song. 9/10 <br /> <br />Yes - This song is a bit generic, a little bland. This is the beginning of the ballad-heavy 2nd half of the album. 6/10 <br /> <br />Signs - Good lyrics, and a good slow song. 7/10 <br /> <br />Speechless - Beyonce does a great job on this slow song. 8/10 <br /> <br />That's How You Like It - A bit faster than most songs on the 2nd half of the album, pretty good but not her best. 8/10 <br /> <br />The Closer I Get to You - An above-average ballad due to the talents of Beyonce & Vandross. 8/10 <br /> <br />Dangerously in Love 2 - Great ballad with amazing vocals. Beyonce's big note toward the end is WOW. 10/10 <br /> <br />Beyonce Interlude <br /> <br />Gift from Virgo - Not a bad song, but gets tiring because of how many ballads are before it. 7/10 <br /> <br />Daddy - A sweet song with sweet vocals about Beyonce's dad. 8/10 <br /> <br />Song for song, this album is actually BETTER than my scores indicate, but the over-saturation of ballads toward the end made some of the tracks less enjoyable than they could have been. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|I may never stop laughing. I know it's impolite to laugh at cripples, but some of these whacked out Christianity-haters are too much!  It is obvious that they have a problem with Christianity and the attention it has received because of this movie, far more than with the movie itself.  One reviewer hysterically complained that the violence in this movie isn't \\"fun.\\"  Well, he got THAT right, at least.  It is an extremely difficult movie to watch.  The violence is wrenching and unrelenting.      I think that for viewers of faith, it will be very difficult to separate that faith from the experience this movie provides--which is exactly what the filmmaker intended.  Is this a great movie?  I don't know.  Is this a powerful experience?  Yes, definitely.  I have never been as alarmed or moved by any movie I have seen--and I've seen LOTS.    To call the plot \\"puny\\" is more of a projection than an evaluation.  I mean, the Crucifixion is ONLY one of the greatest, most important stories EVER told--a fact that is independent of faith. What story has had as great an influence on so many people over the last 2 thousand years? (What? Lord of the Rings, you say?  BWAHAHAHAHA!)  And get real, this is a passion play, not a whodunit! Its ONLY intended purpose is to depict Christ's passion, which it does, with harrowing vividness.  And except for the meandering androgynous Satan, the movie sticks to the Gospel stories.    Gibson elicits wonderful performances from his actors.  It's a slick production.  But it's not the kind of movie you walk out of saying, \\"Wow, I REALLY loved that!\\"  It is to unsettling, too...incriminating.  You leave the theater chilled with a sense of your own culpability.  For that reason alone I don't know that I'll ever watch it again; I typically watch my favorite movies more than once, and regularly over the years.  This one, though, is painful to sit through.
B0007TKNL0|4.0|Based upon the French novel \\"Le Fantme de L'Opra\\" by author Gaston Leroux (1868-1927), the highly successful Broadway musical writer/composer Andrew Lloyd Webber transformed the novel into the highly successful musical \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" in 1988.  Other well-known Broadway musicals that he has composed include \\"Cats\\" (1983), \\"Evita\\" (1980), \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" (1972) and \\"Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat\\" (1982).  Of these, both \\"Jesus Christ Superstar\\" and \\"Evita\\" were adapted to big screen films in 1973 and 1996 respectively.  In 2004, Andrew Lloyd Weber took it upon himself to produce the film adaptation of his masterful live musical \\"The Phantom of Opera\\".  With elaborate costumes and the same appealing music, the film earned three Oscar nominations for \\"Best Art Direction\\", \\"Best Cinematography\\" and \\"Best Original Song\\". <br /> <br />Directed by Joel Schumacher (who co-wrote the screenplay with Weber), the film version of \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" uses a film technique that was first used in the 1939 film \\"The Wizard of Oz\\": the film begins in the black-and-white early twentieth century present (present for the film), then uses color to show the events of the past at the ill-fated Parisian opera house.  A young, disfigured boy (Chris Overton) had been rescued from a travelling carnival by a girl (Laura Hounsom) who worked and lived in a Parisian opera house. She hides the boy in the opera house where they each grow into adulthood, but unlike her, the grown-up Madame Giry (Miranda Richardson), he remained isolated from the rest of society.  Though very intelligent, his fears of how people will view his facial disfigurement forces him to become the secretive \\"phantom\\" (Gerard Butler) of the opera.  Living in the opera house encouraged a strong love of music and performance within him.  Unfortunately, he became obsessed with the notion that the opera house was his personal possession and frightened its owners (Ciarn Hinds as \\"Firmin\\" and Simon Callow as \\"Andre\\") to do his bidding.  This included forcing them to use the lesser-known performer Christine (Emmy Rossum) in place of the well-known, but egocentric diva Carlotta (Minnie Driver).  The phantom loved Christine, but she also had another suitor in Raoul (Patrick Wilson). <br /> <br />With its elaborate sets, costumes and cinematography, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" is indeed visually impressive.  Musically, the film suffers in part due to the casting of Gerard Butler whose singing is often flat and periodically struggles.  Also, as a character, the film suffers because Gerard Butler as the phantom should appear at least as old as Madame Giri (who is probably around age 50), but instead appears to be in his thirties.  This was done no doubt to make him appear more appealing to Christine (who is about 20), but in reality, he should appear to be about 25 to 30 years older than her, not 15 years.  As a live musical with impressive, live, three-dimensional special effects to dazzle audiences, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" was quite the experience; but as a two-dimensional film, the impact of those same special effects is diminished.  Consequently, with an estimated budget of $60-million, it is not surprising that the film grossed somewhat less than that in U.S. theaters at just over $51-million after showing for nearly 6 months.  As a film, \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" demonstrates that a live show cannot always be adapted well to film.  My overall rating for the film is 3.5 out of 5 stars, rounded to 4 stars.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|Yes, this is a traditional System of a Down album (well, as traditional as a band like SOAD can get, I suppose), but it's not their best.  Chances are, if you've liked their last two releases, you will like this one just as much if not more. <br /> <br />Now, down to what bothers me about this album.  I still stand by my belief that their first album (self titled) was by far thier best work.  Toxicity was definetly a respectable offering as well, but that is where the trend began.  Unfortunately, we have heard more and more of Daron Malakian's work with each progressive release.  On their first release, Mr. Malakian stuck to what he does best: Playing guitar and providing the occasional backing vocals.  On Toxcitiy we heard more of Mr. Malakian's voice than the previous release, and even more on Steal This Album (though this release barely counts since it is a conglomeration of B-sides and such that were previously unreleased and collected over the course of thier first two albums).  With Mesmerize we experience the apex of this particular trend.  The problem here, I believe, is that Mr. Malakian wishes the band was called \\"Daron Malakian\\" rather than System of a Down.  No more do we get to experience the beautiful yet chilling soliloquies sung by Serj Tankian (Spiders, for example).  Now we hear Serj accompanied by Mr. Malakian and his rather annoying squeal of a voice more often than not.  Serj has an absolutely wonderful voice and should continue to be the lead singer rather than a co-lead.  Malakian's incredible ego is begginning to mar the band in a way he will never know due to the large number of albums that tend to sell.  This combined with the somewhat more streamlined sound that can be heard mostly in the choruses of this album make it slightly less enjoyable than the previous two.  Unfortunately, the more copies that sell, the more these trends will continue.   <br /> <br />Besides these two gripes, the album is a rather solid performance , and I recommend it to any who enjoy prevoius SOAD albums.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|never listened to Ryan Adams before this cd.  never heard of Gold or the NY song (till getting Cold Roses then digging deeper)--been off the radio for a while now.  simply came across his web site kinda on a fluke and 'let it ride' started to play.  i don't know why, but it put its hooks in me then and hasn't let go.  love the diversity of the album--don't care if all songs are in the same genre or not--just give me great songs!  Cold Roses does.  Over and over.  Thanks Ryan.  You too Cardinals.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|Parker and Stone will someday be acknowledged as two of the finest social critics this country has ever possessed. They rank alongside Hunter Thompson and probably even Mencken with their brilliance and justifiable curse-on-all-houses attitude. As far as the current \\"crisis\\" goes I'd stick this film with the incredible 9/11 front page The Onion did a few years back. That should have gotten a Pulitzer. Stuff like this movie makes one realize that the Real America, the America that's half lovable pirate and half terrible angel, the cranky, iconoclastic down-to-Earth America that tells both the religious right and the politically correct left to go to hell, is alive and well. This is the America that should serve as the shining example to the rest of the world. This is one of the most genuinely patriotic movies I've ever seen. I salute it. <br /> <br />Only Parker and Stone would make everyone in this situation look like an imbecile, from Michael Moore, to any hyper-patriotic opportunist country singer, to nitwit Hollywood stars, to...well, nobody's left out except, astonishingly, the White House. Maybe they saw that as too cheap and easy. They consistently point out that the problem with the United States of America isn't the Left or the Right, it's both--a whole lot of really stupid people of all stripes. For those who think they take a traditional kind of lefty stand on some things pay close attention. Team America trashes Paris icons but the suitcase nuke they prevent going off would've killed a hell of a lot more puppets. Another puppet casually blows everyone away with a chain gun in a coffee house except the staff and band. Don't make any of this movie too easy for yourself. They're P.O.ed about some of the response to 9/11 but, like me, I think they're extremely P.O.ed about 9/11. <br /> <br />As a marionette film this is great too (as symbolism it's astounding!). They did a fantastic job with the sets, the miniatures, and so on. This'll rank as one of the all-time classics in that arena. Again, that's typical of these insanely multi-talented guys. The songs weren't as awsome as in the South Park Movie (one of the best movie musicals since The Sound of Music or West Side Story) but this wasn't really presented as the musical that the earlier film certainly was. <br /> <br />I really, really, enjoyed seeing Michael Moore blow himself up. For that alone, thank you Trey Parker and Matt Stone!
B000009ED0|1.0|Hello, my name is Eggplant, and I was once a Kid Rock fan. It has been four years, eleven months, and eleven days since I last listened to this \\"album\\", and it has been four years, seven months, and fourteen days since I sold it on ebay. I admit, when I first got the CD, I was so excited about the gesture on the CD itself! I loved Kid Rock's immature bleatings about his ego, until one day, something happened... <br /> <br />I turned fourteen. <br /> <br />Thankfully, I grew up and out of the Kid-Rock-and-Limp-Bizkit-in-the-CD-Walkman-baggy-jeans-and-wallet-chain-wearing-skater-wannabe phase, and discovered bands with talent, like Pantera, Slayer, Fear Factory, et cetera. I realized that this album is just damn stupid, and not worth having, listening to, or even being anywhere near. Okay, I admit \\"Only God Knows Why\\" is actually okay, and might justify the one star Amazon forces me to give it, but otherwise... geez, someone's got some insecurity issues! (And not just me!) Anyway, Kid Rock is thankfully pretty much done, and we can put this fad in the past and move on. But I sometimes shudder over what might be over the horizon... <br /> <br />\\"Devil Without A Cause?\\" If a cause requires talent, than yeah, Kid Rock is indeed without a cause.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Although this is extremely different from their past efforts, don't think for a minute that it's bad.  The only downfall in my honest opinion is the run time for this album.  It's the shortest System album to date, but the overall replay value and intensity on the majority of the tracks certainly makes up for it in every way.  For as long as you've got an open mind for the new sound, you should enjoy it. <br /> <br />Now then, what's different you might ask?  For starters, I personally find the guitar much more technical and heavier than anything I've heard from them before.  Although you have some slower tracks here and there, you'll also find a lot of thrashy riffs this time around.  This is especially evident in Revenga, which is a perfect example of how well they've matured and changed since Toxicity. <br /> <br />You'll also notice an excellent and beautiful acoustic intro, titled Soldier Side.  Although it lasts for only about a minute or so, you're immediately shown the new System of a Down.  As soon as it's done, you're pulled into the excellent single BYOB, which I'm sure the majority of you are already aware of. <br /> <br />More experimental tracks come into the scene later in the album with Old School Hollywood and Lost in Hollywood.  Old School Hollywood basically revolves around a techno groove and shows off some of Serj's keyboarding skills in true action.  Lost in Hollywood, the closer on the album, turns out to be the longest track clocking in at over 5 minutes.  While this may be my least favorite track, it's certainly a nice trip nonetheless.  Quite a slow track compared to the fast paced album you get before hand. <br /> <br />As for the fast paced songs, this album is full of them.  Question begins with a beautiful acoustic intro and suddenly picks of the pace, finishing off with trashy riffs and shouting from Serj; probably my favorite track.  Sad Statue, the next track, shows how well System has matured lyrically.  Another great song that deserves a quick mention is Cigaro.  Wacky lyrics and excellent guitar work, many people remember this as the first realeased song from the CD. <br /> <br />In closing, this honestly gets better with each listen.  In my opinion, they've matured musically just as much as they have lyrically.  I find it unfortunate that many people won't be able to accept the new changes, but I hope that this review has helped you somewhat in making a decision on whether or not to check it out.  Listen to it with an open mind, and you'll hopefully enjoy.
0201721481|4.0|I found quite a few typos on my first reading.<br /><br />Dear authors, please post an errata!
B000005IU2|3.0|This is the parental advisory I'd stick on this album, and yet there doesn't sound to be any explicit language on this album, but it's chockfull of a sound that will bring out the darker side of you. Depending on how much you allow yourself to be raptured up into this sound will determine if you will actually commit date rape, or not. I know from my personal standpoint I will say that I would've had I listened to a particular song on this album with all of it's aggression on here. \\"L.A. Blues\\" would've been the song where I would scare a woman enough into commiting date rape where it's nothing but a collage of violent drum solos, and smashing of amps, and Iggy just wailing his heart out. However, I stayed on the lunatic fringe of things, and listened to \\"Out In The Street\\", and \\"Dirt\\". It gave me a numbness to keep me tough for when a girl, or a woman rejected me, and this wasn't just for sex either. The hard crunching guitars were almost like taking a good dose of heroin. Let's face it guitars themselves aren't the heroin, but anyone with an axe to grind can turn the sound from thier guitar into a drug that can be almost as wicked as heroin. In this day and age, and come to think of it probably back in 1970 as well we all have to repress our feelings, and not cry, but to be stoic and tough. I myself can't do that, so I shoot up with \\"Funhouse\\", and now I can deal with that. Don't let that fool you guys; the minute you hear that first laugh from a girl, or a woman you'll get angry and aggressive thoughts to where you fantasize about doing that girl some good clean harm in your eyes. This is one of the most dangerous albums to possess along with the first album from \\"Body Count\\", and for that matter anything from Marilyn Manson. If you have tendencies to want to commit date rape, or you feel that your ego has been raked over the hot coals by a girl, or a woman make sure you call someone who you can trust that will help you through the rejection, and not turn to thisalbum. Don't do what I did, and tried to shoulder it alone. I've been rejected many a time, and I just turned on to this album, and others like it, and hardened my heart, and filled my mind to where everything revolved around sex, and just gave a dark report about everything in the world. It wasn't the high that I thought would snap me out of my doldrums it just numbed them for awhile. Otherwise it's a rather interesting work of anger.
B0007OCG56|3.0|I saw this movie last night. It was a chick flick.His wife was terrible and cheated on him to. The Grandma did a good performance. I had no problem with 50 First Dates and The Wedding Singer but this is not there quality. The movie was really about a Spanish lady who was hired as a work hand. She did a great performance. As did Adam Sandler I wish they would give Adam credit he can do some non comedy movies. He did this along with Punch Drunk Love and 50 First Dates were not typical Sandler Movies. I will do a little rating of the movies <br /> <br />Sandler-10 out of 10 <br />His Wife-2 out of 10 <br />Her Mom-8 out of 10 <br />Bernice-4 out of 10 <br />Flora-10 out of 10 <br />Her Daughter-3 out of 10 <br />Story-7 out of 10 <br />Entertainment-2 out of 10 <br />Directing-9 out of 10 <br />Acting-7 out of 10
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|When Systems single B.Y.O.B. (Bring your own bombs) hit the radio I was excited about the new album.  The album delievers great songs not only on politics but on other issues as well.  The cd is loaded with listening enjoyment with the songs of radio/video, violent pornography, B.Y.O.B. Question, and for those ATWA and Roulette fans the cd will not dissapoint you with mellow tracks like Soldier Side and Lost in Hollywood.  Sytem of a down has topped Steal this Album but has not surpassed Toxicity.  The cd does contain material not suitable for children, but is more directed at teens and young adults.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|If you're buying this expecting to hear \\"Toxicity Pt.2\\" don't even bother. This disc is MUCH different from System's first two albums. It's much more melodic and clean vocal harmonies are ALL OVER this disc. If you love all of System's releases so far, definitely get this. Basically I consider \\"System of a Down\\" and \\"Toxicity\\" as their old sound. \\"Steal this Album!\\", although b-sides, was a bridge moving towards the sound you hear on \\"Mesmerize.\\" <br /> <br />Each song is unique and stands out for its own reasons and the lyrics are top notch SOAD quality as always. The band's points of view can be seen by some as highly offensive, but then seen by others as undoubtedly correct. As always, many of the lyrics are not straightforward about their meanings. You'll have to somewhat \\"read between the lines\\" to understand the meanings of the some of the song. E.g., \\"Cigaro\\" is not really about penis envy. <br /> <br />Buy this record!
0792838068|1.0|This had to be the most depressing movie I ever saw.  Yet, at the same time, I did not care about any of the characters (there was no character development) ... there was not much depth to the story line.  The characters were flat, boring, dull, and uninteresting; I did not feel for any of them.  This was a pointless movie.
0679805273|5.0|This book has been an inspiration for me. It teaches it's reader about the ups and downs of life, the confusion that comes with growing up, and demonstrates the ability we have to choose the best path to reach our goals.  It shows us that we won't always choose the right path right away, and that sometimes, life can become a little scary. It reminds us that there will be stuggles in life, things won't always be perfect, but thats okay. It tells us that this is what life is all about. That it's okay to be a little scared sometimes. It teaches the reader, that when life gets tough, not to dwell in \\"the waiting place,\\" but to face your fears, and \\"remember that life's a Great Balancing Act.\\"<br /><br />I buy at least five copies of this book every christmas, and I always find someone that could use it's positive message about life. All ages can relate to it, and all ages can learn from it. I know I have.

B0002IU988|1.0|That is what I think of this album.  I'm sick of these \\"mega-bands\\" forming up, switching band members and such.  I loved Creed before this tragedy.  Creed may sound the same if you take away this blonde swinger's voice, but that's only because the only thing missing is Scott Stapp's voice.  Screw this album up the ass.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|System of a Down has returned to the genre jumping greatness.  The new album is WAY better than the recent Toxicity and Steal this Album. Any of the original fans from before MTV and radio play should pick this up. Back to the Mr. Bungle influenced stuff. Really crazy vocals and very chopped up music. It may even be better than the first album, maybe. Any fans of experimental music should check this out. Every one giving a bad review is insane and obviously know nothing about music. There is definatly a ton of fast complex guitars and everything else.  Finally, I hope all you radio pop music fans hate it.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|This was a good effort but did not meat the previous albums System has made. After two listens now I feel sick. There are some very notable mentions on this CD however though, BYOB, Cigaro, Violent Pronography, and Lost in Hollywood. The rest seem to just be filler, not really trying to grab your attention. This would have been a great CD if they added in maybe 20 more minutes of filler, that way I have some more substance, but it's only around 36 minutes, and for the quaility you get with those 36 minutes, it doesn't seem worth it. Check out Toxicity and Steal This Album for true System goodness.
B0001AP12G|2.0|I've been hearing this man hyped over and over again so I decided to get this album. It's definitely got some catchy hooks and decent subject material, but overall Kanye is a terrible lyricist. His lyrics are very simple and his flow is mediocre. This album will sell millions not because Kanye is a supreme lyricist, but because it's catchy. I'm not saying that I don't dig it, it's just fluff with good beats, catchy hooks, and sub-par rhymes. This is album is what I like to call \\"hip-pop.\\" If you're a real hip-hop fan who digs tight lyrics, then stick to guys like Nas, Blackalicious, Mos Def, Sage Franics, Planet Asia, etc.
B0000CDLA7|1.0|YES, THIS WAS WRITTEN IN 3 WEEKS- WHAT A JOKE- STREAM OF CON IS ONLY DECENT SONG HERE- THE VOCALS ARE HORRID- JORDAN IS BARELY HEARD- PORTNOY IS A MORON, AND PETRUCCI PLAYS TOO FAST- WITH NO SOUL. JOKE PROG
B000001FTA|5.0|Here's another collection of fantastic songs that you'll never hear on your local classic rock station due to too much time spent on Led Zeppelin and The Eagles.  Bad Reputation is one of four Thin Lizzy cds that are considered the band's best work, number three to be exact.  From what I've read, Dancing In The Moonlight was a minor hit from this album, but most likely a hit everywhere but America.  Why the songs Bad Reputaion and Opium Trail weren't smash hits is a total mystery we'll probably never figure out.  If you're familiar with, and like Jailbreak or Johnny The Fox, then I can guarantee Bad Reputation will not disappoint.  If you're unfamiliar with this band/album altogether, then I can talk till I'm blue in the face, but in the end you're just gonna have to buy it to see what the big deal is.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|this album is pure junk- what a joke- should be in the comedy section- i bought it, and sold it right away- get their 1st c -- not this puke
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|First off..i might be in the minority, but i definately like this cd more than Toxicity. Not better than their S/T cause that cd is just pure musical bliss. Anyways..they're are some very good songs on here like B.Y.O.B, Revenga, Radio/Video (my fav), Violent Pornography and Sad Statue. I like more songs on this cd than on Toxicity. I would like for Daron..to ..actually do what hes suppose to do..and thats do BACKUP vocals..Serj's voice is a hell of alot better. Please..Daron..back off and let Serj do mostly..if not all the vocals.
B000002UVZ|4.0|I own all their albums up through \\"Hi-Fi\\", and find this to be as good as anything else from the IRS years. Everything from \\"Murmur\\" to \\"Document\\" is really strong, and this 4th album of their first five is no exception. The only real hit here is \\"Fall On Me\\", but who hasn't heard \\"Superman\\" also? Other personal favorites are \\"The Flowers Of Guatemala\\", \\"What If We Give It Away?\\", and \\"Begin The Begin\\" is a great way to....begin. I'd hesitate to call this an essential album of theirs, but any fan of their mid-80's work should dig it.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|Wow, I ran out as soon as I got out of school and bought this album at the local Best Buy, I was not dissapointed.  The fact that it was short doesn't bother me, it's part of a 2 album double album sort of like what Nelly did I guess.  If you are a SOAD fan, forget everything you know.  This is completely different than anything they have done.  Daron Malakian has a much bigger spot on this CD also, he has written at least 2 of the songs and sings lead vocals on them both, and he does sound very good.  BYOB and Cigaro, the two that were released early are not the best ones, although BYOB is in the group with the best songs including Revenga (sooo awsome), Violent Pornography (maybe their most explicit song ever), and Lost in Hollywood.  This album will stay with you, but don't expect Toxicity until Hypnotize comes out in the fall.  It's gonna be awsome!  ;) <br /> <br />One thing I didn't get was the packaging.  It seems like something SOAD would do to release a digipack that is backwards, but the PA sticker and the actual title on the front were just a sticker on the actual rapping.  I didn't understand that, but I do like the non glossy textured digipack, it looks great.
B000000OSG|4.0|I must admit, I really don't like it when any band releases two albums at once, especially a part 1 and part 2. I also am one of many who believe an excellent album could have been done combinding the best of the two. But, this is what we got. Despite both albums having a few filler tracks, they're still pretty good. I find \\"Use Your Illusion II\\" very good, and is the one I would keep of the pair. It's 75 minutes of 14 songs including \\"Civil War\\", \\"Yesterdays\\", and \\"You Could Be Mine\\", as heard in the \\"T2\\" movie. Plus there's the cover of \\"Knockin' On Heavens Door\\", which I like way more than \\"Live And Let Die\\", and the alternate \\"Don't Cry\\", which is only lyrically different than the original. Finally, this is a must for \\"Estranged\\", one of their epic tracks, which is amazing and moving. The rest here is good as well, and the only songs I wish this also had was \\"The Garden\\" and \\"November Rain\\". No biggie. Hey, at this point I'd even welcome a \\"Use Your Illusion III\\".
B0007Y08IS|5.0|This is some of the finest satirical genius ever to grace the silver screen.  It all culminates in one of the funniest and most appropriate speeches ever given.
B000002KDO|5.0|Sabbath keeps things moving with yet another Classic Metal album, this time around their sound is even heavier and their lyrics even Darker. Tony Iommi steals the show with his lumbering, giant guitar riffs. Heres what I think of the songs.    1.Sweet Leaf (5/5)-Awesome riff, classic song, I love you Sweet Leaf    2.After Forever (5/5)-Another crushing riff by Tony  3.Embryo (3/5)- a classical styled acoustic instrumental, its ok  4.Children Of The Grave (5/5)-The most evil song ive ever heard, but the song is actually about stopping hate in the world  5.Orchid (4/5)-another classical styled acoustic instrumental, great song  6.Lord Of This World (4/5)-a good song, sounds too much like Into The Void though  7.Solitude (4.5/5)-quiet but eerie sorta folk like song  8.Into The Void (5/5)-Great opening riff, grest main riff, ozzy sounds awesome on this song    If you like heavy metal, or hard rock buy this album.    If you like this album youll probably also like  Ozzy Osbourne-Diary Of A Madman  Soundgarden-Badmotorfinger  Dio-The Last In Line
B000001DTM|5.0|This album is simply transcendent.  As good as U2 is, to say that this album is their best does not even do it justice.  This album can take on so many personal meanings, and even after hundreds of listenings, it does not lose any of its power. <br /> <br />First and foremost, this is not a brisk, light album, which is why you must get past Mysterious Ways, good song as it is, when you delve into the album.  As usual with U2, the biggest single of the album is quite unrepresentative of the rest of the album.  (Was Pride representative of The Unforgettable Fire?)  Achtung Baby is dark, moody, and broken, and the beautiful sonical layers created by the band are merely a cover for the tortured soul at the heart of it.   <br /> <br />They say strife and personal problems lead to the best music, and that was certainly true in this case.  The band almost broke up before the recording of this album, unsure of where they should take their new sound.  And it's a common fact that the Edge's break-up was the inspiration for many of the shattered lyrics that make up the core of the album.  <br /> <br />Zoo Station is deliciously nasty and Even Better Than the Real Thing sounds flawless.  On Until the End of the World and The Fly, the disturbing guitar coming from the Edge are the perfect fit for the unsettling lyrics; you'll have to hear this to understand.  Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses and Ultraviolet are lyrical masterpieces that underscore the uncertainty of lost love, while Love is Blidness ends the album on a disturbing note; there is no ambivalence of the feelings towards lost love here.  <br /> <br />Yet all of these songs are merely second class when compared to Acrobat, So Cruel, and One, all among U2's five or ten best songs.  To try to describe One at all would be to taint it; all I'll say is that Bono's current idea of using it as a political vehicle is hideously inaccurate.  Just like the rest of Baby, it is an intensely personal song.  <br /> <br />This albumis so good because it sounded like nothing U2 had recorded when it came out; not only did U2 create the best album of their lives in 1991, they reinvented their sound and discovered a much more mature, subtle, and inventive group.  Achtung Baby may overwhelm you at first, but it will stun you with its genius.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|This album is a great follow up to the sucess of Songs In A Minor, all of the tracks are different from Alicia's first album, but not so different that it feels like a different artist altogether. <br /> <br />The tracks on here feature some great RnB styles (eg Karma), and other tracks slow down a bit (eg If I Aint Got You). <br /> <br />The whole CD is great, and I would recomend it anyone and everyone!!
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I love system of a down and believe me I like this album and it is way better then what is coming out now in days but I wish that daron would stick to guitar because I like serj's voice so much better.  This is alot softer then there previous release's but I would buy it again.  If you dont have there self titled album yet what are you waiting!!!!
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Because that \\"Lies from the tablecloth\\" song (BYOB?) is one of the worst songs ever written, ever... In the past years, its hard to think of a worse song in the world thats been written, everything about the song is horrible
0790731002|1.0|Every once in a while, this comes on cable, or I pull the VHS out, and say, \\"Maybe I was wrong before.\\" <br /> <br />Each time, I get PAINFULLY bored sooner. <br /> <br />It is a slow, boring, turgid, flaccid mess. The actors all seem like they are reading their parts independently of anyone else... Batman smiles!?!?!?... Jim Carrey is annoying... and Chris O'Donnel needs to be smacked like the... Oh, never mind. <br /> <br />What's sad is there is a really interesting story in Harvey Dent, the character who is scarred and is half good/half evil, and the conflicts he goes through as metaphor for Bruce/Batman, and the conflict between vigilantism and justice. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Joel Schumacher doesn't explore that. <br /> <br />Each scene is strikingly beautiful to look at. A clever, colorful, imaginative visual tone poem. <br /> <br />But the script is weak, the acting is horrific, and the action is just. Yawn. Inducing... zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz....... <br /> <br />Worse than the Clooney version - it is so bad, it's campy fun! This is just painful. <br /> <br />Say what you will about Burton's two Batman flicks, they were at least engaging!
B0000683WG|5.0|this is it. the best marc bolan gave to the world. better than electric warrior on a melodic basis. he was riding so high with this album. one of my top 10 favorites
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Well, System Of A Down is back with a fourth album (the first of two this year) and at first I have to admit I was rather dissapointed by what I was presented.  I had to take another listen to it and the more I listened, the more things I found that I liked.  It is indeed a new sound for System.  It is even a new guitar tuning (Only down a half tone with drop-d as opposed to the usual whole tone down-tuning with drop-d for all you guitar players out there).  Moving along, stand out tracks include B.Y.O.B., the single, Radio/Video and This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song, an erratic little tune which is reminiscent of their first self-titled album.  It is a good blend of old and new while being a progression all together.  The album also shows a softer side of System.  The end track Lost In Hollywood is fantastic with great harmonized vocals and some interesting acoustic guitar work.  The intro, Soldier Side is haunting, and while short makes for an amazing introduction to the new album.  Listeners beware, if you aren't a fan of Daron's voice (the guitar player), he does a lot more singing on this album than any of the others (he also played bass on all but three tracks during recording, which seems odd to me when you have a perfectly good bass player in Shavo).  I myself enjoy the combination of Serj and Daron's voices.  They accompany eachother well.  The album itself is short, clocking in at around 38 minutes or so I believe, which is short for a System album, but hopefully Hypnotize will balance things out.  So to sum this up, if at first you don't like the album, give it another listen and you may wind up enjoying it as much as I do.  Can't wait for Hypnotize to hit the shelves so I can hear how they plan to follow up their current piece of art.
B000005S0E|2.0|\\"The Top\\" is almost difficult to listen to, because if one were in the mood to listen to The Cure, one could make a better choice with any of the band's other albums (besides, perhaps, \\"Wild Mood Swings\\").  Although I feel that the two proceeding albums, \\"Pornography\\" and \\"Japanese Whispers\\" were not great albums (for the opposite reasons), they are still significantly better that \\"The Top.\\"  It's not all bad.  The best song (and probably The Cure's best \\"silly\\" song) is \\"Caterpillar\\" with those curious toy instruments.  \\"Wailing Wall\\" and \\"Empty World\\" are not bad, but the rest of the album is truly forgettable. <br /> <br />According to what I've read from other reviewers, Robert Smith was going through difficult times when he made this album, and had alot of distractions.  I get the feeling that Smith has written his best songs when he's somewhat miserable, but whatever he was feeling when he wrote most the songs for this album was obviously not very conducive to songwriting.  Of course, over the next three releases, Smith and his band would bounce back with \\"Head on the Door,\\" hit a homerun with \\"Kiss Me Kiss Me Kiss Me,\\" and knock it out of the stratosphere with \\"Disintegration.\\"
0790734850|5.0|As someone who lives in LA, it was a flash to the past with this film. I can not recommend this film too much! Some films just seem to have the magic touch, where everything seems to push it toward excellence. The writing , photography, location selection, musical score, direction, the selection of the cast,the actors dedication in this film are top drawer. This film just shows what Hollywood could do but usually does'nt. <br />This film I believe will stand the test of time as one of the great classics of film.
B0000640VO|5.0|firstly, is it just me or is Daniel. J. Hamlow's review of Amelie resemble Mario's review of amelie saying about the star of chocolat???..personally i prefer Marios! Amelie is a movie that pulls on your heartstrings,plays with your emotionjs and leavers you with a feeling oif happiness and pride. Like mario, said the lead actress does everything right! she is so cute and perfect for the lead of Amelie Poulan, who takes us on a journey of love, revenge and taking a deep look at our lives and souls...one of the best movies ive ever seen..whats next Jean-pierre-jeunet?????
B0007Y4TVU|2.0|I was expecting big things from System of a Down when I heard the singles B.Y.O.B. and Cigaro on the radio, and bought this album the day it came out.  Needless to say, I was thoroughly disappointed with what I heard.   <br />    While creative in lyrical content and up to their normal technical par, this release is much softer than their prior releases.  You would be hard pressed to find one of their characteristic Serj screams, which have instead been replaced by melodic verses from both Serj and Daron.  I knew that after hearing B.Y.O.B. that this release would be softer, but I never expected it to be to the extent that it is on this album.  While in some cases, softening the music serves to further a bands development, in this instance it merely takes away from the band's characteristic intensity and aggression that was a staple in their earlier releases and part of the reason they were so great. <br />    I understand it is difficult to mature as musicians and still please your diehard fan base, but this release is no where near the self-titled album, and a far cry from Toxicity.  If this is your first encounter with SOAD and you want to experience the band at their very best, then check out the self-titled album first and make your own judgements. <br />   <br />     <br />
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|It's been almost three years since SOAD released an album and they are making up for it with what will be two completely excellent cds, Mezmerize and the forthcoming companion piece Hypnotize.      Spastic, frenetic, insane, rapidly changing tempos, all of these words can describe SOAD at their best.  I can't think of another band out there right now doing the same things.  Nor can I think of a band that can go from a screaming rock directly to a polka.  SOAD does this and pulls it off, creating original music that is enjoyable to listen to.  Where most music is static, songs like the single BYOB and basically every song on this cd are constantly changing.  They go from screaming fits, gutteral cries, to catchy refrains and yes even polka.  But before you get comfortable with whatever sound they are giving you, they switch it up.  This is music to listen to, dynamic, changing, exciting.      Whether they are critiquing the current war (\\"Why don't presidents fight their wars/why do they always send the poor?\\") to Hollywood in the songs Old School Hollywood and Lost in Hollywood where they sing about Hollywood eating people up and spitting them back out, they are unapologetically brazen.  Unlike some bands that have a political eye but use it only as a theme and don't directly discuss it, SOAD is brave enough to paint the picture of whatever problems they see.  Also, unlike some music, their songs never feel bogged down by their political persuasion.      On some of their previous albums, there have been songs that seemed to not be as focused as I would like.  That is no longer the case on Mezmerize.  Each song is more driven and remind me of the excellence found on their previous cds, like Aerials, Toxicity, Chop Suey, Sugar etc.  Truth be told, I think Toxicity has some better songs like the aforementioned Chop Suey, Aerials etc than Mezmerize.  BUT overall I enjoyed Mezmerize better.  As a whole album, I think it's better.  Individually, I enjoyed some of the earlier songs more.    In a move that is bitter sweet, the cd is only about 35 minutes long.  What that means is that there really aren't any filler songs.  Each song is a standout and unique in their own way.  It's a cd you should listen front to back and not skip songs.  For the entire 35 minutes your senses will be assaulted by some of the best songs I have heard in a long time.  The downside to it being only 35 minutes is of course it leaves you wanting more.  More of the originality, more of the crazy lyrics that really do make sense if you just think about them, more of the spastic and frenetic speeds and constantly changing time signatures.  It is excellent.      Like I said earlier, overall it's their best so far.  And if you, like me, want more, Hypnotize is just around the corner ready for release in the fall.  I agree with my fellow reviewers that Hypnotize might end up being a much bigger album.  You get the feeling, listening to this album that it will be a tasty appetizer to what will probably be the best album of 05.  Who knows.  Either way, thanks, System of a Down, for bringing originality and freshness back to music.

B000929AJQ|3.0|I don't know where to begin with this one.  Do I like it?  Well, yes I do.  Was I disappointed?  Why yes, I was.  As an album, With Teeth is a fun cd to jam to, but As a Nine Inch Nails album, well, it's sort of hit or miss songwise.  Nine Inch Nails was my favorite band throughout my high school years.  The Fragile came out when I was in the 9th grade and I listened to it religiously for years.  Unfortunately, I'm the type of person that can only enjoy the same thing for so long.  I eventually grew out of my Nine Inch Nails phase and moved on to different likings musically.  Still, Nine Inch Nails will always hold that special place in my heart.  I'll admit that I wasn't too excited about With Teeth.  Nevertheles, I picked it up upon it's release date and my first reactions were pretty negative.  I figured it was a record that needed time, but I've given weeks and it still has yet to latch onto me the way The Fragile did.  Lyrically, I can relate in so many ways.  The vocals melodies are beautiful and creative, but where's the innovation that made The Fragile so strange and beautiful?  Where are the off key keyboard solos that somehow work?  Where are the tied in melodies that come back to haunt the listener?  With Teeth offers nothing out of the ordinary, and certainly nothing that hasn't been done before.  The main problem that I personally have with With Teeth is the fact that it's all vocally driven.  It seems as if Mr. Reznor has come up with these wonderful vocal melodies and just put the music in as backround music.  It seems as if he just put the parts in because, well, they fit.  I know not everyone is going to agree with this review, but it's just the way I feel about this album.  If you were looking for the innovation of The Fragile, try again, either that or pick up any other earlier Nine Inch Nails release.  If you're looking for songs to jam to and have a fun time, go ahead and give With Teeth a whirl.
1400043662|5.0|All the time I was reading this, I would say \\"this book is too far out there, even for Haruki Murakami\\". My wife would respond with \\"then why are you reading it?\\" and the honest truth is that the characters were so interesting and compelling I couldn't stop reading, even though the surreal nature of the plot didn't entirely agree with me.<br /><br />So I wont go into a comparison between this and other Murakami stories because other reviewers have done that already, but focus on the characters, whom I enjoyed tremendously.<br /><br />Creating a character means crafting a personality, and applying motivations to that personality. Motives lead to actions, which lead to changes, which lead to more motives, which lead to m ore actions, ad nauseam. That's writing 101. In \\"Kafka on the Shore\\", however, the characters (in some cases) entirely lack any personal motives. Rather, they are a part of some self-fulfilling prophecy. They are tied strongly to a predetermined destiny, and their actions and growth as characters stem from their investigation of that destiny.<br /><br />As things begin to come together, we see the characters grow into something beyond mere personalities, and into something larger. They become the actual events and the whole story eventually swirls together into something that makes sense.<br /><br />That's my interpretation of it anyway -- like I said, it was surreal. I'll let the experts analyze this one.<br /><br />Plot: the story moves fluidly between defined goals, and is therefore easy to read, although the surreal nature of the story makes it hard to follow what's really going on behind the scenes.<br /><br />Characters: See above. They're great. A woman who is also a little girl who is tied to the fate of a boy who is also her dead lover, and another boy who is also a girl, a benevolent truck driver and a mentally challenged elderly man who can speak with cats. And of course they all end up being something more than that. Add Johnny Walker and Col. Sanders and you have an all star cast.<br /><br />Pace: The pace moved quickly, and while I often felt I was missing part of the big picture, I never felt bogged down. In fact, it was very difficult to put this book down.<br /><br />Awkward Moment: There is a very disturbing scene around the introduction of Johnny Walker that almost made me put the book down, because it made me think it was going to take an uncomfortably dark turn. The moment passes though, so if your like me, have some faith and get past it and you'll enjoy the book in the end.<br /><br />Prize Moment: Raining Leeches.<br /><br />Loose Thread: The beginning of the book seems to be more grounded in actual events, and these events (and their relation to what is going on with the rest of the characters) fade as the story progresses. The pieces fit, but you have to find them yourself. This could be a translation issue.nny Walker and Col.

B00063MBU8|1.0|oh man, this is what's wrong with music today. almost any idiot will gobble up this kind of cliche garbage. the lyrics stink, the music stinks, and the lead singer needs to just shut the hell up. simple plan is not talented, simple plan are simply terrible. anyone who listens to this and enjoys it, I would feel sorry for you but you're too stupid to contemplate the concept of sympathy. To the kid above who wrote that stupid review, just shut up, you are the one that sucks. Learn to listen to some GOOD music for once, you have nothing to say until you actually acquire some intelligence, which of course you haven't yet. I can write better lyrics than these stupid punks any day of the week, in fact I have. Of course then someone will come back with \\"well if you have, why are you not famous.\\" Newflash morons, you don't have to be famous to write good lyrics. Not only that, but I myself write my own lyrics. I don't let some corporate old farts write my lyrics for me like Simple Plan does. And you are obviously under 13 too you stupid kid, cause you still sound like you are in elementary school. So go ahead and hate SP haters like me, you are just jealous cause we are obviously better and smarter than you. Grow the hell up and fix the tragedy which is your life...There is absolutely nothing Simple Plan does that us people with good taste in music (unlike you) need to appreciate so you can shut up about that too, and like it.
B00008DDXC|4.0|So far, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is my least favorite book (I still think it's a great book though!), but the movie was more well-done than the Sorceror's Stone movie.  We once again return to Hogwarts and the characters we were introduced to in the first movie, but this time, Harry (with the help of his friends Ron and Hermione) must solve the mystery of why students are turning up petrified.  There is another Quidditch match (with a new Slytherin seeker) and many action-oriented scenes, complete with ravenous spiders and a terrifying snake (also known as a basilisk).  The children's acting, while improved from the first, still needs some work, particularly from Dan Radcliffe (who plays Harry Potter).  <br />Overall, I really enjoy this movie, though it still seems a little too sugar-coated for me.  However, as the books keep getting darker, so too will the movies (as demonstrated by Prisoner of Azkaban).
B000060P79|1.0|this so called \\"band\\" just needs to quit, right now. but they won't cause they know that the people like those who gave this poor excuse of a cd (more like a drink coaster) will listen to them and give them the money which they don't deserve. simple plan, hmmm, well they do have one. that is to brainwash these idiots into believing their music is actually GOOD, and of course some people are actually stupid enough to believe such things. heartbreakerrrrr...oh dude shut the hell up, i so want to punch the lead singer in the face, its more like no pads, no helmet, and no balls. and their new cd is called \\"still not getting any.\\" really, i wonder why, could it be because all of you in your little elementary school p***y pop band have no talent and are all complete flamers?  <br /> <br />Simple Plan stinks, no matter what anyone says.
B000002J09|5.0|I bought Led Zeppelin IV after I heard all the positive comments, and listening to quite a bunch of the songs in here. It's much better than what I expected it to be. I put it in my rating scale, similar to Keno's which you can see on his website, and it scored a higher rating than any other album I had rated. Is it really the best album? No. But it's one of them. <br /> <br />Here is what I think of the songs: <br /> <br />Black Dog - 10/10 <br />Rock And Roll - 10/10 <br />The Battle Of Evermore - 8.5/10 <br />Stairway To Heaven - 10/10 <br />Misty Mountain Hop - 10/10 <br />Four Sticks - 9.5/10 <br />Going To California - 10/10 <br />When The Levee Breaks - 10/10 <br /> <br />I am strict about the 10's. Only 2 songs didn't get a 10 here, so it must be good. The album flows amazingly well - Not a dull moment. Opens with Black Dog, when Page is heating up the guitar for all the energy that's all about to blast in. Plant sings a few lines for us, and KA-BOOM! The action begins. Rock And Roll is one of my favourites. I like the guitars, drums, everything. Bonzo did a splendid job in this album, his drums are amazing, and his \\"drum solo\\" at the end is simply awesome.  <br /> <br />The Battle Of Evermore is long, lasts 5:52, and I really don't like it. I mean, it's good the first few minutes, I like the vocals, but then it gets boring and I lose attention. After it is over, Stairway begins, and that is one great song that flows just as well as this album. <br /> <br />Misty Mountain Hop is Jones' baby. Based on his piano-riff, which is amazingly catchy and something I could listen to for hours, I like how it changes tempo but Bonzo is exploiting it a bit there. Anyway, one of the best songs in here. Four Sticks I could have given it a 10 yesterday, but it drags a bit too long. I simply love the first \\"ooh, baby\\" line, one night I sang it all night long because it's so catchy. <br /> <br />Going To California is very relaxing and cool beyond measure, like 3/4's of the album. I simply love it. When The Levee Breaks is spectacular, based on a song by a really ancient blues player but adapted by Led Zeppelin. I love the drums, and I love the first riff, after the harmonica fades out. What a great harmonica! Robert Plant could really get the best sound out of that instrument. Ends with a really strange sound. <br /> <br />Overall, one of the best albums I've heard, and I really recommend it. <br />
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I was bracing myself for this release after hearing \\"BYOB\\" which initially rubbed me the wrong way. But, being a System fan since the self-titled was released, I was obligated to pick it up and give it a chance.<br /><br />Upon putting the new album in my car CD player, I literally did a double-take - It was like hearing an entirely different band. System has grown by leaps and bounds on this album, and the shortcomings of \\"BYOB\\" are not present on most of the other songs. Even \\"BYOB\\" has grown on me a bit.<br /><br />Even though this album is very much its own beast, it shows signs of past efforts. Most noticeably, there has been a return to the Fantomas/Mr. Bungle-inspired weirdo metal of the self-titled. I'm not among the people that thought Toxicity was disappointing and should have been self-titled #2; bands need to grow, and Toxicity showed System indulging in fantastic melodies and expansive, emotional choruses. Steal This Album only served to perpetuate this approach, but hopefully people will remember that it came from the same period of songwriting. The huge melodies and buildups from Toxicity and Steal This Album are present here, but are oh so much more developed and mature.<br /><br />The weakest point of this album are the lyrics. Most of them are decent, hallmark SOAD socio-political commentary. Some of them, though, stick out like a sore thumb, particularely \\"Cigaro\\" and \\"Violent Pornography.\\" The former is a fantastic, heavy as lead salvo of psuedo-death metal guitar riffing, and the latter is a decent rocker with a chorus very similar melodically to the second half of \\"Psycho\\" on Toxicity. Both are musically great songs, if you can ignore the lyrics.<br /><br />Some of the album's melodic highlights include \\"Radio/Video\\" which is probably tied for my favorite song of the album with \\"Question!\\" Both are absolutely amazing songs... I couldn't have imagined SOAD writing anything this rich and involving before this album came. \\"Question!\\" is a hypnotic 5/4 with latin acoustic guitar and might sound at home on a Mars Volta album... except for the heavy chorus which actually manages to remind me of some parts on Opeth's album Blackwater Park. \\"Radio/Video\\" is a relatively long song for System and seems to point towards the calliope fantasy of \\"Peephole,\\" but like many of the songs on this album, is done in a much more mature way than its predacessor.<br /><br />The most awkward portion of the album for me would probably be the last two tracks, \\"Old School Hollywood\\" and \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" (partly because of how cheesey it feels reading them next to each other on the tracklist.) They are both musically very good songs. The chorus of \\"Old School Hollywood\\" is very intimidating and the powerful kick-drum-on-every-count drumbeat drives it forward with the rabid intensity of a Wisconsin Death Trip-era Static-X song. The most distracting thing for me originally was Daron's half-drunk voice during the verses, but I've come to see how it fits and now the biggest detractoction from an otherwise stellar song are those annoying theramin whines during the transition to the chorus.<br /><br />\\"Lost in Hollywood\\" is an ingenious way to end the album for the simple fact that it, along with \\"Old School Hollywood\\" is TOTALLY different from ANYTHING System has done before. However, the melodramatic semi-Elvis chanting in the chorus distracts from an otherwise very effective, emotional song with a chorus that sounds a bit like the end of Dredg's \\"The Canyon Behind Her.\\" In fact, it ends the album in much a same way as this devestating closing track for El Cielo.<br /><br />Despite these small misses amidst an astonishing number of hits, I will be putting this album on heavy rotation.

B0007P3582|2.0|I just can't figure what's wrong, but this album just doesn't appeal to me. I think the songs sound pretty much the same, with their medium tempos, medium beats and almost flat choruses. \\"Disco Inferno\\" is fun, but after a few listens it just fades away. And everyone seems to love \\"Candy Shop\\" (it did rule the chart for 9 weeks, didn't it?) but I think it is nothing special. The beat doesn't even make me bop my head, and the background sound (kind of Asian sound, I think) doesn't fit the beat. Even the chorus is not as infectious as that of \\"21 Questions\\". The current hit, \\"Just A Lil' Bit\\" also doesn't stick to my ears, I just can't distinguish it from all other rap songs out there. So what's going on? 50 Cent has lost his creativity? Only with his second album? What a pity, because I really like his first release, and I thought he would become one of the most influencing rappers in the future. Better luck next time, pal.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is, so far, the cd of the year...every song goes off!! My personal favorites are 'Sad Statue', 'Question', 'B.Y.O.B.', and 'Revenga', but every time this goes in the cd player, the entire cd gets played. This is some serious head bangin' s*#$!! I thought that their last cd, 'Steal This Album' was their best and this is a great follow-up...and surpass. <br /> A word of warning...this cd is very addictive!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This album is great.  I just got it and am listening to every word.  The content is much more deeper and yes different.  Whats wrong with different though?  Why continue to compare things in life?  Just enjoy it.  If you keep comparing this album with the others then you do not get that music and people transcend with time.  Thats the art and beauty of life and of this album.  Otherwise everything would be boring.  I totally recommend this album and some songs more than others are very enjoyable (if youre into this kind of music of course).  Can't wait for the next CD in the Fall.  SOAD Rocks!
B000929AJQ|5.0|It was believed that trent wasn't going to take too many risk's on this album, but I think he did and the outcome was amazing.  As with a lot of his work, the connection to The Downward Sprial (TDS) is still present, but towards the end it seems as if Trent will be going into a new direction at the end.  The album is finally about pulling away from who/what TDS made of him.  I'd also like to go as far as to say, the last track, \\"Right Were It Belongs\\" ranks where \\"Hurt\\" ranks.  It's just that good.

0140177396|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was a wonderfully honest document of how life was like during the depression. Also it showed the inner side of the life of a hobo and a retarded man. In this story both Lennie and George have to run from their past due to Lennies obsession with soft things. In their last residence Lennie had tried to pet a woman's dress and she had reported it as rape. They find a ranch to work at but there is trouble on the first day. The men are friendly except for Curly, the Boss's son. His wife is a tramp who gets all the men in trouble and Curly is not the understanding sort. In the end Curly's wife lets Lennie pet her hair but when she trys to make him stop he grips her and accidentaly breaks her neck. He runs away but George finds him and has to kill him himself. I would not recoomend this story for anyone under 13 years of age, due to the dialouge used and some of the content. This was an honest book and I deeply respect John Stienback.

B000002UJQ|3.0|In the Bible it doth say that if you make a false witness or something you are going to hell.  Well like everyone who reviewed this album is going to hell.  You all say that this is the best album of the 90s or the best album of all time, but you HAVEN'T HEARD every album released in the 90s, let alone throughout all the annals of time.  I mean, Mozart probably released some super-bit*hing album in the 1600s or whenever that cat was writing that \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" song.  Oh yeah, and this album has some good songs and some filler.  It's okay.  Listen to Samael.  Or Peccatum.  Or Ulver.  Or Creed...
B0007QJ1MK|5.0|This one took a few listens to appreciate and now is near impossible to stop listening to. It is brilliantly produced and the song-craftmanship is fantastic. There are so many different audio colors and tracks going on within each song that you can't possibly get everything on just 1, 2 or even 3 listens. The DVD version is a must as you get to see highlights of the album being made track by track. The songs are all fantastic and a bit more \\"mature\\" than their previous efforts. Some are really quite \\"haunting\\" in atmosphere - really unexpected at times, and very, very cool. The previous QOTSA CD's are all great albums, but this one is by far the most cohesive and well executed. Nick O. really is not missed at all except for his spastic vocals - I was surprised at this as he's been such a partner to Josh for so long. All in all a fantastic cd that is a must for your collection.
B0001Z52RU|1.0|This is not an exaggeration or a joke.  It may not be the worst movie ever.  I have not seen every movie ever made.  I can say it is the worst movie I have ever seen, because it is.  There is nothing good about this movie except for Eric Stoltz's hilarious portrayal of a pedophile. <br /> <br />And off topic, if every time he goes back it makes everyone's life worse, then when he strangles himself as a fetus (wow, what a retarded concept) wouldn't that make things worse as well.  Oh, I get it, but he kills himself so now he doesn't have to deal with ruining other people's lives.  He can't even fix his mistakes, so he quits.  What a selfish dou*hebag.

0553103547|5.0|This novel is not classic fantasy. Not even close. There is no little peasent boy who is secretly a prince(atleast not yet) and the book is not completely black and white in terms of good and evil. Every character has certain defects and the reader is allowed to pick his own favourites. The plot contains one surpise and unforseen twist after another and I for one was completley drawn into the story. At times I simply could not put the book down making for some late nights, and bleary eyed mornings. This is a close competitor to Robert Jordan's ''The Eye Of The World'' as my all time favourite fantasy. Fully reccomended.
B00008CLOA|5.0|Another customer comments that this remaster does not stand up against the original Harvest UK CD issue. I have not heard that, but I do own the original US CD issue, the 20th anniversary US issue, the Mobile Fidelity gold CD, and a number of LPs, including a French pressing from a pre-Wall \\"complete\\" box set. Until I heard this, the best-sounding version I'd heard was a Japanese Mobile Fidelity pressing played on a world-class turntable in an incredible stereo system. Stunning. <br /> <br />It's true that the standard-CD version of the album presented here on the 30th anniversary reissue is overly compressed and hyped in the treble and not what I would call faithful to my conception of what the master tape sounds (or ought to sound) like. <br /> <br />But the SACD tracks! It's a completely different program. It is far and away the most lucid, dynamic incarnation I've heard, open and airy and simply *clear* beyond my dreaming. The bass tones in the opening of \\"Time\\" explode from the speakers with an authority I've heard only in listening to SACD material on terrific systems. It's not at all about *quantity* of bass. It's not boomy. There's simply an ease and richness in the sound of the bass that I can only compare to the sound of a plucked string from an electric bass guitar emanating from a great bass amp.  <br /> <br />If you already own this album on CD and you don't have an SACD player, you may want to consider sticking with the version you have. But if you're set up to appreciate Super Audio CD and you like or think you might like this album, this disc is a must-have. Especially at this price! (And it is indeed *The* Dark Side of the Moon, contrary to what another has opined below.)
0553802534|5.0|Based on the recommendation of a fellow blogger, I picked up a copy of Alone by Lisa Gardner.  Wow...  *this* is a crime thriller!<br /><br />Bobby Dodge, a Massachusetts State Trooper who is part of a SWAT-like team as a sniper, is called out on a domestic dispute involving a man welding a pistol against his wife and child.  Dodge ends up firing and killing him based on his judgement that the guy was about to shoot the wife.  He quickly finds out that the man was the son of a very prominent judge who hates his daughter-in-law, wants custody of the child, and is charging Dodge with murder.  The dead guy's wife has her own issues, relating back to a kidnapping when she was young.  She was buried alive for 28 days and abused at the hands of a pedophile before she was found by hunters.  This has left her emotionally damaged and unable to adequately care for her child who is continually ill.  While the whole shooting appears to be a typical hostage situation, the facts dictate that there might be more than meets the eye.  The wife might be an innocent victim or a cruel manipulator that set Dodge up to fire.  And Dodge is falling apart trying to figure out the truth...<br /><br />This is by far one of the best crime thrillers I've read in a long time.  This is one of those stories where an incident happens, the facts have a number of interpretations, and you're left twisting back and forth trying to figure out who's innocent and who's guilty...  who's telling the truth and who's lying.  Throw in a number of wicked plot twists, and you don't know *what* to think until the final few pages.  This is one of those \\"couldn't put it down\\" type books because I really didn't have a clue as to how it was all going to be resolved in the end.<br /><br />This is a \\"must read\\" if you're into the crime genre.  This is also yet another author that I haven't read in the past, and now I'm *really* jazzed to go get her other books.  If they're anything like this one, I have some prime recreational reading ahead of me...ime recreational reading ahead of me...
B0002X314C|5.0|initially, i was hesitant, as a lot of people are when purchasing a new CD. now that i say that, it seems a little weird. anyways...i truly enjoyed his singles, 'ordinary people' and 'used to love you' so I felt comfortable purchasing his CD. i havent stopped playing it. yes, of course, kanye west is involved in the production of the  tracks, and has certainly proven himself in the collaboration with mariah carey in 'stay the night' off her new album. either way, john legend is possession of three things that make an artist: talent(vocal and prolific abilities), confidence, and appeal.  <br />some of my favorites are:  <br />lets get lifted <br />she dont have to know <br />live it up <br />stay with you(the live version is beautiful but not available on the CD) <br />but to be honest, out of 14 songs, i only skipped two. <br />so in my book, this CD is worth it!
B00000K31V|3.0|Sort of a wacky follow-up to VIDEODROME, eXistenZ takes us into the peculiar world of video game fanatics in a way that only David Cronenberg can. Allegra Geller (Jennifer Jason \\"SWF\\" Leigh) has just designed the ultimate video game, complete with pulsating, fleshy control module and umbilical cord! She is the world's foremost game designer and must be guarded against possible assassins (ala videodrome). You see, there is an underground group of revolutionaries who seek to bring back reality as a viable lifestyle. One of them attempts a hit on Geller, only to be terminated himself. Enter Ted Pikul (Jude Law) as the one who must protect Geller and transport her to a safe location. Along the way, we are treated to several strange occurances that make us wonder if any of this is real; especially the 2-headed amphibian critter and the playing of the game eXistenZ itself. The characters are good in a weird sort of way, but I didn't much care what happened to them. The tooth-shooting gun was interesting. eXistenZ isn't exactly terrible, I just didn't like it as much as other Cronenberg offerings...
B0000AM6IY|4.0|First off, let me say that for the movie I rate it 5 stars and this, the MGM DVD from 2003 (not the Special Edition), 4 stars. <br />Reason being is because this is an all-time essential classic <br />and it needed to be presented in its original widescreen format. The sound quality is excellent though, rendered in 5.1. There are also no special features other than Spanish and French audio tracks. This release was all I could afford but it didn't detract from my enjoyment. This Romeo and Juliet story finds the Montagues and Capulets as the Jets and the Sharks, two feuding street gangs in 1950s New York. Jets leader Tony (Richard Beymer) becomes involved in an ill-fated love affair with Maria (Natalie Wood), the sister of Sharks Leader, Bernardo (George Chakiris). As their love blossoms, tensions rise and a rumble occurs with the gangs. Still, Tony and Maria hold on to each other by whatever means and risk everything, even death. All the while it is set to the magnificent score of Leonard Bernstein and choreography of Jerome Robbins. Filled with unforgettable songs like \\"Something's Coming\\", \\"Maria\\", \\"America\\" and \\"Tonight\\", \\"West Side Story\\" will keep your anticipation high, keep you glued to your chair, and steal your heart.
0688152023|5.0|This book was more than I expected when I ordered it. It is large sized and the pictures of the ballet dancers are very inspiring.  The stretches and other exercises are complex but well worth learning.  The workouts are a great addition to any exercise routine.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I just turned the movie off at the hour mark on purpose. God it is so boring. There has been about 2 small chuckles from me, if you where sitting here youd think I forgot to open my mouth when I burped. <br /> <br />Napolean is a boy living in a dull town, has a dull family, dull friends and for some reason it's tryin gto make a kid with a charisma bypass funny. <br /> <br />I get it, ok, I do understand what it's supposed to be doing, but a whole movie dedicated to the same crap over and over is just a snore fest. Either I turned the thing off now or I would have gone to sleep and missed the paint drying session tonight. <br /> <br />ND is the kind of charactor that should be a sub charactor in a movie. He should be a charactor thats in a movie, not the star of a movie. At least that way it might be funny to see unexpected things thrown in in-between scenes, that might be ok, but giving this moron a whole movie dedicated to a dork and his lifeless surroundings has made a movie that you'd have to be high off your rocker to think was entertainment.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I like to look at soundtracks from 2 points of view: agreement with movie, and being able to listen to it on it's own. This soundtrack fits the movie PERFECTLY. I couldn't imagine it being any different. When it comes to listening to it, i think it's even better! When i first saw the movie i loved it, and i couldn't help but notice how great the music fit into the movie, so i bought the soundtrack. After listening on continuous play for about 3 weeks, i saw the movie again and practically knowing the music like the back of my hand, it made the movie so much MORE enjoyable! <br /> <br />I agree with what another person said about studying to this music. It has no words to distract you, it's just energetic, uplifting music which makes Calculus just a TAD BIT more interesting! This soundtrack is up there with the Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter soundtracks as one of the best soundtracks around.
B000002I2M|5.0|The Doors burst onto the LA rock scene, and a few years later, they were releasing their final contractual album, and their 27-year-old singer sounded lika a gravel-voiced bluesman, looking less svelte than the young lion of only a few years earlier.<br /><br />Images and myth aside, this album might be their strongest, excepting the legendary debut.  The focus was a more raw rock and blue records, a followup from the 'return' that Morrison Hotel signaled after the strings and horns, trials, and internal fighting.<br /><br />Working with Elvis' old bass player, the band recorded a lot of the album 'live', right there in the Doors' studios with the bathroom serving as a vocal booth.<br /><br />The Changling is a relatively upbeat number complete with solid bass and some neat tempo changes.  And from the beginning, you can tell the gruff difference in Morrison's voice.  Years of abuse made him sound a whole heck of a lot older than 27 years.  While he wasn't an expertly trained singer from the beginning, his voice was, and still is, immediately recognizable and warm.  But the sound suits most every song here.<br /><br />There are some real bluesy numbers, such as Cars Hiss By My Window, or Hyacinth House, which is a somber tune with a bluesy feel.  Crawling King Snake, a live staple for years, finally made its way to an album, as did Texas Radio, various versions of which had appeared live for years.  The standout track might be the great LA Woman, one of the briskest, coolest 7-minute rock classics ever.  Jimbo's passion for the city and all it meant to him are summed up in the dark but driving tune that includes his shout-out to Mr Mojo Risin, his own name mixed around.  It all closes with the great Riders on the Storm, the track that convinced Paul Rothchild not to produce and to let The Doors run the production and making on their own (with engineer Bruce Botnick).  Complete with the rain and thunder, it's a spooky but playful track that is still a radio staple.<br /><br />Not really a weak spot on here, unless you don't care for the slower, very bluesy tracks like Cars Hiss, or Crawling King Snake, or even the driving, gruff-sounding Down So Long.  Hard to match up the Morrison on here and on the debut.<br /><br />Most Doors albums had filler, there's no doubt, but this might have the least, and it's also the longest Doors LP they ever put out.  By the time it appeared in record stores, Jimbo was in Paris where he'd eventually fade away, creating another legend and joining rock's '27' club.<br /><br />If you don't own any Doors material, this is even a good start.  While the band has a plethora of compilations, the albums are all rewarding, and they sound great remastered.radio staple.   <br /> <br />Not really a weak spot on here, unless you don't care for the slower, very bluesy tracks like Cars Hiss, or Crawling King Snake, or even the driving, gruff-sounding Down So Long.

B0007Y4TVU|4.0|After 3 years, System of a Down has released part 1 of the two album set Mesmerize/Hypnotize.  SOAD hasn't changed much except now the guitarist sings.  His voice is alright but I don't really like him taking lead vocals in songs such as Lost in Hollywood.  When you think of SOAD, you think of Serj, not the guitarist's vocals, but then again, it does bring in some more variety to the music.  This album can't touch Toxicity with a ten foot pole but the instrumentals are nearly on par with it and SOAD haven't lost their touch, except that the lyrics are a little worse.  Also the album's a little too short, barely reaching 38 minutes in length.  Track Reviews: <br />1)Soldier Side (7/10) An emotional intro written from the perspective of a soldier. <br />2)B.Y.O.B (9/10) The first single and is a great song with powerful lyrics and guitar riffs.  The only problem is just that the chorus is too poppy for me.  Even though it's catchy, it's not a chorus that I'd associate with SOAD. <br />3)Revenga (9/10) This is a pretty decent song, one of the better ones off this album. <br />4)Cigaro (6/10) This is one of the worst songs off this album and although the chorus is catchy and the riffs are crunchy, it's just really annoying. <br />5)Radio/Video (9.2/10) This is one of my favorites off the album.  It's pretty funny when both singers are doing the lala thing towards the end.  Also features one of the only guitar solos off the album. <br />6)This Cocaine.. (7/10) This is a good song but is sort of pointless.  Then again, it's SOAD's style to throw in these kinds of songs in the album. <br />7)Violent Pornography (9/10) This is a very good song with the apparent theme listed in the title.  Has a good, melodic chorus. <br />8)Question! (9.4/10) This is my favorite off the album, mainly because it has one of the best and melodic choruses that SOAD has ever written, write up there with Chop Suey.  The only problem is that I'm not too sure if the speeding up at the end was the best choice for this song. <br />9)Sad Statue (9.3/10) This is also a very melodic song with a pretty powerful chorus.  Another of my favoritesm off the album. <br />10)Old School Hollywood (7.5/10) I didn't really like the techno/synth beat too much.  Kinda reminds me of All Your Base Belong to Us. <br />11)Lost in Hollywood (7.5/10) The longest off the album but gets a little repetetive and the rhythm is a bit awkward. <br />Overall, an alright album but I'd reccomend Toxicity and SOAD's self-titled over this.  It's good though that these guys are still popular and I still have faith in them.

B000099T2L|5.0|I remember this album when I was 16. This album is very diverse and the music is groovy and soulful. The musical influences from hip-hop to rock to jazz. The album is equally divided between seductive mid-tempos,lush ballads and fiery club bangers, providing a sharp focus on who Beyonce is right now as a performer,woman and as a creative force. This album is the sound of a grown woman clearly staking her claim in the world and redefining expectations of who she is. The vibe is more mature,more playful,more deeply passionate and sexually aggressive. This album has been certified 4x Platinum. Remember,this was 2003-2004.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|The movie which has been overly criticized to much delivers all the the things that a good moive has. The theological movie brings action,love and a little sci-fi to the table with the classic good vs. evil genre.  Keanu Reeves plays John Constatine a chronicaly depressed over smoker.  John who wish is to go to heaven but after attepted scuicde he already to late.  So he trys to buy his way into heaven by sending excorcized demons back to hell. After a brief talk with the angel Gabrielle he finds that this wouldn't work so he goes deeper into dispare.  Along the way he meets a cop who twin sister has commited suicide played by Rachel Weize.  As she follows him through all the madness of his work she soon finds that guns will not get rid of evil but only faith can.  As the plot thickens johns preiest freind dies by the hands of a demon half-breed and john grows ever wearry of his task.  The movie action and special effects are awesome.  Near the end john must sacrifice himself to save weize and its then when lucifer comes to collect his soul but as the scriptures say slef sacrifice earns you into heaven but lucifer will not let this happen so he keeps john on earth by removing the cancer that was ticcking john closer to death.  In my opinion this was the best movie of the year and Im sorry if the die-hard fans of hellraiser didnt like the movie but get over it some things need change to be better.  All in all i wish they would have a ten star system but even then i would try 11.
B00000DHZJ|4.0|This generous best-of album contains an excellent sampling of Hendrix's best. The signature songs (\\"Purple Haze\\", \\"All Along the Watchtower\\") are as memorable as ever. His forays into blues (\\"Red House\\") are summarized. His explosive rockers (\\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\\") have their place, and his sensitive side (\\"Little Wing\\", \\"The Wind Cries Mary\\") is well represented. Unfortunately (and this is why there should be a 4 1/2 star option)... <br /> <br />No \\"Machine Gun\\"! I suppose another twelve minutes is a little much to ask, but the omission is pretty unfortunate; undoubtedly his best live playing, after all. \\"Wild Thing\\" might have been nice, too. <br /> <br />Still, the best Hendrix compilation I've seen, and a definite recommendation.
B00003CY5J|3.0|THE SCORE has a pretty impressive pedigree:  Oscar winners Robert DeNiro and Marlon Brando; Oscar nominees Edward Norton and Angela Bassett; Oscar winning composer Howard Shore.  Under the astute direction of Frank Oz, THE SCORE is an intelligently made heist film.  Unfortunately, the only performance that goes beyond the conventional is Norton's.  As egocentric young Jack Teller, Norton actually plays a double role:  that of Jack and also of Brian, a seemingly retarded young man who works as a janitor at the Montreal Customs House.  Norton is perfect as the cordial, friendly young man who uses this ruse to find the location of a rare French scepter smuggled into Canada via a piano leg.  DeNiro is the veteran thief out to do one last score before settling down with his girl Angela Bassett and his nouveau jazz club.  Brando huffs and puffs his way through the role of DeNiro's compatriate who enlists his aid in stealing the scepter.  THE SCORE is like its jazzy background score:  smooth, silky, but ultimately bland and derivative.  Bassett is wasted in her role, and DeNiro merely seems to be playing himself.  As for Brando, any actor could have played the role just as well.  It is the combination of these actors, however, and especially Norton's bravura that makes THE SCORE entertaining in spite of its blandness.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|I had no prior experience with The Mars Volta before picking up Francis The Mute. And I'm glad I didn't. Let me begin by saying I have very finicky taste in music, having been a percussionist since junior high school and now into the version 5.0 of my life. I want innovation. I want imagination. I want incredible talent. I want great composition. I want a variety of genres to show me that the group is not a one-hit wonder. And above all... I want to experience the kind of artistic courage that screams, \\"We're hanging out here off a cliff because we believe in our vision/dream.\\" I got all of that with Francis... and more! I will be listening to this one for a while! Every layer you peel back reveals 13 more. Thank you, TMV!

B0000639FE|5.0|This movie, along with \\"The Last Samurai\\" are, in my opinion, Tom Cruise's two best movies. I won't repeat the details expressed in other reviews. <br /> <br />This is a story of two men: Cruise (Jerry Maguire, the sports agent) learns to love someone instead of just his work; Cuba Gooding, Jr. (Rod) learns to play football with the emotion he previously showed only in his family life. <br /> <br />Renee Zellweger (Dorothy) gives a stunning performance. The scene in Dorothy's kitchen before Jerry and she go out to dinner is a magnificent piece of acting. She doesn't say a word - her facial expressions say it all. (Cameron Crowe, the director, said that Zellweger's performance in this scene was the best acting he had ever witnessed - and it was done in one take!) <br /> <br />

B00005JNEI|5.0|Several people here have loved this movie, because it sheds light on what has really been happening in the white house, and in Iraq. <br /> <br />However, many people that have left reviews here that were bad, did not actually rate this film based on the FILM, but rather their political opinions. <br /> <br />But the same goes for those who have said the film was excellent, but only because they dislike President Bush. <br /> <br />The truth is, everyone needs to see this movie, regardless of what other things you've heard, and especially regardless of whether you fall to the right, left, or somewhere in between. <br /> <br />It is also important to remember that 95% of this film is factual information. The other 5% being the 'action' that makes this film worth watching, and not like an extra long version of the nightly news. <br /> <br />Some will argue that there is little or no truth to this film. However, the proof is out there. <br /> <br />I was a republican. I used to be very far to the right. After seeing this movie, I wasn't convinced that all of this was true, because my republican friends said that everything in this movie was a lie. However, it was interesting enough that I did some research, and found that all of what this movie presents is indeed true! None of this is made up. A lot of this information was later confirmed by the 9/11 Commission themselves!  <br /> <br />I also discovered that on MichaelMoore.com, he has posted pages upon pages of facts from the film. But, it's not just him saying it, becuase otherwise I wouldn't have believed it, if it was just HIM saying all of this. However, there is a link under each and every fact that will take you to an INDEPENDENT site that backs up these facts, such as CNN, MSNBC, The Wall Street Journal, and hundreds of other sources. <br /> <br />As I said before, I used to be a republican. A hardcore one at that. When I saw this movie, I hated Michael Moore, and did not want to see this film, except to see the 'lies' that were in it. However, I now can see that what this man is saying is the honest to God truth. <br /> <br />So regardless of your previous opinions, or your political standings, you really should see this film. <br /> <br />It is incredibly interesting, and it really exposes what has really been happening in Washington, to the point that it is scary. <br /> <br />I mean, this man, our president, George W. Bush, truly scares me now that I have seen what he has done! <br /> <br />And I will not lie. I did vote for him in 2000, but I did not make that same mistake in 2004. <br /> <br />Regardless of what you have believed, or what I do, you should really see this film. <br /> <br />I hope this helps, and I do hope that everyone sees this film, and realizes that we need to take a good look at the way this country is going, and this film definitely shows that. <br /> <br />God bless you, and God bless America!
0316776963|5.0|My freshman year of college I had a roommate who raved about David Sedaris. Considering how I loathed her and everything she enjoyed, I avoided her advice for a couple of years. What a mistake. \\"Me Talk...\\" is the first Sedaris book I've picked up but it certainly won't be the last.  <br /> <br />This book is a collection of humorous, autobiographical short stories or ancedotes that chronicle Sedaris' life from an effeminate lisping boy, to college drop out, to a hack college professor lecturing on soap operas at the Art Institute of Chicago, and finally the guy who moves to France to live with his boyfriend and simply cannot learn French.  Yet, in my opinion the book isn't even really about Sedaris, but instead his hilarious observations about friends, family, Americans in general and seemingly mundance aspects of life. <br /> <br />I know it's trite and it's been said before, but this book did literally have me laughing out loud. Not all the time, but more often than not. Some of my personal favorites include \\"Jesus Shaves,\\" \\"You Can't Kill the Rooster,\\" and \\"Pick a Pocketoni.\\"

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I had thought System of a Down fell of the face of the Earth since their last album.  Which I was content with, as their last album, \\"Steal This Album,\\" was a significant step backward from \\"Toxicity.\\" So when I heard they were coming out with a new album, I cringed, as I was not overly impressed with their last effort.  However, when I heard \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" for the first time, I was instantly hooked, what a great song (though you would not know it by watching their SNL performance).  I however, was still hesitant to drop the cash money on the entire album, so I sampled it online and deemed it worthy of entering my collection.  And I must say, I am VERY pleased.  This album has some real gems, like \\"Radio/Video,\\" and \\"Old School Hollywood,\\" just to name a couple. <br /> <br />I lovingly refer to Daron Malakian as \\"The Best Worst Guitar Player Out There.\\" And I am very happy to hear him not only sing harmony and background vocals, but also he takes the lead on a number of occasions and Serj takes a back seat.  Daron has a pretty interesting voice and its a good change of pace for the band.  Some people refer to the lyrics as silly.  Yes, they most certainly are, but I think it works really well for them and their overall silly live performances.  However, it does work against their other more \\"political\\" lyrics, ie it is hard to take them seriously. <br /> <br />Anyway, bottom line, its a good album with excellent rhythms, harmonies, beats, etc.  It is a giant leap forward from their last album.  Check it out.
0694003611|5.0|We love this book.  My son adores it.  After bath time, we put him in his crib and give him a book to play with while we read him another one.  Goodnight Moon is one of the very few books that he has no desire to play with or read another book while we are reading this one (Guess How Much I Love You is another).   <br /> <br />We love this story because it is so interactive.  Now that he is getting older, he points out all the things in the story, he counts to three (three little bears sitting in chairs) and he says Night Night after each Good Night page. We just love it. <br /> <br />As I said we are going on book number 2 here.  The first book is too well loved and we need another copy of it.   <br /> <br />Truly a timeless classic.
B000002H6C|1.0|Some songs have a good into, but that is where the \\"good\\" ends. Track 4 is good for the first few minutes then it goes down hill from there. Most of the solos are to long, some of the solos are WAY to long.  <br /> <br />Most of all, the recording quality is HORRIBLE. Put this cd into a high quality stereo system - an amp/preamp combo w/ high end speakers and cd player - and you will know what I mean! Few albums released in the eighties were recorded this poorly.

Yeah, try that speed he's got going for over 40 seconds (demonstrated on Slipknots 2nd album, track 8).  you think you are better?  pick up some sticks, sit your ass down on a drum-set, and show him up.  I wish you the best of luck and I hope someone is feeding you oxygen 10 seconds into you trying.   <br />Really, don't be dissin' this band based on your lack of knowledge.  Just because Corey screams a lot, and joey sometimes rolls (although I watched him once; he doesn't roll, he plays every single note.  Thats fast), doesn't mean that you are the supreme being of knowing and we should all listen to you.  No.   <br />This isn't death metal, and corey does lose his voice, even on tracks(2nd cd, last song, near end corey starts coughing and choking).   <br />WHAT MAKES SLIPKNOT \\"SLIPKNOT\\". <br />1) The masks.  You find another band with those kind of masks and has authority to wear them, I will eat my foot. <br />2) They do NOT play the same thing over and over.  If you listen to them, you will notice a big difference in the song chord structure and melody changes. <br />3) If you say they suck, usually that means that they are better than you (faux-pronounced \\"foe\\"-drummer). <br />4) You are right on this one.  You know why?  The human ear is only capable of picking out and transmitting 4 seperate soundwaves at a time.  Thank you, you have just proven the presence of The Ear! <br />5) Dude, who \\"roars\\" nowadays anyway?  At least with Corey screaming, it is possible to hear what he is saying, not the low grunts and caveman talk of a \\"roaring\\" guy. <br />6) Aw[...]  Afraid of clowns now are we? <br />7) Dude, what if they ARE gay?  I doubt it, but it would, I think, make tham all that more cooler. And those stains?  What else could they be?  Hmm.  Sweat, perhaps? <br />8) Ok, ill give you that one, MTV does kinda suck now.  But hey, they played a music video of SOAD once, so they can't be all bad can they? <br />9) Refer to Number 3, only this time, all in caps. <br />Im not out to discredit you or anything, just that you should be a little more informed on your random rantings and yelling.  It never got anyone anywhere. <br />If you are a fan of Korn, Disturbed, or other bands with a unique sound (like SOAD!!), then you might be pleased with this album.  Happy Shopping!
B00005YXZH|1.0|How about some decent lyrics...consistantly? Also the melody lines sound like what you would sing when you've got a few chords down and are first making up a verse or chorus, not a final product. A bunch of weird noises + dumb lyrics + singing like your hungover laying in bed = great music for some I guess. There are a few decent moments, but nothing a million garage bands couldn't duplicate in 5 minutes. Maybe my perspective is different than most because I record bands all the time and have done a few albums myself.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I have been a SOAD fan ever since they released their first record.   <br />I have purchased every cd they have put out so far, including the un-official cd bio.  I gotta say, this looks like one kick-ass album.  Sadly I do not own this record yet, but I have listened to the samples, ALL of them about 4 times over.  Right now, using my exp and senses, BYOB and Sad Statue will be the highlights of the album, just like Chop Seuy, Toxicity, and aerials were for Toxicity.  Some of the other songs sound a little on the stretchy side, but overall a very well made album.  I give it 4 stars for two reasons.   <br />1) I haven't yet listened to the entire thing, but what I heard on the Samples kind of disappointed me.  Where is Serj's melodic voice (hope thats spelled right)?  Darons beautiful chords and solos that compliment Serj so well?  I heard some of it, but not much. <br />2) I have a personal attachment to the Toxicity album.  I believe that is is the best one yet.  Granted, I have yet to hear this album, but I also thought the \\"Steal This Album\\" cd would top \\"Toxicity\\".  Needless to say, I lost my bet.  If you are new to SOAD, get Toxicity first.  It is like a Sytem of a Down 101 class.  If you like that, you will respect everything else they have out. <br />  I am looking forward to owning this cd and I hope that I will not be dissapointed.  Happy Shopping!
B00064ADR0|5.0|A great, timeless album. Terrific re-issue with fantastic artwork. A credit to the people behind the scenes.
B0007TKNII|4.0|I wasn't too sure about Phantom of the Opera. God. For years I've loved the music. I own the original CD. I've always wanted to see the broadway play, but never have. It's a goal of mine to someday do so.<br /><br />So when I heard that they were making it into a movie that would be more true to the broadway play... I was elated. Yet, Schumaker??? Dear god... did anybody see Batman & Robin?<br /><br />The movie just squeaks out a 4 in my opinion. There is something missing. Fear. Dread. Maybe? The story elements of the movie don't POP like I would have liked. The Phantom isn't as frightening as I would have liked.<br /><br />The music, on the other hand, is top notch. In fact, from what I understand from the special features, the stage play is only allowed a certain number of orchestra into the pit, but with the film, Andrew Lloyd Weber was gifted with a full orchestra and the music during the DVD is breathtaking. That, to me, is the appeal, and the reason for the 4 stars.<br /><br />If you want a scary Phantom of the Opera, see the 1925 Lon Chaney version, or even the 1989 Robert Englund version, but if you want to hear Andrew Lloyd Weber's fantastic score echo through your living room, you can't go wrong with this one.<br /><br />Besides, Emmy Rossum is fantastic... and her voice is spine-tingling when she sings \\"Think of Me\\".
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I was fortunate enough to see this concert when they came to Philadelphia and I can easly say it was one of the all time best concerts i had ever been to - easily in my top 5. The songs and the performances were outstanding--should you expect anything less from such a legendary group of musicians....Hearing them perform these classics live brought chills to ones spine and the occaisonal tear to the eye....a rarety in concerts these days. I am so greatful that they decided to record one of these magical nights for all to see and the set list is impressive...If you are lucky enough to have them heading to your area in the next few months you have to see them-do NOT miss this oppertunity....this is one concert you will get your moneys worth and then some....But for those who cant make it and for the ones who have expreienced the Eagles Live this is going to be  great to relieve those memories and classic songs all over again. If you are a music lover this is a MUST HAVE for your collection. Be prepared to be blown away by one of the best bands EVER. The Eagles. 'nuff said.
B00009ZYBY|3.0|Yes, it's got all the trademark Ridley Scott gritty imagery and fantastic cinematography, plus the usual Scott posers, but as cinema it is the same old Hollywood Roman epic cliche with the same old bad-blooded, self-deluded, and obsessively criminal Emperor and the same old man-of-the-people, victimized warrior hero whose integrity miraculously overcomes the Roman system. Zzzz. What's worse, as history it's retarded.  Nothing happened this way, folks, and there are countless anachronisms.  I don't believe that the movie medium is anyplace to really get your history, but at least it shouldn't try to pretend to be historical when it's not even close to the facts.  This is, pure and simple, an abuse of history for the purpose of glamour. At best, it's simply a costume drama fantasy.  They should have changed it from Rome to Lemuria--then they could have added some dragons and fighting skeletons and emulated \\"Jason and the Argonauts,\\" which is what this movie is closer to than Tacitus.  Otherwise--a Roman general who's actually a man of the wheat--wow, powerful..zzzz. Take away the fight scenes and this is pretty boring stuff. But yes, the fight scenes were often wonderful.  Too bad it wasn't Tacitus.
044022165X|5.0|I've only read a few books by John Grisham, but I can definitely say I've enjoyed them thus far. One day I was bored so I ransacked my bookshelf for books I haven't read (most often hand-me-downs from my brothers or books that caught my eye at a second hand book store), and The Pelican Brief caught my eye and I've been into John Grisham books ever since. Though I still view The Firm as Grisham's best book (that I've read anyway), The Rainmaker is definitely up there.  <br /> <br />When at a bookstore (second hand stores always have interesting books), I stumbled upon a copy of The Rainmaker, and for a bargain buck I start into it, reading whenever I could spare a minute. It's a very suspenseful, entertaining and yes, funny book. I could feel myself right there the entire way with Rudy. It seemed like when things finally got good, something bad happened. <br /> <br />The book is written from the point of view of a young lawyer named Rudy Baylor. Required to give free legal advice to the elderly in a Senior Citizens home. In his first visit, Rudy meets a serious smoker named Dot Black with a son who was screwed over by an insurance company in a fatal way planning to sue, and a woman who claims to be worth millions by the name of Mrs. Birdie. Everything seems to be going alone well for a while with Rudy until his future job falls through and he is left jobless and in big trouble. Unable to pay his bills, he is soon evicted, and things seem to go downhill from there. Later on in a rather shady firm when scavenging the hospital for new \\"customers\\", Rudy meets a young lady who he instantly likes. After he researches a bit, he finds out her husband beats her. They meet in secret and things further progress. In the courtroom, things seem to look up for Rudy when the judge who seemed to favor his opponent croaks and is replaced by a guy who takes a shining to Rudy instead. Who knows what will happen with Rudy in the courtroom and out? Read The Rainmaker to find out... <br /><br />L.M.
B0007TKNII|5.0|The Phantom of the Opera is an exceedingly good musical; I have had the misfortune of never having seen it live, but hearing it on CD is more than enough. In fact, it is arguably better than the novel on which it was based. It all depends on what sort of tone you are looking for, and whether you prefer Gaston Leroux's explanations for the Phantom's capabilites, or the more supernatural and inexplicable nature of the musical.<br /><br />Anyway, this movie version is a worthy production of the fantastically popular Broadway show. The set is marvellously rich and colorful. The decision to have the opening auction scene in grainy black and white is a good one; it provides an especially stark contrast when the Paris Opera House is restored to its former beauty to the thunderous strains of Andrew Lloyd Webber's music.<br /><br />Emmy Rossum is fantastic as Christine Daae, and seems to step into Sarah Brightman's shoes with little difficulty. Her voice is charming--though some of the more difficult parts seem harder for her to surmount that Ms. Brightman; but that may change in time.<br /><br />Gerard Butler is a little less satisfying as the Phantom. He acts the part well enough, but his voice is the worst in the film, and for the main character that is not too good. It isn't a *bad* voice, but compared to the rest of the cast is leaves a little to be desired. One must suspend belief when we are told that he is giving Christine VOICE LESSONS. One just hast to shake his head at that.<br /><br />But Mr. Butler does not have enough in him to ruin the film; all-in-all it is quite a good production. I found it better on the second time around than at the theatre, though that usually happens to me with most movies.<br /><br />So, if you like the musical, see this film. I found it very nice to actually see what the sets and whatnot were supposed to look like. I know a friend who has seen the live production, and she said that the sets were very similar, though of course larger and more flexible, since one can do far more with a film than a stage production.<br /><br />~Connorcourse larger and more flexible, since one can do far more with a film than a stage production.  <br /> <br />~Connor
B0007MWZEK|4.0|After using it maybe a total of 7 times it no longer works.  Yes, it has a warranty but as another reviewer put it - is it really worth spending the money for s/h?  Don't waste your money!  I just basically threw away 40 bucks.
B00005LMBK|5.0|When I first heard of Gorillaz in 2001, my first reaction was \\"Eh\\". I didn't really care about them and Clint Eastwood didn't impress me too much. And that was that. Fast forward three years later to 2004, I decide to give Clint Eastwood another chance, and I found I like it much more, but I didn't bother with the rest. I was asked to burn this CD a while later and did, and I liked what I heard, so I decided to give it a listen myself.    But enough about that. This CD has impressed me very much. I love this this CD. It is a great album that mixes rock, hip-hop and techno all into one smooth mix. The result is just one great album.    Just a short intro to the Gorillaz, if you didn't know: They consist of 2-D (aka Damon Albarn from Blur) on vocals, Noodle (Miho Hatori of Cibo Matto) on guitar, Murdoc on bass and Russell (Del tha Funkee Homosapien) on drums as well as doing his raps.     It starts with Re-hash, which starts out with effects mixed with acoustic guitar. Overall a nice-sounding track and a good way to get it started. It then goes to 5/4, which is a nice short little track that starts with acoustic guitar and the vocals of 2-D. A cool song that's more on the rock side that is reminiscent of Nine Inch Nail's Closer at some part. The third track is Tommorow Comes Today, one of the singles. A slow paced song with an excellent tune. Excellent song that's one of the more serious-sounding ones.    The CD continues with New Genious (Brother). This is one of the weaker songs on the CD in my opinion.  It works as another good \\"slower\\" song, but pales in comparrison to Tommorrow Comes Today, especially being right after it. Then follows Clint Eastwood, one of the highlights of the CD. This is just a great song. Awesome tune and use of vocals. The mixture of 2-D's singing of the chorus and Russell's rapping makes this one of the best songs on this CD. It then slows down with Man Research (Clapper). More on the hip-hop/techno side for this song, producing a strangesound with 2-D's \\"Yeah yeah ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya\\" and the scratching. A good and weird track.     Punk follows next and is the shortest song in the Gorillaz library at 1:38. Still a fun song nonetheless and a good song you'll find yourself clapping to. It's good to transition to Sound Check (Gravity). Sound Check is another good song, starting with a slower pace and 2-D's singing, then going into scratching and Russell's rapping in the background. 2-D's vocals and the bass of Murdoc makes for this to be one of the higher points of the album. Double Bass is next, and is an instrumental. I don't feel it's as good as the others, since the vocals in Gorillaz songs are an essential part, but a cool sound nonetheless.    Rock the Party is the only song on this album consisting of only Russell's vocals. A cool song mixing his usual drum beats and trumpets to make a good dancing track. His raps are good, as usual. 19-2000 follows and is one of the better known songs, and is the one featuring the rather cute voice of Noodle, the guitarist for the band, saying \\"Get the cool, get the cool shoeshine\\". Though I feel the Soulchild remix on G-Sides is far better, still an excellent song. After that is Latin Simone (Que Pasa Contigo). This is song made to sound like a traditional Spanish romantic song, with a Gorillaz beat added to the background. Featuring the vocals of Ibrham Ferrer, this track is one of my favorites, though many people don't like it because of the Spanish vocals.    The thirteenth is Starshine, which has an excellent tune, but with limited vocals/lyrics. The music more than makes up though, as this is one of the more trippy songs on the CD. The next song is Slow Country, my personal favorite. With an excellent piano intro and excellent use of sound effects, combined with 2-D's excellent vocals, this song excels above most others. An amazing song overall. M1 A1 follows. The build-up is a tad bit too long (nearly half the four minutes...) but the following isn't bad, a guitar-driven track. Good to listen to if you can put up with the build-up.    Towards the end is Dracula, with an interesting sound to it. Just a good song overall, one of the longer ones on the CD. And finally is Left Hand Suzuki Method, which is just interesting, mixing strings, hard guitar and Noodle speaking to make a loud, strong rocking beat. At about 3 minutes, it's over, leaving a space until 5:30, where the Ed Case Remix of Clint Eastwood starts. It's basically a faster mix of Clint Eastwood with different vocals added in with the usual chorus. A cool version of Clint Eastwood.    If you don't feel like reading all that, my ratings:    1. Re-hash - 8.5/10  2. 5/4 - 7.5/10  3. Tommorow Comes Today - 9/10  4. New Genious (Brother) - 8/10  5. Clint Eastwood - 10/10  6. Man Research (Clapper) - 8.5/10  7. Punk - 8/10  8. Sound Check (Gravity) - 9/10  9. Double Bass - 7.5/10  10. Rock the House - 8.5/10  11. 19-2000 - 8/10  12. Latin Simone (Que Pasa Contigo) - 10/10  13. Starshine - 9/10  14. Slow Country - 10/10  15. M1 A1 - 7/10  16. Dracula - 8.5/10  17. Left Hand Suzuki Method - 8.5/10  17.5. Clint Eastwood (Ed Case Remix) - 8.5/10
B000929AJQ|4.0|After the Fragial graced our ears 5 years ago, ive been egarly anticipating trent's next move. Hoping that it wouldn't take another half a decade before i could hear new music or seem NIN live. sure enough it did and here we are in 2005 with the new disc; With Teeth.<br /><br />I attended the listening party held in NYC nearly a month before the albums release and was less then impressed. Nothing really stuck out. This was not a new classic. but i knew i had to give it another chance. so i ran out the day before it was released and picked it up. Theres more that stuck to my ear drums this time but still, this wa not worth waiting 5 years for! It would have been great if this came out maybe 2 years after fragial but not 5!! Lets examine shall we?<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />1)All The Love In The World-One of my favorites! a beautiful opener! almost sounds like massive attack!<br /><br />4)The Hand That Feeds- This song (like the album)grew on me. Its driving and you can dance to it!<br /><br />6)Every Day Is Exactly The Same- a little repetivite but it reminds me of Even Deeper off the Fragial a little.<br /><br />8)Only- Quite a different track. I love the bass line<br /><br />9)Getting Smaller-Perhaps my favorite track on the album! Its straight up ROCK with a touch of Nails<br /><br />10)Sunspots-Very well sectioned<br /><br />13)Right Where It Belongs-One of his best closers ever. beautiful song<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />3)The Collector- Goofy and boring<br /><br />5)Love Is Not Enough-Just a very weak track<br /><br />7)With Teeth-CRAPPY song! Worst on the album! I do like the piano part in the middle but thats it.<br /><br />OTHER:<br /><br />2)You Know What You Are: Driving, Repitious and a little unmemorable but not bad<br /><br />11)The Line Begins To Blur: I like it, I don't love it. used to hate it, grew on me.<br /><br />12)Beside You In Time: It used to be in my bad list but now its not that bad.<br /><br />Ok, so i guess this album does deserve the 4 stars i have given it. I mean, its got 7 good tracks, 3 bad ones and just a couple i'm a little indiferent about. But I don't see any CLASSICS here. Trent is a hard working guy, and i hope to be writing a 5 STAR review sometime soone then 5 years!ones and just a couple i'm a little indiferent about. But I don't see any CLASSICS here.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I'll admit it, I'm not a fan.  I liked Aerials, Chop Suey! and Innervision, but that was about it.  I listened to samples of Mezmerize, and was really taken aback.  SOAD still does the Euro-Metal style of fast-slow-fast-slow music, but this time they have blended in more styles, and the lyrics are decidedly political. <br /> <br />The whole thing comes across as Metallica teaming up with Fishbone and The Clash.  And this is what I have been waiting for??? <br /> <br />Absolutely.  It's Metal, but also carries a lot of old Punk sentiments (back when Punk had something to say), and also sprinkles in a playfully nasty mixture of yodelling, operetta and reggae.  It's relevant, fresh, and in a word, brilliant. <br /> <br />If this is the new direction of SOAD, count me in.  I may even go  to their back catalog between releases.

B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I just wanted to make a comment about the reviewer who attacked SOAD for shoving left wing political views down his throat, and for their anti war stance...where the \\"f\\" have you been is the question? Have you even ever listened to a SOAD album, theyve always been anti war, anti bush, anti YOU, go ahead and toss the cd out your car window, you aren't a true fan, you probably hopped on the SOAD bandwagon after seeing them on mtv2
B000022TSH|4.0|Chinatown is a classic in the original sense.  It's brooding and often dark plot offer's a real treat for any fan of film noir.  Save only that it is in color instead of black and white.  But this fact does not detract from this being a great film.  This is, perhaps, one of Jack Nicholson's greatest film roles.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|System of a Down's MEZMERIZE is a triumphant return from one of the most innovative metal bands today.  Speed/Thrash riffs with Death Metal shouts that demand attention.  Serj Tankian's absurd, quirky melodies are as unique as ever and he gets additional help with vocals on this album from guitarist Daron Malakian contributing to even more insane songs.  The content is what you would expect from a political band who are descendants of a country sharing a border with Iraq.  The only disappointing element of this album are the majority of the songs (even when making bold statements) rely on SOAD's juvenile humor rather than more complex lyrics like \\"Spiders\\", \\"Chop suey!\\", \\"Toxicity\\" and \\"Aerials\\".  But in the end the creativity of bands like System of a Down and Fair to Midland(ftmband.com) are what keeps metal interesting today.
B0001CCXY8|5.0|this is my first Cannibal Corpse CD but im glad i bought it. i like all the music in this CD and the vocals and lyrics arent to bad either(lets say they go well with the music). Decency defied is my personal fav here but all the other songs are worth a listen too. and one last thing...im sick of all the people saying Cannibal Corpse is not talented, i mean have you seen them play? i would love to see anyone who's said that to try playing a song =P
