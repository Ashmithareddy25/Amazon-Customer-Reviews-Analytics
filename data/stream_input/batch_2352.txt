B004LROUNG|5.0|I have read most of John's books. I am amazed how his writing can keep you in the book. I can recommend any of his books. I still have a couple that I have not picked up yet. As I am writing this I am grabbing another one of his books.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Worth the money. Good story line. Great graphics and sound. Not too hard or too easy. Zoom works great, best part is that you can find items without having to use the zoom.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Enjoy this album each and everyday , love Andrea Bocelli ! Saw the PBS special love in Portifno many , many times can't wait till it comes out on<br />dvd.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun and entertaining<br />enjoyable and easy to use I like that the game saves your progress no need to start levels over again and again. I would recommend this game to anyone.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Swiftkey is the best keyboard replacement for Android that I've ever used, especially now that it also has the option for swype like drag to type functionality. I wouldn't say that it is the perfect keyboard, as touch screens are still furstrating to use sometimes, but it is definitely an improvement on the stock keyboards.
B0045HCJ8U|5.0|As much as Streetcar is all about Brando, rounding out the cast are three actors quite capable of measuring up to his commanding performance.  As such, much credit must be given to Kim Hunter, Vivien Leigh and Karl Malden. A true classic that holds up to repeated viewings.
B0027MJU00|5.0|This is the third book I have read by this author, and it did not disappoint.  Very interesting topics and a storyline that is hard to put down.
B008220DGE|5.0|No, this is not what you would call a crowd pleaser.  But for the discerning viewer who finds great acting compelling subject matter in itself,  add \\"The Master\\" to your list of must sees.  Some of my favorite movies falls into the talkie play adaptations, such as Long Day's Journey Into Night, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? and A Streetcar Named Desire.  If those titles are of interest, check out The Master. If not, pass.
0812975219|4.0|Last year my friend gave me Taleb's Black Swan as a gift. While it was a perplexing read (seeming to spawn more questions than it answered), I can't help but think that I would have been better served to have read Fooled By Randomness first. I'd be inclined to tell others to do so, as I think it provides a necessary foundation in understanding how Taleb thinks. Fooled By Randomness is a great book, even for the intellectual lightweight (this reader being one of them), although I can't quite give it 5 stars because the general tone is just a little too dry and a little too long for my taste. Nevertheless, I can say the book has had an impact on the way I view the world and helped transform some of my suspicions into full-blown skepticism. I fancy myself a bit of a skeptic, and it's refreshing to find a prescient author put into words some of those thoughts I've had but never quite been able to express. This book is for the skeptic - those meandering souls among us that can't quite come to embrace the dogma - who really question how much human knowledge makes us better predictors of the future. For those of us that find ourselves scratching our heads when CEOs, MBAs, or economists make pronouncements about the future or when religious zealots (of both the theistic and atheistic brands) make sweeping generalizations about morality, Taleb can provide some peace of mind. The book probably won't win you many new friends, since those that are certain of their prophetic knowledge of the future often can't be convinced otherwise, but at least you'll have a little more cause to embrace your uncertainty and a little better understanding of your humanity. It's a great read, even for those superficially inclined to intellectualism, and I think it can actually provide you with some new perspectives about how the world may operate and how much stock you should put in, for example, someone's (alleged) heroic rise to wealth.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've added three places since now. The weather information is timely updated and the information so far is pretty precise to the real weather. I can also get update in the  quick bar on top of my kindle. It's convinient and wellinformed.
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it! This book kept me wanting more and I could not stop reading til I finally finished. This is a must read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is awesome. If you haven't already downloaded and you are a fan of temple run .This would be a good game for you.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I honestly didn't know what I was getting into when I downloaded this app on my Kindle Fire 8.9 but I am addicted to it already & the graphics are great! Can get hard at times but that is the beauty of it by making you think!!!
B003O7I6SY|5.0|The quality of the blu-ray transfer is much better than the old DVD copy that was given to me as a gift several years ago.<br />As a 007 movie I'm very fond of it, and in many ways it is an improvement over the original THUNDERBALL which I thought dragged on with the underwater sequences towards film's end. It was good to see Sean Connery back in the \\"saddle\\" after the lamentable performances of Roger Moore hamming it up. It has pace, but what gives this movie that \\"bit extra\\" is the stylish direction of Irvin Kershiner. The performances by Barbara Carrera and Klaus Maria Brandauer are larger than life, but never drift into pure caricature. And there are the nice touches of humour.  Even though it is not considered worthy by many of the Bond film aficionados because it was not made by Eon, It is still, in my humble opinion, worth of a top place in the canon.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I loved this book the only thing that I have to comment on it is that the detail was a bit to much I would have liked it to have went a little faster but it could just be because I rarely get time to read....
B0050DZN4K|4.0|I switched to feedly after google announced \\"reader\\" would be no longer. After playing with it a bit, it us easy to use. Another plus is the look of the app- a lot nicer than google reader.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was the best book ever!!!!! I would definetely rate this book better than five stars. You should definetely download it.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This book held me all theway thru.  Written like a diary and going back and for from present to the time leading up to the climax was a fun way to read a book and really explored the personalities of the characters.  I will read everything that this author puts out.
B008393Q2O|4.0|Skinny Notes is a useful app that lets you create text notes, drawn notes, and create check lists.  You can color code your notes, and filter both by type and color.  There is also a search feature that is very handy.  The app is basic but functional.  And it is stable!  I didn’t find any bugs!  Kudos to the programmer.<br /><br />But while I didn’t find any bugs, I found a few issues…<br /><br />* I had a lot of trouble dragging items in check list until I figured out the trick.  You need to press and hold the little up/down icon to the left of the item title.  If you press and hold over this icon the item turns a dark gray color and you can move the item up or down.  If you press and hold anywhere else on the item, the item turns a golden color and you can’t move it.  I think the instructional hint needs to be changed to include this little gotcha.<br /><br />* I had issues drawing circles (or any smooth shape) on the Draw Note.  The first circle I drew looked fine.  It was nice and smooth.  But each successive circle I drew came out more and more angular.  After drawing three or four circles they started to look like octagons. (Note: I’m using a Kindle HD)<br /><br />* If you turn on “Sort Items By: Checked Conditions”, the words run on top of the “Type Filter” field.<br /><br />I also have an extensive “wish list”….<br /><br />On Draw Note:<br /><br />* When you are at the main screen, drawn notes are stretched horizontally to fit the screen.  This gives the drawing a distorted look that is not pleasing to the eye.<br /><br />* Allow the lines to be drawn in different color.  Currently all the lines are black.<br /><br />* Need an erase (or undo) option that would allow you to remove certain portions of the drawing.  Currently you must clear everything and start over.<br /><br />* Would like the ability to add a photo to the Draw Note.<br /><br />On the Main Screen:<br /><br />* Add a  “Completed/Uncompleted” option on the Type Filter.<br />* On the Color Filter allow more than one color to be selected.<br />* Add a Grid Type of “Line with Title Only”<br />* On the Main Screen, would like the completed items in check list to show a “check” icon or to be crossed out.  The bolding is hard to see.<br /><br />So just a small wish list to complement an already great app..<br />* On the Color Filter allow more than one color to be selected.<br />* Add a Grid Type of “Line with Title Only”<br />* On the Main Screen, would like the completed items in check list to show a “check” icon or to be crossed out.

B000FC0V3E|3.0|If this was how American youth drank in the 20s it explains prohibition. Interesting character analysis solely through conversation, often under the influence. The narrator is sexually frustrated due to a war wound and the object of his affections is a nymphomaniac irresistible to men. No holds barred for all the rampant prejudices of the era against Jews and blacks.
B004TI5N38|3.0|John Puller is David Baldacci's unretired version of Lee Child's Jack Reacher. Coincidentally, I had recently read two earlier Reacher novels by Child. I was drawn to Child's Reacher novels by the recent 2012 release of the major motion picture \\"Jack Reacher\\" (based on Child's book \\"One Shot.\\"<br /><br />Reading Baldacci's \\"Zero Day\\" was like reading the next in the series of the Reacher novels....Same kind of main character almost exactly: A rough, tough dude with a Military Police background. And unlike the traditional methods used by Military Police, Puller (and Reacher)--while extremely intelligent--prefers the methods of Rambo to exact his justice.<br /><br />Up until the climax, \\"Zero Day\\" was a thrilling page-turner just like the two Child novels that I read. And just like the two Child novels, \\"Zero Day\\" has its share of implausible scenarios. But \\"Zero Day\\" really got crazy towards the end. I am a big fan of a good twist, but wow! What a truly unrealistic ending to what otherwise was an interesting, exciting read. It was almost like Baldacci attempted to wrap up his own story but quite figure out the best way to end it, so he just did so with some crazy explanation about who and why the bad guys were who they were.<br /><br />Baldacci's second John Puller novel \\"The Forgotten\\" was much better, well written and super entertaining. Go with that instead of this unless you are too compelled to start at the \\"Puller beginning.\\" A 3-star overall rating is generous for the way this book ended.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|Taking a viewpoint from an autistic academic makes for a fascinating and original novel.  Nice to have a weird but likeable central character  as you follow his adventures in his quest for a wife.  All the participants are well thought out and the list of essentials for a wife, which is finally completely disregarded, is very amusing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book left me scared with bitter taste for kind of love that can bring a human being in such dehumanized condition. Be aware of desire to control and inability to lose... If you are considering infidelity and you are a man read to get desensitized..
B0044C5SCU|5.0|If you like sci-fi type shows, this is a great one. The casting was perfect for the series and Anna Torv really made the show what it was. I just wish it was still running!
B009IUH1N2|4.0|it's pretty good but i don't  understand in endless mode how to get past the hanging vines or the rocks. can't  dash through it and can't go under..... so u just die. and you can't get achievement if u die..... other wise story mode is fun and keeps me entertained for a while
B003SQVI54|1.0|Only watched a few episodes, then deleted the show from my Amazon library.  Pathetic.  Not worth the time to watch unless you want to see  actors and actresses waste their respective talent on drivel disguised as humor.
B008393Q2O|3.0|Desperately needs multiple device (phone, tablet, desktop) synchronization and collaboration functionality. A cross between this and Wunderlist would be a truly killer note app.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|The whole movie seemed to be Lincoln sitting in a room preaching. Daniel DayLewis did a great job as Lincoln.
B002BVYBC4|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my fiance. She loves the series and now has all the movies. You can't beat a Blu-ray!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I have grown up a fan of all the great fantasy worlds, from the Legend of Drizzt to The Lord of the Rings to the Dark Tower series, and after reading this, as well the sequel, I can say with certainty that I have found my new favorite world.<br /><br />The magic system is believable and holds up to scrutiny, the characters have distinct personalities and are all-around well developed, and the ideas presented as being part of the world's history are solid, not &#34;gimmicky&#34; or made up in 10 seconds like so many other fantasy novels seem to be.<br /><br />If you love to feel truly immersed into the world(s) of your fiction novels, you should pick this up.<br /><br />SPOILER:<br />I have read some other reviews of this series, some of which claim that the narcissism of the main character detracts from the quality of the novel, and I must disagree wholeheartedly. Kvothe may believe that deep down that he is the greatest person to have existed, but that in itself is one of his many flaws that seem to get him into trouble so frequently, not to mention that he has REASON to feel confident in himself, as he actually is adept at a great many things that set him apart from most other people.<br />Yes, the series has a few hiccups just like any other, but they are so minor in comparison to how immersive the story is as a whole that I can confidently say: this a A New Favorite.
B002BVYBBK|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my fiance. She loves the series and now has all the movies. You can't beat a Blu-ray!

B005KR6OBM|5.0|I was very impressed with my products. The cds were in a very good shape and had no scratches. Thank you very much.
B00005JLKB|5.0|It delves into the beginnings of the superman life and his struggles to find himself in the small farming community of smallville.  I enjoy watching Tom welling act out the blunders of being a teenager in love with the high school beauty queen.  All in all it is a great series appropriate for the whole family!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Captivating book written by Stephen King as if the character has a do over in the time that JFK was President and subsequent murder.
0525953728|5.0|Great description of the inside of a seal. Americans should definitely read this, so everyone can feel the pain our armed forces men and women feel. For Mark Owen to go through hell and back is a little disturbing to read, however, I do not agree with some of the information given to the public. Even though the mission was finished when he wrote the book, some information about where, when and how...should have “stayed classified&#34;.
1935597760|5.0|Read this book in two days. I couldn't put it down. I felt for the main character and found myself praying for his \\"Happily Ever After\\".  Sad story, good ending.
B004SUDQ8Q|5.0|Great movie, close to the book. Great inside look at Australia’s Aboriginal<br />Lifestyle. Everyone should read the book and see the movie.
B007U8U1V8|5.0|A long time fan of The White Stripes, I have continued to follow Jack White through all his various Supergroups, with varying levels of enjoyment.  This is my favorite effort of his since The Raconteurs.  Simply an amazing talent that continues to impress.
1451629184|5.0|Jaycee Dugard will never be the same, and it is a shame that there are many others like her going through this kind of experience. Everyone should read her book, to make sure this will not ever happen to them. Parents should be aware of their children’s needs. Had her mother not been with such a selfish man, Jaycee would have never gone to hell and back. A story to share with the entire family.
B00C27LB20|5.0|Great lyrics and soulful music.  This kid is truly wise beyond his years.  By far the Best new Album of 2013.
0545265355|5.0|i love how close to reality the book is in a sense of war and probability (: everything that i wanted to deny happened just because it was the most likely  thing that would happen. After reading the whole series, you can see a lot of foreshadowing and subtle details that hint on what is to happen next. the best part, is that it's not your every day, happy ending, happily ever after story.  its a perfect ending for someone in a rebellion, war, torture, etc. definitely worth the buy.
B00280LYIM|4.0|A good book. Not as good as its predecessors but still good. It needed more detail/explanation. On to the next!
B007Y36K46|3.0|I've seen worse but it was closer to Flash Gordon than Avatar/StarWars in terms of quality.  The visuals all felt like ripped off scenes from Star Wars.  They even Disney-fied a monster into an annoying Labrador Retriever like character.  Ugh.  Ultimately it was just a very expensive B movie.  If you've seen Flash Gordon then you've seen this.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 7yr old loves playing this game. He can now play this game on the go!  He loves to build things
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Very entertaining... I would recommend this game as far as puzzle/picture search games go. The story line was well played out and the games were challenging.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|I enjoyed this movie very much.  I wanted a movie that would be enjoyable, free of violence, constant bad language, take my mind off my problems.  I'm a fan of Harrison Ford so that was another plus.  I would recommend it to those who just want something with humor and nice story.  It's not an award winner by any means, but I rated it a four star because it was fun to watch.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This is the third dual port port car adapter I have tried and the only one that does what I was looking for.  I am now able to have the iPad charge and operate at the same time as my phone and both will charge while in use.  This is great for the the trips with the kids since it will charge the iPad even while it is on and playing video / games / etc.<br /><br />The other models I have tried will charge (slowly) the iPad.  When using the iPad with the other models, the iPad would lose charge on long road trips because there was not enough current coming out of the adapter.  With this model, the iPad is on and charging while being used and the phone is also charging.<br /><br />One thing to note, there are two ports on the adapter.  One is for the iPad (labeled Apple) and the other for phones (labeled android).  They are both standard USB ports and will charge devices on both ports.  However, if you plug the iPad into the non-Apple port, it will not the full 2A needed to operate and charge the iPad.  I always keep the cables in place, but I switched them to see what would happen.  It does not hurt the phone to plug it into the Apple port (and depending on the model, it may charge faster on the Apple port).<br /><br />Excellent product.  I am looking at getting another one for my wife's car.<br /><br />Anker gave me this product in exchange for my honest feedback.
B0098460O4|5.0|I love every single song on the cd.  I play it every day. I love their voices.  I would recommend it to those who enjoy the music of Andrea Bucielli, Josh Groban, Sarah Brightman, etc
B0092EE5HY|5.0|These stories are just brilliant. Central character Tuf is seemingly naive yet genius, with a deadpan demeanor. I deeply identify with his love of animals and frustration at the lack of logic displayed in civilization! Martin presents a fun but surprisingly thought-provoking collection of tales, each a blast to read.
B0043KK4N6|5.0|The beauty of this music cheers me up every morning and night! Strongly recommend to buy this movie and its soundtrack!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Every woman needs a little Christian Gray! My sister recommended these books to me and I finished reading them before her. After she was done she called me and asked me to help her find a Christian Gray. Great reading even if you think it is more than what you can handle!

B007J4T2G8|3.0|I had high hopes for this book given the controversial discussions that have occurred over the last year or so. I thought it was ok but it was poorly written. I enjoyed the edginess of the &#34;romantic&#34; scenes and thought people had severely overreacted when they were discussing the book. I didn't think they were that over the top or racey but I also read romantic novels quite often and just thought it was different than what I normally read. What I hated about the book was the author did not develop the characters enough and was so repetitive! If I had to read one more time &#34;the telltale sound of the foil ripping&#34; or he pulled a &#34;foil packet from his pocket&#34; I was going to hurl my book at the wall. The author would fixate on a phrase or word and use it over and over and over again. It's a good easy read and the content is definitely unique to the romantic fiction genre but the writing was very poor.
B008EQIEWS|1.0|I didn,t purchase this this item I never ordered this item nor did I receive it.Further more I dont care about the dam TIP,S AND GIUDELINES yOU PEOPLE ARE GIVEN ME!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really cool and a fun and funky way to take time to do it teaches. Kids fast relaxes and hand eye cordanation and great way to increase. How well you stay focused also how fast you reacting to what's happening on the screen and that's how I see it and have fun playing :) :p
0345495004|5.0|Enjoyed this book & the resulting discussion at our book club. It presented the history of these people in a very interesting way.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|Bought this to sharpen the cold steel magnum kukre machete, and sharpened it but it would not hold the edge
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This was a pleasant surprise.  It was a very realistic look at the challenges involved with space travel.  I highly recommend it.
B005BRS8Z6|2.0|Quick read kind of inspirational but put so plainly I felt it was written for children. It also felt religious at times which wasn't what I was looking to read
B006AZZPCM|4.0|This app is quite good and does the work although there is room for improvement.<br /><br />UI is somewhat intuitive but some aspects of the user interaction should be revamped. The grayish semi-transparent icons/shortcuts on the bottom of the screen are hard to notice at first. There are many different options out there in terms of how menus/options can be better organized/displayed to the user.<br /><br />The main menu could be better too but it's not that bad.<br /><br />Overall if you need to download YouTube videos, I recommend this app.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|This book provides a very poignant and honest story about the life of a great innovator- Steve Jobs. It left me with a neutral impression of his personality but awed at what he was able to accomplish. I now have the insights about the technologies that I use everyday.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|Very thought provoking and well retold .  I couldn't put it down  ; l literally read it from beginning to end in one sitting
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This collection is amazing. Not only is it an excellent series to watch, but you get so much with this set. Blu-Ray, DVDs and you get a free digital copy that you can load to iTunes or VUDU.  I would recommended this to anyone (old enough to watch the show, of course).<br /><br />My order was pre-release but came very shortly after the release date with free shipping.  Please don't be confused by those reviews that say this is just a series of &#34;clips&#34; from the show. It is the full second season!
0547848412|3.0|I expected more of a page turner....but I look forward to seeing the movie.  I'm not ordinarly a fiction reader, but since this movie won awards, thought I'd read the book first.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|I've had my case for over a year.  It is very physically drop-protective relative to its bulk, and has protected my phone from minor liquid spills.<br />Faults:<br />It dampens sound significantly, requiring you to open the charger hatch to let you hear at full volume.<br />The switch on the side that covers the phone's \\"silent mode\\" switch is nearly impossible to get to work.  You will be lucky if after 20 tries of snapping the case together and then unsnapping it if you get it to seed properly. Then even when you do it is very difficult to toggle this switch.<br />The charger port really only accepts the small stock iPhone plug. Anything longer or larger, which most other charging accessories are, will not fit.<br />The plug that covers the earphone port screws out and is in no way attached to the case: high potential for loss.<br />Finally, after a year, the rubber around the screen protector is coming off, making it no longer waterproof in these areas, and the plastic flip-back cover for the charger (the one mentionec above that you are always having to flip open if you want to hear music or video at a decent volume) has cracked and part has broken off: all through what I would consider normal, mild wear-and-tear.
1616550414|5.0|This book is simply amazing.  The amount of stuff collected into this book is enough to keep you busy for a long time.  The one downside is it took so long to hit stateside that it feel a little dated with its strong focus on Skyward Sword.  But for the price this book can't be beat.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|The more you hear the songs, the more they grow on you.  DB has always been a genius and a true artist.
B00BBI9WD6|5.0|After having read this serios over in part many years ago and in whole 5 or 6 years ago finally finding that this series was on the kindle was a big deal for me<br /><br />Like always this series does not disapoint it is a clasic technical focused space drama. A combination of fantastic plot development and a whole host of memorable charicters the pace, detail and drama are such that I litterally could not set this book down<br /><br />This book like the rest of the series is a must read
B00APOSIEQ|5.0|May be little slow for experienced programmer but very careful explanation with attentions to exceptions.  Great help in understanding the issue of compliance with CSS3.

B00881VLCE|3.0|The Kindle version of this app is missing some of the features that are available on the iPad version like the free puzzle of the month where you get a new puzzle for each day of the month and the scoring system that lets you know which puzzles you've completed. It also will take you completely out of the app when it decides to randomly start an ad.

B00AHTYI5M|5.0|I saw this in theaters - and loved it. So I bought it. I liked it, and I put a ring on it.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|I only gave this book one star because I had to to write a review! It was a really awful book and I would never recommend it to anyone! Not worth the time to read it and definitely not worth putting on a kindle!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is amazing. I started playing it the minute I downloaded it. I just have one advice if they could have different themes each month but otherwise it is AMAZING.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a great app.  I love how bright the light is.  Doesn't seem to burn up my battery that much.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I was surprised with this book. I had a friend that was reading it and she said she loved it. I was skeptical initially due to it being Nicholas Sparks, he is a good author but sometimes I need more than a little love to read about. This book was great!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  It kept me involved for hours and hours.  The graphics are awesome!  The mini-games are fun with the right amount of difficulty for me.  I highly recommend this game.  It was worth buying to continue playing.

B009HUB40Y|4.0|Very challenging and similar to Bejeweled 2. Fun but too many interupting ads! Nice game to waste time and be entertained.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Funny, movie but definatly for the older croud. I would say 17-22yrs age. It has sexual humor and alot of language so beware.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really loved this book with all its twists and turns, and written from both the main characters of this book! The biggest problem was the ending!!!
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I enjoyed this game immensely.  It was creepy but managed to hold my attention thoroughly.  Waiting on the sequel with bated breath.  Great story and graphics.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|This for my money is still Bowie's last consistently great album. He abandoned much of the strong hard rock found on this album with the slick pop music he would make starting with &#34;Let's Dance.&#34; This album lacks the commercial appeal of its successors and it is all the better for it.<br /><br />Much of the music here actually contains a health dose of emotion and even some primal screaming (see &#34;It's No Game&#34; for the latter and &#34;Ashes to Ashes&#34; for the former). Bowie's personal life was still difficult with a divorce and drug addiction to cope with and you do get a sense that there's some personal venting going on here. I for one feel this strengthens the quailty of the music.<br /><br />Robert Fripp from King Crimson guests on &#34;Scary Monsters&#34; &#34;Up the Hill Backwards&#34; and &#34;Fashion.&#34; Pete Townshend guests on &#34;Because Your Young.&#34; While Brian Eno has nothing to do with this album, much of the ground work laid out during their collaboration continues here. The only element missing is the atmospheric over production. The music sounds like a logical progression from &#34;Lodger&#34; but with more accesible songs. &#34;Fashion&#34; is pure pop, &#34;Up The Hill Backwards&#34; and the second version of &#34;It's No Game&#34; have pop elements.<br /><br />A solid cover of Tom Verlaine's &#34;Kingdom Come.&#34; Tom Verlaine was the leader of the New York based punk band Television and the idea of a mid 80's Bowie covering such a song is impossible to fathom. This and the title track make this album memorable for me.<br /><br />The reason you should seek out the Ryko version is for the rerecording of &#34;Panic in Detroit&#34;, a studio version of &#34;Alabama Song&#34; ,a new version of &#34;Space Oddity&#34; and an instrumental called &#34;Crystal Japan.&#34; The music on the original album is good enough to want to have more songs included from the session and the bonus tracks do not detract from the value of the original. Some of these RYKO releases contain rerecordings from a different era and remixes. These bonus tracks are from the period of the rest of the song's sessions<br /><br />The mark of a great album is how well it holds up upon repeated listening. This ranks with Ziggy Stardust, Hunky Dory and Station to Station, arguably Lodger as being in that category (I'd include Heroes and Low once one gets accustomed to the instrumental tracks).in rerecordings from a different era and remixes.

B000B8IA2G|5.0|i miss the show. u should sse the show. so buy it. i give it an att. cool cool cool
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is awesome! But sometimes on my Kindle it crashes but I just log back in. For those of you who think you need Facebook you really Don't just click the X on the top corner. You should really get this game I recommend it.
1609611543|5.0|here we go again, one more diet  we will see what happens, been reading, will have to make some real life changes
B008602KQI|5.0|it is a very interesting movie and it will keep your attention Jennifer is a good actrist and she got the prize for it
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is the best show I have seen in a LONG time. It seems like a very serious and boring show (that's what I intially thought it was like), but after watching it I realized there's a bit of wit and humor on this show. The drama is not overwhelming and I like that. It is just perfect! I love it!! I would recommend this show to everyone. Give it a chance, it gets better and better!
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is one of the best Bond films ever made.  Full of action and a great story.  Bond's adversary is the toughest one he has ever faced, with a legitimate bone to pick.  This film should have earned a Best Picture Oscar nomination, as well as Best Supporting Actor for Javier Bardem nomination...alas, the academy didn't give the film or actor get a nod.
B0000024JN|5.0|Beastie boys...that's all that needs to be said. Open it up and listen to it. A great deal compared to buying it online elsewhere.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I'm not gonna go into detail here. It's Peter Jackson directing, Martin Freeman as Bilbo, and of course the amazing Ian McKellen once again. Add in Andy Serkis, Aidan Turner, Richard Armitage, and Cate Blanchett...... You cannot go wrong. I've read the book 100 times since I was little. Yes, there are some changes, but they are all for the better and I think Tolkien would have approved. Can't wait for the next film.
B004DNWPY4|4.0|You should read this book, it has a lot of info and can only help you with your situation. Do it today.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I know, I know, everybody who loves the musical hated the movie. Except me. I loved this! And I'm a vocal peformer and love music.<br /><br />Anne Hathaway was AMAZING. Seriously, she stunned me. And you may not like Hugh Jackman's singing voice but you'll love his acting. He and Hathaway actually made me cry. I don't cry at movies. Amanda Seyfried was OK in the acting department, but her lovely soprano voice was a total shock.<br /><br />Aaron Tviet, the guy who plays Enjolras, is absolutely incredible. His voice is gorgeous AND he's easy on the eyes. If you only watch the film to see him, well, it'd be worth it.<br /><br />Apparently the technique they used to film this was to have the actors sing live, with just a pianist accompanying them in an earpiece, and then they added the orchestral arrangements after. It worked.... The raw emotion in this film makes up for the (sometimes) unimpressive vocal performance. (I was not a fan of Russel Crowe's singing voice, but his performance was riveting.)<br /><br />Sacha Baren Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter were PERFECT in &#34;Master of House.&#34; And the little girl who played young Cosette was just.... wow. Same with the little boy who played Gavroche. Some real talent there.<br /><br />All in all I would say this was a beautiful film, and YOU SHOULD WATCH IT.
B000000XB9|5.0|This is a great album. Unfortuneatly this is the third time I've bought it. The two cds I bought before keep disappearing so I finally uploaded it to my itunes account.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Pros:<br />Heavy, hard plastic<br />Hardware included<br />Only need one per Maglite<br />Holds securely<br />Feels hefty and nearly unbreakable.<br /><br />Cons:<br />None<br /><br />Not much one can say about these brackets. They are easy to install--I used double sided foam tape--and work as advertised.
B00BBW16HW|5.0|It moves from a rough sketch of predictable characters to a subtle transformation in both that changes both of their lives...while one thinks he is helping the other and vice versa. It smacks a little of the French socialist tendencies...&#34;if you'll only give the guy a chance he will be good&#34;...but for the most part the very real portrayal of the developing relationship overshadows that. Worth every minute and every dime.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest in any form I can get it. ON the kindle, on the phone, on the computer....Pinterest is a huge time suck, but I am always inspired by what I find! Love!
B002C4YYEU|4.0|Not a movie I would watch again and again...<br />I'm glad I saw it; it's definitely worth seeing.<br />Breathtaking, well done.<br />Just not a personal favorite.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|A lot of people are checking out this book after the recent musical movie release. That's good.<br /><br />This is a timeless classic. Very moving.
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|you have to be on line to play and my grand daughter can't get on line with my kindle when i visist
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|I'd rather play the original. I'm a stick to the basics kinda girl. My kid liked it better than I did. So I guess it wasn't totally a loss.
B005IQZB14|4.0|while I could never have done what Chery Strayed did, I am fascinated by individuals who undertake such a challenge. And as a mental health professional, I am also intrigued by the personal story and motivation for such an adventure.  I though the book was well written.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|If you liked Angry Birds, then its kinda cool to see the pigs in another game. My kid and I both enjoy it. Very different from Angry Birds, which was a surprise and a plus.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I really like this one there are lots of choices to calm your mind and relax good music and sounds.
B0000931QA|5.0|The CD arrived on time and in very good condition. The price was great and the CD is excellent. I am enjoying it very much.
B005LAII12|5.0|A very funny movie, highly recommend to anyone with a good sense of humour. A real escapism comedy with some heart wrenching scenes too.
B00000272N|5.0|The Alice in Chains CD Facelift was packaged well, arrived on time and plays very well. It is a great CD, very enjoyable!
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|good, fun, makes you think fast; would recommend to anyone who likes a fun fast game w/extra few minutes to waste
B0000028M7|5.0|I lost my original copy and happy to get this to replace it.  It was a Great price and quality!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|sorry, no can do to add more words as requested  if this is not enough then I'm quit trying to give you my opinion
B009JBZH54|5.0|The Dark knight Trilogy arrived on time and in great shape. It was priced very well. I have really enjoyed all of the DVD's.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|I like games that make you think quickly. This game does exactly that, but it's not much fun. It's rather boring, actually.<br />Not to mention you only have a certain amount of &#34;lives&#34; you get to play this game. Once you've used up your lives, you have to either wait for them to recharge or you have to buy more.<br />And I'm also really tired of this app asking me to connect it to my facebook account. No, I don't want to connect it to my facebook. Stop asking me!
B00355L2TU|5.0|I've done p90X, I run regularly and go to the gym but I wanted to try a short at home dvd for the days I don't have a lot of time. I got great results and am so much healthier/stronger. This is a wonderful dvd and contrary to what other people said I didn't really get that bored listening to Jillian. On the days where I didn't want to turn on the dvd (when I was in the last few days of a level), I had pretty much memorized the dvd so I would do the workout on my own using a timer for all the exercises. Such a great workout and would be good for beginners because she offers modifications for a lot of the exercises.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|This book is my favorite book of all the twilight saga, it made me cry. It's totally worth it :) i recommend it for everyone.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I love this series and love that I can watch it whenever I wish.  It is something that everyone should see.
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you travel you know how boreing it can get and how it can seemingly take forever! If so&hellip;take out your tablet or phone and start a game of solitaire. and badabing your at your destination.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  Although it can be a little slow at times, it keeps your interest.  The story lines of the characters, both the family  and the servants are enthralling. I just can't wait for the next episode. There is scandal, drama and even comedy. It is a must see!
0385333846|5.0|I am glad that I read this book now and not when I was in high school.  It meant a lot more to me now.  As I've aged and lost loved ones and witnessed war after war, everything in this book was relevant and thought provoking.<br /><br />\\"That's one thing Earthlings might learn to do, if they tried hard enough:  Ignore the awful times, and concentrate on the good ones.\\"<br /><br />\\"Um,\\" said Billy Pilgrim.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I think that the game needs more accessible rewards... it's impossible to try for a goal unless you are willing to devote your life to the game. It is an overall fun game just needs more achievable add ons.
B000W4D94I|5.0|This movie has always been enjoyable to me.  I grew up in the midwest and know only too well the impact twisters have on towns and people.  I was in a twister myself while driving in Missouri and someone close sat through one that touched down on her house in Edwardsville, Illinois.  You never forget the sound or the shear power of the wind.  You could scream and no one hear you five feet away.  I bought the Blu-ray for the improved picture quality and sound and I am not disappointed.  The price for this exceptional upgrade in quality is well worth adding it to your library.<br /><br />CA Luster
B007REV4YI|5.0|We thought this was an awesome movie. The best yet. Very action packed. Would recommend this movie. As good as Sean Connery.
B00BSBU4EC|4.0|This was a nice show, made for kids but adults can find time for it also. It's easy on the mind.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This is one of the great movies that you hope people will watch for years to come.  We have watched it a couple of times already, and every time we notice something new.  Daniel Day-Lewis is outstanding in this role.
B00985E3UG|4.0|This book, which wears its biases on its sleeve, is an essential read for those wishing to understand how the food industry keeps us coming back for more as brands fight for ever increasing market share and revenue.
B005NPCUC8|3.0|Not the biggest fan, and this has got to be one of my least favorite albums. I guess the price was right when purchased.
B0067R0APK|5.0|Lots of weather info that can be accessed quickly.  It is easy to glide through the information and to change locations for those quick weekend getaways or to see the weather of a friend far away.
B00A2AU0KI|5.0|I am a huge fan of Clint Eastwood and love this movie.  Good story behing the title.  Excellent play on words.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I truly enjoy playing this game and I am very pleased that it is available for download on the kindle fire HD!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Great sequel  to Bared to You. Day is a terrific writer of erotic romance. Can't wait for the final installment in June.
B005DJREGQ|4.0|Funny makes me realize High school could have been much worst. Only issue is lots of drinking for high school show .
B00846REIS|5.0|So much better than the 50 Shades of Grey series! Couldn't put it down. Will read Day from now on.
B00BG4RLF6|5.0|Loved it so much.. He has a special, deep and unique style in music and he is a great vocal. It seems that James Blake will have a long and spectacular music career with flying colors.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Saw the PBS special and fell in love. Nothing like love songs in Italian. Can't wait to get more of Andrea!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I love my grimms version or fakery tales. This is a great PG rated version of them.  I've got to admit, aside fro. Game of thrones and Doctor Who ethos is my first choice
B004EBT5CU|5.0|My first experience with Adele and it was worth it. Her voice is lush and beautiful. Will buy many more.
B00BCMT4RA|5.0|This re-issue sounds great and the bonus cuts are a pleasure to hear.  AK was the best. When this was released not many even knew who he was - that changed dramatically. Can't go wrong with this.
B009IUH1N2|2.0|I do not recommend this game to you. The created basically copied of Temple Run... only worse. Nothing is chasing you. You think comics are good? Not this one, this one is worthless!!! The creator didn't take much time on creating this. He zoomed through it like no biggy. Like its no big deal!! Well it is!  kids need to play something that is worth buying or downloading!!!!!!! That is why I do not recommend this stupid, stupid idea of the creators idea to you.
B0083Z614S|5.0|A great book very interesting also very detailed .  I would definitely recommend this book!!!!! I'm glad this book was published
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|A great addition to my kindle. This book is a wonderful classic for any library. I would recommend this book to anyone.
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|One of the greats.  Mel is a film genius.  He knows how to make great films. This is a must see!
0061992860|5.0|Every one should have this book in their library, just in case. It is a book that you may need in the future.
0446572985|3.0|Baldacci always reads well - fast paced and entertaining. But this one, and it may be because I've watched too much tv, has some ridiculous dialog and actions for seasoned \\"spy/FBI/CIA/etc\\" characters. While I did finish it, and it was better than watching a Lifetime spy/FBI/CIA movie drama, Robert Ludlum he is not.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This book is a wonderful addition to any reader's library. I would recommend this book to any reader. The book came in a timely manner with no problems.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game great for kids and fun .  My kids are all about this game they love it .and I love  it to
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great book! I always buy my books through amazon. The book came in a timely matter with no problems. I would recommend this book for any reader.
0688014291|3.0|If you have commanded troops don't waste your time on this book.  If you are new to corporate leadership and management don't waste your time on this book.  If you want a simple bedtime read go for it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was an awesome book. Yes it did take time to read but it was worth it. Everybody at school has read it and I wanted to see if it was better than the movie, and believe me.............. IT WAS!!!!
B008YKGQR4|4.0|I really like the full face book for kindle fire. It gives me the same look and feel of face book on the computer. With my full face book for kindle fire I can keep in touch with what's happening in the world of social media.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I like it a little more than the other time I read it it is not a bad it it
B008ODZEQ0|1.0|GET THE Hi-DEF VERSION!!!! THIS WAS SO SO SO HARD TO WATCH... I have heard the movie is amazing, but the subtitles were literally impossible to read.
B001P9KR8U|1.0|When I put the movie in to watch it worked for about the first 10-15 minutes and then it quit working and just made alot of weird noises. Not sure why this movie didn't work properly??
B00004WEJZ|4.0|... is my favorite of the Bond men - I watch all of his movies - also like 007 :)
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|I agree with the other reviewers here with positive things to say about this movie, so I won't parrot them or reiterate.<br /><br />I think this is one of the few perfect movies out there.  The film is a smart, real (as in get real) character study about two mentally ill folks making it work.  I like to say it's dirty dancing with the roles reversed and everyone is crazy.  But for myself, especially, this movie has a really great meaning and message. The meaning is it can happen for you and the message is that love, and practice is what is needed.  The dancing in this movie is sublime.<br /><br />Cooper was perfect in conveying a real complex of anger, impatience and desperation to which I can say, watching this character is like I am looking in the mirror.  Except in the film, love is the thing that wins against this complex.  Maybe the silver lining is it can happen for you also, hence playbook.  I just need to find myself a Jennifer Lawrence.  Any of you happen have an extra?<br /><br />10 stars!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I love this series and can't wait for part 3 to be made available on DVD (don't have cable here)
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|for a kid this would be a great game but for adults it is way too simple.  not challenge at all!
B005YVTHT0|5.0|I played using a game pad in the past and was never really interested in a wheel set up. When I saw this online I jumped at that chance to have what filled the bill for me. A game pad that had the look and feel of an F1 wheel. At first it was hard to get used to and very frustrating to learn all of the buttons and shift paddles while holding this wheel in midair. It took about a week of picking it up, playing for a little while, putting it down and then coming back to it. It feels natural now, one key is that you don't extended your arms out in front of you. Watch any in car camera or pictures of a race car driver and you will see arms to the side, bent at the elbows and that is what makes this wheel comfortable. Keeping your elbows at your sides and extending from the elbows. Another key feature is getting the steering sensitivity set right. Setting the  steering sensitivity dial on the wheel to match you games wheel setup is key to enjoying this wheel. I use it on F1 2012 and i am glad I made the move away from the traditional game pad. This is a great addon if you what to use it on a laptop and need mobility. Just take time to get the steering setup and get familiar with holding it and you will be rewarded with many hours of gaming.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|I thought that this would be a different kind of read but it's still twilight in witch form. Lots of pages with nothing going on.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|My daughter loves this book and would not stop reading it! She brought it to school and read it at night! She now wants other books by her!!!!!
B0095MVOMC|5.0|Fun with a different spin on the HO game. Not too easy but not too difficult either.  I've been enjoying replaying it on the timed setting.  Nice pictures and no issues playing it on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9.
B003L77FYS|5.0|Why I chose this rating is because I was completely satisfied with the condition of the movie I ordered. What is like about it is that it was as described. Who I would recommend this to is anyone that likes this TV series as I do.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|The connection was no better than what I already had.  Still having the same problem, but has gotten worse.  Now it turns on/off & only sometimes does it actually charge.  I have lost all patience with my Kindle Fire.  There is no reason for me to even buy books anymore because the charge does not last long enough for me to even take it with me for reading purposes.  This is my third Kindle - same problem happens eventually each time.  Very disappointed in this product.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I chose this rating because I was completely satisfied with the condition of the DVD I ordered. What I liked about it was that it was as described. Who I would recommend this to is anyone that liked the Firefly series on TV.
B000FA6720|5.0|I have read this book many years ago when it was first written. I was so touched by this book that it brought me to tears. Such a great love story.Its a quick read but a story that is not quickly forgotten.
B00BGIC2J2|3.0|The movie was very funny, but as the movie goes on it gets more and more depressing. Maybe it's because I'm in my early thirties and I hope that's not what I'm in for... either way it was funny and had its moments.
B0090SI3ZW|1.0|How did they get so many good actors to do such a bad film? With so many beautiful and interesting films now coming out of China, you have to be on the look out for the stinkers. There was one a couple years ago with hatchet dancing Tong gangs and now this. Maybe I took this film too seriously, but bad is bad. Don't waste your money, I did.
B008M7JODC|5.0|This TV show is so addicting, I can't hardly go a day without getting my &#34;Fringe&#34; fix.<br /> Very well written and involving, Fringe is incredibly fascinating!
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|My friend really liked this show so I've been watching it. It is ok so far. I hope it picks up a bit in the next season as I find the main character to be a bit annoying.<br /><br />With that said, it is still better than the standard cop dramas on the networks so I am going to give the second season a chance.
B005LAII6C|1.0|I just realized my copy of paranoraman has a blank ultraviolet/itunes code.  there is no recourse.  lame.  do not buy the \\"digital copy\\" versions if you don't have too.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a very good game and it is very addictive j love how you earn money when your not on the game
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Back to the basic, with in depth characters a solid story and credibility.<br />It is also great to dust Fleming first books
0425263916|5.0|Without a doubt I loved this story!! It was great wish to read more. It was exactly what I was wanting to read
B00BBW16HW|5.0|This French movie touches the social inequities and will give you a new outlook on disabilities.<br />You will laugh and tear a little by those characters. I hope a US version will be realized to translate the overall humor of this movie.
1849904251|5.0|This is a great gift for the \\"Sherlock\\" fan in your life. (Or get it for yourself as a treat!) This could easily have been just a throwaway to cash in on the popularity of the show, but instead it's a great companion to the series. In addition to the genuinely funny post-it note banter (mostly between Sherlock and John, but Mycroft and Mrs. Hudson chime in as well), there are tantalizing details about each episode, background on the development of the new series, history about Arthur Conan Doyle and earlier depictions of Holmes, and much more. You won't want to miss a single page and make sure you don't because even the very last one is worth reading. I've heard there is a version that will be out soon for the American market, but I won't regret getting this one now.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|I loved this book and i love Don  - what a great character, fantastic dialogue. Please write another book soon!
B008MM9630|4.0|Kids like it. Fun to play the fairy life. Creative graphics. Bright. Colorful characters. Visually fun. Easy for little ones.
B00B0HXC4I|4.0|I'm all for satan and lucifer references, but these guys are balls out about it. The music, the vocals, the style, it's all amazing.
B000FA675C|4.0|The Da Vinci Code is an exciting, make-you-think type of a novel. Albeit, the conclusion can leave one feeling rather dissatisfied, it's a must read. Even if you're not a big fan of mysteries, you'll be hooked from the very start.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is Not a critical review.  I read \\"The Secret Garden\\" years ago, I think in sixth grade, and remembered liking it so I downloaded it to my Kindle.  I read right through this book and then read it again; very unusual for me to do that.  The books message about keeping sad or bad thoughts and feelings all the time making you unhealthy and miserable is something I think we all know can happen.  We need to be reminded every now and then that any ill, or sad, feelings and thoughts need to be pushed away and replaced with happier thoughts and good feelings to make us healthier and happier.  I think anyone from a fifth or sixth grader on up would enjoy and benefit from reading this book.  Try reading this book to a bed ridden elderly person.
B00A757EFW|2.0|Just didn't care for it I guess I was expecting arrows and not fully controlled w/ my finger. It would be nice to have either option.
B009POHHRG|4.0|I deeply enjoyed this graphic novel. There were twists and turns, a crematorium of the joker, and a truly menacing villain I am on the ropes about the ending but other than that this is a must have.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|I like it its not bad like some other games but it's a little bit hard otherwise it's a great games. I would not say it is addictive
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The artillery stops the combat from being a mindless brawl. Bit of a money pit if you want to play often.
B007MU85D0|5.0|My new favorite band. This album is a collective of smooth sounds. Every time I listen I like even more than before!
B008220B0C|5.0|It was great to see one of today's hottest pop princesses and the lookback of her very cute past. yay!
B007N8RULO|5.0|I really enjoy this app not only because it's free but it is not overwhelming with ads  or annoying gimmicks.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|The kids loved it . We would recommend this movie to others , funny , thank , you , JMH
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I loved playing it on my best friends ipad and ipod. but it would not let me download it on my kindle fire
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|This review might be a tad biased because this is my favorite musical, and I love Hugh Jackman, but seriously, it is a good adaptation of the show with good performances and cinematography.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It'll is a great game because you get to build, you can go under ground and mine all this cool stuff! It also has monsters ( which I agree are a pain because a bad time where there where monsters in my mine and I went completely nuts because I lost all  my stuff this game my stuff that I never found again ).
B0081336FO|5.0|Great writing / acting.  Characters are complex and well developed.  Story is respectful of the original, while being converted to a modern setting.  Interesting & entertaining without over-reliance on CG.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|This CD is a treasure.  Paul is singing old songs -- ones that his parents liked -- with innovative arrangements performed by a band made up of musicians who are solo performers in their own rights.  The voice is still good, and the renditions are charming.  It was made all the more enjoyable because I had previously seen a DVD that chronicles the rehearsals and recording of the CD.  I highly recommend it alsoi.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this series and you will too. It is filled with romance, death, life, cherished moments, life itself, sadness, grief, true love, protecting others, family, caring, and war. Once I finished this series I was crying (because it was over.)
B00785P2QC|4.0|wants u to spend real money; not me; not this guy; yo bad so sad; your dad; maybee next time
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I'm a GOT fan and would not think of missing one of the books but we must face the fact that Martin takes two hundred pages to say what he could have in just ten. There have been times I had to set the book down [due to boredom] and come back to it later which when you think of it is a good thing since it takes Martin years to release a new one.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Splashtop does what most other remote desktop apps cannot, it can actually stream video to your phone or tablet via a mobile/cellular data network.  This cancels out the need for so many desired add-ons for your mobile device like a tv tuner, vastly expanded storage for those without an external SD slot, and others.  If you have a tuner in you remote PC, you can watch your cable/satellite/OTA TV remotely.  I've yet to see a remote client that comes close to this level of functionality.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Mystery manor is fun and it has been great learning how to play it, my kids really like playing it too
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This is a awesome book maybe the best book I've ever read I recommend the book for everyone if you liked the Percy Jackson series you will like the heroes of Olympus series
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I was really moved by this book. I don't think I'll ever look at people in the same way. The way Greene describes people exposed a way of thinking that could be so obvious but is generally overlooked. I can see my relationships with people in a deeper way.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Pretty fun game. Ikr. Yo mama! So so suck my toe all the way to Mexico. Lol. Boxes and turtles
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Rarely if ever have I read a book that could so easily have been great but due to a small number of poor editorial decisions was merely entertaining. Rothfuss's writing skill is at virtually the top level; only a handful of contemporary authors can match him in his command of language, his pacing, his feeling for the right word. And in the character of Kvothe, Rothfuss had the opportunity to craft a truly brilliant yet realistic and mesmerizing - and original - story.<br /><br />Kvothe could have been one of the great heroes of the age, a Case or an Ender for this century. His genius and spectacular memory, combined with just a hint of fantasy, could have yielded deep and fascinating character studies.<br /><br />Rothfuss, instead of exploring the adventures and trials of a real Kvothe, swerved off into cliche. Not even good cliche, bad cliche. Hundreds of pages are devoted to a preposterous and entirely pointless subplot involving female martial artists (\\"not as rare as a creature as as some folk think\\", adds Rothfuss helpfully for readers who have not watched any movies since 1980) teaching Kvothe - Carradine-style philosophy. This has all been done in most martial arts movies, or at least most bad ones, since the 80s. It's not so much that Rothfuss has nothing new to add here (he brings his deftness to the written word) but Rothfuss fails to understand that to the extent he succeeds in this subplot, he fails. There are enough - more than enough - 1000 times more than enough - fantasy novels and movies whose plot points revolve on the martial arts prowess of the protagonist. Kvothe for a while was to have been someone different, someone who has real emotions, who succeeds through hard work and study. Not only does the whole episode read like a bad 90s movie script, but it trivializes Kvothe as a real character. Kvothe is already superbly skilled in several ways, not to mention  a master of magic. Throwing martial arts in there makes him a cartoon. And it's entirely unnecessary besides - Kvothe was plenty dangerous enough in hand-to-hand combat with his magic.<br /><br />Another long, long digression has Kvothe staying with a Siren-style faerie in a plot development done a thousand times before, that serves no particular purpose except to get him a fancy jacket that is too close to an Invisibility Cloak - Kvothe shouldn't need such props! Again, this just trivializes Kvothe and makes the character far less sympathetic to any post-adolescent reader. Rothfuss, despite his undeniable gifts and talent, seems completely unable to write a female character that is not so caricatured as to be ludicrous. Denna, in particular, is literally painful to read, she is so badly done - she serves a kind of Jar Jar Binks role here, giving the reader something to complain about, but Binks didn't harm the movie nearly as much as Denna destroys large parts of this book. For instance, Denna and Kvothe at one point discuss flowers endlessly, with so many terrible, trite images it reads like Rothfuss gave the passage off to some student. \\" `Oh' Denna sighed, looking around with wide eyes. Under the bower, her skin was brighter than the moon.\\" This goes on for pages, and pages, and pages, all despite Denna's being insufferable and her dialog with Kvothe completely absurd for him.<br /><br />In a poignant and infuriating slap in the face to his readers, or at least his adult readers, Rothfuss via Chronicler alludes to a brilliant legal strategm that Kvothe used to gain his acquittal in a legal trial. That would be exactly the sort of action that would be fully in accordance with Kvothe's character, and it would be profoundly original besides. But the episode gets a paragraph, it is glossed over, to make more room for 300 pages of cheesy martial arts philosophy and another 300 of Kvothe mooning over his latest girlfriend. Rothfuss could have included the trial, he had the story, it would be have been brilliant and new, but he dangles it out in front ofhis readers like a guy tormenting his dog with the aroma of filet mignon before feeding him the same kibble the dog gets every day of his life.<br /><br />So, I think Rothfuss has indeed succeeded in ruining, or at least of maiming, what should have been a great character.<br /><br />But because Rothfuss is an extremely skilled writer, there is still much to like in the book.<br /><br />One highlight is an intricate structure of nested stories, at one point a story in a story in a story in a story (the beggar's story, chapter 37). There is also a meta-story in a story in a story in a story at one point (Shehy/99 stories tale), and the stories and their containers or narratives constantly swirl about and impinge on each other. I have never seen any author (or director) treat the notion of narrative in narrative as seamlessly and as persuasively (Charles Palliser's Betrayals comes to mind, but that is just not as seamlessly done as the Rothfuss work).<br /><br />Because so much of the magic revolves on names, Rothfuss can do some pretty virtuoso authorial showpieces with names and words and narrative, and how the narrative affects and is affected by reality. His descriptions of Kvothe's struggles to name the wind are spectacular and rise to prose poetry.<br /><br />A few other irritations: at one point Kvothe commits arson inside a wooden inn out of some utterly pointless plan to irritate Ambrose or impress Denne (either motivation is absurd, and the real victim in the plot is the innkeeper); but the author seems to think this is understandable, if not laudable. As I argued by the way in my review of the book, it was Kvothe, not Ambrose, who was mainly in the wrong anyway in their Malfoy-Potteresque scraps. Kvothe must have mentioned about eight times how he uses his trouper training to act polite or haughty or whatever \\"I had been raised on the stage\\" as he tells us too many times. There is also a problem where his co-mercenaries are overly impressed by some minor feat of sympathy twice in the same way (when he starts the fire and when he opens the box). He twice says that Ambrose's bed is as big as his room, too.<br /><br />Now for some great points. The character of Elodin is magnificent, another great character. The arrowcatcher is brilliant and brilliantly described. Auri is good as ever. Some lines: \\"Manet played with the precision of a gear-clock: no mislaid tricks, no wild bids, no hunches\\"; \\"Most things fail with age.\\"; \\"in real life old beggars are almost always old beggars\\"; \\"sunlight hard and bright as a bar of gold\\"; \\"Anyone can spot a piece of torn shirt hanging from a branch...they make for convenient plot devices in plays, but really, when have you ever torn your clothing so seriously that you've left a piece of it behind\\" [actually this whole section has an excellent description of tracking]; \\"What I had taken as a malicious crypticism on his part was actually a persistent urging toward the truth\\"; \\"Subjunctive mood...At best...it is a pointless thing. It needlessly complicates the language\\".<br /><br />I have no idea why so many authors seem to want to kill their own stuff. Steven King writes Salem's Lot, then 30 years later some unreadable novels. Gibson writes Neuromancer, then much later also becomes nearly unreadable. Ishiguro writes Remains of the Day, then decades later some dull stories. Spielberg goes from Jaws to Indiana Jones 4. Even in fantasy, Grossman wrote a really interesting character in The Magicians, then decided to veer off into soap opera. But here, this destruction of the character of Kvothe is the most egregious, as it was the most gratuitous.
B003LSTK8G|5.0|This is a true masterpiece.  An unvarnished look at the lie we let Wall Street tell us and sell us on a daily basis.  Michael Lewis nails it right between the eyes and doesn't pull punches.<br /><br />I'm astounded to learn that even the guys that called it exactly right- came away with real scars.  Nobody came out if unscathed except the teflon boys of the mega firms.<br /><br />This is a lesson worth learning.  It's speaks to our desire to abdicate responsibility and assume the people in charge have all of the answers and have effectively considered all of the implications.  The reality is that they are just responding to the perverse incentives that give them the money for letting other folks take the risk on their risky bets.  Any investor (heck any  taxpayer) will benefit from reading it.
B004J4WLPU|4.0|With a mind boggling twist at the. end. Very good writer - I plan to read her next book too.
1250012570|4.0|This is one that I learned about via social media alone.  So many lovely people have raved about this book that there was no way I wasn't going to give it a try.  Eleanor and Park are unlikely love interests.  Eleanor is the new girl with nowhere to sit on the bus, so she sits with Park and after some awkward silences a friendship grows out of interest in comics and music.  It quickly turns to romance and their relationship must weather Eleanor's family issues, which are HUGE, and the insecurities of both.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book.  It was a love story for introverts.  I loved that so much of interaction between the two is in silence, especially in the weird \\"getting to know you\\" and \\"feeling you out\\" phase.  I love that they communicated through music - Rowell has excellent taste BTW - and comic books.  The references to 70′s and 80′s pop culture kept me smirking as I read - Solid Gold, El Debarge, The Commodores (yep, did anyone else catch that one besides me?) - and it kind of felt like this was the YA book written for all the actual adults who lived through those decades.<br /><br />Both Eleanor and Park have interesting back stories and unique voices, which is important since they each narrate alternately.  Eleanor's is quite painful and my hand was itching to call CPS throughout her chapters.  Park's life wasn't perfect, but certainly a lot happier, and sometimes provided elements of humor is what could've been a very dark story.  And the ending!  Rowell knows how to keep you sucked in to the very last word.  I am curious if this is really end end of their story if if their might be a sequel down the road.<br /><br />I found this to be a very engrossing and moving book - it moves slowly in some places and is a very quiet story, but a beautiful and truthful one.<br /><br />4/5
B009CPJHY4|4.0|A brilliant ensemble cast of veteran British actors make this film a satisfying movie experience. if you are looking for action you will not find it here but if you are looking for acting it is here in abundance. This film will not appeal much to the highly desired 25-49 year old advertsing demographic; Its core appreciative audience will tend in age to mirror the characters in the film. Us older lot! The story lines are muti-layered and inter-connected. The action moves at a gentle yet interesting pace. The characters and their relationships develop and their observations of and coping with getting older ring true to life. The actors, all household names in the UK, with long and distinguished careers in myriad of different roles demonstrate clearly that they have lost none of their acting skills in their &#34;golden years.&#34; If you enjoy watching a good story, well filmed and beautifully acted settle back and watch. You will not be disappointed.<br />Alex
B00B2G4O2G|4.0|I'm about halfway through the season (upon the recommendation of several friends), and we're enjoying all of the plot turns. But I think you have to suspend belief at a lot of what goes on or you'll drive yourself crazy. Even the whole premise requires this - why weren't Joe's conversations with his visitors while in prison monitored? I mean, they monitored George Zimmerman's phone calls and found out he had more money than he claimed, but they won't monitor a convicted serial killer??? I understand attorney-client privilege, but seriously? Maybe this gets explained in subsequent episodes, but this does put a little bit of a damper on my rating. For sure, it's not Homeland (which had some of its own inconsistencies).
0385344228|1.0|I absolutely hated this book.  The only reason I finished it was because it was for a book club.  Very little character development.  Not one redeeming character.  Dumb ending.  Would have been interesting if it was from the point of view of both parents.
B00BHU9BV6|4.0|At first, the modern music took me back & I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie. I've read the book & have seen every movie, so I wasn't so sure about this version of Anna Karenina.  However, I am so glad I stuck with the movie, because it was very, very good.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Saw his tv- documentary on the subjet, thought it would work for me. So, I bought the ebook, read it on the flight SFO to FRA and started the program when arriving. Suits me well, no problems with the asting days, no over-eating. Been enrolled now a month, 6 pounds off and 2-3 inches off. Will continue.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|I was very disappointed because it made no sense. The wizard of oz will always be my favorite movie. Every since I was a child.
B004SKJTY6|5.0|This is a great film--a wonderful story and outstanding performances by Colin Firth and Helena Bonham Carter.  I saw it in the theater first and had to watch it again.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Allows me to keep my brains young while thinking about the moves I need to make without the help of the hint button.
B0047685I2|5.0|Drew Barrymore does so well in the Cinderella adaptation.  I have loved this movie since I saw it in the theaters and it's in my top 5 favorite movies of all time.  Well done and a story every girl can appreciate!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A true, scary tale of heroism and service to country!  My husband read it voraciously, and even read sections aloud to me.  He is telling all his friends about it.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I has never paid much attention to Linkin Park until I stumbled across them on Pandora last summer (2012). I would have recognized a few of their biggest hits, but I probably couldn't have named the band. Fast forward a few months, and I've listened to every song from every Linkin Park numerous times. And while I like Hybrid Theory a lot, and love Meteora, Minutes to Midnight is from front to back my favorite album of the bunch. I'm much less enamored of A Thousand Suns and Living Things.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best season yet!!!  Absolutely LOVE Walking Dead.... can't wait for season 4! I may have to start over with season 1 to get me through!
B005DJREJS|5.0|i adore the characters, even though sometimes the supporting actresses are over the top. better than any reality tv show MTV has crapped out. ever.
0812550706|1.0|Ender was the most persistently dismal kid I've ever encountered in literature or life. True, he was persecuted at home and school, but this sad sack triumphed time and again. Get over your Charlie Brown blues, Ender.<br />Those who gave this unremittingly repetitive novel 5 stars must have been more empathetic or simply enjoyed the male-dominated world of his war games. Neither was the case here. Having read the book as a primer for the Harrison Ford movie, I'm not even sure I'll see it now.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|I have always been fascinated by the movie, but the book has some very distinguishable differences (which is normally the case). In this case, though, I prefer the movie.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Well worth the price (wasn't looking to spend a lot, and BOY are there a ton of **expensive**choices out there!!). Keeps the Kindle securely locked in, and I like the versatility of the different propping positions. Was looking forward to the hand strap on this - but don't use it......its at an awkward position making it uncomfortable to use.<br /><br />Contrary to other reviews, you do NOT have to have the case open to charge your Kindle - just swivel it around so the charging ports face AWAY from the case binding. (Duh....lol)<br /><br />Would purchase again.
B005HSG3TC|3.0|This product fits the kindle fire HD in a strange way...upside down. I can tell because when you first turn it on it takes a while for it to orientated and some apps only work right side up... keep in mind this is in regards to have the cover flap on the left like a real book. Also the  is already wearing down its finish after one months use. Not my choice but a good idea...
B005LAIIHG|5.0|This is a great movie. I read the book several years ago and enjoyed the story. I am thrilled such a great and unique book was made into a movie. I highly recommend the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I heard about this game on the web and could not believe how addictive it is. This game is a lot of fun.

B004GHNIRK|4.0|Soul searching novel. Excellent example of putting self aside. Inspirational and God centered. Makes you believe all is not lost with man. Hope.
B0052TDGQO|5.0|He has a great voice and music that makes him such a great singer. Everyone that I know, loves his voice. I suggest others to buy his music. Great, great, singer. Thank you. P.Tickle I am adding a few more words. He is on my list of favorite artist.I bought this CD from Amazon. I always go to Amazon for my items. After I sign of here I'm going to Amazon to buy more. They have such great buys. Thanks Pat Tickle
B0083F5JE6|5.0|The CD came very fast, and I love most of the songs on the CD!! Great CD for the price.
B000JMLFLW|1.0|Found it impossibly slow, difficult and boring reading....not my idea of a classic!<br /><br />I don't have 7 more words to say about it as required
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|From my friends and other reviews, I expected this movie to be an inspiration and spiritual story, but you hardly find anything inspiration or spiritual in it. It is a somewhat gruesome story of survival. The plot is interesting, cinematography breathtaking, and acting excellent, but after watching this movie, your do not feel an awe for the strength of human spirit that overcome tremendous challenges, or serenity of God's presence, surrender, understanding or even clarity. The movie leaves you feeling like a witness to a very traumatic, very gruesome, and very tragic situation with no hope really. Till the end you cannot distinguish fantasy of the main character from the reality of what happened, but that in itself is not a minus to the movie, its just facing a gruesome reality or facing the more beautiful and metaphoric view of the same reality, but nevertheless without hope or a presence of God.
B004NOH9LC|3.0|Hard to tell if Harrison Ford is playing himself or the character.  Nothing unexpected or surprising--formula all the way, but not too bad a way to spend a couple of hours.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|Can't put into words..this is a heartbreaking yet opens you're eyes to what s behind closed doors...great book must read
B007N8RULO|4.0|Provides enough challenge to keep you concentrated and occupied. Perfect way to sharpen your wits while relaxing.  Keeps you from thinking about your problems.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Can't wait to start Season 2. From the first show to the last one of Season 1 I was hooked.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I ordered 3 movies with British actors who I enjoy and this movie was the best of the bunch.  It was about an assortment of older British people who retired to a run down hotel in India.  The hotel was run by a young Indian man who had an overbearing mother who tried to run his life and shut down his hotel.  I found the movie charming and generally enjoyed it.  It was not a laugh a minute, but had its funny moments.  I will enjoy watching this one again.

B000ZN802W|5.0|One of my favorite movies in a really long time. Didn't watch it when it first came out but when I did it became a favorite.
B00007KWHN|4.0|A good introduction to progressive English rock scene of the seventies. Classical training, clarion voice work and moments of virtuosity.

Wonderful it was to be back in the Oval Office, and in the Situation Room with President Jack Ryan Senior. Wonderful it was to see Jack Ryan Junior developing and using his Skills. Wonderful it was to see John Clark planning to retire and back-in-action virtually instantaeously. Glad to have the details of Military Aerial Combat. Glad to see the development of the bed partner of Jack Ryan Junior thankfully transiently. Was she simply a Ninny or what? Ah yes truly a Ninny! Looking forward to many more \\"Tom Clancy\\" novels! Many more! Bravo Tom Clancy! Thank you Tom Clancy! A copy of this text should be in all of our City and County Public Libraries.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Haven't been able to stop reading since I started the Hunger Games. So many twists and turns. You never can figure what might happen next.
B00BSBXZDY|5.0|I only watched this movie briefly and over my shoulder at that, but the three little boys who did watch it sure were giggling a lot. What I did see was rather enjoyable.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I can spend hours playing this game.  I played with my children when they were younger and we always had a great time.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just started watching Downton Abbey and I am hooked! Great characters,storyline, acting, etc. never a lull or dull moment. Teaches a bit about early 20th century history in a natural way. Can't get enough!
B004WMCVXG|5.0|Very informative - good reading (with an open mind, of course). Appears all &#34;organized&#34; religions have their major faults. Maybe removal of the &#34;organization&#34; could be the answer; or, at least the radicals and ultra conservatives in each organization?
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|it works well. very easy to use and helps with homework. so nice and big buttons to use and big display.

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|its just so good and this is where it all gets started. great show all around worth checking out from the begining
B0088D3PYE|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the third installment of the cemetery of forgotten books. I have awaited another book in the series after reading angels game and I kept myself \\"busy\\" with midnight palace and prince of mist to get my carlos fix.<br /><br />This book was such a great read - mainly because my favorite character Fermin is back :) This book is not as suspensful as Shadow of the Wind, but it doesn't leave you with too many unanswered questions like Angels Game. It sort of made me think different about Angels game, as this book ties the two books together in a way. I still have questions about \\"The Boss\\" aka Andreas Corelli and I hope he writes a fourth book to give us some answers, but I guess that wont be happenning...
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Very intriguing. Some parts ie the time on the island a bit long and tedious, otherwise fictionally entertaining. Religion parallels were interesting.
B000PGNDM6|5.0|What an awesome book! I read this book and left it again to read some other books, but when I picked it up again, I started from scratch. I enjoyed reading this book. It wasn't an easy read, quite an intellectual read i would say... but very interesting.<br /><br />This book is an example of the times when I read a book I become extremely pedantic about the details up until a point that I want to make notes, I want to understand everything and I want to solve the puzzle too. I kept going back and forth throught the pages to \\"check\\" everytime a discovery is made. SOunds a bit too much, but i enjoy these type of puzzle books that plays with your mind. The story line in itself was intruiging too - I must say I expected a bit more detail about the book about the Nine doors, I think the story about that was more interesting than the Dumas manuscript. I would definitely recommend this book
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I think the game gets old, running the same old path and getting snatched up by the monster. But my nine year old loves it and could play it for hours, she also loves the Oz element.
B002VISN9E|5.0|I saw the movie a few times and absolutely love it, so I decided to pick up the book for a light read.<br /><br />The story is about Matilda, a little girl who is gifted with intelligence way beyond her years. At the age of 5 Matilda could master complex multiplications, read all the children's fiction in her local library and even works from authors such as Dickens. Only problem she has is her parents do not embrace her unique talents, in fact they are not even aware of it.<br /><br />The beginning of the book, or the first half, had me in absolute stitches! I loved this book! The description of the scenes are hilarious, I imagine a child sitting and chuckling along happily to this book.
B0049J3QNG|4.0|Super cute movie, I watched it with my girls and they loved. Our four year old, who never sits through a movie, sat through this one.
0143034901|5.0|\\"Few things leave a deeper mark on a reader than the first book that finds its way into his heart. Those first images, the echo of words we think we have left behind, accompany us throughout our lives and sculpt a palace in our memory to which, sooner or later--no matter how many books we read, how many worlds we discover, or how much we learn or forget--we will return.\\"<br /><br />This is how i feel about this book. Its amazing<br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading it and didn't want to put it down. It gripped me from the start. The book is filled with mystery, gothic atmosphere, romance and even laughter. Fermin is an absolute classic I couldn't stop laughing at the things he would say.<br /><br />I have already read this book twice and I can guarantee you I would read it again. I have blogged about it - and now alot of my friends are reading it too and they are loving it.<br /><br />Many times I have read books by foreign authors and while the story line is great, somehow the language is funny. I must say Lucia Graves translated this well. A good piece of literature! Well done Carlos.<br />And good job on the translation, Lucia - the languages just purrs along :)
B003JTHXOK|2.0|The book is predictable and sappy. Nicholas Sparks appears to be running out of good ideas. If you want to have something to read that will provoke no brain activity then you will be fine with Safe Haven.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is way better as a book than a movie.  I reccommend reading this book, even if you have seen the movie.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't  put it down can't wait to read the next book,  such an interesting series to read.  Hope the next one is as good
B00APUYWYA|3.0|It was an enjoyable movie.  Not great art but fun for group viewing which is how I watched it, at a family birthday party.
B00947N6D8|5.0|I bought 3 copies, 1 for each grandsons Easter basket, and 1 for me! We saw it at the movies, and loved it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I feel like all the time I put into reading this book and all the interest i put into the characters was wasted on the cop-out ending. Not clever or satisfying at all.
B000FA675C|5.0|This story doesn't get old.  I read it when it first came out and then again when the free digital version came out and its still great.  The pace is continuous...there's no &#34;boring parts&#34; to skip through.  The suspense is endless and the ending is still exciting.  Love this one!
B005LAIIGC|5.0|The walking eggs that came with the DVD were a hit with the kids. I think they enjoyed the eggs as much as the video.<br />This DVD comes with a real digital dowload to I tunes
0061950726|5.0|Orphan Train--a Novel by Christina Baker Kline has two main stories: (1) A 91-yr.-old woman tells of her young life of being on an orphan train. Her story is fantastic! and (2) A young teen girl who is now an orphan, describes what she is going through. Her story is very good. These two women are brought together and find they have more in common than they thought. I loved this book!<br /><br />Even when the story is finished, there is still an interview with the author, a story about orphan trains and questions for a book club . Make it a point to read Orphan Train; you will be glad you did!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I loved the book.  I hated that he actually helped her and then didn't follow thru with himself and was being punished.  I do believe they should have come up with a better solution than to take their own lives.
B000VUCIZO|5.0|This is the kind of read a software/hardware engineer like me loves.  I needed a break between classics and something to drop onto the kindle for a fun read.  It is not controversial and gets fairly technical for a mainstream book.<br /><br />I had fun,
B00C7JG0KG|5.0|My wife and I just saw this movie in 3D at the theaters.  This movie is really entertaining and enjoyable, the 3D in this movie was FREAKING AWESOME! I have seen many 3D movies over the past two years, but this one has used it to the full, and it was worth paying the extra to see it. I have never jumped out of my seat so much seeing a 3D movie before. I wanted to go see Jurassic Park in 3D, but my wife talked me into this one, and I was not disappointed. The movie itself was fun, and reminded me why I did like the Wizard of Oz when I was a kid. This is definitely worth going to the theaters and watching it in 3D, or even buying it on blu-ray.
0684803356|5.0|This copy of this great work came to me with a bonus.  I wanted to reread this on vacation and did not want to take my very good edition with me.  I needed a paperback to destroy. This one did the job and also who ever read it before me, did so for academic reasons, and the book had some interesting markups expanding on the Spanish civil war.  I found it to be a nice addition.
B005LLXB9K|5.0|This was a gift that I suppose was well received by the recipient, I never heard any negative feedback so it was good.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app to death I can save on printing and cut the time for having to read a entire page .
B000007MVD|5.0|What ever is done on the Beatles is generally eye and ear candy for any Beatle Fan, and this of course is no exception.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|This movie was kind of surprising. It just showed up on my recommendations and I decided to watch it but I was not let down Rachel was an absolute delight. and it had just a fantastic story.
B004HO6I4W|5.0|What a fun movie, just loved it, and my grandkids want to watch this movie more than any other ones.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Jillian is not lying when she says &#34;this is no joke&#34;. The only thing I was doing when I first finished level 1 was gasping for air and wondering &#34;why the heck did I decide to start working out again?!?!&#34; But seriously, as a new younger mother, being 5'9'' and 220 lbs. was devastating for me. I have been quite active my whole life and have an athletic build, but that was masked by baby fat and cellulite. I bought this DVD thinking &#34;ok, well, the worst that can happen is that I stay the same&#34;. I mean whats 20 minutes anyways? I'm going to be honest here... the first week of the workout was brutal for me. So brutal that I stopped doing it. I didn't think the pain was worth it. A few days later I weighed myself and... I lost 3 lbs...? How was that even possible? Those 3 lbs. gave me the motivation to suck it up and commit to making a serious lifestyle change with Jillian Michaels help. The DVD is only 20 minutes long, but in order to see results you really have to push. Jillian uses her 3-2-1 method (3 minutes stregnth, 2 minutes cardio and 1 minute abs). You repeat the 3-2-1 method twice for each leveled workout (3 intervals total). While doing certain intervals (for me it's the plank jacks and double jump rope in level 2) you really do feel like you cannot go on. If you are determined and disciplined enough and actually give it your all you WILL SEE RESULTS. It's been about two weeks that I have been really serious about this workout and I have definitely noticed a change in my body. I actually go to the gym in the morning to get more cardio in before I do the tape now. Level 1 is easy for me, and I never thought I would say that. I'm still on level 2, but I will be switching to level 3 in another 3 days. The only thing I would change about this DVD is the horrible background music. I wear headphones while working out to the shred now... I couldn't take the elevator music anymore. Even though I can't hear Jillian's voice motivating me, her death stare through the television is enough to keep me going! She really is an inspiration and an amazing trainer! Just know that you can't do a workout DVD and then go eat three cheeseburgers though. You have to eat healthy and clean to see maximum results (as Jillian states in the beginning). This DVD has changed my life! I'm now down to 206 lbs and have more energy than I have had in months! People have told me that i look like i weigh a lot less than i do, and ask me where i find the time to workout so much!! I'm not where I want to be but with Jillian's help I know ill get there! This DVD was/is a steal and I would recommend it to anyone that is serious about losing weight and gaining confidence. Overall I am beyond happy with my purchase.
B005D0RDIE|5.0|What can I say, it's RUSH - and they are so dog gone good.  I can never get enough of them.

B006LSZECO|2.0|I was really excited about reading this book. Enjoyed the story and the suspense but as the end of the book drew near- it started to lose continuity. It was a great, interesting story and I would recommend it. However, I would add a disclaimer that the end is crappy.
B000FA675C|4.0|This was a great book, well written and executed. I would recommend it to everyone to read and enjoy! Fantastic.

B000FA675C|5.0|I think this the best book of the Langdon series....intense....thrilling and full of extraordinary facts.....the buildup was great and great supporting evidence....Though I think Deception point is the best written by Dan brown this has to the best in historic thrillers
B002BWP49C|4.0|i got it for my friend for her bday but i liked it 2 not rly in2 the series myself but it was a pretty cool movie
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I resisted reading this book into now (I just couldn't do another series). I am so glad that I read this and am eager to read the next one.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This absolutely deserved its academy award for best documentary!  I bought the dvd and all his recordings.  Then I drove 600 miles to see him live in concert.  What a wonderful musician and what a truly nice person!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am so happy to see the underprivileged, beaten down and hopeless people, finally have hope, security, peace and a chance to live a better life. It shows we can never give up on our dreams, but we do have to fight for them. I am sorry the books are finished. I think of the characters often. They are not just fiction but their goals, fears, hopes, pain, loss represent so very many.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|At last America is getting to enjoy some fabulous music that we should have had for decades.  Rodriguez is an amazingly talented song writer - a poet really.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never read this type of book, especially with children being harmed, but everyone said it was so good. I could not put it down and so I bought the next two books to make sure I was able to just keep on reading.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Although we feel robbed by not having this available back in the 70's, we're making up for it now.  Such a great voice, great musician, & truly talented songwriter.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am so excited about these books. I do not like that it is about children being harmed and being used by the government just for their entertainment. But, I found myself fighting with the children against those who had power over them.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|This movie is primarily in French, but has English subtitles. It is a very funny, moving film. It has an incredible amount of cussing especially the f-word and a bit of innuendo, but otherwise is teen-friendly. Knowing this is a true story made it even a better watch.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I've been looking for a good Bible app, and I've actually have tried a couple of others and it just wasn't a good fit for me. This one offers everything I wanted and has some features (like the plans) that I didn't even know was possible. So if your looking for a well rounded Bible application this is the one you're looking for.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|This is a great story with fantastic videography! The entire family loved it, We had a great time discussing what really happened with our teens after the movie.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Another  good  book  that just  keeps  you wanting  more  each  time. I  have  and  will keep  recommending  series to all  my  friends
B000SLP4SE|5.0|This a is a classic good guys versus bad guys film with an independent soul.  This film has a great cast and a great story.  Be forewarned,the film is very violent and would not be good for childen.
B000YJ54DU|5.0|If  you wanna  get  lost  in some  suspense, well this  is  your  book.  Some times  its  hard  to  put  down , wanting to  know  whats  gonna  happen  next .
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This is a very readable, engaging novel.  The characters are real, wonderful and tragic people who bring the pages to life.  I couldn't put it down and read it in about two and a half days.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Every time  i thought  i had  it  figured  out  ,  i was  wrong.  That  is  why  i continue  to  enjoy the  Jack Reacher  series.
B001I45UFC|4.0|Wonderful read prvides an inight into the characters that the movie could never create. It is an older book and brtish in reference but a wonderful book to share with your children or the child within.
B007EECSFA|5.0|The kind of book you find hard to put down.  Characters were real, you can imagine this type of thing actually happening and the ending was terrific.
B008602KQI|5.0|It took a while to create the environment of the movie. Once I finally caught on I was captivated by this film. It's a little gory for the younger crowd with people killing each other, but over all a good film for maybe 14 and up.
B00B8R1NP0|2.0|This book seemed to jump around to much for me. I think maybe a little more in depth on the characters would've made it better.
1595828753|4.0|I've always loved the Avatar series. Highly recommend it to anyone, especially if you need something you can enjoy with kids as well. I only wish these comics were longer.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Enjoyed every episode so far.  Love the main characters, can be amusing at times! I  Will be ordering season 4.
0061992860|5.0|Small, portable, convenient, informative. It's just what I was looking for right now. I'll be keeping it in my car.
B00AE2I4WK|2.0|I liked the movie. I had to pay for the movie twice to see it cuz the first time it wouldn't play.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|This was just a little to &#34;artisy&#34; for me.  Just not my type of movie.  The Black and White didn't bother me but the camera movement did.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Kept you in suspense. Had to keep reading. Interesting with the bullying going on in all the schools. Family reactions.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is the best game I've played and i heart this game for life people's and i think you should get this game

B003ZSJ212|5.0|I got what I ordered and the product was in new condition.  this was a gift for a friend of mine and he loved it.  The order was accurate and the delivery was quick.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|The media hype tried to say that the message of this book was &#34;anti&#34; women in some way - that couldn't be farther from the truth.  If you want to feel validated and encouraged, inspired and challenged read this book. Warm, witty, intelligent and uplifting - Ms. Sandberg's voice made every page both an anthem and a love letter
B008469DGY|5.0|very basic but is challenging esp when the wind is blowing. nice grapics and defineitely a fun little game to kill time.
B004UJTG6Q|1.0|Please don't buy the free kindle edition. It is a waste of bandwidth. The paging is terrible, so is the formatting.<br />I am frustrated that Amazon does not test its own products. I am glad it was free - I don't know what I would have done if I had to pay for such a badly formatted book.
0679805273|5.0|I have always loved the simple words that Dr. Seuss used in his book since it makes it easier for younger students to understand his works. Within this book, Dr. Seuss talks about all of the twists and turns that life may bring, but also talks about the victories that may come along with life. even though this book is considered to be a sentiment of sorts, Dr. Seuss uses nonsense words to bring a humorous side to his story. With this aspect, I believe it is a good fit for students to read, especially when times get hard. I would recommend this book to everyone regardless of age because you never know the places you may go!
B0054R6BFM|5.0|The book had me going through constant emotions and when youngest this girl's story it changes you as a person
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These books are, in a word, fantastic! I could hardly put them down. Yes, there are quite a few scenes I could do without, but the writing kept me glued to the pages!!
B000S5C6BI|2.0|After Surfer Rosa and Doolittle, you'd expect another genius album. WHAT HAPPENED!!?? Everything that made the first two great is missing from this one; good beats, inspired song structure and poignant lyrics are all MIA here. Definitely listen to it before you buy. If you have a decerning ear for artistic content, I doubt you'll be pleased with this one.
B0076DELIG|5.0|A tightly-written detective story with a a master-work of a plot and Connelly's trademark gift of characters so well-defined and real that one expects to meet them on the street. Series protagonist Harry Bosch is particularly appealing in this one, showing a depth of feeling and compassion not as evident in some previous books in the series.<br /><br />The book is a real page-turner with many surprising turns and twists, yet (with one exception, which I won't give away) all are so thoroughly natural that each time I was left delightfully wondering how I hadn't seen them coming. It's a true plot musician's verbal literary sleight of hand that never leaves the sour taste of a forced plot twist or sudden, unforeshadowed \\"magic\\" plot resolution.<br /><br />All in all, The Black Box the work of the reigning master in his field at the top of his powers. It's a read not to be missed, even if you're not big into detective thrillers.
B000K4WPCC|4.0|This is a classic B movie, which I love.  Action packed and full of suspense and surprise.  I enjoyed this movie more than I expected to.
B00B6QXN56|5.0|Both me and my husband we love Joe Bonamassa and that is a great album to add to our collection.We listen to it all the time and we love it.
B000FA675C|5.0|There's a reason for Dan Brown's perpetual best-seller status.  Always a great read that keeps you traveling down twisty, turny paths.
B00BF11STU|2.0|I had heard so many great things about this movie, that I came into seeing it with great expectations. I was surprised how uninteresting it was.<br /><br />I understand that it is not billed as documentary, but found the history so lacking and/or convoluted that it was difficult to watch.<br /><br />But the primary reason I didn't like it though, was the main CIA character, Maya. Her character was completely unlikeable. Spending 157 minutes watching this character was a form of torture.
B009PMEEY2|5.0|had this game on my ipad and glad to see its come to Kindle Fire HD. Picked it up on a day it was featured and free too! Fun game, Recommended
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|We have seen Season 1 on Netflix.  We couldn't get season 2.....so I did some looking around and amazon had a great price for all 3 seasons, so I took advantage of it.  Easy ordering,  shipping was fast!  Great Series.....<br /><br />Thanks again,<br />Derrick Durrant<br />Texarkana, TX
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|At first this book is talking about how live was when Greg was in his mom's stomach. How he wanted to get out of there. When he was older he still missed the time spent in his mom's belly because of how he doesn't have any privacy. Then his school needs student counsel and Greg tells Rowley that he should run. Then his uncle comes. Then he tries getting girls to come to the dance
B003P2WO5E|1.0|Really bad style of writing, every possible thing is explained with *.spren and then some. Didn't like the story as well, looked to me like it was pretty rushed.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|Calibrated my monitor well and it's extremely easy to use. Walks you right through the steps. Glad I purchased this one.
B008602KQI|1.0|What kind of twisted mind invents a story where children are forced to murder one another for sport?  It is morbid with no justice for anyone.  The innocent die, the guilty prosper, and the system that causes it continues beyond the end of the movie.  Horrible story line.<br /><br />Sure, the acting and setting for the movie are attractive and believable, but the unrepentant storyline removes all redeeming value.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Very interesting. Loved the ending even if it sucked. As a mom could certainly relate to Laurie.my heart cried for Andy.
B001AFF25W|4.0|Brian Tracey keeps it simple and writes in a way that is easy to follow and understand. The principles learned in the book provide a surefire way to get things that need to be done-done. I am sure if the ideas written in this book are implemented, success is right around the corner. This book is great for anyone looking to increase their productivity.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just started watching the series and can't wait for season 4. When bad things happen you cry right along with them and on joyous occasions you laugh with them too.
B000006L53|5.0|One of Madonna's Finest! I absolutely fell in love with the special edition cover! as a HUGE Madonna Fan it's a precious thing in my collection!
B000Y1ZXU2|1.0|do not epect to hear musis all you will see is an weird looking thing going with the awful sound it makes
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I bought this book a long time ago and it took me quite some time to get around to reading it. I had started it a few times but couldn't get into it mostly because judging by the first chapter I was sure it was going to be written in the style of the author speaking to the reader which I find profoundly annoying. Finally one day I told myself I was going to get past the first 30 pages if it killed me.<br /><br />The story turned out to be well written and full of intrigue. While it wasn't a page turner that I finished overnight I was kept going night after night by the mystery. We have two players locked into a game that spans their entire lives but no one, not even the reader knows the rules. Use magic, that's the only clue they're given. They spend their entire childhood studying for a challenge, never knowing their competitor or when the challenge will happen or how to win or where it will happen or what they win. On one hand is Marco who was chosen to compete because of his literary mind. One the other hand we have Celia, a girl born with magic in her blood. The venue is a circus of astounding proportions populated by a mysterious contortionist, a tarot card reader hiding secrets, twins born of magic, and a mostly invisible man.<br /><br />As I mentioned the story wasn't a quick read for me, at times it definitely stalled and I would put it down for a few days but I knew I'd come back because I wanted to know the big secret. The book itself is full of beautiful and romantic prose that I often reread because I was impressed. The style flits in the time of the inception of the challenge and years later when the circus begins to change. As the book nears to the end the two timelines finally merge and we discover the true nature of the challenge. A few of the characters like Marco, Celia, the twins, and Bailey were well fleshed but others were rightfully shrouded in mystery which made perfect sense for the nature of the book. The main story line is definitely well executed and kept me guessing until the last moment. What I thought was going to be the reason why they transcended the nature of the competition turns out to be the entire goal all along.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book to others and I would definitely look out for this author in the future. Particularly because I think she could definitely write more books about some of the more mysterious characters in this book and I'd definitely read.xecuted and kept me guessing until the last moment.

B00B2QG3K2|5.0|SO GOOD!  I seriously love this album.  I've loved Paramore from the beginning and it's always scary when one of your favorite bands changes/loses band members but this album far surpasses my expectations.  It's a bit more poppy than their previous albums - it's more fun and catchy - less guitar driven but that's NOT a bad thing!  (I detest a lot of pop music don't get me wrong) I love their old stuff and I love this new stuff!  I honestly don't get how there can be bad reviews about this album...those people must just hate the world.  The lyrics are still great and every song is unique.<br /><br />There's a little bit of everything on this album and it's one of the few albums I've bought that I thoroughly LOVED the first time I listened to it.  A lot of times I have to give a new CD (yes I still buy CDs) a few listens before I judge it.  I haven't been so excited about how good a CD is in a long time.<br /><br />Thank you Paramore for staying awesome!  Please stay around a LONG time and give us lots more music greatness!  EVERYONE ELSE - buy this now so they have a reason to!
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I have really enjoyed this game. I used to play Operation Genesis where you built your own park. The concept is the same but simplified. There are components missing, but the overall experience is great.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved seasons 1 & 2 and season 3 did not disapoint me. The only thing that didn't please was the ending where Mathew died. But knowing there will be a season 4 I'm sure that it will all work out. I think Maggie Smith is wonderful and I hope she goes on and on. The whole series is a joy to watch and now I have all 3 series I can just put aside a day and play all 3. The storyline, and the house are so good to see. It is worth watching time and time again.<br />Betty Moody
B004EBTGX8|3.0|It is an enjoyable, predicable read.  It is enjoyable because of the familiarity with the characters. It is predictable because you know that the plot will be solved by Poirot and you know that Hastings will not have a clue.<br /><br />  It is a perfect read at bedtime.  It is suitable for anyone who doesn't want anything too stimulant or violent, just a slow, clue by clue tale until the surprise ending. The  sly humor is delightful, even if it at the expense of Hastings. To me it is not one of Agatha Cristie's best, but always anything she writes is worth a read.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I had a lot of trouble making myself put this book down and go to bed. Another great character within another great storyline! Flynn has yet to disappoint me!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is amazing! It is better than the first game with more features.  I really do love this game!
B0089LOKHG|3.0|i loved the first two and could have loved this (despite the crappy, cruel, done to death love triangle) but most of it is super bleak and then out of no where BOOM hopeful ending???  Also the only romance in this one is doomed and the author makes sure we know it.  She doesn't give us anytime with the right match AND she doesn't even make a clean break with the wrong one, so you can't even believe they have a happy ever after because we knew there's a lot more pain coming for characters we care about.  Too many loose ends.  (that \\"knew\\"  should be \\"know\\" but my kindle fire gets glitchy writing AMAZON reviews.)
B003XF1OJK|5.0|One of the most stories driven books ever also find out the origin of the spartan . . . .

B004UA8D2S|4.0|I did not see this movie in 3D yet, it had me on the edge of my seat afraid of small cornered spaces! Especially an under water cave!? Good Lord! Of all the insane nerve!! I thought it was great intensity! Just when u think they were about to find a way out still trapped!!! Ooohhh mercy still gives me the under water chills!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best shows currently on television. I highly recommend it to anyone (unless you have a weak stomach!) It's not simply a gore-fest zombie show. What makes it so excellent is it's rich character development.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Awesome book and series! Kept me interested the entire way through.  Loved the ending especially.<br />I will recommend this book and series to all my friends and family.
B000FA675C|5.0|I loved this book. I had seen the movie and always wanted to read the book. The movie felt like a big mistake after reading this book. I don't think the movie justified the book. But then you also don't want the movie to be longer than 2 hours. Five stars for the book.
0439023491|5.0|This was a great sequel to the Hunger Games. I could not stop reading! There were times that I was really tense because I was really engaged in the book. I was wondering how she would do the sequel, and I was really surprised at the beginning when there was a twist. Overall, this is a great sequel to the Hunger Games, and I would recommend it to anyone who liked the Hunger Games.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I honestly love The Walking Dead series. I'm always at the edge of my seat wondering whats gonna happen next! It's amazing!
B005LAIIQC|5.0|Stands on its own as a solid action flick. Jeremy Renner is a good heir apparent to the Bourne legacy, keep the action coming Jeremy!!!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love Sparks books but this one in particular really hit me in the heart. It was a beautiful love story that we all hoped the two lovers would get back together; but instead He ended up givng the greatest thing to the woman he loved. Had enough action in it to keep it moving quickly
B000FA675C|4.0|This book has been out for years. I was so happy to see it being offered up in the Kindle world for free.<br />The fact of the matter is.. I am partly through this book.. I am so enjoying it..<br />I can  understand why this book was popular when it first came out...
B000FA675C|5.0|It is a very well written exhilarating thriller. Like the book because it transports me to France in a heartbeat.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|Excellent movie!  I saw the trailer for it in the movie theater, but it never came to cable.  Was glad to see it on Amazon!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I enjoyed the story very much.  Lots of romance, l  loved the characters and the story line. I have fantasized about time travel many times.
1475972350|3.0|I had a really hard time getting into the book.  But once I pushed myself, I found that I enjoyed it.  I was a little disappointed in how it ended.  There was a lot of build up to get there & then it ended very quickly.  It seemed like the book stretched on and on at some parts & I had a hard time following the point of view changes at times.  But overall, I enjoyed the story & the book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put this book down, it kept me guessing through the entire thing. Just when I thought I had it figured out, wham, it goes a different direction. It's a great read that I couldn't wait to see what would happen next, but am now sorry I've finished.
1423124960|5.0|Good quality book, nice drawings, perfect story length for bedtime reading, sliver lining of the pages: very nice execution that feels like a treasure book for little girls
B00865P3AS|5.0|Love them, cant wait to see them in concert this week. Love this CD and their others! It can sit on repeat in our house!
B00004X10B|3.0|I had a very old (1985) TAMRAC bag and needed a new one, for 2 cameras, so I chose this one based on the online description only.<br /><br />Like:<br />- Many pockets<br />- Size appropriate for most cameras<br />Dislike:<br />- The quality of the 2013 model is very far below the 1985 model. Especially disppointing: the zippers that feel cheap and fragile<br />- The lower-level pockets are not easily accessible. From the picture, I thought the lower-level pockets were accessible from the front of the bag, but actually you need to remove the cameras from the top compartments and open up the velcro-sealed lower-level pocket covers: not very convenient...
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|its a classic movie. You cant go wrong and its actually kinda funny seeing the wolverine belt out in song :)
B000FA675C|3.0|Unmemorable, badly written. I kept going, hoping the book would get better but it did not. I guess this was about hype.
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|My Anker 18W 3.6A Car Charger arrived the other day and my initial test was to take my iPad 2 with 52% battery life and see how much it would charge on a 40 minute car ride with a dead Plantronics bluetooth earpiece (the Voyager Pro) charging in the Android slot at the same time.  Both products did charge, and the iPad 2 was charged from 52% to 74% battery life in about 40 minutes which isn't actually bad from a car charger at all.  Based on the 22% charge in 40 minutes, I would presume you can charge from dead to 100% in about 3 1/2 hours or less.<br /><br />I really like that you can charge both a Smartphone and tablet at the same time (tested the iPhone 4S in the Android port while iPad was in the Apple port and still charged fine).<br /><br />Wish you could charge an iPad in the Apple port and a Kindle Fire HD or Google Nexus 7 in the Android port at the same time, but this would be too much output for this charger.  That would make it 5 stars in my book.<br /><br />The charger did get warm after the 40 minute charge, but I didn't feel like it was in danger of burning up or anything.
B007BZM3HK|5.0|If she just met me and thought it was crazy but gave me her number to call her maybe I would call her so hard man.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is totally cool. I highly recommend it.You have to get away from a giant monkey.you slide,jump,ride in a cart. (Age 10)

B003LQ3YXU|5.0|One of my favorite seasons, it is a shame CE only stuck around for one season.<br /> Rose = best companion
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked not knowing and always thinking well, maybe he didn't do it? I thought this book was very well written and kept me wanting more! I liked the ending because it's shocking, but I really wanted it explained more.... I would recommend this book!
015601386X|5.0|I have no further comments, I just love it.<br />I've read it in Spanish, in French and now in German. It's simply a terrific book.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love stories like this where a nice man helps a battered woman trust again! I loved this book! I would highly recommend it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am addicted to this series and love the characters. Very interesting to see the relationships of employer/employees. I can't wait for season 4.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|It was a very interesting series's it kept up late at night reading o find out more I found a lot of disturbing things and the whole story is totally unpredictable from beginning to end one thing leads to a completely different thing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great game I love it awesome if you love temple you should royalty get this.<br />sorry miss type up there I. lent you should totally get this app
B00992CF6W|3.0|this kind of sucks because it keeps failing to install does anyone have any suggestions? it would help out alot
B000FA675C|5.0|This has always been one of my favorites books and is a must read for anyone who enjoys reading. I am not a mystery person really, but Dan Brown has a very pleasing writing style
B005H5H3LW|4.0|I hate movies with subtitles but I had no choice if I wanted to see this live acted version of a famous Japanes tv series. The story wasn't too bad and I was able to follow it for the most part (sometimes Japanese movies are unfathomable as to what the hell they are meaning). If this were dubbed into English it would have been even better. Good special effects!
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I thought this would be a great alternative to a paper planner, since I have my Kindle with me pretty much all the time.  I loaded my work and personal appointments, and color-coded everything (cool feature).  When I checked my schedule a few days later several entries were gone - they'd been there the day before.  Uninstalled it.  Very disappointed.

B000FBJFSC|5.0|I was absolutely taken away with this book. From the first page I did not want to put it down. There were times I cried and times I laughed. Thank you Mr. McCourt for writing this memoir. I will never forget this book. You have shown what true perseverance of the human spirit truly is.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Went to see this in the movie theaters and my daughter loved it! Had to rent for her too. Probably should have purchased it
0345803493|5.0|Love this book. Can wait to read number 3.  Wow!!  Awesome love story besides all the steamy parts  Fast read
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This book opens the normally clandestine world of the SEALS and gives the reader an insight as to how they work, and who volunteers for this type of work.
B008FRFN7A|4.0|This app now allows me to print from my wireless HP printer. Quality is quite good.  Photo printed very clear.
0525953728|4.0|Really good book.  The book was well-written, and explained in detail the specifics of the mission.  I would recommend this book.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I've been searching for a RPG game for kindle for awhile, this so far has been the closest to a dungeons and dragons game as I can find at the moment
0375842209|5.0|This is a book about World War II in Germany, told from the viewpoint of death and describing life for sympathizers, uncommitted and Jews.  The writing is poetic and unusual and the importance of the use of words is paramount.
B0000A1RJI|2.0|There are pops at random times during the recordings!!! What a shame... Listening to it on a pair of HD800s reveals a lot more than I'd like. XD Oh well. First heard it on \\"Barbossa Is Hungry\\", but it's there in several other tracks.<br /><br />Otherwise, great themes!! Very catchy and stays in your head. :)
B00932AA5G|5.0|loved the movie didn't care that it was english subtitles, enjoyed all of it. great story, characters and suspense all the way
B007REV4YI|5.0|Possibly the best of the &#34;Bond&#34; series.Incredible non-stop action, with the best cinematography and action in film that I've seen since &#34;Lawrence of Arabia&#34;.
0988178532|5.0|This book was fantastic.  I just love Nate and his friends.  I felt like I know him personally now.  The author does a great job of making you feel like you are there when it is happening.  You never konw what is going to happen next.  Can't wait for Book 2.  Hurry!!
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Everyone in rock music knows the names Dave Grohl and Rupert Neve. Here Mr. Grohl has created an absorbing love letter to one of Rupert's awe-inspiring electronic masterpeices, through which some of the most iconic sounds of rock & roll passed. The Neve console played  a large role in taking these sounds from great to top-shelf. Everyone involved did  a wonderful job on this film. Anyone interested in music production should see this film.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|It was intense. You must pay attention or you will miss vital data. It's the kind of movie you must watch more than once.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book. So many ups an  downs an  twists. Had me on edge most of the  book not wanting to put it down. Excited for walking disaster
B00AU15HPC|5.0|This is a different style for Justin.BUT its also beautiful and his voice is just unbelievable.The songs are country style but no matter how he does them they are his songs and his voice and no one is better
0812993357|5.0|I have always been fascinated with the work of Grace Coddington, and after reading this book I am not only in love with her work but also with Grace's wit, humor and ability to tell stories. The book felt like a conversation between friends more than a auto biography. I loved reading the behind the scene stories to many of her legendary photographs. Thank you Grace for sharing a brilliant life with us.
0307341550|5.0|couldn't put the book down, a must read.<br /><br />I buy alot of suspense and thriller type books.  this is one that gets a very score from me,  couldn't put it down until I was done.
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|Just not very good, too long. Rudd's character's decisions are unrealistic. Apatow's wife and kids can't act.<br /><br />It seemed like funny was just around the corner...and then credits.
B000I8ES70|5.0|This is the first time we get to see Milla Jovovich with her powers running roughshod over everyone and everything, and it doesn't disappoint. This is a great sequel to the original and sets the table nicely for all the ones that come after it. You do have to see the original to be able to follow, but after you see the first one you definitely ought to see this one and the rest.
B009JZSFUY|5.0|Unlike many of the TNG movies, this one moves along quite nicely with very little dragging during the movie.  Patrick Stewart does what few other actors can; he has a deep-cut grudge against a fictitious alien race for doing somehting to him that didn't even happen (assimilating him)....and you believe every second of it.
B000P0J09M|4.0|A great movie about the whirlwind of living. I love the ending when Henry Hill regretfully resigns to the life of a \\"smuck,\\" a boring guy who picks up the paper outside his home. I guess he misses the wild days of his youth. It reminds me that a little excitement is better than nothing, but you've got to take the ups and downs of the roller coaster.<br /><br />In a lot of ways, he is somewhat of a loser. He could have worked a regular job like other people, made a different contribution to the world. But I guess he admired the power of the bad guys. \\"Luke, come to the dark side.\\"
B006AZZPCM|4.0|I have had no problems with the functionality of downloading videos, but the interface is cluttered with buttons and adds. Its free so kind of expected that. Overall not bad.
B001HM1PFO|3.0|Campy in its time, this movie was and is stupid. If not for all the late-night screenings with all of the audience participation, this movie would have been forgotten quickly. Seen on the small screen without the context of the audience participation, it's just stupid.
B0068RHSCW|4.0|I saw a glimpse of this movie somewhere after watching it.  It's the kind of movie you need to watch again because you see it from another very interesting angle.  I liked it.  It's kind of bizarre but really pretty interesting.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's loads of fun to wile away some time.  Graphics are excellent.  Nothing bad to say about this product and it was free!
B005COO1X6|5.0|Love all his stories and books! Never ceases to amaze me the imagination he has. Look forward to what comes next.
B007EC27QM|5.0|Two critical features....the &quot;tape&quot; and the % key....make this my 1st choice in calculators. I absolutely must have a % key that works the way this one does....and the &quot;tape&quot; is just a fabulous bonus feature. Plus I love the size...the easy visibility...and the fact that it is on my Kindle. It's a 5-star plus!!!
B0050PYNN0|5.0|awesome movie! came very fast with my other order and i cannot complain! so i will just fill in more words here!
B008602KQI|5.0|I couldn't help but love Katness - so honest and unassuming, she wraps the audience around her finger easily with her respect for life and distain for violence.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this one!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|who doesn't love indiana jones especially on blu ray and especially the entire collection! very cheap and brand new on top of that
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|I have to say, this film was very interesting to watch. I especially liked  watching the behind the scenes of how Hichcock made Physco. One of today's all time favorite horror flicks. This movie difinately sparked my interest into wanting to watch more of Hitchcock's work. I would highly recommend this film to those who want to get a little sneekpeek into the mind of The Master of Suspense.
B0055PGUYU|2.0|Given the number of reviews provided on Amazon, I did not expect the book to be that worse. I found self development books useful if they involve either great deal of in depth analysis and information about the subject, or being inspirational. The news is this book offered neither of them for me. Although there were some of good ideas to be adopted in life, I found most of the book busy with telling stories of people in details that much of the time are not relevant to the subject. There are not much of the constructive arguments or questions that a writer poses in order to make you think about the topic in a different way. There were much of irrelevant information and trivial facts that took from the richness of the book.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I am a snooze addict and I travel quite a bit.  I use this in tandem with a white noise app at hotels where alarms are not trustworthy and neighbors can be noisy.  I love that I can set it for hard math on days I really have to get up, or music on the weekends.  I haven't overslept once since getting it.  For those complaining about battery drain, I just keep the plug by my bed so my kindle fire is on AC and charging all night, and good to go all the next day.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I loved the fact that it was based on a true story. I was not aware of this entire operation. Wonderful!
0545425115|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this book series! I didn't think that I would enjoy them, but I bought the first book, and I ended up reading them all in 3 days! Very addicting!
B008A1NSTG|5.0|I love nature movies and I love anything about life in a hard environment. I guess I love to see people struggle and come out on top.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Highly enjoyable movie, the 3d was amazing and really fun to watch. I really recommend people get this movie as soon as they can
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|The scenery was outstanding. The story was all such a fantasy but at the end you wonder if it really happened.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This provides a great way to always have the scriptures available for easy reference wherever I am with my phone.
B004X4R49Y|4.0|I loved the development of the friendship between two men living in two different worlds. Just goes to show you that everyone needs a friend.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This book kept my attention...I love that! Great love story but I found myself a little disappointed at the end.
B00A9C3RB8|5.0|I believe all couples who have been together so long go through some form of estrangement. Just goes to show how you have to constantly have to work at a relationship and how important communication is.
B00AKKGX4W|4.0|I gave this book four stars.  It was a well written book.  Interesting with a bit of a different twist on the typical romance.<br />It helps to read the prequel to this,\\"The Governess Affair\\".<br />I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical romance.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I know this was a true story but I really did not like the ending. He told the truth and he had to pay for his error but I still didn't like it. The Hero Syndrome in me, I guess.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Almost lick pc game and is fun to play my kids get mad when I have to take it  away
B002BI6SMI|5.0|His eyes are soooo blue. I loved the first Taken and this one was just as good. It made the Middle East look glamorous as well as treacherous!
0316044695|5.0|This is awesome I reconmend this book to who ever wants to a Seal. It talks about what's it like in BUDS and what it takes to be an elite warrior.
B007JRU2UK|4.0|Another example of just how important family is and how important it is to communicate and compromise. I love the setting in Hawaii.
0425263908|1.0|Don't waster your time, just go directly to the '50 Shades' series.  This book was a carbon copy of the 50 shades books with less substance.  Waste of my time.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|I love Clint Eastwood in anything he does. The story was so wonderful, the relationship between a daughter and her dad.
B0075LTOR2|5.0|The best collection of Roxy Music ever!!!!! Especially, the studio mixes and remixes. Recommend to anyone who is a Roxy fan.
B007Q476KU|5.0|When I saw the previews to this movie I thought I'd never watch it. I was afraid it would be a tear jerker. Parts were but it was done very well!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read sci-fi, but at age 81 I'm sure I've added a whole new demographic to this author's readership.  Let me know when the final series is available.
B00B7G3NFU|2.0|It was just a little too weird for me. I never felt endeared to the main character. Maybe I'm just not empathetic enough.
0374275637|4.0|I have not read the book.  I bought it as a gift for my grandaughter who had it on her wish list. with Amazon.  The wish list is very handy for gift ideas for family and friends.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What an amazing story for all ages!  My third grader has read it and what great life lessons to learn!
1451695195|5.0|I love to read but I'm particulary picky about what holds my interest long enough to finish. I finished this book in two days. It would have been finished in one day had I not had a new baby to tend to and many other things diverting my attention. I love that this book was written from a neuroscientists perspective. He mentions things that I have felt and theorized myself but didn't know if I was on the right track with my ideas. So many say how is God possible but I wonder why we feel we have the mental capacity to understand how such a higher intelligence such as God works. That is one of the vibes I got from his story. That whats out there beyond the physical realm is beyond our ability to understand. I always thought cave men could never fathom a television either and I think its along those same lines. Dr. Alexander also applies his medical knowledge as to why he feels that these near death experiences are more than just fantasies. Very interesting read. I'm a lover of science and spirituality so this book is right up my alley. I'm skeptical of psychics and stuff like that but not completly closed off to learning and understanding ideas I'm not sure about but I'm the type that needs facts. More importantly I believe in God and have faith that there is a world out there to big for me to understand until I have actually been there to understand it. I don't go to church as much as I should but I do love God and have seen him act in my life.I pray often and just simply enjoy feeling \\"His\\" (Gods) presence in my life. That was another thing Dr. Alexander mentioned. That it is too much for us to understand until we've experienced it first hand and our lanquage here on earth does not contain enough words to even explain it.Reading about his experience made me feel down right giddy about the \\"what ifs\\" of all the good that truly is out there and about how wonderful heaven is. I especially loved the part that he mentioned that all of everything in existence comes from love. I feel love and god are somehow two of the same. Thus the reason they say god created all. Thats just my theory. Just something I feel. God is a spirit of love. Dr. Alexander even gave a brief explanation on why evil exist in our world and why such things happen. I was really drawn into this book also because from chapter to chapter Dr. Alexander rotates back and forth from a story of his real life happening on earth and his connections to his family and loved ones and then back to his experiences when entering the gates of heaven or as he called it the core. I'm not sure if what he saw was actual heaven or just a glimpse of what was to come. Either way, very interesting and comforting read. He states that his intent is to help those who are dying or witnessing family members passing away. I'm sure this comes from the many times he as a doctor has had to witness this and I believe he is writing this book to help others and to share his amazing experience that he feels happened for a reason. The reason being to do just what he states his intentions are in the book. I also feel that what Dr. Alexanders story would help us to know how to truly enjoy our stay here on earth no matter what trials we may face. It makes you realize you have nothing to fear and everything to learn and that the existance of life is a miracle all on its own.That we are loved and cherished. I believe what God feels for us is similar to what parents feel for thier children.(the parent thing is a thought I had but still seems to mesh with what Dr. Alexander is saying too) His love is unconditional and forgiving because he understands we are not as equipped in our world with the intelligence that is beyond the physical realm and he simply loves us no matter what an has great things in store for us.I still don't feel my review has done this book justice. The way he writes the story is magical. You feel as if you are part of the experience. I still don't feel that he offered absolute proof but still  Great, great read. That part that especially touched me was the chapter that involves his youngest son . I can't give away too much of the book so I can't say anymore than that. I did on occassion think, who does this guy think he is that he is so special. (thus I can see how one of the few negative reviews mentions he seems narcissistic) but in the book he mentions he's not trying to sound grandiose.I don't know for sure that he is trying to sound that way. In the book he mentions going through a period of depression which affected his work and family but he didn't go into detail about. A negative reviewer on here states some things in the doctors past. I know I risk being naive but I think this book may still have merit despite that because when someone goes through something like this, it has the power to change a person and if I'm not mistaken that happened before this incident. My mind is still open to all perspectives. I don't feel I have absolute proof yet but they wouldn't call it faith if you had all the answers and I think theres a reason we should just have faith while at the same time not allowing ourselves to be to vulnerable to any and all info. out there. Either way, this book was a great and interesting read and I don't doubt that what he says is entirely possible.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|love it because i caN PLAY BINGO WHENEVER I WANT. IF U R A BINGO FAN U WILL LOVE IT TOO.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Makes me look forward to experiencing the spiritual in the next life.  Gives personal correlation to the experience which provides the 'believable' aspect.  Recommended!

B0074VA2T2|5.0|Great App!<br /><br />There are five levels available. My daughter started out with level one and has been progressing through the levels over the last three weeks. We're currently at level four and she gets so excited when she finishes a new level. The repetition of the game makes for easy learning. Great job!
B00ABGEFWC|3.0|You have to pay for the gems in the game with real money and they are hard to collect. The pets are cute but I spent $40 on gems and I got in big trouble. Also,most of the pets cost gems. I gave you three stars because you get to build a town on the farm or beach and the challenges are easy to do. Coins are easy to collect and you can buy houses and pets and have a big pet world!!!
B0012FHGCW|5.0|\\"Into the wild\\" is a movie about a boy named Christopher McCandless who just up and leaves his wonderful life to go on a trek across america. He's gotten tired of the way life is and how dependent people are on material things and he just wanted to live life with nothing but himself and his back pack. He experiences a lot in his trek across america and finds out how amazing nature is, how much fun a person could have with nothing to his name. In the end, it doesn't fare too well for him. The movie, as well as the book i'm sure, just have a huge impact on a person. It makes you realize that we, as humans, are so dependent on materialistic things. We rely on money, technological items, processed foods, and etc. He left behind Money, his identity, a warm roof over his head, and the ability to walk into a store and buy food at the drop of a dime (literally). He had a great time doing so too. I cried at the end and went on throughout the day with a new look on life. \\"Into the wild\\" made me realize that there's so many things in my life that i don't need and that i'm dependent on; that i could live without. This movie is just amazing and you'll love it!

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|game is fun and very challenging dont want to stop playing. It really makes you stop and think about how to aim.
0812973992|5.0|This was a wonderful book. It was really a pleasure to read. I would recommend this novel to anyone and it didn't take long to read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love it!!! Although I feel as if Suzanne Collins had something going on in her life causing her to run out of steam
B005PK57NU|5.0|One of the best series we have seen in a long time.  Waiting for Amazon to put Season 4 on Prime.
B000FA675C|4.0|Mysteries get the mind going and this one sure did! A very well written book with a thought provoking subject.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game for all ages.  The young as well as the parents will love this fast paced game. Download and enjoy.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This game is addicting! Very creative, fun for any age, but each level only takes around 30 seconds to complete, and at 50 levels, that isn't much playtime. Still a fantastic game and well worth the extra dollar for the new levels!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|What an exciting book! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time and can't wait to see the movie. I certainly have a greater appreciation for our military men and women.
B006IMY5ZU|5.0|Not only is Brad Pitt a good actor and eye candy as always; this story is inspirational and good entertainment.
B001ECQ4HG|5.0|True Romance is a rare flilm  as it pertains to being a movie you could watch again and again!<br />By far, this is Christian Slater's best career performance of his career!<br />Thanks.......Greg Anstett.....
B005IQZB14|4.0|An easy read about a walk on the wild side in more ways than one!  I liked the pacing, but thought the realism was questionable at times.  What a journey to undertake and survive!
B00B7FXZQS|3.0|These movies tend to be the same.  Not much to them and the overall story is kind of boring. Needs more of a plot line.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|An eye-liner-wearing, skinny Korean boy falls in love with a poor, overweight red-headed girl.  I loved the atypical characters and their witty banter.  The story got a little boring in spots, but overall I enjoyed it.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Good game, dragons are pretty cute. Seems to run ok on my Kindle hd, it has locked up a few times though.
B00BJZHSOQ|4.0|Anything Michael Buble sings is great. I wish he had more<br />songs to buy. Its upbeat and fun to listen to.
B00B23O96A|4.0|Be ready for a collection of songs never heard before on an Eric CD.  He picked songs from the last 60 years, put his style on them and made this a fun CD to listen to over and over again.
0385349947|5.0|It's hard for me to rate this book because I had it sent to my daughter in college but from hearsay she agrees with the concepts within this title.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|I am a huge fan of Paramore and this album did not let me down! I love the uniqueness and variety of each song. This is no cookie cutter album. I highly recommend this album to anyone looking for great music!
B000V8A95C|5.0|This soundtrack was just what I was looking for!  I took my girls to go see Wicked, and they loved it so much they wanted the songs.  Now they listen to it and sing  and act out the songs.  It was very quick and easy to download onto my computer.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|What can I say about Tina Fey that wouldn't be great?  She's funny & the book was a great read!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|This is a perfect way to buy a Blu-ray, The service is fast and on time.  I will recommend this prodcut.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Excelent album, one of their best ever. One of the hardest hitting albums the band has ever put out in their career.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I love this show! And I was expecting since last year to watch it by streaming.<br /><br />I can tell the quality is great and I am able to stream it using my roku player or my Bravia tv.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Great book for dog lovers who would be interested in a story told from a dog perspective. A great story of how a dog and owner go through lifes challenges together. Very heartwarming and funny!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|The movie was at my house in 2 days which was absolutely incredible for me and the DVD quality is perfect. nothing wrong and yes ALL the episodes are here and NONE of them are edited.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Love love love love love love love love love this movie esp in 3d the colors are amazing buy it
B00821OX98|4.0|Saw the previews in movie theaters for Falling Skies and was interested in it. It didn't disappoint. Once I started watching, couldn't stop until finishing first season in first two or three days. Although some of the people acting in it or some of the scenes were either not very convincing or didn't feel at the right place, overall the acting, action and direction is good.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series rocks... seriously my husband and I can't get enough. It appeals to his &#34;history buff&#34; side and my &#34;drama&#34; side...
B00BRR66SA|5.0|This album is a good one.  A few songs had to grow on me but I would recommend buying this!
B0010SKUYM|5.0|This book is paced excellently - I breezed through ~600 pages in about a week.<br /><br />The main character's story is very organically told; everything in the story makes sense and affects the plot in nuanced amounts.<br /><br />I also enjoy the way Rothfuss will pepper his story with memorable lines - truths about life revealed through the dialogue.
0689835604|5.0|Lift-the-flap books are a big hit with my baby and this one is especially good for a few reasons. 1) The content is educational. Basic parts of the body for the pre-verbal set. 2) The flaps lift in different directions.  Some of the other books have the flap lift the same way on every page and I like that my baby remembers what part to lift when we get to a new page in this book. 3) The book is well constructed.  It's going to get a ton of abuse so you should expect the flaps to get crumpled and even torn off BUT it doesn't happen easily and it's easy to tack the flap back on with some scotch tape.  I think that's probably the most you can ask for with this type of book. If our baby library could only have 5 books, this would be one of them.
0345529057|4.0|I got them yesterday and the condition is great! No missing pages or any damages. Ready to start reading them!!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to aquire. Passes the time away for hours. I paly while watching TV, most recently played for hours waiting for my Mom to come out of surgery.
0688152023|5.0|Excellent, I'm older and love the stretches. I hope to get long and lean..it will take time, maybe a year<br />Janei
B00BSW6F26|1.0|This game is not very well done. No hints, no \\"book\\" to access during game play. There is a walk through video but this is laughable when you have to have flash player to view it and as for now - Kindle does not have this.  This game was a big waste of money and time.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|I bought this game at the request of my grandchildren.  They love playing it.The game has great graphics and is challenging enough that they don't get bored.
1609611543|4.0|whoa..I had no idea what I was eating..now i know why I had so many problems losing my beer belly
B00BP29SAA|5.0|Dr. Panda's Supermarket is a wonderful Interactive game for small children that keeps them Engaged and Entertained very well.

I recommend it.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|great game well worth the download if you like military games or city building games. I love playing this game because I am in the military.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|NOTE:  I own all the Angry Birds games and ROVIO has RUINED them all with SPYWARE.  They have recently issued new Updates for all of them that change the modest 2 PERMISSIONS to 11 so they CAN SPY ON YOUR DEVICE!<br /><br />I also have had many CRASHES with all 5 Angry Bird games as well as their Amazing Alex and BAD PIGGIES apps.  I repeatedly reported all the problems to ROVIO in the past year and they always send you FORM LETTERS but never FIX ANY PROBLEMS.  Many people have reported these Graphics Anomalies and Crashing problems so ROVIO is well aware of issues but does Nothing to Fix them.  Now they just want to SPY on US to MAKE MORE MONEY.<br /><br />NOTE:  The Developer Description at the end of their app pages on Amazon has ROVIO saying they are Expanding their ACTIVITIES INTO MARKETING SERVICES, etc.  Obviously they have changed into a MONEY MONGER Company.<br /><br />ALL 7 OF THEIR APPS CRASH PERIODICALLY, NOW INSTALL SPYWARE ON YOUR DEVICE AND THEY WON'T FIX PROBLEMS.  I will NEVER TRUST THEM again and will Remove all 7 ROVIO apps that I paid for.  STAY AWAY!!!!!
6304696558|5.0|She is an all-time favorite of mine and this is one movie I enjoy seeing over and over......much like OVERBOARD  It just keeps getting better with time.
0824835921|5.0|It dawned on me recently that I needed to learn kanji in order to further my study of the japanese language. Forcing the characters by writing them repeatedly does not work very well for me, and although I did that for learning katakana and hiragana, there are far fewer characters in both syllabaries combined. I figured I would give this a try, checking it out from the library first, and it works for me (so far)! I had to make up my own stories for the word month (I could not for the life of me see the eye and mouth in the moon that Heisig was describing, but my story for it works very well . . .)<br /><br />Although this book does not teach how to pronounce the kanji itself, I do think the method of isolating one thing at a time will really work, and by the time one has learned 2000+ kanji, assigned a sound will be easier; after so much practice and recognizing in context, it might even be possible to learn some the pronunciation here and there.<br /><br />I also received a great surprise when I opened the box from Amazon this afternoon; the book is purple not blue! I don't know if that's just my copy or a different print. It doesn't bother me, but I wonder if others encountered this as well.
B004MC0FO8|5.0|needed this long ago and i use it often now. i asked a waitress what is that song and she pulled out her phone====SHAZAM!!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|The book was good  only thing l didn't like was that Travis was a little off his rocker other then that the book was good.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Elvis was a one of a kind type of entertainer.  I remember seeing him on Ed Sullivan and my Dad having a fit about his performance.  You never really ever forgot him--he was a legend in the making and he still lives on.
B009POCG2C|4.0|This is hands down one of the best movies I have seen in recent years. in a time of unoriginal ideas, clint eastwood hit a homerun. i thought the casting was superb and the story was well written. i really got into the character's lives.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Best CPU in the range for the money. cant praise this enough. just wish it was a bit more affordable but thats Intel for ya.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Kyle's personal accounting of his experiences in war(and in life) and being a patriot warrior makes for a great read.  RIP Kyle.
B004H6G0TI|4.0|I really don't play games on my phone but this one was ok for what it is, killed some time so it did it's job
B0043RSJ8G|5.0|I loved the interplay between the book and music. Lovely songs from a folk-singer type voice. Challenging topic but wonderful story with compelling characters. Loved the ending!!
B008L1DNGI|4.0|to my Dreamcast days, Love the game but I never really played it for single player, This was the first Dreamcast game to have online play and that's where I spent many hours. Wish this had online play but I also miss playing this with a controller, but for a phone app game it does well.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series and cannot wait until Season 4!  Best show I have seen in years!  I have told all my friends who aren't already watched it that they have to see it and to make sure and start with Season 1!
B00AKFG15S|3.0|This book is unfortunately not in the same class as the previous two which were excellent and impossible to put down.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Just downloaded it, did not play a lot but seems nice so far.<br />The Italian translation could be better (for example, \\"poles\\" is \\"barriere a terra\\" in Italian, not \\"pali\\").
B007NZQU72|5.0|This book is very informative and helps one see clearing how they sensitivity affects one life and others. One starts to realize that you are not crazy just more sensitive than others.  I have learned how to protect myself and a have better understanding of others,
B009FB3XTA|5.0|I have bought every soundtrack from every movie and have loved the music from every single one! This one was no different! i have enjoyed every minute of this excellent CD!!!
B008602KQI|5.0|Excellent quality, and streamed to my laptop without any problems or issues whatsoever. The sound was superb too, and with my headphones on, it was better than being at the cinema!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|incredible once again.The songs are a major music attraction and experience you will keep singing over and over in your head.
B001P06GX4|5.0|We have enjoyed this game. As an older adult there are no a lot of games to choose from. Works great for 4, but 2 can enjoy it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire.  I use it to keep meeting notes as well as for my personal use.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|nuff said<br /><br />silly thing wants eighteen words. why. now my review losses it's crispness. now six more words required done
B001UTW7QU|4.0|So I don't actually watch this show, my roommate does, but he is always watching it, totally addicted, and he is a pretty good judge of a good show.  If you want a show that will drive your roommate crazy because you can't stop watching, I guess this is the show for you.
B0064MGU98|4.0|If you are a sucker for legal drama like me, you will like this very much.  It kept me interested in the characters and though I found the cases from each episode flowing along fairly predictable lines, I still like the surprises from the overall story arc. Julianna Margulies is very good, but I didn't find anything award worthy in her performance.
B00BP4ZNFM|3.0|I have a new 60&#34; vizeo and I was really looking forward to watching the classic movie, but the picture quality was fuzzy at times.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|My wife and I enjoyed The Hobbit; I really like the story line and am excited to see the next one. The only disappointment was the length of the movie it was a little long.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this book series so I had to own the movie as well.  Popped it in to the DVD player as soon as it came in the mail and started watching it.  DVD froze about 45 minutes in to the movie and could not recover.  Had to return it and order a new one which worked perfectly.
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|This is definitely a great album and I've enjoyed every song on it.  It comes with the full album, a copy of there live album, and a DVD of them playing there live album.  They sound exactly the same live as they do on the album, which is definitely hard to come by these days.  BUY IT NOW!!!
B00BESM14U|5.0|One of the few movies, in my opinion, that does the book justice. Even though I loved the book, I was hesitant to give the movie a shot...my post-teenage angst has long since faded, and movies centered around high school are not of much interest to me at this point. That being said I am glad I gave it a chance. The cast was excellent and thoroughly believable. I laughed, cried, and genuinely felt for the characters.
0062073192|5.0|A great book that gives you a very descriptive back-story of Sam & Dean growing up and there father really struggling to keep them alive and still give them an alright childhood.
B009XY97VC|5.0|Two steps from hell and ES posthumus are two groups which I credit for introducing me to &#34;cinematic music.&#34; This album is awesome. The first song I heard from this album is &#34;Blackheart&#34; which enthralled me as soon as I heard it. After that El Dorado and several others songs kept me coming back until I made the executive decision to delete my pirated version and buy the ones from Amazon.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Another great CD from Andrea Bocelli!  Although I don't speak Italian, I loved the<br />sootheing sound and wonderful style of this music.  It may be my favorite Bocelli<br />CD.  I'll have to listen to it several hundred more times to be sure.
B00C0NFMKI|5.0|Hayley sounds great. A very positive album with some classics on it. Easy to listen all of the way through.  I'm glad they came back strong.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I recognized the sincereity of Dr. Alexander and realized the difficulty he had<br />expressing the unexpressable.  It was a very brave book to undertake on a subject most of us have questions and concerns about.  I would recommend anyone curious about the hereafter read his account.  I subtracted a star because<br />medical facts became a little tedious for a brief time.
B00BC5AWNM|5.0|I saw this movie from the forties and never forgot it. Since Oscar Wilde , I believe, only wrote this one novel, I had to get it. I am not done with it yet, as I am also rereading NYPD Red, but it is a terrific story & I recommend it to those readers with an astute taste for classic novels.
B003M6EAXM|5.0|The series has been very good. These series makes Prime a very good bargin. Keep up the good work. Thinks
030758836X|2.0|I wanted to like this book because the plot was interesting, exploring the dynamics of a marriage gone wrong from both points of view. I liked that the narration shifted between the two. But the main characters were terribly irritating and self-absorbed. Instead of deliciously evil or comically black, they were both so very petty and nit-picky like people in real life I avoid. The secondary characters were undeveloped and uninteresting, reflecting laziness or a lack of interest by the author. I wanted more but all I got was \\"meh\\".
B000FC1K66|4.0|Easy reading, good atmosphere. Surprised it i used as part of teaching course. Brave decision. I celebrate it. Well done.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Does just what ad said it will do. I take my kindle with me where ever I go so it is always helps keep my schedule on track. Thanks!<br />pattysplace2
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like this game because I love butter but you should<br />make the whole wold should be made out of butter
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|I choose 5 stars is because the book is awesome<br />I love everything about the book and I hate nothing
B00BCOQSSQ|5.0|With so much garbage out there littered with typos and grammatical errors even an elementary student would cringe at, it was quite refreshing to get the chance to read this book. While its not perfect, it's darn near close and certainly well worth the read. I throughly enjoyed the book and look forward to the next installment.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I personally did not read it but wife did and said it was a good read. She would recommend this book.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Great band and even greater album.  Can't stop listening to this all the way through.  Every time I listen to the first 3 songs I'm ultimately forced to keep listening to the album.  Reminds me of my time in CA and good memories.
B007FDE4Y8|2.0|This product is a great concept but it is almost impossible to use. Getting a proper calibration is the whole key of this stabilizer working...without a precise calibration, you can forget about a smooth shoot. I would recommend a cage with a weighted shoulder mount if you are planning to film with a DSLR camera.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|The sweeper cleans up on all sides so it can go sideways, backwards, and still pick up. It is easy to clean and take apart if you need to untangle threads from the bristles. We have a tile floor and would not recommend this for carpet.
B00BPQYWSO|5.0|Great album. Blake seems to successfully bridge the distinct sounds of his EPs to this previous LP. He is also so much more on point in terms of song-writing with this album, which I know he specifically sought to improve. His singing is crystal clear, extensive, and introspective.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this game although there are glithes every now and then but it is a great game I recommend it
B003VWU2WA|5.0|I used this with my photo booth, it's a perfect size, glows at the bottom to bring attention to it and just looks great!  Well worth the price.  The software that maps what it does is fairly easy to figure out and can be programmed to do lots of things.
B008H29YVY|5.0|Included are all of Wagner's mature operas. Each and every performance is excellent. In my view this is without doubt the best Wagner set on the market. And the price is a bargain.<br /><br />Note1: the libretti come on a CD ROM.<br />Note2: the Meistersinger included here is Solti's earlier studio recording.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|This has good characters and believable plot.  The movie does not follow the book; but is good none the less.
B005SJINTS|5.0|This recording of La Forza is a success. Levine's conducting is superb and all performers are dramatically involved and in a fine voice.. except Price - but by no means does she ruin the show. She was a great singer but here she is merely adequate whereas the other performers are excellent. Price sounds at times inappropriately shrill and harsh. I think she was simply not ideal for this role. Of the singers, praise goes especially to Domingo but also to Milnes and Cossotto. (Printed libretto not included)
B008OOYALE|4.0|I like the Kindle version, it's very addictive. Cool &#34;cross breed&#34; options. I've recommended it to my own wife(she became addicted to the other &#34;dragon&#34; game). The cell phone version, however, is not recommended. I've had it wake me up at 3am with &#34;announcements&#34; and there are far too many adds.
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|Another excellent sci-fi adventure for the intrepid Captain Honor Harrington. Fighting for a civilization that doesn't really want her there, against and enemy playing with a loaded deck :)
B005LAII8K|3.0|Like the actors and what the content story of the movie. Kept you engage with what was going to happen next.
B005XLN77O|4.0|I choose this rating because it combines a Barbie doll & clothes to design.  It's good for a child's creative side.<br />The refil set was nice, except it was hard to remove the dresses from their packaging.  A child could not do this alone, without damaging the dresses.  I also feel it needed to contain more than 3 markers, with a wider variety of colors & more accessories for decoration.  My granddaughter, age 6, loved it.
B004W1GCQO|5.0|The production, subject matter and acting are top notch. I love the historical element as well. Similiar to Downton Abbey but less fluff.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great Harry Bosch storyline. Love these mysteries and the people involved.  I wish you could write faster Michael Connelly !!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|The story goes on, the addiction continues, we can't stop watching these great episodes!  Part of our standard Thursday night routine to load up the BB DVD's and start watching during dinner and not stop till we pass out....which the excitment presents us from doing and we end up staying up later than we like.
B001V5CIFI|5.0|Terrific movie for children and very enjoyable for adults as well. No profanity, but cleverly placed life lessons for children.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|Do a lot of traveling like easy to watch episodes on flights or in boat.  Purchased first 3 seasons for X'mas gift and ended up watching all of them by March 1st.  Love it!  Can't get enough so went and purchased season 4 and I'll definatley be getting Season 5 once the price drops
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|Enduring & endearing story supported by an outstanding cast and crew. I've seen it several times in the last 10 years and it will never grow old - neither will I!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I really like the fact that with this app i just pull down the menu browser or whatever to find out how much power is remaining. Though to me the best part is knowing how much power is remaining using various features be it video, internet, or whatever. I would definitely recommend this to others.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best series, we have watched from the beginning and it is an addicting show!! We cancelled our cable and have a Roku box, so watching this through Amazon on the Roku box has been the best.  So we haven't missed an episode yet!  Can't wait for the next season!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|His books are so easy to read and always keep you turning the pages because you can't wait to get to the end and find out what happens.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I loved this book it was funny and easy to read but my only concern is that I think it should have been longer and have had a different ending but other than that it's okay
B00992CF6W|5.0|My Brother is 4 and when he plays this he goes so fast i cant keep up i love it to it is really cool i LOVEEEE it so buy it!!!!!!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|So far, google hasn't let me down. Anything I've wanted to search-up on my Kindle I was able to find through this search engine.
B000I5X81K|5.0|I have yet to hear a piece of music Josh Groban sings that I don't enjoy. This album /cd is a must have for your collection.
B005K17RU0|5.0|ung dung rat hay va thu vi, giao dien don gian de dung va chay rat muot ma. great app
0316224588|1.0|Detective John Rebus is getting old and Ian Rankin's characterization of his retired cop has gotten old right along with Rebus. Whereas Rebus's curmudgeonly attitude was somewhat endearing in earlier novels, this ill-tempered Rebus gets on one's nerves, especially when his behavior towards his long-time protege Siobhan Clarke becomes darn right mean. Calling this Rebus irascible is like calling Lindsay Lohan free-spirited.<br /><br />Rebus was always a sloppy, ill-kempt, hard-drinking, stinky (he smokes constantly and has yet to shower), disheveled (am I becoming redundant) embarrassment to the Lothian and Borders Police where until his literary retirement he worked. His refusal to follow the rules, the law, or his superior's direct orders were more than embarrassing, they were cause for disciplinary action which seldom amounted to anything, since Rebus got results. But even Rebus's outsider persona has gotten old. He's the sort of cop the Internal Affairs section of any modern police force would purge sans pension or benefits, and good riddance.<br /><br />But all this could be overlooked if Ian Rankin's plot held water, but despite Scotland's atrocious weather, featuring knee-deep puddles, it doesn't. The plot line is thinner than near beer, and Rankin is forced to pad his story with sub-plots and interludes with characters from Rankin's long line of Rebus novels, including Big Ger Cafferty, who has become a shadow of his former self -- sad to see the Edinburgh crime boss reduced to a Rebus drinking buddy.<br /><br />Rankin finally figures he has enough words in this mess to wrap it up and he does in one of the most ridiculous conclusions since the Greeks invented deus ex machina.<br /><br />I can't say I'm sorry Rebus retired. Now I just wish Ian Rankin would leave him be.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|Great opening and interesting, then sadly it falls into a repetitive dialogue. Still, all in all a great easy read. Heroic tales
B009R659L8|2.0|This book did not read like one of Mary Higgins Clark's book.  The prose was stilted, there were too many characters, and it was easy to tell who had committed the murders.  I was very disappointed.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I purchased this as a newby to the dvd excersise market. Its a tough workout but tough is good. It took  me a week or so before I could do the workout but thats ok, I was up for it. It has 3 different classes to move thru which helps fight boredom.
B00BLGZDVS|3.0|I debated my rating here--3 or 4.  Such an interesting film, great acting, intricate character study of a war-torn, wound-up violent personality.  But in the end, it didn't quite work.  Or maybe it was just too bleak to watch in the spring.
1600597963|5.0|This is a very nice book to learn about Bead Embroidery. Wonderful, color photos and nice paper. It is full of good information.
B005LAIGN2|3.0|How inaccurate is this film? Let me count the ways...<br /><br />Tuskeegee Airmen are gods of the air--real John Wayne-types. Two of them end up straffing a Nazi warship and killing hundreds (never mind the fact that German Navy NEVER LEFT PORT after 1943, with the exception of the U-boats)<br /><br />The godlike airmen attack a German airbase in a pair of slow, outmoded P-40s. We can see the ground guns scattered all over the place. They would have been shot down IN THE FIRST PASS.<br /><br />The Airmen down several Me-262 jet fighters in this film, one of them in a face-to-face duel (okay, ONCE a Tuskeegee airman shot down a 262 using an absolutely incredible maneuver shown in the film. I HOPE he won a medal). But according to Chuck Yeager, who flew the same skies and fought the same enemy, virtually ALL 262s were shot down as they attempted to land at their airbases. The Nazi jet planes were too fast to stop otherwise, even for P-51s (and despite the Messerschmit's lousy turning rate).<br /><br />A Tuskeegee Airman gets captured by Nazis, escapes, and is returned to his unit. Sorry but this NEVER happened. If you were shot down and escaped, you were sent to ANOTHER THEATER OF WAR to insure that if you were captured again you couldn't reveal to the enemy the identity of the French/Italian/Greek/Romanian/whatever Resistance fighters who got you to Allied lines.<br /><br />That said, the gear, machines, and planes you see are portrayed pretty accurately and the CGI was incredible. The action is cool if overplayed. In fanboyese this is WING COMMANDER, not THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK View this film as an incredible dogfight shooter videogame with a World War II theme and ignore the stupid, inane personal plots and you will have a good time.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Was hesitant to read the series as I was not comfortable with the subject matter.  However, given all the hype and that many of my associates were commenting, I thought I would give it a try.  Was hooked from the beginning and MockingJay was a suitable wrap up of the series.
B00196YNWU|4.0|A classic musical and great for kids. I love any movie musical that holds true to the stage performance. Recommended.
B004ZNA7WY|1.0|Take some \\"Wall\\"-like guitar plucking, some \\"Shine On\\" tubular guitar noodling, a bevy of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" chorus girls, stir it up with some reunion-with Roger Waters rumor mongering, and what have you got? That's right, get out your headphones, it's the \\"new\\" one from Pink Floyd (or more reverently, \\"Floyd\\"). In yet another example of the blatant formula gouging these guys have resorted to in order to keep the \\"Floyd\\" myth alive, and to further fatten their bank accounts, this lumbering behemoth is more than just a Floydian slip. Equal parts formula and rehash, \\"The Division Bell\\" is even more exploitative of the \\"Floyd\\" thing than it's patently derivative predecessor...what the hell was it called...something Floydian with another great cover. The covers are always great. Part of the \\"Floyd\\" thing. And with the passing of Strom Thurgeson, these guys are really up s***'s creek. But hey, let's face it, Pink Floyd has always been perceived as a great band to do good drugs by. And while good drugs and innovative music still go hand in hand, not since \\"Animals\\" or, arguably, \\"The Wall\\", have these guys breached any new ground convincingly. And that's forgivable enough, for at the end of the day, every band is selling their schtick, and a band's sound becomes their aural identity. But just imagine the fate of a new unsigned band trying to get over with this old bag of tricks. Pink Floyd used to get away with it because they usually delivered something new and interesting, love it or hate it. So in 1994, the goofy sound effects, the English voice monologue, the overused back-up singers, etc., all the perceived Midas touches hark back to the cash cow of their career, \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\". For anyone who remembers the experimental hits and misses of earliest Pink Floyd, after these architectural school dropouts deserted the only real musician in the band, Syd Barret, who put them on the map, (then replaced him with another real musician, Gilmore), then found worldwide success making records about how Syd lost his mind, it's easy to see why Roger chose the path he did, despite his interminable \\"Wall\\" rehashes. What has become lamentable in his wake is the awesome waste of talent and the sound arsenal of Gilmore and Floydco.  Notice how there's no song review yet? Well that's because you've already heard these songs in previous, sometimes several previous incarnations. Not only do these songs sound lazily conceived, you gotta wonder just how lazy the Floyd CEO's themselves are. For over twenty years Pink Floyd operated as a four piece live and in the studio, with maybe a guest singer here, a sax player there, but here there are enough extra players listed to constitute a corporate merger. You gotta wonder, who's playing what? One option is to get the DVD of the tour which should be titled, \\"The Exquisite Scent of Money\\".  Nope, \\"Arnold Layne\\" or \\"Astronomy Domine\\" this ain't. It ain't \\"Sheep\\", it ain't even no \\"Final Cut\\". This is borderline New Age from clever mythologists with alotta juice at the label. And the label knows there are enough sheep out there to plug into this \\"new\\" disc to cover everyone's mortgage, including the eight or nine extra Floyds. For an alternative Floyd fix, or at least curious speculation as to what \\"Floyd\\" might have sounded like in the 90's, check out Levitation, or anything from The Church. It ain't Floyd either, but it's a helluva lot closer to what \\"Floyd\\" set out to do before falling into their own trap.  Here was a chance for post-Waters Floyd to establish themselves as a freshly creative force for the 90's, and at the same time debunk Roger's charges of selling out the soul of Pink Floyd. Instead, we've got \\"The Division Bell\\". Plod on, you lazy slackers.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Well the leads you into a never ending what is go ing to happen next. There is 4 main chariactors in the story and morgan dances a lovely across all four people. then as a bit of spice to the mix there are other actions occuring that impact on the main story and charcators. I am in to book four and still not able to put it down. a great read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought this book after reading a review. The review did not even come close to how good a book this is. It is almost impossible to put down at night. I would definitely look for more from this author.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Like it but it has to remain on the home screen and would like to move to another location and it will not be moved? Am I doing something wrong?
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|I bought this on a whim and I can't stop listening. It's pure gold from start to finish... and it's definitely not your average &#34;radio&#34; album... which is a HUGE positive for me.
0783231032|5.0|Most awesome of movies and let me tell you why it was the old SAT Night crew in a crazy WWII in America viewpoint. WIN WIN WIN!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing story ....... It was so interesting, the entire book. I want to read more of these..... Love the style of writing as well!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My family loved this movie when we saw it in the theater so it was an obvious choice to buy it on Amazon. We are very pleased with the Blu-ray/DVD combo pack because we are able to watch it at home and in the car when we go on trips. Always a pleasure buying from Amazon!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Ponderously slow moving...but engaging.<br /><br />Characters are a bit hard to follow as they evolve and devolve.<br /><br />But, on the whole, worthwhile.  Superbly directed and costumed.
B00BW5K5DO|4.0|So far this game is going really good. Just got it and am on the pirate island and it has worked perfectly. I remember playing a similar game with an Egyptian theme. Same concept and I liked that one too. Worth the download.
B000FA675C|5.0|Was a great page turner. Didn't want to put it down. Had to keep going to see what would happen next.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|we are all looking for the secret or the key to our existence. some people think they have it but at the end if the day, it's just about trying your best while enjoying the ride and making good friends along the way.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|It is also gone along with the ex. But how do you rate a movie for Amazon? I enjoyed the movies and they played well on the Samsung player that was recently reviewed.<br />Was purchased thru Amazon.
B003PTP4S6|4.0|Ennio Morricone is a brilliant composer and Yo-Yo Ma is a brilliant cellist.  The combination is heavenly.  I took one star away because there is an abrupt stop/skip on one of the songs which ruins it.  If you can live with that I highly recommend the CD.
B00AKFG15S|3.0|Although I enjoyed it, the plot seems to have run out of steam and I felt the story was a bit too 'forced' and not up to Archer's usual storytelling standard.  Having said that, fans of the first two books should keep reading and be prepared for the next cliffhanger to make us gasp for the final (no 4) book.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was one of those books that I couldn't put down.  He has an incredible story, and tells it very well.  Great for sceptics and believers alike.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This author deserves every penny he has earned from his self-publication of this book.  One of the best books I have read this year.  I've already read Shift Omnibus Edition, and am looking forward to the rest of this series.  Highly recommended.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|The whole series is wonderful, entertaining, thought provoking, and interesting.  The basis of the books are closer than I think we realize.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|I was very happy with this purchase.  Unique sound that is a good listen.  I love all of the songs.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|Great CD!  Love the songs &#34;Beautiful With You&#34; and &#34;Break In&#34;.  Lzzy Hale has great vocals and has been featured in other songs in other bands, for example, &#34;Close My Eyes Forever&#34; with Device.  She also won a Grammy in March 2013.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Love the game, and the wide variety of add ons make it last a long time. You should buy this.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Another great year of this fabulous PBS series!  The characters are so well developed.  Looking forward to the fourth season, too!
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|I love this I am 67 yrs young and there are several puzzles they are all chalenging,and best of all they are fun..The game keeps your score and tells you what and how long you played..I ve just used for 2 weeks but I can not say that I see improvement except that it does make you concentrate more
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I enjoyed the book overall.  There were a couple parts of book which are slow.<br />Love when you know there is a twist and you think you have it figured out.<br />Good read.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is exciting and just plain fun! I love playing Diamond Dash anytime of the day. I would recommend this game for anyone!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This is truly one of the most addictive games I have played in a long time. I recommend this to anyone that likes bejeweled and jewel Quest
B003Y5H5HO|3.0|The DVD seems to be in full playing/ working order, but it is a burnt copy of the DVD. I intended to pay for a brand new copy of this film, not someone's made computer...
B009FZFONO|5.0|So addictive!!! Once you get started on watching this, you're not going to be able to stop! Great plot line!
B003B1X80Y|5.0|Every one knows the Notebook is a classic romance movie. Love this and will watch and rewatch for years to come!
0141345659|5.0|great book! wild book , I haven't got thru the whole book yet , but what I have read you will like.
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse has a good \\"feel\\" to it. Although I don't know how I feel about the rubberized grip for your thumb, it seems to make me feel sweaty. Build quality seems good and the software isn't too obnoxious. Mouse tracking is very smooth and configurable.
1451696191|5.0|awesome book! I don't want to spoil the book but it is written in the first tense. like writing in ones diary. good book
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I have not as yet viewed these 3 tapes due to priorities this time of year, but I look forward to having them and adding to them for my video library.
B00BU8RNCE|4.0|I chose this movie because of previous ratings.  This movie had no slow scenes, it has your attention every minute.  The people who actually lived on this Island according to the movie, did their best they could to help all that were lost and or injured.  Naomi Watts was great as a mother of three who gets great injuries.  Her love of her family and will to survive is fantastic.<br />The movie is worth seeing.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|coin dozed is a very additive. game It is a no brained but fun I would recommend it all ages
B009U9S6FI|4.0|I see there are 945 reviews of this book already, so I see no need to rehash the book contents. It's a very famous book, and this is the third time I've read it during my lifetime.<br /><br />The book is generally well written, although there is a fair amount of repetition at the idea level, and even quite a bit of verbatim repetition at the paragraph level. Part of the repetition comes from the structure of the book -- ideas explained in the first autobiography part of the book are sometimes cut and pasted into the second Logotherapy part of the book.<br /><br />Frankl's work on the meaning of life was a life-long study for him; apparently he gave a guest lecture on the topic while he was in his teens, as a young man. So the theory of meaning in life was not motivated by his prison camp experiences.<br /><br />I think the book is an interesting book, that contains some good original ideas on an important topic in life, written by an educated and thoughtful man. So I would recommend this work to anyone who is interested in perspectives on the meaning of life. It's interesting that the author can relate his theories to actual experiences in the German concentration camps.<br /><br />For readers who like books that blend theories of life with prison camp perspectives, I also recommend the following books:<br /><br />White Nights: The Story of a Prisoner in Russia (Menachim Begin), a superb book that explains how he used mental perspectives to distance himself from, and to ease the pain of, various kinds of torture while he was in prison.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0915031027 Coming Out of the Ice: An Unexpected Life]], a superb book about Victor Hermann, an American man's survival in a Siberian prison camp and his persistence in getting back into North America (I think he ended up living in Eastern Canada).<br /><br />[[ASIN:0817993924 Thoughts of a Philosophical Fighter Pilot (Reprint ed.)]], by James Stockdale, about his time as a Vietnam prisoner of war, and how he used theprinciples of Stoic philosophy to help him through the years of imprisonment.
1451695195|4.0|I can relate to the author's experience which says that when he was young, he would look up at the stars and suddenly start to float. The moment he got excited, he would plummet back to the ground. This scenario gave me more understanding of how Peter, a disciple of Jesus' walked on water and the moment he got too excited he started to sink.<br /><br />The author's statement, \\"The death of the body and the brain are not the end of conciousness, the human experience continues beyond the grave\\" is one you cannot argue with. His experience confirms that man is mortal but for Christians there is life after physical death. [[ASIN:B00B32EZ28 Taking Your Life to the Next Level: 7 Keys to Living the God Kind of Life]]
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Love the show. Audio and video quality mediocre. Half of the episodes I was kicked out due to buffering issues.  Did not affect all of the episodes just some. Love the series. Please fix the technical issues
145470246X|5.0|I simply loved the book. Each design is my favourite untill I start on the next one.<br />One day, I hope to have made a sample of each.<br />The layout, supplies & the steps are described in detail & easy to follow.<br />Love it!
B00004W50T|5.0|Must for Fans of the BAND before all the &#34;stuff&#34; happened.  Listen to how a great band is supposed to sound.  They set the standard
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|I &lt;3 this game!!! it is one of the best games in the world!! my daughter loves it, shes like... mommy look at the little green dude. he just killed a bug!! OH NO!! what will happen to the bug? will it go to bug heaven? anyway it is a really cute game. kinda like Mario bros. its the same main idea... just with a &quot;lep&quot; YOU SHOULD GET IT!! it is awesome!! ;-)
B009GXHOW4|5.0|I bought it and it was cool. Now I can fix everything I want! Buy it now morons.<br /><br />It is the best game ever! Buy it now and you will get everything!
B00A757EFW|5.0|The game is very comparitive to original.  I am from old school so this is great.  I like it and control is alright.  Need more power points, but yet the game is ok for me.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|This movie is 2 and 1/2 hours of a borefest. Typical looked decent in the previews and just sucked. Very disappointing.
B00AO686MY|5.0|I love this movie and bought for my son and he loves it too. I must have for any home :)
B00ARAN9JW|2.0|I've watched all of these movies, most were pretty good. This move seemed rushed. Nothing really came out of it. Just produced to make some money unfortunately. Ruined the franchise
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this is the coolest game ever it has cool things and ect and also this is my first time doing a review so don't jugde people
B00B7FW6U4|2.0|Could have done without it, I watched the other ones so I figured I would try to suffer through another. Bad mistake...
B00AB7HESI|3.0|This is not downloading!!! :( I'm gonna try again.I hope it works... I am a fan and want to play it. if It wont download I'm telling the people to give me my money back!
B005K17RU0|3.0|I use AccuWeather on both my home and work computer, and it works well. I am having issues though with my Galaxy SIII where it will not load the maps and sometimes does not load at all.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Capitan America, Black Widow, and the less known Hawk Eye all team up from their respected individual movies and come together for this awesome collabo! The only bad part about this movie (spoiler alert!!) is my beloved Agent Coulson... Okay, before tears start to whell we'll move on.. Action packed, filled with quips, and my favorite bad guy ever (Loki!!!!) This movie is awesome!
B007UW9VWO|4.0|I really enjoyed this but it is not for everyone. The technical side is excellent with good subtitles for the Japanese dialogue. It is A locked
B0094WK9GU|5.0|I questioned whether to buy the original version or the deluxe version and I couldn't be happier with my choice! The extra tracks are incredible! I Love SHM!
B00BGZ8TVA|4.0|lacks spiritual conclusiveness, meaning what was it all about?<br />Reality is not as much fun or as colorful as fantasy?
B002QRWJA4|5.0|This musical is a classic.  Even my six-year-old granddaughter asks to watch this movie and listen to the beautiful music each time she visits.  I never tire of watching it.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I like this app.Because you can make funny texts than textplus. Textplus is great but freezes. But this noooo.... it is fast like a jet!!&amp; I recommend this than textplus. But TextNow is really cool. Ya should buy tht too for FREE!!
B002PZJMU2|5.0|The Mentalist is one of our favorite TV series. We came into it after the first season and, even though later episodes have done an excellent job of filling in past shows, we are very pleased to have had the opportunity to watch the first episode in its entirety! The HD and commercial free showing also made it an excellent experience!
B001ERMYCA|2.0|I don't know about you, but when I listen to LP, one of my favorite parts is the gapless song transition such that when I listen to Meteora by itself, it's much more satisfying than listening to a mixed playlist.<br /><br />This particular album has songs whose timings are all wrong; the transition between Don't Stay & Somewhere I Belong is off, as is the transition b/w Figure.09 and Breaking the Habit, as well as Easier to Run into Faint. I had to purchase the iTunes album to get a truly gapless album.<br /><br />If you're just after a single song, buy this album by all means - but in purchasing an album, you want the whole. From what I can tell, amazon's versions of Meteora are totally off on this count. Buy, yes - it's an EXCELLENT album - but from somewhere else.
B0031RSBU0|4.0|Kurt Wallander is a Swedish detective who is the main character in a series of novels by Mankell. As with the other books the interest is sustained as the mystery is gradually solved.  The only jarring note is the love interest that Wallander develops with a Latvian widow which seems rather improbable for both of them.
B008LCRAC0|5.0|Funny show!<br /><br />Still sad to see it end.
B001DJLCRC|4.0|Arrived early.  My husband's favorite show.  This was the very best price I found on season one.  It did not disappoint him.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a great game and very interesting if you like to build stuff in games and create your own city.
B0067R0APK|3.0|Provides only limited information.  Map needs to provide more display options like 24 hr precipitation.<br />Also a little awkward to navigate.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a great game and I haven't had to spend a dime and  I am at level 15. Graphics are wonderful as well
B00AB2NYNC|5.0|Love Mumford  & Sons and this CD does not disappoint.  Something about their music just makes you want to put the CD on repeat. The music really goes to your soul - I remember this feeling when I first heard U2 and then Dave Matthews Band.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game! It goes on &amp; on,level after level. If you enjoy hidden object games, then you have to at least try this one!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I got this game since have enjoyed the other jewels game.  This Jewels Star is very similar in some ways (classic mode of play) but has several new & different ways to play also that are more challenging.  It doesn't take too much strategy so I can play while watching TV.  Annoying is when it says &#34;no more move&#34; instead of no more moves (with an s ending).  I think it's well worth downloading this FREE game.
B001O1O71C|5.0|Very good book for 8th graders to be learning about the holocuast a terrible time for some people. Good reading
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting. Everyone knows how to play this game. My 2 year old little sister knows how to play it! I even love saying the name. My highest score is 3,023,584
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun game but just when you think you are making headway you become stymied.  Frustrating!!!!  Recommend it to every one.
B00377V6J2|5.0|It's so sad to know that they both will not be playing anymore together on this earth, but their legacy will go on forever!  The DVD makes this session unforgettable and is a real bargain!
B00B23O96A|1.0|More nonsense from Mr Clapton who has been rehashing the same tired bluesy licks for close to 30 years now. Please, either stop recording or take some lessons from Jeff Beck on how to grow and try new things as an artist.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I got this because I was tired of LogMeIn changing their prices all the time.  This software is faster, more compatible, and also streams video extremely well.  I've been super happy with this app.
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|We did not like this movie.  We like opera, but this movie did not work as a musical.  It was over-dramatic and very slow-moving, which was emphasized when the songs were being sung.  It just didn't hold our interest, despite good acting by Russell Crowe, Hugh Jackman, and the little lady who played the young girl who was rescued.
B009DJB8I2|5.0|If you're a fan of the Portal series at all, this soundtrack is great.  Not to mention the in-game TF2 item!
B000WT7R6O|5.0|You know the show, you love the characters, this season continues the upward trend of quality, substantive storytelling, humor, drama and horror.  The peak will not hit until the ending of season 5, but plateau in a really comfortable place post-season 5.  Who would have thunk this show would become one of the truly great cult classics of TV?
0425252868|5.0|Excellent Read!  This book gives a different perspective of WWII; one from the soldiers point of view.  No matter the situation we are all still human beings!
B000FA675C|5.0|This book is great and keeps you totally captivated.  It is a very hard read to put down.  A Must read!
1451673442|5.0|This book contains the recipe for a wonderful life.  It is really just common sense but does remind us to be a nicer, kinder person and to focus on happiness and what we strive to do with our life.
B001KPYNR0|5.0|Her songs and arrangements delight all. Wish she would bring out more albums oftener. She is a joy to listen to.
1476734941|3.0|Not just another diet book.  An easy way to limit your intake.  I wish it had a synopsis at the end that would list the 7 important steps........I don't really like the wordiness of the book.  It doesn't really get to the point.  Trying to add pages I think.  But the basic ideas are really good and if you take the time to sift through and write down the important steps, you have a pretty good chance of getting healthier.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great story not what I expected. The writer gets you so involved you can feel every emotion, every desire and all the anticipation. I am sorry to end the story it left me wanting more.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|It was a nice movie....But didn't realize it was based on a true story until the end of the movie.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I love games like this and I cannot wait until part two...It has good graphics and a good story. A shout out to the designers and their team. I highly recommend this game.
0446576220|5.0|I love Tony's passion to commit to customer service. In fact, I think that's what got Zappos to work. I'm probably going to read this book TWICE before giving it to someone else to take a look at it too. It's amazing.<br /><br />If you don't have money to buy this book, I suggest you go borrow from the library.
B00BC0JI6O|5.0|I like this band better without Neil Morse. Songs are much tighter, less pompous, and harder-edged. Just listen to that one-hour Whirlwind monstrosity to get an idea what happens when Morse goes off the rails as a songwriter. That album from Transatlantic was a total rip-off. About 3/4 of it is filler material. Some of the earlier Spock's Beard material approached this level of pomposity and vapidity as well. Why can't certain prog bands just write tight songs that have the prog elements as well? Proto Kaw does. Asia in its last couple of CD's does. Mystery does. IQ certainly does (they do this better than anyone!) And I am happy to say that Spock's Beard - without Morse - does this in spades. Not one bad song on the album. Great jams. Beautiful melodies. All instruments have their day in the sun on a solo basis. I love this album and I am on my 10th-plus spin already.
B000VR824S|5.0|Holy smokes, does this Blues &#34;rock&#34;!!!  I &#34;FEEL&#34; the music!! These artists are phenomenal!! Each one is better than the next or previous, depending upon how one &#34;listens&#34; to them. One just can't help but to dance/MOVE while listening/watching!!!  (sorry about my overuseage of exclamation marks, but I’m just trying to portray as to how GOOD this is!!)
B00BPA2PBG|5.0|After seeing this on Amazon's website, since Ghostbusters will be presented in 4K, this will be brilliant on Blu-Ray players. The first Blu-Ray did not look so good with a lot of grainy images,  however it isn't the makers fault as this film was shot in late '83 to early '84 before CGI really took off.  Long story short, I will buy this film once it is released. God bless Blu-Ray!  Since next year is the 30th anniversary, hopefully Ghostbusters will be re-released to theaters again for a few weeks!  Where does time go? 30 years almost. Unbelievable!
B000FA675C|5.0|Excellent novel.  Keeps you turning pages.  I could not put it down.  The author, Dan Brown, has written several more novels in this genre.
1616550414|5.0|in depth history of the Zelda games such as, a time line of all the games and pictures of the characters throughout the years
B000FVNX2Q|4.0|I got it for my finance courses in school and its a great tool for proofing the manual work in the exercise, but it will take me some time to learn the functions and all short cuts. I do recommend it, but I gave it 4 starts as its not something (I consider) the inexperience user should get at first glance.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game was so addicting. I am a person that enjoys a challenge and an interesting concept despite repetition. I sat around playing this game for 4 hours at a time. So Fun
1451695195|3.0|Boring except the last 20 pages.  Written by an amateur.  Old topic and no much added.  Not worth saying anything more
B008S0IJAM|3.0|I have been a fan of Aimee Mann since 1985 when Til Tuesday was a last second replacement warm-up act for Daryl Hall and John Oates on their BIG BAM BOOM tour in New Haven, CT. (I later learned they were hand picked by Daryl Hall himself.) I followed Til Tuesday until the early 90's when I lost track of them. I discovered Aimee's WHATEVER cd in 1995 and loved it. Then BACHELOR #2 in 2000 was pretty good. Lost track of her again until recently. I listened to all sample tracks for her albums after BACHELOR and was struck today by the fact they nearly all sound the same. Some are melodic and different tempo-ed but they all sound like they were recorded on the same day. Nothing wrong with that if you like it. I guess I just miss her early solo and Til Tuesday sound. More punch and color to it.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|This was an amazing Epic movie, that I did see in the theater, but knew from the moment that I saw it that I was looking forward to seeing it again once it came out on video, and I was not disappointed! Not only is the story within this so compelling and strong, but bringing in the talents of Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field, Tommy Lee ones and so many more, you are simply transported into a different time and place, so unlike our own. You get to see and experience Lincoln, not only as a President, but as a man troubled by so much around him. The movie does an amazing job at helping the viewer to get to know this amazing President from our history. You also get to feel the true divide within the country in regards to racial tension between the people, let alone the States. This is the type of movie that for me made history come alive and I cannot say enough good things about it. On top of the movie, within the 4 disc pack that I watched, I was happy to find it packed with amazing bonus features that allow you to get inside the making of the movie - which was something that especially for this movie I wanted to see and you will too!<br /><br />*I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*
B003CHGV74|5.0|I watch so many shows and in particular British drama and I must say this is absolutely one of the best dramas I have ever seen, it is riveting drama and first class and you will not be dissapointed
1617751588|5.0|I had never heard of Simon before, but as a cat lover this was such a funny book filled with so many cartoons that any cat lover will appreciate. Tofield is able to capture the true personality of a cat in these fun drawings, and if you have ever owned a cat you will definitely be drawn in. If you are like me you will definitely laugh hard through this, and even without words Tofield is able to convey so much to the reader.  The whole premise of this book surrounds a new kitten being introduced into the home and Simon's reaction to this. Having gone through this type of transition with another cat, I could see some similar reactions from my own cat in Simon which made this book even more fun to read through!<br /><br />Overall this was a great book that any cat lover will enjoy!<br /><br />* I received a copy for review - all opinions are my own*
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a great book. I now have a new viewpoint of God and His omnipotence. I truly recommend this.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I had seen the play twice and loved it. I was hoping the movie would be great and it delivered.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I used to surf the net looking for information on training to create muscle, what to eat whilst making muscle etc. there is so. There is so much information. I purchased this book and I must say it's full of everything I need to make my training sessions and nutrition rock! Mike has really nailed it with this book so easy to read and great book of reference.
B009VSW15Y|3.0|fair on the user friendly side, but poor resolution and of course its not able to help with the fact that you can't take a picture of anything facing away from the screen, but that really the Kindle's fault.

B00BUVPIRS|1.0|Every single rpg game I ever play has only male for the gender options. So I waste my precious money every time and I personally think the game makers should have put the option for female
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Just like my title says, and little more needs to be added!<br />I have seen the movie twice so far, and I'm not done, yet.<br />&#34;Life of Pi&#34; ranks with the best movies I've seen in my nearly seventy years!
1593272200|5.0|I would go into detail as to why this book is so great, but seeing as I'm a developer, I'm lazy by nature and will only recommend that you get this book, devour it, and prepare a spot on the self for often referenced books.
B0067AC5KA|3.0|The first book was really good.  The second book was ok, I didn't like the way the developed the girl in this book.  The third book was better and they did a good job keeping the characters consistent.  Part of the reason why I gave it 3 stars instead of four was because the way the first book ended.  I kept expecting more about that in the next books but it never got developed.  But I guess it was consistent with the characters.  I don't want to say to much about specifics so not to give anything away.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game! And I love that it doesn't have anything bad with it, and it's a game for all ages!
B002KKCVX2|5.0|I've had tevas in the past and enjoyed them. these are no exception. i like the good arch support and excellent overall fit.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|The drugs aren't a major factor in the love story.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal is a pharmaceutical salesman so he is legal. Anne Hathaway is in Stage One Parkinson's so any drugs she takes are medicine.<br /><br />This movie might be considered a &#34;chick flick&#34; by some.  I liked it regardless.  It is funny and it is sad, but it is never dull.<br /><br />Jake's character is a man that never really cares strongly for anyone or anything.  He simply wants to make his fortune as quickly and easily as possible and ethics are not a concern.<br /><br />Then he meets Anne.  What happens to Jake when faced with the possibility of being connected to a woman who may grow progressively less able to care for herself is the crux of the movie.
B0064MT1SA|5.0|A great homage to an artistic genius. A movie that really covers the person's life. The special features are also helpful.
0743201140|5.0|This book was excellent and has changed my life...you should try it also! It was a quick read for me and the results were great.
0307456633|5.0|Loved the book, had read it before but am reading the whole series and wanted to refresh my memory before I started on the next one.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|The 1990's version with Stallone just seems silly after watching 'Dredd'. The movie was well done and enjoyable. I thought that the dark tone throughout the movie stayed true to the comics that I remember reading as a kid, too bad it didn't do well at the box office as I think a sequel would have been great. Overall this movie is definitely worth buying or renting.
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Great addition to the Kindle.<br />The stand up option is a must when reading in bed.<br /><br />We love it!<br /><br />Jvc
B000000OQF|5.0|GnR's debut album is still sounds every bit as raw and amazing as it did 25 years ago.  Hearing Slash and Izzy trading licks throughout never gets dull.  The lyrics and Axl's singing still evokes the drug fueled nightmare of late 80's Los Angeles.  This is easily the best hard rock album of the popular hard rock/heavy metal scene of the 80's and early 90's.<br /><br />The only regret on hearing the album again is that there weren't a dozen more Guns n Roses albums just like it.  There should have been, they had the talent and songwriting skill, but that was not to be.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was very twisted and weird, but I really liked it. I couldn't put it down! Very good read!

B00BI73CVI|4.0|Amazing acting and great singing is what you'll see in this movie! No wonder Anne Hathaway won an Oscar. You have to see this movie!

Maybe it's the eternal need to sometimes simply escape that we all share...
B006LSZECO|2.0|This novel captured my attention right away, and I was curious to see how the story would develop. By midpoint, I began to suspect that the author could not resist adding another, then another, and yet another highly unlikely twist to the story.  I made myself read to the end, and regretted having done so.  This novel is a wearying, endless mess.
B00001X590|5.0|Pop music resurrects a specific time in our personal histories, and for me this album, particularly with the title track and the hit &#34;Feelin' Alright,&#34; is like boarding a time machine.  Cocker was a terrific talent and on &#34;Friends&#34; he's supported by a brilliant cast of musicians (Steve Winwood being one).
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Eye opening. But very depressing. I think next time.I'll.go with  a romance or read.the reviews first. Don't get me wrong. I enjoyed it. But, I'm depressed and sad for Charlie.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|The kids love it... From my 3 year old to my 11 year old...they just want to watch it over and over again. Worth owning if you have kids...or a kid at heart!
B00AB0Z88S|4.0|Although it's boring in the beginning of the movie. But it start to get exciting after Pi was lost in the middle of the sea.<br /><br />The story line is so good that it try to prove God existence. In the end, there when he share his story, the real story and the fake story, people chose to believe the fake story. That's because people don't believe what they don't see, but it exists. Just like God is anywhere but we can't see God, we can only believe without hesitation.<br /><br />Also, I like the scene, it's so beautiful especially the night with some shinning livings in the sea.<br /><br />Love it.
B005VPRETE|5.0|Very nice set for a 6yr old! It has many pieces but clear and concise directions so my daughter was able to complete it with little help from me.
B0086700CM|5.0|Hones your reflexes by avoiding repetative situations, constantly changing and challenging you.  Really gets the adrenaline going and makes you focus.  Sure makes the time go fast.
B00BU2SIW4|5.0|What I love most about this album is that it sounds a lot like some of their older work. Sounds of the Universe was good but it lacked a certain vibe and sound to it that their older albums had which is why I fell in love with this band. Delta Machine brings me back. It's the perfect album to sit in the car at night with your eyes closed and the volume up and get lost in the music. There are so many great songs on this album. I can't even pick a favorite. Highly recommended.
B007SGM084|5.0|I read this trilogy with an open mind and I am so glad I did. U truly enjoyed them. I felt my heart break for Christian n Anastasia. Her inexperience but willingness to learn n her determination is superb. How he goes from a control freak to a loving man, that journey kept me wanting to know more. I held read it again n again. I held recommend it to all my friends n family. I LOVED it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1400052181|5.0|This was a very well written and informative book. If covers a wide variety of interests such as: ethics, biology, science, sociology, minority rights, etc. The book explains the progression of cell research, patient rights, and modern vaccines through the use of HELA. It also adds information and first-hand accounts from Henrietta Lack's family, adding a personal note to the story. I found it particularly interesting to read how doctors created the polio and HPV-18 vaccines, as well as influencing many popular drugs used for chemo and other major diseases and illnesses.<br /><br />It's also a good book to read for fun. I found it easy to read, and Rebecca Skloot does a good job of using rhetoric that anyone can understand.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book! It should be required reading for anyone studying ethics or medicine.
B004W1GCQO|4.0|I was looking forward to this series, having just watched all of the original US/DS for the first time. The character of Agnes is not as charming or interesting as all of the Mrs. Bellamys in the original but I enjoyed the 3 episodes enough to wish there were more. I am overjoyed that Amazon Instant Video is providing this series with closed captioning since I do not hear.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was awesome! I couldn't put it down. It is a must read, and of course you must read the 3rd one as well which is just as exciting.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|simply awful...I heard good things about this movie. So, I watched it. And... it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|There is ZERO story here.<br />Do you remember this old Seinfeld bit:<br />George:What about a show about nothing?<br />Jerry:Are you out of your mind? Okay, what would happen in show?<br />George:What did you do today?<br />Jerry:Well I got up, I took a shower, got dressed, and came here.<br />George:There's a show, that's a show!<br /><br />That is this movie.<br />Characters do nothing for nothing that amount to nothing and started from nothing.  There are no payoffs or punchlines.<br /><br />The only redeeming quality this movie has is the Melissa McCarthy outtake scene during the credits.  Yes, the one scene, trimmed in the movie and put in the credits, is the best part of the movie.  It is not worth the cost of admission.<br /><br />Skip this Not funny movie.  You have been warned.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|Don't usually watch romantic type comedies but I find it funny, truthful, and real. Anne Hathaway keeps a guys attention as well..
1594487154|5.0|That Daniel Pink has been identified as one of this nations top 50 business thinkers is no surprise.  His books have been in the forefront of \\"changed thinking\\" for well over a decade.<br />That we all sell is not a new concept but how Pink makes his case is brilliant; well written and eminently readable.<br />As a speaker who knows and -has little time for -the \\"blue suede shoes\\" variety of persuaders, Pink deftly nails the old-school shark skin suiters.<br /><br />  To Sell is Human is a must read.
B001NXDSLQ|5.0|&#34;Woodstock: Three Days of Peace and Music&#34; is a blast from the past. Being a hippie in the sixties the DVDs took me back to a simpler time when all you really did need was love. Great flashback! Great music! Good vibrations!

0984725113|3.0|Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee are right to choose the `end of work' explanation of the current economic crisis. It is clear a priori that increased productivity will reduce employment for the same GDP output. This has the further effect of reducing effective demand in the economy. In a thought experiment of a totally automated economy, where a machine could simply be plugged into the earth and generate the total output GDP, there would be no wages and no demand. Distribution of GDP would have to be by government voucher. So ultimately the only solution is a universal credit or a citizen's income. Money becomes clearly virtual in this model - the vouchers are simply printed and destroyed. They do not have to be added as government debt. The only rule is that they must be linked to the output GDP they are distributing. These are important paradigms for policy in the current crisis.<br /><br />Brynjolfsson and McAfee don't look at these implications or remedies. Instead they advocate that more people become high technology employees and entrepreneurs. But this doesn't address the problem if automation will then render further employment redundant. Unless the result of their prescriptions is taken as infinite levels of GDP?<br /><br />Geoff Crocker<br />Author `A Managerial Philosophy of Technology : Technology and Humanity in Symbiosis' Palgrave Macmillan 2012

Battery life is stellar.<br /><br />I wish the build quality were a bit better, but for the price it is hard to complain. Highly recommended if your headphones need just a bit more umph.
B002UWH8P6|5.0|This series was very imaginable, great cast after a somewhat bumpy start wit the characters. Cast yelled better and better as the show progressed.  Sad to have seen it end so soon.

B003MC5N28|4.0|I read this book for the first time in 7th grade, and I didn't really enjoy it very much then. Now, 7-8 years later, I honestly enjoyed the book. I can see why there wasn't much description of characters or anything now.<br /><br />It's easy for a smaller child to read, but to get the understanding, takes a maturity level and a real grasp on the concept.

B0015T6G2G|5.0|Long walk to freedom is an elaborate and very candid account from the pespective of one Nelson Mandela, an ordinary boy from the rural who found himself at odds with the white man's system that marginalized black people just by the colour of their skin (apartheid). From hereon the struggle to right the wrongs of the system beggings.<br />What I like about the book is honesty. A lot of people who know parts of Mandela's story would assume that he confronted life the Hollywood style, like a super hero. You come to learn some invaluable lessons about the ways to get your way while avoiding uneccessary confrontations.<br />The book should be compulsary literature in primary schools of every progressive democratic society.
B00ADQCBEY|4.0|If you can bring yourself to root for the \\"bad\\" guy then this is the show for you. An amazing example of the antihero genre.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|This documentary is what other documentaries wish they were. The characters present a clear narrative that is fully-realized by the director. The production value is positively divine. They clearly spent tons of time and money producing this, which really shows a clear respect for the film's subject. I was raised on Bob Marley, so I like to think I know more than the average teenage girl about him. I learned a ton, and I was really pleasantly surprised by that. Plus the soundtrack obviously rules. You should watch this documentary.

B005NPLXJ4|4.0|First off I am not a huge fan of either artist, Lou solo has done some remarkeable material and Metallica I just have never liked. This cd is more like Iggy and the Stooges pick any cd by them. It rocks and finds somewhat quieter moments. I was actually suprised that I liked it. Not going to go into a track by track description, this is more like Lou's Rock N Roll Animal merged with anything from Iggy since Instinct and the Stooges entire career.

B0071XO8RA|2.0|Interesting idea that could have been a great adventure story/thriller and/or a fascinating psychological assessment of human behavior.  Unfortunately, it was neither.  As a thriller it was too drawn out.  As a psychological study, character development was too shallow, and there wasn't enough meaningful dialog about motives or analysis of the situation in which characters had to operate.
B001XULSG6|5.0|As usual first contact brings the great expectations of a star trek movie. You can't miss with it. Borg style
B00846REIS|4.0|Great read just as addictive as Fifty Shades, but it was missing the innocence of Mrs.Grey. I will begin reading Reflected in You!
B001XUPH9K|5.0|It was notable from the series that they did a follow up movie excellent movie once again I am an trek fan.
B009GX6SSK|5.0|I love Kensi and Deeks and this season just brings out the best in those characters!  Can't wait for season 5!
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|I had a hard time putting this down.  The heroine is clever and engaging, the hero is perfect (good looking, smart, and with a conscience).  The issues that keep them apart were unfolded in a way that kept me riveted.  For those who like historical romances, this is a great book.<br />If new to this series I would recommend reading the prequel (Governess Affair) first.  However I would skip the supposed 2nd book in the series (Kiss for Midwinter) as it is a very short novella about Minnie's friend Lydia, not a novel in itself but more of a short story.

On German Import Audiophile Virgin Vinyl on the Inside Out label the sound on these 2 LPs is stunning!

If you're lucky enough to find it on the German record label with incredible sound you're in for a big treat!
0375507256|4.0|Cloud Atlas is a collection of six seemingly unrelated vignettes, beginning with the story of an American Notary Public (apparently quite a prestigious position for the era) in the 19th century South Pacific seas.  The stories proceed chronologically through the present day and into a post-apocalyptic future set in Hawaii.  At that point, they reverse, revisit and complete the previously told stories.<br /><br />The technique used in the novel is certainly interesting, and given the proper set of stories and linchpins, could have been intriguing.  However, the stories are, in fact, not related in any way and only tied together by the loosest of references.  Therefore, what we have are six short stories (novellas) which are split in two.  The absence of a unifying theme or common element actually works against the enjoyment of the stories.  For example, the first story, involving the sea voyaging American Notary Public proceeds for roughly 40 pages before ending mid-sentence.  Four hundred pages later it takes up again mid-sentence.<br /><br />With the exception of the final two stories, which are begun and finished relatively close together because of the nature of the serpentine order, the reader is tasked to recall the names, locations and fact situations that existed and were then abandoned hundreds of pages earlier.<br /><br />I found the stories themselves to be quite well written and enjoyable.  The fifth, focusing on a dystopian Korean society in the not distant future, featuring a sub class of manufactured drones, some of which are attaining increased sentience, was brilliant.  The final vignette, set in post-apocalyptic Hawaii, I found to be irritating, due to the pidgin English employed.  It is as if nuclear Armageddon will somehow convert the survivors into back woods hillbillies as it relates to the English language.<br /><br />In any event, the stories were entertaining and at times compelling.  The technique used by the author detracted from my enjoyment of the work, and given the absence of any unifying element, raises the question of what he hoped to achieve, other than originality.  My advice is to read the first half of the first story, and when it switches to story number two, go to the back of the book and find where the story continues.  Read each story in its entirety, chronologically.  I cannot imagine what would be forfeited using such a strategy, and you'll enjoy the first three or four stories more fully.<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER HAVING SEEN THE MOVIE:<br /><br />I saw the movie after having read the book, and am glad I did so.

My advice is to read the first half of the first story, and when it switches to story number two, go to the back of the book and find where the story continues.  Read each story in its entirety, chronologically.  I cannot imagine what would be forfeited using such a strategy, and you'll enjoy the first three or four stories more fully.<br /><br />UPDATE AFTER HAVING SEEN THE MOVIE:<br /><br />I saw the movie after having read the book, and am glad I did so.

B0034G4P7G|3.0|This movie was okay. I have seen better, but I have seen worse movies, too. Nevertheless, it's pretty entertaining, and a good movie to watch to keep your mind occupied.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I was very happy to see Rebus back again. Did the rabid fans convince Rankin to write another Rebus mystery [complete with hateful depictions of the internal affairs folks about which he began another series] or did the publisher convince him? I'm grateful either way.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I am a big fan of the books and this first season has been very true to my vision of Westeros and the Seven Kingdoms, the Wall, and even the White Walkers. The casting is superb as well. One difference that I find very interesting is that for whatever reason, the screenwriters have made some of the characters more emotionally complex, and thus, sympathetic. Of course, I'm thinking of Cersei, for one. If I were married to Robert Baratheon of the series, I'd seriously think about having him killed too. ;)  I don't feel that sympathy when reading about her in the books. In any case, I'm thoroughly enjoying the television series, and I think even if one hasn't read the books, they will be able to understand the series with little problem.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very clever. These two deserve each other in spades. Funny, scary, nuts...I'd read another of her's given a chance. Go Flynn
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Most fun I've had with this sort of game. Very playable. You can also advance without having to get into your wallet. Most games I've enjoyed have turned sour because you get to a certain point and realize your gonna have to spend money. Not so with hungry shark.. definitely worth your time.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have tried several weather apps for Android. This is definitely the best. Now I can dump the others. Why waste the space?
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I am loving the temple run 2 it is so exciting. I am not completing with other<br />because I want to get more use of the game.  I just love the chase and run.<br />and yes I would recommend this game for all ages.
B004EF8AJA|5.0|The story held my attention and showed a part of England's history that I've not seen before. It shows people as imperfect, which is what we are.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|such a good read, Martin continues his tale and there are many wonderful parts that happen and he leaves you on so many cliff hangers you'll be anxious for him to release the 6th book.
B00000DHRX|5.0|This was an excellent cd.  It arrived quickly and the price was fantastic.  There was even a song I had been looking for for years.  Awesome buy!!
B00AB0Z88S|3.0|Visual effects were fantastic the moral of the story did not set well. I'm not sure that substitution a beautiful myth for a terrible experience is healthy.
B00A3AYI50|5.0|I not only love the sound of Phillip Phillips' voice, I also love the varying tunes. Each song on this album, including his unique and soulful cover of &#34;Wicked Game,&#34; is fabulous. I continue to listen often, and always find myself singing along with many of the songs on this wonderful album.
1594203334|1.0|(The audiobook version is what was purchased.) The reader's fake \\"French\\"- and \\"British\\"- accented English is so irritating that the very few interesting points were almost missed and is main reason for such a low rating. This is a book written only to make money. Neither the author nor her spoiled-little-boy husband are likeable. I listened to the book in short segments, while exercising, and didn't hear much of anything that wasn't laughable. I don't recommend it for anyone who is serious about learning to parent. Ask your parents and friends (of any nationality or ethnicity) who have well-behaved, well-nourished children for tips. Definitely don't waste your money on this superficial \\"wisdom.\\"
B00A8ECU24|2.0|The graphics are the only redeeming factor in this review. The game is hard to navigate, hard to figure out what to do. When my kid or I find a game to play it costs anywhere from $10-$100 to get coins, etc. Seriously, everywhere and everything in this game costs $$$, make sure you have locks set so whoever is playing can't rack up a huge bill!
B005HEJ2DK|5.0|Watched this on Prime online.  Star Trek Enterprise.. an Awesome series!!  I would recommend it to anyone that would like to watch a top notch show with a group of actors that is more like a family.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Fast moving, great story line. I recommend it for an easy read while traveling or at the beach. I enjoyed the new characters.
B00BLCHZC2|3.0|I like watching the show, but I am totally against all the violence. But, I know that was their culture at the time. This is a time in History that I need to read up on. And this show has sparked my interest in the Vikings and the history of the area and  how they lived. We are hooked now and need to see this to the end.
B008Y73940|4.0|Excellent movie.  Fast paced, great actors and plot.  Would recommend to family and friends.  Easy to stream with Amazon Prime.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I was hooked on this book after the first few pages. I never thought it would end the way it did.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I only recently became acquainted with this series because of amazon prime video but wow looking forward to mockingjay!!!<br />Peers Rules!
B000UVT3OI|5.0|This album has the other hits i couldn't get elsewhere. Great album, in great shape. Very happy with the purchase and the fast service
B001UTW7QU|5.0|If for no other reason, watch Fringe to see John Noble as Walter Bishop.  He's an incredible actor, who is undoubtedly underrated.<br /><br />There are lots of other reasons to watch Fringe.  All reasons put together, in short, make the show is highly captivating and thought provoking.
B003L0V758|5.0|I ♥ me some Janelle Monae! She did not fail to deliver on this album. The music is eclectic and there isn't a track that I don't like.
B009AOFNU4|4.0|This product is great for iOS<br /><br /> First off I am very careful when I decide to buy something and plenty of research have gone into other potential candidates. My main purpose of buying this was to relive my old retro gaming glory days, this works wonder and has been tested on Snes, Sega, Nes, and Neo Geo on an iPad Mini.<br /><br />The build quality is top notch, ergonomics are wonderful for extended play and large hands, and the rechargeable battery and portability are great for a quick game anytime.<br />The only 2 thing I would like to see is that more developers would provide more support for modern games, and a lower price point.
0920668372|1.0|I don't see any middle ground with this book.  Either people love it or they hate it.  If you found Love You Forever disturbing -- seriously -- you're with me.  One of our grandkids' babysitters suggested we buy it for a birthday and told us it was deeply moving.  We read it and thought about telling our son to fire her?  What kind of deranged stalker mom is this book about???  We love our kids forever, too, but we hope to and healthy functioning adults out into the world, not chain them to us.  Now that they're adults, we definitely do not plan to sneak into their bedrooms at night and rock their unconscious bodies while they're asleep.  This book is downright creepy.  I suggest avoiding it.<br /><br />One star.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I use this app every day, all day (and night), weekdays &amp; weekends (+ holidays). For business, family, medical, education, and every other little detail of, not only my life,  but - since it seamlessly integrates with my &amp; all connected Google calendars - most of those in my life!<br /><br />It's perhaps the first truly iNet integrated (see &quot;Web&quot;) app I've found that found that truly works. It's completely customizeable, if preferred. After using the defaults for a fewweeks, I modified a few screens, added some custom color coding for consistancy and ease of data input and acquisition. I exported my settings, of which CalenGoo is one of the very few providing the option. Sent it to a few family members trying the app, which they imported, &agrave;nd we were all ob the same page (literally) collaboratively maintaining a calendar, tasks and events. It significantly improved the ease of use for everybody.<br /><br />We made several revisions, testing each, then deploying. The combination of app services (Google Calendar + CalenGoo) has been an extraordinary asset to our personal and private&hellip; all of our life.<br /><br />The Financial aspect is even greater. There's a total of $5.99 invested. Estimate the cost of the number cell phone calls not made to clarify scheduling. Estimate a  year's cumulative cost of conflicting or missed events. What's it worth to have the family, your employees, salesforce or must yourself organized on all of your devices - with the same appearance on all, without having to configure each individually?<br /><br />I've used CalenGoo for over a year on four quite different devices and, amongst the 30 in our little group, more than 80 devices - flawlessly. Kudos to Guina. UG! I wish I'd developed it first.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband, who is a history buff...current and past. He loves this movie so much that he watches it almost every day.  This movie is based on actual facts, which makes it all that much more intriguing.  I highly recommend this movie to those that are into this type of story. It's not just a man's movie...I like it too as a lady. I saw the actual story on the History Channel and it featured some of the real people involved.  This movie was a perfect match to the actual events that took place as the History Channel showed what really happened from actual file footage.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Great movie, exciting story, watched it at least three or four times and I still hope there will be a John Carter 2 movie someday. Would love to see how the John Carter story continues.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This is a great movie, especially if you like Ben Affleck.  My husband really likes this movie and he watches it quite often.  I like the fact that it has a love story included, not just a shoot em' up bank robbery movie. I recommend this movie. Great entertainment.
B0018BB21G|5.0|This is the album that put the Moodies on the map.  \\"Days of Future Passed\\" was not initially a big seller although it held the record for time on the charts for many years.  John Lodge's \\"Ride My See Saw\\" with its rocking beat and great chorus kicked off the album.  Other reviewers have noted the psychedlic nature of most of the songs.  For me, it's the singing.  Mike Pinder's \\"Om\\" (the lyrics of which are seriously dated now) is still maybe the best piece of choral singing the Moodies have ever done.  On the CD the song is expanded by 40 seconds or so to feature more of the great chorus at the end.<br /><br />Lyrically, the entire album is very dated, very much of its time.  If you don't know who Timothy Leary was, the words to \\"Legend of a Mind\\" don't make much sense.  It's the performances that carry the album now, and what performances they are.  Justin Hayward's singing on \\"The Actor\\" (which the group still performs today when Jus is pushing 70) is every bit as powerful as anything on \\"Days.\\"  Lodge's intricate harmonies on \\"House of Four Doors\\" (a tribute to 4 types of music) are a revelation.  Ray Thomas' sense of humor on \\"Dr. Livingston, I Presume\\" as well as \\"Legend\\" became a hallmark of the Moodies albums.<br /><br />You want great music?  You cannot do better than this.  I agree with the reviewer who siad ths kicked off an era of greatnes much as \\"All Summer Long\\" did for The Beach Boys.  Get this, both albums from 1969 and \\"Question of Blanes\\" from 1970, and you have a collection of some of the best music ever recorded.
B008602KQI|5.0|Enjoyed this movie. Action packed, suspenseful and interesting story line. Main character a great role model for youngbwomen - she is strong, confident and yet compassionate. I recommend for all ages.
B00005A8H5|2.0|I think this is one of the few SACD albums that sound is the same than the CD version. I had great expectations from this SACD since its a classic from the 80´s. That´s why I was willing o pay 50 usd extra for the &#34;quality&#34;. But to my surprise I hear almost no difference in sound quality. If you find it 20 usd or below buy it,  otherwise don´t bother!!!. I own Mcintosh gear and Martin Logan speakers. I mean Its not MBL or Goldmund, but I believe they are transparent enough to hear differences, and they are tiny tiny ones.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I think this app is extremely wonderful! I happen to use this everyday and it is the best thing since angry birds!!!!!
B0054SMIH6|5.0|Very interesting turn of events. Some action with characters that you've developed relations with. Twist after twist with a legal side.
B007THA4FI|5.0|JK Rowling's penchant for black & white good versus evil youthful characters in the Harry Potter series is abandoned for an un-nuanced look at small town life in semi-rural England. The death of the apparently only nice person in town (on the first page) precipitates the dash to unethical behavior by everyone else. By the end most characters reveal some mitigating  traits but it remains a glum place. Rowling thinks she is redeeming herself by presenting an adult novel. Its unlikely to lead to six sequels, but she does pull the reader into these sleazy lives.
B009WUAK2M|4.0|Sorry I never watched it.<br />I don't have what it takes to watch it.<br />I would like to purchase it when it comes out.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved the people and situations in this book.  and the price for my Kindel.  :-)  Imagining life in a silo kept me bouncing off walls for days.  Keep them coming!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I loved every detail that made the movie so forgettable to me. I can't wait to read the next book!
0553801473|5.0|Ooohhh....Arya!  Daenaris!  What is happening to you?  Where is the rest of the story?  Hurry!  Write the next installment.  Write the next installment.  Write it!  Hurry!  ;-)
B004Z2TUGE|3.0|The premise was good. The beginning of the movie was dark and hard to understand at first. However, I hate it when movies end on cliffhangers and you have to wait/hope for a sequel to see what happens.
B0043UB0EI|2.0|This was just too graphically bloody for me.  The personalities of the people did not even remotely make me care to see it.  That's the bottom line.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|good move
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Getting to see interviews of people who really lived through this experience was especially fun for this movie.  Normally I don't care to watch something when I know how it will turn out but this kept me biting my nails.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|grate move
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Once you start them, you cant put them down!<br /><br />Yes there is a lot of explicit sex, but the story is so intriguing as well, I loved them!
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|what can i say i have all the dvds of the thing, and it just gets better!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! csnt what till the nex one
B00AO686MY|3.0|Not much love and attention given to this 25th anniversary set. The transfer of the film is good, the source suffers from the generational loss unavoidable before CGI compositing. So the image contrast and blacks vary greatly. The real disappointment here is the lack of any new features or extras. It's the same stuff from the old dvd, which was all good, but dated. And it doesn't look good all ressed up. With this and The Rocketeer Disney shows no love for our old favorites.
1595828753|5.0|Well I am a avatar fan so that's why I bought this if your a fan of avatar the last air bender you should buy this I recommend the promise part 1 the promise part 2 the promise part 3 and the search part 1 if you guys want to see what happened after the show was done then get this
B00846WWVM|3.0|Again nothing to do back flips over, it is ok.  The simplistic premise behind this app is fairly basic. I uninstalled it after a day of so, got boring
055338466X|1.0|This book contains one of the most hypocritical and ignorant statements of all time: \\"philosophy is dead\\". Read this to find out more:  [...]
B007HJ9NBE|5.0|I have to admit I thought Kevin Bacon was a better dancer but this current version told a better story with more depth, the lead female character (Ariel) was more likeable and made the story and movie so much better the second time.  Loved how they made it up to date but still used some of the old 80's tunes!
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|I LOVED THIS SOUNDTRACK!!!  It literally hit ALL of the right notes with me.  I listen to it all the time.
B000FA675C|5.0|Brown's writing style is excellent as always.  He grabs you on the first page and carries through to the last, leaving you wanting more, more, more.  And now that a fragment of ancient parchment has been discovered indicating Christ had a wife, the Code and Brown's excellent research take on even greater meaning.
B000KIE11Q|5.0|habia tenido antes un Swatch y fue perfecto. Llego la hora de renovarlo y encontre este hermoso reloj. Estoy completamnete satisfecho con él.
1878424319|2.0|This book has basically one message--keep your word.  The other three agreements are a subset of this most basic one. The author uses a little-known Mexican group to make his points.  It is hardly worth reading but can be inspirational if you want to see it that way. From the number of reviews, apparently a lot of people see it that way.
1607066017|5.0|Think Star Wars but for a much, much more mature audience. Nudity and swearing is frequent so this definitely isn't a series for young readers (I'll leave young for your own interpretation).<br /><br />Now this is where the \\"Star Wars\\" part comes in (sorta). This is a story that contains a variety of alien races who must pick a side in a war and fight; not because they wish for one side or the other to win but to ensure that they aren't destroyed as a repercussion for not helping. In the midsts of all this we follow the travels of our two main protagonists who are both different members of the two races that are waging war against one another. They develop a love affair that produces a child which, after being found out, are labeled as traitors and must travel the galaxy fleeing not only the war itself but their captors who want the child. As I haven't read any issues after the ones contained in this volume I can only suspect the child must be some kind of \\"chosen one\\".<br /><br />If space opera, war and aliens are your thing then book as plenty. If magic is your thing then this book has it. If adult content is your thing then this book HAS It. Adding on the content, I really enjoyed the writing in this series which has a very natural flow to it. It's not too flashy nor does it beat around the bush requiring you to read it over and over. It creates a sort of realism regarding the characters as if you could hold a conversation with them. It almost allows you to place yourself in the story and venture right along with them (aside from the whole intergalactic space thing). I found it refreshing. If you are put off because you think this is just some love story then rest assured that there is plenty of action and intrigue that has nothing to do with a love story. This isn't a mushy series. It's more Action with a love story than love story with action.<br /><br />Although the book is cheap when compared to other graphic novel volumes, you definitely get great quality printing in this book. A great size (the same as other TPB graphic novels), glossy paper with GREAT artwork. Honestly, Fiona Staples has done an amazing job with the different character drawings. Well worth the price and really offers no reason to not just buy the book and give it a try.<br /><br />I recommend this book if you are looking for something different, mature and to increase your exposure to different comic genres (like cape/hero comics). Again it's only $9.99 (retail) with refreshing dialogue and fine artwork so why not buy it?inting in this book. A great size (the same as other TPB graphic novels), glossy paper with GREAT artwork.

B005ZCXPP0|4.0|An old fashion theme warped in a new package that was easy to follow and enjoyable to watch. The idea of the Captain's heroics was almost plausible,... but not quite.
B00AJLHUA8|4.0|This movie is a good horror movie. Got it shrink wrapped, brand new, in perfect condition. I have since ordered quite a few more movies.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this watch for 4  reasons: 1) I have had nothing but good experiences with all my Seiko watches. 2) It was a great price. 3) It’s resemblance to the watches I wore when I was in the Army 4)It’s elegant simplicity.<br /><br />I have never owned an auto-winder and I admit, leaving it for 2 days and coming back to find it had slowed/missed a day/date change sort of put me off.  Now I know why those airline magazines that sell obscure stuff offers a watch-winding box for auto-winders that aren’t being worn for a few days.  Still, that is a small inconvenience for a basic, simple watch with all the things I like and none of the things I don’t.  Watches may be my only fashion statement but in that, I like them to be basic, functional and sharp.  My big, rugged, obnoxious watch is reserved for backpacking/diving/paddling when I need my digital compass, etc.  I like the old-Army look on this watch but with the added day/date.  I wish it was treated with tritium-3 so it would illuminate the hands, etc., like my old Army watch, but the occasions calling for low-light time-reading out here in the civilian world are few and far-between.<br /><br />I’m an old-school kind of guy and this is an old-school kind of watch.  For me, that’s exactly what I wanted and what I got!
B00C7JFIRC|5.0|I don't know why it hasn't gotten better reviews. I loved it. It was an a great example of good vs. evil and it gave a clear background to all of the witches and OZ. I also thought the scenery was beautiful and the colors (especially in the first part of the film) were breath taking. It had Disney written all over it. I LOVED IT! I wouldn't debate whether to get this on blu ray or a standard dvd. I can't wait til it comes out on Blu-Ray!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the walking dead. I have seen every episode since I was lucky enough to stumble apon the priemer on Haloween a few years ago. By the way, there is a video game by Telltale games called\\"the walking dead\\". I was amazed at how much I enjoyed it. It is a game that focuses on story and not that much on combat and simply killing things. Robert Kirkman helped write the story and it is very very good.<br /><br />There is a second game called \\"walking dead survival instinct\\" I do NOT reccomend that one though.
B00BKEMX28|5.0|I stumbled across How to Destroy Angels by accident, and I am glad that I did. I am a huge fan of Reznor's past work, and you can really hear his influence across the majority of the album. Mariqueen is a great vocalist and the production and composition on this album is top notch. By far my favorite new artist (new to me at least).
B005LAIIA8|1.0|The commercials looked cute but I didn't like the movie at all. To each their own - I have read many more liked it than did not. Movie slip cover came with a tear. A bit annoying if you buy the most expensive set and try to keep your movie set in perfect condition.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun game. Cant put it down because its so addicting! I hope anyone else who buys subway surfers enjoys it also.
B009KY5OGC|2.0|This book was too long. I couldn't be bothered to finish it. Other people have told me it is good.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This is one of the best games in the app store! You can literally type in almost anything and it appears on the screen. You cannot put trademarked items in this sadly. :(  It does not do any bad, rude, or sexual items which is good. I recommend this to those looking for a perfect app. :)
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this has been fantastic for my grandkids ages 6 to 9, it's so much fun to see them problem solve!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is probably the second best app in the world. (The first being Survival craft.) You get to play with your friends and family which is awesome. This is the most social app I've ever seen. GO MINECRAFT!!!!! :)
B002PMPTIO|4.0|This movie was good but in the writing and acting there is much to be desired with much to be lacking in the old TV series was still better as the sets were simple but the screen play had to make up for this lacking.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|Not so good if a pro. A good book needs its time line to be accurate, a good plot outline, and a good editor. A good series needs this too but in larger form. You captured my interest but the spellings and stretching out what can be believed gets to be extreme.<br /><br />I enjoy editing my mother's books but do not claim to be a pro. Unfortunately there appears to false claims of being one in the reviews. We do historical research as a background of places to make unbelievable more believable. It took us years to complete our seven novel series and we still find mistakes or want to change things.<br /><br />I might not be saying this well, am new to my kindle fire and need a poking stick to type better on here. Here goes, you have great potential to be a good author but you need to do your homework.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I'm a sucker...such a sweet love story!  But, I'm so glad I read the book first because I was not impressed with the movie at all!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It was interesting to see the changes made over the years, change in sets, etc. Plus I like seeing the development of characters. Its great to be able to watch the older seasons that you've missed!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Nice themes. It even has swiping! I can't go back to the stock keyboard after using this one! Give it a try.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Absolutely one of the best beginnings to an epic fantasy series ever.  Read it now and you will be one of the lucky ones who will someday get to say you were there from the beginning.
B008YP272M|4.0|CHris Hitchens had the most beautiful style of his generation, even when dealing with all the detailed tragic physical of cancer.  Read this book and learn something about the glories and failures of modern medicine.  I think that it was the consistent kindness that shocked him the most...

B006R4H5FG|3.0|Anyone who has presented a number of times can still find some nice points in this book, but I would say it is best suited for people with little to no experience.  You might find some guidance in this book, and certainly there are things even experienced presenters should take as reminders from time to time.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|A delightful comedy with great performances and characters by all. A child of the sixties, I was pulled right in to settings, including my smoking scout leaders. Edward Norton's performance and innocent devotion to scouting was great and delightfully low key as all the others were. It had to be the work of friends to bring so many great actors and actresses togeather in such an small human portrait of our national foolishness and goodness at heart. A quirky, low key and deadpan poke at us as we were and remain. The sets and settings were a colorful, poliester and rock bound blend of beauty. Highly recomended to our friends and no one disappointed yet. But we and our friend are a little off the wall ourselves.

030758836X|2.0|It started out very well.  The author really knows men to be able to write such realistic feelings/expectations.  A man wouldn't really get what's wrong with himself though.  Anyway, it was going well, and I was enjoying the story.  I wondered what happened to her, and all that.  Then, her part.  Now we have the \\"real\\" story, but we have to go over the whole thing again from her \\"real\\" point of view, not the fake diary she left.  Skipped through the rest to see how it ended.  What a lame ending!  What a crazy couple. They deserve each other, and will end up murdering each other (Hey, it happened to Bilbo's parents!) No great loss.  I don't understand why this novel has a long waiting list.  It seems a book becomes an \\"in\\" thing to read, share, and discuss, that it takes on an Emperor's New Clothes bit of feel to it.  No one will say, \\"Gee, I don't get it.  It wasn't THAT great a book!\\"
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this series and have all three season now. The story lines are great and the characters are outstanding!
B007TVANDM|5.0|My grandchildren loved the book and the music.  We have triplets that are almost 2and their brotheer is 9 mos older.  They start dancing as soon as they hear the music start.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|the game is easy to follow. prices are high. I enjoy playing. great game. I would recommand the game to others. wish they would lower the prices.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. It is a good time killer. I just wish the energy  bar would refill faster.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I think the game is awesome! ;-)  some of the sharks look real! And there's 5 sharks!  The 5th shark is the GREAT WHITE SHARK the biggest shark!
B002N57KG2|5.0|We bought this movie for my brother who is bedfast and this is one of his favorite movies.  We recently had to replace his VHS player with a DVD/Bluray player so are in the process of replacing his tapes with DVD's. This was a perfect purchase for him.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|A page turner yet very insightful book.  I felt like I was part of the book instead of &#34;just a reader&#34; while I was trying to find out the meaning of &#34;alchemist&#34;.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Love this movie. Saw it in theaters and bought it as soon as it came out. Really funny, witty, and great songs to sing along too.
B005HSL626|5.0|I like it for it is challenging.  You have to really think where you are hitting the fruit so you don't hit a bomb!!
B009G78EE2|5.0|Amazing Album, I love Macklemore and Ryan Lewis. Definitely worth purchasing, they deserve all the support they get. Well rounded Album that has a song for everyone
B00006ZXSK|5.0|This is a classic Drew Barrymore movie...lots of neat old scientists and love...all mixed together. Thanks for the offer. Bravo.
B00519YOY8|5.0|Good movie that is a classic. I love Tom Hanks he is a great actor and it is no different in this movie. Makes you think which I like.
B004X4QW42|3.0|The martial arts action was okay, but it's so obvious that wires were used, making much of it so fake. I much prefer action that could actually be done by a martial arts master. Masters can do some amazing things; there is no need for wires or fake action.
B00AO686MY|1.0|My husband and I bought the film this week and were very excited that one of our favorite movies as kids was finally getting the Blu Ray treatment.  It's a great film and not to be missed, especially for Disney and animation fans in general.<br /><br />Though the reason I write this review is not because the movie is disappointing.  Far from it, it's a wonderful film.  The reason why I am giving a one star review is for a 25th Anniversary edition Blu Ray. It's far from perfect and in fact, it's a very bad and disappointing transfer to high definition.<br /><br />Upon putting the Blu Ray into our PS3, first issue is how much \\"snow\\" and fuzziness was in the opening animation.  It was hard to watch with the amount of noise.  Nothing was clean and watching it long enough eventually hurt our eyes.  Usually playing on a blu ray player and watching on a high definition TV could fix or clean it up, but no such luck.  When my husband jump forward to live action sequence, it was not much different.  The noise made scenes darker and nighttime scenes harder to watch than the animation sequences.<br /><br />My main beef with the Blu ray is if Disney/Touchstone passed it off as a 25th anniversary edition, it should have gotten the 25th anniversary treatment.  It is second rate at best and looks like it wasn't worked on enough, if not at all.  What is sad is that I had purchased the Vista Series DVD in 2003, and the transfer on that DVD from 10 years ago looks better than this Blu Ray....  Another review I read online from another site, a \\"professional\\" reviewer claims that the reason why the Blu Ray transfer was bad was because the movie was filmed wrong from the beginning.  I find that hard to believe, or the reviewer didn't know what he was talking about.  If other companies or Disney themselves can take the time to restore films like The Wizard of OZ or Cinderella and make them look like they were filmed yesterday; than it should not be that hard to restore this film, no matter how \\"poorly\\" it was originally filmed.<br /><br />Sad to say, my husband and I returned the Blu Ray.  It was a huge letdown, or maybe we're now spoiled.  Either way, Disney did not do this film justice and it is really sad, because it's a great film.r how \\"poorly\\" it was originally filmed.<br /><br />Sad to say, my husband and I returned the Blu Ray.

B00B1ME3DQ|5.0|Another great album from Clutch. D.C. Sound Attack, Gone Cold, Crucial Velocity, Unto the Breach, lots of good songs on this one.<br />Just saw them live sold out in Seattle March 2013. Sound as good live as on disc. Clutch is a great pro quality band and their groove is infectious
B001BANK32|5.0|My first Stephen King book...won't be my last!<br />Everyone should read this book.  Intense but not gory...well written and unpredictable!
B005LAIIHG|5.0|wow awesome...bad kitty...but good kitty...i don't think i could of done all Pi had to do...great great show..at the end of my seat the whole time
B008MIMWOO|5.0|I enjoy these Austin Powers movies.  This was a nice way to get all three in a nice package.  I have watched two of the three and they are great Blue Ray disks.
B008602KQI|4.0|I read the book and thought that the movie was pretty faithful to the source content. Definitely good enough for a movie night.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Who DOESN'T WANT TO play a game like this!? Okay, I'll admit the aim is macabre as can be.  It's interesting as well. It's a stragegy game.  I almost flash back to the original 80s Classic, WarGames.  He thought playing ThermoNuclear War would be fun.  He thought it was a game.  A computer similuation if you will.  And as I evovle my most evil bacteria to my trying out my viruses, I smile than have that paranoid thought that what if people of ill repute are amassing information from us, our strategics and put to them use in nefarious black labs! And then I wake up holding my kindle fire realizing I really should have stragetized that disease better.  I'm smarter than that.  Because you are supposed to take real life scenarios in to account you have to create your disease, evovle and choose it's point of origin.  You can be a thinking disease.  Out-stragetizing a computer is hard on the best of days.  And it is a good distraction and sometimes stress reliever.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Although I wouldn't want to own it I would watch the film again.  It flowed well and I enjoyed the multi-talented cast as well as the costuming.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I didn't find out about this series until the 3rd season so I had to catch up.  This is one of the best shows ever!!!!!  But you have to start at the very beginning of Season 1 to learn all the characters.
034580404X|5.0|Very well written & great story line...just a little kinky!  Must read all three! Now my friends are reading the books too.
B000FA675C|1.0|Just dislike all the way. Nothing more to say. Fake and unreal. Would not tell others about it. Should not be on a shelf.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Wonderful, captivating, superb series!  Well acted and performed.  Makes you anxious for more.  Can't wait to see the  next episodes.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|This was nice with the options i had to choice from. Was a lot of options.  I would tell others about this.
B008QE9VJI|3.0|I'm old enough to have watched Dark Shadows originally when it ran as a 30 minute daily soap, so I was well informed on the original Dark Shadows lore ... Barnabus, Quentin, Victoria, et al. From previews, I expected that this was going to deviate from the serious nature of the original material into a campy story with plenty of Johnny Depp's patented offbeat character.<br /><br />I think that the creators of this film never made up their mind what kind of movie this should be though. In some scenes, Depp played an amusing fish out of water, then in the next scene he's committing cold-blooded murder. I like Depp, but I think he might have been the wrong choice for this role. It gave the film too much temptation to bring out elements of Jack Sparrow, and this movie didn't need that.<br /><br />Another problem I had with the film is that after Barnabus appears in the 70s and \\"reunites\\" with Victoria, she suddenly disappears for an extended stretch of the film. By the time they come back to the romance, there is literally no foundation built for it.<br /><br />Despite flaws, the film does have a lot of good moments. Special effects are outstanding and often spooky, as you would hope they would be. The funny moments are indeed funny ... there should have just been either more of them or none at all. The climax of the film is unusual and disturbing, even if it doesn't really make much sense or leave you with a real feeling of resolution.<br /><br />Obviously, huge fans of Depp are going to purchase this film. For anyone else, I recommend catching it on cable or a modestly priced rental. While I thought the film was worth a look, it isn't one I'll care to watch a second time.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Very good movie I was very impressed if only everything was this good I would be much happier with the prime membership
B004U8VX2M|5.0|I used to listen at it on the radio with my mom as a little girl, but I was way too young to appreciate it. I had to watch the series back to back. I couldn't get enough.
B0019M068O|5.0|Great music hits by a great group. You can't ask for more! Re-live your life through music and bring back great memories!
B0045DO85Q|5.0|It's nice to allow the music to take you back to the movie and imagine the scenes. Simon and Garfunkel are brilliant.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|This is a wonderful movie based on a true story of a man who is &#34;imprisoned&#34; by his iron lung, yet yearns to experience life. It is comedy, drama, and tragedy rolled up in one movie. Excellent performances by all, especially William H. Macy and Helen Hunt. This is Helen Hunt's finest role yet and she shines; Ms. Hunt does not hold back and she puts it all out there for everyone to see - quite emotional and pleasing to watch.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Hard to win.  hard to keep interested. not worth my time if i keep losing  Prefer to play other solitaires that maybe i can win.  guess i am poor loser..
B008D28HYS|5.0|I LOVE this game but completed it months ago... PLEASE add some more puzzles!!! I'm going through some serious withdrawal :)
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My husband and all of the rest of the family really enjoyed the movie.  It was so cute and loved how it was saying to the kids that it is okay to be different.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Bought this movie to complete my collection. Just like the rest of the twilight movies it doesn't disappoint. I love the extra disk too with the extras its fun to see how things were made.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Such a great game to pass time and great for people who like temple run! I recemend getting it. The only complaint I have is there are so many ads! If you get rid of that its a perfect free game!
B00ATDOVNK|3.0|I was enjoying this game immensely, but then when I decided to buy it, I found out it would cost me $4.99.  Unfortunately, I do not have that kind of money to spend on a game. I really like most of the G5 games I have played, but if there is one that costs more than $2.00, I won't buy it.  Sorry guys.  You're a little too expensive for my small budget.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This narrative of the mission to capture or kill Osama Bin Laden was highly interesting.  If it is accurate, it demonstrates the heroism and dogged determination of the U.S. intelligence and anti-terrorist forces.  The resolve of the Obama administration to get the world's number one terrorist is also commendable.  Thank god that we have this capacity although the mentality of these warriors sometimes makes me fear for the psyche of our young people.  The book is clearly written and is a compelling read.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|just started this serious, but by reading the most recent one first, which made me want to read the whole serious in order.  This is a good book, great story and characters.  Can't wait to move on to book 2, but have to get to some others in between!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Fun for all ages just wish it would be less expensive to expand would be more fun that way gets a little boring trying to save up money also takes to many hours to prepare food I hope they fix some of these issues but other than that if u have the patience than this is the game for you
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Dragons are cute. It's a typical casual micro-transaction game. Well made and well designed. fun even with no $$ spent
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|What can I say.  This is definitely a different look from the other Temple Run games, but just as entertaining.  Nothing really to comment about.  Overall, great
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this helps to passing he timeaway. Like the way it gradually gets more difficult with the option to play with different suits
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I'll be darn....a love story.  Who woulda thunk it?  I have to admit, I was surprised with where this book went.  I bought it because it was on sale and it had been a long time since I read a Stephen King book.  I didn't research it much, but I saw it had time travel and impulse took over.<br /><br />It sat on my virtual book shelf for quite some time before I decided to give it a go.  I just didn't care about Kennedy and Oswald and felt I made a mistake buying a book about it.  Once I started reading I almost gave up multiple times, but kept going.  About halfway through I decided I was committed and stuck with it and I realized that my problem was that I was \\"wanting\\" the book to be something else.  I liked how it began and I was expecing more situations like what is represented at the end of the book.  I wasn't getting it and was getting frustrated with pages and pages of things that I felt were just fluff.  About the time that there was mutliple pages detailing how bad Jake was sick and was throwing up, IN GREAT DETAIL, I was done.<br /><br />However, once Jake/George makes it to Jodie and meets Sadie, the true story begins.  I found myself getting upset whenever the book detoured away from them and back to Oswald and Kennedy.  I wanted more Jake/George and Sadie!  I couldn't believe it, but I was sucked into their romance and that is when I became invested in the characters.  There were times where I actually felt nervous while reading the book.  It has been a long time since that has happened!<br /><br />At its heart, this book is a romance and time travel is just a story device.  At almost 900 pages, it is quite a long romance, but it was worth the read at the end.  I didn't get the exact happy ending that I wanted, but I was satisfied.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Love it,use it all the time,when travel and daily use. Easy to use and helpful in planning days or weeks ahead
B009RH9FR6|1.0|Can't be adjusted for viewing. Even at steepest angle unless it is placed beyond arms reach you are looking down on the edge of the unit NOT at the screen.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I got this for my friend's Christmas gift and she loves the song, &#34;A Thousand Years&#34;.  Now she can listen to it whenever she wants.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I bought this for my grandson who  just entered high school this past year.  I wonder if they even teach American History in public schools anymore.  I already have it in my collection and found it is an excellent movie and presentation.  Killer Angels is one of my all time favorite fictionalized history books (on which it is faithfully based); and I knew about the 20th Maine from a book of that title I read while in grade school ... but, that was back in the day when we were proud of America.  This is a much better movie than the later Gods And Generals which actually precedes this historical presentation in actual time frame and I would suggest seeing this one first to whet the appetite for history. Too bad the third movie in this anticipated trilogy was never made.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|Ok, now I'm not sure I should admit that I first saw this movie when my oldest daughter was barely a year old.  Several years later, both of my daughters saw it and loved it.  So of course we bought it and every time we have &#34;movie time&#34; I ALWAYS ask to watch this.  Now I'm usually outnumbered, but it's a darling story of a princess in New Orleans!  Tiana - you're a keeper!
B00B7IJDMA|5.0|I loved the music on this soundtrack!  The music takes you from deeply thoughtful to profoundly moved.  I highly recommend for those of you who love soundtracks.
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|This movie - the original - is quite possibly the funniest movies I've EVER seen.  I think it's a travesty to have remade this as it was so stupid.  This is brilliant!!!  Funniest movie by far!
B000EYK2GE|5.0|If you like the older music (rock or country, pre 90s') like I do this should do the trick for you.  This is available for viewing the show on You Tube also.
014241039X|5.0|Jack devoured the book and gave me a verbal book review. Then he asked his mom to take him to the library to look for more Dahl books.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|If it was possible to wear out a USB memory stick, I think their first album would have definitely would have done it. It has something for everyone. But the first 4 songs on the newest album definitely worth Cranking it up to 11. And to finish the album with &#34;Here's to Us&#34; was the icing on the cake. This album has something for everyone, between the &#34;in your face&#34; hard hitting lyrics and guitar and the kick back and relax softer tunes, you can't go wrong with Halestorm. Ya just can't.
B000FA675C|5.0|As always, Dan Brown's novels are highly addictive and very fun to read. Always on the edge of your seat!
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Twitter is great to find all sorts of random facts, news and thoughts. I put Twitter on my KF as a way to keep up on news posts. It works wonderfully! I like using it on the Fire versus my cellphone.

B00C1BU7V8|3.0|Lincoln was revered by so many people as a great movie. It was a great historical reference for how the end of slavery came to pass but it's very political. I am glad that it wasn't focused solely on the assassination. There is so much more to Lincoln's term. The acting is phenomenal for Daniel Day-Lewis and Sally Field. I was completely caught up in the portrayal of Mary Todd-Lincoln.
0307592731|1.0|I was an avid hiker in my day and found this book to be a bit self-centered. I understand that the book is about Cheryl but her woe as me attitude got old after the first chapter. I also understand that she went through a lot of changes in her life but a lot of her obstacles were self made. I did not really get the self journey aspect from the book, rather a girl who took a trail and sometimes stayed on it and sometimes didn't and who sometimes wanted to be alone and not alone at other times. I wish I got some kind of epiphany as to my own life from this book but it simply did not happen. I was bored and shaking my head thru most of the book but resigned myself to finish it. It will be donated to a local bookstore because I don't feel that it will be read again. It's a book people like because other people like it maybe. Too bad but at least some people liked it and got something out of it. I think Cheryl needs to stick to being Sugar.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I really like that this book included Hannah's point of how. I did not like the ending though. It left a lot unanswered considering it was the final book in the trilogy.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|Maybe there is just too much information but I found that it was difficult to use. Considering the amount of information on Facebook it might just be a difficult task to put it all on a hand held screen.
B000001GQD|5.0|I bought this because of another musical piece and this is a great work of art.  It leads you on to experience more of these artists.
B000FA675C|5.0|The book read like a James Bond movie.  I continued reading to see what would happen next in the story.  I found the book intriguing.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I love the show, I think it is written very well and the cast of characters is good. It is not an over-the-top drama.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing try for double coinings characters are sick!GREAT game!lots of fun BEST free game!cool graphics BEST part is you travel around the world!
0307352153|5.0|I am. Of completely done with the book yet but it is very interesting and having an introverted son, this has been helping me understand him better.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|For me, this was a bit too long and convoluted.  I like the stories and the visuals but it wasn't as exciting for me as past ones.
B009FZFONO|5.0|If you love zombie movies this is the show for you. Even if your not into the zombie craze, you will still enjoy it. The show is very well writin and the actors are great.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I liked this movie but it was a downward spiral character driven plot. His acting was great, just a dismal story.
B001H4R4LQ|5.0|Keeps you on the edge and guessing what will happen next and wanting him to best his enemies instead of struggling.
B000J103OI|5.0|I saw this movie twise in theaters and bought the DVD because of Meryl Streep's acting: &#34;That's all&#34;. The rest is so silly.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|Although I was a bit skeptical because of the high price, I am so glad I purchased this game as I haven't found its equal yet! Great storyline, beautiful graphics and thrilling gameplay make this the best and most fun game I have yet to play. Bravo!
B0009K8L5W|4.0|This is a good spanish album by Shakira. But to me, her best one in spanish is &#34;Dónde están los Ladrones?&#34;
B003V5CFV8|3.0|Kept me entertained, though I found some character annoyenses (mostly the singing parts as they were just a bit cheesy) and there was just a touch to much going on in the plot.  Not really a type of movie you want to think while watching, but it tries to make you do that in order to follow an always moving plot line.
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|This is a really great film! I was prepared to see something clich&eacute; & lame, as some \\"teen\\" movies can be, but I was pleasantly surprised with the result of this & watched this many times.<br /><br />The Storyline: This goes through the day-to-day life of a typical high school student & the issues they may potentially deal with, such as fitting in, rumors & how word travels fast.<br /><br />The Cast: Emma Stone is absolutely fantastic, she fits the role of Olive perfectly & I can't imagine anyone else playing this character. Stanley Tucci, Patricia Clarkson & Thomas Haden Church make this film even greater by having a rather unique relationship with Olive & it makes the film even more fun to watch; I especially loved Olive's relationship with her parents, it's hysterical!<br />The BluRay: It's great quality, no issues with watching the film. I never bothered to look at the special features, sorry!<br /><br />Overall: I highly recommend this film for anyone 13 & up, there's minimal profanity & scenes which aren't too uncomfortable to watch together, so let your kids watch it, they'll enjoy it & so will you!
B005K17RU0|2.0|I really loved this app before the latest update. They totally changed the app and now it takes forever to load and uses about 15mb of memory - the original used 6.7mb. Very disappointed in this app now. I'm looking for a new one.
B005JSM5YW|5.0|This movie was an unexpected surprise, I was prepared to watch something super cheesy & clich&eacute;d, but I was wrong. It deals with real family issues & is something that younger people can relate to (12+). All characters had great chemistry & each actor did a fabulous job.<br /><br />The BluRay: Great quality, no issues. There are no special features, but I wasn't looking for any, so it's all good.<br /><br />Overall:  I highly recommend this for everyone, it's not exactly a chick-flick, it's a good movie for most people & it has some good messages.
0553328255|5.0|I wanted to see how close the Sherlock Holmes movies and TV series are to the original books. This book gave me insight into the Holmes character and I now realize that nobody comes close to the original!
B0024FAG1W|5.0|With an excellent commentary track and behind the scenes documentaries, this blu-ray provides what this great movie deserves - the quality treatment.
B009VL28W2|5.0|I bought it because I'm a Metallica fan since the beginning. I went to see this tour in San Juan,PR and I was just waiting for them to release a blu ray to remember that awesome night. This blu ray concert is almost exactly the concert that a saw. I said almost because the fans here are not as excited as the concert that I went and some special effects does not appear here. With that said this blu ray is good but I was hoping something better about the visuals. The camera is moving a lot and you can't appreciate the concert much. The part of the lasers I think was not filmed well. Like I said, I went to this concert and the view was much better that what appears here. Is not the first time that I see this problem, in concerts from others musicians like U2 you see this jumping around and I hated it. I just want it to see the concert, not the fans, the chairs, the roof etc...I hope this does not become a trend.
B003ASLJRW|4.0|A fantastic movie that hasn't lost its impact.  The transfer is very clean and the sound is great, but I'd love to get a few extras, if they exist.  A commentary track would be ideal.
0821210920|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my son, a photography buff. This was a replacement for an earlier copy that I had purchased through Amazon that was not as described - advertised in New Condition but highlighted throughout first chapter. This copy at half of the cost of the first that I purchased, was in excellent condition and he loves it!
B001YV504U|5.0|I love the film and this blu-ray has all the features you could want to go with it.  Fantastic video and sound, engaging commentary and behind the scenes extras, both new and original.
B00B8PRDHE|4.0|I went to this concert in Brisbane this year and all I can say this band is nothing but talent.<br />Was one of the best concerts ever.<br />I gave this dvd 4 out of 5 stars because the audio is only 2 channel, it is a shame it is not 5.1<br />Hopefully a bluray with 5.1 will be released
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is a very addicting, fun game! I could play all day! Add that 5 stars to the list :)
B009178OQA|4.0|I liked learning about the family dynamics in this family and also about preparation of the sushi.  Very interesting and fun to watch.
B00340I4KG|1.0|wow nick cage really sucks at acting like a cool bad boy stud and the action sequences are just plain stupid.
B009K45Y62|4.0|The Bat Cowl that came with the movie was pretty cool and I honestly haven't opened the package. However, I did purchase the Dark Knight Trilogy and saw the Dark Knight Rises. The movie was very good but I did not think it was as good as the second installment with the Joker. It is definitely worth checking out though.
B006TF6WAM|2.0|I very seldom, if ever, do not persevere with a book, even if I battle to get into it at first, but this one I just could not carry on - it did not appeal to me at all and I found it very boring.
B000FA675C|5.0|Well written and a fun read. Downloaded to have something new to read on my Kindle and I was pleasantly surprised. A fun read!
0425263908|4.0|I have to start by saying that this book is VERY MUCH like 50 Shades.  While the woman (Eva) in the book is more experienced, the story line is almost identical. I enjoyed the book, but could not stop myself from comparing the two.<br /><br />I enjoyed some of the side characters a great deal.  Her roommate Cary is awesome.<br /><br />If you liked 50 Shades, you will like this.  I've read the second book and have pre-ordered the third.  I guess I am a glutton for punishment.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|&#34;Wool&#34; does a very nice job of creating it's own world, with it's own rules, and exploring the social consequences.  The very essence of good science fiction.  And it's well written, except...<br /><br />My only hesitancy about the book is that the last 20 pages or so just seem to pull out a too convenient way of creating a happy ending.<br /><br />That said, I liked the book and have bought the sequels, &#34;The Shift Omnibus&#34; and am waiting for some time to get started on them.
0425263916|4.0|OK - this book began to annoy the heck out of me.  The roller coaster relationship was getting on my last nerve... but then, the author turned things around and provided a very good ending.  While the story line is a stretch, I still fell for it.  I won't spoil anything for anyone - give the book a look to find out what you think.<br /><br />We are introduced to a few new characters, who again I enjoyed.  Eva's relationship with her father is wonderful. Actually, her interactions with both her parents are good.<br /><br />While I admit to my annoyance at the ups and downs of the main characters relationship - what I liked especially is the Eva becomes a bit stronger as the story unfolds.  She changes her physical appearance and begins to look for answers in order to deal with the situation.<br /><br />I pre-ordered book three and look forward to where the characters will end up.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is a good game, lot of gmes to play in the group of games.Fun for all age groups, lots of fun
B003YL4LYI|5.0|As with Books One through Four, I find I cannot put it down.  The only thing that concerns me is that with so little left to read, I can see there is no apparent resolution to &#34;The Game of Thrones&#34;.  If this is truly the case, I sincerely hope there is a Book Six!
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|I felt I was right next to Cheryl on her big adventure. She makes me want to hike the PCT
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The books are great and well worth reading but the final 50 pages let it down against the previous books standards.
B002GYI96U|4.0|The Wedding Girl was a good light read, entertaining, and a bit thought provoking on the issue of gay relationships. For it's genre it's better than average.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|What more can you say about this series?  I bought this for my husband for a birthday present and he was thrilled
B005JLN9Z8|5.0|Hilarious and fun to listen to, tons of energy and awesome on liners! Awesome album! Can't wait for the next album later this year
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I liked Hunger Games better than the Twilight series, but that's not saying much. Still, in fairness, I realize I'm probably not the target demo for this book. It was an entertaining series, and I liked the concept (once I got  over the issue of parents letting their kids face off against each other in death matches). However, as the series evolves, the author's need to find ever more creative ways the kill characters begins to border on silly.<br /><br />I don't know if I'd recommend this series. If you do purchase it be prepared to suspend any notions of logic, reality, and common sense.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|Greatest band no one has heard of! Very adult lyrics and awesome energy and one liners. Funny and fun to listen to
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love this show! Thanks for putting season 2 on Amazon video so we could get caught up before we start season 3!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I got interested in the books due to the HBO show Game of Thrones.  I could not put the books down.  I enjoyed everyone and meeting the new character's.  I can't wait for the next one....
0385344228|4.0|This book was ok to me until the very end, when it got very good.  I was not expecting the multiple twists that the author throws at you at the end.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|this book quickly got me hooked to the series. looking forward to more on this series. planning to get the dust series when available.
B00BOXZAJ8|4.0|Interesting premise.  Very cool special effects to make both worlds interactive with each other yet opposite of each other.  Love story could have been better developed.
B004D2A04M|5.0|Fits my light and holds it snuggly in place. When I have to run to a urgent call I don't have to hold my light anymore.
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|I enjoy the movie and wanted to own it.  I am pleased with my purchase and would order again from amazon.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Can't wait for season 4!  I had no idea amazon had an app to play movies with a phenomenal selection of shows and movies!  I will be back for sure.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|I am pleased with the movie and enjoy the fact that I can watch it again if I desire to do that.
B008G12ERC|5.0|Many Musers have complained about the new sound of MUSE in this album but I liked it. It might take a while to get used to the songs but once you have you will realise how awsome The 2nd law is.My favorite is panic stastion which I can image listening to it in a future MUSE consert about a future album. It might not be the usual sound but it's still really good and worth it.
B005CA4SQK|5.0|Bought this for my husband, one of his favorite shows. He watched immediately. Thank you for a great quality product, delivered fast.
B008966SLM|5.0|Great album, fantastic band! Saw them playing 'Nothin But Love' on Jay Leno and immediately ordered album which is great!
B002LC2DQ4|5.0|I only used it once and i have not noticed any problems with the device. So I am pleased with it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I recommended this book to my husband and he is still talking about it.  I am sure my book club members have much more to say about it than I can find words for, but trust me, you'll love it.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|it was an ok movie.it was hard to connect to it.the acting was great by Jennifer Lawrence,I would not watch it again.
B0094K1MH2|3.0|The headline says it all.  Let your kids watch it alone! *laugh*  I probably shouldn't be reviewing it since I didn't watch the whole thing.  I just couldn't take any more.
B007KOYEOC|1.0|This is a book made up of cut and paste and the literary value is absolutley nil. The whole series was one great big publicity trick, never waste time on anything so badly written
B005C8ENI0|4.0|As a home rental it gets four stars.  The story line is not at all a new concept and the first half of the movie drags just a bit.  However, I thought it was well acted and it managed to be entertaining even though it was never surprising.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Book was in better condition than stated. It arrived a few days sooner then they said it would. Defiantly order from them again!
B00190OHD6|5.0|I had watched this movie through Netflix and loved it so much that I had to buy it for my personal collection!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've really had a hard time sleeping since college. I tried this app to help me go to sleep and it works like a charm. I love how you can customize the various sounds to create a unique and fresh sound. there are a lot of sound options, although sometimes the sounds like &quot;urban rain&quot; and &quot;heavy rain&quot; aren't terribly different. There is also a timer function that will turn off the sound and program after a while. All in all a good app to sleep to
B00006JIA4|5.0|love it! everything you could want is on there.. wish my kid see the greatness in the music<br />would recommend to a friend
B001QB5S3G|5.0|I have lived near and have visited Iguazu Falls a number of times. The scenery in the film is great!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this for a gift and my grown daughter was crazy happey to have it. She is very happy with it and it came in a nice compact pkg.
B0071XO8RA|3.0|Great idea, totally intriguing but found myself skipping chunks towards the end. A bit predictable - good guys/bad guys, one woman saves the world.
B001PSGF3C|4.0|I have actually seen this a couple of times and I always like it!!  I love Halle Berry, she is a good choice for this movie.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|We already knew we loved this show but I'm posting the review to let people know it worked fine on our USA blue ray player too.
B00B19DMUE|3.0|The movie is ok. Not exactly what you would expect from a &#34;Possession&#34; movie. Acting is just ok. Would recommend if there is nothing else to watch!!
B008645YH6|4.0|I adore Marina & the Diamonds. I love the euro/techno/pop style of their (her) music. This album definitely showcases Marina's vocal talents while demonstrating how she (like most of us) shouldn't be taken too seriously and should learn to laugh at ourselves. Most of the songs are upbeat, which is a plus in my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, I would definitely recommend this cd.
B005DJREJS|5.0|While the concept itself isn't new - reminiscent of shows from the 80's and 90's - I love this show's take on these teens' high school experiences (Fail-Mary's), which surprisingly hasn't change since I was in high school.  What has changed, for these teens is, the protagonist, the dress, the slanguage, and some of the moral/social issues.<br /><br />What hasn't changed are the social pressures, angst of being a teen/identity, clicks,  bullying and all the firsts: driver's license/car, boyfriend/kiss, and the loss of one's virginity.<br /><br />No matter what the subject this wonderful, introductory cast,  delivers with great humility and humor.  I've loved every minute of this show starting with the first season and cannot wait for the 3rd season, which premieres next week.<br /><br />This show may not be for everyone, due to content and the very in- your- face stereotypes, etc., but I think it a very genius way discuss and deal with issues that affect not only today's teens but many people in today's society.  I'm Glad to see that MTV has put something on the air worth watching.
