McDougall weaves a thrilling tale of ultra running in remote conditions, I couldn't put this book down. After just a couple of 3 mile runs, my husband and I put on our Minimus shoes, Born To Run style, and took off for an 11 miler... and it was fun! This book is a great read for any runner.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love my Verso Artist Series Case, it fits my Kindle Fire perfectly. My case is snug on my Fire and its portable, it fits well in my purse. I took a gold gel pen and shaded all the countries on the cover, I have had so many complements, a friend of mine has already put in an order for one for herself. I give it 10 on a scale of 1 to 5, if you want a beautiful case that will last, I suggest an investment in the Verso.

0393338827|5.0|THE BIG SHORT by Michael Lewis is a romp through the labyrinth world of shadowy players trying to make money from the subprime mortgage crisis.<br /><br />Lewis's narrative includes key players on both sides of the subprime mess, those who own the debt and those who are hoping to \\"short\\" it, or profit from its decline in value. From Goldman Sachs and the big wirehouse firms (Bear Stearns, Merrill, Lehman, Morgan Stanley) to a lonely solo money manager to a group of young investors, he traces the murky trail of a handful of people who would profit handsomely from the largest failures in modern finance. There weren't many. Nearly all of the \\"experts\\" were blind (ignorantly or willfully) to the debacle about to engulf the country.<br /><br />It is astonishing that so many highly-paid, highly-educated financial experts missed the unmistakeable.  Like lemmings off the proverbial cliff, all the major players fell into disaster. Some would survive, though wounded (Morgan, DeutscheBank, Merrill) but others would fail altogether (Countrywide,  Bear Stearns, Lehman).<br /><br />No one tweaks the nose of Wall Street better than Michael Lewis. His savvy and smarts are evident, yet so are his wit and irreverence for the hallowed halls of Wall Street. This truly was a David and Goliath story - and it is still playing out as millions of bad home loans and foreclosed properties are deleveraged throughout  the financial system.<br /><br />For a highly-readable, delicious tale about the mighty and powerful  as well as a certain courage and pluck by smaller guys willing to take on the system...and win....I highly recommend this book.
B004LWZW4C|5.0|I am so happy fox the studio reboot the franchise. It needed a reboot. The storyline did not flow. The new one it was on pint.
B005QJZ5FA|2.0|Caught Lana Del Rey on Saturday Night Live a few weeks back. Hadn't heard of her before, but happened to notice a photo of her in a celeb magazine a few days earlier, remembered the name and looked forward to her SNL appearance. I couldn't believe how horrible it was - bland music and totally off key signing. Unfortunately, this album isn't much better - most of the songs are truly awful. Though she is able to stay on key a lot better than her live appearance, her voice is just plain boring (more talking than singing), the lyrics are trite and the music totally unoriginal. That being said, I kind of liked the song \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\".

B0063IH60K|5.0|Flashback! My sister has these boring 4 hour gymnastics meets, and usually I have nothing to do. When I got my Kindle fire, I downloaded this and now have a brain teasing boredom buster. You just have to keep an open eye for certain cards. Other than reading downloaded books and playing Hot Donut, it's one of my favorite things to do on my Kindle fire!
B002VECM4K|5.0|This is probably the ONLY movie I've ever seen that shows how reality is for many women and girls in this day and age still.  It also shows women as they truly are (without makeup--or shaven underarms in one instance)--it took me a moment to realize the counselor was Mariah Carrey--and even then I had to google it..Kudos to Carrey for being brave enuf to shed the constrictive mask required for her normal roles in Hollywood :)  Does an excellent job at showing how when abuse is allowed to run rampant the repurcussions on all those involved follow.  Particularly saddening is the fact that HIV is involved.  Some have criticized this story for not being a true story (wth)--the fact is that this is a true story  for so many ppl in the real world, in different ways.  Problems of literacy and education, abuse, woman and minority issues, poverty (welfare--why was the mom allowed to stay on welfare, ok, maybe mental health issues lol), this film has it all.  Rare is the excellent movie (for me at least) that doesnt have a good soundtrack to fall back on in creating emotion,depth, etc, but this is one that did it. (especially the scene where the mom reveals the truth near the end).  Superb.  I am already looking forward to watching it again.

B005ZUR724|5.0|I love this game. I've been looking for a good rpg to pass my time on a day to day basis, not play the same thingg over and over if you know what I mean. it is also very cheap for monthly subscriptions, and it gives you the first three free so you can figure. out if you like it or not. if you like rpg games, then you will love it. do not be fooled by the ratings, they are because of an update a couple months ago which from what I see has been fixed.

B005CAAU76|5.0|From reading other reviews, it seems the perception by some is that this album was a bit of a letdown upon its initial release in 1978, but I certainly never saw it that way.  I'll get some disagreement on this I'm sure, but to me this is one of Queen's top 2 or 3 albums ever and the last truly great Queen album to feature all the elements of the classic Queen sound.  For those not familiar with it, I'll cover the main album first.  If you're more interested in just the remastering effort and/or bonus material, skip towards the end of the review where that's covered separately.<br /><br />As for the album itself, first, the hit single songs most listeners will already know:  Fat Bottomed Girls & Bicycle Race.  These are not personal favorites of mine and actually two of the weaker tracks on the album to me.  They're not at all bad, but I think the reason some may feel this album was something of a letdown is that they are likely judging the album on the strength of the \\"hits\\" it had (or didn't have).  If so, I would say they are missing out on some of Queen's best work because while these are probably not 2 of Queen's stronger singles, the deeper cuts on this album are all superb.<br /><br />What constitutes Queen's \\"best work\\" is of course up to the individual, but to me, it's diversity of material with consistent quality and in that regard `Jazz' delivers like no other Queen album except for perhaps \\"A Night at the Opera\\". Whereas most opening tracks on previous Queen albums were straight rockers like Brighton Rock, Tie Your Mother Down, We Will Rock You, etc.,  \\"Jazz\\" opens with the middle-Eastern flair of \\"Mustapha\\", signaling that Queen are going to take a few chances on this one....  I have to admit it threw me at first but over time, I've grown to really love this unique track.  Freddie really shines and it does rock out plenty as it progresses.  Two of the next three songs are the singles - `Fat Bottomed Girls' & `Bicycle Race' - again, not my favorites, butnot bad songs at all.  In between is a great ballad by Freddie Mercury (\\"Jealousy\\") that's always been a favorite of mine.  A slightly odd order to start the album, but it flows, is still plenty good and most importantly, only gets better.<br /><br />Next up is one of the few (only?) really rocking tunes John Deacon wrote for Queen, \\"If You Can't Beat Them\\".  Excellent lyrics, the trademark sound from Brian May and Queen's one-of-a-kind backup vocals to fill it out.  This fades out and brings us to \\"Let Me Entertain You\\", a perfect statement rocker from Freddie Mercury, though strong as the guitar riff for this song is, you might think Brian May had written it.  And the lyrics sum up Mercury's approach to his role in Queen most fittingly:<br /><br />I've come here to sell you my body<br />I can show you some good merchandise<br />I'll pull you and I'll pill you<br />I'll Cruella-Daville you<br />To thrill you I'll use any device<br /><br />A superb ending to Side 1, though again, slightly odd placement since this was used as an opening tone-setter for Queen's live show for the next several years, yet closes Side 1 here.<br /><br />Side 2 is really where this album shines though: 7 songs, all solid, and surprisingly, only 1 composed by Freddie Mercury (although to me, Brian May's \\"Dreamer's Ball\\" always seemed like more of a Freddie song, which helps keep the side more balanced).  Side 2 opens right where side 1 left off, with a great rocking tune, this one by Brian May (\\"Dead on Time\\").  Excellent guitar work and spot-on lyrics about the frantic pace of life that Queen was dealing with more and more by 1978 after years of platinum albums and sold-out world tours.  And the lyrics match the fast-pace nature of the song.  Next up is the wonderful John Deacon ballad, \\"In Only Seven Days\\" about a week-long romance while on vacation which is perfectly understated musically and superbly sung by Freddie Mercury.<br /><br />Next up is the previously mentioned \\"Dreamer's Ball\\", a playful little number Queen always had fun with on stage and that harkens back to songs like \\"Seaside Rendezvous\\" and \\"Who Needs You\\" from previous albums.  So.... not to be taken too seriously, but still a wonderful track with some excellent guitar work from Brian May in a slightly different setting.  This is followed by the first of two songs by drummer Roger Taylor, the funky-disco beat of \\"Fun It\\" which is augmented by Brian May's guitar to still give it that signature Queen sound.  Lead vocals are shared by Taylor and Mercury on this precursor to \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\", though this is a little more rocking than \\"Dust\\" as it doesn't stray quite as far into the funk/disco genre.<br /><br />The side winds down with another track from Brian May, this one a pensive ballad about separation and having to leave the ones you love (\\"Leaving Home Ain't Easy\\").  For this one, Brian takes lead vocals himself and while his voice has always seemed very limited to me, it's very effective with the right material and shines on this track.  This song provides yet another touch to give Queen the diversity that made them shine so brightly on this album.<br /><br />Next up is another single from the album, Freddie's lone contribution to side 2, \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\".  It did not fare particularly well in the U.S. but did reach the top 10 in the UK.  It's perhaps a bit over the top for U.S. audiences but undeniably catchy and I remember latching onto this song very early after I first purchased this album back in 1978.  It was also used to great effect in the motion picture \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" during a bar-fight scene.<br /><br />Closing the side and the album is the aptly titled \\"More of That Jazz,\\" a down-tempo funky little rocker from Roger Taylor.  The lyrics center on Taylor's bitter comments about current society and the way rock and roll is disrespected.  Taylor plays most of the instruments himself and sings all vocals.  A superb track unlike anything else on the album, but then that could be said for most of the tracks on this excellent Queen release.  The outro contains a summation of the album by way of short clips from many songs on the album including \\"Dead on Time\\", \\"Bicycle Race\\", \\"Mustapha\\", \\"If You Can't Beat Them\\", \\"Fun It\\", and \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\", making it the perfect album closer.<br /><br />All told, I love every single track on this album except (ironically) the two singles they aimed at mass audiences, \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" and \\"Bicycle Race\\".  And those are far from bad songs, but not as strong to me as the rest of the album.  Not bad at all though which makes the complete \\"Jazz\\" package one of Queen's very best to this reviewer.  After \\"Jazz\\", Queen would intentionally water down the diversity and never be quite this adventurous again in an effort to reach new fans, which they would successfully do on their next release, 1980's \\"The Game\\".  And that's a fine album too, but compared to \\"Jazz\\" is a pretty \\"safe\\" album and let's face it:  what made Queen so great in the 70's is that they were anything BUT \\"safe\\".  So I consider \\"Jazz\\" to be the last truly classic Queen album that featured them at their best and demonstrating all their strengths in full.  FIVE STARS for the Jazz album.<br /><br />REMASTERING and BONUS TRACKS:<br /><br />And now a few words on the REMASTERING effort and the BONUS TRACKS:  The first Queen 2011 remasters I bought were the first five albums, which I wanted mainly for the bonus material.  I did evaluate the remastering job both with my naked ears and then by taking a couple of tracks from Sheer Heart Attack and Queen I and looking at the wav files on my computer, comparing the same songs from my 1991 remasters to those on the 2011 remasters.  On the ear test, I noticed no real discernable difference in the volume or quality.  It sounded good, but then so did my 1991 remasters....  In looking at the wav files, the 1991 files appeared identical to those of the 2011 tracks.  So the goodnews is that these remasters weren't just volume-adjusted to get these cranked way up loud (which is all too common and just results in clipping and reduced sound quality/clarity).  The bad news is that these new re-masters also don't really sound any better than the previous 1991 remasters either.<br /><br />So to me it appears the only reason to get the remasters would be the bonus material, which is also a mixed bag.  First, they have for some reason decided to put the bonus material on a second disc when it would easily fit on the main disc.  I guess having it on the 2nd disc (they feel) adds to the \\"specialness\\" of it, but it also adds to the COST, so I don't get it.  The other mini-complaint I have is that there are live tracks on some albums (including this one) that are already out there on readily available live albums such as \\"Queen Rock Montreal\\" or \\"On Fire At The Bowl\\" (the live version of \\"Let Me Entertain You\\" here is one such track and comes from the \\"Montreal\\" live CD).  What's the point there?  Particularly since it's not a very good version:  it's an up-tempo number already and Queen play it so fast here that they seem in race to get to the finish.  The version on 1979's \\"Live Killers\\" is much better...<br /><br />Then we have versions of some songs that are the same as what's on the main album, but with the vocals removed (\\"Bicycle Race\\").  Again, I ask:  what's the point of that?  I guess karaoke fans might like that but to me it's a waste of space.  The \\"Fat Bottomed Girls\\" single version is very similar to the album version but I guess is ok. Hardly a revelation though. That leaves 2 bonus tracks of interest:  the version of \\"Don't' Stop Me Now\\" with the \\"long lost guitars\\" features Brian May noodling around during the piano intro and a slightly different guitar solo, and it's somewhat interesting to hear what Queen considered doing differently with this song, but it's not drastically different nor is it an improvement and I can't see anyonepreferring this version to the version that ended up on the album, so again, not a particularly wortwhile bonus track to me.<br /><br />Thankfully the very last bonus track really delivers:  the early acoustic take of \\"Dreamer's Ball\\" is in fact a studio run through never intended for release, just the skeleton of the song delivered very informally by the band (minus John Deacon) with Roger on brushes, Brian on acoustic and of course Freddie delivering the vocal.  It's a light-hearted run-through primarily to flush out the arrangement and get them familiar with the parts they potentially intended to play on the formal recording.  Here though, it sounds closer to a smoky blues-jazz club at 1:00 a.m. (something like \\"My Melancholy Blues\\" from their \\"News of the World\\" album) than the final version that ended up on the \\"Jazz\\" album with electric guitars, etc.  This is a great song and a nice alternate version to be enjoyed and to me, really rescues the bonus material disc.<br /><br />So, my grades:<br /><br />THE JAZZ ALBUM:  5 stars, a near flawless album.  Definitely one of Queen's very best!<br /><br />REMASTERING GRADE:  2.5 stars (avg because there's really no discernable difference, but at least they didn't ruin it)<br /><br />BONUS TRACKS: 2 stars because only 1 of the 5 tracks is really worthwhile here (\\"Dreamer's Ball\\").  And if you don't care much for that song, I dare say there's nothing of interest on this bonus disc and considering the so-so remastering, you might do just as well (and save some $) by picking up the 1991 version of \\"Jazz\\".

1594203334|4.0|A lot of these one-star reviews are from people who haven't even read the book. Like other reviewers, I gobbled up this book in under 48 hours because it's simply that good. It's not a how-to manual. The author is not a doctor or self-proclaimed child-rearing expert. She's not telling anyone how to live their lives. The book is the story of her experience as an American mom in France, and what she learned as a result of her investigation into how the French raise their children. It's funny, charming, well-written--and in the first person. Let the WSJ and Today Show run with hyperbolic headlines if they must. But don't judge the book by that standard.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|After reading dozens of bad reviews about the BluRay version of Ghostbusters, I decided to get this DVD set. Maybe at some future date they will re-master the movie and come out with a BluRay high-def version with better quality. Until they do, this DVD set of both Ghostbusters I and II is a nice double-feature for under $15, and who can beat that? This was a fun movie, I remember walking out of the theater with an ear-to-ear smile when I first saw it. This is arguably Rick Moranis' best performance of his entire career, and the rest of the crew is great, too. Here it is, 25 years later, and I can't look at a bag of marshmallows in a grocery store without thinking of Mr. Sta-Puft, waddling down the street there in New York like a marshmallow Godzilla, with that idiotic grin on his face.  Get your self a big bowl of popcorn and some raisinettes, pop this DVD in your machine, and prepare to be Entertained...If your TV and DVD player use two separate remotes, just \\"don't cross the beams!\\"<br /><br />Highly recommended - a nice double feature with some bonus features at a very nice price.
B006UG909U|2.0|Today Van Halen released there new cd A Different Kind Of Truth and I'm very disappointed with this cd. I can't belive this is the best they could do.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|For years, I wrote lengthy reviews of albums for a music magazine and I suppose I'd need to do that again if I were reviewing this album for a magazine.  However, those days are gone and this album only needs three words; Absolutely, positively STUNNING!  If you're into this genre, JUST BUY IT!  And Thomas Bergersen, if you ever happen to read this, may I please have a ten minute version of, \\"Hurt\\"?  WOW! Thank you, kind sir!  With \\"Illusions,\\" you just filled what had been a far too lengthy musical black hole in my life!  Fantastic from beginning to end!  More please!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|WOW isnt enough to describe this album. Heard the Born to Die on BBC and was completely mesmirized! From the voice to the lyrics! Original,creative, dark, melodic and very professionally produced! If you are into pop this isnt for you...if you hear a true talent in its development then this is it! Great Job Liz aka Lana!
B005I6EU48|5.0|I bought the tan version for my wife's Kindle Fire and immediately wanted one for my own.  It has a classic, elegant look to the cover, (would make you think that it belongs in some very old library)and the soft leather feel is nice and attractive.  I was able to easily slip the Kindle Fire into the corner straps that secure it to the cover and it's very comfortable in my hands when reading, either like a book or with the front of the cover folded back.  My neighbor took a look at it and now wants to change his cover to what I've got.  I think that it's definitely worth the money and is a good, solid investment to preserve the Kindle Fire.  I'm very happy with the purchase and would highly recommend to anyone who owns the Kindle Fire.
B0037ODTTK|5.0|The image and soundtrack transfer from film to BluRay disc on this release of The Terminator is very good. I mention this up front because some of these older movies (Ghostbusters is one example), have been released on BluRay with varying degrees of image quality problems like graininess, jerkiness, flickering, etc.  You can tell that this movie was not originally captured with digital movie recording technology, but it's as good as anyone could expect for a mid-80's film transfer to BluRay. If you like this movie, and don't already have a DVD copy of it, this release will give you a DVD and a BluRay disc. You can save a few bucks by buying the BluRay version by itself if you don't need a DVD.  The aspect ratio of the movie on this BluRay disc is 16:9 with no letterboxing. This is somewhat unusual, and I wonder if the original movie was wider, and some of the sides were cropped off?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this free version of Bible. You can't beat the ease of finding verses, the ability to take notes and post to facebook .. truly amazing I love it God bless.

B006UG90RM|5.0|This is Van Halen! This Album by far is there most powerful heaviest performance ever with instant classics.The music stands up on it's own without a singer. But David Lee Roth could not of asked for a better comeback album.As far as Eddie' Alex & wolfgang there sound is tight.By far the best playing by Eddie ever.The man is in his 50's & playing like an animal.The highlights of this Album would be every song on it.As far as the song Tatoo i like it but it is the worst song on the album.But it goes to show you cant judge a book by the cover!
B006UG90RM|4.0|Here's my brief opinion of the new disk: First six or seven songs, not so good.  Last six or seven tunes remind me of the good ol' days when VH rocked the cradle!
6304779356|5.0|The Two Coreys before they were spaced out on drugs.....Made this Horror flick really great.....the attack of Eddie Munster line will go down in history as one of the best lines in a movie. Neighborhood Vampires old grandpa new all along....its Great entertainment and can be watched with family...not just adults . Its Great
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This watch is definately worth the price that I paid @$60. The thought of paying retail of $180 would be ludicrous.  It seems to keep good time and is comfortable, but i can tell that the band will be an issue in the future. Perfect watch for work,nothing I would wear out to dinner, but then I wouldn't want to wear my nice watches to work. So it is well suited for its purpose. If I required another watch for the same purpose I would buy it again.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I have this on my Android phone and Kindle Fire and it's great. I can make notes in either place and they sync to the other.
B006T5FDLG|5.0|How can you go wrong to get over a half hour of music from Metallica for $5. They are unfinished ideas from the pre production of the Death Magnetic sessions. Just some major heavy jamming & tons of riff changes. none of the songs are finished so it has that really raw garage sound to it. I would rather have Metallica with this type of a garage feel to every album. And at least none of it sounds like Load or Reload.
B005NFJAZS|5.0|BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!! Seriously, dont even watch the current one. This movie is the best version of the Music Man

B0067Q42BY|5.0|very addictive game. I certainly have no complaints. well worth the price.  I would certainly buy again.  thinking I'll have to try other games. by this. company.
B0071T5PN0|1.0|Ahhh, its a wonder what promotion can do. It worked for Milli Vanilli, Hanson, and countless other bands with nothing to offer. It appears to be working with the new VH as everyone listens with their 'nostalgia' rather than their ears! A Different Kind of Truth is nothing but a Common Kind of Turd. Let me ask you geniuses that love this how often you listen to 'Me-wise Magic'or 'Can't get this stuff no more'? The answer is never, because those songs sucked when Roth tried this crap in the 90's and these songs suck just as bad now, we are all just older and more starved to relive old glory days.<br /><br />Yes, THE SONGS SUCK!!! You can rave all you want about Eddie's playing, but there is nothing here you haven't heard before from him. Retreaded leads and simple rhythm parts. The songs are disjointed pieces of crap that sound like a bunch of drunk guys sat around writing songs (not together) but about 1500 miles apart. Roth stinks, Wolfgang Van-Halen instead of Michael Anthony??? Get real.<br />Tattoo is an exercise in sloppy, half-hearted song writing, Stay Frosty sounds like a bad Van Halen cabaret band which is where VH should be. Oh, wait! Didn't Roth try that in Vegas and fail at that too?<br />This album is garbage that makes VH III sound like a classic.I am a huge VH fan of both the Roth and Hagar eras, but you can't listen to this and think it is anything but awful unless you are deaf, in which case you are one of the lucky ones. But, check out the reviews for VH III, some morons gave that 5 stars too.......
B000YDI9UG|5.0|I have wanted this pair of boots for a long time. I finally gave up and decided to sell one of my arms and legs to pay for them. Although they are a bit pricey, they are WELL worth it.<br /><br />The only boots I have ever owned have been from the Timberland \\"Pro Series\\" with the steel-toes, i.e. a work boot. Thus, I have been used to being able to kick stuff, drop sharp/heavy things on my feet, and remain comfortable in cold weather. THESE ARE NOT WORK BOOTS. If you drop something heavy on your toe, it will break your toe. They are not insulated well, so do not take them to the North Pole.<br /><br />However, they are exceptionally comfortable, lightweight, and real good lookin'. As for functionality, they are not useless. You can definitely hike, mess around in the woods, and do many other things outdoors, as they do provide decent protection and ankle support. Actually, I would recommend hiking in them due to their light weight (at times I thought I had concrete blocks on my feet with the old work boots).<br /><br />Now lets be honest - I bought these boots because they are attractive looking. When I received them, I was not disappointed at all. I mean, they are almost like a hybrid between a brown dress shoe and a boot. I would feel comfortable wearing these out to most places, and not worry about looking like I came straight from deer hunting in the mud.<br /><br />Buy them!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|amazing game I was so happy with it the only thing is the adds get a bit annoying but its free I wont complain
B005RZ8W94|5.0|4/30/2012:  Noticed a couple negative reviews.  FYI, the 2 disc version is region 0 and plays fine on my dvd player.  Maybe BluRay isn't all that this time.  Original review:  I think Volbeat are an above average band.  They are not quite a metal band, but play metal music at times.  Their sound is a hybrid of old Rock 'n roll, metal, punk, country, and possibly thrash.  If you are reading this, you are already aware what this band sounds like.  They have good songs but man can they cut it live.  They play some great songs live on this concert from Copenhagen in November 2010.  The sound is fantastic but the real joy is the video.  No fast panning or microsecond editing here.  No, no, no, old school camera angles with enough screen time to watch the vocalist sing a part or watch the guitarist play a lick that you might figure out how to play by watching him.  The crowd eats up this performance and why not, they create a killer atmosphere with guest vocalists and musicians just adding more variety to the Big Top.  These guys are quickly becoming one of my favorite bands, after watching this, they may very well become one of yours as well.  Highly Recommended!  The music CD that was released at the same time has songs from both dvd shows and mixes them up so that not all of the main concert is represented on CD.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|they are fun games and entertaining enough, but its a little confusing figuring out the point system and what to download. but overall its a good app and its free so definitley worth it.
143352869X|5.0|I have been wanting this bible for the longest time! It was well worth the wait! Not only does it read fluidly, and stays true to text, but the commmentary, colored maps, and extras through each book of the bible make it interesting and also add so much. I only wish it was a little smaller, but it is a beautiful bible, and I wont be replacing it anytime soon!!!
B005RYF5JA|3.0|Disappointed,,,,  Not with the venue, the songs, or the orchestration.  Here's whats disappointing:  The quality of the video is horrible. Anything other than a closeup is fuzzy. It's not my dvd player or my tv causing the problem, it's the dvd itself. Not asking for blu-ray perfection, just the same quality I get from every other concert/movie I have in my collection. I don't even own a blu-ray player.  Also disappointing is the way Celtic Woman is becoming like a box of chocolates,,,,,,,,,,,,you never know what you're gonna get. Last year Alex & Lynn were introduced, but just as soon as you warmed up to them, they're gone. Now we have Lisa L (who I think is fantastic) replacing Alex & Lynn. How long will she be around? Don't get too attached.  In reality Celtic Woman should be called Celtic Trio,,, with Chloe, Maried & Lisa K (when she's not having a baby), along with one or two temporary fill-ins as needed.  I hope they don't start taking their fans for granted & just throw anybody/anything out there, figuring the name itself is enough of a draw. Fans have their limits.  And PLEASE do something about the video quality. A smart phone can do better.  : = (

B006UG90RM|5.0|A Different Kind Of Truth is a fantastic album by one of the very best American rock n' roll bands of all-time.  With all the lineup changes and personal problems w/in the band over the years, it's no small wonder that they have gotten it together.  This album just so far surpasses any of my expectations.  There simply is not a weak song on the entire set.  With David Lee Roth back in his rightful place on the mic, they have created a modern day masterpiece.  This will easily and I mean easily be the best album of 2012 regardless of genre.  It pays homage to just about every style of the Roth-era led VH.  And Eddie Van Halen.  What can you say.  He just throttles the guitar throughout the album.  It's just amazing how 28 years later they could have pulled this off.  I don't know if there is any other band ever in history that could have had such a long layoff, only to have guys in their 50s make such a great record.  The highlight tracks are too numerous to mention.  If you are/were a fan of David Lee Roth fronted Van Halen, you simply must buy this record.  They really pulled it off.  Welcome back boys.  You and your great music has been sorely missed amidst the crappy landscape of current rock and pop trash being recorded.  Long live Van Halen.
B006UG90RM|4.0|I was really skeptical when I heard the song \\"Tattoo\\" and hated it 2-3 weeks ago when they released the video.  The song sounded like a bad DLR solo project.  I was really expecting the worst when I bought this cd.  Boy was I wrong.  The music is great!  I think Dave's voice sounds great for his age.  It is not the best but it is far better than what I was expecting.  Yes, I sorely miss Michael Anthony's high octave harmonies.  If M. Anthony was in the fold this would be a 4 1/2 effort.  If there weren't one or two clunkers and the opening track Tattoo then I would give it 5 stars.  I am not going to go over the album track by track.  Look at some 4 and 5 star reviews for that.  This is definately a solid 4 that grows on you each listen, especially the second half of the CD.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its a pretty fun app and will definitly take a long time to.beat all of the different game in it
1451648537|5.0|As a computer science student, I found this book to be quite entertaining. It clarified and expounded stories I've heard about Steve Jobs and Apple's past throughout college from professors, colleagues and interviews with other people in the tech industry (outside of the context of this book).
B006GKHE6G|5.0|I would strongly recommend you download this game for your Kindle Fire.  It is very engaging, easy and fun to play.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great for a free app.  Will definitely make those long car rides more tolerable.  Still ran into several unwinnable games.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Didn't like this 3rd book so much. How do I hate thee, let me count the ways :<br /><br />1. Lack of character development<br />2. Disjointed story line<br />3. Felt I was being pushed quickly toward an ending where nothing else before it really mattered, just chapters of filler so the last chapter could be written.<br />4. I get the \\"non-hero\\" thing, but from book 1 to 3, Katniss went from heroine to boring political tool to boring political tool with mental issues...I found myself, as a reader, having less and less buy-in to the main character, so by the end I was like \\"oh well, who cares, it's over.\\" ... Not how you want to end a trilogy, unless that was what the author was going for...
B002JTWJWW|5.0|This movie is one of my all time favorites full of romance, comedy and really fun characters. This movie arrived quickly, and I had no problems whatsoever. Would use this seller again.
B004LZF2LW|4.0|Comes with only 5 time zones for whole globe:  New York, Los Angeles, Honalulu, London, & Sydney.  Doesn't seem to be a way to add more & I alhave tried.<br /><br />Edited to add:  On initial install, menu option didn't include \\"add clock\\" so I deleted the app.  Developer said it should be there, so reinstalled it and it took 2x as long to re-install than it did initially but the \\"add clock\\" option was there this time.<br /><br />So I upgraded rating, only deducting a star for the trouble to get it working.  Works like  champ now.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It is totally worth spending the extra couple bucks to get this case instead of a cheaper one.  The rubberized case feels good in the hands and wont slip out of your hands.  There is a rubber nylon thing that keeps the case open or closed, and there is a stand for when you are watching a video.  It is really easy to put in and out of the case, and the speakers and power button, and input jacks are all available for use when in the case.  Worth the money.
B006UG90RM|1.0|Bought this on my way home from a long trip when I had about 100 miles left. Popped it in the CD player and by the 6th song I was already regretting the purchase. Struggled my way through the rest, hoping for some sort of indication that this was worth the wait, but alas nothing. Every song reminded me of the worst songs on their first six albums; actually take their first album out of that because nothing on this album even compares to anything on that album.  Ed's guitar playing is good but nothing we haven't heard before. The harmonies were OK but definitely missing Mike. But what made this album such a (no pun-intended given the cover) train-wreck was Roth's horrendous vocals. I can't even call it singing because it was that bad. His vocal range has even diminished further than I thought (not that he ever had much to begin with). Most of the songs he doesn't really sing but mumbles, and on one it sounds briefly like he tries to make an attempt to rap. Overall this album is horrible.  And let me save you the trouble of accusing me of simply being a Hagar-troll. Not the case, but neither do I bend at the knee to everything VH. Personally I've never really understood why anyone felt the need to pick sides. I liked most all of VH up until this album, but fully concede that the definitive Van Halen sound can be found on their first six albums. But this album doesn't come close to any of their previous albums.
B00471Z3CI|5.0|I must love this movie. I've seen it many times. Saw it with my mom when it was released. Saw it with my kids when they were small. Now my grandchildren 10 & 13 say it's their 'favorite movie of all time!' It's funny and scary but without blood and gore. It's perfect for all ages ....well maybe 10 and up! Enjoy!
B002UJIY7A|2.0|ok movie --- like Timothy Olyphant -- but not his character in this movie.  Thought the part where it shows his head injury is dumb.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is the version of Settlers you should by! Not only is the game awesome (it turns non-gamers into gamers), the box is sturdy, the pieces well made. The basic looking robber token, the stick roads are much nicer than other more elaborated &#34;life-like&#34; plastic versions. The only (minor) drawback I can point is that the ocean borders are initially bendy and tend to arch, but if you squash them under a heavy book they'll stay flat.
B004LUS390|5.0|I only wish there were a pen available to draw with because my fingertip is too fat. Aside from that this app is awesome.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I have never been a huge Van Halen fan.  I have always liked them and have several of their CDs, but I would never have considered myself a big fan.  With that said...This album is amazing.  The riffs, the drums, the lyrics - it's all perfect.  If you would have told me I would be saying this about a VH album in 2012, I would have told you you have lost your mind.  I hope this is not their farewell album.  I hope it's only the beginning.
B0042RUMJG|2.0|this concert may not be your cup of tea.  The arrangements for this performance are very different and, in my opinion, Sting leaves out some of his records.  This is not your ordinary Sting concert.  Buyer beware.
B006UG909U|4.0|On A Different Kind of Truth, Van Halen is reborn. Upon hearing the first single \\"Tattoo\\", I figured this new album would be good but still make you long for the old days. But the boys got their mojo back big time. No ballads, no going through the motions, this is straight out in your face rock n' roll. The production is also very well done: it's loud while not being overly compressed. Upon hearing these songs for the first time, you already know these will sound amazing live. The performances are full of vigor as David Lee Roth's charisma is on full display while Eddie Van Halen's guitar work is that of a man possessed. All of the songs range from good to great with the aforementioned and decent \\"Tattoo\\" being perhaps the weakest track. \\"You and Your Blues\\", \\"Blood and Fire\\", and \\"Stay Frosty\\" have catchy riffs and choruses and would be excellent choices as the next singles. \\"Stay Frosty\\", in particular, is very good as its acoustic intro and David's delivery recalls the vibe of \\"Take Your Whiskey Home\\" and \\"Ice Cream Man\\" before the drums kick in. \\"China Town\\", \\"As Is\\", and \\"Honeybabysweetie Doll\\" are among the heaviest songs they've ever recorded and Eddie's solos are really menacing on these tunes.  Other spirited tracks here include \\"Big River\\", \\"Outta Space\\", and \\"The Trouble with Never\\". Easily their best album since 1984 and better than any of the albums with Sammy Hagar or Gary Cherone, A Different Kind Of Truth is one of the strongest hard rock albums of recent years, certainly nothing you'd expect with the three core guys in the band pushing 60. Highly recommended.

B0067QPVD2|1.0|I am all for adding to a mythos but that doesn't mean it is always a good thing (no pun intended).  How can one rate this film without looking at the John Carpenter version? Since it is meant as a direct prequel, I would argue that you can't. So, from an the point of view of one of the members of the expedition (which was John Carpenter's intent)let's give an overview of that version:  An antarctic research crew encounters a being which can mimic anyone or anything it absorbs (and summarily duplicates). It turns out that this being is extraterrestrial in origin and is both cunning and pretty successful as an ambush predator, not to mention very intelligent. It is the ultimate ninja (not the video game kind) as it patiently waits, bides its time and methodically begins taking over whomever it can. It acts with intelligence and foresight by absorbing/assuming individuals as it can and only ONLY acting in direct opposition when cornered, exposed or weak. But even then it has a back-up plan. When it ambushed Bennings and was discovered part way through, it (as the Thing was also at least Palmer and Norris by this time) acted against itself to protect the greater whole. Now none of this is to say the Thing didn't make some mistakes. It did attack the dogs under the assumption that it would be able to successfully absorb all of them. The noise worked against it in that case. The point being is the Thing acted with intelligence as a thinking being would do and was under the same (or very similar) physical limitations as terrestrial creatures. Even the finale blatantly suggested that freezing was now its plan as a rescue team would likely show up eventually taking it to more civilized areas.  Now here comes The Thing (2011), the prequel the the 1982 John Carpenter version which deals with the Norwegian Camp's experiences. Did not have any problem with any of the actors. Felt Mary Elizabeth Winstead was great for her part. The film itself? Hmm, let's see, early in the film they find the block of ice containing the Thing. It then breaks out of the ice? Really? So it freezes because it can't do anything else but then breaks out of the ice because, what, it didn't really need to allow itself to freeze in the first place. I am confused at this point. As the film progresses, one of the Things is now in a helicopter being taken away from the Norwegian camp which would eventually lead to more civilized areas (**Edit: I stand corrected, the helicopter was called back to the base before the Thing attacked. I still feel the attack in the air goes against how the Thing normally acted as both patient hunter and intelligent creature). So instead of biding its time it attacks the helicopter crew and allowing itself to crash and be trapped back at the Norwegian camp? Really? I guess the whole intelligent being idea was totally scrapped. I did like the idea that it can't replicate artificial parts (i.e. fillings and knees replacements) but then it decides to ambush our Hero Mary Elizabeth Winstead in the most profoundly clumsy and noisy way possible? Really? Which of course does not succeed and puts everyone that wasn't already on edge, in total Red Alert mode. I'm sorry, the film came off the rails pretty quick in Act II. What followed was just a loud, noisy action film with plenty of monster hi-jinx and scene match-ups with the 1982 version of The Thing when they travel to the Norwegian camp.  Ultimately a failure in my opinion, due to the plot, writing or whatever mechanism completely stripped our villain (i.e. The Thing) of any true intellect and cunning. Again, while the performances were all solid it ended up being a pretty heartless outing overall and not worthy of its title. My only hope is that people will look to (re)connect with the far superior John Carpenter version. I would love to see more in this universe/sub-genre/whatever but if they are going to throw out the truly interesting and unique aspects, why bother? Judging by the reviews Ican only assume the vast majority enjoy loud, CGI pseudo-gore action/sci-fi/horror films and it is a pity.

B0015DROBO|3.0|With all the excitement about the movie it occurred to me I have never written my review of  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson.  I bought the Kindle edition of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson back in 2010 for three reasons, it was on the NYT top ten, everyone was talking about it, and I downloaded it for a bargain of $5.50. I haven't seen that price since the movie hit the big screen.<br />As of June 3, 2011, the book had remained on the NYT best seller list for over 128 weeks and as of this post is currently #4. The other two books in the trilogy have done almost as well. I imagine after they hit the big screen the sales will sky rocket also.<br />For the love of me, I cannot see what all the hub bub is about. I struggled through this book. Stop don't stone me. Yes there was intrigue and suspense which kept me turning the pages to that I admit. But the majority of the time I felt lost and confused throughout the book. The grisly crimes were difficult at times to read. Lisbeth Salander was a girl who could get the job done and understood revenge, this made me want to cheer for her but the dark side made it almost impossible to do so.<br />The ending was disappointing, not in leaving me wanting more as some have suggested, but in leaving me more confused and sad.<br />I have to say for me this book gets only 3 stars. [..]
B006UG90RM|4.0|It is hard to review this album, and I will admit that whole-heartedly and will explain.  I was 10 in 1984, and I fell head over heals in love with Van Halen at that time.  I was broken hearted when David Lee Roth left the band, but I followed both sides as a listener.  I fully embraced the new VH release of 5150, and I enjoyed it immensely.  I loved Eat Em And Smile as well.  As years went on, both sides failed to release music that held my attention.  I longed for a \\"true\\" reunion of Van Halen.  I did not see Van Halen live with David Lee Roth, but I was able to catch two tours with Sammy Hagar.  The For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge Tour was very good, but the 2004 Hagar reunion was a disappointment.  I dismissed Van Halen altogether for a long time, and I found other things to like and listen to.  However, the old Van Halen albums would be dusted off and listened to with great joy.<br /><br />When it was announced that Roth was going to tour with Van Halen in 2007 without Michael Anthony on bass, I cried \\"Blasphemy!\\"  I plugged my ears and went on humming things to block out the news.  I think Michael Anthony is not only underrated as a bass player, but is really the background vocals in Van Halen regardless of who is the front man.  I thought yeah whatever Wolfie on bass, ok?  Nothing released in terms of new music.  Ugh.  I figured there was no hope of an album or anything substantial ever.  I again was resigned to the fact that Van Halen was essentially history.<br /><br />Then...a single, then an announcement of a tour and an album.  I finally heard the song, \\"Tattoo.\\"  Oh, ah, yeah, I am not sure...the rest of the album is going to be terrible if this is the lead single.  However, I found myself humming the song, and every once in a while singing, \\"Tattoo, tattoo!\\"  It grew on me.  Then I found previews of other songs on the internet.  I recognized that about half of the album was directly off the Gene Simmons demo that I already had found on the internet a few years ago.  I thought this is nonsense...<br /><br />However, I went to my favorite record store and picked up a copy of the deluxe edition.  I watched the DVD of acoustic songs first.  That was somewhat cool to see David Lee Roth actually singing within a few feet of Eddie...funny that they have been apart for so long.  I listened to the album.  It was ok.  I thought the revised versions of demos sounded better on an official release, and the new lyrics dressed up the songs a bit.  Then I played it again.  I loaded on my iPod Nano and listened while running.  I put it in the car stereo and cranked it a bit.  It is growing on me to the point of near obsession.  My favorite band from childhood actually reunited with the lead singer and released an album!!!  Oh my god...it really happened.  First, I will say that Eddie's guitar playing is again inspired and fresh.  It sounds like the creative Eddie that experimented with sounds, pick-ups, etc.  The bass playing (I don't know if the rumors are true that Eddie played the bass in studio) sounds more up front and gives a nod to Billy Sheehan on Eat Em And Smile.  If Wolfie is in fact doing all the bass duties, then he is doing a great job.  There are different tones of distortion and walking bass lines that are enjoyable.  The background vocals sound similar under the father-son duo, but I can tell that Mad Mike is not there.  The drumming is classic Alex.  Nothing stands out on the drums as the opening of Hot For Teacher does on 1984, but this is a solid performance.  Now the best part, David Lee Roth's voice...it sounds surprisingly youthful.  There are a couple of his signature screams in there.  Is it the same as the golden era?  Of course not.  The guy is 56 years old, but he does still have the same style and energy as he did on 1984.  I have always preferred Roth to Hagar as many VH fans out there, and I am happy to have him back to the point of allowing myself to understand he has aged...albeit pretty well.<br /><br />But what about Michael Anthony?  I realized from the acoustic songs on the DVD that half of the background vocals are still there.  Eddie does a lot more background vocals than I realize (as many a VH fan may not always remember).  One might forget that Ed can use his pipes as well as his fingers.  He uses a falsetto style to give that high-pitched VH chorus a hint of yesterday.  MOREOVER, when given the opportunity to bring your son into the family business, who wouldn't?  I know I would love to have that type of involvement with my son later in life.  Do I miss Michael Anthony and feel bad for him?  Sure.  However, I think there is an excitement for a somewhat unknown (Wolfgang) to join his dad on stage and rock!  In addition, I think Michael Anthony is doing ok with Joe Satriani and company in a little thing called Chickenfoot.<br /><br />As far as half the album being old tunes?  Well, when you look at the history of Van Halen with David Lee Roth as singer, you will notice that they rehashed old material every once in a while.  Many of the 25 songs from the Warner Brothers demos were sprinkled over the 6-album discography.  Much of the original Van Halen catalog was written prior to their being signed by a major label and included in their touring in 1977 and 78.  Download the Gene Simmons demo or the Warner Brothers demo and see for yourself.  One example is House Of Pain, which was written and performed early in VH's history, but not recorded until the release of 1984.  Some of the first songs did not make the first record, and many of them made it onto VH II.  The old material provides a type of marriage to the new material tying 1977-78 to 2012.  Thinking of it this way made sense to me in a way that allowed my hackles to go down.<br /><br />As far as this new songs and album goes...I really enjoy listening to it.  I have done so at least two dozen times now, and I really enjoy it.  Due to the length of this review, I will comment on my own review with a track-by-track analysis including a note on which songs are old ones and on the Gene Simmons demo.realized from the acoustic songs on the DVD that half of the background vocals are still there.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|overall, a preety good but it would better if you could buy games for less. that and smoother gameplay would make the app be 5*'s
B004EBUXSA|5.0|well this processor has allot going for it that even the newest processors can only match (especially AMD, bleh). Overclocking is its strong point, got it to 5.2 GHz with water cooling of course no sweat and runs stable. Another high note is the hyper threading and it also takes fuller advantage of the OS you use and overall performance of anything u throw at it like games, apps, etc.. etc.. I would definitely recommend to those not willing to pay an arm and a leg for the newest set of processors to hit the market. This processor still has allot of potential and thats just the tip of the iceberg what i described, I'm still learning its nuances. Great buy and overall great value. 2 THUMBS UP TO INTEL!!!
B006UG90RM|2.0|I'm a very very big Van Halen fan.  I'm not one of those people that have to choose between Dave or Sammy.  I love all of the music that Van Halen has put out with the exception of this album.  This album is trash. David Lee Roth has not written a good song since 1984.  The songs miss the background vocals of Michael Anthony. The music its self is pretty poor. It sounds like an album of B-Side Van Halen songs. We have waited since 1998 for Van Halen to put out a full album, and this is what they come up with? Pass.  This is of course my opinion and I'm not right and I'm not wrong.
B005TPCQ5I|5.0|I am not an avid film reviewer in any way, so I will simply let others debate the merits or flaws of this film. I will simply tell you how the film made me feel as a viewer.<br /><br />This is not a romantic film that slaps you in the face like many movies do, and I thought it was all the better for that. It wasn't showy or scripted smart (and I love some of those films too), it was real and everyday and rather wonderful. A fixed beat that sounded every year that allowed us a glimpse into two lives - without trying to compress all the story elements in, was very effective and none more so then when the beat was halted albeit temporarily.<br /><br />I thought the acting was superb, especially Jim Sturgess and Romola Garai. Maybe I am old but it does seem that hindsight is such an impossible gift and that the memories that we fill our lives are so marvellously flawed.

B006UG90RM|2.0|Eddie's final attempt to be relevant again is so forced I don't know where to begin. Van Halen had a chance to be a constant musical force in 1991 when they were on top with the superb \\"carnal knowledge.\\" The band's cowardly move to steer the music into the grungy-whiny-sloppy direction in 95 ultimately ruined them. After the lukewarm reception in their US and European tours, and the public's ignorance of their much hyped trash-metal-esque movie soundtrack song, Eddie got rid of Sammy to reinvent the band. Then, the even whinier-grungier-slopppier VHIII came out. Then the two trash-metalized songs with Sammy in 04. Fans rejected all of that and wanted to hear the fun, fast, and furious Van Halen. This is Eddie's half-hearted, involuntary attempt to give the fans their \\"bang your head against the wall\\" type of music. The songs lack soul, the performances lack inspiration, the recording lacks direction. Even the album cover is stolen. And don't even get me started with Dave's singing/rambling. Just listen to the actual \\"blood&fire.\\" that is, \\"ripley\\" from 1984, and you hear the kind of chemistry and inspiration that had put Eddie, Al and the first two incarnations of the band to the top of musical excellence. Now, all I can hope for Eddie is that he stays healthy and has a happy personal life, since he already gave us so much greatness.

B006OAB3ME|2.0|I've always been a huge Beatles and McCartney fan. Ever since I was introduced to the Beatles back in 1964, Paul has been my favorite Beatle. I used to like everything about him, his compositions, his guitar/bass playing but most of all, his vocals. He could make a crappy tune sound real good to my ears...every time.  Musically, this album is good. I like most of the tunes Paul selected and Diana's group made them all shine. Paul's vocals on the other hand is very disappointing and painful to say the least. If only he sang the songs like he did on track 12, the album would have sounded much more pleasant. His pronunciation sounds funny. It's almost as if he's wearing false teeth or something. Perhaps he meant to sound as if he were singing at an intimate night club, piano-bar style. If that was the intent, he failed miserably. Instead, his voice just sounds old and out of place. I think he could lower the key on many tunes, not because he can't reach the high notes but because it would suit this music style much better. Ringo's Sentimental Journey album was a good example. All in all, unless you are a die-hard McCartney fan like myself and MUST have every single one of his albums (again like myself), I'd skip this one and hope that his next album reaches back to his rock'n roll roots.  *** NEW comments ***  After listening to the album quite a few times, I'd like to add a few more comments about it. This time, just about the music.  McCartney is probably one of the best, most versatile composer of our time. Not that everything he's written is good, on the contrary. But, he has certainly composed hundreds of great songs. This album does not go without. \\"Only Our Hearts\\" is a beautiful tune that perfectly blends with all other great old songs he chose. Unless you read the booklet, it's almost impossible to tell that this is a brand new song. Steve's harmonica was perfect and complemented the song beautifully. \\"My Valentine\\" on the other hand sounds ordinary. Not really out of place but not very good either. Now, talking out-of-place, I really did not understand song \\"The Inch Warm\\" is there. Cute tune and all but it has absolutely nothing to do with the mood and style of the album. With a different arrangement, it could easily be on the B side of Mary Had a Little Lamb! I'm sure Paul left out many other tunes that would be better fits.

B0008ENHUI|5.0|There have been many great prison movies over the years that have been made. \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" and \\"Cool Hand Luke\\" are two that come to mind right off the top of my head. But without a doubt I feel the best of all the prison movies ever made is \\"Papillon\\". Based on the autobiography of Henri Charriere, aka Papillon (french for butterfly) for the butterfly tatoo he had on his chest, it stars Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. McQueen had a brillient career with many fine movies to his credits but \\"Papillon\\" is I think the best of the best he ever made. This movie also rates among the best films that Dustin Hoffman ever made as well. In a nutshell the movie is about Charriere, a Frenchman, who is a safe cracker who is falsely arrested and convicted of murder. He is sent to serve his sentence at the penal colony in French Guiana. On the boat taking the prisoners to the penal colony Papillon meets Dega played by Hoffman who was convicted of counterfeiting French bonds. Dega is a marked man. The prisoners know he is carrying on him a large amount of cash and they would kill Dega at the first chance they had to get at the money. Papillon works out a deal with Dega to protect him til they get to French Guiana. Once there Dega will under write any attempt Papillon makes to break out of prison. In real life Henri Cherriere attempted 7 or 8 times to escape from the prison. His last attempt at escape was from Devil's Island. He was the first, and I believe the only person, to successfully escape from the island and would go on the live the rest of his life as a free man. The movie due to time constrants only show three of those escape attempts, including the final escape from Devil's Island. What makes this movie the best amoung prison movies is the real life grittiness of prison life. There are points where faint of heart may not be able to watch certain scenes of the movie. But it is the realisticness of prison life there at French Guiana that makes this such a great movie. The harsh starkness of punishment and living conditions the men have to endur leaves you wondering how anyone could survive. Prison life in \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" looks delightful in comparison. If I had to come up with a top 5 list of my favorite movies this would be in that list. I highly recommend it.vie.

B006W0QOF2|1.0|We kept waiting for the action, the thrill, I guess the only thrill was shown in the trailer. Big disappointment.
B003UD7JEE|5.0|What a great choice to cast Maggie Q in this new incarnation of Nikita. Its nice to see talented female Asian action stars finally getting the lead roles and recognition they deserve.  In response to J. Lopez comment that: Maggie Q is a pixie who couldn't take on a 250 lb. baddie. What an ignorant comment! Have you ever heard of Bruce Lee? He also appeared unopposing, small and even skinny (fully clothed) but no one would have questioned his ability to take down any \\"baddie\\" of any size. There are many other examples both male and female (Jet Li and Yukari Oshima immediately come to mind).
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins is the final book of the Hunger Games trilogy. Katniss Everdeen the teenage heroine is again at the center of the action. She is a guest of District 13 which is leading the rebellion against the Capitol of Panem. Panem is is a brutal country that rules harshly over the various districts that comprise the country. District 13 has stayed independent because they possess nuclear weapons and have also built their cities deep underground to withstand Capitol bombing.<br /><br />Katniss finds out very soon that life is brutal in District 13 also. I learned a new word while researching this book: Dystopia. No it is not some sort of strange disease, it is the opposite of Utopia (and could be a good word for Words with Friends or Scrabble.) A Utopia is where life is great and everybody is fulfilled, a Dystopia is where from outward appearances everything is Utopian but where really life is repressive. So this trilogy is called Dystopian. So Katniss slowly realizes that District 13 may be no better than the Capitol in the way their citizens are treated.<br /><br />The trilogy is marketed to teenagers but there is plenty of meat here for grownups. The choices that the characters make are complex and have consequences. There is lots to think about how social movements tend to be hijacked by those in control to achieve their own ends. (I'm thinking about how the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street movements have been hijacked by our two political parties)  The first two thirds of Mockingjay is much slower paced than the other books because it has to do with Katniss becoming aware of what is really happening. The last third of the book has plenty of fighting, killing, and gore.<br /><br />I'm kind of a fan of many books marketed to teenagers. I'm no prude but I like the concentration on the story and characters and the absence of cheesy sex scenes and bad language. I guess I'm turning into a little old lady.<br /><br />I rate the book four stars out of five.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|My wife and I love his soul moving music. Especially his earlier work. However, maybe he rushed this album out or just wasnt quite ready. Dont get me wrong, he's still in the ELITE of performers. But I feel like this offering of songs is just,well, mediocre at best.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Obviously, they are NOT die hard fans, but fly by night bandwagon jumpers. Probably started liking them when 5150 came out. While not a true VH reunion because Michael Anthony is not on the CD, this is as close as it gets. This rocks! The boys sound so tight and energetic! This is what rock and roll is all about; good, loud, and fun. I believe this is the comeback album of the past 10 years. Eddie is playing great, Dave sounds super, Alex is still a monster on the drums, and Wolfgang is doind well. Brings me back to the late 70's early 80's. Real VH fans are sure to enjoy it!

B006OAB3ME|2.0|I guess buyer beware. This album is a collection of old standards Pauls sings with minimum orchestration behind him. You had to love music of the 30s and 40s to appreciate this.  My only complaint is now Paul McCartney .com is announcing the release of Kisses on the Bottom in a \\"Deluxe CD\\" with 2 extra tracks not on this pre-ordered version from Amazon. That sucks. I won't pre-order any more from Amazon as this is the second time this has happened with a pre-release.

B004WR125O|3.0|Couldn't get this to work after messing around with it for three days on my TX-NR709.  Plugged it in and the process hung at the Manual/Automatic screen.  Wouldn't go beyond this screen. I found out I was too impatient. This machine needs to initialize first. Turn it to USB mode w/o plugging this device in.  Let it initialize in USB mode for a minute or so first. After USB mode has initialized, then plug this device in. Everything went fine after I figured this out.  It took three days of messing around to figure this out. After USB modes initialized, it saw the device and my wireless network, no problem. I about shot thru the roof. Finally happy. Almost returned it because every attempt to install this failed for the first three days. I had plugged this device in too soon without letting USB mode intialize first.  An amazing amount of radio is available. More than I can ever listen to, and wonderful.  Wonderful streaming music from my pc music folder too with DINA.

B000ASATZ8|5.0|hello, i just love these shows. they are really alot of fun to watch. and out of all four movies, it looks as if they only keep one original character to the end. thats the weapons man as i call him. he always has lots of guns and destructive toys. anyways he was in all four movies. i think these movies have action,comedy, a little romance. its really fun anyways. i cant wait to ever see if they come out with number five? anyways i recommend them.
B006UG90RM|4.0|I have listened to this album probably 15 times now and I like it more and more with each successive listen.  Don't believe the naysayers here.  They probably fancy themselves music critics after listening to an album one time through.  Eddie and Alex's playing are fantastic throughout and Dave sounds really good in my opinion.  Michael Anthony's background vocals are definitely missing, but it doesn't spoil the overall experience of absorbing each song.  In the end, all that matters is whether each person who buys the album likes it for themselves.  I pronounce it a winner.
B005QJZ5FA|4.0|The album has a retro-modern feel to it. It's like 60s music interwoven with hip hop and it's really good. She's a good songwriter and has very good, voice. I would also describe this album as cinematic. These songs belong in a Quentin Tarantino movie. She definitely aims big and it able to carry it off. Finally, some real music. She looks Julia Roberts. Best tracks - Video Games, Born to Die, Diet Mountain Dew, Off to the Races and Summertime Sadness. There is not a bad song in the lot though.

B0062KMDZ2|5.0|Trying to find that perfect blend between OOS (Out of Screen) effects and depth is what 3D is all about, for me anyway. Some will say that OOS effects are gimmicky or childish and would say to them so what, I want to see some good OOS effects when watching a 3D film.  Just giving depth to the film is only half the technology of 3D. Currently I have not found many 3D films with good consistent OOS effects, especially in the Live Action genera.  As for Journey to the Center of the Earth 3D, they hit the nail on the head. Fantastic depth and OOS effects are found all throughout this film, from the opening scene with an insects antenna coming right at your face this film is a real 3D feast for the whole fam. Its tough paying the high price for 3D films and then not getting the full effect of 3D technology, but this film delivers.  If you like 3D with OOS effects, this film is definitively worth it.  The new Journey with the Rock looks promising as well.  This is a good one guys/gals, collection worthy fo show.
B004EPYZXK|5.0|If you are a NASA Space Program nerd from the 60's And 70's you will like this movie. Hardware Appears accurate. If you are not a fan of Apollo then this movie could be hard for you to follow, and slow.  Born in the 50's and growing up watching the space program I enjoyed this movie very much.
1451627289|4.0|I am smiling at some of the reviews that say they are half way through, or three quarters through and are struggling with it because at that point I was also ready to speed through the rest of the book, or worse yet, jump ahead to the end. I feel like I have no right to criticize a successful writer like Mr. King, but I think he could have scaled the book down some. I understand that he was trying to create an athmosphere surrouning Jodie and Sadie, but I think he spent too much time with that and it bogged down the book. Some of it was downright corney and smarmy, but perhaps that's what he was trying to convey, the mood of that time period in that small town.  Anyway, my opinion now that I've finished it is a better appreciation for it than it was at three quarters in.  So if you're in the middle of reading it and you want to give up on it, don't.  It's worth finishing.
B000JML7EC|5.0|This is a terrific adventure story. It capitalizes on the romance of piracy, while exposing the moral emptiness in an entertaining way.<br />A story from the point of view of pirates or the ships they attacked would simply be about straight up murder, robbery and rapine. By starting out on dry land, and focusing on the treasure on a tropical island in the Caribbean, Stevenson is able to present the pirates as real, fearsome but pitiable people.<br />Although Jim Hawkins was warned to watch out for the one legged man, he and everyone else falls for the lies of Long John Silver -- one indication people with lost limbs were so not unusual at that time.<br />Long John Silver is capable of absolute moral relativism (in modern terms). He's capable of being pleasant, friendly and seemingly reliable while plotting treachery. When his plans fail (partly because the pirates are incapable of sustained discipline), he switches sides again to sell out his friends and escape the noose, and then slips away at the end.<br />You have to wonder why a fast food chain would be named after him.<br />The author has a keen eye for the fun of a treasure hunt, and even keener eye for the human failings of both the good guys and bad guys.
B006UG90RM|5.0|OK, the bottom line is this CD is GREAT. Like they just stepped back after doing \\"Fair Warning\\". Wolfie has good chops and harmonizes VERY well, Eddie is in the best form he has been in years, Alex is the glue that holds this together and he doesn't miss a beat, and as for Diamond Dave...yeah he shows some signs of age but what do you want from a dude in his 50's? It gives him character and gives the songs that rough around the edges feel that really works on this disc.  Personally I don't miss Michael Anthony all that much. He plays bass and can carry a note...congrats, So can Wolfie. Last I saw the band was called \\"VAN HALEN\\"...no Anthony in there at all.  Don't get me wrong...I like Chickenfoot and have been a huge Sammy fan (and Sam Halen) since Standing Hampton, I just don't get the whole taking sides crap. Both bands jam, Sammy rocks, Van Halen in any form (except that Gary Cherone dumpster fire) rocks and Chickenfoot smokes too. Put em all on shuffle and dig the tunes...cuz thats what it's all about!!

0385535139|3.0|I've read most of Grisham's books and bought this one based on past generally positive experiences. I found the book lacked a stimulating story and failed to  grab my interest, so much so that I wondered if a student had churned it out according to some formula. Not worth the time. Thers are plenty of better books to read.
0887307280|4.0|The main idea in this book is fantastic - small business owners need to create a system for their business that allows it to run without them.  It's the franchise model - you could sell the system to someone else and they could set it all up and run their own successful business.  Or you could walk away from your own business and it would be successful without you.<br /><br />However the book is told in a weird narrative format that I hated listening to (I had an audiobook version).  The author was a door-to-door encyclopedia salesman and I feel like I'm getting sold for half the book.  There is also a lot of principles without any real world application.<br /><br />I loved the example of the hotel the author stayed at in northern california, and the idea that a small business owner has to be a technician, manager, and entrepreneur.  Overall I'm glad I read the book, but I'll never read (or listen) to this cover to cover again.

0385344228|2.0|After all the great reviews, I was really expecting a page turner.  Couldn't wait until it was time to climb in bed and become lost in the storyline.  That didn't happen  for me.  While I certainly wasn't hooked on the first page as others described, I figured it would just take me some time to get into it.  Some really great books are like that and you have to be patient.  Just never happened for me. I didn't love the characters and didn't care about what happened to  them the way one should with a good book.  I found the protaganist a self-absorbed and very 'beige' personality.  This one just didn't do it for me at all!
B006UG90RM|5.0|I won't waste my time talking about how long we've all been waiting for this.  Instead I will cut to the chase and share some thoughts on \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\".  This disc is HEAVY!  It's like \\"Woman and Children First\\" and \\"Fair Warning\\" meets \\"Me Wise Magic\\".  It's basically everything I had hoped for and beyond that even.  Everyone (Eddie, Wolf, Al and Dave) sounds top notch.  Not only do you hear every note but you feel every note because every note kicks you in your ass.  Every song on here is drenched with chunky chords, killer hooks and more UMFFF than most can handle which is why I love it and have always been a huge VH fan.  This release is the BEST thing to happen to the music industry (Hard Rock and Metal in particular)in 10, 12 maybe 20 years.  \\"ADKT\\" picks right up where \\"Me Wise Magic\\" and \\"Can't Get This Stuff No More\\" left off with a lot of early '80s classic VH influence.  Also, there are little to no Keyboards played on this release.  But Van Halen as usual overwhelms and over delivers on all fronts and SMASHES ALL EXPECTATIONS!!!  Buy it! Tell a friend to rush out and buy/order it!  VAN HALEN FOREVER!!!

B005LAIGOQ|5.0|You have to be in the mood for a good, authentically creepy ghost story to fully enjoy the quiet chills of THE WOMAN IN BLACK. It's only after the story ended that I realized I'd been taken by something I should have seen from the beginning. At any rate, the ending did come as a twist for me--but in view of all the preceding events, it was indeed foreshadowed by information given about the title character.<br /><br />Daniel Radcliffe has to carry the weight of most of the film on his own shoulders and he does a very strong and satisfying job as a young lawyer whose firm sends him on a mission to a remote village accessible only when the tide is low enough to permit horse and carriage to enter. The story depends on the musty atmosphere of a decaying mansion full of shopworn dolls that seem to come to life in a nursery where three girls met their fate years ago.<br /><br />Radcliffe's only friendly neighbor is Ciaran Hinds, who helps him get to the root of the troubled village and the death of numerous young children. The extremes to which Radcliffe is willing to go (as in the marsh scene where he recovers a dead boy's body) are improbable, to say the least, but so graphically enacted that you have to believe it. It's one of the most suspenseful moments in the story. Radcliffe is willing to recover the corpse to give it a proper burial next to the mother, whose spirit is evidently haunting the old mansion.<br /><br />The surprise ending fits the story but came as quite a shock to me, although with hindsight I can see that there was some preparation for it if you paid close attention to the script.<br /><br />For lovers of Gothic tales full of mist, suspicion, brooding townspeople and dangerous marshlands, THE WOMAN IN BLACK is your ticket. Good production values are in abundant evidence. Hammer is certainly making a good comeback in the horror genre with this delicious ghost story. Fine cinematography is another big asset.<br /><br />Radcliffe makes expressive use of his penetrating blue eyes framed by bushy brows that confirm his qualification for more adult roles in his future.at confirm his qualification for more adult roles in his future.
0679745203|5.0|When a book has won the Booker Prize and the film that it spawned has taken Oscars, the casual reviewer might be tempted to conclude that everything has already been said on its subject. Having just revisited the film after several years of absence, I decided to re-read the book. I don't remember how many times I have read it now: let's call it several. I have seen the film at least six times.<br /><br />First let it be said that the film, The English Patient, claims only to be based on Michael Ondaatje's book. It is a film from the book, not of the book. The distinction is crucial because, despite the film's admirable attempt to recreate the complexity of part of the novel, the book always went much further.<br /><br />In the book we have characters who have been scarred by war, by a war that none of them particularly wanted to fight. I suppose there are occasional wars where some of the participants want to be active. But here Caravaggio just wanted to stay a thief and thus keep his thumbs. And who would take over thieving if he is drafted to fight? Perhaps Hana's father really did intend to see out the conflict and restart his previous life. Perhaps the English Patient, himself, did really want to be English. I doubt it. Or perhaps the idea, that of nationality, given war, was mere irrelevance. It was sides that people counted. He certainly had much to hide, but from whom? What does it matter what side you claim to be on when it is only ever the innocent who fall victim? This last point is crucial to the feelings of Kip, the character who only just makes it into the film.<br /><br />For in the book this Sikh sapper, this bomb disposal specialist, who risks his own life to protect others, is a complex anti-colonial thinker. He has a sense of justice that transcends victory, especially when that victory is won at tremendous cost in the lives of those who did not fight. This aspect the film makers largely ignored. His character became a suspiciously like an aspect of the noble savage that remains gratefully unthreatening to colonialism. In the book his standpoint is far more radical than this.<br /><br />And as far as Almasy is concerned, if that really was his name, he eventually worked for those people who would accept him at face value, without a racism that was suspected. On the other hand, he was Hungarian, and in that war the nation was sympathetic to fascism. So did he merely support his own country's line? Whom would you believe? Whose motives are honest?<br /><br />Almasy's love for the wife of a British war-monger was undoubtedly sincere, but at the same time obsessive. Might it have burned out if given the freedom to flame? And did Katharine know of her husband's contribution to war? If not, who was betrayed? In the film it is unclear that it took Almasy three years to return to the Cave of the Swimmers, and also spent much of the intervening time doing significantly more than merely handing over maps. Such is life in war. In film, it's the gloss that counts.<br /><br />In The English Patient, Michael Ondaatje's book, we are never clear about motives. These change whilst apparently remaining both consistent and sincere, despite remaining unknown, often unstated. There is continued life after the conflict ends, albeit utterly transformed, still dangerous, and then there is death which, for some seems the preferable option. There are principles, and these are largely underpinned by pragmatism. Above all there are actions and reactions. Ask any fuse. It might just blow you away from what you are. Light the blue touch-paper and stand back, well back.s gratefully unthreatening to colonialism. In the book his standpoint is far more radical than this.

0062082353|5.0|I used to read all the time when I was younger but with having to read a lot at work it seemed more like a chore. I want to thank Chris Kyle for changing all that. This was written as if Chris is your buddy and your tagging a long for the ride. An easy read that I had trouble putting down. A glimps inside the mind of a warrior and the mindset it takes to survive in battle. He talks about weapons,gear and tactics. He uses military terms and takes the time to explain what the terms mean. It's also very funny at times. Dude has a sense of humor. I laughed for 10 mins out loud when he was describing the birth of his first kid. I highly recommend this book. It started me reading again.

Of course, many of the simple aspects of how to behave well in a relationship aren't rocket science, which is why we need books like \\"the Five Love Languages\\" to be written.  We need them to be written because we couldn't figure out the simplicity of our relationship's health or brokenness without a guide.  Dr. Chapman's book is such a guide.<br /><br />The Five Love Languages isn't going to bowl anyone over with deep descriptive analysis of the human psyche.  It isn't even going to seem to the average reader to be a very artfully crafted book.  But that isn't to say that the simple message of the book \\"mind how you show and receive tokens of love\\", isn't important.  It is, almost biologically so.<br /><br />In order to eat, you do not need to know the specifics of calories and nutritional value.  Those things are helpful, but most people can get by with simple rules like \\"one protein, one starch, one vegetable,\\" or the food pyramid.  Dr. Chapman's book is the simple approach to a subject that can get complex in a hurry - how we love one another.<br /><br />I would recommend this quick read to any new or old couple to get a better grasp on how they might make each other more happy, and by doing so, live out the true beauty of having a relationship - making your \\"love languages\\" talk to each other.
B004EBZX6W|4.0|When traveling this app has been invaluable.  Helps to see how many wifi signals are  in my neighborhood and which neighbor is \\"wifing\\".  Also which wifi network is the strongest in my home.
B004JZBGWI|3.0|I use this ap on my phone and love it! It would prolly be great on my Fire, too, but it keeps saying I need a credit card. WTH. :(((((
B006P0FD4W|5.0|I see there a lot of love or hate reviews for the movie.  My suggestion is to just rent it (available now at libraries and redboxes).  Here are my two cents:  I personally enjoyed the movie more than the previous iterations because it was scarier, made connections with the previous releases, and wasn't the same ol' same ol'.  For instance, I thought that the camera mounted to a makeshift oscillating fan was genius as it was a unique way of building suspense.  The movie did deviate a little in \\"style\\" from the previous movies especially towards the end, but I don't think it took anything away.  In fact, if they had made this movie more like the first two, it would've felt like more of the same thing.
B004XNGKBS|3.0|This is the best note taking app I've found for the kindle fire - and I search often.  I am still infinitely jealous during meetings when my ipad touting coworkers jot away on 'Notability'.  If only Mr Ben Lee could find a way to:  1.) get that auto shifting box that moves the screen over once I write in it, thus allowing smooth long-winded notes w/out a pause.  Meetings don't slow down to my app speed.  2.) Incorporate a folder structure - tags just aren't what I'm used to and don't fit well in a hierarchy.  3.) An undo that operates per stroke...sometimes I mess up 6 words into a sentence and there's no mercy.
B0061QD82E|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in so many years and this movie brings back so many great memories.  First off I was totally taken back by how amazing the quality was on the Blu-ray disc - it definitely did not look like a movie from 1955!  My 5 year old who does not like dogs actually fought with me about watching this movie so I told him to go play in the other room and that me and his little brother would watch it.  Both boys ended up so into the movie that we watched it twice in a row!  They thought the dogs were so funny!  At just over an hour it is also perfect for kids attention span.  We haven't watched all the special features yet but there is a lot to choose from.  This is a wonderful movie to add to any Disney collection and I am glad we were able to grab it before it goes back in the Disney vault!
B005ELZKWS|1.0|Just got done listening to \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\"...quite simply, the new VH blows this album away. This not even comparable.  The main reason is because of the awful lyrics, once again Hagar pumps out childish, repetitive and quite boring lyrics.  Sorry pal, comparing yourself to Zeppelin was just foolish, doesn't surprise me though, you have always been full of hot air.  The band that has \\"raised the bar\\" is the mighty Van Halen.  This is dreadfully awful, a complete failure.
B0034G4OR2|5.0|This movie was so much fun to watch with my 2 children! My autistic son absolutely LOVED the movie!! Arthur Christmas was well written and very well presented to the audience. Only problem I have is that my son has been asking for the DVD since November! :) When will it come out!!??? Enjoy the movie families!!

0307454541|2.0|Plodding.  This is the main word I would use to describe The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.  I found myself skimming through page after page of exposition involving the financial dealings of the Vagner clan, hoping to get to something more interesting.  While there are a few moments of suspense in the novel (the Harriet plotline is intriguing, though wraps up strangely), the characters are flat and the prose is embarrassingly trite and riddled with clich&eacute;s.  \\"Her eyes were as black as coal\\" is one of many gems utilized by the author and though it's a translation, it doesn't excuse the overall lack of imagination.  A book about men who hate women (the original title, apparently), punctuated by real-world statistics about the frequency of violence against women in Sweden.  I suppose the author felt he was being edgy by including graphic depictions of sexual violence toward the women in his book, and by introducing his audience to an improbably evil villain who loves to hunt women and chain them up in his basement, seemingly with no remorse.  Really, though--is this surprising or notable?  Fiction is filled with far more complex villains and heroines who challenge our assumptions about the nature of good and evil.  I really wanted to like this book, but unfortunately found it flawed, boring, and amateurish.
B006UG90RM|5.0|The Facts:  1. I am a diehard classic (first 6 albums) Van Halen fan  2. I also liked the Van Haggar years and saw them in concert twice during this time(OU812 and For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge tours). A different band with Sammy at the helm - but still a great show and rock solid music.  3. Never even bothered to pick up VH III with the Extreme Lead Singer.  4. I dig ChickenFoot and have both their CD's as well. Just rock solid \\"rock n' roll\\" music - will see them next time they come through on tour as well.  I had HUGE reservations going into this CD. The Tattoo single pre-release made me really nervous. Not a hideous song (and one that has the hook stay with you for days actually), but it did not fill me with confidence. I picked up the CD today (not the Deluxe version with the extra DVD - just the basic CD version with the 13 songs). I figured with all the good times and great listening Van Halen provided me over the years, a $9.99 investment to keep my CD collection of them up to date (no VH III mind you) was warranted. Plus we are seeing them live this spring so I figured I better at least familiarize myself with the top 3-4 songs off this CD that they would most likely play in concert.  Finished the CD and am STUNNED with how awesome it is. Maybe it was the super low expectations going in, but I am just tickled pink with how fun this CD is and how it really does capture the classic Van Halen Magic. DLR sounds great and Eddie just TEARS THE HOUSE DOWN with his guitar riffs. Great drumming and the bass is rock solid as well. The Tattoo song is actually the weakest song on the ablum most likely. I did read that Eddie has 10 albums worth of un-released pre-Sammy material in the vaults. I also read that this entire album is simply reworked stuff from Eddie's vaualt. You know what? I do not even care - it is just such a great CD that I do not care where it came from - just that it is now on CD with David Lee Roth fronting the band again.  Would I prefer it if Michael Anthony was in the band and this was a true reunion? Heck ya! But last time I checked, I do not control that nor do I have a say in that. So I am simply enjoying the CD for what it is - a great CD that actually puts a big smile on my face. It is not all \\"the world is bad, lets get mad\\", \\"I am depressed and angry\\" or \\"lets save the world with Bono and U2\\" music with a political message - just fun classic rock that takes me back to a simpler time with the Mighty Van Halen back in action...  I cannot wait to see them in the spring!  I hope this review helps people on the fence. Come on folks, I look at it this way: it is ten bucks for some great music from a band that we all grew up listening to. How can ya beat that deal in this day and age?
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is actually a pretty decent app it allows for fun and much much more great for children and definitely travel awesome awesome app

B005HED5YW|5.0|When I first started watching these I thought: \\"Wow, the Enterprise and the planets in the cut scenes really look great in HD.  I didn't realize how much I was missing in SD\\"  Then came the \\"Galileo 7\\" episode and when I saw the shuttle craft launch and the pulsar star, I realized that all of the cut scenes, the viewing screen content and other scenes not involving actors have all been redone with modern special effects and computer enhancements.  What a great job they did! the upgrade to the scenes really gives this 40 year old series a nice facelift!  Very well done.  I am enjoying re-watching these episodes from my childhood.

B003L77G6A|5.0|Love this show. I was having surgery so I wanted something to watch. All the laughing made the pain go away. The DVD arrived in great time and great condition
B004LWZW4M|5.0|The emotional impact of this film took me by complete surprise! I was expecting action and a few thrills, but what you get instead (which is much better) is a slow-building suspense that lands several spine-tingling punches along the way till it reaches its climax. The most astounded thing about this movie is the emotion that Caesar conveys without a single word... and then when he does speak... it sent SHIVERS DOWN MY SPINE! This is more than a Hollywood action movie. It's one of the best films of the year!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed the novel and found the narrative style most engaging. The voices of the main characters added to the interest in the text. Amusing, thought-provoking and memorable. The adaptation to film was equally well achieved.
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|First, the little problem is having to change discs halfway through. The movie being on two separate discs allow the film to have a much better audio and visual quality, but its still a bummer ha ha. AND the major problem is that a CUT version of this film exists, because its so much LESS. Basically if you have seen the directors cut, its hard to stomach the theatrical release. *blows raspberry*  Obviously i loved the film, great acting, great effects, and great settings. Great a lot of things. Yes there were historical inaccuracies, but i watch movies specifically because i want to see something that isn't real life, and those facts are addressed by the special features. the director and writer wanted a thrilling story that gets and keeps your attention, and i am glad they took the creative license because it is exactly thee movie i want it to be. i hope you enjoyed t too. :)
B006LR0XLM|5.0|One of the few apps it would definitely be difficult to live without.  First, let's clear the air.  Dropbox is a syncing program.  It is not primarily cloud storage or a file sharing service.  It has those features, too, but that's not its main purpose.  Dropbox is the best syncing program out there, bar none.  There are other programs that appear to do the same thing (box, SafeSync,...) but, as of the time of this review, none of them can measure up to Dropbox--some because they are designed more for file sharing than syncing, others because they simply don't perform as well.  Dropbox will sync all of your devices, automatically.  Copy something into your dropbox folder on one device and it appear on your other devices, too.  * On PCs, the file is physically copied to the hard drive.  * With the Android app, a link appears in the Dropbox folder.  The file is downloaded only if you click on the link.  This is to avoid filling up the limited storage in most Android devices.  Surprise!  The latest beta version of Dropbox has an automatic Camera Upload feature. It's beta, meaning you have to visit the Dropbox website to get it and there are some kinks to be worked out.  However, what it does...take a picture or a video and it's AUTOMATICALLY added to your Dropbox.  How much easier can file transfer get?
B006OOHYIC|2.0|good game, but very annoying when you pass levels, that they don't stay &quot;passed&quot; when you turn game off and then go back to play again assuming that you could just start right back up where you left off, but nope.  You have to start back at level one. so its basically like I only have about a dozen levels to rotate through, because that's all I would ever have time to play at one time. needs to be fixed.
0307957934|1.0|After reading the well-crafted and engaging book Enigma by Robert Harris, I expected something similar from the Fear Index.  Quite the contrary.  I found the plot contrived, the characters poorly developed, the themes stereotypical.  Like another reviewer, I started and stopped this book several times, hoping for the best.  It was not forthcoming.  This is not the same writer who created Enigma.  (Actually, could this have been ghost written by someone else?)
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I love really, really good TV. I only watch shows or movies if I have found them to be or believe they will be fantastic. The best show I've ever seen is LOST, and when it ended I never thought anything would fill the gap left by it. Game of Thrones has done that, and more. I never even knew the books existed before this show. It's absolutely beautiful, the acting is incredible, and it follows the books very well. I don't even have a Blu-ray player yet, but I'm getting this!!
B005VTGB0S|4.0|I have the Basic Folio for my Kindle Fire which has worked out great for close to three months. It shows no signs of wear, scuff marks, anything. I love how it feels, how I can stand up my Kindle. I prefer the soft elastic that holds the Kindle. It feels sturdy. For the Kindle it is perfect.<br /><br />This one for the iPad is not perfect. It is flimsy compared to the one I have for the Kindle. I have no idea why there is velcro on the elastic that holds the iPad in place. But it looks good, feels good, protects your iPad and is not bulky.<br /><br />It does what it is intended to do for a decent price, just not perfect.
B003ZTQN1I|5.0|I enjoyed the movie and I really enjoy the soundtrack. I think it has some great songs and I recommend it to anyone who likes country or not. My fiance and I listen to this soundtrack all of the time. I even got him into country music now.
B0071T5PN0|2.0|How in the world is this getting so many 5 stars?  *The production stinks. I don't think I've ever heard anything quite like this disc. How they made EVERY instrument equally inaudible and in-distinctive at once is truly amazing. Somehow Van Halen has lost any sort of identity here, and I feel what they need is a good producer to sort this mess out, and that's just for a start. I suppose Wolfgang is a decent bassist but does that really make a group? Several people playing \\"adequately\\"? To me there is a sort of magic that happens when you hear a band really clicking - sadly you won't here that here. Dave's voice. While I know he's older (as we all are) just sounds like it has no bite and is blown out, almost hoarse; the throw away song \\"Outta Space\\" is bad, but Dave somehow makes it worse.  *The songs are a problem. There are generally no hooks. That's probably the biggest issue here. They simply do not flow whatsoever. So many of these are from demo's that Ted Templeton tossed out. You can only rework an unimaginative melody with so many words, so many times. \\"She's the Woman\\" I would say fares the best, but even that pales in comparison to their previous works like \\"Romeo Delight\\" and \\"Hang em High\\". There is NOTHING about this disc that is remotely spontaneous or feels organic.. in fact it really doesn't even sound like Van Halen.. to a degree it just sounds like DLR with any faceless band as back up.  I bought this today at Best Buy and I'm not even going to put this on my iPod. I heard many of these on YouTube before buying but I thought if I heard them on my real stereo, with the lyrics and my nice headphones things would be different, sadly they are, they are even worse.

0316067938|5.0|I have been waiting for Bella to be turned into a vampire and finally with Braking Dawn she does and she becomes pregnant too! While I am reading, I am so worried about Bella with her pregnancy. Bella is the ultimate mother figure. She would die to save her child.  I had so much empathy for Edward. I fell in love with the Quileute Wolves too! I could not put this book down. It's a thick book and I read it in 5 days. I will certainly be re-reading this book. I like books that I can keep and read again.  This is one of those that I would love to read again.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This is a great product!  It is very sturdy and well made. I have seen complaints in other reviews about it being thin, but that is one of the things I love about it.  This cover is not bulky but will protect your Kindle Fire as well as a bulky cover would.  It also fits snugly, so there is no worry about it coming loose.  I would highly recommend this product.. LOVE IT!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|nice assortment of games.  wish I didn't have to earn so many points to open new games, but that's because I'm not that good yet.
B004EPZ0AC|1.0|I've never ever feel like a total fool for purchasing tickets to watch a movie ever in my life before... But that was exactly the feeling I had when I watched this with my niece. Personally I wouldn't write a review on a movie where my niece was the one picking out the flick to be seen, but to be told personally from a 7 year old that she \\"really really want to go\\" after 30min into the movie, just blew my mind away. A movie that's aimed for youngsters, and to be told she's bored out of her mind, which I personally agree, was all I needed to leave the theater with her.
886293713X|5.0|This planner is the perfect size for putting in your purse, briefcase, or desk drawer without being obnoxiously large or too tiny to find. The weekly pages allow ample space in planning details in addition to the monthly pages for a quick overview.<br /><br />For those who are organizationally challenged, a set about 100 the little appointment stickers are a real bonus as I have found they really help you stay motivated in updating and actually using your planner!<br /><br />In addition, the elastic band is a huge plus which allows you to tuck all your extra little cards, notes, and receipts inside without having them scattering all over the place when you are on-the-go.<br /><br />The quality is fantastic, which you will definitely appreciate by the end of the year and is a great buy especially since this is something that you only really buy once a year.<br /><br />This item also is a great gift idea for anybody who you know likes to stay organized, or needs some more organization in their life!
0920668372|5.0|Robert Munsch has created several masterpieces, but this one is by far the most memorable one for me.  I am fairly new to this, and I think that if I had received it as a new mother, I would have sang the little song to my babies every single night.  It turns out, though, that there was no need because we have our own little special something either way! :)  Anyway, my youngest daughter has checked this book out from the library periodically since she was in Kindergarten and first came across it.  Every single time I read this to my children, I cry.  It is a beautiful story of the lasting bond between a parent and their child.  And it reminds me both of how quickly time passes, and how precious it is.
B000Q7ZND6|4.0|Interesting story with many well acted parts. The pacing is energetic and the special effects are quite good (taken in context of the times).

1596062754|5.0|In The Last Colony, readers of Scalzi's Old Man's War series become re-acquainted with John Perry.  The widower Perry, now with his new wife - herself formerly of Special Forces - and their adopted daughter Zoe live on an human colony when they receive a very surprising offer from the CDF (Colonial Defense Forces):  Become the leaders of a new colony.  But - it turns out - there's a lot more to the CDF's request than meets the eye.  Last Colony is the most political of Scalzi's books in this series and explores the wisdom - or lack thereof - of CDF policy.  We also learn quite a bit more about The Conclave, perceived to be the CDF's greatest enemy.  Scalzi tells a fascinating tale combining both small town and inter-galactic politics, in addition to family dynamics.  Highly recommended.
030726999X|5.0|I couldn't wait to read the final book in the series. What a great, and gripping story. I couldn't put it down.  One of the best series I've read in a long time.  I would definitely  recommend this book and the other two books in the series.

B006NZU9UC|1.0|this is a review of the reprinted hardcover version.  i purchased this book having read a friends copy. upon receiving my copy i was bitterly disappointed. the layout is atrocious. the reproduction and re-sizing of the photos substandard and the text is misaligned. it looked as though an eight year old had printed it on a home computer. this for AUS$80.  random house should be ashamed of themselves.
B005ZTFPFQ|2.0|I purchased the 100 pack for $10.00.  There were several reasons for this, I still love to play centipede and millipede whenever I go somewhere that has them, my nephew likes to play games on my Kindle Fire and my mother loves my Fire, the two above mentioned games and when she bought us an Atari system as kids she played with it more than she let us play with it.<br />I would really love to give it higher marks but the controls are very stuttery.  I've been playing for a few weeks and have had others try it.  On the 'pedes' no matter how I set the sensitivity or controls the movement doesn't follow what I am trying to get my guy to do.  The fire button also has started to go out at times.  Very frustrating!  The screaming loud 'music' noise on centipede that drowns out the games sounds is also annoying.  If not for these issues I would probably play this incessantly.<br />Any near future plans for updates or fixes for the Kindle Fire version?
B006UG90RM|2.0|Well what can I say I was expecting more. I can say this album, I didnt expect it to blow my socks off but just maybe the shoes!! This album is all over the place not a really good vibe but not a bad one either. I spent my money on it today got the 2 cd verision all in all a good cd out of a 10, its about a 6!!! Yes 6!! Now in saying that I bought my tickets early to see them in Denver I just hope they play alot of the ols stuff!!! I wish these bands would just quit trying to be somthing they are not quit trying to re invent the wheel guys!!!! We just want to hear the old stuff type of sound and writing. It would of been cool if they would of made an album like women and children first part two!! or somthing Well thats my review I will always be a Van Halen fan for sure. Go out and but it people could be wourse you could spend your money on LMAFO CD those guys need to be tied to a rock and thrown over a river!! And just to sound off to Ozzy really Gus G over Zakk nice move  DORK!!!!  Should of Put Sammy back on the job I agree with you Sammy waited this long for this?  Like the Metallica Saint Anger Album 1.bought it 2. listened to it. 3 Threw it in the trash!!!
0307959856|3.0|With each acquisition of new books I take the one I'm least likely to \\"love\\" or which is overly long and work back to the one I expect will be my favorite. With this one the reviews have not been great. Notwithstanding I finally decided to read it almost out of loyalty. I was, in the final analysis, not only relieved but nearly ecstatic. As you may be aware James is the Grande Dame of mystery or Crime Fiction having won all the right awards and over a career spanning 50 years has provided us with not only good sensible plots and story lines but some of the classiest writing in the genre. My concern here was two fold: 1) She turned 91 this past year, and 2) She submerged an excellent story into a well known literary standard with apologies.  Her age was only a concern because I anticipated that this was a bit of a last hurrah with the fingerprints of a publisher smeared somewhere in the shuffle. I was wrong and after hearing an interview wherein her usual lucidity was on display I took the plunge. On display in her writing is the lyrical Brit language structure we colonists have an appetite for which would make this a pleasure to read even if it had been a recipe for the correct sauce (Bordelaise?) to serve with beef Wellington. You can enjoy that aspect for its own sake.  On the second point let me say that you do not have to read Pride and Prejudice (Austen) first to enjoy and love this offering but while it wouldn't hurt to do so those of you familiar with the story and characters will be glad you did if only because you will feel that you have the secret of the decoder ring. It is unnecessary to say that Pemberley is the Darcy estate which may or may not have been Chatsworth.  The timeframe of the novel is over 200 years ago and hence the usual detective conduct and forensic style investigations have yet to be invented. The methodology however is quite explicit and the members of the \\"upper crust\\" have the approach down pat when it comes to how the matter of murder (if it is murder) must be handled. And of course the trial, abbreviated by our standards, and tweaked down the centuries is surprising in both its speed and brevity. The death of the gentleman occurs just as the main house prepares for a proper Ball and therefore a standard of the old murder mystery where there is a plethora of potential suspects comes into play. This however is not Ten Little Indians. This is a well written, high minded, reasoned and consistently portrayed tale told in alternate (character) straight-line chronology. When matters and conduct come to light you always nod. There aren't any \\"no way\\"s in James' writing. The only untoward criticism might be a little too much \\"wrapping up\\" for my taste. There are a couple sub plots where I might have preferred a little more information but that is pure curiosity and inessential. After all the book is only 300 pages. Despite this, character development is complete, if perhaps subliminal, and the juggling of preexisting personalities to fit the action is expert.  This book is very enjoyable, properly paced and would be ideal for committed book clubs. 3.25* GIBO
0061784788|5.0|Geology, anthropology, nanotechnology.  Utah, Colorado, Yellowstone, Iceland.  Native American history, Thomas Jefferson, Jewish settlers, Mormons.<br /><br />Rollins pulls all this science and history into a fast-paced thriller with many strong and interesting characters.<br /><br />My only complaint, which applies to many modern thrillers, is the number of guns, the number of bullets fired, and the number of people killed by gunfire.  Way more than necessary to the plot.<br /><br />Recommendation:  Read this book when you have time to read it straight through.
B002T44ZYW|5.0|Just got this book yesterday.. already 100 pages in and that was between watching a movie last night. I read before and after till I fell asleep. I don't think you needed to be a hills fan to enjoy this book although it relates to the hills characters its obvious that its not exactly how it played out on TV... cant wait to finish reading it and then i have already purchased sweet little lies and cant wait to read it as well.!!

B000AA4JMU|4.0|I bought this Oliver musical combo because my kids and I were rehearsing for the musical. The sound track does not cover all the key songs (1 I was suppose to sing), which was a bummer (Bill Sikes - Strong Men...). Other than that it was a good investment in a classic.

B0009P5YXO|5.0|I have to say getting a sonic screwdriver I was a tad apprehensive about purchasing it. I saw all the rather negative review about durability, loosing the nibs, battery issues and what not. It put me off but I figured those were small things in comparison with (and yes this is a geek moment for me, a girl who also owns a wizard wand from Harry Potter World) how cool it looked.  When it arrived I had no trouble inserting the batteries, though you do need a rather small screwdriver head to accomplish the task (that was the hard part). The thing went back together quite easily. I also found that sliding the screwdriver up into it's second position was a little stiff at first but now that I've played with it a bit (aka like 100,000 times) it goes up easily. As to the durability question it is rather durable, thought it must be noted to have the nibs pushed completely in place and their caps securely on tight otherwise you do risk a chance of loosing them.  Now on to the fun stuff. It is most satisfying to point the thing and hear the noise, which is exactly like the tv show. It is a great prop and fun to wave around. I have shown it to my friends who are Dr. Who fans and they also had a good time playing around with it. The same in fact goes for my friends who are not Dr. Who fans, though I did have to spend some time explaining what it was to them. But they know I've been on a Dr. Who kick for awhile and also know I am into that sort of thing. Once they found out about the UV nib they were very excited to try it out.  All in all it was a good purchase. It will take some time to see how durable the thing really is. I hope though I will be sonicing for a long time to come. It is for certain though that more Dr. Who products will be on my Birthday/Christmas lists when the time comes. I am most definitely looking at the Eleventh Doctor's screwdriver for purchase in the future, though perhaps not the near one :)
B0031Q0XCA|4.0|The proverb says \\"perception is reality,\\" but if that's the case we're all living in a world of our own. By way of a repeatedly time-hopping narrative, this film addresses the competing perspectives present in every long-term relationship, and how something as innocuous as a smile can be interpreted completely differently by the two people sharing it. With a ton of post-production tricks and stunts in editing, it runs the risk of being over-conceptual and spoiled, but by keeping a steady focus on that one central point that all winds up complimenting the message nicely. Zooey Deschanel plays her typical hip, quirky character (if you're not already a fan of her act, she won't convince you here) and her pairing with Joseph Gordon-Levitt feels fun and natural while it lasts. Both characters are thoroughly rounded, with neither taking all the blame for their relationship's trials and tribulations - a rarity for directorial confessionals - and they're accompanied along the way by a dynamite soundtrack.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have read all of Mr. Sparks' novels and loved every one for different reasons.  His descriptions are clear, his characters are life-like and the situations they find themselves in often make me hold my breath.  The paranormal events in THE BEST OF ME were integral to the story and not all that farfetched.  I've had my own experiences...enough to learn that there IS more out there than what we can see or feel.  For folks who are open to the hope and belief that our loved ones still reach out and help us, even after life, you may love this story as much as I did.  (I am 56 year old grandmother, wife, mother and business owner.)<br /><br />The end was (to me) predictable, but isn't that what we think when we project ahead to how something 'should be'?  THE BEST OF ME was a love-filled, rocky, angst-touched story with a painful but perfect ending.<br /><br />Read it.  Decide for yourself!

0385344228|5.0|The buzz on this thriller started nearly a year before the novel was published.  I heard it from so many sources, that it was hard not to believe the hype--which is usually the kiss of death for any book.  What can live up to all that?  Happily, Defending Jacob held up well to the hype.  In the end, it's just a great page-turner, but it was as entertaining as promised.<br /><br />The novel has a framing device.  It opens with a transcript of grand jury testimony between assistant district attorney, Neal Logiudice, and his former colleague, Andy Barber. The transcript reappears all throughout the novel.  Readers quickly learn that Andy also used to work in the DA's office until a case that was tried a year prior.  The case involved the murder of a 14-year-old boy in the town Andy and his family lived in, peaceful, upscale, Newton, MA.  In fact, the victim went to the same junior high school as Andy's son, Jacob.  It is this fact that proves to be Andy's undoing.  As he directs the investigation as the ADA on the case, the crime starts to hit far too close to home, with dire consequences.<br /><br />Framing devices can be incredibly lame.  Here, however, it's used to great effect.  In addition to the transcript's handiness for plot exposition, Landay does a fine job of highlighting the character of these two adversaries through their back and forth.  But more than anything, the deeper I got into the novel, as the two men recounted the investigation and trial that had occurred a year prior, all I could think was:  Why are they rehashing this now?  This after-the-fact conversation ratchets up tension throughout the novel.<br /><br />The author has created an appealing narrator in the form of Andy Barber, and I felt for the hellish situation he and his family found themselves in.  Generally, all of the characters were well-drawn and nuanced.  Landry's use of language was just a bit more interesting than what you see in the typical thriller, describing a news van, for instance, as being \\"barnacled\\" with dishes, boxes, and antennae.  And he can write a nice speech, too, such as this soliloquy from Andy:<br /><br />\\"I do not believe in the court system, at least I do not think it's especially good at finding the truth.  No lawyer does.  We have all seen too many mistakes, too many bad results.  A jury verdict is just a guess--a well-intentioned guess, generally, but you simply cannot tell fact from fiction by taking a vote.  And yet, despite all that, I do believe in the power of the ritual.  I believe in the religious symbolism, the black robes, the marble-columned courthouses like Greek temples.  When we hold a trial, we are saying a mass.  We are praying together to do what is right and to be protected from danger, and that is worth doing whether our prayers are actually heard.\\"<br /><br />In the end, however, thrillers are mostly about plotting and pacing, and on those two counts Mr. Landay shines.  This is one nail-biter of a murder mystery/legal thriller.  And, OMG, what a powerhouse ending!  Eat your heart out, John Grisham!th dishes, boxes, and antennae.

Don't get me wrong, I don't hate \\"Tattoo\\", but it certainly isn't the best track here. Every last one of these songs are great. Stand out tracks include \\"As Is\\", \\"Stay Frosty\\", \\"Beats Workin'\\", \\"She's The Woman\\", \\"Big River\\". BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!
B002N8A14M|5.0|This one fits the I Pod Nano and allows for use of ALL the buttons, unlike several others that require removal from the case to change settings All buttons are accessible and the wheel is left free and not covered. Thus, the wheel is easy to manipulate and change settings on. One concern is that certain earphones, like Yurbuds, have a thicker that usual plug in section and the plastic case prevents the plug in from  going fully in.  I tried two different other earphones brands and they fit perfectly well.

B002ZCY7SW|3.0|Everyone knows this series is like potato chips: You know they're complete junk and bad for you, but once you start eating them you just can't stop.  This season doubles down on all the elements you are familiar with from the other seasons, becoming almost a satire of itself.  - Everyone breathlessly delivering their lines.  - Absurdly improbable coincidences.  - High-tech, highly secure CTU headquarters that seems to be easier for bad guys to penetrate than an old folk's home. (There's always a traitor in a trusted position. Always.)  - Legions of bad guys coming out of nowhere to immediately plan and launch highly complex and well-orchestrated assaults within minutes of the latest plot twist.  - Chloe pouting and huffing and delivering her lines like she's reading them off a page.  - Key data hustled around on various kinds of memory cards, with all characters just happening to have whatever fancy-smancy device available for reading the data when the plot calls for it.  - Cars with the keys carelessly left in the ignition whenever a quick getaway is required.  - Someone yelling \\"Jack Bauer!\\" at least every two minutes.  - Magic computer systems that can bring up the floor plan of any building, tap into any video monitoring system, tap any telephone, bring aerial or satellite video to bear on any location -- within minutes of the plot calling for it.  - Pervasive technobabble.  Oh, and Jack. Pointing your gun in everyone's face and yelling.  In this season -- all within the span of 24 hours, of course -- you got stabbed in the stomach. Pumped full of drugs and brutally tortured. Shot in the shoulder. Knocked unconscious at least twice that I can remember, slugged in the face more times than I could count. Stabbed in the stomach *again*. And shot through the chest. And each time back on your feet whuppin' ass within minutes.  It's a big bag of potato chips. Greasy, empty calories that you love eating and then feel guilty about after. But while you're indulging, it sure is fun.

The acting is excellent (btw Tom Hardy is British but he does the US accent so well you would never know). Nick Nolte is nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar, and I think he deserves it. I have watched some scenes in this movie over and over, it is that good!!! Now I actually appreciate MMA, and see it as a sport that requires tremendous discipline, intelligence, and athletic prowess. Yay, I loved this movie.

B006UG90RM|5.0|Ok.  I bought this album because i thought Tatoo was 'ok' but not great.  I think it may be the worst song on the album, and it is still awesome.  For some reason, it sounds better than what i heard on the video on youtube.  I don't know if it was remixed or just higher quality, but it sounds better.  The audio quality is very well done and the music was amazing.  Worth the wait!  Be sure to listen to the album with some decent quality headphones, or you will miss just how good this album was mixed.
1596064331|4.0|Neal Stephenson's Cryptonomicon is a lengthy historical fiction set during both World War II and the late 1990s with much of the action taking place in the Philippines. In the 1940s, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, colleague of Alan Turing, is hired by the U.S. Navy to help break Axis codes. Meanwhile, Marine Sergeant Bobby Shaftoe, who's too enthusiastic and courageous for his own good, doesn't realize that his troop's job is to make it look like the U.S. hasn't broken the codes, but just happens to always be in the right place at the right time.<br /><br />Waterhouse and Shaftoe know each other only superficially, but their descendants, who've noticeably inherited some of their traits, meet in the 1990s storyline. Randy Lawrence Waterhouse is a systems administrator who's trying to set up an electronic banking system in the Philippines. There he meets Doug and Amy Shaftoe, a father and daughter team who are doing the underwater surveying for Randy's Internet cables. Randy and the Shaftoes eventually realize that they share a secret heritage and together they set out on a massive code-breaking treasure hunt.<br /><br />The plot of Cryptonomicon is clever and elaborate, sometimes exciting (e.g., most scenes with Bobby Shaftoe), frequently funny (such as when Ronald Reagan interviews Bobby Shaftoe, and when the Waterhouse family uses a complicated mathematical algorithm to divide up the family heirlooms), and always informative.<br /><br />Neal Stephenson's fans know (and love) that you can't read one of his books without learning a lot. Predictably, Cryptonomicon is chock full of information. If a character walks past a bank in China, you can bet you're in for a lecture on Chinese banking. If he sees a spider web dripping with dew, you'll be taught how spiders catch their prey. Character backstories are used to teach us about the history of the Jews in Eastern Europe or the familial habits of the Filipinos. In Cryptonomicon there are many pages that think they should be in a textbook on computer circuitry (and some that actually admit they belong in Letters to Penthouse). There are three pages devoted to a doctoral dissertation on facial hair and shaving fetishes, and another three pages of instruction on the proper way to eat Cap'n Crunch.<br /><br />These divergences interrupt the plot and make the book much longer than it needs to be, but you just can't help but forgive Stephenson (or to at least smile and shake your head knowingly as if he has some sort of uncontrollable yet endearing pathology), when you see him poking fun at himself for this very thing. In one scene, Bobby Shaftoe thinks he's in \\"HELL'S DEMO\\" when he's forced to listen to someone \\"explain the organization of the German intelligence hierarchy.\\" Though the lecture causes Shaftoe to hallucinate, the reader still manages to learn something about the Wehrmacht Nachrichten Verbindungen while being thankful to realize that Stephenson knows he has this \\"issue.\\"<br /><br />It's easy to tell that Neal Stephenson loves to do research and loves to impart the knowledge he's gleaned, or ideas he's thought up, and it's hard to criticize him for this, especially since it's all done in his clever, colorful, and entertaining style, even if it's not always relevant to the plot. And sometimes these infodumps can really set a scene. Here's a very short example:<br /><br />\\"The Bletchley girls surround him. They have celebrated the end of their shift by applying lipstick. Wartime lipstick is necessarily cobbled together from whatever tailings and gristle were left over once all of the good stuff was used to coat propeller shafts. A florid and cloying scent is needed to conceal its unspeakable mineral and animal origins. It is the smell of War.\\"<br /><br />Stephenson also delights in creating quirky similes:<br /><br />\\"Like the client of one of your less reputable pufferfish sushi chefs, Randy Waterhouse does not move from his assigned seat for a full ninety minutes...\\"<br /><br />Though I skimmed a few of Stephenson's longer tangents, I was nevertheless entertained by the clever plot of Cryptonomicon. I read the novel in two formats. One was Subterranean Press's signed limited edition which was printed on thick glossy paper and embellished with new artwork by Patrick Arrasmith, several graphs, and even some perl script. My Advanced Review Copy of this book weighs 4 pounds (and it was only paperback -- the published version is hardback). I also listened to MacMillan's audiobook read by William Dufris. I'm sure Cryptonomicon was not an easy book to read out loud, but Dufris did an amazing job, even actually sounding like Ronald Reagan during the Reagan interview.<br /><br />Cryptonomicon won the Locus Award in 2000 and was nominated for both the Hugo and Arthur C. Clarke Awards that year. Pretty big accomplishment for a book that's not even science fiction. For readers who haven't tried one of Neal Stephenson's books yet, Cryptonomicon is a good place to start.d by the clever plot of Cryptonomicon. I read the novel in two formats.

0812992792|5.0|I have always been fascinated by the hermit kingdom of Kim Jung Il and now his chubby son. I tried to \\"Inspector O\\" series (based on a North Korean police investigator) but found the main character was just too \\"smooth\\" in the unflappable James Bond model.  This book was riveting, in that you do buy into the characters to whom reality of what the state presents it to be, and everyone is always prepared to denounce or to be denouced by friends and family.  Although I am not a big fiction reader, I did read this in under 3 days of stolen hours.  Clearly North Korea has evolved into a state that Stalin himself would envy.  Both entertaining and chilling. Highly reccomended.
0812550706|5.0|Ender Wiggin is a \\"Third.\\" His parents were allowed to have him only because their first two children, Peter and Valentine, showed so much promise. Earth is expecting another Bugger attack from outer space and humans are desperately trying to breed and train the children who they hope will be Earth's saviors. Peter, Valentine, and Ender Wiggin are all geniuses, but Ender seems to have just the right balance of intelligence, resolve, independence, and sensitivity to make a great leader for Earth's international forces.<br /><br />When Ender is only six years old, the International Fleet comes to take him away to Battle School. There he meets dozens of other little geniuses, some who resent Ender for his quick advancement, and some who would even like to get him out of the way. Does Ender have what it takes to make it through the rigorous training and to become the military hero that Earth hopes for? Or, as he fears, will he grow up to be like his tyrannical and sadistic older brother?<br /><br />Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card was published in 1985 and was based on a short story that Card wrote in 1977. The novel won both the Hugo and Nebula Awards. The focus is on Ender's psychological drama as he is raised by indifferent parents (they know he'll be taken away at an early age), tortured by a cruel brother, separated from his beloved sister, and cast without a friend into a highly competitive and often hostile environment where he's expected to rise to the top. During all of this, Ender wonders if he will be responsible for saving Earth, or destroying it. There's a lot resting on Ender's little shoulders and the tension never lets up. At times Ender becomes whiny and emotionally overwrought, but who can blame him?<br /><br />The main characters in Ender's Game are young children and there are plenty of silly jokes about farts and butts, but there's also some bad language, quite a lot of violence, and discussions about diplomacy and politics that will be too heavy for younger readers. Ender's got plenty of personal flaws, too, and he has to deal with some major ethical issues such as does the end justify the means?<br /><br />Thus, Ender's Game is classified as Young Adult. Teens will enjoy Ender's training at Battle School. The trainees are divided into teams and the battle tactics they learn are practiced in mock battles under zero gravity conditions. These scenes are great fun and, surprisingly, they don't become dull because the difficulty and the stakes keep rising. During his time off, Ender plays a fantasy RPG that he wants to conquer without realizing why. He doesn't understand why the game acts as it does, but it turns out to have a provocative significance later on.<br /><br />Ender's Game is fast-paced and becomes steadily more intense as the book goes on. Near the end there's a huge twist that will leave your jaw on the floor, and several other tantalizing discoveries follow. I look forward to reading more about these in the first sequel, Speaker for the Dead, which also won both the Hugo and Nebula awards.<br /><br />Interestingly, the U.S. Marines has Ender's Game on its Professional Reading List, explaining in their Ender's Game Discussion Guide that \\"Ender's Game is more than about the difficulty and excitement that competition provides in preparing for combat. There are lessons in training methodology, leadership, and ethics as well. Such richness in range and treatment has made Card's book an oft-read and re-read title for many years; Ender's Game has been a stalwart item on the Marine Corps Reading List since its inception.\\"<br /><br />I read Audio Renaissance's full-cast audio version of Ender's Game which was narrated mostly by Stefan Rudnicki (my favorite reader), Harlan Ellison, Gabrielle De Cuir, and David Birney. There's also a cameo by Orson Scott Card. This audiobook is terrific. There's also a long but interesting author's note at the end, read by Orson Scott Card. He talks about the book, the audiobook production, and the upcoming movie (set for release on March 15, 2013). I'm looking forward to that movie.013). I'm looking forward to that movie.

0525478817|5.0|This is the greatest piece of literature I have ever stumbled upon. A friend let me borrow her copy, and I immediately went home and read. I didn't expect to get so interested, but nonetheless, I finished the whole thing in 7 and a half hours. I laughed, I cried, and a weird mixture of the two which sounded like a dying walrus. I can't even begin to explain how well written this novel is. As a 15 year old girl with health problems, I, too, know what it's like to go to sleep not having the comfort that you will definitely awaken in the morning or ever fall in love or be remembered when you're gone. This book spoke to me in ways no one ever could. It made me realize that everyone's days are numbered and there is hope and promise in finding pure joy in the little time that we have here on earth. I debated on posting this for a really long time, and then realized why. I was feeling Hazel's same emotion with An Imperial Affliction: wanting to scream to the world that this is greatest book ever written and also wanting to keep it hidden, a secret, kept only for you, and you alone. I then came to the conclusion that if every one in the world read this book and genuinely felt the pain of every character that enters the story, perceive every moment of sheer joy and those of pure desolation John Green inscribed onto  all 313 pages, that the world would reach it's own eternal nirvana. But the world is not a wish-granting factory.
B0060ZJ7BC|3.0|This movie centers around Billy Beane, the GM of the Oakland A's, who tries to build a winning team despite a limited budget.  It goes back and forth between his efforts to find the adequate players using an economic model and his flashbacks of his days as a young man who was recruited into the majors.  Foregoing a full scholarship to Stanford to play pro ball, he ends up striking out both literally and figuratively. So he turns to scouting and he tries to implement this economic model that a Yale grad introduces him to and is based on a James model.  Eventually, despite initial trials and tribulations, they meet with success in the form of a twenty game winning streak.  But they aren't able to win in the postseason games.  Their efforts aren't in vain, however, as the movie makes a case that the Boston Red Sox used their economic model to break the curse of the Bambino and win the World Series.  The movie is pretty clean in the sense that it doesn't have nudity nor outrageous passion scenes.  It does feature a lot of cussing as men do in business meetings. But the main drawback of the film is that it could have been cut to about half the time that it takes to watch the show.  It is as if the directors thought they had an epic on their hands and while the story is interesting, it is a far cry from an epic.  Furthermore while Brad Pitt still has charm and good looks, it does get monotonous to stare at his face for five minutes at a time over and over as the movie tries to add drama to the story.
B000001FZK|5.0|I bought this album, cassette actually, in Amsterdam on a European Vacation when it was first released. I was a big fan of Talk Talk and took the turn from Colour of Spring to Spirit of Eden.

I have been using it lately and I found that I am reaching levels of memory I didn't know it was possible. For example, I was questioned on a medical article that I read and I realized that I was not remembering the facts, but I was remembering THE PAGE. It was almost like I had opened the web browser again and began reading.<br /><br />If you ever had problems in school, thought that you are too dumb to do anything, study anything, this book will give you a tremendous relief in knowing that regardless of how bad your memory is, you can change it.<br /><br />The only thing I would add here is the reference to Einstein, who in fact had poor memory. One the the common facts known about Einstein was that he was famous for misplacing items, particularly umbrellas, and could barely remember names or appointments. In my opinion, this habit of forgetting superfluous items in indiscriminate places was simply the result of Einstein having more important things to remember. He did not care to things that didn't \\"matter\\" to him.<br /><br />This did not stop him from becoming the epitome of genius in our History. Read the book, and remember that intelligence is relative; information is always available to those who seek it, and everything changes. Including your capacity to remember.
B006UG90RM|5.0|By far the best album I've heard in years. But, don't be fooled this just might be the heaviest Van Halen album since Fair Warning. This albumis absolutely amazing and Eddie shows why he's the king of the guitar.
0743437497|5.0|Before I read King I had assumed he was an overrated, bloated author that had way too many movie adaptations of his works--in fact he has the Guinness World Record for most film adaptations of all time (no surprise). Then I read his `On Writing' book (because I am an aspiring fiction/horror writer) and I learned a lot. Big deal though, whoopie do, I still wasn't interested in his stuff . . . but something kept on nagging and nagging at me . . . something dark and tall; it was The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger. I cannot explain why; maybe it's because the book I was writing at the time seemed like it would benefit itself if I, my book's Writer, would step outside my comfort zone (Crichton, McCarthy, Matheson, Barker) and just try to read The Dark Tower: The Gunslinger. I finally read it because the cover looked sweet, not gonna lie. The ever-binding, story-interweaving Todash Darkness pulled me into the world of King. For instance, the Turtle is in It, and even mentioned in his most recent 11/22/63; and Todash Darkness--that vague conceptual, slightly existentialistic evil that makes a sound like rumbling chimes--which is also mentioned in \\"It\\"; and then there's Randal Flagg, Donald Callahan, Ted Brautigan, the Low Men and the Crimson King: all the former are uniting elements in many Stephen King books. And The Dark Tower series is a gateway drug to his other novels; and his other novels are a gateway drug to The Dark Tower--it's full circle, baby!<br /><br /> But let's talk about The Shining, shall we, because that's why you're reading this. In his introduction for the novel King says that the decision to write (and how to write) The Shining was very crucial in terms of his career as a writer. You must understand that Carrie did not break any rules besides<br /><br /> (this one)<br /><br />  and it was very short, which is ideal for debut novels for any author. It was also original and shocking; another must-have. But Carrie wasn't necessarily epic or long lasting. Then `Salem's Lot was his second. He took risks with style, but nothing else; the pacing was fast, and he didn't get too deep into character history. What you knew about most of the characters were through immediate actions and thoughts. And the town itself was something he was familiar with, along with the people and the professions of the people. It was marketable. It worked. It was filmable.<br /><br /> Then The Shining was written more of a character study about how alcoholism destroys marriages and relationships between fathers and their children. Most of the horror wasn't shown on a golden platter as it was in Carrie and `Salem's Lot; instead, the horror was suggestive. It was there, in the shadows, you could choose to see it or ignore it; it was subtle, but there. Then toward the end, that's when the fireworks begin to go off one after the other . . . but still, for my generation (twenty-somethings) and younger, many will pass up The Shining just because it takes a while to pick up the pace and, hey, there's a movie, too--Jack Nicholson's in it, so they'll just watch that, assuming that they'll get the \\"same thing out of it\\"--which is a shame. Ultimately this was King's attempt to actually write a literarily respectable novel with horror aspects (and he does stay true to horror; it's just not blood and guts all the time).<br /><br /> I won't waste your time with the synopsis; the book is different than the film, but it's not that different and I can't say how it is even if I wanted to (which I don't), because the differences would be spoilers. It's a little scarier than Stanley Kubrick's film adaptation in principles and it had a better story; but the movie is easier to watch. However, if you don't mind a slower paced novel that builds up like tension from a rope being pulled further and further apart until it snaps like a stale jerky, then you should definitely read The Shining--and then make sure you read The Dark Tower series (at least the first four are phenomenal).

B005LAIGFU|4.0|I just watched this film and it sort of touched me in many ways. It struck a positive note with me for its camera/video/audio/narrative style which was nothing short of simply outstanding. At the same time, however, the film had a truly disturbing, upsetting, revolting and petrifying effect on me with its emotionally and psychologically overwhelming and, I'd even go as far as to say, \\"vein slashing\\" subject that keeps you both physically and mentally captivated, engrossed, mesmerised and, most of all, simply put, shocked.  It has been the second most unpleasant movie script and subject matter to swallow and digest in my entire film loving experience after the notorious Irreversible (2002). Yet it has also climbed up the ladder to the top of my preference and recommendation list for the quality of its presentation.  Up until today I was having great difficulty understanding, never mind explaining, the concept and meaning of the word \\"ART\\". From now on if someone asks me for a definition of that word I will just point out this film as one of the most precise, elaborate yet bearably succinct medium towards its comprehension. Certainly not everyone's cup of tea, especially not for the faint hearted. It is, nonetheless, a MUST WATCH !!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game, lots of apps that is annoying but easy to get around. Games can be addictive. overall a cool game worth getting
0312641893|4.0|A Cinderella story with a twist.<br />  Wow! a cyborg Cinderella. I am impressed with Marissa's idea. I fell in love with the setting immediately. It was cyperpunk, futuristic, science fiction and dystopian. The way the author weaves those elements made the book so interesting.<br /> The world she made is centered in New Beijing. Not all books have this Asian setting and Prince Charming so I was really impressed. Even though it is a retelling, I still find it wonderful and original.<br />  The characters are realistic. I like Cinder's character, she is strong, thoughtful and independent. Being a cyborg didn't hinder her to do things. It was interesting when Prince Kai disguised himself in the market to seek out Linh Cinder. I like how he acts like a normal person even though he is the New Beijing's heir to the throne. He is smart, charismatic and kind. Cinder's step mother and sisters gave spice to the story. I like how wicked they are to Cinder. It was also interesting to have one sister nice to her. The Lunar Queen, is actually my favorite character. I love how the author described her in the book. She is beautiful in a wicked sort of way, she is powerful and deceiving. It was cool to have a woman dictator. The only thing that I don't like about the book is.... it was predictable. There was no shock moments for me.<br />Overall, This book is refreshing, it is very unique. I would recommend this book to people who loves sci-fiction, adventure and romance. I can't wait for the second book!
B0073PZIYI|4.0|I thought this was a fun film.  Good acting all the way around, not extremely deep character development but it's enough to let you relate.  I think the main plot of the movie is fantastic, it's kind of a representation of current society and how 1% are killing off the other 99.  It does seem to drag on at about 2/3 in till the climax.  No big surprises really, but the ending was fine.  I enjoyed Matt Bomer but wish they would have expanded more on his storyline, but enjoyed his role regardless.  I give it 3.5 out of 5.  Definitely a fun watch but don't expect anything super groundbreaking or anything.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good, classic game. I like that you can tap the card to send it to it's spot if you don't want to drag.
B006UG90RM|4.0|I was twelve when 1984 came out.  I hadn't been exposed to much of Van Halen's stuff before this release.  I remember watching DLR hop around the television screen on MTV thinking to myself \\"How awesome is THIS?!?\\".  Panama and Hot For Teacher were the anthems of my preteen years.  Then, they broke up and I got used to Van Hagar because I kind of had to.  As I got older and scraped together some cash, I bought the pre 1984 albums and realized what I had really missed in those early years pre-MTV.  Despite being fine with Van Hagar, I always secretly hoped that Dave and the Van Halen brothers could figure out a way to put their differences aside and come together for the good of their fans.  I guess in some ways I was like that 12 year old boy who just hopes and prays that his divorced parents would just give it one more shot.  This album has some stinkers on it (Tattoo, in my opinion, was a poor choice for a first single) and there are others that would have been singles back in the hey dey had they found their way to a post 1984 album.  I've probably given it about 3-4 spins now, and I just simply have to realize that Dave's pipes aren't what they used to be, and Michael Anthony's not coming back anytime soon.  Wolfie does an admirable job on bass, but it's mostly Michael's strong backing vocals that are missed here.  If nothing else, pick up the album for the vision of what could have been in the past 28 years had these grown men found a way to continue professionally.

0060751967|4.0|Summary:  After testifying in a murder trial against a member of the Russian Mafia, Shanna Whelan was whisked away from her home and family by the Witness Protection Program.  She started a new life in New York City as  a dentist in SoHo, working the night shift at a 24hr clinic.  It has been a long time since anything interesting has happened in her life, but that all changes when Russian hitmen AND a gorgeous stranger show up at her clinic on the same night.  Roman Draganesti is the leader of one of the largest vampire covens in the United States.  His scientific research, and his invention of synthetic blood, has made him a hero in both the human and vampire worlds.  It is no longer necessary for Vampires to feed from humans, allowing the vampire community to become more self-reliant and less dangerous.  Not everyone in the vampire community is happy with this change, however.  There is a group of deadly vampires who believe synthetic blood is an abomination, and those who choose to consume the blood are traitors to their race.  These vampires will use any excuse to start a war with Roman's coven.  One night, during a scientific experiment gone awry, Roman loses one of his fangs.  If he doesn't get it repaired before daylight, the socket will heal and he'll be one-fanged for the rest of his life.  Not willing to risk such an embarrassing situation, Roman turns to Shanna's 24hr (human) dental clinic for the procedure.  Roman shows up only moments before the Russian Mafia - who have hired a vampire assassin to put an end to Shanna's life.  Roman needs a dentist, and Shanna clearly needs rescuing, so Roman saves her life and brings her to his home.  Shanna has no idea that Roman is a vampire at first, nor did she know that such creatures really existed.  When she begins to piece things together, she is torn between her strong feelings for the man who continues to save lives, and the terror she feels at the thought that he isn't human.  Facing their emotions might prove to be more difficult than facing their many enemies.  Review:  I used to stay away from novels that have comedic titles like this one.  I made the assumption that they would be similar to satire movies like Vampires Suck or the Scary Movie franchise, which I don't care for.  Now that I've read a few of them, I've realized that I jumped to the wrong conclusion.  How to Marry a Millionaire Vampire had plenty of humor (especially in the first half) but there was also danger, romance, and an interesting cast of characters.  I really enjoyed it.  There is a clan of men who are Scottish Highlanders AND vampires in Roman's coven.....  how could I not love the combination of my two favorite types of male characters??  Most of the humor in this book came from Shanna's inner dialog, confusion, and irrational behavior.  However, the vampire characters add plenty of humor also.  The difference is that the vampires are very serious creatures, so their humor comes from the serious way they handle situations that are completely ridiculous.  Picture a bunch of vampires trying to pump synthetic blood through a life-like sex doll....  the purpose being to find ways to feed vampires without endangering humans.  Their goal was clearly noble, but the circumstances are absurdly funny.  As much as I liked the book, there were a few weak points.  The humor of the story began to die down in the second half of the book, and it was almost non-existent by the end.  I missed it - it was my favorite part of the book.  The second half introduces a more intimate relationship between Shanna and Roman.  While I liked the romance, I didn't think the physical scenes between them were written very well.  Lastly, I wasn't crazy about how a few of the plotlines were resolved in the end, but I'm willing to reserve judgement on this until I read how they are continued in the next book.  This book did not offer any suggestions about how Roman and Shanna would eventually address Shanna's aging while he does not.  It also did not provide an actual wedding - merely the suggestion of one.  And, while there is a final confrontation, the book ends with more looming conflict for the cast than what existed before the confrontation.  There was a lot of unfinished business.  I am looking forward to reading more in this series, and I recommend that PR and UF fans give it a shot.  If you think you might be open to a more humorous approach to these genres, then this would be a great place to start.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Not only was this album one particular bands debut release,but it was also the beginning of a whole new way of looking at hard rock. True with most pop music,very little just comes out of the blues. What was done hear had it's definite origins. But again it was the case of a musician,in this case Eddie Van Halen offering another way the electric rock guitar could be played. Especially in terms of hard rock. As a matter of fact one could almost say this hailed in the whole hair metal genre. And it's interesting to note another viewers comments that this album was part of the \\"disco sucks\\" phenomenon. Of course we all know when the 90's rolled in...well the alternative community went the other route and in turn went after bands like Van Halen and other hair metal pioneers as emphasizing \\"technique over soul\\". Well a lot of music for dancing has much soul. And so do Van Halen. And that,along with everything that makes them a special group is on full display here.<br /><br />  From beginning to end this album is full of a musical and vocal devil may care,rebellious smirk,thanks to the flair of Eddie's playing and David Lee Roth's over the top rock star ego. The grinding \\"Running With The Devil\\" really sets the stage and it goes onto \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\\",\\"Jamie's Crying\\" and \\"Feel Your Love Tonight\\". They have Eddie's trademark guitar of course as well as David's vocal personality,as well as the big anthemic choruses and hooks. On the other hand \\"Eruption\\",\\"Atomic Punk\\" and \\"On Fire\\" bring in a ferocious guitar attack and heavy tempo that also anticipates speed metal. Throughout the album there are two factors also involved: extremely adept musicianship and a deep love of the blues almost as much as the spirit of Led Zeppelin. You hear that most of all in their swaggering shuffle of \\"Ice Cream Man\\",beginning actually with an almost acoustic folk/blues intro. On \\"I'm The One\\" they even go into this big band swing/doo wop type chorus,showing genuine affection for the rebel music of bygone era as well as their sentimental side. \\"Little Dreamer\\" has a slower,funkier groove to it and somewhat more polish too.<br /><br />  It's so surprise this band was a protege of Kiss's Gene Simmons,in a somewhat similar manner to the all black rock band Living Color was with Mick Jagger in the 80's. They had the ability to hang onto their own egos AND be paraded about by other established rock stars as well. With all of the powerful guitar solos from Eddie and the often underrated and very adaptable drumming of brother Alex,the one quality that really defines this album aside from rocking out almost completely from song to song is the cleanliness of the production. The sounds of each instrument,vocal harmony and screech are done up with just the right amount echo plex and other studio effects to bring out the theatrics,melody and ability this band always possessed. And while I must say I disagree with the idea that Van Halens first two albums are very similar sounding (I see [[ASIN:B00004Y6O8 Van Halen II]] as a totally different animal than this),this particular album does possess a special quality that gives in the distinction of being among the top 70's rock debut albums.ic of bygone era as well as their sentimental side. \\"Little Dreamer\\" has a slower,funkier groove to it and somewhat more polish too.

0307891402|5.0|Very happy I bought the hard cover as the book is enormous.  I don't have to worry about falling apart or getting dog eared over time like the soft cover would.  Has pretty much all the info you will require for the game and then some.  Also has some basic character build types to start out with but the game is so open ended that you don't have to follow these at all.  There's a large fold out map but I haven't taken it out yet.  Also has a code to access an interactive map online, I haven't accessed that either.  I find Skyrim on my dual screen PC won't let me out of the game on the main screen to browse the web on the other screen.  Alt Tab works but then takes a while to alt tab back into Skyrim.  I highly recommend spending the extra for this hard cover version.
B006UG909U|4.0|Of course that is the question. I am sure there are plenty of reasons scattered throughout Wikipedia and less legit gossip cololms as to where Van Halen have been for the last fourteen years. Not to mention that David Lee Roth hasn't bothered returning to front the band in the studio for 28 years. We all remember how the last tour with him went. Good and bad I suppose. And yes. Plenty of rock n roll cliches were involved. Always is isn't it? Yet here they are again. Older and hopefully somewhat wiser considering substance abuse problems and often very public in fighting. Now that David Lee Roth is back with them and they are about to tour with Kool & The Gang as the opening act,a very unusual and pretty exciting concept if you think about it,is there still anything important for them to say musically? Well even I was in for a shock.<br /><br />  Van Halen always had a poppy,hook laden side. They also had a bluesy funky side and a technical one as well. As far as the hook laden part that's still there. But honestly this is one of the hardest edged,loudest and abrasive Van Halen records I myself have ever heard. A good deal of the songs such as \\"China Town\\",\\"Blood And Fire\\",\\"Bullethead\\",\\"As Is\\" and \\"Outta Space\\" have such loud and high mixed leads from Eddie,Diamond Dave's still powerful voice is almost burried in the mix. You can hear Eddie still kind of competing with him as something of the leader of the group. Of course they both are,on different levels. And the songs themes of struggle and determination seem quite appropriate for that sort of relationship. \\"Tatoo\\",the lead single has a bit more of a groove to it,with some witty social commentary mixed in too. \\"Stay Frosty\\" again wittily points to happily indulging in a culture of denial set to a bouncy country-blues/heavy metal hybrid if you can imagine such a thing.<br /><br />  On the other hand \\"Big River\\" is probably the closest thing this loud,hard rocking album has to a more concise pop single. Being my first new music purchase of this year,I must say it's also one of the most suprising of the last few years. Upon first hearing it I felt,even for hard rock the sound was a bit too cluttered and abrasive. I often find even in heavy metal I usually find it's helpful to keep your lead lines relatively clean. That's one reason I never was too big a fan of a lot of grunge/alternative rock. And while Eddies lead lines are instrumentally as \\"clean\\" and sharp as they ever were here,the production is a bit loudly processed at times. It's the sort of album I'd have remixed some of the songs,especially around the middle. But really it's not that disappointing a comeback album. Also I appreciate the heavier blues influence and actually channeling  that into embracing the aging rock star concept as opposed to running from that. And demonstrates a sound worth refining a little bit. Good luck on this one Van Halen! And thanks for coming back again with David Lee Roth.

B004UXUX7S|5.0|MOVIE REVIEW #20: The Descendants<br /><br />Alexander Payne, director of a couple of my favorite independent films \\"Sideways\\" and \\"Election\\" -  has done it again. The \\"Descendants\\" was a surprisingly warm, entertaining and thoughtful film. It deals specifically with a family going through a specific tragedy and dealing with that tragedy and all the secrets they never knew existed.<br /><br />George Clooney pulls an emotionally charged and compassionate performance as a father dealing with his wife and her near fatal accident. (Played by Patricia Hastie of \\"Lost\\", basically playing a invalided accident victim - no dialogue at all.)  He needs to deal with the solitude of losing a wife and dealing with estranged children who are remarkably good actors themselves. The oldest daughter is played by Shailene Woodley (\\"The OC\\", \\"Secret Life Of An American Teenager\\")  and the youngest daughter  played by Amara Miller (in her very first project ever).<br /><br />What made this movie so good for me was the complexity of Clooney's character and the depth he went to in order to deal with a big family secret, an estranged daughter, a curious daughter and a dying wife. It felt real and heartwarming to see his friends and a new real estate agent and his wife literally turn his world upside down!  Try keeping a dry eye during this film.<br /><br />The movie feature a completely Hawaiian underscore with classic songs and ukulele strums as well as a realistic look at life in the modern day Hawaiian Islands. The greenery, the land, the ocean and even the never seen rural areas of middle-class homes - all are woven in such detail as to only enhance the story.<br /><br />The cast includes some other incredible performances by Mathew Lillard (\\"Scooby Doo\\", \\"Madd TV\\") , Judy Greer (\\"What Women Want', \\"13 Going on 30\\")  and Beau Bridges (\\"Fabulous Baker Boys\\", \\"Stargate\\").<br /><br />Overall this movie has a lot to offer. Real-life drama and passion and the only thing that might be off setting is that the \\"R\\" rating for this movie is because of the language. (Which includes the kids.) I can see why it's winning all the awards and the fact it is currently up for  five Academy Award Nominations including;  Actor In a Leading Role - George Clooney, Best Picture, Directing -Alexander Payne, Film Editing - Kevin Tent, and Writing (Adapted Screenplay) - Alexander Payne, Nat Faxon and Jim Rash.<br /><br />A very well made film.language.

B0059XTUO0|5.0|MOVIE REVIEW #21: \\"The Artists\\"<br /><br />What a fresh and fun film! French director Michel Hazanavicius (OSS 117) has brought `magic' back to the silver screen! It's a silent film. Complete with title cards for dialogue and an enriched musical score that advances the story and moves the heart!<br /><br />An independent foreign film on its own it tells the story of a Silent Movie star who doesn't quite make the transition to sound-sync films. The two leads played by two French actors Jean Dujardin and B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo who are both filled with French TV and film  credits from their individual careers  that on screen in this film they are sharp, electric and filled with on-screen chemistry. The on screen chemistry of the two of them sparkle with life and energy.<br /><br />Another star of the film is the puppy owned by the lead actor played by an extremely well trained and scene stealing Jack Russell dog named Uggie (his name in real life). This dog does some amazing moves and stunts and warms your heart and literally `saves' the story in an amazing way.<br /><br />The film has a fresh and crisp look in its cinematography and very spot-on on costuming and production design that you actually forget the movie is silent (almost 100%) and are enveloped in the story and characters.<br /><br />This movie will make you laugh, cry and laugh again.....and has some `silent' performances from John Goodman (\\"Monsters, Inc.\\", \\"Rosanne\\") playing a movie producer with a big bite, Malcolm McDowell (\\"A Clockwork Orange\\", \\"Entourage\\") playing a fellow extra waiting for his break into movies and James Cromwell (\\"Star Trek First Contact\\", \\"Babe\\") the steady and loyal valet of the movie star himself.<br /><br />For me - it's a hard pick between \\"The Artist\\" and \\"The Descendants\\" for best picture this year. One thing is for sure - it definitely deserved all ten nominations it received  this year: Actor In a Leading Role - Jean Dujardin, Actress In a Supporting Role - B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo, Art Direction - Laurence Bennett (Production Design); Robert Gould (Set Decoration),  Best Picture, Cinematography- Guillaume Schiffman,  Costume Design - Mark Bridges, Directing - Michel Hazanavicius, Film Editing - Anne-Sophie Bion and Michel Hazanavicius,  Music (Original Score) - Ludovic Bource. and Writing (Original Screenplay) - Michel Hazanavicius.<br /><br />Definitely a must see film for the whole family.

B006FE3FFC|5.0|\\"The Walking Dead\\" (Season 2) is a Zombie tale in the form of an eight part mini series on the AMC network. The first show was two hours in length and was followed by seven segments that were each a hour in length.<br /><br />The entire second season of \\"The Walking Dead'\\" is unbelievably good. Great acting of interesting characters that have such a diversity of personalities, highlight this intriguing series. Couple the acting with a suspenseful story with life and death implications, creepy settings and the occasional unexpected attack and you have a series to keep you on the edge of your seat.<br /><br />I noticed some other reviewers complained that there was not enough action, or less action than in Season 1 and that may be true to a point. But this season, to me, was much better because of the emotional build-up in some of the scenes. Things that lead to some unpopular but decisive decisions making... decisions that sometimes had repercussion that were of mammoth proportions in the overall scope of this ongoing tale. I found it very easy to become totally immersed in this thrilling series.<br /><br />The finale ending... violent, yet stunningly heart-rendering and somehow cathartic. So far I've watched the last few minutes four separate times and oh my... the acting, the raw, visceral emotion... just gut wrenching. Hard to express in words the impact of this visual experience... best to see it yourself.<br /><br />I can hardly wait for the rest of Season 2.<br /><br />5 Stars...more if I could.<br /><br />Ray Nicholson
B005FMZWD8|5.0|This watch is fenomenal!!! Worth every penny, I am a lefty and my love for watches just went up the roof. Love every detail of it!
B0041MFOE0|5.0|The movie arrive early and just as stated by the Seller, thank you:) My kids loved this movie so I got it for my Granddaughter who laughs everytime I sing DO RE ME!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have played this game more than most of the others I have downloaded. I have been very impressed by how easy it is to play.
1419701533|5.0|I was surpised how theese books can keep my almost 9 year old son reading all day long, even in the bed he is reading! I would reccomend it to every parent to buy. Sure you can borow them from libriary, but your child will read it just once and can't have a chance to go back to his favorite parts again and again. If you want to make your kids read- just have all of the books. I am happy with my purchase.  This is so funny and a great book -my son said.Also he said- its a great hit by Jeff Kinney-maker of poptrica!
B004APVI1G|5.0|WOW, i am very impressed with the 3D and the quality of the picture when used with my samsung plasma 3D TV. I have watched it twice since getting it and will probably continue watching it again and again whenever i have guests over. I own 2 3D movies and 3 3D documentaries, and this is by far the best 3D movie i have seen anywhere. I waited till the owls went on sale for twenty bucks and i am very pleased with my purchase and fast delivery. AWESOME MOVIE BRO!
B006UG90RM|5.0|I've been disapointed for years in Van Halen, so i'm pleased to be able to say that this album KICKS A$$!  Best Rock Album in ages....and about time.  I'm not going to compare it to what's been done in the past....this is Van Halen NOW....and it ROCKS.  Dave belongs here, Eddie hasn't lost a thing, Alex still has it as well and Wolfgang fits in just fine.  Killer album.

B000L53D4O|4.0|Got this for my baby and it  immediately helped her in her walking. Very sturdy to helped her lean how to walk. It's a little cheap looking and the toys on it are just okay but the baby likes and the price was ok.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|My just-turned six year old loves this game.  He is learning to strategize his moves. Loads of fun and learning too!
0062082353|5.0|This book was for my husband and he loved it !  He read it entirely in just a couple of days.  He talked about all of the things he read in this book and really enjoyed it.  We love buying our books from Amazon - great selection at great prices and fast delivery.
B004LWZW7O|2.0|Staying in the theme of this movie, I want the 109 minutes back that I wasted on watching it.  Forget the money I paid to rent it - I want my time back.  It was a great idea for a sci-fi movie but it was very poor execution.  Where do I start?  In the future, we can genetically engineer you to age only 25 years yet we seem to throw even the minimal security of a PIN number to protect our assets out the window.  Apparently the best security available in the future is archaic bank vaults.  Movies like this turn people off to sci-fi when actually, sci-fi can be one of the most philosophical and thought-provoking genres to watch.  And I find it really ironic when Hollywood tries to make a movie about the oppressed, low-wage earning masses.  If this movie is supposed to increase our awareness of the imbalance of wealth in today's society, don't do it with actors who are worth millions.  People conveniently forget that celebrities like Timberlake and Seyfreid are part of that top 1% of wage earners in the US.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is pprobably the best Bible app you could get. There are dozens of differant translations/versions of the Bible avaliable. I am currently doing one of the many programs that walk you through the Bible in a year, and I'm loveing it. I highly recomemd this app to everyone. the only down side is that in order to use this app you need to be connected to wifi. other then that I think its awesome.
0385535139|5.0|Received my book when I was told I would. Am impressed with the used price and the wonderful condition of my book. Very frustrated that the book I ordered along with this one never arrived. Have been asking at the post office about it and they say it was signed for by them but then returned. No one has responded to my inquiries.
1466401885|5.0|Do you like romance?  Check.  Do you like hot good looking men?  Check.  Do you like it when hot good looking men fall for that innocent woman?  Check.  In Jamie McGuire's Beautiful Disaster, we read about Abby and Travis.  Abby is the good girl who catches the attention of bad boy Travis.  Travis has that reputation, yes, the ladies man.  Every girl at the college wants him.  They hang all over him.  He's cocky, he knows that's how the girls feel about him.  So when Abby doesn't respond in the same way, he is intrigued.  Ms. McGuire definitely knows how to take her readers on a roller coaster ride.  One minute you want to kiss Travis, the next punch his lights out.  Some have had opposite feelings about him than I do.  Some think he's too rough and abusive.  I see Travis as sweet and loyal.  The story of Abby and Travis is definitely not easy.  They go through a lot.  You wonder if they'll ever find their way.  But oh wow, if you're like me, you won't be able to put the book down until you're done.  I highly recommend Beautiful Disaster.  Even if you end up not liking the book, you won't forget it.
145162445X|2.0|Despite the fact that Stephen Hawking's book with Leonard Mlodinow, The Grand<br />Design, begins by intoning, \\"Philosophy is dead,\\" many physicists recently, not<br />least Hawking himself, have ventured to make many controversial philosophical<br />speculations going far beyond the science that is presently well understood.<br />Lawrence Krauss's latest book, A Universe from Nothing: Why There Is Something<br />Rather than Nothing, falls into this category.  Chapters 2-8 are a nice<br />popularization of much of what we have learned in cosmology (modulo a few<br />technical details) and are well worth reading.  (I would have given four stars<br />if the book had just included these chapters and had a reasonable title.)<br />But in my mind as another physicist working in the same general area of cosmology<br />(and perhaps focusing deeper into the quantum aspects of cosmology),<br />its philosophical argumentations fall far wide of the mark of answering<br />the age-old question of why there is something rather than nothing.<br />Krauss essentially redefines the ancient difficult question into different forms<br />that science can address, discusses possible solutions to the restricted questions<br />(themselves highly speculative, as Krauss carefully recognizes), and then seems<br />to imply that these speculative answers to the restricted questions solve<br />the ancient difficult problem.<br /><br />As I would put it, the question of why there is something rather than nothing is<br />the question of why there is anything not logically necessary (something) rather<br />than not anything not logically necessary (nothing).  True theorems of<br />mathematics (the logical following of the conclusions from the axioms, not the<br />axioms or conclusions themselves, which might be neither true nor false, such as<br />the axiom of choice, which can consistently be either assumed or negated) seem<br />to be logically necessary, true in all logically possible worlds, so I am<br />excluding them from being counted as `something,' since otherwise it would seem<br />obvious that these supposed `somethings' must necessarily exist.  However,<br />entities like elementary particles, atoms, molecules, sand grains, rocks, life,<br />sex, people, money, books, book reviews, memes, computers, internets,<br />universities, nations, continents, planets, stars, galaxies, electromagnetic<br />fields, space, time, quantum states, quantum operators, quantum probabilities,<br />particle masses, coupling constants, laws of physics, observations, conscious<br />perceptions (or sentient experiences), and even God in my view (though many<br />disagree) are not, so far as I can see, logically necessary, so they are<br />`somethings' in my sense.  They are somethings whose existence has long been<br />mysterious.  Why do any of these entities exist, if there is no logical<br />requirement that they must?<br /><br />Krauss nicely tells how the laws of physics and the existence of a quantum state<br />with a region of space and time containing an electromagnetic field (or<br />containing the gravitational field of a black hole) can lead to the evolution of<br />the quantum state from having no particles at one time to a quantum state having<br />particles at another time.  If only particles are counted as `something,' so<br />that the situation with `only' the laws of physics, space, time, and an<br />electromagnetic field or black hole but no particles counts as `nothing,' then<br />indeed these are cases in which we now understand scientifically how `something'<br />can arise from `nothing.'  However, it is a very strong restriction of<br />`something' to exclude laws of physics, space, time, and electromagnetic and<br />gravitational fields.<br /><br />Krauss goes on to discuss how it might be possible to obtain a scientific<br />understanding of how a situation even without space and time can lead to a<br />situation with space, time, fields, and particles, though again he implicitly<br />assumes some laws of physics and a suitable quantum state.  This case has a<br />subtlety that Krauss does not discuss, in that if one considers a situation<br />without time, what is meant by saying that another situation with time arises<br />out of it?  It can hardly be by the time evolution that was assumed in the case<br />of existing space and time with fields that produce particles at a later time<br />that may not exist at an earlier time.<br /><br />One view of quantum gravity, particularly in what is called canonical quantum<br />gravity (though it has problems not fully understood), is that different times<br />are different components of the quantum state (which may also have components<br />with no time, and perhaps even with no time and no space).  In this view in<br />which time is rather emergent (part of some components of the quantum state,<br />like wetness for water molecules that might not be considered to exhibit this<br />property when in isolation), time is not fundamental, so there is no evolution<br />from one component of the quantum state to another, and certainly not from a<br />component without time to a component with time.  Then one would just say that<br />the full quantum state has some components without time, and other components<br />with time.  So even if one chose not to count the quantum state as `something,'<br />one could hardly say that time arose in the sense of time evolution from<br />non-time, but rather simply that both components without time and components<br />with time exist within the full quantum state.  Without time and time evolution,<br />it also appears to be an oxymoron to say, as the title of Chapter 10, that<br />\\"Nothing is Unstable.\\"<br /><br />Now it might be true (though we certainly do not know yet) that unknown laws of<br />physics, including both the dynamical laws (how things evolve with time if there<br />is time, or more generally in quantum theory, the algebra of quantum operators)<br />and the boundary conditions (which solution of the dynamical laws describes our<br />universe or multiverse, or which quantum state it has if quantum theory is<br />indeed correct), determine that parts (components) of the quantum state have no<br />time or space or particles, and that other parts do have time and space and<br />particles.  Restricting `somethings' to, say, time, space, and particles, one<br />might say that the complete quantum state has both `nothing' and `something,'<br />but even with this restricted sense of `something,' it is rather a strained<br />interpretation to say that the `something' part arose out of the `nothing' part;<br />both simply exist within the total reality.  In any case, the laws of physics<br />(both the dynamical laws and the quantum state) are here being implicitly<br />assumed to exist, and it certainly seems unfair to dismiss them as `nothing.'<br /><br />Krauss goes on to speculate that \\"there may be no fundamental theory at all\\"<br />(page 177), perhaps that there are not even fundamental laws of physics, but<br />that the laws we deduce arise from a situation without laws.  This is certainly<br />speculation (though I do not want to imply that Krauss is suggesting that it is<br />not speculation) going far beyond present science, since by what meta-laws or<br />processes could laws arise from non-laws?  Krauss seems to have in mind current<br />ideas of the multiverse, in which the entirety of our physical reality (let me<br />call it the universe, even if it is a multiverse) has highly varied parts, say<br />with different particle content, particle masses, and coupling constants that<br />might be considered to be part of local `laws of physics' or `bylaws' for that<br />part of the universe.  It is an interesting question, now being addressed within<br />superstring/M theory and its apparent string landscape, how an overall<br />superstring/M theory (not yet fully known) might lead todifferent parts of the<br />universe (pocket universes or sub-universes) having different local bylaws of<br />physics.  In this way the local bylaws might indeed arise from the global laws<br />for the entire universe.<br /><br />But so far there is no convincing evidence I am aware of that there are not<br />global laws for the entire universe or multiverse, even if these laws do not<br />lead to unique laws for the sub-universes.  I see the scientific attractiveness<br />of the multiverse hypothesis as arising from the idea that the laws for the<br />entire multiverse might be simpler and more elegant than the laws for our<br />individual sub-universe, not that there are no laws at all for the entirety.<br /><br />In his preface, Krauss admits that philosophers and theologians have objected to<br />his meaning of `nothing' and claim that he does not understand it.  Krauss's<br />initial response is to make the gratuitous ad hominem reply, \\"I am tempted to<br />retort here that theologians are experts at nothing.\\"  He then says that for<br />them, \\"Nothing is `nonbeing,' in some vague and ill-defined sense.\\"  Well, even<br />though I am a scientist rather than a philosopher or theologian, on this issue I<br />agree with them and think that the idea of nothing as the absence of anything<br />not logically necessary is much more precise and well-defined than Krauss's<br />imprecise ideas of `nothing,' such as \\"the absence of space and time itself\\".<br />(If space and time are emergent properties, how does one define precisely their<br />absence?  How can one define precisely the absence of emergent approximate<br />properties like wetness?)<br /><br />Although I have focused on the philosophical ideas of nothingness that Krauss<br />does seems to engage with more by ridicule than by understanding, I also<br />disagree with his anti-theistic remarks, such as his referring on page 173 to \\"a<br />remarkable all-powerful entity for which there is simply no other evidence.\\"  In<br />contrast to this, the existence of an omnipotent God seems to me to be the<br />simplest explanation for the strong historical evidence for the resurrection of<br />Jesus, for example as recently summarized by the masterful historical treatment<br />by N. T. Wright in his 817-page analysis, The Resurrection of the Son of God.<br />So what Krauss wrote here is a gross overstatement.<br /><br />Now my objection to this error should not be mis-interpreted to be an objection<br />to honest doubt and skepticism, which are indeed helpful in both science and<br />religion in getting closer to the truth, and I do appreciate other places in the<br />book where Krauss seems more honest in his skepticism and less dogmatic about<br />lack of contrary evidence.  If the phrase I quoted had been written something<br />like the following, I would not have objected:  \\"a remarkable all-powerful<br />entity for which I personally do not see convincing evidence.\\"  But to say, in<br />the face of the massive historical evidence that Jesus' disciples believed that<br />they had witnessed his empty tomb and personally had seen him resurrected from<br />death, that there is no other evidence for God, sounds woefully ignorant of the<br />facts.  I personally would advocate skepticism toward unsubstantiated beliefs<br />that \\"there is simply no other evidence\\" for God.<br /><br />In his final paragraph of his Afterward, Richard Dawkins makes the prematurely<br />triumphalist statement, \\"And now we can read Lawrence Krauss for what looks to<br />me like the knockout blow.\\"  To me as a fellow scientist, it appears Krauss has<br />instead swung far wide of the goal, striking only the air with his philosophical<br />speculations that do not address the truly deep questions of existence.<br /><br />Don N.

B005I4JG80|4.0|As is the case with many  books comparing American parenting styles with that of other countries, some potential readers have felt opinionated - even defensive - before even buying the book.While I certainly haven't concluded that French parenting is \\"right\\" and American parenting is \\"wrong\\", this intriguing book deserves a fair chance - one obtained by reading it - but some initial \\"reviews\\" were written by people who simply refused to read a book comparing American and French parenting techniques.<br /><br />So what will will you find in Bringing Up Bebe? What makes this one worth a look?<br /><br />To start with, the author, Pamela Druckerman, does not come off as someone who is crazy about France, let alone French parenting -  at first. As she writes early on, \\"I'm not even sure I like living here\\" although she does change her tune later. She came to her opinions about French parenting slowly and she backs up her main  points with plenty of research studies as well as techniques she learned from French parents and parenting authorities. As a result she concludes that \\"the French have managed to be involved without becoming obsessive. \\" They aren't waiting on their kids hand and foot and they don't assume that they have to push their children to succeed. Even so, she notes that she hadn't thought she was supposed to admire French parenting. So consider her a reluctant convert to French methods of parenting.<br /><br />Druckerman observes that there doesn't appear to be a relentless drive to get babies and children to various lessons or such activities as early swimming lessons. A neighbor was content to let her children simply find ways to play, often with old toys or perhaps by exploring her outdoor environment.<br /><br />Meals are also handled differently with set times for eating and with children being expected to exert enough self-control to wait hours in between meals. Vegetables, varied types of cheese, and other foods American kids might snub are not only served but actually eaten.<br /><br />Then there are the studies. They are certainly food for thought and perhaps some spirited debate. One study notes that mothers in Columbus, Ohio find child care twice as unpleasant as mothers in Rennes, France. There is the University of Texas study that concludes that French mothers aren't concerned with accelerating their children's cognitive development or academic achievement. Instead, they are comfortable with letting their kids simply be children while they still can. The author cites another study which indicates that 90 percent of fifteen-year-olds eat their main meal with their parents - compared to 67 percent of those in the United States.<br /><br />The author took detailed notes as she observed French parents. She learns that they expect their babies to start sleeping through the night within no more than a few months - or even in the first month. They ask Druckerman if her baby is \\"doing her nights\\" (sleeping through the night).<br /><br />Admittedly, a certain number don't...but a fair number do because their parents use \\"the Pause\\" , not responding immediately to a baby's cries. When Druckerman tries using \\"the Pause\\" her own baby starts sleeping through the night, although...to be fair...she does wait until her baby is more than a few months old, unlike the French parents she describes.<br /><br />Even infant mortality rates are lower in France, 57 percent lower than in America. There is an emphasis on a calm pregnancy and not eating too much. This doesn't mean starving but an overly obese mother isn't necessarily serving a baby's health. I won't stress this point too much because there could be many other factors that determine the possible difference in infant mortality rates between one country and another.<br /><br />To sum it up, the author has discovered the \\"wisdom\\" of French parenting and has written a book that seems to be aimed at imparting that wisdom to American readers. Druckerman also seems to beencouraging parents to try and change the way American parents perceive children,to not base their lives so much around the kids. To be clear, the parenting advice here is centered on children, not teenagers, as French teenagers are given more freedom but in Druckerman's view also seem to have less cause to rebel.<br /><br />I did have some issues with this book. The first chapter has far too much info about Druckermans' career before moving to France as well as her time meeting and dating her husband-to-be. This takes up an entire chapter. I wanted to get to the parenting observations more quickly. The book consists mostly of personal observations and Druckerman's parenting experiences which are also peppered with interviews with such people as the French \\"Doctor Spock\\" as well as other experts. I'm sure it will be controversial and from what I've seen and read it already is. Even so, this book deserves to be judged based on its contents.encouraging parents to try and change the way American parents perceive children,to not base their lives so much around the kids.

B006ZDS7CE|4.0|The nattering over Lana's SNL performance - which was consistent with others I've seen on the tube recently - forced me to copy cat Liz Phair and buy this in MP3 straight away. It did not strike me as \\"bizarrely under-confident\\". What were Steve and Brian expecting??? By the way, Steve Knopper also said on rollingstone.com that the high percentage of Leonard Cohen units shipped in CD form reflects an elderly fan base, the high percentage of Lana purchases in MP3 reflects youngsters. I bought LC in CD because I want highest possible fidelity on the audiophile stereo in the living room where I can listen without distraction. Lana's fine for iPod in the car, a quick hit at the computer, but LC in ear buds?

B000JU7NCE|1.0|I've been a Cure fan for many, many years, and I have to say that this is one DVD that is sitting in my Cure collection that is so bad, I keep meaning to Ebay it.  The quality of this show is worse that what the average film student could make.  In fact it looks like a student has been handed a camera for the fist time with build in 'strobe' and 'tracer' effects and it playing a game of \\"what does that button do?\\", then gets obsessed with the newfound ability to hit 'tracer' over and over at various points in the songs for 'creative effect' because said student has never had this technology before.  Badly shot, badly edited, with inserts of 'fan footage' shot on mobile phones from the front of the audience.  C'mon Robert, you can afford to not have to rely on free archive from fan's mobile phones!  To be honest, I can't remember if the actual performance of The Cure was any good in this show, because the quality of the filming was unwatchable, and that is the only thing that has stuck in my head about it.  Nil poi!
B006UG909U|3.0|Van Halen's new album A Different Kind of Truth is possibly Van Halen's weakest effort with David Lee Roth.<br />Before I go on about the review, I must say I love most of Van Halen's output ever since I got my first Van Halen album in 1983 out of Diver Down so I like the classic lineup of guitarist Eddie Van Halen, drummer Alex Van Halen, lead singer David Lee Roth and bass player Michael Anthony. I also like the albums with Sammy Hagar (1991's For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge was the best from that lineup with 5150 a close second then Balance then OU812) but I admit that 1998's ill-fated Van Halen III with Gary Cherone was bland. For the record I also enjoy Chickenfoot (which is Sammy Hagar and former Van Halen bass player Michael Anthony's current supergroup) so I'm not biased. Back to the new album, I literally had no expectations about the album at first as this was the first album without Michael Anthony (whom was fired by Edward Van Halen for him working with Hagar whilst guitarist Eddie dealt with his demons such as his relapse into alcohol and substance abuse, his divorce to wife of 20 years Valerie Bertinelli (they had their son Wolfgang who is currently Anthony's replacement) and fight with cancer). Plus reading Ashlee Simpson/Kelly Clarkson/Lindsay Lohan/Michelle Branch producer John Shanks (ex-guitarist for Melissa Etheridge during her mid-1990s heyday) was to produce turned me off. Luckily his role was reduced to co-producer so his AutoTuned junk he makes famous on albums by teen pop lightweights such as Kelly Clarkson and Michelle Branch's crapfests wouldn't manifest the music. However, the return of one David Lee Roth after a 27 year absence (not counting the 1996 tunes on Best Of volume 1) was what sold me on the album. A decision which I somewhat regret.<br />The opening \\"Tattoo\\" (which I first thought would be a remake of The Who track from The Who Sell Out) was originally from the band's demos back in the day when it was called \\"Down in Flames\\" (I prefer \\"Down in Flames\\"' lyrics but the music is excellent). I'll stick with \\"Down in Flames\\". Next is \\"She's The Woman\\" which was another 1970s/80s demo reworked and given fresh lyrics. The original 1970s demo was better. Next is another rocker out of \\"You and Your Blues\\" and sounds like classic Van Halen era but with a modern twist. Next is \\"China Town\\" which sounds like something Slayer and Megadeth would come up with but Dave sings with a great melody and no Cookie Monster growl. \\"Blood and Fire\\" starts like it sounds something from an Ashlee Simpson album (thank co-producer John Shanks) and originally was known as the instrumental \\"Ripley\\" and sorry to say \\"Ripley\\" was better. The lyrics are junk. We follow with another rapid fire rocker out of \\"Bullethead\\" which was another 1970s era track which was better in its 1970s state. Next is another rocker out of \\"As Is\\" which at first sounds with its detuned guitars something from a Korn or Slipknot record before it turns into a killer classic rocker.<br />We then have \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll\\" which starts out like \\"Around the Dial\\" from The Kinks with its radio dial tuning before it goes into a stellar rocker. \\"The Trouble with Never\\" is next and is another great rocker. We keep the tempo up with \\"Outta Space\\" which rocks like no other track. Next is \\"Stay Frosty\\" which is at first a sequel to \\"Ice Cream Man\\" and then rocks out in a great manner. We then have \\"Big River\\" which originally known as \\"Big Trouble\\" back on the 1970s Demo. The Demo was better musically and lyrically as this new version was tiring. We then close the album the bland \\"Beats Workin'\\" which was originally known as \\"Put Out the Lights\\" on the 1970s demos. I prefer \\"Put Out the Lights\\" as this new re-working sounds tired.<br />The new tunes which weren't originally recorded as demos between 1976 and 1983 saved this somewhat uninspired effort. I now know this album was pretty bland so my reassessment is 5 stars for the new tracks that were freshly written and 2 for the reworkings of the 1976-84 demos so a 2.5 (rounds out to a 3) for the album altogether. Now make an album with ALL NEW IDEAS AND TUNES. Either that or bring back Michael Anthony to have a real proper reunion.<br />Better luck next time!ritten and 2 for the reworkings of the 1976-84 demos so a 2.5 (rounds out to a 3) for the album altogether.

B005ELZKWS|5.0|Chickenfoot's second album, jokingly titled, Chickenfoot III was released in September of 2011.<br />I must admit before going further, I hadn't listened to much of Chickenfoot's music as I was busy building other bands' collections (either that or replacing albums that I sold due to the financial problems) but I finally bought the new album by Chickenfoot which comprises of Red Rocker and ex-Montrose/ex-Van Halen singer Sammy Hagar, ex-Van Halen co-founder/bass player/harmony singer Michael Anthony, guitar wizard Joe Satriani and Red Hot Chili Peppers skinbashing drummer Chad Smith. After the unexpected success of their self-titled first album (which I've yet to buy but am working on it and liked what I heard), the band went back in the studio to record its second album which I actually purchased simultaneously with the new Van Halen album. What is my assessment, read ahead and find out.<br />We open the album with the hard driven catchy kick*ss rocker \\"Last Temptation\\" which is driven by Satch's dynamic guitar work. Next is the catchy and poppy but excellent \\"Alright Alright\\". We follow with a mid-tempo power ballad out of \\"Different Devil\\". The highlight on this is the harmony vocals of Michael Anthony which is sadly missed now in Van Halen. We then have a heavy riff rocker out of \\"Up Next\\". \\"Lighten Up\\" follows and the intro guitar riff sounds like an organ riff that Jon Lord would have come up with in Deep Purple and goes into a great rocker.<br />Another brilliant mid-tempo \\"Come Closer\\" follows which speaks of the hardships relationships have. We then have another great stellar rocker \\"Three And A Half Letters\\" which is the anthem for the down on their luck. This song is a relevant track and speaks to those who are falling on hard times. We follow with the brilliant rocker \\"Big Foot\\" which has a catchy hook and is a great foot stomper. We then have the excellent \\"Dubai Blues\\" which starts with excellent musicianship out of Anthony, Smith and Satch. We close with \\"Something Going Wrong\\" which is an excellent song that starts out with the acoustic guitar going before it picks up nice.<br />The CD has a hidden track which is called \\"No Change\\" which is an ode to the government on how \\"the powers that be\\" keep fooling everyone. This is a killer rocker with a catchy riff. I know many will gripe about the lyrics but they are true.<br />Chickenfoot III is a superb album which is a musical breath of fresh air in this American Idol/scantily clad Barbie doll/poseur hip hop music scene. Also the album are is excellent and the 3-D art is one of the more unique album designs I've seen in awhile. It also comes with a DVD on the making album and is an excellent CD.<br />RECOMMENDED!ng Going Wrong\\" which is an excellent song that starts out with the acoustic guitar going before it picks up nice.

0525478817|5.0|I highly recommend this young adult novel for it's wry humor, honesty, and gut-wrenching plot.  If this doesn't make you appreciate your health and long life, nothing will!  One of my ninth-grade students (boy) was reading this at the same time I was.  We both were in awe!  One romantic scene in particular might offend conservative parents, but it's nothing most kids haven't seen on TV.
1463514581|5.0|This book was simply fantastic!  The story drags you in from the first line and never lets you go.  My adrenaline got going with this one and didn't stop until the very end.  The excitement and plot twists are well made so that they are fun and exhilarating.  Rose is a fabulous character - a mixture of the innocence of a young girl with the maturity of an adult.  She is sweet, naive and determined to break free from her past.  Joe is an enigma and you go back and forth with Rose and if you should trust him or not (though you want to).  Their interaction, though a bit steamy at one point, is wonderful and sweet and curls your toes.  there were so many great lines and expressions that I was laughing half the time at the quirkiness of the writing.  A great mystery, romance and adventure all rolled into one.  I highly recommend this one.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|While a slightly different kind of book for Stephen King - it is among his best stories.  It is one I fully expect to see on the big screen.  Two errors I discovered (and he freely admits to taking license with some events in the afterward): first saying anything about Carter's liver pills in 1958 is a bit out of place - I expected it to come back as a forshadowing event with another character and another rabbit hole; second, the moon was a new moon on 18 Nov 1963, not 3/4.  I looked it up because I do those kinds of things just to see how deep the research was.  No doubt a great deal did go into this book and I learned a lot about many of the characters and events that lead up to 11/22/63.  In the end and neither of these errors detracted from a great story which I had trouble putting down.
B000001FI7|5.0|This album does a wonderful job at creating an atmosphere.  You can close your eyes and picture the hazy bar/lounge.  The singer in the silky, sequined dress croons out song after song as the bar's few patrons hunch over the small tables - a glass of scotch in their hand.  Easily in my top 50 all time albums, I still listen to this masterpiece on a regular basis.  I enjoy Portishead's other two albums, but this one is in a class by itself.  No question it is better than 99.9% of the stuff being released today.  If you are reading these reviews wondering whether or not you should buy this, I can't recommend it more highly.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This is one of the greatest shows EVER!  It has action, drama for your mama, and ridiculous story line.  It's greatest asset is all the characters it has to look into, which it does.  Season 2 is more of the same.  However season 3 seems VERY weak without the main actor Andy Whitfield as Spartacus and the backdrop of the gladiator games not a centerpiece of the story.  Anyhow, the first and second season are nearly flawless in story and entertainment value.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|I haven't been much of a fan of the Dual Shock since last gen, when both Nintendo and Microsoft put out controllers that finally dethroned the Dual Shock as king of the hill(granted Saturn's analog pad was better for some game types) - especially the Xbox's S Controller, which was refined for the 360.  This controller is the answer to all of us who don't like the Dual Shock for any number of reasons: the weight, small size/shape, analog placement, triggers... all the best parts of the 360 controller have beeen made compatible for those of us who play primarily on 360 and for PS3 only owners looking to switch it up.  The controller feels almost the same as the 360 controller; roughly the same shape and around the weight of the wired 360 controller, so it's a little heavier than the DS3. It has neat crosshatching texture on the grips and a smoothy, soft rubbery feel on the whole controller; it's very comfortable to hold for extended play.  The analogs are reversed, with the left in the promary position where the d-pad is on the official controller, and the analogs have the dish shaped tops instead of Sony's mushrooms for a bit better grip and control. The L1/L2's are pretty much as squashy as the DS3 set, but the L2/R2 are much improved, and are now wide triggers, which is great, since most people with the Dual Shock will tell you you need to buy those little addon triggers to make them tolerable.  Unlike the wired version by Power A, this one has SixAxis, so that's definitely a plus if you have games supporting it. I tested it with Uncharted 1 and Trash Panic, and it works well.  As for the dead zone issues, maybe it's more apparent for people who play FPS, but I don't and had no aiming problems playing through Uncharted 2 on Crushing mode or with any other games like Yakuza 3 or Final Fantasy XIII-2. I would read other reviews if you are really concerned, but honestly the dead zone seems about as much as the 360 controller it's based on.  The charge lasts a really long while before you have to plug it back up, but the cord they give you is really long, so playing while it's charging isn't a big deal either.  Overall, I do think it's better than the Dual Shock, and it's cheaper too. If you're looking for a good alternate analog controller, this is the one to check out.

0312641893|5.0|Review Courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales<br /><br />Quick & Dirty: Not your average fairytale. Quick and easy read. You'll enjoy it, I promise.<br /><br />Opening Sentence: The screw through Cinder's ankle had rusted, the engraved cross marks worn to a mangled circle.<br /><br />The Review:<br /><br />Welcome to the world of the future, and things are a bit different. After two more world wars, the countries have been conglomerated into fewer but larger empires, and are again ruled by a monarchy. In this time frame, the world's people are also again fighting against a viral pandemic. It seems that a new form of the plague is touring the globe, taking everyone it infects. Interesting twists are put on what the symptoms are and where the contagions originated.<br /><br />We have also learned how to construct true to life cyborgs, and we didn't even need the help of the Borg. Yes, I do know that statement dates me a bit, and pretty much makes me seem geekier. Live long and prosper.<br /><br />Oh, and I forgot one more major thing. There is a whole separate race of people living on the moon. A people who come complete with \\"magical\\" powers and a ruler who puts Hitler to shame. And now she wants to rule the Earth.<br /><br />In the city of New Beijing resides, Cinder, a some-teen-year-old female cyborg. I know it says her age in the book, but I can't seem to find it again. Anyway, Cinder is the local fixit girl, so good even the Prince has heard of her. And the rest of this story gets really hard to tell without a ton of spoilers. So I will only say that Cinder meets the prince, and after a few minutes spent together, they fall madly in \\"like\\". There is also another major story arc involving the plague and Cinder's being forced to be a subject in cyborg testing of vaccines, in search of a cure. And finally, the Lunar Queen shows up and there are conflicts surrounding her presence and her terms regarding a peace agreement between the Earth and the Moon. For the rest of the gory details, read the book. It'll do you good.<br /><br />Following along with the traditional fairytale line, Cinder has the usual name(ish), the evil stepmother, two stepsisters (one not so evil) and similar duties, and let's not forget Prince Kai. Not so traditionally are the plague, the deaths and the whole biological family storyline, which mixes in a bit of the tale of Anastasia.<br /><br />It's nice to take in the occasional YA novel. Keeps my speed-reading muscles limber. I literally went from beginning to end in one session of preschool...2.5 hours. That is also a testament to how good the storyline was and how well it was written.<br /><br />By no means am I a YA connoisseur, but I did indeed enjoy this book. And I call dibs if we get the privilege to review the coming titles.<br /><br />The Lunar Chronicles Series:<br /><br />1. Cinder<br /><br />2. Scarlet<br /><br />3. Cress<br /><br />4. Winter<br /><br />FTC Advisory: Macmillan provided me with a copy of Cinder. No goody bags, sponsorships, \\"material connections,\\" or bribes were exchanged for my review.e traditional fairytale line, Cinder has the usual name(ish), the evil stepmother, two stepsisters (one not so evil) and similar duties, and let's not forget Prince Kai.

B004XZ99LO|4.0|Very interesting and entertaining, I think for young people is a good distraction, have a clear picture on BD but I think that the presentation is a bit short for what you pay for.
B006UG90RM|4.0|Why not a 5 star rating?  A 5 star rating to me is reserved for top stuff that defines a genre during an era.  This does not define a genre like lets say VHI, but it is still a very strong effort.  DLR's range has dipped and regressed but Kobe Bryant has also regressed as a basketball player.  It happens and is a part of aging.  There is not any bands from the original VH era that have put out something compared to the height of their careers.  So, why expect it?  These guys are not 20 anymore just like you all.  Get over it!  The effort still shows that they can be compared to many today and have outperformed most from their original era.  I am impressed enough with Eddie Van Halen and rate him up their with my all time favorite guitarist, Michael Schenker.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a reading app for the Bible.  There are many versions from which to choose.  I began a one year reading plan at the first of the year.  The selections are presented to me and all I have to do is read them.  While I am reading them in my private devotional time, I put my earbuds in and LISTEN TO THE WORD AT THE SAME TIME!!!  I have read through the Bible for many years, but this is the first time I have been able to read it and listen to it together.  It has been awesome!  I cannot express my appreciation in words for this phenomenal experience.  The Bible program works wonderfully on both my Samsung Android phone and my Kindle Fire. Thank you,YouVersion, for this incredible experience.
0446547654|5.0|I thought the book was excellent !  A fast read! I didnt want to put it down.  I loved the story!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this version is more comprehensive that it helps me understand a little better what I am reading. I can also down load a version a take the tablet to church instead of lugging my old bible .

The Tapered Diamond rod sharpened my Ka-Bar(US ARMY VERSION, 7\\" Blade) serrations in the same amount of time and those are RAZOR SHARP.Do yourself a favor pick  this item up, you wont regret it.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|Doesn't really work for every space. For some games it works well but for others, you need to take it off. I haven't used it since I've taken it off of the kinect. With this product, the Kinect still struggles to see your entire body. If you have a small area to play in, I suggest you find a bigger room instead of buying this.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Van Halen is one of my favorite bands of all time. To say that I wasn't thrilled when I heard about this reunion would be an understatement. Then I heard Tatoo, and I thought that song was good, not great, but I liked it. That song doesn't reflect what the rest of this cd is all about. This cd absolutely kills and it never stops from beginning to end. I wouls rate this album higher than 1984 and defintely Diver Down. All I know is that I've been waiting 16 years since they released those 2 new songs off the Greatest Hits package for new material and I am thrilled with the results.  Also, I think this is 10 times better than any album they put out with Slammy Hagar (slammy for continuing to bash the band after he's been out of the group for a few years). And Wolfie kicks butt on the bass guitar as well.  If you're a fan of Van Halen then this is a must have. If you like kick a$$ rock music then get this as you will not be disappointed.  Van Halen is back and so is great rock and roll!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|It does everything I need it to do: highlight, notes, underline, and countless others. And it was pretty cheap. I was very nervous about getting this but it works. I use this app in place  of the three binders of journal articles i would have had for grad school and this is the primary reason that I got a Kindle in the first place.
B00466HM28|1.0|Aside from being a cheap, relatively easy to use MIDI controller, I found that the MPK Mini was, well, awful. The pads are unresponsive, the MPK Editor software it comes with looks like it is straight out of the early 90's, AND its nearly impossible to correctly map every parameter you wish to control to the knobs. If you just want a glorified keyboard, go ahead and get this. But if you wanted to buy this for the CC and Pads, I advise you to please look elsewhere. I owned this for a week before returning it, and instead I am now a proud owner of a Korg mikroKontrol :3
0307957934|5.0|I began reading this book on a plane trip and couldn't put it down. Not only was it exciting with intrigue and action but the details describing the settings of the action left me with vivid visualizations.  The descriptions of the hedge fund and trading strategy turned the world of investing and an algorithm into a living entity. The book was entertaining and thought provoking following the most recent world financial calamity.  It struck me that there is the potential that we are building an algorithm that will run the economy and just like the Titanic, we may all sink when it hits the proverbial iceberg.

B006UG90RM|5.0|The King is Back! I have listened to this a few times and I am very impressed and yea surprised. I was worried that they would tarnish whatever reputation they had left with the VH army. I am a huge fan, following them from the early eighties.(i was about 10 when my parents had them on 8 track) A different kind of truth is funny, catchy, and rocks hard. The guitars alone is worth the price of the disk. A Van Halen disk that has some bottom end to it. You can hear wolf in the mix, it is a pleasant surprise. He has came along ways in a short time. Alex is fantastic too. The songs rock hard. Elements of classic VH all through this CD. Dave voice is good he has lost a little on the high end, but makes up for it with whit and enthusiasm. I can't believe how good A Different Kind of Truth is. Buy it!

I don't parent like the French folks in this book. It still was interesting to get another culture's take on parenting. I do appreciate they tend to be better at keeping their priorities in line, even if some of their priorities aren't my priorities.  If you are easily offended or can't handle people doing things differently than you, you might want to skip this book. I enjoyed it.

Suzanne Collins has written a page-turner that combines the best of each:  action, fantasy, and commentary on modern society.  I finished the book in just a few hours and I can't wait to start the second book in the series tonight!
B006UG90RM|5.0|first let me say... i was a bit worried w the pop type tatoo song.  have the album now... have 'bout a dozen listens today.  wow...  this album melts my face off.  bullet head is actually one of my least favs. btw, i cant understand a few of the pro reviews stating roth has lost some of the pipes... i just dont hear it that way and i actually feel the honesty, power and soul in all songs.  last, i am officially done w the mike anthony debate.  after this session (btw, the kid is singing the harm highs on this record), mike is not even qaul'd to be this kids bass tech at this stage of the game... best bass lines captured on record since steve smith... and i now enjoy tatoo.
B0061QD82E|5.0|RATING FOR FILM NOT TERRIBLE NON RELEASE OF DVD PACKAGE  The beloved 1955 film.  Have always loved the film, great music and of course the famous scene from the film.  I have been complaining about this since Disney started this-NOT putting their classic films out in a straight DVD release the same time as the blu ray.  Hey Disney, 1. I can NOT afford more expensive blu-ray discs & 2. I can NOT afford a blu-ray player  I so hope  Disney looses sales again because of this.  Since the film begins and ends at Christmas so why wasn't this film released in November or December for holiday purchases?  You are forced to buy this when you only have a DVD player & you get NO EXTRAS so you have a blu ray disc Frisbee.  Completely useless and a huge waste of your money.  Disney-some people can NOT afford blu ray players or more expensive discs, so RETURN TO RELEASING DVD'S.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is very light weight, and fits the kindle fire perfectly!! This shell casing is exactly what I hoped it would be.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Challenging, fun, exciting. Not the most fun game, but for being free, its pretty cool. I'm just picky :) Worth downloading
B004JHYRP4|3.0|I enjoyed the first part, but just as the action started to pick up it ended. I was really disappointed at this point.  The alien race in the second part is so dramatically different from our own that it is definitely very original. However, despite the interesting alien race, I found this part of the book really tiresome as for the most part it revolves around alien sexuality. Once again, just as the action started to pick up this part of the book ended. I have to say, though, that I really liked the ending of this part. It really makes up for all the boring stuff in this part.  I think the third part has the most action, but again not really captivating enough.  Overall it is an interesting read given the idea of the energy generation by means of material exchange with a parallel universe and a dramatically different alien race, but it doesn't have enough action for my taste.
B006BZ8WAI|5.0|I really liked Korn's newest album, The Path of Totality. They're back in their element. Korn has always been at their best when experimenting, taking their instantly recognizable sound and mixing it with another genre. That's one of the reasons why Follow the Leader was such a great album, along with Issues and perhaps See You on the Other Side. Korn's first two albums, Korn and Life is Peachy, more displays their individual sound by itself (Life is Peachy straying more torwards experimentation with songs like Wicked and Low Rider).  However, their last album, Korn III: Remember Who You Are, I can honestly say I wasn't a fan of. I enjoyed the music nonetheless, the years of music experience shining through complicated slapping and vocals,but the entire album was basically catering to 'Old Skool Korn Fans'. Now, these 'fans' seem to be a group of people who tend to prefer the first and second albums, and ONLY those albums, so much so that they bash any and everything else Korn makes. I don't consider these people to be fans at all, if anything they're haters. But, for 'loyalty' (like there was any loyalty there), Korn tried to come out with an album that these 'fans' would enjoy. AKA, attempting to recreate the emotions and sounds they had nearly TWENTY YEARS AGO. I actually enjoyed Untitled more than Remember Who You Are.  Now, as for The Path of Totality. Some people may not know that this started out simply as an IDEA, and the group thought at most they would make it into an EP. However, over time, they met more and more dubstep artists who wanted to play with them, made more and more friends, more and more songs, and had more and more fun. And, before they knew it, they had 13 (11 for the none-special edition) songs on their hands when they were aiming for around 5-6. At that point, they couldn't really consider it an extended play anymore. THAT'S how albums should be made, not from trying to cater to people, but from artists actually enjoying what they're doingand are passionate about it.  Almost every song is unique because most every song has a different dubstep artist in it. They all have that original, recognizable Korn sound to it, since Korn IS in every song, but it's great to hear what the other artists do with that sound. These dubstep artists include Skrillex, Noisia, Excision, and Downlink (along with Kill the Noise and Datsik if you get the special-edition with the two extra tracks).  All in all, I really like the album, definitely rate it five stars, and I'm STILL listening to it (I love Way Too Far, Korn REALLY experiments with that song).
B002N3GD8K|5.0|Nothing like some vintage Madonna (along with some new Madonna) on vintage media.  It's a great deal for a 4 LP vinyl set!
B005DOKK7Q|4.0|I originally bought this for my fire.  I decided I wanted something different for the fire and started using third for my touch.  I have a. Leather lighting cover inky touch and worried about it getting sratcher when I put it in my bag, so I putitin this case.  It iseasy to access and fits well in my bag. Glad I bought.
B004I1WIWU|5.0|It's Adele!  Not much more needs to be said.  It's a great album which I already had a digital copy of but thought would sound even more awesome on vinyl and I was right, it sounds great on vinyl!
B002OMZTSK|5.0|What a great book! I couldn't stop reading once I started. If you're looking for a great portrayal of a gay teen struggling to come out, this is definitely it.<br /><br />I especially liked how the romance played out between the two guys. This isn't one to disappoint!
B0039TD7PY|1.0|I won't never buy another James Taylor album or concert ticket.  Bought tickets for show in Louisville KY Spring 2011.  Was supposed to be James Taylor.  Then it was advertised with special guest Ben Taylor.  Then the Louisville Palace sends out email week of the show saying Ben Taylor will actually be appearing throughout the show.  James starts show.  Does one song.  Then Ben Taylor comes out.  He stays out the entire duration of the show.  2/3 of the show was him singing his songs.  The other 1/3 was duets on James tunes.  We got 7-8 James Taylor songs and only a couple JT only.  Fans in upper deck where howling and extremely agitated by the time it was over.  Huge mis-advertisement of event.  Didn't pay nearly $100 a ticket to see Ben Taylor.  He's actually not all that great anyway and most fans weren't familiar with any of his songs.  Total disappointment and can never go to another show.  No way to know for sure what you're paying for.  And I'm a huge JT fan.  This is painful.

B005QJZ5FA|3.0|Lana Del Rey was 2012's it girl well before the release of her debut record, \\"Born to Die,\\" all thanks to the lead single \\"Video Games.\\" Coming in at number twelve on my list of the best tracks of 2011, Del Rey's beautiful yet dry delivery on \\"Video Games\\" seemed to provide a unique commentary on today's society.<br /><br />Backed by a lush orchestration, the song took the world by storm and earned millions of plays on sites like YouTube months before the album's release. Del Rey even became the first artist to perform on Saturday Night Live before the release of their debut album since Natalie Imbruglia in 1998.<br /><br />Lana Del Rey has two key vocal styles; a deep, soulful voice and a high-pitched whisper worthy of bubblegum pop. Before \\"Born to Die\\" hit the shelves, three singles were released on the internet, \\"Video Games,\\" \\"Blue Jeans,\\" and the title track \\"Born to Die,\\" which each displayed an equal balance of both of these styles. Combined with her natural physical beauty, she painted the perfect picture of a marketable artist.<br /><br />To say that \\"Born to Die\\" was a highly anticipated record would be an understatement, but the real question became whether or not the album could live up to the hype.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the answer is no.<br /><br />The three singles already familiar to early fans are easily the three best songs on Del Rey's 12-track debut. In fact, there isn't another song that comes close. Suddenly Del Rey's apparent honesty is replaced with a blatant materialistic mindset. \\"National Anthem\\" sheds the light on Del Rey's real driving force: Money.<br /><br />Once Lana Del Rey gets her quality material out of the way, she dives into a sea of tracks that seem to repeat \\"I'll love you forever even though I know it's a bad idea\\" in as many different ways as possible. \\"Diet Mountain Dew\\" laughably repeats this motif. By the time \\"This is What Makes Us Girls\\" seems to imply that skipping school, drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon, and stealing police cars while always looking her best is really who she is, Del Rey has lost every ounce of credibility she had originally earned.<br /><br />It is truly a shame when an artist with as much potential as Lana Del Rey falls this short of expectations, but \\"Born to Die\\" mostly takes away from the lasting impact of the music we've already heard. \\"Video Games\\" is still a phenomenal recording worthy of continued praise and both \\"Summertime Sadness\\" and \\"Dark Paradise\\" do offer glimpses of future potential, but fans expecting an album of the year contender will likely be greatly disappointed.<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Video Games\\"s, Del Rey has lost every ounce of credibility she had originally earned.

B00127RAJY|2.0|I'm currently on day 24, level 3.  I did 10 days of Level 1, 10 days of Level 2, and now 10 days of Level 3.  I typically followed Natalie (who does the unmodified versions of the workouts), and used proper form during all the exercises.  The workouts are intense, especially since Jillian doesn't let you rest in between reps and sets.  I definitely was breathing heavily, sweating, and turned red after the end of the 20 minutes.  After about 5 days, I noticed an increase in my strength and my muscles felt more toned.  However, after 24 days, I have only lost AT MOST 3 pounds, and have lost 0 inches from my waist, hips, arms, and legs.  I'm sure it's quite possible to lose 20 pounds if you start it being many pounds overweight.  However, I'm only about 5-10 pounds overweight for my height.  I feel to promise to lose 20 pounds in 30 days is a bit of a stretch.  I have not been following the Jillian Michaels diet, but I have been on a diet for the duration of my workout plan.  I have been eating very healthy and drinking more water.  I like Jillian Michaels workouts, and she is very motivational, but this workout is very hard on your joints, particularly, your knees.  There's a lot of jumping and hard landings on your knees.  I've noticed that my knees have begun to hurt, which I've never had problems with them before.  Although I am pleased with the workouts in the moment, and my strength has increased, I'm a tad disappointed that my clothes aren't fitting even a little bit looser.  I wouldn't mind if I didn't lose weight, as long as I lost some inches and my jeans fit better.  Sadly, that hasn't been the case for me.

B00004WNTV|5.0|This and of course the Blue companion album are mainstays in my audiophile collection.  The clarity of the sound is from another planet compared to any CD of the Beatles I own, including the way overhyped new box set on CD released in 2009.<br /><br />Whenever I want to laugh at the sad state of audio affairs in this post-modern world I simply run this through the wash on my VPI record cleaning vacuum cleaner and plop it on my reference grade turntable with moving coil cartridge.  The sonic quality peels away years of aural fatigue and all the cobwebs vanish.  It is as though the sun comes out just for ME, haha.  I can only wait for a day when ALL Beatles product sounds this good...<br /><br />The only Beatles I have that gives it a run for the money is the re-mixed VINYL \\"Yellow Submarine.\\"  That one actually improves on history having been rebuilt from the ground up using fresh mixing technique and is re-assembled from the original vocal and instrument tracks.  And it is at least as clear as the Red and Blue.<br /><br />It seems weird that one has to get on the vinyl bandwagon just to source high fidelity Beatles.  But I don't run things on this old planet.  POWER TO THE PEOPLE, RIGHT ON...  haha.

0385528752|5.0|I'm an avid reader and I'd consider this one of the best books I've ever read.  The Heath brothers dive into the psychology of change and break it down it various components.  They talk about how real, lasting change comes from both emotional and rational desire to change.  They also discuss the impact of environment and how simple changes in one's surroundings can have a dramatic impact.  The authors use wonderful examples and they sprinkle their analysis with humor, charm, and statistics.  They give examples of changes made to one's personal life and changes made to large societies, including one example where behavior was changed throughout Tanzania.  The book offers easy-to-understand explanations that may seem like they should be obvious, but they're not.  Most people have no awareness of why they succeed at some attempts at change and yet fail at others.  I highly recommend this book for everyone!  Who doesn't want to change something about themselves or their society?  The Heath brothers nailed a very important topic in this book.
B0068RHGJM|3.0|Dark Passion Play II? Highly bombastic and very forced. Seems as if they need to really push the symphonic elements upon us more and more in every new release. Yes it is good. Yes, nobody does it better. But come on and stop forcing it! I love Nightwish and I am by no means a hater. But seriously people, buy What lies beneath by Tarja. WAY better album.
B0072OFM28|5.0|Depends on how you look at it. Gods was really Season 0.5 and set before Blood and Sand. So although it was memories of a life in the dyeing seconds of Blood and Sand, it was also the prologue.
B001F12J48|2.0|When I ordered 3D Polar Express movie, I assume it was a movie for a 3D TV.  It was a format to wear paper 3D glasses on a regular TV and very disappointing because it was a gift for my sister.  With confusing electronic technology these days, a clear description would be a better way to describe the product.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Thank you so much for this app!  What a huge blessing it has been.  I especially love the Plans as they keep me on track with my daily reading.
0151003084|5.0|I love Edward Gorey's humor. For some reason I'm running behind on my Gorey reading and was so pleased when I came across this gem at a local used book sale. In this 'novel' Edward's children, the tinies, meet dreadful ends in alphabetical order. If you are a Gorey fan, you'll love the macabre humor!<br /><br />Some of my favorites include:<br /><br />\\"F is for Fanny sucked dry by a leech.\\"<br />\\"B is for Basil assaulted by bears.\\"<br />\\"U is for Una who slipped down a drain.\\"<br /><br />Unfortunately I cannot include the illustrations with the quotes, but they are meticulously drawn and are as funny as the words.<br /><br />If you enjoy this type of humor, you'll love this book!
B000002W4V|5.0|There was a popular radio DJ in the seventies in New Haven that ended every show at midnight playing Intro/Sweet Jane. It was before Clear Channel and guidance dictated what one heard on the radio. DJs played what they wanted. The jock's name was Stoneman and it being the seventies I usually did hear it stoned. It was a great album then and it holds up well. This CD version doesn't compare well to the original LP's warmth, or maybe I should go smoke a doobie for old times sake. It's really good music.

0823015033|5.0|I must say WOW why didn't I buy this book before!  I always passed this book up because of the cover, but don't let that fool you.  While I thought it was about sculpting fairies it's more like a sculpting anatomy book. It's lay out is almost like a text book (but in a good non-boring way) and there are tons of images to help with building the sculpture. There are a very few things tho that I've seen better techniques on but only a few, remember this book did come out in 2008, so there are somethings that are \\"dated\\" and there are some clays that are not listed that have come out sense then (Living doll, ProSculpt, etc).  This book however I would say is not for the beginner looking to make \\"cute\\" things from polymer clay but for artist looking to create (Like the title says) realistic human figures.
B006UG909U|5.0|This CD rocks from beginning to the end. The more you listen to it the more it will grow on you. Give it a chance and you won't be sorry. The Mighty Van Halen is back. Please do a decent concert dvd with Dave.  The Wolfman is doing a great job on Bass. Make more music please.
B005RYF5JA|2.0|This DVD was completely dissapointing.  This from a Celtic Woman fanatic.  The songs lacked any rhyme nor reason.  I listen to all of their other DVDs on a constant basis during any relaxing moments.  Enough that I'm probably an expert.  Was looking forward to seeing them for the first time at an upcoming local concert, but will not be attending due to poor music selection on this DVD.  Beleive me, this hurts...
B005LAIGOQ|4.0|In the early 1900s, young lawyer Arthur Kipps (Daniel Radcliffe) is sent to a remote village to go through the papers of a recently deceased old woman. He finds the villagers oddly hostile, but sets about his work in the woman's creepy, old house. There, he begins to unravel the story of a mysterious woman believed to haunt the place.<br /><br /> If you're looking for a scary movie, look no further. There are scares every few minutes once Arthur starts (stupidly) exploring the house, endlessly going from dark room to dark room while the eerie music and sound effects build to get-ready-to-shriek-levels. The movie has little dialogue, with Arthur alone most of the time just looking for the ghost.<br /><br />This kind of alone-in-the-house part is usually played by a beautiful, helpless, young woman but Radcliffe does a good job, coming off as serious, mature, and fairly brave. If you saw the movie without sound, it wouldn't be nearly as frightening, so a great deal of credit must go to the music and sound effects. Ciar&aacute;n Hinds is good in a rather undemanding, supporting role. The titular character disappointingly resembles a mannequin in a high school haunted house.<br /><br />The movie makes the most out of people' primal fear of the dark and genuine shocks come on a regular (one might say, predictable) basis. I found the movie just a bit unsatisfying, though, because Arthur's character is so wooden and stoic and the story is unrelentingly unpleasant. 3.5 stars.
0757302661|5.0|This amazing book completely changed my perspective on childbirth and pregnancy. I wasn't sure about paying for the classes until I started reading this book and realized how excited I was about this experience. My first pregnancy was with an epidural and was great, but this pregnancy I wanted to take a more active role in the decisions that were made. I am very thankful for this book and the CD that I listened to every night.

B0000AUHPK|5.0|I love this story and have seen most renditions.  This is the best of them all. The acting excellent.  Ralph Fiennes captures the complicated, tortured character from the book.  The music in the film is manificant.  If you love this story, don't miss this version.  It's an unforgetable experience.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|What an amazing book. I have to admit, I was not a big Apple or Steve Jobs fan before reading this biography, but I am now. Isaacson does a great job of telling the story of Jobs life in a dynamic way that holds your interest. You can tell he did a thorough job of interview his subject and a stable of people close to the man. Like Jobs or not, this is a very well done book. A page-turner at its finest.

B0070Z97LG|5.0|I have always loved Daniel Craig since he played James Bond but since then he has showed his versatility. This movie was well-written thriller/horror bc it's like you're in the movie with him. This movie makes you wonder what's real until the end.

B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I heard of Lana Del Rey for the first time on SNL. (I was only watching for Daniel Radcliffe). Honestly, I was not impressed at all with her performance.  However, when I logged onto amazon and saw her album, I figured I should at least check it out. After previewing a couple of the tracks, I went ahead and bought it. And let me tell ya, it was one of the best music purchases I've ever made.  This album is a great alternative from today's hyped-up-techno-pop that is currently playing on the radio. Her songs are much more deep and haunting, but many of them still have sick beats buried underneath.  If you're looking for something happy and upbeat, then this may not be for you. But if you don't mind a bit of a slower pace, you'll love what you hear.  I was pleasantly surprised, and am extremely impressed with this album.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is a nice pocket sharpener. This serves for a quick fix honing, or for more \\"involved\\" sharpening.<br />This is great for knives of low to mid-high quality blades. I have used it to sharpen/hone various knives...ie) Kershaw Ken Onion Spec-Bump, Kershaw Shallot, and my JA Henkels Forged kitchen knives. It has done a good job on all.<br />This does not serve as a replacement for stones though. It is not intended as such.<br />People that have damaged their blades using this item must have been using improperly. The ceramic edge is great for fine-tuning, and the carbide edge really does take off some metal for those tougher jobs.<br />Overall, great little sharpener for under $10.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|A relaxing, but challenging puzzle game can be played anywhere. Excellent to play while traveling or waiting for someone easy to stop and resume game level.
B0051QJ83S|2.0|I really liked Fame and Fame Monster. Both demonstrated Gaga has style, flair, great voice, range, funky songs, danceable yet good melodies.  After seeing the video release for Edge of Glory, I was already surprised at how boring and typical and crappy that song was. Then Born This Way, while I appreciate the positive message, basically rips off the melody of Madonna's Express Yourself (Try singing singing Express Yourself over the music while you play Born this Way).  I'm bummed. I was expecting awesome things from Gaga. But instead, she went from unique melody plus cool style to...low budget anthropomorphic motorcycle and crappy club techno. Overall, BLAH.

B00729GQ0A|5.0|I'm Rebecca Hamilton's biggest fan.    HER BIGGEST FAN.    If Gipsy Kings were a writer, they'd be Rebecca Hamilton.    First off, she's slipstream. Her debut novel, The Forever Girl, is contemporary fantasy fiction, but she mixes aspects of genres too deftly to be easily labeled.    Sophia Parsons lives in Colorado, works at a diner, and has a weird buzzing sound in her head she can't figure out. The religious fanatics of Belle Meadow fear her, persecute her, and have Sophia's own mother on their side. When she meets a mysterious stranger, Sophia sees another world around her all along, and finds power in herself that she had never dreamed.    The Forever Girl has vampires and witches in a current setting with extensive reference to the Salem Witch Trials. Paranormal romance isn't generally on my reading list much, for no good reason. But I Copy-Edited The Forever Girl. And I really enjoyed doing so, initially because of the twisted descriptions. As soon as the town was equated with a clogged artery, I knew I was in good hands.    One writer I still can't help comparing Rebecca Hamilton with is Edgar Rice Burroughs. If you've ever read any Burroughs, you know how he ends a chapter on just the note to pull you into the next one. Every dust jacket has a dozen quotes claiming the book, once opened, just CAN'T be put down. Prrft! This time though, yeah, that's actually pretty accurate.    One of the things I love about fantasy is that focusing on what is not human allows us to see what being human means. The Forever Girl is very much human rights-oriented, and I dig that as much as I do the sensual scenes of brazenly erotic sexual encounter.    Think Anne Rice meets H.P. Lovecraft at a rave.    There's paranormal fightin'!    Jokes n' laffs galore!    But, the one thing that Rebecca Hamilton does as good or better than any writer I've ever seen is get into the heart of her protagonist where feelings are concerned. What Robert E. Howard does with Conan's body, Rebecca Hamilton does with Sophia's heart. The reader sees it, and feels it, because the writer was there.    Rebecca's got the passion of Gipsy Kings in her pen. She's a whole bunch of voices in one, and she sings in an exotic language I love to hear again and again.
B005GHN2GG|5.0|I'm terrible about remembering to review things I read, but I simply must leave a note about Master of Crows. I read this book months ago, and it still stays with me...unusual, given how many books I plow through in a year. For it to stay in my mind, there has to be something truly special about it. The world-building is top notch, the magic system is intriguing, the language is lovely. The conflicts and problems are hard, heavy, and complex. The heroine is interesting, challenging, smart, deep, and possessed of a sharp wit. I just adored Martise! She is the perfect match for Silhara, who is alpha in all the right ways, intelligent, complicated, incredibly hot, and so sweet in his own gruff way. I truly loved this book, and it will be one of the few I buy in paperback in addition to the Kindle version, because it belongs on the keeper shelf.

B006OAB3ME|4.0|All these reviewers who complain that he should have recorded this back when his voice was better, or that he's sold out etc. don't get it at all. Of course Paul knows what his voice is turning into. You could hear the cracks showing on Memory Almost Full, at which time he was wringing the last bits of the old pop sound out of it. That's gone now, and he knows it. This is his answer. He's basically 70 now, and this collection showcases his voice as it is now, rather than as it once was and no longer is. For that it's a lovely gesture.  Of course, many pop stars past their rocking out years resort to collections of standards, and so this isn't new ground. What separates the men from the boys with these kinds of collections is the quality of songs chosen, and here Paul exceeds expecatations, choosing, on the whole, songs which are lesser known but deserve to be remembered. There's not a \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" or \\"Night asnd Day\\" or \\"As Time Goes By\\" to be found here, thank goodness. The selection is top drawer -- classy, and musical. By presenting us with this \\"playlist\\" of his favorites he shows us what great taste he has in these old songs. He's not pretending here, this collection shows he really \\"gets it\\". Bravo.
0802473156|5.0|I wish that this book would have been available when I was raising my children.  I would have had a much better understanding of each of them.  The information found in this book is so valuable.  EVERYONE  should read it.  It will help parents understand their children.  It will help married couples understand each other and will prevent the high divorce rate.  I highly recommend that couples read before they get married.  I have bought this book as part of the wedding present. Whether you are a newlywed or married for 50 years you will benefit from this book.  It will enhance your marriage.  PLEASE PLEASE BUY & PASS ALONG.

0312641893|5.0|For full synopsis see above.  It is 145 years after the fourth World War in New Beiijing. Cinder is a cyborg and a mechanic well known for fixing androids, netscreens, hovercars and more.  Her stepmom and one of her stepsisters are relentlessly mean to her while the other stepsister is her friend.  By chance she meets the prince when he needs his android repaired.  Sadly, the emperor is dying as are thousands of other people as a plague unyet curable sweeps across the nation.  Science fiction is not usually a genre that I am drawn to.  However, once I started Cinder I could not put it down.  It was hard not to visualize Iko and the other androids looking like R2D2 from Star Wars.  The feelings developing between Kai and Cinder did not feel rushed.  I love the fact that Cinder couldn't blush.  Cinder will take her place along side other strong and intelligent female characters such as Katniss, Katna and Kat. While part of me would have liked the story tied up and over with I will patiently wait for book two in The Lunar Chronicles and most likely books three and four.  Marissa Meyer style of writing is appealing and quick paced.  Loved it!  Cinder is a YA book I would recommend it for even the younger end.  Science fiction fans would enjoy it as well as those that enjoy (very fractured) fairy tales.  There is enough romance to appeal to girls that enjoy romance but are willing to try something different.  Read as an ebook arc courtesy of Macmillan Children's Publishing Group via Netgalley.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|It took me a couple of weeks to read this. It didn't grab me at first but halfway through the book I became engrossed in the story and curious to see how it would turn out. The main story for me wasn't the mystery but seeing how my own ideas of how Elizabeth and Darcy turned out after their marriage dovetailed with James'. Fairly nicely I think although the ending did sound a bit Harlequinish.  My main quibble with James, and it is one I have had with all of her books, is that the solution to the mystery doesn't quite add up. The murderer isn't believable in my opinion and, indeed, I wonder about the \\"curb on the dog's grave\\" when earlier in the book it is described as not having a curb--or at least I assume that is what is meant by it being described as not being raised. But maybe I am not picturing the grave correctly. Still the murderer seemed to me to be lacking in the necessary strength.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|I have been a fan of Gigabyte for sometime. I have purchased there products high end and low end a like and have never really been disappointed. This board lives up to my standards. BIOS options are thorough for deep customization. Did have to do some work getting drivers loaded but that's to be expected for newer technology like SATA3 and USB3. Very happy great buy.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm writing this review for the \\"Wool Omnibus\\" even though I read all 5 seperately. When I stumbled across \\"Wool 1\\", I was instantly hooked. I quickly downloaded #2-5 and read them like an addict needing a \\"fix\\"! These books are that good. Well paced and beautifully written. The first installment may be a bit slow and even confusing at times, but the thrill ride picks up steam in #2 and never lets up through #5. I'm now waiting not-so-patiently for \\"Wool 6\\"! I have no idea why these books are priced as low as they are, but they are worth many times more in pure reading enjoyment. In lieu of \\"Wool 6\\", I just downloaded \\"Half Way Home\\" to get my Hugh Howey fix. I predict a bright future for Mr. Howey (unlike the denizens of the Silos).

B0068MNO4S|4.0|As someone who believes that Shakespeare did write his own plays, I am rather puzzled by the outright hostility that ANONYMOUS is receiving in some quarters. Most (but not all) of the negative reviews are from people who cannot get past the central conceit that someone else may have written them. ANONYMOUS never claims to be historically accurate. In fact it is littered with several blatant historical inaccuracies (Shakespeare murdering Christopher Marlowe 5 years after the fact, A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM written by a child of 10, Queen Elizabeth's funeral procession on a frozen river Thames, the Tudor Rose as a flower not an emblem) that make it quite clear that this is intended to be a work of historical fiction. So was SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE but no one got upset over that film at least not to the extent that they have here.<br /><br />What we do have is a major \\"what if\\" scenario that works quite well as an Elizabethan costume drama with some seriously heavy overtones (\\"Delicious isn't it? Right out of a Greek tragedy\\" says Robert Cecil toward the end). Edward Hogg's portrayal of Robert Cecil is outstanding and David Thewlis as his father William is virtually unrecognizable. Kudos also to Sebastian Armesto as a conflicted Ben Jonson. In fact, I found all of the performances to be solid and above average and they kept me interested in the proceedings. The recreation of Elizabethan London is marvelous and shows that CGI can be used to great effect (like glass painting in old Hollywood movies) without resorting to blowing things up. I truly got the feeling that I was actually watching a performance at the Globe Theater especially when the rain began to fall.<br /><br />I should point out that I saw this film in a movie theater on more than one occasion. The last time was with a bunch of college students in attendance. While they knew that what they were seeing was historically false, they still got caught up in the dramatic storyline and were shaken by the final revelation(s) which is what classic tragedy is supposed to do. We had a lovely discussion afterwards, a 60 year man and a group of college students. It was refreshing and invigorating! As stated earlier, I do believe that Shakespeare wrote his plays but in the end it doesn't really matter. The important thing is that we do have the plays and, to quote Derek Jacobi at the end, they \\"shall be remembered as long as words are made of breath and breath of life.\\" For those of you interested in accuracy, check out Michael Wood's 4 hour BBC/PBS special IN SEARCH OF SHAKESPEARE.tion(s) which is what classic tragedy is supposed to do.

B006UG90RM|4.0|First, the short review.  The album is pretty darn good and a lot of fun.  Now the long answer.  I have been a fan of Van Halen since 1984 when I was in junior high.  Just as soon as I was being pulled in, the abruptly break up and usher in the Van Hagar era.  Since then, as much as I liked them, I don't think Van Halen was ever quite the same.  The music was more polished, less raw, and ultimately, less exciting.  The original feeling is finally back, after 28 YEARS.  It is like they never left.  This is not Van Halen's finest album, not by a long shot, but it is not their worst, either, again not by a long shot.  Opinion on this album will be skewed by those of you who like Van Halen versus Van Hagar.  They are both equally good groups, and put out a great ouvieur of music in both cases.  It is just a matter of taste, and my tastes run to the early David Lee Roth days, a rowdier and rawer band.  One that you would expect to see in a seedy club and not an arena.  The music is upbeat and fun, with Eddie's standard amazing guitar wizardry and Alex's thunderous drums.  Wolfgang's bass, while passable, if fine for what it is.  Michael Anthony's bass lines were not exactly complex, so his playind is just fine.  Dave's voice shows a little aging, but he is still Diamond Dave, belting 'em out like there's no tomorrow.  That said, I think you are doing good if you can get three or four good songs out of an album, and they manage to do that in this album.  The highlights for me were:  1. Tattoo-I honestly don't understand why a lot of people are poo-pooing this song.  It is quite good and has a great funky hook to it.  I liked it the first time I heard it and after 20 plays, still like it.  It grows on you.  So don't believe the negative hype.  So what if it is left over from an old song from the early 80s?  It is still good.  2.  She's the Woman-The second track.  This takes me back to a lot of Van Halen's better rockers, ranking up there Everybody Wants Some!, ...And TheCradle Will Rock and Running With the Devil.  Just an all around great rocker with a catchy melody.  3.  Stay Frosty-An interesting departure as it starts being somewhat like an acoustic number and then crashes into a great rocker at the end.  Think Ice Cream Man with a little more funk.  All in all, a good album worth the price, IF you are a fan of older Van Halen fare.  If you liked their newer stuff, you will still probably like it, but you will also be cocking your head to the side a little as well.

0061714402|3.0|Dave Mustaine's book is alternately honest, funny, self-serving and defensive.  In other words, like most autobiographies of someone who has a bit to be proud and embarrassed about.  Dave Mustaine, for those of you who don't know, was the founder of the thrash metal band Megadeth in the early 80s, after being very unceremoniously dumped by the early incarnation of the metal band Metallica, a band he helped form.  To understand Mustaine is to understand what an impact that had on his life and how large that very cruel dismissal had on him.  He has been living, as he admits in the book, in the shadow of it every since.  That said, the book is very self-analytical and critical at times, and at others, very self-defensive.  Even now, almost every decision and every justification he makes seems to track itself back to Metallica. In a way, it is sad.  He has become Ahab, in a way, and Metallica is his Moby Dick.  I am not saying he isn't justified thinking this way, but it is a shame he has not been able to move past it, even now.  30 years is a long time to carry a kernal of anger, jealousy, embarassment and ambition.  On a positive note, this anger has driven him to heights he never thought possible by making and keeping a band together for so long and be a dominant, creative force in his community.  At the same time, it is sad because it will never be enough.  He has seen this and it has manifested itself in any number of bad habits over the years that has literally almost killed him.  He has come out of the worst of it, and he attempts (as much as possible from an autobiographical standpoint) to give you an unvarnished idea of who he is, warts and all.  I find that very brave and commendable.  I also pity him in that it seems he will never be truly happy.  Even if Metallica were to wither and die and he bypass them in every way imaginable, it will always gnaw at him, I think until the day he dies.  The best advice I would say when reading this very entertaining book is to use it as a cautionary tale.  Really, do not sweat the small stuff.  Life is unfair, and we will all have to eat a lot of stuff before we die.  The trick to surviving is to be able to get past it and channel it into something positive in your life.  It seems Dave is on that track now, and I say good luck and God bless to him.

B006OAB3ME|4.0|Everyone knew there was a new McCartney album on the way (his first studio release for 4½ years), but none realised it would be issued so soon after being announced, and it certainly wasn't envisaged to be a collection of personal favourites, two newly written songs and a re-recording of a 33 year old album track. It's available in two versions; the usual jewel case, and a deluxe pack with two extra songs, expanded sleeve notes, three postcards and access to an exclusive live show. An easy listening offering of songs he heard, and was influenced by, during his formative years (and he has chosen many that might not be familiar), the booklet explains how he and John tried to copy these songs. I'm surprised McCartney hasn't done anything like this until now; and another first is that he just sings on this. Then again, maybe he's been planning such a project and only just got round to doing something about it. Joined by Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder, and Diane Krall and her band, who play with the lightest of touches on their instruments.<br /><br />I'M GONNA SIT RIGHT DOWN AND WRITE MYSELF A LETTER. A piano and double bass led jazz tune, this is whispered in fine style in a way you might imagine someone suddenly joining in with the house band. A potential single?<br />HOME (WHERE THE SHADOWS FALL). Maybe the most obscure song included, this is nicely sung in a late-night fireside way.<br />IT'S ONLY A PAPER MOON. An occasional voice straining to reach the right notes doesn't seem to spoil the shortest track that has an effective violin and whistling middle eight. It certainly grows on you.<br />MORE I CANNOT WISH YOU Annoying. Not in a bad way but you just wish it would start instead of sounding like a three minute introduction to something more substantial. But that's the tune itself, not the way it's presented. For my money, the poorest thing included.<br />THE GLORY OF LOVE. Rather intimate this, but then so are all the other songs, one to be sung to your new wife, or a very old one. One thing this CD has going for it is that you can actually hear every word sung, something many are guilty of in their failing.<br />WE THREE (MY ECHO, MY SHADOW AND ME). Delivered in a way only McCartney could get away with, don't be surprised to hear this on Radio 2. Whilst the whole CD is good, this is one I particularly like.<br />AC-CENT-TCHU-ATE THE POSITIVE. A weirdly titled clever tune on antonyms, this is a bit of a toe-tapper that will have you singing the title to yourself. My own favourite.<br />MY VALENTINE. The first of two new original compositions, this is an acoustic and piano track that could actually become a favourite of club supper acts. It sounds plodding at first but it does grow on you. With just the guitar player from the band remaining, you can imagine the spurned lover slumped over the piano, a dying rose and whisky glass on the top, bemoaning his luck to an empty floor. This could be a single, though he needs to be quick about it. Expect cover versions.<br />ALWAYS. I didn't recognise this from the introduction, but when the main body began I was singing along, as will you if you remember it. Once more, the music doesn't swamp the singing.<br />MY VERY GOOD FRIEND THE MILKMAN. More whistling bookends a song about a lovelorn soul tempting his girlfriend to marry him through a variety of others. It's rather cute.<br />BYE BYE BLACKBIRD. The second Beatle to record this (after Ringo in 1970), this is taken at a slower pace but doesn't suffer from that, even though you think it might peter out at some point.<br />GET YOURSELF ANOTHER FOOL. Whilst much of what precedes and follows this track is taken in a laid-back style, this has a far stronger vocal and is another of my favourites. The longest track, the use of the guitar compliments this well.<br />THE INCH WORM. All of those of a certain age will remember this from listening to Junior Choice on the radio. Possibly the biggest surprise on a surprising collection, no doubtit's the Danny Kaye version he remembers and not the one by the cast of Grange Hill. With backing vocalists doing the adding up, it's one of only two songs not to have a full ending.<br />ONLY OUR HEARTS. The other new self penned song; it sits well with the rest of this collection. Sounding as if it was written for Nancy, it's one that might well be covered by other artists.<br />BABY'S REQUEST. Fitting in well, this is taken at a more leisurely pace than the version on 'Back to the Egg' with a good trombone middle. There's an elongated instrumental fading ending.<br />MY ONE AND ONLY LOVE. Another nice tune to be sung at the end of the day when the candles are burning.<br /><br />This is bound to be a decent seller and maybe, given the contents, there will be those that wouldn't normally buy his product delving in because they like this style of music. I was pleased he didn't go down the big band route, but use backing that respects the deliberate understated vocals. If pretenders such as Rod Stewart, Robbie Williams, Michael Buble and others can release CDs of `standards', why not the biggest name of them all? It might be the songs or it might be the way in which they're presented, but McCartney shows he still has the capability to deliver. There may be those who dismiss this as self-indulgent, and maybe that's what it is; Ringo made his `for his mum', so maybe Macca wanted to do this for himself and his wife, and there's nothing wrong with that.

0143119680|5.0|I specifically bought this book for a long plane ride after reading all the reviews and I was not disappointed! Most books (esp. fiction), I generally read a few pages of the beginning to get the context, some of the middle for the plot and then the conclusion. A Discovery of Witches captivated me so much, I actually read all 575 pages!  Can't ever remembering doing that with a 500+ page book.  Even if I jumped ahead at certain parts, I re-read the pages I skipped to be sure I didn't miss anything.  Harkness does a great job drawing the reader in - at times I felt as if I was actually at the Bodleian Library or Ysabeau's chateau.  The intertwining subplots also contribute to the story's complex plot, which includes many historical references (I was intrigued to learn that Elias Ashmole really was a student of alchemy) and multi-dimensional characters.  Many of the book's themes can also be applied to current times.  I picked up a simple, pop-culture nonfiction book after reading this book and just couldn't get into it. Then I realized it was because I had been so emotionally drawn into A Discovery of Witches.  No book was going to compare in the near future.  I can't wait until the 2nd book (Shadow of Night) comes out this summer!
B0060ZJ78U|5.0|This is a great movie - great story and acting.  Love that both DVD and Blu-ray copies are included.  We don't currently have a Blu-ray player but when we get one, we won't have to repurchase the movie.
0897502027|5.0|I have owned this book for years, and I continue to read it still. I have read cover to cover several times and still refer to it periodically. In my opinion, this book is one of the best tools for a Martial Artist. The concepts presented in this book are not only for combat applications either. The ideas and principles can be applied to nearly every aspect of life. Each time I read, I feel I have regained a certain clarity on my Martial Arts practice.<br />Bruce Lee composed these concepts from a lifetime (however short) of dedication and scientific research into the Martial Arts. Everything from his brief introduction with concepts from Zen Buddhism, to his scientific breakdown of the physiological characteristics of a strike, is sheer brilliance. Everytime I read the book, I learn something new about my shortcomings in technique and dedication.<br />Everything about this book demands to be read by any self-respecting Martial Artist. Bruce Lee's contributions to the Martial Arts world continue even after his unfortunate demise. His legacy echoes still.<br />I would recommend this book to anybody with even the slightest interest in the Martial Arts.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I posted a review of this book on my message board,    [...]    This is what I said-    Wow! Just wow!    I saw a sneak of the movie last year and thought it would be an interesting movie to check out. Then this past week I was reminded of it from a preview on a Blu-Ray I rented. So I paused the movie, went to Amazon and grabbed the book........and a new obsession is born.    This is probably the best book I've read in quite a while. And I don't say that lightly, because I've read some fantastic stuff this year including some of the work from some of our fellow Cryptsers.    I won't type out an entire synopsis, but what we have here in The Hunger Games is a post apocalyptic tale of the survival of the fittest story, of both body and mind, but it's also a love story. The combination of which tells me Suzanne Collins is a genius in capturing two genres that normally ignore each other and forcing them to realize how they can work together--meaning horrific dark fiction vs. romance. Don't misinterpret what I just said, there is no bodice ripping here, but it will tug on your heart strings.    And to think, this was published by Scholastic Press! What? Seriously? I haven't read one of their books since I was a kid plenty long ago. I guess I should pay more attention to what they're doing now, eh?    And for my added pleasure, I found out just today that this is a trilogy. I'm hitting Amazon as soon as I finish typing this to get BOOK TWO! :-)    Loved it, loved it, loved it. :-) Can't wait for the movie (or movies?)!!!!!    ~C
B006UG90RM|5.0|As Dave says in the song Blood and Fire , 'I told you I'd be back'.  Van Halen just put every other rock band on notice.  This CD is brilliantly heavy. I don't know who is best on the CD. Eddie is freakishly brilliant with shreds that make sense in the context of the song and not just quick scale runs that every other band does. Unfreakin believable! Slash? Zak Wylde....who?  The man is back,Eddie RULES!!   Alex is an absolute monster on drums. He just never lets up. He pounds you into submission like heavyweight UFC fighter song after song.  Wolfie tightens up the harmonies and lays down some bass playing at a pace that Michael Anthony could only dream of. That kid rocks!   Then there is THE MAN, David Lee Roth. It's about freakin time bro! Thank you lord for no more silly Red Rocker Sammy Hagar. Those were the worst years ever watching Sammy hijack America's favorite rock band. Dave is completely in his element and letting him drive was a perfect decision. Elements of his solo work abound plus all the enthusiasm, wit, wisdom, swagger and donuts you expect from Dave.  Rock Band or Action Heroes? you decide.

B0071T5PN0|5.0|Van Halan was formed before I was born. I don't care about nostalgia. I'm not thinking about how this sounds next to 1984 or Fair Warning or whatever. I just like good music. I also really like Van Halen, and I credit Eddie for inspiring me to take up the guitar.<br /><br />(1) This is not a pop/rock album. This is not U2 or Coldplay or something like that. Tattoo as the first single?? WTF! It doesn't really resemble the rest of the album. That said, Tattoo may be the only radio-friendly tune on the album. Maybe that's why it was picked.<br /><br />(2) This is NOT a \\"reunion\\" album celebrating SUVs and Starbucks. This is a music-centered, guitar-heavy album. Lots of shredding. Energetic drums. Fast tempos. Attitude, energy, cleverness.<br /><br />(3) Makes me want to pick up my guitar and play.<br /><br />(4) This is most probably the heaviest VH album ever...not heavy in that 70s/early-80s way, but heavy in a more modern metal way.<br /><br />(5) I am not a 'deep' enough fan to be familiar with all of the unreleased recordings, some of which I understand they resurrected and revised for this album. I can't tell which are revised old songs and which are the new songs. I don't care, and I don't think its possible to rip yourself off. Frankly, all artists do this, all the way from Bach to my own humble self.<br /><br />(6) This may well be my favorite VH album ever.
0240815807|5.0|I bought this awesome book about a month and a half ago. I knew my music mixing was in trouble. I could never get the overall balance right. There was always too much low-end rumble or high-end piercing somewhere in each song. It didn't matter how much equalization or compression I added to my tracks. I could never get a perfect mix. With Mixing Secrets For The Small Studio. I learned lots of things I never knew or thought about in regards to music production. What things? Things like how to properly use software plugins and hardware that's necessary to achieve the desired tonal balance in your mixes. Tips and tricks on how to tackle problem tracks. There is also plenty of information in Mixing Secrets that benefited me regarding studio monitors (ported and unported) and room acoustic treatments. This book is filled with information such as this that I didn't know or think much about.  Sure you can find tid-bits of music mixing and mastering info here and there on the net. It made more sense for me to get a music mastering education from someone who's been there and done that. Someone who knows that you don't have to break the bank to release  commercial-sounding recordings. It's about getting the software/hardware that you need and knowing how to use it. I don't expect to have any more problems mastering my music once I finish getting at least the minimal  amount of hardware gear that I need. Get this book and save yourself from wasted hours of web surfing that in my experience got me no where. That is until I found and ordered Mixing Secrets For The Small Studio on amazon.

B005MYEQ4U|3.0|A lot of charming actors didn't add up to as much charm as I wanted out of this movie.  Woody Allen doesn't have much to say--and what he did say was better said by Fitzgerald: you can't recreate and live in the past. And his name-dropping in the movie was just as pretentious (and pedantic! overused word) as Michael Sheen's character's.  The characters were caricatures of themselves, though often funny.  Hemingway was a stand-out. Rachel McAdam's character was so nasty and shrewish, you couldn't figure out why Gil (Owen Wilson) would ask her out on a second date, let alone want to marry her. And if SHE wasn't enough to put him off, you would have thought he'd think twice about marrying into that family!  Yes, Paris is beautiful. That's pretty obvious.  And so were Woody Allen's observations in this movie. Probably 2 1/2 stars.

While not as deep in terms of gear, crafting, reputations, and such, Order and Chaos has a very streamlined feel that lends itself well to the minimal approach. There is plenty to do, plenty of people to play with and a lot of fun to be had! You will be surprised how big the world is and how full featured it actually is. Gameloft actively supports this game with updates and content additions. $7 gets you this game and a few months of play time. After that it requires a subscription ranging from $1 to $.33 per month depending on how long you decide to subscribe.  Graphics: 9 Looks great sometimes. Looks good sometimes. Indoor environments look really really good. Outside suffers from some rendering issues and pop up. Still looks good. And is easily forgiven considering how HUGE the outside environment is.  Presentation: 10 Zero complaints. Traditional menus and interface leaves me feeling right at home with OC.  I adore this game. Occasional lag which is forgivable, and minor graphical issues are all that seperate this game from tablet perfection.  Overall: 9.5 Best RPG for Fire.
B004WE01YA|5.0|I bought Beauty and the Beast in 3d for my daughter to see...and it was really great!  I haven't seen it for a while so it surprised me how much I really liked watching this movie again.  The animation is very nice and it is better in 3d than in 2d (in my judgement).  Even thought the 3d is not popping out of the TV (like Despicable me)...it gives a nice dimension to the movie.  Worth the money!
B005DF2QMC|5.0|Right now I am elated!  I was very impressed that I received my tapr player in a timely manner. Then I was so disappointed because I was unable to get it to work.  I emailed tech support my issues and without any hesitation Sam, in tech support wrote that a new device was on its way to me! I received the new one two days later.  My joy was short lived again however, when I had the same issue after installing the new device.  Instead of throwing up my hands in frustration, I emailed Sam in DB Tech support again and asked if anyone could call me for assistance.  Sam sent me his number and told me to call at my convenience.  I did....THE REST IS HISTORY!  Sam was able to identify the issue, which by the way, had absolutely nothing to do with the product but was with the settings on my laptop and remotely fix the issue in less than 5 minutes. I had read the reviews for this product before I purchased it, so I knew it was not considered by others to be sturdy or durable and that the  mechanism was thuoght to be confusing. I purchased it anyway because it fit the budget for my project and I thought I would chance a LEAP OF FAITH. Boy, I am glad I did. For the price, this tape player is a very good value and there is no problem with the quality of sound. I have no problems with this device and if I ever do, Sam is just a phone call away!  I am beginning to believe that a product and company are only as good as the customer service they provide! I will be doing business with DB Tech in the future because they are a company I can trust and rely on. Again, thank you Sam, keep up the good work!
B003NFM3JU|5.0|The 3d in this movie is beyond amazing.  It felt like the story was happening in my living room....I wish there where more 3d movies this good! It really looked like some of the characters where literally coming out of the TV...just awesome!  The snow seemed to fall in my living room.  This is not just a movie, it is an experience!    So far I've also seen (in 3d) Despicable Me, Beauty and the Beast, Harry Potter and Legend of the Guardians...the next best would be Despicable Me...but again...I haven't seen a 3d this amazing besides this movie!  Fantastic purchase...loved it!
B004UID2LC|2.0|I would go to the original and share videos to the file but all that would happen was getting a little bar at the top that says downloading but nothing is actually happening...I don't get it
B0043RSE2M|5.0|I originally bought this movie because of the 3d reviews...but the story line is also great!  The 3d is the best I've seen so far in an animation, some scenes really pop out and look fantastic!  You will fall in love with the Characters...the story itself is warm and funny.  I rate this movie the second best 3d movie I have seen...the first being (A Christmas Carol).  If you are looking for a great 3d movie..this would be it, a great buy!

B0072OFOM6|5.0|Why are they calling this The Second Season?<br /><br />1st ... Spartacus: Blood and Sand<br />2nd ... Spartacus: Gods Of The Arena<br />3rd ... Spartacus: Vengeance<br /><br />????
0307957934|3.0|Richard Harris is an intelligent and sophisticated writer with an impressive range, from Ancient Rome to modern-day Geneva in which computer-driven hedge funds, guided by artificial intelligence manipulate the stock markets of the world.   I was reminded of Franz Kafka's, The Trial: extremely nasty things happen to the main character while he (and we) are left wondering why this is happening  and who is responsible, The answers to these questions do not begin to emerge until we are about three-quarters of the way into the book.I found this to be a little frustrating. This, in combination with a wealth of hi-tech information on the machinations of stock markets, make The Fear Index a disappointment to this Richard Harris fan.  I do believe there is a serious message here. The Charles Darwin quotes regarding the evolution and success of species hint at the vulnerability of the human species in this \\"Brave New World.\\"
B0064NTZJO|5.0|I had been sitting on the fence a while with this one. Been reading the reviews here and the extreme differences over those who either love or hate it told me that there was probably more to it than its surface suggests, still I wasn't sure about buying it. That is, until I'd spoken to this person I know who'd seen it a couple of weeks ago. She didn't really care for it much and this settled it for me until I got a moment of clarity and came to my senses and realized whose opinion I was asking. Her favorite films: Love and Basketball; Madeas (all of them); anything with Mark Wahlberg; Glitter; that new one with 50 Cent; Nicholas Cages' films, etc. In other words, films that drop an F-bomb every five minutes or a film made on a level that a 5 year old can appreciate like Transformers.<br /><br />To make a long story short, after she told me she didn't like this film (Drive) I immediately went out, got it, and fell in love with it. Should've known. Some people you have to go to the opposite of when it comes to taste and when they say they don't like something that's usually a tip-off that it's good.<br /><br />This film is a throwback in that the stars, and not the cars, are the humans and to my eye there are no cgi gimmicks to speak of. I won't get into the plot because that's been done here already but I will agree that the film and its star evoke the same tight, custom-fit, leather racing glove feel as McQueen's Bullit. And like McQueen's character in that film, Gossling in this one is as brooding, cool, and low-key.<br /><br />There's a very brief (but unbelievable) car chase that gives a sly wink to Bullit involving a Mustang and a Chrysler, both newer models. This film does have its share of action but it fits the situations they erupt from. And when I say erupt I do mean that word literally. It's not wall to wall action but it is VIOLENT with a capital V and there's a big difference between the 2. But Drive is not the Fast and The Furious. It's not about the cars. It's about people and hard choices. But it's more than that even. It's not what it's about but how this film goes about it. Look, if your favorite film last year was the Smurfs or Scorpion King 3 you won't like this film. If you can appreciate a film on multiple levels, including story, acting, cinematography, action, etc, and if you liked such films as The American, A History of Violence, and Bullit, then you should have no problem with this film.choices. But it's more than that even. It's not what it's about but how this film goes about it. Look, if your favorite film last year was the Smurfs or Scorpion King 3 you won't like this film.

1595141715|5.0|I'd already read this book before my Amazon purchase but it's worth multiple consumptions. Asher's anti-bullying/suicide theme is portrayed in such a positive manner and I'd recommend this book to anyone, despite its target audience being between the ages of maybe 16-21. Definitely a 'must read' for me, and I'll revisit it again on a later date.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|i think that this game is honestly the best game ever!  This game is easy to play its kind of like a puzzle. Its the BOMB!!!!!!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|When reading the first book the first 100 pages or so are like walking through qick sand. Keep at it. The second book I read in two days and the third in a week. Mesmorizing and page turning. Unlike anything I have read before.  page turner for sure. I cant wait to watch the movie.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I read this book and saw the movie.  I thought that the acting was good and that the storyline was true to the book.

0312641893|5.0|This is a very different look at Cinderella then movie I used to watch as a kid. Much darker tale with plague, Cyborgs, Androids and people living on the moon called lunars. Cinderella, or in this book Cinder is 36.28% not human, she is a cyborg. A second class citizen in the town of New Beijing. Cyborgs are not treated like humans, and in a time of plague, cyborgs are drafted into being guinea pigs for the plague cure. Since they already been given a second chance at life by scientist therefore they owe their existence to those who created them. Something like this happens to Cinder!<br /><br />But, not to get too in depth into this great book. Cinder must make the money for her stepmother and stepsisters by being a mechanic. And, she is good at it too, the best in New Beijing in fact. But things start to take a turn when the plague enters into her personal life.<br /><br />Of course, just like the regular fairy tale, there is a prince. And, a somewhat sort of fairy godmother. I see the doctor as Cinders fairy godmother. Instead of her mice to talk to she has Iko the Android. There is also the Stepmother, and two stepsisters. There isn't a glass slipper, but there is a pesky foot!<br /><br />Really great story with really great characters. Even the Androids have bundles of personality that just oozes from the story. Cinder's android Iko reminds me of Rosey from the Jetsons with her funny personality. Although, the twist in the book can be seen miles away, the storyline itself is so unique that it makes up for it.
B004FOA84A|4.0|this game was fun but to short. I hope there's a Manor 2. enjoyed finding the different objects and than figuring out how to use them.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I am addicted to this game. It is really fun and challenging to play. I spend way to much time playing and have been only frustrated once. I had a problem passing a couple levels. I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B006UG90RM|5.0|This album was definitely worth the wait.  Every song on here ROCKS!!! No love songs here.  Every song gets your blood pumping. If one thing is missing, however, it is the backing vocals of Michael Anthony.  Alex is especially impressive on this album. Overall an excellent album.
B006M4F67A|4.0|I enjoyed playing the game except it doest offer you very many game options. I love to be able to reshuffle the tiles instead of just losing the game. Nice for a free game and for just when you have a couple minutesto play.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|this did not work after I downloaded it on the fire it did not download any videos I hit download for
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible is really nice and gives you different reading options. I the same passage in different ways that are provided which makes it easier to understand some passages that I needed help with. It is very enjoyable to have the Bible so easily available to me. Thank you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really good its pretty nice to have this many games in 1 like this without having to buy them seperately
B005URRCUY|1.0|I enjoy this band and had looked forward to this album. It is a nice album; however, the sound quality is poor. It sounds \\"flat\\" to the ear, and the overcompression is easily evident.  I will be cautious about buying more from this producer.
1932735410|5.0|From first impression, i feel this will be the accurate source for studying the PMP certification. this impression seems right.this book is great if not for preparing PMP certification exam, at least to be as reference for Project Management.  Yes, this is not Rita pure book. their is a modification but not that much and not affecting the information or the way it being sorted. it worth and it really benefit for me. What about you? it is your decision..
B0054JZC6E|4.0|awesome game. I loved it. it rocks my socks. this is for 250000 points. I really hate this game. ..... it sucks
0738711500|5.0|This deck of 78 Tarot Cards has been the most visually effective cards I have seen. Great to look at and easy to learn and use. Can highly recommend them along with the guidance book from Josie Ellershaw. Check out her web-site! Also check out the web-site of the tarot cards designer Ciro Marchetti. Lovely web-site and I downloaded a great wallpaper. I am so pleased with this product and can only suggest that if you are interested in learning more about the tarot...look no further...you have now found the best. May your Guides be with you.
B000W9DSVW|5.0|First off, the trilogy came to me in perfect condition. None of the discs looked scratched, used, or bootlegged. lol.  I've had the trilogy on DVD set before, so watching it in Blu-ray is even better.  Picture is definitely sharper  Sound is awesome (even better with suround sound set up)  Blu-ray features all the extras (plus the convenience of not having to stop the movie to search the menu)  Overall, this purchase is a great value with an unbeatable price. If you like the DVD set, you'll LOVE the Blu-ray trilogy even more.  I definitely recommend this item.
1439181780|5.0|I LOVED this book...I read the Secret and the book was ok..LOVED the video...but didn't love the book as much...so didn't expect huge things from the book but it was EXACTLY what I needed and spoke to me...really good...It was sent to me as a gift and then I sent a friend it too.  Loved it..worth it...it has a power of it's own!
B001HBX8NC|2.0|According to Amazon there is supposed to be several options for subtitles and audio options on this Blu-ray of Rigoletto but when I put the disc in my player, there were only two options, \\"play opera\\" and \\"trailer.\\"  I could not get any subtitles or audio options on my Samsung Blu-ray player.  Because of the lack of audio options, the sound was muddy and bass heavy.<br /><br />The performance was fine but the staging was nothing special.  Because of these problems, I cannot recommend this version of \\"Rigoletto.\\"  Maybe it's a problem with my Blu-ray player but I have other opera Blu-ray discs that work fine, so I am assuming it is a problem with the disc.
B003VANOFY|4.0|This is the best headset you can get on the market and this comes from a person that previously owned a Razer Chacharias. The 7.1 Surround Sound Works great While playing COD MW3 and others games, the wireless range allow me to go to the kitchen and grab a snack while still listening to what people are saying on vent, and with the programmable keys I can even talk to them while there.  The battery last up to about 10 hours, so it gives you a long gameplay time.  The only downside of this equipment is that it does not work on a Mac, it would be awesome if we could use it on both platforms maybe one day.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I completely disagree with most user reviews of this book. I loved the storyline; one of my favorite characters is Cersei, and he devotes ample time to her in this installment. I also enjoyed the Brienne and Jaime sections, I don't see what the issue is. I mean is the Bran storyline that important to you? I admit i missed Tyrion, but I liked the new characters too; particularly the Dornish Princes.  I've read alot of fantasy; The Confessor series, Dune, and all of them lose steam and start becoming increasingly abstract to the point of ridiculous. Martin avoids this by introducing new storylines and developing his characters and plotlines that keep the story grounded and believable. He comes close to Tolkien in his attention to detail and beats him with his wonderful, almost Dickensian prose. Plus Martin fuses real historical circumstances in his plots, such as the War of the Roses, which I love as an Anglophile.  This book is just as good as the three previous, and I wanted to write this to counter some of the negativity in the other reviews. I don't see any of you writing books? Have you even tried-its not easy.
B0018BF1HW|4.0|Both the product screenshot and the back of box show a track 10 (You Know What I Mean) and track 11 (She's a Woman) on Blow By Blow.  Neither my computer, or my Oppo-BDP80, or my car CD player see these tracks.  I'm gathering they don't exist.  Still great price for what you get.
B0053TMP24|5.0|i love rick riordan and the son of neptune was another fine addition to the series. i just cant wait to see how excited percy and annnabeth are to see each other and i wonder what happens with leo and hazel. poor frank.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book is a hard to get into read, I'll admit that. The first few chapters I drug myself through...admittedly mainly because I knew the movie was a big hit and the series itself was huge, so I knew there had to be more to this story. And there definitely is, about the middle of the book the story took off. It was all I could do not to read 24/7. I feel like this is the authors style as the second book is about the same..I'm in the beginning and its just a slow start. But overall a good book. If you can get through the set up of the story its worth it.
B006O5Y0SS|4.0|I like Woody Allen movies, this being no exception. It has the usual interesting, quirky characters and slightly unexpected plot.  Its just the kind of story that Woody Allen does so well.  He also has a real knack for getting the setting just right, whether its a particular place (like Paris or Manhattan) or a period in time.  I personally enjoyed guessing which artists from the 20's would show up, played as we imagined them to be, of course. I found the movie to be visually appealing, funny and heartwarming. I think most Woody Allen fans will agree.
B005O607U8|2.0|The 1st cut is particularly bad.  Mostly just a bunch of noises in the background and then some spoken words in the forefront.  This is music?  Sorry, not as far as I can tell.  The rest of the tracks were OK.  But nothing I'd really much want to listen to again.  I am wondering how this got all the good reviews!  I sure wish I had not spent my money on this.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|vevo is awesome I can watch music videos whenever I want and it works great on my kindle fire so I don't know why it doesn't work for other people
B006UG90RM|5.0|When I heard \\"Me Wise Magic\\" and \\"Can't Get This Stuff No More\\" back in 1996 on the Greatest Hits album I was stoked!!!  Sadly what followed was a huge let down.  Not only did VH NOT rejoin with David but they got the lame idea of having Gary Cherone become the next singer an make the worst Van Halen album ever. Being a HUGE David Lee Roth era VH fan I was crushed.  After hearing for years David was back with the group and Van Halen would be putting out a new album I became very cautiously optimistic,  wondering it it would REALLY ever happen.  Fast forward to a a few weeks ago.  \\"Tattoo\\" is available to listen to...ok, Dave's back and this is ok but NOT what I had hoped for.  Was there any chance the album would be good or just a gimmick to make some cash off some faded glory?  The answer is this is no gimmick, this is 190 grain VAN HALEN...not the watered down Van Hagar stuff nor the flat Gary Cherone crap, this is the VH of the legendary VH, VHII, Women and Children First and Fair Warning masterpieces!!!  Eddie hasn't lost a thing, Alex is still a beast, David is still David and Wolfie brings a youthful energy that makes it almost possible to not grieve over not having Michael Anthony on the album.  Tattoo (in my opinion) is the weakest track on the album.  I actually think it was released as a single because it is a VERY heavy album and not one that would produce many radio-friendly songs...a good thing!  There's many solid tunes on this album but \\"Honeybabysweetiedoll\\"(don't let the name fool you it's HEAVY as in \\"Outta Love Again\\" heavy), \\"Bullethead\\", \\"Stay Frosty\\" (an \\"Ice Cream Man\\" part II song), \\"Outta Space\\" (some of EVH's best licks ever), \\"Big River\\" and \\"You and Your Blues\\" are the standouts.  This is a REAL Van Halen album, not a trip down memory lane.  If you are a fan of the David Lee Roth era Van Halen you will NOT be disappointed!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really love this app!  It makes it so easy to read the Bible. It's also very easy to go from one interpretation to the next by pressing one button. Sharing a scripture is so easy too.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|you love and hate it..... you want to keep playing but the whole time you are asking yourself &quot;why am I still playing this?&quot; But if you are desperate for entertainment this is the game for you
B0058VW36U|5.0|if you have a random box in front of your house what would you do? if you are a person who would open it, this app is so for you.  this app is very addicting game. it's about feeding cute little monster candies.

B005T87QCI|5.0|i have really enjoyed this game alot the only thing i dont seem to understand is where to but Zeus and bots like that
B0041KKYEW|2.0|This is a gem of a movie from a content standpoint, but the DVD version looks better than the Blu-ray transfer, which is consistently very grainy. The film was shot partly in 16mm, so is not quality film stock to begin with.  In short, do not waste your money on Blu-ray for this movie. You will feel cheated. The DVD is as good as it gets.  As an aside, the Black Swan Blu-ray disk also demands (for no apparent reason) that you put a memory card into your Blu-ray player. Doing so makes no difference to what you get for picture quality.
B0060AY6FO|1.0|This was not a good read at all. It was full of Pride and Prejudice recaps, I've read P&P so many times I practically have it memorized and don't need it retold. The mystery murder was a good idea but didn't go anywhere good and the characters are not the same as P&P. I was sorry that I bought this book.
0439023521|3.0|After watching the trailer for the upcoming movie that is being made for this book, I was intrigued by the idea that it portrayed. I didn't want to wait for the movie to come out, so instead I grabbed the book and read it all in one sitting. It is definitely an easy read and a page-turner, though each chapter always felt like cheap thrills that left much to be desired (which is perhaps why I kept reading until the end, in hopes of finding real substance). I really liked the idea that the author was getting at- an idea of a totalitarian society, forcing people to fight to the death as a way of displaying control, suggesting that a rebellion may soon ensue. However, it felt as if the author did not adequately explore or challenge these ideas, but rather left them at face-value and chose to focus instead on some sort of romantic relationship that arises which eventually becomes the main plot of the story.  There are a few things that I particularly disliked about this book:  [spoiler alert]  - Katniss's personality and lack of character development. She is prideful, selfish, insensitive, and oblivious to seemingly obvious things (like the fact that Peeta is madly in love with her). By the end of the book, she is still the same as if no positive change has occurred.  - Unbelievability. I understand this is a futuristic sort of novel, but sometimes it felt as if it was all taking place in another world where anything is possible. And that would be fine if this story was supposed to take place in another made-up world, however, the setting is claimed to be a future North America. Things such as mutated birds who sing your songs, mutated killer wasps that follow and poison you to the point of delusion, mutated wolves combined with human beings, berries that kill you right when you eat them, etc.,  just didn't make any sense and the reasoning behind their existences seemed quite pointless. (Btw, why aren't guns and machine weapons included if this is futuristic? Why is medicine suddenly so hard to come by and instead they are using magic herbs?)  - Everything was too convenient. Everything worked itself to the protagonist's favor. It almost felt as if Katniss and Peeta win the game without really trying. All they really focus on is their own survival, their little love story, and somehow everyone else conveniently dies until they just have to face the last guy. And the deaths of the other tributes were barely touched upon as well. There could have been so much more depth if Katniss was actually involved in the battles, if her character was challenged during face-offs with the other tributes (such as Rue). But instead she just conveniently lucked out every time. Not to mention, the twist at the end of the game only lasted for about a second.  In general, the idea behind the story could have turned into a really great book, but instead the author chose not to expand on it, reducing the story to just another shallow but entertaining book. It's fun to read, almost in a guilty pleasure sort of way, but if you're looking for depth and substance- look elsewhere.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|I received the Kindle Fire for Christmas and wanted a case for it.  I purchased this from Amazon. I like that it is sturdy, yet hugs the Fire so it's smaller than other cases.  It fits in my purse nicely, and I don't carry a large purse. It will prop the Fire up as shown in the picture.  The pink is a fun color. I would definitely recommend this if you have a Kindle Fire.
B004LWZW7Y|4.0|I enjoyed this film so much! I'd recommend it to anybody who enjoys a good plot, with great characters, funny laughs and fantastic visuals! I would much rather watch this than a shrek film.
B005TQAI6G|5.0|Thank you. Great tour! Nice DVD, good seller! The next is Madonna :)  Ive been at Budapest to see her performance. Its great tour but i need old Britney :)  I bought this because I am a true fan and love all her work. You decide to buy it or not.
6301942647|3.0|Saw this video more than 20 years ago in a theater. It was so remarkable that I forgot that I had seen it until actually watching the 6 vingettes. I do like more traditional stories -- not artsy fartsy presentations.  The tape was in good condition and arrived in a timely fashion.
B006UG90RM|1.0|This sounds like DLR solo work, which was OK back in late 80's. His voice is the biggest problem in this release. He just does not sound the same as in VH first 6 albums. I don't get it. Other singers back from 70's, 80's still sound pretty much the same, just not Dave. There is only very few bands who recovered after loosing the original singer (AC/DC, Iron Maiden to name couple) and VH was one of them. They should have continued with Sammy and they still would be huge and relevant to this day. Now they became forgettable (and no I'm not fan of Chickenfoot). I feel bad for VH brothers and Mike Anthony. DLR should stop singing, because it's embarrassment to VH.
B005HSG3VK|1.0|I bout the malware case in pink, and I did not like it.  When I put the kindle into the device, and tried to prop it up, it would fall down. There was also glue around the outside of the strap. The cover flap itself, was so thin, I was worried that it would not protect my kindle from nicks and dings from being carried in my purse or backpack (which is where I keep it.) For 29.99 I felt I could get something else that met my needs better, and seemed to be a little better quality.  This case has gone back to amazon for a refund. Although I did not like this product, I really like Amazon's refund policy and the level of customer service offered. This is why I shop at Amazon over all other retailers.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This might not be an issue for many other ppl but I am in a Theological Seminary.  I was hoping that the NRSV or similar might become available soon. The daily reminder for readings works pretty good, app works alot better if it's not on the SD card.

She suggests to put baby in crib and stand over them and pat them.  Doing this would just make my baby more upset and irate.  I would go with Dr. Weissbluth if you have a colicky baby.  This book was way to oversimplified.

B006Z7Z3R2|4.0|Ti West's follow up to his spooky 80s throwback House of the Devil is a return to a more basic and CGI-less haunted house story and is all the more refreshing for it. Tale of the final days of a supposedly haunted New England hotel is a fun and sometimes downright scary horror chiller that will please those horror fans that can still appreciate the days when effects were done live and scares were generated by the director and his camera, not digital FX artists. West once again takes his time to slowly build the atmosphere as he presents us with the story of the remaining employees of the old Yankee Pedlar Hotel, Claire and Luke (Sara Paxton and Pat Healy) as they decide to do a little paranormal investigating to gain evidence of the hotel's haunting before it closes. It gives nothing away to say that they may not like what they find. Ti West starts the film out with a light tone as we get to know these two slackers with an interest in the paranormal and as the story progresses, the tone slowly gets darker until, as with House, West unleashes his supernatural horrors during the intense final act. Some of today's impatient horror fans might not appreciate the slow burn but, it worked in House of the Devil as it does with Innkeepers, because, when we finally get to the good stuff, it is all the more effective since we haven't been bludgeoned with it from the start. West gives us a few red herrings and some spooky stuff along the way to wet the appetite and thus we are primed and ready when the real scares start. It also doesn't hurt that we like Claire and Luke and obviously are afraid for them when they fail to heed a psychic guest's (Kelly McGillis) warnings about leaving well enough alone. A really fun, spooky ghost flick that proves once again that Ti West is a legitimate filmmaking talent who's work deserves to be noticed.
030746363X|5.0|The 4-Hour Body is well written. It explains the use of protein in the diet and the need for beans as a Slow-Carb Diet. Mr. Ferriss explains the use of proteins with beans as a fast way to burn fat. His book is divided into sections so you can find necessary facts fast; tying them together with scientific facts. He includes well illustrated exercise with good explaination of each. I highly recommend this book.

B006UG90RM|4.0|After \\"Tattoo\\", I had extremely low expectations. A boring, bad song, and I joked with myself, \\"Hey, maybe the boys released the worst song on the album.\\" I never really thought they had. Wow. This is a delightful surprise. I have to take off one star because it lacks the Michael Anthony harmonizing, and Roth's voice has certainly taken a nose-dive. No screeching howls. Still, Roth knows his limits and works within them. Edward sounds *fantastic*, and Wolfie's bass work is impressive. This is raw, tough VH, and it's an excellent production. Yeah, it's re-worked old tunes, but who cares. It was the best approach to take. If this is the last album from them, it's a great swan song. If you love the old stuff, you're in for a treat. Sammy is certainly eating crow. Crack open a beer, kick back and enjoy. Van Halen lives!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Battery lasts me 8-10 hours.<br /><br />The surround sound is awesome.  The setup application is easy to use.  (I'm using windows 7 by the way... Windows XP was kind of a pain to configure this headset).<br /><br />I came from a medusa surround sound wired headset.  This doesn't sound quite as good, but I bought it for the wireless aspect, and for that, it is a clear winner.<br /><br />Only CON, it doesn't work with my PS3 (and if any of you know how to get it to work with PS3, PLEASE let me know in the comments section).<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|I bought this on my kindle after seeing that it was one of the bestsellers for 2011 (or something similar to that) and I was not disappointed. Although the beginning was quite repetitive (ie. reading how the main character is confused every morning and has to relearn her past every couple of pages), I think the author purposely constructed the novel that way to demonstrate the severity of the main character's condition. The plot definitely intensifies throughout the book and when I was nearing the end, I literally could not stop reading. The other reviews were very accurate in describing \\"Before I Go to Sleep\\" as a twisted thriller and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. I think this book would make a great movie too, even though there are a few of those amnesia type movies out already like \\"50 First Dates\\" and \\"The Vow\\". However, this suspenseful book will bring a different kind of amnesia type movie to the screen.
B000TBGG44|5.0|I actually have the Blue Vinyl version and the regular vinly version.

I'm 25 years old, so the Beatles are really before my time, but I love their music, and this is a truly great selection.  I've heard most of the songs before I received the album (mostly in movies and on television) so I recognized them instantly.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|After hearing rave reviews for this book I finally sat down and read it, front to back in two hours.  I couldn't and wouldn't put it down despite certain 'flaws.'  I had goosebumps and chills for the first half, it definitely brought up a lot of emotion in me thinking of those actually involved in the roundup.  The story itself was predictable at points i.e the origin of the apartment, the romantic connection with the son, the newborns name, etc.  And I found my interest waning after Sarah's POV was removed.

Those with a little more imagination realized that money isn't everything and allowed for personal preferences to play a role in assigning value. Behavioral psychologists, such as Professor Kahneman, have been poking big holes in the economic models in recent decades so that the rational economic person perspective increasingly looks more like tattered cheesecloth than anything you would want to wear in public.<br /><br />In Thinking, Fast and Slow, Professor Kahneman presents the results of many decision-making experiments to shed light on how decisions are typically made, what influences those decisions, and how the decisions could be improved. If you haven't read about these experiments, I'm sure you'll be fascinated. Most are presented in a way that allows you to test your own mental processes and to see how your reactions compare to what most people do. That adds to the fun.<br /><br />Some of the more interesting findings are that we are more heavily affected by peak experiences, memories of how things ended, and whether we \\"won\\" or \\"lost\\" than we are by the economics or hedonic pleasure of something. Further, we're likely to be so overly optimistic that we won't see the cliff until we are launched head over heels over it.<br /><br />I'm sure that somewhere in this book you'll find a chapter or two that will highlight something that bothers you about your own decision making, and you'll come away with some good ideas for how to do better next time.<br /><br />The book's main drawback is that Professor Kahneman is perhaps a little more offended by peoples' inability to appreciate statistics and to do math in the right context than he might be. That section was a bit too long and precious.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the conclusions where a lot of standard assumptions about how to accomplish things are politely, but firmly, challenged.<br /><br />Bravo, Professor Kahneman!inability to appreciate statistics and to do math in the right context than he might be.

B003R0LBVW|1.0|A few friends had recommended this book and praised it repeatedly, so that coupled with Oprah's recommendation and the other media praise, I decided to give it a go.  I found the first few chapters interesting until it got to the Mothers autobiography, where I felt the whole story took a turn for the worse.  I struggled to continue reading as I found it incredibly dull, unrealistic and the characters appeared to grow more and more irritating by the paragraph.  I stubbornly refused to leave it unfinished and made myself complete the book and it was like self-imposed torture.  I'm none the better for having read it and wish I'd listening to my nagging inner-voice and quit while I was ahead.  Highly disappointed by it and I don't understand all the praise it's received.
B005J4TLN4|4.0|When the producers who brought you the horror comedy \\"Shawn of the Dead\\" are involved, you can expect the unexpected. I had a great time watching this clever, creative mashup of urban gang movie and alien invasion thriller, something no one to my knowledge has tried before. It's an auspicious debut by writer-director Joe Cornish and leading man John Boyega.<br /><br />\\"Attack the Block\\" is full of kinetic action, complex characters, amusing dialog, and interesting twists on two genres. Set among the gritty council flats and lower classes of Britain, the film features a band of thugs as protagonists. They behave viciously at first, mugging a nurse in the opening scene, yet she eventually becomes an ally after aliens attack the tower block they share. The hoods evolve into a group that demonstrates ingenuity, bravery, loyalty, and even a kind of nobility in the face of common threats, human and nonhuman.<br /><br />The talented young cast, most of them complete novices, is thoroughly believable (the only actor you're likely to recognize is Nick Frost, who plays a comical pot grower). Their thick South London dialect and slang may prompt American audiences to turn on subtitles, but that won't interfere with your enjoyment. The furry, jet-black aliens, while not particularly sophisticated as special effects go, are implacably aggressive and genuinely scary as they leap on their victims and tear at them with glowing blue fangs. And what's an alien invasion without a good dose of grisly horror?<br /><br />A caution: If you order this item from an Amazon Marketplace reseller, you're likely to be shipped a bare-bones rental disc that contains the film and a few trailers but none of the worthwhile special features. Be sure to enquire before ordering whether the DVD on offer includes the bonus material. If so, the extras will be listed on the back cover of the case.<br /><br />There are three different commentary tracks from the director, producer, and actors, as well as \\"Behind the Block,\\" an hour-long making-of documentary, and \\"Creature Feature,\\" a 20-minute look at creating the aliens. Throw in a variety of shorts like \\"Meet the Gang,\\" focusing on the young actors, and \\"Unfilmed Action,\\" showing storyboards for scenes never filmed due to budget and time constraints, and you have a very full disc. All told, these features are considerably longer than the film itself and will substantially augment your viewing experience.<br /><br />This flick is a great ride, both entertaining and satisfying. Get on board, bruv. Trust!ind the Block,\\" an hour-long making-of documentary, and \\"Creature Feature,\\" a 20-minute look at creating the aliens.

B006GH6IWU|3.0|I'm a major Queen fan and bought this thinking I was gonna expect more bonus footage from this documentary...and boy was I wrong! When I saw this item on UK/European online stores, I found out that other bonus scenes were left out of the US version of this DVD. You won't find scenes like 'Brian's Health Scare 1974', 'Freddie Legless', 'Queen: The Beginning', 'Making Videos', and 'Queen on Tour 1974-1975' on this US version of the DVD. This just ain't fair for us the US Queen fans to have less than what we would've liked to see from this documentary. Especially from a documentary of one of the most legendary rock bands in history that is Queen! This is kind of a let-down for me.
159420229X|4.0|While the author is upfront about the fact that this is not a \\"how-to\\" book on improving your memory, he does attempt to teach the reader some of the techniques he used during his year of training. From my perspective, though, he never went far enough in any of these sections. So, he would begin to explain something, and use some examples, but never really went all the way through a technique and his experience with it. Most frustrating, perhaps, was the chapter \\"How to Memorize a Poem,\\" since its title suggested he would actually teach you how to memorize a poem. Instead, he mentions how hard memorizing poems is and briefly mentions a technique or two, but does not show how they're really used, or which of them he found useful -- though later in the book he mentions having memorized numerous short poems. With a little more explanation this chapter -- and other sections -- could have been much more interesting and possibly even useful.  On a slightly related note, the endnotes to this book aren't particularly helpful. There are numerous occasions on which the author is referring to secondary literature, but does not give a citation or tell the reader where he could go to get more on a specific topic. More often than not, I found what few notes there were unhelpful, in part because they seemed usually to be about something other than what I went to that note hoping to find. A bit more diligence in writing responsible notes would have made this book more useful.  The book is well written and enjoyable, but a little bit more thought and work could have made what is only a good book a great book.

0307455874|2.0|Ok, I am not a fan of President Obama. I am not anti-Obama either. I was soured on him when he won a Nobel Peace Prize just for being elected. I never understood why so many people who actually did something for the world were passed over and he got an award for basically running for president without yet acomplishing anything. I have to wonder if they had waited if he would still receive the award today. Well I am getting off on a tangent. That being said, I still gave the book an open minded read. What is in it is most of his catch phrases from speeches. I was hoping there would be some backing and research for his views but that was completely absent. As another reviewer said \\"it is a mile wide and an inch deep intellectually speaking.\\"  That is my opinion too.

From retrieving important documents while I'm not at home, to using it as a remote for my PC media center, remotely troubleshooting my parents computer, or even the ability to stream music and video from my computer to my kindle or my android phone, this app gets used daily.  The ability to use it over a shared connection is nice. The ability to use it through any Internet connection, including the 4g connection on my phone, and have it work well is amazing.

B006UG90RM|2.0|I had to stop at Best Buy this afternoon for an emergency grab on a computer project.  I happen to pass the cd isle and guess what?  They had the new Van Halen cd, for sale, for the second day and it was cheaper than you guys!  What happened to the quick service and the lowest prices???  If I'd known I could have gotten it quicker at Best Buy, I'd have gotten it there.  Come on, let's get back to customer service!!!  P.S., Still waiting for the cd.
B004X80QNG|5.0|it has a steep learning curve but once you get used to it you'll realize that it is an awesome replacement for the default calendar. I use this all the time to keep my appointments and reminders. The only things it  is lissing is synching with google calendar (although it DID import from the calendar upon install) and a widget. It could use customizable alarm tones so that it could play different songs for diffrent appointments but that is just me nickpicking.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I was worried after I heard \\"Tattoo\\".  I am a huge VH fan, but that song didn't really do much for me.  I admit, I was kind of doubting whether or not the new album would live up to the hype.  I am happy to say that \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" not only lives up to the hype, it blows it into a million pieces!  \\"Tattoo\\" is easily the weakest song on the album, and even that isn't too bad, but the other songs...oh, man!  Each one grooves better than the last.  \\"Stay Frosty\\" is already a new classic.  \\"Outta Space\\" has a great groove to it.  Ed shreads on \\"As Is\\".  I could go on and on, but I'd be taking time away from you listening.  This album is getting great reviews pretty much across the board, so what are you waiting for?  VH is back and better than they have been since \\"5150\\" came out!

B005K0HDGE|2.0|I'll admit to having given up on Stephen King years ago after struggling to get through about half of \\"IT\\".  However, I'm a history buff and intrigued with the JFK assasination so thought I'd give Mr. King a try once again after reading a few positive advance reviews.  In this tale reluctant chrononaut Jake Epping gets an opportunity to travel back in time armed with information making it possible to alter history and save JFK from his fate on 22 Nov '63 at Dealy Plaza.  A great premise that takes 850+ pages to complete, most of which is fairly pedestrian stuff as Jake bides his time waiting for the fateful day and setting things up so he can subvert Oswald's plan.  It's not terrible, but it's just not very interesting.  In the end you'll wish you had a time portal with which you could go back and reclaim the time you lost reading this novel.

B001FB563E|2.0|I didn't enjoy this movie. It seemed like something I would like, but negative emotions are all I can use to describe it.<br />Here is a quick summary of things I remember about this movie:<br />1. The color Gray - The entire movie is in various shades of gray and while I understand it's the end of the world, no hope, etc., etc., It gets old.<br />2. The whiny kid - In a post-apocalyptic world, you would think that a father would figure a way to harden his kid to prepare him for survival in this cruel, post-apocalyptic world.<br />3. People eating people - Cannibals were such a crutch in this movie. Whenever things got tense, the answer ultimately was \\"cannibals\\"...<br />4. For a movie called \\"The Road\\", it didn't really go anywhere - I understand that the point of this movie was to be depressing and hopeless, etc. My problem with it is that you can accomplish that feeling in a vehicle that is still entertaining.<br />In conclusion, I found this movie mostly tedious and annoying.

B003Z2LAAO|1.0|This movie has some lovely panoramic scenes in 3D. It is not in the least bit entertaining and is best watched with the audio turned off. It should have been narrated by Al Bore. You get the impression that the producers believe that all humans need to die off so the world can heal itself.  Some lovely 3D photography, but narated by mindless environmental whack jobs. Dialog has little basis in current scientific fact!  SAVE YOUR MONEY!!
B000W91RUG|5.0|I really enjoy watching \\"The Big Bang Theory.\\"  It has a lot of more cerebral humor and really speaks to me.  Sometimes it's the sci-fi interests of the characters or taking them to a silly extreme.
1451627289|2.0|I had high expectations for this book but was sorely disappointed.  I did read all 842 pages which says something good about Stephen King's writing, but he is obviously uncomfortable writing about history and he is neither well-versed, well-read, nor well-educated in the second half of 20th century American History.  His discomfort led him to concentrate more than 700 pages on the very small story of boring people in a very small high school in a very small town in Texas. And then to rush through the JFK assassination summarily in about three pages. His protagonist is bumbling and incompetent,and not in a good way. The romance did not ring true because the protagonist seemed about 64 (Stephen King's age) rather than the 35 year old he was suppose to be.

1570629706|5.0|This is a true literary classic, a pivotal work in Hesse's writings and a book that feels more relevant as time goes by.<br /><br />I am limiting my comments to the physical book itself. The Shambhala hardcover book (ISBN: 978-1570629709) is just over 4x6 inches in size -- compact and lightweight. Easy to carry and a joy to read. A built-in ribbon marker helps you keep your place. The paper is high quality, just off-white and glare-free. The binding is Smyth sewn and the pages lay flat. The typography is sharp and clear and easy on the eyes. These features make reading the text a pleasant experience and a pleasure to own. If only other editions were made this well. A keeper.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I spent a long period of my life reading very little even though I read more than was arguably healthy. Since reading this book I have gotten back into reading again, not to mention the fact that it was one of the best books I ever.

0307891372|4.0|I have been a gamer all my life and this an amazing, addicting game.  The shear number of quests and areas to explore is astounding.  I find myself just running through the land finding odd goings on and little villages to help (or destroy).  My only complaint is a common one for games that are both PC and console.  The UI is, well, a bit terrible.  Coming from other games such as Diablo, WoW, Rift, etc.  For the PC, this UI doesn't share any information and is annoying to use with a mouse.  Screen real estate is wasted as well.  However, you are rewarded once you \\"get use to\\" it.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|This book is deceptively simple and really effective. There are specific techniques you can learn that will improve your ability to connect with people who are important to you. Customers, certainly. Co-workers? Yep. The boss?  Absolutely. Potential donors? You bet. And family and friends, too. Robin Dreeke describes and provides good examples  of tools you can use to break through the barriers people put up in business and personal relationships. He'll teach you how to build a strong rapport with others that gets results.
B005I6EU7U|2.0|The case does fit extremely tight.  I was sure it would not fit.  You almost have to destroy the thing to get the kindle fire in there.  Also, it isn't extremely easy to read with and hold as the cover doesn't fold flat.  It does look great though and the material is nice.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I am away from the office a lot and I depend on this software to review and update my office files. Great job and keep improving OfficeSuite Pro.
B0059XTUMC|2.0|Boring. Pointless. A love story where lips moving do not match the dialogue printed on the screen.  It is insufferable for the first 20 plus minutes. Then sound is introduced, a ray of hope akin to a paper match being  lit in a torrential thunderstorm to light some kindling. Tedious is The Artist. Don't let anyone kid you, The Artist is a bore for the most part. It has its moments where the dog is visible. Where the hell is Lassie?  Am sure these positive reviews are for people trying to be snobs much like the Emperor's New Clothes. And of course the people in the movie itself with all the glorious adjectives to describe this clever concept gone seriously awry.  The Artist is not worth seeing. These people are same who said Hugo is a masterpiece. Hugo is a bore, a dullard, the most extreme outward flourishes of tediousness.
B006UG90RM|1.0|This is slop from start to finish.  I am a huge VH fan of Roth and Hagar and this is junk.  If you want to believe VH is still great under the old & [[ASIN:B006UG90RM A Different Kind of Truth]]new line up listen to all the VH CDs with Roth, but do not include this in that group.  This sounds like a bad version of a David Lee Roth Garage Tribute band.

Quintessentially classic VH. True to form, pure, unadulterated fun (really missed Eddie's riffs and licks). A sweet, unexpectedly bold comeback. The hoping and waiting paid of and was worth it. At my age, I'm not supposed to but I just can't help myself. I can still dig it. Just turned 50 but then again, this just made my day. Thanks a million, guys, and welcome back!
B006JQ94N8|4.0|A disclaimer: I am not an unconditional fan of Cocteau Twins as a whole, but I do find them a very fascinating band, with a lot of good songs.<br /><br />Stars & Topsoil: A generous selection of their 1982-1990 songs, but not my favorite. I much more prefer their 1991 \\"Sampler\\" - a more compact compilation, covering the same period. Maybe, because the 'Sampler' has most of the songs that I do like, and only one or two that I don't care for; this way I can listen to it without having to skip tracks (which would be kinda cumbersome thing to do when you play vinyl).<br /><br />Conclusion: If you are just \\"curious\\" about Cocteau Twins (as opposed to being their steadfast admirer, you may be better off with their 1991 'Sampler' than with the Stars and Topsoil.
030771652X|5.0|What an excellent read!  Starts a bit slow and you want to just ring her mother's neck but wow! what a great plot and ending.  No spoilers here but I must say that this author will be on the top of my list to watch.  I had to recommend it to my book club after I finished it.  It is this months read and there should be plenty of discussion.  The readers guide at the end was nice and I'm sure we will review it also during our meeting.  Congrats to this author!

It just made more sense for us to order the book...it came very quickly and my son had his own copy.

Thank you very much!

B004JZBGWI|4.0|Love how you can use either a text list or a checklist, depending on what you need (text list is best if you want to do subsets of tasks).  Can view your list either as a list or in a grid (which is my favorite by far).  You enter a task list, put a reminder to it then delete the reminder while keeping the task.  Doesn't seem to work starting from calendar to task though.  I played with several checklist options available on Amazon and this one easily was the best I found. Easy and intuitive way to keep track of the zillion things on your to do list.  A few cons: Limited ways to sort tasks, no audible reminder tone when something comes due (would be nice for when too busy to keep an eye on my Kindle Fire), would like a few more colors (and no black or grey) to tag with.

B0071CBBKS|5.0|One of the first MP3 downloads I purchased on Amazon.com was The Fray's self titled album in 2009. I was mesmerized by the piano lead and vocals and lyrics by Isaac Slade. Any poet worth his weight in salt will testify the lyrics originate from an authentic core of loss, pain, and ultimate redemption. I take issue with mainstream pop rock critics that underrate this exceptionally unique band. Comparisons to Coldplay and Keane are myopic at best. Their creative resonance and wordplay are different in their approach to storytelling. The Fray come off far more serious and straightforward than any of their comparative peers. It troubles me when critics from the major music magazines three star them, and write the band `lacked originality\\" and the album itself lacked any \\"inspiration and excitement\\". They just don't get it. When the lyrics in all of The Fray's albums revolve around life's problems and issues. Common themes include happiness, sadness, death,evil, of relationships, and war. The honest and emotional nature of the The Fray's songs has critics labeling them as \\"emo\\" or emotionally driven. In all honesty, what great song has not embraced emotion thoroughly? Scars and Stories thematically is about those painfully rough parts in our lives and discovering a way to love our way out or through them. The Fray is better than ever at expressing them, having two albums behind them and the critical bruises as proof. Is it The Fray's quest to be our ambassadors of giving us honesty instead of pop fluff? Yes, I'd say it is, and I'm grateful they are, because they do it so well. Buy \\"Scars & Stories\\" and find out where The Fray ends up. A clue is in the album cover. They aren't running away from the hurt,after listening to it they're running toward the love and joy they justly desererve.
B0000A5BU3|5.0|With a full collection of Bowie's work I was pleased to find 'Black Tie White Noise' again available on CD. (I had previously bought the album on DVD after the CD went out of print) All the songs sound fresh and groovy 'Miracle Goodnight' a favourite. How good is Bowie? He is light years ahead and consistantly proves it.<br />I saw Bowie on the 'Reality' tour in Sydney, six rows back front and centre, ten years after the release of this album. All the works blended seamlessly together.<br />A Lost Treasure, buy the CD and enjoy smooth silky sounds carressing the senses. Peace Out.
B000RO9VJK|4.0|This is one of the few business book I read and understood! Michael E. Gerber writes in a simple language and with the example of Sarah, the young woman that sells pies, the reader will find answers to his questions about running his small business efficiently.
B003V6L94Q|3.0|As the title says, not a bad collecton, but not good either.  The quality of the recording is pretty good, no real complaints there.  I enjoyed the start of the CD, but after getting to about the 4th or 5th song, all of them sounded exactly alike, nothing original or different about any of them, it's as if the artist was stuck on the same tune.  There is a slow number thrown in with all the other tunes, but it is not enough of a break from the same music, over again. There is no real melody to any of the tunes, the songs progress in the same manner as the previous ones, maybe with a bit of a different background treatment, but still the music all sounded the same like one long repetitious number, to the point that the music became tedious.  If you like the same sounding thing over and over again, and like the melodic structure (there ain't really any melody to any of it, but do not know how else to describe it) of the first number, you probably will enjoy this CD much more than I did. Yes, I was disappointed here, yet I still give the CD three stars mainly because the recording quality (sonics) were not that bad.  I just wish that the music had been better.
B006UG90RM|2.0|A Different Kind of Truth isn't just a brand new Van Halen album- it's a new album with the return of the man who put the band on the map, David Lee Roth.  With THAT impressive feat in mind, it should be good, right?  The seemingly endless wait is finally over so we SHOULD be happy he's back, correct?  The album is honestly not even remotely good.  The biggest problem is that David can no longer sing.  His vocal range has now been reduced to chugging along to the guitar riffs and nothing outrageous about his vocal range ever once catches my attention while listening through these songs.  Plus his voice now resembles Ian Gillan from Deep Purple... the current version of Ian Gillan I mean (or rather, what Ian's been sounding like for close to 30 years now).  Back in the 70's when both Ian Gillan and David Lee Roth could sing, they were equally impressive in their respective lead singer positions.  Now unfortunately, they both sound exactly the same with a safe singing style (safe as in, not even attempting to be outrageous) and just stink.  They can no longer hit those impressive and distinctly sounding high notes that made them so great back in the day.  What a shame and a waste of our precious time.  \\"Tattoo\\" is totally overrated.  The mindless way David just blurts out \\"tattoo tattoo\\" periodically throughout the song is laughably awful.  I can't even tolerate such mindlessness because it's insulting to all Van Halen fans.  The way David generically sings \\"Swap meet Sally, trampstamp kat, mousewife to mombshell in the time it took to get that new tattoo\\" is another example of insulting the listeners as well.  THIS sounds like what 5150 would have been had David continued with the band after their 1984 album.  I can totally believe it.  \\"Beats Workin\\" has an enticingly heavy intro before morphing into the very definition of mediocre hard rock with a *horrendous* vocal melody.  In fact it's so bad, I can't tell what's supposed to be the chorus and what's supposed to be the verse!  It's extremely hard to understand the lyrics thanks to David's drunken-sounding, careless vocal delivery.  People often defend this atrocious \\"singing\\" style as David having fun because Van Halen is supposed to be all about party rock.  Well if that's the case, I'm leaving this party early because the music stinks.  \\"Stay Frosty\\" has an average first half with generic blues, but when it speeds up halfway through it becomes tolerable at least.  It's still unforgivably generic and WAY too much like their significantly better classic from the debut \\"Ice Cream Man\\".  \\"Blood & Fire\\" is actually decent because David keeps his voice in a lower range (or rather, a half-singing, half-talking range where it's nice and comfortable).  His voice resembles the lead singer from Men Without Hats, but that's alright because at least it's listenable.  \\"As Is\\" is another highlight thanks to a speedy guitar riff and vocal performance that recalls the classic late 70's years.  The entire album honestly should have been like these two songs.  Overall, no.  It's not worth hearing.  The two songs I mention in the paragraph above are the only tunes worth listening to.
B0059IVV9M|5.0|First, I want to thank Paste.com for including The Rip Tide in its best of 2011 list, thereby introducing me to this wonderful talent (Zach Condon).  I liked The Rip Tide so much I bought his two previous albums: Gulag Orkestar (2006) and The Flying Club Cup (2007); both are very good.  If you enjoy heartbreakingly beautiful pop music (reminiscent of Sufjan Stevens's Illinoise), you owe it to yourself to hear this album, which is a delight from start to finish.  I had to look up the lyrics so I could sing along with my favorite track \\"Port of Call\\".  Thank you, Zach, for putting so much beauty out in the world.  Easily my favorite album of 2011.
B004USRKX8|4.0|If I Could Only Remember My Name is perhaps best described as a watered down Crosby, Stills & Nash.  The songs totally resemble the classic work of CSN in the sound, however, the songwriting itself just isn't as strong or as memorable as the songs from the first two Crosby, Stills & Nash albums.  Certainly don't expect anything like \\"Our House\\", \\"Teach Your Children\\" or \\"Wooden Ships\\".  \\"Cowboy Movie\\" is based around a fairly ordinary vocal melody and attempts to tell a story about an indian girl and a character named Eli.  It sort of falls apart with the story because it never really holds up well enough to catch my attention, and had this been included and thoroughly realized on a Crosby, Stills & Nash album, I seriously wonder if the quality of the songwriting would have been better.  I don't want to rip on it *too* hard however since it IS a fairly catchy melody that chugs along in a satisfying enough way.  \\"Song With No Words (Tree With No Leaves)\\" lives up to its name because it consists entirely of Crosby singing \\"de de de de de\\" throughout the entire 6-minute song.  However the guitar arrangements are spaced apart in such a way to maintain my interest so it's not *that* mindless.  The guitar solo at the end in particular stands out to me.  The dreamy atmosphere is another soothing and welcoming addition.  It *will* take you back to the early 70's whether you've heard this song before or not.  \\"Traction In the Rain\\" feels like lightweight filler to me, unless it's supposed to grow on listeners significantly with repeated listens.  It's not working for me just yet however.  \\"What Are Their Names\\" is a quietly performed guitar jam which basically consists of a few notes repeating for the first two minutes before a vocal melody resembling the Eagles song \\"Outlaw Man\\" appears.  It's definitely nothing compared to a Grateful Dead jam, and the vocals -which are short and sweet- are nothing special either.  \\"Laughing\\" is some kind of country ballad, or at least, Crosby's distinct version of such a combination and, thanks mainly to the eerie background, it works wonders.  The vocal melody is solid enough so don't think I'm criticizing that important aspect!  \\"Tamalpais High (At About 3)\\" takes us back to the simple \\"de de de\\" singing style of \\"Song With No Words (Tree With No Leaves)\\".  Other than a few peaceful guitar notes jamming along to the rhythm, there's not a whole lot taking place here.  Overall, it's a pretty good album but not really a classic thanks to several moments that feel undeveloped to me.  However others apparently disagree and believe If I Could Only Remember My Name is a classic, so you be the judge.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am a long time science fiction reader and have read many wonderful stories that are based on science, technology, engineering and math.  A few years ago I purchased a Kindle and it has opened up opportunities for me to read more with less effort and at less expense.  I now have over two hundred science fiction books listed in my archives.  Four days ago, I purchased the Wool Omnibus Edition by Hugh Howey.  I finished it about an hour ago.  This is the first review that I have ever been inspired to write about any book.  Some reviewers say that they cannot put a book down, once they get started into it.  I have not understood this compulsion until last night, for the first time I had a hard time sleeping.  I stopped reading sometime after midnight at a point in the book that left me anxious about the main character and was unwilling to disturb my wife by turning the light on or getting out of bed to pick up where I had left off.  It takes a powerful piece of work to make me worry over what I know is fiction.  One small note to other authors that might be reading this review, part of what makes Wool a joy to read is the lack of grammatical and spelling errors of so many of the self published books.  It is an extreme annoyance and distraction to me to read sentences in a book that I must stop, and reread substituting words that I think the author meant to understand the idea being communicated.  Please take the time, your time or the time of others, to critically review your writing and fix these sentences that act as stumbling blocks for the reader on the journey you want to share with them.  I and suspect many other readers would be willing to pay more for a book without grammatical and spelling errors.  I suspect this collection of a continuing story is going to become a classic.  For many years now I have read and reread Foundation by Isaac Asimov and Dune by Frank Herbert along with other classics.  This omnibus has the same deep commitment to the development ofthe characters and their feelings as they are caught up in a series of events that shape their future in an uplifting way from darker times.  It is not complicated by a large cast of characters, like some series feel is necessary, but the few characters it does have are intertwined with one another and others in their society in a common journey through their lives.  I would highly recommend this to others, because I am sure that I will be rereading this story again and again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this part of the trilogy. It wasn't as exciting as part 1 (But that's because that story is brand new as we are first introduced.) But the end [Catching Fire] was great. VERY suspenseful; I felt compelled to get the last part of the trilogy.<br /><br />I'm not one to follow &#34;trends&#34; or get swept away by big promotions of a book. (Think all those crazies who follow Twilight religiously.) But that is why I genuinely enjoyed reading this as I had no bias.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great!  Easy to use. The selection of Bible versions make it a great Bible study aid.  The plans and other helps are valuable assets as well.  The fact that all this is free make this app perfect.  Would not want to be without it!
0385344228|5.0|When I closed the last page of this book, I sat there and went \\"whoa\\".  I couldn't believe the journey the story had taken me on. This story is that of Andy Barber, an ADA in Massachusetts, who makes the choice not to assign another prosecutor the case of a fourteen-year-old boy who had been found murdered in a local park, but to prosecute it himself, despite the fact that others feel he should step down since his son went to the same school as the victim. He doesn't feel there is a conflict of interest because his son claims to have only known the victim in passing. But when Barber's son is arrested and charged with his classmate's murder, Andy is forced to step down from the case and he is placed on leave.  Andy suddenly finds himself in a place he never thought he'd be - on the other side of the courtroom, at the defense table.<br /><br />One of the main focuses of this book is the issue of nature versus nurture - how much your upbringing and your DNA factor into the person you become. Can the sins of your family's past (nature) become yours of the present, even if you never knew about them when you were growing up (nurture)?  How blind can you be when looking at your children and the potential mistakes that they've made?  Do you really only see what you want to see? Does unconditional love truly know no bounds?<br /><br />What follows is an emotional story that is part courtroom thriller, part mystery, and a whole lot of family drama. All of which combine to create an emotionally packed tale of one families struggle to not only believe in their child and what's he's told them, but to find a way to save him and their family unit. At any cost.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|This well thought app was, for me, the best of the apps I tried.  Thanks to Amazon for making it easy by installing it on the Fire from the get-go.  It allows me to choose my locations quickly and specifically, and see everything I need from hourly forecast to radar maps and more.  We have a farm and a business in a larger town some distance away, and the ability to customize my weather information is important.  This does it all.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Fantastic program wish I fully understood the full power it has.  Great program for phone and Xoom.  Am able to keep data updated
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the old-fashioned card game that we grew up with and it's still fun to play!  Give it a try. I think you ail like it.
B005LAJ23A|2.0|Very disappointed. Loaded this Blu Ray into my Pioneer Elite player and the sound is garbled. Unable to resolve the issue so far after updating the firmware. The<br />comedy is amplified inasmuch as this movie plays fine on my scimpy little PS3
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Great app for the Kindle! It was worth the cost. Very clean and smooth look and feel. Quality app! I use it to help manage my personal laptops at my home.
B000002UB2|5.0|I enjoy this record alot .As far as sound quality goes I give it a A plus.Some people say records sound better than cd's ,i Don\\"t know if thats true ,but this record sounds very good. I notice subtleties I haven't heard before in a 40 year old recording.
0439023521|5.0|When I a book gets a lot of hype, I usually get skeptical. Can it really be that good? Well, I really enjoyed this book! The first person present tense narrative really made the story very immediate and pressing, and after a while I forgave the blatant fragment and run-on sentences as more lending to the realism of the herione's voice. No spoilers here: just a fun action packed book set in a twisted post-apocalyptic society (and really, what post-apocalyptic society is *not* going to be twisted, let's be honest) with interesting bit of ambivalent romance. Yes, some of the plot is predictable, but overall it was hard to put the book down!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun to play if you need to waste some time. more for the kids. don't like the ads and constantly wanting me to pay food additional games.
0439023491|5.0|Fast and immediate, the book builds perfectly on the singularity of Katniss, developing more characters and the Panem universe. An excellent book!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|less points to unlock games would be great. Run out of points and have yo lost old games before you can unlock new games.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|I love this game, well I did until it stopped granting me the achievements on Feint (or whatever it's called). I got to 26 acievements, and haven't been granted one since. I sent in a inquary about this a while ago with no responce. Fix it, and I'll fix the rating to the 5 stars this game deserves.
1595141979|5.0|This series is getting better and better with each book I read.  I liked the first book, loved the second book, but I am head over heals IN LOVE with Shadow Kiss.  This one had the action, the romance, and of course more heartbreak and angst.<br /><br />Rose has matured a bit for me in this book.  I especially love how she stood up for her own needs over what Lissa wants near the end.  I love how she finally has realized that there are things she needs to have in her life at this moment in her life she is going to finally use her courage and strength to do it.  Every time Rose thought she was having a 'crazy episode', my heart started to crack with sadness.  When she starts seeing Mason, I wanted comfort Rose and make her believe that she is not seeing things.  I really wish she would have told Dimitri sooner though so that they could have figured out what was really going on sooner.<br /><br />I also feel that Rose needs to take the advice that others have given her and accept that Lissa is stronger than Rose realizes.  She should have also confided in Lissa about being in love with Dimitri.  They are suppose to be best friends, but it seems Rose never uses her as a best friend should in sharing secrets.<br /><br />When the puzzle starts piecing together and the action really kicks into full gear, the author again wreaked havoc on my emotions.  How could she do this to our beloved Dimitri?  After Rose and Dimitri finally figure a possible way of making a relationship work, she pulls the rug out from underneath us and does the worst.<br /><br />Then we have Adrian. Oh playful and flirtatious Adrian.  I have fallen for him as well.  I love his witty humor and laid back personality.  I enjoyed it when he was trying to capture the magic of Spirit and bring the plants back to life with Lissa.  I loved his actions with Rose and how he would do anything he could for her.  The final scenes with Rose and Adrian were so sweet and tender that I found myself crying with his words.<br /><br />Overall, these books are just getting better and I keep having to change my favorite book in the series as I go.  If you haven't read this series yet, you are definitely missing out on not only a great story but amazing writing as well.ing better and I keep having to change my favorite book in the series as I go.

B004XWMXX8|5.0|This album is pure magic! Selena really shows how much she's grown up to be a woman! Her voice has matured, and she's learning to expand her musical horizons by taking on Britney Spears and Katy Perry sounds. I was never crazy about Selena but when I recieved this album as a gift, I've become a Selena fan - I love her now! When The Sun Goes Down was a well transitioned, meaningful but perfect for the party kind of album.  It all starts off with my personal favorite: Love You Like A Love Song! It's fun, great for the dance floor and irresistibly catchy. Well done Selena :) 10/10  Bang Bang Bang = thought this song was really cute, perfect for reminding your ex what they're missing! It's also super catchy, this was stuck in my head after 1st listen 9/10  Who Says = amazing song! beautiful, powerful, wonderful. one of my favorites, I sing this all the time ;) 10/10  We Own The Night = one of my favorites! emotionally raw and overall perfect 10/10  Hit The Lights = energetic and get up and go song!!! Love it 10/10  Whiplash = I didnt like this song at first but it grew on me! It's so Britney but so good :D 10/10  When The Sun Goes Down = fun song but not one of my favorites. 8/10  My Dilemma = this is so wonderful, sad and fun to dance to ALL IN ONE! I play this all the time :) 10/10  That's More Like It = probably my least favorite, it's quite annoying :P 5/10  Outlaw = it's okay, has a good sound 8/10  Middle of Nowhere = beautiful job, I <3 <3 it ;) 10/10  And finally Dices! I speak Spanish so I loved it! It was perfect for me. Overall a great album!!!!!
0618918248|4.0|very thorough and well written. makes you think. lots of good quotes. i really enjoyed it. i like that it probably makes a lot of really religious people mad. :)
1250006341|5.0|Beautiful pictures worth the purchase alone.  Great companion if you are watching the series.  Takes you back to the era.  Well written - great on a rainy day.
B0063GORYU|5.0|yet another great card game from mobility ware company. plenty options to chose from, different difficulty levels to choose from.
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I like the app. the only problem is that,  from the kindle, it can only be used in places with wifi, so if you are planning on cathing up on a study at the Dr. office or even at church. you cant access it, but it's great for home use.
0470876417|5.0|\\"This a great, fun, beautiful book! It derives from the author's PhD work on Business Models Ontologies. It's structured as follows: (1) BMG definition, canvas & 9 building blocks, (ii) patterns, (iiii) design, (iv) strategy and (v) process. The design tools discussed - customer insights, ideation, visual thinking, prototyping, storytelling and scenarios - are great handy tools every manager should have.

B00005N6KG|3.0|headphones fit funny in ears, sound distant, and have too much bass. they sound good for sub $10 headphones, but i'm only giving them 3 stars because you are better off saving your money for something that costs a little more but sounds and feels much better.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great little app! I hate ads but these are very small. Still wish there was a pay/no ads version  though.
B004XQO90O|5.0|Superb movie!!!!! You can't tell what the deal is from the first moment he wakes up in that train!!! I enjoyed every second of it! Very very awesome! One of the good new movies!
B0055OG2BC|4.0|This movie is indeed a psychedelic mess. It is what it is, a confection of pop art from the 60's. It looks good on blu-ray, perhaps not quite as pristine as some other catalog titles, but not bad. Burt Bacharach's music is IMO his best ever. I love watching older films on blu. It's like a fabulous time machine.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I am trying to get better at chess and this game is helping, but the easiest mode you can put it on is still very difficult to beat. Otherwise, I play this game constantly. It's very fun and it really challenges you.

B0063IH60K|5.0|It gives me something to do all of the time whence I am bored. I enjoy this game especially because it is quick and easy to play.
B0064NTZJO|5.0|The short review:  Drive is not for everyone. Most of the casual, movie-goers who enjoy simple, action movies like Transformers or Fast Five will not get this film. Drive was made for fans of film, GENUINE fans. There are many \\"shout-out's\\" to films released in the past. If you have an open mind and are willing to watch a different movie, then I recommend it.  The long review:  People who give negative reviews to this film mostly complain about two things: the lack of dialogue or not enough action. Someone who gives a negative review for a film just because it doesn't have enough action in it is not worth listening to. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy those types of movies but Drive isn't one of those types of film, so if you want that look else where.  When I first heard about this movie, I thought like many that this would be a \\"Fast & Furious\\" style movie starring Ryan Gosling. After deciding to give it a chance, I was surprised. I watched it again immediately after finishing it for the first time. To put it simply, I love this movie. From the neon, pink opening credits to it's 80's synth-pop soundtrack, Drive has a unique, sleek style that doesn't resemble any film I've watched recently. The forty minutes or so are very quiet, almost dream like, but this was done for a reason. Once the violence kicks in, like a nightmare, it is disturbing and chaotic.  The director of Drive not afraid to try something different. Most car chases in film are loud, in-your-face, and CGI heavy. Let's face it, when you see a car chase in recently released movies, you're entertained but not really amazed, at least I'm not. You've seen those types of car chases in countless movies so it's lost it's \\"wow\\" factor. Drive does the exact opposite of norm. The opening car chase is quiet and smart. This is how a real getaway would look like. No explosions. No guns. No special effects. Just a skillfully shot scene with an legitimate escape plan (pay attention to the basketball game the Driver is listening to.)  As for the lack of dialogue, people don't seem to understand why the Driver rarely talks. It is for a few reasons. The first is for him to remain mysterious. For those of you who have watched it, notice they didn't give out his name throughout the entire film? Or any real background information? With him saying less, each word has a stronger impact. You want to know who this guy is but the film doesn't tell you. The second reason is he doesn't need to. Notice the lack of dialogue mostly occurs with Irene? Instead of having some generic, cheesy talk we've heard in many other movies, he looks at her. Anyone who has fallen in love with someone will know what I'm talking about. A simple look conveys emotion so much more than talking. The actors themselves trimmed the dialogue on the screenplay to achieve this effect.  I can't say more without spoiling the movie, so watch this movie if you want to see something fresh. Don't watch it expecting it to be like the films I've mention previously.
0307455874|2.0|This book is not written by a human being, it is written by a politician running for office, afraid of offending swing voters by actually standing for something definite (other than being elected).  One gets the impression that Chairman BHO learned all his lessons in flipfloppery, feel-good piffle and general all-around wishy-washiness by sitting at the feet of Mitt Romney.  That God (or the next best thing, whichever comes first) should have learned all his tricks from the Devil should come as no surprise.  There's not a dime's worth of difference between the Dems and the Reps, and if you think there is, the more fool you.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|unistalling because it's constantly running in the background even after force closing. I'd rather stick with a post-it or Google calendar.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|There will be many people that are gonna hate this album because they think it's self indulgent and not worthwhile at all. There will also be people that will say this is the best album he has done since he left the Rolling Stones ;-) I think it should be taken at it's own merits. It's a very personal album, without any pretension. Love it or hate it. It just IS.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Good find the objects game with a storyline that's interesting. Works well on my Kindle except for not being able to pick up objects the first try. Sometimes takes repeated attempts.
B006UG909U|2.0|I have been a die-hard VH fan since I was just a kid, loving every album that came out and listening to them constantly over the last 30-some years...I love those first albums with David Lee Roth!  I do not under any circumstances like the albums with Sammy Hagar as they didn't sound at all to me like Van Halen anymore...I am not a fan of Sammy Hagar and his vocal styling is too mainstream for me...I like the rowdy, kick-ass sound of VH with DLR!  So to say I was looking forward to hearing what this album would sound like after so many glowing reviews would be an understatement.  First, Eddie Van Halen can still play his ass off!  He is still one of the best!  The same can be said about Alex!  Maybe the songs sound like an older sound but that is what I really like about them, their sound.  Unfortunately, it is this same reason I cannot stand this album.  David Lee Roth just sounds...well, old.  He can't sing/rap/yelp/scream the way he used to and when he does, it sounds so forced.  I completely enjoyed the music but then he opens his mouth and nothing good comes out of it...it ruins it!  I am sorry, but it's true.  I just can't get over it and I really, really, really wanted to feel like I was listening to Van Halen and not some shadow of who they were.  One final thing, Wolfgang is just an alright bass player.  I really miss the riffing and the singing that Michael Anthony brought to the band.  He is sorely missed but I doubt even he could save this album as DLR is really, really not anywhere near where he used to be...not even 50%.  I wanted to like this album, I did.  I listened to it once and knew I would never listen to it again.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Nice graphics. Easy and fun to play. Challenging but hints are available. works well on Kindle Fire. worth the money.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I really like this case because it's trim and fits the Fire like a smartphone cover.  I tried a couple different cases and I found them to be too bulky.  I heard one time that the Fire was meant to disappear in your hands.  I feel that the Marware case still allows that to happen.  The only minor issue I have with the case is when I'm using the stand feature.  It's easy for the front cover, that makes the stand, to fall out of the groove in the back.  But that is a minor issue and I would still recommend this case.
B006HIYNZ2|5.0|Born to Die is a languid electronica/lounge-y atmospheric affair. This album reminds me of Dido's 1998 album No Angel. Ms.Del Rey has presence and soul on this record. If you enjoyed the trip hop of the mid to late nineties you'll enjoy this with the caveat that this album is definitely meant to reach the mainstream. Critics have accused Lana Del Rey as a manufactured blah blah this and that. Quite frankly if they can manufacture pop singers this good then have at it.
B0063IH60K|1.0|don't get this app it is the worst app u could ever think of ever in the world and anywhere
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great on my fire!  Radar works perfectly.  The daily display is nice, but being able to see the weather front coming really helps with accuracy.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|best app on the planet best app in the galaxy best app known to man kind it is just the best app ever
B006UG90RM|4.0|The album takes awhile to get going. The single Tattoo is easily the worst song on the album and in many ways just sucks. I don't especially like She's the Woman. On You and Your Blues, I thought \\"hmmm, I've heard this intro before...\\". The song is cool but DLR's voice sounds bad. The first few songs he sounds like he's struggling.<br /><br />But then it surprises you and really gets going. The second half of the album is near perfect.<br /><br />My faves are Blood and Fire (my fave on the album), As Is, The Trouble With Never, Stay Frosty (obviously), and Big River.<br /><br />It's fun, it's funny. Several times I laughed out loud. It is a good time.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|I just bought this dvd and it is excellent. Adele is the best pop singer of this century. She effortlessly hits every note. Despite having throat surgery, Adele soars. Turn up your speakers, she will blow you away...
B000I8G5B2|3.0|This is one of those films that you are suppose to admire and praise if you are in the artsy film crowd, however there was very little to really like about this work. Don't get me wrong the film was shot, edited and acted all very well, so what was the problem - the story.<br /><br />First of for anyone who watches or reads a lot of science fiction will know that the premise has been done before so going into this movie one would hope for some sort of creative twists or something to differentiae this work from all of the others. The problem was there were none, and not only was there nothing different the movie never even pretended to try. This made the film so highly formulaic and predictable that it became painfully boring to finish. In fact the only reason I did finish it was to see if I was wrong -would they do something that surprised me and in the end the answer was a boring no.<br /><br />**** Spoiler Alert****<br /><br />Let be honest if you are a science fiction fan did any of this take you by surprise or did you expect it.<br /><br />Vincent was going to succeed? Totally expected<br />Irene was going to be his love interest? Saw that coming a mile away<br />Irene was genetically defective? Yawn<br />Irene would end up covering for Vincent? Of course<br />Antonio would come back in the picture and try to foil Vincent's goal? My dog saw that one coming<br />There would be the inevitable second swimming scene? Boring<br />Director Josef was the murderer? Predictable<br /><br />**** End Spoiler ****<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />I'm giving the film 3 stars because it is well made and the acting was good and if you are new to sci-fi you might find it enjoyable, if you are not it will bore the dickens out of you.
B003ZFVI8U|4.0|To be specific to this re-issue, the only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is that the DVD is encoded for square TV's making it letterboxed AND pillar boxed on a widescreen TV.  Who encodes DVD's this way nowadays?  Everything else is tip-top in this package.
B00006JIA4|5.0|Excellent remastered Queen triple CD, heaps of songs I haven't heard in ages. Excellent band and cool music. Was delivered quickly and in mint condition... Just the way I like it. Don't be a closet Queen fan, come out and buy this if you dare!
B004LWZW8S|2.0|Immortals is the latest in a slew of classical cinema epics that began back in the hoary early 2000s with Troy. The trend seemingly hit its zenith with 300, a visually exotic fist-bumping war epic in which naked men fight monstrous Iranians and their murder elephants. 300s big success was that it blurred the lines between reality and fantasy- The Persian army is made up of everything from ninjas to towering gargoylic giants, showing us the battle of Thermopylae not as it was, but as it would have been told in folk stories or dramatic poetry.  Immortals attempts to work the myth-through-the-lense-of-real-life angle as well. The minotaur is a sort of bondage commando who wears a barbed-wire cow mask, for instance. But the film is complicated somewhat by its inclusion of real-live gods who dress like they are about to appear in an Erasure video. The plot is similarly hodgepodge, with an evil king Hyperion (who appears to be an old-testament style Moloch worshiper) trying to free the Titans. Note that this is not the TITAN Hyperion trying to bail out his buddies, but just a guy NAMED Hyperion. In the course of battling Hyperion and the titans (who are represented as muddy men in silly hats who live in a box) a huge cast of uninteresting people will spend two hours or so bickering, stabbing stuff in slow motion with spears and having lengthy soft-R sex. Why? Because all those things happened in 300. But the feel is wrong; Immortals is overcomplicated where 300 was simple, grim where 300 was outrageous, and confusingly highbrow where 300 was hoards of oily men killing things.  The tradeoff is that Immortals may be the PRETTIEST film you see this decade. The movie's palate seems to have been completely rebuilt from scratch after shooting, with every color lifted from a renaissance fresco. The movie is a collection of truly beautiful images- but it would be better served as an art book than the long, tedious slog that it is.
B000Q7ZHVE|5.0|My introduction to America many years ago was through the compilation album \\"History\\" which I owe a debt to as an early encouragement along with Dan Fogelberg's work into picking up the acoustic guitar with which I've had a lifelong friendship ever since and I recall learning to play by playing along with every track on that album.  The problem is that I assumed that I had heard the best and hence I didn't need to get into the individual studio albums; what a mistake!  I've recently discovered what I was missing by picking up \\"Homecoming\\", \\"Holiday\\", \\"Hideaway\\" and especially with this album.  We get excellent folk/rock acoustic guitar playing and harmonies reminiscent of their obvious inspiration Crosby, Stills and Nash and in fact, this album is so good that you would be forgiven for thinking that this was a long lost CSN album.  America would evolve from their next album \\"Homecoming\\" onwards into a sound more like what has become uniquely their own but with this great debut we get to hear their musical inspirations and it is very interesting to see how their sound evolved from here.<br /><br />We get classics like \\"Sandman\\" and \\"A Horse With No Name\\" here but there are no fillers here as the entire album is an enjoyable listen from start to finish.  Fans are in for a treat with this mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) release as it has been well designed and assembled with a nice looking inner sleeve that closely resembles the original vinyl release and also includes a 12-page booklet containing all the lyrics in both English and Japanese. Importantly, the sound quality is good having been remastered well.<br /><br />Good content, good mlps design and good sound quality makes this an easy review.<br /><br />Highly recommended!
B006UG90RM|5.0|If you are a fan of early Van Halen (i.e. DLR era), amazing guitar playing, or simply ass-kicking, no frills, hard rock n' roll, you simply will not find a better new release! This is EASILY the best Van Halen record since Women and Children First! PLEASE don't be influenced by those who have placed a review of this album after half-assed listening to 20 second sound bytes of 4 or 5 of it's songs...this is a POWERFUL, magnificently performed collection of catchy, hook filled, SKULL CRUSHING songs, overflowing with face melting guitar solos and vocals delivered with conviction and ATTITUDE! True, David Lee Roth can't sing in as high of a register as some other lead singers. SO WHAT! Does he sing on key? YES. Does he sing with power and authority? YES. Dave delivers the goods on every track, performing with his signature vocal style and swagger that has been often imitated, but NEVER duplicated. Van HAGAR fans need not apply here. There are no wimpy, \\"radio friendly\\" singles on this record, only well crafted, BALL BUSTING hard rock MONSTERS in the style of early (pre-1984) Van Halen classics!!<br /> What songs are the best? Take your pick! Curiously, \\"Tattoo\\" is the weakest song on the record (not that it's a bad song), but after that lead off track, Edward, Dave, Al and Wolfie smash the pedal through the floor board with one mind blowing hard rocker after another! Chinatown, Bullethead, As Is, Outta Space, and The Trouble With Never are ALL tunes that stand up to any Roth-era VH classic!! Eddie's playing on this album is some of his most ferocious EVER- blistering solos full of the fleet-fingered, harmonic-infused, whammy-bar wrenching, speed picked and finger tapped genius that is EDWARD VAN HALEN!! Alex's drumming is superb- jam packed with the intricate cymbal work, double bass drum flourishes, tasty tom fills and signature snare drum sound that have all combined to make brother Al one of the greatest drummers in rock music history! Wolfgang's bass sound is fat, full and in-your face! Wolfie isn't afraid to venture into the instruments upper register either, spicing up his playing with walking lines, slides and high-end licks that only add to the intensity of this record.<br /> \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" is HANDS DOWN the best hard rock album I have bought in over a decade, far exceeding my expectations and destined to sit along side VH I, VH II, Fair Warning and W&CF as an all-time hard rock AND six-string classic! Just listening to this record made me feel energized and adrenalized! Wow! THANKS GUYS!!The MIGHTY Van Halen is back!!!ull and in-your face!

B0015DROBO|2.0|The story was a good read except there was one problem that lingers. Lizbeth does in depth profiles, but no one has ever done any looking into her background? This so-called legitimate security firm hires investigators without doing background investigations on them? I find that portion completely implausible. Other than that the book is an easy read and i thought it was fair to good.

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I have read all three of Stieg Larsson's books.  It is a shame that he died so shortly after delivering the manuscripts for the books.  He is a magical writer and will be missed.
B004LROUNG|5.0|From the first page to the epilogue, The Litigators is an adsorbing read. Grisham's novel  covers the adventues and mis-adventures of litigators attempt to pursue  a class action suit against a major pharmacy. In addition to the legal machinations, the personalities of the major characters with their flaws and strengths are realistically developed.  When you finally finish reading the epilogue, where the author relates what happens to the major characters and the law firm, it seems that the novel was based on an actual experience and case history. Whether fiction or not, John Grisham has written a very enjoyable book.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This classic by Jane Austen was amazing. I am only eleven years old and I completely fell in love with this book. After reading it, my friend read it too, and she LOVED it! This is one those timeless books...<br />It takes place in Regency England. Elizabeth Bennet meets Mr. Darcy at a party. At first, she thinks he is prideful and prejudiced. But after knowing him, they kinda fall in love...<br />I am doing a book cube project on this book, and this book is completly AMAZING!!!
B003PBB4ME|1.0|I should have searched more reviews and checked out the video review from A. King.  This is definitely flimsy and completely made out of plastic.  There is no way I am mounting my Canon 60D on this thing.  I see this thing snapping in 2 pieces very shortly.  I think everyone who rated this as a 4-5 star is in the amateur arena.  This is not a professional product be aware of that before you purchase.

0062068423|5.0|'Redbreast' is like other Scandinavian novels that I have read. Slow to start and confusing, it requires a lot of attention by the reader. This is not a novel that you can read concurrently with 4 or 5 other books. You will wonder if you will ever get through the 500+ pages as you try to make sense of the complicated multiple plots, unfamiliar names, and a writing style very familiar to European reader's but not to American readers. But you need to stick with it. You will be amazed at how compelling this novel gets as you begin to understand it and after the first 100 pages or so, you will be transformed. And when you reach page 250 or so, you will not be able to stop reading what must be one of the best mysteries in a long time.  I do have some suggestions though to get through the difficult and unfamiliar start to this story of past and present Nazis. Take notes; make a list of the characters; and reread previous sections if you think you missed something (You probably did). This will help you get through the difficult beginning of the book and to discover how astonishing good this novel really is. Highly recommended.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I know this is a port, but as this is the first time I am encountering it- I can not speak on the that- but what I can say is that I simply adored this game. I played this on my HTC 4G Evo, and had zero problems.  Overall it defending your home from waves and waves of gloriously goofy animated zombie by planting groovy plants- well this is the game for you. Gameplay is a solid challenge, and an in game almanac lets you keep track of all the zombies and plants you encounter on your journey. It does seem that all but one zombie can be found on initial preview- so if you are a completetist you'll be playing this through more than once. Once you have beat the game in adventure mode- you unlock the &quot;quickplay option&quot; &amp; two mini-games (one conveyor belt game- exactly like those conveyor belt levels in game &amp; one bowling level- uber fun &amp; my favorite). Once these three options are open to you- this game really adds a new level of fun &amp; addiction.  Overall I would say this is easily worth the price of admission- as it will give you endless hours of timewasting fun.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I have absolutely no doubt in my mind, that this new VH album is one of the most anticipated and historic albums in 20 years!!  Each song, including Tatoo, captures the classic and unbeatable sounds and feels.  I personally could care less if these are older songs or not, they are still Van Halen's songs....and have never been released before....so just as new as anything else they could have written yesterday!!  There is no true VH Halen fan that can think this is a bad album.  With all the over-synthesized pop albums out now, talentless \\"rappers\\", and suicidal Country stars....there is nothing better than a revisit to the good old times when music was actually full of talent, and actual music!!  I would day a majority of the haters really don't know good music when they hear it, and their reviews should not be heeded as valid until you've given them a fair listn on your own!!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I already thought it was great, then I had the built in narrator read Noah to me. Kicked it to another level, because reading along as you listen is so immersive, yet more relaxing than just reading. It also makes the beautiful poetry of KJV accessible to more of God's children. Have not managed to get the plan reminder to alert me, but I'm sure it is my error. Enjoy the Word made Kindle!
B001DCQI9G|5.0|This is a wonderful reissue of the wonderful Mendelssohn symphonic cycle by Karajan and<br />the Berliner Philharmoniker. Here we are with the best from Karajan's mastery and magic playing<br />his typical symphonic repertoire. Those performances are plenty of poetics, beauty and the<br />highest standards of balance, brilliance and care on detail. This is with no doubt one of<br />the best Mendelssohn's symphonic cycles on record, and a strong competitor with Abbado's or<br />Dohnanyi's. The highest point in this cycle is undoubtedly a heavenly \\"Scottish\\" that doesn't<br />see a serious competitor to my taste. This is a safe recommendation for anyone looking for<br />a Mendelssohn complete cycle.

If there's a better one out there, I haven't come across it yet.
B006UG90RM|2.0|I expected so much more with this release. They have a few new songs but the majority are from a bootleg called \\"The Warner Brothers Sessions\\" from around 1976-77.<br />Same arrangements and solos. Some note for note.  No magic here just dragging the faults to fill new product.
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Sure the movie is \\"minimalist\\". The Soundtrack is awful, who chose these vapid songs? This movie is about anger, hopelessness, and disturbing violence. The soundtrack should not be in line with \\"bubble brain\\" pop songs. Distinctive here,however,is that Gosling is one of the most dynamic method actors to appear on the screen since Dean and Brando (I call the attention to Dean, because of Gosling's evident physical beauty). Everything is \\"bottled up\\" like Brando in \\"One Eyed Jacks\\": there is volcanic anger lurking always just below the surface. You see this example clearly in the \\"noir type\\" scene in the diner. At first you would think Gosling is a simpleton, and then the eyebrows furrow and he says to the \\"hood\\" bugging him: \\"how about I kick your teeth down your throat\\". You couldn't train this kind of restrained acting. It's a gift. Watch this talent become one of the best film actors of a generation!  The errors of this film devolve on its inability to grab you with the sense of complete \\"alienation\\" that it is trying to generate. Sure there are the continuous \\"overheads\\" of \\"alienation land\\", i.e., Los Angeles, but you don't get \\"Taxi-Driver\\" here. Gosling is not the young De Niro, and the divine Scorsese is not at the helm. I would say this film is a jumping off place for Gosling: If he can carry this through to other films, he will be the best we have in our time.
B006OAB3ME|4.0|I don't get Paul anymore.

B004BJMEO6|5.0|I highly recommend this film.  A must see.  The actresses' chemistry is so convincing that you actually feel that these two belong together.  A well acted film in that the characters' emotions are felt by the viewer as well.  I cry every time I watch it.

B005LAIGSM|1.0|There's a review on IMDb of The Vow that says the romance movie \\"keeps its distance from clich&eacute;s and cheesiness,\\" and it just made me wonder just what in the hell this person saw that I didn't. The Vow is the story of Leo (Channing Tatum) and Paige (Rachel McAdams), a married couple that is very much in love. One evening, they get into a terrible car accident and Paige loses her recent memory meaning she doesn't remember the love of her life or their relationship. She basically still has a thing for her ex-fianc&eacute; Jeremy (Scott Speedman) and doesn't understand why she doesn't have her family in her life. Leo does everything in his power to try and remind Paige of the love they once shared, but Paige is showing no signs of recovery.<br /><br />The one good thing The Vow has going for it is that there is decent chemistry between Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams. There's at least a mild connection between the two and the scenes when they're alone are perhaps the most powerful this romance has to offer. That isn't saying much though since a good portion of their on-screen time together is devoted to them looking longingly at one another, laughing endlessly, or acting like Beaky Buzzard from Looney Tunes. Then when they do open their mouth, the most inane excuse of flattery comes oozing from their lips. You'll debate on punching yourself in the face in hopes of knocking yourself out to prevent seeing the rest of this monstrosity.<br /><br />Why is it that every time there's a movie like this revolving around a brain injury NOBODY knows anything about it? They all play ignorant or gullible and basically have no clue as to what they have to deal with. You'd think that they would've seen the dozen or so romance films they borrowed from before actually setting out and ripping them off. Rachel McAdams has pretty much been trying to make The Notebook again ever since 2004. There have been some exceptions like Red Eye, Wedding Crashers, and Sherlock Holmes, but everything in between has been along the same lines. It's as if The Vow recycles every Rachel McAdams movie you've ever seen and tries to combine them with the concept from The Lookout or Vanilla Sky, but it feels so regurgitated and so familiar that it comes off feeling like it heavily borrowed from The Number 23 which is the furthest thing from a compliment any movie could ask for. Is there honestly much of a difference between The Vow and The Time Traveler's Wife?<br /><br />In the meantime, you'll be groaning over every decision Paige makes after the accident. It's not as if Channing Tatum isn't to blame as well as his words and actions are just as mushy as the ones Rachel McAdams makes, but it's the way Paige saying she has to make decisions for herself only to wind right back where she started is what makes the entire concept, the actor's performances, and the entire movie totally and completely pointless. Channing Tatum plays guitar in one sequence that'll just make you hope and pray he doesn't break into song. Just because you have brain damage doesn't mean you have to be stupid. Is that a concept that's so hard to grasp? Leave it to a movie labeling itself as a romance being capable of triggering feelings of disgust, frustration, and hatred for fictional characters you probably haven't ever felt this strongly before.<br /><br />The Vow IS extremely clich&eacute; and cheesy. Emotions are forced, sappy scenes go on way too long, and the movie is nothing but a string of stupid decisions. The Vow illustrates that nothing stands in the way of fate and even if you had the chance to do things over again that you'd follow the exact same path even if it wasn't your intention. This point is idiotic. Given the opportunity, why would you want an important event in your life to go down exactly the same way? The entire movie comes off as a complete waste of time. The Vow is the prime example of regression, moving backwards in life, or perhaps standing still for entirely too long. The Vow is typical and forcefully romantic trite that will make you wish you get into a car accident on the way home in hopes of getting your own form of brain damage to keep you from remembering this God awful excuse of a movie.hat will make you wish you get into a car accident on the way home in hopes of getting your own form of brain damage to keep you from remembering this God awful excuse of a movie.

B005LAIGRS|3.0|Safe House has Denzel Washington return to the role everyone loves him for; that untouchable, bad ass, man of the hour kind of role that he's essentially played the majority of his career. Meanwhile, Ryan Reynolds sets out to try to prove he's capable of being more than a raunchy goofball. CIA agent Matt Weston (Reynolds) has anxiously been waiting to prove himself. He's been babysitting an empty safe house for twelve months and is eager to get out in the field. Matt gets his chance when Tobin Frost (Washington), ex-CIA agent, traitor to the organization, and currently one of the CIA's most wanted fugitives, is escorted there. But things are turned upside down when a group of unknown soldiers attack the safe house and take out the entire team who accompanied Frost. Now in over his head, Matt tries to cope with handling the situation on his own while Frost does his best to manipulate the rookie.<br /><br />You'll probably notice the visual style of Safe House right away. It makes full use of that raw, gritty style. It's especially grainy at times as fluorescent lighting seems to jump off the screen. Judging by how the movie looks alone, you'd think Tony Scott directed it. But it's actually the English language debut of Swedish director Daniel Espinosa. So it just seems as though he patterned Safe House after Tony Scott's films. It doesn't take long for negotiations to get tense. Those moments in between the mayhem are when Safe House is at its best. It's like a game of tug of war between Frost's way of manipulating and Matt's attempt to stick to protocol while also juggling a relationship. Those moments of panic are explosive; especially the one at the safe house Matt was in charge of and the intense car chase immediately afterwards. Safe House has a way of getting really LOUD when you're totally expecting it. It usually involves a gunshot or six, but it's kind of the movie's way of telling you that some heavy stuff is about to go down.<br /><br />The majority of the movie is basically Matt trying to prove himself as an agent all while absolutely everything that you could imagine to go wrong does. Safe House is actually pretty damn good for nearly half of the movie. Sure, Denzel is playing a character you've seen him play a few dozen times before but he does it so well and the audience obviously eats it up. So why wouldn't you give the paying viewer what they want to see? Ryan Reynolds makes the most of his performance though. He seems to be the most emotionally invested actor of the film meaning he shows the most emotion and has the most range. The movie kind of gets coiled up in itself with everything it has going for it in the last twenty minutes or so. It's like it couldn't handle the pressure of being a fairly strong action thriller or something. It becomes extremely excessive and it throws a ton of twists at you in this small amount of time. It's difficult to care about any of them when all of the characters feel so similar and you can pretty much see them coming a mile away. The movie follows this certain path that you may be expecting, but then it shifts direction before shifting again and shifting back again. Did you ever see the movie Basic with John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson? Safe House was reminiscent of the amount of twists in Basic.<br /><br />Safe House begins as this white knuckled thriller with a fairly strong screenplay from first time screenwriter David Guggenheim. The action is heavy, the story reels you in, and the performances of both Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds are pretty superb. Everything eventually falls apart though as Safe House falls victim to stereotypical mediocrity. Brutal and intriguing at times and completely frustrating at others, Safe House is mostly exactly what you're expecting and the type of action thriller you've seen done several times before.

B000FCKRDI|5.0|THIS IS MY FAVORITE BOOK. Where should I start. Sebastian was in need of an heiress and Westcliff was attracted to an American one he did not particularly want, neither did Westcliff's mother. They both probably thought they were doing Westcliff a favor in It Happened One Autumn, the previous wallflower book.<br />As for Sebastian, payback is a b___. Now Evie, the shyest wallflower (and might I add the most calculating) is about to return the favor by hauling penniless Sebastian himself off to Gretna Green. Alls fair, right. Evie's back is against the wall and has a choice between living with relatives that will probably kill her for her inheritance or marrying the last man on earth that she or her friends would choose for her, at least he has the social standing to protect Evie from her abusive relatives. Evie is shy but not stupid she is running out of time. Evie is trying to get married for her survival, not love.<br />We learn a lot about Evie's and Sebastian's deepest needs on the 2 day journey to Gretna Green. The rake is the only kind of man that will draw a girl as shy as Evie out of her shell.<br />There is so much to this story, I could go on and on. My favorite romance novel formula is marriage then love. I am still trying to figure out at what point did Sebastian fall in love with Evie, I think it's on the way to Gretna Green when Sebastian realizes how much mistreatment Evie has endured, he doesn't have the heart to add to it. Sebastian's my favorite character.<br />The wallflowers are a loyal bunch, they always take care of their own!!!
0439023521|5.0|There are several reasons I resisted reading this series up til now. I generally avoid books that have generated a lot of hype as I find my tastes to be somewhat different from those of the \\"mainstream\\" crowd. Also the fact that Stephanie Meyer was listed right next to Stephen King in the celebrity reviews, somewhat turned me off on the book. Even my neice's enthusiastic appreciation  of the book did little to overcome my initial resistance. But when I finally gave in so far as to read the first few pages of it with the \\"Look Inside\\" feature offered by Amazon, I was hooked. I read as much as it would let me then immediately ordered it in paperback. I waited impatiently for it all week, wishing I had just bought the kindle version so I could be reading it NOW!  When it finally arrived it was all I could do to hold off a few hours and get the rest of my day done with before sitting down and picking up right where I had left off. I read for hours that night and got nearly halfway through. I could hardly sleep for wondering what would come next. I picked it up again first thing with my morning coffee and simply could not stop reading all day. I kept telling myself, 'just one more chapter, then I'll stop and do something else for awhile'. But the story had me completely in its grip and before I knew it, it was afternoon and I had finished it. Rarely has a book held me so enthralled. I am an avid Harry Potter fan and the first to admit that I read most of the books as soon as they came out and finished in a matter of days. This blows all of them out of the water. I have never finished a book so quickly, nor been left so 'hungry' for the next in the series. I can't wait to find out what happens next and am only annoyed that I will have to wait til the next paycheck to order book two.  Don't miss this book! It is a rare gem of a read and a unique treat for the literary senses. No other story can compare in terms of grit, heart and perfectly choreographed action, all told through the use of exemplary narrative style without the slightest hint of pretentiousness. At the very least, give the first few pages a read with the Look Inside feature and see what you think. It'll hook you in a two paragraphs flat!

B004UUKDNA|4.0|So... here comes another full throttle post of snarkiness... or is it? Let's kick the gates open on this review with the fact that by song three on this disc I have yet to stop bopping around and nodding my head to this album. YOWSA.  `Helena Beat'? Slinky, sultry.... it's gritty sounding, but I still kind of want to put on my leggings and get stepping to funky town. We all know `Pumped Up Kicks' and it has this poppy synth beat that makes you at least slightly forget the fact that it's about a kid bringing a gun to school & unloading. That's the nicest way such a topic can be broached.  Then.... comes `Call It What You Want' and let's get one thing straight (I said one thing) I rarely ever listen to a song the first time and get so tickled that I need a repeat immediately. Such is the case in point with `Call It What You Want'... bc call it what you want I'm loving this album the first time around. Also a rarity...  `Don't Stop (Color On the Walls)' has probably been in so many car commercials that we dream in this song...and hopefully at least technicolor. `Waste' follows up and makes us feel better for enjoy the song before even though it's used to whore out VW's... or some similar car. I just see the munchkins from `The Wizard of Oz' and the Whos of `The Grinch Who Stole Christmas' all joining hands around the fireside and singing along to this. Not the oompa-loompas though. Those things are the stuff of children's nightmares. Just like the boat ride in `Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' (with Gene Wilder of course) is.  `I Would Do Anything For You' has synth beats that 80s Whitney and Bobby envy, cheesy melodies that NKOTBSB would murder their mums for and a simple piano riff that makes me wanna slow motion Molly Ringwald around the room...  `Houdini' is where I have to start giving some real props. Bc every song on the album may have some similarities... but they all distinctly stand apart... do you KNOW how rare that is?! It's why all of you should celebrate me more. Bc I'm crazy original. Or just crazy.  I honestly didn't think I'd get so adjusted and actually enjoy Mark Foster's falsetto vocals... but by song four I'm practically sold and by song seven I've turned into a teenage screaming girl ready to throw my undies at him onstage. I don't really know what's causing this bc I'm never so optimistic about albums. I think this album also has a broader demographic than originally expected as well since the synth heads and Queen lovers of the 80s... may have found their home. And those who love a filthy amount of percussion and varied percussion (it's far more rare than you think) will find it delectable... I kinda wanna go all `Stomp' in my apartment now. But I'd probably make nowhere near palatable sounds on top of breaking all the pots and tupperware I own. I mean this disc even has some big swing band percussion and bass to it that just might get wing-tips tapping...  All in all, it's been a long time that I really enjoyed an album start to finish... most of the time I zone out bc it's the same ish I've heard over and over again, usually on someone else's record 5 years earlier. This one... sure, nothing is really original anymore, but piecing together such variation? THAT'S where Foster the People stand out.  I'm going with a solid four stars on this one. If I weren't such an uber snob and had a heart it'd be four and a 1/2. But I don't... so don't get any ideas that I'm getting soft kids.

B00627KV5Y|1.0|The text in this book is defective. At least one character (I'm guessing its a \\"-\\" the dash,) is encoded in a way that my Kindle Touch can't display it, so it shows up as a small square with numbers in it. Whatever it is its spread throughout the text making reading an annoyance.  There is also a table of contents. But unlike the real book version, it only has chapter numbers but no text. In the book, each chapter has a title.  I'm going to get a refund for this. Not because the 99cents is such a big deal, but maybe if its annoying enough to Amazon they will take it out of their catalog so no one else can end up with it.

Since previously reviewed locations are available in the Locations button it's not that big of a deal now, but I can foresee aggravation in my future after there are many locations to look through to find cities I return to.  I didn't find any help in the app.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|l used to think the AccuWeather app that I have used for a long time on my iPhone was the best weather app, until I discovered this one.  Now I wish there was an iPhone version of this app.  This app provides a wealth of weather data -- more than any other app -- in a few sets of well laidout, graphical and textual presentations.  It is a really great weather resource.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|My kids enjoy this app. It keeps them occupied for hours if I would let them play for that long.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this cover.  The other reviews had me a little concerned about being too small or smelling funny but neither are the case.  It fits perfect, smells fine, and protects my Kindle Fire perfectly. There is even room for my stylus  :)
B00702MUYA|5.0|Well, I had to ease my way in, one song at a time. Now I've made it all the way through. And there'll be no way out.  There are lovely albums in the Cohen catalogue which are not quite wondrous (Various Positions, Songs from a Room, Recent Songs), and wondrous albums which are not quite lovely (The Future, Death of a Ladies' Man). And then there are these: Songs of Leonard Cohen, Songs of Love and Hate, I'm Your Man, 10 New Songs .. and now, Old Ideas.  We're all Going Home. I caught The Darkness, indeed. Amen. Don't believe the hype, nor the carping. Believe what your heart tells you, when you open it to these gifts from the deep.
B000002KXV|5.0|The Nightfly. As if you came here expecting to find a bad review. A few simple clicks is all it takes for you to be in posession of (even if not the absolute finest album of all time, then the second). Once you play this I believe that you'll find yourself hummin or singin it more times than you do all of your other music. Oh, I think I forgot to say how much I like this collection of songs. P.S. I thought I could do this in less than 20 words. Do not click away from here. Buy this album. Trust Me. Would I lie to you?

B0071XO8RA|5.0|...read this, really, honestly, no BS... Then why did you give it 5 stars? You gonna add a punch line yet? Yes, well, I would if you shut up and let me... damn... now where was I? Oh yeah, see the problem I had with this book, as it is a book now, was the fact that it ended and I have to wait till #6... If I had gotten this later in my life I wouldn't have to wait for #6 or even possibly (Hopefully) numbers 7 through 1,000,000 (Is that too much to hope for?) but anywho, the feeling I got while reading this that I wanted to play Fallout and mod in some Silos was great but not enough to pull me away from reading...  Once again Hugh Howey has proven his literary genius, his word-smithing prowess, his ability to spin words into worlds and suck you in past the proverbial event horizon into an alternate universe that feels just as real as our own.  Thank you Mr. Howey and please keep it up! (No seriously... hurry up with #6...)

B006UG90RM|5.0|I was 14 when \\"1984\\" came out, so Van Halen WAS rock at the time I was just really becoming aware of current rock music. And they dominated. \\"Jump\\", \\"Panama\\" and \\"Hot For Teacher\\" played endlessly on MTV. Their other hits were staples of rock radio as they still are today. Just as I became a fan, Dave left. Van Halen was never the same for me after that, and I always regretted that they never made any more full-length records with Dave.  When I heard about this reunion record, I had very high hopes but low expectations. I never thought it would ever even happen in the first place. And even with the best intentions and maximum effort by everyone, it still could have turned out to be average. Look at how many major bands try so hard to make a good comeback record and end up with a mediocre result. And major bands like Van Halen are naturally held to a higher standard. With any band, even a good new record is going to sound slightly disappointing when compared to the best they created when they were in their prime.  Luckily I can report that \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" is flat out fantastic. I think any VH fan resisting it is missing out on a lot of pleasure.  I'm one of the few people who actually really like the first single \\"Tattoo\\", but I will agree that it's not very representative the rest of the album. And while \\"Big River\\" and \\"Beats Workin'\\" are serviceable (and already quite popular) tunes, they don't really do much for me. They're good songs, and they're very Van Haleney, they just seem sort of ordinary and unadventurous compared to the rest of the album. That's just my opinion. (And maybe I just think that \\"Stay Frosty\\" would be the perfect way to close what I consider an amazing string of songs.)  From the beginning of the intense \\"She's The Woman\\" straight through to the end of the incredibly joyous and irresistible boogie of \\"Stay Frosty\\", this is one of the best rock albums I've ever heard. I can't think of anything at all to criticize beyond that \\"honeybabysweetiedoll\\" is a crappy and silly title for such a awe inspiring rock song.  \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" sounds so muscular and confident. The production is top notch. There are so many musical ideas and so much range on display, often in the same song. Sometimes it's unclear where one song ends and the next one starts, and I think that's a huge plus. Every song has so many different levels and so much variety. Rhythms stop and start on a dime, time signatures change back and forth, a song will have a sunny chorus then suddenly dive down deep into darker places before leaping back up and out into the blue sky once again. Every note and beat sounds like it's been carefully considered. These are some complex songs. \\"The Trouble With Never\\" sounds like it's going to be a predictable song with a goofy chorus, but anyone judging it by the first minute is going to be surprised. I loved it; it was the song that impressed me the most upon fist listen. \\"As Is\\" is another good example of a many faceted song, and I think it might be my favorite song on the album. It's a sheer masterpiece, in my humble opinion.  It's hard to choose a favorite song, though. I like \\"Blood And Fire\\" more and more each time I hear it, and the first time I heard it, it gave me chills. I think it's the perfect Van Halen reunion song. \\"China Town\\" is a bona fide instant classic and every bit as multi-faceted as any other track. (I'd be wary of anyone that claims they like hard rock music and says they don't like \\"China Town.\\") \\"Bullethead\\" and \\"Outta Space\\" are two more high quality, high octane numbers that really kick.  Alex and Wolfgang are a rock solid rhythm section, and Wolfgang plays a pretty mean bass. Eddies' playing is like another voice in each song. There are so many incredible examples of guitar skill on display here, but the numerous solos never seem showy, unnecessary, or obligatory. They're all woven so deep into the fabric of each song that the solos really BECOME the song. I know that may sound obvious, but a lot of music production today seems like a collection of instruments with a guitar track laid up on top. On this record the guitar really drives the songs. To me, that makes the range and precision of the musicianship even more impressive. There is such a range of style and creativity that you really have to hand it to Eddie for putting it all together. And he sounds as good as ever, burning up that fretboard like a man on a mission.  A few more words about the precision I keep mentioning. Make no mistake: There is no jamming. They are not loose. Even the faux-looseness of \\"Stay Frosty\\" is just a well planned ruse before the song kicks in with the full band. All of the music here sounds like it was meticulously written, arranged, rehearsed, and performed like clockwork. When major bands do that, often it can lead to an overly professional (read: sterile) sound. That's not the case here. Astoundingly, all the music still feels warm and fun. It swings and grooves, yet the band is always tighter than a drum. The band sounds hungry. They're rocking with serious intensity. They're playing like they have something to prove. I guess after being away for 14 years, and a quarter century after Dave left, they did.  Speaking of David Lee Roth, I think he's just great here. Some have commented that they think he's lost some range in his voice. Maybe so, but to me it sounds like he's going places he's never been before as a singer. He growls, yelps and yowls just like I remember, yet now his voice is so smooth at times he sounds like an entirely different person altogether. He sounds expressive, strong, and unbelievably enthusiastic on every track. It sounds to me like he's trying to have the elasticity in his vocal performance match the pyrotechnics of Eddie's playing, and I think he succeeded brilliantly. And his lyrics are inspired, filled with vivid images, clever quips, and nice past Van Halen references slipped in now and again. The exultation in his voice as he sings about \\"doing the victory dance\\" sounds 100% genuine. His happiness is truly infectious.  Listening to \\"A Different Kind Of Truth\\" is a consistently entertaining and rewarding experience. It has focus, fire, passion, determination, precision, hunger, power, intensity, heaviness, lightness and pure joy. In the years ahead, whenever I am ready to rock, this will be one album I'll know I can reliably return to again and again. It deserves every superlative hurled at it and more. I don't think it just compares favorably to Van Halen's past work, I believe it might just rank up there with some of the greatest rock albums of all time.  It made me feel like a teenager again. What can I say?
0307888908|5.0|Reid Hoffman and Ben Casnocha have written a book for people with normal jobs. Corporate jobs. What they call the \\"escalator model.\\" Show up for 9-5 every day, get a steady paycheck, and earn promotions every so often.<br /><br />The two explain that the classic model is dying. Then they explain in understandable way, that you need to embrace your personal brand, engage with the people 'around' you in a meaningful way, and have an eye on the adjacent possible (what they call, in classic bizbook lingo, ABZ planning).<br /><br />To that segment, this is a pretty decent call to step it up, hustle as they say, and own their careers. So if you know someone still in that mindset, send them this book.<br /><br />But for those of us who have already embraced this approach, or, honestly, will probably never know any other, this book will read like like a primer. That's not a knock, especially since I haven't found the perfect book on this topic, but something to be aware of.
0553801473|4.0|Well, the Author is a screenplay writer, so he has that innate skill of drawing out a great story to the point of it becoming tedious. It's pretty obvious the whole series was written for the explicit purpose of being turned into a Television series!  Once you get over that issue, who cares, it's a great story with fantastic characters so brilliantly portrayed as before. You just want more, and you just cannot put it down. So I guess mission accomplished. I'm ready and eager for the next one.......
B001M5UDGS|3.0|I am a Whedon fan but I was disappointed in this.  There were a few good lines that made us laugh, but overall this was not a great show.  As a fan of both Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillon, I had some expectations of this movie and they were not met in any way.
B0021L8V0W|3.0|Salt, the movie wanted to be part 007 and part Bourne. It succeeded in neither. At least, James Bond franchise knows not to take itself seriously. And in Bourne movies we care about the protagonist. With Salt we have James Bond extravaganza which we suppose to care about but we don't. Angelina Jolie is a wonderful action actress but she was never capable of expressing an emotion on screen to save her life and the character is not developed for us to at least pretend to care. The husband!? Care even less.  OK, so now that we are through the movie impression, the action on the screen is top notch, though suspended from reality in the best traditions of Die Hard franchise. The disc comes with three different versions of the movie, providing very alternative takes on some of the twists and how the story concludes. I, personally preferred the Unrated Extended cut. It allows us to guess on who's side Salt really is till the very late part of the movie, keeping the suspense going. It also has very different ending from both Theatrical and Director's cuts, which concludes the movie better, IMO.  Video and audio quality are both top notch - referential material for how the movie should be presented on Blu-Ray. The bonus materials are just that - bonus, as they do not carry any eye-opening information about movie or the espionage business.  Overall, this is an OK movie that definitely needs to be watched for any action junkie. Rent the Blu-Ray to see alternative cuts and give an exercise to your home theater. Return it next day and go on with your life.
1451648537|5.0|I have an interesting perspective on Steve Jobs. When I was growing up in the 90's, I was a completely Mac user and PCs were far from my mind. I loved everything that Apple did and read computer manuals and books like they were sacred writings. My cousin worked for Apple as an engineer, and then in their education department, and he would bring by new gadgets for me to play with (the Apple Quicktake Digital Camera was lent to us LOOOONG before any I knew had ever HEARD of a digital camera).<br /><br />From there I used to go to the MacWorld Expo in San Francisco and see all the new developments and announcements in the Mac industry. And when Steve Jobs came back to the company...yeah, I was excited. My cousin ended his career at Apple after experiencing Steve Jobs' way of getting things done first hand...and I went on to get a PC and learn Windows and become an IT Support Tech. But Steve Jobs...I can't help but think of him like he was a famous distant family member that I personally knew and loved, despite his mood swings and temper and general craziness. When he died I cried. And when I read this book, I was deeply moved.<br /><br />A Hippie, a titan of industry, an entrepreneur, a visionary Leader<br /><br />Steve Jobs had quite a life. He was given up at birth and adopted. He was a brat. He was a prankster. He was the kind of kid that parents lecture \\"If you keep acting like that you'll never be able to keep a job.\\" And yes, he was a crazy hippie who grew a long beard and didn't bathe or use deodorant because his nutso vegan diet would make him odorless (only in your own mind Steve).<br /><br />He was in the right place at the right time and met, knew, and got help from all the right people. His buddy was Steve Wozniak, one of the greatest engineers in history. He worked for Atari and the head honcho liked him enough to have him work nights instead of firing his sorry rear. But more than that, Steve Jobs always had a knack for taking advantage of people and pushing them hard (which is what business is all about right?).<br /><br />He took a trip to India to seek enlightenment. He went to one of the most expensive colleges in the United States and dropped out so he could drop in to Calligraphy classes. He built a phone hacking machine and sold it to people and DIDN'T get prison time for it. And oh yeah, he co-founded Apple Computer.<br /><br />And that's where the story goes from good to awesome. If you like your Silicon Valley Computer History and want a good book to put next to your video of Triumph of the Nerds (not to be confused with Revenge of the Nerds) you will love all the details that are in this book about the early history of Apple, and how Steve Jobs loved and hated people and they loved and hated him (and often both feelings at the same time and mutually).<br /><br />Truly, I thought I knew my computer history. But this book makes me feel like I eavesdropped on stuff so crazy you can't make it up (from Steve Jobs' job interview questions to how one person thought he could leave the company by being offensive enough).<br /><br />Of course, the part that a lot of people will find most interesting is probably how Steve went from ousted from the company he founded to running a bunch of losing propositions (a company that made educational computers no one wanted and another that made rendering software no one could afford) and then using them to take on Disney and Apple and make Pixar and Apple two of the biggest forces in the world of technology worth billions of dollars.<br /><br />I was around and listening when Steve Jobs came back to Apple and I saw all those announcements of new products to roaring crowds at the MacWorld Expos. That was a huge time in computer history, and just plain entertaining history. It's truly epic to read the story of how Jobs went from no one to a young aspiring business leader to a millionaire that no one cared about to one of the most important, wealthy, and loved/feared, famous CEOs in world history.<br /><br />The Man Himself<br /><br />While all that is fine and well for people who like their history, what about the man? Well if you ever had any confusion as to Steve Jobs' character this book will straighten it out for you quick. He was a charismatic, enthusiastic, idealistic, driven, controlling, blunt, demeaning, abusive, delusional, tyrannical, angelic, monstrous, brilliant, NUTBAR son-of-a-gun who changed the world by mending it to his will and inspiring/demeaning the heck out of anybody he crossed paths with.<br /><br />He was a Narcissist with abandonment issues who dedicated his life to creating what in his mind were great works of art to share with the world, and yet he took his girlfriend miles to a high-end shop to show her a dress that he had described in great detail he felt would be perfect for her...and said \\"You should buy it.\\" A guy who had such huge self esteem issues and childish thinking that when his own company wouldn't give him the badge with the number 1 instead of the number 2 he cried.<br /><br />And yet this same man gave life to several computing and entertainment REVOLUTIONS, bringing personal computers to the unwashed masses, and smiles to faces of children in movie theaters. But there lies perhaps the most profound lesson of all.<br /><br />He became what he hated...and didn't have guts to face it<br /><br />George Lucas said in his documentary Empire of Dreams that he had become what he hated. HE had become the evil empire/big brother/big corporation. While people like Steve Job and George Lucas may always THINK they are an indie fighting the good fight against big brother...at a certain point of success when their corporations are worth BILLIONS of dollars...they ARE big brother. At least George Lucas realized this. Steve Jobs just didn't ever want to accept the fact that he was an arrogant jerk that his own audience was growing to hate despite all the years of love.<br /><br />In the years leading up to Steve Jobs death the only thing talked about more than his health was how incredibly controlling/restricting/secretive/arrogant/unfriendly/just-plain-evil? Apple was becoming. As their closed system grew and grew it became obvious that if it were to become universal freedom of speech would disappear on tablets and smart phones and only the rich could afford any digital device. How did this come about? Wasn't Apple supposed to be the affordable friendly alternative for creative types? How did it become a super-expensive status symbol?<br /><br />I have my own perspective on these questions as I became deeply disillusioned with Apple Computer as it changed its name, changed its designs, and became increasingly snobby and shiny (Apple used to be grassroots, now that's been taken over by Linux). When it stopped being about friendly products and became about snobby ones I actually (shockingly) began to HATE Apple products. After suffering through the horror that was iTunes and the new Mac OS X (that bore almost no resemblance to the Mac OS I had grown to love all my life) I moved on to Windows and other products. And apparently Apple never missed me because the less I liked them and the less products I bought the better the company did.<br /><br />As for Steve Jobs, I just find it sad how he never realized how much he had alienated people like me who had been so loyal to his company for so long (I even hate the STORES which are pretty much a symbol of everything that I find alienating, cold, aloof, and uncomfortable). I still view him like a relative...just more like one that struck it rich and then forgot I existed.<br /><br />What does all that have to do with the book? Personally I find the JOURNEY from one end of the spectrum to the other to be an amazing story. It's like a real-life Citizen Kane (a story of idealism corrupted by wealth and power). It's a story well worth reading and contemplating.<br /><br />The Book<br /><br />The point of all that at the end of the day...is that this book captures all that and more about one of the most important figures of the century (love him or hate him or both). It's well-written. It's entertaining. It covers about as much history corporate and personal as it can without being a thousand pages or more.<br /><br />You'll find stories about Steve Jobs' entire life from birth to death, and interviews with everyone important in his life. You'll get lots and lots of comments from Jobs himself on just about everything in the book, and when you're done you will understand Steve Jobs...about as well as anyone can understand such a complicated person.<br /><br />If like me you grew up during the Apple ascendency, decline, and rebirth you may find this, as I did, a fascinating trip down memory lane filled with memories of better times (I'd give anything to take the computer industry back to where it was when Windows 95 and Mac OS were around, great computer games were plentiful, and everything seemed fresh and exciting in the world of computing).<br /><br />You may even learn a thing or two from some of Jobs insights (I agree with him completely that the design of a company's building is vital, PowerPoint is for people who don't know what they are talking about, and meetings should revolve around usage of the whiteboard).<br /><br />If you work in an industry that designs ANYTHING you can at the very least learn from his passion for simpler, better design of just about everything (although pushing away a hospital mask because he didn't like the design when he was barely conscious and refusing to eat food because it wasn't good enough when he was dying of malnourishment was pushing things by anyone's measurements).<br /><br />The only flaw I find with this book is that the author is not impartial. The author repeatedly (especially towards the end of the book) makes assertions that reminded me of physics class in college (when the instructor likened belief in God to the tooth-fairy). Just because you personally think that there is no merit in alternative cancer treatments is no reason to say so in a biography (any more than it would be my place to say that having a cancer operation probably accelerated the cancer and killed Steve Jobs, for example).

0812992792|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son is an epic novel.  I was reminded of The Poisonwood Bible while reading it, or Pillar of the Earth.  It's the kind of book that you're glad to have made it through, but it's pretty tough going.<br /><br />The novel is about an orphan whose father runs the orphan camp.  The orphan's name is Pak Ju Do and it's his story that we follow throughout the novel.  Do's inner strength through an unimaginable life of hardship, shines through.  He's always helping others and it's through this trait, that Do is given opportunities to escape his miserable life.<br /><br />I'd always heard that people were starving in North Korea and that Kim Jong Il was insane, but to actually visit his insanity through the ordinary lives of his people was stunning.  It takes a master story teller to bring us a totally foreign world, allowing us to understand what it's like to live in a world we can't begin to comprehend.  Adam Johnson does an outstanding job of bringing to life people who barely exist even to themselves.  Names mean nothing because they can change according to the 'Dear Leader's' whims.  Family's can be blown apart for the slightest infraction of arbitrary rules set up by a supreme leader with no grip on reality.<br /><br />The only thing 'Dear Leader' knows is his own inner world where he is perfect and everyone else lives only to populate his world.  This book gives us a look into the mind of a total sociopath, a man unable to feel the slightest compassion for his fellow human being.  In the hands of a less able story-teller, Kim Jong Il might have been seen as a cartoon character because of his intense neurosis.  Adam Johnson gives us a man, and what it's like to live under his rule.  How you are tortured into losing your own identity, how up is down, and black is white, until killing those you love is the ultimate act of sacrifice.<br /><br />I have a hard time even believing that a place like North Korea even exists in our world today.  The repression of its people is unbelievable.  I kept trying to wrap my mind around the answer as to how the 'Dear Leader' could treat his people like they were mere toys put on earth to amuse him, and it finally came to me.  We do the same thing here in the Western world, but we do it to animals instead of people.  We keep them locked up, we keep them from their children, and we don't see their suffering because we're not animals.  I'm not any sort of militant animal lover, in fact I'm not even a vegetarian, but I had to understand this book, and this is the idea that came to me.  And I'm absolutely sure that we would put a stop to such practices if they were brought to light, but this is not a place that rant, other than to say that the idea came to me as I tried to understand North Korea.<br /><br />The Orphan's Master's Son is not as easy read.  It challenges the reader on so many levels, as the characters challenge themselves.  This is the kind of novel that will live on in your mind, because it changes you.  I can no longer ignore North Korea and its people.  I'll now watch for them in the news and pray that someday they can break the bonds of their captures.n of its people is unbelievable.

0062073486|5.0|Among Agatha Christie's massive collection of published books, three titles stand out: [[ASIN:0062073494 Murder on the Orient Express]], [[ASIN:0062073567 The Murder of Roger Ackroyd]], and this, \\"And Then There Were None\\". Widely considered to be her very best novels, these three titles are notable not just for the ingenuity of their plotting, but for the way they shaped the mystery genre itself. These days, the idea of a conspiracy or an unreliable narrator are commonplace, so much so that readers forget that such tropes had to start somewhere - and that Christie was responsible for creating (or at least popularizing) most of them.<br /><br />In the case of \\"And Then There Were None,\\" the story follows a familiar premise. A group of strangers are lured through deceptive means to an isolated location. There seems to be no obvious connection between any of them. Yet as time goes by, murders begin. One by one they fall victim to an unknown killer...<br /><br />It's a plot that every mystery-lover knows; one that originated in its most recognizable form with Christie herself. Previously titled \\"Ten Little Indians\\" (and before that, something even more offensive), the book was first published in 1939 to rave reviews. It has since become her #1 best-selling mystery, and the one that has undergone the most stage, film, television and radio adaptations. There's even a video game!<br /><br />In this case the isolated location is an island, and the ten guests have all been brought there by various invitations and job offers from a man who signs himself U.N. Owen. The guests are surprised to find that the luxurious modern house is empty except for the help, a husband-and-wife team who are also clueless as to their host's whereabouts and identity. They settle down to wait, only to be shocked and appalled when a gramophone recording informs them why they've all been gathered there: each one of them is guilty of murder, but until now, has managed to evade the law. Now, the time has come for justice.<br /><br />The guests respond with everything from vigorous denial to self-righteous indignation. Among them is a governess accused of deliberately drowning her charge, a doctor who botched an operation, a judge who wrongly sent a man to the gallows, a religious fanatic who cast out a pregnant servant, a hit-and-run driver, and a retired colonel who sent his wife's lover to his death, among others. As their ordeal begins, they soon reach an undeniable conclusion: that with the rest of the island deserted, the killer must already be among them.<br /><br />Counting down the murder victims with the \\"Ten Little Soldiers\\" rhyme that is hung prominently on each bedroom wall, the remaining guests desperately try to outwit the killer. As time passes, the psychological strain and inevitable degeneration into suspicion, fear and ruthlessness marks each character's actions as they fight for survival. Guilt weighs heavily on many of them, and issues of class and gender come into play as each guest attempts to pinpoint the identity of the killer.<br /><br />As the cast is gradually whittled down, the palatable sense of dread grows into a genuinely terrifying atmosphere that quite simply *prevents* the reader from putting the book down until the final pages have been read. With its short chapters that are in turn split into smaller divisions, combined with its relentless pacing and Christie's ability to not waste a single word, I guarantee that you'll be amazed by how quickly you devour this book. Without distractions, you may even manage it in one sitting.<br /><br />Its dark subject matter may throw many readers off guard, for this is about as far away as you can get from Christie's usual \\"cozies\\" that star the fastidious Poirot or fluffy Miss Marple. More of a suspense thriller than a mystery story, the novel is notable for not featuring one of Christie's usual detectives (or even a sympathetic protagonist). At the time of its publication, there had never been anything like it written before, and even now its devastatingly simple premise is riveting.<br /><br />Of course, if you look closely, it is possible to pick several holes in the murderer's plans. The levels of coincidence and contrivance in getting everyone to the island and keeping them there are high, as is the complete infallibility with which the murderer oversees and controls the victims in his plans. At times, it feels as though Fate itself is at work. However, the plot is so well-constructed and the suspense so brilliantly raised over the course of the sixteen chapters that it seems mean-spirited (and self-defeating) to quibble over details.<br /><br />As mentioned, the book's title (and accompanying text) has undergone several changes since its first publication. I believe that some issues still use the terms Indian Island and the Ten Little Indians nursery rhyme, but my copy had been changed to Soldier Island and Ten Little Soldiers. I suspect collectors will enjoy the challenge of getting their hands on the older versions of the text, but casual readers can rest assured that the changes in terminology don't affect the story in any way (kept intact are several characters' racist remarks and attitudes, all of which *do* impinge on the plot).<br /><br />I vividly recall the first time I read \\"And Then There Were None\\" and how shaken it left me. If you're reading it for the first time, do whatever you can to avoid being spoiled, and try to savor every chapter. You'll only get to read it for the first time *once*, and though a subsequent read is just as rewarding in appreciating Christie's misdirection and marvelous plotting, it will inevitably be a less terrifying experience the second time around. Whether you are a long-time Christie fan, or have never read a single one of her books in your life, \\"And Then There Were None\\" is an absolute must-read.

B005BCE7II|5.0|Dawn of the Dinosaurs 3D is a pretty good 3D movie. Have ordered about 1/2 of the ones available and waiting for more to come out this year on blu ray. This 3D is one that requires glasses and a 3D blu ray player and a 3D HDTV. These are not the leap off the screen 3D movies but instead look like a hologram movie instead, adding the depth. Pretty sure the kids will enjoy this one, even if they're over 21.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great way to get the word daily..... I love the fact that multiple versions are available and that the audio is so clear.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|Enjoyed it in 2D and now in 3D.  Animation has enough images to make 3D captivating and with all the birds in this one flying everywhere, is a very good 3D movie. A great family movie so no one has to go somewhere else.

B005I6EVUG|5.0|I purchased the Verso Artist Series Case Cover for Kindle Fire, Cities, Red.  However, Amazon shipped the Verso Artist Series Case Cover for Kindle, Cities, Red.  Though this case fit the newer Kindle models, it does not fit the Kindle Fire.  There is a case specific for the Kindle Fire. There is a small red sticker on the cardboard insert that says \\"Made for Kindle Fire\\".  Other Kindles as well as other e-readers can use this case, it might just be a little roomy for them.  If it doesn't have the sticker or specifically say \\"for Kindle Fire\\", it does not fit the Kindle Fire properly.  The case for the Kindle Fire is longer (top to bottom).  The Kindle Fire sits inside the case with a little room (1/4\\"?) around top/bottom and right side.  I have found that this extra space gives your finger(s) a place to rest while reading your Kindle Fire comfortably.  The straps are tight, but not streteched.  I was disappointed that Amazon was advertising this cover for the Kindle Fire, but shipping a different product.  I believe that is why there is so much negative feedback about this product on Amazon.  I have stopped by Best Buy every week since Christmas and it was finally in stock this week.  And, on another note, the case for the Kindle Fire is $39.99, the other case that fits the newer Kindle models is $29.99.  So, if you are paying $29.99, you are most likely not getting the Kindle Fire case.  Enjoy Reading!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|i really love this app. the cloud makes my engineering life easier! the ui is more and more beautiful than it was
0439023521|4.0|Yes I believe so. I really do think this is an excellent story and well written. Just not too well written... that is why I gave only four stars and not 5. It is an amazing story and plot line, you get to the end of every page, chapter, and section and can't wait to continue. I read the entire book in two nights, I just could not stop reading.<br /><br />However, I feel Suzanne Collins needs some help with her writing ability and needs to show hegemony of some vocab. She also falls victim to her fear of skipping over the gruesome parts too quickly almost leaving you feeling rushed

B006OAB3ME|5.0|I love this album, one reviewer described it as \\"A minor gem from an A major artist',describing beautifully its quality, like comparing WhenI'm 64 to Hey Jude, this album has lasting quality. My Valentine is just about the best love song McCartney has written in 15 years,now how great is that, considering  the ex-beatle is the greatest melodist of the last half century. If you want to get close and personal with the \\"cute Beatle\\", this album is like a warm private conversation with your best friend. My other favorites on the album are:More I cannot wish you,Bye bye blackbird and My very good friend the milkman, but you will have an easy time to picking your favorite, there is alot to choose from.--Robert
1400049628|3.0|The concept here is amusing.  I really like the idea of a deadly serious zombie survival guide.  The author plays it straight throughout offering sage advice on how best to arm yourself to battle the undead, where to go and how to get there when it's time to move, and how to survive in a world that is overrun with the living dead.  There is no winking at the reader here.  The Survival Guide is unflinchingly serious.  The humor comes from the thoroughness of the parody.<br /><br />The downside to this is that for a lot people, the joke wears thin after a while.  It's consistently amusing but there are no big laughs.  I think much of the fun of the book is in taking the information learned and discussing the zombie apocalypse in the coffee room at the office.  This usually works best if there are one or two others who are similarly knowledgeable about surviving and a handful of others who have no idea what you are talking about.<br /><br />I read World War Z and listened to most of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies as an audiobook and my impression of this handbook is much the same as it was for those offerings.  The Zombie craze is good fun and these books are entertaining to a point.  I personally find, after 100 or so pages, I get the idea, I appreciate the cleverness of the concept - but then I'm ready to move on.<br /><br />But at least I'm informed.  I know what to do now when the zombie apocalypse comes.  I'm not sure I have what it takes to survive, but I know I'll last longer than you if you haven't read this book.
0553807919|4.0|This book presents an approach to parenting that is based upon understanding of the brain hemispheres and how they relate to our mental and emotional processes. The strategies and exercises shared in the book are designed to help integrate the left and right brain faculties across the span of childhood and adolescent development. The authors have a website wholebrainchild dot com where they offer some resources, and they have designed this book so that parents can develop understanding of the brain and mental functioning and teach some of the basics to their children to empower their kids to build self-awareness and self-regulation skills.<br />This book helps us see how feelings can dominate our behavior and the need for parents to validate feelings as a step before attempting to communicate with a child's rational processing. The book provides many examples as well as some illustrations and cartoons depicting the concepts and strategies that are discussed. It would have been nice if these illustrations and cartoons were in color, while it is great that these are even included in black and white [this refers to the review copy, not the final published version].<br />The end of the book has a summary appendix chart listing types of left-right brain integration along with associated whole-brain strategies and applications. This makes a nice quick reference to look back to after you have read the book.<br />I would recommend this book for parents and child-care professionals. This book is not a quick-fix parenting technique - it is designed to help you reassess how we relate to our children (and to others in general) - and steadily implement this more enlightened whole-brain approach. It means practicing these strategies and using them more and more so that they replace the dysfunctional reactions and habits that people often exhibit when interacting with children. This takes commitment and ongoing personal development and self-awareness. The authors, I believe, could have further stressed the need for ongoing commitment and the ability to face setbacks and challenges that arise even when you are doing a good job applying these strategies. Overall, I found this book to be practical and informative... not really revolutionary but certainly a very good resource that will help parents and others improve their family relationships and interactions with children.r stressed the need for ongoing commitment and the ability to face setbacks and challenges that arise even when you are doing a good job applying these strategies.

B006WQLH7G|1.0|I tried this app on my new Kindle Fire. While I have had very good experiences with Avast free version of their desktop software, I considered this my 1st choice despite some questionable reviews.  The software loaded easily, the interface was very intuitive, it would simply not update the signatures.  I rebooted my Kindle Fire, un-installed and re-installed the app, all to no avail.  The app would simply not update the signatures on my Kindle Fire.  While I would probably give this app a better review for its ease of use and intuitive interface, I cannot give it a good review because without up-to-date signatures this product is basically worthless.
B000R8YC1I|4.0|When I saw the movie in the theater, around age 12, it was the best movie I had ever seen.  I got the book, and I had dreams about being a Gelfling for months.  I don't buy many DVDs, but based on the memory of it, I had to get it.  When I saw it again, it was still good, but not -- I don't know -- magic.  Probably more a fault of my age than of the movie.  Regardless, the artistry of Jim Henson, Frank Oz, and the other visual artists and muppeteers is still admirable and worth watching and appreciating.  Their real-construction effects created a believable imaginary world long before computer-generated imagery made that sort of thing commonplace.

0385341008|4.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is an epistolary novel set in post-World War II England.  It centers on Juliet Ashton, a writer who is on her first book tour as the novel opens.  We learn that she is best known for her humorous war-time newspaper column which was recently compiled into a successful book.  We quickly observe from her correspondence that she has a sharp wit, a love of books... and a desire to take her writing in an entirely new post-war direction.<br /><br />Soon, however, Juliet receives a letter from a stranger in Guernsey who chanced to find her address in a used book.  And so begins a correspondence not only with this man, but gradually with more and more Guernsey Islanders, particularly the members of their oddly-named book club.  As the circle of correspondence widens, vivid details of life on a German-occupied channel island are revealed... and Juliet finds herself with one more war story that she longs to tell.<br /><br />Epistolary novels, novels told entirely through letters, are often disjointed and difficult to read. But the authors of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society have created something marvelous... an epistolary page-turner.  After the initial awkwardness of reading letters from a fictional stranger to and about other fictional strangers, readers will find themselves seamlessly slip from awkwardness to fascinated enthusiasm for the characters and the stories that they tell.<br /><br />Through letters, a sweeping and poignant tale unfolds of war, fear, loss, love, and hope.  This book's pages are filled with fascinating characters, classic British wit and touching tales, all told with an optimism that is rare in literary fiction set in any post-war era.  A bygone time comes vividly to life in this highly readable and thoroughly enjoyable novel.  And through it all, one singularly clear theme develops... the power of books to sustain their readers in good times and in bad.<br /><br />This discussion originally appeared on my blog.  See my profile for details.ofile for details.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have a kindle and was sifting through titles when \\"Wool\\" just leapt off the screen. What an intriguing choice of a title, and it certainly piqued my curiosity. I'm so glad I did. I love reading science fiction books about the underground world, be it caves or subways... and now I can add silos! It's funny, when I was young my favorite thing to draw was a cross section of a house inside a hill, complete with many levels and rooms. This series really spoke to that part of me! Anyway, there are many reviews to be read about the content of this series, so all I want to say (besides you should read this series!) is that I loaned \\"Wool\\" to my teenage son who is an aspiring science fiction writer. I told him that \\"Wool\\" is written by a fledgling writer whose books are solely distributed by Kindle, and it seems to be working really well! So nice to know that individuals authors can get their literature to their audience without any middle man markups and publisher headaches! A great inspiration for my son!
1582701709|5.0|It is a wonderful book, very inspirational and I am strong believer that it will change my life for the best. It upsets me that some people do not feel the same, it just hasn't opened to them yet. In my local library most of The Secret books are checked out, I had to put hold request for it! This is the book that needs to be not only in your personal library but in constant use for inspiration and meditation. It took me a while to read it, it needs to be absorbed with every cell of your body. I am sure it will be my reference book for life!  If you search it will be given to you.  Law of Attraction works!  Just today I requested parking spots and they were given to me at exactly same spots I have requested. Thank you Rhonda Byrne!  Love and Gratitude to all!
B006UG909U|5.0|I don't understand some of these 1 star reviews. This album is so good, first to last. David Lee Roth can still sing like 1984 and the lyrics are fantastic. This is rock and roll they way it should be done, which is no surprise since these guys wrote the book on this. Hard rockin', sweet guitar, catchy tunes and loads of fun. It's like they picked up where they left off in 1984, and then some. Play it a few times, you'll feel like a kid again. David brings SO much personality to the band, and isn't what why we all loved them in the first place? (blah blah Michael Anthony blah blah Wolfgang blah blah--none of that matters). Welcome back!

Yes, it's heavy on the science but necessary to make the point. The book leaves you with some basic recipes at the end to get you going but if you truly understand what you have just read, you will be fully motivated to find new and healthy ways to eat without WHEAT. This book serves to put you ON the path to health yet lets you decide your OWN path. Dr. Davis does a very convincing job of explaining, from a scientific standpoint, why wheat is BAD.  This isn't a step by step or a diet plan guide book (that's already all over the internet). Its science, evidence and information that you can absolutely use to make new and informed decisions regarding food. Put that cracker down, pick up the book and get reading my friends.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|The unit provided an uncomplicated transition from the only available audio output (optical) on a new TV to an analog RCA signal required for a Sennheiser wireless earphone transmitter.
B0045EJY90|5.0|This unit was purchased to replace a first generation cd player that finally died. It functioned perfectly right out of the box. Setup was very simple. The included remote control added a lot of convenience. Being able to play the Ipod, using the Apple USB cable is a neat function. Lastly, the sound quality of a CD is excellent. All in all, am very satisfied with the machine.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|Van Halen's self titled debut is an extraordinary record that changed the tide of rock.  The dark days of metal and rock were transformed by a record from a band from Pasadena CA.  Eddie Van Halen's explosive guitar, a solid rythm section and David Lee Roth's unconventional approach to rock made this album the talk of the rock world...globally.  Not only was the music new and exciting but the live show as well.  Many a rocker made the mistake of having VH open for them.  Ted Nugent included.  Prior to this debut bands were sneering and albums covers were adorned with fire and dark images all part of the testosterone image of the music that only men dared to listen to.  Well Van Halen saved that for the music and smiled and laughed throughout their live performances.  The ultimate party band.
B0031Y9DCS|5.0|this book is amazing because of the detail mason puts in this book. when i read the first chapter it amazed me he explained how a helo works so well i think i can fly a huey with in a few trys.
0439023521|4.0|This is a great book.  I found the plot and pacing to be exciting and well done, and I can honestly say I enjoyed every second of it.  However, from this book alone, I felt there could be more world development.  A lot of questions about the world went unanswered (though many of them are answered in the next book, Catching Fire).  I would recommend it, just make sure to read the whole series for the full background story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game encourages you to play more. with lots of points given with every play its easy and fun to earn new games. lots of adds not so crazy about but worth it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|awesome app....lets u download and read any version of the Bible and lets makes it much easier to access the Bible ANY time!!!!!
0060873027|1.0|Boring, superficial, far from real Michael Crichton's techno-thrillers. Neither thriller nor techno. Maybe kids can enjoy. It is just a product for making money.
B001608QVS|5.0|These movies are old but still great. Wish I didn't wait so long to watch them all. Collector set is nice.
0439023521|5.0|I bought this book as a christmas present for my sister-in-law.  She couldn't put it down.  She said it was one of those books, that once you got interested and figured out what was going on, you had to read it all.  She finished it in 3 days and went out and bought the next 2 books as well.  She did say the previews for the movie leave lots out.
1597801585|4.0|The reason I picked up this book was because of all the accolades it received.  I haven't read a science fiction book in a while and wanted to dip my toes back into the genre.  I thoroughly enjoyed the story and found the world to be fascinating that Bacigalupi has created in this story.  The mixture of science and story was very well blended.  You get immersed in this world and it brings you in more and more as the story goes.  I read the last third of the book in one long sitting on the couch.  I just couldn't put it down.<br /><br />So why not the full five star rating?  The beginning of this book is very difficult to read.  In fact I tried reading the first chapter three or four times where I would put it down, come back weeks later and try again.  Finally I decided to just plow through and see if I could get past it.  Once I made it to chapter 3, everything was great.  So my advice is to endure the first chapter.  It does get much better.<br /><br />Pros:<br />o excellent story<br />o great blending of the sci-fi with a traditional human conflict storyline<br />o believable characters with an excellent finish<br /><br />Cons:<br />o beginning is tough to read - too much unexplained jargon and terms that don't make sense until later in the story<br /><br />Overall - I recommend this book.  Interesting, action-packed, intriguing plot-lines.  Well worth the time.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|Having been in sales & marketing for the past 25 years, I have to say ... this is absolutely one of the best marketing books I have ever read! Great book for self publishers, but you can apply these principles to ANY product you are selling on the internet. AWESOME! I re-worked my entire marketing plan based on this book.
B006UG90RM|4.0|I wanted to hate it because it really pisses me off that an artist as talented as EVH would have to rely on old demos to create this album, rather than writing new material, and also because Michael Anthony's high harmonies are sorely missed here. But go figure, after about 6 straight listens, I'm totally addicted...it's a pretty freakin great album.  Heavy and up-tempo, just like I want my VH to be.  I'd give it 5 stars if it weren't for my suspicion that it's really Eddie playing bass on all/most of the tracks...the bass is just too good to be Wolfie.  But if I'm wrong, then DAMN, props to Wolfie!
B005K0S2SW|5.0|I am a new fan of Trombone Shorty.  This album is incredible.  Infections beats and really catchy grooves.  Having the guest musicians really puts unique sounds and character to each song, spanning through several genres of music.
B0061QD82E|5.0|Since everybody on the planet probably knows the story of Lady and the Tramp all too well, my review is about the merits of this new Blu-ray rather than concentrating on the story. Disney has never failed to amaze me with the Blu-ray restorations of their animated classics. I've owned every Disney animated incarnation from VHS to DVD to Blu-ray, and the upgrades to Blu-ray have been totally worth every penny. With Lady and the Tramp, a 1955 film shot in CinemaScope, you get a pristine picture that looks as though it was made in 2012. I could not believe the beautiful colors and details that I was seeing. For example, you can see patterns in the carpets  that are so detailed that they will astound you. The sound is also very clean. Everything was produced with such care and love (colors, minute details, correct aspect ratio & audio) that I simply can't wait until future Disney Blu-ray releases become available. I think Cinderella may be coming out soon, as it was one of the previews. Even if you own the DVD version of Lady and the Tramp, treat yourself to this Blu-ray experience. You won't regret it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Solid free app. they reaaly push for you to buy tokens. hard to unlock games and awards. average type game
B005JABSB6|5.0|I purchased these glasses to go with my Sharp Quattron 3D tv.  hey are great!  They are rechargable, pretty light weight.  They have both 2D and 3D modes, and even an automatic dimmer which helps to remove the glare when you are watching tv.  I have enjoyed these so much that I bought two more.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its an awesome game. tried it on kindle fire works great. has so many different games on right for each game. its awesome and free!  BEST GAME EVER!!!
B000002UB2|5.0|I am the biggest fan of purist audio. I welcome the label Audiophile.<br /><br />And I have been a fan of the Beatles for, I suppose, all my life. To hear them in the vinyl format is such an outstanding and new experience, as opposed to the crappy cd's I've heard for so many years. Of course, in my childhood, it was cassette tapes; which were just about as lossy in breadth of scope of the music.<br /><br />Doesn't everyone just love the 2009 remasters...? Well, I haven't enjoyed cd quality for nearly a decade. The format is a dinosaur, and is not to my taste of standards for music reproduction. I am a big fan of the DVD-A format, and have really been cheering for the Blu Ray music fashion to come to fruition.<br />But now hearing something you're so in love with on vinyl as compared to the limited versions you've lived with so long, it absolutely confounds me as to how CD's ever overtook Vinyl. The spaciousness of the sound and depth of the its dynamic range is so beautiful!<br /><br />Sure, no one likes clicks and pops; and I'm sure relief of that, as well as the maintenance of vinyl back in like '85 was seemingly a godsend...  but the quality is severely lacking.<br /><br />After this purchase, I will never go back to listening to The Beatles on cd. I absolutely love hearing the Abbey Road Melody easing through each of the \\"individual\\" tracks on this record, with its oopmh!<br />And at like $15 or however much for a new sealed version of this (yes...) reissue on vinyl, you cannot cannot cannot beat the price. Sure, you may need to have a quality turntable and needle, but for similar audiophiles out there, I'm assuming you didn't think you'd get a great sound system for like $60...  All in for my Audio Technica ATLP120 turntable, Shure M97xE stereo needle, and Spin-Clean Record Washer MKII record washer, I think I paid like $300. But I have not regretted it since its set up in my home theater.
B006UG90RM|5.0|I've been a Van Halen fan for as long as I can remember: As a 10 year old, my favorite song was \\"Little Guitars,\\" and I've never looked back. In junior high, I was devastated when I learned of David Lee Roth's departure, but begrudgingly gave Sammy Hagar a chance. Whether it was due to the changing sound of rock in the 80s, or just my own ability to adapt, Hagar grew on me, and Van Halen continued to be my favorite band. That said, I always knew that this \\"new\\" Van Halen was a very different band: Not worse, not better--just different than the band I fell in love with.  28 years later, that band is back with a vengeance. \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" solidly rocks from top to bottom -- the sound falling squarely in the \\"Van Halen 2\\" / \\"Women and Children First\\" era. Roth's voice may not have the acrobatic skills of the past, and Michael Anthony is surely missed, but this is classic Van Halen to be sure. Ironically, the weakest track on the album is the first released single (a tactic used in the past by many a band). The rest of the album blazes at a breakneck pace, with the band barely taking enough time to catch their collective breath.  Side note: Much has been made of the band using older, unreleased demos as the basis for *some* of these tracks. News flash: This is a practice employed by every band since the dawn of time. Most prolific musicians have libraries upon libraries of tracks they've stored away for safekeeping, and Eddie Van Halen is no different. In fact, many songs from the Hagar era were written before Sammy even joined the band (\\"Right Now,\\" \\"Mine all Mine,\\" etc.). If anything, the use of older demos has bridged the gap seamlessly to this new, yet classic sound.  Fans of Van Halen will not be disappointed. Fans of real rock and roll in general should thank Van Halen for saving them from the otherwise dreary, vanilla 2012 rock landscape populated by the likes of Nickelback. It might not be the perfect album, but as a comeback for the *true* mighty Van Halen, it works just fine.  I haven't been this excited for a new album release in years. Thanks, Van Halen, for making me feel like that kid in junior high running to my record store--if only for 50 minutes.
1400052181|5.0|A MUST read!!! This book is so incredible, and an eye opener for everyone (even outside the medical field).  This is one of the best books of the year.
B006OAB3ME|3.0|With the Beatles, Paul helped create an amazing new feel for music. You can see it on the remastered Ed Sullivan shows and damn, they are almost more exciting than when they originally aired. Since then he's been a relentless innovator. He's got so many ideas and tries so much new stuff that half of it is junk that should have been edited out (where's Lennon when you need him?). And darned if some of his classical things aren't pretty great as well (specifically Ecce Cor Meum).  So why does this exciting whirlwind of creativity do this album now? I'm eight years younger than Paul and I grew up with that old music too. It played on the same stations as the Beatles and Stones and the British Invasion; we listened to all of it. I understand he loved it too and wants to do a nostalgic tribute.  That being said, when Paul does a nostalgic album like this, he first becomes part of all the geezser rockers who  have tried this concept already. Does he bring any thing to it that Carly Simon, Harry Nilsson or Rod Stewart (et al) hasn't already? I love Paul, but his voice now is not attractive. With My Valentine that's not a problem; but with Paper Moon and others it is. Rockers doing Sinatra still sucks as an idea and Paul doesn't change that.  If you forget that he's a rock legend, then he joins an even bigger group of dozens or maybe hundreds of pop singers who worked in the business and sang Tin Pan Alley tunes for decades. Does he compare with any of them or the style of singing that belongs to that whole genre? Maybe, but mostly because he's Paul.  So, the music is good and mellow. Paul is a bit rough and out of place. But it's Paul, damn it. He's been listenable for so long you can hardly stay away.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love the game every time I get bored I turn to 101 games and love it. great past time.
B005R32L66|2.0|Huge disappointment with the galaxy tab 10.1. One of the main reasons I have this service and this tablet is to Video call with my relatives overseas, but alas, there is no fix for this Mic issue for the tab, although it's been complained about since Oct. I wish I would have read the reviews first...
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This book is amazing. It has great information about how your body will respond to diet and exercise; and what you will need to do to achieve your goals. Whatever your goals are, whether it is getting big or lean,  this book is all you need. It's been a week since I started following this book and I am already seeing results. This book is definitely worth your money and the time that you will spend reading it. Highly recommend reading this book !!!!
B006UG90RM|5.0|Sounds like classic Van Halen.  Great album!!  Roth is killing it, Alex is great, Wolfgang damn good and Eddie of course proving he's still one of the best of all time.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|I really had no interest in this movie, but it was streaming and I was bored so I gave it a shot.  The story was strong enough, with plenty of twists and lots of tension to hold my interest.  All the characters are a little more than they first appear, giving them more depth than the usual Hollywood fare.<br /><br />Fine acting, good story, and a nice twist at the end made this an enjoyable movie.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I had read The Help when it first came out. Having come of age during the Civil Rights era it brought back many memories, good and bad.  I was eager to see the movie and can say that it follows the book quite well and have recommended both to friends and co-workers.
0439023513|4.0|I havn't read MockingJay yet, but im ready for it. I absolutly adored the first book, it was filled with so much beughtiful detail, and suspense. My friend suggested it after reading it herself and i could tel she fell in love with it. later, i fell inlove with it as well. it was a great experiance reading both of the first two books, and i cant wait to get MockingJay in the mail in a few days. I felt like Catching Fire was not explained enough. it almost seems like she had a deadline and had to hurry to finish in some parts of the book.    Thankyou so much!!! and i hope everyone enjoys this amazing book! I CANT WAIT TO READ IT!!!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app it's sooooo awesome, and it works great on the kindle fire which is what I have...so all I have to say is...GET THIS APP!!!
B002ZG99NG|4.0|Ben Affleck once again surprises as his career seems to be heading into Clint Eastwood territory.  That is, act in a few good movies, including your own, but directing may be his real forte.  This crime-action-drama is complete with some excellent acting especially Jeremy Renner of \\"Hurt Locker\\" fame.  A big surprise for me was Blake Lively as well.  Although I know who she is, I've never seen her act and she's very good here.  This film has what you would want in a complete movie; an interesting premise and story (if nothing new) along with conflict, drama and a little sex.  Even the car chases and shoot-outs are pretty well done, if unrealistic.  The Blu ray transfer is well done complete with  DTS-HD Master Audio.
B000BCE7QU|5.0|Before going too far, let me say this about Prefab Sprout's STEVE McQUEEN:  This is a desert island CD, period.  I might not be able to quickly identify the other four on my list, but this one is definitely there.  The edition I sought, the &#34;Legacy Edition&#34;, only solidifies my position.  If you can imagine Steely Dan with Brian Wilson & Morrissey as members, then you have an approximation of the SPROUT sound.  The lyrics are another story.  Think of Costello & McCartney as collaborators.  This Legacy Edition includes a second disc with 8 of the songs re-done, &#34;unplugged&#34;-style by SPROUT lead singer/guitarist Paddy McAloon that, in some instances, outstrip the original album versions.  Emotionally engaging and relentlessly intelligent, STEVE McQUEEN is about as close to perfect as pop music gets.  Smartly remastered, STEVE McQUEEN (released in 1985 as TWO WHEELS GOOD in the U.S. for legal reasons) has a bevy of songs (&#34;Bonny&#34;, &#34;Appetite&#34;, &#34;When Love Breaks Down&#34;) that will settle in your cranium for a long time to come.  If your thing is smart pop that doubles as first-rate ear candy, then Prefab Sprout's STEVE McQUEEN is the disc for you.
B0058VW36U|5.0|awesome. fun game were you feed the monster candy with so many levels to play. make sure to get the stars for extra points

B006E4QCXU|5.0|So personally I've never written a review before, but I thought this app deserved it. First off, I got this app as the free app of the day and after reading the description I thought it would be one of those apps just taking IP room on my phone. as a college student I get stressed a lot and I find either when I'm stressed or just looking for an app to just sit down and not really think with, this app is it. I understand that it doesn't have any strategy or challenge which may annoy many people (I'm a puzzle/brain-teaser sort of girl myself) but really for relaxing, there's nothing better. and for everyone who says they've &quot;learned all its potential in just 2 minutes&quot; I doubt it; you may have learned all of the CONTROLS, but I guarantee you haven't done it all. I didn't learn my favorite trick for about a week: swirl your fingers around all of the dots until they form a close circle, when the circle gets really small, tap the center of it. Its truly beautiful and never the same twice. Also, just a note for the Scott Snibbe Studio, I have never actually paid for a live wallpaper before, and neither has my mom, but if you make one out of this we'd both be willing to spend up to $3 on it. Just so you know :)
1400052181|5.0|This book is the culmination of a 10-year labor of research and discovery, courage and truth-seeking, persistence and perseverance,  love and trust. Rebecca Skloot and Deborah Lacks (Henrietta's daughter) embarked upon a courageous journey to uncover the story of Henrietta Lacks and her tumor cells, called HeLa by those who cultured them. It is a haunting story of the evils of racism, unethical medical practices, and the multiple traumas suffered by the Lacks family. It raises provocative questions that are yet to be answered regarding the ethics of biomedical research and the ownership of human tissues.  My emotions were all over the place while reading this book. Descriptions of inhumane research practices turned my stomach, such as the tests performed on Elsie and other patients in the \\"Crownsville Hospital for the Negro Insane\\" and the experimentation with syphilis on black men and prisoners at Tuskegee. I cringed at the lab practices of the 1950's (e.g., doctors and technicians carried tubes of radium in their pockets and lab techs ate lunch at the same tables where they handled biohazardous materials). I was horrified that the Lacks family could not afford to see a doctor for serious illnesses while biotech companies made millions from Henrietta's cells. My heart soared when Skloot finished the book after so many years. My eyes blurred with tears when Deborah died.  Skloot masterfully interwove a family's true story with interviews from the medical staff at Johns Hopkins, Tuskegee Institute, the NIH and other institutions. She took great care to tell both sides of the story.  But most of all, the affection and respect Skloot and the Lacks had for each other shines through these pages. Thank you, Rebecca Skloot, for telling this compassionate, informative, and transforming story of Henrietta Lacks, the woman behind HeLa.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Like many of you, I too was worried after hearing the uninspired 'Tattoo' which is comparable to the equally uninspired and most mediocre rock track of all-time 'The Cradle will Rock'.  Fortunately, the rest of the album is the heaviest album in the Van Halen catalog.  Eddie is playing like he is 25 again, Roth's vocals sound almost too good to be true.  The band hasn't sounded this good since 51/50 (yeah, most people will knock the van hagar era but that album had a musical complexity to it that no other Van Halen album could touch.....until now).  There are several awesome tracks on this album: She's the woman, Chinatown, As Is, The Trouble with Never, Outta Space, etc. Eddie plays one of the greatest solos of his life in 'Chinatown' I've never heard Eddie take a more aggressive approach in a solo.  This album is a breath of fresh air.  I thought the absence of Michael Anthony's trademark backing vocals would be missed....eh, not really, the harmonies here are fine. I hardly noticed.  This album does make me a bit sad though, they could have been putting out stuff like this with Roth this whole time instead of petty in-fighting and long silences with each other. Well, at least we got this album.  And this album rates among my favorite VH albums (only the debut album and 5150 top this one).  Also, thanks to the surgeon for fixing Eddie's damaged hand. He is flying up and down that fret board...rock 'n roll!!!
B0073PZIYI|3.0|I love sci-fi movies, even B rate ones.  This is Bonnie and Clyde meats Robin Hood meets Equilibrium (not sure why it reminds me of that one). This was a B+ movie.  The idea was pretty cool, I like the timekeeper, and I thought they did a good job making the main heroin's dad seem older, even though he's '25.'  The love story was somewhat on the back-burner which was a plus, but when the heroin leaves her rich/safe life with the hero I wasn't ready to believe it yet.  Overall worth watching.....
B003ZSJ212|5.0|For the price this is a great deal.  You get all six episodes on blu-ray.  Quality is great.  If you love Star Wars this is a must have for your collection.  Although now the 3-D version is coming out in theaters and I'm sure they will re-release on 3-D DVD for purchase in the next couple of years....Totally getting our young kids into Star Wars with this set.
B004ZQBP3Q|1.0|...than listen to this crap (and I hate Kia's)!  Hey, if you've heard \\"Party Rock Anthem\\" on the Kia ad, just buy the single and don't waste your money on this awful assemblage of filler from a one-hit wonder.  Life is way too short to bother listening to LMFAO - which is what they're probably doing (Laughing Their A$$e$ Off) to the fools who spend money on this!
1572816112|4.0|I saw this deck, and was intrigued by the unique and innovative take on the traditional tarot I've bought and used all my life so far. I saw it was on sale, and I've started a small collection of tarot cards, so I thought the Deviant Moon deck would make a fun addition.  Then, I received the deck and held them, and I was surprised, both by the imagery and the accompanied meanings included in the small book. And I was struck by how these cards spoke to me. I wasn't expecting that. I found these cards to be a nice change from the flowery, overly pleasant decks I've seen coming out lately. I've grown tired of decks that are always up beat and pleasing in their meanings as if you can't say hint at anything the least bit negative. Even reversed meanings or afflicted cards are given positive, motivational interpretations. Not so with Deviant Moon Tarot. And I'm not saying the cards of Deviant Moon are portrayed as dark and brooding, as I had expected, though there is plenty of that as well. I can honestly say I've never seen or used a deck like this one. It won't just be a show piece to sit on a self and only come out on special occasions. I have used this deck and will do so in the future. I don't think it will be my main deck, but it will get used.  The cards themselves are a good size, not too big for my small hands but not so small that the detailing in the images are lost. They are good quality, thick but pliant, not hard to shuffle, and I feel no worry when bending to do so. Over all, I am very pleased.
B0063IH60K|5.0|classic solitaire game is fun and easy to play! can't put the game down! very addictive! lots of fun when bored!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun for the neice and family... cant keep in husband off of it great way to pass time away and very easy to play
B0063GORYU|5.0|Good game. The only thing I can come up with that it could use is more variety for background or deck backside pic options.
B006UG90RM|3.0|The album is OK, nothing more. Each song sounds like something I've already heard from VH. Is there truth to the rumor that most of these tracks were reworked with some going back as far as 35 years ago? If so, shows little originality. The one positive of this album is VH ensured that it was available at all retail outlets. No exclusivity deals with the big box stores like Walmart and Best Buy...  If or when this lineup of VH puts out an album of original material, I'll give it a listen. Until then, 1 listen of ADKOT is enough for me..
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is amazing and a lot of fun there are so many kids tht like this game and its a good interact with ur brain
0385512058|1.0|I had a hard time reading this book with all the \\"I'm so great and I know everyone, stories\\". I realize its hard to pen a book but this was kind of a waste of my time.<br /><br />I wish I could recommend something better but I can not right now. Just skip it and read something else.
0439023513|3.0|I was seriously disappointed after reading.  I went through all 3 books in less than a week and I have to say that Mockingjay was my lease favorite.  Unlike, Catching Fire, this book seemed like it was dragging.  It wasn't until the last 4 chapters that I really felt intrigued.  The ending is very realistic - but that's just it...  it's too realistic!  I was hoping for a sappy, dreamy, ending where everyone is happy and safe.  Why, oh, why, did Prim die?  The premise of the book (I thought) was to save Prim but she's dead.  I do get why she picked Peeta though.  I understand that Gale and her was growing apart.  It was very apparent in the book.  However, I wished Suzanne Collins told us more about Gale.  It's as if he just simply disappeared from view!  All in all, the Trilogy in itself is awesome.  But this last book left a lot of questions unanswered - at least for me.
1594744769|4.0|I thought the book was fantastic! A light read and very enjoyable, it makes it hard to put the book down! The only reason I rated it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I wasn't happy about the ending! Although I do look forward to reading the next book! I will definitely be recommending this book.
0439023491|5.0|Really... There were lots of emotional parts throughout this book and I could not put it down.  What's funny is, after reading the book, I happened to hear Train's song \\"Marry Me\\" and I could help but think about Peeta and Katniss. I almost cried...
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I have watched Phantom live 2x, and although Ramin is not my favorite phantom (John Owen Jones is) it was still wonderfully entertaining.  Sierra does a wonderful job as Christine and is now my favorite Christine.  Raoul was wonderful too, and Carlotta was extremely sympathetic (for once).<br /><br />What a wonderful, wonderful performance and a rare treat for Phantom phans and for those that can not attend live productions all the time.  Is it the same as the musical production, no... a different hall (Prince Alberts) to hold the massive crowds, so the special stage that is built for Phantom (West End and Broadway) can not be used... no trap door, no massive stage structures during the scenes, but they did a wonderful job.  And only makes you want to go and see it live even more.  The close ups on expressions and costumes are priceless, you would never be able to see that live :) and they are wonderful.<br /><br />The end was the best, I phantoms singing were wonderful, and Michael Crawford just looks so overwhelmed and happy for the congratulations.  Sarah Brightman- not so sure, shes always so remote- hard to tell.<br /><br />Thank you for allowing a POTO musical production to be filmed (instead of bootlegs all over YouTube), absolutely a priceless addition to my collection!  Money well spent!
1401223176|4.0|\\"Hush\\" is a 12-issue series originally published in 2002-2003 that careens from one supervillain encounter to another, laying the groundwork for the terrific Batman video games, \\"Arkham Asylum\\" (2009) and \\"Arkham City\\" (2011). It also features Catwoman as a romantic interest and Superman in a welcome cameo. In short, \\"Hush\\" manages the rare feat of bringing in a large cast and integrating with the wider D.C. universe without losing its focus on the dark knight himself.<br /><br />Unlike more recent storylines, \\"Hush\\" wastes little time on needless brooding and exposition. If you like your Batman fun and fast, \\"Hush\\" is a treat.
B001UHOWXI|4.0|This is a Wonderful Movie, one that I had not seen prior to purchasing this Blue-Ray.  The package comes with two discs, one in the original black and white, and the other a colorized version.  I bought this because my son and I were doing this story for the local theatre group, and we wanted to get to know the characters better.  I cannot believe I never wanted to watch this movie prior.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|High School of the Dead!!  If you are a fan of the Zombie genre, then you absolutely have to take a look, at the outstanding HSotD. The Anime, one of the most faithful Manga adaptations I've seen, will blow you away.  This series ruined the Walking Dead for me, because the characters have time to have emotional break downs, they take reasonable and prudent precautions, they run experiments on the zombies, they plan their actions in order to stay alive, and they learn from their mistakes.  Yes, there are gags in there for hormonal boys. Yes, there are large, jiggling breasts, and gratuitous panty flashing, but the characters and story are strong enough, that these things are just icing on the cake.  I have loaned this out to anime-hating, diehard zombie geeks, who downed the whole thing in one or two sittings, and were begging for more. One friend of mine watched the first two episodes in Japanese, because his player defaulted to that. Now Shane doesn't speak a word of Japanese, but he got so caught up in what was going on, that he didn't turn on the subs, or switch to English, he just called to tell me how cool it was!  Be very sure to stick with it through the end credits, and not zip off to the next episode. I made that mistake, discovered it 5 episodes in when I let an episode play and grabbed a drink, and had to go back and correct my oversight. After the credits there's a few minutes more story that helps lead into the next episode, and they don't re-cap it all. You snooze, you lose.  Geek that I am, I watched these in subtitled Japanese first, and then switched to English dubbing, and both are very well done.  My only complaints are the lack of more bonus material, and that the OVA, fan service special, was not included. (and that we don't have season 2 yet)
B004UID2LC|5.0|Wow got App yesterday and I have already downloaded over 100 songs.  Works perfectly with the Kindle Fire.  I will save hundreds of dollars with this one.
B0041KKYEW|5.0|Natalie Portman delivers a stunningly nuanced and sensual performance in this Aronofsky gem. One part melo-drama and two parts psychological high-wire act, Black Swan is a gorgeous thrill-ride helmed by one of the most talented actresses of her genration.
0307455874|5.0|As I read this book, I can't help myself to think that the people who give this book a bad review have simply not read it. Though everyone is entitled to their own opinion, sometimes in Amazon you will find fake reviewers that are just out to express their own political positions.  Who doesn't cheer for the underdog in movies? Who doesn't stop and ponder about the unlikeliness of fate? Well if you're that person who was cheering for the grinch to steal christmass maybe this book is not for you.  But for the rest of us who would like to understand more about our current president it is a must read.  I'm not going to cite passages or directly critize of praise parts of the book. I am not a writer (I'm a computer programmer), and you didn't come to Amazon to read my work. Get the book, read it, enjoy it and make your own opinion.  I liked it.
0439023513|3.0|Let me say I loved this series as a whole and this book is obviously a must read. It's a very good book with touches of brilliance, but all in all I felt that it was rushed and just not as good as it could or really should have been.  SPOILER ALERT  My main beef with this book is the fact that far too much time is devoted to Katniss being injured, unconscious, delirious, distraught and/or drugged up. It takes up a significant portion of this book that would have been better spent developing the story along with the characters and the relationships between them. And this is significant because the overall story and characterizations were underdeveloped, and felt very rushed at the end. I understand that it was important for Collins to portray the distress and hopelessness that Katniss felt, especially at the end, but I think she over did it, and the overall story suffered. Also, why was Katniss unconscious for every major event? We are supposed to experience the story through her point of view, not hear about it from her point of view. This also hurt the story. And the final thing, of course, is the way the love triangle played out. Although I thought Gale made more sense, I can understand why she would end up with Peeta, if the right reasons were given. Killing off Prim with a bomb that Gale designed and having Katniss blame him for it was just a cheap and easy way to resolve it(Prim didn't even have to die. Just the fact that Coin killed those children and wanted to stage another Hunger Games would have been enough for Katniss to kill her). But even then, Katniss was longing for Gale back home in 12, hoping he would appear silently in the woods as he always does. But why did she chose Peeta? Simply because he was there, and Gale wasn't. The only thing that made sense in this regard is the one line about Gale being to similar to Katniss, and Katniss needing Peeta to basically balance her out. This should have been elaborated, and it should have been her decision. Instead, she just didn't really care, took what was given. She was a shell of her former self, dead inside. I understand the point that Collins is trying to make about war, but she doesn't even think of resilience or the hope that Katniss always portrayed. Just plain misery, no balance, just misery. She ruined the character of Katniss, and really Gale and Peeta too, just because she had to force her anti-war message down our throats. She butchered the ending of this series, and it's a shame, because the overall message could have been about a whole lot more than misery.
B006UG90RM|1.0|Well more power to Van Halen if they get most of the people to like this and it sells like the other DLR/Van Halen issues.  I just dont like it at all.  And I like almost ALL of the Van Halen releases with David lee Roth.  The only exception is Diver Down which I could never really get into plus all the covers and instrumentals!  I was listening to the new CD in my car last night for about the 5th time, and I was just shaking my head.  Most of the songs are just terrible, in other words Eddie didnt do a good job selecting or writing new songs.  But that is not the only problem.  EVEN the decent songs, Roth ruins them with his vocals.  Why is he talking, rapping, yelling????????  DLR has never done vocals like this on older Van Halen albums.  Yea he lets out a screech once in a while, or raps during a portion of the song, but it all fits together perfectly!  Here it sounds obnoxious!  Eddie plays the guitars just fine on this album and the absence of Michael (although lacking) does not make this album bad.  It's bad because it's a bad album of songs performed poorly.  I never thought that would happen.  David's voice is still fine, he could of sang the way he always did and this would be a mixed album (like a 3 star review) some good, some junk!  So far most of the critics and fans have said they like this album.  Well that's fine, I bought it because it was the first Van Halen album in ages, even longer with Dave.  If it's a hit and sells a couple million copies, Van Halen will be back to try it again.  I want them to make another CD.  I just hope NEXT time the results are better than this!
B005I4JG80|5.0|I agree with the reviewers who gave this book good reviews. How can you review or give an opinion on something you haven't even read? Brings to mind one of the lessons stressed by the French regarding food...Just Taste It!  All the negative reviews were based on how the author looked like on TV, how the French are not the authority on parenting, how you can just pick up any good parenting book, how they let their kids drink wine, how they feel more superior to Americans, how the French are lazy...sigh...all stereotypes.  I bought this book as soon as I woke up and couldn't put it down. The author starts most chapters with her own experience but she does have studies to support her observations. It tackles a lot of issues that I feel should be openly discussed regarding how we are educating our kids. Should we really hyper/helicopter parent? Or should we just build the framework and let them grow? Do we shelter them from failure? Or let them learn how to deal with it to prepare them for real life? Should we encourage speaking/stamping out shyness? Or should we teach them to think first, analyze, and frame a good argument? Do we really need to raise kids who feel entitled to rewards when they didn't work for it?  I can't wait to see what INTELLIGENT debates this book would ignite.  This book is highly recommended.
B006OAB3ME|1.0|What the hell is Paul doing?  I am waiting for the followup to the very decent Memory Almost full and we get this?  What is this anyway?  Music Paul's mother grew up listening to?  F
B002MQYOFW|5.0|these books where so good I was crying by the last sentence of the last book, because I knew there wasn't another after that. That's funny to because it took all my friends to make me read this book, and I read everything i can get my hands on! I didn't even stand a chance. It was love at first read. I couldn't put it down! I read all 3 books with-in a week, i even failed a test or two because there was no way i was going to put this book down to study!....love, lust, action, family, anything you want this book has it. You feel like prim is your to protect. You cannot help but put yourself in the games. please read! you will never be sorry, plus there's 2 more books in the series;)
0545265355|5.0|This trilogy is extremely well written.  The first book was especially riveting.  I ended up reading it in less than 24 hours and even though I had lent if from Kindle's reading library I went ahead and bought the whole box set.  I actually had seen a preview for the movie which reminded me of Battle Royale and I thought I would read the book for free before spending $15 at the movies to see a possible cheap re-make.  The idea of the \\"games\\" are similar but that is about it.  I was pleasantly surprised by the Hunger Games story line, which really is a love story but not in a mushy way, it more about loyalty and truth.    I just couldn't find enough time to read this and never wanted to put it down.  I read a few reviews saying that the second book is just a \\"filler\\" and I have to disagree.  The second book was equally entertaining and it makes you want to pick up the third immediately.    I do want to mention that this trilogy is exceptionally gory and the author paints very descriptive pictures of almost all of the deadly scenes.  I knew what I was getting into but even felt a bit of an uneasy stomach at some of the descriptions.  Additionally, Kindle's text-to-speech does the thing were it skips ahead about 10 pages a lot in the third book, which is a bit annoying (but that has nothing to do with the author or the book, that is Kindle's issue).    Overall, this is an excellent Trilogy.  I will be recommending it to friends and I will be rereading it someday.  Although, now that the book is so great I don't know how the movie will be able to compare.  ;)
0824835921|4.0|I have been struggling with kanji for years and have nearly every book under the sun.  I had pretty much given up and for years kept hearing about this book.  Figuring it would be like all the others, I didn't bother with it. My friend and I decided to have a kanji-challange and well, I figured it was my last hope.  Two weeks in, I'm recognizing kanji more than before.  While it doesn't work on pronunciation and \\"reading\\" them, it has helped enormously with recognition. Thumbs up from me and I've order book two and three for when I finish this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I resisted this for a long time, wanting to preserve the old way of Bible navigation and study - but this is SO simple to use! I love having different versions at my fingertips to cross reference, have used a couple of the reading plans &amp; they're great. I know I haven't even scratched the surface of all it can do - but I'm totally sold!
0783225784|5.0|I really wanted this movie and it was hard to find in a store so I came here and got it for under a dollar including shipping. It was a great buy, the movie works great, no troubles.
B005KMX866|4.0|I am a great fan of the Sun sound and Chris has done an absolutely fantastic job. So why only 4 stars ? Many of the songs are too perfect, too close to the original. Sometimes the facsimile is so good that you pretty much think it is the original. I'm sure Chris has such reverence for these sacred songs that he was reluctant to stray from the original. I would have preferred to hear a little more Chris in there. Nevertheless it is a woderful album. For my money, the rocking Chris Isaak composition \\"Live it up\\" is the outstanding track.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Everyone is a critic, and some of these reviews are long and drawn out.  Just going to say, I gave it a few spins & I like it.  Has that old school fun feel that Halen had back in the day.  Just be happy that straight up rock n' roll bands are still trying there hardest to put out a quality product.  Van Halen didn't change up, this could have been released as the follow up to 1984.  Oh well, i'm happy with it nonetheless, all be it almost 30 years later...  Thanx  David
B006UG90RM|5.0|this is a fantastic follow up to diver down. it back to the true heavy van halen sound. not the pop of sammy hagar, who i love solo.
B003ZYU3TG|5.0|What can I say?  It's a classic.  My brother and I  were talking about this movie while on vacation in Cancun and then I stumbled across it on Amazon.  Perfect timing for Christmas.  He loves it.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Perhaps it is the hype, perhaps I just don't get it. It took me most of the book before I realized why I did not like the writing: complete lack of figurative language. No metaphors, no similes, no analogies. For a book that tries so hard to immerse you into its very different world, I found this very disconnecting.  There is very little show, but a lot of tell. The story is first person present tense. Everything is from Katniss' perspective, where she tells you what she is feeling, what she sees, what she is doing, and what she is thinking. The problem is she tells you she is sad, or hungry, or scared. So I know she feels this, but I don't. There is very little description, no way for me to experience her world. What there is a lot of, however, is her thoughts: lots of rambling. While this makes sense: she is hunted and fear for her life in a very strange setting. It gets very, very tiring after a hundred pages. Yet this progresses throughout the entire book. If you can relate to a 14 year old girl, perhaps this will make more sense to you. But I obviously can't (not for the entire duration of the novel anyway), so this felt incredibly annoying. So there is no respite from the endless torrent of her inane thoughts. No other perspective from other characters.  And then there is the problem of character: Katniss has no personality. She is generically a good character. She is skilled at hunting, and she has a good heart. Whoop-dee-freaking-doo. Her main struggle is to stay alive, fake a relationship with the other guy from her district, and stay a live, and stay alive. There is no difficult moral dilemma to confront her. Every friendly person she encounters in the game that might pose such a problem is dealt with in some morally convenient manner. In short, she makes almost no real progression in her character. No development. She only begins to fall for the other guy from her district, Peeta, near the end, and he is but a one dimensional character even less fleshed out than Katniss.  Not even the basic premise worked for me: basically Battle Royale between strangers. While I had hoped since this was focused on just one character it would evoke more emotion, I was wrong. But what gets me is this: a dystopia where children are forced into gladiator style game and the districts are forced to watch, yet there is such a strong need to make it entertaining? If it is some form of punishment, why make it entertaining? I know this somehow makes sense within the context of the story, but I never thought it  believable. Maybe I am just too old for this.  This wouldn't be so bad if Katniss wasn't so thick-headed to begin with. Quite a few \\"surprises\\" were quite obvious from the beginning. But if you are new to pop stories fit for mass consumption (Hollywood, I'm looking at you) then you should find this entertaining.  While this book isn't for me, I realize I am in a very tiny minority. I just wanted to voice my opinion in case someone else finds it useful.

B002XZNHG4|5.0|It's easy to forget, with all its accessibility and charm, how groundbreaking Annie Hall was. Like Altman's Nashville, Annie Hall seemed to take every cinematic convention of the time and turn it upside down, or rear end it, or transform what it's usually used for for completely different ends: cartoons, flashbacks, voice-over narration from two points of view, breaking the fourth wall, monologues that come off like modern Shakespearean soliloquies, and more. The \\"plot\\" is bare bones. Two relatively normal people share a romance and live to tell about it. Annie Hall is that tale, but the seeming simplicity is made complex by smarter than smart dialogue, obscure references, and fantastic performances, especially by Diane Keaton who LIVED the part of Annie so much that it's difficult to tell where the actress left off and the real life personality began. From beginning to end, Annie Hall is a delight. Brilliant editing, creating a seamless through-line out of what must have been an editing room mess-unless Woody story-boarded every scene; a production design that makes the seventies seem not one bit dated, and hilarious dialogue with gags that get funnier with each viewing. This was my first foray as a young man into what I'd call \\"smart\\" cinema, where the director and writer don't talk down to you but instead make you do some work to keep up with the characters. Woody's unsurpassed masterpiece.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|The cover itself is just fine, soft, and easy to hold, etc. I am a bit disappointed as the \\"stand\\" up feature doesn't really work...how have you found it to be?  but I am sure it will wear well. Kind of expensive I think, but then accessories always are
1451648537|5.0|What I enjoyed most about this book was how Jobs looked at life and the world in general. Make things simple and do not do any market research, just make something and people will like it. As an iPhone and iPod user I can only agree. Book never gets technical, reads like a train and really tells you what Jobs was like.

B0070Z4M4I|4.0|There's not much good horror/thriller films today but I find this 'Thing' good for my collection. I haven't seen the original 'Thing' but this movie gives you an idea what's with the original.  I say this is just good because there was too much talk at first. I hate chats. (lol) Anyway, this movie did the job for me, it scared my kids with those blood-sucking, human killing 'things'. A good movie to kill your spare time.
B005HEUF0Y|5.0|I've seen a lot of episodes, but just came across this one i had never seen.  It was amazing.  i wish they would have a new star trek series with writing like this
B005I4JG80|5.0|This is a fun and entertaining read. I found myself laughing out loud more than once and finishing the book in less than 24 hours. The author describes in detail her observations about what (some) French parents have found to be possible in child rearing that many modern American parents may believe to not be possible: children who go to bed on time, don't constantly interrupt or throw food and parents who haven't completely sacrificed their own lives and adult relationships. It's an interesting discussion of where boundaries are set, how authority is communicated, and how children are allowed to explore and experience the world with independence. She gives an honest account of how these ideas have worked with her own children and where she's had difficulty or been uncomfortable, while at the same time trying to fully understand and communicate the subtly different philosophy of parents she's encountered in France.
1904994679|5.0|I bought this for my granddaughter's 12th birthday. She loved it. While the people at her party were still there, she spent most of the time looking at her book.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|If you enjoy Jim Butcher, you will also enjoy Kevin Hearne. However I particularly enjoyed this series thus far because there is a serious amount of world making that goes into the story. Furthermore, it is revealed to you at just the right place to make you keep saying, \\"I don't *quite* get the complete context, but this is badass, and I want to know more.\\"  If you're looking for a good fantasy book that has quality character depth and world-creation with enough magic and fighting to keep your pulse up, this series is for you.  The only negative comment I can make is I wish his next book were out already :)
B000OJFV3S|4.0|I started watching this show because its free if you are a prime member. I must say that I have really enjoyed the show so far, every episode keeps me engaged and wanting to see the next one.

B002GHHHKQ|5.0|(contains spoilers)<br /><br />In my review I don't wish to say too many things about the technical aspects of the movie. I think that, style-wise, this is classic grand epic cinema, with large shots, larger music, a real treat in my eyes.<br /><br />I wish to put another point of view into the discussion of the movie's portrayal of science versus religion. Many of the reviewers seem frustrated by the, what they consider, ambiguity the movie holds towards this question, which they feel is significantly different than the balance in the book. I have a very different opinion about this.<br /><br />I am, I should say, completely atheist. I am also a social scientist. This movie, in my opinion is a one of a kind social science fiction movie. The contact with extraterrestrial beings is the premise, but the real story is that of human society and the reaction to the contact. Sagan, atheist himself, devoted much of his life to try to educate people about science, and about understanding religion from a social history perspective, not as a relevant tool to understand the material world today. In Cosmos, Sagan explores the reactions of human society and social structures to a possible contact. Unfortunately, we still live in a very backwards, religious society, and this is what the movie shows. The focus on religious dilemmas in light of the first contact is unfortunately very likely to happen in such case. The impossible position that Foster's character finds herself at the end does not leave the \\"science vs religion\\" debate open handed, as we learn that the evidence which proves her main argument (that she experienced 14 hours in what seemed like a fraction of a second), and shows how it is being hushed by the government.<br /><br />In another book, Sagan wrote of the \\"demon-haunted world\\", and traced the struggles of scientists to stand by the evidence in a repressively religious environment. Contact, the book and the movie, puts forth an argument that today, in many ways, we still live in a demon-haunted world, in which the role and social power of religion is much too strong.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing, captivating, a real page turner. These are some of the words I thought of while reading this book. If you were like me, you would read the title and think: \\"It sounds dumb.\\" Now, this is what I thought. Then the reviews popped in. I ended up reading them and deciding to finally read this so called \\"Masterpiece\\" The first chapter was boring to me. But the second pulled me in and grabbed my attention. The book was not at all what I expected. The book is about a 16 year old girl named Katniss Everdeeen who lives in District 12, Panem. The world has come to starvation and lack of resources. The solution? Less population, and entertainment to the Capitol of Panem. The capitol and Panem is ruled by President Snow, the evil genius of the games. 13 [Now 12] District are to send 1 woman and man to compete in the games. They will fight to the death.<br />Questions About Book:<br />WHAT IS THE HUINGER GAMES?<br />The hunger games is a fight to the death in an arena. 24 tributes are to go in. Only one man/woman make it out alive.<br />WHAT IS IN THE GAMES?<br />Other teens or children trying to kill you. Animals. Mutations. And other unexpected happenings.<br />WHO IS KATNISS?<br />Katniss Everdeen is a 16 year old girl whos father died in a mining explosion. She lives with her mother and her little sister, Primrose. They have a cat named buttercup. Katniss's best friend is Gale Hawthorne. He is also her hunting partner. Katniss and Gale hunt in a forest that is illegal to hunt in. Punishment is death.<br /><br />AGE RANGE-12+<br />MAY BE SCARY FOR SOME KIDS. VERY GRAPHIC

B006W0QOF2|1.0|This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Almost as bad as The American. Goslings character was incredibly strange. I dont think that Gosling acted poory, I think his character was just terrible. He didnt talk. And what was with the explicit violence? Putting his foot through someones head? Slicing the dudes arm lengthwise? It brought no value to the movie at all. And the romance? He barely said a word to her, was super creepy, and next thing yoiu know they are picknicking, eating cracked crab and Gosling is carrying the kid off to bed! lol
0553573403|5.0|You know the saying the book is always better than the TV show or movie that been based off the book. I love the show Game of Thrones on HBO, it is a must watch show.<br />Now that is said, I love the book even more. So much more details and background the TV had to cut out, the book is dripping with it.<br />I almost feel like I am in the North, at the Starks home, at the Ice Wall, well i will say more but I don't want to say any spoilers.<br />The Song of Ice and Fire series which Game of Thrones is the first book of, belongs on the same shelf as the Ice Wind Dale series and the Lord of the Rings.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I love this Kindle. I bought it for movies and books. But now I find myself using it as a business tablet.

Is that a Kindle?\\"  Con: Next time put a dog-gone microphone on it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the idea of 101 games, if the games weren't all cs100 projects that you had to buy to play as you advance through the sets of games. About 20 per cent of the games are buggy and unplayable, and about 50 per cent are simply the same game or a game that isn't fun.

B0068TL23G|4.0|The app is entertaining, and starts quickly. The layout of non-game play controls isn't great. But the animations and music and play are great! I highly recommend this game/application. However, the game is a little buggy, the music will start playing without starting the application, and I had to restart my device to get it to shut up.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|This movie was one of the few that made me cry. It was a very moving film about love. And it covered, surprisingly for me, a topic that I have grown interested in--WWII and how distorted that period of  history has become and how people can't even talk about it rationally. I was very surprised at how the movie showed a woman in Germany who was 1) not a jew 2) not a nazi and 3) not a spy. How it was a movie about an ordinary Germain woman in WWII making her way in the world . . . trying to make a living. To see the world through her virgin eyes was very very well portrayed in this movie. And the relationship was great. I think the way the story was written to show the boy being human and feeling when he first met her, his brainwashing/indoctrination at college, and the tug of war he goes through at the end to be human again but still want to fit into the politically charge world still was greatly done. The subject matter was very unexpected by me. I thought this was about something totally different. And I am really shocked that this movie ever saw the light of day given it didn't dwell on jewish death during WWII . . . I mean that was a horrible part of that history but it was not the only part of such a complex and trouble era.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|I got the impression reading this book that it is a form of the torture porn that has become so popular in movies these days.  There is so much senseless violence, with absolutely no redeeming features.  The real insult is when you get to the end and read \\"About the Author:\\"  \\"...she continues to explore the effects of war and violence on those coming of age.\\"<br /><br />That sounds like an insult and a slap to the face after finishing this book.  There are allusions to themes such as feudalism, class, humanity, ethics, morality, rebellion when subjected to tyranny, etc.  But none of these are explored in any meaningful way.  She just tosses them aside, through Catnip's mouth, saying, \\"Well none of that would keep me alive, so whatever.\\"<br /><br />To take that tact throughout the book, to give it some potential and then toss that potential aside so effortlessly, just to end by saying you were trying to explore the effects of war and violence on children all along?  What a joke.<br /><br />The werewolfs, the redheaded mute, the young group of preppers who at first seem cognizant of the disgusting nature of the event, only to end up prattling on like gossiping teenagers about where they were and what they were doing when this or that kid was killed...  A post-apocalyptic world there have been natural disasters and resource wars, still left in tact after one faction used nuclear/biological weapons on another, yet for some reason there is a powerful air force capable of swooping in anywhere at a moment's notice?  A world in which mutant birds had to be genetically engineered in order to conduct SIGINT operations, yet there are invisible cameras capable of capturing every single piece of action that happens in the arena?  What happened to all of that?  None of it is explained.  Indeed, none of it is even treated as a problem.<br /><br />At the end of the book, none of that is even really referenced.  It all ends *spoiler alert* on Catnip's conundrum of Gale vs Peeta.  Oooohhh, so very compelling.<br /><br />The only reason why I will finish this trilogy is because my cousin loves the books, and she wants me to be interested in something that she likes.  Hopefully some of these themes and questions will be explored in the later books, but I have my doubts.ason why I will finish this trilogy is because my cousin loves the books, and she wants me to be interested in something that she likes.

B000LE1GVW|5.0|I learned of Paolo Nutini after watching the movie \\"Something Borrowed\\".  I Googled and YouTubed him to death and then finally ordered this CD. It has not left my car CD player since I received it 2 months ago. \\"New Shoes\\" is my favorite pick me up tune in the AM on my way to work, while \\"Million Faces\\" and \\"Rewind\\" are generally favorites on the way home. \\"Last Request\\" is an absolutely gorgeous song...there really isn't a bad tune on the entire album. His voice is amazing...his lyrics are intelligent and interesting. He writes, he sings, he plays...he's the kind of talent we need more of. Listen to the samples here (or watch him on YouTube)...you'll be hooked-then buy the CD, you'll not be disappointed. I wish I had discovered this artist 6 years ago when this CD was released.  Next, \\"Sunny Side Up\\"...
B004SBS8LA|3.0|I HAVE THE GAME ON MY I-POD AND IS GREAT BUT ON MY KINDLE FIRE I BUY IT BUT IT SAYS I DONT HAVE IT!!!!!!!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is the only cover that I've tried for my Kindle Fire and it works just fine.  It fits securely in the case, looks nice, and you are able to make it stand by itself for hands-free reading.  I was a little nervous about buying one of the cheaper cases and after reading mixed reviews.  I am not disappointed in it at all and it serves my needs just fine.
B000OIBY4Y|5.0|Albert Camus' \\"The Stranger\\" provides an interesting view of the world through a slightly more curved lens. The book plots out what it would be like to live life fully realizing the frivolity of it all. Stripping away the personal meanings behind love, friendship, and death leaves the reader engrossed in looking at the world through a different light. Through this book it is easier to understand just how short each man's share on earth is and see how little it truly impacts the universe. To quote Carl Sagan \\"We are but a motes of dust suspended in a sun beam.\\"
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is the best Bible app I have ever used. I love the reading plan option and the ability to swap translation easily.
B006UG90RM|3.0|I really didn't want to buy the record, but caved when it was on sale at Best Buy. I wasn't expecting much as \\"Tattoo\\" is really NOT 1st single release material.  I started listening to it and thought \\"not so bad...\\", and got through it the first time without skipping to the next song once. Then I really started LISTENING.  The songs are decent, the riffs are solid and then things fall apart. DLR's voice has not aged gracefully. You can tell he is really straining. He tends to talk his way through some of the tunes, but when he is forced to actually sing, he really crumbles. YOu can hear it and it isn't pretty.  I would think that a band as decorated as VH would hire the best to produce and mix their next release. Especially such a highly anticipated one. The production is terrible. There is NO production value at all. When you listen to the likes of the Dave Matthews Band, Dream Theater and artists like Steve Vai, the production is absolutely flawless and crystal clear. This is the polar opposite. It sounds so muddy and garbled it's an embarassment. I've heard demos produced in garages sound better.  The mix is also very poorly done. There is no real distinctive voice behind any of the instruments. The pan is terrible and it seems almost as if all the various intruments were recorded on one track. If this was indeed multitracked, the mixer should be fired and the whole album should be remixed. I think it's really that bad.  I had very low expectations, so was pleasantly surprised and this will stay in my collection, if for nothing else than for pure nostalgia.  Is VH back?? Nope, they just older and very sloppy.
1596432594|5.0|Let me say that I really didn't dig this book.  I simply prefer the good old fashion biographies.  Why did I give it five stars?  Though I generally dislike graphic novels, this one was fantastically creative: a biographical graphic novel.  On top of this, the information is incredibly similar to that found works like \\"Surely You're Joking Mr. Feynman.\\"  I think this opens up another route by which people can enjoy history of science and similar subject matter.  On top of that, I think Feynman is among the most interesting personalities among all thinkers, which makes for a great boost of enthusiasm for anyone interested in or potentially interested in the subject matter.
B004YXE438|5.0|The demo version gives you a taste of the challenge ahead.  This isn't just a regular jigsaw puzzle.  It has difficulty levels.  On the medium level, the pieces can be rotated.  You no longer can use the edges to build a shell then fill in the blanks.  The hard level is truly hard.  It provides absolutely NO help with edge pieces.  You are left to rely on your memory to build the puzzle.<br /><br />The puzzles come in multiple sizes: small (12 pieces), medium (20 pieces), large (30 pieces), and huge (48 pieces).  Surprisingly, the huge puzzle size fits nicely on the Kindle without having to scroll left/right or up/down.  Some are in portrait mode.  Some are in landscape mode.<br /><br />The game comes with around 50 puzzles.  You start with a tutorial and work your way through the list of puzzles.  They have to be completed in sequence -- though I'm not sure why.<br /><br />Gameplay is fast and intuitive.  The pieces are mixed up and you presented with the board.  Drag and drop pieces all over the board -- they don't have to be adjacent pieces either.  You can drag one piece from across the board to the other end.  Pieces are rotated with a quick tap of the finger.  There is a menu option to provide a \\"reminder\\" of a completed puzzle.  You'll need that for a lot of the puzzles.  They are fairly complex and will keep you busy.<br /><br />I wasn't a jigsaw puzzle person before using this app.  I am now!  The demo was so good, I bought the full version.  There's talk of expansion packs too.<br /><br />The dev is interested in input from users.  There's a link to a Google survey on the app's main page.  They talk about providing the ability to purchase expansion packs from within the game -- a major convenience.<br /><br />A fun game created by an involved developer.  It's a bargain at twice the price.
B005KELW26|4.0|I have been using this folio cover for 1.5 months now. I love this cover for my Kindle fire, but I couldn't quite give it a full five stars because of two small complaints: 1. The \\"soft inner lining\\" described in the details is this fuzzy velvety stuff that attracts lint and dust like no other. It might not bother some people, but I have to take a lint roller or piece of tape to it once a week to get all the fuzzies off. 2. The purple, \\"leather-like\\" finish has started to rub (or peel) off on the corners, revealing the dirty-white stuff underneath. Granted, my Kindle goes in and out of my purse all day long, so the corners get a lot of contact. It's just starting to look a little scuffed.<br />However, I love everything else about this cover. The purple color is great and the finish looks nice. It is extremely lightweight and non-bulky, but it seems to protect my Kindle and the screen just fine. I stash a microfiber cloth underneath my Kindle in the case, and there is enough room between the little magnetic close tab and the device that I can clip my stylus on the tab and the magnetic closure keeps everything secure. Unlike other Kindle fire covers and cases that I have seen, the cover flap does not leave any weird patterned smudges or marks on the screen. I will probably use it until it starts to fall apart. A very good value for the price.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game its a retro game in a digital age. very few ads for being free. you rack up points for every play.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|My kids love love love this movie  its fun for the whole family. funny and the kids will sit still through the whole thing which is a plus :)
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I had been admiring this cover long before I finally purchased the Kindle for myself and even recommended it to a friend, who also purchased one for her Kindle.  The Kindle fits very well and snugly into the cover and I have no fear that it will fall out or wiggle loose.  I think what I may like best about the cover is the way it feels.  It looks like leather, but is apparently some type of fabric.  It is very soft to the touch, like a favorite well-loved leather purse, but have a sturdiness that I know will protect my Kindle as I carry it around.  There is no actual built-in stand, but the cover can be bent backward and used to prop up the Kindle.  I also like the look of this cover ~ you could tuck the kindle onto a bookshelf amongst your library collection and it would blend right in.  I'm very happy that I purchased this cover and don't anticipate having any trouble with it.  After a month, it has worn well and looks fabulous!
B005TBWN0K|5.0|u must get this app if u like to draw on your pics.it was a little hard 2 understand at first but then you will get the hang of it.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|well is all right but funner more interactive games though. I do enjoy it though. my fav game is either wishing or the serpent.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|one of the first apps I bought on the official market (for $2.99) &amp; I've never regretted it once. just buy it.
0439023491|4.0|The first book is such a page turner!<br />This book however, took me some time to get into but After chapter five, the reader will def. not want to put this book down!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the points required to unlock games increases quickly and it can take quite a long time to open new games
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that its great because its great for passing the time. I also think that its great because it has plenty of games for you to play. And it has plenty of challenges to beat.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game-my daughter played mine on kindel loved it and downloaded on her ipad game is for anyone.
B0058VW36U|5.0|cut the rope is very fun. I like the cute monster Omnom. this is a good game for kids.I really love the game
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover is great! Not only is it light weight but it fits snug & I have no worries about my fire getting scratched. I also like that the front cover is secured with a easy to use strap that holds it in place when I'm reading. If there were anything I'd change & thats I'd love to be able to put a skin on it :P I'd recommend this cover to anyone that wants protection without adding bulk.
B0033QC0WE|5.0|SIR John Eliot Gardiner, that is. These performances are the best I've heard on period instruments. And now they're affordable to just about everyone, which is wonderful. If you've been wondering about these, now's the chance to get them at a much better price. You won't regret it!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I love the Hungar Games and Catching Fire was pretty good, but overall Mockingjay fell flat for me. The \\"action\\" sequences were long and boring, it's pretty gruesome, and it is too science fiction for my taste. I liked the futuristic science fiction in the first two books, but this one was just too out there for me. The ending is great and wraps up the series well, but i could have used 100 less pages to get there.
B006UG90RM|5.0|It's everything you could wish for as a VH fan of the DLR lineup. It's a blistering album, very reminiscent of their 70's sound. It's no wonder that they went back to the old tapes for this, it's got a feel of the VH1, VH2, Women And Children First era. Anyone ready to bury EVH will have to wait, he's on fire throughout. He's got many different sounds going in here, crunching rock, metal, blues...one thing is certain, Dave brings out the best in his guitar playing/writing. Ed has taken many verbal shots the last decade, but it takes more than that to de-throne the King. As for Dave, his lyrics were always tongue in cheek, always read between the lines, amusing and memorable ad libbed stuff, where Sammy was so often over the top sex that it was embarrassing. Now, his early days classic yelps may be gone, but his voice is strong throughout the album. If they didn't break up in 1985 you could see this type of album from them....actually, with EVH starting to get into keyboards at that time I wonder if some of this stuff would have stayed in the demo boxes, cause there's not a keyboard to be heard, except for a sliver in Tattoo....and that's Dave's doing. Wolf plays a solid base, they gave him some freedom in the mix, and the background vocals may not be MA, but very solid nonetheless. By far the longest VH album with DLR, at 50 min, but nothing over-extended. Everything clocks in at about 4 and half min or less, a few less than 3, but with the blistering feel it's enough. I can't believe it took 28 years for these guys to put a new album out, but the proverbial \\"it was worth the wait\\" is true here. They put themselves out there to be compared with their former selves, and they came out swinging......
B004SBQGHS|5.0|very addicting and fun game. my only complaint is that it takes forever to get updates with new levels!  even my 6 yr. old loves this game!
B005T87QCI|4.0|I think it's a great game but why can't you be atom he's kind of the main robot in the movie and commercials.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|I love the game and it works great on my phone but it crashes constantly on my Asus Transformer Prime.  I would really appreciate it if the developer would update it for Android 4.0 Again I love the game but I would really appreciate a fix. Thanks
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I started to submit a review, an error occurred. Then when I attempted to go back in my reading plan...the app started me over.  When the daily reading progresses to new day, an error message occurs. I will attempt to re-start a reading plan but hope that it does not crash again.  There is always my regular Bible that does not give an error message, ever.
0439023513|5.0|The third in the Hunger Games trilogy, this book was the most exciting!  I loved the way that it ended, and felt very satisfied - which is not always the case when ending an excellent series.  Loved it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I am in mostly pre-ap classes and I ALWAYS have to type reports and what not. I don't have my own computer, but I have my own Kindle Fire, so if I can't use the computer because someone else in the house is using it (which I barely even use anymore thanks to Evernote) I can type my homework on my Fire. Another reason I like this app is because I can easily listen to my Amazon MP3 music while I type. Whenever I finish I just email it to another email address and go on the computer and print it. I can even start typing what ever I need to while I'm in school and get a head start on my homework and maybe even finish it. If I ever forget to print out the paper or bring it to school, I can just email it to my teacher and not get 10 points off (if I bring my Fire to school that is, and we are allowed to so I do most days)  I would highly recommend this app to students :)
0439023483|5.0|Could not put it down.  The characters are unforgetable.  Best book since twilight.  WAY better than I expected.  Both of my children (6th and 9th grade) recommended that I read them - but it wasn't until I saw the movie trailer that my interest was piqued.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I searched long and hard for that PERFECT kindle cover!! And I've found it in this cover. I read through many surveys, and it does fit the kindle, it is a little tight but i'd rather have it tight around my kindle than loose and risk it falling out.
0439023491|5.0|My children, ages 11 and 13, said that they did not like the second book in the hunger games series as much as they liked the first one - but I thought that it was equally as good!  Another page turner, and could not put it down.
B0071T5PN0|1.0|I'm not going to go on to long on this.  I got tired of reading the long reviews.  5 stars,... let's get real.  I went in to buy the album and sampled it all the way threw.  VanHalen died with the departure of the Red Rocker. (Yes I love the early stuff too) After reading Sammy's book,... I see some explanation as to why this album blows. Dave can't sing like he used to.  Ed can't play like he used to.  Alex's work is still alright.  Now,...  What bass?  There is a lot missing.  I'm not even going to start on the trained monkey sound. I guess I'll go back to my Montrose Sammy Chicken Wabo etc. and be happy.

B005OK81HA|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by this cd! Price was right so I took a chance and I am glad I did.  The re-recordings of some of their classic material really surprised me.  Each one has some subtle differences but I am already liking the new recordings almost as much or more than the originals!  The cover tunes all stand out in there own special way and each version is instantly recognizeable as the Scorpions.  I always loved their version of the Who's I Can't Explain and they have done justice to each of these choices as well.  Best of the bunch is Tainted Love followed closely by the Kinks All Day and All of the Night.  If you are a fan of the Scorpions or just good old 2 lead guitar rock and roll then buy this cd.  Klaus never sounded better!
0143118757|5.0|This isn't just about Negotiating.  Its more about learning how to identify a person's underlying concerns. Surfacing those are essential to moving a discussion forward. Arguments result and discussions stall when each side's real (underlying) concerns are threatened or remain unaddressed/un-surfaced. In short, if you could benefit from solving conflicts and gaining more alignment (at home, work or elsewhere), this is simply a must-read.  It's a classic.
B000Y0VTV0|5.0|*Spoilers*<br /><br />Nice episode.  It's fun to see the actors trade characters through out the episode.  I was sorry that none of the guys traded bodies with a woman!  Would have been funny to see Christopher Judge be Samantha Carter and vice versa.  I thought the SGC would have made an effort to get the alien scientist a new body.  A convict on death row would have made a good replacement as the person would not be missed.  That's my two cents.  A good character episode on the whole.
0062060562|1.0|In trying to read this ponderous book there were times that I wished I had amnesia so I'd forget where I left this dog of a book.  Talk about b-o-r-i-n-g!!!!
B000Y0S72O|3.0|This episode is a repeat of many other sci-fi plots involving immersive virtual worlds.  In fact, Dwight Schultz was in a couple of them in Star Trek: TNG.  He was better as Lt. Barclay.  There was no question that the team would escape.  The main question of the viewer is how.  This was accomplished without any real creativity.  However, I did enjoy watching O'Neill relive his past and struggle with the death of a friend.  Daniel Jackson's experience gave the viewer new insight which ultimately did not have anything to do with the conclusion of the episode.  Carter realizes the environment is fake--something this viewer understood as explicit from the moment the cast got plugged in.  So, the plot was limp with the characters diffusely strung upon it.  Worth watching for a Stargate fan!
B006UG90RM|4.0|For context, I have been a VH fan from the beginning and felt the band died the day DLR was no longer part of it.  I like Sammy on his own, but with VH it was more of a pop band, no edge.  The edge is definitely back with this new album and the music is nothing short of phenomenal, old VH fans won't be disappointed with it.  Close your eyes and you'll think you are back in the late 70s/early 80s.  Eddie and Alex are amazing.  However, DLR is nowhere near the front man he was and he seems more like a used car salesman or carnival worker.  There are shades of his old self, such as on Stay Frosty, which is very much like Ice Cream Man, but it's just not consistently there.  Listen to him on 1984 and Fair Warning, both of which are among my top albums of all time, and compare for yourself.  I realize 25 years will do a lot to a voice, but it is a little disappointing.  Also, what's with the lyrics on Tattoo??? Great music on the song, but could the lyrics be any dumber??  Lastly, the backing vocals are lacking without Michael Anthony, just not the same.  Overall, the album is worth buying just for the music and what I will say positively about DLR is that he brings out the best in Eddie that Sammy could not do.
B005VPRETE|3.0|it does not keep together well.  We had a lot of fun putting it together--she needed my help.  And if we tried to move it, the pieces came apart.  Also the pieces are tiny.  It's a good idea, but needs some work to make it better.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I live this game and was really getting tired of resetting it and was really happy with this new update that provides longer play! Hurry, make some more levels!  Love it.

B006E4QCXU|5.0|FWIW, if you can read the full description, you can understand the complicated physics behind this app...NOT! Just know this...It's all full of STARS! Thanx, Scott.
B000002KDX|5.0|For a CD that's virtually been out-a-print for years??, this was an excellent buy.  The Album was a shoe-in in '72 for new artist of the year.  Funny, used to find this in just about every used LP bin in the nation.  Not so anymore.  Seller was quick to ship, and I highly recommend this remastered CD.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|very awesome game and thanks for making it it is very fun for teens and kids please I recondmend this hams for your kid
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|I personally was hesitant about getting this movie due to the cover art alone. However Amazon kept insisting i would enjoy it so i ordered it and watched it that night. Wow what a great movie! I was surprised i'd never heard of it beforehand. For those of you who enjoy story telling in movies i highly recommend it. With a child like innocents and intriguing story plot i wouldn't dare look away for even a second through out this film.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|after resetting and wiping all my data for the second straight time, I call this game worthless... too many hours lost to care to start over for third time.

B006UG90RM|3.0|Van Halen minus Michael Anthony is an automatic one point deduction.  I wanted to like this album, and some parts I like more than others.  I'd say half of the songs are great and the other half are fillers.  I also miss Mikey's background vocals.  I'd give it a 3.5 at most!
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Supernatural is super. lol i own 1-6. cant stop watching them ,as allways sevice was awesome. keep up the good work
B004MC8CA2|3.0|it was a great app until the update. know it says uh oh there Is a problem and then wont work. please fix! then it will be 5 stars:-)
B0002HZHXG|5.0|This is a additional siren for my sons' Bruder trucks.  The light bar is nice and well made.  My opinion is that the light bar should have been included with with truck.

1451648537|1.0|I was eager to read Steve Jobs because of his importance in history and how he found success despite his strange, unpleasant personality. But after hearing and reading what people have to say about the book, that Walter Isaacson blew a once in a lifetime chance to write a probing, in depth, definitive book about Steve Jobs, I will not read this book. I wonder why Jobs chose such an incompetent writer for his biographer.
B006UG90RM|5.0|After reading the initial reviews, purchasing this album, and listening to it several times I feel compelled to write my two cent worth.<br /><br />- First, I have no idea where the naysayers of this album base their reviews. I feel as if I did my homework when I purchased this and had a good critical listen beforehand.  Yes, I am a Van Halen fan but I certainly don't like every album they put out.  As a music fan I resent being labeled by critics that \\"I would like something just because it's my favorite group\\"...really people? In actuality I thought it was going to be terrible.<br /><br />- On that note I don't see how the critics don't hear early Van Halen. It's all there; the fantastic riffs, pounding drums and Dave's unique vocals.  It's everything a fan would want.<br /><br />-  In addition, guess what... it's 2012.  This is more than 30 years after their first release.  For these guys to even create something this retro-awesome is beyond me.  I almost want to accuse critics of ageism.<br /><br />- Last note,  is  A Different Kind of Truth is doing way better than Chickenfoot III (and I like Sammy's stuff) but it doesn't compare to this; A Different Kind of Truth is more creative and truer to form than any other album out by the \\"old guys\\"<br /><br />That's it.

B00003CXXS|3.0|Jurassic Park III should have been an exceptional movie. It had most of the cards in its hands; good actors, great special effects. The story undid it.<br /><br />The good parts first. Jurassic Park III looks great, that's for certain. The 3D dinosaurs by Industrial Light and Magic are incredibly lifelike and fearsome. The 3D animation is incredible. The Spinosaurus is an amazing, menacing villain with a spine-tingling presence, quickly demonstrated when he disposes of the menacing Tyrannosaurus Rex with relative ease. The cinematography is A+ as well, with sweeping vistas contrasted by lush, claustrophobic greens in the midst of the jungle. Jurassic Park III scores highly in the visual department.<br /><br />Even though the movie looks great, though, it has absolutely no substance. The central story is very flat and poor. Unlike the other two movies, where science really was at the forefront, here it's rather annoyingly one-dimensional. A kid gets stranded on Isla Sornar AKA Site B on an illegal parasailing trip. How stupid do you have to be to do that? His divorced parents trick Alan Grant into taking them there to save him, where they promptly get stranded and at the mercy of the deadly gang of dinosaurs.<br /><br />The problem is, it's extremely one-dimensional, and not in the fun way. Sam Neill reprises his role as Alan Grant, but he has very little to work with. Nothing is resolved at the end, either. There is no payoff at all to the depressing setup with Alan's present life, not even partly (and having him broken up with Ellie is very out of character for them both). In spite of bouts of fierce energy, the movie's atmosphere is tired and flat.<br /><br />The danger to the characters could've been much stronger if the movie'd dared to kill off some more of its characters. The script undermines the Spinosaurus's ferocity every time, making him barely feel like he's trying to catch the heroes. The T-Rex in the previous two movies was a constant threat, and fatalities were just frequent enough (and usually more) to remind us of that. Spinosaurus is very fearsome at the start of the movie but then puts on more of a show than an effort. One moment, we see him smashing through a solid steel fence in a great display of passion for the hunt. The next (literally), he can't even smash through a steel door. That's what I call a cop-out. Spinosaurus, buddy, you were doing so great!<br /><br />The movie isn't brave enough to be a mindless killfest or polished enough to be a satisfying story, making the dinosaur encounters, thrilling though they are, feel very anticlimatic. There is a particular shot where the characters fall, inside a damaged plane, and all yell while looking directly at the camera. It was akin to something from a full-on comedy, not a survival thriller.<br /><br />With a better story and script, JP3 could've been the movie it deserved to be.ally more) to remind us of that.

B0062NAVXA|5.0|Most movies today are pretty much trash.  A movie like Courageous are not often seen. This movie actually have much content that benefits your soul!  This movie actually influences you in a positive way. Unlike most trashy movies these days that promotes sexual immorality and violence, this movie brings much courage and good healings to people.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|First of all, I'll be upfront about this movie. I never got the title until I saw the extras. The extras explain that Matthew McConaghey's lawyer character works out of his Lincoln Continental car. Maybe I'm slow on the uptake but if the whole setup was this lawyer found it more convenient to work from his car, then I missed that. Even though there are lots of scenes of him going to and from court to wherever driven by his chauffeur, I just thought the open briefcase, the talking on the cell phone and the meeting up with the Hell's Angels clients on the road were all they were.<br /><br />In another scene you see McConaghey going through old files in his garage so I just assumed he worked out of his home. Anyway, that's where I'm coming from.<br /><br />The extras also pointed out by the book's author upon which the movie is based that the action occurs in this one justice area in Van Nuys, California, that houses various buildings such as a holding jail, courthouse and various bail bonds offices. In the movie I never figured that out as when they cut from scenes in each of these places you never really see McConaghey walk from one building to the next.<br /><br />So in this sense despite a terrific movie that has great characters, tremendous twists and turns, great supporting cast (Marisa Tomei and John Leguizamo are among the \\"names\\") a very evil Ryan Philippe, I don't think the director who converted the book to screen if it took the extras (which are all pretty terrific) really was able to give us a sense that much of the courtroom and prisoner-lawyer scenes were all within virtually the same block.<br /><br />The extras (and sorry to go on about them more than the actual movie but they really are terrific) also had the author Michael Connelly (a former LA Times crime reporter)take us on a drive around the LA of the Lincoln lawyer which was endlessly fascinating and very much Raymond Chandler-esque.
B006UG90RM|5.0|It would have been so easy for this album to be terrible/lackluster/uninspired. Against all odds,VH has re-captured the past glory (and then some). \\"Tattoo\\" is the weakest track on the album by far. After that,there just is no weakness.When I first listened to this my thoughts were:\\"Damn,that's good,but it's not as good as Fair Warning/VH1.\\" Now I'm not so sure. I was late to the VH party (Diver Down in '82) but have owned the back catalog and bootlegs for years. This is at worst the 3rd best VH ever and possibly the best. If you doubt,take a look at the reviews above;see a trend there? Oh,and for the haters:give it a rest. Classic VH fans aren't going to the Chickenfoot reviews trying to troll. I guess that says plenty.

More troubling is the author comes off like an immature 18 year old, bragging about bar fights and how many \\"savages\\" he's killed.  If you're interested in reading about a sniper, the story of Carlos Hathcock is much better reading.

B001GF7WRW|4.0|Sound is pretty good, definitely worth the cost.  Relatively neutral and fairly clear mids and highs.  I have better headphones but they cost three times as much (and that's on sale, like these).  They actually look and feel fairly cheap, in spite of the quality sound.  The pads aren't super comfortable but aren't distinctly uncomfortable either, although the plastic headstrap gets a bit irritating after a while (of course, I'm bald, so if you have hair, that might prevent the irritation).  These are very light (which is good, since it's probably what keeps the meh pads and cheap strap from being problematic) and the semi-open nature means a bit more open sound, of course, but also airflow to keep them from getting hot, a problem I experience with most circumaural headphones, including some other semiopen ones.  End result, I wear these 8 hours a day at work and never feel the need to take them off, which I can't say about any other pair I've ever owned.  Cord is insanely long.  It's soft and flexible so it's easy to bundle up and stick in your pocket, if you want to, but it can get in the way.

B006UG90RM|1.0|Let me start off by saying that I do NOT buy into the Sammy Hagar vs. David Lee Roth garbage that I see being plastered all over these reviews. If any of you who are old enough can remember back to 1978 when that very first Van Halen album was released, it was a wonderful album to behold. Now, if you loved that 1st album and loved the Hard Rock music genre you'll remember what else you were listening to back then? UFO, Aerosmith, Black Sabbath, Blue Oyster Cult, Scorpions, Rush etc... Probably somewhere in your record collection there was some Montrose and possibly some Sammy Hagar. To us growing up back then, we liked all this music in this genre, including Sammy Hagar.<br /><br />Now, I do agree, Van Halen is NOT Van Halen without David Lee Roth. Pure and simple. I loved the guy as much as anyone one else who listened to and went to see their concerts. When Sammy joined I was sad because I really loved Sammy solo and Van Halen with Roth.<br /><br />When DLR released his EP of cover songs shortly after leaving Van Halen in 1985, there was some hope that a solo Dave was gonna be interesting. When \\"Eat 'Em And Smile\\" in 1986 was released, I ate it all up, loving the whole album. Then, in 1988, the ship started to sink with the release of \\"Skyscraper\\", and it wasn't just me, look at the chart history. Sure \\"Just Like Paradise\\" hit number one on the US rock charts, but it was more of a cheesy pop song that is still pretty bad today. It was evident that the song writing and overall quality of DLR's albums was going down hill.<br /><br />Sure, DLR has released only 7 studio LP's since his split in 1984 with VH, but the quality of each just progressively gets worse. Just listen to them if you dare. Where were you all through these DLR years when he sold very few copies of his solo stuff?<br /><br />What has my head spinning is the amount of reviews that state that David Lee Roth is back. Maybe with Van Halen, but he's never really been too far away. 2003 is a long time since his last LP, \\"Diamond Dave' but if you listen to it, you'd be glad that he didn't make another.<br /><br />Jump on the bandwagon here....<br /><br />With this new Van Halen album, \\"A Different Kind of Truth\\" the songwriting, especially the lyrics, which we all know is 100% Dave, is still pretty poor and at times very childish and almost unfinished, and embarrassing as hell...and don't give me that crap on how these are old songs, reworked. What kind of cop-out crap is that? It didn't work then, so let's push it on the public now? Dave's voice is unmistakable, but is showing BIG signs that he's not a kid any more. Just listen to the intro to \\"Stay Frosty\\". It's probably one of the worst vocals I've heard in years. Hey, I'm getting older too and can't do what I used to, but I do know when to quit.<br /><br />And, when it comes to they music. I do admit that it is damned good on most tracks. The problem lies with the vocals though. I'm not going to listen to an album for the music if I cannot stand the vocals. Plain and simple, if I bought this CD, I'd never put it into my player again. I'm SO glad for Spotify, which allows me to preview the whole CD without having to buy it.<br /><br />I read one review that said something to the effect of: \\"How can a TRUE Van Halen fan dislike this album?\\" and also, \\"You're not a fan if you don't like this album.\\" Well, that's BS!<br /><br />I really think that people who pre-ordered this CD or bought the digital MP3 version, had SO much faith vested in it, that they were going to like it no matter what. There's also the people who will buy anything from an artist, even if it is inferior to prior work. Then, there's the younger listeners who've listened to their parents old albums and are so excited to be feeling a piece of the excitement when a major band like Van Halen releases something. Not too many bands these days have stirred up the musical pot like this new CD.<br /><br />And, my favorite fans...The ones who now go to concerts JUST to try and experience some old magic so they can brag about it. Yeah, these people know who they are. They never liked Van Halen back in the day. They were into disco or punk or new wave, and totally trashed Van Halen and all other bands in this genre. This goes for critics too, who hated thee types of bands back in the 70's and 80's. Now all of a sudden, these people have a change of heart and want to be part of the \\"Fun\\".<br /><br />I'll live with my memories of days past when Van Halen was still relevant and the audience was filled with teens and young adults, my age THEN..Not people trying to re-live those days. I'll take my old Van Halen albums and close my eyes and remember how it was. To those of you, enjoy this record because there may not be another. Eddie's making tons of money off of it and if he goes on a bender when this tour is over, he may never return.<br /><br />So, fellow and lady reviewers, this is my opinion. No one will change my mind or make me listen again. It's simple, some people like it and some don't. Respect those of us who believe that it's no good and that \\"Tattoo\\" song just may be one of the worst songs ever recorded....it was just fueled by all of the hype leading up to this release.<br /><br />And, if you like this kind of heavy music and want to listen to a great \\"Comeback\\" album, give a listen to: \\"Anthrax - Worship Music\\" and enjoy a truly GREAT album.ho they are.

B004EJUMT2|5.0|Upon searching for some new music in the metal vein I kept coming upon this album...it was constantly being referred to as \\"doom\\" and/or \\"sludge\\" so I went into it expecting something altogether different than what I got.  This is basically what it would sound like if a young \\"Melissa\\" era King Diamond sang vocals for the old Italian rock band \\"Goblin\\" who composed all of those awesome soundtracks for old Italian horror and giallo films of the 70's. Needless to say that makes for an interesting sound.  Give it a shot if you want something nostalgic, yet different at the same time.

B005LAIGN2|2.0|Could you love a country that abused and mistreated you? Could you fight, kill, or die for it? That question is answered with a resounding \\"yes\\" by the characters portrayed in this most recent film about the first all African-American unit of fighter pilots in World War II.<br /><br />  The film opens with three pilots encountering a suspicious train which they believed to be carrying armaments to the Axis forces. The more reckless among them, Joe \\"Lightning\\" Little (played by David Oyelowo) disobeys orders and attacks from the front destroying the engine and the train itself while causing not-insignificant damage to his plane. This caused great distress to the mechanic charged with repairing \\"Lightning's\\" plane while his disregard for the chain of command is the primary complaint of his group leader, Martin \\"Easy\\" Julian (played by Nate Parker). And in the background there is constant politicking from those who believe the group is a failure and a waste of resources while others like Colonel A.J. Bullard (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) are making efforts to secure more important assignments and the superior aircraft they would need to complete them.<br /><br />  The story of The 332nd Fighter Group is an inspiring chapter in American military history. So inspiring, in fact, that it's already been told once before in the 1995 HBO film The Tuskegee Airmen. While the HBO effort was not without its problems, overall it is a superior film. True, the dog fighting scenes in Red Tails are very well-done and highly entertaining but at the time HBO was not the powerhouse it is today and if there is one thing George Lucas knows, it's aerial battles. And I was happy to see him produce something that wasn't designed to capitalize on already successful and creatively exhausted franchises. Still, this is the lesser of two films on an important subject. As the 1995 film is available to rent on Netflix and available for purchase at prices cheaper than that of a movie ticket, see The Tuskegee Airmen instead.ad.

They will get top tutors and God help them should they complain. No time off for fun and games. Just focus on working hard.<br /><br />Amy shares her story with plenty detail. I wanted to keep turning the pages, as I wanted to know what happens next. You feel like a fly on the wall watching the girls throw tantrums, shout, scream and rage against their mother. You wonder when and if, it is ever going to end. Thankfully one daughter does manage to get through to her overpowering mother. She has a public temper outburst, of anger, hate and frustration. Finally, the drill sergeant mother pays attention, before totally alienating her daughter. I'm amazed their Jewish dad never stepped in and told Amy to calm down, and act motherly. Those poor girls could never do anything right in their mother's eyes. They are brilliant, yet she only found fault, for the sake of building success. Amy thinks American mothers don't care about their kids, because their children can do what they like and don't need to worry about school grades. Amy on the other hand cares too much about grades, awards and medals. It consumes and smothers her children's lives. We can all do with a dose of discipline and give our children direction and courage to persist and succeed. Amy is extreme, but she does have a point. If your kids watch TV all day, don't expect improved grades. If we follow Amy's example and get involved with our children's education, that can only be to their benefit.<br /><br />All in all, I'm happy Amy shared her story. If you look past the harsh tactics, there is sense in her reasoning. Amy suggests raising our expectations for our children. High expectation and some pressure, is what it takes to raise achieving children. Low expectation equals zero input from your children. From what I've read about the world's best sports champions, they also have parents and coaches setting gruelling training programs from a very young age for hours per day.

B0069UP2PI|2.0|Contagion has an often used but still interesting premise, the spread of a previously unknown and deadly virus across the globe at an alarmingly rapid rate.  It also has a big name cast, including Matt Damon, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law, and Kate Winslet, good actors who are sometimes capable of carrying a script with serious weaknesses that otherwise would be hopelessly dull or implausible.<br /><br />While not heavy-laden with special effects, the ones used, especially the global graphics that display the prevalence and frighteningly likely patterns of spread of the disease, are really quite scary, and the chemical models of the virus are fascinating to behold.  It looks as if the whole world is in for tough tests of the reliability of prevailing patterns of social organization under conditions of extreme threat and the ability of modern science to quickly come up with a cure or preventive.<br /><br />Predictably, rumors spread that an effective medication has been found, but that it is being hoarded by elites.  Sensationalist bloggers make the riot-provoking claim that a cure is well known and easily manufactured, but is being withheld by Big Pharma in a conspiritorial profit-couging scheme.  For a time, social chaos ensues and survivalism becomes a prevailing ethos.<br /><br />None of this is new or novel, but while it lasts, it's exciting.  As the virus evolves into more lethal forms, it looks as if planet earth may have met its epidemological match.<br /><br />And then everyting just sort of fizzles out.  Kind of like a guy running the 400 meters in the Olympics, burning up the track for the first 200, and then, exhausted, he just jogs the rest of the way.  Great beginning and then a good deal of disappointment.  Contagion leaves the viewer wondering, \\"what's the upshot?\\"<br /><br />I had high hopes for this movie, but ended thinking \\"Huh?  That's it?\\"  I can't imagine what the writers were thinking.  Even actors as good as Damon, Fishburne, Law, and Winslet can't make this one satisfying.  And why was such a big deal made of Fishburne's efforts to rescue his too-young-by-half fiancee'?  To demonstrate that in-the-know-elites really were making unfair use of their advantages ... ?can't make this one satisfying.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful app!! The ease of comparing translations is a big plus. The reading plans help one to maintain a commitment to daily time with the Lord, and the devotionals also. When I have had a customer-service issue, I found them courteous and helpful.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good games just hard at times would love to see more new games added great way to pass the time
B002BWP49C|4.0|The story begins with the anticipation the second to last adaption of the Twilight Saga will most likely be the best yet, due to its excessive advertisement and eager fan base. I, as a fan of The Twilight Saga, was also eager.  The film accurately portrayed several vital portions of the book, but appeared to be cut short. Given to be a short 1 hour and 48 minutes, it almost sparks the question as to why they cut the movie into two parts in the first place, whereas they easily could have made a good 2 hour and 45 minute film and the fan base would've been more than happy. You are left wanting more, but take into realization some parts could've certainly been extended.  For example, the honeymoon. There was a lot of hype about the \\"raunchy sex scene\\" between Bella and Edward, but essentially, it could have been much more than the few scenes showed. I am not saying that it should've come out to be a pornographic X rated film, but it should've certainly been lengthier, and Bella was meant to be bruised much more than the two bruises shown.  Bella being eaten away by the baby took up half of the film, however, it didn't appear to be as brutal or lengthy as intended. Her visions of \\"EJ\\" were not as vivid and it was not elaborated all too well. They did not show enough of the storyline in itself, where they could've definitely added more visits from Jacob, more anger from Edward and more overall Cullen anxiety. Rosalie did not appear to be as overprotective as the text read and Jacob's new pack was scarcely a part of the story line in itself, which was a bit of a let down.  Now, I am not bashing the film, because I, being an active member of the Twihard fanbase, loved the movie regardless of a few key points that I felt could've been added, but even if you love the stories as much as I do, you have to take a moment to admit that the bit in which the wolves are hearing one another's thoughts whilst having a beat down brawl, included with snarls and a poor excuse for what seemed like a children's movie, was all a little too much and a little too ridiculous. I almost wondered if Bill Condon made it as a joke. Of course he didn't, but it felt that way, and I couldn't help but laugh... That and the poorly animated baby was also a let down, and the vision of Jacob's imprint was just a little creepy.  However, the wedding was beautiful and the birthing scene (though could have been extended) was as brutal as the fan base wanted it to be.  Overall, it was a very well done portrayal of the book and it proved that Kristen Stewart actually has acting talent, which many decline. I have always known so, but I was grateful that others could appreciate her talents as well. Among that, the cast was all wonderful, as usual, and it was very tastefully done.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I love the Marware Microshell cover. It protects well, even with dropping it. It makes a nice stand to read if you are at a table. Very lightweight. The kindle fire is a bit heavy to just hold up for periods of time if you're laying in bed but the cover doesn't add any significant weight to it. The Bright Pink is very flashy, Love it!!! Also before I got it I often accidently hit the power button. This prevents that quite a bit! Im sooooo glad I purchased this cover!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app is just alright! Some games are too hard to unlock. it does fail to keep my attention long enough to care if I get to play more.

0385534639|2.0|I seldom review books, but on this one I felt I had to comment that when I finished, it left me wondering why I stuck with it to the end. Some of the characters were interesting, but they didn't seem to have much heart or anything I could either relate to or empathize with. All through this book I kept thinking that okay, any minute now, the fragments of the story can come together and make sense.  The plot was disappointing if you can call it a plot. Was the timeline jumping around or was the whole story scattered?  Not much of the writing contributed to the progression of the story--mostly detailed descriptions of a fantasy world that were interesting, but irrelevant to what plot there was.  It was confusing on who did what and when.  The ending seemed like the author was getting tired of writing the book and just wanted to get it done with a lot of words put in to make it a certain number of pages.  If the author was trying to create the same feeling as when reading the Harry Potter, she succeeded in some of the scene descriptions, but failed on the rest.  I wish I had stopped reading it half way through.
0525478817|5.0|I have always been a huge fan of John Green  since I read Looking For Alaska. His books have never disappointed me and The Fault in our Stars was no exception. I've read each of his books several times. I would recommend any of his books, not just to the young adult generation but to all adults. John Green writes beautiful books about topics univerversal to so many individuals. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading one of his books defintely check them out. I promise you wont be disappointed.
1583334386|5.0|Author did a great job of linking specific tangible steps to current research. The format here isn't just do X since X is known to do A, B, C. It's more along the lines of here's an interesting piece of research, here's what that research implies, and here's some way to take lessons from that and apply it in real life. There are no promises of success here. There are no crazy claims. Overall it's a pretty sound (and well organized) book.  As for the other reviewer's claim of \\"liberal bias\\"... completely lost on me. The only section that could even remotely be construed as liberal bias was the anecdote on how the president got in trouble for the \\"cling to guns and bible\\" speech a year ago. That was on a chapter about how stress lowers willpower if I remember correctly. The next paragraph is about Bush. And probably those two mentions are the only pages remotely connected to politics. Neither of which expresses support for policies or political viewpoints. Really the rest of the book is more focused on your brain, and bits of behavioral research from experiments.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|I enjoy the new album very much, it's very well recorded, superb performances all around and very authentic vocal delivery from the big Mac himself. This album made me delve into the Great American Songbook even more. For the enjoyment that it provided me and for opening my eyes to the other classics...Im very thankful. Thanks Paul!  Ps: How about releasing that \\"Cheek to cheek\\" outtake at some point?
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This performance at Albert Hall was the best Phantom I have ever seen.  The cast to me was brilliant.  The picture and sound was bright, clear, and thank goodness with a production this good. I have a 63 inch Samsung Plasma and a good sound system.  There are some very long reviews here, so no need to repeat what has already been said.  For me, the topper was at the end of the performace, ALW was on stage and brought out most of the original cast.  Most of the former Phantoms performed along with Sarah Brightman.  They are still fabulous.  Michael Crawford was also there but didn't perform.  Does anyone know why?  He mouthed one word at the end with the others.  One of the reviewers said that Sarah Brightman shunned ALW on stage.  I didn't see that at all.  Also he mentioned her voice had diminished.  I admit she looked a bit older and put a little of her weight back,(sounds like me)but I thought her voice was still great.  This is the best 22.00 I ever spent.  One last thing that doesn't have much to do with this show.  The soundtrack is DTS Master as is most of the newer blu rays.  Is it me or does it seem that movies with action scenes, or music come out loud and clear, bur the dialogue has disproportionally low volume?  I'd appreciate your comments.  Please enjoy this Blu Ray...This cast was young and equal in talent to the originals..
B001YYQ9SS|2.0|I'm not going to talk about the movie that much. The only thing I'll say about the movie is that if you're a huge FF7 fan, you'll love this movie for sure.  I just want to give a warning about the Blu Ray version.  It seems that Sony is using very cheap Blu Ray disc cases now. They're called \\"Vortex Eco-Lite\\" cases. These are VERY VERY low quality. They're made of a very flimsy plastic, and the one that specifically arrived to me seemed to be damaged in production, as the case was VERY scratched up and ripped underneath the vacuum-sealed plastic and the front of the case seemed deformed because it bent inwards towards the actual disc.  If you're a die-hard Blu Ray collector who wants your discs to be perfectly protected and/or wants a clean looking movie shelf, these new disc cases will disappoint.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|The book was entertaining, it has a good rhythm, but the dystopian future is hugely overshadowed by the author's self pleasing utopia. I found segments and descriptions of the book unnecesary, as if the author wrote them to create *his* (or a gamer's) perfect universe.<br /><br />Although the story is quite predictable, you'll find some unexpected narrative surprises. I liked that.<br /><br />What I didn't like was that some of these \\"surprises\\" or turning points were VERY far fetched... too ideal.<br /><br />The book was able to make me feel, happy, nervous and expectant. And even though I know it's science fiction, I like it when a story makes itself believable... I didn't find this story believable even if such universe existed.
B0055SWM08|5.0|All the positive reviews are accurate. It's worth the 99 cents.<br />The gameplay is smooth. And the game is easy to learn.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|I was psyched when I saw that this was released as a DVD set. The remastering of these episodes is stunning! I also like the first (2) movies that are included on the first disc. Those showed his initial crash and how they went about making him bionic. I never saw those originally, so that was cool. The attention to detail is great and I forgot how advanced & ahead of it's time this show was. I was 7 years old when this show first aired and it brings back great, great memories. I HIGHLY recommend this if you were a fan & I will definitely purchase all the remaining seasons as they become available. 5 stars all the way!!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Last year my friend read this book and I asked her what its about and she said all these gods and stuff and so a year later I read it and it was fabulous I loved it so I read the series now Rick Riordan is my favorite author his books have a lot of action for boys and girls plus lots of wars and many powers that the characters have and they are very cool so do ur self a favor PRAISE FOR RICK RIORDAN PLUS PERCY JACKSON AND THE OLYMPIANS
B006W0QOF2|5.0|I was expecting DRIVE to be another car-chase extravaganza ala FAST AND FURIOUS---boy was I wrong--and pleasantly surprised.<br />DRIVE is a complex character study with a few hot car chases--and it's also a strangely sentimental love story.  Director Nicholas Winding Refn effectively uses scenes of silence instead of cliched dialogue to illustrate the love story; subtle changes in lighting; a retro-sounding musical score that was actually written between the years 2007-2011.<br />The script avoids many standard cliches regarding stereotyped ex-cons, mobsters, villains, etc.  The Driver's anonymity and his abrupt comfort with violence makes his character intriguing.  The cast is excellent:  Ryan Gosling (so good in ALL GOOD THINGS) is both appealing and disturbing in his enigmatic role; Carey Mulligan is sweetly heartbreaking as Irene; Albert Brooks is amazing as the vile but likeable villain; BREAKING BAD's Bryant Cranston is excellent as best friend Shannon; Oscar Isaac is good as the doomed Standard; Christina Hendricks is an adequate conspirator and Ron Perlman is just perfect as another nasty mobster.<br />DRIVE is definitely Oscar material but sadly garnered only one technical nod.  It is an intelligent, original action movie with substance.  Highly recommended.
B0053JJLLC|2.0|I am a huge Michael Crichton fan and after reading PREY (great book btw), I was very excited to start on this one. It is very obvious that Michael did not write the whole book as there is a definite change/shift in the middle. Some of the characters start off with a real strong personality and then when you start to invest in them (as you do), they just sort of fade away. You are left at the end feeling quite disappointed and I personally felt cheated. It is such a pity that this would the last book of such a brilliant writer.
B004SVM7BW|2.0|OK, I read the reviews that said they couldn't open &quot;large&quot; PDF files.  No problem - I don't need to open &quot;large&quot; files.  Then I find out &quot;large&quot; is 1 or 2 MB.  I'm sorry, large is 5 or 10 MB - medium is 1 or 2 MB.  I just wasted $4.99.
B00656C6KK|5.0|Wonderful, relaxing and happy music. She is such an effortless and melodic LADY!  \\"My Heart\\" is my favorite. The tune by Terry Melcher was a pleasant surprise.
B001L51RQE|3.0|I caught a little bit of this on TV and wanted to see the rest, so I borrowed a copy of the DVDs.  I just have to say that while it's a visually good show, the music/performance/mix leaves a bit to be desired.  There seems to be very little live vocals, even the lead voice, with the exception of spoken word, appears to be lip synced.  All of the backing vocals seem to be prerecorded as well as extra percussion & guitar parts.  The audio is so hot, it pumps and crackles (stupid loudness war).  Many of the songs lack the energy & strength they once had.  I'll say, \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" took on a whole new direction that improves it in my opinion.  I'll also admit that I didn't particularly care for the original version though.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|I extremely enjoyed this book i had to read it for school two years ago and loved it so much ive read it at least 5 more times I love the two story lines and how they form together to create this amazing book
B000FQJAIM|5.0|Finally after waiting many countless years, Mr. Lucas decides to release the Original Theatrical Star Wars edition. The first disc is basically the CGI enhanced effects. This movie is where the saga began for the original triolgy. The movie starts with Vader attacking a ship and taking Princess Leia hostage and then follows Luke through out his journey. Anyway most people bought this DVD for the 2nd disc which is the Theatrical version. Many people will ask why is Lucas after shunning the fans for so long now decided to release the theatrical versions? The reason was piracy. People were making money of the theatrical versions but coping them and posting them on-line and burning DVD copies to sell them. Most of copies that were being sold were the 1993 Definitive Editions. And the mastermind of all Star Wars decided it was time to release them on DVD. Lucas didn't want to do anything special for the Theatrical versions so he went to his personal collections of his Star Wars Home Media materials and chose to copy his own copy of the 1993 Star Wars Definitive Edition on LaserDisc.  Its nothing but a simple LaserDisc transfer. So Basically he did this to cash on the Piracy sellers while selling it for a higher price. The worst part of 2nd disc is the letterbox widescreen which takes out 2/3rd of your tv. It didnt affect my WideScreen TV but still i wouldve liked it to be bigger. Anyway Image quality is not bad compared to my own transfers to DVD. Image Quality i would rate 9 out of 10. Sound quality is 10 out of 10 even though its only 2.0 Digital Audio. Its not bad but its not great. Best thing about the 2nd DvD is too see Han Solo shoot Greedo and not see them both shooting at each.
1439192812|5.0|I've always been a huge Richard Dawkins fan: The Selfish Gene, The River Out of Eden, The Ancestor's Tale, and on, and on, and on.<br /><br />This is a guy whose produced one incredibly thought provoking book after another.<br /><br />But here, writing for younger readers, Dawkins is perhaps at his best, breaking down difficult scientific concepts for a younger audience.<br /><br />In this wonderful little book, you'll learn about everything from where life came from to what rainbows are really made of.<br /><br />In a breezy almost stream of thought sort of way, Dawkins moves easily from one topic to another, always staying long enough to tell the story of what myth has had to say on the subject juxtaposed with what science now tells us.<br /><br />In this way, readers not only learn (in plain, simple English) what science does have to say as to these issues but also the important lesson that -- whatever our ancestor's ancestor's believed -- we now have the technology and the power to find out the real answers about why things are the way they are.<br /><br />For parents interested in helping nudge their kids in the direction of healthy -- non myth based -- understanding of the world around them I would happily recommend this book along with J. Richard Gott's equally wonderful Sizing up the Universe and a subscription to Jr. Skeptic as well.<br /><br />For the good or bad of it, the quality of life our kids will have is all too directly connected with the type of questions they themselves are willing to ask of themselves, others, and nature itself.
0547258305|5.0|This was such an intriguing read that I felt obligated to review. I bought this book based on reviews, and am happy to state that I love this book. I love that it has an interesting idea with 'Graced' people. Also the characters are engaging, the writing style not too flowery, and the loosely-based sequel \\"Fire\\" is also great. The book's overall feel is that of a realistic, yet optimistic view on the world and has adventure, life, death, romance -everything one  could ask for in a novel. Thank you Kristin Cashore, for giving us a truly stand-out series!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I am very happy with this game.  My kids love it. I am hoping to find more games like this.
B001B93H0O|5.0|DVD very good, but I thought it would be 4 DVDs but only 4 in 1  Buy more when you need, fast delivery. Thank you.
B000I2J6K0|5.0|This is my third pregnancy and I have NEVER enjoyed working out...until now. I'd been having a lot of pain and soreness, especially in my back, so I was hesitant to begin a workout--afraid it'd just be too much--but I finally feel good! I read through some of the reviews and agree that Erin doesn't count down much so you end up looking at the screen. However, after just a few times through the video, I'm familiar enough with it that it's no longer a problem. I've also never bothered to \\"collect\\" all the furniture needed to assist me, but it's easy to modify the workout to suit what I do have. It's broken into 4 segments: warm-up, dynamic movement, floor workout, and then stretch and relaxation.  I've been doing this workout every morning, and it makes me feel so good, I've even repeated it a few nights doing just the last two.  The partner workout didn't do much for me, but the regular one is so great I don't care. I am a petite person, in decent shape, but by no means an exercise enthusiast, not quite 30, and this workout is a great level for me.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|love it on android, PC, and web. not so much on kindle, which for some reason is different than the version on android phones.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Van Halen is polarizing band. That mostly comes from what singer/albums you pick.  A Different Kind of Truth is by all mean a David Lee Roth album. Not much song and the occasional hook thrown in every now and then.  This is not Hagar territory where each song aspires to be a top 40 hit.  If you like the Van Halen version heavy on guitar work and quirky lyrics (all DLR albums), then get this one.  If you're a Hagar fan, get it still, you might like it.  Great work from the guys.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children is haunting- but not in the superstitious, creepy way. More in the way that you think of the book long after reading it. This review is about 7 months after reading, and I still felt the need to review it for others. It's got mystery, action, adventure, and heartbreak. It's unique as well with the pictures and writing style. I highly recommend it and am excited for the upcoming movie as well!
B0053VKP8S|5.0|This little gizmo was pretty much plug-and-play from the SPDIF output on my M-Audio Audiophile 2496 sound card. Just connect it to the digital output with a suitable cable, set the switch to either Optical or SPDIF, and the audio appears at the analog outputs on the FiiO d3. No settings to program or software to install. Nice.<br /><br />  The quality of the sound is indistinguishable from the analog outputs on the same card, which is a $100.00 entry-level musician's sound card. So while a true audiophile might find this lacking, it's probably more than adequate to your needs if you're seriously considering a D/A converter in this price range to begin with.<br /><br />  By the way - for the first several weeks, whenever I STOPPED playing audio from the computer for more than a few minutes, the D3 would spit out horrible bursts of digital noise. After much fiddling with my software settings, I found that this behavior went away when I set the sound card to 16-bit/44,100Hz. The D3 is advertised as being compatible with 192KHz/24 Bit audio, so this was a bit of a disappointment, but it still sounds totally acceptable even at the lower settings. I am very happy with the purchase overall.
1594744769|2.0|The creepy vintage photograph on the cover drew me in when I saw it at the bookstore.  Then I read the inside flap and was even more intrigued.  It seemed like a really creepy, really awesome ghost story, but I could not have been more wrong.  It is more of a sci-fi/fantasy tale of teen angst, lightly peppered with a few vintage photographs that don't even really add anything to the story.  There was so much potential here to really make use of these photographs, but Riggs failed to use these awesome discoveries in any unique or interesting way.  If you enjoy science-fiction and fantasy novels in general, then by all means, buy and enjoy this book.  But if you are looking for a creepy, haunting ghost story, do not expect much.  After the first few chapters, you will be disappointed.  It's really not a terrible book, I just think the cover and description are misleading.  The pictures themselves, because they are real, vintage photographs, are worth looking at (I finished the book several days ago but still go back and flip through the pictures). I also think it's really neat that these photos came from collections of real people who discovered them in garage sales and thrift stores--it makes them that much cooler and more interesting. But the story really seemed to veer off track about halfway through the book and the it seemed that Riggs tried too hard to make the pictures fit the story.  Instead of having the pictures add to the story, I think the story actually took away from the pictures.  Bottom line of my opinion: pictures are fascinating that almost, in and of themselves, make the book worth checking out, but I think the cover and description are misleading. Not terrible, but not what I was expecting and didn't ever reach its potential. Also-I HATE when stories end on a cliffhanger with absolutely no satisfiable resolution.
B006UG90RM|5.0|Van Halen is back and in phenomenal form. Never in a million years would I have ever imagined hearing a new VH album in 2012 with Diamond Dave. Well friends, dreams do come true. I am absolutely floored by this recording. I have heard it at least 50 times and it gets better with every listen. Does ADKOT come close to the first six? In my opinion it does. Please do yourself a favor and go buy this recording now.  Stay Frosty People!
B0021L8UQ2|4.0|I like this movie.  Its not scary, but its just an entertaining, \\"I don't have to think\\" movie.  And the Vera girl is wayyyy hot!<br /><br />I would nominate the scene in the kitchen with Vera and her husband as an all time great scene.

B00526ZKYS|4.0|Having the benefit of reading Delirium after the massive hype died down, I got the chance to read this story without that influence hanging over my shoulder. So reading it with fresh eyes, I found that I really enjoyed Delirium.<br /><br />It didn't invoke the crazed fangirl in me, but Delirium took an interesting look at a society that views love as a disease.<br /><br />That aspect of the novel really threw me at first. I mean, who would ever really want to remove the capability to love others because they thought it was unhealthy and the root of all evil?! But, as I kept reading, I understood more and more that making people stop loving was a surface issue and the real problems ran much deeper than that. I really liked that about Delirium - it teases with you with an idea then panned out and shows you the huge scope of what's really going on.<br /><br />Character Relationships: Lena and Alex. Alex and Lena. Being completely honest, I didn't get them at first. Lena is brainwashed to believe and trust that love is dangerous, and Alex is this rebel who she meets at a party. She's intrigued by him, and I understand the attraction, but I don't see it on his side.<br /><br />Why does he like her? I never really got a sense of why he's attracted to Lena. This could definitely just be me, though. Maybe it's because the story is told from only Lena's perspective and she probably doesn't understand why Alex loves her either.<br /><br />The world that Oliver builds in Delirium is one I want to read more about, like the town Lena lives in, her sister and the Wild. I need to find out more because it's killing me. Also, you know, a certain CLIFFHANGER ending might also be contributing to my reading panic.<br /><br />One other note: the friendship between Lena and hanna was so beautiful (and caught me more off guard then Alex/Lena). I loved their very realistic relationship, and I hope we see more from Hana in Pandemonium (out February 28!).<br /><br />OVERALL:<br /><br />Delirium is an interesting story with well-developed characters and a killer cliffhanger. I definitely want to read more from Oliver, and I'm anxiously waiting for Pandemonium to answer some serious questions. Although this book didn't excite me like some of my other favorite dystopians, Delirium is a strong read with a solid foundation.<br /><br />(Review originally posted at ReadBreatheRelax.com)ger.

0060899220|4.0|If you've seen Anthony Bourdain's show No Reservations, you'll instantly recognize his style. It's sort of a \\"I'll say exactly what I think\\" attitude that often comes across as witty, funny, and honest, yet sometimes it comes across as brash, arrogant, and obnoxious. Either way, it's difficult to deny that Bourdain is a great writer.  I first heard Kitchen Confidential described as sort of an expose on the restaurant industry, but that's hardly an accurate description. Sure, it describes why ordering a well-done steak will get you the worst piece of meat they have, why restuarants might recycle untouched bread baskets, and why chefs often try to push older product to customers, but this is a pretty small section of the book (less than 15 pages). Frankly, I found none of these things either shocking or disturbing.  The book is mostly about the experience of a professional kitchen. Bourdain talks about getting into the business, the characters therein, and stories that he has accumulated over the years. Many of these stories were both interesting and genuinely hilarious, however, there were definitely sections I found a bit boring. Bourdain makes it clear that this book was written mostly for his fellow cooks, and I can imagine that they (or anybody else in the restaurant business) would get much more out of it than I did.  Overall, I found that the book is taken best in small doses. It's entertaining enough to plow through in two or three days, but too much of Bourdain at once leaves a bad impression, like working with the guy must be nightmarish experience. Whether or not that's true, Kitchen Confidential is still a pretty good book.

B004LROUNG|2.0|I have been a huge fan of Grishams' work.  I normally am singing his praises.  His books have been an escape from the insanity of everyday life, but this book was not worthy of him.  I feel cheated and am not sure if I will purchase another book of his.  Best bet, borrow his next one from the library and then you won't be out the $$$!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|addicting!!! I love it! u get points so fast so unlocking the next games isn't too difficult. some are super easy and some are more difficult so there is a good blend. I recommend downloading this game for everyone
B004O3YGMC|4.0|Works great. Able to control and activate my PC over the web. Great for checking up on big dowloads or imports. Only issue came in a driver compatibility error with my GTX550 GPU which gave me a black screen. There's a registry fix in their Faq's, it was just a hastle to take care of. Otherwise, fantastic!
