B000HWZ4CA|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the top five movies of all time.  The acting is superb and the movie keeps you interested through out.  Gary Cooper is brilliant, but the actress who plays Mother York, Margaret Wycherly, steals the show.  I have seen this movie several times in my lifetime and I become deeply engrossed everytime I watch it.  This is one of the best bargains ($10.99) you will ever find for a DVD.  The second DVD, Sergeant York: An American Hero is also outstanding as well.  This is definitely a must see movie.  They definitely don't make movies like tis one in this day and age.

0684800713|4.0|\\"The Sun Also Rises\\" was required reading when I was in school (oh so many years ago) but little of the book stayed with me. On my recent second reading I now recall why this book is considered to be one of the greats.<br /><br />Hemingway is a master story teller and this book includes some of the best character interaction I have ever read. The locations and plots lines are well handled, as are the insites into the issues and morals of post WWI Europe. What I forgot was how much I disliked almost all of the characters in the story. Every last one is shallow, weak, and flawed in major ways. Hemingway did a great job showing us the human side of his characters and still kept the book interesting.<br /><br />Truely a master work of fiction - Highly recommended!
0375826726|4.0|I'll admit, the Rider Trilogy (supposed Trilogy), should be a little juvenile for my taste, but I got emotionally invested in the world and people that Paolini has created. For those that thought this book was the end to the trilogy, it's not. In the afterward he tells you he had too much material to wrap it up in three and I tend to slightly disagree with him there. Brisingr is long, but still engaging in parts, but it feels like he might've been stretching this one for the sake of extra paychecks. We'll see.
0380730405|5.0|One of my most favorite books ever.  You must remember when it was written and the period it is set in when reading.  From other reviews I see some have become bored and impatient with the book which is a shame.  If you take the time to understand the characters, including Manderley, you may find more to consider than it seems.
B001E7OO2I|3.0|I was thinking this would be a breakout album for JL, but it seems steps backwards in this album. I usually love his music, but over the first couple of plays on this one, I am not impressed. Nothing stands out as listenable.
B00092ZAO0|5.0|I've seen the Met version and EuroArts version, too, and while all three of these DVDs offer a different view, this is the one I actually sit down and watch again and again.  It's also the one on my mp3.    If you've been inundated with the popular culture versions and other parodies of Wagner's ring, as most mature US viewers have been, this production will reset all your expectations and anticipations from the Bugs Bunny and Anna Russell flavor to the Adult/Growed Up kind.  All the cliches that trigger the satires are gone.    The music is unsurpassed in the others.  The Met version seems to me to have too many scenes where the orchestra intrudes on the pacing of the voices; this version just has both overwhelming you at the proper moments, with no seam between the two that even makes you notice instrument and voice are not being used together to tell the story.    The production on stage has human 'gods', without fake armor or other such silly appurtenances.  The Rhinemaidens are obviously Sirens and not some silly sprites on a Sponge-Bob Square-Pants set.  Valhalla is an imposing structure with both 'classical' decoration and commercial concrete structures visible.    The lack of tinny flash is reflected in the earth tones and subdues lighting.  No over-elaboration, just what is needed.    No fairy story pretense, just the facts. A Hamlet in music instead of a Disney Narnia musical.
B001H5X7KC|3.0|Rarely do I watch movies on the big screen when they first come out. My 55\\" HDTV, Sony Home Theatre system, and Blu-ray DVD player, provide a much more enjoyable experience than going to the theatre and paying an arm and a leg to sit in stained sticky seats. Although I currently get most of my movies from a popular online rental service, I will buy the ones I enjoy and/or think I'll watch more than once.    Well, after all the hype about Tropic Thunder I came close to purchasing this movie sight unseen. It looked hysterical in the previews and friends who saw it said it was hilarious. Boy am I glad that I got it as a rental first because it was not at all what I expected and to tell you the truth I was kind of disappointed in it. From the reviews, and from what people had said about the movie, I expected it to be much funnier and less serious than it turned out to be. I think I was expecting \\"Stripes\\" 2008 and I was shocked when I didn't even chuckle during the first half hour. In fact the first seen was so disgusting that I almost turned the movie off. The reproduction of gore for accuracy, as in Private Ryan, is bearable but the reproduction of war-related gore in an attempt at humor is completely unnecessary and in this case disgusting.    So, I thought \\"it's a slow starter\\" but it never did get what I consider truly funny. In addition, I must've missed the \\"slap-stick\\" that other reviewers have mentioned. Finally, to compare it to Blazing Saddles is so much of a stretch it's unbelievable. Tropic Thunder is not in any way similar to the afforementioned gut-busting Mel Brooks film. To me, I would classify it more as an action film with a dab of humor thrown into the mix. I expected a lot more from what I'd heard and from Ben Stiller.    On the other hand, the Blu-Ray version of this film is unbelievable. The Blu-ray format really lends itself to the many hues of jungle scenery.

B001F7MSFW|4.0|Fun movie, actually a lot better than Hellboy I, but even though it is a mix of X-men (the better ones ie: 1 and 3), Jean-Pierre Jeunet's City of Lost Children, and Men in Black II, it is actually a lot better than a bad movie like Men in Black II.  There is a point in the movie where you wonder \\"oh no, this is becoming like Men in Black II\\", but luckily, the movie gets past that point unscathed (ie: the turn the encounter with the tree god into a more humanistic story, as opposed to \\"let's shoot up all 'dem big things!\\".  As with Toro's previous movie (the sub-par Pan's Labyrinth), his being influenced by Jean-Pierre Jeunet / Marc Caro work is well-evidenced. The kid at the beginning was a bit corny, but I suppose fits into the comic book motif.  There is also some nice martial arts-style acrobatics in the movie.  I think what probably makes the movie work nicely is the dark Drow elf prince (and also his sister), they work very well as characters.  Also Hellboy II should make an excellent companion to any Hellboy III (considering where the story was going.

B001EYGOG0|4.0|A delightful package of holiday music. To my surprise the theme music from Loretta Young's CHRISTMAS EVE by Johnny Mandel now has lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman. To me it is the highlight of the album.  A lush arrangement of ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS IS YOU.  CHRISTMAS TIME IS HERE from A CHARLIE BROWN CHRISTMAS is the best version other than the original soundtrack recording.   HAVE YOURSELF A MERRY LITTLE CHRISTMAS is beautifully done but whenever I hear this song memory takes me back to the TV film THE EXECUTION OF PRIVATE SLOVIK. Sinatra's version of this played over the execution preparations and deed. So it bothers me.  When Doris Day sings it I have no problem.  Go figure.   O CHRISTMAS TREE with a quartet is another highlight.    The swing numbers make up most of the album. I don't really care for these songs performed that way but they are well done.   Good job.
B001ACH4DS|4.0|I own this album and really like it. Puts me more in the mood for a great day by the pool or summer road trip versus enjoying the snow today; however, it is a great first album and \\"true\\" to the David Cook everyone got to know on American Idol...there were no surprises...just good old fashion rock and roll. If you like Daughtry, Nickelback, etc. you would like this album.
0375826726|4.0|Eragon and Eldest have seen mixed reviews. People praise them for being good and well-written stories, but the story model bears a striking resemblance to, say, Star Wars or Lord of the Rings. But despite that, both books manage to be great fun to read and remain engaging despite the obvious sources of inspiration. Brisingr fares about the same as Eldest; Paolini still needs to learn how to not pointlessly ramble on about stuff we don't care about, but the book is still a good read for anyone who liked the other two.<br /><br />(WARNING: some minor spoilers are in the following paragraph) Brisingr's story continues right where Eldest left off with Eragon and his brother Roran about to attack the Ra'zac at their lair. After an epic battle (one of the absolute best scenes in the entire series in my opinion), Eragon decides to stay behind for a little while to take care of some business. Then we wait for possibly 100 pages for the story to take off. It's strange, because by the end of the book you feel like only a few major events have occurred. This is really because Paolini just rambles on and on too much about random things about the fantasy world the story is set in. In a fourth book I would hope for more events and less description or pointless conversation.<br /><br />So to keep it not-too-long, Brisingr is a great book if you liked Eldest, if not then do yourself a favor and leave it alone. As a fan of the series, I heavily enjoyed the book despite the long rambling. If you want to read this book then you definitely need to read the other two in the series to get the full idea of the story as well.
0810979772|3.0|Take the subtitle of this book seriously: It is mostly a do-it-yourself book rather than funny stories like the ones in [[ASIN:0810993139 Diary of a Wimpy Kid]] and [[ASIN:0810994739 Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules (Diary of a Wimpy Kid)]]. Sixteen pages of colored cartoons are the only funny stories in the book that are similar to the earlier two books. Some funny illustrations surround the diary's questions. The idea is to create a journal that a youngster will look back on some day, a sort of written time capsule.<br /><br />If you insist on buying this, you've been warned. It's not what you think it is . . . and it's not a very good value.<br /><br />When I was 9-12 years old, that was the last thing I would have wanted.  As an adult, I'm always annoyed by \\"books\\" that mostly blank pages of lined paper (with little cartoons in one corner). I can buy lined paper much cheaper in other forms.<br /><br />With those warnings in mind, some youngsters will be glad if they answer some of these questions and later look back on what they wrote. I would warn those who think about doing that not to write anything that they wouldn't want parents, siblings, and friends to see at the moment. Some of the questions are ripe for creating vast embarrassment for a youngster.<br /><br />The book starts off in confusing fashion on a page entitled \\"What're you gonna do with this thing?\\" At the bottom, it says \\"Whatever you do, just make sure you don't write down your 'feelings' in here. Because one thing's for sure: This is NOT a diary.\\"<br /><br />Contrary to that statement is the book's title: Diary of a Wimpy Kid. In addition, less than halfway through the book there's a section preceding all those pages of lined paper that says \\"What's Your Story?\\" which contains these directions:<br /><br />\\"Use the rest of the book to keep a daily journal, write a novel, draw comic strips, or tell your life story.\\"<br /><br />Those directions immediately follow a page that says: \\"Diary of a _____\\"<br /><br />Is a diary by another name any less a diary?<br /><br />The fill-in-the-blank parts of the book contain lots of questions designed to elicit current likes and dislikes (video games, songs, books, movies, animals, colors, and houses), your predictions for the future, and potentially embarrassing facts. There is also a lot of emphasis on creating comic strips by providing unfinished panels to be completed and then followed by empty panels. You also have a chance to draw some maps as well. More fun is to describe things that you would like to do in the future (such as the first laws you would pass as president).y?

B001BKXUOQ|4.0|After being a fan of slipknot since the 7th grade after discovering that such a crazy band existed of psychopathic mask wearing maniacs, I've listened to every slipknot album with the exception of 9.0 live, seen them live, and have their disasterpieces dvd. I have to say that after the raw animalistic sound of their debut album, their more streamlined sophmore album, and their more mature and experimental 3rd album, I was not too sure how their 4th studio album would sound, and after giving it a listen, I have to say it brought a smile to my face. The album is like a sample platter of each of their previous albums, songs sounding very heavy, some more streamlined, and some soft, there are also some more experimental songs on here that are very soft, and others very different. All in all, if you can respect an artist for maturing, this album is worth the listn if you are truly a fan of slipknots music.

B001KQKC0Q|3.0|The album isn't bad, but for hardcore Nickelback fans like myself, this record lacks the true Alternative Rock sound that the band was once known for. The gang seems to take a massive step towards the Adult Contemporary genre with this latest release titled Black Horse. It seems like this is becoming a popular trend among many bands that began with a much harder sound on previous albums. I don't know if this is a result of simply \\"growing up\\"... or if the money is better in the more broad Pop/AC category.
B000GLDOXS|5.0|Mel Gibson constructs fantasy from history by neglect rather than active propaganda.  This story of a turning point in the Vietnam experience for America is good for what it does.  However, Mr. Gibson failed in that he ended the tale too soon, and gave it a happier ending than the circumstances of Ia Drang would demand of a historian.  He was honest to the character he portrays.  the shortcoming is that there is more, and to be honest the action that followed that of \\"LZ XRay\\" must also be told.  That done, the viewer could see the strength of the American spirit and better understand the weaknesses that made this war different.  It is worth seeing.  It is also worth an effort to examine the full story from other sources in order to understand that battle fully.  I commend Mr. Gibson for a willingness to attempt this kind of material at this time in our history, lest we be forgotten.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|The range and change in Beatles music is mirrored in the lives of this highly charged adult fantasy that could have been real for someone.  The singing is not always equal to the source, but fits the plot.  Like many recent musical defined stories, this one can strain the intent of the composer/performer.  That given, the characters are honest in their performances and their growth through time is adequately portrayed.  This along with so many other \\"Baby Boomer Retros\\" tries hard to define that era for it's own as well as those born long after the 60's and 70's became history.  I welcome the effort and admire the compositions.  This is an older teen movie, or for adults...not for those who still believe in Santa Clause.  It takes a bit of effort to follow and understand, so not for casual observers looking for the quick nude scenes or risque dialogue.
B00005JKDR|5.0|Very few movies appeal equally to kids and adults alike, but this movie is definitely in that very elite class.

B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|Time is the Doctor's enemy in the Children in Need special \\"Time Crash\\" where the 10th Doctor (David Tennat) meets himself in his Fifth incarnation (Peter Davison)as the TARDIS from their respective eras collide. That's just the tip of the iceberg so to speak as we also get to voyage on the Titanic a spacecraft named after Earth's luxury liner (although the designers of the spacecraft clearly had no clue as to what really happened to the REAL Titanic)and the Doctor has to stop the ship from being destroyed in the 2007 Christmas Special featuring Kylie Minogue. The Doctor also gets a new companion is an old one--Donna (Catherine Tate) returns after her brief tenure with the Doctor from the previous year.<br /><br />The 4th series of \\"Doctor Who\\" continued to introduce challenging stories such as the two part episode \\"Silence in the Library\\" and \\"Forest of the Dead\\" where the Doctor meets someone from HIS future that he hasn't met yet and while there were a few weak ones in the mix, the best episodes from the fourth series more than held up when compared to previous ones. While I like Russell T. Davies' scripts, I still find the best ones are usually penned by his successor as producer Stephen Moffat.<br /><br />As with previous sets we get edited versions of \\"Doctor Who: Confidential\\", deleted scenes, commentary  tracks with a variety of cast/crew on each episode. We also get two installments of \\"David Tennant's Video Diary\\" and a nice tribute to the late actor William Attfield who originally appeared as Donna's grandfather but passed away after the shooting of \\"Partners in Crime\\". His scenes were reshot with Bernard Crippins but we get Attfield's deleted scenes as a tribute to the actor. \\"The Journey So Far\\" allows cast and crew to comment on the fourth season and some of their favorite moments and we also get the episode teasers, teasers for \\"Torchwood: Series 2\\", \\"Priveal\\" and \\"The Sarah Jane Adventures\\". As with the previous seasons we get a booklet that gives us credits/extras for each episode. The show looks extremely good in its DVD presentation.<br /><br />I personally thought this was a better seaosn than the third and thought Catherine Tate was a nice contrast to the previous performers on the show. I also applaud Davies for casting a full figured woman vs. a skinny model for the part of the companion during the fourth season. Highly recommended.s for each episode.

031606792X|4.0|I was so hesistant to read this book based on some of the negative reviews. However, while at the book store, I spoke to another Twilight Saga reader and she said, \\"ignore the reviews and instead read the book and judge for yourself.\\"  So that is what I did and the book definitely exceeded my expectations.

B000AJJNPY|3.0|This is the first Sigur Ros album I bought and I can personally attest it is a good album. There is Hoppipolla, a truly fine song and the closest thing to a hit song the Icelandic band ever had (it is very familiar as it has appeared on tv shows, etc.). The rest is basically ambiance music, sad but haunting. If you are feeling depressed because your longtime girlfriend has left you, listening to this record on a rainy day while commiserating on your fate seems like a natural thing to do.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I cannot say or add much that hasn't already been added.  However the very poor reviews are rather disturbing.  Not because it's an opposing opinion to mine, but because these opinions seem to have about as much thought behind them as what ultimately is symbolized as the central theme of this film.  A society that has lost the ability to actually think & is totally absorbed in consumerism, a lack of insight, & essentially have become just ID's, seeking pleasure without any effort..  Kids are bored by a film of this depth because they are bombarded with nonsensical, & consumer garbage 24/7, while Mom & dad do whatever, or work 2 jobs.  Truly jaded are they & devoid of depth.. A sad situation indeed.  So I will go on to say, if you're attention span is that of a spoiled, A.D.D child, then this film will not be for you.  However if you actually appreciate art, & would like to see an entirely new spin on a very familiar theme, then this is a must.

0393061310|5.0|In the first half of the book Diamond presents his thesis why certain continents are richer than other continents. This is fascinating reading as long as Diamond describes pre-historic times. His arguments are the strongest I have seen so far. Diamond is much less convincing when he moves to historic times and tries to explain differential performance within a given continent. The second half of the book describe individual continents and is quite tedious, but there is no need to read this section unless you have special interests in a particular region.<br /><br />The first half or the book is so interesting and thoughtful so it is a must read.<br /><br />Btw, do not buy the DVD with Diamond, it is quite dull. The book is much better.
B00005JPCF|2.0|Musically, this isn't for kids.  That should have been figured out by everyone right away.  Many of the songs (many which are sexually suggestive) are 20 to 40 years old anyway.  The kind of music that we use to listen to when we were kids.  But, to me, I'd rather our kids listen to sexy songs instead of today's angry songs.<br /><br />And one moment in the film Mumbles is being singled out as if something is wrong with him because he's different.  This could have been a discussion similar to telling a child that he's wrong for being gay. Which has got to be the hardest thing for any naturally sexually healthy parent to have to do.<br /><br />But, the entertainment of this musical film changes when it suddenly becomes a message about our endangered environment.  We're taking away all the fish so the penguins are having a harder time to survive.  In my opinion, the best way to reduce the amount of starving penguins in this world is to hunt them too.  I wouldn't mind trying a penguin sandwich, or try penguin soup.  And how would we prepare a meal with a penguin?  Should it be broiled, boiled, or fried?  Or steamed penguin meat with broccoli on rice?  How about breaded and fried, and dipped in Ranch dressing?  I wonder how penguin meat would be on a cracker with cheese. Umm, how about penguin enchiladas?  I'd be happy to try anything on my plate if it would help to balance our ecology.<br /><br />\\"I'd like to have one McPenguin burger with fries and a coke, please.\\"  Maybe we can give the fish a break and try eating more penguin.  Could that help the environment?

0316017922|3.0|I am a Gladwell fan and I think he will surface as one of the great thinkers of our age. I read this book after conducting hundreds of interviews of successful executives for a software company I run. I would disagree that success can be boiled down to any dials that can be screened or affected. If there were those factors, I don't know that they would be limited to luck, hard work, who your parents are, and when/where you were born as Outliers presents. However, I think that Gladwell, in his attempt to be controversial, points out some interesting contributors to success that are fresh--10,000 hours makes one proficient at a craft, your \\"generation\\" and its unique dynamic thus providing a foundation for success, and the relative importance of practical intelligence over general knowledge. He wants us to give up on the idea that the size of your brain sets you up for success.    HIs evidence is interesting (and gladwellianly anecdotal). I like the book. I don't think we have the underlying code for intelligence figured out now. Why? At the end of the day, success is a complicated algorithm or ... even better, an index of experiences, relationships, education, talent, decisions, circumstance, perspective and so on. Great book--you need to read it. Just don't give up on yourself if you were born in the wrong generation, have an IQ that is too high or have only worked 8,000 hours.     :0)

B0000A5BSZ|5.0|Sergio Leone is unique in his field, and particularly in the western genre. He was in his fourth year of spaghetti western, let's say in full swing, in this film. You know it is Sergio Leone by several elements that do not tell a lie. The music always has the same texture, the same taste, the same sonorities, with the eternal harmonica. Then the landscape, the sunshine, the light, the vegetation and of course practically no fauna, and in this one, not even a snake. Hardly a few horses, a couple of partridges, or whatever, and a pair of chickens. Nothing to brag about. Sergio Leone is concentrating anyway on the human animal and there the menagerie is by far diverse and grotesque enough. Then the economy of the dialogue is also typical because Sergio Leone never uses one word too many when he can do without any word at all. The silences are long and so meaningful that you must be blind not to hear the resounding sense of that emptiness. Then the few words that are actually pronounced become so powerful in their scarcity and rarity that you definitely have to be deaf not to see the subtlety of that sound track. Those are the most significant traits of Sergio Leone's style. And this film is the acme of that style. The plot itself innovates in the subject, that is to say in who the thieves are. In this case some railroad contractor who wants to get rid of some settler who has bought a big chunk of land on the very way where the railroad has to go and who has a contract that allows the railroad to go through for nothing if the station is built before the train can come. You can then imagine the intricacies of the action between several gangs and tribes and bands of good and bad men, bad and good beings, and all the nuances, hues and shades in between. The best detail of course comes at the end when the main bad guy realizes who the one who has just destroyed him is. Don't expect me to tell you. You have to watch the film till the very last five minutes to finally understand. Enjoy it.

Merry Christmas reached #3 on the U.S. Billboard 200 charts, #4 on the U.S. R & B charts and has since gone 5X Platinum. Only one song charted in the United States. Overall you get a mixed batch of classical Christmas songs and a few new one like; All I Want for Christmas is You and Miss You Most (At Christmas Time).  I like listening to Mariah and the only thing I did not like about this CD; the last song is way too long. She could of have shaved off a minute or two. Merry Christmas by Mariah Carey gets a B-.

B000WCN8SC|1.0|I'm a Doors fan and I have bought all these albums at least 4 times before (LP, cassette, \\"regular\\" CD, then CD edition with bonus tracks) each, so the only reason why I bought this box set is the 5.1 surround sound mix. By any metric imaginable, these are definitely the worst 5.1 mixes I have ever encountered. Just about everything is dumped on the central channel; one can occasionally hear a guitar solo or keyboards on the surround channels, and that's about it. You might as well disconnect the subwoofer because no signal is sent to that channel. Save your money and wait for the next dvd-audio edition.
B001BKRK8S|5.0|As a blue blooded, \\"Mowtown\\" girl, 39 years old for several years now, this my new workout Album - no doubt.  I was blown away by our girl Donna Summer who turns songs to gold just by her touch.  Just buy it and dance your tush off!
B000005H7D|5.0|This is a classic jazz recording without a doubt in my mind. If anyone gave this a bad review they're clearly not listening hard enough, because this is the only album that I really dug. Perhaps it was his choice of sidemen: Lee Morgan on trumpet, Curtis Fuller on trombone, Kenny Drew on piano, Paul Chambers on bass, and Philly Joe Jones on drums, I'm not sure, but all I know is this album is the most swinging in Coltrane's discography, although \\"Giant Steps\\" was pretty good as well, but I always enjoyed hearing Coltrane with other horn players. His tone on this record was by far the best it ever sounded.<br /><br />Anyone interested in hearing Coltrane, then pick this album up first! You won't be sorry.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|The re-mastered episodes are incredible for the vivid colors and clarity. The \\"table of contents\\" are in the form of Translucent plastic cards that will almost certainly get lost some day and are hard to read. They also didn't number the episodes.
B000UR9QGW|2.0|I did a blind buy on the Blue ray version, and its a good thing that I'm a fan of the movie (but then who else would buy this in any format) because the DNR makes the faces smooth and washes out most of the detail, its so clean it looks unnatural. This should be a $10 catalog buy.
B0015519VS|2.0|I think my cd has a defect,at the end of the last song(Here I Stand)there is a 2 minute continuance,but it is silent,then there is another song.I am not sure if this is purposeful & on all of the cds or if this is a defect.  Other than this flaw,I have enjoyed my cd.   Thank you
B000W7JWUA|5.0|SETTLERS is a remarkably entertaining game for adults and older kids. We have spent many enjoyable hours playing with our twenty and thirty-somethings. Settlers combines skill (negotiating and strategy) and luck (dice) to create a fun event which will last a couple of hours, at least!<br /><br />The object of the game is to be the first to earn ten points by building roads, villages, and cities. This is done by strategically accumulating resources by draw or by trading. There is considerable brain power exerted by the craftiest player, energized, no doubt, by M&M's or popcorn (optional).<br /><br />The exapansion pack is necessary for five or more players.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Since the first spotlighted reviewer wrote exactly what I had to say, I have to re-think \\"Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.\\" What is there new to say?<br /><br />I adore Harrison Ford. Has he won that special Oscar yet? He should (but not for this role). Let's get right on to Karen Allen. \\"Marian, you're going to drive off the cliff.\\" \\"Trust me, Indie. I know what I'm doing,\\" and she does. She drives right onto a tree over the river and the car is gently delivered into the water. Wow! How is this possible? Because she is older and better? Because this is an Indiana Jones movie and the characters can do darn well anything they set their minds to doing. Then they skee-daddle right over a huge waterfall in that car. No problem. No broken bones. No concussions. Everyone lands a foot from their sitting place in the car and hops right back in. Then they do it again two more times over two more waterfalls.<br /><br />But my favorite action scene is when Indie and is-his-name-Mutt-or-Mudd? are riding the motorcycle through campus, trying to escape mad Russians representative of the Three Stooges minus one. Indie is pulled off the bike right through that little car window. After he wrestles around with the Stooge a bit, he slips right out that window onto the motorcycle again! Holy Moly! At his age he's that agile?<br /><br />One other thing that seriously bothered me was Indie opening the cocoons and allowing the folks inside to puff--go up in dust! No posterity! You'd think an archaeologist would know better.<br /><br />I do have a favorite scene: At the end when he and Marian kiss, it's such an old geezer kiss. Come on, Lucas and Spielberg, even as geezers we can still pucker out a wet one.<br /><br />I dozed off during this movie. I dozed during an Indiana Jones movie! What's wrong with the world? And that kid? Please don't make him the next \\"Indie\\" He doesn't have IT!
B0013ND30M|5.0|As wonderful and magical as it was the first time I saw it with my big sister, feeling very grown up and traveling to NYC to see this fantastic movie.
B001C46P2A|2.0|This could easily have been three movies. A cattle baron wants the only spread left that isn't his.  Hire some bad guys to kill the owner and run off the cattle and you have Story one.     On the cattle drive the stars (Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman) fall in love.  Will it last?  Story two.    World War II stikes Darwin. The Japanese bomb and strafe.  Who will survive?  Story three.    The three stories are uncomfortably linked together by an aborigine grandfather and a mixed race child.    Besides wondering if it would ever end, my other question is how someone can turn a cattle drive and a war into a chick flick.    Video is good.  Plot is plodding. Michener without the magic.
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I loved the series and I have all of them on DVD and still watch them quite often, so I was very excited when I saw the movie was coming out.  I rushed to get the DVD and I will watch it when I want to have a day of watching Sex and the City, the series and the movie.  I hope they make another movie to follow this one.
0316066524|5.0|In any case, that's what I tell people who ask me which book is my favorite: this happens more often than you'd think, as I work in a bookstore.  I first read Infinite Jest in the middle of high school: it was assigned reading for one of my classes [an optional class, but I'd thought the book was interesting, and the teacher who taught that class had given me a hearty recommendation]. I read it during every waking moment I could, straight through, for three weeks: flipping back and forth between footnotes and endnotes, starving, wanting more, no matter what the cost, really. Yes ... I, unlike many people here, read Infinite Jest straight through, pretty much without taking a breather. [I continued going to classes, and I did between 5 and 10 minutes of homework a night. And I ate, very, very quickly.] And what this book gives you ... DFW uses the omniscient narrator throughout the story to guide you through its' different tones, from sadness to happiness and back again. The book is extremely funny. One part in particular [the Eschaton part] had me laughing nearly the entire time. The book has countless characters and none of them vfeel contrived or flat in any way: they're all fleshed out, somehow, ancillary scene stacking on top of each other, everything described so perfectly it makes your eyes pop out of your head and your mind revolt [or try to pretend to be like him]. The things DFW can do with a sentence are incredible. Perhaps part of what made this book resonate so strongly to me is that I, at the time I was reading it, was a tennis player in high school who has been ... thinking about philosophical doggerel most of my life. Everything seemed so ... relatable. It was as though the book was written for me and me alone, and after I read it once I started flipping through to odd places and read from there. I can pick up the story thread from pretty much any place in the book, now, and know where I am. The world is so consistent and brilliantly written, and thecharacters express the depths of emotion, and the things that happen aren't just things oddly thrown into the world to make his characters do stuff: they're important, they all show things about the characters that they're in. The book is over a thousand pages, and every sentence feels important.  This review is far worse than the book. For a while I've refrained from posting a review because it would have such a lack of eloquence ... I can't really think straight when it comes to this book. I've owned it for four years, and ordered another copy just so that I could loan the first out to people [as I'd been loaning the first copy out to people anyways, but it wasn't getting back to me]. The narrator here is alive: and he is showing you. He is showing you the world, and all you have to do is listen for a while.  From DFW's oft-quoted Kenyon College commencement speech:  'There are these two young fish swimming along and they happen to meet an older fish swimming the other way, who nods at them and says \\"Morning, boys. How's the water?\\" And the two young fish swim on for a bit, and then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes \\"What the hell is water?\\"'  This book tells you what water is.
0380977273|5.0|I have read this book before but wanted a new copy.  The book came quickly and was as advertised.  This book is a quick read and is enjoyable.  I recomend it to any one who likes fanasty/science fiction.  Also gives an idea of what a small town in the midwest was like in the 1920s.
B000NA28I4|5.0|I enjoyed the moive the first time I saw it and have always wanted to include it with my collection of moives. I could just watch over and over again. It is a motive that caught my attention and didn't want to move for fear of missing something.
B001CDLATE|1.0|Beware of the small print.   I read the reviews, read the technical specs regarding the scanning sample rates and was blinded by the hype.  Went out and paid for it to be delivered 9000 miles to me.  Put it in my region A PS3, sat down with great expectations and was presented with a message that imformed me that the DRM region was not compatable with my player. First time ever this has happened to me.  Now hunting for a Region A player and can now say to all - \\"read the fine print\\" with regards to region playability.  Upon actually getting to experince the disc I will revise my rating accordingly.

B0014DZ2VO|5.0|I have to admit, I was one of those Bond fans who thought that Daniel Craig would not make a great Bond. He isn't what I would call \\"suave\\", but is more in your face \\"masculine, rough and brawny\\".  I will admit that I was wrong about Craig and admitted as much when I saw Casino Royale. Daniel Craig is the perfect Bond. He has a strong sense of duty and isn't afraid to get dirty or to get hurt (his face is often the first thing to be injured). He isn't what I would consider \\"a pretty boy\\", like previous Bonds, but a seemingly authentic one (although he still manages to get out of some very hairy situations throughout the movie). And while there may have been some stuff lacking from the storyline, the action and excitement if the movie more than made up for it.     007 is out for revenge. He has dedicated himself to finding and killing those responsible for Vespa's (his love interest in the last movie) death. Killing people at every turn, Agent 007 is determined to discover who is behind the organization that even his Intelligence Agency has no knowledge of. Meanwhile, Camille, a beautiful and fearless Bond girl is trying to exact her own revenge against the Military Dictator of Bolivia, who killed her family. While the two appear to have similar interests (exacting revenge), the love doesn't necessarily spark between them, but a growing appreciation and need to assist each other. After all, they understand what makes each tick and find that working together is better than working apart. Both soon realize that the President of Bolivia is working hand-in-hand with Dominic Green, a man who would like to sale a very important commodity (water) to the Bolivians once he has effectively stolen the water supply. While it would appear Bond has gone rouge, with no agency resources, he is still trying to solve the problem of who is trying to kill M and how have they managed to infiltrate their very secret organization.     What made this movie a hit? You have double dealing agents, corrupt American Intelligence agents, beautiful women, action and adventure, a bad guy, not to mention a diabolical plot to \\"take over the world\\".  Would I recommend it? Absolutely. And while Daniel Craig is not Pierce Brosnan, Timothy Dalton, Sean Connery or Roger Moore, I think he is better. I definitely look forward to seeing what happens with Bond in the future. Now that his efforts to exact revenge to those responsible for his lover's death has been completed, what danger will he get into next?
1595141979|5.0|This book was by far the best in the series! I found that the previous two books were just okay - a good read, but a bit slow and boring - but the third, Shadow Kiss blew my mind! I loved it. I literally felt like I was inside the book. I fell completely in love with Dimitri, and at the end (I won't tell you what happens, because that would be sucky of me, but I will tell you that its not really a happy ending)I sat in my room and just bawled my eyes out for about thirty minutes straight. I loved the book, but hated it because it left me wanting so much more. Like a drug. I need another fix, and I don't think I can wait until september 2009 :(
031606792X|5.0|I went out the day \\"Breaking Dawn\\" was released, purchased it and placed it on my shelf of things to read, among so many others. After all, it seemed so final, the end of the Bella, Edward and Jacob saga. So, during the Thanksgiving holidays, I decided it was time to tackle it while eating turkey! And although by now, I have heard or read several reviews that echoed fan disappointment, I was determined to read it and judge it for myself. I was going to savor every minute of the tale.    I depart from other reviewers and fans because I found Breaking Dawn to be exactly what I expected and somewhat predictable, after all, what other outcome could there be? Bella and Edward were destined (although there were times that I hoped Jacob would lose the battle, but win the war); marriage and a baby were in the stars for the star crossed lovers; Jacob had to find happiness (unlike some, I didn't find his imprinting on Nessie offensive, quite the contrary since it didn't appear sexual in nature, at least not yet); Bella had to become immortal (what were the other three books leading up to?); and a battle between the good vamps and the bad vamps was destined.     Did I enjoy this novel? Yes, but...not for the same reasons that I enjoyed the first three. This one seemed more mature (Yes, I am in my late 30's but enjoyed the series), and while it tackled some very mature issues (i.e., teen marriage, teen pregnancy, etc.) it was all very tastefully done. There weren't long, graphic sex scenes, but just impressions concerning what was happening and I think most parents would appreciate that. I also think it was a nice conclusion to a very enjoyable and entertaining series. All good things must come to an end, and while sometimes I prefer not to know how it all ended, I was ok with this one. I look forward to reading other Meyer novels, and will probably start with \\"The Host\\" since it is a couple books under Breaking Dawn on my shelf to read.
0141182504|4.0|The Outsider is an interesting introduction to Existential-type thought. But don't dismiss it for that reason if that bothers you!<br /><br />This book, though short and digestible, really packs a strong punch. I found myself interested in the psyche of Mersault as he faced the three deaths which so defined his life; the death of his mother, the death of the person he murdered, and his own pending death. His cold, emotionless way of analyzing happens is really vivid and dramatic. Something about it reminds me of Brothers Karamazov, though with a decidedly more anti-social stoicic spin to it.<br /><br />You will be challenged and perhaps drawn in to this story, Camus was a really talented writer, as is evidenced by this work as well as 'The Plauge'.  I disagree with Camus' conclusions as well as the worldview he is putting forward in this book, but I can't deny its importance and I really feel that it is a compelling, well-written story that is worth reading if you are studying existentialism and/or nihilism.
0618918248|5.0|I read this book after admitting to myself that my faith had been reduced to nothing.  I was brought up in the church, and swallowed it whole from a young age.  It wasn't until later when I moved away from small town Texas that I found myself in an environment that encouraged critical thinking and a questioning attitude.    I had been thinking about my religious upbringing for some time, and how I might have been different had I been brought up in a different religious environment.  I have been questioning the effects of blind faith in our world, and how impacts me as a member of the US Armed Forces.    I am college educated, and consider myself to be a free thinker, but my critical thinking horizons have been expanded in ways that I cannot easily describe in this format.  The best thing about this book for me is that I have recommended it to as many non-believers as I have devout followers.  I have found that it has always resulted in constructive conversations, that have made it easier to discuss religion in ways that aren't typically acceptable.  It has helped to put religion in the same intellectual area as economic theory and international relations - arenas that are eligible to be analyzed and discussed from a scientific basis, rather than from blind faith.  I must admit that I haven't made any converts, but it has made my personal convictions much easier to explain in a non-hostile way, while maintaining a professional working environment.
B001AII4RM|5.0|Great 3d effects come alive in blu-ray presentation of this movie.  The tale of Beowulf is a must see for all of Northern European extraction.  Only slight flaw is some may think Angelina Jolie is not appproiate for a role in this tale, due to her liberal anti-white politics.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Just saw this on Thanksgiving Day and loved it! The storyline is wonderful and entertaining as it keeps you engaged in the movie. I thought the movie was funny in parts and sad in some areas.... Mostly though, I fell in love with the cute character of Wall-E and his sidekick, Eva!    The only reason I didn't give \\"Wall-E\\" the full \\"5 star\\" rating was that the character of Wall-E sort of reminded me a lot of the character Number 5 in the 1986 movie version of \\"Short Circuit\\".... And the human beings living on the futuristic space vessel in \\"Wall-E\\" reminded me vaguely of the way the human beings in the Matrix trilogy were dependent on robots to keep them alive.
0440242576|5.0|Don't you love when you read a book at the perfect time in your life? Thanksgiving was just a few days ago, and I always find the transition from feeling full and grateful on Thursday to crazed and stressed with Christmas shopping on Friday jarring. This year, with the economy in the toilet, I've been even more of a Scrooge, lamenting another year of increased credit card debt and whatnot.<br /><br />I'm so glad I just finished Skipping Christmas. It starts as Luther and Nora Krank are saying goodbye to their daughter Blair at the airport - she's heading to Peru for two years with the Peace Corps. Christmas won't be the same without her, and Luther, an accountant, figures out they spent $6,100 on Christmas last year, \\"the vast majority of it down the drain ... And that, of course, does not include my time, your time, the traffic, the stress, worry, bickering, ill-will, sleep loss - all the wonderful things that we pour into the holiday season.\\"<br /><br />His solution: skip Christmas and use the money to go on a Carribbean cruise for 10 days. The cruise is only three grand, so they'll actually save money on the proposition. But the plan isn't well-received by the neighbors who expect to see Frosty on the roof, friends who will miss their annual invitation to the Krank's Christmas Eve bash, the scouts who sell Christmas trees, the cops who sell calendars...it's a hoot. I laughed - hard - and even cried at the end.<br /><br />After I finished, I got up and it was snowing, and I made myself a sandwich with Thanksgiving leftovers and actually said to my husband, \\"I have the Christmas spirit!\\" (To which he replied, \\"I think I'll read that book before it goes back to the library.\\")
B00005JMJG|5.0|The reason I claim this as the best love story, ever, is because its the only one I have seen that tells the fundamental truth of love in a long term relationship.  Its not a comedy.   Using a science fiction premise and some of the most elegantly subtle special effects I have ever seen... the film presents the idea of being able to do away with our bad experiences by having them literally deleted.  Could we be happier without the heartache we have suffered? Or is that heartache rooted in our sense of loss over memories that were, once, cherished?    The film does not gloss over the hard parts... but cuts to the core of what it is to love another human being... good and bad.  The erosion of our thoughtless actions and words on each other and the idea we have of what love ought to be.    And, in the last lines of the last scene, the film offers every one of us redemption for those small sins against love which we all commit.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Well-acted drama. Enjoyed historical settings and interiors. Interesting cast of characters and superb development. At times outrageous, but nevertheless appealing, even spell-binding.    Inasmuch as I enjoy period/era dramas, I would certainly recommend this one very highly and would buy others of similar quality and interest.
B001DSNFVO|5.0|One of the few problems with vinyl coming back into prominence is that Quality Control of these new pressings is lacking at times.  I've got a re-press of a Metallica album and a Beatles re-press that on the first play had some defects that caused crackling.    Not so with this one.  This pressing was perfect straight out of the sleeve, and I was very surprised to find it was a 180 gram 'virgin' pressing at that, which helps.  Another comment is that unlike some re-presses and re-masters, this one did not have problems of low-playback volume.  The person who cut the original master lacquer of this re-press really knew what they were doing, as they knew how much to crank the mastering volume while still keeping everything a little closer to the outer edge of the record.    Buy this re-press of a fine album, but make sure you've got hi-caliber equipment to play it on.  You won't be disappointed then.  A hi-quality re-issue like this demands nothing short of hi-end audiophile-level playback equipment to fully enjoy it and preserve it.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|Excellent character development, but a bit of a downer with the protagonist being an unhappy man.

B000UBMWG4|5.0|This is a nice set - containing all the various versions of the movie.  While it is the Director's least favorite, I was pleased to see the original theatrical release including the Harrison Ford voice over.

0375826726|5.0|Brisingr is the third installment of Christopher Paolini's Inheritance Cycle and is well worth the wait.  It moves the story along very nicely and the character development is great.  Eragon is no longer a boy trying to do a man's job but is now a man doing what is needed of him.  Facing challenges and accomplishing deeds that were beyond him not too long ago.
B000OQF6N6|5.0|An excellent assortment of great tracks. The album is maybe a little short for my taste, but there are definitely some timeless songs on there.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|....is now on DVD.<br /><br />The most disheartening thing is to watch Harrison Ford amble so stiffly through the production. His responses are slow pivots. There is no tension or suspense to speak of.<br /><br />The Phantom Menace aside, this is the greatest validation for the The Beatles never having attempted a reunion.<br /><br />You can't go home again.<br /><br />(Unless you own the Ruby Red slippers, which - ironically - Spielberg does. Oh well, I guess he forgot to click his heels three times.....)
B0014XCMVM|4.0|Alanis Morisette's latest album, Flavors of Entanglement, is the best work she's put out since her second record, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie (which I prefer to her more famous debut album).  I think the work with producer Guy Sigsworth has energized Morisette's sound, taking her away from the very adult contemporary sound of her last efforts.  Overall, this album is just much more interesting and exciting (and pleasing to the ear) than anything Alanis has done lately.    That being said, I think the album loses steam after a strong opening.  The lead song, \\"Citizen of the Planet\\" pumps along with a great beat and is a great way to start the record.  The lead single, \\"Underneath,\\" comes next.  I can see why this was chosen to introduce Flavors .. it's a great song with a great, heartbeat-esque sound that carries it along.  \\"Versions of Violence\\" also sticks out for me.      The more energized songs here are the best. The slower songs kind of lose steam and drag on a bit ... but, overall, the cd is good and made me excited about Alanis Morisette once again.  Oh, and the special edition with the extra tracks is worth getting .. while I wasn't blown away by any of them, I felt you were getting more for your money with the added tracks.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|This movie was fun, different and enjoyable. I agree with all the other 5 star reviews and the reasons they gave such a high score. The reviews that were 3 stars and under where by people who are too picky and judging each minor detail rather than rating the entire movie as a whole...but each opinion is meant to be exactly such, an individual opinion. The movie Wall-E was a film I looked foward to watching for a while and was not disapppointed in anyway when I finally viewed the film. I'm glad to add this movie towards my dvd collection and will watch it over and over again!!!

015626224X|5.0|Written 75 years ago, this book is still amazingly relevant at the beginning of this century, where so many of us are under- and non- employed. This is Orwell's account of the absurd and futile work that occurs in the Paris and London of his economic day. The writing is flush with black humor and lucid irony; Orwell really shows us why he is a literary giant in this book. And, this book should also be a reminder to convince you, if you go out to a restaurant, to never ever piss off the waiter and the people who are handling your food!<br /><br />Describing his descent into poverty, beginning in Paris where all his money gets stolen, Orwell links up with a Russian emigre (Boris) who finagles a waiter job at a dive Russian eatery, with Orwell ending up in the dishroom and being the gopher for the wait staff. Orwell goes on to compellingly describe the daily routines of the working poor: six days a week, twelve hours a day, hardly time for sleep in between shifts. But he is allowed 2 liters of wine a day to somehow make it bearable.<br /><br />After two months of this hell, he heads to London, where he expects a job to be waiting for him. Doesn't happen. Orwell goes on to live with the tramps on the street, constantly moving through the fringes of London. This all occurs in the summer of 1929, just before the big financial crash - the deplorable working conditions in these cities must have been a prelude of what was to come.<br /><br />If anything, this account of the working poor of three quarters of a century ago, contrasted with the working poor of our own time, is instructive of how much has, and has not, changed for working folks like us.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1934289884 Parataxis]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1595941967 The Cloud Reckoner]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:1425751881 Extracts: A Field Guide for Iconoclasts]]

B001CTA1RK|4.0|\\"Transporter 3\\" is a high-action action film that shows off what has been the endearing traits that has caused this series to be a hit at the theater and worldwide, and that's a good thing because this episode of the series suffers from too much imitation of star Jason Statham's other films. It is as if the producers felt that they had to borrow elements of Crank and Death Race to assure that the series' fans wouldn't desert it.<br /><br />Statham again plays Frank Martin, an ex-Special Forces soldier who lives in Marseilles and works as a \\"Transporter,\\" someone who delivers merchandise in his black Audi no questions asked. This time, he is forced to deliver a package in the trunk, and a young woman sitting in the back seat. He and the woman are fitted with bracelets that will explode if either one strays too far from Martin's vehicle. Martin struggles to figure out what is going on with his forced clients, the identity of the girl, who isn't forthcoming with information, and how to remove the bracelets without killing himself and the girl.<br /><br />Because of the lack of confidence of the producers, we are forced to endure not just car chases and crashes, but way over-the-top car stunts reminiscent of the Death Race film, and the bracelet device smacks of Crank, where Statham was a hit man injected with a poison that will kill him if his heart rate drops, causing him to move at a frenetic pace for most of that film so he won't die. In this film, Statham has to perform all kinds of stunts to keep up with the vehicle so he won't blow up.<br /><br />Fortunately, the film is also keeps the martial arts action, witty script, and the endearing relationship between Martin and local detective Tarconi, played by Francois Berleand. Also, the woman, played by Natalya Rudokova, is charming enough to help overcome some of the irritation at the film's imitations.<br /><br />Transporter 3 is worth seeing, but if there is a fourth film, one hopes that the film will find ways to revitalize without cannibalizing the star's other films.the star's other films.
B00065MDS6|3.0|I like this album.  I think it is underrated. It is not a retread of the prior album like Poseiden was, nor does it point to the future.  A nice detour, but not a masterpiece.
B0015OKWL2|3.0|Righteous Kill is only the second pairing of two of cinema's greatest actors - Robert De Niro and Al Pacino. Their first on-screen collaboration, only featured them together in a couple of scenes, and left the public wanting more.<br /><br />Righteous Kill has them playing NYC detective partners who've been on the job for 30 years. A serial killer start killing criminals who gotten off on technicalities. Soon, all the evidence points to the killer being a cop. And the cop would seem to be De Niro's character, Turk, a rough-edged type who isn't above falsifying evidence to convict suspects. He's balanced out by Pacino's Rooster, a calm, soothing influence on Turk in a relationship that seems as much like a marriage as it does a professional partnership. Added to the mix are John Leguizamo and Donnie Wahlberg as younger cops investigating the killings and Carlo Gugino as a forensic specialist in a relationship with DeNiro.<br /><br />The movie works well as a police drama, less so as a mystery, although the solution of the killings does take some interesting turns. If two lesser actors were playing Turk and Rooster, the film might have been touted as asking interesting questions about the nature of friendships, partnerships, and romantic relationship amid all the stresses and strains of police work. But with De Niro and Pacino in tow, the viewer expects more, and doesn't necessarily get it with this film.<br /><br />However, the two greats still know how to pull off great performance, and know how to elicit sympathy, affection, and every other possible emotion from an audience. Righteous Kill isn't a complete misfire, but might require a third teaming of these great actors.
B001DSNELA|4.0|I've been a 007 fan ever since DR. NO premiered as the bottom half of a double drive-in bill in Kansas City.  I loved Connery; thought Lazenby's OHMSS the best of the Bond bunch; suffered through the Moore era; loathed<br />Dalton's petrified agent; tolerated Brosnan's glossy but empty 007 - and woke up during the last two minutes of CASINO ROYALE to hail Daniel Craig as THE new Bond on the block.  Naturally I snatched up the original DVD<br />release.<br /><br />So now here comes Sony with a new \\"collector's edition\\" (double-dipping, as they do so well).  There actually are some snippets that make this one worth having, notably the \\"deleted\\" which actually do add a little more to the film.  The extras are puff-pieces - but watchable.<br />Only for Bond die-hards, or folks who believe Blue Ray will replace regular DVD.
B001QB9H10|3.0|Not having seen the first two Transporter movies, I can't attest to their quality or lack thereof. This third in the series, though, is no great shakes.<br /><br />The main character, Frank Martin (Jason Statham) finds himself forced by Mr. Johnson (Robert Knepper) to drive a \\"package\\" he believes to be two red bags in the trunk of his car. He is not told the nature of the package, to whom he must deliver it, or even where. The evil Johnson tells him only that if he wanders more than 75 feet from his car, the bracelet with which he has been involuntarily decorated will explode, and he'll go up in flames with it.<br /><br />Along for the ride is Valentina (Natalya Rudakova), a freckled and red-headed Ukrainian woman with a taste for drugs and vodka, who will tell our hero nothing about how she ended up in the same predicament, or why Johnson has sent her along for the ride.<br /><br />All Martin knows is that one of his best friends drove through the exterior wall of his home, with Valentina in the car, and shortly thereafter died the gruesome death by explosion that Martin now must avoid.<br /><br />The film is full of jujitsu and other martial arts, during which Martin beats of a large collection of hoodlums, often without knowing why he's been attacked. There are also some fairly wild car chases and stunts. not to mention lovely scenery of Budapest, Hungarian and Romanian countryside roads, and bicycle stunts thrown in for good measure.<br /><br />The adults in our party were slightly amused by the film, while our teenage guest was enthusiastic. Skip it if you can.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|My granddaughter loves this movie and I finally watched it.  Enjoyed it so much I think I have watched it at least 4-5 times since then.  Amazing how they worked the Beatles songs into this movie. [[ASIN:B000ZLFALI Across the Universe (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]
B0014DZ2VO|4.0|The villian in the movie, Greene (Mathieu Amalric) wants to control the water supply of Bolivia. Bond has many people going after him in this movie, including the main villians, the Bolivian police, and the American CIA. Even M (Judi Dench) goes against Bond because he kills all the leads instead of saving them for questioning, and she revokes his passport. The CIA is not shown in good light, as it makes a friendly deal with the villians in exchange for oil. There are plenty of good action scenes, involving vehicles such as cars, boats and airplanes. The two women, Camille (Olga Kurylenko) and Strawberry Fields, look beautiful, but Bond has physical relations only with the latter. The movie has some good one-liners such as when Bond tells the villians not to hold a meeting at the opera.

B001DXS4E2|3.0|I recently purchased and watched \\"Holiday Inn\\", an entertaining film (I agree with the product description which states that it is more entertaining than the remake, \\"White Christmas\\", which I also recently purchased and watched). It is not surprising that \\"Holiday Inn\\" is entertaining given the incomparable talents of its stars, Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire.  The story is relatively fast-moving, light-hearted, and engaging.  The musical numbers are rousing, and causes one to appreciate the talents of Irving Berlin. What I had forgotten and I must admit, was not prepared for, was the \\"black-faced\\" minstrel show featuring Bing Crosby and many supporting cast members.  I had also forgotten just how painfully stereotypical was the role of \\"Mamie\\" played by African American actress, Louise Beavers.  Anyone with even remote modern sensibilities will find Ms. Beavers' role, not to mention the minstrel show, at least a little unsettling. It's too bad that the demeaning racial caricatures detract from what is otherwise a wonderfully entertaining Holiday excursion.

B001EOQWF8|1.0|My husband and I eagerly looked forward to receiving our pre-ordered copy of Wall-E from Amazon as the trailers had given us high expectations for another excellent and entertaining PIXAR product we could share with our grandchildren. Instead what we received was a computer animated forum for advancing today's political agendas! We wanted entertainment and state of the art animation for ourselves and our grandchildren, not hackneyed political whining and attempts at mind control and thought policing of the very young and impressionable people who will watch this movie.    If those of you considering buying this movie have grown steadily weary of Hollywood and the government attempting to dictate your value system through every possible venue you should definitely avoid this movie. If Disney is compelled to politicize their movies then the movies should be provided to the public at no cost as is the case with other political media.    Also, are we the only ones who recognized the plot to be interestingly close to that of the Movie \\"Silent Running\\" starring Bruce Dern? And how about the names of Bruce's little robot buddies, \\"Huey, Dewy and Louie\\" and that look a lot like Wall-E?

0441013597|1.0|\\"We're going to test you to see if you're a human or an animal, Paul,\\" says the nun.  \\"Why?\\"  \\"Because man relied too much on machines.\\"    Wait. What?  Oh, I'm paraphrasing, all right... but that's exactly the way it looks. So begins Dune, a disjointed, pretentious, poorly written piece of dreck.    I am not certain why or how this book has attained the status it has, so let's look at the pluses and go from there. Is the world of Dune fascinating? Yes. Are you going to find something quite like it anywhere else? No. The planet Arrakis is really cool. The way people live, obviously well thought out and interesting. The sandworms and spice, very unique and attractive. I also happen to love stories dealing with special children with amazing destinies -- I wanted to know about Paul's rise to importance. I'm sure most people find these elements fascinating; likewise, I wanted to read and like this story... badly.    Unfortunately, the way this story is written absolutely kills it. I felt like I was reading a first draft half of the time; the rest of the time I was reading and re-reading parts to see what the heck Herbert was trying to imply.    I read the first chapter three times, trying to see how an \\"animal\\" was like a \\"machine\\" and how this had anything to do with breeding perfect humans or relying overmuch on machines. This part never made sense and I finally decided to go on, hoping he would clarify later (he doesn't). It also started to make me hate Paul, who was a little brat who seemed to have all the answers. Oh, I am fine with above-average characters... but generally, only the ones with hearts. Think Ender from Ender's Game for the ideal.    Which brings me to the characters. They are mostly unlikable -- they are either insufferable know-it-alls or downright arrogant. I found myself only liking a few secondary and tertiary characters for the most part -- Duke Atreides, Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, and Gurney Halleck, for example. Jessica, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother, all the Harkonnens, and (most especially) Paul and Kynes made me want to punt kittens. (As an added note, it's hilarious to see this host of alien names and two major characters named Paul and Jessica.)    The prose is awkward at best and downright unreadable and purple at worst. It's all tell and no show; Herbert is constantly showing us the characters' thoughts. Generally, this is fine with me... except those thoughts end up becoming the only way you can really understand what's going on. In short, their thoughts are crutches, and the story never speaks for itself. Interspersed within are supposed \\"wise sayings\\" and unintentionally humorous \\"philosophical nuggets\\" and some really awful poetry. Yuck.    Herbert's dialogue was past poor -- a stilted, disjointed mess. Good dialogue fits together like the rungs on a ladder; Dune's dialogue is the ladder from hell, with rungs completely missing or spaced too far apart. It often seems to shift from subject to subject at random and has little or no connection to what previous speakers said. For example: Yueh speaks to Jessica for a paragraph about the wonders of spice. Then Jessica breaks in and says, \\"I think our house should go renegade.\\" Huh? On the positive side, at least the dialogue improves as the book goes on. It doesn't improve much, mind you, but at least you won't be frustrated out of your mind.    Even worse, and most certainly the nail in the coffin for me, Herbert's conclusions often made no sense at all. In one scene, Duke Atreides gives his men a big plan. \\"Yeah!\\" I thought. \\"Go Atreides!\\" But the men don't like the plan for some reason. Paul (super-wise little git that he is) is over thinking in the corner how much his father is bombing. \\"But what's wrong with the plan?!\\" I said to the book. The book refused to tell me. As this was its job, I was rather irritated with it.    \\"Then read the appendix,\\" you might say. The appendix! Am I reading a fun sci-fi adventure or an encyclopedia? In fact, the fact this book HAS an appendix (and a glossary, for that matter) is a major \\"con\\" for me. It is not a sign of depth, it is a sign that Herbert failed at writing. What it looks like is that he could not relate background and history for his story in the actual \\"meat\\" of the writing like every other competent writer.    \\"So read between the lines,\\" you may say. Oh, easy for you to say. If you are a Dune fan who lives and breathes Dune lore, you would know what's going on because you have been immersed in it. However, if you're a new reader like me, good freaking luck. Reading between the lines is an impossible task. You just can't do it. Characters are often making illogical decisions or basing their knowledge on some as-yet undefined process that Herbert apparently expects you to read from his mind. Even better, as you're reading and making conclusions from people's actions and words, suddenly Herbert writes what they're thinking and you realize your conclusions are absolutely wrong.    Which brings me to yet another problem -- sometimes, you're waiting and waiting for Herbert to explain some alien process, kind of people, world, or person, and he chooses to describe it... with another undescribed facet of his universe! Oh, the agony!    The result is that you must rely on what everyone tells you... and that's just maddening, because you end up becoming a passive reader. It's like coming up against a brick wall over and over, and there's some ocean of meaning on the other side. You can't find a key to open the way into this meaning, though, because the mean trick is that the key is tied up in ol' Herbert's head, and there's no getting to it. You can only get a superficial, hazy feeling for every element of this universe.    I honestly don't know why this book is supposed to be the best sci-fi book ever written; I can't fathom it. It reads like it was written by a precocious high school student at best. Maybe someone can enlighten me. In any case, it's a frustrating read... very frustrating.    It's too bad that a better writer couldn't have thought of this great idea and made this book sing.
B000N6TX1I|5.0|I remember seeing some previews for this film, and thinking that it looked interesting.  I'm a big Clive Owen fan, and aside from what I saw in the trailer, I didn't really know much about it.  Had never read the book, hadn't seen any promo for it aside from the aforementioned trailer.<br /><br />As I was watching it I found myself realizing I was watching something special.  I viewed it on the train ride from the east coast to the West coast, and was thoroughly captivated and drawn into this well made film.<br /><br />Clive Owen is great in this, as is just about everyone in here.  How this film got overlooked for Best Picture is beyond me.  Three of the best films of 2007 were all made by Spanish Directors (Children of Men, Pans Labyrinth and Babel), and in my opinion Children of Men was definitely given the shaft when it came to Oscar time, only being nomimated for screenplay and cinematography, winning neither.<br /><br />If you like good movies that are intelligently made, and have a lot of replay value, buy this movie.  You won't be sorry.
0449227421|3.0|I thought the idea of genetic experimentation on humans by corporations and/or government made a great central idea for a thriller. I also liked the idea of a strong female protagonist who stumbles upon the experimentaion and deals with the greedy, arrogant businessmen who want to cover it all up at all cost. I also liked having an evil clone as a secondary antagonist. But the characters weren't particularly well rounded, and instead on focusing on the central idea - genetic experimentation on humans by unethical and immoral people or even the monster clone and his miserable evil ways, the story veered off into an unlikely and very weak romance between one of the good clones and the protagonist. The scenes where the bad clone(s) act bad are the best and most exciting parts.
1416595546|4.0|Simon Sebag Montefiore's grasp of the Stalinist era is masterful, and it's that historical detail that makes this book work. Alas, he is less adept at the art of fiction.<br />Still, this novel, as the author himself notes in his conclusion/afterword, admirably fulfills his goal of making the horrors of the Stalinist Terror live for the contemporary reader, particularly those who aren't likely to pick up Sebag Montefiore's superb books about Stalin himself, [[ASIN:1400044650 Young Stalin]] or [[ASIN:1400042305 Stalin: The Court of the Red Tsar]]. For those who have read the superb book about the impact of these years on ordinary Soviet citizens, [[ASIN:0312428030 The Whisperers: Private Life in Stalin's Russia]], this provides a fictional counterpart, one where imagination takes over and the reader following Sebag Montefiore's plot can transport themselves into the world his lead character, Sashenka, inhabited. Fortunately the reader, unlike Sashenka, can also escape this closed and paranoid world.<br />Sebag Montefiore's strength is portraying that world, from the corrupt decadence of the final years of Tsarist rule (which takes the reader from palaces to prisons) and the claustrophobic paranoia of the 1930s, which Sashenka herself displays almost without realizing it when she discovers that Stalin and his leaders, including Lavrenti Beria, have honored her dacha with a visit on the eve of May Day -- a visit that, on the surface a triumph, will hold unexpected and disastrous consequences for Sashenka and everyone around her.<br />Unfortunately, it's not until that point that the narrative really picks up and starts moving. While the characters and dramas of the first part do prove necessary to the plot (in ways that aren't apparent until much later), at the time they simply feel annoying and superfluous. And however necessary they ultimately become, the initial section is far too long, and many of the characters are too wooden and the dialogue stilted or unbelievable. Had this section been shorter and more tightly written, it would have contributed to the drama without serving as a drag.<br />Leaping forward from 1916, when Sashenka, the daughter of a wealthy Jewish industrialist, is first arrested as she leaves her boarding school and imprisoned for her Bolsheik views, the second part of the book deals with 1939, when she and her Bolshevik husband their two young children appear to have reached the pinnacle of success in Stalinist Russia.<br />This is where the plot and characters alike suddenly grip the reader and don't let go. I read the final 40% of this book in a single sitting, late into the night/early morning. Only days after the May Day party at her dacha, Sashenka's world starts crumbling around her and she can't understand why. Is it her fledgling affair with a Jewish writers who doesn't toe the Party line -- an unprecedented deviation from being the perfect Party loyalist and exemplar of Soviet womanhood? Or is there something in her family's or husband's past that is returning to haunt her?<br />The third section -- told through the eyes of a young historical researcher -- is perhaps the best of the three, however. There are few surprises in what is discovered -- except for the true, relatively mundane cause of the downfall of Sashenka and her husband. It is here that Sebag Montefiore finally wraps up the narrative in one neat package. Had he approached the story from the same persepctive throughout and used flashbacks to explore the historical dimensions, this would have been a far stronger novel, I believe.<br />Still, as it stands, this is an excellent plot that is written adequately, despite Sebag Montefiore's difficulties with character. (Shifting points of view are distracting, and even Sashenka doesn't emerge as a real character until quite late in the 1939 section -- the reader can identify with her intellectually or generally, but the real test -- could you imagine how she looked or how her voice sounded, how she would react in a situation not described in the book? -- of whether a character \\"lives\\" isn't one she could pass. (Just apply that standard to Scarlett O'Hara, for instance, and you'll see what I mean.)<br />Very much worth reading, especially for anyone who is interested in the emergence of modern Russia, how and why Communism took root there for 70 years, and the lives of Russians during and after that period, and who would rather read an impeccably-researched novel than a non-fiction work.situation not described in the book? -- of whether a character \\"lives\\" isn't one she could pass.

7884064790|1.0|This set is Chinese produced, which means that many of the movies have horrible English subtitling.  Absolutely not worth it due to the fact it distorts some of the best movies I have ever seen.  Stray Dog is a perfect example.  The packaging is cheap and the artistry on the disk covers looks ripped off, like it came from a pirate shop in Taipei.  Do Kurosawa and yourself justice and don't get these.
B001FB4W0W|4.0|No doubt about it - the Book is much better then the movie. I liked movie a lot in the beginning, it pushed me to buy the books, because I couldn't way for the next episodes, I was very excited. The movie gave me the picture of the characters of the book so I could see them in my mind while I'm reading, but after reading I was waiting for the action in the movie and was very disappointed. The producers spending a lot of the time and action for second role characters. This is story about Sookie Stackhouse and her discovery of the totally new world that is secret to other humans, about her love and her action in this new world, but it is not about Jason and Tara... They changed role of Eric (I absolutely love him in the books), he was supposed to kill the Long Shadow for Sookie, and it shouldn't be any new vamp created by Bill. And how is it possible, that vampire Bill walking to the sun and didn't burned and totally dead? Vampires even can't wake up during the day; they are dead at daytime. I hope next season will be more close to the books.
B0014DZ2VO|5.0|Tricky to rate a Bond movie for all the opinions out there for what a Bond movie should be.  Ever since CASINO ROYALE (the DANIEL CRAIG version), I've been interested in the New James Bond as I like to call him.  I fully understand the loyalty by fans to all of the previous 007 outings.  However since the restructuring of the franchise in 2006, I find the character traits given to Craig's secret agent are way more compelling than the tired old 'who's the best Bond?'.  This review is (as all of my reviews are) based solely on my outlook of a biased cinematical viewpoint.  That viewpoint is this; all Bonds before Craig are somewhat the same.  Purists scoff.   Fans sneer.  S'okay.   Say what you will, but I've never, in any previous BOND flick, FELT Bond's motivation until the last 3/4 of CASINO ROYALE.  QUANTUM is no different.  Only when Craig's 007 says that there was nothing emotional betwixt Vespa and himself to M when this film kicks off, you realise how much there was for HIM with Vespa.  He blames himself for her death.  Giving Craig's Bond a dimension only merely mentioned in previous BOND outings.  They have re-invented this character, people, Q ain't showing up.  The action in this movie is relentless.  The stunts are excellent.  In the first half hour there are four sequences worthy of climactic battle in most big screen pics.  There is very little story, however the machine that QUANTUM is, it's not needed.  I thought the action was well lensed and intense.  JASON BORNE is not as cool, nor filmed with the ferocity, as Craig's Bond by a long shot.  As far as I'm concerned, Craig IS Bond.  All memory has been wiped of what were decent, if cheesy, movies.   This is different.  This is new.  And I love it.  It would be easy to watch CASINO and QUANTUM back to back.  They flow right together.  The continuation is another plus to Bond's new feel.   QUANATUM OF SOLACE is a necessary installment of the new Bond.  Wrapping up a story line in the series and pavingthe way for many interesting new adventures, Bond truly finds, at the finale of the film, a quantum of solace.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|First off, we all know this already: Heath Ledger blew the doors off with his performance in TDK and suddenly, Christopher Nolan has created a CRIME MOVIE with a masked vigilante in it.  Is this what BATMAN is really all about?<br /><br />YES!<br /><br />Nolan hits home-runs (or at least some pretty decent singles, if you weren't a fan of INSOMNIA) and this example of storytelling is no exception.  He's one of the few people who really began to take comic book movies seriously and the Hollywood community is suddenly beginning to follow suit.  THE DARK KNIGHT is the perfect example of what happens when you take the new mythology and treat it with respect - you get a quality mobster film based in a gritty reality that you could believe might actually happen.<br /><br />And let's not ignore the fact that it's also really cool.
B000NA28A2|4.0|Since the increased hype for reggeaton music, latin music (salsa, merengue, etc) seems to be disappearing. When I got this album as gift from my mom, I was excited. This album reminds me of \\"Bachata Rosa\\", one of Guerra's best albums. It is refreshing to find a good album in Spanish. Even when I have to say that I didn't needed like four versions of \\"La llave de mi corazón\\", this album is really good to listen from beginning to end. My favorites: \\"Te contarán\\", \\"Que me des tu cariño\\", \\"Como yo\\", \\"A la vera\\".

1400049628|3.0|This book was highly entertaining. Fictional works that are written seriously can make for some great dark comedy. Where this book drops the ball is its format, though. When buying this book, I was hoping to humorously find new ways to battle the undead if and when the time arises. But as much as I enjoyed some of the scenarios, I never felt like I recieved a concrete answer as to what would be the best options for ultimate survival.    The book often times lists the pros and cons of various types of weapons. But what is never answered is \\"But what's the best combination?\\" The book ends up being pretty pointless for survival if every page lists pros of items but then contridicts the reasons, without ever giving a solution.     Overall and interesting read, but not what I was looking for.

B0001VV1GK|5.0|Santa brought my then-3-year-old son the PlanCity parking garage for Christmas 2007 and since then he has probably played with this toy more than any other toy in our home! My 8-year-old daughter also likes it and will often overcome her annoyance with her brother and play with it along with him. This garage replaced the FP garage that had belonged to his older sister and this is a MUCH better toy.  It's so sturdily built that it has withstood vigorous play for a year and still looks like new. This garage, unlike a lot of toys, allows for lots of open-ended, creative play and works with all types of small cars.     We like it so much that I took time from shopping for the Plan City gas station and other pieces for my son for this Christmas to write a review!
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|Ood, Daleks, Sontarans, oh my!  The Doctor Who, season four, with David as the Doctor is one of the best.  These episodes are wonderful, funny, filled with action and drama.  Many of the lines, jokes, and themes cross time and space, their source coming from older episodes, some from the 70s and others from just a few years ago.  Older Doctor Who fans will laugh and new fans will want to collect the older DVDs to see what the joke is about.<br />Tons of extras, such as David's video diaries, deleted scenes, audio commentary and the Children in Need Special, Time Crash. Donna Noble is such a great character, a true mate, somebody who can keep the Doctor on track and honest.  When not yelling at him.  The last few episodes are wonderful, but I really wish Davros was not in it.  Loved the fat!
B00133KFGW|5.0|Have you ever stopped and listened to the sounds all around you?  Did you hear the crickets, the wind chimes, the sounds of the wind?  They create music, a symphony when all is put together.  It is so beautiful and majestic.  Even taking in the scenery that paints pictures before you, can add to the wonders of the natural sounds.  August Rush (2007) is the perfect movie to turn your attention to these everyday surroundings.  Not only is it a movie of music and the power it holds, but it is also a movie of love, whether it be romantic love, friendly love, or the love of a family.  August Rush has it.  Its story line is unique, and is harmoniously constructed.   I give a great deal of credit to the writers, James V. Hart (screenplay), Nick Castle (screenplay and story), and Paul Castro (story).  I applaud the producers, the crew behind the movie, and the director, Kirsten Sheridan.  There were many camera angles used; most were close-ups, but some long shots were included.  There was a scene at the beginning of the film where both of these types of shots were shown.  Lyla Novacek, (Keri Russell), and Louis Connelly, (Jonathan Rhys Meyers), just met on the rooftop of a building, and the close-ups of their faces showed sparkles in their eyes, they both looked happy and free.  In this same scene, a long shot showed a man walking, later to be revealed as Wizard, (Robin Williams), on the sidewalk beneath them playing a harmonica.  The camera was zoomed out and in when necessary, and used in so many different angles.  At one point the camera zoomed out rapidly from a close-up on Russell, when she thought she saw her son.  The watcher could really get a feel for the characters throughout the movie.   It was great to see the way the music carried emotions, the lighting formed a scene or character, and the shots told the viewer what to think and feel about what was being shot.  The different sets, especially the broken down theater, proved that the props and sets were well thought about.  The costumes were mainly modern day, and the accents of the actors fit who they were described to be.  For example, Louis was an Irish character, and that's just the accent he carried.  Symbolism came with the moon and music, which was the connection between Evan Taylor, (Freddie Highmore), Lyla, and Louis.  Wizard said a quote in the movie that revealed the role symbolism played in this particular film.  He said, \\"Music is...God's little reminder there's something else besides us in this universe.  Harmonic connection between all living beings everywhere, even the stars.\\"  The setting took place in numerous cities.  They were, San Francisco, Chicago, and a few different cities in New York, all mentioned in the movie at least once.   The movie started out with capturing the viewer as, Evan Taylor/August Rush, spoke while only a black screen showed.  He was an orphan who believed the music talked to him.  He even ran away from the orphanage because \\"the music told him to.\\"  He was on the search of his parents, listening to the music to find his way.  Along the way, he met a boy named Arthur X, (Leon G. Thomas III), who introduced Evan to Wizard.  After discovering the musical prodigy that Evan was, and fearing that he would be taken away, Wizard gave Evan Taylor the name of August Rush.  August continued his journey with the help of other characters throughout the film. As he searched for Lyla, his mother, she, soon after, began the search for him, and Louis, his father, began the search for her.  The movie shows these three different lives and how they are intertwined.  Richard Jeffries, (Terrance Howard), winds up playing a big part in the paths of these characters.  August's life and search was the main focus though.  His search revealed yet another symbol, a necklace, which symbolized that he was on the right track in his journey.     This original script will fill you with emotion, questions, and even wonder.    Lie back, and let the music takeyou away in this hope filled, love story.  Discover how a necklace showed that August was on the right track.  Embrace new levels of imagination as music brings magic to the film and opens you up to ideas you never thought possible.  Answer your own questions: Are Lyla, Louis, and August ever connected together?  Does the music bring them to the end of their search on a high note?  Follow the music and find out for yourself in August Rush.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Okay, it's nowhere  near as awesome as Raiders of the Lost Ark, but, be honest, what Raiders' sequel was? Temple of Doom?  C'mon! Last Crusade? While tighter than ToD (Short Round... Willie... Falling from airplanes in a raft?... ripping out beating hearts w/ your hand?) , it had it's cheese too (Indy meets Hitler? Hydrogen Peroxide over an open wound via the Holy Grail ?!?). People take these movies sooo seriously. I was RAISED on Star Wars & Indiana Jones, but I realized then that these movies were an homage to B-movie serials (I know, my old man explained it all to me ; ) They're purely for FUN!         ... SPOILER ALERT...        I wish that they would have kept the aliens space-based rather than inter-dimensional... but... WHO CARES ?!? It's all silly, comic-book based FUN! Relax people. You're watching an Indiana Jones film...NOT Shakespeare ; )
B0011ZNAIC|4.0|I bought this for my grandson, who is not yet two.  He watches it 2 - 3 times a day when he is over here.  Actually, I am not tired of it yet.  It has adult humor and the animation entrances kids.
0743290119|3.0|This is the first book I read by Lauren Weisberger and I thought it was pretty good. I was craving some chick-lit to get lost in for a while and this definitely hit the spot. The problem? I was annoyed the entire time because I felt like the characters were too much like Sex and the City with a few small tweaks. Clearly, Leigh = Carrie, Emmy = Charlotte and Adriana = Samantha. The story lines are good and the characters are relatable but it is obvious that the author has been watching too much Sex and the City!

068987474X|4.0|Let's face it - waiting for the phone to ring is a BIG waste of time. This book is a great reminder that I am worth more than just hanging out or settling for an occasional e mail! I want my man to TAKE me out, treat me with respect and show a genuine interest in ME. I plan to keep this book in a handy place for reference for those times when my heart wants to take over and obscures what I really need to be seeing. Yeah, reality really stinks but it sure is better to face the truth than to waste a lot of time hoping that things will change.     This book is presented in a lighthearted and sometimes hilarious way while serving as a real eye opener. I would definitely recommend it to any gal who finds herself in the dating pool and to the guys out there who might want to know what NOT to do.
B001FSDOZO|1.0|Nickelback is everything wrong with music since the turn of the century.  Artifical, overly synthesized, crass, and desperate for attention.... Screaming \\"Look at me!  Look at me!  I can be just as perverse as the rap guys!\\"  Vile.  This isn't music.  This is trash.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|I really like this album and waited a long time for them to come out with another one.  This is well worth the wait.  I love the mix of hard and classic rock.  The songs are good to listen to.  My favorite is \\"I'd come for you.\\"  Another song I've enjoyed was \\"Just get High\\". It was meaningful and brought a good message about drug addiction. That's why I like nickelback a lot.  The songs mean something and can relate to people's problems and hardships and what's going on out there. I would highly recommend this CD.
0784010501|5.0|Madonna - Truth or Dare is a documentary from 1991. Most people either love or loathe The Material Girl. I love her to pieces because she is never afraid to show the good and bad side of her personality. This documentary follows Madge during her Blonde Ambition Tour, the concert scenes are filmed in color and the black and white scenes are more intimate with Madonna and her road family discussing fame and relationships. I love when she makes fun of Kevin Coster and Warren Beatty leaves nothing off the table, he tells his then-girlfriend she doesn't want to live off camera, so true! Great movie, great memories!

0316017922|4.0|One point that I found particularly interesting is his views on intelligence and diligence.<br /><br />A certain level of intelligence and education gets an individual to a certain degree of success. However, to get any further it's actually diligence that carries them. Specifically 10,000 hours of dilligence in our chosen field is absolutely necessary if we wish to make a significant impact there. Now, just putting in the hours toiling away in a cube is not a sure-fire plan. You still need that degree of intelligence, and 10,000 hours in the minimum investment necessary.<br /><br />This particular stat caught my interest because I, like many in my generation, am a job hopper. I have been blessed to have discovered one good opportunity after another in very quick succession. I see a greener pasture and I go for it. That's not to say that every move was a marvelous idea. Most were, though there were some duds to. What is true is that they have all been critical component of a very interesting path that I built for myself.<br /><br />Now I have a job in a field that utilizes all of the skills I amassed through a variety of different jobs. All the time I put in at my other positions provided the experience to get me to this place, but my accumulation of those 10,000 hours began only recently. Perhaps without knowing it, Malcolm Gladwell made a very profound statement directly to my generation. \\"Hop around to find your passion. That's fine. But once you find that passion it takes staying power to make it to the top of the heap.\\" Wise counsel, intended or not, and I'm very grateful to him for it.
1594481717|5.0|As someone who had depended on her left brain way too much in life, this book is bringing me out of my shell and encouraging me to appreciate the right side of my brain again. I am in my second year of my master's studies in Landscape Architecture and the book's chapter on design highlights the need for everyone to become designers. This book is extremely readable, it has become my bed-side book. Pink writes fluently and has created a book that is both informative and enjoyable.
0307454894|5.0|At first this was a very hard read, for me, because of the moral issue, and I only mention this because at the very first it might detract some readers. Do not be detracted.<br />To be certain this is a book well worth the effort. The insidiousness of the novel takes hold as a boa constrictor wrapping around the body of the reader. Mr. Schlink has injected a lethal moral venom into the bloodstream that one cannot escape. The moral questions come at you with no time to brace 1) illicit relationship that is certain to be ruinous 2) Love, Shame and ultimate Loss (loss for which neither Hanna nor Michael can fully comprehend in the middle of the story) 3) A horrendous crime forcing the reader to take sides (then a skill set of moral questions thrown at the reader from all sides makes one squirm, 3a) The Holocaust and the moral questions of what to do with the people who took part in the horrendous crimes 3b) a segue into Holocaust territory via a trip to the concentration camp and Michael's own moral struggle to try and see things from Hanna's PV which I believe, he is unable to do, 4) Michael's inner struggle of knowing Hanna's secret and also for having been a victim of hers, and still he has enduring love for Hanna in the form of compassion and yet his ultimate cruelty in never once visiting her, 5) I have realized I am revealing much more than I should, and shall begin a retreat. Read this book! Everyone. Buy it for your relatives. A must read for any ethics class and or Legal Ethics class. Truly, what the author does is entrench the reader in the very basic and moral questions of what it means to be a survivor and that of the relationship with the oppressor, he goes on to ask what it is to love someone, to be angry with them for the love that you have for them, to withhold that love and ultimately to betray them, and how we must go on with ourselves after the ultimate betrayal. The author insists on putting the betrayed front and center on the screen so that we may see how they have suffered and died within their yearning and desperate trying. This book like it or not is about the very cruel game of one upmanship that humans play on each other oftentimes without realizing it and how one is forced to endure punishment that far exceeds the confines of a prison cell. A truly masterful piece of art. So many intricate details compound upon each other. This is an air tight piece of writing. Also, the relationship between father and son is done so well. Michael's detachment and Hanna's bitter crime are so real one can almost feel them creeping onto the skin. One of the things I truly love about this book is that it connects philosophy and logic with feeling and emotion. The writer makes them all join hands even though on the outskirts of life they are unwilling; through his forced actions of the story, he makes them connect. Outstanding! I did not think the end would get me the way that it did. When it gets you, you better have some Kleenex handy.e how they have suffered and died within their yearning and desperate trying.

0375507256|5.0|I won't go in depth- just add my confirmation to the many voices of praise, for what little that may be worth....  Its deep, touching, very well written and highly entertaining.   A true masterpiece.  I would challenge any other writer to achieve what this book achieves in the same format.  Some could, many couldn't.  Six short stories, all interconnected, all masterpieces of emotion, and all written from completely different eras, voices, and styles.  Challenging but highly rewarding.
B001F2W4Y2|4.0|I won't deny that AC/DC's latest offering, \\"Black Ice,\\" is nothing more than their standard, straight ahead, gritty, grubby hard rock.  But would you expect anything else from these guys?  While many hard rock bands that ruled throughout the late 70's/80's modified their sound in an attempt to save their waning careers once the 90's hit, AC/DC was content with sticking to what they did best, which was provide simple, fun hard rock tunes to the masses.  It's a  formula that's worked well for them so far.<br /><br />It's been almost a decade since the Young brothers and their compadres released an album, and \\"Black Ice\\" is a welcome piece of rock in a time when bands like Nickelback, Puddle of Mudd and others rule the airwaves.  Now that's nothing personal against those bands.  I like many of them.  However, hard rock has become plasticized (much like modern country music) by cookie-cutter groups who have what publicists feel is a great image, but lacked any dirt in their music.<br /><br />\\"Black Ice\\" brings us back to the grimy times of rock, when the lyrics didn't matter much so long as the music was loud, rowdy and fun.  There are no great political messages in this album.  All you get is top shelf rock from a top shelf band.  The title track actually closes the album, but it sounds great.  The first radio release, \\"Rock N Roll Train,\\" is a wonderful blend of all of the band's instruments.  From Phil Rudd's tried and true beat to the steady guidance of Cliff Williams' bass, this is one of the tightest songs on the album.  In fact, all of the songs are tight, which shows that maturity isn't always a bad thing in a rock n' roll band.  Angus is, as always, a train wreck waiting to happen and he struts and screams with his guitar on songs like \\"Smash N' Grab\\" and \\"Money Made.\\"  Brian Johnson's grizzly vocals sound as strong as ever, and Malcom Young guides the ship with steady rhythm.<br /><br />Personal favorites include \\"Big Jack,\\" \\"War Machine,\\" and \\"Spoilin' For A Fight.\\"  Other excellent rockers include \\"Rock N' Roll Dream\\" and \\"Wheels.\\"<br /><br />Overall, there's not much different on this album from anything that the AC/DC has put out in the Brian Johnson era.  It's still just as gritty as always, albeit a lot tighter sounding and with (what some would consider a bad thing) excellent production.<br /><br />As of this writing, you can only purchase this album from the band's website or Wal-Mart.  Call it selling out or smart marketing, but this album is worth waiting in enormous lines at the big blue box to get your hands on it.  Highly recommended to anybody who grew up listening to the band or any fan of hard rock.rockers include \\"Rock N' Roll Dream\\" and \\"Wheels.\\"    Overall, there's not much different on this album from anything that the AC/DC has put out in the Brian Johnson era.

B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Celtic singer Enya returns with her first new album in three years, and with her particular musical style, those who are drawn to her music all know that a Christmas album is one Enya was certainly capable of making.  With her usual ethereal and lush arrangements, Enya weaves another successful album, with only two traditional Christmas favorites (O Come, O Come, Emmanuel & Silent Night), while the rest of the tracks contained herein are composed by Enya and lyricist Roma Ryan. The track \\"My! My! Time Flies!\\" is a radical departure for Enya, featuring electric guitar in the instrumental middle.  Still one of my favorite songs on the album!   The bottom line is, if you have treasured and enjoyed Enya's previous work, there is all the reason to believe you will find her latest offering to your liking and pleasure as well! Enjoy!

B000P0J09W|4.0|Combining swashbuckling, mystery, murder, pre-teen wonder and teen angst, \\"The Goonies,\\" is a wonderful film about two brothers and their friends who are about to lose their homes but wind up on an amazing journey that just might save them all.  When the Walsh brothers and their friends find a map in the family attic, the \\"Goonies\\" set out on one last adventure before having to say goodbye to each other.<br /><br />What they find is a trail leading to the treasure of the infamous One-Eyed Willie, a pirate who literally protected his gold to his death.  The gang has to get past a number of booby traps, including a piano of death, in order to get Willie's treasure.  They also have to deal with a rich high school bully and the murderous Fratelli family.<br /><br />This film is fun from the beginning.  Steven Spielberg story and Chris Columbus' screenplay fit well on the screen.  Director Richard Donner blends humor, adventure, and a touch of romance into the tale that prevents the story from ever getting boring.  Cyndi Lauper's \\"The Goonies R' Good Enough\\" sets the musical tone for the film.<br /><br />The cast features a number of (at the time) up-and-coming actors.  Sean Astin plays the younger Walsh son, Mikey.  Josh Brolin plays Brandon Walsh.  Indie princess Martha Plimpton plays Stef Steinbrenner.  Future fight choreographer (and also \\"Short Round\\" in \\"Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom\\") Ke Huy Quan plays Data.  Jeff Cohen portrays Chunk.  Kerri Green plays Andy Carmichael and future \\"Two Coreys\\" star Corey Feldman rounds out the Goonies as Mouth.<br /><br />The Fratelli clan is filled with the wonderful Anne Ramsey as Ma Fratelli, Joe Pantoliano as Francis, Robert Davi as Jake and John Matuszak as the legendary Sloth.<br /><br />Be warned that their is quite a bit of strong language in this film.  It pre-dates the PG-13 era, and probably would have received that rating if it had been around.  The rest of the tale is family friendly, with only mild peril and one murder.<br /><br />For a solid afternoon or evening of family fun, I highly recommend \\"The Goonies.\\"  It's one of Spielberg's best projects.evening of family fun, I highly recommend \\"The Goonies.\\"  It's one of Spielberg's best projects.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|Nothing better. Not much close. Since then it has been a steady downward roll, with bleeps of brilliance here and there, but it seems clear that the more EC fancied himself a singer and not a rocker, the more boring and (the dreaded) singer-songwriter they got. You want Elvis? You can't do wrong with this one-not a weak cut on the CD.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|This is one of the most magnificent series I have ever seen in film. It is, without a doubt, the most comprehensive nature series ever attempted. I have watched the entire series 3 separtate times and plan to watch it again soon. I honestly believe that it is something which everyone, everywhere should see at least once in their lifetime. The series says so much about our planet and the life which inhabits it. It is educational and just darn wonderful. The music, the photograpy, the awe inspiring scenes that just take ones breath away have to been seen to be believed.
B000683VI4|5.0|The Notebook was all I had hoped it would be and more. My friend recommended this movie a long time ago. I finally decided to buy the DVD and watch it. The story kept moving from beginning to end. There were a few twists, turns, and surprises. Two heartwarming stories all wrapped up in one.    This is a great movie to sit down with just you and your box of tissues, a friend, or the love of your life. It's not just a chick flick. The Notebook has a great story line, lovable characters, and a couple characters you love to hate. I highly recommend The Notebook for a quiet movie night at home. I'm glad I finally took my friend's advice and watched it.  You will be too.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|He was my favorite from the beginning of Idol last season.  So happy that his album is finally out.  His voice sounds fabulous.  He is a real professional and has fabulous technique.  A real talent.  I think he will find his sound even more as he is given the opportunity.
B001FEO6PK|5.0|This CD is well worth the buy! A great purchase for guitar players, Becker fans, and music fanatics alike!
B001ECQ75A|4.0|My wife rented this movie last week for our almost-three-year-old son. Little did she expect that he and I would watch this movie about six times before returning it, and now we just bought it for him (us) as a gift for Christmas. The first run-through, our son didn't always pay his full attention to it, mainly because he's used to his mainstays (Cars, Toy Story, Nemo, Monster's Inc., and The Incredibles -- he's already following in Daddy's footsteps as a Pixar junkie), but the next day when asked what movie he wanted to watch, he asked for Kung Fu Panda. Since then he's been infatuated with the entire cast of characters. He especially likes the villain (should I be worried?).<br /><br />This movie reinforces the lessons of \\"aspire to dream,\\" \\"follow your dream,\\" \\"don't judge a book by its cover,\\"...and also, of course, \\"always do your best.\\" Anyway, this is a great movie, great animation, great story, and a great buy. Even for almost-three-year-olds as well as 38-year-olds. :-)<br /><br />Oh yes, and don't be afraid of exposing your kids to the craziness that is Jack Black. He knows when to turn his Tenacious D off and on a la School of Rock or even King Kong, for that matter.
B0017JKEL8|5.0|An absolutely fantastic telling of a story that centers around a group of Ad Executives that work at an Ad Agency on Madison Avenue in New York city, circa 1960.  A great glimpse into how much America has changed since the 60's.  Everyone smokes almost all of the time in every scene, they enjoy five martini lunches, and doting wives wait at home for their husbands with a roast in the oven.  Wonderfully acted, engaging, superbly produced and filmed.  This is one of the best dramatic series I have ever seen on television.  I include Six Feet Under in the same category of quality.  Very cinematic.  The sound, picture, and extra features of the Blu-Ray version are second to none.  Highly recommended.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|If you like Enya, you'll love this album.  I know how many times I have played her other albums.  They are not only music but they set a an ambiance to whatever space you are in.  Also, the holiday theme is really nice.  Also, it is a nice variety to other holiday music out there.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Watch the documentary short about how they made the movie. Facinating. I cannot speak highly enough for a film that impresses. The opening scenes mimic the great Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton slapstick from silent films. By the end you are on a roller coaster ride.<br /><br />When I saw \\"CARS\\" I thought to myself, \\"Pixar perfected the art of computer animation.\\" I was wrong. This film surpasses that. And to think no other company has been able to create computer animated films in the same quality as Pixar. The bonus film shorts (two of them) are cute and funny. Grab this DVD for the kids or (heck) for yourself!
B0006J28BO|5.0|Excellent story line and wonderful animation.  Exactly what one would expect from Studio Ghibli.
B00042YL4A|5.0|Yes, the original production was brilliant for its time. Great songs, superb production, an album that arrived just slightly before its time and remains timeless.  What you really want to know however, is \\"Should I buy this version or upgrade my standard version to it?\\"  The answer is an enthusiastic, \\"Yes!\\"  The remastering makes this sound as if it were recorded yesterday, the bonuses (20 tracks!) are fantastic as they encompass not only b-sides and remixes, but live recordings from the era that have also been cleaned up to match the quality of the studio recordings.  Not all remastered or deluxe editions are worth the price of upgrade, but this one truly shines.
B0002OERI0|1.0|American Idiot by Green Day the album everyone used to love but now lots of people hate because it all sounds the same like every other new band around, its just guys with spiked hair singing about how much they hate america. Bassicly if you hate america you'll like this album but thats not why im giving it one star. Im giving it that low rating because this album sucks. Go for Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band for some actullay good music.  Dont waste 13[..] on this album.
031606792X|5.0|Very exciting conclusion to The Twilight Saga. I couldn't put it down! The way the book was divided into sections from Bella's viewpoint and Jacob's viewpoint added a good perspective to the book. I don't want to give away the gist of the final book, but it was not anything I would have anticipated which made it that much more thrilling. You can't read the other three and miss this one.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Adding Tom Cruise, Matthew McConaughey  didn't help also. Robert Downey jr. was very annoying.  Thank god I rented it. Because if I bought it -it would have gotten thrown out.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|This movie did for the James Bond franchise what [[ASIN:B000PC6A3E Batman Begins [Blu-ray]]] did for the \\"caped crusader\\".  Totally revitalized for modern times, with all of the old schtick thrown out.  Dark, brooding, sexy, artistic and cool.  What a great film.  The film is absolutely perfect on BluRay as well.  The HD mastering is perfect, the sound mastering is flawless, and the extras are totally worth the price of purchase.  Amongst the best of the best of Bond flicks.  An absolute must for any Bond aficionado and highly recommended even for the casual Bond fan.
B000002HNR|4.0|Live concerts ranging from 1969-1970 show the Doors falling apart. There singer Jim Morrison as you can often hear on this album is drunk or high and yells and just doesent sound as good. Its a good documentary album showing the Doors falling apart. Its a weird live album and is recommended for those who love live recordings and The Doors.
0694003611|5.0|Don't know what it is about this book, but it is amazing. The illustrations are repetative, the text sometimes ridiculous, (\\"goodnight nobody\\"?!) But it works magic. It simply reads like a lullaby. My children have each loved it as toddlers, and number six is proving to be no exception. (We have bought her a new copy as our old one is falling apart from being so well loved!)
031606792X|2.0|i finished BD just over a week ago and still find myself wondering how it all went so horribly wrong... for jacob. you can read the other reviews for all the details on bella and edward's perfect happy ending, the lame non-battle, the impossible baby. but i for one decided at the end of new moon that i didn't even like bella and that jacob was too good for her crazy self (and i mean that literally, i was so hoping for a logical reason for the audio hallucinations of edward's voice in that book. when it didn't come i realized just how much psycho bella belongs with stalkerish over-controlling edward, but i digress). so i pretty much read the rest of the series knowing that she and edward would end up together but really wanting to see how ms. meyer would make it all up to jacob. therein lies my disappointment. in the end he ends up with a child as his soulmate... sure he has less time to wait for her to grow up than quil and his 2 year old child love. and maybe it could've been alright if not for the introduction of nahuel, another half human/half vampire, and the allusion that jacob may have some competition for renesmee in the future... so it wasn't enough that he had to give up absolutely everything in his fight for bella? he now may face yet another battle? oh and apparently renesmee is immortal... and jacob is not (no members of the original werewolf pack are still around, right?). and jacob cannot become an immortal because vampire venom is actually poisonous to wherewolves (and even if it was possible that would be sick). what the hell? was this the best she could do for him after everything he did for the vampires? she really missed the mark with this particular plot twist.    the only reason i'm giving this book two stars is to acknowledge the storyteling talent of stephanie meyer. because i cannot deny that i was sucked into the story ... especially since i was spit right back out of it at the end.

B0017MO10U|1.0|And a slap in the face to the fans of this lame show!<br />I have watched every episode of this series at least once; some twice or even three times, if they are exceptional!<br />But what I cannot stand is being taken for a chump!<br />I am not going to go into a detailed review of these two \\"Straight to DVD movies\\".  There are more than enough posts to cover the bogus, rehashed plot elements.<br />I am briefly going to cover one important fact.  The Stargate & Company franchise's attitude to their viewers: \\"To hades with you, give us your money chimp!\\"<br />This is the formula that is truly in place for the continuation of Stargate & Company!<br />They were supposed to release these movies on DVD and then air them on SciFi.  Greed entered the picture; and now it's like waiting on some lost Orson Welles masterpiece to finally be aired on telelvision.  Well, this is not masterpiece--though I wish it were lost.<br />To think of all the time spent by so many viewers of the show, and then these schmucks do not end the series; they just want to force everyone to buy a DVD that ends the series; but wait, it doesn't end it so you have to buy \\"Continuum\\" to have an ending.  But they are already trying to assemble the original cast for a third ending?  How many endings to we have to have?  As many as shall make them so comfortable they can buy their own Stargate! :(<br />And if you doubt my assessment, then you need only know that Stargate Atlantis is ending after only five seasons.  They are going to film a movie continuing their battle with the Wraith (the Goua'uld with bad, blue skin problems); this we are told shall air on Scifi, then go to DVD.  And if this promise is kept?  What about after?  I bet no more Scifi first airings.  Oh no: straight to DVD, and we may never see Atlantis movies on Scifi again.  Not that that wouldn't be a tragedy.  But the idea I am to shut up and buy a DVD to find out the ending of a show takes you and me for utter imbeciles.<br />In short: they can take the whole franchise, along with the con, and shove it up their \\"stargate hole\\"!<br />And a third series is in the making: \\"Stargate Universe\\" or something like that.  It shall air on Scifi.  If it's successful, welcome to Ori-hell.  It's end without ending; and shall go to \\"DVD movie of the week status!\\"  Just like these.<br />Idiotic.<br />We should all \\"dial-out\\"; and leave Stargate as a very bad memory.

1416562591|5.0|The White Tiger just won the Man Booker prize. It is a well-deserved award. (I first heard about The White Tiger when it won a place on the Man Booker short list.)    Many others will write long-winded reviews, so I'll spare you. Suffice it to say that this is a terrifically fun--although not intentionally funny--book. The author does such a fine job of character and place development that you see the people and events in your mind's eye. (That's another way of saying that you're really disappointed when you turn the last page, come to the end, and have to leave. You want to hang around and learn more, but there is no more. Sad......) The language is crisp and breezy. The author remains focused on his tale and doesn't meander all over the countryside with needless detail and side stories.    This is a strong five-star book that I'm sure will garner more awards.    By the way, have you noticed the exploding number of books--obviously non-fiction, but also fiction--centered on what we Westerners arrogantly call the Near East? In the 1980s, it was hip to be from Australia--authors, rock bands, whatever. The '90s was all about Ireland, Celtic music, and River Dance. (Have the McCourt brothers finally stopped regurgitating their pathetic family history? It was really becoming immodest.) Post-9/11 is the era of the Near East: Afganistan, Pakistan, India, etc.    With The White Tiger, Aravind Adiga has set the bar very high for fiction based in that region of the world.    (I also recommend The Wasted Vigil, which is based in Afganistan. Read my and other reviews. That is a much heavier story than The White Tiger, but a marvelous five-star book. I know it will be considered for literature's highest awards.)

Starting out with a nice version of Nightrain with an announcer ranting, \\"You wanted the best but you didnt get it so heres what you get from hollywood GUNS AND ROSES!!!!\\", Then the band launches off and the rest is history. The beat just keeps going on and after you listen too this album you will find yourself listening too it again and again.

0316017922|1.0|I have read all of Gladwell's previous offerings and I must say this is by far his worst thus far. This book is unscientific, unoriginal and badly researched.    Let me start with the non-science. Especially the title. The use of a term like \\"Outliers\\" would suggest that Gladwell has understood the meaning of that word in the statistical context.  Instead, he bandied the word like any lay person would and classified anyone worth billions such as Rockefeller and Bill Gates as an \\"outlier\\" in the human population. Statistical probability does not preclude the existence of someone like Rockefeller or Gates.  In fact, it is almost certain that given a sufficiently large population, you will have people like that.  The only condition is that the bulk would fall in the middle of the distribution and a great minority should fall in either end.  Gates is therefore not an outlier as such, but rather the expected result from chance.  To be fair, Gladwell did note that the fortunes of such people have more to do with luck than innate ability.  I would have no problem had Gladwell titled his book \\"Luck\\". Instead, he attempted to imbibe some false scientific credibility using a scientific term.  Even the introductory definition of an outlier is incomplete. In any case, there are precious few scientific concepts in this book.    As for originality, the book comprises mostly of bits and pieces that are well-known in the public domain.  I give Gladwell credit for bringing them together in a nice easy-to-read form for the general population.  However, none of the things he shared are really new.    Last but not least, there are a lot of suppositions which are not well-backed by proper research or at least not properly stated as suppositions.  In particular, I found it laughable that he classified Singapore as a centuries-old \\"rice paddy\\" country (neither the centuries-old part nor the rice-paddy part is true). Also, the justification of language as a rationale for mathematical ability is tenuous at best. It is far harder to write the Chinese characters for the numbers than the English versions. As far as I know, all countries use the arabic numeral system nowadays.  Also, some of the \\"math-whiz\\" countries actually teach mathematics in English (e.g. Singapore).    In conclusion, if you are looking for a book which tells you that while innate smarts have some effect, how far you get ahead depends on your circumstances, your culture, hard work and a good dose of luck, this is the book for you.  But I have yet to meet anyone who doesn't know that already.
1594200823|3.0|I found Michael Pollan's book to be quite informative and interesting. The strength of the book was the detailing of much of the modern food chain and our dependence on but a very few staple items, namely corn and soy, to supply a very high percentage of our caloric needs. The percentage of our total caloric needs ultimately supplied by corn is quite amazing. There are many interesting facts that should make readers much more interested in a more varied diet, and making sure the food they eat is as nutritional as it should be.    The weakness of the book  was in Pollan's assertion that \\"humans invented morality\\", but he was in moral turmoil over the morality of killing/eating meat. If you honestly believe that matter plus time pus chance = you, it's hard to see how this turmoil emerges. Only if morality is not invented, but objective, does the issue of how we treat animals have any moral force. The author appears to reject this underlying true objective morality all the while wringing his hands over what he ought to eat, and how we treat the animals we raise conforms to a true objective morality. He obviously doesn't believe that \\"humans invented morality\\". I guess that's just the moral ambiguity you need to get on the New York Times  Books of the year list. We should obviously be as kind as possible to the animals under our care, and we should, as Pollan asserts, make our food chain as transparent as possible, which would affect a positive change in that direction. The first step in trying to figure out what we should do is trying to figure out if there is anything we should do. There obviously is-but the author cannot get you there.
031606792X|2.0|To start off, I loved Twilight & New Moon. Eclipse was still good, but not as exciting as the first two. I strongly disliked Breaking Dawn, and even though Twilight & New Moon are two of my favorite books, I will probably never read them again based on Breaking Dawn.     WARNING: SPOILERS BELOW.  -----------------      My first reason for disliking Breaking Dawn so much is that it doesn't at all fit in with the previous 3 books. What happened to Edward? He was always so romantic and protective to Bella. I was disappointed with Alice as well. She had always been so cheerful and close with Bella, but in Breaking Dawn her character was hardly mentioned, and when it was, she way different. (except for maybe the wedding).    I think that everything was way too rushed. In the beginning of the book, Bella is has just gotten engaged to Edward and by the end they are married, have a child that Jacob has imprinted on, problems with the Volturi, Alice leaving, Jacob switching packs, etc. And if you think about it this all happens in just a few months. (Bella & Edward got married in late August, and the book ends in like the beginning of January) which is COMPLETELY unrealistic, even if it is a book about vampires. The time lapse completely annoyed me and had me confused.    I didn't like the honeymoon scene. It seemed like all Bella cared about was sex and in the other books she had just been happy being with Edward and didn't cry if his clothes weren't off. Also on their wedding night, Edward gives Bella bruises from \\"doing it\\" and says he is not going to make love with her again until she is immortal. But then Bella somehow convinces him into it and they do it a few days later. First of all, Bella has never been able to convince Edward into doing anything in the earlier books, especially if Edward had hurt her. I just thought this was way out of character for him even if it was to make Bella happy.     Along with a lot of people, I found it completely unrealistic how Bella got pregnant. If the vampires have no blood or anything how would that work? And wouldn't his venom been inserted into her instead of \\"other stuff\\"? I know this is a fantasy book and all, but I think it should atleast make SOME sense biologically.    About the Jacob book - I had no problem with this at all, especially since Jacob is my favorite character, but after he imprinted on Renesmee, his whole point of view being thrown in there was completely pointless. Most of his book talks about his troubles as a werewolf (I hate the term shape-shifter). What I really liked was the part with Leah. I was totally hoping they would end up being together - him imprinting on her or something. They both understood each other really well, considering they had the same type of pain (Sam and Bella). I thought it would be cool if Leah helped Jacob get over Bella instead of him imprinting on Renesmee, speaking of, I found disgusting. Not just because Jacob is like 17 and Renesmee is a baby, but he was so in love with Bella and now that's just completely over with because he is head over heals for her daughter? It mad no sense at all, and like I said, him and Leah getting together would make a much more interesting twist.    After Bella turned into a vampire, she lost her character. She wasn't the clumsy, embarrassed type she always was, so I think Stephenie Meyer should of added this toward the end. Then again, Edward only turned her into a vampire to save her life when she almost died in giving birth to Renesmee. It would of been interesting to see what would of happened if Renesmee never existed.     Another thing - Bella finally tells Edward she does want to enroll in classes at Dartmouth before being turned immortal and Edward disagrees with her. Again, out of character for him. In Eclipse, this was Edward's whole battle - to get Bella to go to college and be turned immortal after and now he doesn't care any more. Speaking of Edward, since Renesmee had to be thrown into this book, I think they should of had more interaction. I can't remember one scene where Edward was talking to her or anything. I didn't get it at all, considering he is her father.    The Volturi/Ending - Probably the worst part of the book. I got so bored that I almost quit reading it - just chapter after chapter talking about the Volturi coming, all the Vampire clans at the Cullen's house, etc. and then nothing happens. All they do is kill Irina, which I think is the last person who should of been executed, considering they believed her and came out there to kill Bella and Edward. I didn't understand why Bella would be killed also - she was now immortal, and it was Edward who got her pregnant. I didn't understand the reasoning behind it. There wasn't even a fight - just them leaving, which I think didn't make sense considering the Volturi's previous behavior in the other 3 books. But then again if Renesmee was never born, Bella wouldn't (but maybe) be immortal yet and the Volturi would of never came. So if you change one thing, the whole book changes.    I didn't like this book at all, in a sense it almost ruined the saga. I'm not sure if you agree or not, but this is my personal opinion.

B001ACH4DS|3.0|David Cook was a favorite on American Idol as soon as he sang a version of Lionel Richie's \\"Hello\\" that was haunting instead of maudlin. He continued to bring surprising arrangements to light, even if borrowed, and showed himself to be a performer worth pinning some hopes on. Even his finale song was soaring and inspiring.    And now we have his first album. What a disappointment. Cook sounds like a dozen other current performers. He's lost his distinctiveness. The songs range from the forced to the monotonous, with only one or two rising to the level of listenable or interesting.     I'm willing to write this off to the pressures of hectic touring and recording, and the whirlwind this must represent. However, if he's going to become an artist worth watching, he has to do better than this collection of me-too production values on top of uninteresting songs with flat arrangements.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|What can I say that hasn't already been said? The animation is breathtaking, the story pacing is superb, the story itself is dramatic, funny, and heart-warming without being treacly. This is a movie they got right in every respect.    I'm sure all that has been said before. I loved this movie so much I just wanted to say it again.
B000000P17|2.0|The Spagethi Incident? The bands 1993 album and the last too feature most of the original members. Honestly its not really that good and is pretty cheap. Look the whole album is a punk tribute album, obviously they didnt really care about this album AT ALL. Though there are some good tributes like there tribute too Hair Of The Dog is good but honestly its not really worth your money. It is a hard rocking album but the thing of it is, is that it just isnt really them, and most metal fans dont like punk so why would they come out with a punk tribute album. This album is only for those who want all of Guns N Roses albums or just like punk tribute albums.
B000J4QWNQ|4.0|I originally saw this in the theatre, after seeing Collateral and being told how this was similar to HEAT. I was pumped up to see in. After the movie, I was very disappointed,  I felt like i just sat through a two plus hour television show.  Expecting to see shoo-outs like HEAT, i was let down. Now 2 years later, I just finished watching it with family members who never seen it, and were expecting Don Johnson in pastels. We were both surprised. It was much better than I remembered and much better than they were expecting.  No happy ending, no hero saves the day feeling. Though HEAT nor COLLATERAL didn't have this either. I think what i realised the second viewing, is that this it true gritty detective work. No flashy fashion,  nice cars, but it is Miami.   Importantly, there is no Heroes Journey, no real character arc. From the beginning, Sonny and Ricardo know who they are, who their partnera are. and at the end of the day, they still standing by each others side, regardless of what happens. They are still partners friends, family that rely on each other.   Not the best movie, but much better than i remember of it.
1407109421|5.0|Finally a fantasy book written in an intelligent manner that has elements of fantasy and incorporates a strong belief in science and logic.  Christians are the most narrow minded, cruel and ignorant people on the planet and it is fantastic to see them portrayed as such. Amazing plot, characters and story.  I was absorbed totally throughout the entire series and hardly noticed the fact that this is a YA book.  Unlike Harry Potter and the Twilight series, these books can be read and enjoyed by adults with reasonable intelligence.  An excellent book that I am reading to my nephew as soon as he can grasp the concepts!

B001H5X7JS|3.0|This review is for the unrated cut of the film. This film is funny, but not THAT funny. Robert Downey Jr. is the best part of this goofy film. The biggest problem is it's too long, this may be due to the unrated director's cut I watched? I will have to see the theatrical version to see the difference.<br /><br />***REVIEW UPDATE ON THE THEATRICAL RELEASE***<br />I was able to watch the theatrical release of this film and it is a much better cut of the film I would give this another 1/2 star for that version. The theatrical version's running time is shorter and the story is more cohesive making it a much funnier enjoyable movie.<br />***END OF UPDATE***<br /><br />The film starts strong and there are funny moments throughout, but it has some down time. If your looking to buy this film, I would probably go with the theatrical version, because the unrated version seemed too long. I wish they would stop doing two different releases for films. If your going to release a 2 disc unrated set, then at least include the theatrical version on that set!
B001FSDOZO|1.0|I wasnt sure it was possible but nickleback has eclipsed that one daughtry song as the worst thing ever to happen to music
B001DU8T6S|1.0|Okay first off let me say that i am a minor Queen fan and like there songs, not PAUL RODGER QUEEN though. How in there wildest minds replace there original singer, with Paul Rodgers come on, the guy sang for like Bad Company and Free, bands that are not at all like Queen what so ever. I think now a days Queen just has really sold out and making a new album with that Freddie Mercury poser is just a shame really in my honest opinion. If anyone who reads this reveiw disagrees with me please post a comment saying otherwise and i would give this album zero stars if they let you.<br /><br />floyd(annoymous)
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Love this movie and the blu-ray effects. Was shipped very quickly and happy with transaction.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|How can one's own imagination be surpassed by a film or gasp, sputter, television?  Well, honey, this ain't mere television, this is HBO and it's worth every penny!  In Alan Ball's most capable hands, Charlaine Harris' masterfully created characters have been enhanced and perfectly cast in True Blood.  This is something everyone can sink their, um, teeth into.<br /><br />No, the first season did not follow Dead Until Dark as written, but then, what would be the fun in that?  For those of us who have read all the books, we would have known every line, all the plots and it would've been a real ho-hum experience.  Instead, it's more like riding a roller-coaster with the captain of the football team, holding on tight and enjoying the entire ride, then wanting to ride it again and again.  Then again, in my version, it's Eric on MY roller coaster.<br /><br />Me?  I'm can't wait until Ms. Harris publishes her next book and then will count the days until Season Two of True Blood.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|Black Ice AC/DC's new album also there first album too debut at number one. Black Ice is a 15 track high voltage rock n roll album filled with basic rock drum beat great riffs and guitar solos. Classic AC/DC right here unlike there last album before this Stiff Upper Lip which was more blues is not nearly as good as this album. The best song on here is defenently Rock N Roll Train, Black Ice is only availble at Walmart so go and pick this album up now.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Man...after watching season 3 I could not get enough of Lost. I saw the entire season 4 on abc.com. This has got to be the most interesting season of all. C'mon, there is time travel, flashbacks and flashforwards. There are so many twists and turns it's unbelievable how these writers orchestrate everything.  It seems that after watching each episode, there are more and more questions that need answering. I can't wait for the new season to start.
B000002UA5|5.0|Around this time period Pink Floyd was a psychedelic band but more progressive rock band that had lost there original singer Syd Barrett, and then hired a new singer, David Gilmour and were bassicly at this time trying too become a successful band. There third album, Ummagumma is a double album with live tracks and experimental studio recordings. The live part of the album was recorded live in 1969 and shows Pink Floyd developing jams they would use later in there carrerrs, Careful With That Axe Eugene, and also still using some Syd Barrett material(Astronomy Domine) Then the album part of this is composed in sections each written by members of the band and is quite experimental. This album for anyone who craves early David Gilmour Pink Floyd and people who need every Pink Floyd album ever made
B0015ABRE2|5.0|I have seen both season 1 and season 2 of Dexter and just can't wait for the third one to come out on DVD as this is our prefered way to watch it because my husband and I become so hooked we can't wait a whole week for the next episode to come on.  We would watch 5 or 6 episodes in one night.  It is by far our favourite TV show full of suspence and twists.  Highly reccomended to all.
0525478183|5.0|Title: Paper Towns (Hardcover)  Author: John Green  Publisher: Penguin Group  Reading Level: Young Adult  Publication Date: October 2008  Pages: 352    Rating: 5/5    Summary (From B&N):  When Margo Roth Spiegelman beckons Quentin Jacobsen in the middle of the night-dressed like a ninja and plotting an ingenious campaign of revenge-he follows her. Margo's always planned extravagantly, and, until now, she's always planned solo. After a lifetime of loving Margo from afar, things are finally looking up for Q . . . until day breaks and she has vanished. Always an enigma, Margo has now become a mystery. But there are clues. And they're for Q.    Review:  Yes, I know this review is late, I would've posted it on Saturday, but I didn't because I was too lazy to start writing it. But it's here now, and it's probably going to be a long one.    I'll admit it, the summary for this book made no entire sense to me until I finished the book, so I really wasn't sure what to make of the book to come when I first opened up the book and started reading. So, what happened in the book surprised me, big time. I wasn't expecting much, obviously like I said above, but what happened was entirely unsuspected.    Now, if you read this blog from the beginning you might've come by a review for Looking For Alaska, which I will not link out of shame (The review was like one of my first reviews and I think any of my review before March, and maybe even March itself, are really terrible, so I suggest not going back there and looking, you just might hurt yourself from the horrifying reviews. You have been warned.), and if you remember right, I was not a huge fan of the book. But, I feel that if I read the book again, I will understand more about it, and look at how well the writing is or how the characters were developed. But anyways, Looking For Alaska was a good back looking back, the writing was excellent and the characters were amazingly developed. Jeez, now I forgot my point, this paragraph is making no sense whatsoever, right?    Okay, Paper Towns, right. Paper Towns caught me in with the witty and the random humor and dark edge to the writing. Margo kept me in for the first part by a landslide (Not like I wouldn't have kept reading anyways) and Q kept me at the edge of my seat along with him. The emotions and the humor from Q, Ben, and Radar was spectacularly done and so hilarious. The first part of the novel was the best. I loved the dialogue between Q and Margo, and Q was one of the most real characters I know. This novel had me laughing my guts out and making my eyes tear up. Green is truly one of the most brilliant YA writers out there today.    Okay, i feel like I'm writing gibberish so I will get to the point: This novel is amazing. It is one of the best YA novels out this year. READ IT NOW!
B000AGTPUU|3.0|I had read that this movie cost 160 million to make, and the special effects are amazing at times, but I really could not get into the weird digital animation, it was like the characters were alien, I could not really connect with any of the leads, especially the main character, he seemed so void of emotion and otherworldly, I mean could they have at least made their eyes not so dead?  On some level the film is quite beautiful, and I appreciate the enormous amount of work it took to get this film to look this way..I realize Zemikis was trying to give the movie the look of the books amazing illustrations and again on one level it works, but it sort of takes all the feeling out of the movie, I never really felt vested in the outcome of this kids trip, and the beginning of the movie, with the hobo on the top of the train was not only bizarre but more than a little spooky and i never really got his revelevance, he was never properly explained.  Hanks voices several character and he is alright i guess, but frankly they could have saved the money on his salary and gotten some unknown, I mean who really cared if Hanks was the voice?  I hope he at least did this thing for scale, but im doubting it.  I did like how the setting was the 50's, it added to the nastalgia and the CGI North Pole was fantastic, but the story waxed and wained and took a long time to get going, all and all hardly \\"A Christmas Story\\".
B001GAOY5U|4.0|I saw the 3D version in the theater which used REAL-D technology, it was the best 3D movie I had ever seen.  The glasses were grey not pink and green like the ones included with the Blu-Ray/DVD.  In addition the 3D version did not have the great colors that was seen in the theater.     That being said the movie itself was good, special effects were great and I can't complain about Brendan Frasier.
B000056BOR|5.0|I have this movie recorded off the television (when I was in 8th or 9th grade. I'm 25 now) on an old vhs tape, and it's one of my favorite movies. In fact, I've never not liked a Doris Day movie that I've seen (I haven't watched them all). Eventually I'd like to buy this movie (and most likely some of her other movies) on DVD. I highly recommend.
031606792X|5.0|I was expecting to be disappointed after seeing the 1/5 star reviews, but I loved the book!!  Way to go Stephenie Meyer; I loved the series.
B000E1ZK5A|5.0|Another superb title for the short-lived run of HD DVD.  The detailed sets look great (some scenes more than others) in Hi Def and the movie sounds tremendous as well. I recommend it for those building a HDDVD library. My system: Toshiba A35 player, Samsung 58A550 Plasma TV, Pioneer Elite SC-07 receiver)
B000JRYOPG|4.0|great movie if your even more familiar with jamaica. REAL GRIITY gangsta type movie and the acting isnt bad. ONe of my favs.
B0011QC9U6|5.0|I'll stick to the tech aspects as the content has been thoroughly reviewed elsewhere.  Hi Def (either version) is a great platform for today's animation.  The movie looks great on my system (Toshiba A35 HDDVD, Samgsung 58A550 Plasma).  The Dolby Digital Plus sounds great on my Pioneer Elite receiver.
B0007TKNL0|2.0|then you will have to be disappointed by this film. Or if you are cynical, somewhat of a purist when it comes to movie adaptations, you will have great cause to laugh and poke fun. The movie is visually decedent in many aspects, but the singing? First of all, the phantom's modern rock star voice doesnt help the fact that he cant carry notes worth a damn. And emily whats her name who plays Christine cannot hit high soprano without wavering and pinching her voice in a cringe-worthy performance. But yes, her skimpy nightgown and sexual suggestiveness when the phantom takes her down to his lair is hilariously ridiculous. Plus the eyelid fluttering during \\"point of no return\\"- subtlety is not an issue here. The first star was for some of the costumes and visual effects: the second? Because this film is more fun to make fun of than any of the films ever featured on Mystery Science Theater 3000
B000M341RI|4.0|This movie had me laughing from beginning to end. Although the subject of unemployment is no laughing matter, these gentlemen have a plan. And what a plan it is! It really becomes a comedy as we watch the clumsy attempts to dance and strip. The characters' backgrounds, truth stretching, and awkwardness is also charming as well as funny to watch. I have to admit to watching it twice because of the British accents and expressions. The best part is watching the reactions of the guys, and then the ladies. It's a romp to be enjoyed. Although I'm not so sure it's a collectible. Maybe a rental? See it if you want a good laugh watching desperate people do funny things.
B001IMJWW6|5.0|Based on Bram Stoker's novel, \\"Dracula\\", the names have been changed for the safety of those involved.  The other reason is because Stoker's estate denied director F.W. Murnau the rights to reproduce it.  Now, here is the genius of Murnau...He changes the name to \\"Nosferatu\\" and changes the main character to \\"Count Orlok\\" and bam!!! One of the greatest examples of silent films is made.    Murnau's faithful adaptation of the story brings images to the screen, the likes of which had not been seen.  The inherent sense of sinister makes the scenes that by today's standards are tame, for the time where considered edgy.  The amount of evil brought to the role of Count Orlok by Max Schreck has never been duplicated, not even by Bela Lugosi.  Lanky and slightly stooped, with oversized, pointed ears and haunted, sunken eyes, this was Max Schreck's greatest screen role and would have no doubt made him a star, had it not been for that pesky lawsuit brought on by Stoker's widow (the real Dracula)...
B001GAOY5U|1.0|As movies go it's pleasant enough; Brendan Frasier plus a hot woman is watchable, but let's face it Brendan is no James Mason. The movie is an excuse for a 3D film (they used the RealD polarized system (passive glasses) in theaters which was dark but good), and would be all right IF the 3D was even remotely as watchable here, (It's not). To combat pirating they used a magenta-green system instead of the red-blue standard, and it's even worse than bad. Now that there are Mitsubishi and Samsung HDTVs that are 3D ready out there the studios need to get with the program and produce either field sequential or polarized versions,(watchable on affordable 22\\" iz3D monitors). Anaglyph just doesn't cut the mustard anymore. People who will pay for blu-ray will shell out for the hardware to get a decent 3D experience at home! If I were either of those 2 companies above I'd contract the studios to put out software for the Tri-def or Stereoscopic viewer format which they are compatible with. Without a decent format to view the 3D on, this picture didn't need to be made........stick with James Mason.
1401322425|5.0|This is Jamie's best cookbook yet. This is the companian to his newest Food Network series by the same name. This great chef has a knack for combining unusual elements together and presents them in a wonderfully rustic and simple manner. For the home gardener, Jamie reveals his techniques to growing vegetables and fruits, putting the reader on a personal level with the chef. It reminds me of Irish super chef Denis Cotter, who also sees the importance of understanding the growing process.    Anyone can reproduce these recipes using Jamie's basic techniques. Its his ability to meld unique combinations together that makes him a genius. This is really a must-have for any serious foodie interested in gaining insight into the creative process behind some truly great-tasting dishes. Thanks, Jamie.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Fabulous photography, great narration  of our existence here on earth. A absolute must see for everyone.
B000069HJL|4.0|Was looking for a Supertramp DVD (music and video combination) but only found this CD with all the songs I wished to have. Rated 4/5 for good audio quality, but I would prefer to have this same concert with the film of the group playing the songs as a DVD, that would rate at 5/5. Aparently the film of the concert exists, but is being processed or remastered. Roger Hodgson has his own DVD with good audio quality, when you listen to his solo versions such as in \\"Dreamer\\" and other songs, it is clear he produced most of Supertramp's sound, but thier songs are much better with all the instruments in the whole band.

B000GX57YU|3.0|Fast delivery, product arrived in good shape.  Good quality sound, black and white images. Would have liked to have the other version of Still haven't found what I'm looking for, nice Choir version, but I prefer their own version. This has 3/5, because to my musical taste 5/5 would be the \\"Live at Sloan Castle\\" U2 concert
0385340990|5.0|This book was delightful, thoughtful, and poignant.  Colorful characters, a beautiful seaside setting, and a desperate and trying era, come together in a unique and hopeful story.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie is one of my favorites. It's very funny.  Can't beat the price.
0634022296|4.0|This book is a must-have for any Beatles fan that plays an instrument.  It has the lyrics to almost every Beatles song with the chords and chord charts as well.  Doesn't have cluttering tabs (which could also be a negative, I guess).  The main trouble I've had is that it's sometimes hard to get the book to stay open without the help of some sort of weight.  If it was bound in better format, I would give it 5 stars - the content is great.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is a no brainer.  Super heroes, super villans, super singing, soup even, this has it all.  Action, adventure, laughs, love and tears are a few of my favorite things... ok ok buy it you know you want to.
0823016714|5.0|I purchased this book as a used book, when I got it I was amazed to see how well preserved was the book. The book is still like new, the only thing missing is the plastic cover it has when you buy a new one.
B001CD6FKS|5.0|The critics were absolutely DEAD WRONG about this movie. If you Metacritic this movie, the disconnect will become readily apparent. The Critic average was 37% while the User average was 79%. I unfortunately didn't pay much attention to the general public reviews at that point, but seeing Speed Racer utterly changed my opinion on that, especially after the critics gave Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull a 75% average (I can only assume that they were paid off).     Luckily my sister convinced me to give Speed Racer a try. I was blown away. It is the most visually innovative film I have seen in I don't know how long. The races are spectacular, from the CG cars burning through the completely improbable tracks to the mid-race close ups that zoom from car to car, never breaking the flow of action. I expect the visual techniques used in Speed Racer to be emulated in much the same way that the techniques of The Matrix were and still are today.     As for the story and characters, they are fun, simple and over the top, precisely as they should be for this kind of movie. This brings me to one of the main points about this movie and why it succeeds so well, where so may other movies fail. Consistency. There is a consistency of language, tone, themes and visualization in this movie that is completely engaging. It never breaks its hyper-realistic form. Few films achieve the level of consistency that Speed Racer does. It's not Shakespeare and it never tries to be. It is a fun and exciting rollercoaster ride that rarely, if ever, lets up, all the way through to the spectacular ending.     Forget the critics on this one. If you want to have a fun, furious, visually explosive movie-going experience you owe it to yourself to see this movie. I can't recommend it enough.
6305657947|5.0|If they are going to remake a movie I think this is one of the best. I love Pierce Brosnan .
1423113497|5.0|The books arrived on time, and in excellent condition. The price was vry reasonable. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase.
0670020745|5.0|If you ever wondered how you brain (and \\"you\\") really works, this is a book to explore.  The experience of a stroke seen from the view of a neuroscientist is presented in a dispassionate but deeply personal manner. Dr. Bolte Taylor writes clearly and simply but I was enthralled. She presents enough \\"science\\" to inform, but without putting off non-scientists.  That said, the heart of the book is what she discovered beyond the science of the experience: the marvelous and miraculous universe that exists in us all, if we just connect to it. And she expands that universe beyond the personal without any particular religious bias, but through that same objective/scientific viewpoint.  Another facet of the book are her observations and recommendations about how to better understand and support those who have suffered a stroke or other neurological accident. They are invaluable. And obviously, she knows what she is talking about.  The book is short, but compelling and packed wiith material.  As an aside, I would recommend that you view the video of her that is accessible either through her website or just by Googling her name. Hearing and seeing her talk about the experience heightens and deepens your appreciation of her and what she shares.   I highly recommend you read this if you are a curious and open minded person. It is a book that can change your life.
B001GQO50I|2.0|Many other reviews here focus on the political controversy of this release being sourced from degraded copies of the original show... it indeed sounds like crap... so I'll instead focus on the performance which isn't that much better.    recorded in 1967, the doors were a young band and just coming into their own as a musical force. It's amusing to hear about 50-100 people clap at the end of a song, as opposed to the more usual stadium like roar one typically hears on live tapes. Still, the band sounds, to me, like they are still in bar-circuit form. Lots of songs have mistakes, sloppy transitions and they generally sound tired and mostly drunk to me. There are moments of their genius that shine though, particularly in the keyboard and guitar solos (annoyingly, the guitar is too buried in the mix). Aside from a few standout performances, this is a poor bootleg by most any standard.
B00008WT5C|4.0|A stronger album from AC/DC, it has a few classic songs and many quintessential riffs.  Both guitars are starting their amps on fire and the steady beats sound like gigantic waves crashing into the Great Barrier Reef (of Rock!).  Bon Scott may have not had all of his original teeth, but he's not afraid to lose `em again if you gotta problem with it.  A classic album, their first with the infamous AC/DC logo.    1) Go Down - 1st song on this great album?  Not the best initial impression.  Goes nowhere forever and repeats, repeats, repeats.  About what you think it's about.  2) Dog Eat Dog - Dogs n' cats does not a rock song make, but don't tell that to AC/DC.  Not too great, but I could listen to it if I had to.  3) Let There Be Rock - 2nd best song here.  A history lesson from the boys.  \\"Tchaikovsky had the news.\\"  The video is ridiculous.  Bon's a googly-eyed priest.    4) Bad Boy Boogie - Not the worst...but close.  The riffs aren't great and the chorus kinda comes and goes.  Plus I hate the moniker `bad boy'.    5) Problem Child (US version) - In the top 3.  Originally \\"Crabsody In Blue\\" on the Australian version.  This song was on the Dx5 album.  This song fits the album's tone better.  Nasty riff.    6) Overdose - Slow going, but picks up steam.  They find the pocket nicely.  Nothing too exciting happens, but Angus goes off a little bit.  Also a good build-up at the end.  7) Hell Ain't A Bad Place To Be - Top 3, if not for PC.  More of a groover.  Good solo into the bridge.  If Bon's in hell, I hope he's having fun.  8) Whole Lotta Rosie - Best song here.  One of the first I heard of theirs.  Love the back-n-forth breakdown.  Angus set off smoke alarms with this one.
B001ED7C58|5.0|SOUNDTRACK IS GREAT. I LOVE TO LISTEN TO IT WHILE IM DRIVING OR WHEN I NEED TO RELAX. ALL THE SONGS ARE AMAZING. HARD TO STOP LISTENING TO IT ONCE YOU START. MUSE AND PARAMORE ARE A COUPLE  OF MY FAVORITE GROUPS. HIGHLY RECOMMEND..AAAAAA++++++
0156027321|2.0|The book was very well written.  Not my type of book.  It was selected as a book for my book club.  I thought it would be more spiritual.  A bit too much agony and strife to take in for a pleasure read.
0553296981|5.0|We complain about our lives so many times a day.. And most of the times it's not even something really serious. This book shows you a girl that even going through such hard times, she faces it all in a peculiar way.. Of course she has her outbreaks as everyone (specially in confinement) would have but it's so... Try it! It's a must-read for all ages, but particularly for the young people.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|You can tell Pink was having relationship probelms when she wrote most of the songs on this CD.  It is has a good mix of upbeat songs with a few slower pace songs.  Great to add to your workout or party songs list.  This is one of her best CDs do date.

B00006CXSS|5.0|Band of Brothers is by far the best mini series television has ever offered. I love to watch all the mini series, but Band of Brothers is in a category all its own. I particularly like historical and WWII dramas and Band of Brothers is at the top of the list in both categories. I watch different episodes frequently and always find it dynamic, inspiring, revealing, and it draws me back again and again.

0446402389|5.0|Outstanding book. I couldnt possibly say enough good things about this one!<br /><br />For a 1st time author, Tom Rob Smith hit a grandslam with \\"Child 44\\".<br /><br />\\"Child 44\\" is loosely based on the real life Russian serial killer Andrei Chikatilo (The Butcher of Rostov) who actually killed around 52 women and children.<br /><br />The storyline in \\"Child 44\\" is completely made up, by that I mean it isnt the actual story of Chikatilo, but a fictional one based off his murders.<br /><br />Awesome suspense, great action, great characters!!<br /><br />The way he ties everything together at the end is amazing, you'll think you have some things figured out and realize you didn't, later in the book you'll start thinking you know the ending and you won't even be close!<br /><br />Producer Ridlely Scott has already purchased the rights to the film for this book, cant wait to see this one on the big screen!<br /><br />Great, great read, highly recommended to all & especially to fans of David Benioff's \\"City of Thieves\\"!
B000A88FAO|5.0|Amazing album and \\"mastertape\\" sound.  In fact I was surprised that this is HDAD (Hybrrid DVD Audio Disk)with 2 sides- one (24bit/96 kHz) for every kind of dvd-player or computer and other one (24bit/192 kHz) for dvd-audio players.  The standart CDs are(16bit/44.1 kHz). So if you have dvd-audio player(check the manual) and some approprite receiver you'll fill the magic of the \\"mastertape\\" sound !!!
B000002OVJ|4.0|The Who's Live At Leeds, recorded on February 14, 1970, is unquestionably deserving of its reputation as one of the greatest live recordings in rock 'n roll. One should put aside whatever reservations he or she might have about live albums and embrace it in all of its bombastic glory. As rightfully skeptical, however, as one should be of a live album as an introduction to a band, Live At Leeds might be the best disc in The Who's catalog to serve as such. True, more succinct and more comprehensive compilations are available, but Live At Leeds - released the year prior to the masterpiece Who's Next and the compilation Meaty Beaty Big and Bouncy - is a superb brew of hits, covers, and epics. Plus, at the time the album was recorded, The Who had one foot on either side of the dividing line between their early R&B-influenced pop songs and the ambitious, larger-canvas rockers of the late 60s and early 70s.<br /><br />The first of the hits on the album is \\"I Can't Explain\\", which (although it isn't here) was and continues to this day to be the opening number to almost every Who concert. About halfway through the CD's set list come what Pete Townshend calls \\"three selected hit singles...the three easiest\\": \\"Substitute\\", \\"Happy Jack\\", and \\"I'm A Boy\\". They might be easy and simple, but they are also catchy, intelligent, and even - in the case of \\"I'm A Boy\\" - a bit risqu&eacute;. Each of these songs is presented in a no-frills fashion.<br /><br />Two epics follow on the heels of these less-than-three minute pop songs. On their second LP, \\"A Quick One, While He's Away\\" was impressive but brittle. In this live setting, it is pumped up significantly. The spectacular \\"Amazing Journey/Sparks\\", from their 1969 LP Tommy, is arguably the highlight of the set. The whole of Tommy was played at the original Leeds concert, and is avaiable on disc 2 of the 2001 deluxe edition of Live At Leeds. The Who was wise to select this one particular track for the expanded 1995 remastered version.<br /><br />Two other classic hits are given mammoth treatment at the end of the show. \\"My Generation\\" runs for almost fifteen minutes, and is interspersed with lyrical and musical references to songs from Tommy (including some riffs that had originally appeared in \\"Rael I\\" from The Who Sell Out). I have never personally cared much for \\"Magic Bus\\", which runs for nearly eight minutes. However, it was definitely a crowd pleaser, and the band did a fine job of mixing it up here.<br /><br />Finally, the band revisits its roots with four covers throughout the disc. These are the obscure blues numbers \\"Fortune Teller\\" and \\"Young Man Blues\\" and the rock `n roll classics \\"Summertime Blues\\" and \\"Shakin' All Over\\". The Who made the former two tracks very much their own, but the latter two feel a bit perfunctory and surprisingly uninspired.<br /><br />Several better-known songs - such as \\"The Kids Are Alright\\", \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\\", and \\"Pictures of Lily\\" - were not performed at the Leeds concert. However, they are not that noticeably absent on the disc. The Who wisely treated Live At Leeds as an opportunity to present themselves in not-so-obvious ways. John Entwistle's \\"Heaven and Hell\\", the opening number, was never included in a studio version on a Who album. The Who Sell Out, the band's first great album, is represented not by the ornate hit single \\"I Can See for Miles\\", but by the poignant \\"Tattoo\\". As mentioned before, Tommy is represented by \\"Amazing Journey/Sparks\\" rather than by the classic \\"Pinball Wizard\\".<br /><br />The greatest thing about The Who in a live setting is that each member played as if he were the only one on stage. John Entwistle and Keith Moon don't just keep the beat, they rise above the surface of the songs. Pete Townshend was never quite the soloist that his contemporaries were, but given the chance to spread out, he proved himself to be at least as good of a riffer and every bit as inspired as his fellow axemen. Roger Daltrey literally andfiguratively speaks for himself, especially on \\"Young Man Blues\\", which might be his finest performance of the show.<br /><br />Live At Leeds was pretty much by accident the first Who concert made available to record buyers. The band had done an extensive tour in support of Tommy, and planned to release a live album afterward. Townshend balked at the idea of listening to and sifting through all of the shows, so he scheduled two dates to be recorded specifically for a live album. When the mics failed to record John Entwistle's bass at Hull City Hall on February 15, the concert at Leeds University became the show for the live LP by default. However great any of the shows might have been, it is hard to imagine them being as good as or better than the one at Leeds. Whatever the case might have been, rock fans of every generation are lucky to have at least one of them preserved for prosperity.ng Man Blues\\", which might be his finest performance of the show.

1416562605|4.0|Aravind Adiga's THE WHITE TIGER is a compelling novel that never gets lost in the details of India. To put a finer point on it -- the story remains the main focus and the main character Balram's narrative voice is the entire reason that Adiga can keep politics and story balanced so well. Despite Balram's flaws as a person, he has a worldview that keeps the reader fascinated.<br /><br />This is a novel that has something to say, but only after Balram completes his journey from young, naive sweets-maker to murderous entrepreneur. The entire time I wanted to know exactly what would become of Balram -- what business would he start, what would he decide about his family, what would cause him to murder his boss/surrogate Father Ashok (this is not a spoiler, as Balram reveals the murder early on).<br /><br />The novel's use of letters as the narrative engine does get a bit lost in the middle. The letters seem unfocused during the third and fourth day, although they ultimately do get to the main events that Balram promises to discuss. The narrative feels more like a journal at these points than a series of focused letters written to the Premier of China and designed to illustrate the entrepreneurial spirit of Indians. Still, that doesn't harm the overall thrill of the novel and an argument can be made that Balram is writing a confession of sorts.<br /><br />I look forward to more from Adiga.
0375842209|5.0|This is the best book I have read in years, and I am an avid reader. There are stunning bits of poetry on nearly every page. The \\"word pictures\\" as my 8-year-old calls them are elegant & positively evocative of the characters and setting. It was fun to recognize so many German phrases. And Hans is perhaps my favorite hero of fiction. My heart broke reading this book, not just because of tragedies, but because of the kindness and humanity of Hans Hubermann. I have recommended this book to everybody I know, my husband loved it, and I know that I will read it again.
B001DHXT1G|5.0|While I enjoyed the first attempt at a Hulk film, this one was much better.  This film was well worth purchasing.  Just something to note, if you buy it on blu-ray it takes a little bit of time to load, but with a little patience you will be able to enjoy the film as it should have been done the first time.
068817776X|4.0|This Holocaust memoir was hard to put down. It tells the story of Edith Hahn, a well-educated Viennese Jewish woman who managed to survive working in a slave labor camp, avoided being deported, and lived as an Aryan Christian woman married to a Nazi officer through the use of false papers. The story is as completely improbable as it sounds, yet, it really happened. There were many insights into the causes and thinking behind the tremendous anti-semitism in Austria during that time, as well as the sheer terror she must have felt trying to live un-noticed and under the radar during that horrible time in history. It was impossible to put this book down!

0765316897|5.0|Brandon Sanderson's fantasy books are great for two reasons. First, they have fun characters who are likable, but not perfect.  This is a nice thing to have in any book.  However, for me the best part about the Mistborn series is the magic system.  It is incredibly unique and well thought out, and it is extremely complicated without being confusing.  In most fantasy books, when a respected character explains the magic of the book's world, the statements can be taken as definitive truth.  In Mistborn, however, even the characters don't understand a lot of the things about their world, and the reader and the characters have to figure out how things work as the story progresses.  In fact, probably the most irritating thing about the book is how certain details about Allomancy aren't revealed even at the end, and I know Brandon isn't planning to release more Mistborn books anytime soon.  I want to know the truth about atium!    But overall, this is a very exciting series, with a satisfying if bizarre ending.  Sanderson continues to improve his writing skills to match his tremendous imagination, and if you enjoyed any of his previous books, you will definitely want to read this one.
B000BEZQ18|4.0|I'd read about this soundtrack frequently as it was given mention in many of the artists' CD reviews.  I'm glad I put it in the shopping cart.  Gustavo Santaolalla's instrumental snippets are beautiful, as they punctuate the soundtrack.  He wrote the music for Emmylou Harris' recording \\"A Love That Will Never Grow Old.\\"  With Bernie Taupin doing lyrics, it is a beautifully wistful track with Harris' vocals gorgeous and stately, \\"Just a smile in your eyes, it can light up the night.\\"  Santaolalla also wrote Mary McBride's track \\"No One's Gonna Love You Like Me\\" that sounds like it's a blast from the past.  The Santaolalla/Taupin team also writes Teddy Thompson's recording of \\"I Don't Want to Say Goodbye\\" with Thompson's gorgeous vocals plaintive & pure, \\"All I want to do is live with you.\\"  Jackie Greene performs another Gustavo track on the hoe-down \\"I Will Never Let You Go.\\"  In addition to the Linda Ronstadt hit \\"It's So Easy\\" penned by Buddy Holly, Rufus Wainwright performs the somber piano melody \\"The Maker Makes.\\"  Teddy Thompson & Rufus Wainwright's duet on Roger Miller's classic \\"King of the Road\\" also puts a smile on my face.  This is an excellent collection unified by the film's theme and Santaolalla's musical vision.  Enjoy!
B000UJ48VI|5.0|Although this movie does not really accurately portray Nabokov's story, it is a work of art in itself. Sue Lyon is perfect as the object of sexual obsession.  James Mason is perfect as the obsessed.  Shelly Winters is perfect as Shelly Winters.  Sue was never able to continue on with different roles and we wonder what she would have been like if she had. We are able to start to see some of Stanley Kubrick's genius in this early movie of his career.  Although, I don't personally approve of this type of situation, I am highly entertained by it and we have all known characters that resemble the characters in the movie.  They are people we snicker about behind hand-covered mouths.  The song by the Police, \\"Don't Stand So Close to Me\\" serves to conjure up scenes from the movie and provides a romanticized and fitting musical tribute.
006088732X|5.0|First off, I want it to be known that this is not a book for younger readers. Much of the subject matter involves topics that are just too complicated for some younger readers. Now that doesn't mean that some advanced younger readers won't be able to read this maturely, but offhand I'd say that this book is best for readers who are 16 & above. Any parents that have kids that are interested in this series should read the books first & see if it's right for their kids. (It's a great series, so there is the danger of the parent swiping their kid's copies before they can read them!)<br /><br />The first book in the series introduces the characters of Spencer, Aria, Emily, & Hanna. These girls used to be the best of friends... until their friend Alison mysteriously dissapeared one night at a sleepover. After that disastrous night they all went their seperate ways for the next few years, only to once again reunite in high school. Each girl has secrets that they don't want anyone to know. Spencer's intense rivalry with her sister Melissa has her trying to beat her in every category- even in the boyfriend category. Aria is trying to forget everything in her past even as she seems doomed to repeat her father's mistakes. Emily is trying to be the daughter her parents want... but how will they react when they discover that she's a little *too* friendly with the girl next door? And the formerly chubby Hanna tries just a little too hard to be thin and popular- she's willing to do anything to stay on top, even to the point of hurting herself.  Now even with this powder keg of secrets, someone is watching and trying to push these girls beyond their limits. This mysterious person not only knows all of their sordid little secrets, but they also seem to share the first initial of a certain someone who went missing so many years ago...<br /><br />I really didn't know what to expect from this series. At best, I was expecting a \\"Gossip Girls\\" clone. At worst I was expecting another \\"Ooh, we're rich, pretty, & biotchy. Love us!\\" type of book that really has no true reading value. I was incredibly shocked by the quality in this book. Not only are all the characters incredibly interesting, but the author manages to get one of the gold rings in literature: she makes her characters sympathetic & interesting even though each one is completely unlikable! That's right, you can't help but feel sorry for these girls even as you curl your lip at how despicable each one of them are.<br /><br />Now some people have complained about the sexual situations in the series, but I have to say that the sex isn't over the top or glamorized. In fact, the sex is often portrayed in a negative light. Rather than have these girls hooking up with someone for love, they hook up (or try to hook up) for power or to be liked. The result is that the girls look pathetic & weak, which is the author's intent. Most teens over 16 will be able to detect the difference between someone hooking up for pathetic reasons & those doing it for lust, but younger readers may not be able to understand the difference. That's why I'm again stressing that parents will want to preview this series for their younger readers & discuss the themes in the book. Not only will you appear that much cooler for knowing the series, but it's a good way to discuss the more delicate topics such as sex, alcohol, & self-esteem without seeming preachy. (Plus the books are just really darn good!)<br /><br />5/5etty, & biotchy. Love us!\\" type of book that really has no true reading value. I was incredibly shocked by the quality in this book.

B00063F8B2|3.0|This CD spends a lot of time in my player around Christmas.  Why the three star rating then, you ask?<br />The first half of the CD, which features original songs from the movie, is great.  Josh Groban's \\"Believe\\" is the highlight of the disc.  The original songs \\"When Christmas Comes to Town\\" and \\"The Polar Express\\" are enjoyable as well.<br />The second half  of the CD contains the same old Christmas classics from Frank, Bing, and Co. that appear on almost every other Christmas compilation out there.  It seems like a waste; the movie featured a great score by Alan Silvestri, but unfortunately, only three of his compositions made it onto the CD (two songs, plus the medley that plays during the closing credits).  Personally, I would have preferred a bit more of the film's score and a lot less of the verge-of-public-domain tracks that are played in every department store from Halloween until December 25th.<br />My other complaint with this CD is that Tom Hanks, while a great actor, is a horrible singer.  Actually, his \\"singing\\" can be described more as shouting over the other vocalists, than singing.  I enjoyed the rendition of the title track in the movie, but Hanks' vocals on the album version border on annoying.  Luckily, he only appears on two tracks.<br />So there you have it.  Would I recommend this CD?  Yes.  It has it's faults, but is still a must have for the holiday season.
031606792X|1.0|I'm not going to bother with a plot summary here, because half the universe already knows all there is to know about Bella and Edward (and Jacob) and the other half doesn't care. I read all four of the books in this series over the past week because I wanted some light escapism while recovering from surgery - nothing too serious or requiring much concentration. Meyer's candyfloss vampire romance seemed ideal.    Well, the first three books were fine: certainly escapist fun, not to be taken seriously at all, and ideally catered to her target audience. We had the accident-prone, ugly-duckling teenager and her handsome, clever, brooding vampire boyfriend. We had his 'I can't stay with you because I'll hurt you' break-up arguments. We had her 'make me a vampire now or it means you don't love me!' teenage pouts - all very in-character for someone of Bella's age. We even had a love triangle with Jacob the werewolf, who actually manages to get Edward to like him when he and his pack combine to help save Bella's life. All entertaining stuff.    With _Breaking Dawn_ I get the sense that Meyer was carried away with her own success and actually believed her own publicity. This book is a mess. It should have been sent back to her by her editor with a polite note recommending that she tear it up and start again. Rule one of writing a series: keep your characters in character, though give them some growth. Rule two: remember other minor characters you've had along the way and use them too - readers like them. Rule three: avoid plot developments that require that your readers do twenty somersaults of disbelief-suspension. Rule four: don't introduce two dozen new characters more than halfway through the final book. Oh, and rule five: if you're setting up a scenario in which your characters have to fight for their happy ending, make them... y'know... fight!     The pregnancy required a huge suspension of credibility to begin with, and its progress made me wonder if I was somehow reading a very, very bad fanfic. The birth scene also felt like something written by a 12-year-old fic writer - and I've read far better stuff by 12-year-olds. The imprinting was entirely predictable - read the last two books, people! It was obvious that Jacob was going to imprint on a baby somewhere along the line. But *this* baby was annoying in the extreme. Superkid, with a ridiculous name and a fast-track childhood... good god, can you get more idiotic?    Worst of all, though, was the battle with the Volturi that never happened. Anti-climactic? Oh, yes. Add to that all the extra characters who appeared throughout the book, characters we had no reason to care about - why should we, after all? Final book in the series; we know we won't see them again! - while we don't get to spend time with characters we have got to know and like. Who cares about Arum from wherever? I'd rather see more of Carlisle, and what about Bella's mother, who we barely even got to see at her wedding?    Readers who suggested that the wedding should have been an epilogue to the third book and this one scrapped are right; this was a massive waste of readers' time and money.
B0002Z0EYA|5.0|Many reviewers have complained that the movie \\"Troy\\" is not completely true to the Iliad in portraying the characters and events of the Trojan War. This is unfair. Even in ancient times, the Iliad was not the only version of the Trojan War stories, and the Iliad which has come down to us may not be the only version that was performed. The Iliad only tells what happened in the space of 50 days in the 9th year of the war, although it alludes in passing to events that happened before and after these 50 days. Like the whole Camelot cycle which developed through the Dark and Middle Ages, the Trojan War cycle picked up and incorporated the best (and contradictory) legends over a millennium from Greece and Asia Minor.  Modern historical fiction has been even more imaginative in retelling the stories.  Further, it has been traditional for a long time not to portray Homer's literary gods in other tellings of the War.  \\"Troy\\" does NOT forget the gods - the presence of the gods is always there in the way the humans (especially Priam, Briseis, and Achilles) refer to their existence.    The movie \\"Troy\\" looks at what might have been the historical Bronze Age kernel for the legends and does a wonderful, powerful job of doing so.  It specifically says \\"INSPIRED by the Iliad\\".  If you want to see a movie which hews closer to the plot line of the Iliad, see instead the 1962 sword and sandals movie \\"Fury of Achilles\\".  I think Peterson's is a monumental achievement, and I do not tire of watching this movie (I have not seen the director's cut yet).    The movie is very good at exploring the essence of the characters which have come down to us and the Greek Dark Ages warrior code portrayed in the Iliad.  We see in Achilles' quest for glory and Odysseus' narration the attempt to find in military glory and song a meaning for our mortality as opposed to the immortality of the gods. We see how the society is too small for the great warrior to fit into. We see in Hector's character of the reluctant warrior the distinction made between the two warrior codes of the aggressive quest for glory and the defensive warrior who defends a civilized city.  The movie's Priam is like that in the Iliad - he relies on a religious fatalism to avoid having to make difficult decisions.  Paris is correctly portrayed as a coward and seducer, so you can't blame Orlando Bloom for his portrayal of Paris.    On the whole the acting is quite good.  I am not a Brad Pitt fan, but with the possible exception of Daniel Craig, I do not see who else would have had the star power, beauty, and grace to BE Achilles.  Eric Bana was perfect as Hector - valiant but overmatched (and emblematic of the Trojans as a whole), with his expressive, soft, anguished eyes, and he and Andromache (Saffron Burrows) had a true chemistry which intensified the sad fate of this loving couple.    If I have one major criticsm, it is that the fates of certain characters, which are set in the canon of Western literature, were too radically different. I speak of Agammemnon and Menelaus.  The ending was too conventional, in that the bad guys (which Menelaus was not, really) got bad ends at Troy.  Agammemnon should have returned to Mycenae - there is a whole lot of Greek literature based on that.  We should have had a real sense of the absolute loss and waste of the destruction of Troy, without the catharsis of Agammemnon's death.    I still highly recommend this movie, and I especially like James Horner's musical score, which particularly packed a visceral punch in the invasion of the Trojan beach.

I found this to be thorough and easy to understand and helped me conquer my fear of knitting socks. Would recommend this one in a heart beat.

It has been a very useful reference book and I find myself going back to it time and again.<br />I'd recommend this one in a heartbeat.
0451528018|4.0|Not being an avid mystery reader (outside of the Hardy Boys in my youth), and never reading a Sherlock Holmes short story or novel, I found \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" a very refreshing book even though it was written in the early 1900's.<br /><br />Sir Arthur Conan Doyle creates an entertaining story that seems out of place among the novels from that period because \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\" reads more like a modern novel.  This may be attributed to the fact that it was written as a serial and makes effective use of cliffhangers and foreshadowing to keep the reader engaged.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes himself is an interesting character.  His ego is enormous and his humor, combined with his condescending attitude, was somewhat of a shock to the stuffy analytical character I expected.  He was of course methodical and calculating, but would also be inclined to hop \\"himself up on coffee and consume an incredible amount of tobacco\\".  Watson, who does the heavy lifting of the pair, has to put up with Holmes' attitude which creates an interesting dynamic.  The reader would not have been surprised if Watson suddenly decided to throttle Holmes if he didn't admire him so much.  Holmes \\"...loved to dominate and surprise...I had often suffered under it...\\" says Watson at one point.<br /><br />In the age of CSI and Patricia Cornwell, the mystery itself (that revolves around a curse upon the Baskerville family who are haunted by a supernatural beast living in the bogs by their estate) is not as entertaining as it once must have been, but the narrative unfolded nicely, the characters were fun (and still fresh) and the ending was resolved nicely.  I found the mystery to be smart and fun to read, with great use of settings to create an effective mood. I expect I will need to spend more time with Holmes and Watson in the future.

On the whole, Mad Men, season one, was well worth the price.
B000E1ZBGS|3.0|I love Austen and have read the book and seen the BBC adaptation more than once. Since this movie is so much shorter, I knew there would be compromises, but I had still hoped that the film would bring Austen's loving, amused, witty and razor sharp view of the British society in the late 1700's across. The book is not just about two people who go through personal changes and external adversities to find each other in the end. Their romance is a case in point of the silliness, pretentiousness, the pride and the class-orientation of those times and how its inhabitants struggle with or submit to it.    This film is a rounded romance that the American audience will love, fast-paced, with strong characters and a satisfying plot, dialog and ending - I appreciate it for that. Compared to the BBC version it also brought welcome realism and grit to the imagery with plainer costumes, dustier scenery and sweatier faces. But to be called an Austen adaptation I would have needed the characters to be much truer to Austen's originals:    Lizzy is fun-loving, caring, witty and confident. But society calls for gentle females that know and appreciate their station - which of course is below that of men. Lizzy knows that and keeps her intellect hidden, bowing to society's  expectations and revealing her insights only to Jane or her father, not to the public. Knightley's version of Lizzy is still a delightful individual, but too self-assured, candid and rebellious.    Jane, according to Austen is very sweet and good-natured, always trying to believe the best of people. She is also very delicate and coy, keeping her public dialog completely innocuous and her eyes mostly downcast.  Rosamund Pike makes Jane by far too confident and strong. Her deep suffering from Bingley's supposed rejection doesn't come across at all.    Mr. Bennet's chief entertainment is his private amusement with his' wife's and his three younger daughter's silly preoccupation with men, fashion and gossip  plus his delight in his two older daughter's beauty and sense. He is truly funny, but that is appreciated only by Lizzy and Jane, the rest of the family either doesn't catch his quips or misinterprets them. Donald Sutherland only gets to play a kind but boring head of family, resigned to his life in an all-female household.    The BBC version of Mr. Collins is wonderfully oily.  His stilted but eloquent dialog, his complete acceptance of the rules of societal ranks (total submission to Lady de Bourg and belief in superiority over the Bennets) are satisfyingly repulsive. Tom Hollander's version is only that of an ignorant idiot.    I love Judy Dench as an actor, but here she is too regal, too charismatic. Austin gives Lady Catherine de Bourg superiority only through her riches, position and through a strong enough  intellect and inbred confidence to manipulate everyone around her. Austin makes her meddling and truly undeserving of the reverence offered her, especially by Collins.     Finally Darcy. According to Austen he is smart, brooding, very proud but caring and generous. He is genuinely struggling with his own affection for Lizzy. His sense of propriety doesn't allow this connection especially in light of the disastrous impressions he gets from the rest of the Bennets. But his emotions are too strong to ignore. Colin Firth brought Darcy's contradicting feelings brilliantly to life in the BBC production, particularly in the key scene where he proposes and Lizzy rejects him. He is uncharacteristically nervous and fidgeting; he is hopeful, and vulnerable but also angry and confused. Matthew Macfadyen doesn't bring more than the anxiety that would be part of any marriage proposal - none of the underlying battle shows. The rest of the film doesn't see many emotions from Darcy beyond superiority and boredom - way too flat for what Austin had in mind.    In summary, if you expect a delightful romance, you'll be satisfied, if you want Jane Austen's vivid and multi-layered  characters, social insights and scathing dialogs, you'll be disappointed.

031606792X|3.0|_Breaking Dawn_... Twilight Book 4.  Wow.  As much hoopla as I'd read about this book being horrible ans plot-holey and un-realistical and lengthy and unresolvedly unviolent...I still wanted to read it, because I needed closure of some kind.  Reading this book was worth it for:<br /><br />***SPOILERS***<br /><br />1.  Watching, in my head, as Bella somersaults off Carlisle's table right into her vampire life.  That sums up the change for me. (Why people got upset that Bella lost her clumsiness amazes me... we expected that.  Bella's still clumsy in her head....she doesn't realize half the time all the things she can do.  She's still trapped in gracelessland. :)<br /><br />2.  Reading the description of Edward's mind being blown when he realizes that he impregnated a human.  It's like, woah dude, didn't see that one coming.  (Why people want to pick apart how a mythological creature could possibly DO this is silly.  Obviously the baby ain't normal, anyhow... Probably the baby and mother's chances would be nonexistent in \\"normal\\" circumstances. But think about it.  We halfheartedly refer to Edward et al as the \\"undead.\\"  But they're technically just \\"changed.\\"  Before their human body reaches the point of death, there is the magical insertion of vampire venom which transforms their weak human forms into superstrong bloodsucking machines.  Is S.M.'s breed of vampire actually dead?  If dude can swallow down wedding cake and use blood to run cellular processes and have living DNA, why in the world couldn't he knock somebody up?  Just because he's not supposed to sweat don't mean his other plumbing don't work, it's just not usually necessary. I figure that the advent of the new breed of Quileute Wolves wasn't the only genetic mutation that came about because of the vampire clan's proximity.  Bella was around Edward enough to spark some kind of vampire body mutation.<br />3. Charlie happy:  SUE :)  RENESMEE :) BEER :) FISHING :) STEAK!!  Yay Charlie :)<br />4.

I was glad that Bella's playing field was finally equalized from her perspective, making her a strong character who found not one, but several objects of true love (Edward, Renesmee, Jacob, family-ies, Forks, etc.) That's more realistic than anything else that SM wrote.  I read a few reviews that sorta badmouthed Renesmee's character, calling it a usurp-tion of Edward's place in Bella's heart.  But it seems to me that that tiny, weird, fast-growing half-myth is the culmination, not the denial of their love... and I, for one, would like to see her grown up story told.h to take in, but I was glad to meet them no matter how short the acquaintance was.

The direction (from the man who filmed \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\") is spot on, and after 30 minutes you will find yourself completely pulled into the situation.<br /><br />This is a brilliant and inventive story that has the power to shock, and by the end I was stunned by what had happened.

She exhibits a maturity that belies her few years and her ease at being a bit experimental is admirable if not always playing in her favor.

B001DHXT20|2.0|The biggest plus for this movie was in the quality of it animations ( and even they were not spectacular - as if I'd seen them before). Otherwise, I had a hard time staying engaged with the movie. There was nothing gripping about it for me. Just another one of those action movies. In the battle between the hulks, there was no reason the actual Hulk should have won other than the fact that he did. William Hurt's character was a particularly strange one. He never really seemed to come off as an angry, and authoritative general. More namby pamby than anything despite the mustache. I spent $8.98 for this on DVD at Target and had the feeling that I wasted my money. The night before, I happened to pick up Batman Begins for $4.00. That was engrossing. The Hulk was barely worth my time. I would feel sorry for someone who plunked down $25 for this movie on Blu-Ray. If anything, buy it used. Certainly nothing to write home about. Different strokes for different folks I guess. Not my cup of tea though.
0575041714|5.0|I tossed this one back in my TBR pile after my son read it to give me an excuse to re-read. I hadn't forgotten how much I enjoyed this first Death book, and hadn't really forgotten the details either, but it was wonderfully fun revisiting it.    The basic premise, for anyone who hasn't read the Discworld books, is that Death takes an apprentice, Mort. This is where we learn of the theory behind Death's job, and his affection for kittens, as well as his curiosity about and inability to understand humans, particularly that emotion stuff.     Mort, unsurprisingly, makes a bit of a mess of things, and his attempts to fix it just make things worse. There's some interesting (and hilarious, of course--nobody missed the memo on that, right? Terry Pratchett = very, very funny unless otherwise indicated) theory about destiny and what happens when you mess with it, and also about the nature of history.    Mort's one of the earlier Discworld books, and it shows, because it's not nearly as complex as later ones, but it's got the serious bones overlaid with fantasy and humor that's common to the whole series.    It's also a very good introduction to the series, better, I think, than the first, Rincewind books. It's short, uncomplicated, and doesn't draw on knowledge or events from previous books. And did I mention it's funny? I'm incapable of reading a Pratchett book if there's anyone within shouting distance without reading lines aloud to them.

0316017922|5.0|What makes a successful outlier? Western culture admires the story of 'rags to riches', or a 'self made millionaire', but Malcolm Gladwell argues that there is more to this equation: determination, intelligence, and persistence all certainly contribute to the success of an individual, but  as the author argues, the environment, culture, even your date of birth can all have an enormous impact as well.<br /><br />On the surface, we all recognize Gladwell's arguments, after all, we have all heard \\"at the right place, at the right time\\". But the real contribution of 'Outliers' is in bringing out some of the commonly held assumptions in our life an exposing their impact: summer vacations hurt students in poorer demographics, the month you were born in can make or break your sports career, and so on. In a typical Gladwell style, it is a captivating read.<br /><br />Of course, this does not mean, that diligence and practice have no place in success. On the contrary, Gladwell points out that the most reliable predictor of an outlier is the \\"10,000 hours of practice\\" that you have to put in to become a star in your field. And then the question is: how early in your career can you reach that milestone, and will your environment assist you, or not?<br /><br />Great read for entrepreneurs, parents, and students!

With so many other great children's books out there, I hope that children will close this book and open something better written.
B001E5FYS8|4.0|While police sirens whine far below, this man looks from a towering skyscraper down at Gotham as he prepares to step into the abyss. He knows that what he will do is not legal, but thinks that it will benefit others. Even more, he is drawn -- by his very nature -- to act.  If you think I'm writing about Batman in The Dark Knight, well, I'm not (at least not just yet). I'm writing about Man on Wire, a documentary about tight rope walker and proto performance artist Philippe Petit, who wire walked between the tops of the World Trade Center's Twin Towers in August of 1974.  Director James Marsh uses a combination of vintage footage, contemporary interviews and dramatic recreations to tell the story of how Petit dreamed up his mad scheme, recruited his motley band of helpers and circumvented security to bring his dangerous plan to fruition. In some ways, the film works as a caper or heist film wherein in a team is gathered to steal the jewels or break out of prison.  There is no mystery about whether he will be successful. After all, Petit is interviewed in the present day (so we know he lives), and no one would make a film about someone who wasn't able to pull off an elaborate stunt over thirty years ago. The fun is watching how it was done. But it can be a bit unsettling to watch as blueprints for the World Trade Centers are laid out to plot a stunt, when we know that in the years after 1974 the blueprints for the buildings will be studied for much more malignant reasons.  But as a Christian, I find it odd to be put in a place of rooting for someone who's breaking the law. In Romans 13: 1 & 2 the apostle Paul wrote \\"1Everyone must submit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established. The authorities that exist have been established by God. 2Consequently, he who rebels against the authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and those who do so will bring judgment on themselves.\\"  Petit's comrades arguethat since he has no ill intent, it doesn't matter if he breaks the law. In the film we are shown some of Petite's stunts prior to the WTC, tightrope walking between the towers of the Norte Dame Cathedral and the towers of the Sydney Harbor Bridge. After being arrested in Sydney, Petit swipes the watch of one of the policemen who arrests him.  I think when we're young we all have an impulse to break or at least bend the law. (I know as a kid and a teen, I might not have always strictly followed laws scrupulously concerning trespassing when with a friend off-roading or toilet papering houses or...the traffic laws or... how much of this do I want my kids to read?) And part of the fun of watching movies is seeing characters do what we would never do. But this is a real person committing a real crime that could have not only cost him his own life, but the lives of onlookers and the police called to bring him in.  And yet watching a man walk back and forth between those massive structures is captivating and at times quite beautiful. Can we become too obsessed with following legalities?  Jesus certainly was not always a stickler for the law. The Pharisaic law said that one should not do any work on the Sabbath, including healing. But we have this story about Jesus from Matthew 12 - \\"9Going on from that place, he went into their synagogue, 10and a man with a shriveled hand was there. Looking for a reason to accuse Jesus, they asked him, \\"Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?\\"  11He said to them, \\"If any of you has a sheep and it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will you not take hold of it and lift it out? 12How much more valuable is a man than a sheep! Therefore it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath.\\" 13Then he said to the man, \\"Stretch out your hand.\\" So he stretched it out and it was completely restored, just as sound as the other.\\"  But there is a difference. When Jesus broke the law, it was always clearly for the glory of God, the benefit of others and the furtherance of the Kingdom. It wasn't just on a lark or for self glorification.  So back to Batman. Yes, I did see some similarities between these films. One of the most fascinating things in The Dark Knight (directed by Chris Nolan) is Bruce Wayne (played by Christian Bale) wrestling with the outlaw nature of his work as a vigilante. He sees his work as necessary to protect the lives of others, but he would rather be able to live within the law. But he finds he can't.  In The Dark Knight, Wayne uses all the tools at his disposal to fight a war against crime and terrorism (as personified by the Mob and the Joker played by the late Heath Ledger). But he comes to realize there will be a cost to such a battle not just for himself, but for those who join him in the battle. And he agonizes over the potential costs in the lives of others. (Petit in Man on Wire rarely seems concerned by the costs paid by those who join him in his quest.)  These moral quandaries, never fully answered, are what make The Dark Knight a little more thoughtful that the average summer superhero epic. And it was odd to find that the fictional blockbuster was more serious on a moral level than the documentary from the BBC and Discovery Films.
B000I5X81K|5.0|The first time I heard Josh Groban's voice was on the radio with his most famous song, \\"You Raise Me Up.\\"  While the song is not one of my favorites, his voice was unforgettable.  How many ways can I describe his voice?  Deeply moving.  Colorful.  Emotive.  Purely masculine.  And also very versatile, as proven with the brilliant TV theme song medley he sang at the Emmys earlier this year.      But let's talk about AWAKE.  The song that drew me to this album was \\"You Are Loved,\\" one of the most divinely inspirational songs I've ever heard.  At first, I thought that it was a friend or lover speaking, telling their beloved to push on and persevere.  Now, after listening to it many countless times, I interpret it as God singing to His children, reminding them of the love and comfort that they have to rely upon.    The whole album is a soaring experience from the Italian language opener \\"Mai,\\" meaning \\"Never\\" to the closing collaboration with Herbie Hancock, \\"Machine.\\"  Some of the stand-outs for me are the mystery-laden, haunting \\"Lullaby\\" and the tragic story told in \\"Weeping.\\"  There's also plenty of shimmering romance in songs such as \\"Now or Never\\" and most notably in \\"Un giorno per noi,\\" translated as \\"A Day for us.\\"  Yes, AWAKE has a different sound than Josh's previous albums, but it is representative of his artistic versatility.    If you love Josh Groban's masterful voice as I do, then you should enjoy any of his albums.  But the one I recommend the most other than AWAKE is his debut album with a profound song telling of loss and envisioning Heaven: \\"To Where You Are.\\"  Words cannot express how that song has worked in my life after losing my dad.      (Sidenote: Like many other listeners, I'm also interested in a Christmas release with \\"Oh Holy Night\\" and \\"Believe.\\"  Maybe eventually...)

I love the sight of children and their parents poring in fascination over the pages of a book.  ABC3D has so much to offer.

0060920084|1.0|I am a fan of Bill Bryson. I simply loved his Short History of Nearly Everything and In a Sunburned Country. Just awesome stuff. Reread both several times. I liked several other of his travel books, as well.<br /><br />But this...this is just...bad. I mean seriously bad. He makes fun of darned near everything from his youth from his family on, and not in a funny, teasing, but affectionate way like Gene Shepherd had the sense and talent to do, but in a really nasty and distateful way. And it's just not funny. Nasty satire can be a guilty pleasure...like the old National Lampoon magazine managed from time to time (remember the Teddy Kennedy Volkswagon ad?), but this stuff is just...bad and boring.<br /><br />I guess Mr. Bryson is just not talented as I thought, and hoped, he was.
B001GZ6QC4|4.0|Very good movie.  Christian Bale is the best Batman and Heath Ledger played an awesome Joker.  I would see the movie again and will likely get it on DVD for the family, but in my opinion, it was a bit too long.  They could have easily taken 30 minutes of fluff out of the movie.
0141185066|5.0|I made a resolution to read several of the greats works of literature throughout 2009, and got an early start with this moving saga.<br /><br />SHORT, NO SPOILER REVIEW<br /><br />The novel is in one sense about the trials of a poverty stricken family of Oklahoma farmers, the Joads, who are driven off their land in the mid-1930s by the Dust Bowl, by greedy banks and by the never ending pace of modernization.  Lured to California by handbills promising plenty of work at good wages, they set out on a perilous journey along that perennial American roadway Route 66.  Along the way they suffer mechanical trouble, family illness and outright hostility from people who despise them and call them \\"Oakies\\" (roughly the same as \\"white trash\\" or a Caucasian variant of the \\"n word.\\")<br /><br />Upon arriving in the Golden State they are soon disillusioned by what they encounter.  They are forced by corrupt police officers and hateful locals to move from one place to the next, sometimes not even allowed to get one night's sleep before being driven out.  At the same time they are economically exploited by the same people who persecute them.  They serve as cheap, disposable labor during harvest season.  There is one particularly poignant scene where a farmer yells \\"get out of here, you filthy Oakies.  You're not wanted!  And don't come back until the cotton needs picking!\\"<br /><br />The strength and resilience with which the Joads endure the almost endless horror and travail they face speaks to their strength and basic decency, as opposed to the \\"respectable\\" people, who are driven by hatred, prejudice and greed.  Steinbeck achieves a masterful level of social commentary in this powerful book.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />FURTHER COMMENTS WITH POSSIBLE SPOILERS<br /><br />On a more abstract level, The Grapes of Wrath is a powerful, affirmative answer to the question posed by Cain to God: \\"Am I my brother's keeper?\\"<br />Steinbeck believes that all of us are, and he drives this point home with force.<br /><br />His words drip with contempt as he writes about the morally degenerate condition of the wealthy land owners.  They dehumanize their workers, labeling them \\"Oakies,\\" by which they mean stupid, filthy, nearly worthless animals.  They fail to see the common humanity they share with these people, and through their blindness they lay up grapes of wrath in the souls of the oppressed.  In so doing they ensure that this righteous anger will one day drive the Oakies to revolt against them, raining every drop of the wine of vengenace down upon their heads.<br /><br />This theme is contrasted with another, more subtle one that pulses through the book: that all of humanity is one giant soul, as a character in the book phrases it, and the key to achieving justice is to act this principle out.  Hence, towards the end of the book, the Joad's concern for their own family grows to envelop the other migrant farm workers.  They see that they are all one, and the only way to achieve social justice is to take that truth and act on it by caring for each other's needs and standing united against their oppressors.<br /><br />The book ends on an inconclusive note.  Steinbeck never tells us what ultimately happens to these people, whom the reader has come to care about deeply by the novel's climax.  In the last scene Rose of Sharon, a migrant teenage girl who recently lost her baby, breast feeds a man who is starving to death.  There is no titillation in this scene, quite the opposite.  When read within the book's context it illustrates beautifully that Rose has learned the great lesson.  She knows that all of humanity is one, and must act as one, caring for each person as if they were her own flesh and blood.<br /><br />This ending provides the weary reader with a hopeful moment to end with, after traveling with these people through nearly 500 pages of despair.  Dismal, powerful, oddly inspiring and ultimately unforgettable, The Grapes of Wrath is a literary journey that none should miss.

Some of the song references were a little corny (i.e. the clerk saying \\"well I imagine that when I'm sixty-four....\\") but it made up by having a good storyline.
B001IUG3CU|5.0|I have listened to rock my whole life I am 50 AC/DC has always been a part of my music growth. I really dig the hard driving riffs it is truly what I look for in music.

B00007GZQZ|5.0|This is a very good early Tom Hanks movie. At times it tries to turn into a movie about relationships, but the best parts are the gags about the house that turns into a nightmare. There are scenes and lines that will have you laughing until you cry. It is definitely worth owning a copy of this on DVD. It's the kind of movie you can watch many times and still enjoy.
B001CD6FKI|3.0|Clearly, if the creators (The Wachowski brothers, directors of The Matrix) of the movie want you to remember anything about it- it's the BRIGHT COLORS.  This is movie making from the pages of a comic book, with the colors, acting and plot that this entails.  When it started, it was so garish and hyperkinetic that I prepared myself for the worst... however, I have to admit that as I watched it, it actually did start to suck me in to this bizarre pseudo reality, and I began rooting for Speed Racer (That's his name, not just his title..).  Speed Racer is the car obsessed son in the Racer family, his father the designer of racing cars.  When he starts performing in major races, a huge corporate sponsor woos him, but amazingly, it turns out that the big corporation has money, and not the best interests of the Racer Family, at heart.  A few chases later, via a mysterious ally, an uneasy alliance with a rival Japanese driver, and <ahem> ninjas, we reach the good versus bad confrontation.  Nothing about this is real - everything is hyper real in a calculated way - remember, this is adapted from a Japanese anime.  Yet the actors, even in a wide eyed cartoon style way, do gradually do make you accept they might just be believable.  Even if on the podium the winners drink a hyper white milk, rather than any other sparkling drinks...  The story linking the action scenes is actually passable, and is actually a welcome relief from the action scenes which could leave you woozy with an overdose of movement and primary colors which are pretty sickly after a while...just remember this is skewed young, yet the story does have a little depth for grown-ups too.  The gimmick here is the effects, and though the effect may not be to everyone's cup of tea, the effects are seamless.  This sort of cartoonish hyper reality may just be what cgi was meant for.  The movie as a whole is not a complete success.. that's for sure.  But neither is it a disaster.. this is at the very least innovative and imaginative cinema - you wont see another movie like Speed Racer this year, and the derision it received in some quarters smacks of close-mindedness.  So if you can stomach the nausea inducing frantic movement of bright pink and red and yellow, and want to see something a little different, then why not give it a shot?
B000274THQ|5.0|When I was about the same age as the main character in this film, I had a couple of East German pen pals and had the chance to visit them in East Germany about a year before the events of this movie. I was very interested in the topic of the movie. I like the portrayal of the different takes. You have the older people who miss some of the stability of their previous life, those who wouldn't necessarily go back but don't like all of the trappings of western society, and the young who adapt to western culture even though it isn't as perfect as it might have seemed. The premise of the story is interesting too. It's funny to see how the son tries to maintain the appearance of the old East Germany even as it slips away. The only thing I didn't like about the film is that by the end, the storyline seems to wander or get a bit old. Still, this is a great movie and something definitely a bit different if you are looking for a good foreign film.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I was quite excited when I heard about the concept of this; I will be honest and say that I really wanted to watch it because I'm a big fan of both NPH and Joss Whedan. I heard about the small budget (of course) and wanted to see what could be done with it; it was excellent.<br /><br />Naturally, since the four episodes totaled less than half an hour and the entire dvd spans about one hundred minutes, I have to think that the rest of the dvd is full of nothing but awesome. A commentary sing-along? That is unheard of and, most likely, incredible.<br /><br />I'd like to know more about the on-demand dvd-r aspect, though. Will it have the durability of commercial dvd-rs sold for home consumption or will the dvd-rs be better?
B00005S6K8|4.0|I have not seen the orginal version of this movie, so I cannot comment on this as a remake, but I do like this movie. There doesn't seem to be much chemisty between the two main characters, so when they fall in love, it doesn't seem that believable, but almost everything else about this film is engaging. It's an enjoyable movie to watch and most of the characters are interesting in their own right and well-played by the actors.
0316017922|4.0|For the most part, this book deals with some very successful people, and deconstructs the circumstances in their lives that lead them to where they are.  Gladwell argues that these people didn't succeed despite their backgrounds, but rather because of them.  He didn't convince me.<br />However, his discussion about why Southeast Asians are so much more adept at mathematics than Americans was compelling, as was his analysis of why our school year should be longer.  Educators should look at these chapters.<br />This book was all over the place.  Sometimes Gladwell spoke about individual's circumstances, sometimes about the circumstances of groups of people, and sometimes about whole cultures.  He even wrote about patterns of violence in Appalachia, and how they differed from violence in urban cities.  It seems whatever Gladwell finds interesting, he puts in his books, independently of the relevance to his subject matter, which in this case, purports to be the story of success.<br />I get a kick out of reading Gladwell's books, despite his lack of focus.
B001DELWZY|4.0|Four and 1/2 stars actually, if Amazon provided that option. The sets, costumes, conducting, and singing of Vargas and Frontali are as fine as the other commentators here have claimed them to be. I draw the line, though, at the raving over Gheorghiu. It's unusual ever to hear the role of Violetta sung anywhere near close to perfection, and one doesn't experience it, sorry to say, in Gheorghiu's performance. The role calls for a prima donna assoluta, and what may have been intended by this designation was that great rarity, a singer who combined the coloratura skills demanded in Act I with the large, warm body of tone called for in Acts II and III. The role calls, that is, for a Galli-Curci coupled with a Tebaldi. It is in the demands of Act I that Gheorghiu falls way short of ideal. Nobody, I believe, would seriously argue that her \\"Sempre Libera\\" in this performance is one of extraordinary brilliance. Though the emotional scene preceding it is convincing, the aria itself is marred by coloratura passages more gulped or yelped than beautifully or memorably sung. One can argue that the aria's concluding top note is only an option, but it doesn't follow that its absence is therefore not a disappointment, since it provides a perfect climax to the escalating, feverish energy coming just before it. It's been mentioned that Gheorghiu looks immodestly self-satisfied in the curtain calls after Act I. Unfortunately, I think there was at this point much for her to be modest about.   Happily, Gheorghiu does come into her own in Acts II and III, but her total performance, I'd argue, is not one for the history books. If hers is the best Violetta currently on DVD, so much the worse for the other recorded contemporary portrayers of the role.
020161622X|3.0|This is one of those books with a title that sparks your curiosity and eventually makes you get it. From the beginning, It seemed to me a bit weird because it's a kind of self-help manual for programmers. The book is well-written, easy to read and sometimes funny. However, the theme is too ambitious and that's why you feel a bit disapointed in the end. Its biggest mistake is that it promises more than it can deliver.    In a nutshell, \\"The Pragmatic Programmer\\" is a rundown of best practices that must command any software construction process. Eight chapters dedicated to common mistakes you must avoid, handy tools you should use in your daily-basis, testing policies, automatic builds, source-code control and so forth. It's plenty of quotes and truths such as: \\"Prototype to Learn\\", \\"Design with Contracts\\", \\"Work with a User to Think Like a User\\", etc.    In short, the book is a compilation of rules, patterns, practices, tips and tricks and lot of common sense. It could be useful for junior programmers, project managers that have never written a line of code and for all of those, so-called, \\"seniors\\" who have never read a book about software construction.    Pretty handy... but it's far away from [[ASIN:0735619670 The Holy Bible]].
B001HDO4Z6|1.0|This band completely lost focus since X&Y. All in all I feel that these songs would have worked fine as B-sides, and that they should be treated as such.    Life In Technicolor II: Part 1 IMO is better, all the freshness of part 1 is lost due to the horrible singing. It sounds patched and it doesn't flow well. The song tries hard to build up but never gets there.    Postcards From Far Away: This is OK for ENYA. Not much to say here     Glass Of Water; This is Viva la Vida (song) meets X&Y. It sounds weird, but after a few listens you get accustomed to it. I would say this is the highlight of this EP, but B-side material at most.      Rainy Day: Coldplay going techno. I really don't get this number. This is new in Coldplay's repertoir, and if this is the new direction Coldplay is about to make, well.....      Prospekt's March/Poppyfields; On first listen this sounded awfully familiar. Correct me if I'm wrong but ain't this melody taken from a song by Collective Soul?.      Lost+; Unlistenable. Same track as in Viva la Vida but with a bridge sung by rapper Jay Z. This type of song should never appear on a Coldplay CD, these are fine for radio or promo's but that's it.     Lovers In Japan (Osaka Sun Mix); Where's the change. The only differences I noticed were: 1- Reign of Love was cut off 2- Guitar seems to be louder in the chorus, besides that nothing new.     Now My Feet and Won't Touch The Ground: Is this \\"til kigndom come\\" alternate version?. This one is for those who loved til kingdom come, for those who didn't......deja vu, til kingdom with new lyrics.    This EP don't even come closer to Parachutes, AROBTH, and even X&Y's b-sides, this is very low quality material to Coldplay's standards.    Lyrics are not even worth mentioning.
B000068TPN|5.0|I ordered this DVD based on the praise in the reviews, because I wanted a DVD that showed how the the war in Vietnam with the North actually was.  I was not disappointed.  Mel Gibson, who played the part of Lt. Col Hal Moore did an excellent job.  And the Producers, and the Director, Randall Wallace, produced and directed an outstanding movie.  They did an excellent job of depicting the scenes as they actually happened, or as close as possible.  And the inclusion of the Wives and Families was a brilliant addition.  These Ladies need all the recognition they can get---they are too often neglected in movies and especially in real life.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love this album. I think the music fits the movie perfectly. And best of all this cd helped me discover some wonderful new bands. Especially Muse. I then bought their album as well.

B001DTPZNY|3.0|What a mess!  This movie is just totally ridiculous, from start to finish. Bad dialog, lots of pseudo-science, over-the-top acting -- \\"Crystal Skull\\" has it all. The CGI special effects are often impressive, but fail to make up for a weak, choppy story line and unbelievable action sequences. As just one small example of how implausible the action gets, the main characters often toss around the titular crystal skull as if it were a football, when a quartz object that size would weigh about 70 pounds! And then there are giant ants, gunpowder that is attracted to magnets, and a whole slew of other improbabilities. And the \\"happy ending\\" where Indy and Marion get [*******] is just too corny and contrived.<br /><br />I really wish they hadn't made this movie, as it cheapens the reputation of a great 1980s action trilogy. Just one more example of Hollywood sacrificing art for cash.
B0010KHOS0|5.0|I love this movie!! Joaquin Phoenix and Reese Witherspoon provide excellent performances. The screenplay is well written and the musical performances, performed by the actors, are authentic.
1400063515|5.0|Taleb's explanation/rationalization of risk and how it has failed to be fully accounted for in the financial markets is startling.  Going forward, as the current financial markets meltdown is (hopefully) resolved, all investors will want to consider Taleb's thoughts in developing strategies that will account for the the inevitable and unforeseeable outliers, Taleb's Black Swans, that are few but impossible to avoid.  Failure to plan for the outliers reduces investment and money management to high stakes roulette.      There are certainly many fine points in the book to argue and Taleb lacks neither ego, humor or irony in his writing.  This is not a technical manual for economists, but a narrative intended for the layman to illustrate the effects of risk, seen and unforeseen.      The importance of the book is the big picture concepts that are developed and their impact, which are conveyed meaningfully and often colorfully.  Nit picking the finer points is rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic.    This is a great volume to help understand where all our money went and how to minimize the possibility of a replay.

B001DTPZNY|2.0|Having watched this film for the first time on video recently, I am embarrassed to admit that I could have turned it off at any point with little loss or consequence, but did not.  Instead, I plodded my way to the silly end in this plastic film devoid of character or anything more engaging than the D-typical action fare by way of plot.  Plastic best describes it.  Cardboard characters lacking story, history, or engaging personality.  A plot so surface that I couldn't even be bothered to conjecture what might come next - essential activity for suspense.  A set that seemed plastic with effects that were uninspiring as well.  At the end of this film I cared a great deal more for the two hours I willfully wasted on it than the five measly dollars down the tubes.  If you appreciate the one life you have to get by on, you might want to leave this diversion out of your path.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|This is supposed to be a musical comedy and it was, so the goal was reached. I'm not a fan of ABBA, but I don't hate their music... besides, it represents a generation, let's say it's part of history.  The situations together with lyrics were appropiated, on time... a pretty smart combination.  The performers had fun doing this movie and this is exported towards the audience you can notice that, you can feel it, just that fact makes you laugh and somehow be part of that experience. Watch the movie without prejudice and you will enjoy it... I'm definetely buying the DVD.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|I can't seem to stop listening to this new album by David Cook.  It is all that I had hoped for from this artist.  There is not a bad song on the album.  I have a new favorite musician to add to my personal list.<br /><br />One note: One of the tracks is 15 minutes long.  It contains two songs, one at the beginning and another at the end of the track.  It took me a week to figure out how to configure itunes and my ipod so that I could easily listen to the hidden track \\"Kiss on the Neck\\".  So if you get an album like this, it is not a \\"bad album\\", you just need to remove the dead space between the songs via your options menu.

Listening to it prior to seeing the movie was really cool because I got to listen for the tracks to see how they helped tell the story.  Stephenie Meyer is spot on with her interpretations via music and this movie was scored perfectly.  It introduced new bands and different music genres that were previously unbeknownst to me.  I LOVE THIS CD and highly recommed it.

0810995212|4.0|Like many other reviewers, I have been waiting for a book like this for years. And, like them, I am both thrilled and disappointed. While this is one of the most comprehensive collections of Leyendecker illustrations ever to see print, and worth the price of the book alone, the text is severely wanting. The book is full of errors, both minor and major, and has an antagonistic tone to boot.    An example of the former is the claim that the actor Neil Hamilton, \\"appeared AS `Tarzan the Ape Man' (1934).\\" This, of course, should read that he appeared IN \\"Tarzan the Ape Man\\" (1932). (\\"Tarzan and His Mate,\\" in which Hamilton also appeared, again not as Tarzan, was released in `34).     Examples of the later would be any mention of other illustrators, about whom they usually have some snarky comment to make. A particular amount of vitriol is spewed on to Norman Rockwell, whom they portray as the most contemptible of human beings.     This is frankly a disturbing trend in a lot of books. (witness the James Bama book \\"American Realist\\" and \\"Excess- the art of Michael Golden\\" for other examples) It seems that it is no longer enough to present an artist works and plead his case, but one must also denigrate and dismiss that artist contemporaries and rivals. If one wishes to bash artist such as Cole Phillips and Rockwell, and Leyendecker's brother and sister too boot, there are plenty of other places to do so. Is it really necessary to do such in a Leyendecker biography?    Also be aware that the authors lay much of the 20th centuries iconography at Leyendecker's feet. They exaggeratingly claim that J.C. is responsible for everything from giving flowers to mom on mother day, playing football on Thanksgiving, inspiring the novel \\"the Great Gatsby,\\" and much more. It's one thing to laud your heroes accomplishments, quite another to exaggerate them.    By all means, buy the book. But do so for the pretty pictures, not the text.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|I have always been a big fan of The Nightmare Before Christmas and owned it for years on DVD. Having said that, the difference between the DVD and Blu Ray are tremendous.

0061537934|5.0|I'm a dog lover who is almost always disappointed in \\"dog books,\\" but all the 5 star ratings got me to give this novel a shot. It did not disappoint. The story of Denny, a struggling race car driver and his wife and young daughter is one that drew me in even without the dog element. That this was comically and touchingly narrated by Enzo, their dog, made this an even better and more original book. This novel does not strive to capture how dogs really see their world (as happens in Edgar Sawtelle), but this is how dog owners like to think of their dogs as perceiving their world. The narration is done with just the right amount of heart and humor. This novel takes a major turn halfway through, suddenly becoming plot driven. At first I was bothered by this, but it ultimately worked and added to the story. Overall, this is a sweet, funny novel. It's not great literature, but I really enjoyed this novel and was sad when it was done.

014043786X|5.0|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle (1859-1930) wanted to be known for his serious fiction and journalism. History, however, awards its literary plaudits to the good doctor for his immortal literary detective Sherlock Holmes and his bumbling sidekick Dr. John H. Watson. Doyle wrote 54 Holmes short stories and four novellas on the most famous consulting detective in all of world literature.<br />  The Hound of the Baskervilles was published in serial parts in the Strand Magazine from August 1901 through April 1902. It is his most famous work worthy of its acclaim<br />  The story involves Herny Baskerville who has inherited a large fortune and vast estate in Dorset. His friend Dr. Mortimer visits Holmes and Watson at 221B Baker Street to tell them that Baskerville is frightened of a huge fiendish hound said to roam over Grimpen moor. Ever since one of Henry's ancestors was killed by a large dog following a maiden's seduction it is believed that the Baskerville's are cursed by the fiendish monster mongrel.<br />  Holmes and Watson arrive in Dartmoor to investigate. while Holmes returns to London it is left to Dr. Watson to record the happenings at Baskerville Hall. Doyle has Watson speak through a journal he keeps while a guest of Sir. The plot is gothic horror, suspense fiction and love story all entwined in a delicious plot. There is even quicksand to trap hapless victims of Grimpen. The scenes remind one of the Wasteland imagery of a TS Eliot who was enamored of this great story. Freudian and psychological interpreters have had a field day with this one!<br />  There are many interesting characters in the case. Selden an escaped convict from the nearby prison; Stapleton the lover of butterflys and his supposed sister Beryl. Murder occurs as the savage beast is on the prowl. The mysterey is intricately plotted and there are many surprises. One of life's joys is to read this novella for the first time! Doyle is a master of evoking a chilly, creepy atmosphere filled with fog, rain and fear on the prowl. The novella is superior to any film version ever made of this classic work<br />  Doyle was an Edwardian gentleman who loved nature, spiritualism and hiking. He also was an excellent stylist who will keep your interest as Holmes unweaves the complex tale. The Hound of the Baskervilles is masterful, suspensful and worthy of your time. The story can be read and re-read for a lifetime of enjoyment. It is short requiring only a few hours nestled near a fireplace on a winter's night. Enjoy!the prowl.

However with Halo 3 composers Martin O'Donnell and Michael Salvatori seemed to have had a bigger budget and were able to hire a larger orchestra. Here they brought back some of the familiar tracks and tweaked them producing an outstanding soundtrack seem fit for the most successful and recognised video game in history, the unforgettable Halo 3.<br /><br />Here the content is presented on two great discs, disc one containg 15 tracks and disc two containing 16 tracks. If you enjoyed Halo 3 then I recommend that you grab the soundtrack to relive those great memories of when you fought for mankind.

I have no interest in the opinions of others about the movie prior to watching the movie.

B001H5X7I4|4.0|Tropic Thunder is one of the best movies of 2008 that I had a ball watching. There are some of Hollywood's best actors in Tropic Thunder to include Robert Downey Jr., who is nearly unrecognizable as Australian actor, Kirk Lazarus, playing African American, Sgt. Osiris, where he has dyed his skin dark and doesn't break away from the character throughout the whole movie. Everyone has talked about Heath Ledger's incredible and mind blowing role as The Joker in The Dark Knight, but Robert Downey Jr. also deserves a lot of praise, and a possible Oscar award nomination for best acting in this role. Surprisingly, Tom Cruise steps out of his comfort zone playing a fat, balding, cursing, movie studio executive, Les Grossman, who steals every scene he is in. Also along for this crazy ride is Jack Black, a drug addicted comedy actor, and Matthew McConaughey, who plays Ben Stiller's agent, and is extremely funny as he is gorgeous. I usually find Ben Stiller a bit annoying in his roles, but here he perfectly embodies the role he is playing, Tugg Speedman, a washed up action star.<br /><br />Tropic Thunder is about making a movie based on the Vietnam War. The director, Steve Coogan is fed up with his whiny, egotistical actors, and with the help of Nick Nolte, who plays the Vietnam vet the movie is based on, drop the actors in the middle of the jungle to fend for themselves. That is where the fun really begins. Jack Black runs out of heroin, or jelly beans as he calls them, and starts going through detox. Plus, the actors find themselves in the territory of a heroin-producing Vietcong gang, but don't think any of that is real because they still think they are filming the movie.<br /><br />There are not many comedies like Tropic Thunder that can make me laugh so hard that my stomach hurts. There are also some shockingly funny scenes such as Ben Stiller killing a panda bear and wearing the panda head on his own head because he has gone crazy ala Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now.<br /><br />Or the conversation Kirk and Tugg have about why Forest Gump and Rain Man did so well for those actors playing mentally handicapped roles, but because Ben played a role where he went full out \\"retard\\", it was meant to bomb:<br /><br />Kirk Lazarus: Everybody knows you never go full retard.<br />Tugg Speedman: What do you mean?<br />Kirk Lazarus: Check it out.

B0018M6J90|4.0|Miss Pettigrew Lives For a Day is a delightful movie that is part 1940's screwball comedy, part fairy tale. THis movie has two great actresses, Amy Adams, who is simply adorable, and Frances McDormand, who is one of the best actresses in Hollywood today. Both these women shine in every movie they are in and Miss Pettigrew Lives For a Day is no exception.<br /><br />Synopsis: In 1939 London, Miss Guinevere Pettigrew is a middle-aged governess who finds herself once again unfairly dismissed from her job. Without so much as severance pay, Miss Pettigrew realizes that she must for the first time in two decades seize the day. This she does, by intercepting an employment assignment outside of her comfort level as social secretary. Arriving at a penthouse apartment for the interview, Miss Pettigrew is catapulted into the glamorous world and dizzying social whirl of an American actress and singer, Delysia Lafosse . Within minutes, Miss Pettigrew finds herself swept into a heady high-society milieu and, within hours, living it up. Taking the social secretary designation to heart, she tries to help her new friend Delysia navigate a love life and career, both of which are complicated by the three men in Delysias orbit; devoted pianist Michael, intimidating nightclub owner Nick, and impressionable junior impresario Phil. Miss Pettigrew herself is blushingly drawn to the gallant Joe a successful designer who is tenuously engaged to haughty fashion maven Edythe the one person who senses that the new social secretary may be out of her element, and schemes to undermine her. Over the next 24 hours, Guinevere and Delysia will empower each other to discover their romantic destinies.<br /><br />My take on this movie, is pretty much the ugly duckling that becomes a beautiful swan fairy tale. When we first see Miss Pettigrew, she is very down since she has been let go of yet another governess position. She looks very dowdy, wearing an ill-fitting brown outfit, no makeup and looks very depressed and rejected. The firm that placed her in the position, and many others like it, has given up on her and tell her there is nothing more they can do for her. She is a failure. Miss Pettigrew has no money or home, and since she has no other skills to recommend her, she will be quite destitute. Because Miss Pettigrew has no other choice, she pretends to be the social secretary to a young American singer, Delysia who has requested one from Pettigrew's old firm. Miss Pettigrew is in for quite a handful with Delysia, who is juggling three different men to get what she wants. You would think Delysia would be the one character I wouldn't care for because she lies quite well and is deceitful, but since Amy Adams plays her with such flighty innocence, you come to adore her. Delysia helps Miss Pettigrew see how special and beautiful she is, even though she may not look it. Delysia, along with her friend Edythe, played by another wonderful actress, Shirley Henderson, transforms Miss Pettigrew into an attractive and fashionable woman. Edythe expects a thank you from Miss Pettigrew, and wants her to talk some sense into her ex-fianc&eacute;, the dashing Joe, played by Ciaran Hinds, who is a fashion designer.<br /><br />Miss Pettigrew has a skill in handling touchy situations and people listen to her when she talks. She tries to give Delysia advice about love and life even though Pettigrew is a bit sheltered in those aspects. Plus, Pettigrew has fallen in love with Joe, who certainly does not belong with Edythe because Edythe is a nasty sort. But since she knows a major secret about Miss Pettigrew, that could ruin everything, Edythe blackmails Pettigrew into getting her way.<br /><br />I am a big fan of period pieces and Miss Pettigrew Lives For a Day is definitely one of them. There is a bit of zaniness and comedy mixed in with a lovely romance. The costumes of the World War II era were fabulous and the singing talents of Amy Adams shine here just as much as she did playing Giselle in the movie Enchanted. And don't forget the incredible acting of Frances McDormand. Because of Frances, she makes this movie truly wonderful. This is an overall feel good movie that made me believe in hope and love. Miss Pettigrew Lives For a Day is a one gem of a movie you don't want to miss.<br /><br />Katiebabsdon't forget the incredible acting of Frances McDormand.

B001EO2UJK|5.0|Reading all of the reviews I decided to test this new Genesis remix myself using state of the art equipment. It did sound different! But then I thought, when Nick Davis did a playback what were the exact conditions? So I spent a good deal of time and money and found out this. What the exact temperature in the studio was. The air pressure and the altitude, also the phase the moon was in. Once I put this in my computer and recalibrated for the conditions in which Nick Davis herd playback all sounded great. Also use a tube amplifier unless you live in Arkansas.

006135323X|5.0|Predictably Irrational is one book that satisfies so many audiences that it is simply amazing, and it does an awesome job at that. Without delving into the research that Dan Ariely and his group of eminent researchers/friends have carried out - that would take away the fun of discovering some of the insights presented in the book - I must say that the book had great appeal for me as a business-person, as a family man & parent and as a person living in society at large. It has some very important implications for people working in government who are responsible for policy-making and for individuals who wish to avoid making mistakes they could've been making repeatedly. In all honesty, my behaviour has changed in some measure after reading this book and I think the results that I can monitor in the short-term, are positive. A really, really good book!!!
B001C46P2A|4.0|In an epic turn for Baz Luhrmann, he doesn't disappoint his audience, but he is no longer able to knock his viewers off their feet either. The movie is spectacular and must be watched on the big screen and, yet, I have reservations recommending it outright. It's a longer film, clocking in at over 2 and 3/4 hours. The beginning of the film is intense and captivating and the movie could've easily been about the first part of the film. However, Baz isn't the one to give in to traditional formula and standard filmmaking, and goes on to expand the story and layer it with more magnificence and historical backdrop. The movie is visually stunning in its cinematography and costume design (as is to be expected from a Luhrmann production) and the cast is good to look at it too. Casting is particularity well chosen and both Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman act with grace and intelligence and ease. Kidman's performance will be recognized mightily come awards time, but it is Brandon Walters (in his debut role as Nullah, the character who represents the movie's main subplot of the Stolen Generation) who steals the show. Overall, this is atypical Lurhmann film, but it's also atypical Hollywood film and it's this unusual quality that makes it not only unique but highly watchable and immensely entertaining (and not for everyone).
B00005JPO1|3.0|Qualifying as gleeful entertainment, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull definitely doesn't come close to the greatness achieved by the first three Indy flicks, but it isn't nearly as bad as many have claimed it to be either.  Harrison Ford makes a triumphant return to his defining role as the fedora wearing, whip wielding adventurer; who is coerced by a young greaser named Mutt (Shia LaBeouf) into taking a trip to Peru to rescue his mother (Raiders of the Lost Ark love interest Karen Allen) and friend (John Hurt) who knows the secrets of the fabled Crystal Skull.  With a team of Soviets (led by Cate Blanchett) hot on his tail as well, the aging Indy certainly has his hands full.  The biggest flaw of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is that it is ever so predictable.  Any of the big twists, revelations, or surprises you will see coming a mile away; and the biggest plot element of all is so weakly inserted here that you'll wonder just what it's doing in an Indiana Jones movie.  Still though, there's just something about the film that still makes it worth seeing regardless, with spectacular stunt work and action sequences, and the fact that Ford still stands tall as one of the best screen heroes in all of cinema history.  All in all, despite its many flaws, Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an enjoyable romp that many will no doubt be split on, but in the end, seeing Indy back in action is reason enough to celebrate.

1401923119|4.0|This book came promptly, I have heard much of it and can't wait to read it.
0575081406|4.0|Now, this was a very uniquely written book.  In the beginning, I wasn't sure I was going to like...especially when it switched direction on me, without much warning.  I almost stopped reading it entirely.<br />However, I decided to give it a chance for a while, and went with it.  And was pleasantly surprised.  I enjoyed the story, and got into the flow of it as the author's revelations continued.  And he does a good job of building a solid foundation and setting you up for the next book in the series.  I also enjoyed the variety of characters, settings, and dialogue.<br />The story follows the telling of the main's character's, Kvothe, story, to two men, a man who wishes to write about him...the Chronicler, and  Kvothe's student/companion, Bast.  The story is filled with adventure as Kvothe attends the University, tries to keep his building debts paid off somehow, attempts to keep tabs on a girl he's interested in, and strives to find the murderers of his family...who oh by the way aren't human.<br />I wouldn't compare this book to any other trilogy, because if you expect to read this, thinking it will be like an adored fantasy series, you'd probably be sorely disappointed.  I would agree that it is different, in the style of the author's writing, and in how the story unfolds.<br />I look forward to reading the next installment.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|The third (and final???) installment of the Bourne series once again finds Paul Greengrass at the helm which means we are in capable hands.  Matt Damon reprises his role as Jason Bourne, the CIA-trained assasin who is struggling to put together the pieces of his past which have been shrouded in mystery ever since the first installment.<br /><br />Greengrass' \\"shaky cam\\" approach lends the film a thrilling sence of urgency and tension.  We feel right there in the thick of the action with Jason Bourne as he dodges CIA operatives who are out to kill him on his trek home to New York City where he was trained and hopes to unlock the mystery of who he truly is.<br /><br />This is easily the best installment of the series.  The action is relentless from the beginning and even when the movie slows down to catch its breath, the tension can still be felt.  There is an absolutely amazing figh scene between Bourne and a fellow agent that concludes in a bathroom with a towel being used as the weapon of choice.  I won't say any more about that.  There is also a pulse pounding car chase sequence near the end of the film that begins, yes...begins, with a car being driven off the roof of a parking garage.<br /><br />Of course all of this action, as thrillingly filmed as it is, would mean nothing if the film didn't have a human heart.  Matt Damon's performance as Bourne is wrought with emotion and remorse.  You can feel the regret, sorrow, loss and anger in even the subtlest of actions.  His character's inner torment is written all over his face.<br /><br />When the film finally arrives at it's conclusion, it manages to pull off a unique feat:  it provides a satisfying sense of closure even as it completely alters our perception of Bourne and opens up a whole new series of questions about what made him who he is.  This movie ultimately does what any great movie does:  it leaves us immensely satisfied even while we want more.  Although in this case, knowing less about the central figure may be the best way to wrap up the series.o wrap up the series.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|If you wish Lon Chaney were still alive and acting, or that he could have tried to sing a little bit when he was, this is the film for you. The sets and costumes are opulent, the casting is spot-on and the effects are dazzling. Most of all, the film owes its brilliance to the dark genius of Tim Burton. This is the film he was born to make! Oh, and don't fear the ghoulish aspects you might have heard about - this film offers plenty of humor.
B0006L0LOS|3.0|------------------------------------<br />Catwoman: Time to accessorize!<br />=======================================================<br /><br />Catwoman was a box office bomb, and it also won a Razzie award for Halle Berry, which she accepted in person. The 'award' was for worst couple, shared with either of her costars--Sharon Stone or Benjamin Bratt. As much as I'd like to see Stone and Berry coupling, their hook up was more along the lines of hero and villain. Darn. Bratt, on the other hand, plays a cop who is fascinated by both Patience Philips AND Catwoman. Obviously he was cast more for his looks than his acting or ability to convincingly portray a cop. As Lance, Patience's colleague at the Beauty Products company proclaims when he pays Patience a visit:<br /><br />-----------------------<br />Lance: Hey! Man sandwich! Twelve o'clock!<br />====================================<br /><br />Benjamin has played similar roles in 'Miss Congeniality' with Sandra Bullock--where they were both cops and with Madonna as a yoga instructor in 'The Next Best Thing.' Bratt even won another Razzie for 'The Next Best Thing'--also for worst couple. In his defense I'd have to say that matching him with the Halle cat is not this movie's biggest problem. In fact, I have no problem whatsoever with the Bratt/Berry match.<br /><br />The problem with this movie is the writing. A real stupid script that makes no sense, and fails to create a compelling vision that might have made the audience forgive its lack of sense. Catwoman might have worked as a fable, with the mysterious character of Ophelia and her cats, especially Midnight, the Egyptian Mau, as a kind of witch's familiar. 'Edward Scissorhands' certainly doesn't make sense, but in the world that Tim Burton creates, it works as a fable, and we've never metaphor we didn't like. For another instance, in Jean Cocteau's Beauty and the Beast when the Beast kills a bird and eats it smoke comes out of the poor bird. This makes no literal sense, but in the poetic, dream like fable, it makes perfect sense. 'Catwoman' was a character out of the Batman story, but in this movie there was no attempt to tie it in. Then they make her back story, and it is a stupid one for the kind of movie it could have been. Actually, I've seen Halle in this exact same situation, but in a different movie where her character worked. 'Boomerang' had her as a graphic artist somewhat oblivious to fashion though she worked at a beauty products company. I would be feeling that deja vu, except that in 'Catwoman' that character doesn't work.<br /><br />I can see what they were trying to do, Patience Philips, someone who does what she's told, suffers those of lesser talent ordering her around; until she becomes Catwoman, and is empowered. But really, the whole Beauty Products mogul as villain making the evil corporate face cream--please.<br /><br />Still, Halle Berry looked great in her leather cat suit, and I think that she did a great job with what she had to work with. She threw herself into the role, and really was the feral feline the role requires.<br /><br />------------------------<br />Catwoman: White Russian, no ice, no vodka... hold the Kahlua.<br />=======================================================<br /><br />Perhaps French director Pitof bit off more than he could chew (sorry, with a French director pretentious enough to go by a single name the pun temptation was irresistible). I heard that he turned in a script that he wrote with another writer that took a more artistic approach, but the producers didn't think it would be commercial enough. So, let's give him the benefit of the doubt, because it seems hard to believe that his artistic approach could be any worse than the final product was.<br /><br />Sharon Stone can share some of the blame for the fiasco that was 'Catwoman.' It seems like her character was supposed to make a statement about how the fashion world, and Hollywood, too, treats women once they are past a certain age:<br /><br />----------------------------------<br />Laurel Hedare: I was everything they wanted me to be. I was never more beautiful. Never more powerful. And then I turned 40 and they threw me away.<br />=======================================================<br /><br />But you might say that she just rested on her Laurel.

0316017922|5.0|Not necessary so says Malcom Gladwell. Then what is it? Try 10,000 hours of perserverance, and the more of those hours you can get in a week the sooner it will happen. On average, about ten years. Does anyone in your life come to mind. How about that new employee that doesn't know right from left. Remember when you were there? And what happened to you after ten years on the job? Or, how about the success stories of the ones you thought wouldn't make it, that you heard about at your last class re-union. Look at Tiger Woods for example. You think he just walked on the golf course yesterday and started shooting birdies? I once told a father of a new born son. \\"You want that kid to have a college scholarship\\"? Just have him kick a foot ball every day beginning at age six.\\" Remember the recent story of a walk on field goal kicker? I think Malcolm has something to say, and I'm glad he wrote about it. So now I can pass it on, and say,\\"You see, I told you so!\\"

0440237688|5.0|I read this book twice.  The first time, I read it in one night, which I rarely do.  The second time, I finished it in two nights.  It's basically about a 12-year-old boy named Jonas who lives in a perfect world.  There is no crime, no poverty, no illness.  Everyone is happy and all is well.  Then he and his friends are given their careers.  Jonas gets the job of retaining memories of how things used to be--before the world became a perfect place to live.  He visits an old man called \\"The Giver\\" who is the one who gives Jonas the memories.  Over time, as Jonas receives these memories, his entire view of the world changes as he learns what is real and what he has been taught.  For example, he starts to see color.  Apparently, this peaceful, ideal world is in black and white.  I thought this was a fantastic idea.  Then Jonas stopped taking pills that he, his friends, and adults take.  These pills inhibit sexual desire.  In fact, no one has sex.  There are birth mothers who carry babies and that is how the human race continues.  Well, when Jonas stops taking these pills, he starts getting these desires, such as falling in love with his childhood girl friend.  He also recalls pain, illness and war.  So it's not all pleasant stuff that he's being taught.<br /><br />This book is actually more gloomy than books I typically read but the author did a terrific job of pulling me into Jonas' world and I had to keep wondering what was going to happen next.  Some of it made me cry.  *spoiler alert* He discovers that babies who aren't developing normally are euthanized and when the elderly reach a certain age, they are euthanized as well. But you see, the people in this world are told that the babies are going to another family and that the elderly are having a big party before they head off somewhere else.  It is Jonas' love that develops for the baby his father brought home to nuture (because the baby wasn't developing normally--he had delays in his development) that leads Jonas to run away with the baby before the baby can be euthanized.  Well, Jonas manages to escape with the baby and he's searching for the place where people will be like him (now that he's changed).  The final thing Jonas experiences (after who knows how long he's been gone) is sledding down a hill at Christmas time and looking into the window of a house where a Christmas tree is hung and there is a fire in the fireplace and there's love and happiness.  Then the author makes it clear that this is a memory that he dies remembering.  Very sad.  I still get teary when I remember it because I really wanted Jonas and the baby to make it.<br /><br />Now on the flip side, it wasn't a completely sad ending.  When Jonas escaped, the memories he contained \\"leaked out\\" and the people began to remember these things as well.  The book ends with the people coming to the Giver and wanting to know what to do about these memories, some good, some bad.  The problem with the perfect world was that people lost their humanity.  Even though pain is part of the human experience, good emotions are part of it too, and to give up the bad, they had to give up the good.  Love and compassion seemed  to be the thing these people needed the most, and at last, they will get it back.away with the baby before the baby can be euthanized.

B00000JCEC|4.0|Ringo's solo carrier started out as great as the other ex-Beatles. By December 1973 he had his second #1 hit, more than John at the time. Add to that his concerts were as big if not bigger than the other ex-Beatles. Ringo's ex-Beatles hugh success suprized some and satified others.<br /><br />However, during the second half of the 70s he began making one poor album after other. By the 80s it appeared that Ringo didn't care or was just tired of the music buisness. Perhaps his poor recordings in the late 70s and early 80s was because the Beatles \\"Apple\\" recording sudio died. Whatever the reason, Ringos post-Apple albums were bad. This was sad to many because he could do so much better.<br /><br />Ringo stopped making studio ablums after two trash releases in the early 80s. This was a good! It was also good that he concentrated on concerts and helping other musicians through the 80s and into the 90s. This seemed to be a recharging time for Ringo. Yet, many were like me, a fan who had written Ringo off as a has been.<br /><br />Then came the 1992 \\"Time Takes Time\\" album. Wow! What a way to come back. It was the best Ringo album since the 1973 \\"Ringo\\". \\"Time Takes Time\\" produced no hits, and had moderate sales. Yet, it is an excellent collection.<br /><br />\\"Time Takes Time\\" is well worth the money, if you can find it. The CDs aren't produced anymore. Try finding it as a MP3. Even if your not a Ringo fan you'll like the songs on \\"Time Takes Time\\".<br /><br />The question is, why did Ringo wait so long to come out with another studio album after such a good collection in \\"Time Takes Time\\"? Perhaps the title gives us a clue.<br /><br />Ringo's next studio album was the 1998 \\"Vertical Man\\", and it was a step above \\"Time Takes Time\\". In fact \\"Vertical Man\\" was better than all previous Ringo studio ablums! It received great reviews and claimed high sales.<br /><br />But wait, just when \\"Vertical Man\\" was declared the best Ringo collection of songs, Ringo released an even better collection, the 2003 \\"Ringorama\\". If you want to hear some of the best Ringo's songs, get \\"Ringorama\\"!<br /><br />\\"Choose Love\\" came out two years later and it proved as good if not better than \\"Ringorama.\\" It too claims some of Ringo's best recordings. The DVD that comes with it is also great.<br /><br />In 2008 Ringo released \\"Liverpool 8\\". By \\"Liverpool 8\\" Ringo was way beyond a come back that was started with \\"Time Takes Time\\". Let's hope that Ringo doesn't wait so long to come out with another studio collection.r some of the best Ringo's songs, get \\"Ringorama\\"!    \\"Choose Love\\" came out two years later and it proved as good if not better than \\"Ringorama.\\" It too claims some of Ringo's best recordings.

B00002MZ2C|3.0|Had it not been for the strange covers release following, TBOLA would have been a good enough last release for this trailblazing group. It sounds like their most accessible, least antagonistic work, breaking down the uniquely aggressive rap-rock dynamic into almost an exact science, leaving a flabby midsection which negates that added spark of rawness which truly brilliant Rage tracks always teetered against. Even so, Morello and friends can do no worse then offer a perfectly solid release of standardized Rage mechanics.
B00005EAXF|5.0|This dvd was awesome. The music clips were well documented, and so were the band interviews. Can't get enough of it. Would have to say it is one of my favorite music dvds. I also recommend Moment of Glory dvd for all Scorpions fans. It is also a must have.
B001KQKC0Q|1.0|First let me start by saying that i am (or was) a huge fan of Nickelback. Next, let me say that this is worse than listening to the backstreet boys. The only good song was gotta be somebody, which i got as a single before the album was even released. Almost every other song is literally gay. All it's talking about it sex, which i wouldn't mind, except for the fact it sounds like it was made for [...]. When did they turn into teletubbies??? Something is wrong here, the Nickelback I know and love would never release an album as terrible as this!
0618918248|3.0|I was looking forward to a well-reasoned argument by Richard Dawkins' demonstrating that the existence of God is \\"unlikely\\".  No such argument exists in this book.    Dawkins' description of how a combination of evolution, many planets, and possibly many universes can explain creation is quite worthy.  It was fascinating and fun to read how all of pieces of the puzzle might fit together.      However, Dawkins argument attempting to demonstrate that the existence of God is unlikely was quite flawed.  Essentially, he commits a fallacy similar to those with which he browbeats his competition.  Having no knowledge or evidence of the nature of God, he concluded that God is complex, very complex!  Why?  Just because, apparently.  That's not the only flaw in Dawkins' reasoning.      It was also kind of creepy when he constantly referred to the study of evolution as \\"consciousness raising\\".
B000QQH4YS|5.0|Some extra features on the making of the film with Peter Weller, Nancy Allen, etc.  Still a wild ride of a film all these years later.  Alot of Phil Tippets stop-motion effects would be CGI today.  This edition contains both the original theatrical edition and the extended unrated version.  The later is considerably more violent -- particularly in the scene where Boddicker's men shoot up Murphy.  Nice performances by Weller (who is now a professor of Roman history at the University of Syracuse, NY), Nancy Allen, Kurtwood Smith (Red on THAT 70'S SHOW) as the utterly vile Clarence Boddicker, Ray Wise, Ronny Cox -- in the first several coporate villain roles he would play like TOTAL RECALL -- and Miguel Ferrer.
B001ED7C58|2.0|This is a very average soundtrack that include none of the score of the movie Twilight.

I accidentally purchased this piece of average junk of iTunes and have been regretting it ever since.
B001GQACGO|3.0|Beyonce really took a huge risk on this album.  The average Beyonce fan won't \\"get\\" the music on the I Am... side of the album; and I'm not sure that fans of electronica and acoustic music will be willing to embrace her either, given that she is such a mainstream star.<br /><br />She released two of the most-commercially viable songs in \\"Single Ladies\\" and \\"If I Were a Boy\\".  There are not too many other songs on the album that are appropriate to be released as radio singles.  It's doubtful that her base of urban radio will play most of these songs and pop stations probably won't either.  I think at this point Beyonce is so successful (and possibly bored) that she is singing songs for herself and not the masses.  She understandably has to challenge herself and grow as a woman and an artist, but unfortunately, this album is not a recipe for continued success.  Not to say that the songs on the album are bad, it's simply that electronica and acoustic-styled music is not mainstream and is very hard to find on the radio, and thus people, particularly Beyonce fans, aren't used to it.<br /><br />Anyway, I agree with the 3.5-star average rating that this album has gotten.  Part of that star rating is due to the fact that you cannot ignore her extraordinary talent as a true singer, and not a \\"studio voice\\".<br /><br />The songs I LOVE are \\"Smash Into You\\" (hands-down my favorite song on the album... maybe my favorite song ever by Beyonce), \\"Single Ladies\\", \\"If I Were A Boy\\", \\"Ave Maria\\", and \\"That's Why You're Beautiful\\".  I also like \\"Satellites\\", \\"Ego\\", \\"Hello\\", \\"Halo\\" and a couple others.  However, this isn't an album I can listen to repeatedly from beginning to end though like I could with the Dangerously In Love and B-Day albums.  I'm a huge fan though, and it will be interesting to see what she does on future albums.

1433502410|4.0|The ESV Study Bible is probably the best study Bible that I've ever owned or used.  The ongoing outlines, topical notes, and tables listing other relevant items on a particular topic are very helpful.  For want of an easy way to describe it, the scholarship is conservative, orthodox, reformed, and evangelical.  Great resource.    That being said, the physical form this book takes leaves a little to be desired.  The book is the largest personal Bible I've ever seen.  Thick and heavy, but I guess that's because of all the info.  But the way it's bound, with narrow margins, and a binding that causes the pages to crinkle in the seam, makes it feel crowded and oversized.  Larger margins and a good binding would have been nice.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|There is no question this album is one of McCartney's most unique.  However, it finds him up to some of his usual tricks:  Backwards masking and messages, unusual instruments, clever harmonies, brilliant melodies, wicked bass & guitar work, and all the elements that made his contribution to the Beatles so powerful.  Listen to this album with headsets on and marvel at the creativity in the production and all of the unique elements going on in the mix. There are sound effects and wildly bizzare elements going on all over the place. What makes McCartney such a brilliant composer is that he paints his portrait with his music...  Melodies flow from him like a waterfall and those who know what it takes to make a good record are left wondering how one man could have accomplished such a large body of work in one lifetime.  This is a must have album for all Macca fans...or those looking to hear something different that changes from song to song and sounds like nothing you've ever heard before.  Prepare to be shocked...in a very good way.
B001H5X7JS|4.0|Tropic Thunder is a hiliarious satire of Hollywood. Unfortunately, the extras that are provided with this DVD aren't worth the extra disk enclosed. After viewing the missing and extended scenes, I'm happy that the director chose to remove those parts from the film; they didn't add to the storyline. All-in-all, happy I purchased the DVD.
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|WANTED stars James McAvoy (I guess Shia Lebouf wasn't available?) as Wesley, a down on his luck guy who works at a dead end job, has a girlfriend that cheats on him, and has no money to his name. Just when he's reached the end of his rope, he's recruited by a mysterious woman named Fox (Angelina Jolie) to join an elite group of assassins called \\"The Fraternity\\". It's revealed that Wesley's estranged father was a member of The Fraternity and one of the top assassins who, ironically, was killed by a rogue Fraternity member who left the group. Under the guidance of Fox, Fraternity leader Sloan (Morgan Freeman), and a few other characters, Wesley undergoes intense and brutal training in order to harness the inherited assassin-like characteristics that were genetically passed on to him by his father. The ultimate goal: to find the man who killed his father and avenge his death.<br /><br />The premise sounds really cool, but when I first saw the trailer for this movie it automatically had two BIG strikes against it. One being Angelina Jolie who I absolutely can't stand and the other being the shots of bullets moving in slow motion and apparently curving around objects to hit a target that's hidden in the background. Personally, slow motion bullets annoy the hell out of me. I know, it's weird and I really can't explain it. Maybe because of the fact of how RIDICULOUS it looks! How about slow motion brains coming out of someone's skull AFTER the bullet hits it? Now that would be cool. So anyway, with the two strikes against it back when it was in theaters, that meant only one thing... wait 'til the DVD comes out. Which I did. And after finally watching it, hoping to be proved wrong about my assumptions about how bad the movies is, I can say that it is as bad, if not WORSE than I thought.<br /><br />Basically WANTED is a one and a half star movie (MAYBE even two) that's saved by two things: Morgan Freeman and great special effects. Other than that, the film is poorly written and it's amazing how a screenplay like this can even be considered by a major studio and given the budget that this film has. The action scenes and shootouts are ridiculous and seem like they were dreamed up by someone with the mentality (or imagination) of a five year old boy (for example, a shootout in which both of the gunmen are such expert shots that every time they open fire at each other, their respective bullets crash into one another). And trust me... I love dumb Action movies with over the top violence... but this one was just horrible. It seems like half the movie is in slow motion for absolutely no reason other than to look cool or something. The best way that I can explain it is by asking a question. Have you ever watched a movie that's so dumb, that you actually felt insulted or even offended by even watching it because of the level of stupidity? Well, WANTED is that movie for me.<br /><br />As far as good things, the special effects were great. The effects showcased a lot of unbelievably stupid scenes but the actual effects were executed very well. Even amidst the stupidity, I actually did find a couple of moments that I liked in the film. My favorite scene is where Wesley shoots a guy in the head, sticks his gun through the hole in the guy's head and runs around with his corpse as a shield and basically shooting his firearm while it's shoved completely through the guys skull. Also the climax of the film is almost like a video game where Wesley appears to be going through different levels and taking on a miniboss of sorts until finally reaching the person (or people) that he REALLY wants to kill. There's also a twist toward the end that I didn't see coming. I won't say what it is, but let's just say that its a total ripoff of EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. And the fact that Morgan Freeman was in the movie made it a tad bit more watchable. Granted, he plays just about the same guy in almost every movie nowadays but his mere presence among the group of morons they decided to cast in this movie is what kept me from stopping the movie halfway through and just giving up altogether.<br /><br />Overall, I wouldn't recommend WANTED unless you like Angelina Jolie (you do after all get to see her naked wet buttocks along with her terrible acting) or unless you like really stupid Action films with an emphasis on the Action and no brains to the story whatsoever. Also the one disc version of the DVD has absolutely no Extra Features. But with my personal feelings on the movie aside, WANTED has moments of fun in it, great effects and visuals, and an interesting twist in the plot. However, if you're anything like me and can't stand watching films with weak scripts, then you should avoid this movie like the plague because it's about as weak as it gets.<br /><br />2 starss movie is what kept me from stopping the movie halfway through and just giving up altogether.

B00007LTIB|5.0|The splendid lone achievement by Yes MK 5 is certainly one of my favorite Yes albums, in no small part  due to the presence of Patrick Moraz.  No slight to the brilliant Rick (or his many fans), but I think Moraz is a better musician here; not only can he do the Emerson/Wakeman classical rock stuff, but also the Jan Hammer note-bending fusion attack (i.e., his blazing solo on Soundchaser).  According to the excellent essay included with this reissue, the band was pushing hard to evolve their sound after Wakeman quit, so Moraz fit right in with their new, more fusion-oriented direction.  The same notes include mutually complimentary comments from most members, so perhaps they've buried the hatchet with Moraz at last.  It's also interesting to learn that to a man, they consider The Gates of Delirium Jon Anderson's brainchild; by continually pushing the other to excel, he showed himself to be the real authority in Yes (even if Squire owns the name!).<br /><br />I don't imagine I'll convince anyone to like this album who doesn't already so I'll just say a few further words about the Rhino reissue.  First, the remastering is superb.  The hum that marred the opening of the gorgeous To Be Over (perhaps my favorite Yes song) is now gone, and the overall sound presence is rich and clean.  The package recreates the LP cover and inner sleeve nicely, included the Donald Kuhlberg poem, though oddly it doesn't include the two additional Roger Dean paintings that came in the booklet for the Joe Gastwirt reissue from the 90s.  The essay is, as I've said, quite detailed and informative, and you also get a few additional photographs (group and individual shots).  As for the extra tracks, two are more curios than anything else.  The single edits (A & B sides) of Soon and Soundchaser are simple chop-outs from the original tracks - no additional recording added or middle-eights missing, in other words.  Soon just fades in and out sooner, while Soundchaser is simply the last half of the complete tune.  The real bonus is the run-through of Delirium.  I wasn't particularly fussed over Siberia, the early Awaken, or the Tales run-throughs, but this one is really pretty decent.  Moraz has just come aboard, so his contributions are minimal, and Jon's not yet really written any lyrics, but the band jams - it's like a very rough but clean bootleg from the Relayer tour.  In fact, I rather enjoy programming it and the two edits together to create a sort of alternative version of the original album.complete tune.  The real bonus is the run-through of Delirium.

B000IHY146|1.0|I suppose I'll have to be the one to say it: Dalton sounded like what she was, a hopeless drunk. The 'phrasing' you're hearing is due to her heroic consumption. She should not have been allowed near a microphone, particularly to murder 'In a Station' by Richard Manuel of The Band: OK It might have sent him a royalty payment but someone else should have sung while Dalton strummed.<br /><br />I managed to sell off my copy of this album. Don't believe the hype. This is dreadfull.

B0014I4KIK|5.0|Luv,luv,luv'd this cd.Originally purchased the cd due to the videos played on VHI every morning while I dress for work. Duffy was listed as an artist \\"you oughta know\\". The first video released was for \\"Warwick Avenue\\", her voice was so expressive of a cheated and broken heart, that I would just stop and listen. When I purchased the cd, I found I loved several different cuts, for several different reasons.The cd has a retro feel, but the lyrics have resonance today.\\"Distant Dreamer\\" could have been played for the Obama campaign.I cannot sit still when I hear \\"Mercy\\" not even if I'm driving, and with \\"Stepping Stone\\" I'm really hoping she finds someone to love and treat her well, I get the impression that she is not lucky at love.Absolutely, an artist you should know and worth a listen.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|I was a bit skeptical when I learned that Firefly would be transferred to the big screen, but I should know by now not to doubt the Whedon.  Set shortly after the end of the television show, Serenity seamlessly movies us into a marvelous capstone for the series we all fell in love with.  Serenity answers many of the questions that have plagued fans since the show met its untimely end, and provides a hopeful and energizing send-off to a wonderful group of characters.  Otherwise, the packaging is pretty cool, and the extra features are highly entertaining to watch after the fact.  I have seen the non-collector's edition and I my preference is this version.    For those who have not seen Firefly fear not, for I have had people tell me that it is a good stand-alone movie.  If, however, you are willing to buy, rent, or borrow the series first I would highly recommend it as it will illuminate many aspects of the movie that may otherwise feel foreign.  Either way you are doing yourself a favor by checking it out.
B001GQ2TGA|1.0|What's with the never-ending Christmas theme?  We all love holidays, but come on!  Also, the scaling back of vocals does not make this genre of music better.. it makes it worse.  Look for other, more interesting artists who are using multiple vocal layers.  Enya is too far out of touch now.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Plainly put, this is one of the genre's greatest works.  I have watched the entire series with my girlfriend at least five times, and have watched it without her at least a couple more.  Needless to say I am in love with the perfectly matched cast, directing, and writing.  When prompted in the past, the best concise description I can muster for Firefly is \\"cowboys in space\\", but it is so much more.  I quickly fell in love with the individual characters.  The reality of living in space is made believable by the show's great writing.  There is a lot of great action and throughout the show maintains levity with very well placed laughs.  If you are a fan of the genre, Whedon's work, or are just curious about all of the highly positive reviews I would highly suggest doing yourself the favor of treating yourself to this set.  Everyone who I have lent my set to or watched episodes with has ended up buying their own copies to watch and share.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I don't buy DVDs that often but I HAD to buy WALL*E since it was such a wonderful, moving film. I cried 2 times in the theater release of this film and did the same when watching at home. Call me an old softie, but I loved this film. Definitely a good buy at this price!

B000002UA5|4.0|That line from a much later song could be an unintentional self-review of this album. What you're getting here is the last hurrah of a much earlier permutation of the band. Half of it is a four-cut live set that I think is their first live album, extended with a smattering of solo works. The live disc contains a version of \\"Astronomy Domine\\" that is described by another reviewer with some accuracy as too close to the studio version, but you're also getting \\"Careful With That Axe Eugene\\", a slash movie without picture. The intro eases in, someone whispers ominously the warning in the song's title, then guitars and voices start shrieking bloody murder. That track has a shorter studio version that never made either of the first two albums and is next to impossible to find even as a rarity. You also get \\"Set the Controls\\" and \\"Saucerful Of Secrets\\", those first two albums' extended tracks. The studio disc has \\"Sisyphus\\", a mellotron/ piano exercise from Rick Wright; Grantchester Meadows, a pensive Syd Barrett folk song which ends in the sound of a fly buzzing around until someone runs down a flight of stairs and swats the thing (how he heard the fly from upstairs is beyond me); \\"Several Species Od Small Furry Animals\\", an intersting sequencing of animal sounds on a multi-track tape machine into a zoological drum machine (maybe you could call it \\"Masontronics\\" as in Robert Fripp's \\"Frippertronics\\"); David Gilmour's \\"The Narrow Way\\"; and yet another drum-based analog sampling of drum sounds. The problem with this album is that most Pink Floyd listeners came onboard with \\"Dark Side Of the Moon\\" and are mainstream radio fare fans, so they tend to be turned off by all of this \\"artsy, obscure-sounding crapola\\", not knowing that this is pretty much what Pink Floyd used to sound like before and slightly after Syd Barrett left.
B0014DZ2VO|3.0|I had HIGH hopes for this one...I really did...but unfortunately, Quantum just didn't 'Do It' for me. That ISN'T to say it isn't worth seeing or that it isn't exciting and literally LOADED with action--don't worry about that at ALL. If anything, QoS has an almost over-abundance of action...the opening chase-scene alone ought to require you to take a couple Dramamine 20 minutes before you see it on the Big Screen. But the plot...? Well, sadly it sags a bit, especially when compared to Daniel Craigs incredible 1st outing as our Superspy.<br /><br />Maybe my opinion of QoS is the fault of my own making...give me a moment to explain: When I heard the producers had let Pierce Brosnan go, I was absolutely STUNNED...WHO was the genius (ie: idiot) who thought this series could do better than HIM, at least at this stage?? Pierce was BORN to play Bond! I went into Casino Royale with a chip on my shoulder so-to-speak, and simply put, my expectations were so low, that I was bound to love it simply because it was actually a well-made action-flick. But with QoS this time around, my expectations were so incredibly HIGH that admittedly, as the movie began, it already had a huge mountain to scale of what I expected it to be. Not fair, I totally agree, but the end result probably won't change even knowing this.<br /><br />While QoS is more like Act II of Casino Royale, the action of Englands greatest Secret Agent seem a bit far-fetched, no matter WHAT the producers wish us to believe. Face it, if you violate orders from the boss as James does, don't be expecting your benefits to continue if you know what I mean. Now it isn't exactly fair I know, to extend that kind of realism to a James Bond film, however, with the efforts the film-makers have gone to in order to create a world more believable than the wise-cracking Bond of old, THEY are the ones who set the new rules, and therefore it is more than fair to judge the film by those rules.<br /><br />In short: I still liked the movie...but I can name plenty of other Bond films I liked more...and yet I still feel that Daniel Craig has what it takes to decisively remove Sean Connery off the near-mythic Alter as 'the Greatest Bond of them ALL'. I anxiously await what Bond will do next.of other Bond films I liked more...and yet I still feel that Daniel Craig has what it takes to decisively remove Sean Connery off the near-mythic Alter as 'the Greatest Bond of them ALL'.

B000MZHW40|5.0|\\"In America, it's bling bling.  But out here, it's bling bang.\\"<br /><br />So says diamond hound Danny Archer, summing up in two sentences the vastly differing attitudes between American capitalism and third-world uprising in director Edward Zwick's (The Last Samurai) five-time Academy Award-nominated composition on greed, anarchy and its resulting desolation.  \\"Blood Diamond\\" is a violently epic film, one that takes a cold hard look at the diamond trade and unveils the heinous business that is behind the acquisition of these dazzling coveted stones.<br /><br />Solomon Vandy (Hounsou) is a humble fisherman of the Mende tribe in Sierra Leone who has high hopes for his son Dia to become a doctor.  When his home village of Shenge is pillaged by the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), he is taken prisoner and forced to work in the diamond fields to fund the radical group's arsenal.  While panning in a riverbed, Solomon unearths a rare pink diamond of grand proportion and rather than surrender it to the despicable Captain Poison (Harewood), he conceals it and later buries it in an unmarked location.<br /><br />Danny Archer (DiCaprio), another in a long line of profiteers, is a covert agent for Van de Kaap Diamond Company who acquires and smuggles diamonds past Liberian officials.  When a smuggling attempt fails and Archer is subsequently arrested, Van de Kaap's bigwigs wash their hands of him.  Not wanting to blow their cover for the sake of the continual lining of their pockets, they leave Danny to fend for himself in a country ravaged by war.  While detained in a prison in Freetown, he overhears Captain Poison in another cell hiss at Solomon about the location of the stone.  Knowing that this diamond will save his hide with Col. Coetzee (Vosloo) - a mercenary responsible for the war that rages on - and provide a one-way ticket out of the country, Danny arranges for Solomon to be released and offers to find his family in exchange for information regarding the location of the stone.<br /><br />Enter Maddy Bowen (Connelly), a tenacious and attractive journalist who at first utilizes her physical charisma to charm the facts out of Danny, coming off as just another correspondent hungry for a big story.  Despite being in ruthless pursuit of the facts, Maddy is a realist - she knows all too well that her presence does little to change things, her candid and emotionally harrowing articles ineffectual in the face of turmoil.  Her burning desire to expose the dirt beneath the diamond trade's pristine fingernails becomes all too clear when she reprimands Danny for capitalizing on Solomon's desperation, in turn deciding to assist Solomon in the search for his now vagrant family.<br /><br />The film's screenplay from Charles Leavitt (K-PAX) is smart, cynical and emotionally earnest and bases much of its scripted chaos on factual events that Leavitt heavily researched.  Wanting to portray the conflict diamond industry as truthfully as possible, Leavitt was well aware that some of what he shared would greatly offend companies in that industry and possibly instigate nasty lawsuits, namely from De Beers (who does a majority of their mining in South Africa as well as Botswana, Namibia and Canada).<br /><br />Hounsou (nominated for Best Supporting Actor) is exceptional as Solomon Vandy, a man who wants nothing more than to provide well for his family.  The desperation to find them and the burning rage against those who ravaged their once happy life are translated beautifully through Hounsou's emphatic eyes and tremulous mouth.<br /><br />Connelly proves once again that she is a formidable actress as Maddy, her immense green eyes emoting much of the conviction in her dialogue.<br /><br />DiCaprio (nominated for Best Actor) deftly executes a South African accent as well as some indisputably supreme acting skills.  As Danny, he portrays a man who has known nothing but violence since his childhood and as a result loosely carries his conscience in his pocket.  His self-imposed teaming with Solomon proves to be the morality check he needs, the ruthless pursuit of the diamond forcing him to look directly into the face of a nation ravaged by disorder and demoralization, something which he has turned the other cheek to so many times in the past.<br /><br />In the film's closing scenes, Leavitt's screenplay states that despite the signing of the Kimberley Process (a process introduced by United Nations resolution 55/56 that is designed to certify the origin of rough diamonds from sources which are free of conflict) in 2003 that \\"illegal diamonds are still finding their way to market\\" and that \\"it is up to the consumer to insist that a diamond is conflict-free\\".  For any women that may view the film and that read this particular caption, it will have them eyeing some of their more prized pieces of jewelry with a newfound - albeit morbid - curiosity.<br /><br />Bottom line: \\"Blood Diamond\\" is an eye-opening examination of a dirty business of which few are aware and it is clear from the outcome that it will take more than a simple governmental resolution to stop the murder and sabotage that a small, flashy piece of carbon has managed to create.orality check he needs, the ruthless pursuit of the diamond forcing him to look directly into the face of a nation ravaged by disorder and demoralization, something which he has turned the other cheek to so many times in the past.

B00006CXSS|5.0|I am going to start by saying that I am not a fan of war movies.  This series is hands down the best war story I have ever seen.  I think it is better than any other war movie or series that I have seen because it focuses on a variety of characters.  It isn't just one or two main people.  Everyone's flaws and fears and pain is so real.  It's long, but you can't stop once you start.  I have seen the series 3 times now, and I really want to get the Blu-Ray version and watch it again!

B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I've been following Doctor Who for a long time. I wasn't able to do so actually FROM the beginning (I was only about 2 when it started!), but public TV in my area aired a lot of it. My favorite Doctor has always been a tie between Tom Baker's crazy-like-a-fox and the elegant gentleman of Jon Pertwee's reign.<br /><br />But David Tennant has moved right up there with them. His portrayal -- quite consciously incorporating aspects of several of his predecessors -- is filled with a manic energy while still radiating an essential humanity-within. Even in his first season (the second season of the \\"modern\\" Doctor Who) he grabbed the role and made it his own; by now he has fully grown into the role, and it has become his.<br /><br />This season has many wonderful aspects to it -- so many that I don't think I could do them all justice. However, one that stands out is the creation of Donna Noble as one of his greatest Companions. Donna, originally seen in the \\"Runaway Bride\\" Christmas Special, has been completely transformed from the narrow-minded, self-centered, usually clueless character she was when the Doctor first met her. Now -- though still brash, sometimes tactless, and just as loud -- she searches through London for the strange, the bizarre, the alien, because after meeting the Doctor, she simply can't go back to her humdrum world.<br /><br />Instead she joins the Doctor in his travels, and becomes -- not a lover (or would-be lover, as was poor Martha) -- but the Best Friend that the Doctor really needs, someone who loves the adventures, who even after being put through hell and dragged back won't give up on the life she has found with the last of the Timelords, who has an indomitable spirit and unbreakable will and a courage you simply would not have BELIEVED in the Donna Noble we first met.<br /><br />While there are a few weak episodes in this season, the strong points more than make up for it -- none stronger than the grand finale, featuring one of the Doctor's greatest adversaries in his most glorious appearance yet, grandeur and apocalypse and tragedy and victory all at once.<br /><br />I am very saddened by the news that (apparently) David Tennant will be leaving Doctor Who after the next season; but he will have left his mark indelibly on the franchise, and whoever takes up the mantle will have one hell of a pair of boots to step into.ost glorious appearance yet, grandeur and apocalypse and tragedy and victory all at once.

B0019X3ZZY|4.0|Many reviewers are basing their opinions on Pasolini's reputation and just assuming that because Pasolini made a number of masterpieces that this too must somehow merit our attention.<br /><br />After having viewed several of Pasolini's other films I have to say that this is his weakest. The film's reputation (or notoriety) has little to do with the actual substance of the film. If the film is critiqued according to the normal criteria of film criticism it would have to be judged a failure for it simply fails to engage the viewer. The most glaring reason for this and the most glaring weakness of the film is its complete lack of three-dimensional characters. In fact there is no characterization at all. In the place of characters we have \\"authority figures\\" and \\"captives\\". But since there is very little that differentiates one character from the next there is no way to judge the psychological effects of this social experiment. The most that can be said for the film is that it is gorgeously filmed by an immensely talented cinematographer and that the decorous interiors (some interiors have been painted to resemble the interiors of classical Roman villas and others have been decorated with modernist art and furniture) do provide a luxurious backdrop and elegant contrast for what occurs in the foreground. But since the characters have very little individuality and are therefore interchangable the film itself simply fails to resonate as either a psychic or a political parable.<br /><br />Granted, Pasolini's gifts as a filmaker are extraordinary. In his best efforts (ie Teorema starring Terence Stamp) he gives us highly individualized characters and with them he examines the psychology and psychopathology of class. In Salo Pasolini is examining various power differentials as well but since we do not know and therefore cannot really empathize with any character on either side of the power/powerless equation the entire thing remains an abstract exercise. Perhaps this emotional distancing was intentional and perhaps this was precisely the detached aesthetic that Pasolini was looking for but the resut is that the viewer is simply not involved in what is happening on screen. I suppose this is the pitfall of Artaudian & Brechtian theatre as well.<br /><br />Many films of the sixties and early seventies were designed as assaults on establishment tastes and standards: Godard for one subverted conventional narrative techniques, Bunuel toyed with the social hypocrisies of the bourgeoisie, and Dusan Makavejev examined the body as a sight of social control as well as of resistance. But can a film be considered a success if it assaults everyone's tastes and standards?  I suppose the answer could be yes, but only if it makes some point that it could not make in any other way. The film, I would argue, fails not because of what it shows but because what it shows simply fails to amount to anything.was intentional and perhaps this was precisely the detached aesthetic that Pasolini was looking for but the resut is that the viewer is simply not involved in what is happening on screen.

B001DHXT20|3.0|This version of the Incredible Hulk had the potential to be a really good movie. I found the final fight scene to be epic. It was everything it should've been. But I didn't rate this movie over four stars based on the fact that Liv Tyler & William Hurt killed the movie with their bad overracting. I'm not speaking about their acting skills overall based on a long term basis. In this movie that should have cast someone else to do the parts because i got so sick of seeing Liv's character crying all the time or jumping in the way. She reminded me of the classic termed \\"stupid white girl\\" in all the horror flicks. The one who goes to investigate all the noises and goes into the creepy houses. And you wonder why you get killed. But I digress from my point if you want to skip through their acting and focus more on the action, then it's bound to be a better movie. It just seems like the only two good actors in the whole movie were edward norton and tim roth, even mr.blue's character reminded me of a prepubescent boy who's just touched his first boobie in reference to his blantant overexcitement at meeting \\"bruce banner\\". I'm liked your supposed to be an intelligient scientist not a 10yr old girl meeting Miley Cyrus for the first time.

Benny Golson, who later would be replaced by a young Wayne Shorter, pinned two tunes on this recording: \\"Are You Real?\\" \\"The Drum Thunder Suite,\\" \\"Blues March,\\" and \\"Along Came Betty.\\" Bobby Timmons, who later wrote \\"Dat Dere\\" for the 1960 album \\"The Big Beat,\\" wrote the title track.<br /><br />This is an outstanding album full of virtuosity, swing, pure emotion, and some of the best jazz drumming you ever heard. Highly recommended.
B001E75QGG|3.0|I was so eager to see this movie but ended up not making it to the theatre to see.  I'd heard all the hype about it being a disappointment but still planned on buying it to add to my collection.  I'm glad I did buy it after watching it.  It's no Raiders of the Lost Ark but still is enjoyable.  One thing that I did find grating was the pg-13+ language in it.  I don't remember that in Raiders as much.  So this chapter is pg-13 for more than the action/ violence so be warned.  It was nice to see the Marian/ Indie romance pick up where it left off.  I personally do feel that Harrison Ford would be stretching it way too far to pursue this character any further unless just in a supporting role.  He can't carry that type of action anymore believeably.  On the other hand I could see this franchise picking up where it left off with the newcomer to the storyline continuing in Dad's footsteps... But be realistic in your expectations because lightening seldom strikes twice in the same spot!    J. Gibson (Winston-Salem, NC)
B000P12LWY|4.0|For as long as I can remember, I have been fascinated by  Henry VIII. So of course I was excited when Showtime presented The Tudors! If you're someone who wants everything to be 100% accurate to history, then this isn't for you. But if you can put that aside and just appreciate the series for what it is, you'll love it. You can see all the glamour and gore of the Tudors. Henry VIII was a true Renaissance man, and this series shows that quite well. The costumes and sets are just amazing. View it as Historical Fiction, if you must. It's quite enjoyable and after watching one episode, you'll be eager to see all of them...
B001DHXT1G|4.0|After seeing both Hulk movies I do prefer this newer one to the earlier offering.  The actor portraying the Hulk (Norton) I feel fits the role much better.  Norton has an intensity that the former actor (Bana) lacked.  I'm also glad that this movie did away with the divided screen comic book style which the earlier film relied heavily on.  Liv Tyler is every bit as good in the role of the former love of the Hulk's as Connelly was in the earlier film.  I'm also relieved that the storyline doesn't include one similar to the Nolte/ Bana in the former film.  Every time Nolte was on the screen I felt he took the film in a strange direction and sucked the air right out of it.  It brought the whole movie down with it.  One thing that this film does do is that it doesn't replace the former film in that the storyline picks up where the other Hulk left off.  Anyone who enjoyed the 1st film will like that aspect.  This movie I can stand to watch again several more times.

B000N3ST7A|5.0|I am a huge Fleetwood Mac fan, have been so since I was in High School (I'm 45 now), but in my personal opinion, this is probably Stevie Nicks' best CD, which is a collection of some of her best.  Highly recommend it, especially if you are a Stevie Nicks fan, (and as a Fleetwood Mac fan, also) as I have come to be because of this CD.  The music, the poetic words, the stories she tells through her music.  Brilliant.  My personal favorites are \\"Sorcerer;\\" a new version of \\"Dreams;\\" which is equally awesome. The original version of this song was excellent, but this new version is even better. If Stevie Nicks were to venture onto this website and read what her fans are writing, I think she would be pleased.  Awesome.  More!!  Out of Fleetwood Mac, she is truly worth listening to.
0896762629|5.0|At last, the long-awaited book has been released.  Although this book is a culmination of twenty years of Miss Arnold's work, it is not the last word, rather it is the first word for inquiry and investigation.  It is an inspiration for any costumer, sewer, researcher or any interested in period construction and history.  I had the opportunity to see it displayed at the Costume Colloquium Conference in Florence, Italy and could not wait to get my copy.  The many up-close and personal color photographs of surviving garments as well as detailed graphs are important as a primary source of study.  Avoiding sounding clich&eacute;d by saying that this book is a must-have book, I will say instead that it is a necessary tool and reference for any library of costume and period design.  My heartfelt thanks goes out to Jenny Tiramani and Santina Levey, who I had the pleasure of meeting at the Conference for their great work in completing this work and all those who assisted them.  Forever will this work, as well as all of Miss Arnold's exhaustive work, be the foundation for costumers, historians, archaeologists, anthropologists and researchers alike.  This work opens up a world of who we were in our past as seen through our dress and traditions and reminds and inspires us of the distinction and importance of true research and interpretation rather than extrapolating from paintings only.
0060734191|5.0|This set is absolutely AMAZING!  These books take you to another world, half much life our own and the other half a mystical and scary place where free magic creatures and evil beings brought back to life are roaming free.  These books are well written which makes the pages fly by.  I have read these books at least 10 times, maybe even more and they get better each time I read.  One of that many up sides to these books is how the 2 main characters (Sabriel & Touchstone) are in the next two books.  I hate series where you fall in love with the main characters and then the next book is about someone totally different.  Sorry about rambling on but I feel like this book is a great great great read for anyone.  If you like the fantasy genre, you will not be disappointed.

B00004R99F|3.0|Since this is one of my favorite Disney movies, I decided to get the DVD and see if it was worth the money, but unfortunatley it wasn't. One of the biggest problems with the DVD is that the film is not presented in its original aspect ratio. Another problem is the special features included. Out of all the stuff included, I was expecting a \\"making of\\" featurette, but Disney was too lazy to include it, not to mention one was already made back during the film's release and aired on the Disney Channel. Everything else seems ok, the VHS version of this movie is probably two times better. In other words, this is a great film, but the DVD is simlpy stupid.
B001EOQWEO|4.0|After all the hype, I was expecting a monumental Disney classic. I had pre-ordered two months ago and was anxiously waiting to see this, but the first time I watched it I was rather disappointed that the magic I have been used to for 60 years just wasn't there. That is where I found Wall-E to be lacking.    Far too many individuals have taken offense at the gratuitous ecological message that plays throughout the entire movie, but I have to laugh at that idea...sure, the trash piles are larger than the sky scrapers, but the message I got was an extreme exagaration rather than a harsh warning.    Wall-E is an entertaining modern cartoon with a story, but if you are looking for this to be a classic, nooo. I've watched it twice since, and it does grow on you, but don't expect that warm fuzzy feeling like in earlier Disney classics...
0316017922|5.0|Macolm Gladwell offers another expertly-written and thoughtfully-presented argument in 'Outliers', which describes the life paths of many incredibly successful individuals but also makes the case for nurture over nature as a means to that success. In the concise book, Gladwell presents in his Tom Wolfe-esque narrative journalistic style the stories of some of history's greatest musicians (The Beatles), computer whizzes (Bill Joy and Bill Gates), and lawyers (Joe From). His point is that, yes, these greatest of greats had some innate talent to make it as far as they did, but they also had a great deal of luck. For instance, Bill Gates didn't become the wealthiest man in the world by pure ambition and cunning; his wealth was the result of skill in computer programming that sprung from a series of lucky situations. Gates, after all, was one of the only eigth-graders who had unlimited access to a computer in 1968. Gladwell makes a convincing case that much of what we attribute to individual success is really due to happenstance.<br /><br />Gladwell argues briefly for allowing for the same opportunities for everyone (e.g. having multiple school cohorts for people born at different times of the year), but fails to acknowledge the obvious conclusion that his argument leads to: we are products of nurture much more than nature. In fact, Gladwell allows for much innate talent in his successful subjects throughout the book, but doesn't see that the innate talent may be more of the same nurture that was applied to the subjects before observation. Gladwell produces such a convincing argument for nurture at some point in life--why not apply the same argument for one's entire life?<br /><br />In addition, Gladwell doesn't really come to a unifying circumstance that helped his subjects get to their outlier success. For example, the author attributes some of his subjects' success to opportunity of wealth (Bill Gates enjoyed a wealthy upbringing that allowed him to work on computers at a young age; children of wealthier parents are brought up with an 'entitlement' mentality that allows them to fare better in the real world) and others to race (From's success was directly related to his Jewish upbringing) and still others to pure luck (the Beatles just happened to get selected to play in Hamburg, which forced them to work hard at their craft). It appears to me that the only thing in common between all of Gladwell's subjects is not a single opportunity that they all had, but that they all took advantage of the opportunities that they had. For instance, Gates's wealth and From's poverty when growing up both were key elements to their success--they just took advantage of their unique situations.<br /><br />Despite the minor flaws, this book is highly recommended, if nothing else for its ease of read and its thought-provoking ideas.children of wealthier parents are brought up with an 'entitlement' mentality that allows them to fare better in the real world) and others to race (From's success was directly related to his Jewish upbringing) and still others to pure luck (the Beatles just happened to get selected to play in Hamburg, which forced them to work hard at their craft).

B001AX9DT0|5.0|I had never heard of Ray LaMontagne before Amazon's recommendation engine pointed out to me that people frequently bought Martin Sexton's \\"Solo\\" along with \\"Gossip in the Grain.\\" I'm a huge fan of Martin Sexton since about a year ago, and looking for more amazing folk/rock music to experience.<br /><br />So I sampled a few tracks before downloading mp3s for \\"You are the Best Thing\\" and \\"Let It Be Me.\\" Repeated playings of these tracks quickly lead to buying the rest. (And then regretting not buying the physical CD.) Love the whole album, listening to it many times the past couple of days, and now waiting eagerly for his first two albums to be delivered.<br /><br />The songs really move me.  Emotional, honest, real.  Ray's voice is superb.  \\"I Still Care For You\\" didn't click right away, but I quickly grew to appreciate it along with the rest.  I don't understand the hate for \\"Meg White\\" in other reviews -- it's another good tune and a nice change of pace.  \\"Winter Birds\\" also good.  Mellow, yet engaging. (I don't really know what that means.) All the tunes are awesome. So glad to have found this artist and that I have more to look forward to.
B0011V9XT6|5.0|Much can be said about today's artists and the assembly-line fashion in which they are produced, packaged and marketed. Thankfully, Beyonce is not from that mold. The test of any great musical performer is how well their performance can hold up in front of a live audience, away from the safety of music video magic. The Beyonce Experience is one of those rare live performances where if you weren't convinced of the hype surrounding an artist beforehand -- you will be afterwards.<br /><br />I saw this concert live in Chicago, IL and it was wonderful to find this DVD; it captures every moment of that amazing concert experience. Unlike others where the show relies heavily on stage production and quick edits to hide the weakness of the performance, The Beyonce Experience is one of those rare concert video's that put you right in the experience using camera angles that allow you to actually SEE THE PERFORMANCE.<br /><br />From the opening in which Beyonce asks her Los Angeles audience, \\"...are you ready to be entertainnnnnneeeddd!!!,\\" The Beyonce Experience is a magnum opus of all the great work she's compiled throughout the years as lead singer in Destiny's Child to her present solo efforts. Although brief, this concert DVD features brief guest appearances by Jay-Z, Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams. Beyonce brings the heat with every track with exceptional performances on: Crazy in Love, Flaw's N All, Irreplaceable, Jumpin' Jumpin' and Soldier. Even the interludes by her all female band and her dance troupe are crowd pleasers.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray image is presented in beautiful 1080p and a 1:78.1 aspect ratio so if you have a 16:9 widescreen television (or digital projector in my case); it fills your screen completely without letterboxing. The Dolby 5.1 sound substantially captures her vocals, the music and the crowd's excitement. The PCM audio will drive the neighbors to call the police on you because of the explosive sound quality.  For the Blu-Ray fans who like all those fancy little extras, sorry you'll be disappointed.  The video is a direct port of the DVD version.  Even still, running at a lengthy two hours and ten minutes, for the price this is hands down one of the best concert experiences any artist has ever offered. It's a must for any MUSIC FAN and Beyonce fan alike.ll those fancy little extras, sorry you'll be disappointed.  The video is a direct port of the DVD version.

0446581348|5.0|Bobbi Brown isn't about makeup trickery and techniques designed to alter the shape of a feature or make an average woman look like a drag Marilyn Monroe.  If you are looking for this kind of book--as I suspect some of the other reviewers were--look elsewhere.  What she is about is teaching a woman to look and feel her best, and this book does an excellent job of showing each and every step, in a way that a novice can understand and a pro can appreciate.  Not everyone may feel they need this kind of instruction...but then why read a book called \\"Makeup Manual\\" if you already know it all?      Unlike her other books, which focus quite a bit on how health and lifestyle affect beauty, Bobbi's Makeup Manual really is dedicated to makeup artistry.  A beginning makeup artist will find the detailed instructions on dramatic smoky eyes, false eyelash application, and how to work on a photo shoot especially useful.  Bobbi also delves into extreme color, editorial looks, makeup as art, and tribal and geisha looks, all of which are territory uncovered in her previous books.      To summarize, if you appreciate Bobbi Brown's aesthetic, you will enjoy this book.  If you want to know how to create basic and dramatic looks in a way that is pretty and modern, you will love this book.  If you are a new makeup artist, you need this book.  If you want to know how to transform Andy Rooney into Audrey Hepburn with lipstick, glitter, and seventeen concealers, you will hate this book.  If you already know it all...write your own book.  I'll look forward to reading it.    Cheers!
1843106698|5.0|This book is very helpful and informative.  I didn't know much about AS previously.  The author has extensive clinical experience with AS patients.  He includes his own insights as well as those of other people.  He includes many descriptions and examples.  I am only half way through the book, but I am recognizing many symptoms in my teenage daughter.  It explains alot!  Even things I would not have connected with AS.  This book is not negative in any way.  I feel very good about who my daughter is, and understand better why she is the way she is.  AS people are very special and gifted.  AS people can contribute to the world in ways the rest of us cannot.  This book also has some \\"coping\\" suggestions, such as how to help the AS person recognize social cues.  I would recommend this book to anyone curious about Aspergers Syndrome.

Justice is one of my favorite Tallica albums of their great catalog.  Song are heavy and meaty.  Most of them about 8 minutes and longer.  I won't take up a bunch of time reviewing the songs, because it's been done to death.    These reissues have been great from the start and this continues the trend.

Veganism for everyone?    The whole is greater than the sum of its parts - whole foods are key.  We do not know the exact chemical processes that happen within us when we digest food substances. What we do know is that the body is a very complicated bio computer that digests real whole foods well and we do know that the body doesn't quite know what to do with artificial and chemical foods. It cannot be stressed enough how important it is that we connect with the sources from where we get our nourishment. If not a new concept (our ancestors were quite well aware) it is one that modern lifestyle ignores even if applicable for all developed cultures on the globe.    Supplements must be used as medicine in individual circumstances, prescribed by a qualified practitioner. Supplements are fractions of something else (whole foods supplements too!). I agree with the text that supplements will not lead to long-lasting health and that the industry is taking advantage of the fears, people especially in the Western world and philosophy are trying to cover by buying an insurance for continued good health despite their lifestyle. Nutrients must be consumed as whole foods and not as fractions of whole foods because any living system will be disturbed by the addition or subtraction of a single element, even when replacing this element with another element that might be considered of superior quality.    When food is dissected into macro and micro nutrients it is no longer looked at as whole systems, wholes have emerging properties that its parts will not have when dissected. As a result when breaking up a whole food such as a carrot, the vegetable is more than an aggregate of carbohydrates, beta-carotene, vitamin C and water. A carrot is a system, dissecting or disturbing this system by eating vitamin A instead of eating the actual carrot will make the body deficient in all the elements that usually accompany it in the carrot. Not only vitamins and minerals are missing, but also texture and taste. As a result the body will look to make up for this deficiency in other ways by craving something crunchy (potato chips?), sweet (candy?) and juicy (sodas and alcohol?) or maybe even something orange!    Numerous individual researches confirm that plants are vital for good health. That \\"there are virtually no nutrients in animal-based foods that are not better provided by plants\\" (Campbell, 2006, p. 230) is a strong statement that I find difficult to agree with, I also find that the conclusions in the text are at times drawn on weak and somewhat one-sided arguments that ignore important well-respected researches of the contrary for example that many people thrive on animal protein. As Campbell points out, it may be difficult for somebody living on plant foods to obtain adequate amounts of vitamin B 12 as well as vitamin A and D, even if these aren't considered necessary to be obtained through diet. The vitamins are absorbed better by the body when including a variety of seafood and good quality fats in the diet. Campbell suggests seeing a doctor to have levels of Vitamin B12 checked and to add supplements to the diet to make up for a deficiency. Regarding vitamin D, available in salmon and butter absorbed by the body together with fats, people in the Northern hemisphere do depend on these foods in the darker months of the year when daylight is scares. It is also worth mentioning that some traditional cultures, live on diets very high on saturated animal fats and very little plant foods - heart disease is not a problem. This example undermines the statement that `the same good nutrition maximizes health at every stage of a disease' (Campbell, 2007, p. 237). All necessary vitamins are available through diet, it should not be necessary to rely on tests and supplements. Some good quality animal sources of nutrients might be necessary for some.     The statement that it isn't chemicals that are cancer causing but the consumption of animal foods based on the breast cancer study in Long Island (Campbell, 2007, p. 166) is somewhat subjective and I am tempted to refer to studies that indicate that one of the best-documented medical aftereffects of the Hiroshima was the leukemia that developed in many of the survivors. Those who received the heaviest doses of atomic radiation have been eight times more likely than other Japanese to get the disease and they are more susceptible than others to a whole variety of cancers.    I appreciate the assertion that food is powerful stuff that is able to prevent and indeed halt or reverse disease after diagnosis and that this is applicable for people at any age. It is an area that cannot be stressed enough. Although difficult to prove scientifically, numerous studies on everything from macrobiotic diet to raw foods diet show remarkable result with the use of diet as medicine.     Campbell briefly mentions autoimmune diseases as the most frightening, because once the body turns against itself, it may become unstoppable. The Swank diet is mentioned which, back in 1977, concluded that a diet low in animal fats can prevent and even reverse multiple sclerosis. Although Swank's studies are impressive (even if anecdotal to a great extend) and carried out over a period of many years, Swank represents only one study among numerous, these are not mentioned by Campbell. Some researchers speculate that the high fat intake obtained through the ketogenic diet helps repair the myelin sheath around the nerves, the structure that is damaged in people with multiple sclerosis. Other factors that Campbell fails to mention in connection with for example multiple sclerosis are the effects of mercury in teeth, consumption of dairy, vaccinations and the use of antibiotics.     I appreciate the presentation by Campbell on genes and I agree that gene expression is dependant on diet. Numerous studies show that people when they migrate assume the disease risk of the country to which they move. Obesity amongst Asian/American population is a good example of this. As Natalie Angier states in a recent article in the New York Times' Science section: \\"We have to get away from the underlying assumption of the particulate units of inheritance that we seem so attached to\\". The research and evidence on this area is not only a relief for many, it also gives the individual a reason to make an effort to use food and lifestyle to maintain good health and not give in to poor health based the assumption that they are unavoidable because of certain diseases of their ancestors.     It seems that complexity theory, the advanced form of system theory, is appropriate in the study of how diet and lifestyle has an effect on human beings who must be viewed as very complex, evolutionary, adaptive systems. It is indeed complex yet very simple as underlined by Campbell.   As we are all biochemical individuals, I believe that there is enough evidence available at present that conclude that there isn't just one diet that fits all. It is the responsibility of the individual to figure out which foods suit their particular body best in order to feel good and to stay healthy. This is not simple and takes careful consideration and determination.
0143058525|5.0|I loved this book. In part, I am sure, because it reminds me of Italy's sights, smells and sounds. Also, as a woman I related to her experiences. Sometimes she made me howl with laughter, and other times I winced at her honest rendition of life's pains. This was as enjoyable as a bon bon. Most of my reading is research or other non-fiction. This departure was delightful for me, and I am so glad to have received it as a gift. It probably is not everybody's fare. I wouldn't have appreciated it when I was in my 20's, for example, nearly as much as I do now, in my 40's.
B001GQACGE|2.0|I bought deluxe edition.  I saw one of her interviews and she stated she recorded over 70 songs for the album.  There are only a few songs from both the disks that I like and 2 of the singles are out now.  As far as the double discs since she recorded 70 songs or more why werent more songs on each disk.  The deluxe edition has 16 songs total and all could have been put on one disc. I expected the SASHA FIERCE side to be stronger with upbeat songs but most of the songs on the SASHA FIERECE side could be on the first disc.  Aso in the delux edition only the lyrics for the first disc are in the booklet.  All the lyrics should have been included .But what im expecting to happen is there will be a quite alot of remixes for those songs to keep the momentum of sales!
031606792X|2.0|What to say about BD?  I did not like the book as much as the first three.  My daughter (15) recommended it since ½ of her school mates were reading it.  She knew I was searching for a book that would catch my interest.  I read Twilight in two days and it left me wanting more, thus I checked out  New Moon at the library.  Again I craved for more; then I moved to Eclipse.    Breaking Dawn was a disappointment.  I like the fact that the major characters got a happy ending, but where is the fight the dertmination to get what you deserve? So Bella discovers that she has a gift, but where is the struggle the passion that we so in the first books? Jacob definitely got the short end of the stick.  I love the fact that he moved on but is that enough for th Jacob that we all love and care about?     The editing need some help.  There are some grammatical issues that could have been avoided.
B001DHXT20|5.0|Marvel Studios followed their exceptional \\"Iron Man\\" with \\"The Incredible Hulk,\\" another terrific comic book adaptation. Dispensing with the overall seriousness of the previous film, the Ang Lee-directed \\"The Hulk,\\" this film returns to the storyline as seen in the 1978 television show. In fact, one of the film's pluses is that it brings elements from the show into the film, such as Lou Ferrigno, who lends his voice to the Hulk, as well as a cameo appearance as a security guard; and the TV theme makes a welcomed return.<br />While not as good as \\"Iron Man,\\" this is a terrific film that features some awesome action sequences, terrific visual effects and fine storytelling. The performances are good as well. Edward Norton is great as Bruce Banner, bringing the character elements that Bill Bixby made famous, while also adding some great little character nuances, while not making the character too dark or depressing, such as Tobey McGuire did in the overrated \\"Spider-man\\" films. The beautiful and talented Liv Tyler provides some smarts and sexyness as Banner's love interest, while William Hurt and Tim Roth give menacing performances as Banner's villainous rivals. And a welcomed cameo by Robert Downey, Jr. as Tony Stark is not only memorable, but also continues the march toward \\"The Avengers\\" in 2011.<br />With \\"The Incredible Hulk,\\" Marvel Studios has made two well-done superhero films. If you enjoyed the original TV series or the comic books, then you'll surely enjoy \\"The Incredible Hulk!\\"<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A
B001ECQ75A|5.0|This movie was a huge hit with my 5 and 7 year old.  They watched it over and over.  The best part about kids and movies that they've watched before is that they know when the funny scenes are coming - they sit on the edge of coach braced for a big laugh.  There were plenty of them in this movie.  Ultimately it comes down to enjoyment, which they truly got from this movie.
B001C08RHA|5.0|After sitting through some rather lackluster Marvel adaptations, such as the overrated \\"Spider-man\\" and \\"X-Men\\" films, I sat to watch \\"Iron Man\\" with cautious optimism. And it proved to be worthwhile. This is, without a doubt, the best adaptation of a Marvel comic book character to date. Dispensing with over-serious storylines, such as in \\"Spider-man 2\\" and \\"The Hulk,\\" the story never takes itself too seriously, bringing the fun and excitement back to the superhero movie. The storytelling, visual effects and action sequence all deliver.<br />And the performances? What can I say? Robert Downey, Jr. is perfectly cast as Tony Stark, the playboy/weapons seller turned superhero. His performance is truly believable and clever, and gives this superhero movie its heart. The supporting cast, including Terrence Howard, Gwyneth Paltrow and Jeff Bridges, plus a cameo appearance by Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, add to the film's richness. After what seemed like an eternity, a Marvel superhero film truly delivers! If you enjoy superhero films, then \\"Iron Man\\" will blow you away!<br />Movie/DVD Grade: A+
B000CNESU8|5.0|Not only is this a great dvd, but the delivery was prompt and the dvd was in new condition.  I am very happy with this product.  I will surely order from this seller again.
B00003CXCQ|4.0|I was impressed with the speed of delivery.  My 5 year old loves the Dopey mine game.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|No, it's not quite like the book.  Is any movie as great as the book?  I, too, enjoyed the earlier film version of this.  The lighting and scenery are more beautiful than this one.  However, I really enjoyed this version.  The ordinary way it was presented made it feel more real, like I was there instead of watching a movie.  I'm not an Austen expert, but having read the book I thought it captured the spirit of it.  Captain Wentworth was SMOKIN', plus I identified with Anne immediately.  It ended wonderfully despite the marathon Anne ran, and the kiss was worth the hour spent.  The acting is good, the story is great, it's a good time to be had by all.  If you are a purist go spend the time reading the novel, but if you want a relaxing hour of well written characters and a heart-wrenching story you've come to the right place.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I could hardly wait until this album came out. It was worth the wait! It is terrific! Rock on David Cook! Your fans love you!

0316113506|5.0|Teaches you about brain chemistry and biology, and how it can be positively affected by exercise. You will never think of exercise as something to do merely for physical appearance or even physical health. It can help you focus, be more productive, and beat depression or depression-like symptoms. The author has the science to back up the claims and organizes the book in such a way that it is easy to follow and learn. I'm hoping that it will lead me -- as an intellectual person -- to exercise more upon an intellectual understanding as to the wide-range positive effects it has. I hope to be a poster child for it, and will let you know more about how it works, beyond the intellectual level...
1402568851|5.0|This otherwise excellent novel truly comes alive in the reading. If you're able to get and listen to a copy of Jeff Woodman's remarkable reading of this novel (available from RecordedBooks.com), do so by all means. Woodman brings a deeper and more authentic dimension to the story overall. I mean, it's a British novel with British (mainly English) idioms and expressions: \\"hearing\\" the dialog in your head is not the same as hearing it spoken aloud. Jeff Woodman's rendition of the various characters and their different British accents is extremely faithful and \\"spot on\\" as they say across the Pond. In particular, his voices of the various police officials and minor characters in the novel (ticket kiosk attendants, store clerks, neighbors, etc.)that Christopher the protagonist encounters are scary good.<br /><br />As for the merits of the book itself, as the parent of a \\"special needs\\" child (who is now 25), I can say that Christopher's parents' respective challenges with having a child with Asperger's Syndrome were faithfully represented without being overdrawn or melodramatic. A profound book on many levels.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|I'm a true Gilmore Girls fan and am totally addicted to the show. Even my husband, who does not like the typical \\"girly\\" shows loves watching Gilmore Girls. The show is funny, clean and something I watch on a regular basis with my own daughter. If you are looking for a \\"Sex in the City\\" type show, this is not it. But if you want a show that will make you laugh and take your mind off of the negative stuff in this world, then Gilmore Girls is the show for you.
0375826726|1.0|I enjoyed Eragon, thought that the second book was plodding ... and am deeply, deeply, deeply disappointed in Brisingr.<br /><br />Like many others, I slogged through 100's of pages of Brisingr. When Eragon went to Tronjiheim and, sounding like an American tourist, started to whine about participating in a culture that views time differently from his own ...<br /><br />.. I simply gave up and stopped reading.<br /><br />I wanted to like Brisingr, but I got lost in Tronjiheim.<br /><br />I can add little to the excellent reviews of Brisingr by Christopher Lintel and racapowski (When is Amazon going to allow links to other reviews within reviews? ;-)<br /><br />So I'll content myself with adding my one star vote.<br /><br />Note to Christopher Paolini: Please, sir. Find yourself a decent editor who will challenge you to become a better writer. You have potential.
B000255LIY|5.0|I had nearly worn out my original copy of Lion in Winter.  I am a huge fan of Patrick Stewart, but had no idea this copy existed until I looked to replace my run-down vhs copy.  As much as I love Patrick Stewart's work, and have all the faith in the world in his ability to bring out the best and the worst of characters, this would be a test.  How could anyone (even Patrick Stewart and Glenn Close) compare with the phenomenal performances of Peter O'Toole and Katherine Hepburn?  They couldn't, and they didn't.  What they did was to recreate the roles in a style entirely their own.  The script is essentially unchanged.  The sets are a bit more elaborate.  The performances are spectacular.  I think Patrick Stewart managed better to create his own Henry than Gleen Close did with Eleanor.  I should have liked to see Close really open up and not try so hard to meet the standard set by Hepburn.  The early going has a lighter approach the the original version.  I don't think that the chemistry of the first film could ever be matched.  In the end, however, the characters play well off of each other.  When Patrick Stewart unleashes the force of Henri's grief, the effect is absolutely wrenching.  For the cast, overall, I think the only role I repeatedly missed in this performance was Anthony Hopkins' version of Richard.    In every way as dramatic, as painful, and as entertaining as the original, this \\"new\\" Lion in Winter is definitely a keeper!  If I had to choose now which performance I prefer, I doubt I could.  As a matter of fact, I now own them both on dvd.

031606792X|3.0|There is no way this review can go on without major spoilers. So here is my warning.    I dont want to go so far as to say I LOVED reading the Twilight series. It was close enough. I really, really enjoyed them, but I knew they were far from perfect. Not even close, in fact. But they did have their degrees of entertainment.    Though flawed, the other 3 novels through away every Vampire cliché known to man. It irked my a bit, but I got over it, because I fell in love with the characters. Well, mostly with Edward Cullen. Therefore, I was most dissapointed in Breaking Dawn and what occured pretty much off the bat.    I can forgive the going out into the sun bit, and the sparkly skin, and everything else Stephenie Meyer has come up with. However, how can a pregancy between a human and a vampire-who should not even be able to carry sperm-be even remotely plausable? Unfortunately, I guess what was happening as soon as they got to their honeymoon. But I didn't want it to go there. It's just plain wrong. It almost seems too neat and tidy.    Alas, that is exactly what happened. And it happened at an alarmingly fast rate. Of course, proper drama was thrown in-the baby was slowly killing her, breaking her from the inside out, bla bla bla.    Jacob and Edward are suddenly best friends. The werewolfs want to attack and kill Bella and the unborn child. The evil vampire clan from Italy is coming to destroy them all... It was too much, and yet not enough. Jacob is still lusting after Bella, even though she is dying, Edward doesn't even care anymore, even going so far as to offer Jacob to Bella, and have lots and lots of little werewolf babies-if only Bella would give up the unborn fetus and stay alive. Sigh.    That is pretty much the bulk of the story until towards the end where this huge, massive battle is planned-but then nothing happens. Lots of talking, and evil intentions. But that's about it. And then it goes away. And everyone is fine and dandy again. The Cullen family is still together and strong and happy. And thats pretty much it! That's the end of the Twilight Series! Just like that..    Breaking Dawn did have its moments. When Bella was dying, I felt for Edward and Jacob. Though I kind of guessed at the outcome, it was a nail-biting kind of moment. There were others too. Jacob imprinting on Bella's baby. Again, almost too tidy, but it was a nice moment.     All in all, a slighlty dissapointing end to this interesting series, but not a total horror show either. I do get the hype, I just wish it had ended in a more unique sort of way, and not all dandy like it did.

0394800184|1.0|While i can understand the usefulness of this book for parents of adopted children,  when i was little i thought it was just AWFUL!    I always hated that book, and it made me terrified of getting lost and not being able to find my mother (not that i was ever in any danger of being out of her sight for 1 minute...).  I remember thinking that the story was cruel and calloused, and i felt so sorry for the poor baby birdie.    To this day (25 yrs later), my mother, sister and I, still joke about being traumatised by \\"are you my mother?\\", and refer to it as \\"that awful book\\".     If your kids like it, that's fine, but i will never buy this book for my kids.
0316067601|5.0|It is a time when being patriotic is a dirty word. Fewer and fewer people are nationalistic like the previous generation was. Today the word in vogue is global. The new economy is forming rapidly with a new world goverment in the wings. With men like Marcus Latrell in our service, it gives the patriotic remnant a reason to still be proud of our country.  This book effected every area of my life and motivated me to live a life worthy of God and my country. And yes I do believe in miracles Marcus, You needed to tell your story. God bless you.

B0002BO05S|5.0|The Greatest Story ever told<br /><br />We wanted to own this movie so we can share it with young adults that are in the process of understanding and defining their religious belifs.<br /><br />While rather lengthy, this George Stevens directed film provides an in depth view into the life of Jesus Christ, touching on all aspects of the story. The cast of characters is simply superb and we found ourselves trying to identify the cameo appearance of our favorites, including John Wayne, Max von Sydow, Pat Boone, Charlton Heston, Martin Landau,  Angela Lansbury, David McCallum, Sidney Poitier and Telly Savallas.<br /><br />The film delves into the life of Christ with great reverence and respect, recreating his path through life, crucifixion and resurrection. The scenes are filmed in Arizona, California, Nevada and Utah with Pyramid Lake in Nevada used to represent the Sea of Galilee, Lake Moab in Utah used to film the Sermon on the Mount and Death Valley in California as the setting where Jesus spends 40 days in the wilderness. Back in 1962, the explanation provided by the producer was that none of the scenes could have been filmed in the Middle East to provide the background of grandeur required to recreate the life of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Premiering on February 15th, 1965 at the Warner Cinerama Theatre in New York City, this film became a classic and now we can share it with family and friends during the holiday season. Don't miss it!<br /><br />After researching, here is a list of actors that played the main characters:<br />1. Jesus = Max von Sydow<br />2. Young man at the tomb = Pat Boone<br />3. Barabbas = Richard Conte<br />4. Mary Magdalene = Joanna Dunham<br />5. Herold Antipas = Jose Ferrer<br />6. John the Baptist = Charlton Heston<br />7. Caiaphas = Martin Landau<br />8. Judas Iscariot = David McCallum<br />9. Simon of Cyrene = Sidney Poitier<br />10. Pontius Pilate = Telly Savalas<br /><br />We dare you to find... John Wayne!
B0011NVCO8|4.0|Ridley Scott's American Gangster is a gritty portrait of the New York drug underworld in the early 1970's. With great performances by both DenzelWashington as drug kingpin Frank Lucas and Russell Crowe as cop Richie Roberts the film takes on both the gangster lifestyle and the currupt police problem of New York.    The film has all the earmarks of an epic. The story written by Steve Zaillian, while a bit long at times, effectively portrays life on the streets at the time period. The camara work by Harris Savides is both gritty and dark.    The disc I viewed was the HD DVD and while presenting a great picture and sound field is not without its problems. Now that HD has fallen to Blu Ray this may just be a passing footnote to the industry. The disc presents both the HD movie and the standard definition extended cut( some 18 minutes of additional scenes). Both versions present an audio commentary by Scott and Zaillian which is very informative. Scott takes on the problems of filmmaking on such an extensive project while Zaillian talks about the writing.    The HD special features include the deleted scenes that were placed back into the extended version and a five minute featurette with the real Frank Lucas and Richie Roberts. The problem is that this is all that is included as extras. The standard definition disc have many more additional features that are not included in the more expensive HD package.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I purchased this awhile ago but I didn't have a chance to listen to it.  After watching Twilight and being intrigued by the songs (not the acting haha), I gave the CD a try.    I got to say... most of the songs were perfectly chosen for the scenes, but some songs were misplaced and just boring.    1. Muse - Supermassive Black Hole  This is my favorite song on the CD. Very hectic and pumps you up.  Seeing how Muse inspired Stephenie Meyer while writing the series, I thought this song was pretty important.    2. Paramore - Decode  The lyrics pertain to Bella & Edward's complex relationship and how Edward can't \\"decode\\" Bella's thoughts. Wish it was in the movie though, not the credits.    3. The Black Ghosts - Full Moon  This was in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Song relates to how Bella comes to Forks for the first time.    4. Linkin Park - Leave Out All The Rest  This is a different sound coming from Linkin Park, but I loved it.  Again, this song was in the credits & not made of much use :/    5. Mutemath - Spotlight (Twilight Mix)  This song was played when Edward & Bella became \\"official.\\"  Clever song choice for the scene since all eyes were on the couple.    6. Perry Farrell - Go All The Way (Into the Twilight)  I didn't really like this song. It was probably chosen for its title \\"Into the Twilight\\".    7. Collective Soul - Tremble for My Beloved  Very mystique and eerie. Perfect for the car accident scene.    8. Paramore - I Caught Myself  Very catchy song. \\"Down to you, keep pushing and pulling me down to you.\\"  You can imagine Bella's struggle. Too bad this song was used in the wrong scene.    9. Blue Foundation - Eyes on Fire  Personally, I got to love this song. However, the dark lyrics didn't exactly match the scene in the movie.    10. Rob Pattinson - Never Think  This is Rob's first recorded song so I got to give props to him. It was sort of random in the movie, but listening to it at home was a whole different experience. It almost made me tear up... shh!    11. Iron & Wine - Flightless Bird, American Mouth  Perfect song for the perfect scene. It's very romantic & soft.    12. Carter Burwell - Bella's Lullaby  Burwell did an excellent job composing this piece. He's an excellent musician, but this song wasn't really what I was looking for as Bella's lullaby. When I read the book I imagined maybe Yiruma's \\"Love Me.\\"  The song should have been more personal. I think the reason why I gave it 4 stars is because of this song. It didn't display any kind of emotion \\"Edward\\" would have put in the song.
B000000XB9|5.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival is definitely one of the coolest bands of all-time. Frontman John Fogerty is one hell of a singer/songwriter. How can you not love classics like Down on the Corner, Fortunate Son, Proud Mary, Bad Moon Rising, Susie Q, and many more. This is how southern rock is supposed to be done, I highly recommend it! Good job fellas.

B0014DZ2VO|4.0|\\"Quantum of Solace,\\" the latest James Bond film and the second featuring Daniel Craig has its flaws, but is still a pretty spectacular film. The series is in full retooling mode, hardly recognizable when compared to the films of Sean Connery and Roger Moore. While closer to the darker sides of Timothy Dalton and Pierce Brosnan's Bonds, it does have more in common with the popular Jason Bourne series starring Matt Damon, which is not a bad thing.<br /><br />This Bond pickes up right after the end of Casino Royale, as Bond takes a prisoner for interrogation to M, again played by Dame Judy Dench. The interrogation and subsequent events uncovers a global conspiracy named Quantum, with members of prominence and power, including an admired environmentalist who is obviously up to no good. The rest of the film plays out as Bond races to find out and foil the villain's scheme, partnered with a revenge-minded woman, played by Olga Kurylenko.<br /><br />The negatives - This film is much shorter than most Bond films, which isn't good or bad by itself, but the film plays in parts like it had a bit too much cut out, most notably the scenes between Bond and Strawberry Fields, a female agent played by Gemma Arterton. Like many women, she tries to resist Bond's charms to no avail, but as events unfold, it is obvious that Fields and Bond had quite a bit of time together, which is not reflected in the final cut. The villain, played by Mathieu Almaric, does not convey much in the way of danger or menace. He doesn't need to be the kind of kitschy, cartoonish villain that the old Bond films are famous for, but he should at least raise the audiences hackles, but he does not. Finally, the tension between Bond and M is understandable, but every film shouldn't have Bond being stripped of his license and having him act any more of a free agent than he already does. It would be more realistic to show the continued development of their relationship with disagreements and dialogue rather than rely on a plot device that has been used numerous times in the Bond series.<br /><br />The positives, which far outweigh the negatives - Daniel Craig continues to prove that his Bond is like no other. His Bond is nuanced, troubled, and truly, truly dangerous. This Bond seems like someone who has a license to kill and is more apt to use it than any other Bond save Dalton's Bond. His acting talent gives Bond the gravitas and good humor that provides a balanced character. The action scenes have been updated and are breathtaking, and the potential for future films seem limitedless.<br /><br />Quantum of Solace bodes well for the future of the series since even though it is flawed, it is at the same time a very remarkable film.ice that has been used numerous times in the Bond series.

Quantum of Solace bodes well for the future of the series since even though it is flawed, it is at the same time a very remarkable film.
B0015AARJI|5.0|The controller has a heavier feel to it than the issued one for PS3.  What can I say that wasn't mentioned on other reviews.  This product works great. My only gripe is that PS3 should have made the dualshock the issued controller.
1551116448|5.0|This book was a pleasure to read, and I've recommended it to book club friends. A true classic.
0060922583|5.0|I at first was very dubious about reading this book. I study neuroscience, and to think of the brain as a hologram seemed at first insulting to me. But after getting into it, I became more and more fascinated by this idea of a holographic model. Talbot starts off with explaining what a hologram is and how this model can be applied to the brain and the universe. After this, he describes story, after story, after story of amazing supernatural, paranormal happenings all over the world. It seriously blew my mind and actually started me questioning science as we know it. I at first completely refused to accept that any scientific notion was real, according to the findings in this book, but came to realize it's only a lack of scientific development to accept these kinds of experiences that occur. At some point, science is going to go through a serious paradigm shift if it's to incorporate these ideas of how the world really works.     One of the most important messages to take away from this book, is the idea of the implicate and explicate order. The explicate order is what we see in reality, our bodies, the earth, a table, a flower. The implicate order, on the other hand, is the deeper reality, the real source of reality, out of which the explicate arises. This might be a hard concept to grasp at first, but Talbot does a great job in not only explaining this concept but providing a myriad of examples. One thing you should definitely check out after reading this book is the so-called Two Slit Experiment. Go youtube it, it's a 5 minute animation with Dr. Quantum and beautifully depicts one of the concepts Talbot tries to explain in the book.     I won't go into further detail about the book, but one last thing that really left me puzzled was the idea of: We literally create our own reality. And I don't mean figuratively, no, literally. The very existence of a conscious being creates it's own reality. The conscious mind changes the vibrations of reality, is constantly manipulating them. Definitely a book worth reading if you have even the slightest interest in what reality is, what consciousness is, what science is unable to explain and what our minds are truly capable of.
1595141715|2.0|I thought the idea for this book was really cool and it was written well (a very easy read). In my opinion the story was horrible and I kept waiting for something really bad to happen to this girl. I hated the main character (the girl who killed herself) she was whiny and blamed others for everything... She complained about others making her life hell when she didn't even try very hard and in the end tried to ruin the life of others. I was pretty much screaming at the main charter the whole time and felt it was a slap in the face to people who have real problems and deal with things much more serious.
0393327655|2.0|As others have said, this book suffers from the \\"destroy the village in order to save it\\" mentality that mirrors the attitudes of Harris' religious adversaries. He can rationalize his reverse intolerance any way he likes, but that's what it is.<br /><br />Like it or not, we secular humanists gain nothing by adopting the narrow tactics of religious extremists in responding to them. One makes common cause with one's ideological opponents as best one can---and sometimes that can't be done when the gulf is too wide. And sometimes it can. And that's how the world works.<br /><br />Diatribes like Harris' are, at best, distractions from trying to find those places of common accord, and a humanist jihad is NOT what secular humanists should be aspiring to.

1416594884|5.0|At its very end A Most Wanted Man may not be written carefully enough to remain convincing, once it has arrived at the inner world and motivations of 'Newt,' the devil-bearded C.I.A. operative who is on the scene outside the bank to explain to Bachmann the decision to seize (and 'render,' and torture) Dr. Abdullah and Issa Karpov. What makes the problem worse is that absolutely everything leading up to Newt's monologue is fantastic--right down to having the kidnapping van crash into Bachmann's 'taxi' in the middle of a paragraph, instead of at the start of one. You can hear and see the collision, and the lights. (Just as you could hear and see the lights and gunfire on the wall at the end of The Spy Who Came in from the Cold.)    I find the 'anti-Americanism' that other reviewers here complain of to be a false scent. Le Carré is anti-everything, pretty nearly, insofar as it involves a national identity, and he's certainly against any large, self-serving and secretive organization. That's in no way a problem for the novel, but a source of its strength. Barely contained outrage is Le Carré's plotting engine, in everything that he writes (even in The Tailor of Panama, which I think at its heart badly wanted to become something as close to pure comedy as Le Carré has ever written).    I find most of the human relationships in the book, including the ones that don't come off, completely convincing. No one working this terrain has ever described the besotted but well-meaning male brain, moment by moment, unbidden thought by thought, smile by sudden, flooding smile, so well as Le Carré does with Brue (his alter ego, and this novel's version of Barley Blair from The Russia House).    No--the only unworkable thing is the dialogue and set of thoughts that are given to the C.I.A. man at the end, when all is revealed. These revelations come off as tin-eared, and suggest that Le Carré might have done well simply to take a few weeks to listen to American voices, both for tone and content, as they talk about such things, before signing off on this last section. It may have been written in a rush.    For 'Newt' is made to say a lot, and a lot of what he says tends to spoil the reader's suspension of disbelief. There are problems at the technical level. In quick succession 'Newt' says, for example, both \\"Eye for a f--ing eye, Günther,\\" and a strangely British \\"Eh?\\" Profanity is a substitute for thought in most living conversation, and Le Carré puts it into the mouths of characters like Newt as an easy substitute, I think, for his own, novelist's thought--the difficult, sometimes morally disorienting work of inhabiting and giving voice to each of his characters' worlds.    In his best novels, Le Carré can show clearly how hard it is to have faith in any 'side.' Yet here it's impossible to be confused, for so much as a chapter, about where one's sympathies are to lie. Every word makes it clear that we should identify wholly with the radiant heroine, and with the feelings she inspires in everyone around her.    But these are quibbles. I would agree with the '95 percent good' assessment above: A Most Wanted Man is a terrific book, with an almost unbearably tense and suspenseful conclusion. Its understory is lovely: the improbable hope of somehow turning pure after a lifetime of impurity, like a Lipizzaner lightening as it ages. And I can't wait to see where the vein of subject matter that he has tapped here is going to lead its author.

B001FSDOZO|4.0|My first listen was a little tainted....in fear Mutt Lange was going to turn these guys into 80's Def Leppard.  Def Lep is great, but I like Nickelback's sound and didn't want a change.  Besides Leopardized backing vocals on a few of the songs, Lange didn't do much in my opinion.  Tracks 1,2,3, 8 and 9 are my favorites, but after many a few listens, every song will grow on you.

159102594X|5.0|This has been a great year for discovering awesome fantasy authors.  Scott Lynch, who may be my new favorite author after Martin, recommended Abercrombie so I had to check him out.  I didn't regret it.  He writes with a style unlike anything I've read, filled with quick wit, great dialogue and clever, subtle humor.      His world is instantly engrossing and packed with intriguing and incredibly flawed characters.  Some readers may be turned off that some of the POV characters have only a few redeeming qualities, and one or two might be downright unlikeable.  For me, who relishes in reading anything out of the ordinary, unlikable is likeable.  Noble and just characters become predictable and boring.  Here, you won't find either of those annoying traits.  Each character is incredibly different from one another and has their own purpose and role in the story.    The back of the book many only mention four main characters but there are really six, with one that doesn't really get his own POV until later on and another who simply doesn't show up until later.    We have Jezal: the pretty boy Union soldier who cares about nothing but his big upcoming fencing match, and even that he goes about half-heartedly.  His character starts out obnoxious but he starts to become interesting when he finds a love interest and other challenges.    Glokta:  My personal favorite character.  He is a former Union hero who was captured in a war with a southern Empire and tortured for two years straight.  He is now a cripple with a very nasty and sarcastic attitude who ironically became a torturer himself.  (Any fans of Martin may notice the resemblance to Tyrion, although Tyrion is probably a bit softer hearted.)   Logen:  Possibly the most descent of the characters.  His intentions are good, but he is bread to be a killing machine.  A gargantuan man from the cold north, he is a legendary fighter known as the Bloody Nine (for his missing finger, one of his many battle scars.)  However, the farther the story progresses, the more one learns that he is a man to be feared.    Bayaz:  A man who claims to be from the original order of ancient Magi, and regardless of his claims he definitely has control of very intense forces.  His intentions seem unclear at first but he becomes the catalyst that combines all of these other plot threads together.  Colonel West:  At first he is only seen in Jazel's point-of-view as his fencing partner.  But he soon gets a greater role and his own chapters.  He seems to have a level head but he also has some serious problems, mostly of the family sort.  Ferro:  The late-comer to the book, she is possibly the most mysterious of these characters.  Once part of the empire that Glokta had fallen victim to, she is now associated with no one and has made it her entire purpose to take her vengeance on the Empire for what they did to her.  She has uncanny fighting abilities, but the man who shows up to save her that she reluctantly follows is the only one keeping her alive.    Each of these characters has their own unique tale, but they are all masterfully woven together.  Readers who are looking for a more linear reading experience like Tolkien, Eddings, Feist and many of the long time fantasists might be confused and disappointed.  This book is an incredible tapestry and possibly more disjointed than Martin's Song of Ice and Fire.  This is not a bad thing though.  On the contrary it's amazingly written and incredibly entertaining.  All of the various POVs show this unique fantasy setting from many facets and it's all great.  The fighting scenes when they come about are greatly detailed and make you feel like you're right there, and magic (as it always should be as far as I'm concerned) is a rare and terrifying thing when it comes about.  All of these elements do pull together into one more focused plot, but it takes some figuring out and some patience to get there.      This isn't a reading experience for the faint of heart.  There isplenty of blood, guts, swearing and sex (I'm not complaining though,) but it's all done with finesse and skill.  Joe Abercrombie proves that fantasy is more than Harry Potter and Narnia.  He is a great author and if you take what I said into consideration, he won't dissapoint.

0316096199|5.0|Lucky is a remarkable piece of literature. Savagely raped near her college in a tunnel that had seen similar crimes ending in victim mortality, one police officer commented she had been one of the lucky ones. The title reflects Sebold's talent for irony and drawing deeper meaning. The writing is top-notch, stylish and vivid, but particularly impressive to this reader is how she managed to show the greater picture. The small show... the battle between her and the rapist toward conviction... served as the foundation, but the big show is how the world responded to Alice. She skillfully demonstrated that talking about her experience and even seeking justice for the crime was generally considered in poor taste making her undesirable company. A well done memoir.

0375826726|4.0|As a fan over the 1st 2 books and the story in it's entirety, i have been eagerly awaiting the release of this book.  The book starts and ends at an excellent pace, with an epic battle with the Razak to start and another interesting war at the end.  I felt that Christopher did a good job at taking his time in this book and really developing the characters.  Extending the series to 4 books really allowed him to dig deeper into the story line.  At times i felt like the plot took a while to develop, however in the end, knowing the characters in detail really allowed me to feel the storyline as it intensified.<br /><br />Without risking any spoilers i will simply say that if you were a fan of the first 2 books, you will enjoy this one.  If you are a die hard fantasy reader, well you may be a little put off.  Christopher is a good author, whom i believe continues to get better.  He's no Tolkein, but there is potential.<br /><br />Pick this up if you enjoy a nice long read... 748 pages isn't a joke :-)
1416594884|4.0|On the Sunday after Thanksgiving, I woke up and dug right into John Le Carre's latest: A Most Wanted Man.  Wonderful, taunt, without \\"Bourne Conspiracy\\" chases, but with plenty of tension.   I was forced to stop at page 272 of a 322-page book in order to prepare for my return from vacation.  The forced stop allowed me time to realize that Le Carre's prose is never overblown but is always precisely descriptive.  Some writers, as they age, go on and on, making the books fatter and fatter.  This book has embraced a difficult and layered situation and emerged as a novel that is under 400 pages.    Yes, like some of Le Carre's recent books, the Americans come off as the bad guys.  I would be disturbed if it were not for the fact that we have been the new Imperialists lately--and not very good imperialists at that.  In Le Carre's novels, the old world is immoral and conflicted, but the new world is immoral and frightening sure of themselves.  I would still recommend the book.  Perhaps we can convince James Sallis or another American writer to give us a nuanced view of the American spy world.  As it is, this book describes people forced to choose between several bad choices.  They are human; they are us.  [[ASIN:0312155131 Death Will Have Your Eyes: A Novel About Spies]]

These books keep on giving, with every read giving you new insights, and new joys.     I have reread NOTW twice since its arrival in 2007, and i enjoyed it more with each subsequent read.  Its a wonderful tale, artfully told, and I anxiously await the arrival of the sequels....
0321525655|4.0|Since presentations have become a larger (and more important) part of my professional life and given that they are now targeted at the highest level of my organization, I decided to re-evaluate my skills as well as my approach.     This book has proven to be exactly had I hoped for: a fresh change of perspective.  While it does not contain any new found wisdom, it certainly provides something equally important: simple ideas that make you better, more confident AND that stick to your mind. (Well for some presenters, it might even prove to be a new found wisdom, judging by the dozens of lousy presentations that I have attended in my career).    I should stress though that while simplicity is the core idea in this book, this does not mean that it is targeted to those looking for \\"quick & dirty\\" productivity tips.     On the contrary, I have found that I now devote more time in the preparation of a presentation. Because it is now clear to me that editing is the most demanding part of the process.   The book has helped me understand what is important to communicate and what is not.   How to extract the essence of complex ideas and present them in a simple, informative manner that engage the audience, not bore them to death.  If I had to write just a one line comment, this would be that it has made me regard each presentation as an enjoyable creative challenge and not as a mundane task.     It was certainly a joy to read and I really feel that I benefited, not only as a professional but also as a person, since most of us are also expected to convince, to educate and to inspire others, outside the realm of our professional lives.    One final note apart from the content but regarding the book itself: while I have always found Amazon's service to be uber professional and top notch, I was quite disappointed that this particular book arrived at less than perfect condition. Given that the packaging was almost bulletproof (and it contained two other books), this leads me to assume that the cosmetic damages were there prior to its dispatch.

B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Standing alone, this DVD is excellent. My own personal opinion is that I enjoyed previous releases better for the extra contents. I prefer \\"making of\\" shorts and documentaries in place of skits, sketches, and SNL performances. I'm sure they are more fun to create though. On a positive note, we know much more about them as individuals in the last 10 years because the performances are less canned. The concert footage has come a long way from the Rio performance that was thrown together after a rain storm. Still, I'm not sure I'd continue in the direction of comedy. The 20 years of serious music covered up a spontaneous sense of humor only sometimes seen live. Name a \\"video\\" on Chronicles that is not dated. In retrospect, I'll bet half of the RUSH videos (especially the obscure ones NOT on Chronicles) weren't lucrative financially for the trio. An online extra from the Colbert Report showed them failing to successfully play Tom Sawyer on the Rockstar game. THAT was classically funny. Appearances from Jerry Stiller, South Park, Bob and Doug etc. make the band to appear to be more mainstream. Dedicated Rush fans want them to remain our little secret. We'd also like them to get their due too. Like from the RNR Hall of Fame... AHEM!

B001F12J48|1.0|The first time that I ever saw The Polar Express it was in the IMAX 3-D format and we found it absolutely enthralling. I eagerly purchased the DVD when it was released, and we still loved it even though it was not in 3-D. When I learned that it was being re-released on DVD in a 3-D version I automatically ordered a copy even though I already owned it on DVD. I was very disappointed. The 3-D technology on the home version is not nearly as compelling as the process used in the theatrical version. I don't know all of the ins and outs of theatrical 3-D effects, but I remember it being far superior than what I just started to watch tonight. I saved the glasses from the IMAX 3-D presentation of this film, and both lenses are a light grey tint, while the home 3-D version uses the old red & blue lens technology resulting in a blurry double image. If you already own this movie don't waste your money expecting a true 3-D experience- you won't get it here.

0143038419|4.0|Liz Gilbert had what many would consider to be the perfect life. She had a loving husband with whom she was trying to have a baby, she had an amazing job, and a brand new home with which her and her family could share. Unfortunately, Liz realized she was unhappy with her life when she found herself crying on the bathroom floor at three in the morning. She did not want to be married, she did not want to have a baby, she did not want her brand new house, she did not want her life. So, she got a divorce (no, it was not just that easy) and she embarked on a journey across the three I's; Italy, India, and Indonesia.    Liz's writing style is witty and conversational. She's funny and forthcoming with her thoughts, fears, and feelings. She often makes her reader laugh out loud by some of her quips and metaphors.     The section on Italy was full of interesting characters, historical tidbits, and delicious food. And don't forget the gorgeous Italian men and the beauty of the language. I thoroughly enjoyed every part of her four month stay in Italy. I would have been more than thrilled if the entire book was about Italy. Unfortunately, Liz needed to move on to India. India started interestingly enough but soon lost my interest. Unfortunately, I feel there is a limit to how much I can read about one person's meditation and praying practices. However, in India we meet Richard from Texas. Richard from Texas has an attitude and personality as big as the state he is from! He was funny and insightful...Liz was lucky to have found him seeing as how he helped her realize her true potential and that she could forgive and love herself. Liz finally leaves the Ashram after four months and moves on to Indonesia. In Indonesia she meets healers and expatriates. Here, Liz learns to open her heart to not only herself but to others as well.     All in all I was happy to be able to take this journey with this intelligent and funny woman. Liz's account did not seem over the top as some memoirscan be but was written in a true and natural voice. I am thrilled to have been able to eat with her in Italy, pray with her in India, and finally love with her in Indonesia.
031606792X|2.0|Breaking Dawn is the final book in Bella's point of view, and I must say it didn't live up to it's expectations.<br /><br />Edwards relationship with Bella was not as strong in the previous novels.  I have to admit the wedding scene was great, well written. However after that it seems like their relationship just became about sex and was just kissing.  In a way I was expecting this because what made the book series so great was the idea that he was madly in love with her but was faced with the challenge of wanting to kill her. Yet by her becoming a vampire, the thrill of that is gone.  So, i don't like how their relationship lacked the spark it once had.<br /><br />Breaking Dawn was full of many ideas and thoughts that simply weren't followed up on, for example Bella at one point decides she wants to stay human for a while and go to college, problems arise and it's not once mentioned again.  There are other examples like this in the text.  Stephenie Meyer could have excluded a lot of irrelevant details, that simply took away from the book and made it drag.<br /><br />Mary sues killed the story.  The book felt like I was reading a mediocre fan fiction. One that if I were reading off another site, I would've stopped reading. The whole pregnant situation is very common, she could have used that mary sue and make it her own, but she didn't.<br /><br />The whole \\"battle\\" at the end was completely pointless.  I don't get the point of setting up everything for nothing.  I think Stephenie Meyer probably just wanted to add more characters for future novels, but I think that was a stupid thing to do.  It made the ending weak.<br /><br />As for Reneesme, I thought she was okay, if I were witting the book, I wouldn't have made Bella pregnant.  Reneesme basically caused all the conflicts from the old book to disappear.  It was an easy way out for Stepehie Meyer to keep from having to solve everything.  For that reason, I didn't like her, or her silly name.<br /><br />Would I ever recommend this book, no!  It was a waste of my time. I love the Twilight series but this was a horrible ending to a good series.of my time. I love the Twilight series but this was a horrible ending to a good series.
B001F7MSG6|4.0|[[ASIN:B001F7MSG6 Hellboy II: The Golden Army [Blu-ray]]] Hellboy II: The Golden Army is a fun ride with excellent special effects. Ron Perlman is as usual wonderful in this part. It looks amazing on Blu-Ray. Even if you saw it before give it another look on Blu-Ray, it's like seeing it for the first time and really appreciation it in it's totality.
B000JLSLZQ|4.0|First of all, the production of the film is as good as the play itself! Now, having the chance to see it in Blu-ray gives you the opportunity to enjoy this wonderful experience almost in a live-like stage.
B001GAOY5U|2.0|I first bought this blu-ray because it touted 3-D.  Unfortunately, the 3-D colors (pink or green) distract you from the movie.  The story of the movie was boring.  I would not recommend it to anyone.
B001EQ5ZJK|1.0|A bad self help book, not a science book.  Amazon.com did the author an injustice by not categorizing this book correctly.
B00168OINK|5.0|[[ASIN:B00168OINK Kung Fu Panda [Blu-ray]]] KUNG FU PANDA IS WONDERFUL, EXCITING, SPELLBINDING, INCREDIBLE, CHARMING, ADORABLE, AWESOME AND ON BLU-RAY IT IS SIMPLE MARVELOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B001CD6FKS|5.0|Ever since i was a kid, I always dreamed of the day they'd make a Speed Racer movie. So when it finally came, it was going back to my childhood years!!!! I was so excited that at the end I was shouting with the audience!!! Now, having this wonderful Blu-ray edition at home allows me to enjoy over and over again the adventures that kept me going as a child!!!
B001DHXT1G|4.0|I played this blu-ray on my surround sound system and it literally frightens anyone that is calmly seeing the scenes and all of sudden...the HULK appears.  The quality of picture and the audio is fantastic!  Even for those that hate comic book based movies, it's a must see!
B001JOIEZ4|2.0|I hoped this would have been a great CD but was completely dissappointed. If I could download a few songs rather than waste my money I would. I like Paramore, Collective Soul, Linkin Park, and even Rob Pattinson (I love this song actually... him and Paramore's \\"Decode\\" are really all I wanted). Mutemath is ok and Bella's Lullaby is average but not at all what I thought it should sound like. In my opinion the rest is just awful.
B000A6T1JU|3.0|I would suggest finding the original theatrical release of this film if you want to relive the memories from the first time you saw the movie and especially if you want to share it with a friend who has never seen it before. I think the director's cut is more for a true Warriors Fan-like myself. The original version was more suspenseful and in my opinion the tempo is more of a thrill ride. I do like the Director's cut with the added Comic Book cut away scenes but it just didn't seem to move as well as the original. Still an awesome soundtrack and characters etc...
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Have not used it to a great amount yet but what I have done has shown a great addition to the cameras function. A larger unit may be better for a pro but for an amateur this unit is handy, compact, and much easier to use
B000002GKT|5.0|ranks right up there with live At Leeds as a best ever live release. Marriott sings with an over the top demented passion while overheated Marshalls happily distort the blues and R&B into an almost mettallic kick in the pants. This was the top dog back in the 70's...and it holds up just as well today...an absolute classic. Frampton should be ashamed of leaving this band...$$$ aint everything....
B0010X8NF0|5.0|This is a wonderfully charming, poignant, gorgeous film.  As a long time Wes Anderson fan, I highly recommend it. One hint for folks who are new to Anderson's odd cinematic tales: watch them a second time. The first time you're along for the ride, wondering where this strange guy is taking you. The second time around, you become aware of the journey's nuances, hidden meanings, and you feel like you've discovered a gem.
B000001Y42|4.0|The first album from Limp Bizkit was very different from \\"Significant Other\\" and \\"Chocolate Starfish\\". It had a much darker atmosphere, and the overall sound was much heavier. This album dealt with two-faced people & annoying neighbors & trying to find out who you really were, wheareas \\"Chocolate Starfish\\" dealt with the media, money, not giving a f**k what people think, etc.<br /><br />The songs here are really catchy, and sometimes depressing. \\"Pollution\\" and \\"Leech\\" are the heaviest songs here, and they're what defined the early days of Limp Bizkit. The singles \\"Counterfeit,\\" \\"Faith,\\" and \\"Sour,\\" have never sounded better. \\"Clunk\\" sounds like a filler, so it's not that good. \\"Nobody Loves Me,\\" \\"Indigo Flow,\\" \\"Everything,\\" and \\"Stalemate\\" are the darkest songs on this album, so don't expect any Keep-Rollin' beats here. I wonder what happened to these guys, anyway? I guess it's money and fame that prompted them to go on with \\"Chocolate Starfish\\". Oh well.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|My favorite Zombie movie. The best way to see this is unrated and uncut. Not for the faint at heart or those easily grossed out. Lots of blood,and exposed intestines. Ken Foree was great in this. He is one of 4 survivors trapped in a mall with zombies. They fly to the mall after a drug bust in an apartment where zombies are on the loose. They escape via chopper to a mall. The mall is filled with zombies. Tom Savini leads a gang of bikers who want the mall for themselves and go after Ken & co. (all GREAT performances) and you actually feel bad for the zombies who are getting attacked by Savini & his bikers. Cool twists, cool flick,great acting, & SPFX the best Zombie film if you ask me. The best version of this on DVD is the ultimate edition from Anchor Bay which has 3 versions of the movie(including Dario Argento's version)..
B000AGTPUU|5.0|What more can be said.... a classic for all the family... must have for any holiday collection
B001ED7C58|5.0|I just purchased the soundtrack on a whim today and the songs really capture the different scenes in the feature perfectly. You can see the scenes play out as you listen. But the bonus tracks are what really captivated me. The bonus tracks, Robert Pattinson's songs, are startling and remarkable. His voice is so full of soul and life way beyond his young years. I was so taken by his songs; I was bewitched. Then I read the lyrics and was profoundly emotionally touched. The raw emotion in the songs are far beyond anything that I have heard in a while. If you have not heard them yet, go listen and allow his voice to envelope you. You will not regret it.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|After watching this movie in 3D, I doubt I would purchase another 3D DVD as I found the 3D effect would sometimes disappear if I moved my head slightly.  The 3D effect didn't work as well as I had expected.  The movie itself was fun to watch.  My suggestion would be to watch the 2D version.
B001CN2WXM|5.0|I just finished watching this for the first time in a long time. This is an EXCELLENT film noir. Its not often a modern day noir hits the jackpot but this did. This movie takes place around the time where classic Film Noirs were being made. The pace is swift, the acting is fantastic, all the stars were perfect in their roles. Excellent story. It reminded me of the great Cagney, Bogart and Robinson gangster/noir movies. It might take a few times to understand it all, but you will be truly rewarded with a fantastic movie, a must of fans of Film Noir.the cast - Kevin Spacey,Russell crowe,James Ellroy,Kim Basinger are just FANTASTIC. Highly recommended. Not too terribly gory for those with a squeamish stomach. Great DVD with bonus features galore...
B0008ENICU|5.0|This is a wonderful classic movie... one of few to showcase women of the times as primary cast... ahead of it's time... also great for historical view of women... good for young women today to see where they came from and how far they have come...
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Its time we fans, and (we are the most popular fans by the way out there)get what we deserve: the whole deal. I truly believe all six were the greatest films of all time and would be astonishing on blu-ray. Lets face it, the blu-ray was built for these movies!! Put all six together with iv-vi and i-iii with the original and special editions. One down side to this is the whole 'where do we go from here thing' which is something that Lucas will have deal with eventually anyway.
0142405809|5.0|Have previously bought Gruffalo book from same author and my son also enjoys this one for a bedtime read.
B001DXS4E2|5.0|My family and I have been watching Holiday Inn every Christmas Eve for the past twenty one years! All three kids know the songs by heart. To me, no film has the mixture of sentiment and elegance that this one has.     Our discussion all that time, however, has been \\"Why won't they colorize it?,\\" along with speculation about what colors gowns and other clothing might be. (Okay, my son could care less.) Never has a film's subject matter and production called for colorization more.     We always figured that the unfortunate racial stereotypical material would keep it from ever being released in an improved version. (At one point Bing slaps some blackface makeup on Marjorie Reynolds for the \\"Abraham\\" number, which causes her to say \\"...and here I was hoping to be pretty!\\" Ouch.)    But at long last it's available in a colorized version, and it's like watching the film completely anew. Details I had never noticed before pop right off the screen in this one (the salads in the foreground of the kitchen shot, the greenery in the \\"You're Easy To Dance To\\" number, the log cabin table center-pieces in the Lincoln's birthday number, Fred's star-spangled 4th of July hankie) - it's really surprising what a difference the color makes in the details.     And I could swear the sound is improved, as well. I had never before heard a triangle being played in the Washington's Birthday number - but it's there now.     Only one disappointment: We had always thought Marjorie Reynolds' gown in the Valentine's Day number was a deep red or maroon, but here it's rendered as black (with a pink heart pin). Perhaps the documentation exists that indicates that was the actual color of the dress or maybe it was a judgement call from the fashion lady doing the color palette design - but we think it would look better as a deep red.     Whatever... this well-wrought release was a long time coming and perhaps it will cause this wonderful movie musical to finally achieve the fame it deserves. (It is far,far better than the later color \\"White Christmas.\\")     Get it, and as the Holiday Inn newspaper clipping says, \\"God Bless America!\\"
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This was probably the best movie I saw in 2008. The Indiana Jones movie came in a close second. Heath Ledger took the joker in directions I wish others had taken him. I don't understand why people were dissing the length of the film. It could have been 6 hours for all I care. I found it to be pure cinematic excellence, plus I think in terms of movies Chris Nolan stumbled upon what can finally be determined is the real Batman. The story is great, the acting is incredible. However, I wish they would left somewhere else to go. A third film would have been great, considering most movies lately have been so terrible its scary!!
0757302661|3.0|I recommend this book to all who are pregnant! It gives an excellent new point of view to giving birth. This is especially helpful for those who are afraid of giving birth or scared of pain. This book hopefully will change their minds completely and see matters in a more positive light.
0307269752|5.0|Lots of interesting characters and plot developments and twists with a roller coaster ride end that while quite satisfying also leaves the reader thirsty for more.<br /><br />Tragically for him and his readers the author has passed away before seeing his work published.<br /><br />Fortunately for us readers there are still two more books to come in this trilogy.
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie is perfection in every way. It is so perfect that I never get tired of watching it over and over again. We really have the impression of living in Jane Austen's time when watching that movie. All the actors are brilliant, above all Allison Steadman who is superb as Mrs. Bennet.   Hats off Andrew Davies, Sue Birtwistle and Simon Langton for such a \\"chef d'oeuvre\\".
B000HT3P7E|5.0|This show is great.  I missed the first season, so I've been catching up.  The first season is great.<br /><br />If you're reading this and contemplating buying it, you probably already know that.  So I'll discuss the extras:  A handful of the episodes have commentary either by some combination of writers, creators, actors and director.  They don't say much, but it is fun to listen to if you're a fan of the show or the actors.<br /><br />You will learn about who recorded the title song and which real bar the bar from the show is based upon.  The other extras are fun:  a video montage and a year-one yearbook in particular.
0307346617|5.0|While I have always shown a fondness for zombie films and books - 28 Days Later is truly epic - and I plan on writing my own in due time (check back around Book 5), Max Brooks took this title to another level following the success of his Zombie Survival Guide. Following the conclusion of the Zombie War, the piece follows like a well-edited war documentary: the narrator interviews survivors from a multitude of locations to draw the reader into a deeper understanding of the horrors within a zombie world. Rather than employing a passive narration, it is the unique voice of each character that pushes this title to new levels, leaving the darkest sections vague and obscure like any person accustomed to war would keep them.    There is such depth, though, to his imagination that it is almost staggering to question how long Brooks sat in development of his zombie world. The varying responses by governments, the responses by different citizens, or even the effects of weather and climate on zombies are all explored to full, yet sometimes questionable, understanding. My personal favorite: the \\"Lobo,\\" a combination shovel and battle-axe put to great use throughout the novel. It is one of but many ingenius concepts envisioned by Brooks in his personal post-apocalyptic world - one that everyone should explore.    [...]
B000N6TYLW|4.0|I am watching this season for the first time.  I followed the show on ABC Family, but never saw the 6th or 7th seasons.<br /><br />I hear people complain about how horrible it was, but I have to disagree.  I think that the characters have grown and changed, as expected.  Definitely worth watching for a Gilmore Girls fan.
B000IU3XTM|4.0|It was with a bit of trepidation that I purchased this CD, since I had heard mixed reviews from friends and read several negative reviews from critics. I fell in love with a couple of songs on \\"O\\" and found many of the others simply okay. But I decided to purchase \\"9\\" after listening to short sound clips from a couple of songs.<br /><br />It definitely did not disappoint. Haunting, moving, rousing, heart-breaking...these are some of the words I would use to describe the songs. I think this CD is a bit more raw and definitely has an edgier, harder sound on a couple of songs.<br /><br />I would recommend it, especially if, like me, you found \\"O\\" just a tiny bit boring after a few listens. I think this CD will manage to hold my attention quite a bit longer.
0689870280|4.0|What else is there to say? I love it. My baby loves it! The rhythm and rhyme just lull you right to sleep, and the importance of nightly tasks become a joy rather than a task. Highly recommended!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I am 21 year old college student and I love Taylor. I fell in love with her debut CD and couldnt wait for Fearless to come out. And she did not disappoint me. Her song writing is incredible and although her vocals arent huge like some country artists, I think they compliment her lyrics perfectly.     For all the critics that claim her songs are repetitive and young: SHE IS 18! There is no way she should be singing and writing songs that Martina or Carrie are singing because she hasnt experienced any of that. She has barely graduated high school! Let her be herself and sing about love and heartbreak because thats what she knows. On her THIRD album is where Im looking for some growth in  lyrics, but not at 18. Put yourself in her position.     Now for the songs I liked and didnt like:  Love Story is amazing. No one can argue that.   Fearless is simple but cute. Not sure it should be a single.  Hey Stephen should def be a single. its so light and airy. Perfect for summer time! I love it  White Horse is the second single and should do well. She sounds wonderful.  You Belong with Me is an old topic but she executes it very well.  The Way I loved you is one of my favs. Def should be a single.  Fifteen and Best Days are wonderful stories, but not for radio.    The rest are simple and not my favorites, but they are enjoyable. To have atleast 6 songs that could be radio hits is incredible. So give this girl some credit! I cant wait to see what she has in store for the 3rd album.
B001H5X7I4|4.0|Obscene, offensive and totally hilarious. \\"Tropic Thunder\\" takes an affectionate brickbat to Hollywood's affair with action heroes and war movies, referencing movies as diverse as [[ASIN:B00005AUJQ Platoon]] and Eddie Murphy's...[[ASIN:0783225539 Nutty Professor]]!?! Yes, it really does jump all over the cinematic map. It is not as inept a parody as some of the [[ASIN:B00004Z4WQ Scary Movie]] series or knock-offs, which has a lot to do with the script and Ben Stiller's direction.<br /><br />\\"Tropic Thunder\\" stays on a tight leash, filling moments with satirical jabs at both the films in the genre but at the actors themselves. Robert Downey's \\"blacker-than-you\\" transformation from a Russell Crowe bad-boy to Richard Roundtree/Fred Williamson blaxploitation star takes stabs at method acting (\\"I don't break character until after the DVD commentary!\\") and are the funniest in the movie. But there's nothing more outrageous than Tom Cruise, head shaved and body latexed, as an obnoxious studio head. He steals every scene he pops up in and reminds us all just how effective an actor he is when he isn't jumping up and down on TV couches.<br /><br />It's the cast that really makes the script work. Everyone in every role plays like an ace, from Stiller, Downey, Jack Black, Jay Baruchel (Kevin Sandusky) and Brandon T. Jackson as rapper Alpa Chino to the support roles filled by the likes of Nick Nolte, Steve Coogan and Tobey McGuire. There's hardly a thing in \\"Tropic Thunder\\" that doesn't work, although the easily offended might have their gag reflexes tested by \\"Satan's Alley,\\" \\"Simple Jack\\" or \\"Half-Squat.\\" As far as taking the wizz out of itself, the only movie of the last few years to match \\"tropic Thunder\\" has been [[ASIN:B000WGYMGK The Simpsons Movie.]] As far as I'm concerned, that's pretty good company.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I've bought in a long time.  The music wasn't what I was expecting, but it fit the story better than I could have imagined.  The only downer was that the tracks on the CD aren't in the same order that they were in the movie, so if you want to listen to them in order, you have to take the time to program the CD player to play them in order. Other than that, it's awesome.  I don't think I've listened to any other CD scince I got this one.  I highly recomend it.
0440539811|5.0|This is the most brilliant work of fiction that I have ever read and I read a lot. It may be too strange or complex for some. It is not an easy read because of all the various intersecting plot lines, but it definitely worth the effort. I've already read seven of his books and I'm working on the eighth now.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I missed the whole first season. Must have been in a cave.  Then I watched a couple episodes of the second season and was HOOKED!!.  My neighbor filled me in on a few things from last season, but that was not enough, so I bought this. I watched all four discs in just two days. How is that for obsessive??!!! Now I've preordered season two, but I digress. Talk about people with issues, everyone in this show has something to hide, just like the sixties, they never tell what's really on  their minds until it is too late. Can't wait for season three.
0553381687|5.0|This series is the best I've read in a long time.  It's very well written, will keep you guessing, and you'll come to care about the characters (even the antagonists!).<br /><br />George R.R. Martin is brilliant.
1401302378|3.0|The Long Tail refers to the shape of the graph with high sales volume of a few hit products in the head, and low volume of many products in the tail. The book is about the shift from an economy of mass-market hits to an economy of niches.    \\"The average Borders carries around 100,000 titles. Yet about a quarter of Amazon's book sales come from outside its top 100,000 titles.\\" Amazon and eBay overcome the scarcity of local shelf space for physical products. Digital products (such as MP3 downloads) are ideal since there is no warehousing cost.    \\"Netflix reckoned that 95 percent of its 25,000 DVDs... rented at least once a quarter. ...98 percent of [Amazon's] top 100,000 books sold at least once a quarter.\\" It strikes me that the examples in the book explain the benefits to online retailers of carrying a long tail inventory; however, unless you are selling battleships, one sale per quarter does not sound so profitable for the producer.     \\"In a world of infinite choice, context -not content- is king.\\" Directly and indirectly, customers help other customers with similar interests to make informed choices. This includes product reviews (like this one) and Amazon's Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought [these items] feature. But you probably already knew that.    The Long Tail, originally published as an article in Wired, is long-winded as a book. I think the point is made in the first couple of chapters, and loses momentum thereafter. I bought this book in an airport to pass the time on an international flight. Airport bookstores don't sell long tail items, but in a world of infinite choice, I'm sure you could find something more interesting on Amazon.
B000002HK4|3.0|I just don't get Dream Theater.  This is not very good songwriting if you ask me.  Compared to any progressive rock band from the 70's, these guys can't compete with ANY of them.  Putting Dream Theater in the same category as Yes, Genesis, Rush, or heck, even Kansas and Uriah Heep, is pretty laughable.      Occasionally some guitar tricks will catch my attention, but the vocal melodies leave me scratching my head and asking \\"What's so great about this?\\"  I *really* want to know if people who are fans of Dream Theater ever seriously listened to artists like King Crimson, Yes, and early Genesis.  Because THOSE are genius bands capable of memorable songwriting skills.      Track one on this album, which is 20 minutes long, is pretty boring.  Some nice guitar tricks aside, and everything else is rather ordinary, and features a lead singer who can't sing a melody (or doesn't want to sing a melody, whatever).      It's not really a chore sitting through an epic Dream Theater track, because at least the band is trying to write good music, and the band members probably mean well.  Just make sure you check out 70's progressive rock before deciding whether this is deserving of classic music or not.      Update- October 25, 2009.      A recent reader comment has inspired me to check out the opening track once again and give it another chance, and... it seemed to work because I definitely enjoy the 20-minute monster more than I did last time I played the album.  The vocals have clicked, and the many guitar riffs sound better to me as well.   The rating has now moved up to a 3 out of 5, instead of a 2.
0385340990|5.0|This is a great read, with richly drawn characters who you like and feel you know by the end of the book.  I rarely laugh out loud while reading but I laughed several times while reading this and cried as well.
B0000009SG|5.0|Frank Zappa has a talent for creative goofiness.  That means, even though your first opinion upon listening to any one of his albums (except Hot Rats) is that he's deliberately singing in a goofy style, his ability to put a song together creativey and make it sound like something *no one* else could possibly create makes him an original genius.  It really does.    Over-Nite Sensation captures every aspect of Frank Zappa's creative and silly side perfectly.  Could it be the ultimate Frank Zappa album?  Well, I choose Hot Rats as the mans BEST album, but Over-Nite Sensation isn't far behind.  This album, unlike Hot Rats, has vocals, and silly lyrics about going to Montana, dental floss, um... girls doing naughty things, and more!      Meanwhile, his FLAT OUT AWESOME guitar soloing skills are implemented into the songwriting, and other unpredictable things such as female vocals in the background.      It's just a really great album, though a very short one.  I highly recommend this album.  You might not like it, I admit, because he really dips into his goofy side here, but he also backs up his silly ways with great songwriting and a creative touch unlike anyone else.
0061020710|5.0|I am a high school English teacher who values the classics. I am not a book \\"snob,\\" but I do get bored with predictable serialized novels. I picked this book up at a used book store because a student had mentioned the author, and I was curious.  Now, I am HOOKED on Discworld!  The writing, unlike many \\"mass market paperbacks\\" is clever, hysterically funny, full of literary techniques, and absolutely addictive.  I have read only two other Pratchett novels so far (Hogfather and Wyrd Sisters) and I cannot wait to get more.  Anyone who likes to think while reading and who loves to laugh (out loud, at times, and causing the curious stares of others) should DEFINITELY take a little trip to Discworld.  I LOVE THESE BOOKS!
B000H5V8DG|3.0|I enjoyed J.J. Abram's creation while it was still on TV. So to have the complete set is a real pleasure. The box set is worth it if you are a serious fan. Normal DVD cases will do, but the cube is just more fun. There is a hidden compartment, writings on the exterior and a small book.     My only warning is that the individual cases have a tendency to scratch the DVDs, at least in my experience. But you almost feel like you are holding a replica of a Rambaldi design.
B000V1Y43W|3.0|As is usual with a Pixar film, Cars has excellent visuals, and they really shine in the Blu-Ray version of the film.  The movie is sure to be a hit with the kids, but falls short in one area that other Pixar films have excelled -- appeal to adults.  I viewed this one once, and will probably leave it on the shelf for the sake of completeness, but I can't see watching it again, like I have with Monsters, Inc., or the exceptional WALL-E.  If you're looking for something to entertain the kids, save some money and get it on DVD instead of Blu-Ray.  If you're looking to build a complete collection of Pixar on Blu-Ray, it's worth the money.
0060930349|5.0|I read this book years ago and wrote a review that seems to have been removed.  This is by far the most in-depth, detailed, and interesting history you will ever read. It amuses me that so many people call it \\"biased,\\" etc.  Johnson does not give opinions.  He provides facts and, contrary to many of the reviews herein, provides endnotes in support of those facts. The book runs over 900 pages, so if you are lazy and slow, avoid this one.  Otherwise, just be patient. You wil be rewarded.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This is a great urban type of fairytale story . The music really sets this tale apart from others like it. Really worth watching
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This was another incredible Deal of the Day!  I was able to purchase the entire series in a collector's edition boxed set for less than $100!  It was also nice to receive my purchase in less than a week.  Outstanding!!!!  ;)
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Conceived during the latest Writer's strike, Joss and company wrote (and in some cases, starred in) this instant classic (TAKE THAT, DISNEY!).  It is #2 on my all-time favorites list...#1 being The Princess Bride (inconceivable, I know).  I was privileged to be in Hollywood on Halloween to see the first charity screening.  Joss, Nathan and Felicia commented on just recording some of the dialog for the commentary.  I have no doubt the commentary is every bit as good as the musical itself.  If not, may the Bad Horse make me his mare!    Ed. note:  watched (listened to) the commentary.  While it's not as good as the actual movie, it was enjoyable for what it was...a shameless plug to get us all to buy the DVD...er, a masterful commentary on Felicia Day's \\"process\\".
B001H5X7I4|1.0|I didn't see this in a theater and I am glad I didn't waste the money.  Lots of potty humor and way way too much foul language just for the sake of foul language.  It could have been made with much less bad language and been funnier.  I gave the movie away to a friend (hope we are still friends after he watches it).  Please say there won't be a sequel.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|The more I listen to it, the more I like it. It's such a fresh sound from a man who's help define what \\"sound\\" is,  so I don't know what more we could want. \\"Highway\\" rocks harder than any of his recent rockers, \\"Sun is Shining\\" just melts beautifully. Melodies just burrow themselves inside your brain and you can't help but hum them throughout the day, even if your initial opinion is unfavorable. I wrote it off thinking, \\"If it doesn't say Paul McCartney on the cover, it must be his lesser stuff.\\" So wrong. Electric Arguments is one of his best.

B001F7MSG6|4.0|Out of all the comic book based movies that have been released over the last several years, I can only think of one that I just knew would have difficulty striking a chord with audiences; and yet, I found myself to be completely surprised when the end result turned out to be a great success. The film I am referring to was the 2004 surprise hit, \\"Hellboy\\" starring Ron Perlman as a bright red, demonic monster hunter. Before the original film arrived in theaters, the promotional images looked impressive, especially the make-up effects work being done to create Hellboy's devilish visage; which was something I never thought would look even remotely realistic. Yet, somehow what I once thought impossible, without going cheesy, B-movie-esque with the whole production, was brought to an entertaining reality. With the release of \\"Hellboy\\" and its anxiously awaited sequel \\"Hellboy 2: The Golden Army\\", both films directed by critically acclaimed director Guillermo Del Toro (\\"Blade 2\\"), a once obscure comic book hero has broken into the mainstream, and a new franchise is taking Hollywood by storm.    \\"Hellboy 2: The Golden Army\\" finds our crimson hero (Ron Perlman) grappling with personal issues centering around his fiery relationship with Liz (Selma Blair) and his desire to become widely known and accepted by the public that still believes him to be a myth. Meanwhile, an ancient truce is unraveling, and dark forces, led by the power hungry Prince Nuada (Luke Goss), are gathering to wage a devastating war upon humanity the likes of which have never been seen.    Earlier in 2008, when the first trailers started appearing to signal the upcoming arrival of \\"Hellboy 2: The Golden Army\\", I was excited about seeing the movie for two reasons. One, the original film was so much fun and a truly great comic book adaptation; and two, from what I could tell of the story from the previews, the second film looked as if it was going to be another exciting adventure starring our favorite demonic devil buster, and early buzz had it sounding as if it could even be a bit better than its predecessor. From my perspective, I don't know if I can say that this is one of those rare instances where the sequel surpasses the original film, but I do believe that it is easily an equal to \\"Hellboy\\" in every way.    The story for the original film was two-fold, first and foremost, it seemed to be a very faithful film adaptation of a semi-popular Dark Horse comic book that had yet to break into the mainstream with the heroes of DC Comics or Marvel; secondly, it was a terrific jumping on point for typical movie audiences (obviously), and for those comic book fans that had not been introduced to the character yet, and perhaps had only heard about him in passing or whatever the case may be. With the first film, writer Guillermo Del Toro obviously had to get the obligatory origin tale out of the way for audiences to be able to relate to and understand this rather atypical superhero. With \\"Hellboy 2: The Golden Army\\", Del Toro (once again returning as writer and director) was able to essentially dispense with the pleasantries, so to speak, and just dive into the two main driving forces of the story.    The primary plot of the film, in my opinion, centers on Hellboy and Liz's chaotic romance, and his need for acceptance from anyone and everyone around him. Generally, I get kind of annoyed when comic book films make a romance the focal point of the story (for example, the Spider-Man series; great films, too much romance though), yet in this instance the romantic angle was handled with an appropriate dosage of humor and seriousness, that it never feels too heavy-handed or bogs the story down in any way. The secondary plot revolved around Prince Nuada's bid for power in his realm, and his quest for vengeance upon the human world. It was this latter storyline that propelled the action/adventure aspect of the story, while the former provided the dramatic element needed to keep the film interesting.    What was nice about having these two major plots running concurrently throughout the movie was the fact that Del Toro was wise enough to intertwine them at various points throughout the duration of the film. Sometimes when two major plot lines drive a story, they tend to not intersect with each other all that much, and at times this can result in one of the stories not feeling quite as resolved as the other (most likely as an attempt to cash in on a sequel). For \\"Hellboy 2: The Golden Army\\" the two plots both come to satisfying conclusions providing the audience with a sense of resolution should another sequel not occur; while still leaving enough of an opening for a follow-up should the opportunity arise.    If I were to judge \\"Hellboy 2: The Golden Army\\" purely from a visual effects standpoint, then it is by far a superior film to the original. Of course this is the result of a heftier budget, thanks in no small part to the success of \\"Hellboy\\". Even with a sizeable budget increase, Del Toro continues his somewhat rebellious ways within Hollywood, by taking the road less traveled these days. Meaning that he does not solely rely upon CGI to create his fantastical world of creatures. Sure there was a generous amount of CGI dispersed throughout the film, and without a doubt it all looked excellent; however, assisting the CGI, Guillermo Del Toro opted to use a large array of practical effects for many of the creatures he wished to bring to life. Make no mistake when you see this movie the CGI is virtually impeccable, but the costumes and creature designs created for the practical (on-set) side of things is simply astounding. After watching this film, it's easy to understand why Hollywood has branded Guillermo as being a visionary director from his work on both \\"Pan's Labyrinth\\" and now \\"Hellboy 2: The Golden Army\\".    The actors and actresses in this film are all top-notch, and considering that roughly 85% of them are wearing some form of prosthetics or heavy make-up or something of the sort, it's surprising how strong the performances turned out. Ron Perlman (\\"Hellboy\\") as the titular character, once again nails the role perfectly. I firmly believe that there is no other actor in Hollywood that could have captured this role any better than Ron has; from his sardonic wit, gruff voice, and the fact that he looked as if he simply walked off the comic book page, there is no doubt in my mind that Ron Perlman was born to be Hellboy. Selma Blair reprises her role as Liz Sherman. No longer a victim of her powers, Liz is in complete control, and has accepted her role in protecting humanity from those who wish to do it harm. Even though she has conquered one problem, she still has to deal with her often immature boyfriend, Hellboy, which causes more than just a few fiery arguments to say the least. It is their frequently heated relationship that makes for some of the most fun and entertaining moments of dialogue within the film.    The extremely talented, yet rarely heard from, Doug Jones once again personifies Abe Sapien; but this time Doug actually gets to provide the voice for the character as well. In the previous film, Doug's vocal performance was replaced by actor David Hyde Pierce (TV's \\"Frasier\\"), much like his performance in \\"Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer\\" when Laurence Fishburne was brought in to provide the voice for the Surfer, while Doug provided the physical performance for the character. Luckily, Doug's voice is similar to David's so if a person isn't paying close enough attention, or if it's been a while since they last watched the first film, they'd never even know it was another actor's voice providing the line readings. This does beg one question though. If Doug and David's voices were so similar, then why have David provide the voice in the first place, or for that matter why switch to Doug for the sequel? Perhaps, David Hyde Pierce wasn't available at the time to work on this film. Whoknows? Lastly, Luke Goss (\\"Blade 2\\") as the villainous Prince Nuada, gave a performance that was equal parts dangerous and creepy weird, oftentimes he was both at the same time. The only thing that I felt was odd about Luke's performance was that he sometimes seemed to have a slight accent in his delivery, yet other times nothing out of the ordinary. Other than those sporadic bits of an accent, I thought Luke was a good choice for the lead villain, and that he gave a fairly strong, if not slightly inconsistent performance.    \\"Hellboy 2: The Golden Army\\" is an absolutely entertaining, action-packed adventure that perfectly expands upon everything that was great about the original film without ever seeming repetitive or unoriginal. While not necessarily surpassing the original film, this movie doesn't fall short of it either, which is an achievement for any sequel to attain.    \\"Hellboy 2: The Golden Army\\" is rated PG-13 for violence and language.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This is a very provacative work.  I have been listening to it nonstop for weeks.  I love it. MCR is a great band and I will be waiting for their next endeavor eagerly!
B000LC4CVA|5.0|This was my first exposure to these ladies - I was totally blown away by their clarity. I can't fault any of them at all. Mairead, the fiddler, has such a distinctive and beautiful style of playing I find myself (not literally) throwing rocks at other fiddlers. I don't believe she ever hits a bad note. The orchestra is also first-rate.    Excellent video - crank it up!
B0013ND30M|4.0|I received my movie in a timely manner and it's great!!!  My lil lady gonna love this for xmas..  Thank you :)
B0002IQJUK|4.0|Gavin DeGraw is a talented guy.  I am enjoying his CD and recommend it if you are into a more mellow relaxed sound.  2 thumbs up.
B000WCDI5K|5.0|For myself, I wouldn't care if The Killers came out with an album of B-sides like Sawdust every 6 months if all of the songs are as great as these are. The songs on here are a mixture of the sound of Hot Fuss and the sound of Sam's Town and then a dash of neither for good measure.  With the exception of \\"Move Away\\" I can, and have, listened to most of the single tracks with the repeat button on because they are that great!      As long as you are not a person who gets twisted up in knots when someone breaks what is perceived as protocol for artists in the music industry, then this would be an album you could enjoy as much as Hot Fuss or Sam's Town.
1400063515|1.0|I'll save you the trouble and the money. Here's the message (if that's what you'd call it): Crazy things happen...be prepared...if you can. There, aren't you happy you didn't waste any piece of your life reading this book, like I did?
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Okay, so I have every album Nickelback has ever done and I've loved them from the beginning. First I want to know why everyone is so brutal about artists changing direction with their content and sound. I thought it was about expression, no? Having said that, I really don't see that this is all that different from the last record, in sound anyway. It is different from the earlier stuff like Curb, but it's still fantastic. I love everything about it. It's a little naughty, which I love and it's very fun. I also like the slower songs. The skeptics need to listen to the words I guess, they will blow you away. It's really amazing. So I give it five stars for sure. Here we go with the breakdown:    1. Something In Your Mouth 5/5 love this song, love the way Chad Kroeger says 'naughty'  2. Burn It To The Ground 5/5 gotta love that metal!!!  3. Gotta Be Somebody 4.5/5 awesome song, period.  4. I'd Come For You 4.5/5 love the words in the song, amazing.  5. Next Go Round 5/5 great metal sound and makes me laugh - so fun!  6. Just To Get High 3.5/5 has a great message, but not a personal favorite.  7. Never Gonna Be Alone 5/5 LOVE this song, love his voice!!!!  8. Shakin' Hands 5/5 naughty, fun, and just a great all around song.  9. S.E.X. 4.5/5 great and fun  10. Today Was Your Last Day 4.5/5 great song great words.  11. This Afternoon 5/5 I really like this one, even though it's a bit different for them. You can almost sense their nostalgia - it's about beginnings or their roots. Great song.    Over all a great record. They just do it for me, I'm a fan for life!
B001ECQ6YW|5.0|I ordered this DVD for my grandson who lives in Virginia (I live in Mexico).  It arrived on a very timely basis, and he watches very often (he is four).    Thanks, Amazon    Kay Martin
B00168OINK|5.0|Fantastic audio/video support an excellent movie on Blu-ray. Plenty to enjoy for both young and old alike. Although the Blu-ray does not contain 'Secrets of the Furious Five'; if you have seen this short story you are not missing anything engrossing.
0810994739|5.0|From laughing so hard!  I am an adult and woman and love this book.  A boy or girl from middle school on up can relate to this book about American life.  The jokes are often laugh out loud funny  and you end up bothering people trying to show someone the latest cartoon or tell the most recent joke.  Just fantastic and it's true, reluctant male readers aren't so reluctant anymore!
B001ED7C58|5.0|This album is strictly alternative rock.  Something I haven't seen since the early to mid 1990's.  I don't usually buy the soundtracks to movies.  There is usually just too much instrumentals, but not on this one.  The sound goes from the fast and furious to the mellow.  One song even reminds me of Mazzy Star for you true Gen. Xers.  Collective Soul is on this album, but none of the fuzzy Gel stuff here.  On this track they rock and only vaugely even sound like Collective Soul.  I was also introduced to some wonderful artists that I will have to listen to more of there songs namely Muse and Paramore.    Of course all of you 14 and 15 year old     s will want this album so you can relive the movie parts in your mind.  Guys have it in the car to impress your      with how cool you are.
B001EOQWEO|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I love the Wall-E movie. In fact, it is one of the best movies I have ever seen. However, it is with this 'Wall-E (Three-Disc Special Edition + Digital Copy)' that I have issues. Now please note that although I am in Australia, I have bought dozens of DVDs from Amazon, 100% of which I have been able to view without problems on my computer, using either Power DVD or Windows Media Player. This Wall-E 3 Disc Edition, however, will not run at all on my computer, not on Power DVD or Windows Media Player. All it does is cycle through all the chapters in a few seconds, and then returns to the menu. To add injury to insult, Disc 3, the digital copy of the movie, when I type in the redemption code, mocks me by saying that I don't live in the USA, so my registration is invalid. I am not aware of any such warning mentioned in the sales blurb. Conclusion: good movie, completely flawed product. The only part that worked was the Disc 2, the extras. Hmm, helpful...
B0018S6YO4|4.0|When I first received this item it was scratched and the case was damaged, but the minute I reported this mishap to Amazon the error was resolved and I received a new one right away and sent a return label to send back the damaged one and everything was fine moving forward. I thank amazon for the good customer service.
B001GKJ2FC|1.0|This will be my first review.  I wanted my first review to be a positive one.  Ah, well, the best laid plans . . . I did feel I had to put how I felt after reading the rave reviews.  I haven't read the comic, so I can't tell you what I think in that direction.    The story is creative, and yes the plot is thin.  Outside the box the theories of this fantasy world are intriguing.  I'm thankful there wasn't as much gore as fans may want, and in my life I don't care for it as I did in my younger days.    The only character that had depth was the young adult played by McAvoy.  You know what?  I truly believe any film needs characters that you would relate to or get to know and love/like/hate.  Even action films.  I know some of you disagree there, but I think some of the best action films out there have characters that mean something, or learn something or that you can feel for.    An assassination group with scruples?  How does killing people fit into any type of \\"norm\\" for anyone?  Okay, maybe to some people who imagine out there that it would be cool to be a killer.  Society tells people they can't discipline their kids, then when that kid becomes bad it's the parents fault. Hmmmmm, why do we get into these type of movies, and how do we teach our youth that this is not what you want to do, or be or desire to play out?  How can we let them know that we want them to have long, productive lives and have loved ones support them in their endeavors?    I wouldn't let my children (18 or below) watch this type of film (the higher age bracket, 16-18, I would make sure they know the difference between real and imaginary - but that's for you all out there.  I would never knowingly attend this type of movie with the entire age group - I think it's inappropriate.)    I myself will never watch the film again.  I have watched few movies that I can say that of, and I won't list them here.  It did teach me to monitor my own film viewings.  I'll have to screen better to make sure it'ssomething I would want to see myself.
B0015519VS|5.0|This cd was also good, I had no problems with this one either. It is not that bad when you buy more than one product online, have it delivered and only one minor problem occurs and is resolved rather quickly and with no hassle at all. It felt good and safe and I must say for some one as sceptical as I am, I am glad for such a good experience. I did make two more purchases after these, hopefully I receive the same customer service and there is no internal or external damage to my merchandise.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is amazing. The story, the characters, the fact that space has no sound effects! I absolutely love this series. I only heard about it after it was cancelled (Go Fox, for cancelling another terrific show), saw the movie and instantly fell in love. Trust the multiple-thousand other people who love this show and get it!
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Not the best Indiana Jones movie, but you still enjoy Indiana Jones as portrayed by Harrison Ford.
031606792X|5.0|I just finished 'Breaking Dawn' yesterday evening. I barely put it down for the 2 days I'd had it. I'm going to break this down, and try not to spoil too much for people considering reading it.     SPOILER      Here is how it goes. If you've read the first 3 books then you know that at the end of 'Eclipse' that it was from Jacob's perspective.  Well, 'Breaking Dawn' starts back in Bella's perspective then back to Jacob then back to Bella.  That's not a bad thing, it allows you to see things in a different light, things you may have missed, or may have not even seen if it weren't for the back and forth.  Mrs. Meyer kept with a lot of myths and legends from different cultures.  It is possible for vampires to father children with human females. You just don't see it often or at all in most of the other vampire films.  It's hard for me to describe this book, because I don't want to give anything away.  SO to sum it up. 'Breaking Dawn' is very intense, very well written and doesn't lack in any way. It's progressed from the first three books, and it's done so without forgetting anything. Enjoy! :)
0805079831|5.0|This well-researched book is clearly written and should be read by anyone wanting to understand world politics and economics.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|This was a great series (Firefly) followed by a great movie. I hope Mr. Whedon makes another.
B001ED7C58|3.0|It's weird. Brand-new CD and it skips in the car, but it's fine in the CD-Rom at home. The music, itself, was ok, but I didn't think it was appropriate to the book I read. After seeing the movie, yeah, some of the songs fit, but not many. I still think my sister's playlist is more \\"Twilight-appropriate.\\"
B00127RAJY|5.0|I've been doing Level 1 about four times a week for two weeks and plan to go to Level 2 tomorrow. This is a good, hard 20 minutes that definitely gets easier with practice. I feel stronger and more fit already and my clothes are fitting a lot looser. I definitely recommend this product, but it's not for wusses. Be prepared to sweat!
B000OYC3J8|4.0|Very  good product, although the previous LP's I think were bettter. Thank you anyways.
B001FSDOZO|5.0|Having been a nickelback fan since they first started getting airplay in australia i have anticipated each album (perhaps this more than others - its not released here in oz yet) - i have to say they i enjoyed all 11 tracks which is rare on any album.  The boys have exceeded themselves again - proof why they are one of the greatest rock groups of their time.  I simply can't wait til they tour again so i can hear these tunes live!!!
B0015D3Z4O|5.0|Another great cd from Madonna,she has done it again.Great dance album the collabration with Justin Timberlake,Timbaland,and Kanye West fit beautifully!Ohh,if you ever get the chance to see her in concert,you will have a great time!!The Sticky and Sweet Tour was one of the best shows i have ever been to,and can't wait til she goes on tour again.I will definitely be there!!!Madonna the Houston show on Nov.16th was awesome!!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD. I started to see results after only one week. The moves are so easy to follow... no silly dance type moves like in some other workout DVDs I have. (I'm not the most coordinated person haha) Plus, knowing I only need to devote 20 or so minutes of my time a day is really motivating. I never can find an excuse not to do it and can always fit it into my schedule. I like that you can turn off Jillian's audio and only have the music too. You'll definitely feel sore from this workout but that's because it works! And all you need are light hand weights and a mat.<br /><br />One con: The introduction. There is no way to skip it. Not too bright of the creators of this DVD, who developed it knowing people would be watching it everyday. I do not need to have the workouts explained every time I press play, thanks. I did it yesterday, and the day before that. I know what to expect by now! I have to leave the DVD player on all the time if I want to avoid it.
B001F7XIJW|5.0|Well, there isn't much more I can add to most of the on point comments below other than... If you are a fan of heavy, creative music. Are sick of the played out typical 'breakdowns' common in the current metal genres and can appreciate a little experimentation in your music, THIS is a cd you should own.  The production is top notch, the musicianship is excellent, and the lyrics actually have a point.    Whats great around this release, just like their last, is that its ALOT to digest in one sitting.  In todays world of terrible music, both metal AND pop, its nice to feel like you are getting your money's worth.  MUSIC INDUSTRY TAKE NOTES. Gojira's cd may not be the MUSIC that you need to promote, but it is an example of how to take a played out genre and spin it to give it a breath of fresh air.
6305428042|5.0|Great movie, I am not a real Bette Midler fan but I thought she did a great job in Hocus Pocus.  Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy were right with her in all respects. I give it an A+ in acting all around. It was both spooky and funny at the same time.  It will be an annual event at halloween to watch this movie.
B001GKJ2F2|5.0|I went into this movie expecting allot of great gunfights and action scenes... That's exactly what I got... If you went any deeper it wouldn't satisfy but it did what I expected...
B000002UZ1|5.0|Simply the greatest rock and roll LP of all time! If I could only take one with me when I go, it would be this one!
B00003CXIP|5.0|Talk about recipe for success.  A story based on a Stephen King novella.  Directed by Rob Reiner, who turned out to be about as fine a filmmaker there is.  Narrated by Richard Dreyfuss (which is, in my humble opine, the best way to tolerate him in a movie).  And solid up and coming young talents like Wil Wheaton, River Phoenix (RIP), Kiefer Sutherland, and Corey Feldman.  All key ingredients to make watching STAND BY ME an unforgettable viewing experience.<br /><br />A coming of age story set in 1950s rural Oregon, this film is the superbly crafted tale of four adolescents in search of a body allegedly decomposing in the woods.  Yet this quest is not what the movie is about--not even close; the movie is about the four boys, their camaraderie, their insecurities and inner fears.  Accordingly the story weaves, and weaves effortlessly, from lighthearted to poignant to disturbing--and back again.  And it's totally believable:  The viewer is on the railroad tracks in the boonies, walking with the four teens, laughing and humming to the golden oldie, 'Lollipop'.<br /><br />STAND BY ME is fun, moving, sad. . .timeless.  I've seen this film countless times, and will no doubt watch it countless times more.  And isn't that how we honor great movies?<br />--D. Mikels, Author, [[ASIN:142573152X The Reckoning]]
B000002KIE|5.0|As seminal an album as has ever been released, this record has lost nothing over the years.  Lest punk rock be thought of as sloppy or ill-conceived, this album, from the genre's best-remembered, most influential band, remains as well-crafted as any record ever made.  Nothing more need be said.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|That special time of the year is fast approaching which means it is time for a viewing of the classic Christmas comedy Christmas Vacation.  This movie has several laugh out loud funny moments.  It features a great ensemble cast, with a spotlight performance from Chevy Chase.  Chevy has been in a lot of movies, some hits and some misses, but this is one my favorites of the bunch (right up there with Caddyshack).  The movie has a nice little lesson about the importance of family, even when that family is a little on the crazy side.  This is a 5-star comedy classic.  If you haven't watched this movie yet, don't expect an Academy Award winner, just enjoy the fun.
B001DPC52C|5.0|For those who truly love metal and rock music, this is the CD/DVD for you. Within Temptation, in conjunction with the Metropole Orchestra, the Pa'Dam Choir, and some special guests, performed their Black Symphony last February and - well, what can I say? It was a powerful and yet almost unbelievable musical event!     The Black Symphony begins with a gothic, but classical sounding overture performed by the orchestra and choir that lasts for several minutes. Within Temptation then takes to the stage, and from that point on, holds the viewer/listener spellbound as it performs its own brand of electrifying music.     Vocalist Sharon Den Adel is stunning as she sings, not only many of the band's more well-known material, but also performs duets with a few of the event's special guests.    The concert, now on DVD, has something for everybody. It's a mix of classically-structured, goth/metal along with some mellower, but moving material in the middle of the concert.     Anyone who believes that rock music has seen better days ought to watch this concert; and, for anyone who truly loves this genre of music, the concert is for you. This had to be one of the greatest events in rock history.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|From watching the 'special edition' interviews, what stands out in my mind is how right Steven Spielberg was when he initially expressed reservations about making anymore sequels to IJ, how he took special care to give a satisfying ending to 'Last Crusade'that would neatly wrap things up, how he had doubts about using the alien skull idea that Lucas was pushing.......You shoulda gone with your gut Steven!!  You could feel the script writer going thru the previous IJ movies in order to establish a formula so that this one would follow the same patterns- the only problem is, that in this one you know exactly what he is doing and what scenes are comparable to the earlier ones.  Shia L does not have the same natural charisma as people like Harrison or Sean Connery, much less Johnny Depp, etc. -that makes you want to watch what they are doing.  The wedding scene is trite as is just about everything else in the movie.  Ack- go watch 'Last Crusade' and try to forget about this one........
B001C46P2A|1.0|It has been quite some time since I have spent three abjectly painful hours in a movie theater.  Australia is, quite simply, the worst movie I have seen since The Pledge, back in 2002.      The plot is a loosely assembled chassis of borrowed cliches from film history.  \\"Out of Africa\\", \\"The Man from Snowy River\\", \\"Gone with the wind\\", \\"Empire of the Sun\\", are all copied and adapted to fit the history of Australia.  Even the majestic landscape of the epynomous title are not able to escape abuse.  CGI Kangaroos, Cattle, Airplanes, Ships, Islands, and Cities abound.  Add to that an over the top performance by Nicole Kidman; and you have the worst movie of 2008.      Paying $14.00 to see this should be considered an act of larceny.  Unless you have to \\"jump on a grenade\\" and see this as a \\"family compromise movie\\" (as I did) avoid it at all costs.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I love musicals. But I am very picky about which ones I watch, and which ones I buy for repeat performances. MAMA MIA was the first musical that multiple generations can appreciate. For the first time, I wasn't the young pup represented in most musicals, but the mother experiencing love lost, found again, and letting go of your children. I found myself amazed with Meryl Streep's voice, cheering on Pierce Brosnan's (and yes, sometimes he hit a sour note, but when your boyfriend is singing to you something really sweet...who cares?)and laughing at how the screenplay writers incorporated particular tunes (Chickadita! Loved it!). I love Christine Baranski and have became a new fan of Julie ___ (can't remember her last name). I would love to have a set of friends like Julie, Meryl, and Christine.     I grew up in the ABBA-hit era, but did not \\"love\\" them. They were another group that had some great songs. But I did really \\"love\\" the way that these songs were not stripped of their melody, and still the words represented something current.     There were silly gestures, and some cheesy dances...but I liked it. It made me smile. Like watching your folks dance....    Long and the short...Mama Mia is worth buying. Buy the soundtrack, buy the DVD. Make yourself feel good, without a therapist.

B00009ZYC1|4.0|Ever since I saw the movie Shrek when it first came out in theaters, I saw it as a story intentionally subversive to empire (not just the \\"Disney Empire\\").  However I have not found anyone else explicate these themes.  So I thought now is as good a time as any to do that.  And so here are my thoughts on the movie Shrek as 'imperial' critique.<br /><br />Shrek is an Ogre.  A monster.  Something to be feared.  Those who are hunting for him with torches and pitchforks have their fantasy-projections of what ogres are like.  But is he really as bad as his pursuers think?  Perhaps monsters are mere projections of our prejudices and fears onto those who represent the unknown.  In this way, 'the other' is part of our mythologizing, whose identity is constructed by the dominant story-tellers of society.  Toward the beginning of the movie various 'others', the defected fairy-tale characters, are bought, sold, and rejected.  The motif of colonialism arises as the fairy-tale creatures are relocated to the mirky swamp by the orders of Farquad, and thus disrupting the ogre's peace.  (Recall the ginger bread man calls Farquad a \\"monster\\").<br /><br />  King Farquad represents the ruling elite.  He is a white male with a Napolean complex - that is, he is short and often tries to appear taller than he actually is.  This is an indication of shame and part of his fabricating identity by bullying others;  rising to power is not merely compensation but is a contrived way of affirming his significance.  This is part of a very important theme:  Farquad is a pretend king.  He is playing make-believe, and whether he knows he is or not is a worthy conversation.  He seems to deceive himself by his making-believe and forcing the others to participate.  Notice his control of the authentic.  During a festivity his servants are made to display cards reminding the crowd to \\"Applause\\" or \\"Boo\\".  The magic mirror tells him what he wants to hear, but under threat.  He maintains his image with violence.  His power and glory are a fabrication that is established by a play of fear and of prejudice.  Most noteworthy and more central is his ongoing struggle to establish the \\"perfect kingdom\\" - and so he attempts to capture the \\"happily ever after\\" for himself.  Yet this \\"perfect\\" kingdom - with no ambiguity and perfect conformity to his liking - is really a utilization of social construction with which he manipulates his reality.  In this way the movie is suggestive of how people see themselves as within a story.<br /><br />  There is a general understanding among anthropologists that we interpret our world through story, allowing our expectations to be shaped by them.  We assume the stories are prescriptive and so we live by them, when really they may confine our interpretation of lived experience.  Hence, the princess was waiting to be rescued by the prince.  The dragon was 'supposed' to be killed.  This is how one is \\"supposed\\" to find \\"true love\\" - a fixation the princess sees within a narratival framework.  The story isn't 'perfect.'  She learns that along the way.<br /><br />  Within the theme of the imperial pursuit of the 'perfect' and its corollary dehumanizing of the other, a feminist critique can be found.  Notice the chivalry of Robin Hood.  Hood believes he is saving a damsel in distress.  This reflects the chivalrous will to establish identity in relation to the damsel by conquoring evil - the \\"threat.\\"  Every classic horror film where a beautiful woman is victimized by a gothic creature serves to a particular perspective of good and evil through a particular construction of women.  According to the script, it is a scandal for a woman to be with an ogre.  This points to the complication of gender construction in an imperial context.  It is widely recognized by sociologists that the constructions of gender-relations are integrated with other social constructions such as 'race' and 'class'.  In general, the 'other' plays a role in the construction of power and privilege through its contradistinction from a construction of authentic humanity ('white', 'male', 'middle-upper' class).  Hence chivalry is part of a narrative construct of how masculinity is established in its distinction to the 'other.'  But this depiction of chivalry seeks to affirm adequacy or power in battle against an other - defining its power in terms of defeat and conquest, and restoration of a well-defined order.<br /><br />  Moreover, in its presumption of the weak and passive role of the woman, there is suggestive here a weakness in patriarchy itself.  Both Robin Hood and Farquad need to fit themselves in a defining narrative whereby it is easy to manipulate their identity.  Robin Hood is insecure because he needs to define himself in just this way.  The Robin Hood scene nicely upsets the imperial/patriarchical assumption of chivalry.  The princess doesn't need Robin Hood's help.  In fact she sees herself as a victim of his presumed heroism.  Robin Hood's sing-and-dance routine reveals his motives are really not pure at all.  He is using the role of chivalry and its play on otherness (the ogre) to placate his desires (which may include remaining a hero of sexual conquest and earning or keeping the respect of his band of merry men).  Princess Fiona proves to be stronger than Robin Hood, revealing his weakness and deconstructing his facade.<br /><br />  At the end of the movie, the princess kisses Shrek, the spell is broken, and she remains an ogre - only permanently.  It's actually as if her day-time identity as a fairy-tale depiction of a fair-maden is the fake - the curse.  It's not so much that Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but rather escapes social construction.  King Farquad is exposed as a fraud, and his kingdom built on inauthentic and is itself truly anti-human.  The Shrek story effectively deconstructs the fairy-tale narrative - but does so in the formation of another narrative.  What I come away with is a sense that to live by a pre-scriptive narrative, and to mediate one's identity through it, is to be fake, inauthentic, and to transcend;  only in transcending the expected can we find what is true, good, and beautiful.<br /><br />  Now, by explicating these themes, I don't mean to imply that there are no race or gender typology being used here.  For instance, all people in this movie are white.  Some may see the donkey character as resembling the stereotypical non-white side kick.  The hero is still a male.  At very least, I would like to suggest that these stereotypes serves the movies critique.<br /><br />  In summary, Shrek is a commentary on empire.  The power of empire is its story.  It is in story that people interpret their role, through which they mediate identity and are predisposed in an interpersonal and political trajectory.  Story gives meaning.  The empire controls the story-telling of a society, and manipulates it in order to type-cast itself into the heroic and the salvific.tradistinction from a construction of authentic humanity ('white', 'male', 'middle-upper' class).

I was concerned about some reviewer's complaints that the video and audio are out of synch for the first couple of songs, but this doesn't bother me at all.  I'm too busy soaking up the pleasure of watching an incredible group of musicians at work.  Highly recommended!
0743290119|4.0|I wouldn't try to expect some profound literature with this book, so those who are so highly critical and negative should chill out with the hate because it's supposed to be a fun easy read with a simplistic plot. If you want the deep stuff, you're in the wrong genre. I think Weisberger wrote a fun novel and dived into thoughtful details that were very honest. Friends aren't always perfect and harmonious, nor do they all think/act/feel alike, so I appreciated the character differences that were spelled out throughout the book. If the girls acted and talked in the same way, it would be terribly ordinary and colorless. I don't indulge in chicklit much, but I liked this. Don't over analyze.
0316017922|5.0|For me, Gladwell's books are very engaging. It's like he is solving an almost unsolvable puzzle in front of your eyes and is actually going to share the secret with you this time! It's very rewarding to read. Though Outliers is no Tipping Point (my favorite) it still works in just the same way.<br /><br />Gladwell talks about people who just because of a different set of circumstances end up doing far better than their equal counterpart, a bit of the nature vs. nurture debate comes into play in my mind. Yes, some of his findings end up being pretty logical but they are not connections I would have made on my own without tons of thought. He uses a variety of examples to make his case.<br /><br />I really liked the hockey tryout cut-off date example he uses. Because of the hockey tryout cut-off date of January 1st in Canada, people born in the few months following that always end up getting picked because they are the largest and most mature of all the people trying out. And then because they get picked and get the training that makes them the champions they become.<br /><br />A frightening section is one where Gladwell talks about plane crashes. We get to read snippets of black box recordings and it's crazy how restrained some people in the cockpit were moments before a crash. Because, according to Gladwell, their culture has told them to behave in a certain way and to respect authority or higher-ups even if the higher up is in the wrong. I could go on and on listing all the examples because they all added something to his argument.<br /><br />I thought it was smart how Gladwell uses his own family as an example because throughout the book he's basically making a case for how someone can't be a genius all on their own (which sometimes people claim) and there are many factors that play into their success. Using his family as an example helps show he really isn't trying to put anyone down with his arguments.<br /><br />Outliers is an engrossing book full of logical but eye-opening arguments held up by great examples.eat examples.
B0018BB21G|2.0|I'm a Moody fan for many years.  Maybe that's the problem.  There are just so many classic Moody songs and versions that have risen to the top and stay in the public consciousness.  The \\"lost Chord\\" is a period piece and seems to be a very minor chord.  Stay with the 'best' of the Moody songs and save your $s.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|For the original series of James Bond films, Sean Connery defined the part quite effectively. Since Connery other actors such as George Lazenby, Timothy Dalton, Roger Moore and Pierce Brosnan have attempted to portray this persona with the same elan with varying degrees of success. In my opinion none have measured up to Connery in the qualities of an international British agent with unsurpassed physical skills, sophistication and attraction for women. None until now. Daniel Craig makes one heck of a Bond! He fits this role equally well. Thus this movie is quite successful. The locations-Italy, Montenegro, the Bahamas- are fantastic with wonderful photography. Some exotic, mind-dizzying technology is used but not too much. There are some exciting action scenes such as in Miami and particularly around the casino at Montenegro. Eva Green plays Vesper and provides some excellent verbal jousting with Craig such as on a train in Europe. Vesper also becomes the name of a drink (6 parts Gordon's Gin, 2 of vodka, one of Kina Lilet all shaken until cool). Overall this is a wonderful movie.[[ASIN:1931391912 The Griffon Trilogy]]
B001FSDOZO|1.0|Nickelback Oh Nickelback..I love these guys and for that reason I have to be honest, brutally honest. This latest CD is such a disappointment that I actually felt depressed after listening to it. I bought the CD without even listening to the track samples (which I should have) because I was so confident that I would love it.  To me, Nickelback could do no wrong. But after one listen, I just wasn't \\"turned on\\" like I felt with the other Nickelback CDs and found the songs forgettable. This ain't the Nickelback I used to know and love. Sorry guys, Dark Horse stinks.
6305657947|5.0|I loved this movie. Even though the 1968 movie with Steve McQueen as Thomas Crown and Faye Dunaway as Vicki Anderson (the Catherine Banning characater in this version)was great, I enjoyed this one more. Faye Dunaway appears as the psychiatrist in this version. Pierce Brosnan plays the Thomas Crown character with the right amount of style and mischievousness and with his cool, calculating reserve makes a good counterpart to Rene Russo's exuberant but equally intelligent insurance investigator (Catherine Banning). The repartee between her and Crown and Detective McCann (Dennis Leary) provides a lot of the energy for the movie. Brosnan and Russo manage to create a strong sexual and romantic tension as well. Scenes of sailing and events in Martinique provide some pleasing visual footage. Crown steals Monet's painting, San Georgio Maggiore At Dusk, worth $100,000,000 and the movie takes off from there.
B000000OUE|5.0|I love this CD.I have been listening to it for 2 years mostly while doing long distance running and biking, and it never fails to keep me going. Even when I'm hurting or tired it's great beats, and energy are unsurpassed. That's my opinion. I don't understand how anyone could give this a low rating. Maybe it's not their genre. It really wasn't something I would have chosen, but I'm sure glad I was introduced to it!
0375842209|5.0|I just finished reading The Book Thief and absolutely loved it.  The only thing I do not understand is why it is billed as a 'young adult' novel.  The content is serious and often quite disturbing.  At no time did I feel like I was reading a 'teen' book.  This is something that should be read by teens and adults alike.      I won't give a summary of the story - you can read that on the description of the book above.  Just know that this is a beautiful book.  I loved the writing style and how it was narrated by 'Death'.  So cleverly written.  This is a book that I want to press into the hands of everyone I know and say \\"Read this!\\"  Bravo, Mr. Zusak, well done.

B001ED7C58|3.0|If you're expecting this soundtrack to have all Carter Burwell's incidental music for \\"Twilight\\" on it, be prepared for disappointment.  You get only one short track at the very end.  Burwell should sue for another release of his own score.  It was was brilliant and it grows on you--sweeping, swirling, or pounding, by turns. All we get, though, is the one lullaby, and thank goodness for that.  I hope they will eventually release the rest of his music from the film; why couldn't it have been interspersed with the regular songs? Burwell's  music for \\"In Bruges\\" was gorgeous, pumped up or moody,--and he delivered nicely here, too.  The baseball theme (track 1) delivers good punch for the hard action of the game scene in midst of thunderstorm. And, although you can barely tell what he's saying, Pattinson's own minimalist guitar song fits the mood nicely--I don't even care what he may be saying.  But if you were looking for more of the original score... dream on.
B00000JQFM|5.0|I'm uncertain where and when I became aware of Joe Satriani and the \\"Surfing With The Alien\\" CD. I must have read a review somewhere, because I'd never heard of him but I really enjoy instrumental rock 'n' roll. Well, I just couldn't be more satisfied with this disc. I've had it now for umpteen years and I just don't burn out on listening to it. \\"Surfing With The Alien\\" ranks in the top tier of my CD collection.<br /><br />Ever since the beginning of rock 'n' roll, I've always enjoyed the instrumentals. In my opinion, there aren't nearly enough of them. Even with most rock music with lyrics and vocals, I'm listening mostly to the music behind the vocals. To me, the instrumental music is the essence of rock and the vocals are the extras, sometimes annoyingly so. Well, I guess that's a little harsh, but I'm just trying to make a point. In any case, if you enjoy the instrumental part of rock, this album would be hard to beat.<br /><br />Satriani presents ten tracks on this CD and I honestly cannot pick a favorite. Every song is first rate. Satriani's music is edgy and urgent, but at the same time is extremely melodic. This guy doesn't just play a guitar, he lovingly massages it and he's backed by an excellent percussion ensemble. I can listen to this CD over and over, then put it away for months or years. When I return, it still sounds fresh and new. If other CDs were this good, the music industry would be in serious trouble as there would be no need to buy anything else.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B001C46P2A|3.0|I'll admit being hard on this film due to initial high hopes.  After hearing about the Australian government's apologies for the Stolen Generation, I started thinking Luhrmann's project may have helped lead to that.  For a film claiming to have been initially inspired by the story of aborigine discrimination and mistreatment, it's surprisingly secondary to the film itself, comprising the minority of the performances and story...no pun intended.  I'd have much rather seen a film about a white man, a black woman, and their offspring than an attempt to water it down and use as a gimmick.  How appalling we should think that \\"unmarketable\\" in this day in age.<br /><br />While I generally have no problem with the lightness, humor, or overt Hollywoodness Luhrmann was going for, it just didn't quite mesh with the overall mood or tone of the film.  I also don't think it helped make Nicole Kidman's character as likeable as it could have.  This tends to make the romantic chemistry even more lacking.  Ordinarily we should feel much more sympathy for a woman who's just lost her husband, and thus be more empathetic and taken-in by the events surrounding her later.  I think instead we get something closer to Scarlet O'Hara, who frankly none of the audience was supposed to really give a damn about.  It's not that bad here, but this early choice has detrimental effects.<br /><br />The heavy use of CGI was further disappointing.  It had that extreme washed-out bright highlights quality to much of it, with that artificial foggy, dusty, blurry background from post-production tampering.  The closest look is that of the films Pearl Harbor and Indiana Jones & the Crystal Skulls...and not the non-CGI cave scenes from the latter, some of which were simply printed optically.  Combined with Luhrmann's need to cram everything within a single frame all the time that he inherited from his work on the stage, not to mention some of the stage-like lighting (strong backlights upon the hair at night, uniform color tints to background, etc) it just often looked rather synthetic.<br /><br />Structurally there is a serious flaw regarding timeline here.  Jackman's character is based on a real person.  The aborigine history is accurate.  The attack on the town of Darwin did happen.  However, the choice to put a two year gap between the cattle driving event and what is (which I will explain next) a fourth act, is baffling.  The child hasn't aged and there's an unnecessarily poor segue using newspaper clippings and newsreels to bring us up to date.  All this just as our bottoms are beginning to ache or the need to use the toilet (as Hitchcock put it) chimes in.<br /><br />Thus the solution would have been to shave off about 20 minutes to a half hour removing the written introduction, shortening the kisses (they all last a few beats too long), no thanking of the bartender at the end, making all slow-motions normal speed (a nauseating number of them), losing many extraneous shots & scenes, and tightening up every take's edit.  By putting the cattle driving section in 1941, you can also drop the aforementioned segue and more naturally lead into a proper third act without having \\"blown the cinematic load\\", to use a crude but efficient phrase, in an overly long first two-thirds.  The triumphant cattle drive would end act two, sufficiently joyful but not so cathartically exhausting that the Japanese attack is akin to Frodo leaving with the fairies after the audience is getting up to leave.  Out of Africa needed to be long.  Australia did not.<br /><br />A final word on plastic surgery:<br />Please, women of Hollywood,<br />Think twice about cosmetic surgery & \\"procedures\\"...at least before you need it.  When things are really going south, no one's going to complain.  But this collagen in the lips thing has gotten out of hand.  Uma Thurman had a little work done recently with unexpectedly outstanding & admittedly rare results, but revealingly, very little of it had to do with her lips.  The results were also one in a thousand.  I'm not going to deride a little conservative augmentation here or tuck there, but some of this alteration of the face is just baffling.  I like full lips as much as the next guy, but overtly swollen, bee-sting lips are not sexy.  To quote the Princess Bride, \\"There's a shortage of perfect (fill-in-the-blank) in this world.  It would be a pity to damage yours.\\"thousand.  I'm not going to deride a little conservative augmentation here or tuck there, but some of this alteration of the face is just baffling.

B0014DZ2VO|4.0|O.k. That might be a small exaggeration.  I'm not describing the rushed beginning, some of the numbing action, or Bond's apparent immortality.  But hey, the original Jimmy Bond died in the first Fleming novel, so you can't exactly have a series unless you suspend that one small item.  I rather like to think of it as a post-facto phenomenon.  Bond happens to be the agent with the longest career without buying the farm, thus we the audience follows this particular character as a result of his having succeeded, not as a contrivance.  That might not work for you, but it is sufficient self-hypnotizing for me to get through these types of movies...no, films.<br /><br />Yes, Bond is finally worth being called by that term.  It is no longer simply an action flick.  After such films as Sirana and a greater appreciation and attention to what goes on in the covert world since the events of the last decade, this franchise is rightfully attempting not only to find more heart & soul, but more relevance and socio-political commentary on the world and recent history.  Clinton's Haiti is here.  Bush & Otto Reich's Latin America is represented.  Corporate-funded coups, water, oil, power, politics, intelligence, private jets, and fine-living all come together in an orgy of neo-realism for the spy genre.<br /><br />Replace Clooney's Bob Baer meets Milton Bearden with an athletic European operative licensed to kill.  Good move.  After all, only one gets a sequel.

B001GKYBXA|4.0|The best tracks on this new album make it worth the cost.  Listening to it front-to-back, I heard echoes of many stages of Macca's career, from Revolver, through Sgt. Pepper psychedelia and White Album experimentalism, into some of his best singles work post-Beatles.<br />If you enjoy Paul McCartney for more than bubble-gum pop, and most people do, you'll enjoy this surprisingly different album.  If you are looking for a syrupy pop record, avoid this one.  Macca just keeps pushing the envelope of his musical instincts, and the resulting successes are breathtaking while even the misses are pretty darn good.<br /><br />*****UPDATE:  After listening to this album four or five times, I'm surprised that it sounds better each time.  I would revise my rating to 4.5 stars.<br />A very enjoyable listen.
B001E7OO2I|4.0|I was introduced to John Legend when I began to hear him on certain choruses such as \\"This Way\\" w/Dilated Peoples & Kanye West, \\"Selfish\\" w/Slum Village & Kanye West and on Kanye's debut CD, \\"The College Dropout\\".   When I heard John's debut single \\"Used To Love You\\", I knew that John would have a decent solo debut and once [[ASIN:B0002X314C Get Lifted]] was released, I was proven to be right.   \\"Get Lifted\\" had a neo soul sound to it and my favorite tracks included \\"Let's Get Lifted\\", \\"Alright\\", \\"Live It Up\\", \\"So High\\" and \\"I Can Change\\" w/Snoop Dogg.   John returned with his 2nd CD [[ASIN:B000HCPWZO Once Again]].  John's sophomore effort contained less uptempo tracks but the CD was just about as good as his solo debut.  My favorite tracks included \\"Heaven\\", \\"Another Again\\", \\"Again\\", \\"Stereo\\" and \\"Each Day Gets Better\\".       Earlier this year I heard the track \\"Green Light\\" w/Andre 3000 and I became a fan of the track after the first time I listened to it.   This was an uptempo jam and Andre 3000 made the song even better with his rap and energy on the track.  I felt that if this was the caliber of track(s) that were going to be on \\"Evolver\\" then John's 3rd CD will be just as nice as \\"Get Lifted\\".   \\"It's Over\\" features Kanye West and his new flavor of choice, the autotune.   The track would have been even better without it, but this song still ends up being a decent track.   \\"Everybody Knows\\" deals with John talking about a failed relationship and how he is going on with other people and how he should be able to deal with the fact that his ex is going on with her life as well.   \\"Cross The Line\\" has John talking about a situation where he has been friends with a particular woman and how he now wants to take their platonic friendship to another level.   He dosn't want to lose her friendship but he can't help but think how things would be if they were more than friends.  \\"No Other Love\\" features Estelle and has a reggae feel to it.   It reminds me of \\"Slow Dance\\" from the \\"Once Again\\" CD.   \\"This Time\\" has John wanting to take back some of the things that he did in a past relationship, after he runs into his ex.   He wishes that he hadn't said some of the things that he did and he also wishes that he hadn't have made some of the decisions that he made as well.  He realizes that he wants to have his ex back in his life and he is willing to do whatever it takes to make that happen.   \\"Satisfaction\\" deals with a situation where John is fed up with the fact that his woman is no longer looking like she is interested in still being in a realtionship with him.   He wants to know why his woman is so disinterested in him.   \\"Good Morning\\" is a nice, sexy slow jam that the ladies definitely will be satisfied with.  This track would be the next single, if it were up to me.    \\"Take Me Away\\" has John talking about a woman who just wants to get away from the everyday life.  She wants to be away from everything and wants to make sure that John is going to accompany her on her getaway.       The only tracks that aren't up to par with the best songs on the CD, in my opinion, are \\"Quickly\\" which seems like a forced collaboration with Brandy and \\"If You're Out There\\", which pales in comparison to \\"Coming Home\\", which is another inspirational John Legend track.    Overall, \\"Evolver\\" is a nice album.   However, if you compare the effort to \\"Get Lifted\\" and \\"Once Again\\", \\"Evolver\\" is bringing in the rear, unfortunately.   Core John Legend fans will enjoy the CD, but others may be disappointed because John may be evolving in a direction where they don't want to see him go in.   If you enjoyed \\"Get Lifted\\" and \\"Once Again\\", I think that there are enough tracks on \\"Evolver\\" for you to purchase this CD.  Just don't expect all of the tracks to be on the level of a \\"Green Light\\".

0765316897|5.0|I've eagerly awaited each of these books after reading Sanderson's first novel, [[ASIN:0765350378 Elantris]] and absolutely loving it. I'll admit, the second book in the Mistborn trilogy was a little slow and uneventful (except of course for the end), but this final book in the trilogy completely made up for book two. Besides being incredibly well written and full of complex and realistic characters, the plot twists are mind-boggling. Though a few of the twists are easy to see coming, there are so many revelations that there was no way I could figure everything out. It was absolutely brilliant. The ending was pulled off spectacularly. I wasn't expecting to be content with it ending because I loved the characters so much that I wanted to continue reading about them, but it ended, and I was left feeling quite happy.     I would absolutely recommend reading this to anyone who read the first two books, even if  you were put off somewhat by the second novel. I promise, this one makes up for that completely. For anyone who hasn't read anything by Brandon Sanderson... I recommend everything he has written. His characters are well developed, and he consistently reaches far beyond the traditional fantasy novel and comes up with something incredible. The barrier between good and evil is never absolute and there are enough secrets that you stay up at night simply coming up with theories that grow progressively more absurd as you try to figure them out. My friends would have needed a crowbar to pry the book from my hands to stop me from reading it... that is if they weren't just as glued to the book.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Wow....wow is all I CANT SAY...this movie blew me away when I saw it in theatres, I was excited to see it even before.  I had to see it twice because it was that awesome, I wanted to see it a million more times, but didnt get around to it, awesome piece of art and film, this movie was Heath Ledgers last GREAT movie, way to go out with a bang Heath...RIP!!!!  Cant wait for it to arrive!!!!
0385512058|1.0|I have to agree with the other reviews that indicate that the author does nothing except name drop throughout the entire book.  Who cares how many superficial \\"relationships\\" that the author thinks he has cultivated?  Not surprised he was so interested in getting to Hollywood.  Absolutely, the worst business networking book I've ever read.  In any case, I've learned to read the reviews posted before I make my purchases.
0312944926|2.0|In this political thriller, a devastatingly beautiful (and genius) NSA agent and her enthrallingly handsome (and genius) fianc&eacute; fight to save the world from eminent destruction via an unbreakable computer code.<br /><br />This is definitely not my favorite Dan Brown book--not by a long shot. Although the narrative is quick, and the story is original, the characters fail to satisfy. They are flat and stereotyped. They are also significantly less intelligent than they are supposed to be. The plot is achingly predictable. I had guessed most of the plot within the first couple chapters. The climax was tedious as I was able to decode the message in a few seconds and then had to wait another 5 or so pages for the supposedly experienced and uber-intelligent characters to figure it out. I guess my worst problem, though, is that I know someone who used to work as a cryptographer for the NSA, and so the characters (and sometimes Brown's background research into the NSA) seemed off to me. Brown just doesn't know how a cryptographer's mind works. He doesn't know much about computers, either.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|Speaking as someone who actually saw John Legend live, i can honestly say that this man has talent and that his latest album Evolver was a collection of great songs. Seems he always welcomes diversity and has the ability to project a sound that is welcome by ears all over the world. Simply he is classic. I loved every song he wrote or co-wrote on the album (95%). I read reviews that are trying to rip Evolver of its true essence. Listen people, John delevered on this album. He has Evolved, and i'm excited for this ablum. Is it not enough that he writes his own songs? and sounds even better live than in a studio where the walls soak up the smoothness of his voice. 'i love you love', 'this time', 'everybody knows', 'green light', 'quickly', 'good morning','cross the line', 'no other love', are my favs. John is, and has been keeping music alive and classy. So to the haters out there or to those who would belittle his music and song writting abilities, perhaps you wont be satisfied until John collabs with a trashy Pop artist like Ms. Spears, or does a lame remix of 'Bartender' with t-pain....(even though John could probably pull it off with his vocals and thus make me actually like the song). Lets hope though that it never happens, but if it does, no worries. He's doing it, and doing it, and doing it well.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Great DVD to pick up, high replay value.  The cardboard packaging is iffy but consistent with the movie (one would have difficulty imagining landfill/carbon-unfriendly products).  The story is probably one of the best of Pixar's excellent line, both friendly to adults and kids (who woulda thought a robot would be this cuddly).  The added bonus stuff is highly watchable - an extra short BURN-E in addition to the theatrical short, commentary, BnL commercials, robot specs, making of documentaries, and a history of Pixar.  I feel the extras make it worthwhile to pickup the special edition.

B001CD6FKS|5.0|Now, I've seen my share of cartoons elevated to live-action in The Big Hollywood Show.  Some were abysmal, like [[ASIN:B0000AK7AA Casper]].  Some actually were pretty good, like the first [[ASIN:B00006HBUA Scooby-Doo]] movie.  But while the movies and the originals are related, they're still separate elements, each their own thing.  A cartoon can't be live-action and stay true to its cartoon-ness.  Cartoons offer impossible contortion and endless manipulation of set and scene, action and POV, and most importantly the complete and total abrogation of the laws of physics, not to mention that whole life/death thing.  But then came this movie.  This movie is as true to the original [[ASIN:B00008IHAV Speed Racer]] cartoon as it possibly can be; it is without a doubt the best live-action cartoon that has yet to be made.<br /><br />Now, what do I mean by live-action cartoon?  Well, [[ASIN:B000XA5K48 Shoot 'Em Up]] is a cartoon, and its success is that it knows this, and doesn't take itself that seriously.  But junk like the [[ASIN:B000HA4WT8 The Fast and the Furious]] and [[ASIN:B000FKO3WG The Transporter Collection]] movies, they pretend to some kind of legitimacy, while telling an action-packed story they're essentially remaining in the realm of the possible, despite physical laws and imperatives going out the window with the first chase scene.<br /><br />A live-action cartoon is not just swapping people and sets for cells and/or backgrounds, auteur production designers for Korean animators, and the mandatory CGI green screen.  It's so much deeper than that.  A true live-action cartoon is about the delicate translation of the unique cartoon cosmos, the rhythm and feel of the original cartoon into live action, about pacing and timbre and capturing the essence--nay, the very soul!--of a that 2-D rendering in the immensely challenging venue of full-on 3-D, with real actors.<br /><br />Of course, the CGI helps immensely, and this movie has got it like mad.  But, despite the numbing presence and absolutely crucial role CGI plays in setting the scenes and keeping the action excruciatingly intense, the computer power does not overwhelm and take over the film, as so unpleasantly was the case in the [[ASIN:B00139W3NE The Golden Compass]], [[ASIN:B00005JPH2 Narnia]], etc.<br /><br />If you're a deep fan of the original Speed Racer cartoon, you'll love this film.  You'll see more in the characters, the scenes, the posing and in the action than others will.  You've got the original Speed Racer theme song, pumped up and roaring.  You've got Spritle and Chim-Chim in the trunk, with the candy.  You've got the cartoon-impossible car-racing action, right out of the original show, with the gadgets and flips and spins.  You've even got Speed's classic pose from the end of the opening credits, if you're quick enough to catch it.<br /><br />Two of the film's fight scenes, one with the family in a hotel room and the other with the bad guys in a mountain wayside are what made this film for me.  Both are right out of the original cartoon, with Pops wading in with his moustachio'd, huge-armed ferocity and hilarity.  The editing and pacing are right out of the cartoon, with the moves and even the camera angles so very similar.  This was as live-action as it could get, and they worked as original/derived action sequences, while evoking the sweet childhood memory of afternoons sneaking off to a buddy's house to watch the cartoon.<br /><br />The cartoon fantasy starts immediately.  Physics as we live it is completely irrelevant, with cars traveling somewhere around 500 mph, the drivers intentionally doing flips, spins and pirouettes while airborne as part of their racing craft.  The physical structures in the scenes are beyond outrageous, as are the characters, the cars and the engines that power them.<br /><br />In keeping with the original cartoon, no one is killed in this movie.  My mother forbade me to watch this show, its fighting and gunplay, car wrecksand explosions too violent for her taste.  I nodded in solemn resignation, then went down the street to Adam's house to watch it every day.  But in this film, as in the cartoon, no one dies.  It's like the [[ASIN:B00005JN80 The A-Team]]; the driver is thrown clear from his car, with futuristic escape and safety devices.  The physical violence is thoroughly cartoon-y, with no blood or gore.<br /><br />The film even keeps the original character names, with Snake Oiler and even Crusher Block.  Inspector Detector plays a major role, but I guess that CGI just hasn't progressed to the point to always have his beard sticking perpendicularly out from the side of his face.  You've got the car acrobatic team, racing through ice caves, driving up a mountain, helicopters chasing the race, a bit of Mammoth Car homage, and with more than enough Japanese content to place the film in its original Nippon.<br /><br />And the colors, oh, the dizzying colors.  They are intense as they can be, a near-nauseating blast of sparkling, flashing, whizzing and blurring colors, with everything in motion.  This isn't the straightforward chromatic assault we got from [[ASIN:B00005T7I1 Dick Tracy]], but is a thousand times more intense, all of the colors brighter, more day-glo, more intense, and always moving.<br /><br />The film bogs down only slightly in a couple of spots, when we get a bit too deep into Speed's adoration of his martyred brother and the overemphasized father-son relationship themes.  Racer X's treatment and portrayal are outstanding in every way, right down to his car.  I was disappointed to see the ravishing Susan Sarandon made out to be far more of a boring matron than I perceive her to be.<br /><br />Bottom line: I loved Speed Racer as a kid, but watching the original cartoon now is a joke because it is so low-budget and truly one-dimensional.  It's clear the Wachowski Brothers loved the show, too, so meticulous is their deep and spot-on translation of this Japanime classic into a CGI-powered memory for the next generation.olemn resignation, then went down the street to Adam's house to watch it every day.

B0013FDM7E|5.0|[[ASIN:0765318741 I Am Legend]], the novel, spawned the vampires-as-physical-phenomena genre.  Vulnerabilities to religious icons were merely psychological holdovers from victims of a disease who believed they were vampires.  But the thirst for blood was very real. It established the post-apocalyptic fear of contamination.<br /><br />Since I Am Legend is a Will Smith vehicle, I figured it'd have some wisecracks, a lot of action, and Smith saving the day.  So I was surprised to get exactly that - but not delivered in the way I expected.<br /><br />I Am Legend is very much like a [[ASIN:B0000C825J A Boy & His Dog]] in that our two protagonists are Robert Neville (Will Smith), a virologist responsible for finding a cure in New York City, and his dog Samantha, wandering a world gone mad. What's interesting about I Am Legend is the question posed by the title.  Why is Neville a legend?<br /><br />The most obvious answer is that Neville is immune to the disease that has converted 90 percent of humanity.  As such, he believes he holds the cure within himself.  In that regard, if Neville can succeed in stopping the plague, he will be a legend to all of humankind.  But there's more to I Am Legend than that.<br /><br />It's fitting that his companion is a dog.  With only Sam as his companion, Neville is truly a legend; the only other living being idolizes Neville, just as dogs idolize their masters.  Neville also creates a fictional community of people out of mannequins in a DVD rental store, where everybody knows his name.  Neville is indeed a legend in his own mind.<br /><br />There's also the possibility, posited in the original story, that Neville isn't famous as a savior, but infamous amongst the new breed of humanity as a mass murderer.  In that regard Neville is legendary not because of whom he saves but whom he kills.  Neville sacrifices countless of the infected in a quest for a cure, and in the process loses a little bit of his own humanity.<br /><br />I Am Legend could easily have been an egotistical macho romp in a world gone mad in the vein of [[ASIN:B00005R2IS Mad Max]].  Instead, it is a thoughtful meditation on how communities define ourselves, even if your only friend is a dog.  Although the director flinches at the uncompromising ending that could have been (and is on the two-disc special edition), I Am Legend is a serious entry in both science fiction movies and Will Smith's string of blockbusters.romp in a world gone mad in the vein of [[ASIN:B00005R2IS Mad Max]].

0312330537|5.0|I have never read any novel that can at all, and in any way compare with the raw, soulwrenching, sheer power, grace, and glory of this so called \\"novel\\" Shantaram. Brothers Karamazov comes closest, but I think what Gregory Roberts has given us is a book that will in time, i truly believe, become the greatest piece of literature ever put to press. It is so much more than just a book! As I tell my surprised, skeptical friends: \\"It is my Bible\\".
006074748X|5.0|It's symptomatic of the way I found books and authors when I was younger that I never discovered Mary Stewart's gothics until a couple of years ago. In my teens and early twenties, I loved Victoria Holt's gothics, considering them a peculiar sort of mysteries, and a bit of a guilty pleasure. I hadn't heard the term \\"gothics\\". I'd have loved Mary Stewart's books, too, but it never occurred to me to look for books similar to Holt's; nor did I talk to any other readers about them. Not that I really knew any other readers. The same thing happened with mysteries, and science fiction and fantasy. I read everything by a handful of authors, some popular, some more obscure, but completely missed a lot of the giants of the genres.<br /><br />But it's all good. It just means that I have a few zillion old books to enjoy... along with the few zillion new books on my list.<br /><br />Airs Above the Ground is a bit unusual for a gothic, in my experience anyway, in that the heroine is already married to the hero. Vanessa thinks her new husband is on a business trip to Stockholm... then she sees him in a newsreel with another woman on his arm--and they're in Vienna.<br /><br />So when a friend asks Vanessa to escort her teenaged son to visit his father in Austria, Vanessa takes the chance to find out what's going on, and they find themselves caught up in the exotic world of a small traveling circus, international drug smuggling, mysterious deaths, and the world-famous Lipizzaner Stallions. Not to mention the difficulties of being newlyweds.<br /><br />The atmosphere is pure gothic, and a lot of people rave about the horses (I'm not a fan of horses), but what I enjoyed most about this book is how all the various threads intertwined and affected each other.

0380804557|5.0|I'd started reading this one years ago, then put it down for some reason, and my daughter picked it up. She's nagged me on and off ever since to read it.<br /><br />Stardust is a fairy tale, with all that implies. There's an impossible quest, true love, things that aren't what they seem, and the triumph of Good and cleverness over Evil.<br /><br />Tristran Thorn, the product of a human father and, unbeknownst to him, a fairy mother, ventures into Faerie to capture a fallen star and bring it back to win his true love Victoria. He finds the star, which turns out to be in the form of a girl. He encounters a variety of obstacles, including a witch who wants the star's heart to restore her youth and a set of brothers who take sibling rivalry to new heights, who'll stop at nothing to get the jewel the star has with her.<br /><br />There's really not much more to say. If you liked fairy tales as a child, you'll like Stardust. It's charming and evokes the wonder and excitement of those childhood tales without being condescending or overly sentimental or sweet.

B000FSME1A|1.0|Alright, let me start off by saying that, although this dossier has a huge amount of lost footage, features, and pretty much everything but the kitchen seat, it is FAR from \\"complete\\". There was an exclusive 3-Disc version sold at Target which has seemingly disappeared off the face of the earth. I find it ironic they call the more common two-disc dossier the essential version, when it doesn't even have the trailers or the \\"Compound Explosion\\" scene, regardless of the fact that it has everything else. There's also a work print version flying around, and Francis Ford Coppola even said it himself that the raw, raw footage went for over 5 hours long and added-up to over a million feet of film total.    I got this for $9, but I never thought WHY it was marked-down. I think I have a theory now. This packaging is so flimsy that it actually came-apart from a poor glue job. And that black part in the upper-left, as well as the back? That's not \\"really\\" a part of the set: its a shamelessly tacked-on piece of paper, holding-on only by a sparse amount of glue on the top of the cheap cardboard case. Its not even applied to the whole of the back surface area, its just kind of there to fool you! The \\"wax\\" seal is a criminally weak piece of cardboard with barely-functioning velcro to help keep the contents inside. I actually kept the plastic wrap this DVD came in just to keep the back side intact.    Looks can be deceiving. Only buy this if its very cheap, or if its the three-disc version. This abomination is an insult to Coppola's masterpiece.

B001EYGOEM|5.0|Ironically, I thought the first Taylor Swift album was terrible [I got it for free, thankfully], but I heard her sing \\"Love Story\\" on the Country Music Awards, and although her vocals were weak, I found the song very catchy, so I picked up \\"Fearless\\" on sale.  As cheesy and girly as it is, I LOVE this album, and have been listening to nothing else for the 2 weeks since I got it.  The title track (\\"Fearless\\") is the first song on the album, and it's a strong opener.  Though I must say, \\"Fairy Tale\\" would have been a much better title for this album since these lightweight tunes are about as 'fearless' as a puppy dog on a stormy night, and have tons of prince/princess/horses/hand-holding/standing outside of bedroom windows type references.      \\"Fearless\\" is a collection of songs that any teeenaged girl can relate to. Are the lyrics profound? Nah. The music innovative and brilliant?  Nope.  But nor does it need to be.  The beauty of this album is in it's simplicity, and the best way to enjoy this cd is to take it for exactly what it is: the romantic musings of a young girl in [and sometimes out] of love, set to catchy melodies with memorable hooks.  For a little old lady like myself [I'm 29], this is a pleasant throwback to high school; a time when you want so badly to fit in, and whether or not your crush smiled at you could make or break your day.  It's fun to revisist those days through the eyes of a young singer for whom this stuff is recent reality.    I had every reason not to like this cd [not a *huge* country fan, not 18, never known \\"small town\\" life, etc.], but like a plain ol' peanut butter and jelly sandwhich, it just hits the spot.      Favorite tracks:    Fearless  Breathe  Fifteen  Love Story

I'm just saying we don't recommend this for a child who's attention span isn't long enough to withstand the periods of time where there isn't much going on in the movie.  We were expecting more of a fast pace and colorful movie.  The movie had a lot dull, dark moments that didn't keep your attention as well as we had expected.

0316017922|4.0|The book certainly deserves a 4 or a 5 star for narration and editing. However, when one abstracts all the excellent and entertaining examples and cited research, it is hard to argue that the author manages to say anything profound or dramatic.  A 3* at best for original contribution.      Through a series of interesting observations and cited research, Gladwell perhaps makes one important point in \\"success arises from a steady accumulation of advantages\\" further amplified in \\"...not even geniuses ever make it alone\\".  If that strikes you as a very deep and novel insight, you will worship this book.  If not, you will be entertained by the excellent narrations of the role of chance in a wide variety of fields where arbitrary decisions such as cut-off dates can have long lasting persisting impacts - Kindergardens, Canadian hockey, soccer team selection, etc.  Along this fun ride you will also learn about convergence and divergence tests, impact of practice (and how much you need), general and practical intelligence, the power of cultural legacies in impacting our behavior, Hofsted's dimensions, etc.   Particularly, the discussion that centered around why Ivy league admissions should be based on lottery and the discussion on Korean air crashes, were particularly interesting.  The stories of Bill Joy and Bill Gates also provide some interesting insights that may be new to most readers. The epilogue makes for some poignant reading.     Overall, the 'findings' of this book may be most utilized by educators and education policy wonks.  Some of these narrations (perhaps displaying some sort of a confirmation bias) clearly lend to the idea that education systems need to pay more attention in how they \\"select, stream and differentiate\\".  An entertaining and informative read, though the conclusion and the fundamental premise seems a little obvious (unless you are a total believer in all the rags-to-riches stories you've read).

B001ED7C58|5.0|The Twilight Soundtrack is one of the best compilation CDs I've ever heard.  It has a great mix of rock, soothing acoustic guitar, and part of the original score.  The tracks selected fit the book and movie very well, and Carter Burwell's Lullaby is enchanting.  Rob Pattinson's \\"Never Think\\" is amazing.  It's too bad that his other song from the movie, \\"Let Me Sign\\" didn't make it onto this CD.  Regardless, I love the soundtrack!!
0141441496|5.0|I have to admit I've missed this classic for too long. Still holds up and works for today's audience.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|six seasons packaged in one attractive box.  A great chance to see and hear the brilliance of this series .  Well written and acted.  They are missed:-)
B001EO2UJK|5.0|This is an amazing set.  I have been listening to the SACD import version (which everyone except amazon seems to know has already been released) which brings a clarity and fidelity to these recordings like nothing before it!  It is hard to believe this music is closing in on 40 years old, and in 5.1 surround sounds as fresh as if it had been recorded yesterday. Some of the mixing choices are different than I remember on the orginals (some better, some not), however, I am also hearing new sounds that were previously obscured within the mix.  Highly recommended!
0756404746|5.0|I have to say after reading George Martin's work, one longs for more high fantasy works like this.  You know the kind:  Lots of human emotion and interaction, plot twists, humor, sadness, adventure, with just a touch of magic or monsters.  This is high fantasy at its best!  Can't wait for Book 2.
B00008NRI8|5.0|I first watched this movie at a friend's house 4 years ago and I have to say I really enjoyed it! It is a funny romantic comedy that delves into the developing chemistry between two people (Sandra Bullock as Lucy and Hugh Grant's character as George Wade).<br /><br />The story is basically about Lucy who goes to work for George Wade's multimillion company as an assistant in exchange for Wade's help to keep a local Community Center standing and not have it torn down to build a new shopping development. Later as she goes on working for him she gets fed up about the lack of attention and respect that she receives so she gives him her 2 weeks Notice. What happens after that is a budding romance between Bullock's and Grant's character that leads to pleasant and surprising twists and turns. At one point in the movie when Lucy gets frustrated she calls Wade \\"the most selfish man on the planet\\"! I don't want to ruin the movie for people who didn't watch it by saying if the Community Center remains open, but either way it is a laugh out loud romantic comedy the whole family will enjoy.<br /><br />If you haven't seen this movie already you are missing out! Many Blockbuster Videos have older movies for rental for only $1.99, or you can rent it via Netflix. I highly recommend this movie. Goo see it!
0307269752|5.0|The best book in ages.  Tragedy that he is gone: blessing that there are a few more.  Heart is broken over ending: must repair!!!!!!!!
B0008JIJ2E|5.0|It's a little surprising to realize that \\"The Karate Kid\\" is now 24 years old.  Made in 1984, it still holds its own in 2008.  In fact, it's a LOT better than many of the movies being churned out today.<br /><br />Why?  For me, it's simply the excellent acting.  Somehow, the chemistry between \\"Daniel-san\\" and \\"Mister Miyagi\\" is excellent, and memorable.  Without this, the movie would have been forgotten decades ago.<br /><br />\\"Daniel's\\" mother also does an excellent job, deftly managing to portray a total airhead without so much as a hint that anything is wrong.  (What DID happen to Daniel's father, anyway?)<br /><br />To my mind (and time will tell) this re-make of \\"Rocky\\" is, oddly enough, a lot better than the original!  That doesn't happen very often!<br /><br />A very high recommendation, especially if you are getting tired of films full of nothing but explosions.
0920668364|1.0|I do not understand how people can claim this is a healthy depiction of a mother's love.  The mother in this book understands no boundaries.  It is very creepy that she sneaks into her grown son's room using a ladder after driving across town.  While I understand and approve of the concept of unconditional love and being a mother myself have often told my girl that she will always be my baby, I do not believe in the extreme links this mother went to.  Why does everyone ignore the obvious mental health issues?
031606792X|5.0|I really enjoyed the book, the story line and the ending.  I was incredibly sad when it was over and I had to face the fact that the series was finished - fingers crossed that there will be more B&E.
0525950079|1.0|As good as Pillers of the Earth was that's how bad the World Without End is.    It is a real soap opera. The characters are tortured without end in an unrealestic way. As a student of midevil culture I have a insite into the time. His physical discriptions are good but the application of what many of the characters do is unrealistic being that they are either pure evil or good, no gray areas people are not like that.The book is an exact copy of his first book. The characters are the same moved 200 years later and follow the same pattern doing the same things. You can figure out what is going to happen next,it is that obvious. The book is annoyning to read in that the plots and twists are telegraphed so much that it becomes boring.The juvinile sex is even boring.    It is a ashsame that great authors have to surcome to the mighty dollar and because they have a great book they think they can churn out a second with in the same format. Write something new and different. I hate soap operas and that what the book is.
B00003CXA6|4.0|Gettsbug's Collectors Edition in 1993 had 17 additional minutes.  This should be available on dvd.<br /><br />After years of waiting, the commemorative edition of Gettysburg with the addition minutes became available in 2012, as well as the extended version of Gods and Generals.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I love Christmas music, but even so, all the traditional, as well as newer versions of Christmas songs can get tiresome.  Therefore, it was with great enthusiasm when I purchased 'And Winter Came.'  Wow!  Something different and more! While the album is dramatic, it is still very sweet!  I am so glad I took a chance!
006085880X|4.0|Well written story...I enjoyed it over all.  Character development on the girl could have been better, more believable.
0618871713|5.0|The fact that it's a graphic novel isn't what makes Alison Bechdel's revelatory memoir about growing up in a funeral home with her mother, siblings and her erudite, closeted father such a dazzler, though without it (she is the author of the syndicated comic strip, Dykes to Watch Out For), one would miss this artist's wry, loopy visual depiction of the rural upstate where she grew up, and the encyclopedic ambivalence of faces that often convey more human truth than those of flesh and blood.  But it's her literary voice that makes Fun Home a must-read bildungsroman in this age of Proposition 8 and America's morality wars: it's naked, full of wit and pain in its observance of one woman's gay coming of age.
0064430227|5.0|Harold and the Purple Crayon is an abosolutly wonderful book.  I enjoyed reading it as much as my son did. It is a fun book that sparks the imagination.  Who knew a purple crayon could do so much?
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Most Americans should watch this series in order to understand some of the truths behind the founding of our country. In addition to this, John Adams had such a full and interesting life, how could one not be intrigued by this story. It is almost unbelievable that one man could do so many things in one life-time. Also, the acting, cinematography, and direction is fantastic.
B001E1DJD4|3.0|I like Yamagata and thought 'Happenstance' was brilliant, but this one just plodded on - you'll need to be in an almost comatose mood to enjoy it... I'm told Disc 2 is more promising, but I couldn't even get past track 3 on Disc 1... am hopeful that further spins may reveal some gems...
0375826726|1.0|Paolini is overrated.  So grossly overrated.  Yes, the guy is incredibly young and wrote a very good story at an age when your chiefest concern should be which zit to pop first.  He should have stopped there.  If anything, his skills have deteriorated throughout this series to a point where the effort to turn each page in this book feels like I'm lifting a station wagon.  I won't go on and on as it is apparent that this book has turned enough people against St. Christopher of Paolini, but I just want to get something off of my chest:  I hope Saphira dies.  Every time that dragon opens her mouth I just want to set the book on fire.  Why Paolini made the choice to create this awesome character and then fill her craw with the most cliche, unoriginal dialogue is beyond my reasoning.  She speaks like a romance novel.  Alright that's it.  Don't buy this book.
B001GZ6QBU|5.0|I saw this movie, and was simply blown away. I have never been more into a movie than this one. Perfect cast, fantastic acting, intresting in almost all aspects. This is probaly my favorite movie of the year, but the only other one that rivals it is eagle eye (which i highly recomend to any fans of action movies). It's a real toss up, but they're both so good in different ways. I'm gonna have to give 1st place to The Dark Knight.  If you haven't seen this film, you haven't lived life to the fullest, go and watch it right now!   Now you've read this, so go!
0446579939|2.0|I have been home sick and was looking for a good book to read.  My Mom had ordered this book and passed it on to me.  Quite honestly, I don't think I'll ever read another Nicholas Sparks novel.  Although, I have enjoyed some of his earlier works, The Notebook and Message in a Bottle, this book seemed to have little more substance than a Harlequin novel.  Call me jaded, but that's the way I felt.
0393317552|5.0|I've seen so many critiques and reviews on the internet, from scholars and professional reviewers, that seem like they haven't even read the book.  For almost every critique that can be raised, Jared Daimond addresses it in his book already.  If you will just read the book yourself, in its entirety, you will see what I mean.  This book and the broad explanations he puts forward are pretty much beyond reproach, not least because of their broad scope.      Many criticisms can be refuted because the book focuses on the broadest patterns of history, taken over timespans of several hundred years or more.      Another essential point to keep in mind before critiquing is that Daimond distinguishes between proximate and ultimate factors, and raises this distinction repeatedly throughout the book.  So before raising a criticism, stop and considered whether you are addressing a proximate cause (like technological advances, or large population) or an ulimate cause (which will inevitably be reduced to one of a few factors which are the very premise of the book).    These ultimate factors can be crudely boiled down to the following:  1)Naturally occurring species of easily domesticable plants (species which are highly nuritious) and large animals.    2)Geographical features (impassable mountains and deserts, location across differing latitudes and climates) that facilitate or impede diffussion of agriculture, technology, and population.    --and that is the book in a nutshell.  Those grossly reduced ideas I will carry with me forever and consider every time I hear an explanation of historical outcomes.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Truly awesome!  Robert Downey Jr.'s performance was stellar.  They also left an open door for sequels.  I want one of those suits!!
B001M6KTLG|2.0|Unfortunately, there is way too much of an effort of this film to get laughs. The sarcasm is over the top. The film, apparently, was directed at a much younger audience, who care more about fast-paced action than a intricate plot.The special effects were way overboard and took away from any real storyline and/or dialogue. Entertaining, perhaps, but in my opinion this series has come to a screeching hault.
B00004XQJX|3.0|...I can't find it in this recording of the Diabelli Variations. To be honest, not really a surprise. As is so often the case with Pollini, his playing lacks color, humor and fantasy here. Oh yes, there is plenty of virtuosity. To quote a professional music critic: \\"Pollini storms through imperiously, without ever relaxing. Without paying much attention to musical imagination, Pollini keeps steady tempi through each variation and doesn't make an attempt to reveal Beethoven's wit, while there is so much humor to be found in this great work. It is take-it-or-leave-it Beethoven, straight in your face, sometimes even quite brusque. As Gramophone magazine so rightly stated: \\"Pollini's impressive virtuosity and fidelity to the score nevertheless fail to bring Beethoven's music to life. The impression remains of an application of tried and tested formulae rather than of a real interpretation\\". There is video with Pollini playing a few variations at Youtube. Judge for yourself.<br /><br />I feel Pollini is at his very best in performances of 20th century composers, like Boulez, Ligetti, Stockhausen and Stravinski. Yet, he keeps returning to the  romantic composers of the 19th century, apparently to the delight of his many admirers.<br /><br />For the finest performances of the Diabelli Variatons I recommend the live recording by Gregory Sokolov (available from [...]) and the legendary recording by Stephen Kovacevich ([[ASIN:B000E8N7PI Beethoven: Diabelli Variations]]). Not to be missed!<br /><br />Added later (February 2010): I recently discovered the recording by Anatol Ugorksi. A revelation! ([[ASIN:B00000E539 Beethoven: Diabelli-Variationen]])
B0001AP158|4.0|I wasn't completely crazy about all of the song \\"remakes\\" but let me tell you, this DVD is worth it's weight in gold.... You get to see Jon in a different light, and you see how much he's enjoying himself. \\"This Left Feels Right\\" also includes his performance of \\"Last Man Standing\\", it has always been my favorite song of his, and I LOVE being able to see him perform it. Jon sure does do a body good! YUM =)
B000053ZRR|5.0|Bon Jovi's \\"The Crush Tour\\" DVD is by far in my opinion the best of all the \\"Live\\" performances. Trust me when I say that because I have all his DVD's an CD's! A little obsessed? Yes! Do I act like teenage groupie at 30 years old? Yes! This DVD show's you our favorite rock star at his sweaty and determined greatest! I especially love the part where he pulls a VIP member from sidestage and dances with her! I wonder if she knows she envied all around the world! So to the point...this would be a wonderful video to add to any collection for the newbie fan's and oldie fan's as well! I hope this helps!
0618918248|5.0|Every Christian should read this book.  As a Christian I always like to know the objections to my faith.  And for any belief (i.e.Darwinism) there is a bit of faith required.  I'm sure each individual has issues with their faith - that's why its faith.  But don't expect to find many legitiate objections here.  After reading this book my faith actually increased to see that there is such a weak case against it.  Although to be honest I think I could come up with better objections.  The general gist is a few strawmen, poor logic, and to my surprise some circular logic.
0670020745|5.0|I recommend this book for anyone who has had a stroke or who lives with someone who has.. We saw Dr. Taylor on the Oprah show and were greatly impressed by her story and who she was..    There are a couple of chapters that are difficult to read as they are quite technical, but the rest is very informative..
B0007OCG56|3.0|I love this film I just hope my auntie enjoyed it as much as I did...
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|I have not ever disliked a cd from Enya and I am glad this one proves it again. While Enya may not be for everyone due to the wonderful relaxing, emotional, and sometimes spirit lifting tones mixed with beautiful lyrics and a voice that is unique I feel that this cd is an exception and everyone should at least listen to it at least one time.     I am not one for classic holiday music since it is overdone to death and this is not what you would consider classic but in its own right it will become a classic at least in my collection.     A beautiful mix of music for background or just to listen to that will hopefully bring you and your family or loved ones into a loving holiday spirit.     Happy Holidays.
B001L5Q5O8|5.0|Premiering last year, this Taylor Swift Holiday Collection is delightful!  Though short, along with her sweet voice, the mix of usual songs with her own keeps you interested. As all of Taylor's music, you will find yourself humming it through the day. Enjoy!
B001H9MWW2|3.0|A worthy extension of Viva for Coldplay fans.  A bright spot for me was to hear vocals overlayed to the \\"Life in Technicolor\\" track (part ii). . .but did we really need to hear Jay-Z rapping over (my favorite track) Lost!?  The other material here is not earth shattering, but enjoyable.  4 stars moves to 3 for the Rush like mistake (roll the bones) of adding a train wreck into the middle of a great track.  It's like listening to Bach and hearing Angus Young's guitar crunch jammed into the middle of the symphony.
B000CCIVDO|5.0|ive had theese for over a year now(i have them on at least 4-6 hours a day), and i never regret buying them. theyre cheap and durable, have clean sound with Excellent bass playback (for the price..)  They didnt quite fit my ears well, and theyre uncomfortable to wear for people with long-ish hair, so what i did is i retracted them all the way, and i wear them as a behind-the-neck headphones. this way you get MUCH better \\"grip\\" with your years, and sound won't \\"leak out\\". Tho you might be getting headaches for wearing them for too long first couple tiems.     k..  PROS: Price(seriously.. 30 bucks?). Sound quality. theyre well built(as i said, im using them for over a year now). 1/8 to 1/4 connector! use them with your guitar amp and PC!  Cons: Cord. Its too short. No mic.... not really a con worth removing a star.   Conclusion: They might seem like a pair of cheap and agile 99c store headphones but theyre not. this is a high-quality product for very VERY cheap. If you are on a budget and you need high-quality headphones no need to look further. this product is for you.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I'm sure everyone is raving over this one of a kind musical blog, as they should be. It is great in every way.   I am here to say that even if you have bought it on itunes, or watched it free online you should definitely not think twice about picking this dvd up.  For one, I hear that they recorded a whole musical commentary to go along with it, which is suppose to be great.  Also, This was made very cheaply, Many people didn't get paid, including the special effects team that worked on Buffy. They did this for free in hopes one day they would be repaid for their efforts.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|Okay, I admit that the main reason I saw it was for Colin Firth.  However, even if he wasn't in it (GASP!) I would have enjoyed it.  It was fun for all.  It makes you leave the theater with smile plastered on your face.  This was a first movie in a long time that actually got a round of applause after the film was over.<br /><br />Pierce was the weakest link in the singing department, but you can tell he really tried.  There was great chemistry among the cast.  This seemed like an enjoyable movie to work on.<br /><br />The men played the so-called girl roles in this film, while the women ran the show.  So true to real life.  lol<br /><br /> I would recommend this highly!
B0013ND30M|5.0|My girls and I love watching Sleeping beauty. I think my oldest loves it a little too much because she wants to watch it every night before her bed time. The video with Emily Osment is beautiful.. I would recommend this DVD...
B000002GFT|4.0|If you're new to the genre of Traditional English folk-rock, this may sound a bit cheesy and dated. Fairport Convention, as well as Steel-Eye Span; attempted to up-date classic English and Irish folk songs with mixed results. You have to give them a lot of credit for researching these old songs and making them accessible to a modern audience. I'd like to see this get re-made minus the twangy electric guitars.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|Horrible way to end the Indiana Jones franchise.  This is by far the worse movie in the franchise.  I'd rank them from best to worse as 1-Raiders, 2-Last Crusade, 3-Temple of Doom, 4-Crystal Skull.    You'd think Spielberg/Lucas and company would create better films as they got older and more experience.  /shrug
B000RPTQ1C|1.0|This album really is not sincere Coldplay. This is a departure from what they truly are as musicians. I recently saw them on tour here in Phoenix, I must say i was disappointed. The X&Y tour was much better, much more impressive very powerful and memorable. I vaguely remember the Viva la Vida show I just saw, that's what kind of an impression it left on me. The album itself does not grab me at all and lacks the power of the previous three. I hope that Chris Martin and the Boys wake up and are true to themselves. It is not worth alienating longevity or true fans to please a few critics. If you are new to Coldplay before buying this album listen to Parachutes, Rush of Blood to the Head and X&Y first so you have an idea of what Coldplay REALLY sounds like when they are themselves.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|I love this movie and I haven't been able to stop watching it. I also bought the soundtrack. The music is superb. I wish that I could have a romance like that. The movie is so romantic and Bullock and Reeves are a great pair. Even though it is a fantasy, when you get into it, it seems so real.  A must see over and over again.
B0012DOOF6|5.0|This is one of the Beatles Finest!! If you love them or just like them   you can't go wrong with this CD.The extra tracks here are just so so but  instering to hear none the less.This is a must have for any Fab 4 fan.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|Great set... but still, why is everybody ignoring \\"From Genesis to Revelation\\" album? While not the greatest, it's as part of Genesis's history as everythng else, and definitely better in musical terms than some of the latest creations.
B0010OMXKA|5.0|Tuscany is beautiful, Andrea is never better than in this DVD.  Enjoy.  And plan to visit Tuscany (which I'm doing this coming year, and for a concert in the same location as the one in this DVD)!!
0790729393|5.0|Sleepers made headlines even before its release when claims arose that writer Lorenzo Carcaterra had lied about the book being \\"Based on a True Story.\\"  This seems redundant given the BROAD nature of the phrase but never-the-less some cared more about the accuracy of the film than the message that it delivered.<br /><br />An all-star cast of Robert De Niro, Kevin Bacon, Brad Pitt, Jason Patric, Dustin Hoffman & Minnie Driver et al each provide a unique piece to the overall picture.  De Niro's performance of Father Bobby is very convincing.  He is the father figure to a lot of the potentially lost youth in Brooklyn.<br /><br />The message of the movie is simple, these things happen to children because the system is a failure.  The ending is a metaphor and it is clear...If justice is indeed blind, then those that are failed by the system can have their wrongs righted by beating the system.  This is a great movie to say the least.
B001GKJ2F2|3.0|There are two distinct audiences that will be watching Wanted.  Those that are seeking an ultra-slick looking action flick in the vein of The Matrix, and those that are fans of Mark Millar's ultra-violent comic book mini-series.  Needless to say, Wanted delivers as an action flick on its own merits, but sadly doesn't give its source material the justice it deserves, and while there are some dynamite action scenes to be found here, it lacks what made the comic so good in the first place.  James McAvoy stars as Wesley Gibson; an office drone stuck in a dead end everyday life until he runs into the seductive Fox (Angelina Jolie), and thus learns that he is the son of the world's greatest assassin.  Soon enough, Wesley learns of his place in the secret Fraternity, run by the enigmatic Sloan (Morgan Freeman), and begins to receive training to follow in his father's footsteps and take vengeance on his killer Cross (Thomas Kretschmann).  Things aren't what they seem however, as Wesley soon learns.  Directed by Russian director Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Day Watch), Wanted is loaded with slick and bloody action sequences, and is frequently compelling as well.  The cast isn't bad either, even if McAvoy comes off as a bit whiny in the role.  Still, as a film, Wanted is so different from Mark Millar's comic that it misses the mark in terms of attitude and pitch black comedic moments.  It isn't any secret that Wanted in its purest comic form would be unfilmmable, given the ultra-nihilistic nature, but the film's story is such a departure from the source material that it hardly bears any resemblance except for the character names of Wesley and Fox.  Still, Wanted delivers in terms of big-budget action flicks, and is still worth seeing regardless of its flaws.
B001DPC52C|5.0|Sharon is fantastic and the entire concert rocks! Guest vocalists, the choir and orchastra along with special effects (big screen, pyro etc) add to the enjoyment as does Sharon's multiple costumes...simply stated, a must see!
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|It has been eight years since we last heard a new album from AC/DC, and seven years since we heard a new song from them. God only knows why it took them so long to put out a new album, but Black Ice is here at last. And it does not disappoint at all....    Black Ice opens with Rock 'n Roll Train - the song that we all have been hearing since August (and didn't even realize was new for a few weeks). It is a nice, strong opening done in classic AC/DC style. But moving forward you hear the band delve slightly into Blues on the tracks Skies on Fire, Stormy May Day, and Rock 'n Roll Dream. Of course in between these tracks you hear a lot of classic AC/DC - some of which sounds like a hail back to the Bon Scott days, some sounds like the lesser tracks on Back in Black, and the rest just sounds like the AC/DC we'd all expect. Pretty good stuff, but then you hear the final track - which all I will say about is WOW!!, it is truly one of the best songs AC/DC has ever done in their 30-something year career.    Up until the last track, this album keeps you entertained and pleased. The only complaint is that at one point it does seem to drag on a bit (after all, it is a 15 track album), but it's all worth it.    Favorite Tracks:    Rock 'n Roll Train  Skies on Fire  Big Jack  Anything Goes  War Machine  Stormy May Day  Rock 'n Roll Dream  Black Ice
0439023483|5.0|I couldn't put down The Hunger Games, it's that gripping. Collins gets right into the action from the beginning. Her writing style reminds me very much of Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series because of the adventure and suspense, but also for the sometimes corny dialogue, which was my main problem with the book. Also, I could guess the general outcome of the book from the beginning, but with a first person narrator in a survival contest, what can you expect? But hey, the most important thing is that it kept my interest and was an excellent read. Five stars.
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Nothing and no one can hold a candle to Heath Ledger's tour de force performance.  Bravissimo!
B0000DZ3EN|3.0|OK - My kids loved Wizard of Oz so I picked this up for them. I have 10yr old boy/girl twins and a 4yr old boy. The boys LOVED it but my daughter HATED it! It is MUCH darker than the original movie, but follows the book much closer. I think my daughter was expecting the singing/dancing of the original movie. She was scared to death of The Wheelers and the whole head changing issue. The boys thought the whole movie was \\"cool\\" and not babyish. They liked that it was weird. My personal opinion of the movie? I have to go with my daughter on this one! Didn't like it a bit! I'd take the original Wizard of Oz hands down! Return to Oz is not for the scaredy cats by any means.

0060989157|5.0|I was really suprised when I read this book.  Before reading it, I knew of Motley Crue as a band, that had been around for a while and had lots of groupies and did drugs. That was pretty much my perception of them.    I hadn't really heard there music, and I wasn't really interested.  But I bought this book, and honest to god, they are now my favourite band.    After I finished this book i went and downloaded all the albums, and it was great because as i listened to the albums, i could put each album to a certain part in their careers and match it up to events in the book.  When I listen to 'too fast for love' i remember all the things I read about them starting out and when I listen to Girls, Girls, Girls, I remember the experiences the band was going through at the time, with Nikki's indulgent addiction, etc.    I think motley crue are an inspiring band and each member is nothing without the other 3.     This book is the greatest book i have ever read and i doubt that will change any time soon.  Whether your a fan of rock, punk, jazz, or african tribal music...this book is for you!
0241141125|3.0|I loved this book growing up and looked forward to giving it to my baby nephew. It definitely stands the test of time with its beautiful watercolor illustrations and unique formatting. However, this package was much smaller than I anticipated. The original book I read was about 11x14 but this book is less than half the size and therefore the stuffed caterpillar is also much smaller than expected. If size does not matter to you - it is a cute combination, but I miss the larger illustrations.
B0000024ZC|4.0|Three Friends is what I would consider to be the best-balanced Gentle Giant album. If you've listened to the first 2 albums and found them to be a little disjointed, and found the latter albums to be a little too experimental, then you'll probably find Three Friends to be a nice balance of storytelling and musical showmanship. It is pretty much progressive rock in the classical sense.    The theme is not difficult to guess, as others have pointed out. Gentle Giant does a good job conveying the story with the lyrics, while using instrumentation to express the context.    For example, in Working All Day, the gritty sax and driving bass gives the listener the impression of a blue collar worker plodding through life, thinking everyone is against him. You can almost see him sitting on a dirty couch with a beer at the end of a hard day working on the roads, with a scowl on his face.    And in Peel the Paint, the initially casual pace and light voicing make it easy to imagine an artist searching his feelings and taking his time to paint. Shortly after you discover that his paintings are used to hide his true nature, and the music takes on a \\"mean streak\\" type of emotion.    The climax of the album is the last track, Three Friends. The bass line is borrowed from the beginning of the previous track, where it is slowed way down and played in unison with the guitar; this establishes the complex framework upon which beautiful vocal harmonies and the mellotron/hammond complete the grand sound. If you are familiar with Yes, the feeling you walk away with is similar to that after having listened to the climax in And You And I, or the last part of Awaken.    The album isn't without flaws. I found quite a few dropouts on my recording, and Schooldays came across as mismatched: it sounds like a lot of disjointed ideas were thrown together, where they might have served better being developed as independent works.
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|Absolutely the best album I've purchased in the past two years. Especially enjoyed the band's performance on Comedy Central.
0307269752|5.0|I loved this book and only wish the next one was coming out sooner.  It is a shame that the author died so young.  You couldn't wait to find out what was next and the characters were so well described that you felt you knew them.  I would recommend this book to anyone.
0143038583|5.0|It will change the way you think about food. I will never look at a can of corn the same way.
B001F290E4|5.0|I cannot believe that no one else is as crazy for this CD as I am-I have loved each song and think they have a distinct stamp...I'm Still In Love With You is a blast...
B001AEF6CW|5.0|Classic favorite -- well packaged, new added extras.  Actually bought it as a gift.
B001G9LVGG|5.0|There is nothing this woman can put out that I won't buy.  This CD was incredible, as is everything she does.  The best part for me was being able to download the music while I waited for the CD to come in the mail!  I enjoyed the traditional mixed with the unique.  I don't normally go for Christmas/Holiday music (too commercial), but I was NOT disappointed in this compilation.  Definately BUY!
B001F12J48|4.0|I've seen the IMAX version and it's astounding.......  the 3D surface to the boy's eyeballs with veins.  Utterly amazing and highly recommended.  Do not expect that from the home version but I found the results on an high resolution laptop or an 52 inch LCD to be quite pleasing for the piddly price one pays for the DVD.    Here is what I think most complaints result from re: the 3D.  The cheap, cardboard glasses are not comfortable......Be glad they provided them for 16 bucks and two discs.   A bargain.  The red is a darker red and is over the left eye....Most viewer's dominant eye...  The cyan is on the right and much lighter..  So then..... One's focus, because the dominant eye has such a darker color, wants to shift over to the right eye being dominant......(easier to see through the much lighter color) (That's why a bright screen really helps_the red then doesn't look so dark and the eyes don't try to shift back and forth...  This shifting of dominance between left and right really goofs up peoples comfort level in trying to view the film.  I found it greatly helps if you try to maintain your dominant eye-view through the left side when it tries to shift to the right eye...  Once you get used to this,.....The clarity and comfort level is much greater and more enjoyable.    Thank you warner for making bricks out of straw.......  Our spoiled consumers just don't appreciate your valiant efforts..
B00008O31I|5.0|This album is the bee's knees. If you work all day at a place with no job security, no heath coverage, make you use your own car to drive to work sites, no compensation for driving, expected to by the CEO a present at that holiday party. You shouldn't buy him this album, it is to good for him. You should buy for yourself, quite your job, show up at the holiday party, bribe the DJ and blast this album and dumb on the CEO's pile of presents.     It's good music to poop to as well.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I used to go to the gym and do this intense class called bodypump. It was great for a few months and I lost a ton of wieght, but I paid for it too. My membership cost me over 60 dollars a month for me and my kids. I quit going there I didnt gain any wieght because I eat right, but I lost all the muscle I had gained and worked so hard for. A few months later my friend told me she wanted to start working out with me. I was running everyother day. I went over to her house so we could go walk, but we ended up talking and running out of time. She pulled out this video and said she' d never tried it before and it was only 20 min. SO we popped it in and in no time at all I was sweating bullets. I ended being so sore the next day It hurt to sit. I hadnt been that sore since I was doing that pump class!! Long story short, I bought the video and do it everyday and I am getting all that muscle back and feel great. Plus its a one time fee...and only 20 min. what more could a busy mom of two ask for!
B0011HOEY4|5.0|The positive reviews' already written says it all.  The scene where Denzel's Lucas burns the $50,000 Chinchilla coat said it all for me.  See what happen's when you show off?  You draw unwanted attention to  yourself!  Lucas was on top of the world and still ended up in jail, his family in ruins.  Great film (and object lesson) for the interested.<br /><br />I rate this movie: 5 stars!
044651506X|5.0|No spoilers.  This is one of my favorite books of all.  I love John Corey; he makes me laugh so much (and there were times when I nearly cried too).  The descriptions of the north shore of Long Island out in Suffolk County are accurate (it's really beautiful out there), and the characters are believable (mostly) and well-developed.  This was the first book by DeMille I ever read and since then I've read everything else he wrote.  I still think this book is his best and John Corey (in this book) his best creation.
0440237688|5.0|This is probably one of the books that I read through the fastest.  It kept me interested throughout and was difficult to put down.  This is one of the first books to ever make me keep reading so I could find out what happens next.  I told myself I was only going to read one more chapter and ended up reading three more before going to bed.  One of the great things about this book is that it is very short and very easy to read.  This isn't one of my favorite books I have ever read but it was very enjoyable and I definitely recommend it.
B00022TPUM|5.0|Album arrived very quickly and in pristine condition.  Would not hesitate to order from this vendor again.  Was extremely satisfied.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|I love AC/DC and this DVD was great. The 5.1 surround sound is awesome and so is the rest.
0380789019|4.0|The otherworldliness of this book reminds me of goethe's faust.  The dip from our reality to another reality is smooth and therefore real.
B001AIRUP4|5.0|My family and i absolutely LOVE this movie!  We can't get enough and my girls go around the house singing the tunes and listening to them again online.  Bound to be a classic in my opinion!  Great creativity!
B001DTPZNY|1.0|Famed archaeologist/adventurer Dr. Henry \\"Indiana\\" Jones is called back into action when he becomes entangled in a Soviet plot to uncover the secret behind mysterious artifacts known as the Crystal Skulls. The year is 1957 and Dr. Jones is being framed. He along with a spunky young man must travel to some dangerous places where no one comes out alive. The Crystal Skull may be something not human and it is up to Indy and his new sidekick, Mutt (spunky young man), to find the answers.<br /><br />What is up with Harrison Ford? I know the guy is older and near retirement age, but this is not the Indy I has grown to love! Harrison acted like he was sleepwalking through the role. Can we say zombie? There was no trademark Indy wit or one-liners I was so use to hearing. He looked so bored and I came to the conclusion in the first five minutes that this would be a major bomb. And you would think with such Oscar winning power with Cate Blanchett as a villain, she would be so evil and diabolical that she would put all other past Indy villains to shame? Not here!! It was like Speilberg asked Cate to forget everything she has ever learned about acting that has made her into the thespian she is and throw all that out the window for his movie. She was annoying and such a cartoon character that I was hoping she would fall into quicksand.<br /><br />There are some other well known actors that pop up that act are just as bad as the rest, One such character is a surprise from Indy's past who is somewhat of a welcome relief to this snore fest. As for Shia LeBeouf, he is a cute kid and has potential. I feel Speilberg is grooming him much like Leonardo DiCaprio is from Scorsese. Shia did bring some life into certain scenes, but overall not even his cutesy antics could save this train wreck of a movie.<br /><br />I also expected E.T. to come out of the Amazon jungle looking to phone home. Yup, Indy and his crew along with the evil Russians (it is the 1950's after all) are on the search for aliens.<br /><br />In a nut shell that is my review. Sorry, it is a bit scathing but I am mourning the loss of a great character and a trilogy that took over a whole decade and set the standard for a blockbuster. This is a slap in the face to the fans, like myself.<br /><br />2 Big Blows Monkey Chunks thumbs down. Wait for DVD, better yet cable.<br /><br />Katiebabsell that is my review.

B001GAPC1K|5.0|Was better in the theater - but this is awesome!  i had my doubts about Robt Downey Jr as a 'superhero', but he was PERFECT! Beginning grabs your attention and remains very interesting!  Cant wait for the sequel!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|After seeing The Dark Knight, I left the theater, literally shaking because what I had just witnessed was movie making at its very best. This is how movies should be made. There is enough action, twists and turns that your head just spins. The acting alone should make you sit up and take notice because the actors are no longer just players on a stage, but rather they are the embodiment of the characters they have become.<br /><br />I now finally understand about the three separate movie posters that each show Batman, the Joker and Harvey Dent with half their faces being covered as they hold up something against one side of their face, while the other side has nothing to hide. These are three men with totally separate goals. One is goodness and everything righteous; the other tries to work for good but is caught between two different worlds; the third has no morals or reason for his madness, he just does what he does because he enjoys it. He is like a dog that chases after a car, knowing he will never catch it just because it is fun to do, or so The Joker tries to explain to Harvey his reasons for the chaos and anarchy he causes.<br /><br />The Dark Knight begins where the last movie has left off. If you haven't seen Batman Begins, no worries, because the director, Chris Nolan, has done a wonderful job of catching the audience up to speed. The first 45 minutes or so are a casual build up, and I admit I was a bit antsy during this time because I was expecting mind numbing action and explosions right away. They come later, and when they do, your heart will be beating a mile a minute.<br /><br />Gotham's criminals have pretty much been inactive mainly because of Batman. There are still some petty crime and the Mob are in control to extent, but things are pretty ho-hum in the villain department. But then a man with a maniacal laugh and a face painted haphazardly with clown makeup makes his entrance. Gotham will never be the same.<br /><br />There is a new District Attorney in town and he is Harvey Dent who is a good guy, deep down to his core. Bruce Wayne is not sure about Harvey, in part, because Harvey has stolen away his old love, Rachel Dawes. Harvey is everything Bruce wishes he could be but can't. In order for Bruce to fight crime as Batman, he must do some things that are not very lawful. Bruce has major issues because of his conscience. How far can he go and should go to keep peace and order? Batman is going to have quite the wake up call because The Joker will shake up the order of things in ways you will not see coming.<br /><br />Whereas Harvey is the face of law and order and is willing to go as far as he can to a point, Batman is given an out because he is a vigilante. Others will turn and look the other way if he has to kill or cause his own chaos to save Gotham. But because Batman has a conscience, unlike The Joker, he will not step over that line even if it means saving the most important people in his life that he cares about. The Joker knows Batman's weaknesses and will do his best to cause total and utter meltdown in Gotham, mainly to get Batman to admit that he has a very dark place inside, that he may have to reach down into, thus becoming The Dark Knight.<br /><br />The Dark Knight is a very, very dark picture. There is so much death and destruction, and the funny thing is, The Joker is responsible for the set up, but he places the decisions in everyone else's hands, and not his own. He may be the cause, but he is not the effect. Batman and The Joker are very much like the pieces on a chessboard. Because they are each other's nemesis and essentially equal, they are always at a checkmate. Wherever The Joker goes, Batman will follow and visa versa. The odd man out is Harvey and again The Joker uses one of Harvey's weaknesses to get him to do what he wants. The Joker is that little demon on your shoulder that tells you want you want to hear even though it may be so very wrong.<br /><br />The Dark Knight is not your childhood Batman. Many issues arise where a person's moral being comes into play. Bruce Wayne and Harvey Dent are very moral people, but when a man like The Joker comes along, who has no rhyme or reason for the destruction he causes, how can these two men not sink down to his level? That is the main question asked and with the end of The Dark Knight, and future installments of this Batman series, this moral dilemma will be the main focus and a foreshadowing of things to come.<br /><br />Visually, The Dark Knight is perfect, but the most important reason to go see a movie such as this, even if you are not a fan of superheroes or comic book action, is the acting. Forget about Michael Keaton; Christian Bale has really succeeded in this role where Michael hasn't. I had hoped the direction of what Batman has to become would be a darker and more unstable individual, and Christian has tapped into Batman's psyche wonderfully. Aaron Eckhart almost took over this movie with his portrayal of Harvey Dent. He even outshined Christian in a few scenes.<br /><br />Last but not least, and I purposely saved the best for last is Heath Ledger. What an incredible way to leave this Earth and on such a high note. I never really appreciated Heath's acting until Brokeback Mountain. I thought he was just another pretty boy actor. I was very much mistaken. If you put all of Heath's scenes together as the Joker, his total on screen running time is about thirty minutes. But those thirty minutes show a true master at work. So many actresses and actors don't have the skill or the inclination to stretch their abilities to the maximum in their work. There are a very select few who vanish as that individual we come to know outside of their professional capacity. They become their character to the point that they disappear in that role. Heath has done so with The Joker. Take the homicidal tendencies of Alex from A Clockwork Orange, with a smidgen of Dr. Hannibal Lector's intuitiveness from Silence of the Lambs, and the face of Gwynplaine from The Man Who Laughs, and you have Ledger's Joker.<br /><br />I could go on with the praise about Heath Ledger's acting mainly because of the tragedy of his death, but quite honestly, The Dark Knight is a group effort with the three men of, Christian Bale, Aaron Eckhart and Heath Ledger. I have only touched upon a small part of why The Dark Knight is such a wonderful viewing experience. Some may this movie success lies because of the skills of director and his players. Perhaps it is the hardcore fans, or it may possibly be the death of an actor who died so young.<br /><br />I say this is a fine movie by people who know what they are doing. It is refreshing to know that there are still professionals in the movie industry that want to give the public quality entertainment, and The Dark Knight is such a movie.<br /><br />Katiebabsmoral being comes into play.

B00003CXPJ|5.0|When my neighbor brought this over for us to watch, I rolled my eyes. How could this obviously juvenile, brain-withering pile be amusing in any shape or fashion?    Oh, how wrong I was!    The premise is that Zoolander (Ben Stiller) is the world's Top Model. After being ousted from this position by Hansel (Owen Wilson), Zoolander falls from grace (snigger) into the clutches of evil Mugatu (Will Ferrell). Mugatu brainwashes him to become the perfect assassin in order to kill the Malaysian prime minister so that he cannot promote child labor laws. Sound ridiculous? Yeah. It is. It's the strangest, best kind of ridiculous I've watched since Oedekerk's Kung Pow.    I laughed non-stop during this movie. It is ridiculously, hilariously stupid, unapologetically so. Will Ferrell is so delightfully over-the-top and so horribly dressed that I kept waiting to see him again. Ben Stiller is so adorably stupid -- something like watching a train wreck in slow motion. The only parts I didn't like were the sexual ones (specifically, the orgy scene, the massage scene, and almost everything relating to Ballstein), but quite frankly, that was just my personal taste. Even those things are so ridiculous that you can't take them all that seriously.    The wonderful stupidity, the lines, the story -- it is all so ridiculous, so out there, so unique -- that you'll most likely find it a delectable treat. Oh, it's fluffy and has all the nutritional content of cotton candy, but what a joyride! Marvel at the gasoline fight accident! The Center for Kids Who Don't Read Good! The miniature cell phone! The mermaid... I mean, man! The icing on the cake is definitely the multitude of cameos. This is comedic gold and it never gets old.    All of this said, I completely understand why some people would give this one star. You'll either really hate it or you'll really like it -- it depends on whether or not you enjoy stupid humor.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Cloverfield is a tragic love story. It begins with two lovers together and ends the same way. The first part of the plot is about giant alien destroying a city, but the subplot is about our hero trying to get to his heroine and save her.<br /><br />The movie starts with our hero, Rob waking up after spending a night with his friend Beth. Rob and Beth were friends but they finally have become lovers. The day is beautiful and these two are so happy. They even spend the day together at Coney Island. Fast forward to a month later. Rob has found a job in Japan and will be leaving to go work there. His brother Jason and his girlfriend Lily are throwing a goodbye party for Rob. Originally Jason was supposed to videotape the event, but he gives that responsibility to Jason's best friend Hud. Hud in turn has a bad crush on Lily's friend Marlena. Rob is surprised and a bit sad because this will be his last night in NYC and with that he must leave Beth behind. Something has happened in the past month because Rob and Beth are not talking. She comes to the party, they fight and she leaves.<br /><br />And this is where the story really begins. The alien monster comes along and begins to destroy everything in its path. Rob, Jason, Lily, Marlena and Hud all try to run and find safety in Brooklyn. They are almost home free when Rob gets a call from Beth. She is hurt, scared and maybe dying. Rob has a decision to make, either continue with his friends to freedom or go into the alien war zone and save the love of his life.<br /><br />Rob quickly decides he must go back and find Beth, regardless of the fact that he may die or that Beth could already be dead. Now I was thinking what is wrong with this guy?? In the immortal words of Monty Python- \\"RUN AWAY!!\\" But the simple fact is, what if it was your true love or if you were a parent and your child called you asking for help? Rob makes the decision and heads to Beth. Because Rob goes, Lily follows and because Marlena is good friends with Lily, she goes also and then there is Hud who because he is such good friends with Rob, will also come along and help his friend. (As for Jason, well Jason doesn't come). These four are now warriors going into a war zone where they may not come out alive. And this is where I realized the underlying story of this sci-fi movie is in essence a love story.<br /><br />We have a love story between Rob and Beth. We have a true love and friendship with Rob and his friend Hud and of course Lily who is good friends with Marlena. But this is a tragic love story so you probably can guess that some of these people won't survive. But what I can tell you is that our two lovers, Rob and Beth are reunited and end up together much like they way they were at the beginning of the movie. As they declare their love (which they never have said) for each others there is a possibility they may not survive.<br /><br />This is the type of love that we read in our romances, where the hero will die trying to get to his one true love and save her. And when the hero and heroine believe they maybe separated forever, that is when all feelings come to the surface and they passionately say \\"I love you\\". And honestly, that has to be the perfect way to go.<br /><br />Cloverfield, a love story?

B001M5UDGS|5.0|I bought 4 copies for Christmas presents (1 for myself). This is awesome! I hope Joss keeps doing what he does best.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My favorite Disney Pixar movie of all time is Toy Story and now I can say that it is WALL*E. If you enjoy the Pixar movies, you will love this movie. Even if you aren't a fan of animation, I whole heartily recommend you go see WALL*E. As an adult I was taught a lesson. When a child and adult can leave a movie together and talk about the same things they watched and ask questions, that is really an amazing thing.<br /><br />Synopsis: What if mankind had to leave Earth, and somebody forgot to turn the last robot off? After hundreds of lonely years of doing what he was built for, WALL*E (short for Waste Allocation Load Lifter Earth-Class) discovers a new purpose in life (besides collecting knick-knacks) when he meets a sleek search robot named EVE. EVE comes to realize that WALL*E has inadvertently stumbled upon the key to the planet's future, and races back to space to report her findings to the humans (who have been eagerly awaiting word that it is safe to return home). Meanwhile, WALL*E chases EVE across the galaxy and sets an adventure into motion. Joining WALL*E on his journey across the universe is a cast of characters including a pet cockroach and a heroic team of malfunctioning misfit robots.<br /><br />The first few minutes of WALL*E are a bit depressing. Earth is a vast wasteland of garbage. And when I say wasteland, I mean that in the literal sense. Humans have left Earth because of the output of garbage, waste and abuse to the environment. The year is 2775 and all that remains are skyscrapers, filth and waste. As I sat there, the six year turns to me and asks what has happened to the Earth? Why all the garbage? I honestly have no answer for him and as he turns back to look at the screen he says, garbage is very bad. Things become a bit lighter as we see WALL*E on the screen. The character of WALL*E is so very much like a child. He sees things as a child would. Even though his job is to clean up the garbage the best he can, he likes to collect things such as Rubik Cubes, light bulbs and utensils. WALL*E has such an incredible personality that shows he is not just a mindless robot. He enjoys watching an old time 1950's musical and loves the music and the dancing. He especially enjoys watching one scene over and over again where a man and woman are holding hands and sing to each other. WALL*E assumes love means holding hands; but he has no one to hold hands with.<br /><br />EVE comes down to Earth with a directive in mind. She reminded me of a mutant egg, but quickly just as WALL*E tugged at my heart, EVE will do the same with you. WALL*E welcomes her with open arms, so very happy he has another to share his toys with. He assumes she will want to stay with him and perhaps she will be the one to finally hold his hand. (The hand holding becomes very important throughout the movie) But WALL*E has in his possession what EVE is searching for. WALL*E has found a small plant growing out of all the waste and gives it to EVE. By plant life beginning to grown on Earth again after hundreds of years, that means humans can return to their home and begin a new.<br /><br />EVE is taken back to her ship and WALL*E follows her because he thinks she is in danger. EVE is sent back to a huge giant like cruise spaceship where humans live as if they are on permanent vacation. Another disturbing fact is that because robots do everything for humans, humans have become big lazy blobs who ride around in chairs as they drink fatting shakes and watching TV very oblivious to life around them. When the Captain of the ship receives the plant, it means they can return home to Earth. But his co-pilot, which is a robot and so very much like HAL from the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey has specific instructions that humans can not return to Earth. It takes over the ship's controls and tries to stop WALL*E and EVE from placing the plant in a certain part of the ship that will enable them to go back to Earth.<br /><br />So many lessons were taught and learned in this simple animated movie. It is heartbreaking to think in hundreds of years, Earth may no longer be inhabitable by living things and we would have to leave to travel in space with no meaning. WALL*E in some ways is very much like 2001: A Space Odyssey and as an adult I laughed at so many hidden jokes that came straight from the movie. But like 2001, there is hope and in WALL*E even though things look hopeless, that is not the case. Even though Earth is devastated, things can change. By the end of WALL*E my depression that I felt at the beginning of the movie became a feeling of hope. You must stay till the very end and watch the closing credits because as Peter Gabriel sings, we see through very amateur drawings how humans can make Earth so very green again because of a robot who should have no feelings or personality was able to deliver one small plant that will become the roots for a future of hope.<br /><br />Katiebabstbreaking to think in hundreds of years, Earth may no longer be inhabitable by living things and we would have to leave to travel in space with no meaning.

0385340990|5.0|I'm wondering if the authors are in cahoots with the Channel Islands tourism board, as you will definitely be dreaming of planning a trip to Guernsey after reading this delightful novel.  Particularly enjoyable for those who have an interest in all things related to WWII.  As the book is written as a series of letters, I was initially worried that I would lose track of who wrote what letter to who; but there is no need to memorize the various correspondence - for some reason the tale seamlessly spins even though it does not stick to the traditional book format. This book is comedy, romance, and history all wrapped into one.  The authors do an excellent job of bringing the characters and the island of Guernsey to life.  I hope this aunt and niece team have another novel in the works.  I would definitely purchase their next release!
159659201X|4.0|A great book.  Read this, then follow up with the BLACK SWAN.  I am more inclined to recommend this book for people who are self employed or investors. [.............]
B000ID37SQ|1.0|I wanted to see this film just to see what the big deal was about this film being called \\"The Greatest movie ever made.\\" Baloney (and that's putting it very mildly). This film is simply a waste of time & talent. 2 hours, 49 minutes of f-bombs spewed everywhere. I don't mind watching a movie with profanity & violence, but there's got to be a good storyline to go with it (the \\"Lethal Weapon\\" movies, for example) This movie was utterly a waste of my time. I ain't seeing it again. The Greatest Movie Of All Time?!!! B.S.!!! \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" is the greatest movie ever made (I grew up watching it, so naturally I'm in favour of it). I love \\"Gone With The Wind\\" & I personally think all the classics (and \\"Beauty And The Beast\\" is certainly a classic) are much better, both enrtertainment & moral-wise, than this 2 hour 49 minute p.o.s. Maybe \\"The Godfather\\" films are also better than this (at least those movies also have coherent storylines, not just a smattering of f-bombs). Rated R for non-stop strong profanity strong incessant violence throughout, and brief nudity.<br /><br />This movie is not only too long for its own good, but is excessive on the violence, profanity (over 200 uses of the f-word and several other strong profanities, both in English and Spanish) and drug use (almost every scene shows Tony snorting cocaine). Plus, there's a gratutious scene of a naked woman. I have no problem with R-rated movies, but the excesses here are just too much for me.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|A typical, entertaining Indiana Jones adventure, but without the full zing, coherence and cliffhanger story that previous ones had.
B000AMJC2K|4.0|I used this mount with a 22\\" Samsung LCD--didn't have any problems with weight / holding it place. The arm is a little difficult to setup, and the lower and raise button is not easy to use.  If you don't need to adjust your monitor position frequently this product should work fine.  If you need something with a little more flexibility go with the Ergotron LX. I'd buy this product again.
B000002KYR|4.0|This is a great album by ZZ Top. I only have one complaint when it comes to the CD version of the Eliminator album. I happen to like the LP version of \\"Legs\\" that appears on the VINYL album. Why was it changed to the single version of \\"Legs\\" for the Eliminator CD? I can't seem to find that version on CD anywhere. Can anyone help? Why can't record companies just leave albums intact just the way they are for the CD releases? Capitol/EMI did the same thing with Duran Duran's Hungry Like the Wolf; the vinyl album version is different from the version that appears on the CD of the same title. JUST LEAVE IT ALONE FOR HEAVEN SAKE!
B000WZAE0Y|5.0|This is the most awesome movie: If you are looking for a great fantasy wonder ride!  Stardust combines all traditional fantasy kingdom plots and breaks all the rules to keep you interested. Try it!
B0014NDXGA|5.0|It is awesome.  I had the old version of the smallest rengefinder on earth without pinseeker technology. I believe the tour pro.  It worked well but if there was no wind and you were quite aways from the green sometimes you could not pick up the flag.  This one, if in question, takes the distnce from the closer object.  Highly recommended.
B001DU8T6S|2.0|Most songs are unremarkable, with only Surf's up and C-lebrity being very good. Of Queen's original 15 studio albums, The Cosmos Rocks is only better than the Flash Gordon soundtrack.  Compared to the solo works of Queen's members, I rate it as below average.<br /><br />I do not regret buying it, but I am slightly disappointed
B00197POXG|4.0|I am a true fan(atic) of Dr. Quinn and was excited to see this complete set.  When I received it I was pleasantly surprised to find that the set also included the movies.  This was not clear to me from the product description provided and since the website stated that the movies were frequently ordered with the megaset I took that to mean they were not included.  So I ordered the movies separately and now will have to return them.     The series itself is worthdefinitely 5 stars.  However I gave an overall rating of 4 stars because of the packaging.  Although a very innovative way to hold all these DVDs in a compact space, it was not as sturdy as I expected and the so-called \\"faux leather\\" is more like thick brown cardboard.  The leather tie is not a tie at all since it was only attached to the front cover and not the back.  Perhaps it is broken but I didn't see anything that suggested it was ever attached to the back cover.  Despite these packaging issues I will not return the set because the main thing are the DVDs themselves and they are wonderful!  A definite must buy for the true Dr. Quinn fan.
B000000OU0|4.0|This CD was received as agreed and in good shape.  The CD is good and plays well.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|This is an excellent recording of the original cast. If you're looking for a good way to experience Wicked (from home), then you won't be disappointed.
1400063515|5.0|The book deserves attention, not necessarily for the qualities of the writer, but for introducing a biased opinion in the world that was supposed to pertain only to \\"un-opinionated\\" academics. Worth reading if you have an open mind, no matter of the direction chosen in career and life. It gives another type of perspective on improbability than the establishment.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Its got everthing: intrigue, suspense, great special effects, good acting, excellent cast, and proper character development for a 2 hour movie.  Excellent!
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Amazing start for AI 2008!  I am impressed with the quality of David's first CD and his voice, of course! I have 2 kids (10 & 4) and daily they can not have enough of this album, like me.:-) If David will continue in the same manner, his success will be maximum. For me, he is a young Bon Jovi! GO DAVID!
B00132D808|5.0|Musical brilliance for the ear, a pure listenung pleasure. This CD takes you to a world of love from the minds of genius. Beatles timeless overtones make this music unique.
B001ED7C58|5.0|This soundtrack meets all expectations! It's a must add for your music collection. Thanks to Amazon, it arrived quickly. Very happy with the purchase.
B000J6I0PM|5.0|Great DVD to watch over and over.  I was really impressed with the quality of the surround sound.  Cranked up the volume and it was amazing.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible is one of the most clever scits created.  It's funny, the songs are catchy, and the cast is top-notch.  If you don't like it, the problem is with you, not Dr. Horrible.
B001GQACGO|1.0|i rushed to get this cd after hearing if i were a boy and single ladies,but when i got the cd i was very disappointed the cd is garbage and i skipped all the way through it. i would say this is beyonces worst album this is why people steal music off the internet you go and spend all this money on the cd and its only 2 songs you like out of 15 true waist of money.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Loved the movie, enjoyed the extras (especially the director's commentary), hated the package. I'm fine with eco-friendly packaging, but someone got cute with this one, and there's a flap on the inner box that catches on the flap on the outer box/sleeve, which makes removing the inner box a toughie. Solution is to insert the inner box backwards, but it shouldn't have been necessary. At least they didn't have the evil seal on the thing (you know--the one that's meant to guarantee that the DVD or CD is factory new and is hard to get off completely).
B0010X8NF0|4.0|Wes Anderson's The Darjeeling Limited is a sardonic, dialogue-driven film about three disjointed brothers, Francis(Owen Wilson), Peter(Adrien Brody) and Jack(Jason Schwartzman) on a train ride through scenic and beautiful India. On their 'spiritual quest' to relate to each other again as more then friends, but brothers they hit many snags along the way, and ultimately they find themselves stranded in the middle of the desert.<br /><br />This film is not for everyone, the pace may drag a bit slow at times and subject matter questionable, you will find yourself loving it or hating it.<br /><br />Myself, I thoroughly enjoyed it; the change between the brothers, finding themselves, letting go of their excess baggage and enjoying the ride.
B000UOOT1W|1.0|The Santana CD is great. However, Amazon needs to do something about their shipping methods and how they handle it when there's an issue pertaining to it. I received the CD early, but the case had been completely crushed - COMPLETELY! I called Amazon right away, but they told me that they couldn't help me because that item had not yet shipped - yet I was holding it in my hand! It's such a pain to buy something, have to wait for it, receive it and it be broken and have to send it back yourself - but I couldn't even send it back because as far as Amazon was concerned, they hadn't yet shipped it.  Bad, bad Amazon!
0375826726|2.0|Despite their flaws, I enjoyed the other books in the Inheritance series. Paolini is creative while clearly paying homage to many other fantasy stories. However, this book is painfully slow and poorly written. Pages are spent, Moby-Dick style, exploring details that have no bearing on the plot. It's as if the writer did a lot of background research (on swords, for instance) and then couldn't manage to let any of it go. Similarly, he seems to want to explore the post-traumatic stress soldiers experience, but is unable to create scenes that express the characters' personal experiences realistically. Instead he dwells on the gruesome violence of battles while the after-effects on characters is all very similar and bland. The only thing that kept me reading Brisingr was the fact I'd already spent time on the other books. This one needed more editing.
6304936303|3.0|I have to admit, this is one of my guilty pleasures of \\"filmmaking.\\" Bruce Willis plays a down-on-his-luck PI (Who can do \\"down-on-his-luck\\"  better than Bruce?) who is given a surveilance job by his partner-who incidentaly is having an affair with Willis's estranged wife. His job: to protect a stripper (Halle Berry) who is the boyfriend of ex-football hero Damon Wayans. When Halle turns up dead, the plot thickens, teaming Willis and Damon up to find the killers. It turns out that the \\"Killers\\" are a powerful footbal owner who is trying to blackmail the California governor into legalizing pro-football gambling. Again this is your basic buddy-buddy action-comedy, but Willis and Damon's chemistry make it worthwhile.
B001F7MSES|5.0|I like Hellboy II.  While not as flashy as Iron Man or as brooding as the Dark Knight, it is still a fun movie.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|A masterpiece that re-connects with the creative muses present in late period Beatles' albums.  As fresh and creative as he was 22 years old.  Can't recommend enough this Cd.  Go, run, buy it!
1592401791|5.0|I've read countless Beatles stories..this one is by far the best..especially if you are a musician...
B000001ELP|4.0|I was pretty much like the rest of the KISS ARMY when I first laid ears on (MUSIC FROM) THE ELDER back in 1981. I was stunned. I was confused. I was shocked. The sounds I heard were certainly not what I expected from the band that gave the world SHOUT IT OUT LOUD, DEUCE, GOD OF THUNDER, LOVE GUN, STRUTTER, etc.    WHAT THE HELL WAS THIS???    That was then, this is now. (MUSIC FROM) THE ELDER has gotten a bad rap over the years. Even by the members of the band! Looking back, I have come to really like the album. I respect the intent, and give kudos to KISS for trying to stretch their wings and try something different. Even if it was for the wrong reasons... they did take a chance. And I respect them for that.    KISS, like so many other artists, get pigeonholed into a certain style and sound and then are expected - no, DEMANDED - to keep repeating the same style and sound over and over and over again.    This album isn't typical of KISS in any way, shape, or form. But it IS a very interesting piece of music. One that I am glad to have in my collection. Comparing (MUSIC FROM) THE ELDER to any other KISS album is like comparing a tree to a toaster. DON'T BOTHER because it's a waste of time. Completely pointless.    And even if you HATE this album you can be thankful for one thing: It isn't CRAZY NIGHTS!
B00004VXF2|5.0|Lou Reed-Metal Machine Music *****<br /><br />In short, Metal Machine Music is a sheer masterpiece. It says everything Lou Reed has ever needed to or ever wanted to say. It is power, it is fierce, it is Lou Reed.<br /><br />More Velvet Underground than any other solo album the man would ever release, and at the same time his most poetic.  Even though the album was meant to be a big piss of to his record company RCA at the time Metal Machine Music is a classic, a true blue honest to day classic.<br /><br />Proceed with caution as everything you have ever heard about this album is true.
B00000AF98|2.0|I have been a huge KISS fan for over 30 years. I was there at the beginning, and I will be there at the end (if there is one!). Even after the make-up ran its course, came off, and the band was Gene, Paul, Eric Carr, and whoever on guitar, I adjusted and accepted the evolution of my favorite band.    By 1982 KISS was on life-support. They released their only true GREAT album of the decade, CREATURES OF THE NIGHT, which was sinfully overlooked and underrated at the time. With that failure it was decided to drop the make-up and adapt to the changing trends, tastes, and styles of the decade. They came up with a trilogy of albums that varied in quality, but overall were solid start-to-finish: LICK IT UP (1983), ANIMALIZE (1984), and ASYLUM (1985). At the time I thought THIS KISS was about as far removed from the original band that they couldn't possibly get any further away.    I was WRONG!    In 1987 KISS did the unthinkable. They became POISON! A second-rate one at that. Not that there is anything wrong with POISON (you be the judge of that). But they are POISON, and KISS is KISS. Or at least I thought. CRAZY NIGHTS left me about as shallow and empty as the production quality. It was an over-polished, over-produced, slick-sounding mess! I HATED this album! I still do I guess, but time has eased the hatred - just a little.    With the exception of \\"BANG BANG YOU\\" I can't find much that even comes close to being memorable. And BBY is more amusing that anything. Certainly not \\"classic KISS.\\" I can give it 2 STARS because it has grown on me ever so slightly in the past 21 years (YIKES!)... but CRAZY NIGHTS is by far the weakest album in the bands illustrious history.    Here's looking to the NEW KISS ALBUM slated for 2009!
B001F12J48|1.0|First off, Amazon should separate the reviews for the 3-D DVD release and the standard version.  They are not the same product.  I am extremely disappointed that Robert Zemeckis allowed this so called 3-D version to ever reach the shelves.  IT IS UNWATCHABLE.  I feel like I was ripped off.  Didn't anyone do quality control?  Someone has made a lot of money ruining the trustworthy names of Tom Hanks and Robert Zemecus.  No longer can we rely on these people to provide a quality product. I am very disappointed because usually love there work.
0792844890|5.0|I didn't know about this movie till about 2001-2002 when it came out on DVD, but when I first saw it I fell in love.<br />I've seen it about 10 times already, and still laugh every time. Mel Brooks is a genuous!<br />I love the audio commentary on the DVD, and the video screen menu.<br />The acting and sound quality was great for a 1980's movie.<br />Overall awesome Parody Movie, not like any of the ones you see today, like Epic Movies and stuff like that. (This Parody is a WHOLE lot better then those).<br /><br />Haven't seen it? You need to. :)
B001C46P2A|5.0|I can hardly believe this was 3 hours long almost. I never felt like I sat there that long I was so totally enthralled with the story. They just don't make films like this anymore. I also wish more people appreciated films like this more. It was an unbelievable experience for me. I felt like I was experiencing something I had never experienced before. This was a beautifu story filled with lots of humor, adventure, romance, drama, and even some education on things I never knew anything about. The young actor who play Nullah was just amazing. His character added so much to the story. I might as well add how marvelous Hugh Jackman is in this film. This performance should really put him on the map. He is such a wonderful actor and I am glad he finally got such a great role (along with playing Wolverine). He is also perfect for this role and it sure aint bad to look at either. This was even better than I expected it would be. The cinematography was gorgeous and the story was so rich and beautiful. I was totally taken in from the get-go. It was also just plain entertaining and I would recommend this film to everyone who appreciates Western Epic period pieces. I will see it again and again.
B000000YG5|5.0|Sonny Rollins' \\"Saxophone Colossus\\" is one of those albums that you could listen to 20 times in a row and never tire of because it's just that good. I've owned this recording for a couple of years and I still return to it from time to time. Rollins' warm, round tone makes this album the masterpiece it is, but that's not to discount his group for this session: Tommy Flanagan on piano, Doug Watkins on bass, and Max Roach on drums, who provide excellent support. This is a classic for reason. Want to find out why? Pick this up today. An essential jazz recording.
0735204314|1.0|I was looking for something scientific about the subconscious mind. What I found was religious and misleading. None of the things that are said in this book were backed up with any scientific evidence.
141694737X|5.0|My toddler really likes this book.  He's at the age where flap books are his favorite and he can make animal sounds.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie! If your a muscle car lover,hot chick lover,Tarantino movie lover, you must purchase this movie! Not to give it away but the part when Stunt Man Mike Rams the chicks car and they replay it over and over.... so you can see the damage done, OMG!!! love it. I own the sound track and it's sweet \\"riding\\" music! If your a bad @ss at heart or in true life, own it! 1/19/2009 Target has this movie for $7.50
0679809015|5.0|Another toddler favorite!  This one is small enough for toddler hands so my son liked this one more than the others.  Good board book that can take abuse.
B001F0VHEM|3.0|I'm a fan of Pink and think that she is a great talent.  I bought Funhouse solely after hearing \\"So What\\" on the radio.  The album is good, but for me doesn't really live up to the quality of that song.  There are a few other good cuts, but most of the material seems a bit subdued compared to the energy of \\"So What\\" and some of the other Pink songs that have hit home (e.g. \\"Who Knew,\\" \\"Stupid Girls,\\" \\"Get The Part Started,\\" etc.).
0385340990|5.0|My book club read this book last month.  All twelve members rated it a<br />9 or 10...mostly 10's!  It was funny, sad, and heartwarming.  The letter<br />format was a little confusing at first - it was an unusual way of letting<br />the reader gather information and I made a list of the letter writers.<br />After I did this, the book read more easily for me.  I felt I really knew<br />the characters at the end of the story and hated to see the book end!
B000B7BRMM|1.0|Much has been said in the reviews on both sides of the ratings that are dead on. I can understand why the Krall fans like this CD. But I can certainly understand the reasons for the low ratings as well. Indeed, I align myself with the low ratings as you can see. Here's my take.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I am a choir director by profession. I teach secondary school and I have seven choirs: two auditioned chamber groups, an auditioned concert choir, an intermediate women's choir, a beginning men's and a beginning women's choir, and a jazz ensemble. I've been teaching for 13 years in the public sector and directing church choirs for 30.<br /><br />Of course, I'm very much into classical music, but I grew up listening to jazz, was a percussionist in high school and played the traps in jazz band. (And I love rock 'n roll, too!) And I repeat, I do have a jazz choir. My group has been to jazz festivals and adjudicated by the likes of legend Don Shelton, Phil Mattson, Jennifer Shelton Barnes, and Gene Aitkin. Also by Clockwork Orange, M-Pact, Kerry Marsh, and a host of other West Coast biggies in jazz.<br /><br />I believe that the general populace is becoming more musically illiterate and along with that, becoming unable to judge what is truly good music and what is not and what is good talent/skill and what is not. (Well, I say I \\"believe\\" but given my profession and dealing on a daily basis with developing students and their parents I *know* first hand that musical literacy is on the decline.) Take \\"American Idol\\" for example. The best skilled musicians and artists are often voted off the show, leaving the most popular (as in \\"pop\\" music) to win.<br /><br />Now, you may be calling me just another one of those \\"music snobs.\\"<br /><br />Justifiably maybe so, but I'm just a musician who started at an early age and has grown up to know and appreciate good music, good art, and good musicianship. Diana Krall's first CD's were great. But there is danger in being a \\"cross-over\\" artist. Which master do you serve? And by serving two masters, can you do well in both? (I'm talking about true cross-over, not releasing two different genres a la genius Marsalis.)<br /><br />This CD, when looking from a jazz perspective, is definitely lackluster. Jazz aside, there is no spirit or soul or excitement to the performance. My all-of-14-year-old jazz soloist prodigy even noticed this (without any prompting from me) and told me that she didn't like \\"White Christmas\\" and [Krall] sounded \\"bored.\\"<br /><br />I feel that some of her stylistic choices are somewhat contrived and doesn't feel like natural jazz. Taking \\"White Christmas\\" as example again, her attempts to swing sounds more like hiccup jerks, for lack of a precise description.<br /><br />But those who like Krall for her jazz/pop sound with sultry voice definitely likes this stuff, as apparent by the ratings. Please don't get me wrong, I'm not saying I'm better than you, just that my ear does not care for this CD from a jazz buff point of view. It is what it is and if you guys like it, that's cool by me. I know there's plenty of stuff that I like that you probably wouldn't.<br /><br />Final word on the CD cover. I think it is inappropriate in two ways. First, what in the world does it have to do with Christmas Music? Nothing. It is totally out of context. Secondly, why do some female jazz or classical artists resort to sex to sell their CD's? This raises a red flag with me. Is it because their music isn't good enough to appeal to a broader audience so they have to get sexy on their covers to sell their music? Hmn-n-n, rather suspect to me.<br /><br />Look, no matter what kind of music you do, you should do it with a passion, with real emotion, from the heart. That's what I try to teach my students. Just don't do the dots on the page. Anyone and even any computer can do the dots on the page. That merely becomes a mathematical and technical exercise. It takes a breathing, living, emotive artistic human being to MAKE GREAT MUSIC!<br /><br />In my humble opinion, I do not think that Diana Krall makes great music on this CD.eing to MAKE GREAT MUSIC!<br /><br />In my humble opinion, I do not think that Diana Krall makes great music on this CD.
B000H5U832|4.0|This was a gift for my friend's little boy. He loved it! He would not put the DVD Cover down. He really enjoyed it when he seen the movie.

031606792X|5.0|In her fourth book Stephanie Meyer continues to bring her writing  skills to higher levels using a rich variety of similes. She is a master  of making language flow.  Each of her books captivates the reader   with her gift for language and how she handles the characters emotions.  She's a gifted writer.  I've even read her adult book \\"The Host\\" and she carries her use of  language to a high level it it as well.
006112429X|1.0|I have a 50-page rule, wherein I return, give away, or otherwise dispose of any book that does not hook me in the first 50 pages. This one had a slightly redeeming scene around page 49, so I stuck around for a while longer. Time I apparently wasted. The book is written in a whiny tone that is supposed to demonstrate the main character's (read \\"author's\\") superior grasp of what life is all about.<br /><br />One of the first things I said upon reading about the birth of Kevin is \\"this woman has never given birth\\", a statement that I have later found to be true. Her portrayal of parenthood is equally unrealistic. I quit about halfway through the book, reading only the last chapter or so to find out that the premise of the book (writing letters to an estranged spouse) is false. He's dead. I guess she just forgot to mention that until the end of the book.<br /><br />I am curious what drove the main character to have a second child, but not enough to subject myself to any more of this crap. No stars. None.
0143038419|2.0|As I read this book, I could not figure out why it was so popular among the masses, and why it has spent so much time on the bestseller list.    But upon a quick internet search, I learned the reason why...it's been blessed by the hands of the almighty Oprah.    The book is o.k., but definitely nothing spectacular.  People, wake up...think for yourself, make your own decisions.  Oprah could recommend Webster's Dictionary and it would land on the bestseller's list tomorrow.  Sad.  This says so much about the state of society today.    Also sad is how many people apparently connect with this very needy writer.  Strong women can live without a man (and I'm a man)...but this author can't get them off her mind.  Be an individual for godsakes.
1596680199|5.0|excellent reference, lots of ideas.  I had checked it out at the library, and it was so good, I purchased it.  Ranges from the SHAPES of items to make in clay, to the clay COMPOSITION, like wood grain and malachite patterns.  Tons of photos, and basic, but sufficient, instructions.
B00008GKEG|5.0|More than 30 years after their demise as a band, the Beatles keep setting records. (though it was 25 years when the Anthology was released)    When the Anthology was first aired, right after, in one day 450,000 albums of Anthology 1 were sold, the most albums EVER sold in one day. (and it wasn't cheap, either) There was the audio version of the Anthology first, and each one cost...was it $30? Something like that, but they had a LOT of songs on each disc. Then the video Anthology finally came out on VHS. Then the Anthology coffee table book. Finally, the DVD version you will buy. Amazing, when you think of it. As you get into this you will see that the Beatles did this with as much class and integrity as they did everything else they ever did. A good example is the Free As A Bird video. One of the coolest videos ever, it has lots of hidden references to their songs and story. (There is also a lot of humor from the Beatles as it all unfolds)      The song \\"Free As A Bird\\" won a Grammy in 1997, and the video also won a Grammy. The Beatles thus break further ground being a band with a long deceased member who still charts in the top 10... 25 years after disbanding, and winning top awards.      \\"Real Love,\\" the single, reached #4 and #11 in the UK and US singles charts respectively and earned a gold record faster than a number of the group's other singles.     These examples illustrate in just a small way the colossal impact this 4 piece group had on music and modern culture. As Mick Jagger admitted, \\"People today can't realize just how huge and untouchable the Beatles were in the 60s.\\"(sic) He called them a \\"four headed giant.\\"    A great visual of how overwhelming their fame became is at the beginning of each episode when you see them playing real clear and well, and then they are drowned out by human screams that sound like a thousand jet engines, and then the camera fades back and the gigantic Beatles \\"drop-t\\" logo dwarfs them until they are no longer even visible within the monster they created. This is a large part of the point of their story. They considered themselves just a great little rock band that was admittedly greater than the sum of it's parts. This is that story, told by themselves.     My Dad told me that The Beatles took so much money out of the USA, that it scared the United States Government. They were very wealthy within a year or two of conquering America, and that's without the money they SHOULD have gotten from their publishing, and England had something like a 98% tax!!! That they were so rich they could lock down the world's greatest recording studio at will for indeterminate time, when studio time was HUGELY EXPENSIVE, shows what they were worth.     Other bands all over the world stood in despair every time the Beatles released a new record because each one was a dramatic and devastating departure from what they (or anyone) had done before. No one could even think of keeping up, though they tried, and that includes the Rolling Stones, who, while great, were in a very deep shadow. This became especially true by the time of Rubber Soul and onward.     The thing that the videos show and it shows in an even more astonishing way if you dig into the literature, is how hard and non-stop these young guys worked. They did all the right things, led every step of the way, and seemingly effortlessly changed everything. If you consider that they released 2 albums and 3 singles per year, on top of endless television appearances, tours and recording sessions, they rarely had a day off for years. On the outside, we don't realize that often times they would finish work on a classic album, and if not the next day, within days they were working on the NEXT classic album. And during all this incredible activity, they found time to write tons of timeless classics and create innovative recording techniques that forever changed the way records were recorded, down to this day, and with the help of their ingenius Abbey Road staff, came up with new sounds and gadgets such as flanging, artificial double tracking, using Leslie speakers for vocals, locking up several 4 track recorders in sync, etc. The list goes on. And the modern music lover should be made to understand that back in those days, you couldn't just turn on a keyboard and get endless weird sounds like you can now, if they wanted something different (and they did, for every song) they had to somehow create something new from what they had.     There is a lot more that the Anthology covers, but other reviews have gone into that in depth. My aim is to show why there even IS an anthology of 10 DVDs on a rock group. Does anyone else have a legacy or a story to match this? Nope.     Buy the Anthology, also buy the book, it's got a whole different bunch of stuff and photos that the Anthology doesn't have time to cover, it's a great set overall. Also, a major point is that you get to hear alternate versions of almost every song that is included, songs that are drilled into the brains of everyone all over the world, and it's interesting to hear the evolution of these masterpieces.     After you watch this, I'll bet you go and start a band...... D. Coyer
0240808452|5.0|For those of us who have not received formal fine art education, and have attended only a smattering of figure drawing classes (without prior theoretical instruction, making it somewhat less useful), \\"Force\\" is invaluable. Its coverage of dynamic pose and the use of line weight as a signifier finally clarifies the jargon we hear from art school grads of \\"drawing loose\\" and \\"with energy.\\"    Even for non-animators, \\"Force\\" will imbue your drawings with a sense of motion and anticipation. Figuring out the body will become an enjoyable puzzle, then second nature, and the results will speak - or, rather, move - for themselves.
0446677450|5.0|I would like to say that Rich Dad Poor Dad was a terrific book.  I dealt with the aspects of financial businesses and how they are set out in society.  It shows that with great use of the mind, one can accomplish much that he or she did not know could be capable.  This book demonstrates that through hard work in life, success comes in hand.  Overall, Kiyosaki's book in well-written and should be read by more individuals.
B000NVIXFK|4.0|This is for the Rush fan only.   If you are a Rush fan, then you must have it, because it is a very good album.  It's like a mix between Vapor Trails and Counterparts, but of course has its own sound.    The stand outs are as following:  5 stars:  Faithless, Armor & Sword, Workin' Them Angels, and Good News First  4 stars:  Far Cry, The Larger Bowl (A Pantoum), The Main Monkey Business, and The Way the Wind Blows.  3 stars: Spindrift, Hope, Bravest Face, Malignant Narcism, We Hold On.    This album has a lot of 3 star songs IMO, which kind of drags it down unlike other Rush albums, which are loaded with 4 and 5 star songs.    If you are not a Rush fan, start with Moving Pictures, 2112, Power Windows or Roll the Bones.
B00008PW2D|5.0|i completely 100% love the fifth season of sex and the city. true it is extremely short and overpriced but the 8 episodes are pure gold. A lot of the reviewers bemoaned the fact that this season suffers from a lack of laughs and is more serious and the characters feel unlike themselves. I tell those reviewers to take a closer look at the end of season 4, the journeys and behaviours of the four leads is completely truthful and relatably to real life after where we left them last. They are all burnt out, they have all had there hearts broken yet again and now they have realised that they are no longer as young as they once were and therefore feel terrified by the fact that they are still alone. I felt most for Carrie in this season, true she acts selfish towards some of friends at times in this season but she is so afraid of what will happen next after all that has happened - the breakup with Aiden and the departure of Big, that she reverts completely into herself and attempts to keep her friends static around her, as is witnessed in 'Luck be an old lady'. The other characters too experiences emotions that are unlike anything that has come before them. As Charlotte points out ot Miranda in the previous season just before Brady's birth that 'she needs to start letting people in' Miranda feels the full force of that this season when she attempts to balance both her social life with her family life and like Carrie fears what will come next. Charlotte is forced to confront the fact that her Mister Perfect fantasy of a husband was not a fantasy but turned into a nightmare, and that she must finally look elsewhere for the love and intimacy she desires so much. Samantha feels she loses a part of her identity upon opening herself to Richard and being burnt because of it, but it is only when we fall down do we stand up and learn how to be stronger as she learns in the final episode.  This season represent a bridge between the fun wild days of the first four season and the moreadult and mature world of the sixth season and movie. It also shows that to move on we must standup by ourselves and move forward into whatever murky future lies ahead because only through that do we grow as human beings.
0375826726|2.0|I think Paolini could have accomplished the same things in a book half as long. Many times the story meandered off course and didn't find it's way back for quite some pages. In fact, quite a few things seemed completely unnecessary. It was too \\"graphic\\". Much of the book is spent describing gruesome scenes of carnage. It is NOT a series for people younger than 13.<br /><br />Much of the book seemed like a game of chess for lack of a better desription. I could feel the author striving for things to make sense, trying to counter the reader's skepticism. I had a hard time believing in the magic system a few times. For example (spoiler), if Brisingr is really the true name of Eragon's new sword why can't other people control the blade if they also know the name? One person doesn't have possession of \\"rock\\". Knowing the true name of someone elses weapon would be a deadly advantage in combat.<br /><br />A lot of this criticisms could be put to rest by some simple edits here and there. Other would be more difficult to amend, but maybe those things are subjective.<br /><br />I must say that it was entertaining. Enough so that I didn't stop reading it until it was done. I needed to know how things turned out. There are many creative ideas that had me fascinated. I love the Dragons. That's the best part about this series I think. Christopher has potential. He has good ideas. But like some people have said, he lacks a good editor.<br /><br />In summary, the good things are all too often overshadowed by the flaws. Such as plot, excessive description, \\"dithering\\" politics, etc...<br /><br />I hope that the fourth book will be better, because in all truth I'm \\"attached\\" to this series and will see it to the end. For his own sake, and for the sake of his readers, I hope Paolini reads these reviews and remembers them when he writes the next book. This series could still end well!!
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I loved this movie. I do agree that Pierce Brosnan can't sing but he is such good eye candy! Of course this movie is cheesy! But it works. I'm just wondering why they left out \\"Under Attack?\\" This was one of Sophie's dreams in the live production. It's a fun, feel good movie!
B000E8QVWY|2.0|I've been listening to country music since I was a little girl and the visual portrait I have of Cash is a solemn one. He wore black as a somber statement of the state of the world. Sure, he could joke and cut up, but the picture I have of him is not goofy redneck. Phoenix's performance has been hailed as genius, but I wasn't impressed. After all, it was basically a reprisal of his character in \\"U-Turn\\" in which \\"Ring of Fire\\" plays each time he appears. This is, of course, a crowd-pleaser and I know many people LOVE it. I hated it so much that I actually walked out of Walk the Line. I understand that this isn't supposed to be a documentary and perhaps I would have enjoyed the portrayal of Cash if I hadn't already had a preconceived notion of who he was. As it stands, I find this film to be both a disappointment and an insult.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has done it again! In Outliers, he combines culture context, behavioral psychology, and the timeliness of opportunity to rationalize some of the enigma behind what creates success.  A highly engaging read and a great way to understand the apparent contradictions established by typical rags-to-riches stories and the limitations of intellectual parameters of success.
B001EL6EH2|5.0|With the new Blu-Ray versions of old classics, it may be time for Amazon to rethink how it publishes their reviews, normally one of the things I like most about their store!  When I heard Casablanca was coming out in Blu-Ray, my first thought was, \\"I wonder if Blu-Ray has anything to offer to an old Black and White film, or is it just a marketing ploy?\\"  So, I go to Amazon, look up the BLU-RAY VERSION of Casablanca, and find 536 reviews telling me that Casablanca is one of the best movies of all times.  Great! I know that! What I want to know is, does the Blu-Ray edition offer me any viewing advantages over my current DVD of this movie?  How about limiting the reviews to only those who can add something of value to the specific edition being evaluated. Otherwise, with all the new Blu-Ray versions that are going to come out, we are left with old news and nothing of value as we contemplate spending (big!)bucks to possibly replace movies we already own!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I drive to work listening to this soundtrack.<br />At night I fall asleep listening to this soundtrack.<br />I love this soundtrack.<br />I will be buying more CD's from these artist from this soundtrack.
B001FEO6PK|5.0|To be honest, I got more than I was hoping for when I bought this album. I thought I'd get more or less a collection CD of old songs, but this album has a few new ones as well!     His compositional skills have gotten more influenced by Indian music, and \\"Electric prayer for peace\\" really shows this. It's a fantastic track, and I've found myself going to sleep to that track more or less every single night for a couple of weeks now.    Rain, River of Longing (and the piano reprise later on) and Higher are also fantastic tracks. I've heard some of the other ones (like Altitudes and Air) a ton of times before, but they're also fantastic tracks.       All in all: You should buy this album. It's fantastic!:)
B0000524CY|4.0|OK, you've all seen this classic unless you've been living on Mars since 1973.  And don't bother even watching, much less purchasing any of the sequels.  But this slightly extended version attempts to add a few more minutes to elaborate on Linda Blair's central Regan teenage character before she \\"involuntarily spirals down\\" into complete possession.  After all, the primary viewer empathy should have always been on Regan and viewer association with the Chris MacNeil character.  But instead, the director spent too much footage on incidentals, like Lt. Kinderman, Burke and both Father Karras & Dyer characters.  (Nobody actually blamed Karras for sending his mom to an ole-folks home, since she was obviously a whiner anyway.)  Concentrating on Regan's own and her mother's ordeal would have been more than sufficient, allowing for a shorter 100 min. story.  However, the Exorcist is a classic due to its real-life pace and \\"audio-mix\\" (i.e., medical center thumping equip.):  Pay attention to the silent scenes that make you lean forward in your chair, instantly followed by [wham!] screaming scenes, loud machine noises and the inverse.  And no fair in adjusting your tuner's volume control.  Just keep it at the same level as the theatre viewing experience, to appreciate those numerous & genius scene transitions.

B00005LOUR|1.0|This seriously might be a representation of what hell might be like...I've never seen anything so strangely disturbing and sexually cheap in my life. Was goofball Ron Howard on LSD when he directed this fiasco. Jim Carey was obviously on some type of stimulant as usual...he was a hyperactive clown and a half. It was bad on so very many levels, from the rediculous characters and dumb video effects. Very weird and disturbing movie. I can understand how some people might think it's funny but you def. don't want your kids watching this poo. The original 30 min. cartoon is charming and offers a beautiful and hopeful message. This cow patty offers the exact opposit. The goober(s) that wrote the screenplay and especially Ron (Baldy Sour) Howard should be slapped and banned from the movies forever.
B00151HZME|5.0|I am late in reviewing this, I purchased the day of it's release.  It was one of those albums that I had to put away for a while.  I didn't put it away because it wasn't good, but because it struck a fragile chord with me.  From the moment You Appearing started, my mood completely changed.  This album is beautiful and bittersweet, just like those great memories that it does so well at conjuring.  For me, there is always a bit of sad longing in the memories of my best times.  That feeling mixed with M83's ability to always present moving pieces of music make this album very powerful to me.  This is an album of past summers, limitless hopes, growing up, and the highs and lows that come with those life experiences.  It's hopeful and tragic all at the same time.  To me it's very deep and presents many layers of beautiful music and emotion.  I recommend this album to anyone looking for something deeper than your average release.
0806930152|5.0|There's a multitude of anatomy books out there.  This is one of the very best.  Bridgeman looks at the human body like a machine with interlocking parts performing functions that contribute to the motion of the whole.  If you're seriously studying drawing, this book can only help.     There are a few classic drawing books to pick up.      Bridgman- Complete guide to Drawing from Life  Andrew Loomis- Figure Drawing for All it's Worth and Creative Illustration  Anatomy Lessons from the Great Masters  Drawing Lessons from the Great Masters  Michael Matessi- Force    Everything else is icing on the cake.
B001L51RQE|4.0|About the only thing I agree with the other reviewer (Mr. Carlin) on is the packaging...it's not great (fine, it's kind of crappy...the CD's keep falling out, it's a bit flimsy, etc.).  BUT, the music on here is top notch (Andy, Stewart and Sting are tight...great drum work as always, some interesting arrangements, nice vocals from Sting, good guitar work...on this CD/DVD set they sound as good as they did in the 80's).  A nice mix of hits and album cuts (of course everyone will have some objections...I wish they would have done Canary in a Coalmine, Bombs Away, Sally, the Bed's Too Big without You, etc.)...\\"So Lonely\\" is great on here, I LOVE the reworking of Synchronicity II, even King of Pain has a nice new arrangement that reimagines the song.  I am definitely glad I picked this up...I didn't get to see them on tour (too expensive) so this will have to do! Love the Police!
0743277708|5.0|I recently re-read this book since my son has to read it for English class. Even though I knew the entire plot, I still couldn't put it down. It was just as fresh and exciting the second time around. The characters are so marvellous you can't help but want them to succeed. I remember that when I read it the first time, I told my mom that I would never be able to look at rabbits the same way again. She told me that the book was really about people. But now, after re-reading the book, I have to disagree. People aren't as likeable as these rabbits. They actually learn from their mistakes.

B000SSS05Q|4.0|...never ceases to amaze me.<br /><br />This is one of the earlier, jazzier album and an excellent one at that.<br /><br />Also, this is the vinyl version of this wonderful album, and if you have never listen to Tom Waits on vinyl, you are missing out.<br /><br />Tom Waits fans must check this out.  If you are not a Tom Waits fan though, you can probably save your money, or buy it and you will become a Tom Waits fan.
0316017922|5.0|I just finished Outliers.  I have read other books, Tipping Point and Blink.  No doubt that he has been wildly successful, and I think some critics have felt that the public should be warned off that what he says is not necessarily fully supported or correct.  Actually, I think the writing is so good, that critics are concerned that members of the public will be unduly influenced by that alone.  I understand the criticisms of Gladwell for being glib, under-researched/anecdotal, unoriginal, obvious, cursory, conclusory.  Also, he does tend to wander from his basic premises into other areas that have little to do with them.  Many probably do take what he says too uncritically.     Nevertheless, I think he is actually underrated.  Sure is he often pulling together some rather common and obvious points, but could many say that others would have extracted as much from this information as he does, or could present it convincingly?  Very thought-provoking stuff, extremely well-written.  I would not swallow any of this stuff whole, but I think there is a tremendous amount of truth set out by Gladwell that is not generally recognized.  Also, I think that Gladwell deserves no small credit for writing about advantages and disadvantages of various human cultures--and I think there are invariably both in every culture--that I am sure other authors are afraid to come near.  Perhaps his African background helps here.  Anyway, I think this is very intelligent, provocative, and informative writing.  One does not have to agree with him to get a lot of of it.  I think we are fortunate to have him, and for his writing to be as popular as it is.
B001GQ2TGA|4.0|This is a great album for the holidays: some classic Christmas tracks interpreted by Enya in her own Celtic way. So, except for the track with the electric guitar solo (can't luckily seem to find it again), this also happens to be pretty much your typical Enya album.<br /><br />If you are seeking for an innovative Enya work, forget about it. As you can imagine from the album name, \\"And Winter Came\\" is definitely a nice track set to go along a cold winter night...
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|My tittle says all... This is review for the reviews, looking for \\"depth and substances in a movie? Don't watch this movie genre, Monster's ball, Forrest Gump, Gone with the wind.. etc etc are better choices, most of the less starred reviews have almost a page, it could be a novel, why waste so many words for something that was meant to be just for fun & relax, no wonder it's so many stressed people in the world. Just enjoy it and nothing more

NO this film was not like the first, but I liked it.    I buy a lot of movies since I am old and can't do much else... So for all those who did not care for this film, it is just another Indy film with an older star.    John Bolton....Ga
1904633277|4.0|I bought this perennial favorite to add to my barely-started collection of these tiny Collector's Library books (sadly, B&N discontinued publication of these). I love that it's small and hardcover- perfect for traveling- especially for long hours on the plane or whatnot.   I was a bit disappointed to find that this book contains only part I of Little Women, ending with Chapter 23 (\\"Aunt March Settles the Question\\"). It does not have Good Wives (aka part 2 of Little Women). Luckily, I have what I call my \\"home copy\\" of the book which has both parts...so I don't feel like I've made a mistake in purchasing this one. But I thought I'd let you know this book only features part I so that you know what to expect!
B0002Y4TTC|4.0|It's Blind Guardian, I love Blind-Guardian, so I am kinda biased, but the picture is good, the sound is kinda odd.  When I play it on 5.1 surround it doesn't sound very clean, like the center speaker is kinda turned down, the vocals are a little quiet.  I've been to see B.G. before, and the DVD doesn't do them justice, it isn't horrible, but the sound quality was definitely not the greatest.     It is still a cool DVD, I just wish whoever mastered the sound would have done a better job.
B001H5X7I4|1.0|We expected the best from a movie with Ben Stiller, Jack Black and Robert Downey Jr starring in it.  We love Ben Stiller movies and we love movies with Jack Black - until this one.  When I read the reviews, I was sure this was a winner of a comedy.  From the head spurting blood to the head on the end of Ben Stiller's bayonet, we did not find one laugh.  There were a number of times that I had to turn away from the movie, retching.  When Ben Stiller tasted the goo from the head to prove it was sugar water, we turned the DVD off.  This movie is NOT for squeamish folks.  If anyone has the time, I would love someone tell me what parts are funny.  Ben and Jack, shame on you for mistaking gore for humor.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|I purchased expedited shipping, which I think reduces the wear and tear on the package while it's on its way to you.  (The faster the shipping you buy, the less the box will be thrown around by the post office.)  After reading all the reviews here, I had super glue in hand, waiting to put the box set back together again after I opened it.  To my great surprise, it was in perfect condition.  No broken trays and no broken casing.  I am so grateful.<br /><br />The box set is a little tacky looking.  I'm not sure why they decided on green packaging.  Green is the last color I think of when I think of ST:TNG.  The three books of plastic trays is a bit awkward, but at least they're not cardboard sleeves.  I wish they would have packaged it like \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\".  For my money, that type of packaging is the best way to sell a complete series box set.  And yes, a booklet listing all the episodes would have been very nice.  Even still, I am glad to have all the seasons in one shelf-efficient box, with the exclusive bonus disc, and at a price slightly less than what I would have paid for each season individually.<br /><br />Can't wait to watch some of my favorite episodes again:  \\"The Naked Now\\", \\"The Measure of a Man\\", \\"Q Who?\\", \\"The Best of Both Worlds\\", \\"Yesterday's Enterprise\\"...<br /><br />A little TNG always lifts my spirits after a nasty day at work.
B001C46P2A|5.0|The little boy of mixed race saves the film and should win an academy award for his portral.  The movie is a little long, but you are on the edge of your seat during many sceens including the first cattle drive.  The little boy's grandfather is also a star of the film both in makeup and in actions.  There were plenty of tears, laughter, fright, and some of the most fantastic scenery I have ever seen.  It's fit for all ages and tells a beautiful love story underneath the underlying \\"fight for power\\" by a power-hungry, lying, murdering, cheat of a man.  You will not be disappointed, but don't go to the bathroom or on a smoking break.
0670020745|5.0|People have been telling me to read this for months.  I needed something for the plane so I finally got it.

B000001GS3|5.0|Macbeth might not be Verdi's strongest piece, and sometimes sections rather jaunty music (ballet sequence) is bizarrely out of character with what is probably one of the darkest and unsettling plays ever written. Still, it is a remarkable work, and Abbado makes what is probably the best possible case for it. The sound is detailed and close.    But, of course, the success or failure depends on the singers, and I am happy to report that this DG version is very well cast. Cappuccilli has a very well-focused tone and his portrayal presents a haunting, anguished picture of Macbeth, and Verrett's Lady Macbeth provides a evocatively terrifying portrayal of Lady Macbeth to match (the important act 1 duet is - fortunately - a highlight of the set). The rest of the caset is fine as well - Ghiaurov as Banquo and Domingo as Macduff should, perhaps not unexpectedly, be singled out for praise.    This is, all in all, an easy recommendable (the Taddei/Nilsson recording with Schippers conducting is presumably the toughest competitor - Taddei and Nilsson might outperform Cappuccilli/Verrett, though actually not by a huge distance, but the rest of the cast, and especially the conducting, is generally superior on the Abbado set (admittedly: as far as I remember - it's been some time since I heard the Schippers set and since I don't actually own it, I am unable to make a direct comparison)).
B0018RBN8C|4.0|I really hate to compare Duffy to Amy Winehouse, because there really are differences between the two. I think we get caught up in the era that their music reflects, but after listening to Duffy's entire cd, I heard a different take on soul without some of the grit of A Winehouse. Duffy provides a great collection of songs, without the overkill, and I enjoy each one. I am still troubled by the fact that American artist aren't putting out the most creative material with great lyrics, like these British artist...no offense to \\"B\\", but she's older and married with a top song called \\"Single Ladies\\", while these artist like Adele are coming out with great lyrics.     My favorite selections are \\"Hanging On to Long\\" and \\"Stepping Stone\\". I would give those songs 5 stars, however, all of the others would get 4 stars, depending on my mood! I would definitely recommend Duffy to those looking for a nice CD to relax to.
0425210480|2.0|Anarchists want to use experimental technology to cause a shift in the Earth's North and South poles, and it's up to Kurt Austin and NUMA to save the day.

031606792X|5.0|I'm a 31year old mother of 3 (triplets), so I may not be the standard 'teenager' these books are assumed to target. But Breaking Dawn the conclusion to the series definitely delivers. (mind you my favorite genre is Sci-Fi and I just LOVE a great romantic plot, and I'm a sucker for happy ending). Breaking Dawn to me seemed more mature, more complex, though I have to say some parts were entirely predictable. I liked Breaking Dawn better than the other books in the end. (though Twilight was probably the next runner up).    In Twilight you have the 'heat', of a new relationship. Dizzy headspins over sweet kisses, full on infatuation. It tugs you right along with it.    In New Moon the relationship is challenged, neither sure how much really the other loves them. Heartbreat rings out and you suffer, only later to be pulled out of the flames. Here the relationship is tested.    In Eclipse it's well established that Bella and Edward adore eachother, though Bella is torn by her love also of Jacob. She hurts those she loves, and struggles to make her choices.    Breaking Dawn brings their relationship to maturity. You see more of the sweet, loving, passion, tempered, knowing they can depend on eachother FOREVER love. Knowing your love is knit and will last just like a marriage should be. Edward fearing for Bella's life, haggard, destroying himself by seeing Bella slowly fade away is absolutely moving, her loving sacrifice, his adoration and deep love it shook me to my core. It stands in sharp contrast to happier times.. you see love from all angles.    Sure, there's a 'clean/neat' resolution to the problem that begins in the beginning of the book, before we move onto new problems. Now that Bella and Edward's relationship is knit. And Bella FINALLY seems to have everything she ever wanted. A horrible opponent threatens to take it all away. Not just after her this time, but intent on destroying everything she holds dear. The relationship of all of the Cullen family becomes closer, you see the tenderness, you care so deeply for all of them and you feel pain at the thought of loosing any of them.     (NOT to mention Bella isn't the only perspective from which this story is told.. and it is SOOO SOO FREAKING cool .. to experience the vampire mythos from the eyes of someone exploring a new life for the first time, it really opens up so much more.. you see everything at first from the human perspective then you can see through a vampires eyes.. a werewolf's eyes, and you see Bella through other's eyes too).    Here's a little clippet:  \\"It was not going to be the end of the world. Just the end of the Cullens. The end of Edward the end of me. \\"    \\"I prefered it that way - the last part anyway. I would not live without Edward again; if he was leaving this world, then I would be right behind him.\\"
B000002UVX|5.0|\\"...Happy New Year, first of all. I hope we have a million or two million more of them.\\"<br /><br />Recorded live at the Fillmore East on December 31, 1969, [[ASIN:B000002UVX Band Of Gypsys]] (1970) was the last album that Jimi Hendrix personally authorized to be released before he died on September 18, 1970. The Band Of Gypsys was a new group put together by Jimi after he dissolved The Jimi Hendrix Experience. It consisted of Hendrix, Electric Flag drummer/vocalist Buddy Miles and bassist Billy Cox (Jimi's old Army buddy).<br /><br />\\"...I'd like to dedicate this one to, uh, to the draggin' scene that's going on. All the soldiers that are fighting in Chicago and Milwaukee and New York. Oh, yes... and all the soldiers that are fighting in Vietnam. I'd like to do a thing called Machine Gun.\\"<br /><br />If for no other reason at all, get [[ASIN:B000002UVX Band Of Gypsys]] for Machine Gun, an awesome twelve-minute guitar screaming electric storm that protests the violence in America and Vietnam during the 1960s. The song is really the main reason this album is getting a five-star rating from me. It features rapid-fire drumming and siren-wailing guitar feedback sound effects, and is quite possibly the greatest rock guitar recording ever made. Jimi cries out in pain from the perspective of a soldier being hit with machine gun fire.<br /><br />Machine gun<br />Tearing my body all apart<br />Machine gun<br />Tearing my family apart<br /><br />The rest of the album features then-new Hendrix material and two Buddy Miles songs (Changes, We Gotta Live Together). The atmosphere is 1969/70 in-the-streets-hip, socially aware and informally intimate. The opener, a laid-back and funky Who Knows, sounds a lot like a loose jam session with Jimi and Buddy trading lead vocals, and Jimi adding some nice effects-pedal guitar work. The soulful Power To Love and Message To Love highlight the fact that Hendrix was moving into a more thoughtful, and less flamboyant, direction with his music.<br /><br />I said find yourself first<br />And then your talent<br />Work hard in your mind<br />So you can come alive<br /><br />Jimi's guitar playing here is fantastic as always, and especially because most of the songs were new material at the time, [[ASIN:B000002UVX Band Of Gypsys]] is essential to any Jimi Hendrix collection. I wouldn't start my Hendrix collection with this one, but don't leave it out, either. There are some classic Hendrix moments here.Work hard in your mind  So you can come alive    Jimi's guitar playing here is fantastic as always, and especially because most of the songs were new material at the time, [[ASIN:B000002UVX Band Of Gypsys]] is essential to any Jimi Hendrix collection.

B000002UAU|5.0|Frankly, the album has obviously secured itself the \\"classic\\" title. Honestly, how could it not? While many feel it to be over-rated and pretentious, the impact it had on pop-culture, and the impact it continues to have, is simply massive. It is a fair assumption that there will never be another band like the Beatles, and by extension another album like Sgt. Pepper. While this is rather sad, it's also for the best. Anyone who loves the album shouldn't have a problem with this fact, as they can simply put on Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band; thirty-nine minutes of music that changed the world.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I am a huge fan of Pink.  Her music is the kind that I never get tired of and this CD did not let me down.  Sober & Mean are my favorite songs from this album.  I think her last album, I'm Not Dead, is a little better but it might just be because I've listed to it so many times.
0618680004|5.0|Great info, presented in a easy to read style.  Purchased for my mom.  She LOVED it.
B0014Z4P6U|1.0|It really deserves less than one star.  Ms Moore does not appear long enough to be honestly listed as staring in this movie.
B00005JKLZ|2.0|There's not much I can say that others have not.  It seems H.G.Wells is no longer taken seriously in cinema. In my opinion, Dr. Moreau was horrible, as was this movie. The only Wells movie I've found enjoyable is The War of The Worlds.  Ths movie starts out great. I began to think, oh, how sweet, it's going to be a nice love story, but no, it starts that way, then he basically says 'forget it, let's doing something else with this thing.'<br />He then travels 800000 years in to the future, and that my friends, is where it goes not just down hill, but to the very bottom of the ocean. From then on it seems like one of the cheap movies you would find on the SciFi channel that a person would only watch to LAUGH at.<br />Spare yourselves unless you enjoy horrible, cheap remakes, of something that mixes Xena, Beastmaster, and planet of the apes, to become one horrible blended barfbag.
B001EO2UKO|5.0|Dido is a great singer from the UK. I have just recently purchased this album and have listened to it just a few times, but I love it. Usually I purchase select songs on itunes for my ipod, but this album must be purchased as a whole, because the whole album is great. It is great the whole way through. It has paper cover, similar to the new Sarah Mclachlan CD. Never want to say it's love is a great track, as well as Don't believe in love.
B001F12J48|1.0|My son saw that this was in 3D and I thought \\"cool.\\" Not cool. We tried watching it with the 3D glasses it came with. It was horrible, not clear, lots of \\"double\\" vision going on. The same day I purchased some other 3D glasses that had good reviews and were not made of paper or scratched.    Here we are watching it in the new glasses...still no go. Still have double vision and an unclear awful picture. Watch the regular version and turn up the sound. It's a better experience.
B001EO2UKO|1.0|I agree with '  R. Spradley \\"RS\\"' completely.  this album is just boring.  It lacks the Dido 'Hook'.  Nothing sticks out here.  Cant believe it took nine years for this.  Come on Dido, you know how to right a hook, we KNOW you do. :)
0743497465|5.0|I gave this as a gift to my son in the military because he likes Dan Brown's writing and stories.
0525478183|4.0|After hearing a lot of good things about this book, I decided to head down the library and pick it up. I thought Paper Towns was an interesting read. It didn't keep me glued to the book the entire time, but it was an interesting story that made you think.<br /><br />The story revolves around Quentin, a high school senior, who mostly hangs out with his friends playing video games. One night, his friend, Margo Roth Spielman, a girl he has had a crush on for years, takes him on a journey that changes his life forever. The next morning, Margo is no where to found. Quentin sets out to find her using the cryptic clues she's left behind.<br /><br />Like I said, this book isn't riveting material, but it is good for a nice afternoon read.

0316017922|3.0|Outliers is a fun, quick read. One has to admire an author who attempts to knit together stories and data about Canadian junior hockey, Korean plane crashes, Appalachian feuds, Jewish lawyers, innovative schools, and rice farming--along with Bill Gates, the Beatles, and J. Robert Oppenheimer.    However, Gladwell's thesis -- that success can be explained from an analysis of these people, institutions, and events -- does not hold up. One cannot object to his view that \\"when and where you were born, what your parents did for a living, and what the circumstances of your upbringing were all make a significant difference in how well you do in the world.\\"  Of course -- and yet many are fortunate in all these areas but do not achieve an \\"outlier\\" level of success, even if they work awfully hard at it and come from a supportive cultural milieu.    Outliers, and the success they achieve, remain to be pondered by novelists and historians, not explained by social scientists.
B000002UAI|3.0|This is an early Beattles' work.  Their song writing skills was not fully evolved as their later work.  Still you can hear glimpse of enthusiasm in their songs.
B0013ND30M|5.0|For those who are not aware, there were very few movies (about 30) that were created on 70mm. The contrast and picture quality is stunning. Lawrence of Arabia is one of them. Problem is, VERY vew theaters are capable of playing 70mm and because of so few movies it isn't easy to arrange. But the scope and depth of picture quality outdid anything until digital came into picture.<br /><br />For Disney to have mastered this from 70mm is stunning and the making of featurette is impressive. Gave me a new perspective on the film.<br /><br />Worth buying this Christmas!
B001ED7C58|2.0|I really expected a lot more from a soundtrack to a movie that presents itself as a modern day romeo and juliet love story. The music is so bland and completely void of any passion and emotion that it culminates into mere background noise. Even the remix of the Linking Park song sounds soft and bland. The one exception is the lead track by Paramore. Otherwise, it's just a whole CD of BLAH!! The perfect example of a soundtrack for a movie about star-crossed lovers, filled with passion/anger/love/torture/vulnerabilty/etc is 1996's soundtrack to Romeo & Juliet directed by Baz Luhrmann. Let's hope they get a clue for the following series of Bella and Edwards flicks.
0385340990|5.0|Loved the book.  It started out a little slow, but soon I was enthralled with the characters of Guernsey Island.  While it isn't a true story, you almost feel it is because of the history of the island and the Nazi occupation.  The people are charming and the story is captivating.  I've purchased several more books to give for Christmas gifts.
B00133KFGW|5.0|I have a daughter who is a music teacher and has had underpriviledged children in her care. I thought this movie was excellent for all ages. Also, I am a mentor for teenage moms and what a responsibility. Life is so precious, especially our young ones. Although this story is of different background thna I relate to previously, it is truly a heartwarming and lovely movie of courage and love.
B0001ZXM54|4.0|If you're looking for a career-spanning intro to ZZ Top, this is a good place to start.  For the casual fan, 1992's one disc \\"Greatest Hits\\" package will probably fit your needs better since it's much more \\"hits\\" oriented than this two disc set.    As for the perennial \\"new\\" ZZ Top vs. \\"old\\" ZZ Top...I don't really think the divide is that wide.  I do prefer the older stuff; it was much less \\"commercial\\" (as subjective as that term is), much blusier and, frankly, Billy Gibbon's voice simply can't compare to Dusty Hill's (which is not to dis Gibbon's pipes so much as to pay tribute to Hill's).      The writing of the New Stuff is also often simpler, sometimes much simpler: Hill's bass often thrumming one note for bar after bar after bar, only to change to another note (just take a look at the tablature (sp) for some of the Newer Stuff), light years behind the rollicking bass-lines of old.      The trio's playing is always tight, but there's a certain sense of complacency, often giving me the feeling that the recordings were being phoned in.  But songs like \\"Legs\\" and \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\" capture much of the older magic of majestic Texas Boogie classics such as \\"I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide\\" (not infrequently heard as bumper music on Rush Limbaugh's show), \\"La Grange\\" and \\"A Fool for Your Stalkings\\" & \\"Arrested for Driving While Blind.\\"    Finally, ZZ Top is that rarest of music phenomena, a band that creates its own genre and then does it so well that no one else even tries to move in.  I suppose the argument could be made that they are part of the larger \\"southern rock\\" genre, but it's not one I agree with.  This trio is unique and if age and success have dulled their edge (and what band in their fourth decade doesn't have to fight those creeping tendencies?), nothing can take away the achievements of these masterful Texans.
031606792X|1.0|Here are my impressions of this sad, sad \\"book\\":    1.  Edward & Bella's relationship - This was the biggest disappointment in the book.  All romance completely and utterly vanished.  This book pretty much ruined their romance for me.     2.  Different tone - The book had a completely different tone from the previous three.  It didn't even feel like the same author/series.  What replaced the exhilarating, somewhat innocent romance was disgusting and disturbing (i.e. the pregnancy, birth, transformation, imprinting on Renesme, etc.)  I found myself literally gagging at some parts.  Don't know how they'll make THIS one into a movie!  Actually, a movie could be a good thing.  The writer could completely change every dumb thing that Meyer did and fix the story!    3.  Inconsistent Characters - This is kind of like #2.  None of the characters (with the exception of Jacob) were anything like their former, lively, loveable selves.  They were mere shadows of what they'd been in the past.   I could go on and on on this one, but it would take too long to go through every character.  I'll get to a couple of the main ones.    4.  Edward -  He was a mopey, brooding non-factor for 95% of the book completely devoid of charisma, charm, and personality.  At one particularly low moment, he even suggests that Bella can fornicate with JACOB just so she can have babies!!!!!!!!  WHAT?!?!?!   I had less love for Edward after this book for sure.    5.  The Wedding - My wedding was better than Bella's, and she had endless money, vampire talents, and a writer's imagination and creativity to work with!     6.  The Sex - OK, so it's a young adult book (although I don't really think a lot of the material IS suitable for young adults in this one)... I get the whole \\"fade to black\\" thing.  But, afterward, did Bella really have to turn into a whiney, sniveling twit, begging for it????    7.  Disappearance of the Cullens - They were barely in this book at all, except for Rosalie's disturbing, overbearing protection of Bella's stomach.  I don't think Esme had one sentence to say the whole time.  I couldn't believe how little Alice was involved in the book.  She was one of the best characters in the other three.  How could Meyer just abandon her?  And the whole thing where she leaves Bella a \\"clue\\" about her disappearance in a book... Gimme a break.     8.  Pregnancy - Really dumb plot line.  I can't even believe she went there.  Not only is it gross, but pretty implausible considering he's a VAMPIRE.  Do they have super-sperm now, too?    9.  Renesme Carlie -  Need I say more?    10.  Jacob The Pedophile - I don't care how she \\"cleverly\\" set this up by making Quil imprint on a little kid and trying to explain that away.  It is still really disturbing and dumb... and, oh, a little too convenient that he imprinted on Renesme.  He was the only character whose \\"voice\\" didn't change, which was nice, but I really am offended at the way Meyer resolved his character.  He deserved way more after the way Bella figuratively kicked the crap out of him for two books.    11.  Bella's Anticlimactic Transformation - For three books we've been told how painful, how awful the transformation is.  We were told how difficult it is to be a newborn vampire, and how a person loses himself/herself for a while.  Now, granted that Meyer unsubtlely set Bella up to practically not be a human in the first place, since she obviously didn't fit in with humanity for many reasons, but still... it was all so easy!  The pain was barely mentioned, and practically from the first second she \\"woke up,\\" she was THE perfect \\"vegetarian\\" vampire.  Not even a struggle!  What a joke!    12.  Charlie - I don't even know where to start with this one.  He's perfectly fine with the existence of werewolves and the knowledge that his daughter is obviously not the same as she was AND that he has a granddaughter already who ages at an insane rate........ as long as you don't give him any details.  Ignorance is bliss, I guess.  So convenient that he can still be in Bella's life now.    13.  Renee - I guess Bella didn't need to freak out about what her mother would think about getting married as a teenager.  Oh yeah, did I mention that Bella got married as a teenager?  I thought we were in Washington, not the deep South.    14.  New Cast of Characters - Some of the \\"vampire army\\" that assembled at the Cullen house was interesting.  But there were so many of them!  Meyer just kept piling them on.  They ended up not even being necessary and just watered-down the plot.    15.  The Non-Battle w/the Volturi - The battle was getting a little tense until the Volturi completely backed down like a bunch of...   kitty cats.  These Volturi don't seem so scary to me anymore.  After all, they didn't kill Edward, Bella, and Alice in Volterra (without much of a struggle or argument at all, mind you) and they took their sweet time to check out the Seattle vampires in Eclipse.  Really, it just seemed like all you had to do was \\"wink, wink\\" at Aro, and he'd let you slide.    16.  Bella the Non-Heroine - This one has two parts:    A) It would have been a little more redeeming if Bella had saved them all with her shield.  At least then she would have some point in the book.  But she didn't!  It was Alice who rushes in from who-knows-where with some ridiculous explanation about finding other vamps like Renesme who saves the day.  Really convenient that Meyer made up these new beings at the precise moment that she needed them.  Let's write a book and just make crap up from out of the blue AT the climax to save all our characters.  No one important died, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but would add depth/credibility to the overall struggle in the book.    B)   Bella doesn't have to sacrifice anything.  In the end, she gets everything she wants, all tied up with a neat little bow.  She doesn't have to give up being a mother to be with Edward (which was a big deal in Eclipse).  She suddenly wants to be married, go to college, have kids, etc.  She doesn't have to give up her soul, because apparently no one really cared about that anymore or mentioned it much in the book.  She doesn't have to give up Charlie.  She doesn't give two thoughts about what she'll do about Renee, so I guess she doesn't care.  She doesn't have to hurt Jacob anymore because he magically doesn't love her.  She doesn't have to struggle with Edward over the notion of her becoming a vampire... he doesn't have a choice in the matter--she'll die if she doesn't become one.  She doesn't have to go through any pain, suffering, or uncertainty when she becomes a newborn vampire.   She doesn't have to worry about the Volturi.  Bella had so much potential to be a great character.  Meyer just completely blew it.    17.  The Werewolves Aren't Werewolves - Oh yeah, did we forget to mention that they're actually NOT werewolves?  They're actually shapeshifters, so, yeah... no problem.    18.  The Writing Blows - In Meyer's defense, it always did.  There are a myriad of technical reasons I could get into about why Meyer is a terrible writer, but they're really moot at this point.  This book lacked what the other three did to make up for it: wit, interesting characters, love, and charm.     Some people are annoyed by the way Bella gets married and has a kid young and that the ending is happy.  There are also a lot of sexist notions in the book, but I won't go into that here, and I'm usually not bothered by that kind of thing in general.  I don't really mind the ending either, I just wished some of the above had been different.  Thank goodness for the movie... It got me back into the series.  But I'll probably never read Breaking Dawn again.  I'll just pretend it ended with Eclipse and imagine my own ending.  It's sure as sh** better than what Meyer came up with!  What a cash cow!  She should be ashamed!    On a side note, there is another book called Midnight Sun, that retells Twilight from Edward'spoint of view.  She wrote about 250 pages of it and then it somehow got leaked on the internet.  She says she's so heartbroken and destroyed over it that she won't finish it or publish it now.  I think that's B.S.  I think she's so sick over how bad Breaking Dawn is and how so many people slam it and hate it and how she ruined the series, that she's chicken to finish Midnight Sun.  Cop-out.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|I'm going to be honest. I had heard of John Legend years ago, when he first came out with \\"Ordinary People\\". I liked the song, but never was really intersted in him at the time. I then saw him in a concert special on t.v., and could not BELIEVE how AWESOME this guy was! EVERY SINGLE song he sang was the BOMB, I sat there with my mouth open and eyes bugging out of my head, I could not believe I slept on this man.  Well, next day I bought his first CD. and now this one, and I have to say that WOW, this man can write! I am not disappointed at ALL! You definitely get your moneys worth, not one good song and the rest fillers. I am recommending this CD HIGHLY, you will see what I mean when you buy it!
0765348276|5.0|The author creates great characters that evoke Heinlein's classic heros, but he does the old master one better. The action is even faster paced and the twists and turns in the plot are fantastic.     Imagine an army of grandfathers and grandmothers? Crazy? Not in Scalzi's hands. They manage to save the human race from not one race of space aliens but many. A great read. I could not put it down!    Buy and read it today!
B001GAOY5U|3.0|This movie can be best described as roller coaster action - meaning, the movie goes from one action sequence to the next, with a very shallow story in between that serves mostly as a way for the movie to move from action piece to action piece.    With that said, I liked the movie.  It was mindless fun that kept me entertained.  I'm not the biggest fan of Brendan Fraser (sp?), but he does a decent enough job here - he is at his usual slap-stick comedy routine, but that helps lighten the mood of the movie.  Even the kid actor did a good job (I remember him from Bridge to Terebitia (sp?), so I was hoping he would do just as well in this movie).      As to the BD itself - the movie has a pretty clean transfer, which helps make the 3D version of the movie look even better.  I must admit, even though I felt a bit silly sitting there with those 3d glasses, the 3d wasn't bad at all; too bad it causes the colors to be crap, but otherwise, it was well done.
B0012Q732O|1.0|I am a fan of the science fiction genre but there is no amount of lipstick you could put on this pig to make it palatable.  This is a truly terrible movie.
B001CZVVVE|4.0|For those of us who like a recorded concert, this is a beautiful recording, the singers well known, the music well known to all and the images in perfect resolution. It is very enjoyable. Only one problem: a concert in Berlin in 2006 (both with Marco Armiliato as Conductor)was also released this year by Deutsche Gramophone in Bluray and the program of this Disc has many of the same repertoire as the Berlin one. Even the Traviata's Brindisi with the glasses of champagne at the end of the program is the same. I have nothing against repeating a repertoire, in particular a successful one, when concerts are given in different cities, but when recordings are sold worldwide; the repetition diminishes the impact of it. The operatic repertoire is vast enough to choose from.
B001F2W4Y2|5.0|Since I first heard them at age 15, I have been a lifelong fan of this band.  While I cannot say that I have loved all their albums, they always have at least a gem or two on each.  Having said that though, every so often they put together a killer album and it looks to me like Black Ice is this decade's killer AC/DC album.<br /><br />I am most impressed with the new ground that is broken on this album.  Don't get me wrong, AC/DC music is always more similar than it is different and I consider that a good thing.  On this album, we hear Angus playing a ballsy blues slide guitar lick on Stormy May Day that is just killer.  Also, the song Anything Goes is probably the most<br />lighthearted, toe tapping radio tune the band has put out since the early Bon Scott days. I also like the darkly compelling War Machine a lot, because it fits Brian Johnson's voice so well.<br /><br />As for the musicianship of this album, the band is as tight as ever.  Angus and Malcolm lay down a perfect wall of guitar sounds, and Cliff Williams finally shows his skill as a bass player beyond machine-like riffs.  Brian Johnson's voice is becoming ever more unintelligible, but in this album it really works.<br /><br />Overall an outstanding album from a seminal band.  Highly recommended!
0670020745|2.0|The writing in this book is very basic, even primitive.  The story behind it is important and I heard the author interview on the radio and found that exciting.  As written, the salient messages would have made a good essay but there is insufficient substance here for a book. I was happy for the author who is reporting her success and certain insights but the book itself was a disappointment.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Ok I have no intellectual words to describe this CD....EXCEPT IT ROCKS!!!  \\"Rocks\\" meaning that this album brings you to a musical wonderland.  I got lost in it and I didn't want to be found man!!!  Once again, Sir Paul, THANK YOU!!!!!!  Whatever you and Youth did in your little music room....it freakin worked!  I would say...Heck yes!...buy this CD!! WOO HOO!!!!
B001CZVVXW|5.0|The re-instated spoken dialogues are a great addition to the drama unfolding on stage. Kaufman is a great Don Jose. Don Jose's transformation from a serene and controlled soldier to a passionate lover and ultimately to the killer of the source of his almost delirium is dynamically portrayed by Kaufman acting and singing. A real treat. Antonacci as Carmen, that free spirited gypsy that not even in love was willing to give her freedom, captivates you from the start and doesn't let it go through the whole opera.<br />The cast and the production succeed in creating a great drama which the beautiful music is part of. If only the noise created by the cast entering and leaving the stage could be avoided or suppressed.<br />A great production that Bluray resolution makes it wonderful. Highly recommended for all, first timers as well as well versed in Carmen productions.
B001FSDOZO|4.0|Basically I really like this album. It is a typical Nickelback album, it has your anti-junkie song, stripper song and a few sex songs. The thing about it though, is that the driving music keeps you into every song. I'm sure there are, at least, six top ten singles here. I just hope they will continue to hold my interest with the same formula. All in all a good album.
031606792X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  I am a sucker for happy endings and Stephenie Meyer delivered just that.  She tied up loose ends and gave everyone a happily ever after.  I wouldn't have wanted anything less with such beloved characters.  The story moved at a quick pace and kept me hooked until the last punctuation mark.  Well done!!
B00005JPLW|5.0|Gorgoeous cinematography! Wonderful story line of strength & courage! And came right on time as promised. LOVE THAT~!
B001ACH4DS|4.0|David if you are reading this where is all the wonderful music from the Idol show?  All of us older woman that were apparently your fan base are going to be disappointed that this entire CD is rock and you put nothing of your sensitive versatile side on this.  I hope this is flying off the shelves (I preordered it myself) but you are going to have to give us old ladies something to keep our interest if you want us to keep buying your CDs.  My best to you.
B0019FOC5E|2.0|Does in no way compare to \\"A Decca Broadway Original Recording (1999 London Cast).\\"  If you love the music of ABBA, that's the one to buy!!!
B00102F5WK|1.0|I am always interested in Meryl Streep. Her name was listed in a way suggesting she was a principal player.  She is not.     This DVD will give you  about 10 minutes of a character type that does not allow Streep to display her range of acting talent.     There are many other reviews which address the question of the use of interogation techniques in fighting terrorists and I don't wish to add another.  This is not a \\"war\\" movie which will bring the country together.

B001ACH4DS|2.0|I voted for David Cook during A.I. but now I wish I had chosen David Archuleta!  Cook's album sounds like a very generic rock album and all the songs sound almost the same - the same instrumentals and the same yelling in the end of each song.  I thought that he would have a more diverse album but hopefully, he will try something new in his next album.  On a side note, David Archuleta's album is just the sweetest album I have ever heard.
B000V86OKG|5.0|As I do not subscribe to Showtime my son gave me the 1st season of Dexter for Christmas last year. I was hooked. I bought the 2nd season and am waiting for the 3rd season to be released. I also bought the 2nd season for my co-workers for Christmas as I also got them hooked. We can't stop talking about each episode.
B001E1DJD4|5.0|The title says it all a fantastic follow up album well worth the wait. Those of you who are not familiar with Rachael Yamagata I urge you to buy this album. From start to finish this oozes quality, This would make a great Christmas present to yourself!!!
1568987846|3.0|I really loved gazing at these gorgeous photos in the \\"year of mornings\\" blog. Though it contains the same beautiful photos, I thought the layout of this book was a bit of a letdown. It could've been put together in a more aesthetically pleasing way, which was surprising, since it's a book of photos. All in all, it's still very nice.
B001DTPZNY|4.0|\\"Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\\" is the fourth installment in the Indiana Jones series and it follows the same storyline and formula as it's three predecessors. All I heard about this film before I watched it was that it didn't compare to the originals and that the special effects were terrible. Well it is true the film didn't compare to the originals but, the film was still enjoyable and keep my interest. As for the special effects, they may have not been the best but, they fit the lighthearted atmosphere of the film. The film is worth watching for fans of the series and if you enjoy action/family oriented films (such as Transformers).
B000ZLFALI|4.0|You have to like musicals and the Beatles to appreciate this movie. I like both and really did enjoy this movie. I am 40 something and my husband is 50 something. Most of the actors are in their 20's, but I really love a talented actor who can act and sing. Another one I bought for my daughter and for myself for Christmas.
B001B1R1EU|5.0|For 95% of you buyers, you've not only heard the Haydn, the Hummel, and the Neruda before, but you've probably got multiple recordings of each (I think I have at least 8 of each on my computer, not including ones that I haven't loaded yet), so you're probably wondering why should you buy this one.<br /><br />First of all, let me say, if you're not in that category and you have no recordings of these pieces and are looking for one, go ahead, get this CD and you'll love it.  The Haydn and Hummel are THE TWO trumpet concertos most backed by time for as universally guaranteed likability as could be sought.  The other two are quite popular concertos as well, and her performances of them are as fine as any.<br /><br />For those of you who want to save their money and don't feel like buying yet another recording of the same pieces; this recording is worth your money.  While everyone's made their own statements of these pieces, few of them have surprised me as much as this one.  Her interpretations are quite distinct from any that I have heard of these pieces and have allowed me to hear many parts of them in a different way.  The usual articulations time-tested and handed down from one teacher to everyone have, quite as often as not, been shelved for new ones; and not to the detriment of the product.<br /><br />She weaves her way through the melodies effortlessly and beautifully and is a delight to listen to.  What has impressed me most about her playing (and was even more exemplified when I heard her play live) is her quiet playing.  Her pianissimo entrances entrance.  Her strength, in my opinion, and it is a great one, is in her great chamber music playing.  She can blend her sound into that of a violin better than just about any I've ever heard, and this CD exemplifies that.<br /><br />With respect to the entire repertoire of modern fully orchestral trumpet concertos, Miss Balsom has chosen to exemplify her talents with these four chamber pieces, traditionally chosen though they may be, they represent her talents fully.  Her fantastic ability to phrase through the orchestra with the advantage of a beautiful soft sound to a fresh and delightfully coherent scheme of articulations make this CD a delight for any collector, be they new to the genre or as well traveled as a pair of old boots.her talents fully.

B00005JOFQ|4.0|Went into this movie cautiously, eyes wide open.  I have to admit, I really liked it.  At first it was pretty startling.  Perhaps the movie would have been easier to watch if it didn't involve cowboys.  I think as Americans we have a preconceived idea of the rugged cowboy and homosexuality doesn't really play into it, so it takes a while to digest that part of the movie.  However, once you get past that point and further into the movie, it really doesn't matter much about the sexual orientation; it could be anyone.  It actually does become more about just two people in love and how they decide to deal with it based on the stereotypes of the period.  The only thing I had a problem with in the movie was understand Heath Ledger's \\"western twang\\" as it was too heavily influenced by his native Australian accent.  It was interesting to see how the women in the men's lives dealt with what their husbands sexuality entailed.  That was the only part in the movie in which I felt no sadness for Ennis and Jack because of the pain they inadvertly placed upon their families.

B001GJOL22|5.0|The audio and video for this production are absolutely stunning. It is simply the best concert footage I have personally seen put in disc format from any artist.  I was lucky enough to see this tour both times it came through Dallas.  Watching this makes me feel like I am right back at the show.  Be sure to watch the Atlanta songs in the extras menu which were the only set changes made from the first tour.  These guys are a class act!
0761100369|5.0|I've had this advent calendar/storybook set since I was a little girl, and every year it continues to brighten my December.  Dickens' classic tale is told charmingly in the 24 books contained in this set, with a surprising amount of original text incorporated with lovely illustrations.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to make their or someone else's Christmas a little more special.
B001GKJ2F2|4.0|Over the summer I saw a lot of movies at the local multiplex. Some I liked some I hated. Then there was something like Wanted which came out to suprise Me with how much I liked. I'm not the biggest fans of the actors, have never read the comic book and only wanted to see the movie after I learned it was the American debut of Timur Bekmambetov, the Russian director of Night Watch and Day Watch. Those films were heavily criticized for being all visual flash and nothing more and I'll admit that for those films and this one Bekmambetov could wind up being a one trick pony who doesn't last long as a filmmaker. But to me his over caffinated visuals are one fo the reasons to see the movie.  Like I said I've never read the graphic novel which has its lovers and haters. The movie itself starts off bradly like something akin Fight Club with Wesley Gibson being a nobody with a girlfriend cheating on him with his best friend, an overweight boss who enjoys lording control over him. All of this changes when he meets Fox played by Angelina Jolie who saves him from Cross, the man who killed the father Wesley knew. She takes him to Sloan where He's given an oppurtunity to train to become a super assassin in order to avenge his fathers murder. Along the way He grows a back bone while gaining the super power of being able to ignore the laws of reality.  Truthfully I wonder how the film would have turned out if it weren't for Bekmambetov (I'm probably mispelling that but Morgan Freeman admits that it took him three weeks to learn how to pronounce wherein He started refering to him as Beky). I guess it could have been something more standard Bekmambetov throws his all in with all the CGI tricks He can wring from his producers. We have slow motion shots of flies having their wings shot off, people flip cars to assasinate targets while classical music plays in the background and images just warp out into some kind of visual freak show. I can't really describe Bekmambetov's film style without making it sound generic to other Hollywood productions. I mean We've seen lots of slow motion bullet shot but something about Bekmambetov's just looks strangely better than other films.  I'm talking about Bekmambetov totally ignoring the actors and the writers. I've never been a diehard James Mcavoy fan but He goes from a goofy guy on autopilot to a pretty good action hero towards the end. And Morgan Freeman is clearly having a fun time as Sloan. I've never really seen him as the evil, amoral type of character however much He tries to play them but here He doesn't over do the acting but does come across as being menacing. For all Her promotion of the film though Angelina Jolie isn't that much of a character in the film never really establishing anything good in her role. Rounding out the cast is Thomas Krestchman as Cross the mostly mute villain, Terence Stamp in a small role as a bulletmaker, and from Night Watch Konstantin Khabensky in one of the better parts as a man raising rats to be bombs.  Theres my view on the movie, one I'd definitely call a sleeper hit for me. Months later how is the DVD. I'll say this for Universal in that thankfully their special editions are realtively cheaper than those films like Wall-e or Street Kings which come out costing more than their Blu-Ray counterpart. They put forth good Discs but I'll say Wanted is a bit thin as a Special Edition. Theres no commentary which was bit disappointing or a hour long documentary feature. But the featurettes themselves do come in handy sometimes. Theres an extended scene, the making of the Train action scene, one of those featurettes where everyone says how cool the director is. Rounding things out are featurette on the making of the videogame, a music video of sorts and one of the better features comparing the graphic novel to the film. Really not that much here that was interesting content wise so I'll say for fans of the film it could be a purchase those going for the blind buy should stickwith the one disc copy.
1416594884|5.0|Book sold as new, and was indeed.  Price was right, and I love this author.
B001J53X9U|5.0|Ok, the movie is a 5 star, this is a little info on the case and bat pod if anyone is curious about it size. We have it at work and I have already seen it. It is actually VERY small, the case and the bat pod. The bat pod is maybe 4\\"-5\\" long, and the case is just a bit larger then the blu rays. I was expecting a bat pod the size of the one available at in the toys at most stores which is 10\\"-12\\" long.<br />AT $50+ dollars, I would get the Bluray 2 disc and the $20 12\\" bat pod, which s a much better bat pod and value in my opinion.
031606792X|1.0|I hated this book.  It was hard for me to swallow that Bella got pregnant(so fast???) and Jacob made a claim on the baby to be his mate.  (sick! he can't have bella so he going to be with her daughter?)To me there was never a love triangle.  The author tried but we all knew about the love Bella and Edward shared.  I am shocked and what a let down.  My last book in my mind is Eclipse. I think that there is a reason that the actors only signed on for the next two movies.  And in these next two movies they better have a lot of onscreen time with Edward because the draw is not Jacob --not even Bella.  It is Rob Pattinson playing Edward.  This should all be interesting.  I hope the movies make up for my huge disappointment--after seeing twilight, i am a little doubtful but I have hope ---hope that with a little more money they can do it right!!--- with out making the audience laugh(bad visual effects in twilight.) It's funny hearing the author say that she knew the ending when she was writing twilight.  It is hard for me to imagine why she ever wanted Bella pregnant.  There were so many better options then a baby getting ripped from her mother by her husbands teeth--it does not flow with the other three!! It does not make sense!!  Is this the same author?????
0525478183|5.0|For a while now, I've been looking for that book that would change my life, and although \\"life changing\\" may be going a bit far, I think this was that book. It is very insightful and poetic, and it is very easy to relate to the characters.<br /><br />John Green is made of awesome, so it's not a surprise that I found this book absolutely, positively amazing.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed from the second you start reading about the marvelous misadventures of Margo Roth Speigleman and Quinten Jacobson, who doesn't know whether Margo is dead, or if she's just run away again. Read the book!
6305428042|5.0|Hocus Pocus is a great family movie.  It funny and not scary for children and least I don't think so.  The casting is very good and just love that movie.  We got it before Halloween and watched it as a family and had a good time watching it.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog is absolutely fantastic. The movie itself is worth the admission price alone (I bought each act seperate on iTunes to give as much money back to the cast and crew as I could), but we get a musical commentary! Nobody does that! AND Evil League of Evil applications! From what I've seen of the prospects so far, the ten chosen ones (ahem) must be incredible.    I would also like to point out (probably not the first to do this but oh well) the 'price slash' on this Amazon exclusive. To the people who buy this because they think they're getting a deal, you are, even at full price. Welcome aboard.
B001DDBCUK|4.0|I enjoyed this movie it much more than I was expecting. The clothes were plentiful and cool and of course they pushed in more by having Carrie have a little fashion show in her apartment and a Wedding dress bonanza. Thankfully, we didn't get that much husband/boyfriend time with the girls, other than Miranda and Steve who were fighting so that made it more interesting. I was a Big fan for a while and while I still don't hate him, I don't know if his fans will love him that much after this movie. He pulled something rediculous that I don't know I can truly forgive him for.     Longer than it needed to be, but I still still enjoyed it nevertheless.
B00005JSGK|5.0|I first saw this movie when I was a little kid and enjoyed it immensely. Now that I am an adult, if anything I enjoy it more. It is the story of a group of adventurers who capture animals for zoos, a job desription that is pretty much extinct in the 21st century John Wayne does his usual bang-up job as the leader with the delicious Elsa Martinelli (the reason why I enjoy the movie even more now) as his love interest. The co-stars include Hardy Krueger, Red Buttons and Wayne's often used friend,Bruce Cabot. The story is very episodic, but,laced with humor and action and a bit of romance, it never lags and holds your interest from the opening scene to the last. This is quite simply one of the most fun movies the Duke ever filmed. If you are looking for some fun time spent in front of the TV, this is a great way to spend a couple of hours or so.
0446530573|5.0|This was an excellent book. My husband loves the sopranos and the women i ordered it from was an excellent patient with great communication and deserve an A++++++++. If you enjoy big italian meals this is def. a book i would recommend!!!
B000062X90|5.0|I am an unabashed fan of Wishbone Ash.This album is the one that first made me a fan.I first heard about \\"Argus\\" from a good friend who was a talented young guitarist at the time.He was very impressed by the harmony-based,twin guitar leads.If anything,he understated the mastery present on this album.Yeah,I know I'm gushing,but,\\"Argus\\" deserves it.When I bought the original LP,I was blown away by not just the guitar,but also the songs and the whole band's chops;they are simply all very talented musicians.The whole'sword and sorcery'bit has been done to death in the years since,but,in the early 70's it was new and very different from the other music around at the time.All the songs are strong and,with an exception or two,follow a progression of a story.My favorite was,and is,\\"Warrior\\".From the first time I heard the lyrics,\\"I've got to be warrior,a slave I couldn't be.A soldier and a conqueror,fighting to be free\\",I was hooked.This CD brings the album into the modern era.Its sonics are far superior to the original CD and yet don't overpower your memories of the original LP.Anyone who has ever picked up an electric guitar and tried to play should have this CD.Anyone who ever wondered why guitarists play until their fingers bleed out of sheer love of the sounds they can make should buy this CD.Anyone who has ever loved the sound of Rock guitar played way beyond most people's abilities should grab this CD.YOU should buy this CD and play it loud.If you don't shout for joy at the sound of \\"Argus\\",you don't deserve to call yourself a Rock fan.

B0001XAS1W|5.0|I was first introduced to Al Stewart through an early album called \\"Love Chronicles\\" which was,at least in my mind,the story of all of his love's from childhood to adulthood.After hearing that,admittedly,hit and miss album,Al put out some music that I never really got a chance to hear due to his lack of airplay and sales in the U.S.Then came \\"Year of The Cat\\",which I bought upon its U.S.release,due to a review that I'd read.This is one of those albums that you like from the opening note.From the very first strains of \\"Lord Grenville\\",I was hooked.The second song,the hit,\\"On The Border\\" was even better.Song after song tells stories of losers and winners and lovers to great effect.Not a bad song in the bunch.When it came to the title track,I was already enthralled,but found that he had left the best for last.\\"Year of The Cat\\" is a great song,right from the opening piano to the haunting lyrics and final fade.It was/is a cut above all of his previous story songs.That first listen was followed by simply turning over the record and playing it all the way through again.In the years since it has lost none of its appeal.I still consider it among my favorites of all time.This is the Folk/Pop/Rock album that everyone should own.This CD has great sound and is a cut above all his other releases.Very highly recommended!
0316017922|5.0|Gladwell has a knack for taking things that should be obvious and presenting them to us in such a way that we feel we've known what he's talking about all along; or, at least, that we should have known all along.  That's what he did in his two previous books and that's what he does in this one.  Depending on how you feel about that will, in large part, determine your reaction to Outliers.<br /><br />The topic this time around is a little different.  An outlier is something that is markedly different than average.  In this book, Gladwell examines people who have been remarkably successful (or unsuccessful) and tries to determine what makes them so.  Basically, he is trying to debunk the idea that it is innate talent that in the primary determinant of success.  Instead, he looks to things like the chance of birth, the luck of opportunity and the influence of cultural background.  And he makes a compelling case.<br /><br />Gladwell doesn't deny that talent is important but he makes the point that, once you reach a certain level, innate intelligence stops being a factor of success.  A genius can be an Einstein or a genius can be a forgotten someone who never has the means or opportunity to make the most of his talent.  He goes into the importance of practice (10,000 hours) to reach the expert level at anything.  This is something that many understand on some level but the myth of the genius makes it easy to forget.<br /><br />Beyond his look at correlations between IQ and success, Gladwell delves into his other themes.  He uses examples like Bill Gates to show that he was born at the right time and had opportunities that no one else had--computer access at a time when computers were a rare commodity--that made him one of only a handful of people who could take advantage of the PC revolution when it came.  Gates had talent, yes, but he had a rare sequence of situations that allowed him to prepare himself to be a success.  He talks about how cultural background influences success--the rise of Jewish lawyers in the age of corporate takeovers, the failure of Korean Air because subordinate co-pilots could not communicate with pilots, the rigors of rice growing influencing Asians' ability in math.<br /><br />But the real importance in analyzing these ideas, which some may find uncomfortable because of what may be seen as whiffs of racism or elitism, is the fact that having this knowledge allows us to make changes for the better.  Once they understood their problem, Korean Air was able to turn itself around.  Knowing how birth date effects success in sports and school at a young age allows us to plan better to reduce this impact.  It is in this ability to make for the maximization of talent that gives Gladwell's work its importance.<br /><br />Gladwell is a very strong writer and this may be his best work to date.  I'm sure there are people out there who will disagree with him; however, it is difficult to deny how engaging he is as a writer.  He tells great personal stories.  He moves from stories to data.  He pulls it all together to make his argument.  Agree with him or disagree, but read this book and think about what he has to say.wish lawyers in the age of corporate takeovers, the failure of Korean Air because subordinate co-pilots could not communicate with pilots, the rigors of rice growing influencing Asians' ability in math.

B001M6KTLG|4.0|Oh for heaven's sake. This is not Godard or Truffaut we're talking about. It's an Indiana Jones movie, for chrissakes, a franchise actually based on cheesy, B-movie serials!! Why are people expecting something along the lines of \\"The English Patient\\"?    The film moves briskly in a reasonable running time (why is everything 2-1/2 hours long now?), has some quiet moments that are charming (unlike most of what passes (at blinding headache-inducing speed) for entertainment these days), and ties up some nice ends from the first film. (Don't worry, unlike some of the sour-pussed reviewers here, I won't give away anything without warning.) It also gives Indiana Jones a love interest that's commensurate with his old age, another fact that is not glossed over or ignored.    What some people seem to have been anticipating was an instant classic that lives up to their MEMORIES of the original trilogy, or at least the first film, since the second one was far inferior and the third was a bit better than this worthy wrapup. This is coming from someone who enjoyed the first three movies, but was certainly not overwhelmed by them; these are popcorn films, first and foremost, and to inject Kierkegaard and Bergman into them is folly. Enjoy it for the nice movie (not film) that it is, and you'll live far longer.    (As for the reviewer who grumbles that a grizzled old man scrambling into a refrigerator will compel kids to do the same: You dismiss the intelligence of children far too insultingly.)
031606792X|5.0|**WARNING** Contains spoilers!    Having just finished Breaking Dawn and actually feeling sad that the Twilight series is over, I was shocked to read such negative reviews here! This should all go without saying here but....this is not real! This is make-believe...fantasy! Edward can have sperm and Bella could conceive and give birth in 45 minutes if that is what the author writes! Really people... I can't believe that you have given negative reviews to a wonderful book based on the believability factor of a series about vampires and shape-shifters! What a disservice that is! But in keeping with the spirit, I would like to point out a few things. As far as Jacob imprinting on the baby...it was explained earlier on when, I believe it was Paul, imprinted on Claire, who is 2 or so. When the object of ones imprinting is a child, there is no sexual or romantic nature to it whatsoever. It is brotherly love at it's finest. The author went to great lengths to make that very clear from the beginning! As far as Edward...if he was a mature male at the time he was changed, then it makes sense that he would have sperm. Female vampires cannot bear children because a woman's body must be able to change to accommodate a pregnancy - once a female has been changed, her body stays frozen in time - thus no pregnancy. As far as how fast Bella's pregnancy was....again...up to the author. Being a mom, I can tell you that 9 months is a lot longer than non-parents think it is! Anyways.....as I said, I think that the negative reviews have done a great disservice to the Twilight series and I hope that future readers take into consideration the reasons behind the bad reviews - that the complaints do not make sense unless you actually believe that any of this can really happen. All in all, a wonderful series that I am already truly missing. If you are thinking about reading these books, do yourself a favor and just do it! You won't regret it!  :)
B00000I41G|5.0|This is one of those really cool jazz recordings that, I think, tends to get overlooked. Whatever effect Kenny was trying to achieve by calling it Midnight Blue and then filling it with blues melodies and bluesy jazz tunes has been achieved several times over. As I've said in a number of my reviews, jazz guitar has never been my passion, and although Bill Frisell has done a lot to change that perspective, I must admit I continue to be dispassionate about most jazz guitar work. That's why I'm surprised (pleasantly so) at how much I like this recording. Maybe it's the blues emphasis that does it for me, or maybe it's the solid backing band that Kenny allows to come forward often enough that his guitar isn't bashing you over the head from start to finish. It could also be the cool blows of Stanley Turrentine, the swinging bass of Major \\"Mule\\" Holley, or the timelessness of the songs. Whatever, I also find Burrell's guitar not as honky-tonky as Wes Montgomery, and not as mercury-smooth as Frisell, so that Kenny's unique guitar sound in the context of these relatively familiar tunes keeps me at attention. Kenny's solo on Soul Lament is just dripping with blue something, and Chitlins Con Carne isn't a jazz standard for nothing. In short, I think this is a great sounding recording (as most Van Gelder Blue Note remasters are) with a talented band and leader doing a nice selection of classic blues tunes, and I really can't ask for much more in a jazz recording. I recommend this to jazz fans and non-fans alike.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|I saw Rush during both the 2007 and 2008 Snakes & Arrows tours, and watching this DVD made me feel like I was living it all over again (minus the smell of beer, sweat and pot). Rush put on a fantastic show, with a great selection of old, new and \\"deep\\" cuts.    The camera work is intimate, capturing the trio's virtuosity, interplay and sense of humor. We actually get a shot of Neil Peart laughing!  Although it suffers a bit with too much camera motion and rapid cuts between camera angles, it is much, much less distracting than Rush in Rio.  And the HD image on Discs 1 and 2 is beautiful (viewed on standard DVD). Disc 3 was recorded in SD and the difference is immediately apparent and striking.    The two channel stereo mix was excellent to my ears - with just enough crowd noise so you don't forget you are watching a live performance (HUGE improvement of Rush in Rio). The treatment of the video bumpers is a plus as well.  Zooming to full screen in most instances, the videos appear to be transferred directly from their source, rather than being filmed.  This gave me a chance to pick up on the subtleties that I missed when seeing them live.    Add to this a few bonus features like outtakes and the full act 2 intro video from the 2008 tour, and you can't go wrong.  Rush fans who saw this live will want to have it.  Rush fans who did not see them in 2007 or 2008 will want it as well, but they will feel some remorse for not making the effort to see it live.    A final comment about Geddy Lee's singing. His voice is quite strong on most tracks, surprisingly so on some like Spirit of Radio and Circumstances.  But this is not Geddy Lee of 15 - 20 years ago, so be prepared for a bit of a letdown on tracks like A Passage to Bangkok and The Temples of Syrinx.
0920668364|5.0|First of all, the people who are saying this book is \\"creepy\\" are taking it way too literally.  It's a sweet sentimental message that parents are going to love their children no matter what- throwing things in the toilet, moving away, etc.  My mom read this book to us throughout our childhood, and I never suffered any emotional trauma from it.  On top of that, she gives it as a gift to expectant mothers we know.  The book flips views at the end as the son goes to be with his mother when she can no longer come to see him.      To this day my mom signs cards and letters to the three of us with, \\"Love you forever, like you for always, for as long as I'm living my baby you'll be.\\"

1580493939|5.0|The experience of reading Oscar Wilde's The Picture of Dorian Gray is tantamount to engaging in a philosophical debate with a person suffering from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder--and they're winning. The exquisite attention to detail paired with a sharp analytical wit delivers an indomitable argument. One cannot help but succumb to temptations along with the charismatic Dorian and echo his cries of despair when the effects of sin become prominently displayed, marring the handsome features.<br /><br />Wilde creates a subtle trap, luring the reader with Dorian's innocence and naivet&eacute;. The snare gently tightens as the pure boy slides deeper into depravity and becomes corrupted by pleasure. So slowly is the reader introduced to the poison, by the time realization hits there is no hope of escape. They are as thoroughly embroiled in the life of hedonism and aestheticism as the protagonist. Dorian becomes subsequently more callous with every act of debauchery he commits and the impact of his actions is reduced by the sheer number of skeletons in his closet. Rather than becoming appalled as his wickedness grows, the reader is simple hardened for what is to come. When Dorian finally carries out the act of treachery that tilts the scale, no one is surprised.<br /><br />The pictures painted by Wilde's careful words are elaborate to the point of being mind-numbing. Explicit descriptions of Dorian's hobbies fill pages while serving no apparent purpose. Closer examination determines the usefulness of aforementioned descriptions in drawing the reader closer to the child-like curiosity of Dorian, perhaps justifying his eventual corruption. Unfortunately this knowledge is not enough to banish the tedium and some passages must simply be suffered through.<br /><br />Oscar Wilde has created a thought provoking masterpiece. An excellent read for those who have ever question the morality of society of have peered out across seas of corruption and vowed to stay away. Not for the faint of hear or easily distracted, hose who choose to take the plunge will find themselves pleasantly rewarded.acted, hose who choose to take the plunge will find themselves pleasantly rewarded.
1416594884|1.0|Having read almost every LeCarre novel, I found this one developed a good story line, but the author used the last few pages to take a swipe at the US by showing the american characters as cowboys without true intelligence/information.  The ending was ruined for me by overtly derogatory statements by the author.   I think in his later years LeCarre must have started reading and believing Ian Fleming's Bond novels.

B00009W0U4|1.0|This film is exploitation at its worst. Not only indulging in rape but also locating the film's ultimate trauma in the woman's hidden pregnancy, as if rape is not a violent enough act when the victim isn't pregnant. Disgusting, and everyone who likes this film scares the hell out of me.

B000002MG1|5.0|An album about life, death and the anxiety on the fine line between them, R.E.M. bucked convention after the mammoth success of \\"Losing My Religion\\" and [[ASIN:B0006ICF9A Out of Time]]. The skipped touring, went right back into the studio, and opened their souls as they created \\"Automatic For The People.\\" What started out as a rock project soon began to turn inward, as Michael Stipe lyrically explored love and loss in the early 90's and the band's political discontent.<br /><br />It's not an accident that the \\"[[ASIN:B000007WA3 Rock On]]\\" inspired first single \\"Drive\\" contained the line \\"Smack, crack, Bushwacked,\\" as the soul-destroying forces of drugs, addled by the ineptitude of \\"The War On Drugs,\\" was something the band viewed as stupefying the youth of the day. And like many bands that were losing their innocence in this era of AIDS, R.E.M. saw many friends and colleagues fall victim to a disease that politicians were eager to avoid and spoke of only in judgemental tones. \\"Try Not To Breathe\\" and \\"Nightswimming\\" takes on the topic, with \\"Breathe\\" a companion sitting at a lover's bedside and offering comfort even as their heart breaks, while \\"Nightswimming\\" looks back on a more carefree period where ignorance was a childhood privilege spent on \\"The fear of getting caught, of recklessness and water.\\"<br /><br />\\"Everybody Hurts\\" is \\"Automatic's\\" cornerstone, calling for resolve even in these difficult times. (It was accompanied by an effective video, as well.) John Paul Jones' orchestration of this (and three other songs) gently highlighted the plea to \\"hold on,\\" even as things only looked as if they would never come out of the bleakness. Exploring the same topic more light heartedly was \\"Man On The Moon,\\" the band's tribute to the late comic Andy Kauffman. Even as it name drops everyone from Elvis Presley to [[ASIN:B000E6EJA2 Mott The Hoople]], it also teases out the childhood games of Twister and Risk, as it postulates that Andy went to heaven to dig on Elvis and \\"A truck stop instead of St Peter.\\"<br /><br />While the brilliant tracks here are among R.E.M.'s best, there were a couple of misfires. I have never been able to find \\"The Sidewinder Sleeps Tonight\\" appealing, and \\"New Orleans Instrumental\\" always felt like filler to me. Although I like the blistering reprimand of \\"Ignoreland,\\" its vitriol seemed out of place on an album so introspective and thoughtful. Even with those quibbles, I've come back to this R.E.M. CD almost as often as I do the classics [[ASIN:B000001I0A Murmur]] and [[ASIN:B000002UW1 Document]]. After \\"Automatic,\\" the band seemed to get confused (ala U2 in their [[ASIN:B000001EAQ Pop]] period), pounding out the glammy [[ASIN:B0006IIPFS Monster]] and the by-the-numbers [[ASIN:B0006ICF90 New Adventures in Hi Fi]].

0307346617|4.0|Well I first like to say I HATE zombies, just the thought of the dead coming back alive makes me quiver, so when I bought \\"the zombie survival guide\\" I just had to pick it up. I read it over and over. I loved it. So when I saw that he written another book, I had to check it out. I purchased it while I was in the desert. I was easy to read and visualize everything that had happened to all the people. I'm glad to see that the world wasn't completely destroyed and that the world had been to able to fight back the plague that seems to be destroyed in all other recreations. I loved it!
B0002YCVXI|5.0|This is just beautiful music--very melodious and evocative.  Yo-Yo Ma is a consummate musician.  Wonderful compositions like Morricone's in his hands is a delight to the ears and emotions.  I highly recommend this CD.
B00020HEL6|5.0|Oh my, what a voice on this young lady!  Many have said such kind things here and they are all well-deserved. I can only add that a good friend of mine, Donna Hightower-- who has sold millions of records in Europe and is also well-known for her jazz singing-- was blown away by Renee's singing when she heard \\"Taking a Chance on Love.\\" She couldn't believe that this young singer could possibly be singing like that-- but she is. I can't wait for the next CD to come out.

B001H5X7JS|5.0|I'm not an aficionado of war movies, but I'm familiar enough with them to know the elements that were once groundbreaking but are now cliche (several scenes in this movie remind me of Platoon in particular). I went into this expecting a lame spoof movie, but instead I saw one of the best comedies that has come a long for a very long time. If you're tired of the drivel from the \\"Not Another Teen Movie/Meet the Spartans\\" bunch, don't worry-- this is NOTHING like that! It's actually FUNNY, SMART and ENTERTAINING. (That shouldn't be so much to ask, but it seems to be!)<br /><br />The premise is very much like [[ASIN:B00003CXDV Galaxy Quest]], another film where actors are thrust into a real-life situation and must get themselves out. There is a lot more poking fun at Hollywood stereotypes, and in a couple of places the movie may have gone too far. However, there's nothing mean-spirited about any of it. The gory scenes are fake and funny. The trailers border on the ridiculous, but tell a certain truth about movies, and probably about ourselves as well.<br /><br />So many standout actors in this movie, and so little review space! I am no fan of Tom Cruise-- it's nothing personal; I've just never liked anything he's done... but I LOVED his performance as Les Grossman! At times I forgot Robert Downey Jr. wasn't black. Danny McBride, the explosive-loving stunt coordinator, and Brandon T. Jackson as Alpa Chino are HILARIOUS, and I hope we see more of them in the future. Matthew McConaughey surprised me for a second time... whatever you think of [[ASIN:B00006JDVV Reign of Fire]], he surprised me in that one as he did in this one.<br /><br />I like to get the extended edition DVDs, but I rarely watch the extras. I will say that the deleted scenes included on disc two were deleted for a reason; deleted scenes usually are. I got this for the extended, unrated cut, which is the only way to watch it. If you enjoy the extras, consider it a bonus. I didn't want to like this movie, but I did. Do yourself a favor and watch it-- it's TOTALLY WORTH IT.favor and watch it-- it's TOTALLY WORTH IT.
B000002OR4|5.0|As a student of history, to me Schindler's List remains one of the most powerful films of all time. The soundtrack is truly superb and it too is up there with some of the most moving and stirring pieces of music ever. Even if you never saw the film this soundtrack deserves a listen, but hand in hand with the film it will make an impact that will be with you for a very long time, perhaps all time.
B001EOQWEO|2.0|My family and I saw Wall-e at the theater and wanted the DVD as soon as it came out. Unfortunately the disc is defective and will not play on my system without constant freeze-ups.  This does not happen with any other DVD's.  Sadly, I'm going to go through the refund/return process.  My two star on the movie is my frustration with the disc, not the movie itself.  Wall-e is one of the cutest little animated characters produced.  Some might call the film a message movie, I don't think that's the primary point.  A case can be made for most animated films having some kind of message, it's all how/why you want to see it.  Be a kid again, then watch these kinds of movies!

I am listening to it on audio and have skiped disks just so I can keep listening.  my advise just ask someone who has already read the book what happens.  way to much information that is not needed.  if there is an abridged version I would buy that before you try to read the entire book.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|I began looking for \\"Serenity\\" after I rented the entire \\"Firefly\\" series.  I was beginning to feel frustrated because in my small town all we have is a Wal-Mart and they don't carry \\"Serenity.\\"  It was very convenient to pop online and order \\"Serenity.\\"  It arrived in about a week.

B001GQACGO|2.0|When I purchased \\"I Am...\\" (Deluxe Version), I was expecting more than what I got.  Beyonce did not impress me with her latest effort.  There were no tracks that stood out or really stuck to me besides her 2 current singles, \\"If I Were A Boy\\" and \\"Single Ladies\\".  I appreciate her attempt to create nice ballads on disc one, but after awhile, you need something to wake you up.  And you do when you first put on Disc 2, \\"Single Ladies\\" can get you moving.  But that's where it ends.  All the songs sound overproduced and none of the beats are catchy.  Her previous album, \\"B'Day\\" was much stronger, and that is not saying much.  I won't go into elaborate detail of every track because my words might become repetitive.  This album is strictly for die-hard Beyonce fans.  If you are new to her music, save your money.  Beyonce was at her best when she lead Destiny's Child.  Ever since she has gone solo, she has had trouble defining herself.  \\"Dangerously In Love\\" had the sweet sounds of pop and R&B.  \\"B'Day\\" offered a more ghetto hip-hop, ferocious Beyonce.  And \\"I Am...\\" shows how she is unable to capture her true identity mixing in slow, meaningless ballads with techno-like, overproduced dance tracks.  I will always like and admire Beyonce, but she needs to pick a sound and stick with it.

Admitedly, it is used, but not in the condition it should have been.    I would have returned the CD, but I didn't realize how scratched up it was until after I had it for a while and I had already thrown all of the packaging, etc. away. Not all of the artwork was with the CD -- the back art was missing.

031606792X|1.0|I understand that the core of the series is about a teenage girl falling in love and discovering an everlasting love. I, however, did turn a blind eye to the teenage angst and hormones(despite the multiple references that she is supposed to be a woman-child and wise beyond her years) because the main character is a teenager.  Overall, I really liked the first three books, especially the third book.  Yet, I was really disappointed with the last book.  I'll try not to be redundant and will only write about my top three disappointments.    1.  Like other reviewers, I lost interest in the book when Bella became pregnant.  It just didn't make any sense---women vampires can't have a monthly cycle but vampire men can have sperm (by the way, the book references Charlie Chaplin, a human, not a vampire).    2.  I was also very sad and disappointed that Bella and Edward's love was poorly written and very neglected (especially compared to the previous three books).    3.  I guess my biggest disappointment with the book was that I really was hoping that Bella wasn't going to be turned into a vampire (maybe it was inevitable).  I hoped that Stephanie Meyer was going to allow Bella to actually be wise beyond her years in that she accepts herself as a human and the fact that she will age, but also realizing that her love for Edward (and vice versa) is eternal, regardless of her human \\"flaws.\\"  I guess I was hoping for a different kind of happily ever after.
B000001FQ4|4.0|Night Life is perhaps the most mellow album Thin Lizzy ever made.  It seems every moment of the album just doesn't ROCK out.  However, I think with time, you'll learn to appreciate the mellow style of the album and maybe, just maybe (even though it's a stretch) come around to think it's a classic just the heavier Thin Lizzy albums.    The albums main obvious flaw is that it sounds exactly like a mid 70's rock album by Eric Clapton, the Eagles, or even Santana.  Like I've always said though- what counts the most is the songwriting, and luckily that has remained just as solid as ever.    \\"She Knows\\" is my favorite song from the album.  The way those vocals seem to sail calmly and peacefully as the verse melody rolls on... just brilliant.  \\"Night Life\\" is a great little mellow bluesy song, though if I keep using the word \\"mellow\\" I'll get bored fast!  The entire album has a soft feel.  This song is seriously one that gets better the more you listen to it.      \\"Still in Love With You\\" features some rather underrated guitar playing, maybe similar to Santana, maybe not.  Good vocals too.  \\"Frankie Carroll\\" has a haunting vibe, with nice piano playing.  Never heard Thin Lizzy attempt something like THAT before.  \\"Showdown\\" is just groovy, and I love it.      \\"Banshee\\" reminds me of an instrumental the Allman Brothers Band would create (no song in particular) and that's a GREAT thing in my book.  \\"Philomena\\" is a fast and heavy Irish-sounding song, which makes sense since the band came from Ireland.  Probably the heaviest song on the album.  I think you'll like the verse melody.  It's really good.    \\"Dear Heart\\" is a nice way to close out the album, though not a highlight for me.  I don't know, the strings sound a bit cheesy, and the vocals are hard to make out (along with the guitar playing near the end) but it's a nice song despite that.  Might help to be a Neil Diamond fan to really appreciate the sound of the song though.    Overall, good album, not a classic, but it's worth buying without giving it a second thought.

B00133KFGW|4.0|\\"August Rush\\" is a \\"magic movie\\".  It's a movie about the power of love and music, which ultimately seem much more powerful in this film than they are in real life.<br />The story is about Evan Taylor, a boy who lives in a home for children without parents.  Evan knows that his parents are out in the world, though, and he desires to find them, through the power of music, which he says they \\"gave to him\\".  And indeed, this music is very powerful as he sets out on a journey to find his parents--just two people--in New York City.<br />If I told anymore, I would give a lot of the story away.  So I'll just say, this movie is a feel-good film.  Practical thinkers probably won't enjoy it as much, since there isn't much practicality in it.  It's a Hollywood movie to the core--true, deep love is portrayed as a one night stand, and events take place that would never happen in the real world.  But that's what movies--and music--is for, right?  To transport viewers and listeners to a different world.  And if so, \\"August Rush\\" does a pretty good job of it.<br /><br />(I also like to add in a bit about content in the films I review.  As a 16-year-old Christian girl, I always appreciate reviews that shed some light on the objectionable content in a film.  So below is a summary of things parents might want to take into consideration.)<br /><br />Love between two people in this film is portrayed as one night together on a rooftop of New York under the stars.  You never actually see anything, but you know they did more than kiss because the girl is pregnant later on.  All you see are the two of them lying on a couch on the roof in each other's arms.<br /><br />A few d-words are spoken, mostly by a little boy.  God's name is used in vain a few times.  If you watch the deleted scenes, there is one that shows a character yelling out God's name and the d-word at a little kid.<br /><br />The character played by Robin Williams is a little threatening at times.  While he \\"cares\\" for the street kids, his character doesn't really come across as caring.  Instead, he seems like a greedy, abusive sort of man.  You wonder if it was supposed to be implied that he was on drugs.  Either that, or the dude was just kinda doodly in the head.t really come across as caring.

006056251X|5.0|Devil in Winter is the third book in Lisa Kleypas' Wallflower series. This truly was an enjoyable tale, and I recommend reading them in order. Had I not, I would not have appreciated so many things that happened in the other books. I kept thinking in the back of my head how can Sebastian redeem himself. Evie visits Sebastian with a marriage solution that will benefit both of them. Evie, for protection and Sebastian, for money. What comes from that solution is a marriage that becomes real. Where they each quit being what others think them to be, and they turn into what they WANT to be. Sebastian is BAD, REAL BAD, and he doesn't care, but it's a front, and Evie knows it. Sebastian sees that there's more to Evie than her stammers and shyness, but she is a treasure- rich as a sweet and soothing lady. There was a bunch of symbolism (Jenner's Club) that occurs with this book, and the little actions that Evie and Sebastian take. You watch them fall in love, and enjoyable to see Sebastian be brought to his knees.  This is a memorable book, it's very emotional. If you haven't visited this series... You many want to think about it!
B001GKJ2DO|3.0|Imagine that you are a huge marquee movie star.  Perhaps you've got two Oscars to your name and untold nominations for gritty dark roles where you've had to assume  heavy European accents.  Perhaps you have embodied to fantastic accolades one of the staple characters of popular culture, be it Mr. Bond or Mr. Darcy.  You are a Serious Actor, not known for (or possessing) any particular musical theatre ability.  What would compel you to accept a role in an ABBA musical where you had to both sing and dance AND perhaps look generally ridiculous?  Maybe because you want to have some FUN at work, even if it's at your own expense and you have to spend half the movie in overalls and ratty sneakers?  Having a working holiday on a fabulous Greek island surely must render all other objections moot.  Meryl Streep is amazing; a force of nature who looks great for her age or frankly, any age.  She displays a real flair for physical comedy and a more-than-passable voice belting out some of ABBA's greatest hits.  The highlight for me was her empassioned rendering of \\"The Winner Takes It All\\" on a rocky Greek hillside.  She is the strongest voice in this cast of non-singers, and her zest for life is palpable.  The project has something of an air of an under-rehearsed production by a third-rate college drama department, but it's all in zany good fun.  If you're not a fan of ABBA songs, don't bother with this; go watch an episode of \\"Inside the Actors Studio\\" instead.
0671799320|3.0|The first 200 pages of \\"The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power\\" are compelling and fascinating because they are about the compelling and fascinating characters who created the modern oil industry. There is, of course, John D. Rockefeller whose organizational genius permitted the rise of Standard Oil, the antecedent of today's Exxon-Mobil. Then there is the hopelessly disorganized but very lucky British merchant Marcus Samuel who founded Shell, and the meticulous and disciplined Dutchman Henri Deterding who would turn it into Standard Oil's global competitor.    Oil's early pioneers sustain the early narrative but as we progress further into Daniel Yergin's 788-page tome the author's fundamental weaknesses as a writer are all too apparent. First there is his clunky writing style, so clunky in fact that the writing doesn't feel edited. Second Mr. Yergin chooses to talk about everything and about everyone, and so this book is more encyclopedia than narrative -- and it's very discomforting to read an encyclopedia structured as a chronological narrative. Third is how Mr. Yergin insists on the equal importance of his many characters -- in his estimate there is not a handful of founders of the modern oil industry but dozens. Fourth there is Mr. Yergin's insistence on the primacy of oil, leading him to make simplistic arguments such as that World War II was fundamentally battles over oil (it's very true that war is about resources and logistics but oil is only one resource).     A lot of these problems stem from the fact that Mr. Yergin really doesn't know that much about oil (Yes, I know it says on the back that he's an \\"authority on world affairs and the oil business\\"!). He ignores the environmental problems with oil, and doesn't at all mention the excellent and disturbing point that the documentary \\"Eleventh Hour\\" makes so explicit: that oil is captured sunshine, and by living off oil today we are essentially living off the past and mortgaging the future. \\"The Prize\\" has no original research, and feels like a hastily put together of newspaper clippings and books. The book's final 200 pages especially feel this way, and are just unreadable. What is the point of regurgitating the events leading up to the Suez Canal Crisis, the Iran-Iraq War, and other late twentieth-century crises that any reader who chooses to pick up a 788-page book on oil would already know about?    Mr. Yergin would have served his readers better to focus on the oil industry's early pioneers, and to trace how their corporate descendants have fared in the modern world. His tracing of the founding of OPEC to the Texas Railroad Commission's containment of the Texas oil glut in the 1920s is very interesting and informative. And if Mr. Yergin had more of these examples connecting the past to the present \\"The Prize\\" would be an informative narrative instead of the overwrought encyclopedia it is now.

B001E75QGG|5.0|I'm so suprised to see so many here writing poor reviews for this film.  Its Indiana Jones.  What's not to love?  Personally i HATED the 2nd Indy film, the kids being kidnapped/heart being pulled beating out of the guy, eating monkey brains nonsense, but this film was much more entertaining.    I loved the idea of his son being a new character (i could see more of the series with this scenerio)  It was full of action and nostalgia.  My 12 yr old said he loved it more than the Dark Knight (tho i had a stupid grin on my face during that wonderful movie too)    I have little to say in the way of a bad review, i do think the chase scene could have been better, but the ants were cool, I dont know, i thought it was great, like i said im suprised at the number of crybabies who were expecting something more than an action movie with the man in the hat and his whip.....  It is what it is, pure fluff entertainment!
B00003W8NM|5.0|Be honest with yourself, did you notice the Brad Pitt \\"Blips\\" the first time?  If you said yes then you are either a LIAR or you like to expand your mind...Whether you did or not, this movie is one of the best.    This comedy is pitch black and brought to you by Director David Fincher as an adaptation of a novel by now famed writer Chuck Palahniuk.  Ed Norton and Brad Pitt give a most incredible performance made sharp by the script and sweet visual effects.      Sick and tired of corporate American greed, Norton's character seeks comfort in a few weird places.  He eventually meets Pitt's character on a plane ride home.  Circumstance puts them together soon after and the Fight Club emerges.  The end result is bringing down the system and that is a metaphor for what Norton's character goes through till the end.  Add Helena Carter's character, Marla Singer, recently in the Sweeney Todd remake, and you have the dark necessary to truly make this movie work.
B000M341QE|4.0|I picked up this film primarily because of the fact that one of my favorite actors (Jack Nicholson - Frank Costello) has a starring role in it. For his acting the the movie, I surely was not disappointed. The Departed is a film with Mind-blowing plot variations and shocking revelations which culminates in a violent and stunning end.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio (Billy Costigan) and Matt Damon (Colin Sullivan) are both in very interesting roles, seemingly polar opposites, who actually have more in common than they would ever realize. Placed as a mole in Frank Costello's criminal enterprise, Billy Costigan was a young recruit, chosen by his superiors to infiltrate and ultimately take down the organization from the top. Colin Sullivan, on the other hand, groomed from a young age by Frank, becomes a sucessful trooper, right out of the academy. He becomes a mole for Frank, feeding him information on department activity in an attempt to prolong and save his enterprise. Colin looks to Frank as the father figure, and Frank seems to take Billy under his wing as well.<br /><br />What follows is a stellar performance by the entire cast, with a story that is as intense, as it is violent, profane and shocking.<br /><br />One warning, the film clocks in over 2 hours, and you cannot miss a minute of it without being lost... However, even with the length of the movie, it doesn't ever seem to lag, I couldn't imagine that any of this movie should be cut. A very compelling, imaginative and true to life plot with an ending that will leave you in a stunned silence of contemplation.
B001ACH4DS|3.0|We had high hopes for this cd b/c we loved David Cook on AI!!!  Needless to say though its kind of boring!  I wouldn't say he's as bad as Bo Bice but we were expecting the next Chris Daughtry!  He just fell short.  Most of the songs sound the same, its the same beat through out the whole Cd.  David let Analog Heart go. What happened to the hard rocker!?!

B000IOM0YC|3.0|A great film that deserves a new transfer. The transfer of this film appears to be the same source as the one used for the DVD version. This is not to say that it doesn't look much better in Blu-Ray than it does on DVD. But it is not, evidently, a brand new transfer made expressly for Blu-Ray release.<br /><br />As happened in past generations of video standards, VHS to LaserDisc, LaserDisc to DVD, standard definition 480i to \\"high def\\" 1080i, and now 480p progressive scan DVD to 1080p Blu-Ray, the studios are cutting corners and, with many titles, re-issuing transfers that were \\"pretty good\\" for the prior standard on newer media without re-mastering them for the full potential of the newer standard. \\"Pretty good\\" is not why you buy a Blu-Ray, or pay a premium for it.<br /><br />Sadly, some major film titles are being \\"shoved out there\\" with on the new Blu-Ray format. This appears to be one of them. Although not nearly as bad as the abysmal \\"Silence Of the Lambs\\" and \\"Interview With The Vampire\\" BDs, the picture quality of \\"Reds\\" is still sub-par and underwhelming compared to what it could have been with a new-transfer made with BD release in mind.
B001AP11LQ|5.0|I've read excerpts that say Jack White thinks this album rocks harder than anything they've ever done. I'm not sure what era that came from because \\"Elephant\\" really rocks and they've put out a ton of rockin' tracks since this.  I can see where he's coming from since all of the Stripes have a definite drive, this one isn't really about variations, it's about being direct all the way through while still stopping, shifting gears and changing the course of the drive, but this one feels like a really strong and fast drive despite the quiet moments.  It's so rooted in feel that the album never has a lapsing moment.  People who complain about the music being \\"basic\\" are correct, but like minimalism they fail to take into consideration the complexities that can be brought to fore with limited options.  Other Stripes albums do this in much stronger ways with instrumentation and the influence where the songs come from which brings a bit of detachment (sometimes).  Here, the Stripes made the classic imprint of their work and while they haven't challenged it since  that only means they've moved on and gotten better which is so uncommon these days.  I enjoy all the Stripes records and this one wasn't the first I listened to, but the immediacy and strong consistency in this release make it my favorite.  It's not the one I think is their best, but that's for another review. Also, I must address the issue of the obvious influence of Flat Duo Jets on the group.  Jack has stated in interviews that he was a big fan, so it makes sense, but it doesn't mean they're plagiarizing them.  It's a really ridiculous idea since that group is similarly great at what they do, but it's clearly nothing new(meaning derivative) so to all those out there seeking that argument you should learn to accept music on it's own terms and not on the terms you've set for it.  Everyone works off of something else, and who knows maybe the band playing in homage to the legend 20 years after the fact makes an approvement.  Just a thought for you on Amazon to contemplate. I'm out.

B0015KO52S|5.0|When I say mainstream, I don't mean streamlined, because this is anything but that. This album has many elements that are surprising for those accustomed to the bluesy and power pop elements of the two main songwriters.  The tracks are filled with diverse genre bending all without sounding alternative, or even commercial, and I have to give them credit for that.  This album is a definite step up from Broken Boy Soldiers which was clearly an overly simplified introduction to the dabbling sensibilities each songwriter brought to the table, on this album the entire band feels adequately showcased throughout and they stretch out.  Perhaps they were going outside their comfort zone, or maybe they would be comfortable doing this already and just decided to let us in on it.  However you crack it the egg is mighty tasty if you eat it and impressive if you let it hatch and grow. Honestly, I think it was gutsy for the Racs to let loose on their love of classic boogie, southern, and all other forms of popular rock they crank out here.  No one is creating music of this quality and verve on the scene right.  This music is alive as opposed to being studied even when they're doing a cover (rich kid blues).  It certainly has its groundings in familiar sounds, but it's a great way to inject so much more energy into it.  I find it inspirational to say it's ok to be popular just don't make carbon copies and rob people thinking they were buying a new album. While not the best album in the world it holds its own on every song, and nearly every song is a piece unto itself.  That is a feat and if this sounds interesting to you, then I encourage you to get this album.

0345495004|1.0|I really looked forward to reading this, love all things FLW.  It was a real struggle to finish it, should have quit about 1/4 of the way through.  Very little emotional character development and there's a lot to draw from.    The end was particularly disturbing and although final for obvious reasons, very anticlimatic.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|After reading this book, I read thru some of the less flattering reviews out of curiosity.  I think it boils down to what mood you are in.  I find that my mood affects my enjoyment of certain types of books - maybe that true for some who didn't care for this.  I enjoyed it, and found myself telling my husband about parts of it that I found interesting - the historical aspects of the area, etc.  It's an enjoyable read.  The format of the letters makes a nice change - though it wasn't very realistic that all of the letters' authors would have such similar styles of writing.  It's difficult to emulate different writing styles - so that was a risk, I thought.  But I did enjoy the story, and I guess I was just in the mood for a warm story about a special place, and people who found their families among their neighbors enduring impossible hardships.  I also enjoyed the main character's willingness to reinvent herself.  I'm not necessarily always in the mood for this kind of book - but this one worked for me.
B000TGJ8CQ|1.0|#1 Cage's dye job was more distracting then the bad acting. Then again, maybe that's a good thing because it took my focus off the movie itself.  #2 Cage is way too old to be playing alongside such a yougner actress. Their relationship was really unbelievable and ridiculous.     This isn't one of Cage's better movies and not worth the price to rent or buy. I was so disappointed by thsi movie I actually feel the need to leave a review to save other unsuspecting victims.
B00168OINK|1.0|Sorry for giving this movie a 1 STAR..but if you understood the situation you would have to agree with me! I ordered the regular version on November 3rd..and received the DVD and 1 book TODAY. I do not recommend using super saver shipping if you plan to give your item as a gift! I never had a problem with the regular shipping before..BUT I was really disappointed that my first order was LOST in the mail! I was wondering why my item never arrived after almost 2.5 weeks..and I had to contact customer service. They said my item was lost in the mail and they shipped out a new order AFTER I had to contact them again to see why they haven't shipped my item (they finally shipped after 3 days of re-contacting them!). I explained that my daughter's birthday was the 30th..and the two items were gifts. Customer service shipped my item out on 2 day. It was a little too late..and the DVD case came cut up on the crease!
159102594X|4.0|I'm always so happy when I find a really good fantasy series. The last one was George RR Martin's fire and ice series. While I wouldn't place this one quite that high, it was a rolicking enjoyable ride and I went and quickly ordered the next two books.<br /><br />The Blade Itself is well written with good characters and enough twists to play with the now familiar roles and plots. We meet the tortured man who becomes a torturer, the Bloody killer who speaks to spirits and knows 'you have to be practical' but is losing that hard edge to tiredness and compassion. We meet the wizard who is both more and less than he seems, and we follow all these characters as they twist and twine.<br /><br />This is the first of a 3 part series and has good world building and a very accomplished feel for a debut book! A happy find and I'm sure that Joe Abercrombie will only get better... he's going to be an automatic buy for me.

031606792X|5.0|I started this book the day before Thanksgiving.  My daughter and I were both reading it at the same time, unfortunately, she left it at school.  She called her older sister in tears after I chewed her out (I was so looking forward to reading it over the four day weekend).  Her sister kindly drove over in the pouring rain to let us borrow her copy.  Wow, I'm so glad she did, I couldn't put it down.  Isn't it interesting that me (47), my stepdaughter (23) and my 11 year old daughter all are reading the same series.  What a phenomenon!  Yes, I know there are some minor flaws in the story but still an amazing read.
031606792X|1.0|when to leave a good thing alone.  In the case of Breaking Dawn such is the case.  While books 1-3 were quite enjoyable, book 4 becomes an insult not only to the readers but to the feel of the whole series.  It is predictable and just plain silly.  Skip this one, if you can resist the temptation of one more visit with Edward, Bella and company, and enjoy books 1-3.  Maybe, Midnight Sun (the story through Edward's point of view), if it is published, can help the author redeem herself and the series.

B000002B5L|4.0|I had this cd previously but it got misplaced. Me wanting to even purchase another one should tell you what I think of it but I'm going to put it in laymen's terms. This is one of my all-time favorite cds. My favorite track is number 4, Zealots. That is one of Lauryn Hill's best raps ever. She truly breaks it down in terms of her style and the way she sees the world. Killing Me Softly, Fugee La and Ready or Not are also on this cd, which garnered them heavy acclaim.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|I am writing to plead for someone who has purschased this item to please be specific about WHAT IS NEW ABOUT THIS EDITION.

B0000026KQ|5.0|This CD was recommened in Tom Wheelers Strat book, as an excellent example of the phenomenal range of the stratocaster guitar and the music ability of Jeff Beck. Absolutely correct.  A Jeff Beck fan or not, the pure music language and perfomance is astounding. If you are learning guitar, or desire to increase your guitar knowledge; how expansive guitar music can be, I highly recommend this CD.  I knew Jeff Beck was an excellent guitarist, did not collect his music. This CD illustrates his gift, and now I look for his CD's or contribution to a CD.
0312370849|5.0|This author is amazing.  When she ripped my heart out with her writings as seen through Sarah's eyes, I could feel the pain, the fear, and the bravery of this little girl.  At times I was not an observer, I was there.  I questioned my own ability to want to survive the horrors that Sarah saw, and lived.  This is a book I will long remember, a story, I will never forget, a time that was shameful, horrible, and inhumane.  She was right....we should never forget.  Please read this book, I promise it will touch you.
031606792X|2.0|The first few chapters were great. The wedding was beautiful, the honeymoon, all that, wonderful and you could feel the intense love between Edward and Bella again. But after that...pft...gone, all gone.    I was REALLY disappointed that she got pregnant. I got hooked on this series because of Twilight, because of the intense, albeit forbidden, love between Bella and Edward. The internal struggle that Edward faced everyday just to be near her. Wanting to be with her so badly, but the intense fear that his love may end up costing her her life. In BD we see Bella become TOTALLY entranced with becoming a mother, and then protecting that baby. I completely understand this as a mother myself....but this wasn't what I was hoping for. I wanted the same, love and passion as Twilight, ending with a marriage and all that comes with that.....that is how it should have ENDED. The baby totally screwed everything up for me. I didn't even mind Bella becoming a vampire early on. It really bothered me that the Edward and Bella relationship was TOTALLY left out of this novel after the honeymoon. It made me so sad. I am glad there was a happy ending, but I needed more Edward/Bella. I was also not happy with how Meyer changed Edwards character from the first 2 novels. She made him so self sacrificing and such a \\"goody goody\\", which is not all bad, but he is a VAMPIRE, and they are innately selfish creatures. Now, we saw from the beginning that Edward was not your typical vampire, capable of love and sacrifice, which is great and some of the reasons I loved him so much. But there WAS an element of selfishness to him (as he admitted in the first novel) because he could not stay away from Bella. I just hate that she changed him, he was perfect in Twilight. Maybe I need to read BD again to wrap my mind around it, but at this point, I am just disappointed....
1439136653|3.0|I ordered this book because i was anxious to read it before seeing the movie.  The first half of the book started off really well.  Great character description, good feel for India, and exciting story... but, unfortunately, the story became absurd and completely unrealistic... this was the major downfall.  If you want to read an exciting and incredible story based in India try the book Shantaram... you won't be disappointed!
B000022TSW|4.0|Amazing film, funny and crass in the trademark South Park style with awesome and hilarious musical numbers.  The only fiat barring it from earning five stars is because the DVD is practically barren of special features or bonus content of any kind.

6305736650|3.0|Fast ship. No problems with the shipping, but I guess I need to make sure the next time I order, that when I correct the number (total) from 2 to 1, that the web site corrects it too. Didn't need two of this item, but I paid for them, and accepted the order, even though I had changed it to say only 1, not two. I'll never make that mistake again. After editing, we must all make sure it really edits the number.
1416595546|5.0|It has been said that there were more Marxist/Leninist \\"true believers\\" on any American college campus than could be found in all of Moscow. Even today, if you visit a college campus or are a diligent reader, you will find no end of \\"academics\\" proudly proclaiming their adherence to Lenin, Stalin, Mao and other evil men. \\"Mistakes were made\\" a few of these academics may say in reference to the millions murdered and the tens, even hundreds, of millions enslaved.<br /><br />  All tryants want control of the children, so they can indoctrinate them. Whether it is the elementary school teacher or college professor or the left-wing uncle, the goal is to own the child's mind. \\"Sashenka\\" is the story of such a subverted child. And it is a story of tragedy.<br /><br />  Simon Sebag-Montefiore has written two magnificient histories of the left-wing idol, Josef Stalin, the man of steel, the tyrant who murdered millions of his own countrymen and imprisoned tens of millions more. Now, for those who can't be bothered with learning history, Montefiore attempts to convey it through fiction.<br /><br /> Baroness Alexandrsa Zeitlin, nicknamed Sashenka, is 16 years old, a budding intellectual, daughter of a rich Jewish capitalist in the St. Peterburg of 1916. Like so many bright young people, she is astoundingly gullible and has been reruited to the Communist Party by her uncle.<br /><br />  The story begins with her arrest. We quickly learn that she is known as Comrade Snowfox. Thanks to her father's connections, she is out of jail in a day, but that day will haunt her life forever.<br /><br />  The first of the three sections of the novel follows Sashenka through the return of Lenin, a time when she also comes into contact with Stalin and other future leaders and murderers of the glorious Soviet proletariat.<br /><br />  Sashenka is a true believer. Like all left-wingers, she is imbued with the belief that she and the leaders she follows are more intelligent than others and entitled to lead them, indeed compel them, to a \\"better\\" life.<br /><br />  Two decades later, Sashenka is in Moscow with her husband and two young children. Vanya, her husband, is an officer with the NKVD. To anyone with a knowledge of history, that means he wasn't as Boy Scout. To left-wingers, of course, the NKVD was the protector of the Party and State, both being the same under Communism. It is 1939 and the Terror (actually the Lesser Terror) has ended. Records released in the 1990s revealed that at least 1.9 million Soviet citizens were imprisoned for political offenses, with about 700,000 shot. Tens or hundreds of thousands of others died of torture, starvation, overwork or disease. You can find left-wing academics and others who continue to deny the truths of the Soviet archives or pass it off by saying the murders were justified.<br /><br />  Sashenka is still the true believer. But fanaticism has benefits. Sashenka need not wait in line for food; she - or her servants - shop at special Party stores. She edits a Soviet magazine. Her husband, who doesn't talk much about his work with the NKVD, works late into the night protecting Party and State from the enemies to be found everywhere.<br /><br />  At her May Day soiree, Sashenka has unexpected guests, the fading writer and possible enemy of the people, Benya Cohen, and late in the evening, Lavrenti Beria, the hesd of the NKVD and the Master himself, Comrade Stalin.<br /><br />  These unexpected guests bring disaster to Sashenka and Vanya.<br /><br />  The balance of this section plumbs the terrors of the left-wing worker's paradise. It is indeed unfortunate that so few young people being indoctrinated by their left-wing teachers and professors will never know of this book or Montefiore's even more intense histories.<br /><br />  Suffice it to say that Sashenka and Vanya become victims of the left and its political philosophy. But we don't know wht actually becomes of them. We do know, however, that their two smallchildren have been spirited away, with the help of the rarest commodity: a true friend in the left-wing paradise of the Soviet Union.<br /><br />  The final section takes place in the 1990s. A young Russian historian, Katinka Vinsky, takes the assignment of searching for an old woman's family history. All she knows is that she was adopted. Katinka's only lead is the name of old man, one of the last of the Soviet Heroes.<br /><br />  He begins her on a journey of the former Soviet Union archives which reveals to Katinka - and the reader - the history of the Soviet Union generally and the fates of Vanya and Sashenka.<br /><br />  The trivial influences that led to their personsl disasters will strike the modern, historically ignorant, reader as unbelievable.<br /><br />  This is unfortunate since ignorance of the past condemns the people to repeat it. As you look around and see the left-wing seducing America's children into their cults, \\"Sashenka\\" serves as a reminder of what happens when true beleivers are given power over the lives of others.<br /><br />  \\"Sashenka\\" is a romance and a political novel.

B00005JNJV|5.0|This is one amazing film. There is no better fleshed out Hero then Bruce Wayne aka Batman the Dark Knight. Other Superhero films touched one deep feeling of the protagonist and carried that theme throughout the film. Best example is the first Spirder-Man where the main character has to protect his secret identity in order to protect those that he loves. Peter Parker was an interesting, easy to pull off character. But what Christian Bale does for Bruce Wayne easily surpasses even Robert Downey Jr's Tony Stark. Bale gives such a performance, so much depth that he gives Bruce Wayne something that has never been seen before in all forms of Batman films, a real motive. We are given the best origin story of Bruce Wayne to really give him a meaningful backbone. He does what he does not for a loved one but because he believes in justice. Sure every Hero fights for that reason, but I have never seen so much devosion to ones work on film as Bruce Wayne's attempt to clean up Gotham.   What really suprises us is the fact that this is the first Batman film that focuses on none other than Batman. This film is given ao much life and so much hope that one might ask \\"Why doesn't someone devote their life to fight crime?\\"
B000WS4PCO|5.0|I had the cassette tape when I was younger. This is a great classic album. I just got it in CD. I would recommend it to everyone.
B00005AG7K|1.0|This release is horrible. It's just a straight copy from a VHS not a master tape. The sound quality is average and the picture quality is poor. Unless you're a desperate Beatles fanatic I'd suggest wait for an official DVD release (if ever) or rent a VHS copy from your local library and save the money.
B00000I924|5.0|This album is the first in his \\"trilogy\\" of techno/electronica output beginning in the late 1990's. And the best of the 3.('You Had It Coming', 'Jeff' are the others). It may catch you off guard at first because of the new approach. But this is pure and simple guitar genius. Like another poster commented, you either get it or you don't. I don't mean this in an arrogant fashion, I guess I should say you either like it or you don't. WARNING: This is not late 60's or 70's Beck. And God bless him for that! I consider him the best of the British Big 3 because he puts out stuff like this. He plays all over this one, you know what I mean? In all honesty there are a couple tracks that I sometimes may skip through, but there are also tunes on here that floor me every time. 'Psyco Sam' is outrageous(cool \\"vacuum cleaner\\" intro/outro!)with crazy Beck all over it. He really sounds like no one else. 'Blast From The East' is equally enjoyable if you're a Beck nut like me. 'Brush With The Blues' is a great slow tempo live cut. And too much else to mention. This is easily one of my favorite Jeff Beck albums. \\"Guitar Shop\\" is #2 imho, just to gauge where my head is at when it comes to Mr. Beck.
B000068FWC|5.0|So, I dug this outta my mp3 collection and it's grown on me so much I've been obsessively listening to it for weeks. Then I realized this mp3 \\"album\\" is actually the first real record album I ever bought, way back in 1979 when I was 13. I played it to death back then. And with everything changed in my life, so much in between, it's still really enjoyable. That's pretty cool so thought I'd toss up a review. Give it a try, apparently it's never too late for this one.
B001LMRCP2|5.0|I got this product when it was on 99 CENTS here on Amazon.com. I would have to say that Viva La Vida was alreay one of my favorite albums of all time, but this new EP makes it indefinitely just that--my favorite! This album has to be one of the only that I have not had to pick away at to get just a few good songs (with digital music these days...)<br /><br />GREAT JOB!!!
B001LMRCP2|5.0|Man, I love this. Life in Technicolor is a great peice, and the re-version is great. Lost has been remixed with some Jay-Z, and we have some new songs. Honestly, it's worth the one dollar.
B0018S6YO4|4.0|In Good Girl Gone Bad, Rihanna produced a couple of decent hits that made this album a worldwide success. However, in GGGBR, she pushed the envelope once again and introduced 3 major hit tracks, all of which have given the world good music to listen to. Unfortunately, there are some tracks on there that, because of all of the WONDERFUL track on the rest of the album, seem to me to be filler track...but still great!!!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is another childhood favorite that we always watch around Christmas! I love how everything goes wrong for the Griswold family on Christmas Eve. They have trouble with the Christmas tree because Clark forgot the chainsaw. He has all of his family members staying a few days in his house, cousin Eddie shows up, he doesn't get his Christmas bonus, the Christmas turkey blows, the tree catches on fire, and to make matters worse, Eddie kidnaps Clark's boss! If you love comedy, and Christmas, you'll love CHRISTMAS VACATION!!!
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love this cd and have been playing it ever since I bought it.  I bought the cd before I even saw the movie. My only criticism is that the best song from the movie by Robert Pattinson called Let me Sign is not on it and is nowhere to be found anywhere. There is also a Radiohead song from the In Rainbows song that is not included. I love the album anyway, though.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|I was hoping to see more of John Newton, the author of \\"Amazing Grace,\\" in the movie, but other than that it was all I expected.  It took a few minutes to sort all the characters into their place in the scheme of the movie.  The struggles of William Wiberforce to end the slave trade along with his health problems made the movie even dramatic.  The closing scene with the bagpipes is among the most touching scenes I have ever experienced with any movie.  The movie may have a few flaws, but the overall message gives it five stars plus in my book.    Jim Campbell
1401302378|4.0|This book was very easy to read in that it was straight forward and had good explanations and examples of the topic.  The title was explained from the onset and summarized the content of the book.  The remainder of the book went on to explain why Long Tail economics is happening and how it got started.  I agree with the premise of the book and can now appreciate and put a name to the changes I have seen in consumerism and my personal consumption.  This book is relevant because we are all consumers.  The number of options available, reduced costs and connecting supply and demand are a few examples of the catalysts of Long Tail economics.  Understanding why certain things are happening is also very important from the perspective of business.  Recognizing opportunities and obstacles that result from the Long Tail will encourage better decision-making and in turn more success.  Another factor that cannot be overlooked is the influence of technology.  This niche market trend has been encouraged by the increased use of technology and the new realm it has created.  Two very different markets have surfaced as a result of the Long Tail.  First, the traditional bricks and mortar approach still meets the needs of consumers, especially the desire for immediate gratification.  On-line markets on the other hand have grown the idea of niche marketing exponentially.  The ability of users to find exactly what they are looking for  and the ability of businesses to provide unlimited options to consumers has taken advantage of and promoted the expansion of the Tail.  Reduced consumer constraints, however, have begged the question of whether of not too many consumer choices is possible and what are its implications.  In some cases this seems to be true, but it will be interesting to see how this issue is addressed in the future.  On a personal level, my role as a consumer is changing.  The book identifies the increased faith in the individual and the increasing value of their input.  Various companies and markets in general are realizing the importance of and relying more heavily on the advisory role of individuals.
1594201927|3.0|well written book, good for ordinary readers with limited economics. A lot of short stories that's interesting to read.
0595440096|5.0|A truly fascinating read!  The author more than succeeds in presenting a very accurate and poignant profile of what it's like to live with younger-onset Alzheimer's disease.  Once you meet Alice, you will begin to understand just how challenging and heartbreaking this illness can be.   Lisa Genova is a very gifted author who has managed to capture the essence of both the struggle and courage that it takes to live with this devastating disease.
1595141979|5.0|This is the best book.  I was enthralled and couldn't put it down, which was bad during finals week.  The relationships that were developed were done with such intensity.  An ending that I didn't see coming and had me crying.  I had to re-read it just to make sure what I had read actually happened.  I suggest that everyone read this series.  It really makes you think about life and connections with other people.
B000002U9L|5.0|A classic I don't know any females who don't love this movie lol
B000HL2F14|3.0|Ask me several years ago about Enterprise and I would have said BLAH! It started to grow on me over the years and I wish I had given it more of a chance. I just couldn't get past the whole going back to a ship that predated the original series. Give it a chance you might be surprised!
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I'm not entirely sure what Frank exactly means. I originally thought it had to do with her blunt honesty, but a friend told me she's a huge fan of Sinatra and named her dog (I think he's the one on the cover) after him. Anyway, Amy's voice is amazing and while her vocals are reminiscent of Billie, Sarah, and Ella, she manages to pull off her own style. Something I love about this album is that it's very straight forward and what you see is what you get. Her second album Back To Black, while also good, relies too heavily on the 40's and 50's jazz sound and sometimes borders on gimmicky. Frank pulls from the past, but sounds very much of today.<br /><br />First up is the debut single \\"Stronger Than Me\\". Over a wobbly hip hop beat, Amy complains about her \\"lady boy\\" who needs to man up and stop letting her be the guy in the relationship. Amy's personality shines through and makes this an enjoyable track. \\"You Sent Me Flying\\" starts off with a disco meets piano beat and is carried by a vocal brimming with regret. Amy getting kicked to the curb never sounded so good. Who knew? \\"Cherry\\" at first sounds like a relationship with the another girl, but has a twist no one saw coming.<br /><br />\\"Take The Box\\" is the first song I ever heard from this album and got me hooked. With a shout out to Frank (the dog or the singer) in the chorus, Amy sings about a love affair that has ended badly, but she can't completely let her guy go. The music is top notch and intoxicating. \\"In My Bed\\" finds the singer letting a guy know that she only wants sex from him, but not his heart over a Nas beat. I read that it was a single and it deserved to be. I can't compare Amy's cover of \\"Moody's Mood for Love\\" to any others, but this reggae tinged song is a highlight. \\"There Is No Greater Love\\" is just a love song. Not to weed or booze, but to a guy. Weird, I know. I love the late night cricket chirping feel to the production.<br /><br />In \\"I Heard Love Is Blind\\", Amy makes excuses for her cheating ways. \\"It's ok, honey. I thought about you when I came.\\" I wonder how that one went over. \\"October Song\\" is a bouncy, bright tribute to her deceased bird who is now \\"reborn like Sarah Vaughan\\". She can even make a song about her dead bird sound amazing. By the end of the album, Amy seems tired of her hunger for bad men in the hip-hop influenced \\"What Is It About Men\\", but she falls for another one on the \\"Chicago\\" sounding \\"Amy Amy Amy\\". When will this girl learn?<br /><br />Two gripes from me. One, I liked \\"Pumps\\" on the first few listens, but now I just skip it. Very little replay value for me. Second, the fact that both hidden tracks (which I love) are literally hidden behind \\"Amy Amy Amy\\" and the outro. Why not make them separate tracks? And where is the World War II era sounding \\"Help Yourself\\"? Anyway, \\"Brother\\" is a heartfelt track about the singer's own troubled sibling and \\"Mr. Magic\\" adds beautiful lyrics to Grover Washington's 70's instrumental classic.<br /><br />I really hope that Amy will clean up her life and return to this type of music. She has too much talent to let it all go to waste.y.

B0007MWZEK|4.0|I love my swivel sweeper and I've read a LOT of reviews on this.  People are under the impression that it's the battery that goes bad after a while.  It does appear that way BUT, that's not really the problem.  I bought a new battery and it didn't work any better than the old one.  I then found the SS on clearance for $15 (with coupon discount) so I bought another.  I tested both the old battery and the new in the new unit and there was no difference.  The problem is that the cleaning unit itself builds up dirt.  My husband took the whole assembly apart on the old unit cleaned and lubed it and now it is working almost like new with either the old or new batteries.  Try it!
B0008ENICU|5.0|I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it.  It wasn't until the end that it hit me -- there were no men in the actual scenes.  Men were the main subject, but it was all women.  A great cast of women from the 30's & 40's.  The costumes are great (what it must have looked like in color when they filmed it -- wow!).  This is one of my favorite films.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|David---I love the CD!!! I also love Analog Heart and your other self titled Cd.   I listen to them every day, along with the American Idol songs that I bought.  Now I will be listening to this new album every day!!!   You always have the BEST lyrics and sound.  My daughter and I play and sing your original songs on keyboard.  Steven Tyler was once my favorite rock singer, but now you are THE ONE!!!  Thank You for being &#34;you&#34;---don't change a thing.
B0015AARJI|4.0|I purchased this as a present for my husband, and am mostly happy with what I have. As many reviews have stated, Dualshock is a much better experience for playing games than the original sixaxis.    My only complaint is that it doesn't come with a USB cord to charge it. That being said, the great thing about PS3 is that it isn't proprietary and will take any usb cord.     Overall, a good purchase.
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|With all the hype around Katy Perry, I had to check out what all the fuss is about. I recently acquired a copy of her cd ONE OF THE BOYS. I honestly didn't have any expectations for the album except maybe to not like it since I don't listen to pop music for most of the time. Much to my surprise, I found myself enjoying ONE OF THE BOYS. It is a fun, infectious pop/rock album and nothing more than that for me. The silly lyrics for the most part doesn't bother me but they do get on my nerves on songs like \\"Ur So Gay\\" and \\"I Kissed a Girl\\" (which has outstayed its welcome in pop culture IMO). My personal favorite songs on the album is \\"Waking Up in Vegas\\" and the anthemic \\"Hot 'N Cold\\". I especially like the infectious pop hooks in \\"Hot 'N Cold\\". Katy Perry has a pretty decent voice although there are times on the cd when she is better off turning it down a notch or two on the wailing. Overall ONE OF THE BOYS is a fun album, flawed but still fun.
B0002PZVHK|4.0|Eno makes great background music, I buy every CD of his that I can find.
159102594X|5.0|I began fantasy about 5 months ago (\\"The Name of the Wind\\") and can't seem to pull myself away from the genre (nothing seems to compare when you're looking for character development and plot). This trilogy is fantastic. I must admit that I was doubting the book/trilogy as I read the first few chapters of \\"The Blade Itself\\", yet it slowly picked up momentum and held my interest. After finishing all three books, I see Abercrombie's genius in starting slow and building his characters and plots across the three books; the ever-gaining momentum made Book 3 such a fun read. Abercrombie has spectacularly real characters with very real flaws and personal struggles, yet he does his character development with a certain subtlety and charm. I hate when books give you inane, cliched details that scream \\"This is character development, and this character sure is boring!\\" There is none of that in the \\"First Law\\" series, and most development is masterfully done through character action/inaction/interaction/introspection. Glokta is particularly memorable, and is one of my favorite characters ever (he is so self-effacing, cynical, realistic, and self-aware you can't help but love and understand him by the end of book 3).     All-in-all, if you love character and plot development, you should definitely give this series a shot. A word of warning: this is a dark fantasy with a lot of very well-orchestrated, vivid fight scenes, so it's not for the weak of heart. It also has quite a bit of very crass language (used to drive scene and character development), so it might not be for the easily offended as well.
1402714580|5.0|I just recieved this book in the mail.  I had purchased it to give as a gift to my daughter, who is 17, as a gift for Christmas.  I was so impressed when I opened the package.  It is a beautiful book!  Perfect to give as a gift!
0765350386|5.0|Other reviewers have done a great job with synopsis, etc, so I just wanted to say I love the \\"Mistborn\\" series! Great characters (nice to have a female lead), great story, great magic...I can't wait to (finally) read book 3. This series inspired me to be Valette, your honorable courtly assassin, for Halloween this year :)     (and yes, my costume included a pouch of \\"jumping coins\\" and vials of \\"allomantic metals\\"...too much fun, even though 100% of the people didn't get the reference)
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I lost track of how many times I watched this online.  I'm sure I've watched it more than anything else I've ever seen - and loved it every time.  This has all the great tunes, acting, and dialogue and also has the classic Whedon attention to detail.  The production values are worthy of a modern tv show, which is unheard of on the internet.  I can't wait to see all of the extras.  Felicia Day (Penny) said in an online interview that some of the songs in the singing commentary are even better than those in the original production.  This is what I'm getting all my friends and family for Christmas this year.
B00000DHZJ|5.0|My mom gave a used copy of it to me as a Christmas present a while ago, and later I got the albums that all of the tracks from this album are on.  This title definitely lives up to it's name in one sense.  It primarily has his most popular recordings and with this album, you really do experience Hendrix.  The real thing that I should mention is that this is the perfect Jimi Hendrix album to start out with.<br /><br />This album begins with what is probably Hendrix's most well known song \\"Purple Haze,\\" the song that got his start \\"Hey Joe,\\" his one-hit-wonder by technicality/tribute to Bob Dylan \\"All Along the Watchtower,\\" \\"Voodoo Child (Slight Return),\\" his classic performance of \\"The Star-Spangled Banner,\\" and it even includes some of his posthumously released tracks put onto First Rays of the New Rising Sun.<br /><br />Is this the only Jimi Hendrix album to get?  NO!!! NO!!! NO!!!  In fact, I personally prefer Jimi Hendrix's posthumously released live albums, such as Live at Berkley (The Second Set), Blue Wild Angel: Live at the Isle of Wight, and Live at Woodstock (not just the national anthem but the whole album).<br /><br />Hendrix was a lot more than just the well-known songs.  However, this is a great album to start out with, and it's a great way to have Hendrix on a single disc.  It's too bad I gave my copy away, which is why I put it on my wish list.
1416562605|4.0|It's a good book.  I don't know whether all the hype is justified though.  I like how it's structured as a series of letters to the Chinese Premier.  It's a novel way to write a... novel.  The main character is an interesting guy/sociopath with a penchant for learning from his \\"masters\\" and he learns very well how to work the corrupt system.  I think the key point to the story is when he decides that what happens to his family as a result of his actions doesn't matter to him.  That's the part that left me chilled - more than the murder of his boss.  The murder is often cited as the high point, or most exciting part of the book, but I think it's more telling about the character that he knows his family will be killed/tortured as a result and he does it anyway.  Good book, but not quite enough for five stars.
B000EWBKM6|5.0|This is the best Will & Grace and SO WORTH getting.    I hated the series  ended though, but I have (and will) watch this one over and over!!
B000MNP2KI|3.0|My interest in James Bond died the day I saw Pierce Brosnan shoot a machinegun.  Gone were the careful headshots of a man who was an expert with his pistol.  Replacing that deadly accuracy was frenetic scenes, random gunfire, and Bond bending the laws of reality.  The Bond films had become a parody of themselves.<br /><br />Enter Casino Royale, which makes up for the shambling travesty that was the Casino Royale Bond spoof.  Daniel Craig takes on the role of Bond as a newbie, a newbie who is a ruthless killer.  Gone are the delicate acrobatics that were the trademark of other Bonds.  This Bond is a hulking brute, smashing through walls, ruthlessly shooting people, and otherwise achieving his missions through sheer brute force. It seems jarring at first, but this is the origin of Bond, from thug to international assassin.<br /><br />The plot, bound by the rules of the original novel, doesn't entirely make sense.  Why the entire world, including both the U.S. and British authorities, feel that beating a criminal at a card game is the best way to coerce him is beyond me.  But if you're willing to buy into that fact (a requisite, really, for the spy genre where nothing is ever so simple and direct) then the film has a certain cadence to it that really enthralls.<br /><br />Until the end.  The part where, we are led to believe, Bond is going to settle down with Vesper Lynd, a treasury agent, in Venice.  Yeah, right.<br /><br />About ten minutes could have been cut from this scene alone.  We get that Bond is enamored with Lynd, that he wants to give it all up for her, but after the torture, the shooting, the gambling, the chasing, the movie becomes something of a snore until it picks up again.  And then we're off to the beginning of another movie, with no resolution whatsoever.<br /><br />Casino Royale is a much improved film, but it's the foundation for the Bond mythology, and as such it breaks previous expectations and struggles to establish new ones. It's much better than the Bond films that went before it, but they set the bar pretty low.  As a book-end to Quantum of Solace, Casino Royale can't be really appreciated without seeing the two movies back-to-back.but they set the bar pretty low.  As a book-end to Quantum of Solace, Casino Royale can't be really appreciated without seeing the two movies back-to-back.
B001GQACGE|1.0|I am a huge Beyonce fan and must say that this cd is definately not what i expected. I'm sure she will receive many awards due to the fact that she is Beyonce; but true fans know better. I am also upset that she comes with so many different versions of her cd's. I mean how many times does she want us to purchase the same cd and what's the point? It'a like punishment. This could have all been put on one cd. She has definately gotten a big ego to put this out.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Writer/director Andrew Stanton goes boldly where men and women have been longing for Pixar to go: space, the promising frontier. I can just imagine all of the beloved geeks at Pixar scrambling to get their audio/visual reference to their favorite sci-fi novel or flick onto the desktop of this film. Sitting in the theater opening night, we note that when Jim Reekes' infamous Mac start up C chord played as Wall-E recharged, the room broke into cheers and applause.  Reason # 1 to buy Wall-E: Watching this DVD gives allows us to fulfill the geek challenge -- counting the variations on a theme by Straus (Also Sprach Zarathustra) and finding the additional film cross references i.e. Star Wars, 2001, Star Trek, and even One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest gets a nod!  Reason # 2 to buy Wall-E: For those who are not sci-fi fans, Wall-E will still hold your heart with it's endearing story lines, ever present excellent Pixar character development. Each supporting robot still serves a purpose and has a personality as well as a specific sound.   Which leads us to Reason # 3 to buy Wall-E: Sound Design. This is an Oscar category Wall-E can't lose, and is the BEST additional feature of the DVD: animation sound design. This juicy presentation is where the average film viewer gets to meet Ben Burtt, the sound design creative genius behind, not only Wall-E, but the sound FX on ET, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and The Dark Crystal!  Reason # 4 to buy Wall-E: It's an excellent family film. Once again Pixar gives us an animation classic that the entire family can enjoy. An interesting note is how for the first 40 minutes everyone is entertained without verbal dialogue therefore reemphasizing what a visual society we have become.   Reason # 5 to buy Wall-E: The third disc includes a bonus digital copy of the film to drop onto your iPod for those spontaneous feel good moment needs anywhere. Oh, yes -- there is that subtle cross reference to Apple's iPod as Wall-E watches Michael Crawford, before he became the Phantom of the Opera, sing \\"It Only Takes a Moment\\" from Hello Dolly.  And finally, Wall-E reminds us how the simple gesture of holding someone's hand can make us feel more secure in an ever changing world...or how to propel yourself across the universe with a fire extinguisher.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|it was fine i guess. i got my movie when it said i would get it, so no problems here i suppose.
0061537934|5.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain is the purported tale of a dog watching his master Denny grow up. Denny marries Eve and they eventually have Zoe. The dog watches this, sad that he cannot communicate his love, trust, and observations of life to those around him. A malformed mouth and lack of opposable thumbs doom him, he supposes. His master is a racecar driver (among other talents), and the dog and master love watching racing movies together. Trust, abandonment, renewal, redemption - life is all about that. It's like racing in the rain - exhilarating, but be careful of the slick curves you encounter.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|The soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous! The music has a dark and commanding feel, almost like you can feel the epic battles ensuing while it plays.   Like A Dog Chasing Cars is phenomenal. The rhythmic and strong pulses it gives.. beautiful. Definitely one of the best soundtracks out there! But then, how can it not be? It was mastered by the two best film composers there are.

B001CDLATE|5.0|I just finished watching Baraka tonight and put in Discovery Atlas China randomly, for a change of moods. Wow! What a difference! Baraka puts Discovery China to shame, which made me wonder if I was even watching an HD presentation. Baraka's colors were vibrant and crisp. Discovery China was lifeless and dull by comparison, with noticeable interlacing. If I had put in another Blu-ray, the difference might not have been so stark, and here are the reasons why:<br /><br />Baraka was lovingly remastered and restored using a very expensive and time-consuming 8K scanning process, which is advertised on the box and explained on the disc in a short video. This BD transfer was remastered from the original 70mm negatives at the highest possible resolution available today in a special film scanner at FotoKem, supposedly the only one of its kind in existence. Scanning the film into the machine alone took 3 continuous weeks, even before restoration could begin.<br /><br />Oversampled at 8192 pixels per row (that's where the \\"8K\\" in the 8K Ultra-digital process comes from), the transfer was then cleaned up, color-corrected, restored, and then downsampled for Blu-ray. (Full HD is about 1/4th the resolution of the original scan, at 1920 pixels per row.) Some of this may just be techno-bragging and silly marketing, but the results are clear. Baraka is arguably the best looking Blu-ray on the market, and the 8K process is well worth the effort and expense. I hope other studios will follow suite and devote this level of care to a release.<br /><br />As for the film itself, its main themes are the universality of the human experience, the diversity of human life, and timelessness. There's no narration or text, so if you're the type who has to have everything blow up, it's best to avoid this disc.<br /><br />The music, likewise, is timeless, unlike Chronos which has a New Age soundtrack that can get annoying and sounds dated. The music in Baraka has some japanese flute pieces, orchestral pieces, and other ethnic sounds, but nothing terribly memorable. My only issue with Baraka is the paperboard case that it comes in. The disc slips into a slot, which greatly increases the change of scratching. I understand the environmental-friendliness of this decision, but would prefer a better packaging design.<br /><br />It would've been nice to have an audio track for commentary from Ron Fricke or the producers, because some of the images need explaining, or at least identification as to where in the world they are.<br /><br />If you want drool material, this is it.ds, but nothing terribly memorable.

B001GKJ2E8|3.0|Angelina Jolie is the central reason to watch this film.  she soaks up every scene.  she's grand.  some say \\"too thin\\" but i think she looks fab.  love her slender, feng shui body.  it's high-style.  but more seriously, she radiates.      Her essence exudes from every pore.  she is beyond sexy, not that she's ultra-sexy, but that she is beyond human sex.  she's other-worldly.  Jolie fans will know what i mean.  you may desire intimacy with her, but much more, beyond that, you want to BE her.  i mean, you want to be what it is you imagine she possesses ad infinitum.  think on that superficialism.    As for Wanted: guns, gadgets, Special effects, and mood.  turn on, tune in, and enjoy the senseless ride.  it's absurd, to be sure, but you will not mind with Jolie at the helm.    (hope this didn't help. haha)
0375842209|5.0|I read this book based on a friend's recommendation and I absolutely loved it.  Zusak's style of writing, I found, was incredibly original.  A definite page turner.  I can't believe that people found this book to be confusing -- maybe out of the ordinary, but that was the beauty of it.  A definite must read for adults.
0316017922|4.0|I am an unabashed fan of Malcolm Gladwell's books. I enjoy his style of writing and admire his ability to not only dig up fascinating stories and statistics, but to weave them together into a cohesive whole. Blink and The Tipping Point were both excellent books that, even if not particularly deep, offered popular-level introductions into topics all of us experience but few of us think about. It is little wonder, really, that Gladwell's books are perennial bestsellers. At the moment I write this review, all three of his titles are firmly fixed on the New York Times list of Bestsellers.<br /><br />Gladwell's third book, released just a couple of weeks ago, is Outliers: The Story of Success. Here he attempts to shed fresh light on success, asking why some people succeed while others never reach their potential. He takes the view that--our love of the \\"self made man\\" notwithstanding--success is rarely only a product of ability and motivation. Instead, he says, success comes to those who are \\"invariably the beneficiaries of hidden advantages and extraordinary opportunities and cultural legacies that allow them to learn and work hard and make sense of the world in ways others cannot.\\" In other words, we are all products of hidden forces, advantages and disadvantages, culture, upbringing and even plain dumb luck. He points to \\"practical intelligence,\\" (known also as \\"emotional intelligence\\") as a force that often separates two people who otherwise may appear equal in every way. And, of course, there is the value of hard work--just as your mother told you, practice really does make perfect. Pardon my laziness as I quote from a story at the New York Times. \\"Many people, I think, have an instinctual understanding of this idea (even if Gladwell, in the interest of setting his thesis against conventional wisdom, doesn't say so). That's why parents spend so much time worrying about what school their child attends. They don't really believe the child is so infused with greatness that he or she can overcome a bad school, or even an average one. And yet when they look back years later on their child's success -- or their own -- they tend toward explanations that focus on the individual. Devastatingly, if cheerfully, Gladwell exposes the flaws in these success stories we tell ourselves.\\"<br /><br />In all of Gladwell's books, I've been drawn to the stories and trivia he relies on to illustrate his points. I enjoyed these elements in Outliers as much as in his previous two titles. However, where I felt that in the other books the illustrations served to further his point, here I often felt that they actually were his point. If you are like me, you will enjoy reading about the great advantage hockey players have if they are born on the first few months of the year and will enjoy finding out why Korean pilots are historically the worst in the world (especially if, as I do, you have Korean friends to share this information with). But you may also find yourself a little bit disappointed that Gladwell never really comes to any great and grand conclusions. Neither does he offer any substantial answers to many of the questions raised by the book. Then again, maybe that is precisely the point. Maybe this is not a self-help book, trying to release us from the simple fact that success is more than motivation and ability. Perhaps it simply teaches us what is inevitable, what is just one of life's realities--that we are more than our desires and more than our innate talents and abilities. There is always more to a success story than what comes immediately to the eye, but these factors are not easily reproduced, even if we can understand them.<br /><br />Outliers struck me as being a bit more derived from other books than his previous titles. I am not convinced that there is a whole lot here that hasn't already been said by others (though I'll grant that these others did not write books that sold in the millions of copies). I guess this just proves Gladwell's point, though. It is not always the most original or most talented or most motivated who see success. This is illustrated well in the review of Outliers printed in the New York Times. Gladwell, like anyone who has tasted success, is the product of all kinds of forces and factors that have combined to make him what he is. \\"It is not the brightest who succeed...nor is success simply the sum of the decisions and efforts we make on our own behalf. It is, rather, a gift. Outliers are those who have been given opportunities -- and who have had the strength and presence of mind to seize them.\\"<br /><br />I greatly enjoyed Outliers and have no trouble recommending it alongside Gladwell's other titles. It is good for us, I think, to examine success and to understand that things are not always as they seem on the surface. By digging a little deeper than the myth of the self-made man, we are better equipped to understand the forces that, combined together, lead some people to great success while leaving others in obscurity.<br /><br />Outliers is a good, light read. I can't imagine that it will change too many lives, but neither does it need to. It is a fun and harmless diversion that offers enough \\"A-ha!\\" moments to be worth reading, but not so many that it is difficult to plow through. I think it makes for perfect holiday reading.not always the most original or most talented or most motivated who see success.

0439023483|5.0|This book is beautifully written and it isn't all doom and gloom. Underneath all of the obvious descriptions of a world filled with loss, danger, poverty, and despotism is a theme about the different kinds of love (husband/wife, mother/daughter, sisters, strangers, community) that inspires hope and its ability to overcome the impossible. If it wasn't for Peeta's love for Katniss (he saved her life even before the games), or Thresh's appreciation for what she did for Rue, or Cinna's compassion, Katniss would not have made it through the hunger games. This theme is beautifully expressed when Katniss describes her connection to Peeta as \\"the boy with the bread\\" which gave her hope that she isn't going to starve and \\"yellow dandelions\\" that tells her she isn't doomed. My prediction for the sequel is that together with Peeta, she will spread the hope for a brighter future (where she can have children and live her life without fear) to the rest of the districts, take down the captiol, and live happily ever after (with Peeta, obviously). I can't wait to read the sequel.
B00005YU1O|5.0|This is an excellent movie if you want to think.  This movie had me thinking about life in completely different ways.  Not only is the dialogue compelling, but the visuals are trippy - emphasizing even more what the movie is about.
0765348276|5.0|No, I haven't read it. I bought the audible version and was blown away! Now i love to read, but some books are just better when well read in audiobook format. I've read books then purchased the audio version and let me tell you, when it's good it's great! This was an outstanding audiobook, the narration was superb and the characters really came to life. There are some books that are ruined by bad narrators, and even more that are enhanced, this one has been played so many times that my mp3 player groans in disgust. I drive for a living so audiobooks are an important staple for me, with a library of over four hundred titles i have multiple ipods in service, this book is on each.<br />If you've already read the book, try it at audible. It's an addictive habit.
B001DTPZNY|5.0|Loved it!  Every bit as good as the first and third movies, and better than the second.  Action, adventure, humor and a terrific mix of actors joining Indy and his fedora.  I'll watch it again and again. A+++
0143037757|5.0|I lived through through the Postwar Years but never understood what was happening to the extent this book shows.  It's a huge book (830 pages) but reads like a novel.  I'll keep it forever as a reference, and loan it out whenever possible.  It's a great value.
0142412147|5.0|This is my new all-time favorite book. I bought it and finished it that week. It starts out like, 'I'm Jubilee. I'm not a stripper. My parents are in jail over a ceramic holiday village' and just gets better and better. I usually read books that are relatable (Real word?) but this is... out there. I mean, I wish I had the lovey-dovey part, but it's not often you have to walk a few miles in a storm, racing to bring Twister to a Waffle House...  Overall, I give this 5 stars, at least. Its cute, lol-funny, and romantic. SO PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE FOR ME BUY IT AND READ IT AND ENJOY IT AND BE COOL.

0743298039|5.0|It's hard to categorize this book.  Is it a mystery?  Yes, in a way it's a mystery.  The Thirteenth Tale is ALSO a ghost story.  But not a ghost story about ghouls and goblins and specters.  It's a story about ghosts of the past, loss, regrets and tales left unfinished.    Margaret Lea, a lover of books and somewhat of a writer herself is asked to write the true life story of one of England's most beloved and reclusive writers, Vida Winter.  People adore her books but know little about the author and what they do know are just stories manufactured by Ms. Winter.  Why does she weave fiction instead of telling facts of her own life to her loving fans?  Why, she's a story teller naturally!    The thirteenth tale refers to a story by Ms. Winter that was never published.  One of her most beloved books was supposed to contain thirteen short stories and was named as such, but when published, the book only contained TWELVE stories.  This book reads like the thirteenth and previously unpublished story of Vida Winter herself and a host of other characters in the book.    It's difficult to narrow down what I enjoyed so much about this book.  The characters are all mysterious in their own way, each with their own story to tell.  Each page answers questions asked previously as well as bringing up more questions that beg to be answered.  The reader's taken through a detailed account of Vida's life from a young girl to her current state as England's most appreciated (and ailing) author.    During the course of Ms. Winter's dictation of her life's events to Margaret, we learn more of Margaret's past and we also see how she gets completely consumed by Vida's mysterious past, family and home.    The most impressive thing about this book is how tightly it is plotted and how satisfyingly it wraps up.  No character is abandoned by the end of the book.  We learn what happens to each and every one of them.    As I said, this is a great book ABOUT stories, both reading them and inventing them.  It's easy to get lost in this one as Setterfield weaves a great tale that is easy to get engrossed in.
B001GZ6QC4|2.0|CONTAINS SPOILERS.  Screenwriter David Goyer said the theme of BATMAN BEGINS is fear, and that of THE DARK KNIGHT is escalation.  I agree on BB, but feel the main TDK theme is morality.  TDK shows Batman standing for purposeful combating of violent crime with disciplined action that forbids killing.  The Joker stands for obliterating morality and all ethical principles by chaos and wanton destruction.  The Joker does everything he can to get Gotham's people to betray all moral principles, in his grim and brutal quest to prove no one holds principles -- therefore indicating an amoral and ludicrous world.<br /><br />At least Christopher Nolan has taken Batman to FAR higher artistic ground than the live-action portrayals between Tim Burton's and his.  There's something in TDK for a lot of people except little kids, unless they've become very numbed and desensitized by abundant portrayals of viciousness and violence.  If we want a lot of ugly grit, TDK has truckloads.  If we want heroism, there's some here and there with Bruce Wayne/Batman, Lucius Fox, Jim Gordon, Rachel Dawes, even Harvey Dent, and even some less important individuals.  If we want less brutality -- well, there are other movies or conceivable editions of this one that could help it a lot.<br /><br />The most touching part of the movie for me is the high tragedy of Harvey Dent -- and also that he dies!  NO!!  I really cared about Harvey.  I pulled for him while watching his ideals, his bravery, his commitment, and his character flaws degrade him into the Joker's world of madness, chaos and hopelessness.  The Joker won with Harvey, but lost with Batman and also with enough good citizens of Gotham, including with even some of its criminals.  But the morality drama plays on.  Will the Joker corrupt enough good people?  Will Batman weaken and betray his principles?  Is life senseless, purposeless, chaotic, ridiculous, insignificant?  Or can there be purpose, heroism, and progress even in the darkest hours?  Can Harvey Dent be resurrected!<br /><br />I'm not surprised Christopher Nolan confided he'd like to stop doing Batman movies.  As I see it, grimness and brutality can go only so far in eclipsing drama, adventure, and heroism born of more imagination and intrigue -- before wearing even a maker's morale and energy down.  Alfred Hitchcock could make us tensely sit on the edge of our seats for an hour or more, just waiting for one gunshot, with far less sprays of violence to cover up assorted plot weaknesses typical of so many action films.  And this brings me to issues I take with TDK, and because of which I'd prefer a greatly cut version.  In fact, there was so much of the Clown Prince of Crime in this film, it really should've been called THE JOKER.  Batman seems only an incidental character.<br /><br />-  The film is far too long -- by over half an hour.  A lot of repetitive stuff in simply different guises.<br />-  The Scarecrow is completely unnecessary.<br />-  The phony Batmen do nothing to help the story.<br />-  Drama, tragedy, and heroism could be much better with less unrelenting and numbing brutality.<br />-  Who would follow a Joker who has his henchmen routinely kill each other?  Too incredible.<br />-  How can the Joker's obviously hundreds of henchmen pull off so many huge coups without a single hitch? Again, too incredible.<br />-  How could the Joker's thugs so easily overpower many armed cops without even some noisy struggle that attracts attention?<br />-  Where does Gordon come from, on a deserted street, to suddenly pop up and arrest the Joker? Sloppy scripting and directing.<br />-  The more high-tech a Batman suit looks, the less organic and the less gut scary.<br /><br />Those things said:<br /><br />-  Great skyhook sequence.<br />-  Good recovery of Rachel's character, interest and appeal compared to BEGINS.<br />-  Heath Ledger is scary, insane, Oscar-deserving -- but not a wacky, cackling Joker.<br />-  Thrilling Bat-Pod sequences.<br />-Amusing with a would-be blackmailer.<br /><br />Again, there might be some things in TDK for various tastes -- although many folks like yours truly don't want so much wading through it, and the resultant huge boredom.  I hope No. 3 will be less wantonly brutal, more imaginative, have a much more comic-book-inspired armored Batman outfit, and be MUCH tighter put together.astes -- although many folks like yours truly don't want so much wading through it, and the resultant huge boredom.

B001GKJ2DY|5.0|I loved this movie. It was so enjoyable that I watch it 6 times. The only thing but didn't Meryl Streep seem a little old playing the mother of a teenager daughter. Perhaps more of a grandmother?
B001437DMA|5.0|The more you hear, the more you like!  I really appreciate, more and more only real music. I dont speak about 'guitar' or voice things,  but tone, note and melody are what I seek for.  Beethoven, Bach, Mozart and Satriani are for me really similar. It's good, very good music.  I don't see Satriani as only a guitarist (and don't think Satriani considers himself as a guitarist), he's a modern true musician.   He does music as Mozart was doing music but only with contemporary instruments.  When you compare others 'guitarits' with him, they are so far away musically speaking, they may produce one or two good songs but what of their entire work? They don't have the regularity of Satch albums.  And I think the master continue to improve with time. I think his 2 first albums are his worst albums and that he began doing good compositions with 'Flying in a blue dream'.  I didn't really like this last album at first. But then I began to appreciate it and now I love it (similar thing with classical music, it's so complex than at first you dont enter in the music and then...)  So maybe if I had done this review after the first hearing, I would have scored the album a 3 stars.  But I continued to listen and now I give it an excellent 5 stars. Of course it's not a perfect album (none of Satch are perfect and nothing at all is perfect anyway).   But it's far better than the other music available.
B000J103PC|5.0|This movie is terrific. Again as for Meryl Streep who is about 60 playing a mother of 2 young girls just didn't fit. Perhaps their grandmother would have been more realistic.
143911000X|5.0|As a big fan of the show, I would often reference the \\"Bro Code\\" quotes from the show and said it would be very cool if they actually did have a written log of said rules and bro-etiquette. I was very happy when I came across this copy while at work and immediately made the purchase, It is very fun to read and highly informative. Neil Patrick Harrison's portrayal of Barney Stinson will be among the ultimate television Bro's in history including \\"The Fonz\\", \\"Magnum P.I.\\" & \\"Joey Tribiany\\"
B0000TB01Y|5.0|After seeing the play in Atlanta at the Fox Theater, I couldn't wait to buy the CD. Amazon.com did not disappoint! I bought a mint unopened CD for a fraction of the cost, with no hassle, and fast delivery.  I love the music.. I relive the experience every time I listen to the CD.
B00009W0U4|3.0|Everything that needs to be said about this movie has been said.  However, I just wanted to throw out there that the Death-by-fire extinguisher scene wasn't so unwatchable that I wanted to turn off the movie or vomit.  The Rape scene was NOT as graphic as others I have seen on other (Hollywood) movies.  The movie itself was decent, but the beginning was pretty wild, and did almost make me puke out of pure motion sickness.
B000002UB3|5.0|For me, Abbey Road is the Beatles' masterpiece. The Beatles were the Beatles because, while they embraced rock, they also transcended it...attaining a kind of lyrical quality that few, if any, from the Rock era achieved...and Abbey Road is the ultimate manisfestation of that. In a sense it is a bitter-sweet experience for me to listen to it: sweet because it is so impressive; bitter because it signifies what they could achieve...yet this was their last album before they split. Ah! the what-could-have-beens....
B000002J0P|5.0|What more can be said about this album?   It is vintage Crosby,   Stills and Nash at their best!

B0010VD7EO|3.0|I listen to a lot of different genres of music. I recently heard MGMT's \\"time to pretend,\\" and was very compelled to buy the CD. I normally don't buy CD's, but I found myself in a store that sells them (and I had consumed some lunch beers). I decided to roll with my inclination.<br />I popped the disk in almost immediately, on my way home, and reconfirmed that I like \\"Time to Pretend.\\" I was also really grooving on \\"Electric Feel,\\" but to my disappointment these are the only two songs that are unique and very enjoyable. The rest of the album sounds totally different. I don't really see what they are going for here. Some of it seems almost like a mockery of some very influential classic rock bands. I would have to recommend against buying the whole album. I would also have to recommend that this band do more drugs.... A LOT MORE DRUGS.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I don't really mind the original triggers, but figured these would be a little nicer. I'm pretty impressed with these. Perfect addition for your PS3. They feel very comfortable and don't make it feel weird like I was worried about being used to the the way they are already. They attach easily and come off when you try to get them off. I've had one fall off while having the controller packed up in a duffel bag, but it wasn't exactly stored nicely, so I can't fault the product.
B0016Q2D5M|3.0|The movie itself was very entertaining. I was very disappointed in the 3D effects however. The left eye worked fine completely blocking out the right eye's magneta images but the right eye always left some green image resulting in a double image effect no matter how much I changed the tint,color, brightness and contrast on my High Def TV.  I would recommend the Blu-Ray 2D version but not the 3D because of the double vison.
B001ED7C58|5.0|Most soundtracks aren't that great, but this is one that you can listen to over and over again!  I bought it yesterday (Tuesday) and have been listening to it non-stop.  The music is great!!!!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I heard of \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog,\\" and wanted to see it, but didn't think I'd get the chance to; I don't watch many shows on the Internet, and a three-part Internet only \\"series\\"...well, that was just out of my league.  Fortunately, I got the chance.  And it was as hilarious as I expected.<br /><br />Dr. Horrible (Harris) wants to join the Evil League of Evil...the only problem is, he's essentially a geek with a bunch of gadgets, who has a crush on Penny (Day), but is too shy to talk to her.  Plus, he's up against Captain Hammer (Fillion), a jerk in a suit who has taken it upon himself to woo Penny by becoming the \\"Sheriff of Poverty\\" and helping her establish a homeless shelter.  All of this combines to force Dr. Horrible to plan something that is so horrible, it overflows with its horribleness...<br /><br />I discovered Joss Whedon via \\"Serenity,\\" which led me to \\"Firefly,\\" which then made me a huge fan of Nathan Fillion.  (That's right: I'm not a cult follower of Whedon's, which I like to think makes me an unbiased reviewer here.)  So, without having seen everything Whedon's done, I can't say this is the funniest bit of cinema in his catalogue; but it's certainly the funniest thing I've seen, from anyone, recently.  It's pitch-perfect humor: We sympathize with the villain and hate the hero, and it's all to great comedic effect.  Neil Patrick Harris is hilarious; Nathan Fillion is so subtle, it makes you wonder why he hasn't become a comedy film star; and Felicia Day is just so darned loveable, we hate the fact that she loves Hammer, and yearn for her to get with Dr. Horrible.  The singing isn't perfect, but it doesn't have to be; it's hilarious, and that's all that matters.<br /><br />I guess \\"Dr. Horrible\\" is a bit of a pet project for Whedon and these actors; well, that's absolutely astounding, considering Hollywood rarely puts out something this amusing.  Kudos to the entire crew, and I pray they get their money back with the DVD release.  They certainly deserve it; and \\"Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" deserves to go down as a cult comedy classic.. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog\\" deserves to go down as a cult comedy classic.
B0000024W3|4.0|A great album needlessly attack by proto-hipsters, hippies, and pseudo-intellectuals for staying far apolitical during the turbulent time at the end of the sixties. In fact, for that reason alone is why this album ages so well.    Protest music or any remotly political art from the sixties tend to age poorly. The fact that Dylan, in the midst of all these problems, constructs a very, very happy and joyful album would bound to upset people. Pseudo-intellectuals tend to veer away from the positive and tend to embrace something more serious or depressing, saying if it's joyful it can't be great art.    This album is mostly covers, a couple of originals, and a few re-records of his classic songs. We get a version of \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" i his sweet Nashville Skyline voice, \\"Wigwam\\", a hilarious song of Dylan just going \\"La la la laaa\\" along a trumpet accompaniment, \\"The Boxer\\", a cover of the famous Simon and Garfunkel tune, \\"Quinn the Eskimo\\", a homage to the excellent Nicholas Ray film \\"The Savage Innocents\\" and \\"Let It Be Me\\", a sweet, little love song.    Considering it was originally a double LP, this CD is definatly worth the price Amazon offers (under ten dollars). If you actually enjoy Dylan and aren't looking for any poltical overtones, you'll like this album.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|I remember that this film came out around the same time as Adrian Brody's 'The Jacket'. The themes of both films are remarkably similar - a tortured individual is increasingly plagued by bizarre intrusions into his everyday reality, with both he and the viewer desperately trying to ascertain if what he is experiencing is real or merely a descent into madness, scrambling for clues in a dense thicket of intimations, references and flashbacks to the characters past.<br /><br />I enjoyed 'The Jacket', but found this to be a notch higher in the mind-bending rankings, firstly because all the loose strands were tied up at the end, and secondly, because of a quite outstanding and intense performance from the unnervingly gaunt Christian Bale. The unbearable responsibility of self-judgement played out in a contemporary and real yet disturbingly soulless backdrop, turns this film into one of the best adaptations yet of a novel that Kafka never wrote, and that's the kind of accolade that Bale's sacrifice to his art surely merits.
6305511055|4.0|Sorry- are we reviewing the film or the DVD of the film?  Unarguably a classic- the dvd I have is sad with nary a bonus feature.  This movie could use a DVD do-over to take advantage of its continued popularity.
B001M5UDGS|1.0|So, I have a tshirt that says Josh Whedon is my master now.  I'm going to have to think hard about wearing it again.    I love Dr.Horrible, but releasing this as a DVD-R recorded item is terrible ( not horrible )    I don't want to have something that looks like a pirated copy and if I want a DVD-R version I'll do it myself.    Honestly Josh, I expected better from you.    The material is great - format sucks.    I can't fathom why you would go back to FOX except that you need a paycheck.   Please don't sell out.
0316017922|5.0|Not very often do you get to read a book that is informative and very interesting all at the same time. Malcolm Gladwell has done this in Outliers. This book is not for this who want a meta-analysis or any other scientific method to reveal how success is really attained. This book is for the casual reader and by reading this book you can't help but to analyze yourself and wonder, \\"How did I get to where I am?\\"    I've read some of the other critiques of this book who believe that Gladwell's statement aren't validated by science. This book's purpose wasn't to say that attaining success is only done by good forture; rather, the purpose of the book is to refute that myth that one's success is achieved alone. Gladwell has proved that success isn't a solitary achievement.
B0009P66TK|5.0|This is a very nice watch, a bit oversized so a smaller man may think twice about buying it. The quality is top notch and for the money it just can't be beat.
B0017XFBMG|5.0|Wow. This is way more than I was expecting. Like many Pogues fans I own all the regular releases as well as some odd ball stuff but the majority of the material on the box set is completely fresh. And outstanding. Having all the \\"Straight to Hell\\" and \\"Sid and Nancy\\" tracks is fantastic. This will not dissapoint a Pogues fan nor any rock fan for that matter. Buy it and be blown away by one of the truly great bands to ever exist.      Jeremy 7

B001G9LVGG|5.0|My collection of holiday albums has grown tremendously this year what with Enya, Sarah Brightman, and now Loreena McKennitt all putting out albums recently.  I have to admit I'd forgotten about McKennitt since The Mummer's Dance hit local radio airwaves a few year's ago.  Without even listening to the samples, I bought a copy of her holiday album - A Midwinter Night's Dream.<br /><br />I love the cover: a dark painting of an array of animals decorating a tree with red ribbon.  The inside flap reveals a few words for thought, \\"As the wheel of days turns into darkness, it reveals the light and hope of spring.\\"  It definitely sets a nice warm tone for the album.  You'll be happy to find a booklet containing all of the words to each song inside if you care to learn some new carols and sing along.<br /><br />The album itself is a wonderful collection of non-American holiday music that truly is outstanding.  You may immediately recognize The Holly & The Ivy (the first track on the album), God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, and Good King Wenceslas. The other ten songs are rich in that Celtic style and worldly music feel which has made McKennitt so popular.<br /><br />McKennitt is Canadian, but was born of both Irish and Scottish decent and her roots definitely shine through on each and every song with heavy bagpipes, flutes, and \\"pub-style\\" background singers.<br /><br />If you are looking to add an exciting new flavor of holiday music to your player this year, or you are in search of something  different to just play in the background at a holiday party, then McKennitt is it.  The mix of carols, many with folk dance beats to enlighten the mood, is superb and will definitely conjure up visions of old world holidays!

B001ECDVYK|4.0|I was very pleased with the picture and sound quality on this title. I have had the past 2 standard dvd releases, and neither were very impressive. First off......this film does not look perfect. So a 4 star review is pretty accurate, maybe a 4.5 at best. But.....it looks so much better than the standard dvd release. Simply put, this title looks about as good as it is going to get.     The picture quality is very nice indeed. There are minor specs of dirt from start to finish. These blemishes do not look bad. This film should look a bit grainy and a little rough. I highly doubt that a film of this caliber will ever get a million dollar restoration frame by frame. The opening scene looks great, the desert looks very sharp and bright. The picture somewhat resembles No Country For Old Men in the open country. The colors are super bright and sharp. The details really come through on this Blu title. The skintones are right on the money. The closeups show off great detail, the whites are super clean and the blacks hold up very well when the scenes are shot inside for the last half of the movie. There are lots of different colors displayed in this title. All look very nice and crisp. Overall this title exceeded my expectations on picture and sound.     The sound really rocks! Very good surround sound effort. All speakers get involved with this action movie. Lots of shootouts and explosions to keep a good 5.1 sound system working hard. The subwoofer gets it's fair share also. Once the action kicks in, the speakers get a lot of work. The voices come out crisp and clean. The shootouts really rock. The rear speakers are used often for great surround effects. The music sounds great to boot! Overall product review is a very, very good one. If you were dissappointed with the standard dvd release.....this will make up for that poor release. Easily worth the upgrade if you are a fan of this flick. A fun vampire/action movie!     One important note: As of 12/02/08, this title is only availible from Amazon CANADA.
