B0013TTLDE|5.0|This book is phenomenal. If you love period works like Downton Abbey, you will definitely appreciate this read.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the book's extensive use of foreshadowing made it easy to predict the end of the story.
B00846REIS|3.0|It's ok, although the concept of the story is very similar to the 50 shades trilogy.. If u have just finished reading the 50 shades trilogy i suggest the buyer read 3 books before they start reading bared to you just to get your mind set off the characters :)
078322933X|5.0|Fear was a surprise.  The first 20 minutes are entirely generic and forgettable garbage involving familiar conflicts between a sassy and stubborn teenage daughter (played by a very cute and young Reese Witherspoon) and her parents resulting in several arguments that we've seen thousands of times before (both on TV and in reality).  However as soon as Reese Witherspoon's character meets a boy at a hip party that she has a crush on, almost nobody would have guessed the serious direction this plotline would have turned.<br /><br />This boyfriend is completely nuts.  He's apparently part of a gang that lives in a cabin of sorts, and does several bad things including treating women as sex objects and just a complete lack of respect for them overall.  These kids also have a strong desire to get even with the people they happen to have a personal problem with.  It just so happens -due to constant threats- that Reese's father is their main target which results in a tremendously enjoyable and suspenseful final 25 minutes of film.  Saying this group of kids is unstable is quite the understatement.  They have no compassion for the harm they cause and are willing to fight to the death.<br /><br />I can't get over how young Reese Witherspoon looks in this movie.  It's amazing really.  I'm not even sure at this point she was aware her popularity would skyrocket a few years later.  I'm not sure if this movie was in any way responsible for her future success either.  I don't really remember hearing about Fear back in the day though it's really such a solid movie that it most certainly *should* have been mentioned and *should* be remembered.  Watch this one folks.  Find a way to persevere the bland beginning and you will be rewarded with a satisfying suspense.
B000I52LUO|3.0|I was a machinist for 36 years. I could not get over the lack of safety glasses. everyone in that machine shop  should be blind by now. no manufacturer will let you on the shop floor without steel toe boots and safety glasses. Now that that's out of my system, the movie is very slow and not much action. I will give Jenifer Jason Leigh a ten for the best tits in Hollywood.
B0017O1MIM|5.0|I saw the original release of Lawrence in the theater (Cinerama?) and I thought it was awesome then.  It has stood the test of time and I probably appreciate it more even now.  Th DVD is very good.  Interestingly, when it was first released, the Middle-East was less significant in the mind of most Americans than it is today.  Lawrence was instrumental in setting up the ruling dynasties of several middle-eastern nations, and we cannot fully understand the political world of today without some understanding of the Arab Revolt and his role in it.  \\"Gen. Murray\\" makes the remark that aid to the Arabs would be \\"a backwater of a backwater,\\" but I believe history may show that to be sadly mistaken in the light of the growing role of Arab/Muslims in the 21st Century!<br /><br />If you enjoy history, and superb film-making, see this!  It of course greatly over-simplifies a complicated story and a complex biography, but it does it well.  It was the introduction of Peter O'Toole (unfortunately, it was the high-point of his career), Omar Sharif also (he went on to play Dr. Zhivago in another David Lean epic).  Alec Guinness is incredible as Prince Feisel.  Anthony Quinn as Auda Abu Tai is awesome.<br /><br />This movie is a commitment, and somewhat of a downer  at the end (I enjoy the first half better than the second), but I find I need to watch it periodically.  One of my two or three favorite movies.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The only thing I appreciated about this book was the contractual agreement, which, while being a very crucial element in BDSM, is unfortunately very rarely ackhowledged in literature where bondage play takes place. Also, unlike in the book \\"The Story of O\\" or \\"Sleeping Beauty\\", 50 Shades did a very good job defining  the boundaries and payoffs of power exchange play and conveying how one could derive excitement and pleasure from such exchanges. Unfortunately however, the rest of the book did not quite hold up, the following two books, even less so.  Pedestrian writing of a fairy tale fantasy. My gag reflex feels quite flexed! (it was quite a painful read I do assure you, but once I pay for it, it becomes an obligation to read it, and oh do I regret it!)
B005HSL626|5.0|its a really fun game to play with me and my mom I really like it . It really make my mind work
B005LAII58|4.0|A selling point of the original [[ASIN:B002ZG999U The Expendables]] was that such a movie would surely never be seen again: supposedly, it would be impossible for such a collection of career-minded egos to come together for a second time, and thus we should enjoy it while we could. I never doubted that there'd be a sequel, but if you want to think of this as an example of lightning striking twice, it can only serve to make the movie more noteworthy. I liked the first film enough to give it four stars and thus went into this one with reasonably high expectations - expectations which almost ended up being too high. The novelty of seeing a big collection of action heroes has been slightly reduced - partially by the film's delivery, partially by a bunch of other movies having copied the theme in recent years - and a few of the unfulfilled rumors regarding the cast list were particularly disappointing, but in the end, it ended up being a very well-rounded big-budget action flick that - however imperfectly - mixes deconstructive comedy with a varied collection of fulfilling adrenaline scenes.<br /><br />The story: when the newest Expendable (Liam Hemsworth, [[ASIN:B0084IG8TM The Hunger Games]]) is killed during a mission by an evil mastermind looking to harvest a forgotten cache of plutonium (Jean-Claude Van Damme), the old team - featuring Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Terry Crews - goes on a mission of vengeance to take down the villain and his forces.<br /><br />I think most fans who followed the development of the movie had their own hopes for potential new additions to the cast. Stallone himself mentioned Lorenzo Lamas, Jeff Speakman, and Olivier Gruner by name. The fact that none of these guys made it into the movie is disappointing, and it'll disappoint even more people that Jet Li disappears from the feature within the first twenty minutes. Additionally, Randy Couture's role has been reduced to the point that he's almost facetious to the picture, so his fans will probably be disappointed as well. I was personally appalled that a prettyboy with only three movies under his belt (at the time) was given access to such an elite ensemble, but luckily for me, his demise coincides with the arrival of Van Damme's return to the big screen, as well as that of number one henchman Scott Adkins (last seen in theaters for [[ASIN:B001GCUO1Q X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]). Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger were in the last flick, albeit as cameos to help sell the movie poster, but their vastly increased characterization and action participation almost makes them feel like brand new characters, particularly in Schwarzenegger's case. Chinese actress Yu Nan (who had played alongside Dolph Lundgren before in [[ASIN:B0013D8LM2 Diamond Dogs]]) fulfills the \\"female Expendable\\" role fans had been clamoring for, and while I would have vastly preferred seeing a more accredited face like Cynthia Rothrock or Michelle Yeoh in the part, Yu is both a good actress and a physically capable one. Rounding off the credited cast is Chuck Norris, who disappointingly isn't very physical: though he has the best entrance I've seen in a while, he only gets to shoot a bit and utter the expected Chuck Norris Fact© during his approximate ten minutes of screentime.<br /><br />Oh yeah, Mickey Rourke's gone MIA, too.<br /><br />Where the action is concerned, I can only complain about its distribution: too much time elapses in the middle of the picture without any fighting or shooting going on. When either does happen, though, it tends to be good - sometimes very good. I recount at least three or four lengthy guns & effects battles, mixed with some nice vehicle-related sequences (at least half of these are CG-rendered, though, so I can't be as impressed by them as I'd otherwise be). I was very pleased that there's a scene near the end of the picture where almost all of the stars still alive at the time were caught up in an extensive gunfight. Of course, anyone who knows me will know that I was much more eager for the hand-to-hand fights, and I ended up satisfied. In pre-production, Stallone referred to this sequel as a \\"love letter to the martial arts,\\" and while I'm not sure this is exactly what it is, the fistfights we see are roundly good. Though the match-ups in the original film enticed me more (i.e. Lundgren vs. Li, Gary Daniels vs. Li & Statham), these here are categorically filmed better, having all but completely done away with the questionable camera angles and disappointing cutting of the originals. Disappointingly, neither Lundgren nor Couture nor the aforementioned Norris are given a clear spotlight to display their martial skills, but the battles which are highlighted - Jet battling a bunch of guys in a kitchen, Statham taking on a bunch of guys in a church, Statham fighting Adkins, and the finale between Stallone and Van Damme - are much better than I expected and definitely above the Hollywood standard. It's all pretty grounded stuff and satisfyingly violent with lots of improvised weapon usage. Though none of the brawls will win a nomination for \\"fight of the year\\" in my book, I'd go as far to say that the inevitable second sequel has a good amount of living up to do.<br /><br />Dramatically, the movie isn't impressive but still fun. I appreciate the comedy Dolph Lundgren is allowed and I like that Terry Crews' character is given a few more character scenes, since he was basically a stock figure in the original. Jean-Claude Van Damme, on a roll ever since [[ASIN:B001PWY4NG JCVD]], doesn't really get a chance to deliver the dark energy he's been perfecting but still manages to have fun with his character, exaggerating his accent and doing what he can with his limited action until the finale. With her mastery of the English language and smooth delivery, I can easily see Yu Nan growing into a performer along the lines of Maggie Q or Kelly Hu. Guys like Schwarzenegger and Willis are entertaining without even trying. The one thing that really got on my nerves about the characters was the nonstop banter between Stallone and Statham: yes, they've got good chemistry, but if I had to hear them glad-hand eachother one more time, I might've put popcorn in my ears for the remainder of their scenes.<br /><br />Story-wise, I prefer the first film, but the sequel definitely has its predecessor's number when it comes to action scenes. Chances are that fans of the original will receive \\"The Expendables 2\\" warmly, but even the hardcore action devotees who turned their backs on the original might find this one different enough to consider a different opinion. Myself, I'm already waiting for number three to come out - maybe then we'll finally see Kurt Russell and Steven Seagal added to the cast.e gunfight.

B005LAII94|2.0|Director Oliver Stone (\\"W.\\") brings us an R-rated violent, bloody, repugnant visualization of the contemporary drug business in California and Mexico. We already know the death toll approaches 50,000 for the last six years. (Why do Americans keep buying drugs and by so doing, contribute to the deaths of Mexicans, most of whom are innocent?) An unlikely but inseparable trio of \\"peaceful, California pot growers\\" go up against a Mexican drug cartel.<br /><br />We see:<br />  * Taylor Kitsch (\\"John Carter\\") is Chon, Special-Ops trained but derailed by the two people he loves.<br />  * Blake Lively (\\"Gossip Girl\\"), a California blonde, is O, a delectable dimwit who loves BOTH of the guys in their little ménage à trois. When taken hostage, her chronic drug use backfires on her.<br />  * Aaron Johnson (\\"Albert Nobbs\\") is Ben, the soulful botanist who has developed a highly marketable variety of marijuana.<br />  * John Travolta (\\"From Paris With Love\\"), sporting one face-lift too many, is Dennis, the go-to guy in the government, who plays all sides against the middle.<br />  * Benicio del Toro (\\"The Wolfman\\") is Lado, an hombre with slippery loyalties. His character seems to take pleasure in devising creative ways to torture and kill.<br />  * Salma Hayak (\\"Grown Ups\\") is Elena, the jefa of a major cartel. She has political, economic and geographic concerns but remains in charge.<br />  * Emile Hirsch (\\"Milk\\") is Spin, the tech whiz who can create a paper trail that will lead the best tracker astray.<br /><br />Man's inhumanity to man is singularly repellent to me. Even though I tried to avoid looking at the screen, I came out with enough chaotic images of drug use, sexual encounters, beheadings, whippings, tortures, gunfire and blowie uppie stuff to last me a lifetime. I don't know, and I don't want to know, these methods, so I recoil from the images.<br /><br />Near the conclusion, Stone pulled a cinematic trick that triggered a collective groan from our screening audience. As we exited the theater, we realized that none of us knew exactly how it ended...nor did we care...<br /><br />The DVD from Amazon.com will prove my point.
0743487486|5.0|A must read for all parents. Changed and challenged my way of thinking and helped me tremendously in my parenting. Recommended.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|There ARE good movie makers out there and their names are Joss Wheden (\\"Firefly\\"), Zak Penn (\\"X-Men\\"), Jon Favreau (\\"Iron Man\\") and Stan Lee (Marvel Comics), among a legion of creative artists who made this happen. This actioner has great heroes, great pacing, great humor and LOTS (and lots and lots and lots...sigh...) of Computer Generated Imaging and blowie uppie stuff. The whole thing feels like an in-crowd joke because we know all of the characters so well their lines don't have to be hammered home, just a hint and we all get it. The main issue is that these guys don't play well with others.<br /><br />Let's review these familiar faces:<br />  * Samuel L. Jackson (\\"Iron Man\\") is Nick Fury, the guy who is the through-line in these things. He isn't above a sly card trick or two...<br />  * Robert Downey Jr. (\\"Sherlock Holmes\\") is Tony Stark/Iron Man, no matter what Downey charges, he is worth the price. He is spectacularly good: his character is smart, funny and (fairly) decent.<br />  * Chris Evans (\\"What's Your Number?\\") is Steve Rogers/Captain America, this walking talking anachronism doesn't get any references newer than WWII (but he understands \\"Flying Monkeys\\" because Wizard of Oz came out in 1939). He is military through and through, a take-charge guy when the chips are down.<br />  * Mark Ruffalo (\\"The Kids are All Right\\") is Bruce Banner/The Hulk, the scientist in hiding from anything that might agitate him into transforming again.<br />  * Chris Hemsworth (\\"Star Trek\\") is Thor, come to Earth to retrieve his evil half-brother Loki, and save our planet.<br />  * Jeremy Renner (\\"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\\") is Clint Barton/Hawkeye, the archer who may or may not have a history with the Black Widow (in Bulgaria).<br />  * Clark Gregg (\\"(500) Days of Summer\\") is Agent Coulson, the glue that has held this group together through many of these Marvel movies.<br />  * Stellan Skarsgård (\\"The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo\\") is Selvig, the scientist who understands the Tesseract and the power it represents.<br />  * Tom Hiddleston (\\"War Horse\\") is Loki, the villain we love to hate. Just wait until The Hulk gets his hands on him!<br />  * Scarlett Johansson (\\"We Bought a Zoo\\") is Natasha Romanoff/ Black Widow, she has a lot of red in her ledger she is trying to erase.<br />  * Gwyneth Paltrow (\\"Contagion\\") is Pepper Potts. Iron Man's right-hand (wo)man.<br /><br />All of the CGI action finally began to wear on me; sometimes too much is just too much! Our Friday matinee crowd was savvy: every one of us stayed put all the way through the credits to pick up the next little snippet we have come to expect from Marvel movies. By the way, I saw this in a multiplex with no IMAX and no 3D and it was terrific, so don't $pend too much for those extras. Wait and see what is on your DVD from Amazon.com.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This was a great book; well written, entertaining and hard to put down.  That being said, I did find it just a bit predictable and I found the end unsatisfying.  I would have liked a little more on what happened after the truth came out.  I would still certainly recommend it to others!
B008MM9630|5.0|so fun and easy to jump into and get addictive. goes fast and has multiple things to do. fun fun fun
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I am not normally a reader but I could not put this down.  I downloaded it to my phone so I could easily carry it around and pick it up whenever possible.  I am now on the 3rd book and trying to figure out what I'm going to do when I've finished that one.  LOL  I'm loving the 3rd one too.  I will miss Christian and Ana and their story!

B00932A6G4|4.0|a terrible delivery system via amazon.  I have a very fast connection but despite that the film was choppy and the volume too low.<br /><br />Kudos to the team that brought this film to life, I really enjoyed it and will probably buy the dvd to get a better viewing experience than was possible with amazon's overloaded delivery servers.
B001B6PBBK|1.0|I don't understand why it's set in London when the actress playing the leading lady can't even pull off a convincing British accent. And it's just so dull and boring. Not worth it, even though it's free with Prime.
B008B4KVS8|4.0|the crispness,clarity and sharpness of both the picture image and<br />tjhe multi-channel audio tracks is A+ except for one problem. toward<br />the end of the film just as Patrick McGoohan throws the canister to<br />Ernest Borgnine there is a very noticeable shaking in the film that<br />happens 3? times. with all the digital technology available today<br />i can't believe that when they did the high def transfer they<br />weren't able to eliminate it.<br /><br />otherwise the print looks and sounds great.
1594744769|3.0|Ok, this was not spine tingling. The photos were fascinating, but if you adverse to horror you may still enjoy this book. I would classify it as a YA paranormal adventure novel with historical influence and some nifty cool old photos. I would not classify it as horror (and it has no gore or icky bits, really).<br /><br />I enjoyed this as a solid, albeit quick, read. It is definitely a beach read, given the pace and lightness. I think my favorite thing about this novel is how subtly Ransom Riggs handles the topic of aging and connecting to an obsolete generation. The narrator's struggles with believing and disbelieving his grandfather, and his observations on how adults handle the aging and possible dementia of their parents, was beautifully done. And not too heavy-handed, either. In all, he really captured that fine line between believing in the magic of stories of a bygone era, and trying to know a relative who is so far removed from you, both in age and culture.<br /><br />Some of the ideas in this book are relatively unique and new, and some are old hashed-out tropes, which gave me a mixed impression on how well I liked the novel. I genuinely expected it to be scary, and it isn't, but I did not expect it to deal with the transition between youth and adulthood (not just as a coming-of-age novel, which it is, but as larger concepts).<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this to folks who enjoy a simple adventure, the paranormal, The X-Men, YA, and creepy old photographs.
B000062V9C|1.0|I was excited to finally find this movie and at a reasonable price.  I did not see the \\"Region 2\\" type until after I had made purchase.  Obviously, it does not work in my DVD player.  It comes up \\"wrong region\\".  I undertand Amazon is a global company, but who would sell/send a region 2 video to someone in the UNITED STATES!!  There should be some kind of stipulation in their system that keeps people from making such mistakes.  Now, I'm out my $20+ bucks.<br /><br />Not happy!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I would recommend this app for anyone looking for a battery app that is informative and easy to use. The only thing I would change is add a toggle or something that would allow me to take off anything that refers to mobile phones and mobile data, etc.  I am using a Wi-Fi only tablet. Its not really a bother just unnecessary.

B004TTMYQG|5.0|Syncs with Google Calender perfectly.  Although original color schemes don't seem to translate directly, clear color differences for separate calendars make it easy to find what I'm looking for at a glance.  The shear number of customizable options and widgets make this app superior to the stock calender most devices come loaded with and worth the purchase.

B007BFSYMS|5.0|This thing has brought peace to my nights.  A year ago we had 2 fatal wrecks near my home within 2 months.  Well needless to say road noise has caused me massive issues since then.  Something about seeing the 2 dead guys in my head that I had to pull out 2 different cars everytime I would hear a car go down the street....It wasnt fun.<br />Well I dont take meds to sleep.  Its not my thing.  I tried a fan but it bothered me more than the road.  Then I found White Noise.  I tried the free one but the paid app is so much better.  I love this thing.  Its like having peace back in my home once again while I try to sleep.  Thank you so much for this app.  It is truely a life changer.<br /><br />PS my 4 new trees will help too but they grow so slowly.
B005RJ6DUK|4.0|A friend of mine wanted me to buy this movie for his collection because he'd seen it in the $20 price range and thought that's too much to pay for a movie. I haven't seen the movie so I can't review it but I can tell you that the price is right and was a savings of about $10 over most places. The movie was still wrapped, delivery was prompt, and I have no complaints with the purchase.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Incredible is not even close to comparing how great this show is. I love it! I'm such a fan, that I have to know what date the new season starts and if I miss part of the episode, I am watching it on demand again just so I can see what I missed! I've bought every season so far and will continue to support Castle! Such a great show and never gets boring! Will continue to recommend it to everyone! My favorite show, and will be for a long time i'm sure, unless someone comes out with a show that's better. Which is highly unlikely.
B005NPCUC8|5.0|Largely considered the greatest rock album ever made.  I wish I could say more, but until you listen to it, with headphones, and something interesting to smoke, you won't get the point.
B0002CX4RM|3.0|A production of a Grand Opera should be one-third vocal, one-third orchestral and one-third visual. The one-third visual should be one-half costuming and one-half sets/set decoration. In this production the lack of comprehensible sets and the garishness of some of the costumes detracts from the vocal and orchestral. And interestingly, the costuming of Miss Borodina is superior, while all remaining costuming is \\"over the top\\" or sadly deficient in character. It is difficult to appreciate the vocal and orchestral aspects of the production when the visual is so distracting. In the last thirty years or so, it is unfortunate that opera stage directors have been allowed to engage in such unchecked imagination.

034580404X|5.0|The first time that I heard about this book it was from a recently divorced, middle-aged woman who found it completely erotic.  Needless to say, it intrigued me since I usually go for thrillers.  So, I decided to give it a try.  Upon completion of the first book, I cried so hard that my boyfriend looked at me crazy and so I sobbed \\"must go to bookstore.\\"  There I bought all three and finished them within days.  Yes, there is some kinky sex situations, though nothing like I was expecting and overall, it is a wonderful love story that I plan to read again!  Anastasia and Christian go through so much together! It was great read and a change from my norm!
B008NMT684|2.0|good for a toddler. my son had fun with these puzzles. it was pretty easy to use but it sucks because you have to add a review

B0086700CM|4.0|I have a kindle fire and the game lags all the time! other than that it is a very fun game.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|the series follows the book as closely as it can in each episode.  Hopefully Season two will continue in this manner.  It wouldn't have been as good otherwise.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|For a long time, I've been searching for an author that twists me, turns me, makes me think, and delivers an insightful one-two punch into the frailty and beauty and strength of humanity the way that two of my favorite authors (Ray Bradbury and Isaac Asimov) do. I never expected to find him in a primarily Kindle-published book, but I did.<br /><br />I literally couldn't put Wool down. Literally. Well, until my Kindle's battery ran out, that is. From the very first chapter, I was spellbound; the characters resonated, were fully fleshed-out, and the situation they find themselves in is riveting and eerily plausible in our future. If you've been burned by bad (perhaps absolutely awful) Kindle-published fiction before (as I have), and are wary of trying this book because of it, fear not! This is far better quality than many of the traditional paper books I've read recently- the plot, the grammar, the prose. All amazing.<br /><br />When I finally finished and put the book down, a sense of sadness at being finished combined with an overwhelming curiosity at the fate of the people Howey had written overtook me. I checked out the author's website and was delighted to find many other books- including a continuation of this series- that I can't wait to dig in to. Thanks very much, Hugh- you've got a new fan!
B001OQCV2E|1.0|This movie is complete crap! NOBODY knows when the \\"End Of The World\\" is gonna come.The Mayans never even said the world would end or any kind of disaster would happen on 12/21/12.Just some phony pagans took the Mayan calender ending and blew it up into something COMPLETLY different.It's not even logical.Time zones are different all around the world.So 12/21/12 is not REALLY 12/21/12.For the other side of the world it could be 12/22/12 or 12/20/12.Those of you who buy into this 2012 crap,should stop and think about that,before getting all scared.

B005LAII12|4.0|When John was a little boy he had no friends, so one Christmas night he wished so hard that his teddy bear was alive, that his wish was granted. 25 years later Ted is a freeloading, pot-smoking wastrel with a penchant for hookers and booze who is becoming an increasingly awkward third wheel in John's relationship with his girlfriend Lori (the wondrous Mila Kunis).<br /><br />In the very best sense Ted is a hugely silly movie, and a very, very funny one. Mark Wahlberg is dependably good as the adult John, who still doesn't really want to grow up. He acts as a straight man to the Seth McFarlane voiced Ted, who is rude, profane, and perhaps a bit racist. Mila Kunis, one of the finest comediennes at work today, is excellent in the more difficult role of Lori: the adult of the trio always at risk, with a less well judged performance, of being the killjoy in the movie.<br /><br />The humour in the movie is very much in keeping with McFarlane's TV show Family Guy, so it might not be to everyone's taste - there is an edge of cruelty to some of it which some may find offensive, particularly if they are fans of Sinead O'Connor, Susan Boyle or Taylor Lautner.<br /><br />Still the movie boasts possibly the funniest fight scene since John Wayne and Victor McLaughlin went at it in The Quiet Man: its worth watching for that alone... and, of course, the luminous Mila Kunis.
0553801473|5.0|The fifth book continues the story just as you'd expect with all its twists and turns and cliffhangers. Just don't ask George to write faster, every time he hears it he kills a Stark.
0345803485|4.0|First off I wanted to give this book 3.5 stars, so I rounded up to 4.<br /><br />I didn't understand the hype but I bought all 3 books because my curiosity got the best of me.  Did I enjoy them on some level, yes.  Do I think they should be up there with books such as The Hobbit, no.  Same with movies.  I do enjoy a good classic (Schindler's List, 12 Angry Men, The Great Gatsby) but sometimes I enjoy a dumb movie (National Lampoon's Animal House, etc...) once in awhile too.  This book isn't the best, it isn't the worst.  I don't think we should judge each other based on what we like and don't like.  If you like it, great.  If you don't, great.  I'm not going to go to your house and start disapproving of your book collection, so don't come to mine and do it.  To each their own, that's what makes us as a whole great.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I am a college student preordering this movie. That alone should be a sign of its quality. A close second to tangled, brave is enriching, funny, powerful, sweet, action-packed, intense, and beautifully animated with wonderful music and excellent voices.  It is a bit darker than tangled,  which enhances it and makes up for the lack of romance, but with enough tearjerker moments, mother-daughter bonding, and lighthearted parts to put this up there on the list of future classics. Definitely worth your money!!
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I've been a fan of this show for as long as i could remember. I remember watchin it with my father when i was much younger n the 80's. So yeah i love the dvd's and im gonna order more thanks Amazon
B007WULJ5G|2.0|This film is good if you enjoy the over the top oversaturated crazy stuff. I was expecting something disturbing and Artistic, what I got was a movie that seems to try so damn hard at being the sickest thing you've ever viewed that it just becomes totally void of any sort of provocative Art. A Serbian Film seems to not know if it wants to be Pier Paolo Pasolini's 'Sal&ograve;, 120 Days of Sodom' or Pascal Laugier's 'Martyrs' and in the end it plays out like a wanna be Takashi Miike film that couldn't hold a candle to either of the two masterpieces I just named.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|again, a predictable appropriation with some up-dated elements of erotica and settings. The plot is developed further and the 'romance' between the protagonists is tweaked a little. Possibly a slight improvement on first book in the trilogy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is amazing. I love all of the mini games. It allows you to have variety all in one app.
B007L3BMGA|3.0|Words to the wise, its not a new plot-line or well written...but if you are wanting to read an appropration of e/f such the Story of O etc...<br />I read it as my lit. students were wanting to talk about it.<br /><br />possibly not the best investment ever made. But each to their own.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like the game overall. It's a great start. I am assuming that since it's an ice age village game that it's intended player would be a child. I don't think a child would have much fun playing this game. Here are the problems I have with the game.<br /><br />-Everything costs alot of coins, and you can't gain them fast enough to really do anything, So if you have a life and can't play the game 24/7 and you only check in once or twice a day then you are always going to be broke and unable to do any of the quests. Even the price of land is ridiculous. It goes up by 50,000 coins with every piece of land you buy and 1 piece of land only fits 3 animal plots on it. The price starts at 100,000 then goes to 150,000 so on and so forth, but you still get the same amount of land every time.<br /><br />-Acorns........UGH. Unless you buy them with real money there is really no actual way to get them, and half of the quests you receive you have to use acorns to get past them or pay acorns to skip them. Needless to say I don't like the acorn's at all.<br /><br />-Neighbors. No thank you. I don't like badgering my friends with requests from games because I have to in order to get anywhere in the game, and again in order to pass some of the quests you have to have neighbors and like their village.<br /><br />-Breeding.... In order to \\"complete\\" a family you need two adults and two babies. Which is all well and fine, but you have to pay to even breed then you get an egg that hatches in x hours. If you don't come back to \\"move\\" the baby to the animals said plot then it runs away and you can either pay acorns to go look for it or abandon it and loose whatever money you spent breeding it. Bottom line if you are going to make us pay coins or acorns for the babies then give us a baby not an egg that hatches in so many hours. Then try to cheat us out of real money to buy acorns to get them back.
1400069289|5.0|This is by far the best book I have ever read and offers much insight into how habits change and a lot of research was done.
B007BZM3HK|4.0|Very catchy and fun song. It makes a great ring tone and enjoyable to listen to while working out. Thank you Amazon for the free download
B004LROMWU|4.0|I like this show.  It's better than the new version of \\"V\\".  The Aliens are not stupid like animals and not so advanced that it is absurd that the human race stands a chance at hurting them.  It's gritty and had many of the elements of \\"V\\" that I liked but it is different.  This issue I have is with all the white people as major characters and anyone who is not white getting killed.  There are two non white characters that have made it to season two but I fear their days are numbered and that they will die and be replaced by white people like other characters.  It would be easier to swallow but America is so diverse that I just don't buy it.  Also mixed ethnic couples generally don't last unless a white dude likes a non white girl.  There was a white girl who liked this Mexican dude (he bit it), A Mexican girl liked a black dude and he was used as an alien host and died horribly.  I can only imagine what would happen to a black man in this show if he liked a white blond woman.  It's a good show about how white people save the Earth.
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I will never purchase the \\"original trilogy\\" until it is the actual original trilogy. First and foremost it's false advertising to claim this is the original trilogy and then muck it up with different scenes. I'll stick it out with the THX Digital Mastered VHS tapes, thank you very much.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Poor written fantasy for too young of an adult main characters. Read Killing Johnny Fry for a truer story of sexual exploration.
0307474275|3.0|...Suspend your disbelief.<br /><br />Let me give an example:<br /><br />***The following contains small spoilers for the first few chapters***<br /><br />In the opening scene, Jacques Sauniere, the elderly curator of the Louvre museum, is shot by an albino monk.<br />He is shot in the stomach, just below the heart. He gives himself about 15 minutes to live, as his death will be slow and painful.<br />Note the word PAINFUL.<br /><br />So, in his final minutes, he does this. A wounded, bleeding, dying, 80-something man, did this:<br /><br />Took off his clothes.<br /><br />Arranged his body in the shape of The Vitruvian man.<br /><br />Used his own blood to draw a 5 pointed star on his chest.<br /><br />Wrote \\"13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5<br /><br />O, Draconian Devil<br /><br />Oh, lame saint<br /><br />P.S. Find Robert Langdon\\" on the floor beside him in Ultraviolet Marker.<br /><br />Trekked to the Mona Lisa.<br /><br />Wrote \\"So dark the con of man\\" on the Mona Lisa.<br /><br />Trekked to Madonna on the Rocks.<br /><br />Hid a key behind the Madonna of the Rocks.<br /><br />Died.<br /><br />...<br /><br />While this makes for good reading and plenty of cliffhangers, it just seems to be too ELABORATE and UNREALISTIC.<br /><br />...<br /><br />What do you think? - Write a comment! I appreciate your feedback.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|The controls did take some getting used to but, overall, it is a good game; I enjoyed playing once I got the hang of it. If you like Mario Bros then you may like this game as an alternative. Thanks NER.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool Volume 1 has all the makings of a classic American short story; a juicy little slice of a much larger story. But unlike being left high and dry as we do with classic short stories, we get to see the big picture with volumes 2 - 5. And that's a really good thing! Wool 1 - 5 is an easy to read, yet thoughtful story with well developed characters whom we readily relate to. Every chapter fulfills a mission of either advancing the plot or the characters. It never wanders or waivers or gives us the feeling that the author wasn't sure how to wrap things up. It was overall one of the most satisfying books I've read in the past five years and I can't wait to dig into future installments.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|This was a trilogy I read because everyone else was reading and talking about it.  I would not recommend to others - the content actually got boring after awhile, it was the same content over and over and over.  I'm struggling to complete the last book at this time.  it does not have a story line that keeps you interested and wanting to continue to read.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Having just re-read Northanger Abbey, I was eager to see the DVD.  Although it is condensed to less than an hour and a half, this version captures the essence of the story very well. Our heroine was just pretty enough to be believable, and she comes over just as Miss Austen presented her.  All the actors are fine for their characters.
B007XH6BPG|5.0|This is a fantastic new CD by Steve Hackett and Chris Squire. If you are a Yes or Genesis fan, this is a must have.I hope they tour and support their album.
1439152799|5.0|The end was unexpected, the suspects suspicious until the very end, and the imagined outcome was not the final one, although the author, wisely, leaves something for the imagination. Enthralling reading.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Its very addictive, the people who dislike it are the people with wifi problems. so if you have good wifi, go ahead and play. :D One problem, it tries to steal your money in the game.. ;_;
B008BIN9EW|1.0|it's a fun game to play but it drains battery quick. make sure you have a full battery when you start playing.<br /><br />I'm running on a Gnex with stock 4.0.4 ROM.<br /><br />***EDIT 9/21/2012***<br /><br />lowering my rating from 4 stars to 1 star.<br /><br />a few days after installing this game i received a replacement phone in the mail from verizon and when i set it up i couldn't find UniWar HD in the list of 'MyApps' in the Amazon appstore app.  went to Amazon on my PC and looked it up, the game is still listed on the site as 1 of my apps, but now says it's not compatible w/ any of my devices.  emailed the dev on Aug 30th and as of today still have not received an answer.  i started a discussion here on the Amazon site about this and quickly found that there are many others having this same issue.  i've even found a post in the UniWar forums about it, but no response from the devs there either, this shows how much they care about their users.  i will never give them any money for an app in the future based on this experience.  be careful!
0316056863|2.0|Let me start by saying I actually like Tina Fey and think she is a very talented lady. I also admire the way she balances her home and work life.<br />However, this book really was a tremendous disappointment. It was disjointed and the chapters seemed to run helter-skelter. I had expected to be rolling over with laughter, and in reality, must have barely tittered a grand total of 3 times.<br />What a let down! I was led to believe after completing this that all her humor and comedic sense are limited to television.<br />Come on Tina, let's just forget this one, and try again; bowling us over with your next book. You are way too phenomenal of a talent for me to judge you on one effort.
B0087DFIYA|5.0|First off...yes I know Mel Gibson has been on a train ride to self destruction in recent years with his drinking, violence and anti-semetic nonsense. But damn did I miss the guy in a god honest action movie. In \\"Get the Gringo\\" he not only shows why he's considered a damn good actor but how great he is at action movies. The movie is about an expert con man ending up in a mexican prison after a series of UNFORTUNATE events and the crazyness he encounters throughout his stay there. NO SPOILERS HERE FOLKS!! It has everything you need action, gore, betrayals, revenge, guns and even a kid sidekick, lol. One of Mel's best recent offerings and due to this flick may I be the first to say it...MEL GIBSON FOR EXPENDABLES 3!!!! nuff said.<br /><br />UPDATE: Well folks my wish came true, Mel's the big baddie in The Expendables 3!! Hooray!! Stallone, lol. Now stay out of trouble Mel.
145162607X|5.0|I have read most of Philippa's Novels.  I really enjoy her writing style.  I just completed this latest novel the the Cousin's War \\"The Kingmaker's Daughter\\"  I though it was fantastic.  I love How throughout this process we are reading about the same time period from different vantage points leading up to \\"The White Princess\\"  Anne Neville was a great character to base this novel on. I haven't read much about Ann Neville before this book and I found her to be quite facinated with her.  She wanted so badly to be the person her father wanted her to be. And she may not have complete control over her life but she made it happen.  I love reading these novels through the eyes of the woman during this time period.  Amazing great read.  If you Love Philippa's books you will love this one too.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|This is the first book I have read by this author.  I thoroughly enjoyed the easy read and the twist at the end.  I was very surprised!

B002CGSYNU|1.0|I wish I knew the correct lens cap for the Olympus 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 Zuiko Lens.<br /><br />This cap is too big.<br /><br />==== More news from Olympus web site ====<br />It turns out that I have the M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 II. The \\"II\\" was not marked on the lens you just have to know!<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />The M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 II was introduced as the kit lens for the Olympus PEN E-PL2. It retains the versatility of its predecessor and features three additional benefits. This lens is designated MSC (Movie-Still-Compatible), which means it utilizes a nearly silent focusing technology that is all but imperceptible when recording HD movies. It also has an increased autofocus speed when capturing still images. Finally, the lens supports M.Zuiko conversion lenses and optional ø37 mm filters, all of which attach to the lens via a bayonet mount located underneath the decoration ring at the end of the lens. This lens is narrower and lighter than the original with a diameter of 2.2 inches (56.5 mm) and a weight of 3.9 oz (112 g). When retracted, this lens is 1.9\\" (50 mm) in length.<br /><br />The following Olympus accessories are compatible with this lens:<br />* LH-61C and LH-40 lens hoods<br />* LC-37B front lens cap<br />* LR-2 rear lens cap<br />* PRF-D37 ø37 mm Protective Filter<br />* MCON-P01 Macro conversion lens<br />* WCON-P01 Wide-angle conversion lens<br />* FCON-P01 Fish Eye conversion lens<br /><br />The M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 II R was introduced as a kit  lens option bundled with the E-P3, E-PL3 and E-PM1. The specifications  of this model are identical to its predecessor, and it accepts all of  the same Olympus accessories, including the lens hoods, M.Zuiko conversion lenses and ø37 mm filters. However, exterior elements were redesigned in order to match the more modern look of the new trinity of Olympus PEN cameras. The textured grip features narrow horizontal bands around the circumference of the lens barrel, rather than the vertical bands of varied widths that run lengthwise along the barrel of the M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 II and M.ZUIKO DIGITAL ED 14-42mm f3.5-5.6. Also, the lens is a solid color (black or silver), where  the previous version had a silver mount on the black-bodied lens.l of the M.ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-42mm f3.5-5.6 II and M.ZUIKO DIGITAL ED 14-42mm f3.5-5.6. Also, the lens is a solid color (black or silver), where  the previous version had a silver mount on the black-bodied lens.

1908538694|5.0|GOOD READING SOME FACTS THAT I NEVER HEARD OF THINGS THAT WERE DONE AND HOW THEY DID IT AND WHY
0451197968|4.0|WARNING - don't read King's forward. It contains a horrendous spoiler. (It can't be said often enough.)<br /><br />Running Man is a tightly-written, action-driven look at a future that seems to be getting distressingly closer. Protagonist Ben Richards is a bitter, dark character with a hard knot of decency at his core. I found it easy to cheer for him, which is why I only gave 4 stars instead of 5: The ending was too abrupt. I wanted a denouement, something to indicate whether Richards' actions made a difference.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|After the update (with additional levels) deleted all my progress (I had three stars on every level), I complained on the Angry Birds Facebook page.  Here is their response, verbatim:<br /><br />\\"Unfortunately that happens sometimes if your device loses Internet connection while updating. It can happen on iOS devices as well.\\"<br /><br />As if it was MY fault!  I don't know anyone whose progress was retained after the update.<br /><br />I guess I should thank them for ridding me of my addiction...?
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Missed this movie on the big screen and now, after viewing the just released DVD, am sorry I did. The story line and special effects are excellent. The cooperation of the U.S. Navy shows throughout the film, particularly the great scenes involving the USS Missouri and the sailors that actually served on her.
B004P52NP6|3.0|I've been a fan of WS for years, and while I think the songwriting is decent on this album, and the musicianship is pretty phenomenal, but how do you tell the frontman and \\"Face\\" of the band that he needs to hang up the pipes? I started to notice the strain on Mr Coverdale's voice as early as Slip of the Tongue, and this album displays the fact that he's ruined his voice.  They try to disguise it by pushing his vocals WAY back in the mix and processing the crap out of it, but it's still pretty obvious. The other musicians are great - maybe they should have released an instrumental album.  Sorry Dave.<br />**addendum**<br />Maybe Dave could remedy things with John Sykes and ask him to sing? Nah, I doubt that.
B00932A6G4|4.0|If you enjoy the Starship Troopers storyline then this is worthwhile to watch.<br />The Computer graphics are well done. And the story line is better than most animated movies.<br />If this has been done as a movie with real actors it would have been better than both of the ST sequels.<br />I enjoyed it enough that I feel I got a decent movie for the price to rent it.
034580404X|5.0|Heard about this book but not to the standard of the writing of this author (who is a first time author) out of the ball park.  Very intense,very seductive could not put it down .  I got up in the middle of the night to read.

1416955070|5.0|REVIEW<br /><br />While this 1st book in The Mortal Instruments appears at first glance to be yet another love triangle paranormal unbelievable romance .. Stop the press !! WHO SAID THAT ? I went into this one with absolutely no second thoughts being I had already been glued to the infernal devices books the week beforehand . I certainly wasn't disappointed I love Cassandra Clare's flare and style , City of Bones with its love triangle ( which I secretly think is a beautiful part of alot of truly fascinating tales) is enthralling and heart stopping, endearing and most of all a world I would be happy to be lost in. The cliffhanger well I'm not giving it away so all i will say is NOOOOO !! It must be a mistake !<br /><br />I just pray the movie lives up to the book !!<br /><br />A must read with 4 and a half chocolate kiss stars
B0011E7JBW|5.0|just love these actors they are the greatest and make you laugh.  I can't wait for MIB III hope it comes out real soon.

B008N1LL42|3.0|5 stars? \\"One of the best\\"? Unbelievable. Seriously... there are more than a few better action and sci-fi movies available to us recently. This really trumps The Dark Night trilogy, Iron Man, Inception, The Matrix trio, Star Trek, Transformers, Avatar, etc.? This movie is clearly b-list by comparison. Come on people this is based on a VERY simple children's game... and it's a very simple movie.<br /><br />That having been said, it's still an entertaining effort. Not the watch it hundreds of times type of entertaining, but it's a lot less stupid and disappointing than Battle Los Angeles. I'm amazed at the high production values and solid casting given the unimpressive plot. Apart from the first half hour this is a visually stunning movie with a seemingly solid sound track(amazon only plays in stereo). It's worth it to see a Battleship unloading a full broadside at point blank range. I'd recommend you rent it though. This flick'll be collecting dust in no time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing solitaire and this app is great. Lots of playing options and you can even go head to head with other players. I most enjoy playing a winning hand and seeing how my score stacks up to the competition. I highly recommend this app.
B008JOK59K|5.0|The '59 Sound was such a great album that I had high hopes for Handwritten, but I wouldn't have been surprised if there was a slight drop in quality. Fortunately, Handwritten is a fantastic album that I haven't stopped playing since I purchased it.<br /><br />Love that it starts out with an upbeat and raw sound of 45 and Handwritten. You can hear the passion and strength in Fallon's voice -- it tells an incredible story throughout the album.<br /><br />My favorite track is National Anthem, but Mae and Desire are surprise tracks that have me hitting repeat.<br /><br />Is it better than 59 Sound? Not sure, but it definitely is different. And that's ok. It's a welcomed change.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I like this app so much, now I don't forget many thing that I used to forget. Really great!! I highly recommend this app guys!

B007D2XSW0|4.0|This is an &quot;ok&quot; app. It NEEDS more options and other things to do. Price is also exceeding my taste. 2.00$ seems more fair for what is offered in the app.
B0069UP2PI|2.0|routine disaster movie, another in a long, long series.<br /><br />By the nature of the disaster, don't expect special visual effects (as when the disaster is a fire, flood, tsunami, volcano, earthquake). So all you see if sick people and people who are try to avoid them.
B0080CL0HM|1.0|This was a bad film with a bad script with terrible directing and the worst performance from Pattinson and Thurman that I have seen. Please do not bother.
B0032UYFA6|5.0|If you have never seen this show you'll love it. My wife and I watched the entire season in two nights. The show is addicting, forget Meth.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Really great series ---too bad it wasn't longer. Cast was outstanding and the writers did a great job with the stories as well.
030758836X|3.0|Great psychological thriller but the language that the author insisted on using to perpetuate a word that should no longer be in the dictionary used to degrade women I felt was unacceptable.  The author should have tried to expand her vocabulary to find another way to speak about a woman's anatomy then to stoop to the level of a man speaking disrespectfully of a woman.  Don't recommend reading important to uphold your principle's and standard's and not permit such language as an everyday conversation.  It will after this book is read.

Sure, there's some philosophy and some broad ideas, but then you get these clear, easy to understand nuggets that are easily implemented.  It makes you feel kind of bad sometimes because you're like, \\"Bah!  He makes it sound so easy!\\"  And now I've said \\"easy\\" entirely too much.<br /><br />Fabulous book.  Highly recommended.

B004JN1D2I|4.0|This is an incredible series. Lots of plotting suspense, mystery and of course action. Only gripe is that it it's a pretty dense read and sometimes it just moves really slow, add on one or two fairly annoying characters and some chapters really drag. But this is quite infrequent and the rest of the book(s) makes up for this.

0446547573|5.0|I knew that author Nicholas Sparks' books were bestsellers and popular movies have been based on some of them, but this is the first Sparks book that I have read. I have not seen the movies. I started reading this book and thought, at first, that this was an overly syrupy romance novel.  But the writing was strong, and the book steadily drew me in. It's the story of Katie, a young woman who tries to start a new life in a small North Carolina town. She wants to escape a troubled past. This basic story line has, of course, appeared many times before, but likely not in quite the touching way that it is presented by Sparks.<br /><br />One of the characters is a demonically cruel man who abuses his wife. Another character is a kind man who is devoted to his two young children. How the lives of Katie and these two men intersect is the heart of the matter.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil it at all. I found myself eagerly turning the pages, resisting the urge to look ahead. It builds to a very exciting conclusion.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

0805095535|2.0|I'm generally a huge fan of Paul Auster's work, and so I looked forward with great anticipation to his Winter Journal, a quasi-informal memoir of his life so far, up to age 64.  Unfortunately, the book was a let down in both style and content and to be honest, I can't imagine this writing getting published by anyone who was not an established name.  At least, even when it is an established name, there's an interesting life there if not interesting writing, but even though Auster has lived an interesting life, it isn't here on the page, and so we have a relatively banal content merged with a relatively banal style. Not a great combo obviously.<br /><br /> It's a non-linear, impressionistic memoir that calls up semi-random recollection of his life from his earliest memories through childhood, adolescence, first marriage, second marriage, middle-age, and his recent years. We circle a lot around his relationship with two women in particular--his wife and his mother. But there is little to compel in either. He loves his wife; he's sad his mother died.  He wishes he knew his mother better; he wishes his first marriage hadn't ended badly.  Sure, there's a little more to it than that, but really only a little more. It's a slim book after all and he covers a lot more ground. Sometimes filling the pages with lists (lists of food, lists of travel destinations, lists of schools.  A list of places he has lived is made slightly more interesting by according each place a few paragraphs rather than a single phrase, but they rarely distinguish themselves in either setting or language and so are quickly forgotten.  The slim book is also a bit padded not only with the lists but with a strangely lengthy synopsis of a movie and a few pages of notes from a building co-op meeting, which are actually some of the most interesting and captivating writing in the book, but which unfortunately written by Auster's wife.<br /><br /> A few examples of the everyday quality of both the experiences depicted and the language they are depicted in:<br /> Ladybugs were considered good luck. If one of them landed on your arm, you were supposed to make a wish before it flew away.  Four-leaf clovers were also agents of good fortune, and you spent countless hours in your early childhood on your hands and knees in the grass, searching for those small prizes, which did indeed exist but were found only rarely and therefore were a cause for much celebration.  Spring was heralded by the appearance of the first robin, the brown, re-breasted bird who would suddenly and unaccountably show up in your backyard one morning, hopping around on the grass and digging for worms.<br /><br />  Save for a single word--\\"unaccountably\\"--it's easy to imagine this same paragraph coming in a middle-school personal narrative.  And not a highly regarded one.<br /><br />  The same happens throughout the book, whether he's talking about schools: \\"Everyone who lives in the district can go for free,\\" \\"You had some good teachers and some mediocre teachers; or death \\"We are all going there,\\" \\"death was inside you and didn't want to die.\\"  There are of course moments of startling language, but they are too few and far between. At times, one gets a sense that even Auster realizes the mundanity of much of the book, as when he says \\"You were hardly the first son in the world to find himself in this position,\\" a kind of half-apologetic phrasing that comes up a few times.<br /><br />I hope Auster lives a good many more years, both for himself and for the pleasure I derive in his writing. And also because I hope another 20 years might give him something to write about in another, more interesting memoir.  Not recommended, sadly.
B005LAIIRQ|2.0|Man, I knew that this movie was going to be a dour survival actioner but...really?  \\"The Grey\\" played out somewhat like Ten Little Indians where the characters keep getting knocked off one by one.  There was really very little suspense in this; certain situations were just ripe for the loss of the next would-be survivor, like when the group passes over a gorge on a makeshift rope.  You just knew that the last guy was gonna drop.  The wolves, a major action point for this movie, are always present yet somehow strangely muted.  They're not believable.  They're more like something out of a bad horror movie.  The survivors aren't given any immediate significant backstory and so we aren't asked to care about these guys, and Neeson's John Ottway character is a man who is walking through the shadows of this life; he's already more dead than alive and he knows it.  But the movie still tries to make him the moral center and savior of the desperate crash victims, and so there's supposed to be more weight and gravitas to the things he says like when he recites his father's poem, or when he tells his fellow followers that they are right to care about their loved ones, or when he asserts himself as the alpha wolf of his pack but then tells his litter mate, \\"It's okay to be afraid.  You're stupid if you're not afraid\\"  It all comes across as platitudinal and by movie's end we all feel like we're the stupid ones for being tricked into watching this turkey.  But perhaps the greatest downfall of this movie about existential survival is that it doesn't give us anything really meaty or impressive to chew on, it just gives those big, fake wolves some actors to sink their teeth into.  There could have been something more there if it honestly explored the themes of faith and doubt, as one would expect would be generated by the events that befall these poor people, but the passing points it puts in these character's mouths are really trivial at best.  The ending is a fill-it-in-yourself affair, something which the masses really hate I think.  That didn't bother me so much but it will a lot of people and it will shut the lid for them on this flick.<br /><br />In closing I'll offer that if you want to see a good movie about existential survival and animals eating humans then check out the underappreciated \\"The Ghost and the Darkness\\".  It may cause you to think a little, you may jump a little, and by movie's end you won't feel like you've been ripped off.ffair, something which the masses really hate I think.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|I've read this before and loved it.  I wanted to read it again and could do so again and again.  The emotion behind the action and followup is something indescribable.  The followup to this book is highly recommended (\\"Service: A Navy Seal at War\\").  Marcus Luttrell gives due credit to the Teams, his comrades and those who have prepared for and fought so valiantly for the just cause of good that it gives me an even greater respect for the men and women in uniform.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|I was very reluctant to read the 2nd Grey Book after my complete disappointment with the first one.  The reviews from friends and co-workers about these books were all over the board.  Some loved the book, others were ethically disturbed by it, and some hated it.  The 1st book was a let down on two fronts.  When I read the book I tried to be open minded so that I could give it a fair shot.  What I found was that it lacked the storyline and depth to be a romantic classic and it lacked the details to adequately connect readers to the sensual experiences.  Bottom line - it wasn't romatic enough to be Jane Austin and wasn't dirty enough to be soft porn.  Tragically it fell into the realm of \\"why did I waste my time reading this?\\"<br /><br />My friend convinced me that I should read the second book because it had a better story line.  True - it does have a better story line than the first - there was more time devoted to developing the characters and defining the relationship.  The sensual scenes were more developed so there was more of a reaction to them.  However, I am still unconvinced that this is worthy of all of the buzz that has surrounded it and I do not feel compelled to finish the series.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|My daughter loaned this to me, I'm sure glad she did. Very easy to read, and the writer paints a picture, so that you feel like your right there. She does so briefly, just the right amount without going to much in details that you get bored.  Excellent book, the movie doesn't do this book justice..

0375842209|5.0|Have you ever... come across a book that so profoundly changed your life and blew you away that you immediately started buying copies for all your family and friends, just so that they can go through the same experience as you?<br /><br />Have you ever... been tempted to thrust a book at the unknown person sitting next to your table at Starbucks (and all the more if they were holding in their hands a copy of *cough*Twilight*cough*)?<br /><br />Have you ever... stopped everything else in your life to read a book, till dirty laundry started piling and filthy dishes were stacked high, until you got to the point where you sacrificed the basic necessities of food and sleep in order to finish a book?<br /><br />Have you ever... read a book and been touched by an unexplainable feeling inside of you, one that rocked you to the core and made you want to laugh, scream, swear, and cry all at the same time?<br /><br />Everything I mentioned above is what I went through when I made the decision to pick up The Book Thief. The book itself tells a rather conventional story. Yet the narration, the whole epic scope and the incredibly beautiful words that you don't just read, but make you feel as if you were in the story with Leisel is what makes this book so outstanding and mindblowing.<br /><br />This novel is narrated by Death, an ironic, cynical being who is haunted by humans. He narrates the extraordinary life of Leisel Meminger with grace, humour and empathy, and the author doesn't ask that you sympathize with the Jews, but he merely presents the story and characters as they are. The novel moves slowly, with a leisurely pace and long descriptions, but it was necessary in order to write the story. The author slowly introduced the characters, so we are able to grow to love Leisel, Hans, Rudy, Max, and even Rosa.<br /><br />However, I can understand how this book may not be for everyone. Not everyone can enjoy having an absent- minded, inexplicable, cynical, and unmethodical narrator. Some may not appreciate the way the author portrayed \\"Death.\\" Death, haunted by humans, unwilling to collect innocent souls that perished in the Holocaust? It's a bit out of the ordinary, a bit unbelievable, and maybe even too loose a concept.<br /><br />Except I just fell in love with everything in this novel, and thought it was so completely astounding that when I finished, I immediately headed for my local book store and bought 30+ copies for all my family and friends. I sent them all in the mail, with a tiny note saying: \\"Read this. I dare you not to cry.\\" Yes, I know, I'm... weird like that. But if that's not complete adoration for a book, then I don't know what is.<br /><br />**A final note:** this book is not specifically geared towards Young Adults (despite the fact that it's placed on the YA bookshelf). The author did not have any intention to label The Book Thief into a specific category, so don't pick up this book reluctant to read it simply because it's labeled as a YA novel.

030758836X|4.0|I purchased this book based on an Amazon recommendation and the high review \\"stars\\" that it has.<br />I didn't read the description so I had no idea what it was about or what to expect, which always seems to help my enjoyability level for a book.<br />I started it on the plane for my last vacation and from that point, couldn't put it down.  Right from the start it was very intriguing - I had no idea what happened to Amy!<br /><br />This was such a page-turner I finished it much quicker than I had hoped.  BUT, with that said, the ending was terrible.  Minor spoiler alert: there's no closure.  Absolutely no resolution to this story.  Flynn just ended the book.  It's almost like she gave up and couldn't think of an appropriate ending.  The whole build up to Amy's return and her clever and obviously disturbed planning and mental state - and then that was it.  Guess she just felt like she couldn't top her suprising return?<br />Very bad ending.  I was so disappointed with the anticlimactic, blunt closure.<br />I am still giving it 4-stars since up until - literally - the last few pages, I was enthralled!  Wonderful, wonderful read.  But horrible ending.<br />I feel cheated.

0765365278|4.0|Well, I totally missed that this was the only book in the series available! I hate when you get sucked into a story line then have to wait years in between, (a la George Martin)... and why take a 'break' and write a completely different story in-between?  Oh well, I just hope I remember enough about the story by time the next one comes along.<br />I enjoyed the story, a little too much warfare for my usual interest but I think the main characters were interesting enough to stay involved, although there are a couple of threads that sort of went no where so now I wonder why. I'm sure we'll see more details later, but again, I don't want another Game of Thrones which had way too many story lines that went no where.<br /><br />Strongly recommend the book to anyone who enjoys this genre. Fun and engaging.
0345803485|1.0|What can I possibly say about E.L. James' Fifty Shades of Grey that hasn't already been said in the news, on TV, or in the 11,000+ reviews that have already been posted on Amazon?  Rather than summarizing the plot, I'll give my thoughts on why this book is a bestseller and also why it shouldn't be. First, why it shouldn't be:<br /><br />If you know the book's story, then you know it was originally written as fan fiction for the Twilight series. Fan fiction is where readers borrow an author's characters and write their own story lines about them. While the majority of fan fiction is also written poorly, it has a strong following.People just don't want to say good-bye to their favorite vampire or heroine after the original author has closed the book.<br /><br />That poor quality shines through in the writing of Fifty Shades. It suffers from the overuse of a middle grade thesaurus. For example, every time Ana is around Mr. Grey she either blushes or loses her breath: Her breath hitches, she thaws, she blushes, her heart stops, she turns beet red, she blanches, she glows...you get the idea. The overuse of descriptions to say the same thing over and over is a sure sign of amateur writing or at least of an editor that should quit his day job.<br /><br />Next, the two lead characters are clich&eacute;s of nothing more than a Harlequin romance, and badly clich&eacute;d at that.  Ana is presented as a stupid innocent blond, at times defiant, but also lazy and winy, a sex object in need of  a strong male character to show her the way and care for her. At first, Mr. Grey is painted as a dashing rich and handsome hero who turns all the ladies heads, but later becomes an effeminate puppet with emotional issues who enjoys dominating women.  He basically becomes the \\"gay\\" best friend that many chicks fell in love with back in high school or college who would never reciprocate that feeling.  I'd almost bet money he represents a gay friend who E.L. James herself had feelings for.<br /><br />Put bad writing and bad characters together and there really is no hope.  So why are people reading it and making James and her publisher rich?<br /><br />The book was first self-published, an industry with its own reputation for poorly executed books being churned out by the thousands every year, most who won't see sales past their author's own bookshelf. But remember, James already had a strong following from her fan fiction. And let's face it, sex sells. Once you get beyond the bad writing, you really have nothing outside of the Playboy Confessions pieces some of us actually read after we were done with the pretty pictures. In steps Random Houses who took notice of James' self-pub success and wanting a piece of the action.  The book soon got global distribution, professional reviews, and got people to talking. Next thing you know, \\"mommy porn\\" is on the NYT bestseller list and Hollywood came calling. Those are the things that authors' dreams are made of - those who can write and those who cannot.<br /><br />As society dictates, we all want to do what our friends are doing.  So, if your best friend is reading Fifty Shades, then you want to read it too. And so on and so on.  That's exactly how I picked it up.  Being a strong fan of the written word, I love the effects a simple book can have on our culture.  How does a book like this get people reading, who probably haven't read a book since Dick and Jane back in grade school?  I wanted to find out for myself, and the results were quite humorous. No, it's not the next great American novel or some classic literature piece Oprah is \\"blushing\\" over. Instead, it's badly written sex scenes laced together with a bad storyline. What does that say about our society?  I've read Facebook posts from drunken friends that held more merit.<br /><br />But still, any book (good or bad) that puts a dollar in a bookstore's cash register these days is a book worth some kind of merit, no matter how bad its written. I respect the book and E.L. James for that. As for those of us who enjoy a book that doesn't lower our IQ, I suggest you turn fifty shades in the other direction.E.L. James for that. As for those of us who enjoy a book that doesn't lower our IQ, I suggest you turn fifty shades in the other direction.

B005FISBTO|3.0|I am totally in agreement with BB's comments of Aug.18th.  The LONG Showtime promo at the beginning of each disc (the same one by the way, repeated) with an imposed inability to skip it is despicable.  That being said, Season 6 is not that bad but what limits the show from being great is the supporting cast.  Their characters are bland, predictable and developed and manipulated to fit a given storyline.  Further, (opinion only) they are just not good actors, or perhaps it's because Michael C. Hall is so good that he makes them look bad.  All of them, Jennifer Carpenter included, would be better at home on a daytime soap opera.  And am I the only one that found the developing storyline about Deb's feelings for Dexter just a bit creepy?
B00000I4XR|5.0|I bought this DVD to replace my old VHS. The quality was better of course being that it has been digitally remastered. All the extras were there and then some. It is allot nicer not having to change tapes in order to watch the outtakes and other footage. The price was just about the best I found on the net. The only drawback was that there was no tracking info.(I'm kind of a nut for that as I have a P.O. box and like to know when things come in) Other than that the disc arrived quickly and in perfect shape.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|With all the dark things going on around us, this is refreshing and fun! Every married couple should read and go crazy! Really enjoyed it... It opens your mind :0)
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love it! Book 3 was my favorite! But I loved the series. Sad I'm done. It was written very well and really made you want to keep reading!
0316066524|5.0|I found \\"infinite Jest\\" to be an incredibly well written, thoroughly enjoyable novel exploring many facets of the American cultural experience. In many ways a scathing indictment on our entertainment/celebrity culture, it was also rollicking good fun.  David foster Wallace is a brilliant writer and his prose is superb. \\" Infinite Jest\\" is an American classic and should be experienced by every literate individual.
B007L96VCY|2.0|I had forgotten the reason I never bought Ram when it was first issued, but now I remember. It stunk then and still stinks today. Hopes had been high after McCartney's quite excellent first solo album following the break-up of the Beatles, but for Sir Paul it has been mostly all downhill from there. The only reason his records sell at all is that people must think that because he was so good with the Beatles, that his genius will continue eternally. But if you really stop and think of all the silly and commercial crap he has issued over the years, that notion evaporates.<br />Listening to this remastered album, I find that it doesn't even sound as good as the original which didn't sound good at all. But at least you get a CD of \\"bonus\\" outtakes and rejected songs that ease the pain of money poorly spent. It is actually better than the principal recording and contains two, count 'em, two, worthwhile tunes. Those are the pop smash Another Day and a rollicking Great Cock and Seagull Race. That's it!<br />One can only imagine what they did to the poor ram, but at least the packaging is an attractive six-panel digipak accompanied by an attached booklet containing lyrics to songs on the original album plus lots of Paul and Linda pictures if anybody cares. This one is going to spend a lot of time gathering dust. If you are a McCartney completeist, you'll have to have it. Otherwise, take my advice and save your cash.
B008MM9630|2.0|This game was fun at first, but then my kindle fire's screen kept freezing up. AND I had to restart my kfire because this game had a virus or something that messed up a lot of stuff. DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!!!!
B007X4ECLY|3.0|Fans of bad sci fi action will likely enjoy this movie.  I'd give it a 2.5 but you can't give half stars. I'll round up because the movie surprised me a few times with witty moments that brightened up the otherwise lackluster film.  Enough so in fact that I'm sure I'll watch it again someday.<br />The setup for the story is very simple, good guy gets himself in trouble, has to perform a suicide rescue mission to get out of trouble.  It happens to be set in a giant space jail which adds a few enjoyable twists to the old formula.<br />The plot itself was barely passable.  The logic pushing the movie along was suspect at times and downright terrible at other times.  The prisoner escape scene that begins the riot is just plain ludicrous.  However, the confused plot still allowed for a good run of action balanced with a slow/funny character development scenes.  And the twist at the end might have been predictable but it raised the bar a bit.<br />Guy Pierce was the saving grace of the movie, he surprisingly made a great gruff sarcastic soldier.  His one liners were typical, but witty and drew some good laughs.  The other acting was pretty standard bad action movie acting.  Nothing surprising there.<br />The special effects were a mixed bag.  Some good, some very bad.<br />So that's that, just know what you're getting into and crack open a few beers or chow down some popcorn while getting in some good laughs/explosions/fun.
B004LQGXPA|5.0|I first saw this film when I was on R&R from Vietnam in 1970.  It was in Waikiki, Honolulu which was full of hippies and drug dealers.  Given the anti-war sentiment at the time, I was surprised to find a theater full of these types who loved Patton.  This is one of the few \\"war\\" movies which does not glorify it.  Most films fade in time as they have little relevance to generations which follow.  This film is perfect as the first time I saw it a lifetime ago.  George C. Scott was so into his role I've always believed he actually thought he WAS Patton.  A classic for everyone, for all time.
B0061PEAUY|1.0|Seriously, just don't. It will mess with your head and your heart. That being said, don't bother with this book. It is so tiresome. Reichs needs to hang it up, or at the very least, try a new formula. Her tired old crap is paraded out yet again in \\"Bones Are Forever\\". Once upon a time, I adored Kathy Reichs. Her novels were fresh and exciting, they made me think, they dodged and wove. Now things are so rote, they leave nothing to the imagination. A body is discovered, maybe a few, blah blah blah. Sexual tension that leads nowhere, blah blah blah. A dream and some nagging suspicions which lead to no fewer than 3 solid paragraphs of Tempe asking rapid-fire questions to herself. And finally, Tempe going off on her own against instinct and instruction and getting attacked/knocked unconscious and waking up in the hospital with Andy at her side. Jeez. It's time to pick up Cornwell or Roberts.
B005DOKM9M|4.0|This product has met my needs for protecting my new Kindle Fire. It was a very tight fit in the beginning, but the sleeve is loosening up as it is being used and will turn out to be very adequate for its purpose. The sleeve is certainly stylish and well-made. Thank you.
B00003CX9W|5.0|this is back to the original edition of the movie<br />I appreciate that, having seen it when it first opened<br />and then saw cut up versions among the 70 or 80 times I saw it since, over the many years
0385737947|4.0|I don't like this book.  I won't recommend it. Yet I can't stop talking about it.  I think it frustrates me that the characters went through so much only to realize at the end that we still have so many unanswered questions. I understand it's a trilogy...but I am getting the feeling that I won't like where the book is going...especially since they've already gone through so much.  Once I got about 5% into the book, I couldn't put it down.  Yet I don't like it. I don't like the...mechanical bestiality, I don't like the ridiculousness of it...It wants to follow the footsteps of the Hunger Games, but it is missing the ability for readers to relate to any specific character.<br /><br />It's an interesting read--but I wish I hadn't read it.  I want to read the other two books but I don't want to go on the journey with the characters.  So maybe it's a good book and I just don't like the story because of what happens....
B009329ZF2|1.0|There was no doubt in my mind that this movie would be bad, but I rented it the very second it was available.  That shows how pathetic I am.  But this movie  is worse.  There are so many countless bad things about this movie that detailing any one or two or fifty-two of the worst of the fifty-five-hundred truly pathetic moments would be an absolutely pathetic waste of time.  There is a moment or two when ACDC music pumps adrenaline into the pathetic anti-alien efforts.  I type this now during one of those moments.  Anyways, save your money, or better yet take your money and burn it.  It will be far better spent as ash then on this trash.  XOXO The King.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|If you have been following the Independent game scene, you you know that this industry is no longer fully underground.  Within it, no game developer on the scene has succeeded with that they do as well as thatgamecompany.  This company, founded by Jenova Chen, is becoming one of the most promising and exciting game developers in the video game industry.  thatgamecompany's games teem with life, beauty, and emotion.  Now, they just seem to be getting started. As the company is no longer tied down to a single developer with a small budget, I don't see their vision conforming to any sort of regression.  I can only see their visions for gaming going through the roof.  If they are able to do so, thatgamecompany could be THE indie game company to beat.<br /><br />First, before I dive in, I want to take a route and warn customers: This package may not have value if you own a lot of the material.  First, though, the contents of the collection themselves.  I divided the review in three sections, so feel free to skip which sections you are not interested in.<br /><br />THE GAMES THEMSELVES<br /><br />For those of you who aren't familiar with this company, thatgamecompany focuses on delivering games that provide emotion, beauty, meaning, non-violent experiences, and communication.  All of their games are highly worth playing, emphasizing a quality experience over other re-playability factors such as extra goals and side challenges.  None of the games are particularly lengthy, and none of their games really have much traditional replay value (\\"unlockables\\", \\"pointless simulators of real life menial labor\\" \\"high score achievements\\", \\"collecting\\", etc.  Actually, personally, I dislike most of these game play elements).  But that's not a bad thing.  As a matter of fact, these games prove that a gaming experience is galaxy more valuable than any thing else in gaming.  Read Jonathan Blow's blog post entitled \\"Why Aren't Video Games Satisfying?\\" (on the website for his new game, The Witness), and you might understand why these games are very special.<br /><br />thatgamecompany's video games, here on one disc, are all excellent.  Journey is easily the star here, as Journey is definitely one of the most amazing games in recent memory.  In fact, it's easily the best game I've played in 2012 so far (though my prediction for GOTY will be Dishonored).  Journey is an interactive parable, designed to be ambiguous and open ended, so the player himself can make the work truly his own personal journey (yes, the title of the game is very accurate).  It's praise for the game is really not hyperbole, it's an amazing melange of music, visuals, game play, and sound, all come together and mesh into one.  While it's much too in depth to get into here, Journey also uses multi-player in one of the most meaningful ways in gaming (read up Chen's explanation on that).  I don't want to spoil too much, but as an allegory released in the 21st century, Journey is one of the best games I've experienced.  No joke, it's that good.  Yeah, no matter your feeling towards \\"artistic\\" games, make the exception.  Journey is a must play experience.<br /><br />The other two titles are much smaller in content, but still terrific.  fl0w, which was part of Jenova Chen's master thesis regarding Dynamic difficulty adjustment, deals with using an aquatic micro-organism, which grows as it consumes other micro-organisms.  It's simple enough, but it's also a wonderfully soothing.  Visually, it does a wonderful job with capturing the experience of evolution and the biology of life itself, like a more evocative Spore.  Flower, one of the most well known indie titles on the Playstation platform, is also gorgeous.  Flower also has a terrific sound track to back up the visuals, I definitely do feel that these two games show their budget, as both games sometimes feel more like experimental pieces.  Having that said, I think that's a good thing.  Even better, both games are also short and memorable,like a great animated short.  Needless to say, all three games are unique, and worth the price for any gamer.<br /><br />In fact, each of the games here really do have a personal meaning, especially to the makers who created the video games.  Flower, for example, is pretty much akin to Chen's experience with moving to California from China, and what the settings and environment meant to him.  At the same time, the games are also a personal experience, letting players themselves get what they want out of the games.  Personally, that's the great thing about these games.  Aside from the fact that they play well, feel unique and fresh, you really can't go wrong with games that are almost guaranteed to move you and are specifically made to inspire a wide range of emotions in their works.  If this sounds even remotely appealing to you, then these games were made for you.  Oh, and if you are a fan of Team Ico, also give these games a try.  Chen considers Fumito Ueda one of his prime influences.<br /><br />BONUS FEATURES<br /><br />First, I do think that one set of the features are sort of lackluster.  The three little mini-games, created as small diversions from the main games, are nice enough.  Unfortunately, I found their appeal to be extremely limited.  They aren't too much different from a flash game, and I find flash games extremely limited in replay value, and these ones were no exception.  Worse, the games have little to nothing artistic about them, and they don't provide all that much emotional depth, and really just feel like they are just a way pass the time.  Fun, but mostly a waste of time.  Needless to say, it's not worth buying the collection for them, and I don't see myself ever playing these games regularly.<br /><br />Fortunately though, everything else is great.  In particular, the play through commentary is one of the strongest points, as it truly gives out some great anecdotes regarding the nature of the games on display.  Like you might expect from a director's commentary, the commentary provided here provides for some truly interesting details, one that really inflates your appreciation for the games.  I also particularly enjoyed the concept art, given that the artistic style is a huge influence on what makes these games brilliant.  Flipping through them gives the same thrill you might get from enjoying a concept art book or a bonus gallery on a DVD.  There's not too much to say here, other than the fact you get it for all three games, and they are highly worth going back to again and again.  After all, the art in these games are so gorgeous as it is; I think they pretty much belong in a museum.  Heck, it's better than most things you find in a modern museum.<br /><br />The sound tracks that are included are beautiful.  I won't comment on each individual track, but the music is beautiful, inspiring, heart-rendering, and absolutely lovely.  Just take a listen for yourself, and you will understand.  On the XMB side, the collection offers special Crossbar themes and avatars.  As someone who has about twenty unique Crossbar themes on his hard drive, I can't help but get excited at what you get in the package, as they are all terrific.  Avatars, ditto, as they often can say a lot about who you are as a gamer based on the picture (a picture, as they say, is a thousand words).<br /><br />The trailer and developer diaries are also well developed, and the trailers themselves capture the game rather well.  After all, some video game trailers (Dishonored, BioShock Infinite) are works of art in themselves, and it highly applies to these trailers as well.  They are definitely worth viewing on their own.  The developers diaries I also particularly enjoyed.  Too often I feel that the developers themselves have no love at all for their audience, and never at once care about sharing what makes the games they make special.  Well, thatgamecompany is different.  When they speak, they provide some insight, and they never wasted mytime here.  They are definitely worth watching, and they really do a great job showing what drives the company in their quest to make personal games.<br /><br />Finally, the 30 minute Journey documentary follows suit. It was clear that Journey was primed to be a great experience from the beginning, with each member on the team with the intention to do so.  Thankfully, the 30 minute documentary definitely fleshes this one out, and by the end of the documentary, you will definitely appreciate the game much more.<br /><br />Finally, the package contains a one month free subscription to PlaystationPlus.  I'm not going to waste your time explaining the benefits of PP, so if you are interested, check out the benefits, which include, among other things, free downloadable games, as well as discounts and special online features.  Having said that, it's not worth buying for the package.  It's a trivial bonus, and nothing else.<br /><br />OVERALL<br /><br />As a big fan of the company, I was very much pleased with this collection.  I actually just owned Journey at first, and I'm glad I invested in these games, because Flower and Flow are both terrific as well.  Needless to say, these games are easily among the best indie games you can find out there.  Needless to say, it's game companies like these that make me happy for the future of gaming.  I do think the collection leads towards the newcomers, but that shouldn't stop you from checking out this collection.  Just be prepared for this company.  Keep an eye out for them.

1119963192|5.0|I found swim smooth on the web a few years ago and started adjusting my stroke to their methods. If you are a serious open water or competitive swimmer, you owe it to yourself to check this out.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|This is a fabulous movie. It has everything going for it, a great storyline, great acting, great animation! I decided to replace our VHS with a DVD and am very glad that I spent a little extra for this 2010 Special Edition re-issue of this 1995 classic.<br /><br />When you go to the Bonus Features Menu, the Commentary track is listed as the second extra, but I'm going to cover it first. I've listened to a lot of Audio Commentary tracks (you watch the movie, and they are commenting while the movie is in progress about what's happening) and I really enjoyed this one. Participants in the commentary: John Lasseter (director and co-writer), Andrew Stanton (co-writer), Pete Doctor (supervising animator), Ralph Eggleston (art director), Bill Reeves (supervising technical director), Bonnie Arnold (co-producer), Ralph Guggenheim (co-producer).<br /><br />The first thing they talked about, because it's the introduction that sets the stage for the whole movie, is the beginning song by Randy Newman, &quot;You've Got a Friend in Me&quot;. As Bonnie says, the movie's &quot;songs actually told about an emotional moment in the film, [rather than] the character singing about those things.&quot; It's a shortcut, and very effective, for giving the audience all the background it needs to understand what happens when Buzz Lightyear interlopes.<br /><br />The movie has a mix of real-life toys and made-up toys.  For the real-life toys, they had to receive permission to use them in the movie. As one man said, &quot;The hours I spent on the phone with Mr. Potato Head's lawyer, just trying to work out the use of Mr. Potato Head in our movie.&quot;  It was no small thing for the image-conscious manufacturer. When we first meet Sid, the toy torturer next door, he is about to blow up a Combat Carl infantryman. They had really wanted to use G.I. Joe, but Hasbro refused the rights to use Joe if they were going to blow him up.<br /><br />And speaking of soldiers, I think we all love the green plastic soldiers, marching while attached to their little stands. And we are so wrapped up in the movie that we can, as a commenter says, &quot;suspend disbelief&quot; so far that it seems logical that the sergeant can actually see through his green plastic binoculars.<br /><br />Remember when they're trying to rescue Buzz by using a ladder made from the &quot;Barrel of Monkies&quot; game?  The line &quot;We need more monkies!&quot; always cracks me up. And they started using it around the studio. When they needed another person for a job it was &quot;We need more monkies!&quot;<br /><br />Lastly, you may have to listen to the commentary to answer these questions:<br />What is &quot;The Big Cheat&quot;?<br />Where do you need to know Morse Code?<br />Can you catch all the homages made to the creators' favorite movies?<br /><br />Here are the Bonus Features on the DVD disc of this great [[ASIN:B0030IIYWA Toy Story (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo in Blu-ray Packaging)]]:<br /><br />1.  &quot;Toy Story3: Sneak Peek&quot; (2:02 minutes) This is a preview-like short where &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; director, Lee Unkrich, gives us a peek for the then-forthcoming 3rd movie. TS3 was released in Nov. 2010, while the Special Editions of 1 &amp; 2 were released in March 2010.<br />2.  Audio Commentary<br />3.  &quot;Buzz Lightyear Mission Logs: Episode 1: Blast Off&quot; (3:27) This is a great little introduction to the space shuttle and space station, with lots of real on-location footage provided by NASA. It looks like a Buzz Lightyear figure actually made it into space on the Discovery!<br />4.  &quot;Paths to Pixar - Artists&quot; (4:49) Four people tell how they got to Pixar and where they worked on &quot;Toy Story&quot;. Tia Crater tells, &quot;When I started I had a business card that said 'Tia Crater - Imperfectionist'. Because it was my job to mess up everything that was created so perfectly in the films&quot;. In other words, smooth hair to be messed, etc.<br />5.  &quot;Studio Stories: John's Car&quot; (1:27) The three studio stories are great. They are like storyboard clip reels with cute simple graphics. This first one is about director John Lasseter's car, called the &quot;death box car&quot; - over 500,000 miles and looked every inch of those miles. Narrated by Glen McQueen and Darla K. Anderson.<br />6.  &quot;Studio Stories: Baby AJ&quot; (1:38) Narrated by A.J. Rieble. A J tells how he won the Halloween costume contest one year. Truly above and beyond the call of duty!<br />7.  &quot;Studio Stories: Scooter Races&quot; (2:16) In 1991, Pixar was a small company and they'd just moved into a big building that had lots of empty space. They started riding motorized scooters for fun and then they started racing. And then the racing got very fierce. Very funny short, narrated by Pete Doctor and Andrew Stanton.<br />8.  &quot;Buzz Takes Manhattan&quot; (2:13) In 2008, Buzz Lightyear was a giant balloon in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. It was a dream come true for John Lasseter, who by this time was the Chief Creative Officer for Pixar &amp; Disney Animation. Lasseter and Roger Gould (now Creative Director for Pixar Theme Parks) star in these movie clips about raising and pulling the balloon. As Lasseter says, &quot;He was MEANT to be a balloon, cause he was FLYING!&quot;<br />9.  &quot;Black Friday: The Toy Story You never Saw&quot; (7:36) This extra makes the Special Edition totally worth it. Wow. This is the very beginning, where Pixar was storyboarding &quot;Toy Story&quot;, to be the very first full-length future done 100% on the computer. Everything had to go through Disney. Disney kept wanting multiple changes, and, in particular, Jeffrey Katzenberg &quot;would rip them apart&quot;. He wanted the story more edgy, more cynical and more adult.<br />John Lasseter explains how the Pixar crew finally went down to Disney with about half the movie storyboarded into a movie with voice acting (though not by the actors who would be hired to do the final film)- the way they thought Disney wanted it. The character of Woody took the brunt of the rewrite, becoming unappealing and even mean. Lassiter cringes and covers his face in his hands as he introduces part of the reel that was showed Disney on what they dubbed &quot;Black Friday&quot;. You will not believe it when you see it. It is mean-spirited and something you might see on [adult swim], but not a Pixar-Disney movie. Pixar hated it, and so did Disney.<br />Disney tried to shut them down, but Lasseter pleaded for two weeks reprieve while they reworked the story. In two weeks, in a giant collective of brains and enthusiasm, PIxar totally redid &quot;Toy Story&quot; the way they wanted it, and came up with the start of the movie that we now know and love.<br />Commenters in this short include these people, showing their current titles, not their titles as they worked on &quot;Toy Story&quot;: John Lasseter (Chief Creative Officer for Pixar &amp; Disney Animation) , Ed Catmull (President of Pixar &amp; Disney Animation), Pete Doctor (director &quot;Up&quot;), Joe Ranft (co-director &quot;Cars&quot;), Thomas Schumacher (former President Walt Disney Animation), Andrew Stanton (director &quot;Wall-E&quot;).<br />10. &quot;Learn How to Take Your Favorite Movies on the Go&quot; (1:00) This is an ad for digital files of Disney movies.<br /><br />Great extras for a movie that is timeless.<br /><br />This Special Edition for &quot;Toy Story&quot; came out the same time as the Special Edition for &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;.<br />[[ASIN:B0030IIZ56 Toy Story 2 (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo w/ Blu-ray Packaging)]]<br />Many of the Bonus extras on the TS2 issue compliment the extras on &quot;Toy Story&quot;. For example, there are three different Studio Stories, Episode 2 of Buzz's Mission Log, and a &quot;Paths to Pixar&quot; that covers the technical artists. Highly recommended!<br /><br />Happy Reader5.  &quot;Studio Stories: John's Car&quot; (1:27) The three studio stories are great. They are like storyboard clip reels with cute simple graphics.

In two weeks, in a giant collective of brains and enthusiasm, PIxar totally redid &quot;Toy Story&quot; the way they wanted it, and came up with the start of the movie that we now know and love.<br />Commenters in this short include these people, showing their current titles, not their titles as they worked on &quot;Toy Story&quot;: John Lasseter (Chief Creative Officer for Pixar &amp; Disney Animation) , Ed Catmull (President of Pixar &amp; Disney Animation), Pete Doctor (director &quot;Up&quot;), Joe Ranft (co-director &quot;Cars&quot;), Thomas Schumacher (former President Walt Disney Animation), Andrew Stanton (director &quot;Wall-E&quot;).<br />10. &quot;Learn How to Take Your Favorite Movies on the Go&quot; (1:00) This is an ad for digital files of Disney movies.<br /><br />Great extras for a movie that is timeless.<br /><br />This Special Edition for &quot;Toy Story&quot; came out the same time as the Special Edition for &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;.<br />[[ASIN:B0030IIZ56 Toy Story 2 (Two-Disc Special Edition Blu-ray/DVD Combo w/ Blu-ray Packaging)]]<br />Many of the Bonus extras on the TS2 issue compliment the extras on &quot;Toy Story&quot;.

B000003TAR|5.0|this was nirvanas f the world album. nirvana was not thinking about fans or critics or maybe even record sales they just made an album to show what they were intended to be. nevermind was good but in utero was better. it was like elements of their first two albums combined into one.

B004EPYZPS|3.0|I just watched the Super 8 movie and found it to be of great interest and entertaining. Without going into specifics, it really is a movie dealing lives of younger teens, an alien, the local town with its population experiencing havoc from the USAF military trying to catch the alien.<br />  An ideal film for children and adults or the entire family.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Loving these books!! After reading The Hunger Games I could not wait to read Catching Fire.  It did not disappoint. Now, I'm diving into Mockingjay with the same enthusiasm.
0307744434|1.0|I looked forward to reading this book.  Everyone seemed to be talking about it.  It has even received a movie deal. The storyline sounded so interesting, full of a sort of mystical realism.  I didn't want to wait to get it from the library so I purchased the e-book for full price thinking it would be worth the money.<br /><br />I hated it.  There were so many times over the past few days that I was \\"this close\\" to giving up on the book and move onto a new book but I didn't.  I kept thinking that if so many people had liked it, it must get better.  There was one little spot about 3/4 of the way into the book that it did get a tiny bit better but unfortunately, that didn't last.<br /><br />I'm not really sure if I can pinpoint why I disliked this book so much.  Maybe it was because I felt unbalanced while reading because it seemed disjointed with too many characters, too many alternate realities, too much back and forth between chapters.  Or maybe it was because I found it to be a little too unimaginable or maybe it's just that I like my fantasy novels to be rooted in reality a little more than was found it in this book. Or maybe it's because the scene descriptions went on and on but never really created a complete picture in my mind.  Or maybe it's because the plot was such a small small part of this book. I don't know....I just know that I was so happy to be finished with it but also so mad that I had continued reading.  (If you loved The Night Circus, please don't hate on me!!  I tried to like it...I really did!)
B00866JL96|3.0|JK Rowling has the Harry Potter Series, Stephenie Meyer has the Twilight Series, and Nicholas Sparks has the Nicholas Sparks recipe book series. Sparks is the Sparks Author of romantic stories where the main characters usually don't experience the typical happy ending, characters questioning their Christian belief or faith, and whose stories tend to center around a tragedy.  He sells everything he writes and many of his books are readily adapted into blockbuster movies: The Lucky One, The Notebook, The Last Song, A Walk to Remember, Dear John, Message in a Bottle, and Nights in Rodanthe. Though the stories are repetitive and filled with clich&eacute; phrases such as `How do you explain something that you can't even understand yourself?' they do serve an audience hungry for these kinds of tales.  THE LUCKY ONE won't let those people down.<br /><br />Sgt. Logan Thibault (Zac Efron) is a marine serving in Iraq and we are introduced after some lugubrious footage to the actual war scenes in Iraq where Logan finds a photo of a girl with \\"keep safe\\" written on the back. He is admiring it when his unit is attacked. He survives and credits the photo for saving him. He tries to find the owner but can't, assuming he was killed. When he goes back to the States, he finds it difficult to adjust and is still haunted by what happened. Analyzing the photo, he finds in the background a landmark that tells him she is in Louisiana. He then goes there and finds her. He learns her name is Beth (Taylor Schilling), a divorced mother of a cute kid Ben (Riley Thomas Stewart) whose loathsome sheriff ex-husband Keith (Jay R. Ferguson), who happens to be the son of the small town Judge Clayton (Adam LeFevre), makes life miserable for Beth. Beth and her grandmother Ellie (Blythe Danner) still mourn the loss of Beth's brother drake who is still `missing in action' in Iraq. Logan tries to tell her what happened but can't get the words out. She assumes he's there to apply for the job they advertised looking for someone to help at her family's business, a dog kennel. He says yes but at first she gets an uneasy feeling from him but Ellie decides to give him a chance. It isn't long that he makes a connection with Ben and his music ability, has confrontations with Keith, and the rest is entirely predictable Sparks-type ending.<br /><br />Will Fetters adapted this one for the screen and Scott Hicks directs with a rather heavy hand on the organ tremolo. Of the cast Blythe Danner gives her usual excellent professionalism. The rest of the cast is according to the tastes of the viewers. Efron apparently beefed up his physique for the role but forgot to beef up the acting. The film could stand a good editing to relieve the ennui.

B008KP6ENE|4.0|This game is cute and fun and all, but let's be honest. It's too short. There are four worlds, and three levels in each world. each world has a boss level as well, which is usually just hitting the boss three times in some way. Don't get me wrong,though. There is a lot yo love as well. This game is an easy-going time passer. You can customize your character, and try to collect all three paperclips in each level. I beat it in about three hours of non-stop playing. There are a few funny references to Indiana Jones and such. For only 99 cents, you can have a fun adventure game, which, of course, is way cheaper than an Xbox 360 or PS3 game. I reccomend!
B0063FGG22|5.0|Great classic Hitchcock movie which looks amazing in Blu-Ray. We definitely recommend this movie along with \\"To Catch a Thief\\" which is equally great. They just don't make movies today with the vivid color and fluid plots as the Hitchcock classics.
0307456323|3.0|As a huge Audrey Hepburn fan, I have seen this movie countless times.  I love the movie...so I was surprised with how different yet similar the book was to the movie.  Holly Golightly is a blonde with short hair in the book!!  She's supposed to be Audrey Hepburn with her beautiful dark brunette french twist!  The movie version is set in the 1960′s whereas the book is set in the 1950′s!<br /><br />I liked the book.  I can see why Capote is on so many must-read lists but I don't think I can say that this will go down as one of my favorite books.  I can imagine that it must have been scandalous when it was first published in the 1950′s. It's kind of one of those books that I am glad I can now say I've read and put it behind me.  I may have enjoyed the book more if I didn't have the film version so deeply ingrained in my mind, though.
B005LAIHPE|2.0|This movie was ridiculous yet mildly fun. The premise of the US Navy saving the world from alien invasion is borderline stupid it's so ridiculous.  So it had better be fun.<br /><br />Was it fun seeing Liam Neeson play an admiral? Sure.  There was enough story there to make that fun.  I enjoy watching him act in movies even those with ridiculous premises.  I'll say the same for Alexander Skarsgård.  I enjoy watching him act, even if he's a goofy SWO instead of a Viking Vampire.  The movie gets one star for casting them and the rest of the actors were competent as well.  The girl was cute, the Japanese guy was amusing. Etc...<br /><br />I give it another star for the spectacle. Cool special effects applied to the pleasurable task of dramatizing an old battleship blasting the crap out of an alien spacecraft.  Ridiculous, preposterous, yet cool.<br /><br />Beyond that the story was pretty weak, the scripted dialogue contrived.  Worst, I found there was an ambient political correctness that annoyed, this one-world-nations-of-the-world-unite kind of thing.  Not super obnoxious but enough to annoy.<br /><br />Saw it at the dollar theatre and well enough worth it.  It would be fine for a dollar rental of the DVD too.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I just went through to see what game they had and found this one and decided to play. I'm glad I decided to try it because I love it.
0553801473|5.0|I enjoyed this novel very much. It is quite hefty, though. My carpal tunnel gives me fits! Otherwise, a wonderful fantasy novel.
0307346617|3.0|I was so looking forward to reading this book! The premise (an eyewitness recounting of a fictional worldwide zombie attack) sounded fun and so interesting. Unfortunately for me, the book just seemed to drag on and on. Max Brooks wrote the novel in epistolary form, meaning that each chapter was written in the form of an actual interview with various participants/survivors of the zombie war.  The book started out interesting but then seemed to go on forever and with a different narrator every few pages it became quite disjointed for me. There was not one main character that I found myself rooting for (I suppose I was supposed to be rooting for the human race as a whole?).  It is a great premise and I commend Mr. Brooks on the ability to create so many solid characters and twist our modern political system in such a way that was believable but it just wasn't for me.<br /><br />I know that many people have loved this book so while I can't completely recommend it, I also won't completely warn people to stay away from it. It seems to the type of book that you have to pick up and just decide for yourself if it will be worth your time or not.  All that being said, I am looking forward to the movie coming out.  I think it if it is done well, it will make for a great movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played. It is so addicting it is hard to stop. Go Temple Run!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|gave this a try and it is my latest phone game addiction.  once you get the hang of it, and especially once you begin upgrading your equipment, you should be absolutely hooked.  with a little bit of luck, timing and patience the missions can all be beaten without spending any real cash.  best part, once you complete all the missions, you are set up with a new set of missions, but without any sacrifice of your coins or equipment upgrades.  not getting boring at all.  another plus, the game is incredibly thorough.  huge amount of customization with various gadgets, different jetpacks, vehicle upgrades, and the descriptions of each gadget and upgrade are quite humorous at times.  make sure you check out the extensive in-game statistics, too, which are also hilarious.  overall, excellent game and an easy recommendation for all you temple runners.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|one of the best games I've played in a while. the achievements are challenging but fun to do. you'll enjoy this.
0307477479|5.0|I did not read this novel because of the awards it has won (2011 Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award).  I didn't even know that it had won these awards.  I read it because it was brought to my attention and having grown up on the edges of punk-rock culture and in San Francisco it seemed to beg me to read it.<br /><br />Aside from the punk rock/San Francisco storyline, I had no information on the book and truly went into it blindly.  While A Visit from the Goon Squad is considered a novel, it is actually more like a collection of connected short stories.  Each chapter is written from the point of view of a different character and may be set in the past, present or future.  After the first chapter, you will find each chapter to be narrated by a character that was often introduced in the preceding chapter.  It makes for a constant influx of new characters and p.o.v.'s but also adds to the continuity of the short stories.  What was amazing to me is how well the author was able to change her writing style to truly fit the character's p.o.v.  I find that while many authors attempt to do this, very few authors are able to do it as successfully as Egan.<br /><br />This is not a happy-go-lucky novel.  (Aren't most Pulitzer Prize winning novels like that?  Sad and depressing?)  It's rather sad as we watch the characters (many of whom you may be able to relate to) continuously make poor choices.  We watch some characters truly hit bottom as their lives spiral out of control and we watch others who just quietly fade into mediocrity.  I hope that I'm not making the story sound too depressing because it really isn't (well, maybe a little) but it is worth it!  There were times that I laughed out loud.<br /><br />Read this book...especially if you grew up in the 70′s/80′s  or have lived in San Francisco.

0141197706|5.0|I just cannot believe I haven't read this Austen novel before this year!  I went through a Jane Austen phase in my early 20′s and have re-read my favorites a couple of times each since then.  But I never ever read Mansfield Park!  And my goodness, I adored this book!  Fanny is such a wonderful character.  A bit stodgy but she knows who she is and what she wants and she stands by her convictions throughout the book.<br /><br />One of the amazing things about Jane Austen is that while her books are set in the late 18th/early 19th centuries, her themes and humor are still relevant today. I actually laughed out loud a few times while reading Mansfield Park.  I love Fanny....I want to be Fanny!
B008Z9YLV2|3.0|I never read the book, but something tells me the book would have provided the detail the movie lacks. Like, WHY KIDS are selected as Tributes? Wouldn't it be more interesting to the viewing public if fit, buff adults were the Tributes? And why do the authorities get to change the outcomes? And how come there is no bravado/cockiness by the Tributes? If I'd been selected to participate, I'd be training 24/7 and talkin' trash to try to scare the other Tributes. And why are they called The Hunger Games? Who's hungry? Why are they hungry? And why do the normal citizens live like it's 1850? None of this is explained in the movie, so I guess one should read the book first to get a background on why stuff is the way it is. As it is, the film is shallow.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie wasn't worth the hype. The concept has been done before in several movies. To me, it seemed like it's a kid's movie: If you're a cynical, questioning, intelligent adult, I can't see how you wouldn't find the whole film silly. The only reason I gave it three stars is because Jennifer Lawrence gives (as usual) a great performance. She's really turning out to be a wonderful actress. (But her role in Winter's Bone was better than in Hunger.)
B008CP93S0|3.0|Great theme for a movie, and good choices for characters, but could have done better with the plot. Basically, if you see the preview, you have seen the movie.
1416511946|5.0|This book is incredible. Very easy to read, yet hard to stomach in parts. It shows the dark side of fame & fortune. Nikki is an intelligent, talented, creative &  brave individual. If you're a rock fan, you gotta read this book!!!!!!<br /><br /> I also received \\"This is Gonna Hurt\\" Music, Photography, and Life through the distorted lens if Nikki Sixx, last Saturday & finished it on Sunday. AMAZING & INSPIRING !!!!! Great photos, with a very positive message. (much easier on the stomach than the Heroin Diaries.) PLEASE read this one! You won't regret it.
038572179X|5.0|I loved this novel.  It was beautiful but it was also painful.  This is one of those books where you want to shake the book and yell at one of the characters \\"don't do that!\\" or \\"go back!\\" or just plainly \\"do the right thing!\\".  I found Ian McEwan's writing style amazing. His words allowed me to experience the World War II battlefield and the Dunkirk withdrawal in a way that never occurred in my history classes.<br /><br />This is another novel where I saw the movie first.  It was because of the movie that  Atonement has been on my \\"to-be-read\\"  list for a couple of years now.  I'm so glad I finally picked it up to read.  I loved this book!  It is a slow moving book but a deep strong story that I recommend for everyone!
B0090EIILU|1.0|This movie has minimal humor in it.  Many comparisons to common day dictators and in that some humor.  Overall, boring.
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|A great movie for the kids and parents. All time favorite. My little one enjoys it along with the older siblings that get the chance to remember their days with Woody and Buzz.
B004X75RK4|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this movie! This romantic comedy is one of Sandra Bullock's best!  I could watch it over and over and never get sick of it. It is a great date night movie and I would recommend it to anyone!
1476712042|2.0|Okay, first of all, let me say that I've seen this book be categorized as a YA (young adult) novel.  If \\"young adult\\" referred to 18-24 year old readers then that characterization would be fine with me.  But, that's not how it is...kids as young as 12 read YA fiction.  This book is NOT for them.  I don't even think it is appropriate for someone 15 or 16 years old.  There just is too much sex, bad language and inappropriate relationships for \\"developing\\" minds.  (If you're under 18 and reading this...don't hate me!  It's just my mama side coming out.)<br /><br />Now that my little \\"disclaimer\\" is out of the way....This was an interesting read.  I think I had a like it-hate it relationship with it while reading.  I say this because for the first half of the book, I didn't want to put it down (I stayed up until 3am reading it) but the entire time I was reading it, I kept thinking \\"this is stupid\\".  Have you ever had a book like that?.  This wasn't a great book.  I didn't love the writing style.  The relationships are dysfunctional, way dysfunctional.  The protagonist is way too young in my opinion for much of what went on in the book.  But, the author does a decent job at building suspense and defining her characters.  A pet peeve for me was that everyone was constantly smoking in this book...I am very disappointed that the author chose to glamorize smoking.<br /><br />With all of the drinking, partying, and sex, I might have been more comfortable with this book if the protagonist, Abby, had been 22 years old instead of 18 yrs old.  I would just hate for some 13 - 16 yr old to read this and think that this is how relationships should be...but then, I feel this way about the Twilight novels, as well.  It was a fun read and I don't regret reading the book or feel like it was a waste of time but I can't give a full stamp of approval for it either.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|As a therapist, this book struck the wrong chord with me. I'm not that great at grammar, but the author's inability to write only emphasizes the power difference between her and Mr. Grey. I'm all for sexual diversity, however this novel only perpetuates the belief that women can \\"fix\\" a man if she just thoughts out the abuse. I have nothing against a BDSM lifestyle between two consenting adults. Too bad theprotagonistcomes across as an innocent teenager. Shivers would run down my spine during certain sections of the book when she would feel trapped, pressured, and isolated from friends. Seriously, this author must know something about the \\"grooming stage\\" of childhood sexual abusers... because she captures it perfectly in this book.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I had never read this author so I had no opinions about her work.  I could not put it down.  I read every spare second I had.  I even read at stop lights.  It has surprises around every corner.  I am going to look back and see what else she wrote.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|You broke my heart & made me want to sing over and over in this book (books). Thank you so much for not writing a story tailored to children. Books people would put next to these (wont book bash) do not compare, mostly because the emotion they portray is nowhere near as gripping. Please write more, about other Silos, but please dont forget the characters we already have! Im in love and dont think I could bare losing them completely without knowing how it turned out for them. Thank You again, and anyone reading this, Wool is a must read!

0345803507|2.0|So I made it to the last book and think about the hours I've wasted on these characters.  I'm not that fast of a reader, so flushed upwards of 10 hour on these three books and probably a worse person because of it.<br /><br />Never have I been so ashamed of the low brow material that I've read, and I'm a guy that at one time in my adult life had a subscription to Mad Magazine.  Yelp, that is right worse than Mad!<br /><br />So the book takes one to the logical and expected conclusion.  Now Ana and Christian are engaged and finally get married after Christian confronts his past Dominate girlfriend and after he defeats the criminal that plagues their life with terror ranging from being the cause of a fire, downing his helicopter and general terror.<br /><br />The most frustrating part of all of this was that I was sold an empty basket that was supposed to be filled with erotic BDSM and it never materialized.  I never got the realization of Christian using the Red Room of Pain to its full potential.  I've lived in San Francisco and know a little bit about the Alt lifestyle and James didn't come close to painting the picture of what many of us wanted.  I felt used when I finished almost 1500 pages without a hint of the potential she could have added.  A few mentions of butt plugs and light flogging didn't do it for me.  So in a nutshell, how disappointing.  I completed all these books and never got the ending that I kept waiting for.<br /><br />So it ends, married with kids and happy ever after; how trite!!<br />Happily ever after, at least it is done; no encore please
B003O86FMW|5.0|After reading book #1, I could not wait to read #2 & #3! The story line just keeps you riveted . I often stayed up to the wee hours because I just could not put it down. The only negative thing I can think of is that when you buy an ebook, you really don't own anything. I can't give it to a friend or grandchild to read. Basically you just pay money to store on your kindle or IPad. That's a bummer.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it was very good but the games kinda get boring after a while...<br />it needs more easy to follow instructions
B007IXWL2C|5.0|As with the first two books of the trilogy, this book is wonderfully written, and so romantic. Loved the series, and looking forward to the next trilogy, written from Christian's viewpoint. As these books have been on the best seller's list for months, recommending this book is a moot point. Just read it, ladies and men! It can  only help your relationship(s).

B0074MZSWW|2.0|I bought this album because I love the track \\"Hold on.\\"  Unfortunately, that is the best song and most of the other ones sound exactly the same.  It sounds a lot like Janis Joplin when she was playing with Big Brother and the Holding Company.  Which is great, if you are into that kind of thing.  I treat this like Mumford and Sons- pull it out for one listen, once a year, enjoy it and then forget about it.

B0073XV2W2|5.0|As fate would have it, I recently picked up the hobby of RC Helicopters, and their close cousins the multirotors of this book. As far as that goes, all too real. The lift capacity is already there. The rest I will let others comment on.<br /><br />The writing is good for the genre. Characters are there before your eyes. You will see them through the text! The action gets a little too much some times, but I can see why the plot demands action on the time scale of this story.<br /><br />All and all a good read.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|When I rooted my B&N Nook Color one of the first apps I downloaded was this one. I absolutely love getting books from Amazon!<br /><br />But all is not perfect with this app. Twice I have turned on my Nook only to find out that the reading app has decided to put all my books over into my Archive area. All my books! Each & every one of them! So frustrating! I've contacted support about this twice for no answers. My sister's has done the same thing several times as well.<br /><br />Also I understand that Kindle users have the option of categorizing or organizing their books - wish we with the app could do that too. To mark them as read, unread or make a note regarding the book. Also to be able to leave a review for a book directly from the app as opposed to logging into Amazon to do so.<br /><br />We have no way to remove the books from our device once they are downloaded. They just continue to clutter up the device unless you choose to delete them entirely from your Amazon library. Some books that's ok for but then some books you might want to keep & loan out but not have them remain on your device.<br /><br />I noticed we have not had an update on the app since 2011...please give us categories, a way to mark them, option to remove books from device & leave in our library, a way to leave a review on a book without opening a browser & getting to Amazon and fix the bug that causes the app to move our books to Archive without our permission!
B005LAII58|4.0|If you're looking for an exciting actions movie, look elsewhere. If you are a fan of comic book movies and have fond memories of 80's action flicks, you will be entertained.<br /><br />I'm glad Norris got his camera time, but I wouldn't be disappointed if he was not in the next one. It would have been nice for Li's character to have more time as his fight scenes are always entertaining. Statham and Van-Damm showed off their skills. Stallone, Willis, and Schwarzenegger were entertaining yet showing their age. I think Couture is doing pretty good crossing over from fighting to acting.<br /><br />Some of the blood effects were a little over the top for my taste, but other than that I really liked the movie.
0061537969|5.0|Full disclosure: I'm a really fast reader. People comment on it all the time. I've been raised on the doorstoppers of epic fantasy, too, so a book of this length (321 pages in paperback) is pretty easy-going for me.<br /><br />I could say I read this in one sitting, but the truth is I devoured it.<br /><br />Garth Stein's novel about a dog and his owner and their adventures together is one of the best-written, most emotionally affecting things I have read in a good long time. The sweet moments make you smile. The bitter moments make you cry. Bad things happen to the wrong people. It has characters you love to hate, even as you realize what they're doing makes perfect sense. And, at the heart of it all, what, to me, gives the book so much of its heart and most of its charm, is Enzo. Enzo the dog, who once saw a documentary about dogs being reincarnated as men when they are ready and realized he, too, is ready. Enzo is an incredible creation, the sort of character that completely leaps out at you from the page and never lets go once he grabs you. It takes a lot of skill to make a character like that, and as a writer myself, I have to tip my hat to Mr. Stein.<br /><br />Yes, some of the events might tip into melodrama at times, but these are neatly dealt with, so much so that I was completely engrossed in the events as they were happening, rarely, if ever, pausing to consider that this is just a story. Make no mistake. This is a novel about loss and dealing with hard times.  It says so all in the title, the first of many racing metaphors and allusions running throughout the book (these are also handled very well, so that even someone utterly unacquainted with the subject, like me, can easily understand what's going on). The ending is bittersweet, but in a satisfying, this-is-how-it's-supposed-to-be kind of way. It's very much in the spirit of the book.<br /><br />For dog-lovers, this is something you'll love (I know I did). For those who are a little more lukewarm, thewriting and the gripping story will help you past that. And, for everybody else... Well, we all need to race in the rain sometime.
0439023513|5.0|I was really afraid to read Mockingjay because so many fans seemed genuinely disappointed by the way things turned out. I can't lie. I was very heartbroken, confused and angry that the situation between Peeta and Katniss turned so dark. And then Peeta literally having his mind pulled through a meat grinder! As a female fan I enjoy the romance just as much as everybody else, but I am kind of happy that Collins took it somewhere else. She gave Mockingjay something other adult novels don't have. She took away the whole \\"wrap it all up with a tiny pink ribbon happy ever after\\" and just left it open for the reader. How can it not take years for the pain to start to subside even a little? Look what our soldiers go through? It takes many of them long years of treatments to handle their post-tramatic stress disorders.<br /><br />I think that Ms. Collins kept right on point with Katniss's sometimes very hard ass attitude. She's always had one goal and that was to take care of her family. And she didn't have a whole lot of love or affection for anybody except for her sister Prim. And Prim had that same sweet natured spirit as Peeta! I think that is why she was so drawn to him.<br /><br />It was just really focused on the war. It's really dark, gory, full of violence and destruction but sadly also very realistic and it preaches a message of what POWER can do. It can destroy. But LOVE will eventually conquer all. If Peeta hadn't been in her life she would be DEAD. She would have lost all hope for sure. Peeta is a symbol of love and hope and he kept her spirit alive even at her darkest hour.<br /><br />Yes it was difficult for me to not completely throw the book against the wall and curse the SKY! It's hard when you come to love and appreciate these characters without some real closure, but we the fans can just decide that on our own because Collins left it open for us to.

0786838655|3.0|Percy Jackson has ADHD, dyslexia and a knack for finding trouble. He sees things no one else sees--like ladies who turn into bats and pens that turn into swords. And then he finds out he might be the son of a Greek god and monsters of the Underworld are after him--well at least that explains a math teacher that turned into a bat.<br /><br />The Lightning Thief is an interested story (though I preferred The Red Pyramid). I liked that Percy prefers to do his own thing--which sometimes gets him in trouble but also helps him survive. Christians may be bothered by prayers to the gods and burnt offerings.<br /><br />I would recommend this to older middle grade readers or the young adult crowd.
B005MRUCAY|4.0|I have always enjoyed all the variations and interpretations of the Camelot legends over the years.This version was quite entertaining.I am not a history scholar so I do not view films from that perspective.I just enjoy the film for it's ability to keep me watching it.This version kept me coming back for more.Since it was on the Starz network you get to \\"see\\" more of Arthur-Morgan-Merlin-Guen then others have shown in the past.<br />With that being said...Thank you I enjoyed it.<br />As always Amazon did a great job with delivery. All the disc's functioned fine. Good job to all.
B008FOB124|5.0|Dead Can Dance can still transport us on an aural journey of introspection through the powerful and mature vocals of Brendan Perry and Lisa Gerrard.  Anastasis feels like the artists have gotten back on a bicycle they have not ridden in sixteen years - but magically they have not forgotten how to pedal, steer and balance.  Brendan's vocals are still haunting, raspy and deeper while Lisa continues to soar us to amazing new heavens that only she can create.  Anastasis is an evolutionary album, taking deep roots from Spirit Chaser but hearkens back to their neo-medieval beginnings and brings with it a more powerful and experienced percussion that blends complex sounds into deeply moving rhythm.  Every track on this album is amazing save one - Amnesia which seems out of place.  In addition the sound mix of Brendan's vocals seems a bit muted compared to previous recordings but overall it is a tight and well flowing piece of art.  As always, the lyrics capture the essence of solitary self-reflection as if they are preparing us for that moment when we come to know that we will cease to exist - and they are there to enfold us peacefully.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is great fun but the catch is u only need 1finger 2 play! well you could try 2 play with a stump hand but u wont get very far.@

Thank you again Amazon

B000065TQR|5.0|As most of those who saw them in the early seventies playing live can testify-this was never music for the faint hearted. Being 15, I took every opportunity to catch them around London and Hertfordshire-even seeing a Pinkwind jam in London that was mind blowing without illicit substances. Their gigs were fun, anarchy and even edgy-like where else would Hells Angels and hippies writhe shoulder to shoulder. But it was Paul Rudolph's spitting, snarling, thundering-slightly ripped guitar and the double drummers thundering along sans clothing that typified the rock n roll that other reviewers noted gave a template for later heavy metal and punk. Could be compared to MC5 but more like the Stooges with more fun and hippy piss take. So, we (the fans) waited for the release of this album. I had decamped to NZ with a small collection of prog rock and hoped for a friend to send a copy of this pigeon post (big pigeons in Aotearoa). I was lucky to get the fold out cover and pink vinyl. Still have the cover but the vinyl with much of that era went in a burg. Other reviewers are on the button. It was disappointing when compared to the live act. But, it grows on you. Can't get the debate re vinyl/CD and remastering argument. Yeah, the bonus tracks don't add much other than provide a glimpse but heck Do it, Heavenly man, Say you love me, War girl, Never never land all make this a worthwhile collection but also give it its four star rating. Add this to Twink's Think Pink-pick up some of the compilations with live material and you can put together a good mix of Pink Fairies music. And from the heart, thank you John Peel for show-casing live their version of \\"Tomorrow never knows\\" in 1970. They played it as that almost unknown mob the Beatles should have, cranked up, Mr Rudolph as if he was just learning guitar licks 101 and the whole falling apart at the edges and so in keeping with their/those times. Fantastic anarchy Fairies style.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|I downloaded Ice Age for myself.  I go to collage and am 66 years old.  I just needed to have something to relax.  I have had fun with it until I bought all that I could buy with money I earned playing the game.  I had trouble with the game getting frozen and other things.  Most of the problems are listed on their site.  But, I thought I could take it out and reinstall it.  Was that a mistake.  I lost my position of 34 and I had to start over and I already had about $30.00 in the game.  Not so free after all. I find it additive and frustrating.  They have to many thing that you have to buy with Acorns and then don't make them readily available except for outrageous prices.When you look at the credits you see why they have to rip people off.  Look how many people it takes to make this game.  I thought because it was a Kindle Fire Edition it would be a good game to play.  NOT

B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I've been a fan of the comic since issue one and just finished issue 100 ( bought all 9 covers! I'm such a geek ) and I was concerned that the show would not live up to my expectations. The show surpassed my high expectations and even surprised an avid reader of the comic. I was impressed by the lifelike zombie mask included in Season One special edition,but, this special edition once again surpassed my expectations.<br />I was happy to see McFarlane was doing the bust, but it must be seen to be believed! It scared my 7 yr old so much that my wife is making me keep the head in my office. Is it worth the extra $? Yes, and the box inside the head has different cover art than the mass produced version. If you are a huge fan you need to have this version... Hurry, they are LIMITED!
B00005MCWZ|5.0|Now I have to confess to having a soft spot for early Hawkwind. The first time I saw them was in a youth club in Hatfield (UK) circa 1970. They turned strobes on the audience, Terry Ollis drummed naked. Nik Turner was seriously weird in the best way and Dave Brock earthed the whole thing and played mean guitar. Imagine our collective surprise when it was chucking out time that they had played for four hours it was well past midnight and the boy scouts running the club were seriously pissed by the beastliness of this band. oh, not to mention Mr Ollis and the condoms thrown into the audience and a whole lot of anarchist/subversive mags. In short it was a bloody good night and the aged fifteen Hertfordshire (UK) male collective we would attend other such occasions again and did, many! And none did disappoint. So this on vinyl. like the Fairies. It could not capture the vastness of the aural/sonic whiplash that was released from stage-maybe it should have come with free mini strobes and a condom. In New Zealand I played this in a music class for my 6 weeks I attended Takapuna Grammar-it met with disinterest only getting traction when I moved into a flat-barely 16 with a group of dope smoking architecture students. It is a classic but maybe not as good as the follow up \\"In search of space\\" a seriously brain altering bit of mayhem-particularly in certain conditions-through cans and enough stereo effect to get shifting sounds. But Hawkwind is a cross roads into something other than the mainstream prog rock of its day.

B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Yes it's true, the best drama on TV these days features zombies. The second season of THE WALKING DEAD arrives this week on DVD and this is one series that not only keeps getting better but stays original and draws viewers in at a steady even pace.<br /><br />If you missed the first season the apocalypse has come upon the Earth not in the form of war but in a virus that has brought the dead back to life with an unquenchable thirst for blood. As they attack the living each new victim becomes another member of the walking dead, hungry as those who turned them.<br /><br />Into this world we saw Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) wake from a coma (he was a sheriff wounded in the line of duty) to an empty hospital. He struggled but found his way home to discover his wife and son were there no more and he set off in search of them, eventually reuniting with them and unaware that thinking he was dead his wife Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) had taken up with his best friend Shane (Jon Bernthall). With a ragtag group of allies they headed to the CDC only do discover one last survivor there who then blew up the facility at the close of that season.<br /><br />Season two begins with the group on the road once more heading towards Ft. Benning. When they get stuck in a traffic jam on the highway and their RV breaks down, they look for replacement parts only to have a herd of zombies head their way. For the most part they do well but two leftover zombies spot young Sophia and she heads into the woods. Rick follows, finds her and directs her back to the group while he distracts the zombies and then kills them. When he returns Sophia is no where to be found and the group spends their time searching for her. At the end of the first episode while they search, Rick's son Carl is shot by a stray hunter's bullet.<br /><br />Episode two gets us to the place where the hunter lives, a farm with its own group of survivors led by the farm's owner Hershel (Scott Wilson). A veterinarian, he saves Carl and the rest of the group is brought to the farm as well. The search for Sophia continues and for the better half of the first season this is the focal point. It's what happens to the group during this search and after that brings forth the drama in the series.<br /><br />The group changes as the show progresses. Secrets between various members are brought to light. Control of the group becomes a catalyst that drives wedges between these people. And slowly we begin to see Shane lose his mind. It's a slow burn that we watch progress from episode to episode that culminates with one of the most stunning solutions every shot in a series. This, along with the search and discovery of Sophia, makes for some stirring moments.<br /><br />That may be the plotline that the story follows this season but it's the interaction between characters that make this series tick. Forget the fact that zombies are all around, the interplay between these survivors is what brings the story to life. The zombies take far less screen time then one would expect with a title like this. A true gathering doesn't even occur until the last two episodes.<br /><br />Instead we have the drama played out by the love triangle involved with Rick, Lori and Shane. We have the development and maturing of young Carl in a world where there is no room for childhood. There is the fatherly affection between the older Dale and the emotionally scarred Andrea who begins to change as well. And in the midst of it all is Hershel and his family, thinking that there is still hope for a world to return to the way it was, secluded from the horror that has spun out of control in the world.<br /><br />There are dramas on TV right now that have nothing on this series. As I said, if you took away the zombies the drama would still be the centerpiece and hold your attention. I considered if it would work in another format, say alien invasion or perhaps a world war on U.S. soil ala RED DAWN. In each format I choose the stories holdup. Zombies just add a touch of uneasiness to the mix.<br /><br />The acting on view here is tremendous. There are no stand outs as every person involved brings their A game to the screen. From children to wizened aging actors, each does a fantastic job of bringing their character to life. There isn't a sympathetic character on view here, from the supposed bad guys to the amazingly good guys. And there are two things to know about every character here. One, they can change in the flick of an eye from good to bad and two, not everyone is going to make it. During one of the special extras sequences the statement is made that everyone comes to work wondering if their character will remain or not.<br /><br />Words can not describe how amazing this series is. There were moments during season two where my jaw literally dropped and I had to pause the disc to absorb what just transpired. This is not just a DVD that you will want to rent; it is one worth having on the shelf.  The only bad thing is having to wait until October for season three to begin.up.

B008D28HYS|4.0|I love casual puzzles and I'm definitely a visual person. I suck at crosswords, but I rock at puzzles like sudoku. This feels a little bit like that, and it's really satisfying once I finish each puzzle. I especially love pixel art, so +1 for that. I appreciate how simple the gameplay and mechanics are but it's still really fun. This would be something I'd play on the bus on my way to work or at the airport.
B00000K3D4|1.0|Back around 1989 I probably watched this movie 10000000000 times.  In my mind it was the greatest movie ever and had fond memories.  Flash forward to this year - I got it for my kids to watch and it did not hold up.  My kids found it boring and quite frankly, the movie really wasn't very good.  I get the whole nostalgia vibe but the movie made very little sense, the acting was bad, the music was terrible and the effects were laughable.  I wish I had not seen it as an adult because it ruined the movie for me.
0143119680|4.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />The book starts when Diana Bishop discovers a bewitched manuscript,called Ashmole 782, in a library at Oxford. It has been lost for centuries and soon all kind of witches, daemons and vampires are trying to get it. One of them is Matthew Clairmont, a scientist who is also vampire.<br /><br />Diana is from a powerful family of witches but after her parents' death she has refused to use her powers. But when things starts to take dangerous turn she learns that she can't ignore her heritage anymore.<br /><br />Book is told from Diane's point of view and it worked here. She's strong, brave, intelligent and she's historian. What's not to like? It was interesting to see how she grew during the book, fing herself again and learning to control her powers.<br /><br />Matthew is over 1000 year old vampire who takes interest in Diana. At first he is just looking for Ashmole 782 but soon finds that he can't keep her out of his thoughts. But vampires and witches aren't supposed to be together as they are about to find out. I liked Matthew and the chemistry between him and Diane. Sure he had this medieval thing about protecting women and stuff but I thought he was still quite adorable.<br /><br />There was quite a lot talking about DNA and alchemy and I have to say that it went way over my head. But it was still interesting and it didn't made m enjoy it any less.<br /><br />And there was a finnish witch called Satu J&auml;rvinen :) That doesn't happen often and just made me happy. Of course she was one of the bad guys but you can't have it all, can you? She kinda leaves a lasting impression on Diane, not to mention traumas.<br /><br />I really liked this book! I liked the first half book better with Matthew and Diane getting to know eachother. In later part things started to move much faster and while it was fun it didn't feel the same.<br /><br />A word of warning: the books has much detailed telling about things. How wine or food tasted and or smelled and their reactions to it. So if you're not into that kind of thing you should be warned.reactions to it. So if you're not into that kind of thing you should be warned.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I just wanted to say, from all of the negative reviews this/these<br /> book(s) received I was expecting some demented off the hook kind of sexual encounters.  My friend actually got me to read them and I'm GLAD!!!!  These books are far more about a loving relationship than any thing else.  I LOVED reading them and think I might even incorporate some of what I read into my relationship in order to keep it ALIVE and exciting.  A MUST read!!!

B00488SU02|2.0|So many reviews already. Let's keep this short. Has anyone mentioned the absurdity of making a  !Texas! !Death!  !Penalty!  !Movie! WHILE COMPLETELY LEAVING OUT RACE?!? Yikes. Yes, the red herrings are annoying, but this is even worse for being Mississippi Burning all over again.<br /><br />Why do writers and directors think that they can preach the hard-line about a serious topic....while making a 2nd rate thriller of the month? For that matter, why do otherwise smart actors think that they can act their way out of a hot-house mess of a script? Spacey, Winslet and Linney are always fun to watch, but what a waste of talent.

0375507256|5.0|One of the better books I've picked up in a while. Blown away by the story, its relevance to human's current situation, as well as the author's amazing ability to construct beautifully written passage after beautifully written passage in different dialect after different dialect. Cloud Atlas is challenging, but the pay-off is indeed worth the extra work.  I've never read anything quite like it. Wish I could give it more than 5 stars. Will remember this read for a long time, and it is begging me for a second reading at some point.
B00884GR0W|5.0|this game is awesome and great if u like minecraft but not quite like that its just more realistic that's all.and ive only played the lite version.

1451627297|5.0|This is definitely a different book for Stephen King but I really enjoyed it.  The ending has a bit of his usual macabre.  I have loved all his books and this is no exception.  The real payoff is if you relate to the 50's and 60's you will love this book; especially if you remember the very sad assassination of President Kennedy.  I highly recommend this book.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have read SO many books in my time, but nothing is quite like Fifty Shades of Grey... It is truly a HOT MESS in regards to literature, and it makes me question peoples intelligence who love this book, and say how well written it is... It's NOT well written.. It's TERRIBLE.  The plot is subpar at best, and the main character, Anastasia, is weak, pathetic and quite annoying.  I did like Christian (which female doesn't?), but the s!x scenes were boring and repetitive.  I don't know, maybe I've read too many good erotic books with great main characters, and awesome plots to enjoy something so pathetic(Check out Black Dagger Brotherhood by J.R. Ward if you want to read some awesome adult books with a REAL plot and awesome characters) .<br /><br />With that said (I am sure I've insulted A LOT of women), here are my reasons for despising Fifty Shades:<br /><br />Did you know that the word MURMUR was used 199 times in the first book, 278 times in the second book, and 293 times in the third book... Doesn't seem like E.L. has an extensive vocabulary when describing how someone speaks.<br /><br />The erotic scenes are basically repeated several times in each book.  The bath, the shower, the red room of dread, the boat, outside, and in a car.  OVER and OVER and OVER and OVER again.<br /><br />The characters, especially Anastasia, were BORING!  There was basically no character development in any of the stories. So what, they married? So what, we find out a little about Christian's past? So what, Anastasia finds out she DOES like getting spankings?  COME ON!  There is only so much you erotic CRAP one can take while reading a trilogy.  If E.L. delved more into the background of Christian, I'd personally have found the stories much more interesting, but considering E.L. is a terrible writer with a lack of vision, it was a snooze fest.<br />I didn't even finish the 3rd book.<br /><br />I could go on and on about why I hate these novels, but I am sure no one really cares, so I will leave you with this.<br /><br />If you want a book that touches on some of the dark sides of sex, read it, but know that the books are poorly written, the plot SUCKS, and the characters are boring.<br />If you want a GOOD book with great characters, great plot, and awesome sex, read Dark Lover (book 1 of the Black Dagger Brotherhood) by JR Ward.leave you with this.<br /><br />If you want a book that touches on some of the dark sides of sex, read it, but know that the books are poorly written, the plot SUCKS, and the characters are boring.<br />If you want a GOOD book with great characters, great plot, and awesome sex, read Dark Lover (book 1 of the Black Dagger Brotherhood) by JR Ward.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is alot of fun to play for my children and I. I will recommend this to my friends and family.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|i got this for my six year old a few weeks ago. Enable parental controls so your child can't purchase content. The game can be played very successfully without the purchased content. My only gripe is that it requires social media access to attain some of the goals. (it says invite friends,  and will provide other villages, but some of the activities done there don't apply towards goals. since my daughter doesnt have a social media account, we can't complete those particular goals. When going to the 'system chosen' other villages, the kindle will lock up on occasion. And you CAN exit the game by clicking the options button then the door. That was not an intuitive place to find that.<br />Why a game targeted to younger folks would require access to social media (which is forbidden by law to be provided to anyone under 13 'COPPA'), I don't know. As I said, although this doesn't require this to play the game, it makes the progress of the game slow way down at level 20 or so...

Every time I make a mistake, I can trace it back to one of these agreements  1. speak impeccably with your words (to others and ourselves)  2. don't take anything personally (anything!!!)  3. do not anticipate  (it sets us up for disappointment)  4. always do your best!!!!

B0001O3YD0|5.0|Don't you hate it when you're suddenly awakened from cryo-sleep to find your spaceship crippled and hurtling toward a crash landing on some planet you've never seen before?  For most of the 40 souls onboard the Hunter-Gratzner, fate alone controls their fate - well, fate and the quick decision-making of a pilot who suddenly finds herself the new captain.  As it turns out, though, surviving the crash is actually the easy part of the survivors' experience.  The seemingly lifeless planet is much more dangerous than it appears.<br /><br />Twelve people survive the crash landing - and it's a pretty motley crew.  Among them are the pilot and new de facto captain Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), a Muslim imam, a few young people, the rich and annoyingly snooty Paris P. Ogilvie, the \\"cop\\" William J. Johns (Cole Houser), and - last but certainly not least - Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel), an escaped killer that Johns has nabbed.  Even though everyone is afraid of Riddick, for good reason, the gang ends up turning to him for help when they discover they aren't alone on the planet.  The place is teeming with hostile alien creatures with a taste for human flesh, although the creatures only come out at night.  Lucky for the survivors, the planet turns out to have no less than three suns in the sky, which means it never gets dark there.  Unless there's a major solar eclipse, of course - but that only happens once every twenty two years.  And what are the odds that these guys would crash land there within hours of just such an eclipse?<br /><br />Not only is Riddick a born killer with no fear whatsoever, he also has eyes that were artificially adapted for a special kind of night vision - just what the doctor ordered if you're trying to evade deadly creatures of the night.  Of course, the guy is unpredictable and untrustworthy, just the kind of guy who might help them until such time as he can betray them and leave them stranded on the planet.  Vin Diesel pretty much makes the whole movie as this anti-hero.  You never know which way Riddick might turn, but you can't help rooting for him because he's just such a badass.<br /><br />The plot of Pitch Black is pretty straightforward; this is a science fiction survival story.  The movie features some great, surprisingly complex characters, which - alongside Diesel's performance - makes it a cut above most others in this genre.  The special effects are well done, further adding to the intensity of the whole experience.  This movie just has a unique feel to it, and - since things did not play out exactly as I expected - it's not overly predictable or derivative of other films.  It's just a fun, surprisingly captivating walk on the darker side of science fiction.movie as this anti-hero.

031620157X|5.0|I originally pre-ordered this book because first, it was written by Chris Colfer and second, I love fairytales. However, this book was so much more than a book written by a celebirty and a fairytale. I could've easily read this book in one day, if I had not been working so much. This is a quick fun read, even with the length being somewhat long. It is a little predictable but I still love it and would recomend it to anyone!<br /><br />Very-well written and constructed!<br /><br />I can not wait for the sequal and for his next book(which is available for pre-order)!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0316232955 Struck By Lightning: The Carson Phillips Journal]]
B001FB4W0W|4.0|Just to start off: I will admit-- I am a huge True Blood fan. I have been since I stumbled across the show at the beginning on Season 2. The show= amazing. But this is for the product so I will stick to the actual product.<br /><br />The case is very strong and durable and good quality. The DVD's contain not only commentary, but also scene selections, both before and coming next scenes, and some background content. They are very high quality for DVD's and look fantastic.<br /><br />Now for the cons: Even with the extra content, a standard DVD would be able to hold more than 2 episodes per disc. It is tiresome after only two episodes to have to get up and change the discs. Laziness? Perhaps... but I feel it's a waste to have so many discs. However, I do have the Season 2 Set as well and it is smaller so I feel that they figured that as well. Also, one small con- there is a paper piece that comes on the back and just hangs out in the packaging. So when you open up the packaging- it just falls out and you wondering, \\"Where do I put this?\\" It doesn't slip back into the case sleeve.<br /><br />Other than that, this is an amazing set. Something like this will last for a long time. And is way worth it!
B0088X7YMS|5.0|This is a fantastic adaptation of Starship Troopers. This film combines elements of the original Novel, the Movie (the first one), and the CGI series and forms them into it's own story. The action is very well done, the cgi is very good, the voice acting is well enough with descent lip syncing (being made in Japan I was worried about this and was surprised that it mostly works out), the characters have enough depth to move the story along, and there are plenty of nods to the other works with the Starship Troopers name.<br /><br />This is a must have for any fan of the other works based on Robert Heinlein's novel. For those who are fans of sci-fi action and mecha, they should also give it a watch; even if they don't love it, they will still not regret watching it.
B007VYDFMS|4.0|Given the length of the film, it seems oddly hollow at times.  I was left still having no idea what the core of Bob Marley was like.  His political views (other than cynical) were obscured, his personal relationships were confusing.  What mattered to him?  The only truly clear point I emerged with was that Bob Marley wanted his musical career to succeed, he wanted to conquer markets worldwide and was upset that his music was not embraced by African Americans.  And that he was \\"tough\\", and felt alienated for a variety of reasons.  He loved children, it was said, but seemed to have little time to spend with at least some of them. That's hardly unusual for driven men, but given Marley's apparent rejection of \\"western\\" family structure, it's kind of troubling.  Surely his children were hurt by his behavior, and he seemed to spread himself awfully thin in terms of personal commitments.  Furthermore, there are many questions about some of the most important events in his life.  A few are alluded to by Ziggy Marley.<br /><br />Who was really behind the assassination attempt?  What happened to those who did the shooting?  And who on earth was giving Marley medical advice?  He appeared to have no appropriate treatment for the melanoma that was diagnosed on his foot, guaranteeing that it would reappear in metastases and be ultimately fatal.  And when he had a seizure from the cancer spreading to his brain, someone advised him to just continue performing??  Clearly someone was terrified of losing potential income and momentum but who?  Was it Marley himself?  Chris Blackwell?  Those in his entourage?  Why did the Wailers really break up?  Was it the reluctance of two of the members (Tosh and Bunny Livingston) to tour, or was it Chris Blackwell's preference for dealing with Marley solo, given his more marketable (e.g. whiter) image?<br /><br />\\"Marley\\" was a visually gorgeous movie, and it was interesting to hear the story of the musical history of Jamaican reggae.  The interviews with his children, his old teacher, Bunny Wailer, and a few of the Hope Road regulars were interesting.  I found it sad that there was so  little from Rita Marley, who must have a lot more to say.  I found the movie visually lovely and thought provoking but ultimately unsatisfying because the obviously elusive central focus remained, to me anyway, still unfathomable.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|Fast shipping and great service. Product works perfectly and haven't experienced any problems thus far.<br />Kinect Zoom attaches to the kinect just fine. Product wasn't broken or damaged. So far, I'm having fun playing my games in my small living room. Coudn't be happier! :)

B000SEIDR0|5.0|My interest in food has peaked over this last year and the Omnivores Dilemma was the perfect book. Well written and very well researched it provided insights into our food systems I only had notions of before. It's unbiased nature made it even more credible. The villains of modern agriculture became business men with some outdated assumptions and principles. And the concept of USDA organic became somewhat less \\"organic\\". And the original meaning of organic became clear. I would recommend it to anyone.
B004T32SOK|5.0|This app is perfect. I have it on my Kindle fire and it's so easy to access the files I need with no problem.
B003DCJA94|3.0|Fun, quirky movie from a definitely more fun era. It's not going to make any all time greatest lists for anything but a young Jeff Beck beating the crap out of his guitar amp was entertaining. The mime troupe got way too much screen time and the storyline is pretty thin but it was a fun, period piece just the same.
B008AVYOBC|5.0|First off, the DVD is not PAL, it is NTSC. How Amazon got this wrong is beyond me. Buy this set for the DVD. If you are a Bananarama fan like I am, you already have all their music on cd, so the cd is no big deal. The DVD, however is a gem. The videos look and sound fantastic, especially considering many of the videos are 30 years old. I've never even seen most of these videos, so it was a real treat to finally own them all on DVD.
0439023513|5.0|Mockingjay is the third and final book in the [[ASIN:0545265355 The Hunger Games Trilogy Boxed Set]], and WOW! What a conclusion. The first book I read with enjoyment, the second eagerly, but this last book I literally could not put down. I had to leave work early and spent the rest of the day finishing it, after starting it the night before.<br /><br />The Hunger Games storyline and writing are incredible. It's hard for me to believe it's young adult fiction, but then, so is Harry Potter and it's hardly a walk through the garden.<br /><br />Like the earlier books, Mockingjay follows Katniss Everdeen, an earnest but unpleasant teen girl struggling against a totalitarian government in a dystopian world. The book picks up where the last one left off. I don't want to give away any significant plot points, so I'll stick to basics.<br /><br />+ Many of the earlier characters reappear in Mockingjay. They remain true to themselves, and their behavior while not always ideal is very believable, and only adds to the story. Kudos to Suzanne Collins for not giving into sequel-itis!<br />+ Katniss and the rest of the characters are clearly veterans by now, and their scars and weariness are showing. You may wish you were like her sometimes, but you would never, ever want to BE her. Not with her life.<br />+ The storytelling is smooth yet gripping. The story kept me guessing the whole way through, while still seeming logical and believable at its conclusion. Perfect! Even for the last few pages I wasn't sure what would happen. I was very satisfied at the end.<br /><br />A great conclusion to a great series. I foresee a few more readings of the Hunger Games in my future!

B007MDQW3W|2.0|There is a lot of buzz at the moment (Mid 2012) about a singer called 'Regina Spektor' and this is her latest album 'What we saw from the cheap seats'.<br /><br />I believe, from what I have read, that back in 2008 or thereabouts she won an award for best female singer. However, listening to this album, I can't see what the fuss is about. Regina is hardly a great singer, her songs are generally average and her piano playing is very good.<br /><br />This is generally very simple music, with vocals and piano, and some songs have a bit more built up arrangements. Spektor's vocals are sometimes too soft, sometimes too fast, and, occasionally, good, but rarely impressive. Very few of the songs are notable. The third one, 'Don't Leave Me' is a nice reggae song, the last song, 'Jessica', is a nice ditty and the best song, the one where you feel more effort and passion was put into it, is 'Ballad of a politician' a song about the dirty deals. Some of the lyrics are really silly, especially 'All the rowboats', not that that's a bad thing.<br /><br />The again, this album starts off really badly; Regina sings 'Small town moon' really fast and it's hard to understand the words, and things take a turn for the worse on 'Oh Marcello', which keeps interchanging between a cover of the Animals 'Don't let me be misunderstood' and some rapping - a terrible song!<br /><br />All in all, there's very hardly any memorable songs, although there  are good moments, especially when she gets emotional at the piano. This isn't bad music, just unmemorable, treads already well worn ground, and when it does try to be original the results aren't very good. 2 / 5
B007VDN1PA|5.0|First I would like to confirm that this is the exact same unit as the ION OMNI SCAN Stand-Alone Image and Slide Scanner http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0046TBJEM.<br /><br />- I use it only for 35mm films - Color and B/W.<br />- I set it at 10 Megapixel per picture (there are 2 options: 5 Mpx and 10 Mpx) and I do recommend it to be set this way.  Otherwise the pictures will look smaller on modern monitors or HDTVs.  The size of the file will still be small, comparing to any modern digital camera.<br /><br />PROs:<br /><br />1. It's very easy for use and should be intuitive even for seniors (with some initial help from their kids :)  I wouldn't recommend to use any enhancements to the scans on the device itself - it's better to use any free simple editor, like Picasa afterwards for contrast/color improvements.<br /><br />2. It's FAST, because, actually, this is not a scan - this is a small camera inside the device which makes pictures of films and slides.  To feel the speed - I was able to make about 750 pictures in just 2 evenings.<br /><br />3. It's a stand alone unit - you can scan to a SDHC card that are very cheap now.<br /><br />CONs:<br /><br />There is only one, but quite a significant flaw.  There is a piece called \\"Film holder\\" that is used to guide a film or a slide into the device.  It's made of clear plastic.  It gets scratches pretty fast (at least for films).  Those are micro scratches, that go in the film direction and they become visible on the pictures after approximately first 500 frames.  The manufacturer provides TWO (2) of those holders inside the box, which is nice, but not enough in my case.  So keep this in mind.<br /><br />NOTE FOR THE MANUFACTURER / DISTRIBUTOR:<br />If I would be able to buy those Film Holders as parts - I would give it 5 stars!<br /><br />UPDATE 08/29/2012<br />I decided to upgrade my review to 5 stars after I contacted the DB-Tech Customer Service (dbtech@camarketingusa.com) about extra \\"Film Holders\\".  Sam replied almost immediately and resolved my issues.  Great Customer Service!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/12/2012<br />I just got an email from the seller.  They added \\"DB-Tech Replacement Film Holders for DB-FS150 Film Slide and Negative Scanner - 3x Strip Film and 1x Single Frame holder\\" - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00A6GROIO for $3.99.  I would REALLY recommend to buy a set of those together with the scanner. Kudos to the seller - they listened to their customers! :)

B007UXSPK2|4.0|Very good fast paced action thriller.  The Blu-ray photography was outstanding. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and I'm glad I purchased it.
0671449028|1.0|My daughter is 18 months old and she hates this book.  I know \\"hate\\" is a strong word, but she literally closes the book and throws it on the floor every time I open it.  We usually read when I sit her down on a potty and my daughter loves this routine.  Since I've bought the Going to Sleep book, which was maybe a month ago, she has never allowed me to finish reading it to her.<br /><br />She loves to read.  Some of our favorite books are Goodnight, Gorilla, Little Blue Truck, I am a Bunny... I think the reason why she dislikes the Going to Bed book is because it is drawn so unrealistically and with too many lines and details.  It is irritating to the eyes.  To top that, it is about going to bed which is not a favorite activity on a any toddler's list.  Sorry, but this book was just not for us.
B007MAETA8|1.0|I've been a John Mayer fan since I first heard \\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\" on the radio back 10 years or so.  I bought Room For Squares, then Heavier Things and Continuum.  All excellent with perhaps Continuum being my favorite.  Then came Battle Studies, not as good as the previous three but good nonetheless.  I like John's songs because the lyrics are usually either emotional, romantic or thought provoking.  For me, lyrics can make or break a song.<br />Then there is Born and Raised.  Oh, my.  Where are the great lyrics?  Do you know who you are anymore?  There is a bad country vibe here and some nonsense-lyric songs.  I gave it a chance and listened again and again but I can't take it anymore.  This is a CD that will never see the light of day again in my house.  But I still play Room For Squares and the others.  When an album is really good, it is timeless.  Born and Raised isn't one of them.<br />Even if you are a John Mayer fan, skip this one.
B007KZY1YY|3.0|This book was good in parts, but rambled a bit, presumably to pad it out somewhat. I do think though, that she's crossed the line, at last, and made it more possible for more female erotica romance writers to be able to, get in there,and write their stuff.

B007IXWL2C|4.0|Once I got past the shock value of the first book, the story line kept me reading. The second book was my least favorite for the redundant sex scenes (they actually got tiresome). All in all, I enjoyed the books. The trilogy was a fun summer read.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I confess that I did not get into watching Vampire Diaries on tv. I might have tried a time or two, but just couldn't get into it. Then Vampire Diaries showed up and NetFlix and I started watching and couldn't stop.<br /><br />The young actors on the show have done a wonderful job of bringing their various characters to life (or un-death, as the case may be). Nina Dobrev is fascinating to watch as she plays both the sweet Elena and the evil (or is she?), Katherine. But Ian Somerhalder plays my favorite character of Damon with great wit and energy and a touch of vulnerability that makes his delightfully bad character lovable, no matter how many people he kills.<br /><br />Vampire Diaries is now one of my favorite few tv shows that I must watch and own.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B002JVWR9U The Vampire Diaries: The Complete First Season]]
0375842209|5.0|If I were to describe this book in the manor of the book itself I would think that its color would be blue. Not just any blue mind you but the pure blue of the sky after a rainstorm. The blue that is so beautiful it makes you happy and sad at the same time. This book chronicles the life of a child in Nazi Germany during WWII. It is Schindler's List and the Diary of Ann Frank rolled into one. This story is narrated by the soul collector and this unusual view point gives this book a unique twist on reality that is both creepy and compelling at the same time. I laughed and cried until my sides hurt. I think that this book is wonderful and a must read. For anyone who likes drama, or historical fiction or an all around good book. It is going on my to read again list!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This is by far the best office suite available on the market. The one thing that does need improvement is the addition of a spell checker. Many have complained about the price of the font package but it is important to realize that the app plus the font package equals the regular price of its closest competitor, QuickOffice. This is still a better app than QuickOffice with more fonts.

B0081TZETY|4.0|First things first, I think this album is wonderful. Having listened to the Liars previous work, the general ambiance and sound from this album was rather unexpected (but, what else can you expect from Liars?). It starts out with \\"The Exact Colour of Doubt,\\" which is oddly beautiful, and comforting, kind of dropping one into a relaxed lull before dramatically shifting into \\"Octagon,\\" which is a song filled with so much tension that it makes me want to crawl out of my skin.<br /><br />From there it goes into \\"No. 1 Against the Rush\\", which is relaxed enough to put you, once again, into kind of lull, with a repetitious, rather relaxed rhythm; however, the overlapping synthesizers create a wonderfully discomforting ambiance, which is really what the album is rife with. From there it follows that same basic pattern: Relaxed beat, with overlaying instruments creating a constant feeling of discomfort and rising tension to the point where it makes your skin crawl.<br /><br />Only complaints; the title track, \\"Wixiw\\", which sits in the exact middle of the album is very loud, abrasive and out of place with the rest of the album. It has a kind of sonic shift half way through the song, which I would praise if the shift reflected the sound of the album either preceding or proceeding the song, but it doesn't. It's simply out of place. The songs preceding \\"Wixiw\\" are all calm with rising tension. The songs proceeding \\"Wixiw\\" start off more tense, but kind of ease off, becoming more fun to listen to. \\"Wixiw\\" is just nonstop intensity, without the proper feeling of climax.<br /><br />Also, I wix the track listing, \\"Who is the Hunter\\" and \\"Brats\\" were switched around. Most of the album is very, very electronic, but the ending track, \\"Annual Moon Words\\" is organic. \\"Who is the Hunter\\" (best song on the album, in my opinion) begins with a very synthetic sound, and ends with the organic sound of violins, while \\"Brats\\" is completely synthetic. It just would of been a better way to closethe album without making \\"Annual Moon Worlds\\" as badly out of place. That's my personal opinion, however; I'm no music producer, and I'm sure Liars had a reason for setting up the track listing the way they did. Either way, this album gets a very high recommendation from me, and Liars, more than most bands, do deserve your money. Plus, for a $5.00 mp3 download, value wise, this album is a steal. Love it.
B009329ZF2|5.0|I have seen a lot  of alien movies (ok, I have seen almost all), but this one has to be in the top 5. The intro, the plot, the climax, it's all there. I liked it so much I had to watch it twice. This is the type of stuff that Dr. Michio Kaku has been talking about for years. The aliens could have been more non-human like.

B008IGP8RI|4.0|Don't let that one star review mislead you, he's just slightly misinformed. While he is correct in Cave only singing on 2 tracks he wrote the handful of originals and both him and Ellis composed the arrangements for the traditionals and covers included on the disc. The band listed as The Bootleggers are actually Cave, Ellis and a few others from their own inner circle of musicians. I haven't seen the film yet but from what I've read there are quite a few tracks and arrangements missing, it does bother me knowing that I may not have everything they created for the film, I really can't complain about what was included on the disc. Both of the tracks that Mark Lanegan guests on are phenomenal. Ralph's take on Fire & Brimstone is haunting and Emmylou sounds great. I've had this on repeat all day and can see it making its way into regular rotation in the future.

This was DEFINITELY one of those times. I roared through this whole book. The story was sweet and the characters were perfect. I am jealous of Kinsella's ability to write stories that bring joy and humor to so many people. If only I had such a talent. I can only say thank you for keeping me entertained, and I definitely plan on reading more of your books as they arrive on the market. I recommend this book to all who wish a fun light read that will keep you giggling throughout with rommance added as an extra gift.
0783219695|4.0|Love this movie and was glad to find a reasonably-priced, newly-packaged DVD.  Got two - from two different sellers, but Amazon will not allow me to make two separate reviews because it's the same movie or something like that.  Anyway, I got one in widescreen of the Anniversary Edition for myself and then a 2nd one for a friend.  Since my friend does not care for widescreen, I did not want to get the same DVD for gift.  I read the description, and while it said \\"HD\\", it appeared that simply meant that it would work well with HD TV's. Turned out when we received it, that it has to be in an HD DVD player only so it seems my friend cannot use it with their older DVD player.  That is a bummer :(
B008GOAFBQ|3.0|I purchased the 180 gram Vinyl and was expecting a \\"wow\\" . This was a little disappointing. Now I'm not saying I wasted my money or anything but other than the remix and the original solo on sweet pain, there is nothing else. I thought there was a additional verse in Beth that was found, and I thought there was some other goodies. Nope. What I will tell you is the remix is good but not what I expected. On most of the tracks the vocals were put up front more with more echo and such which sounds ok. On god of thunder the kids were more up front and the general mix is ok. But I expected more. The original album to me always sounded a little \\"thin\\" and I thought the bass and drums were gonna be boosted. Maybe they weren't there to begin with. I will tell you that do you love me is different from all the other tracks. Like it was recorded in a different studio or with different equipment. It sounds awesome and thunderous like the whole album should but doesn't. This album is one of kiss's best and should have been done a little better. FInal thought. If you are a die hard kiss fan get the album and burn it on disk, it's not money wasted. But as far as a die hard fan. All I have to say is Come on Bob Ezrin, I think I could have done better. Seriously. Let me at the tapes.
B0063IH60K|3.0|it just ok. ads after every hand. not liking the no choice where it puts a card that has multiple options.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|What a joy this game is on my Kindle Fire.  Beautiful, simple controls, awesome replayability, and just FUN!!!  I honestly can't stop playing this game.  I just want to keep upgrading more and more.  It is the definition of addicting gameplay.  It does suck the battery life quickly though, so make sure you're juiced up before sitting down to play.  Awesome game.....good job devs.
1936608898|5.0|This book was my entree into the Paleo philosophy, science and lifestyle. I'm so glad it was. Over the years I've experimented with ways of eating from vegetarian to vegan to raw and have gravitated back to eating just about anything because ultimately I didn't feel great. It hasn't been a weight-loss journey necessarily...like anyone my weight fluctuates, but I'm active and pay attention to what I eat.<br /><br />When I picked up It Starts with Food, I couldn't put it down. Not only does it detail the science in friendly terms, but it speaks to what we're all really looking for: nourishment. It's true that if you follow a Paleo lifestyle you'll be in the kitchen more. Way more. But what an amazing thing to reconnect with the food you eat. By spending more time with my food I found myself appreciating it more - I daresay even admiring the wonder of it. In the book there's a section that talks about actually sitting down and eating with no distraction. I've heard this a million times before, but suddenly it all makes sense. Spend time with the food you're consuming: it becomes a part of you - the old \\"you are what you eat\\" has new meaning for me and can I just say WOW - my energy is unbelievable. I can't sit still. I never really feel hungry and am certainly never distracted by thoughts of what I'll eat next to satisfy my craving. I simply don't have cravings. I'm enjoying delicious, satiating meals. My plate is beautiful and whole. The shape of my body is different. My attitude is different - I feel in control, fierce and confident. My husband has lost 20 pounds with no effort, looks great and loves eating this way. My kids are coming along!<br /><br />Between this book and Wheat Belly we have an absolutely new outlook on the food we eat. (You for sure want to rethink that whole-grain thing, folks.) Every bite is nourishment to your body, your mind and your spirit. You owe it to yourself to read this book and understand the reality about how what you eat affects your life and your health and then try it and SEE FOR YOURSELF - even if it goes against what is the current, conventional wisdom - just try it. It's not a diet, it's a revolution and I guarantee you modern medicine will eventually come around. But please don't wait five years for them to catch up - do something now. \\"Let food be thy medicine.\\"
B008N1V11U|3.0|I wanted so badly to LOVE this game as I enjoy everything Batman related, but the difficult controls really made this purchase a huge letdown.  Kindle Fire is NOT meant for this type of game and I think the best way for this game to be experienced is on a home console with a real controller.  So, overall, nice looking game and horribly bad controls.
B006MW3VC4|5.0|you cannot  help but like  a great British show. watching it on  Kindle even made it easier to watch and enjoy. Just lay in bed propped that bugger which is the  k[ndle on your stomach and enjoy the show. All movies are wonderful also on the kindle. Watch the next season you'll enjoy it also.
0345528581|4.0|Phenomenal for the weight lifter looking to switch to body weight.<br />As a long-time weight lifter for both competitive sports and general fitness, the exercises in this book truly trump weight lifting in most areas. The workouts build stability and balance as well as strength, which is almost entirely overlooked in many workout programs. The variety of exercises available do a great job of keeping bordom at bay, and the variety in difficulty in exercise variants for many of the motions let a wide range of abilities participate.<br /><br />I can't comment on the written workout plans, I don't use them.<br /><br />Gym is the key word in the title, diet and general health info is limited, the book focuses almost entirely on the workouts.<br /><br />Each exercise has extensive instructions, so as long as you have some basic experience with physical activity you will be happy with this book. However, if you are completely new to the physical world, I would pick a more basic book with more of an emphasis on proper form.
B001AXU1CS|5.0|The movie was for my wife, she loves Grease. I'm, however, starting to come around. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Good price too.
0307279189|5.0|Born To Run is by far my favorite book I have ever read. I read this as a summer reading book this summer and plan to read it many times in the future! There were 3 qualities that really made this book stand out from every other:<br /><br />1: Christopher McDougall's writing is flawless throughout. The narrative is so rich with detail that in every moment I felt enveloped in the action as if I were running beside Ann Trason or Arnulfo Quimare during the ultraraces. He writes with such elegance and nuance; the narrative flow is paralleled with the weightlessness of Caballo Blanco's stride among the Copper Canyons.<br /><br />2: The setting and events that take place throughout the novel would be unfathomable to exist in fairytale; let alone real life. The narrative is so exciting and gripping that I really didn't want the book to end... which is quite a triumph for me as I really don't enjoy reading in general.<br /><br />And finally: 3: The amount of information that Mcdougall provides in the book about running and running styles really boil down to convincing anyone that reads the book to GET UP AND RUN! I've heard stories of people whose lives have changed because of reading this book... and although skeptical at first, these stories really are true. The many secrets that are revealed can make anyone a better runner but most importantly, the main thing that this book provides is the essential motivation to run. Running is the \\"magic bullet\\" as McDougall and numerous physicians say to a better, healthier lifestyle, and this book provides many strategies to help budding runners get there.<br /><br />Overall, just read this book. You'll never want to put it down... except when you get out and run.
0307388921|2.0|The best part about this book is the first page where the author begs you to please stop reading this book. It goes down hill for another 100 pages until it has some memorable quotes about the best way to make people feel better about themselves is for you to pretend to be worse off than they are and letting them give you their help. I think this writer named Chuck Palahnuik's career will end up like Quentin Tarantino's movies, they continue to sell heavily based on things he wrote 15 years ago, except with a lot lesser cooler name than Tarantino.
B007R41E8O|5.0|best game that I have played on the kindle fire. great storyline and puzzles. very engaging and a good way to pass the time
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is good to use your brain for once. It is a great challenge and it takes you to new highs.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I enjoyed this game though the levels were pretty easy. I am looking forward to additional levels as I have already beat the game.
B0086700CM|4.0|the game is fun but the store needs improvement when scroll down it will buy something you don't want just by tapping.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|it's nice to know that there are still a lot of Plain hidden object games, most the time you'll get /download a game  n be stuck wt butttload of commercials n absolutely no games.
B0011Z7JRU|5.0|I'm not going to review this album, everyone knows it's great. Does anyone know how to burn Amazon MP3's onto a disc so they will play on a CD or DVD player? All my players in the house and in the car give me \\"disc error\\". Other than that, no issues with the files on the computer. Higher sample rate (256k) that Amazon provides is great.
1936608898|5.0|Well I am not a big reader.  I have not read many books in my adult life but I knew about \\"It Starts With Food\\" being launched and I bought it.  First is is a great read with the right amount of science, some appropriate walk-the-walk stories and some real life tips/tricks for personal success.  This is not just a book about weight loss or nutrition.  It is a book providing an overarching education about our interactions with food and how modern food quality can be hurting the quality of our life.<br /><br />Melissa and Dallas provide readers with a tool to allow each of us to experiment with our own reactions to the food we eat.  The program, called Whole 30, is a way of getting back to a clean baseline (by eliminating grains, sugar, legumes, dairy, alcohol, and a few other specific ingredients) of clean eating for 30 days.  This allows you to experience life without the background noise of possible sensitivities.  After the 30 days, you can then re-introduce the foods you want to enjoy again and evaluate the \\"effects\\" that they have on your body and quality of life.  Only with this type of experimentation do you truly get the ability to evaluate your food choices with a full understanding of the benefits vs the drawbacks of your food choices.<br /><br />If you question how the quality of your life is being impacted by food and your nutrition, this is the book to provide you with a great method, based on thousands of Whole 30 participants, to take back your own nutrition.  I highly recommend this book!<br /><br />DJ
B0034G4P7G|5.0|I want to start off by saying that they couldn't have used a better musician for the score of this flick than Trent Reznor.  His soft piano playing over top of somewhat unsettling sounds in the background really fits the tone of The Social Network.<br /><br />This is a story that is roughly the same story of many of the worlds tech billionaires.  Apparently on planet earth, the way to get your tech company off the ground is to steal ideas and then put a knife in the back of those who helped you along the way.<br /><br />Maybe you don't agree with the morals of the main character but, it does make for a good movie.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Yes, I'm a muggle and an older one at that, but I still love all things Harry Potter. Great books, great movies, etc. I recently broke down and purchased the 8-DVD set of Harry Potter movies from Amazon.com. The complete film collection is just that - all eight movies in one box set. Amazon had the best price - about $69.00 - and shipped promptly, which was great since I was drooling over the thought of eating popcorn for at least two days while I gorged on Hogwarts and its class act. The set of DVDs is everything it promised and everything the true HP fan will ever need. Don't waste another minute hoping to find all eight movies on Netflix or some subversive website that will make you watch hours of bogus ads just to get a couple of hours of movie. Breakdown and buy it. Own it. You'll enjoy it forever and several days.
B005C9YZKU|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my uncle. The Disks looks great in the globe case, and the fact it was blu-ray quality was great. He was really happy with it and I think that this series does show you a side of out planet that we usually overlook since we are so busy with our day to day lives.<br /><br />It's a great gift and I would recommend anyone to buy it.
B0088X7YU0|5.0|This one blew me away, and keeps me on the edge of my seat just like the original. Older sequels never really brought the tension and fun that i had watching the first starship. But part 4 really shines threw and im really looking forward to the next installment. I recommend this peace of art to starship trooper, scifi, and anime fanes everywhere. 9/10
B009329ZF2|5.0|Lets cut straight to a big negative.. Mothballed Navy museum battle ready probably stretching the imagination a little.. However recently serving in the Navy, they got a lot of story-telling and scenes true, that is very believable. It was very touching to see all the old-school salty dogs kicking some behind. Lots of positives. Great CG, acting was good, don't wish this to be a spoiler review.. So to quickly finish, glad I spent the money to watch. I would watch again, and not many movies I can say that about.
0439023521|3.0|My problem with this book isn't the editorial issues (or lack of). I thought it was well written, but when one has no plot to conceive themselves, I can imagine focusing on the actual writing isn't too difficult. I'm not going to go into all the reasons as to how it is a rip off- they can be found on google (somewhere amongst the pathetic articles staunchly defending HG, listing things like 'one is set in Japan, the other North America' as valid reasons!) or by watching/reading BR. I would have had so much respect for the  author had she admitted to stealing the idea and marketing the book as a western remake. There are differences which would lend it to such a move. The BR act was a government initiative used to create fear, where as The HG could be seen as commenting on the way reality TV is taking over our lives, and as consumerism progresses to Western hegemony as a paradigm, The HG could be the outcome. It's quite a clever spin on the idea.<br />I definitely think that BR would have benefited from a Western remake anyway, but like other Western remakes of Japanese plots and ideas, e.g. The Ring or The Grudge, Collins should have admitted the idea was not hers, or at least heavily based on BR.<br />I think it's much harder and shows more skill to interpret an already existing idea which is foreign to us, and make it mean something to our culture than it is to come up with a post apocalyptic world where one gets to completely rewrite the values and norms of society.<br />But all in all, a good book. However, the thing I enjoyed most of all was the plot, which was stolen, and with Collins' denial of watching/reading BR in the back of my mind throughout, I was just made angry from reading.<br />If anyone is too dim, lacks the research skills to find the 'similarities', or just denies they exist at all and cares enough to want to take me to task on this, I am happy to list them for you.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i love it.... a little additive. though would recommend. to others.... from other ratings. I don't believe ill be doing update
1607885719|4.0|I'm not a big fan of novels about spies, secret operatives or hit men, but David Baldacci is one author who hasn't disappointed me so I decided to give his most recent book, The Innocent, a try in audio book format. The book was read by Ron McLarty and Orlagh Cassidy -- both did a great job.<br /><br />In this story Will Robie, is a hit man for the US government.  His targets typically are terrorists who are planning to harm or threaten the safety and security of others. He is very good at what he does, but there is something about a particular assignment he's given that doesn't sit right with him. He refuses to do what is expected, making him the hunted by those he works for.<br /><br />While Robie is on the run he meets a fourteen-year old girl named Julie Getty who is also running for her life Julie's parents have been murdered and she may now be a target herself.  Against his better judgment, Robie can't run away from her, but he has no idea what he is getting into.<br /><br />This story is fast paced and takes the reader on a wild ride. Numerous twists and turns had me paying extra close attention to what was going on. I found myself having to listen to a bit more and a bit more, finishing the audiobook much sooner than I expected to. There are some heart-pumping moments, and several sub-plots as well.  It's one of the books where you can almost imagine yourself watching the action. The sound effects used in the audiobook intensified this effect, and readers who read this one will be anxious to see how the story lines all tie in.
1936608898|5.0|Even if you refuse to believe that you can do the Whole 30 you should read this book. It very simply spells out how your body operates in relation to the things you put in your mouth. I read the book, completed a Whole 30 and my life will never be the same. It opened my eyes in so many ways and I am far healthier and happier than I ever was before.
0812993292|5.0|Harold Fry is an unassuming man, now retired after more than 45 years at the same job. Even when he retired he chose to go quietly with no recognition or fanfare.  He's always seemed to go through the motions of life never pushing or challenging himself.  Married to Maureen for 45 years, their relationship reminded me of two ships passing in the night.  Everything that Harold does or doesn't do seems to annoy Maureen, to the point where they even have separate bedrooms.  Things apparently changed for them when something happened to their only child, David.<br /><br />One day a letter arrives from a woman named Queenie Hennessy, who Harold had worked with years earlier. She was a woman he had lost contact with and in her letter she says that she is writing to say \\"goodbye\\".  Queenie is dying and spending her final weeks in a hospice facility some 600 miles away.  It is this letter that finally makes Harold take action and challenge himself.  Instead of writing back he decides while off to mail a letter to Queenie that he must \\"walk\\" to see her, sending a message and believing that if he does this, Queenie will live.<br /><br />So begins Harold's \\"pilgrimage\\". Along the way, Harold reflects on his childhood (it explains so much about the man he became), his marriage - the kind of husband he has been and his role as a father.  Along the way Harold meets several interesting individuals who all seem to be unhappy in much the same way Harold is, each longing to be loved.<br /><br />I was so moved by this story. I fell in love with Harold and was moved by his actions and revelations.  This story is so touching and literally left me with a lump in my throat at times.<br /><br />A top 5 read of 2012 thus far...I adored it! Read it!
030758836X|1.0|This book is so meh, the characters so ridiculous and boring, the plot so dull and the \\"insights\\" so trite, I'm thinking if it was published pretty much anyone could take a crack at writing a novel. I don't care one bit what happens to any of these characters. None of the \\"twists\\" surprised me. Wanna read a good book? Try \\"Cruddy.\\" It's so well written you won't be able to decide whether to laugh or scream...not yawn, like I did quite often with this book.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|When i first saw the Maze runner here on Amazon, I have to say that i wasn't ready for what was to come. The Maze Runner was a great book and i couldn't wait to get The Scorch Trials. When I finally did, i was so into the book, that I read it in a day and a half if i recall correctly. It is a page turner; around every corner is yet another surprise waiting. Dashner creates such a vivid picture in your mind that it feels as if you are actually In the story. And he did a nice job of adding different characters, like Brenda and Jorge, into the story and making them fit into it so well. I was kind of disappointed in the beginning because i felt it was repeating itself. The whole Teresa betrayal thing kind of confused me, but it kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the entire book.<br /><br />  Overall a very well rounded book and i can't wait to read The Death Cure. But maybe I'll read The Kill Order first to understand the series better. Oh well, either way, i am excited to read more of James Dashner.

And he is right, you must love what you do for a living, and if you do - it will show in your work, regardless the nature of that work.  His tenacity and endurance and commitment to his chosen profession are nothing short of spiritual.  This was a thoroughly engaging film to watch, beginning to end.  Bravo...!!!

B002VRZEYM|5.0|For the hopelessness you feel while watching this film, that you have no choice but to take what these food producers are stuffing down our throats, at the end the filmmaker provides very sensible suggestions FOR making a difference.  Its true - we are the consumers, and what we purchase, the choices we make, are our votes.  I'm vegan and choose organic over non when possible... even household products, I will buy those which are more environmentally friendly.  I am one person, but if we all did the same, we would have a huge impact, as the filmmaker suggests.  He is right - we are kept from knowing where our food comes from, what is in it, how it is processed, and the black practices which have pervaded the industry - the we need to educate ourselves is a given.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Making this short other wise it'll be really really long, BEST ONE out of the MaKayla Lane series. However, the ending in one part felt a little loose, mainly because it wasn't addressed all the way (Dani). But that's all I'm going to say.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I've had this cover for about 4 months now and am very happy with it. I was a bit wary when I purchased it since some viewers said the cover didn't fit the Kindle Fire, but I had absolutely no problems getting it on. It fits very snugly and I've had no problem with the front cover \\"laying flat.\\" After 4 months, the corners are starting to show a bit of \\"wear,\\" but in an attractive faded way, the way you would expect real leather too. It actually lends the cover a bit of extra character and make it look even more like an antique book!
B0040HO16S|4.0|OK...so most people reviewing have highlighted the fondness for the quaint simplicity of it all. Yes, Dorcas is a busybody who shamelessly flirts with married men and keeps others on a string. Queenie practices folklore akin to witchcraft. Poor Laura seems unable to keep from throwing her affections out for any and every one. The innocence of the children is endearing. All of it is a sort of 19th century \\"Days of Our Lives\\". But this one detail gnaws at me every time I watch an episode. The 1st season starts out establishing that Lark Rise falls just under the 8-mile limit for the P.O. to deliver telegrams for free. But all throughout the series folks are popping over back and forth from Lark Rise to Candleford...mostly on foot. 8 miles is 2 1/2 hours walking time! Even in a horse and cart it's an hour. This fact totally nags at me when I watch this otherwise cute \\"soap opera\\". :-)
B000002UB6|1.0|The Beatles had run out of things to say musically, and they couldn't stand the sight of each other; hence you get this piece of dreck.  Across the Universe is good and belongs on a Lennon album.  The rest is crap.  Summer of '67 produced the last great Beatles music, Sgt. Pepper.  Abbey Road is perhaps the most overrated record of all time.  Name the great songs on Abbey Road.  Something?  The medley?  Oh, Darling?  Because?  Please!  All mediocre by Beatles standards.  Paul was already doing his &#34;granny music&#34; as John called it, and John was sick of being a Beatle.  They didn't have any more Sergeant Peppers in them.  Like Hendrix and the Doors, they had run dry; their best music was behind them.  This album just showcases that shortcoming.

B001VLXNLU|5.0|As author of [[ASIN:B008ZGGLR2 Champagne Cocktails (Romance Novel)]] I really enjoyed the unique take on turning into a Vampyre and joining a vampyre school. I also enjoyed the unique setting of Oklahoma vs. some of the traditional settings for Vampyre books like New Orleans. Zoey didn't really start to grow on me until the second book of the series. Zoey seemed a little spoiled in the first book and not as endearing as she became to me in Betrayed. I just finished Burned and absolutely loved the series so far and I am looking forward to reading Awakened.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book has more twists and turns than Lombard Street in San Francisco.  It is quite entertaining with the chapters flipping from husband to wife villian; it will keep the pages turning--until the end where it falls flat.  It would be a 4-5 star if the author could have figured out how to end it.
B0009VSB06|5.0|I've used this detector for some 20 hours as of this review and really love it.  The best reward so far was finding a little girls ring at the beach.  Great tool for the biginner and Pro alike.  I recommend it to anyone.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|I am writing this review to admit that I was wrong with the review that I listed. I also hope that the seller can accept my apology for labeling his product as bootleg. After researching the dvd artwork, I discovered that it's supposed to look that way.
030758836X|5.0|If I were going to write a effusive review of GONE GIRL, I might wax rhapsodic about a plot that unfolds like a Bach fugue, taking a simple theme and expanding on it, introducing variations, interweaving lines in intricate counterpoint and taking so many twists and turns I almost, but never quite, forget the tune. So melodic that I hum along even when it shifts from major to minor key and back again.<br /><br />I might marvel and wonder at characters imbued with so much richness and detail I feel I know them more intimately than my best friends, my spouse. Until they surprise me into realizing I don't know them any better than they know themselves. Characters who draw me in so completely that I love and hate them in turn as their stories, and psychoses, are revealed.<br /><br />I could effervesce over wit as dry and sharp as a desert cactus, leavening the dark, mean and nasty corners of the human mind with just enough light and warmth to keep me turning the pages and wanting more.<br /><br />I might even admit to lusting after Flynn's lush and lustrous prose, jaw-dropping writing that nonetheless follows Elmore Leonard's advice and never gets in the way. A facility for language that leaves me greening to write that well (yet never wishing to be her--the stuff in Flynn's head is way too scary).<br /><br />My books won't win any awards this year--GONE GIRL is too damn good. It certainly doesn't need a review from me to draw attention to it. And a practical review might include such things as what the book's about (read the jacket copy) and if it's okay for your teenage daughter to read (definitely not). Besides, if someone really asked me to write a review, I could do it with a single word--brilliant.<br /><br />1. shining brightly; sparkling  2. vivid; intense  3. very splendid or distinguished  4. having or showing keen intelligence, great talent or skill, etc. (Mirriam Webster New World Dictionary)<br /><br />Brilliant. That is all.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|Firefly is simply one of the greatest shows ever made. Its cancellation is unforgivable. Nothing else needs to be said.
B006LEHOL2|5.0|I have been listening to Sinead O'Connor since 1990.  I own all her albums.  I love her songwriting and fearless honesty.<br /><br />Lately I've been listening to Sinead a good deal again, and I just want to take a moment to recommend her new album most highly. It's my favorite of all her albums. She's even got a song, \\"Take Off Your Shoes\\", in which she sings from the point of view of Jesus confronting the Catholic Church for child abuse. This is strong, intense stuff, and I love it. Every track is great. If you ever liked her voice or her absolute social criticism, you need this album. What amazes me most is that her voice is as high and sharp as ever. Deep, full, rich, melodic, beautiful.<br /><br />I won't go into a track-by-track review except to say that \\"Reason with Me\\" is my favorite Sinead track; I love its chord progression.<br /><br />Also, I think that those who have criticized the cover miss its point: Sinead was a sad Irish girl.  The cover shows a sad Irish girl.  I believe it represents all abused Irish children, including Sinead, who, thanks to her voice, can speak for them and has the courage to do so.<br /><br />Thank you, Sinead O'Connor.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|After reading 50 Shades, I was really desperate for a good love story. This book was that and more. I read this book for hours every night and couldn't put it down. The erratic, twisted love between Abby and Travis sucked me in and engulfed my mind. I highly recommend this book. Great read for the hopeless romantic!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this little battery app. I would have paid for this one! no more guessing if i have enough time left to finish my movie...tells me right there hrs and mins for video. thank you!!
B004WOS3P4|4.0|Well, that's what the chorus sounds like for his track \\"Fade Into Me\\".  Overall, this album is 1000x better than his first \\"big release\\".  David Cook is an awesome, unique musician that grew into his shoes on American Idol.  His covers and performances were unique, catchy, and struck a chord.  It was a far cry from the other manufactured artists that came through that show.  When his first self-titled album was released, it was good, but still largely disappointing because it had \\"American Idol's\\" generic sound attached it.  I remember thinking, \\"I bought this for David Cook's sound... not American Idols!\\"  This album steps away from that, and while still not quite the Cook we got to know on the show, it's much closer than the last album.  And yes, it's a very good album.
B0084IG7KC|5.0|I did not read the book(s) by this author, nor see the movie at the theatres, but I was anxious to see it on Blue-Ray DVD when it was recently released.  After watching it the first time, I found the beginning quite slow but as the 2 heroes began their journey to the Capital to be prepped for the games, did it really start to get exciting.  First off this movie is very well casted and each made an outstanding performance.  Katniss, was my favorite and even little the little black girl who befriended her, whose name escapes me at the moment.  I was on the edge of my seat during the whole \\"games\\" part of the movie and bit my nails down to nothing.  This movie was so good, in my opinion, after renting it, I purchased it as well to see it whenever I wanted to.  I am very tempted to read the 2nd book now, since if it ends up being done as well as the first episode, it should be excellent reading.<br /><br />This is definitely an action packed film, with love and tenderness thrown in to a world in which our own is slowing evolving into. It isn't to much of a stretch to see this happening in the not so distant future, not to children persa, but to adults who would kill each other to win millions or be set for the rest of their life.  Especially, those who live in poverty and from hand to mouth.  I pray this never really happens, but blood, gore, violence are becoming more and more the norm and excepted by those that are young and middle aged alike.<br /><br />Anyway, my main point being this is still a great movie to buy, since I believe you will want to watch it again and again.  Thank you for reading my review.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This is a overall great upbeat game! I love it! I would recommend it to anyone who likes steady paced games.
B009329ZF2|1.0|I should have known, just before renting it, that anything with Rhianna as the key actor in the film can't be good, and I was right.  I was able to stomach most of it, except her bad acting, until the ending when it just so happens that out of the blue the veterans from the Navy museum ship the \\"Missouri\\" just happened to all be there, dressed in uniform and ready to take down the aliens. Oh, and by the way, the ship was completely filled with live ordinance. One Veteran even said he was \\"Ready to rock and roll???\\" Give me a break! How many 70'ish veterans do you know that go around saying that... even those who are not U.S. Veterans. CHEESY!<br /><br />If you want to waste your time and see this, don't expect anything original or thrilling.  You are probably better off just watching Independence Day again.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|You might be looking at this thinking \\"40 bucks for a single controller? Jeez, that's a lot!\\", but keep in mind, you'll be getting a brand-new controller. Totally clean, entirely pristine condition controller. The color is great, the cord makes my other Gamecube controllers' cords feel short, and the responsiveness is awesome. Control sticks are very responsive and snappy. If you're looking to get a Gamecube controller to last you a while, go for this one, hands down - you won't be disappointed.

B0012PDVQ2|3.0|Any Blade Runner fan knows that the directors (\\"Final\\") cut doesn't include Harrison Ford narrating above the story.  I have never read the arguments For and Against this - I just have my opinion:  I vastly prefer the narration.  I have tried 3 times to watch the Final Cut version, and it's just simply not as good.  And I'm forced to do that because the non-final-cut version isn't available anywhere.  Pretty frustrating.
B000QRIGJY|3.0|The thirteenth Bosch novel starts just most, if not all all of the others... with a dead body.  Many of the similarities end there, though. Originally published as a sixteen-part serial for the NYT Magazine, The Overlook ends up being about a third of the size of your typical Bosch novel. It reads more like an Ed McBain procedural - and that's not a bad thing.  Connelly keeps it short, concise, and fast moving with little or no fluff.  By the end even Bosch reflects on how much transpired in just 12 hours.<br /><br />Way too many people seem hung up on how short this one was or the lack of character development.  After a dozen or so previous books, how much more development can there be?  By this point even the supporting cast is pretty well fleshed out.  Connelly has managed to keep the series fresh for so long my trying out new ideas and perspectives, not by making Bosch a particularly complex character.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is really. great,  especially for a free game.  very entertaining. and addictive .  wish there were fewer letters,  but that is really not a big deal.
B00022GJ4M|5.0|I was in Boston one night in my life. In the summer of 1977 my friend and I were on our way to Maine for vacation. We checked into a Howard Johnson's and decided to hit the night life. We had no idea where we were going, so we parked the car and started walking. Right away we came upon a place called the Jazz Workshop, and lo and behold, Muddy Waters was on the bill, and it was fifteen minutes before show time. (Things like this always happen to me.) We walked in, sat at the bar, (which had an unobstructed view of the stage), and proceeded to be serenaded by the Muddy Waters Band.<br />Now this was not the same sound we first heard earlier in the year, in March, at NYC's Palladium, when Muddy played with Johnny Winter, James Cotton, and assorted band members from the Cotton and Waters band, (which is the lineup on this album). The Muddy we saw in Boston was laid back, and anchored by guitarists Bob Margolin and Luther 'Guitar Junior' Johnson. I am not complaining because in the course of that year, at these two gigs, I got to see and hear both sides of Muddy, and I was quite satisfied.<br />But the Muddy of 'Hard Again' provided the transition, (for a Blues/Rock fan such as myself). Self-weened on Johnny Winter, Eric Burdon, Jimi Hendrix, Leslie West, Ten Years After, (and many more), I had only recently started getting into the originators of the blues format. I had Muddy's Chess Blues Masters Series double album, which had on it all of his \\"greatest hits\\". But upon first listen of 'Hard Again' I was blown away. This was an album I could play for my friends; at parties, in the car, on the beach, (always with an ample supply of beer and amplification). Johnny Winter was not only credited with producing the album and adding his vocal and instrumental touch, he was listed for \\"miscellaneous screaming\\". And, judging by the album photos, (especially the one with a beer in his hand), and the aforementioned screaming, Johnny Winter had as much fun making the music as we had listening to it. James Cotton, Mr. Superharp himself, also had a blast, and there has never been an occasion, either live or recorded, where Mr. Cotton didn't give 150%, (and this album is no different).<br />But,of course, Muddy was the star. His career had returned, and now he was on the world stage, and, he too seemed to enjoy it. At the time it was the top-selling blues album, and the three albums that Mr. Winter produced that followed in the next few years, 'I'm Ready', 'King Bee', and 'Muddy \\"Mississippi\\" Waters Live, (in addition to the more recent release 'Breakin It Up Breakin' It Down), complete the picture.<br />I have heard many so-called blues \\"purists\\" lament the making of these albums. (Their opinions reminded me of Pete Seeger's outburst at the Newport Folk Festival when Dylan went electric). I feel sorry for them, because the confluence of factors that brought this group together; on that record label, at that time, could never be repeated. But forget all of that, just get the album and enjoy it.
0823023494|5.0|I loved the book since the very first moment I saw it on this site and I didn´t stop even after I finished the last page.<br />It only have some minor cons: Although the book try to cover many areas of the design the truth is that is too centered in the theme of the animation (Specially the classic Disney style) and the fact that sometimes some topics that may interest you don´t have the length that you would probably prefer.<br />But honestly it have far more pros: Each chapter is pretty well explained in an easy to understand way, the fact that the author have a lot of experience in the field makes you confident in the quality of your purchase, the advices are very good, the illustrations are beautiful.<br />I can go and go telling you why you should buy this wonderful book, but probably it would be enough letting you know two things:<br />1. Instead of telling you how you must do the job the author seeks to help you find a vision and style of your own, giving you just tools and tips that are going to make your technique stronger and more appealing to other people.<br />2. Only watching the bunch of sketches and conceptual art and reading about how exciting its to bring to live to a character makes you want to look for a paper piece to start drawing and watch by yourself how the magic works.
B002RPPO3O|5.0|Definitely the best Chucky movie made. If you watch all of the series you can't miss this one. This is hands down my personal fav.
B004EK926K|5.0|We downloaded this movie to our TV, and we were quite impressed with the quality of the video as well as the presentation of this classic story.  It is a CGI animated film with Jim Carrey as Scrooge, as well as the Christmas spirits.  In an amazing and novel approach to the use of CGI, Carrey's voice and even his face were blended into these characters to create a captivating movie.  Amazon's delivery process is flawless.  Thumbs up all around!
B000IZ21BS|5.0|How can you go wrong? This is where it all started. I remember seeing this movie when I was a kid. Great movie I highly recommend.
1451627297|3.0|This novel was quite interesting, but, in my view, fell apart towards the end. The research on Dallas in 1963 is fascinating and plot in the days leading to November 22 is gripping but, although idea of 'what-if-Kennedy-had-not-been-shot' is worth exploring (as it is, for example in Jeff Golden's book Unafraid: A Novel of the Possible (2008)), King's version is too reminiscent of the horror-story format of his other novels, and the final few pages are too sentimental and sweet. Finally, it is clear that even a writer as experienced as King needs a better editor: he writes of Ruby buying the police free drinks - you either buy drinks or give free drinks ... buying drinks which are free is not much of a bribe!
B000JIHP88|4.0|The best aspect of this product is the natural sounds that lull baby to sleep. The music option is bad, like many baby toys, phony tone and annoying. The leaves that open an close while the animals rotate are very cool. The light on the base is alright, nothing special.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|This movie is an inspiration on the art of living fully. Jiro is a sushi maker par excellance, he is artist, businessman, entrepreneur and innovator. This is where we need to return to in our lives. The joy of working, striving to do our best. This is where managing business by accounting and numbers purely totally misses the mark and creates resentful and disenchanted workers. People need to have the opportunity to strive in their craft, to take pride in what they do, be in sushi. making cars, driving a taxi, being an executive. It is is not about being important but rather about being devoted. Fantastic film. Much to be learned from watching this. I will watch it many times.
B007SGM084|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey meets all the expectations of cheap romance novel set by its predecessor Twilight. Read it for fun, but take all of the content lightly. If a man is controlling in a relationship, no matter how hard you try, he almost definitely will not change unlike one of the main characters in this book. If this book did not have the same amount of sex that it currently does, much of the appeal of the plot would disappear. However, the sex is fun to read. This book should be considered soft porn rather than a good story.
0375507256|5.0|Cloud Atlas is the third novel by British author David Mitchell. The stories of six lives from five different centuries are told in differing formats. The first story, The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing is written, as the title suggests, in journal format and appears to be the fragment of a journal that American notary, Adam Ewing wrote whilst travelling the Pacific in the 19th century, in particular, Adam's experience at the Chatham Islands near New Zealand with a native stowaway and the voyage to Hawaii. Letters from Zedelghem are written in 1931 by the disinherited, gambling, bankrupt composer and petty thief, Robert Frobisher, to his friend, Rufus Sixsmith, a physicist at Cambridge, and describe his experience as the amanuensis to a dying master composer Vyvyan Ayrs in Belgium. Half Lives -The First Luisa Rey Mystery is a narrative set in California in 1975, Luisa Rey being a reporter seeking out the truth about a nuclear energy facility after an encounter with physicist Rufus Sixsmith. The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish, a memoir set in the 21st century, details the accidental incarceration into a retirement home of the elderly but still quite capable Timothy Cavendish, and his attempts at escape therefrom. An Orison of Sonmi-451, a recorded interview with a clone named Sonmi-451, is set in Korea in the 22nd century when consumerism is the byword and clones do all the work. Sonmi-451 \\"ascension\\" to a higher state and the resulting events are described. And Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin' After appears to be set in Hawaii in the 23rd century, after a breakdown of society has occurred. Zachry narrates the events of the visit of a Prescient named Meronym to the Nine Folded Valleys and her stay amongst the Valleysmen. Whilst each of the lives is seemingly unconnected, there are common elements in each (dreams, places, people, birthmarks, ships, music) that form a tantalising if tenuous link between each tale. Each story is nested within the next one, and Robert Frobisher's description of his Cloud Atlas Sextet applies equally to David Mitchell's novel: \\"a \\"sextet for soloists': piano, clarinet, `cello, flute, oboe and violin, each in its own language of key, scale and colour. In the 1st set, each solo is interrupted by its successor: in the 2nd, each interruption is recontinued, in order.\\" This is an interesting device and joins the separate stories, each containing hints and clues, into a compelling whole that gives the overall picture. In David Mitchell's version of the future, propaganda, blackmail, corporate greed and corruption are still rife; little about the interaction between civilisation and \\"savages\\" changes over 500 years. That said, there's plenty of humour amongst the action and drama, as well as some beautiful prose: \\"The room bubbles with sentences spoken more than listened to\\". It may be a long novel, but I would have relished more of Luisa Rey and Timothy Cavendish. A marvellous read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As an older adult, I was at first shocked at the submissive sex.  However I did find the story line very good once you got past the sex.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|the app itself is ok, but it made my kindle fire slightly laggy, which got annoying. if you are willing to deal with that, its awesome! otherwise its ok.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|Overall, I was sorely disappointed in the lack of story. While the cinematography was breathtaking, without a story there is no movie. Well, unless you make a make a documentary of just the landscape...but even then, you still need a story.<br />The story follows a British aristocrat wife, who is forced to go down to Australia to see to her interests in cattle ranch.<br />I found the story lacking in the following areas: failure to have good characters with depth and intrigue that made us feel empathy for them, failure to hook the audience (i.e. me) into the story within the first 10 minutes, and a story that lacked depth in taking the audience on a compelling journey.  And for me, that means certain death for a movie, based on the rules and business of storytelling.<br />It could have been a very powerful story (I have no doubts that Australia has the history for such stories), hooked the audience, and really taken us on an amazing journey of Australia and made us emotionally invested in the story.<br />I point to poor writing in character and story development.<br />We didn't make it past 18 min in, and therefore my review is on those 18 minutes.<br />I would not purchase this movie, recommend it, or ever watch it again.
1936608898|5.0|I loved this book.  And I am NOT one of the authors' \\"seminar\\" people - I'm just some schmuck that fell upon their website, Whole9, while surfing the net for nutritional info.  Nobody asked me to come and put this review on Amazon - I'm doing it because I truly  believe in what these folks are doing. I definitely don't give a rip whether either of them have fancy degrees in nutrition or the fact that they are not (GASP!) doctors.  Who cares?  What they are doing is helping people, thousands and thousands of people, change their lives in a healthy, positive manner. People who have nasty things to say about that are just angry individuals who need to criticize others to make themselves feel superior.  I mean, what is so extreme about eating healthy, real food?  I just don't see the downside. And why do you need an overpriced education to even talk about it? That is just plain dumb.  The book is well-written in a very non-scientific way (while still getting the science across - quite a feat) and is readable by any person.  I believe that was the authors' point.  The bottom line for me is not just what the authors say, however - The real proof that their method works is all of the testimonials, the RESULTS.  They speak for themselves.<br /><br />In my opinion, the authors were very brave to put themselves and their book out there, with no medical or other special degrees, just to tell us what worked for them and their clients.  The scientific and medical community will take the typical swipes at the authors but in the end, I believe the philosophy of the book will prove to be scientifically and medically sound. I feel very hopeful that people will begin to truly embrace the concept that our food is making us sick and that changing our food will change our lives and our entire world.  The Hartwigs are helping pave the way for this massive change in thinking and I applaud them for their courage, commitment and perseverance in spite of the naysayers.  Keep up the fight, guys. You are making a difference.
0307454568|3.0|I'm a fan of the first two books - classic page turners with twists and turns. I was wondering how the third book would conclude the trilogy.  I have to say, I was a little disappointed. I just couldn't get into it like the first two. It seemed much more about politics and espionage than anything else. I can understand the need for background info, but seriously most of the book just comes across as dry and unfortunately predictable.
B008D1RCI6|2.0|I'm peeved - I bought this CD because I read a couple of five star reviews that made me think that Britain's own Bob Dylan (sorry, Donovan, close but no cigar) has been languishing undiscovered for decades before triumphantly re-emerging with the help of some established stars. And because I like Wilco.<br /><br />Briefly, I was disappointed. The music itself is fine, as you might expect with the calibre of some of the backing artistes. The singing is, frankly, strained, but adequate.<br /><br />In a fair and kind world the lyrics wouldn't be discussed, but even though generally I am flushed with bonhomie, I think prospective buyers should be warned that those of a delicate and discerning nature may be reduced to apoplexy by their triteness. Aiming at a combination of heartfelt emotion and homespun wisdom, they achieve only a turgid mix of sentimentality and platitudes (\\"Like my old Dad said, Life is people\\" - says it all, really) which did indeed raise strong emotions in me, but none of them were the intended ones.<br /><br />Worth avoiding unless you are curious about what all the fuss is, and have a few bob to spare.
B0091P6392|5.0|WOW!  Love, love, love this show!  I wish it had a longer run season.  That Lewis is so........devious and immature for a working professional!  But for some reason, he is lovable when he wants to be.  Love Harvey, Jessica, Mike, Donna, and Rachael.  They are really good actors, and I love their TV characters!  Kudos to the writers of this show.  Love the humor, it is what keeps it all interesting and funny; and, it will provide longevity for the show!<br /><br />It was wonderful to get that horrible Hardman person out of the law firm.  Harvey was right, he hadn't and wasn't planning to change for the better.  Thus, the good guys won!!  At least for now anyway.<br /><br />Love you Gabriel............you play a great Harvey Spector and love this persona.<br /><br />Please, someone tell me what song is playing when Harvey visits his father's grave in the episode before last.  Thank you!!<br /><br />Josey Newman, Atlanta, GA<br />newman.joann@gmail.com
B0088RQ4TI|5.0|Well worth the tiny rental fee. Action packed, visually stunning and the story line held my attention from start to finish. Maybe not for little kids, say 5 and under but the whole family will love grabbing some pocorn and sitting down for a family night watching this flick! Highly recommended!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am sorry that I didn't read some of the reviews prior to purchasing the trilogy. I will certainly do so next time before ordering a book(s) based on the public hype. I won't repeat what other (negative) comments so eloquently stated. I cannot believe, however, that this was so highly recommended by so many media outlets. It just goes to show how low our society has sunk, and how low our standards for entertainment have become. It has nothing to do with the content (I am no prude). It was the repetition of the same events/situations with no plot development. The story went nowhere and was poorly written. I stopped reading after the first few chapters of the 2nd installment and asked Amazon for my money back. Thank goodness they obliged me. I just wish I had those few hours of my life back that I wasted reading this trash.

1439102430|4.0|Reichs again strikes gold, or diamonds, with her latest Temerance Brennan novel. Back again in Montreal, the discovery of three dead babies hidden in secret alcoves of an apartment send Brennan and her partner, Lieutenant-d&egrave;tective Andrew Ryan on the search for their missing mother. Seeking a prostitute is not as easy as one might think, and their search leads them from Montreal to Edmonton where they pair up with Brennan's one time ex-lover, Sergeant Oliver Hasty.<br />The discovery of another body, a drug dealing violent pimp, and a still missing mother lead the group from Edmonton to Yellowknife, deep in the Far North of Canada. Once the center of a gold rush, Yellowknife now is home to diamond mines, and controversy over the environmental concerns of the caribou. To make matters worse, old murders come to life, family scandal muddles the investigation and war wages over drug control, leaving more death and mystery for Brennan, Ryan, and Ollie.<br />Reichs expertly fills the pages with fast moving action, solid forensics, and a wide assortment of colorful characters, as a vivid plot unfolds leading to a dramatic climax. Fans of Brennan will enjoy the history, scenery, and the mystery weaved into Bones are Forever.<br />baseballvalbooks.wordpress.com
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better then the first book. A must read as it really expands the characters and comes with somed twists. A must read!!!
0345803485|1.0|If I could I would give these books a negative rating. They are terribly written and take about a 4th grade reading level to understand. This series ranks up with the twilight series terribly written \\"books\\" written for the easily fooled into thinking that this is quality novel stirring.

B008IEFP1E|5.0|Love this album!  It's the first one in a long time I can listen to straight through without wanting to hit the skip button.  Good variety of sounds, not all songs have the same feel.  Almost every single song is about breaking up, and he says the word cry in just about all of them as well, but it's not a downer album at all.  Still has the same Maroon 5 feel, but I actually think it's more melodic than the last one.  I love it - give it a try!
B0037QGS0A|4.0|There were twists, turns, the actresses were amazing and the acting was the best I've seen in a while. There was a bit of sex and other lovely things, but I think the story was unique in it's own way and I did love the character Chloe. I felt for her. I wish the story was longer or went into who she was more. It was a good movie and I'd recommend it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|best on the market. this app cant be beat. it is spot on and has saved my asa several times.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Lep's World is a shameless Super Mario clone. However, that's not necessarily a bad thing in this case. After all, the iPhone has a vast and huge library of lots of games, yet it's not like Nintendo will ever contribute to it. So why not have Lep's World come in and fill that Mario gap?<br /><br />The levels totally scream \\"MARIO\\", as this little leprechaun is busy bouncing on enemies, bashing bricks, and gathering coins. That said, the level design and gameplay are pretty rad, since Mario is one of the best platforming experiences around. However, I wish there was a little more enemy variety, as well as more power-ups other than being able to shoot.<br /><br />Despite those somewhat minor flaws, I still managed to have fun with the game.....Until after the first world. Apparently, that's where it hit me: This was actually a demo. And may I ask WHY? Why the heck wasn't this titled \\"Lep's World Lite\\"? Why is the full game called \\"Lep's World Plus\\", even though that's...Lep's World as a full game! It's like calling Pac-Man, \\"Pac-Man Plus\\", and the Lite version, \\"Pac-Man\\". It's a big slap in the face.<br /><br />But by all means, definitely buy Lep's World...Plus..........<br />It's a great Mario clone. Nothing more. Nothing less.
B005LAIH5O|1.0|This movie just proves that some people will watch anything... just throw a lot of light, movement, and loud noises together and we have a movie! The reason Hollywood keeps putting out utter garbage like this is because we keep paying to see it. I really have to stop letting my friends drag me to watch this visual vomit.<br /><br />Overall, the film is utterly lacking in visual appeal. The locations are drab and colorless from the first scene to the last, with little more than barren rocks, caverns, and the occasional ruin to look at. Every frame is suffused in browns, blacks, grays so there is literally nothing to grab or attract the eye. The only splashes of color are the sky, the sea, and frequent bursts, explosions of fire. It may as well have been filmed in black and white. Even for an all-action, all-the-time movie, it is one of the dullest looking films I've ever seen.<br /><br />The plot actually manages to be worse than the first installment, in so much as it was clearly written as an after-thought to the action. I could readily believe that the writers penned all of the combat scenes first, and then hastily constructed a story to link them all together. The result is an almost incomprehensible mess with a lot of sword fights and fireballs.<br /><br />To be fair to the actors, some of whom are of the first caliber in other films, there is very little they could do to breathe life into this script. One can only make so many grimaces while leaping and jumping and grunting, which pretty much sums up the dialogue. As another reviewer stated, Wrath of the Titans is pure product, absent of any creativity or imagination whatsoever; the fact that nobody associated with Wrath---from the writers to the director to the stars believed in what they were doing (apparently everybody was just there for the paycheck) shows in every single frame. Wrath is utterly lifeless, devoid of color, emotion, or meaning. In short, visual vomit.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|Well, Sonic Generations took my personal spotlight for the Best Sonic Game Ever, but Sonic CD is still one of my top favorite Sonic games, and now that there's this remake, everyone will get to see why I love it so much (To come to think of it.....Maybe this remake and Generations get my top spot...).<br /><br />Sonic CD was released for the notorious Sega CD, an add-on for the Sega Genesis. It was the only game on the add-on to sell around a million copies. But even then, many fans haven't heard of this game. At least it was re-released in Sonic Gems Collection. And now, it's gotten full-time respect with a remake of the game that now includes the Japanese soundtrack AND US soundtrack, Tails, and a whole bunch of achievements! To think just the lone fact that it's portable makes it worth buying.<br /><br />As for the main game itself, Sonic CD took what made Sonics 1 & 2 so awesome, and multiplied them 10 times over! This game has all the high-speed Sonic action you could ever want. Not only is the platforming action top-notch, but the new levels are better than ever! And they are full of extremely colorful detail. Plus, in the Special Stages, you can navigate Sonic around roads to destroy UFOs to gather Time Stones (Alternate version of Chaos Emeralds basically) in a Mode-7-like view; a unique goal for a Special Stage. This remake in particular manages to also fix some minor collision problems I've experienced in the original. There's also the option to play as Tails (after beating the game as Sonic), who is basically ripped right out of Sonic 3, complete with the ability to fly.<br /><br />What quickly won me over was the ability to switch between Japanese and American soundtracks of the game. The Japanese soundtrack is EXTREMELY catchy as heck, while the American soundtrack is kinda catchy, but rather is it more atmospheric. Each and every song flows with brilliance, not to mention the rest of the game doing that, too.<br /><br />Overall, this is one Sonic game you have gotta try! If you like the Genesis Sonics, you will LOVE Sonic CD. It's better than every Sonic game there is, with the exception of Generations. Plus, you can buy this for just a measly $5 bucks.you have gotta try! If you like the Genesis Sonics, you will LOVE Sonic CD. It's better than every Sonic game there is, with the exception of Generations. Plus, you can buy this for just a measly $5 bucks.

Dont just play to pass the game , get perfects on evey one .the green squares are my favorite ...no wait its the blue ones..er no ah whatever , I cant stop playing , what day is it ?thanks tiny bite ,keep the good works going !
0439023513|1.0|Bleak. But not the poignant kind of bleak. Just a dull, sad story filled with poorly developed characters that leave you listless and unsatisfied.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this game is off the hooked<br /><br />I love it so much I cannot stop playing it<br />plus it is a strategy game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I start my day off every day with this! It is so up lifting! I love this app I recommend this to everyone
B0085776BG|1.0|sucked. story line wasnt what you would expect it to be. it was not historically interesting and you could not even tell who was the hero of the story
B00000K0E5|1.0|Ordered a DVD that ended up right in the trash. After being in the DVD player for about 5 seconds in would freeze. I tried it multiple times but it kept doing the same thing. Never doing business with them again. It's pointless to make a return on an item that costs as much as the shipping.
B006ZNRD06|1.0|tried this app on Kindle Fire but video was very poor. audio was never in synch.<br /><br />found cinexplayer and that works brilliantly. suggest leave this one alone until they fix all the issues with choppy video and audio synchronous.
1558908382|5.0|Best line....'Do you get dental with that?'<br /><br />NO SPOILERS -<br />I won't give anything away.<br /><br />Love John Cusack & this movie is one of his best!  Comedy...thy name is John Cusack!<br /><br />Still funny & worth seeing.  Plus this movie offers one of the best soundtracks!
B008IGP8RI|3.0|A nice soundtrack overall. I am disappointed that they did not include \\"Do Not I Love Thee\\" from the Amish church service.
B005KELWJY|5.0|I bought this for my Dad's Kindle and he loves it.  The fit is perfect and allows him to protect the Kindle as well as make it look nice when folded or open for reading.
B001NXDSLG|2.0|I was disappointed with this product. Blu-ray did not enhance the video quality as much as I had hoped, and the aspect ratio left huge black borders not only at the top and bottom, which I can accept; but also on the sides, which I cannot. Sound quality was also disappointing. In my view, this was a waste of money.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|This is one great movie, and as I often say, a \\"Keeper\\".<br /><br />The little girls are soooo cute, and the premise is very plausible. Love the \\"Minions\\"!<br /><br />Disk set includes Blue-Ray 3D/2D, and DVD. Nice!<br /><br />Great 3D scenes where in some movies you'd find it objectionable, but fits nicely here.<br /><br />Trivia: To make \\"Agnes\\" giggle on cue, they recorded her while her Dad tickled her. Got the job done!
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire was my absolute favorite of the Hunger Games Trilogy. Never a dull moment! Truly a page turner- think I got paper cuts flying through this book! Can not wait for this movie!  Thanks Suzanne Collins!
B002YK8OKC|5.0|As number 2 of the 4 series of movies, it's definitely the second-most funny of them (let's not even discuss 3 and 4, agreed?).<br /><br />Just when you think you're going to get pulled into a sentimental sweet perspective on goofball Clark, he gets the floor pulled out from under him (literally).<br /><br />The scene of Beverly D'Angelo's hand-placement when the cops bust in the house is toooo much!<br /><br />Two thumbs up!
0439023521|5.0|This series was amazing! I typically read \\"chic\\" books so I was hesitant when my kids talked me into reading this. WOW, I could not put it down! Very creative, very well written. As soon as I finished this one I immediatly bought Catching Fire!  Thanks Suzanne Collins!
B005BCE7II|5.0|This is one of those movies that after you've purchased it, you're glad you did (because it's a keeper).<br /><br />The package includes the Blue-Ray 3D, Blue-Ray regular, and standard DVD. So, if you want to lay down on the couch and watch it again (but not in 3D because the glasses don't work side-ways), no problem!<br /><br />Scrat is sooooo cute!!!! I wish there was more of him!<br /><br />Love it!
0439023513|3.0|I anxiously started Mockingjay the minute I finished Catching Fire but was soooo disappointed with how uneventful it was. I actually put it away only half read- just couldnt make myself finish. About 2 weeks later my daughter finally made me pull it out of the closet and finish it. After I got through the first half, it did pick up a little momentum but nothing at all like the first two. The only reason I finished it was because I wanted to know who Katniss ended up with- Gale or Peeta.  The ending was not at all what I had hoped for with regards to life after the Hunger Games.  I still think Suzanne Collins is a brilliant author, would definitly read more of her books.
B005MQW5RI|4.0|I kinda wish I had seen this in the theater before purchasing it, because honestly, it's not a \\"keeper\\".<br /><br />The package comes with a Blue-Ray 3D & 2D disk (but no regular DVD...bummer).<br /><br />An \\"OK\\" movie...probably more entertaining for kids I suppose.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i like the variety of all the games and most of them are quick.  don't like all the ads, some not age appropriate for my kids.
B000PTYUQG|3.0|Stravinsky is one of my favorite composers but I have mixed feelings about this set.  It's been widely noted that Stravinsky was not the best conductor of his own works and these discs give evidence of that.  A lot of the recordings here seem to lack the energy and enthusiasm that I've heard in other performances. His symphony in C, symphony in three movements and some of his later works were the only things that I really enjoyed here.<br /><br />On the plus side this set is pretty cheap and it does include a lot of hard to find rarities.  I think it contains everything Stravinsky composed.  The only thing I noticed it lacking was the complete version of The Soldier's Tale.  It's only available in suite form here but that's o.k. by me because I prefer the suite version anyway.<br /><br />In short, if you love Stravinsky then (given the low price) you might want to get this set but if you're new to his music then you might want to start elsewhere.  If you don't already love Stravinsky then these discs probably won't change your mind.
1476712042|1.0|The worst book I've read on my Kindle in 4 years.....just awful. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY. I paged through 3/4 just to \\"see what happened\\"....not much.
B001EBV0OY|5.0|This movie was by far one of the best movies I have watched in a very long time!!! And I watch many movies. I consider it a grand slam!!!!
B00417HV14|5.0|This is an excellent concert!  Love his music.  There was even a big surprise for all in the concert.  We saw Joe Bonamassa in Bigfork, Montana last summer (2011).  What a royal treat that also was.  No one will be disappointed with this DVD!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This software is the easiest to edit on her smartphone screen and even though I have purchased another software,  I use exclusively OfficeSuite Professional.
B007X4N0DU|5.0|I love these guys. They play for you. I pray they keep it up as this is what I needed and feel needs to be put out there. I'm required to write a minimum of 20 words for this review but only three are needed. Power, meaning, love.
B008E374PO|4.0|Having listened through \\"Maybe I'm Dreaming,\\" \\"Ocean Eyes,\\" and \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful,\\" I can say that this pretty much put Owl City back on course.  His previous album, \\"All Things Bright and Beautiful,\\" had a lot of changing melodies and off-beat quirks that makes it hard to grasp.  But there is also a lack of consistent melodies or... \\"feel\\" of the tunes to really like it.  It is something I also look into when I started listening to Owl City.<br /><br />\\"The Midsummer Station\\" is, in my opinion, the true successor to \\"Ocean Eyes.\\" That isn't to say that \\"All Things...\\" is a failure as a successor.  It just feels like Midsummer is a better follow-up to the success that \\"Ocean Eyes\\" had.  There are less style/rhythm changes between songs, which makes it easier to adapt to the different beats and mood.<br /><br />As for the songs themselves, it is difficult to pick out a single track.  I used this album as a background melody while I was playing a game.  And after a few full-album loops, no particular song really stand out to detract me from my gaming session.  It is very rare for me to have an album like this.  The whole album has a more pop-like feel to it, despite that it still retain some of the electronica theme that defined Owl City.  Every track, except one, has an upbeat melody, including the radio hit single \\"Good Time.\\"  And they're all composed and done well to make them easy and comfortable to listen to.<br /><br />I recommend this album if you liked \\"Ocean Eyes.\\"  Even if you've never heard of Owl City, this is also not a bad album to start out with.<br /><br />Verdict: Buy it.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|The Princess and The Frog is a 2009 Disney animated feature film that is the first traditional, 2-D animated movie for Disney since 2004 and features a new addition to the Disney Princess family, Tiana, the first Black-American Disney Princess.

B005K17RU0|5.0|I love using this app to help know how to appropriately dress for the weather conditions. The option for having several locations makes it easy to keep an eye on the sky for family members living elsewhere and the 10 day outlook helps me plan ahead when scheduling events.<br /><br />I honestly don't know what I would do without it!
B007VTVGFQ|4.0|I am a Fiona Apple fan, I was listening to the streaming of this album while it was available and enjoyed all of it. To compare it to her other albums, it would most resemble Extrodinary Machine, if you enjoyed that you will enjoy this. Every single night is a good video and a great album single. If your a Fiona Apple fan, then you will enjoy the album because she sings what she feels thus her music is her. I'd tell you to get it. the extras in this package are good.
B004KRQFI0|5.0|Scary Monsters and Nice Sprites definitely met my expectations. I really like songs that go very well with my subwoofer on my stereo and this CD complements it very well. I'm not going to be hesitating any time soon about buying a couple more Skrillex CDs.
0765348276|1.0|Life in a space military thousands of years in the future, as written by John Scalzi, is as unimpressive as civilian life in here in the early 21st century for the most part. Much of the story takes place in various mess halls as character's sit around having obnoxious and mostly pointless conversations. When the action finally does come it's brief and underwhelming; the main characters shoot a few aliens and the action is over.<br /><br />As a former sailor I know military life can be dull at times but just the same I didn't want to read a novel about a bunch of space soldiers having lunch.
B0056WODZ0|5.0|A very solid start to a new paranormal romance series, and simply perfect for those who love a bad boy character. You many find the numerous creatures and magical terminology just a little confusing at the start, when a whole host of information and action is thrown at you, and the details may blur slightly. But pay attention and you'll get a handle on it all as the pace gets going at a delightful pace.<br /><br />Pia is a fearless female lead, with her conflicting emotions throughout ensuring her character has depth and substance, and Harrison presents readers with a protagonist that is incredibly well-rounded and likeable. Dragos is every feminists worst nightmare: demanding, domineering, possessive and, put simply, a time-bomb just waiting to go off. On the other hand, he is an absolute dreamboat for those who harbour caveman fantasies. The relationship that blossoms between Pia and Dragos is beautifully scripted and swoon-worthy, leading to some very steamy scenes! Get the kids to bed, curl up with a glass of wine and be prepared to be sucked into world of power, dragons and romance.<br /><br />Reviewed by Charlotte Foreman on behalf of BestChickLit.com
B005974CNA|4.0|Constantly I´ve surprised with dream theater albums, and in this case, isn´t different.<br />With the exception of drums, the other instruments (guitar, bass and keyboards) continues intricated. The Labrie´s vocals have many variations and his intepretations are (always) very dramatic.<br />But the drums (maybe due to Mangini join the band after the album composition?), in comparison with other albums, had simple (attention: to the DT standards!!) arrangements. Mangini is a exceptional drummer and I believe that in the next DT album he´ll show us much more than in \\"a dramatic turn of events\\".<br />My evaluation: 9,0
B008KL2ITW|5.0|This is a real gem of a book. The `will they, won't they' element to the plot is well written and you'll find yourself sucked into the complex workings of Abby and Travis's relationship. The plot never strays far from the main characters, concentrating on their confusing and conflicting feelings - which is a definite plus as both possess a real likeability factor.<br /><br />You'll be rooting for them all the way through, even if the plot is fairly predictable. In a nutshell, this book gives some serious drama and some serious romance, making for a great read - it's certainly no disaster.<br /><br />Reviewed by Charlotte Foreman on behalf of Bestchicklit.com
B004I744AS|5.0|This app is awesome for people who like to learn random bits of information. It has hangman,  word/quote/article of the day, etc... Also very abundant supply of words, the best dictionary I've ever used!
B0064BWE8U|5.0|Three words describe this book: fabulous, hilarious and addictive. Back with a bang, Kinsella has given her fans a real cracker of a book that they will devour and rave about. Great storyline with more than a few laugh out loud moments provided by Poppy, the awesome main character, with Sam being a great contrast with his clinical and business-like attitude.<br /><br />The pace is constant, with the story flowing nicely and a few twists you won't see coming. I've Got Your Number literally doesn't have a single dull moment. Read it immediately.<br /><br />Reviewed by Charlotte Foreman on behalf of Bestchicklit.com
0307341550|4.0|How much was I sucked into this book? I was reading it every moment I could--while making dinner, in the bathroom, sitting on the couch next to my kids hoping they couldn't see some of the words--hell, I would have read it while driving and sleeping if I could. I recently read Gone Girl and loved that, but didn't even know this was the same author until someone told me. This book does have some of the same creepiness as Gone Girl, but WAYYY amped up. It's like a cross between Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl and true-life serial killer books....I didn't want it to end. (Some friends have said they didn't like the main character at all, but I found her kind of like Tony Soprano or Liz Salander in Dragon Tattoo--I wouldn't want to hang with her, but I didn't dislike her.)Would give it 4.5 if that were an option - the ending had some dissatisfactory elements and part of me feels that 5 should only go to \\"literature.\\"
0307279189|5.0|This book, while covering the subject of running, isn't really about running as much as it is about life.  Oh, it covers the subject of many of the great runners in the world, with a focus on the inhabitants of Copper Canyon; but it's really a story - about man and his need to run.  You're going to meet some interesting, but very real, characters and feel like you've been there with them when you finish reading.  You may change the way you think about running, of even of certain people.  This book run the gamut, while being so interesting that it's hard to set it down.  The author does a masterful job of making this both informative and engaging.  I heartily recommend this book, so much so that I purchased an additional copy to pass along to my daughter and I already loaned my copy to someone else shortly after finishing.  Maybe you ought to just go ahead and buy two!
B004TTZHBK|1.0|this app was running fine and had to temporarily delete for some space. weeks later I go back to install and im able to download the install file but I have absolutely no option to install. the only app im having an issue with. using droid 2
B004J713JW|5.0|This is a great concert and a wonderful DVD.  It documents the career of Billy Joel and the timeline of Shea Stadium - both New York legends.  So fitting somehow that Billy Joel was the last great concert held in that grand stadium.  Even more fitting, perhaps, is that Sir Paul McCartney made a surprise last minute appearance, since the Beatles made their first US appearance in Shea!  This is a very enjoyable concert with great guests in addition to Billy Joel.  If you're a music fan, a baseball fan or just grew up somewhere in the 50's-70's, you'll love having this DVD in your collection!
B008TRUDAS|2.0|I was excited because the review I read said this story  was SO unpredictable, but I knew exactly what was going to happen three pages in.  So diisappointing.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|Honestly, I thought this book was great because it was fast paced and kept me interested. I liked the relationship between the main characters friends and what they had to say about it because that's how I felt throughout the whole book. I liked laughing and feeling the pain of all the characters as it was portrayed greatly throughout the book through the author.<br /><br />But, this is where I drew the line.<br /><br />The back and forth drama between Travis and Abby was borderline ridiculous and unbelievable and I just felt irritated. It came to the point where I almost wanted to just put the book down and walk away because I didn't even care what happened to the characters anymore. I also felt that some of the backgrounds given to the characters weren't really played out well to the actual characters personality.<br /><br />Travis is also very immature, like a high school kid, and gets dumb reps throughout the school because he beats people up and has sex with anything that walks and has a vagina. In that case, I looked at like he was some school bully that beat people up when they didn't like what he said. He also just got whoever he wanted and acted like a jerk throughout the whole thing. It made me feel no sympathy towards the guy EVER and had me questioning his mental stability throughout the whole book.<br /><br />Abby was no exception either. Her back and forth drama was just as annoying. Even her friend, America, agreed. Not only did her relationship with Travis ruin her friends relationship with her boyfirend, but the relationship between them all constantly. On top of that I feel as though Abby just complained a lot.<br /><br />The ending wasn't any better when the two decided to get married and be together even though thier whole relationship was emotionally abusive and destructive. They shouldn't think getting married is going to fix the problems between them. Marriage will not change anything but bind you legally; that's it. Nobody should be in a relationship like that where it makes the two damn near insane.<br /><br />I'm sorry, some might think otherwise, but I just felt that this book revolved around a very immature and destructive couple that was going nowhere and then the ending was just thrown out there randomly.<br /><br />If you think otherwise then go ahead and read the book. It's not that bad of a book, but to me it just wasn't as good as others. I have read the book many times to make sure that I really felt this way but I do.<br /><br />I don't think this is a good book for teens to read at all and I don't recommend it for anyone under the age of 20 at the least. I believe the idea it gives off is too damaging to young readers and they won't get the right idea about, not only college, but bad boys and dating in general with a relatoinship like this. This book gives off this idea that sometimes relationships like this are okay when, clearly, they are not.tionship like that where it makes the two damn near insane.<br /><br />I'm sorry, some might think otherwise, but I just felt that this book revolved around a very immature and destructive couple that was going nowhere and then the ending was just thrown out there randomly.<br /><br />If you think otherwise then go ahead and read the book.

B004Q7CIFI|5.0|It's great to have Stephen King back in form! There was a time when I thought he had gone \\"conventional\\" but this book is exceptional.

B005ZOBNOI|4.0|It was interesting, the characters were kind of quirky, but a good story about an important subject: canceer in children and how they cope.

140053271X|1.0|Originally I had liked the Nook products. Nice touch screen, easy to use, great readability. The only problem?... THEY BREAK EASILY!<br /><br />I've bought two Nooks in the past year and a half. The first one the simple touch e-reader, the second the simple touch e-reader with glow. Both of them broke within a few months of use. The first one I considered to be my fault, the second one fell and although the drop was only two and a half feet, and the nook had a case (bought from Barnes and Noble for the Nook), the screen now no longer works. The image it projects looks like shattered glass with parts of the screen changing and the rest stuck in the same image as it was when it fell.<br /><br />I told a coworker about it that day when she asked me where's my nook, since I always have it with me for breaks. She found it funny mine had broken so easily, and then gushed that her Pantech(a much cheaper e-reader from walmart) had survived falling off a second floor patio.<br /><br />I wouldn't be as mad, but when I called customer service they said they couldn't do anything because the problem hadn't been \\"internal\\". I asked to speak to the supervisor, who gave me the same song and dance as the customer rep before had done. I asked him to total up how much money I've spent on e-books in the last year and a half. It totaled up to 600 dollars. I spent about 190 or so on the simple touch since I had gotten a case and some other stuff with it. The simple touch with glow I got when first came out at 160 ordering from barnesandnoble.com. That's 960 dollars I've spent in a year and a half on books, and their customer service didn't even bother offering me a replacement or even as much as a discount on getting a new e-reader.<br /><br />I'm an avid reader and love reading in my free time, or whenever I have to wait for something. I would assume most people buying an e-reader would want to take theirs with them outside of the house. I try to take real good care of my things, but sometimes things drop. They should be able to withstand a little wear and tear without breaking. The fact my phone can withstand flying out of my hand onto concrete, while a simple e-reader can't withstand a two and a half foot drop, is ridiculous.metimes things drop.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|there are so many twists and turns in this book that, even when you think you've figured it all out, you really haven't.<br />i even cried a few times throughout this book, and, before reading the hunger games trilogy, i have never cried reading a book.<br />i love it and would read all three books again. AMAZING!
B004WR125O|1.0|The recent Onkyo Receiver I wasted $600 on, is a nightmare to figure out how to use. While it clearly says that this wireless item IS compatible only with 2011 network-capable Onkyo A/V and stereo receivers (TX-NRxx9, HT-RC3xx and TX-8050) and later, it naturally still doesn't work true to Onkyo standards.<br /><br />While the instructions appear simple, following them EXACTLY as they are written won't do any good!<br /><br />Onkyo products are are NIGHTMARE to get working and I would NEVER recommend anything made by them. It's truly amazing in itself that the ON and OFF button actually works on their hopelessly mind-numbing receivers.<br /><br />OH and I finally got this piece of CRAP to work. After dinking around with it for sometime, I started pushing all the buttons on my remote (kind of freaking out just like Clark Griswold did in Christmas Vacation). Then I pulled UWF-1 Adapter out, then shoved it back in... PULLED it back out, turned it off... turned it back on... Shoved it in, YANKED it out, shoved it back in and the PRESTO the piece of junk started working... GOOD LUCK!!!!
B005FJ7DOM|1.0|Horrible acting. Horrible plot. Horrible soundtrack. Ridiculous stuff like carving scary mean skulls onto their cool looking vampire stakes. IF YOU LIKE HOT TOPIC YOU WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE. I want my $2.99 back.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Love it! cute pix. No lost pieces.  Only downfall is 217 is the most pieces and they are small. would be hard to have more on screen tho. Works great on kindle fire!
B004HW7JHE|2.0|Definitely a lackluster season when the highlights are \\"Zou Bisou\\", Campbell's extra-marital affair ends in electroshock and a suicide in the office enveloped in a cloud of Heinz Beans and Jaguar surrounded by how far Joan went to get that partnership, capped off with a little girls first period brings mother and daughter together. Now WTF does ANY of this have to do with the agency at all? (except for them becoming EOE?) Again save your money.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This review is primarily about the Limited Edition zombie head case. The show is awesome and you probably already know that and is why you are here considering the LE version.<br /><br />This thing is top notch. I expected it to be made out of ceramic or resin. It is made out of a very lightweight plastic, but the design doesn't suffer at all because of that. If you've seen the quality of the McFarlane toys, this is equal to or even a step up in quality. It is around 80% of the size of a real head. The screwdriver acts as a lock, with one having to stick it further into the eye socket in order to open the head and expose the blu-ray discs. Very nice touch. The discs are well protected in a fairly heavy duty fold-out case. No booklets, other than advertisements, are included. The whole kit came very well protected in the box and had absolutley no damage.<br /><br />This is by far my favorite special or limited edition case of any DVD or blu ray that I own. I've grown tired of gimmick packaging over the last several years, but I'm so glad that I decided to purchase this one. I can't recommend it enough for fans of horror and/or unique cases.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Purchased it recently and have used it numerous times. I found it very easy to set up and so easy to use. It is every bit as good and better in some ways then another product I use to log on to my clients PCs. I have never set up a remote desktop before and got it up and running on the first try.

0345525558|5.0|Every few years I read a book that forces me to embrace a character so different from anyone I've ever experienced, and this is such a book.  I never wanted it to end.<br />Victoria appeared to be an emotionally impenetrable unadoptable, and unlovable foster child.  Elizabeth, her foster mother when she was ten years old, reached her thru a shared love of flowers and the meaning behind each of them.  Elizabeth's family was broken and in many ways she was like Victoria.  Approaching a situation Victoria couldn't bear, she reacted in a way a troubled ten year old might, causing a separation between her and the one person in her life who truly loved her unconditionally.<br />Diffenbaugh tells the story of Victoria when she was with Elizabeth and after she was emancipated, separately, and then merges them seamlessly.<br />Victoria's world isn't an easy one to navigate, and trust comes slowly to her.  The author makes you root for her, despite knowing her weaknesses.<br />This was an amazing first novel.  I can't wait to read more.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|love this app.great for fall to sleep.can it to my moods.plenty of choices and volume control on any one. I have fun with my compos. mixing. thanks
1451648537|4.0|I purchased this book for my husband and it appears he has really enjoyed it because he can't put it down.  Very good reviews.
B005EGXTL2|4.0|Still a great book but it's just not as good as the first one. It was more on the romance then the original concept. A serious romance at 16 is a bit hard to take...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app was quite fun to be honest. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't typically dull as a lot of combination games tend to be.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love Pinterest and I love this app. It makes browsing on Pinterest so much faster. I like that you can see the pins much better using this app than viewing on web browser.
B005QF0GIK|5.0|I absolutely adore this album.  One listen and I was hook and bought it without hesitation.  The flow is exceptional.  Definitely worth your support.<br /><br />Thanks Meshell.

B008FLYM50|5.0|My sister introduced me to Marina and I am ecstatic about her new album. Gorgeous, lush, ridiculously melodic and catchy songs.<br /><br />Valley of the Dolls, Lies, & Homewrecker are three great songs to start out with.<br /><br />Give this album a listen--you won't be disappointed!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this is a very good calculator.  it is extremely easy to use.  the number and function keys are nice and big. i strongly recommend.
B007SGM084|4.0|I admit I got sucked into the book and was terrified for Christian Gray, i knew he was headed down the suburbia path. If you can get passed the poorly written drivel and Annastasia Steeles inner goddess dance moves then perhaps you can enjoy this purely entertaining book.
B008D19WBQ|4.0|I realize many are disappointed that the episodes do not contain the extended versions of episodes, but neither are these episodes cut SYNDICATED versions, just to clear up possible misunderstandings. These are the versions that aired Thursday nights on NBC for a decade. (Example? Nick at Nite, for whatever prudish reason, ALWAYS cuts the awesome \\"You BITCH!\\" line from Chandler to Monica during the scene in TOW Phoebe's Husband in S2 where it is discovered by the gang - thanks to Monica - that Chandler has a third nipple. It *is* left intact here.)<br /><br />So, these versions *are* longer than the syndicated versions as shown on TBS and Nick at Nite, but shorter than the extended episodes found on the DVD releases, *minus* the Super-Sized episodes, which keep the longer length.<br /><br />I received the set, and the quality is absolutely stunning. Add in the hours of new bonus materials (*in addition* to the bonus materials found on the DVD sets), and it is well worth the money. Also of note, as I mentioned above, NBC used to do Super Sized episodes in the later seasons, and these *are* present in the set, meaning unedited. So there *are* some longer episodes included here, along with the original script for the episode TOW Rachel Tells Ross.<br /><br />Does it suck that the extended cuts are not used? Sure, I admit it. But I am taking Warner Brothers at its word in that the bonus scenes were not available and/or suitable for inclusion. And considering it is these versions seen in the original run, I can live with it, although I know for others, that is not the case.<br /><br />Still, for the bonus materials and picture quality alone, I think this set is definitely worth the expense.
B002BJGYUS|4.0|I really like this series, but in almost every episode, they briefly bash Republicans and Christians. For this, I reduced my rating from 5 stars to 4 stars. So I don't support left wingers, I've been buying only used DVDs and Blu-Ray discs.
B0054VVRBQ|4.0|Aside from my initial annoyance that it requires a driver install (OSX 10.6.8 - latest Snow Leopard as of this writing) in order to work, and having to dig it out of the net ( search terms: intitle:RDF1 ExpressCard Reader - Transcend Info ), you'll find that not only does it demand a reboot of your system after having installed the loadable kernel drivers (they're loadable on the fly - you don't need to reboot if the installer were to issue a kextload command for them), you get a message from the system saying that it couldn't use either component.  BUT FEAR NOT: After rebooting, it actually works.<br /><br />Insert the RDF1 card, then insert your SD card.  Both loading steps are spring-loaded, so you'll have to push against their respective springs rather than just letting them slide home.  Once the RDF1 card is in, OSX throws a PC Card icon in amongst the jumble others on the right-hand half of the menu bar.  Inserting your SD card mounts it in the Finder, and if you're an iPhoto user, that will launch.  As it's not a USB card, it will let you pull the data off of your SDHC card at an amazing rate.  Time to read an entire 8GB Class 10 card (Kingston brand) out of the built-in reader on a small video camera at a rate of about 2.9MB/s on a MacBook Pro would be almost 45 minutes.  With the RDF1, the read rate is 11.9MB/s, cutting the read time for the entire card down to just under 11 minutes.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I have been reading lots of crime/detective stories and wanted a change.  I enjoyed this story, and found it well-written.  An interesting storyline which kept me turning the pages.  A good summer book.
0547569653|4.0|A really interesting account by Scott Jurek, explaining some of the \\"how\\" and a bit of the \\"why\\" of his ultramarathon running greatness. Despite the \\"Eat\\" part of the title, the link between the vegan diet of Jurek and his immense running achievements is not clear - but his determination to run fast, to endure the incredible distances and to finish, is clearly evoked. The mental messages of his upbringing, the \\"just do it\\" of his father and the stocism of his ailing mother, appear to be big drivers in his endurance abilities - grist to the mill of the \\"great governor\\" theory of Dr Tim Noakes. If Jurek was not a physical trainer and ultramarathoner, he would certainly have been a chef - passionate about food, his recipes are descriptions of mouth-watering concoctions and an essential component of the book. What I liked most was the matter-of-fact and honest way he describes his racing and results - no bragging and with down-to-earth views on race tactics - refreshing and a real mark of his undeniable impact on the sport of ultra-trails. A book which should be read by all ultra runners; an easy read and worth every minute in the armchair rather than on the trails.
B007SGM084|5.0|I was somewhat reluctant to start reading the books, but after I saw my wife finish the first one in 2 days I thought I'd give it a try. Long story short, I finished the three books before her. Entertaining, light reading that keeps the suspense going. Reading them in my iPad was great because the author loves to remind us that one of the characters majored in English and uses some non colloquial words. Just beware, it's borderline between sensual and sexual.
B008WHTFL8|5.0|Easily the BEST LIVE BAND I've EVER seen to this point, in my entire life!!  I've seen Queen+ Paul Rodgers (Queen being my favorite band EVER), David Bowie, Cheap Trick, Journey, RUSH, KISS, Boston, Styx, Def Leppard, & sooooo many more!!  Nothing will ever compare to that night in New Orleans earlier this year!!  I'd give a month of my life to experience those 2 hours just one more time!!!  The Samsung Super Bowl commercial brought some much needed light into the very Darkness of this World!!!  I can say for 99% of The Darkness' fans, that we've been in a frenzy ever since!!  We've not been dissapointed, & have an awesome album to ROCK out too once again!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you!!!!  The entire album rocks!!  My top favorites...in no particular order!  #1) \\"Every Inch of You,\\" #2) \\"Nothing's Gonna Stop Us,\\"  #5) \\"Living Each Day Blind,\\" #6) \\"Everybody Have A Good Time,\\"  #8) \\"Forbidden Love,\\" &  #11) \\"Love Is Not The Answer.\\"  One great thing about these 'HOT CAKES.'  .....no re-heating needed!!!!  & yes please,...I'll have yet another serving!!!  *order up!*
B008VBYN80|4.0|Has a lot of potential once the community grows. Good graphics and sound and good gameplay.<br />Worth a try for SURE!
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is good but how long can slicing fruit really hold your attention? The ads can get a bit annoying at times (especially the videos). The achievements help to hold my intrest but it doesnt seem to &quot;go the whole nine yards&quot;. - 4 Stars - Good Graphics - Good Gameplay - Boring Game Modes -
B003L77GH4|5.0|The DVD came in very good condition and the price was very affordable. I really love having my own copies and I can't wait for season 4!
B008K8U13K|5.0|I have to say,at first I was very sceptical of an addition to the Sonic 2D series. However! After buying this game (For my Kindle) I am very pleased with it. It does a very good job of taking 2D Sonic to the next level, while keeping that classic feel. If you where a fan of the Sega Genesis's classic Sonic the Hedgehog, you'll be pleased with this game. (The controls can be tricky)
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I bought this book to get a headstart on the then-upcoming Longmire TV series.  And I loved it! Immediately came back to Amazon and purchased the next book in the series (which I also loved).  The characters are well developed and the story lines are interesting.  Will soon be purchasing more in this series.
B009329ZF2|5.0|Rented it...buying it!!! I'm so happy I went in with low expectations, because the SURPRISE of this movie being fantastic made it that much better! And I'll say this right up front, I thought the way they drew similarities from the board game was so clever and NOT cheesy or forced. I also think Rhianna did a great job in her role, not too over the top and actually believable as a bada$$ sailor. But what really took me in was the total respect the movie showed for veterans. I got all choked up at certain scenes (won't ruin the movie by mentioning which ones). But where some hard hearted cynic-critics will see implausibility, I saw respect...and of course friggin AWESOMENESS!!! I'm tellin yuh, if you get to the part where AC/DC starts playin and yer not like \\"Heck-friggin-yeah!\\" then you my friend are dead inside. Yup. Said it. This movie(and so many more like it) are misunderstood by movie snobs (like me, haha). Battleship reminded me that some movies are just there to be a fun ride. And that you don't get off a ride with this much action, that is actually clever, and sparks up some good old fashioned patriotism, and start saying crap like \\"Mmmmmyeeeeaaah, but that never would have happened.\\" Heck no! You fist bump somebody and get your butt back in line for another go!!! Seriously, rent this, buy this, whatever, you'll be glad you did.
B0009PAVI2|2.0|This will fit a 77m filter without case, but not a filter in a round or square plastic case. So if you're happy to have your filter in an enclosure that can let dust in at the top, and have the filter glass rub against the cloth in the case, you'll be fine with it. Not for me.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There is nothing in this book beyond the hype and the ending was inconclusive; written to sell the next book. Don't waste your money.
B007R41E8O|5.0|I really like games like this and hope more companies will continue to add more choices to the app store. It's challenging and isn't over fast. It doesn't have one hidden object room after another nor hunting the same area over and over. We'll done!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|enjoying the game. lots of fun. keeps me coming back. daughters loves it too. thanks great game very happy with the game
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Wonderful story, great characters.  Not as heavy on the \\"graphic\\" romance and honestly, the story is so good you don't miss it at all. The author did such a great job fleshing these characters and their emotions out that you find yourself attached to them and rooting for them all the way!
B0073U2FB2|5.0|Well I must admitt this is an unusal movie, better than I expected but disappointed that the ending didn't seem right. The plot is rich in the beginning but dies out along the track, Aliens incinerate people to take over the world.<br />Emile Hirsch and cast played their roles perfectly and the storyline is great, suspense and thrills are fabulous still enjoyable though so you be the judge and decide as I found it lacking in some parts. Americans and the Russians are working together is a great idea. So now I have told you some of it but there is more, that I am not telling you.<br />Check it out for yourselves sit a while and watch it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|silly fun that makes you try over &amp; over to try to improve your score. love the commentaries by the characters
B005LAIGLE|5.0|Mark Walberg makes this show stand out with plenty of action and suspense at its best, Stealing some times pays off don't get me wrong, \\"but I'll never succeed at that\\" but some people just think they can't get caught. The plot is fabulous and masterminded by, Oh no more not going to spoil a great movie by telling it all. Enjoyable fantastic and worth watching so judge for yourself. Its slightly different to the latest movies but still entertaining for all. P.S. don't forget the munchies.
B008BQLH52|5.0|My daughter talked me into watching this show at the beginning of the summer and now I'm hooked.  We watched all the Season 1 episodes and would wait eagerly for Thursday to come to see the next installment. The characters are quick, witty, and very human.  The writing here is excellent. I don't know how realistic it is to the real legal world (I've never seen lawyers who look like this or legal documents that can be read from top to bottom in 5 seconds), but the stories are intriguing and there is enough of a realistic edge to the people that they are human (even if they always look more like supermodels than real people). We are waiting impatiently for Season 3 to begin in January!
B005LAIGPA|5.0|Fabulous storyline in this movie, Alex Russell and supporting cast take it to the top. The suspense is killing as to what might happen and our imaginations run away from us in this great show, Enjoyable from beginning to end or should I say plenty of action and intrigue. Fly around with me in this special kind of movie as there is fantastic effects that make you feel involved with the actors up in the air their feelings and disappointments more to this, that meets the eye, Enjoyable facinating and worth watching. Wont say anymore might spoil it for you, sit or relax with some munchies wonderful movie I rated it A Plus.
B00881VLCE|2.0|liked until the 1st time they made changes.  I &quot;lost &quot; puzzles &amp; I can't. redownload them.  I even lost a puzzle I paid for!  The irritation isn't. worth it.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|perfect simple calc. love the % button. if you need a nice calculator without all the frills than this is the one.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The game is really fun but its SO glitchy that its hard to play and it should be easier to get animals from pets
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! it has something for everyone! and I like how each new group lets you get more points
B003SI84D6|5.0|This move made my favorite list. Great acting, and could not have been cast any better. I own this movie and when it is shown on TV I still cannot resist sitting and watching. Yes I have seen it many times but it is good every time.

B0000021S9|4.0|I first bought this as a teenager, back in the late 1970s. I was very into Chicago at the time -- this was before the band lost guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Terry Kath, who in early 1978 accidentally shot himself to death with a pistol he thought was unloaded.<br /><br />Now, keep in mind that this was in the days long before compact disc -- and also long before you could find just about anything you wanted online, because there WAS NO ONLINE. I had heard rumors that there was an album Chicago had released only in Japan, of a live performance in that country that was supposedly far superior to \\"Chicago at Carnegie Hall.\\"<br /><br />So, one fine afternoon, I walked into Caper's Corner in Kansas City, Kansas (one of the finest record stores, when those existed, in the entire country), and they had a copy on hand. It was expensive but I bought it anyway.<br /><br />What a revelation! The sound on \\"Carnegie Hall\\" had been terrible; it was excellent on this release. In addition, the band sounds more rested and thus more robust -- they had been touring relentlessly at the time \\"Carnegie Hall\\" had been recorded, but finally had taken some time to recharge the batteries, and it shows -- the horns in particular sound more muscular.<br /><br />\\"Live in Japan\\" also benefitted from the inclusion of four songs from the recently released \\"Chicago V\\" -- \\"Dialogue,\\" \\"A Hit by Varese,\\" \\"State of the Union\\" and \\"Saturday in the Park,\\" all written by keyboardist Robert Lamm. The set also included \\"Mississippi Delta City Blues,\\" a great song by Terry Kath that didn't make the cut for \\"Chicago V\\" but wound up later as the opening track on \\"Chicago XI.\\"<br /><br />\\"Live in Japan\\" featured trombonist James Pankow's seven-part suite \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon\\" that was far superior to the one on \\"Chicago at Carnegie Hall.\\"<br /><br />In essence, \\"Chicago Live in Japan\\" is analogous to Led Zeppelin's \\"How the West Was Won.\\" That is, it's a live recording that's much better than the one that was released \\"officially\\" back in the 1970s. In Zep's case, that was \\"The Song Remains the Same,\\" which was the soundtrack to their film of the same name. \\"Song\\" did not show Zeppelin at its best. \\"How the West Was Won,\\" released decades later, showed what that band really could do live. Same with \\"Chicago Live in Japan '72,\\" which was released back in the day but was very hard for fans to find.<br /><br />Sadly, the cost of obtaining \\"Chicago Live in Japan\\" now is prohibitive. There's a CD version selling for quite a bit of money here on amazon, and a 2012 remastered import that's pricy, too. I elected to buy the mp3 version, despite my dislike of the mp3 format. Meanwhile, I think I'm going to seek out a copy of the old double vinyl album.e that was released \\"officially\\" back in the 1970s.

B00006FM77|3.0|I'll say this much for \\"Chicago at Carnegie Hall\\": At least this release from the early 1970s is a real live album, as opposed to what we've been getting since the '80s and into the '90s, \\"oughts\\" and 10s. You can call live albums from these later eras \\"live\\" if you want, but many of them are notorious for being fixed and/or \\"sweetened\\" in the studio by way of overdubs to correct mistakes or, in the worst cases, entire parts added long after the \\"live\\" performance took place!<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"Chicago at Carnegie Hall\\" also is an album that falls far short of Chicago's typically high standards. It wasn't that the band could not play  live -- I've seen them in concert over the years more than once, and on good nights they're simply terrific: The horns sound rich and powerful, the rhythm section locks in tight, and the guitars and keys typically feature lots of interesting interplay. This has been true even in more recent years as personnel changes have occurred.<br /><br />But Chicago's stand at this famous venue was marred by several things. First, the horn section was definitely off its game that second week of April, 1971. Perhaps they were just tired -- Chicago toured very hard during its first few years -- or perhaps something more ominous was going on: Band members have hinted that producer James William Guercio was roaming around backstage and sometimes ONTO the stage, making critical remarks about bad sound quality and other issues, and generally undermining the entire group's confidence and performance.<br /><br />Maybe that was just sour grapes; the band made those statements years later during the promotional push for \\"Hot Streets,\\" which they'd released after breaking with Guercio (and after the death of guitarist/vocalist Terry Kath). But one thing is certain: Trombonist Jimmy Pankow was right when he said that Carnegie Hall wasn't designed for amplified music. Essentially, it's a venue built for classical music.<br /><br />So -- whatever the reason -- the sound quality on \\"Chicago at Carnegie Hall\\" is quite bad, and it may be that the horn players were overblowing, trying to compensate. But there are a lot of bum notes here, a lot of \\"clams\\" that detract from the songs.<br /><br />And the sad thing is that Chicago live could, as I've said, be so good. Personally, I've always preferred \\"Chicago Live in Japan,\\" the Japanese import the band released in that country after \\"Chicago V.\\" The sound is better and it's a much crisper, more musical perfomance throughout.<br /><br />Still, parts of \\"Carnegie Hall\\" sound great. I've always enjoyed the group's brassy, blaring \\"A Song for Richard and His Friends\\" -- an anything-but-subtle attack on the Nixon administration, which was soon to go down in the infamy of Watergate. And Kath sounds great throughout, especially on longer cuts like \\"South California Purples.\\"<br /><br />Chicago enthusiasts will want a copy of this. More casual listeners interested in a live set from the band should check out \\"Chicago Live in Japan\\" instead.ason -- the sound quality on \\"Chicago at Carnegie Hall\\" is quite bad, and it may be that the horn players were overblowing, trying to compensate.

B005HHSXP0|5.0|this book follows on seamlesly to the firsy book in the searies (hero's of olympus). as this amazing author writes more and more books his skillls are aging like fine wine (that is to say very well). he adds on thee the searies with the same intrigue, mystery and wonerful fun that made his previous books so enjoyable. i recomend this book to anyone, of any age. it is a thrilling ride that im sure you will love
B007HPO3CC|5.0|i was blown away by the packaging in which my\\" game of thrones\\" dvd set came in. it was so beautiful i almost didnt want to unwrap it. BUT!~...* I was compleatly satasfied. AND it came a week sooner than promised!
B003N7ORNI|5.0|i think that this book overshadows the percy jackson searies and dont believe the idiots that say otherwise. the switch from greek to egyptian was one that Riordan makes effortlesly. these are by far one of the three best searies books i have ever read ( the other two are harry potter and skulduggery pleasant). buy these three books and you wont regret it!
B008MEM24S|5.0|very nice game.  after I finished first time around. just had to reset and do it again. Waiting tor updates. hope they are soon
1908117230|5.0|I bought this book eventhough I know how to make french macarons already.  I just want to add it on my collections.  I truly love this book, great pictures and really have good filling recipes.<br /><br />Anyway, I can understand why the others gave it a bad reviews.  For you to actually learn how to make proper macarons, either watch a step by step video (has to be very detail), or take a class (which I did).  There's some major technique details that you have to learn, and reading a recipe online or books are not going to help.  Even when I took the class, I wasted 3 batches when I did it on my own.  And if you are seriously wants to learn, invest on a scale.  U.S. measurements aren't going to cut it.  You need to measure in grams to get an accurate results.  And from experience, Italian meringue method is better than French or Swiss meringue method.. And I agree with \\"Carmen Adorno\\".  This is a very delicate cookie so \\"Repetition\\" is the key.  I always take orders from my friends because it gives me practice.
B003CBTVNG|1.0|...and this one didn't disappoint.  Seriously, has there ever been a decent SNL movie?  Why do I keep putting myself through this torture?  The humor was brain-dead, the script was ill-conceived, and the acting was thoroughly unconvincing.  Even the sight gags and physical humor fell flat.  I'm so drained from sitting through this slop that I can't even summon the energy and wit needed to write a proper scathing review.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My first one fell apart. This one seems to be working just fine. I love my Kindle and don't know how I got along before I had it.

B008ODZEQ0|5.0|one of the best movies I have seen this year.  truly proves that taking pride in what you do results in success and practice makes perfect.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I was horrified with the ending of this book.  It started out as a good read and took a nose dive at the end.  Not worth the time to read with an ending that was just plain awful.
B0070NSPCU|4.0|The one thing that stands out the most in this book is that the storyline is compelling enough to overcome the grammatical and spelling errors. I suggest this as a good read, one that most will enjoy although some will be put off by the writers style which is unusual. He also is a bit prolific when describing things which caused me to skip over paragraphs at times. Unfortunately, I had to go back and read some of those skipped paragraphs for a missing detail that wasn't separated out from the descriptive text.
0345803507|5.0|I read all three books in 2 weeks because I could not put them down! I let my sister borrow the books and she finished them in a week (she was on vacation). I loved reading Christian and Anastasia's story and wish there were a fourth part! :)
B007SGM084|4.0|I am not going to lie, I enjoyed the first book (maybe because it was new and exciting for me?) and I liked the second but by the time I got to the third it was so repetitive that I sort of lost interest. I am going to try to get back into it but I wish the third was just more interesting...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a great game to pass time, and it makes you think. for lovers of puzzles, logic and strategy, this is the game for you. :) it keeps me up on night shift - 1 more level, 1 more level, lol. great for all ages.
B001SERO0G|5.0|An erudite autobiography where Oz pieces together the lives of those close to him;his parents, their friends and associates,various aunts and uncles and those who influenced his life. For many, they arrived in Palestine fleeing the poison of 1920-30's Europe; the determination to see the birth of the Hebrew state, the illusion that it will lead to a perfect peace and the reality of the need to fight to exist every day.<br /> In some ways,'A Tale of Love' reminds of Stephan Zweig's 'The World of Yesterday'; the story of his parents life in Vilna and Rovno;the persecutions;the fighting for independence, the struggle to survive the first few years(and thereafter). But this is also a deeply personal voyage for Oz as well. Its also one that many people will be able to connect to, such is the universiality of growing up-Oz's initial blind support of his families politics, to a rebellion against in order to establish the individual to a gradual realisation that there is no absolute in right and wrong.<br /> But it is his Mother's mental deteriation and suicide that haunts the book as it has haunted Oz. Often he begins to broach the subject, only to shy away from going any deeper and it takes the whole book for him to cover the event and try to make sense out of yet another of the senseless events of death and destruction that is the lot of the Jew. Having an idyllic life in Rovno and a love of life and learning, going eventually to Prague University, she saw everything wiped out, most brutally by fascism, but with no less zeal from Stalin's communists.Fleeing to Israel for that perfect peace that even independence and the winning of the first Arab wars couldn't ensure, coupled with the grind of everyday austerity, I feel she must have felt the futility of life.<br /> Oz's accounts of his father are also deeply moving; his quirks and frustrated ambitions, the grief Oz-like all children-bring those closest to them, this really is a book that teaches, enlightens and hits a universal chord with anyone who reads it. A really magnificent book.iversal chord with anyone who reads it. A really magnificent book.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very good book. Kept me anticipating the next chapter. Could not put it down!  I am excited to see the movie, if and when it comes out
B006LSZECO|3.0|well written novel with lots of twists and turns - Ending was lame and disappointing.  It was almost as if the author had no idea how to end it.  great read -  stupid and insulting ending.
B0086700CM|5.0|I like this game. I have not had one single problem with the app. the game works just fine for me.  love it. at first I thought  I would hate it because it just repeats it self but once u get farther and father it gets fun. :)
B008FLYM50|5.0|OK, this isn't a very critical review. I typically do not write album reviews, but just wanted to say I love this album. Especially like \\"How To Be A Heartbreaker.\\" It has a great driving beat.
B0058YPL66|5.0|I've always loved reading fairy tales, but was slightly skeptical about the idea of a fairy tale based TV series, having seen enough movies along these similar lines that only let me down by the end credits. When I first heard about \\"Once Upon A Time\\" I was only watching a few TV shows, mostly the ones on Animal Planet, since those seemed to be the only really decent programs on at the time.  Unlike other fans, I didn't watch the pilot, my parents don't have TV channels at their house and the television itself is just for movies and video games.  Instead, I watched the third episode in my dormitory on a weekend I was studying for some tests and needed a break.  Although I didn't see all of the episodes until the last day of 2011, I instantly fell in love with the show.  The writing is excellent, the characters are engaging, the costumes are beautiful, and the show itself doesn't have unnecessary profanity, violence or drama that most TV shows have.  The moment I heard that the first season of Once Upon A Time was available; I knew I had to buy it!<br />I'm greatly looking forward to watching Season 2 in my own living room on Sunday nights and hope that this series lasts for a long time.
B007M45PMU|5.0|Lovely CD, reminds me alot of early Dylan: honest, simple, creative lyrics from the heart, the songs are not too long or over done. Would love to see these guys in concert.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I really enjoy the game but money is hard to come by.  Its still fun.  The other downside is that it takes forever for the food to cook.  I still love the game, it rocks!  If you like cooking games this app is perfect for you! I highly recomend it.
B001GUXJQA|4.0|Well written and not a  predictable plot line.  Great summer read!  I will read more of this series. Harry is real character, if you are looking for the handsome romance novel hero, Harry misses the mark by a long shot.  He is crass, but real.
B002OG5GT8|4.0|I bought this little gem for my hubby as a birthday present over a year ago and he has used it every day since! I have been with him when he uses it and it works really well. He uses it to manage the MP3 audio in his truck. It allows him to adjust the volume without using the truck controls. the only thing I see as a possible draw back is that fact that it needs recharged every night. I would recommend this little gem to anyone who needs a good amp. Great product.
034580404X|1.0|This book is a carbon copy of the Twilight Series.  Christian is Edward (brooding, damaged, dangerous), Anna is Bella (brooding, boring, whiney, weak, and oblivious that everyone is in love with her and she just doesn't see it), bestie Jose/Jacob pining after Anna/Bella, the dad is a fisherman who she's close to, parents divorced, and mom is an irresponsible child!  IT'S THE SAME STORY!!  Boring, redundant, poorly written and $30 for kindle trilogy!!  Really?  For what?  Can't even give them away or loan them now.  This woman writes like an 8th grader, using a thesaurus every other page to throw a $2 word in there; while used appropriately, it's clearly gratuitous.  Three books could have been one. Anytime anything interesting is about to happen, she glazes over it and it falls on it's face with a belly flop! I can't imagine any grown woman over the age of 30 finding Anna redeeming or a heroin.  She's a child, whiney, fresh out of college and makes Editor! Ridiculous. Christian is a mentally unstable, abusive 27 year old who makes $100,000 an hour?  Really?  How dumb is that?  So worldly....at 27?  Really?  Why is some dominant jealous stalker considered hot and worthy of so much attention? They are both childishly jealous.  The author copies and pastes sex scenes over and over, a few unique ones that titilate, but again?  Is that all they do? That's all their relationship is, completely dysfunctional and creepy. \\"Stop biting your lip\\", \\"stop rolling your eyes or I'll beat you\\" (paraphrased), \\"oh, my poor 50\\", \\"the way his pants hang\\". The same phrases page after painful page! This book glorifies abuse, stalking, controlling, jealous men and weak, subserviant, idiotic women.  I'd have slugged that jerk in the second chapter. Hated it!

B0056BMK6K|2.0|This has some okay advice that might be useful for people who are very inexperienced in marketing and have little knowledge of social media.<br />This advice is easily found online for free.<br /><br />The writing advice is quite generic and a lot of this book is mostly about the author and not necessarily relevant for most people.<br /><br />He claims that his advice could be followed by anyone and will always work.<br />However this doesn't seem likely as his books are a lot less popular in the UK and he doesn't seem to have come up with anymore of these `amazing blog posts'<br />Not certain that likening your mother to a sports figure that allegedly covered up sickening crimes would work that well!<br /><br />When I first read this I thought that he must be leaving things out.<br />And indeed there is a huge omission in this book. It turns out that he has spent thousands of dollars paying for reviews. This has recently been revealed in a New York Times article.<br />How exactly is he an underdog? Surely hardly any other self published author could afford this?<br /><br />(Bought form Amazon in the UK - thought I would clarify in the unlikely event that anyone notices no verified purchase message!)

0312360258|5.0|What is the book about?<br /><br />Zoey Redbird lives in a world much like our world today, except for her, vampyres have always existed and Zoey has been chosen and marked to join the vampyres at the House of Night. The House of Night is a school for fledglings come to train to become adult vampyres, assuming you can make it through the change, which not everyone does.<br /><br />Immedietly she figures out that she isn't an ordinary fledging because her mark is colored in and exceptionally special, given to her by the Goddess Nyx. Zoey isn't the only one with exceptional power, she learns that the leader of the elite and private club, Dark Daughters, is misusing her gifts. She must look within herself and find the courage and knowledge to figure out her destiny.<br /><br />What did I think of the book?<br /><br />I read this book in one sitting. I was hooked instantly by Zoey's character and the unusual twist on the vampyre world that you won't find in any other paranormal book.<br /><br />The authors have included a lot of greek mythology which I thought gripped me into the story. I researched some of the greek names mentioned in the book and found it really brought the story together in a very unique way. The authors clearly did some research to put this book together.<br /><br />I'm already headed out to buy the second in the series, Betrayed. I hope it's as spellbinding as the first book.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I had been married for sometime now and we just did not have that spark.  I know that he had different women he flirted with but not sure how far they went.  After, I read the first book, which was out there from what I would ever do. I talked to my husband about the book 1 and some of the things that they wrote about and he was curious. So, he picked up the first book and is on the second book.  I must say, our sex life is back to the way it was when we were dating.  Our relationship outside of the bedroom has became 100% better too. \\"Life is good\\".  Even this change has made a difference in our children too.  I guess, since we are happier, they are happier too. Don't get me wrong we never fight, we were just going through the motions of life. I would recommend this book to couples that have been married for awhile and needs that spark.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this bible! If something is unclear in one version you can always check out another one. It's great. I like that it has so much diversity!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|For fan fiction, not a whole lot more to be asked. On a basic literary level, however, I'm amazed this got published.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|There will be no doubt that the band you hear is Rush, and that they still rock.<br /><br />The well-composed songs revisit familiar riffs as well as bring in new tricks including a backing symphony (how old-school is that?)  Each member demonstrates their continued unquestioned mastery of his instrument.  Neil is creatively relentless on drums, Geddy's bass rumbles throughout the tracks and emits the distinctive \\"ka-twang\\" when he goes to the high strings, and Alex precisely hits every note on various guitars, either pyrotechnic electric or calmer acoustic.  The accompanying booklet is well done, explaining the story behind each song with a paragraph of text, artwork, and full lyrics.  The sound post-production could have been better (turn up your treble some for better results), but the slightly muddled pile-up of sound is not a major detractor considering that the album's theme is of a frantic and confusing journey, not a meditation.<br /><br />This disc belongs at or near the top of any Rush collection.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|I saw a few bad reviews about this app making their kindle or droid shut down from overheating or not being able to turn on or off since they downloaded it. well surprise surprise I am experiencing quite the same.  within the past few days my kindle just shut down on me for no reason and a couple of times it froze- the screen blacked out and I couldn't even shut it down. so unfortunately I am uninstalling.<br /> and the app was inaccurate anyway. it would say 3 hours of Internet browsing left but my battery level is at 18 percent.? odd. but there are those that it works for so try it and if your kindle or droid device does weird things like the mentioned above. immediately uninstall.
B0001I562I|5.0|This movie I had watched when I was little on walt disney and had fallen in love with it. I am so glad they brought it out on dvd. it is a great story and very cute. Anyone in the family would love it.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This is my favorite show on tv along with Breaking Bad, and I hope it goes all the way to an eighth season. One thing I love about this shows format is that each season has 22 or 23 episodes and not 13 like many other shows. It keeps me reeled in and waiting to see every episode. I love the story line which keeps you guessing and don't think I could do better myself. Hands down best Science Fiction/Fantasy show to be on.
1603427244|5.0|I've collected over the years many knitting books that off-handedly say cast on or bind off with no instructions or even preferred way to do this.  This book is easy to follow, great pictures of every step, and, most importantly, gives you the pros and cons of each technique.  This book ranks as one of my top knitting reference books.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is very addictjng. a plus is you don't have to be connected to the Internet to play and collect from your village.
1843106698|5.0|This book answered my questions about people diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome, their thought processes, view of the world, behavior, etc.  It explained in a very readable way how these folks think and act.  It was very helpful as I have several family members with Asperger's Syndrome.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I think I was the only one in my group of 50 women friends who had not read this series of books, so I thought I was missing out on something. I guess the hype surrounding this book met the needs of a lot of women. It was more of the same thing and not what turns me on. Give me a good old Harlequin romance novel and it would be much more erotic
B00913DPW2|5.0|I've only been playing this game for a little while. The graphic are terrific. The music really set the mood. Playing this game at night with the lights out is scary.This game is well worth the money and it plays well on the kindle fire.
0757302661|5.0|Everyone should read this book! To me, this book is not only about birthing, it is about approach to everything in life! Like... everything depends on your mind, perspective, however you want to put it. I did have the worst birthing experience with my first one, but after reading this book, I wish I had known about this book then. One of the most painful experience could've been more comforting experience! I really found this book spritual and comforting. Thank you!!!
0345803485|1.0|**Some spoilers** As a submissive in a healthy D/s relationship, it really upsets me how James has taken BDSM and portrayed it in the negative, inaccurate light that we as a community have been trying to escape. James has done a wonderful job of convincing those who are not well-educated in our lifestyle that we are all mentally unstable and BDSM is simply abuse. Let me start by saying that in the case of this book, Christian is not a Dom. He *is* in fact unstable and has severe mommy issues. While his submissives were consenting adults and he was respectful of their limits and kept them safe, his motives were NOT that of a true Dom. His desires to engage in BDSM activities stemmed directly from his mommy issues, and this becomes VERY obvious when we discover that ALL of his subs look like her, and he admits this is on purpose as it is a way of punishing his mother. A REAL Dom, on the other hand is loving, caring, and simply seeks to connect with his/her partner on a deeper level. If you are at all interested in the true dynamics and psychology behind BDSM, I strongly recommend reading \\"BDSM The Naked Truth\\" by Dr. Charley Ferrer. But PLEASE do some research before assuming that BDSM is based in violence and abuse as that is not the case by any means. I have read far too many reviews from people who now think that. Aside from this, the plot is non-existent and the writing is terrible. Also, if you were turned on by any of the BDSM aspects of this book I would still recommend doing some research and reading some GOOD erotic literature. You might just learn something new about yourself ;)
0061091480|5.0|\\"YOUR ERRONEOUS ZONES\\" is an excellent read. This book was given to me 37 years ago when I was a young mother. It has alot of inspirational ideas on how to live your life. I believe this was the first book that Dr. Wayne Dyer wrote which he did put his heart and soul into the book. I was impressed that Dr. Dyer mother raised her children by herself which Wayne had to be in a foster care until his mother could afford to bring him home. Watching his mother's strenth in everything she did for him I believe made him the person he is today which is a very caring person. I bought this book for a friend that is having a family problem in hopes it will help to guide him in the right direction. The book made a big impression on me that has lasted for 37 years.<br />Author Gail Ackels<br />\\"GOLD IS WHERE YOU FIND IT\\"
B007MAETA8|4.0|Mayer, takes us on a journey into the depths of his heart and mind in this low tempo record. A man in deep reflection, Mayer mixes this records soulful lyrics with soft rock, country, and more contemporary melodies that make for an enjoyable, if not thought provoking musical experience. Mayer's recent life changes and his move to Montana, have no doubt influenced this record. In this Mayer's latest studio release, he does not disappoint, despite the change in musical style.<br /><br />It is difficult to compare this effort to his past works, because Mayer creates artistic compilations that are meant to stand alone; each one a chapter of his diary that is the culmination of life, sound, and literature that make up Mayer's unique brand of artistic expression.<br /><br />I think the best way to evaluate his works on a cumulative basis, would be to ask whether each work stands alone as being of the quality that we the fans have come to expect from John Mayer. When evaluating this work under this prism, we find more than we expected, and indeed something that not only stands alone, but stands out as the written journal put to music of a man in deep reflection about the purpose of life, and the experiences we have along the way.<br /><br />I highly recommend this release from John Mayer, and look forward to the next chapter in the John Mayer journey, which ironically mirrors many of our own as we travel through the maze of life.<br /><br />I give it 4/5 stars.
B005K17RU0|5.0|So far I have had no issues with this app on my kindle fire. Wish it also showed dewpoint this is what affects me most but crisp clear screens and radar still warrant a 5 star rating. love love love it. maybe others didn't have a good wi-fi connection when using this. much better than weather channel app.
0345803485|1.0|This is the worst jumble of words I have ever had the misfortune to come across. It is. Don't think I'm over-exaggerating or writing that purely for the drama, because it's absolutely, heart-crossingly, ever-ever true. It is that bad. It's so bad, in fact, that it makes me angry. True story. I am now furious that, somewhere, someone got rich off of this tripe. The world is not right.<br /><br />The book is built on the same boring, unsexy sex scene repeated over and over again, interlaced with uninteresting and lame bitching and fighting between the two main characters. The writing is scratch-your-eyes-out-appalling and the characters thinner than watered down wafers. The main character - Ana - is daft bordering on the mentally challenged, clearly anorectic and thicker than glue, and why EVERY male character in the book is lusting after her is a true mystery.<br /><br />This book reads like someone with extreme OCD telling you about their day, in excruciating detail. You just want it to stop, but it doesn't. It just plows on. And on. And on. Forever.
B002G1YPH0|3.0|Beware.  This thing is huge.  Seems heavy duty, but it didn't fit in my low-profile HTPC box.  Wish I had checked the measurements.  Live and learn.
1439102430|4.0|This is the latest Reichs book, and definitely on par with kathy's previous offerings. As a fan of her books for many many years, and several re-reads, I was not disappointed. Yes it's a little thinner than some of the previous novels, but it doesn't lack in character development, storyline, or engrossing plot.<br />A personal bone I should pick with the publishers is the linking of Kathy's books with the TV show \\"bones\\" - yes there is a relationship, but it is so tenuous from the point of view of the reader/ viewer that the TV generation may feel cheated when reading the novels. As a fanof both, I keep the two totally seperate in my head, otherwise the discontinuity would be a distraction.<br /><br />I reccomend this novel to all those fans of the books, and would suggest those new to the novels read it in view/context of the above comments regarding the TV show.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|this is the best free game I've played so far. I really like that you can still get a lot of credits without<br /> having to pay. there are in game opportunities to get the extra credits to build up your characters. it remains challenging without being frustrating.
B005HS00NW|5.0|Bought it for the first two tracks on the first disc after watching the Art of Flight and was pleasantly surprised by the rest of the track listing.  Part of my regular now.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I really like the game it is fun. it is easy to play and understand.keep up the good work. it has been easy
B005GHN2GG|5.0|I seldom give reviews unless I truly enjoyed a book, and I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  I am an avid reader and a hard-core sci fi fantasy reader.  I seldom read romance because they bore me, but once in awhile, I will give it a go.  The cover of this book caught my attention, and I like heroes who aren't made of the standard stock.  For those who complained that the romance and sex got in the way of the story, wellll.....this is a fantasy ROMANCE. There were some typos and errors that were very minor.  They don't really detract you from the story, and this is a self published book so that can definitely be overlooked.  If you are a stickler and will complain about such things then, this isn't for you.  For those who like fantasy with characters that are atypical with wit and sarcasm and don't mind reading about sex and romance, you will love this book.<br /><br />I have to point out that, some parts in the story made me laugh really hard.  It was a really fun read.  Silhara was such a badass and my favorite in this book.  I am  already recommending it to people I know.  I would purchase another book from this author.<br /><br />For 2.99, this book is so worth the money.
B0023SDPS6|4.0|I was not familiar with this series nor the television show.  I bought the book as a Kindle Daily Deal.  I thought the author was trying too hard at first, felt the writing was too glib but I kept at it and am glad I did.  The book finally began to gel and I found I really enjoyed it even though I had pretty much figured out who the killer was about 3/4 of the way in.  The characters are interesting and likable.  I recommend it.

B007XF4J66|1.0|DVD arrived in undamaged packing.  Watched while playing on fairly new Blue Ray player.  Never went for more than 3 minutes without interruption of movie by audio and/or video dropouts. So annoying that I couldn't appreciate any improvement in picture. Only good to throw away.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|As author of [[ASIN:B0082HNVAY Celtic Shores, Book 2 in the Celtic Steel Series]] I know how much research and detail goes into creating a believable work of historic medieval fantasy.

B0083GR6Y6|5.0|Didnt look very interesting at first. Kept passing over it for several months but finally decided to watch it. It ended up being a very good movie. I would definitely watch it again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As an author, I have mixed feelings about this novel. It's not exactly believable, but it WAS very entertaining, which is the prime reason we read fiction - right? Those not easily offended should be able to find something enjoyable in the story line and the interaction between the characters. It was definitely engaging and hard to put down for me. Please keep in mind it was not written by an American and there will be some slang and other grammatical issues you may find-  which are in fact NOT editing errors - just the differences in our own particular brand(s) of English. Enjoy!
B0055PGUYU|4.0|It is a great book to get to understand how we form habits and how we can change them, in our personal lives and business.
B006LSZECO|5.0|If you love psycho-thrillers, you'll love this book. Think The War of the Roses, except with a wife who is brilliant, patient, and devious and a husband who is so self-absorbed that he is caught with his pants down (literally and figuratively). The writing is superb and the plot is so masterfully crafted that it surprised me through the very last sentence.
B000002KLZ|5.0|This was a really good CD of Fleetwood Mac in concert. Do they every make a bad live performance? I don't think so and this was a great show but their great hits.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|The indie studio behind game changer FLOW, Smithsonian inductee FLOWER, and revolutionary art and audio epic JOURNEY have released their first compilation disc.  It contains tons of extras, all 3 soundtracks, tons of art work (all easily transferrable to usb drive and computer), commentaries, 3 mini games from their collaborative 24 hour game jam!...This is the full monty.  If you have never played any of these incredible little indie success stories, there is now no excuse.  It's incredible value.  It's incredible creativity. And now it can all be owned for 29.99.  One of the finest compilations, ever.
0783229372|5.0|I forgot about this classic movie from so long ago. It was a good movie then and still today thanks to some great actors like George Scott.
0783225857|5.0|This is one of the all time greatest movies.  Everyone should watch it at least once.  It deals with several issues, that all come together within the movie
B00094ARZ0|5.0|Bo was incredible in this movie. She was a beautiful then and more so now. What was this movie about I don't know but she was fun to watch.
0062206281|5.0|Even though this third entry in Zafon's Shadow of the Wind series was relatively short compared to the first two books, as far as I'm concerned it was a gem. Enjoyed being reacquainted and given more very interesting information regarding Fermin and David Sempere. I hope we won't have to wait too long for the final installment.
B007NZDES0|5.0|I haven't seen this DVD or heard the CD but I can't wait until I get the chance. Sade in concert has to be great like I've seen her years ago. I am glad you guys had it in stock.
1416972250|2.0|This is a review for all three books in the original Trilogy.  This series is very difficult for me to review, because I feel so apathetic toward it.  It is so much easier to review things I absolutely love or that I absolutely loathe. This \\"meh\\" feeling that Cassandra Clare has instilled in me is difficult to describe and pin down, but I shall try.<br /><br />I read a lot of the amazon reviews for these books before I decided to read them, mostly because I did read the first and second books of the infamous \\"Draco Trilogy\\" and, I obviously found it kind of boring since I chose to not bother with the final installment.  Many of the negative reviews focus on how derivative the Mortal Instruments series is, and I completely agree.  One minute, Harry Potter, then Buffy, then Star Wars...But this wasn't my major complaint with the series, so I will disregard how liberally Ms. Clare borrows from other fictional works.<br /><br />My other main problems with these three books were (LOTS OF SPOILERS):<br /><br />1) How cliched and one-dimensional many of the characters are, even the main characters, Clary and Jace seemed hollow to me.  It also didn't help that I found Clary slightly annoying.<br /><br />2) The uninspired plot device used to keep Clary and Jace separated for two whole books, while the author tries to build up the sexual tension and heartbreak between them.  It just got tedious and uninspiring, and I didn't care at all if they ended up together.<br /><br />3) The unbelievable dialogue.  Whereas many other reviewers commend Clare for her dialogue, most notably the snarky, funny comments from Jace, I thought the dialogue was weak.  I often found Jace's comments to be funny, but they were also completely unbelievable in context.  The characters would be facing a life or death situation, and then Jace would say something so intricately snarky that no one would ever be able to think it up in under ten minutes.  Dialogue has to sound like people talk, fast, reactionary, imperfect.  I found much of the dialogue to be extremely unrealistic for sake of a simple chuckle. I would have preferred dialogue that was more realistic and less funny.<br /><br />4) I thought that Valentine's defeat was such a cop-out on Clare's part.  How cliched can she get? (SPOILERS) Having Valentine's own pride and self-righteousness cause his downfall? Boring.<br /><br />I give two stars rather than one, because I did feel inspired to see the story to its conclusion, mostly to see if there was ever any pay-off on Clary's special abilities.<br /><br />Meh...nary, imperfect.  I found much of the dialogue to be extremely unrealistic for sake of a simple chuckle. I would have preferred dialogue that was more realistic and less funny.<br /><br />4) I thought that Valentine's defeat was such a cop-out on Clare's part.  How cliched can she get? (SPOILERS) Having Valentine's own pride and self-righteousness cause his downfall? Boring.<br /><br />I give two stars rather than one, because I did feel inspired to see the story to its conclusion, mostly to see if there was ever any pay-off on Clary's special abilities.<br /><br />Meh...
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Someone said I should check out this DVD. Wow. This is an eye opener about our food we're eating. Have a friend who eats a lot of  meat? Have them check this movie out.
0762777931|5.0|I love this book! It is so fun to read and is packed with so much information that I think it will take several reads for me to really get the whole of the information. I highly recommend this to anyone who takes their health seriously  and wants to take it to the next level! Wheat Grass Juice ROCKS!
B000002GXJ|5.0|This was a really good CD of The Eagles in concert. Do they every make a bad live performance? I don't think so and this was a great show with their great hits.
B008AVYOBC|5.0|This is a must for Bananarama fans for one thing only-that is the DVD with most of their videos.  The cd is irrelevant if you are a fan you will have them already.  Half of these songs I did not know that there were videos for.  Alot of them are cheezy by todays standards but if you were old enough to remember when MTV actually played music videos this is a must have.<br /><br />I cant wait for a new Bananarama cd with all new music!<br /><br />P.S.  Tour the U.S.A.!
0316017930|5.0|This book makes a very compelling argument that as long as you are \\"smart enough,\\" which means above average IQ but nothing extraordinary, if you are passionate enough to put in at least 10,000 hours of study or practice, you can rise to the top.  And equally importantly, if you do not put in at least 10,000 hours, you are very unlikely to be among the best at what you do.  Practice and opportunity seem to be the two biggest indicators of who will achieve the highest level of success versus who will not.<br /><br />In my personal experience, for myself and also for my dad, neither of us is particularly brilliant (but we have a lot of common sense), we both were passionate about what we did, worked extremely long hours, for many years, on our crafts (computer programming, and building a manufacturing business), and we both achieved notable success in two totally different industries.<br /><br />Highly recommended, lest your doubt for a moment that you can be successful at whatever you set your mind to.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Look at this cover!!! I love it. It is so gothic yet bright. I would have picked this book on the basis of the cover alone. As it is, I picked this book up because of all of the hype it produced. Everyone was talking about it and I just had to see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />It turns out, this novel rocked my socks off peeps. I clung to every word, trying to visualize everything that was happening. I love the world the author weaved.<br /><br />Excerpt:<br /><br />\\"This-\\" He shook his head. \\"You and me, you know it's not a good idea.\\"<br /><br />\\"If you think so, maybe you should stay away.\\"<br /><br />\\"You don't want me to,\\" he said, moving his had to mine. Every time he touched me, my stomach got all jittery.<br /><br />\\"What do you want?\\" I asked.<br /><br />\\"You,\\" he said, his expression unreadable and his voice heavy and full of what? Sadness? Regret? \\"To understand you. To know that you're safe. To not have to avoid the only person I can be myself around.\\"<br /><br />Wow, just wow. If you can't fall in love with these characters than who can you fall in love with? Sophia and Charles are so full of sexual tension together, yet the tone was light and nothing indecent.<br /><br />The book was brimming with action and supernaturalness:) I liked the concepts of the supernaturals as well as Sophia's journey as the story unfolds.<br /><br />This was a great young adult paranormal romance book. It had a little bit of everything. I for one will be looking for the sequel when it arrives. I loved The Forever Girl and give it an amazing five glittery stars!!!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I read a lot and when I say I loved this book, it means it is in a class above most of the crap out there.  I'm picky and<br />haven't found what I consider review worthy literature since I finished reading Jim Butcher's epic series.<br /><br />I don't like to give details about the book or spoilers (hate that) so let me just say I think most(if not all) of<br />you Game of Thrones fans will like this book more than a little.<br /><br />I hesitate to give reviews because everyones taste is so different and I hate to rave about<br />something and have someone else bag on it just cause they can, but this is different, we need to really<br />get on this guys band wagon so he will write more and soon please!!!!!!<br /><br />It is more than worth the money.
B0088X7YU0|5.0|I knew it would look good but the CGI is just really well done, it's very detailed and smoothly animated. Lip sync is a little stiff but it never bothered me too much. Suit designs are great, gun designs are great, ship designs are great, bug designs are great, actions scenes are solid all throughout and it gets even a little better at the end.<br /><br />Also I didn't think the film would have any sort of plot or depth, but it was nice to to be proven wrong. Not that it really complex, no not at all but it was nice to see some slight mystery and even horror moments.<br /><br />Overall the film turned out exceeding my expectations quite a bit and that's why I'm giving it 5 stars.<br /><br />One of the better action CGI movies to come out in recent years.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I've. played different versions of this game on my PC and my Blackberry.  They are all excellent.  This game is super.
B008MEM24S|1.0|I actually like the game and play it on my tablet but it won't install on my Samsung Galaxy SII.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is the most fun game since angry birds and fruit ninja. Everyone should get it its really fun you'll love it
B00756GKBA|5.0|This was a great price for a CD that would have cost me more the $16.99 if I had bought it new!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Simply - I purchased this for one purpose, to sharpen my serrated blade pocket knives and nothing else (have other sharpeners for kitchen knives, etc.).  This item works well, is compact and folds/stores away nicely.  My serrated blades are sharp again on my spyderco knife collection!  Price is great too.
B005FISBV2|1.0|As most of you know, Season 6 is ruined b/c of the unskippable trailer at the beginning showing the last 15 seconds of season 6. After doing some research and sending some emails to Showtime, this is actually the genius decision of Paramount. I have been told that they are trying to resolve this issue for future releases and hopefully a new version will be out soon. Hopefully this helps! I have pasted the email below as well.<br /><br />Response Via Email(Cameron Green) - 08/28/2012 10:51 AM<br />Thank you for reaching out to us.<br /><br />Paramount Home Entertainment is responsible for the manufacture and distribution of our Original Series DVDs. We are working together to remove that preview from future prints of the \\"Dexter\\" Season Six DVD.<br /><br />We take your comments very seriously and have passed them on to the appropriate individuals within our organization.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Showtime Customer Service<br /><br />Customer By Web Form - 08/27/2012 10:13 PM<br />Why in the world would you put the last 15 seconds of season 6 on the trailer of the season 6 blu-ray release? Not only that, but you can't even skip the trailer at all on every single disc? I get that you are trying to advertise, but why ruin the entire season for someone who has yet to watch that season? Please fix this for people who have not bought it yet. EPIC FAIL!
B005QUQP76|5.0|This mouse is superb! Totally in love with it. The precision is very accurate and runs on almost any surface. The build quality is great. It has a nice finish and I like the way the texture on the sides(grainy), as it helps me control my M60 when my hands are sweaty. The Sniper Button really helps alot in gaming. The software is intuitive and easy to use. I find this mouse a bit heavy compared to an ordinary mouse but I could always remove the weights when I want to. This mouse is very comfortable and the buttons are well placed. I highly recommend this mouse to all of my friends. Thanks Corsair!
B0014D6PCO|4.0|This a great movie that really helps start the new better batman legacy! I would recommend this movie before seeing any of the other titles in the series.
B000V8A95C|4.0|The Wicked soundtrack is GREAT!  I was hoping for more Idina Menzel, but very good music none the less.  If you like musicals, check it out!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I picked this up just as the sequel was coming out, and on the advice of a friend who has a book-review blog. It took me a little bit to get into the storyline, but I am so glad I did! I am also glad that I already had the sequel on hand to continue the story, because I enjoyed it even more.  Can't wait for the next book!
B00005B364|5.0|Great music and a great band from the seventies,they are very talented ,their music is a nice blend of rock jazz,even classical.
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|I had very, very high hopes for this film - even Roger Ebert called it \\"magnificent science-fiction\\" in his well-respected column.  I don't know where to begin in my disappointment. Just read through these \\"1 Star\\" reviews on Amazon.com. Most of them are right on - I couldn't say it any better. Personally, what bugged me the most were the characters in the film - totally boring and non-believable, a complete mis-casting. And the movie simply was not scary, not one scene!  Furthermore, all the alien monsters we've seen before in Scott's films - nothing new.  Finally, the whole premise was convoluted and nearly impossible to follow. I suspect Ridley Scott and his gang are laughing all the way to the bank on this one. They pulled off a major dupe job.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fun game.  It allows a really fun way to relax. I enjoy the puzzles. It allows me to relax and unwind.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|This game always works, is always entertaining, hard enough to keep my interest but can be beaten. New levels are fun. It has nothing in game to pay extra for. The works great on razr and galaxy tablet.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great Book.  Could not put it down. I am going to look for other books written by my new favorite author, Gillian Flynn.
1469984202|5.0|\\"Wool\\" is an amazing look into a terrifying world. The characters are rich and the world is richer. It would be an almost claustrophobic read but for the detail and dedication the author masters. I'm now a fan of Hugh Howey. Part science-fiction, part disaster movie, part drama, an all around great story.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|so easy to use. downloaded a different app on my other kindle but changed to this one. love the big numbers.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this is a great app it is so cool it tells u how many hours and mins u have until u need to plug your device in this app is awesome. PEACE
B0090EIILU|1.0|Don't waste your time and money!<br />The trailer is very promising but that's about it.<br />You can wait until its on hbo to TNT
B008MEM24S|4.0|like the game, nice spin off of where's my water. hopefully they keep updating and stay ad free. yep yep. I hate minimum word limits, I haveto have gone over 20 by now.
0061452068|1.0|When I saw the reviews for this book, I was intrigued. I believe in optimism, provided it is tempered with realism, but after checking who wrote it, I would not read this book if you paid me. He was the chairman of the Northern Rock bank in Britain which under his leadership went bankrupt to the tune of 27 BILLION POUNDs (or close to 43 BILLION, yes, $43,000,000,000 in US funds). Thousands lost their life savings. But this should have come as no surprise; as far as I can see Ridley's main qualifications for running a bank were that he once worked for the Economist magazine (as a science journalist), and, lest we forget, DADDY was chairman before him. Set a boy to do a man's job, and you get a boy doing a bad job. I suggest that at least with respect to banking, he was that worst contradiction in terms; a professional amateur.<br /><br />If Ridley had learned anything from being the head prefect in one of Britain's worst business failures, that book would have made worthwhile reading. But he does not appear to have acquired the barest modicum of humility for screwing up most spectacularly. Not at all; instead he writes a book about optimism. It is possible, who knows, that had he taken the pessimistic writing on the wall seriously in his business dealings, his bank might have seen the storm coming. Ridley's business history is a case study in why pessimism sometimes pays, that warnings of bad things coming enable us to avoid disaster.  To bury his head in the sand and write a book about optimism is Pythonesque in its hypocrisy \\"Always look of the Sunny side of life\\"
B00785P2QC|4.0|Excellent game. however the constant tapping is annoying and the fact that you have to have invester points to complete the constructions is aswell. all in all its a fun Sim city like game.
B00932A6G4|3.0|This reminded me of the \\"final fantasy spirits within\\" CG movie. I am a fan of the very first Starship Troopers movie that came out. Everything that followed that movie was very cheesy and embarrassing to watch. This was a step up for them since it wasn't a complete failure in terms of artwork and detail. There was nothing really unique about the storyline and after it was over you're left with the idea that it's once again another chapter that doesn't really get anywhere. The makeovers for the three main characters were okay, expressions were okay, animation was good, but the dialogue & acting was a bit poor. Although the artwork and CG was very good, there was nothing about it that was visually stunning. The battle scenes were kind of cool but at times it was losing my interest. It belongs with the B movies on netflix soon. You will have to screen it before letting your children watch it since it had some unnecessary nudity. The way they executed those nude scenes was very corny and stupid. Though being a fan of the orginal movie made me over look past all the negatives I had towards this movie. It entertained me but I can't say I enjoyed it enough to own it. It wasn't totally a bad movie and overall I thought it was okay. I just can't recommend it to you since there was nothing exceptionally great about it.
B0071LLHGC|5.0|A few weeks ago I purchased the ABB SUNY CD and was extremely disappointed by the poor quality. However,it did have a few \\"magic\\" moments. A week or so later, I ordered \\"The A&R Studios\\" CD - WOW - it is absolutely AMAZING! My favorite has always been \\"Live at the Fillmore East\\", but if that recording had never existed, this is definitely the next best thing! I grew up listening to the Allman Brothers and was absolutely AMAZED when I heard \\"In Memory of Elizabeth Reed\\" playing in a record store. I have worn out two vinyl copies over the years. This CD is a definite must have for an Allman Brothers fan!
B009329ZF2|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have seen in the past 10 years. The plot, acting, cinematography, music are well below average.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I read this book just so I'd know what the 'fuss'  was all about.  I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed the story and the level of writing.  I recommended it to my book club because the story lends itself to lots of discussion issues.
B00866H7SS|2.0|Yes, I read this because of the likening to Fifty Shades. No, I don't think they compare. The shallow plot and generic characters just felt like weak silhouettes of other reads. And the so-called erotica was blunt and crude - it was meant to be, I know, it just turned me off completely. Just felt like it took the whole controlling alpha male thing over the line and made Gideon seem like a big meat-head. A good match, however, for the teen-like Eva.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is the most amazing series I've read so far. I am now a big fan of hers and will continue to keep tabs on what she puts out next!!
B000E41MS6|5.0|I fell in love with Doctor Who the first time I watched it. I had actually never heard of it before and the end of the first season was a huge surprise. I did not know that the Doctor regenerates and a new actor becomes the Doctor. It is a great way to keep a series fresh and I enjoy each Doctor but for different reasons. I highly recommend this series. It is great fun to watch.
B00447L4KA|5.0|this movie is one of the greatest. it got to my house the same date as it was estimated. brand new.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I find it very easy to use with nice big numbers. and it is very handy no hard to figure out ways to use it
B007L3BMGA|2.0|I was recommended this book by a friend who loved the trilogy. I have to say i was very disappointed and that is rare for me to say about a book. The writing style and story line (actually what story line) was poor and boring. If you are interested in reading about what happens in their bedroom (and many other places) then this is the book for you, there isn't any other story line. Can't believe they could make this book into a movie, I for 1 won't be bothering with that trash. I have nothing against sex but when that's the whole story then it doesn't rate high with me. I won't be recommending this to my friends
B0034G4P1W|3.0|I was excited to see another film by the folks who did Chicken Run, but after watching the trailer I felt uncertain that it would be as good and decided not to potentially waste money seeing it in the theater.  Finally rented it yesterday once it hit DVD to give it a fair chance.  It was better than I expected from the trailer and is definitely worth watching if you're a fan of Aardman films, but found my hunch that I wouldn't find it as good as Chicken Run to be true.  I found myself chuckling or smiling a lot more than laughing out loud.  The \\"I need to be Pirate of the Year\\" plot fell short for me- I didn't care enough it to route for the characters.  However, bits like Charles Darwin's monkey, each pirate crew member's unique gags, and enough visual humor still made me feel good about watching it.  I can't say I'm dying to own the DVD, but it was fun.  Think it would appeal to kids more than adults.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I really enjoy this game as does my 8 year old son.  It is challenging and fun.  Alot like Wheres my water but we love this version even better.  The extra games are fun as well.  Cant wait for more family quality games like this one!
0307951529|5.0|I ordered this book on 7th June 2012.  After a speedy, truely inspiring read, I'll be ready to launch my new business within 3 months of placing that order, any day now.  When I ordered the book I knew I'd like to start my own business one day, but had no idea what form that business would take.  During and after reading $100 startup, the ideas came thick & fast. I narrowed down my options following the advice in the book, and now I am 100% happy and confident with my choice.  And yes the startup has cost less than $100.  [...] - Thanks Chris!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|This is a great app and well worth the price. I use it both during prayer and yoga to drown out distracting noises in my busy child-filled home and to set my mood for internal reflection. One of the best app purchases I have made.
B006VFLIYK|4.0|I thought The Innocent was a good mystery novel.  It was an easy read and a page turner but the characters were the right mix of endearing and flawed so it didn't come across as cliche or overly predictable.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A terrible book. Completely worthless and devoid of any real value. Don't waist your time or money on this trash.
B000H5U832|5.0|bought this for my 2 year old son on is birthday and we have yet to stop watching it. Absolutely loved the movie and I do as well.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I place orders almost every month through Amazon & have been very happy.  I pre-ordered the 4th season of \\"Sons of Anarchy\\" in July since I assumed it would be the best price.  It arrived yesterday -- impressed with how fast it got here since it was only released yesterday.  But I've now found out that I could of ordered it at Best Buy for $19.99 for the same exact product that I paid $39.95.  That's a HUGE difference. I could of purchased two DVDs at Best Buy for the price I paid. In fact I didn't order the Blu-Ray since it was $10.00 more.  If I had ordered thru Best Buy their Blu-Ray was only $29.95. If it would of been only a few dollars I could of been satisfied -- but not a $20.00 difference. I guess I'll have to shop around more now that Amazon charges so much more.  Which is a first.
B0009QBLA8|5.0|Film arrived on time and in great packaging. Slow paced, but Eraserhead is a great story about a man named Henry, and his wife Mary who have a premature baby together and must raise it in Henry's apartment. One of Lynch's best film, and most disturbing. A must-see for all film lovers.
B0031Y4A8U|5.0|I really can't heap any further praise on this album, since everyone else in the rock world has done so.  My high school classmates were all into Sabbath back when they were still together (late 70s, early 80s), yet I've only been a listener for maybe the past dozen or so years.<br /><br />I love the sound on this Rhino reissue, only I wish the vinyl itself were in better shape.  I'm on my second copy, which turned out to be worse than the first.  This one has side two badly off-center, and side one slightly so.  My first copy was accurate on side one, but off-center on side two...but not to this extent.  There are also some fill problems in this copy during the title track, with bits of breakup here and there which weren't on my first (returned) copy.<br /><br />Not to worry though: I contacted Rhino, and \\"Dr. Rhino\\" replied, saying that they wanted a satisfied customer and I was more than welcome to return it to them for an exchange of a better copy.  Pressing problems have been a way of life for vinyl since, well, forever, but it is nice that Rhino is standing behind their 180 gram vinyl series.<br /><br />I have also bought \\"Paranoid,\\" and it is pretty much flawless.  My one copy of Van Morrison's \\"Moondance\\" plays so quiet, you'd think you were playing the master tape.  (My other copy remains sealed...and you'll have to pry it out of my cold, dead hands!)  So overall, I'm fairly pleased with these RTI pressings of classic WEA albums.  Wish I had the budget to buy more!<br /><br />Anyway, aside from pressing problems, you can't beat the sound on this version.  It smokes the different CDs I've heard over the years.  True it's no audiophile recording, but you can really hear inside the details, and the sound is full-bodied and clean.  Excellent job by Rhino!
B007VUA7VO|3.0|this app is really helpful:) the only thing i dont like is that when im watching movies.....if i unplug my cord it turns off the movie,beeps,and enters the app.....but i like everything else.....Battery HD is reccomended....but keep ur kindle pluged in if ur watchin a movie
B006BGZJJ4|1.0|I rarely use my Kindle because it is so difficult to handle with arthritic hands, but when the cable split, exposing bare wire, I decided to go back to real books.<br /><br />Apologies!!!  I just contacted customer service via \\"chat\\" & she totally resolved my problem....a new cable is being shipped...no charge to me.<br />thank you Amazon/Kindle!
B005LAIGKU|2.0|I didn't expect very much as I took my seat for Joseph Gordon-Levitt's \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\" follow up \\"Premium Rush\\" and I wasn't surprised by it one bit. This movie is a well choreographed chase scene which last roughly 80 minutes which is told in a similar vein and style to the \\"Bourne\\" movies, but where the \\"Bourne\\" movies allow for a certain amount of unpredictability as Matt Damon or Jeremy Renner transfer from one form of escape vehicle to another, \\"Premium Rush\\" is required by default to maintain the use of Bikes as the primary mode of escape and let's face it, pretty much all the interesting tricks you can cram into this movie would only fill about 30 minutes. After a while it's just not interesting to watch someone riding a bike.<br /><br />In addition the constant use of flashbacks by the Director serve only to break the heightening tension of the chase scene robbing this movie of much of its intensity. Not even the small attempt at creating the idea of some kind of underground bike messenger counterculture, which seems like it was added as an afterthought, can humanize the characters enough for the audience to come to care for them. I recommend you rent this movie on Amazon streaming video as I highly doubt you will want to watch it over and over again.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|Rush's 2012 album CLOCKWORK ANGELS is a remarkable release by the Canadian power trio, showing that guitarist Alex Lifeson, bassist Geddy Lee and drummer Neil Peart still have an epic rock vision and drive even as they are pushing sixty. While I don't want to join in calling this the band's greatest album in 30 years as some journalists have, this is a pretty consistent and sonically impressive release that ranks highly in my Rush listening.<br /><br />From a purely musical viewpoint, this is great rock music. While Alex Lifeson is never entirely solo, his guitar does grab the spotlight at times, keeping confident even as the band brings in keyboards again (and, for the first time, string arrangements). In \\"Headlong Flight\\" the complex interplay of these three musicians harkens back to their progressive rock efforts of the Seventies. Neil Peart has stated that he considers CLOCKWORK ANGELS his greatest achievement both in terms of lyrics and drumming. The latter is a believable claim, especially as the title track, \\"Caravan\\" and \\"BU2B\\"  are fantastic showcases of his talents. Again, it's hard to believe that someone turning 60 this year can perform so energetically.<br /><br />The lyrics, however, are the one great flaw of the album. CLOCKWORK ANGELS is a science-fiction concept album of sorts, its twelve tracks meant to follow a protagonist through a strange steampunk world where electricity was never invented, everything is mechanical, and a mysterious dictator called the Watchmaker rules every aspect of existence. The plotline can be taken about as seriously as a second-rate Japanese RPG, but luckily it is fleshed out only in the booklet, while the songs themselves are abstract enough to stand apart from this story.<br /><br />But while Peart may have penned some great stuff, in choosing what to sing Geddy Lee has pared the songs down to a minimum of verses, while he repeats the choruses over and over and over again. Whether it's \\"I can't stop thinking big\\" in the opening track, \\"The lenses inside of me that paint the world black...\\" in \\"The Anarchist\\", \\"All that you can do is wish them well\\" in the penultimate track, and \\"In the fullness of time / a garden to nuture and protect\\" in the last -- just to name a few -- I grumble at the repetitiveness of the vocals in spite of the excellent music.<br /><br />Also, one might also complain about the sound quality of the CD, which is compressed to hell and tilted to the low end. However, the vinyl release of this album sounds considerably more balanced (though not as much as the epic albums of the 1970s). If you don't have a setup for vinyl, buy the CD to support the band and seek out a vinyl rip.e opening track, \\"The lenses inside of me that paint the world black...\\" in \\"The Anarchist\\", \\"All that you can do is wish them well\\" in the penultimate track, and \\"In the fullness of time / a garden to nuture and protect\\" in the last -- just to name a few -- I grumble at the repetitiveness of the vocals in spite of the excellent music.<br /><br />Also, one might also complain about the sound quality of the CD, which is compressed to hell and tilted to the low end.

B008N1LL42|3.0|If one were to judge from the previews then one would conclude that \\"Battleship\\" was a summer popcorn movie and nothing else and I'm not going to dissuade you of that belief because \\"Battleship\\" is indeed a summer popcorn movie and it functions well as one. On the surface level \\"Battleship\\" is equally good as \\"Transformers\\" and is in fact quite a bit better than \\"GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra\\" in the great lexicon of Hasbro movies.<br /><br />However there are a few bright shining moments in this movie that are worth seeing, I don't want to ruin them for you and I'm sure there are plenty of other reviewers that will happily do so, but let's just say that \\"Chicken Burrito\\" is a very good catch phrase for those that have seen this movie. In addition I was happy that Director Peter Berg took 10 or 15 minutes from the film to actually try to make the movie seem relevant to the board game. I recommend giving this movie a rent because you might find yourself pleasantly surprised like I was.

B006M4RN3U|5.0|I jumped on the fun. bandwagon after I read a Paste magazine review talking about how the band was influenced by living in Manhattan and going to see a lot of Broadway musicals. I thought \\"Now that sounds like something I would like to check out.\\" Their music is very well produced, and well, fun. You can tell by listening how much these guys enjoy making music. I listen to \\"Aim and Ignite\\" pretty much on repeat, and was quite excited to check out their next album. It does not disappoint. While I don't enjoy every song on the album, most of them are showstoppers. Well worth purchasing, especially if you've enjoyed their earlier releases.

B00000K0EA|3.0|In late 1997, expectations were sky high for \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" following the explosive success of \\"Goldeneye\\" two years before plus the added box office pressure of competing head-to-head with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's \\"Titanic.\\"  Although Pierce Brosnan's second 007 film confirms his confident presence as the 1990's James Bond, I would still venture that this film is the least satisfying of Brosnan's four-pack of Bonds (1995-2002).  I'll be brief.<br /><br />1. The Bond franchise retreads familiar ground here, as a diabolical 24-hour cable news tycoon Eliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) attempts to initiate a war between Britain and China (a mini-World War III) simply to dominate media coverage of the imminent crisis.  Between a gleeful Pryce's look-at-me-play-evil style of acting here and his constant use of a touch-pad, a terrorist stealth warship, and a slew of other clichés, \\"Tomorrow Never Dies,\\" unfortunately, becomes very much a paint-by-the-numbers adventure, especially the all-too-predictable mayhem during the extended finale aboard the warship.<br /><br />2. Despite their minimal chemistry together, I still liked Brosnan and Michelle Yeoh's performances, especially during their Vietnamese motorcycle chase scene handcuffed together.  Yet, it struck me that maybe Yeoh had some clause in her contract demanding a specific number of fight scenes, since it seemed that every five to ten minutes Wei Lin (Yeoh) has yet another obligatory solo fight scene against a horde of opponents or one where she teams up with Bond.  Again, it is a sign of paint-by-the-numbers.<br /><br />3. Paris Carver (Teri Hatcher) was a weak choice as Bond's expendable ex-love interest.  She does  okay, but some continuity for long-time Bond fans would have been cool (i.e. bring back actress Maryam d'Abo from \\"The Living Daylights\\" to show emotional repercussions from a Bond romance we've actually seen before).  Still, Brosnan's somber scene in a hotel room privately awaiting hersadistic killer's return is arguably his best of the series.<br /><br />Despite these criticisms, there are still a lot of likeable, entertaining elements in \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" from Sheryl Crow's decent title song to reliable Desmond Llewellyn's classy presence as Q, as they seamlessly enhance the sleek, high-octane style that Pierce Brosnan provides the 007 franchise.  Case in point: the remote-controlled rental car sequence involving Bond and Q is a recommended highlight, as is the subsequent demolition derby inside a German parking garage.  Yet, the script's uninspired elements (including Pryce's scenery-chewing as the devilish Carver) prove a detriment too often.  As long as you don't mind a pure formula adventure movie, \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" remains pretty good, but it should have been better.<br /><br />Rating: 7/10 stars  P.S.  The DVD features include a collection of documentaries and trailers, but clearly the making-of-documentaries are just glossy, pre-packaged ads from the time of the film's original release.
B00881VLCE|3.0|I loved this app, the selection of puzzles and, if you wanted to purchase others, they only cost $.99.  I also like that you can chose up to 216 pieces for a puzzle which increases the difficulty.  What changed my mind about this app was the fact that when it was updated automatically,  I lost all the puzzles I paid for. I have no way to re-install those puzzles and all requests for help on their Facebook page from others with the same problem have been ignored. Because of this problem and lack of support from developer, I can only give it s 3 star rating.
0345803507|5.0|Warning: This review is SPOILERY! read at your own risk.<br /><br />This book was awesome! I loved seeing all those sides of Christian sort of click together and just seeing him finally so happy was great. They were so sappily in love that I think I was jealous, lol. Just kidding... maybe :p<br />For some reasong I liked to see that even though Christian changed in many ways--for better--he was still the same person. He was still sexy, controlling and moody. And, of course, kinky. Very kinky. Oh Fifty. *smiling*<br />When halfway through the book or so, we saw that Ana was pregnant I was totally shocked! I didn't know what to think! I think the main thing was I was just as anxious and nervous to see how Christian would react. And boy did he react strongly. He completely exploded. Christian was blitzing mad and I had never seen him react so strongly or aggressively. Ever. I was taken aback and my jaw almost hit the floor. I also pitied Ana so much. It was already so difficult on her and to have Christian be so pissed and just leave her there must have been awful. It was awful. Then I forgave him because he really does care and love her, but he was just so afraid. I could sympathize with that even though he really blew the top there. Also the ending was so beautiful! I was so happy and it was just so adorable. All of it. Ana's bulging belly with her baby girl, Christian's happiness and the total bond and joy with his little boy, Teddy, that is just mini him, lol, them living in the big house and just awww!

0425263908|5.0|Very good book and well written. I wouldn't say that the story is better than 'Shades of Grey' but it is better written and more in depth. The only thing that I didn't like about the book was how the chapters seemed to end in the middle of either them talking or doing something, and starting where it left off in the next chapter. Overall, it's an excelent book and a recomended read.
B002JCSRKC|5.0|They are perfect! I LOVE them. Very comfortable, light, feet are absolutely dry. I can tuck my jeans inside them easily. Usually I wear 39 (8-9 in US), these boots are 39.5 and they are very loose. I am glad I didn't buy size n. 40.<br />yes, sometimes they seem to be not very flexble but I'm used to it already after 1-2 days and now they seem very comfortable to me. There are many rainy days in Moscow and they really help me.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Forget all the Zooey Deschanel adorkable hype that New Girl got when it first came out. The show is so much better than her just being quirky. The supporting cast is great. Max Greenfield's Schmitt is gold and Jake Johnson's Nick has many fantastic lines and observations. Throughout the first season the cast gelled the way many of the best ensembles have. If New Girl relied solely on Deschanel's personality, it would have died after a few shows. However, the rest of the cast lets her be more than just quirky and she brings out interesting traits in them as well. Bottom line: the show ended up being funny as hell.
B009329Y30|4.0|I usually find Nick Sparks stories to be pretty predictable,but I always fall prey to watching them. This one is a really good one-not one I would have spent ten dollars to see in theater but it was worth the four dollar rental and I may end up buying it. I liked it-that is all.
0765316994|3.0|I'm a huge fan of Scalzi's and enjoyed Redshirts. It's a fun read, but the \\"meta\\" premise didn't hold for me as much as I would have hoped. The problems with the meta plot seemed to be more highlighted by the 3 codas. The first 2 were good, the final coda made the book worth reading. After reading the final coda, I wished that part of the story was more fleshed out. Its a more personal take on the themes of the book and showed what was missing in the story proper.<br /><br />Redshirts is very much worth reading. It is very funny and plays with some interesting ideas. Just go in with the knowledge that Scalzi's other work is stronger and just have fun with Redshirts.

0307592731|4.0|This book affirms my belief in the healing, restorative powers of nature. The author, Cheryl Strayed, sets off on an 1100 mile hike on the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) in order to escape and work through some troubling events in her life. Her mother had died 4 years previously which had sent her on a tailspin of adultery, heroin use and generally aimless behavior. Her story is told in flashbacks as she hikes the trail. The structure works well because otherwise it would be hard to describe hiking for 8 or so hours a day and keep it interesting. She has many hardships on the trail - some unavoidable and other avoidable (like improperly fitting boots and a heavy backpack). I was impressed by her determination to continue through the pain and hardship. By the end, she seems to have worked through her personal issues and was stronger physically and emotionally.<br />I found her a little hard to relate to and she seemed to rationalize her infidelity and drug use and even suggest that it was all for the ultimate good. But the joy of reading memoirs is to get insight into different people. In addition, the book gave me insight into endurance hiking and convinced me that I never want to do it. All in all, an excellent memoir.

B000FC12L4|4.0|This is the second book in the Abhorsen trilogy and I fear it suffers from \\"second book\\" malaise just a tad. Second books of trilogies (I've found) often have the burden of conveying so much information in order to get us to the third and resolution book that they can meander a bit.<br /><br />That said, I did still enjoy this book. Lirael is a wonderful heroine, and I found her story fascinating. Sameth, the Prince, was a little less engaging, and much of the book is focused on his backstory. It is necessary, for Lirael and Sameth are... connected in a way, but with the book titled Lirael, I was slightly less compelled with Sameth's story than Lirael's.<br /><br />There is a twist in this book, which is well hidden until about 10% before it is revealed. I only knew for certain about 2% before it was confirmed, and hints were present throughout the book, but not so obvious that you'd know much in advance, which I think is a great accomplishment for a writer.<br /><br />I still highly recommend this book, but I hope that the third book will pick up the pace a bit and finish strong.

B008S4YZCO|5.0|I know you heard it before but it really is a fun ,bright ,addictive game. and yes you do run out of jewels pretty quick, but you do earn more as you play. still you can feel the need to buy something,but I didn't and it just takes time to play. and you can grind a little for money and such and you get to see others yards. the game it self has a few bugs but runs pretty good for the most part(kindle fire) and its nice eye candy on a 7&quot; screen

In my particular use case it's no trouble since the computer that this is connected to isn't used for any heavy duty typing tasks.

B0087WRGVY|4.0|Bleed & Scream is the strong new album from Swedish rock masters Eclipse following their previous album Are You Ready To Rock that received a lot of praise from the melodic rock community back in 2008. This new album takes everything they did back then and turns it all up a notch. Anyone familiar with what Erik Martensson has been doing in recent years should know what to expect - big guitars, big drums, big guitar solos, and big vocal hooks! The production is huge and the musical performances are intense. This really is a very high energy rock album that makes you want to drive fast, party hard, and headbang like it's the late 80's again. Highlights include the awesome chorus hook of the energetic opener \\"Wake Me Up\\", the massive power of \\"Bleed And Scream\\", the quality chorus hit of \\"Battlegrounds\\", the intense rock groove of \\"Take Back The Fear\\", and the emotional vocal melodies of the epic power ballad \\"About To Break\\". Despite the fact that Bleed & Scream doesn't bring anything new to melodic rock, it is still a high quality album that is essential for fans of the previous Eclipse album Are You Ready To Rock and probably also essential for fans of Whitesnake's legendary 1987 album as it has a very similar musical style but with better sound production - 4.5 stars.
B007Y7RGIG|5.0|I put this SHM SACD in the tray thinking that I will have a good release from one of rocks greatest bands of all time. I was half wrong. What i received was one of the best sounding SACDs that I own (not only SHM-SACDs). I thought that Paranoid was great but this release has that one beat. The only down side to this is that the song \\"Evil Women\\" isn't quite up to the standards of the rest of the songs as it sounds a bit muffled. Interesting that they added this song as it is not on the original CD that I have and was probably recorded at another time. As for the rest of the songs, the sound is a good as it gets from recordings this old.<br /><br />Another interesting note (and help to justify my review of the SHM-SACD Sabbath Bloody Sabbath)is that this release was transferred by the same individual who transferred SBS. That release (SBS) being a disaster so it has to have been the master tapes.<br /><br />In any event, if this is truly a limited release than it would be good to get this while you can. No telling what price this release will be when it is out of print.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|This book was really good.  From the beginning I was trying to figure it out and I just couldn't do it.  It was disturbing and suspenseful all the way through.  The author did a good job of getting you invested in the characters.  You cared what happened to them and wanted to know why it was happening.  I know a few people have said they thought the characters were weak but I didn't find that to be true.  I thought they acted appropriately for the teenagers they were.  The thing about this book though is there is really no \\"resolution\\".  The ending left me hanging and wanting more.  So don't look for a happy ending, you won't find it here.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard of this book thru a coworker. I had no idea what the book was about so I decided to purchase it and read it for myself. I must admit, I have never read anything like this before and I must say, I quite enjoyed it. The book truely goes into detail when it comes to the sex scenes but it also describes the love and need the characters have for one another. It's not until later that one begins to understand why this person is the way they are and all one can do is wish this person the best. It truely is one of a kind series. It's not for everyone, I started reading this book with an open mind and took the book for what it is. An intersting, sexy, relatable story.

B008JEJVXG|4.0|The noise du jour for the last year or so has been a mix of 4AD gothiness and early 80s alternative. A hazy, reverb-drenched nostalgia trip topped with synth patches, Fender Jazzmasters and gender neutral vocals. Production values that are a tip of the hat to Martin Hannett, and a wink and a nod to Robert Smith and the Cure's Pornography. Over the last two years there have been a steady stream of these youngsters raiding their mom and dad's record collection and finding that mom and dad were a lot cooler than they thought.<br /><br />Wild Nothing actually was in the forefront of this alternative 80s nostalgia trip. In 2010 they released the excellent Gemini, followed by the equally retro-licious Golden Haze e.p. later that year. Wild Nothing's main guy Jack Tatum took some time to come up with the follow-up LP, and it shows. Nocturne is more concise, clear-eyed and focused than any of the previous releases. He seems to have found the perfect balance between his influences and his own voice.<br /><br />'Shadow' opens the album with an airiness of a long forgotten summer dream. It brings to mind a car ride to town, sitting in the backseat of your parents' car with the radio playing something that nearly lulls you to sleep. These are 80s dreams re-invented in the age of iPads and social networks. 'Nocturne' reminds me of what Ariel Pink could do if he upgraded his recording technique a bit and stopped having the nightmares. 'Through The Glass' has a big sound with reverbed drums and vocals and a tight acoustic guitar. 'Only Heather' has a Real Estate vibe to it, with a 'beating the steering wheel' drive to it. This is a song you crank driving on the toll road cruising into Chicago for the night. 'Rheya' closes the album as the dream pop cherry on the melancholy sundae called Nocturne.<br /><br />I admit it. I'm a sucker for 80s alternative. I love it. It puts me in a happy place. The mix of melancholy moods, reminiscing about a day long gone and people that are now merely ghosts in your present that you were once close with in your past. This music is human nature, done up with a dance beat, clean guitar lines, synth melodies and a voice lost in the analog wilderness. Merchandis, Diiv, Real Estate, Frankie Rose and Craft Spells are doing it right. Wild Nothing was at the forefront of this musical renaissance, and continues to stay there with Nocturne.ely ghosts in your present that you were once close with in your past.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|The hype on the book is overkill. Book so so! Guess it just wasn't the read for me. The book was pretty self explanatory about the way it would read. Don't think I will continue reading the other two. Had to force myself to finish it. Not written very well for an educated adult reader. Really has no plot or substance that is worth the time and money. A lot more negative reviews than positive. If you want to read it borrow a copy or check it out at a library if they even have it on the shelves.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Read the book because of all the hype and was anticipating a \\"knock your socks off\\" ending and was highly disappointed. I thought it would end with a murder/suicide but just dropped the reader off the cliff with nothing. Don't even try to make this into a Lifetime movie.

B008BM9L72|2.0|Can't understand why this is so popular.  I am not adverse to a decent piece of erotica, but this, in my opinion, fails on all counts.  The underlying story is fairly basic but might be interesting to the 15-30 aged group.  The erotica component is just so repetitive it becomes quite laughable, and it takes up over 50 per cent of the book!  On the positive side - it does give some insights into the S&M culture - but how representative it is I really don't know.

B005FISBTO|5.0|The sixth season of Dexter had me at the edge of my seat-again. I had heard rumors that this season wasn't that good,  but I have to say that I enjoyed every minute of it. There are some real surprises this season, and the murders are extremely more disturbing(reminds me of the Ice Truck Killings). The guest cast fit right in with our Miami Metro Homicide Boys and Girls and thumbs up to casting Edward James Olmos and Collin Hanks-what a brilliant match up!<br /><br />The scenes with Harry and Dexter  are especially good with some being quite humorous.  I could go on but I wouldn't want to spoil the excitement that awaits you. I've read the reviews about the DVD collection and how the previews spoil the ending.<br /><br />If you don't have Showtime and haven't bought the DVD collection, or rented from Netflix yet but want to see Dexter S#6 without spoilers, do what I did. If you can, BUY SEASON SIX FROM AMAZON INSTANT VIDEO-there are NO Previews that spoil the ending and NO trailers or Showtime Self Promotion to deal with. Just 12 beautifully crafted episodes of pure Dexter and Crew. I can't wait to see what they come up with for next season.

B0079XPUOW|5.0|Amazon, thanks for the e-nudge to review this book.<br /><br />It's official, I'm a John Scalzi fanboy.  Having read, and thoroughly enjoyed, the Old Man's War series, Android Dreams, Agent to the Stars, and The God Engines I thought I had Scalzi pegged as a 'fun read' (except for The God Engines which was...different).  I downloaded the sample of Redshirts and thought it seemed kinda cute and left it at that. But I was looking for something more 'significant' to read. Weeks later, I saw a woman seemingly enthralled by Redshirts on the subway.  That seemed a bit odd given my original impression of the book.  So I thought perhaps I might be missing something.  It was still a while before I downloaded the full version of Redshirts because I was bogged down somewhere in the Pacific Ocean with Ishmael and the rest on the Pequod (I told you I was looking for something weighty).  Surviving my whaling adventure, barely, I needed something refreshing so I loaded up Redshirts.<br /><br />The book WAS a fun read. But the fun at the beginning of the book transmuted(?) to something more significant by the end of the book.  The book had an emotional 'bang' that was unsuspected and quite a treat.  This man can write.  I'm still partial to Dan Simmons for an 'emotional read'.  But John Scalzi makes me smile like Dan Simmons never has, and that makes the more powerful sections of a Scalzi book that much more of a pleasant surprise.  Dan Simmons is a great author, but jeez he's SO serious.  If you like Spider Robinson, Heinlein, and that type of writing then you should pick up Redshirts and just enjoy it.  And yes, it seems kinda pricey for a download, but I'm happy to pay the price when I consider it a personal contribution to the financial security (and continued writings) of Mr. Scalzi.  Great work, keep it up!

It is so strange that there is no connection to the characters, however, you are propeled forward to the final pages.<br /><br />I did like the book but found it way to dark to love.  There were times I just wanted the story to get somewhere and other times I could not put it down.  In the end, it was a satisfying read and I am anxious to read her other work.  I'll have to wait awhile though, it got me a little creeped out.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Leave it to Michael Mann to create classy, intelligent thrillers. At a time when most thrillers forsake characterization and genuine suspense for car chases and repetitive gun fights, it's refreshing to see directors like Mann take the action genre seriously as an art form. Mann has given us the terrific \\"Heat\\" and \\"The Insider\\"; now joining that pair is \\"Collateral\\", which ranks as Mann's third major contribution to the thriller genre.<br /><br />Set between 6:30pm to 5:40am in Los Angeles, \\"Collateral\\" stars a mesmerizing Tom Cruise as Vincent, a contract killer hired by a drug cartel to eliminate four witnesses and a prosecutor before the break of dawn. To get the job done, Vincent forces an innocent cab driver named Max (Jamie Foxx in a masterfully subtle performance) to chauffeur him on his murder spree.<br /><br />It is a stroke of genius for Mann to cast Cruise in a villainous role. Even in his best movies, there was always something bothersome about Cruise's arrogance, his amoral mechanism that can be seen in \\"Top Gun\\" and \\"A Few Good Men\\". Here, Mann skillfully uses Cruise's trademark cockiness to create a chilling character. As Vincent, Cruise reveals the nihilism and coldness in his killer, one who belittles others (particularly Foxx) for their staid but decent existence, mocking them for their inability translate their eloquence into a better life. Cruise's interplay with Foxx is the heart of the picture, especially when Cruise indirectly forces Foxx to stop lying to himself, to stop pretending to think that his temporary job is guaranteed to lead him to a future in limousine service. Foxx deservedly won the Best Supporting Actor nomination as Vincent's foil, especially in the pivotal car speeding scene where he transforms from a likable but impotent cab driver to a strong hero who rebels against Vincent's philosophies.<br /><br />The real star in \\"Collateral\\" is Los Angeles. Rarely has Los Angeles looked more decadent than in \\"Collateral\\". The helicopter shots of the roaming freeways, the skylines, the barren streets akin to a ghost town, all present Los Angeles as a city losing its way as a civilized metropolis. The scene where three coyotes cross the streets says it all: beneath the veneer of Los Angeles' civilized society lies a cold savagery that lurks behind every corner.<br /><br />And for fans hungry for some action, there are two excellent action sequences that'll whet your appetite. The first is the shootout in the nightclub where the FBI is hot on Vincent and Max's trails. The second is the climatic chase scene where Max has to save the last target from Vincent. Both action scenes are edited to achieve a relentless pace and propel narrative momentum. One minor quibble would be that Max's attempt to save the last target would be best reserved for another movie but it at least provides a chance for Max to act like a hero after being forced to become Vincent's chauffeur for the first 80-90 minutes of the movie.<br /><br />Michael Mann's \\"Collateral\\" is a beautifully crafted, terrifically acted and immensely entertaining thriller that stimulates the mind and rattles the emotion. Like \\"Heat\\", this movie rewards upon multiple viewings so anyone that missed the meanings can watch it again to find them. \\"Collateral\\" is a triumph and one of the best movies of 2004.<br /><br />Strongest recommendation.r shots of the roaming freeways, the skylines, the barren streets akin to a ghost town, all present Los Angeles as a city losing its way as a civilized metropolis.

0439023491|5.0|The second installment of the Hunger Games trilogy finds Katniss and Peeta trying to adjust to their new lives after the games.  As alluded to in the first book, the Capitol is displeased with how the previous games turned out and Katniss' momentary act of rebellion seems to have sparked off uprisings throughout Panem.  How will the Capitol take its revenge?  Making Katniss compete in another Hunger Games.  Catching Fire is a little slower than the previous book in the series, but it doesn't make it any less entertaining.  If anything, there are additional elements of suspense and mystery that make it more fun to read (at least for me).  What really happened to District 13?  Why has Katniss' Mocking Jay pin become a symbol for the rebellion?  Many questions are answered and several new ones are raised.  I can't wait to read the last book in the series.
B001TODOCM|5.0|I prefer to think of The Ninth Gate as existing in a parallel universe from The Club Dumas rather than as a rewrite. I'm a big fan of the movie but it leaves open a lot of questions that I was hoping the book might fill in. The first thing to note is that the book, `The Club Dumas', was titled as such because it's about a group of people who revere Alexander Dumas, author of The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo. The Ninth Gate doesn't so much jettison the Dumas part of the book as it effectively merges two plot threads that include separate investigations of The Book of the Nine Doors AND a previously lost original copy of Dumas's writing. The actual references to Dumas are excised but many of the events of that plot remain. As far as I can tell the only reference to Dumas that remained in the film was early on when Corso essentially steals a collection of volumes of The Count of Monte Cristo.<br /><br />It's impossible to read the book after having seen the movie and not have certain expectations. There are surprises due to the fact that many events in the movie are actually from the Dumas storyline so their conclusion differs dramatically. Standing on its own I really enjoyed the book and found it a tremendous page turner. It's smartly written and lacks the tacked on ending of the film. A lot more time is spent on characterization including Victor Fargas who is far more than the defeated book collector of the movie and Frieda Ungern (Frida Kessler in the movie) actually gets along quite well with Corso and discusses the history of The Book of the Nine Doors and the engravings at length. The book also stays more dignified than the movie. My least enjoyed section of the movie was when `The Girl' floats down the stairs near the Seine and gets into one of the most poorly choreographed fights I've ever seen. That fight does exist in the book but it's played out completely different.<br /><br />What drew me to the book is the same thing that drew me to the movie. I am fascinated by this idea of the power and mystery of centuries old books. I found it very interesting when the characters engaged in a discussion of how some old books were printed on linen paper allowing them to withstand time far better than today's wood pulp paper and for me the talk of different binding methods was fascinating. In fact one of my favorite parts of the book was when Corso meets with the Ceniza brothers and just chats about how one might go about forging a book.<br /><br />One of the staples of the stories of H.P. Lovecrafts was the idea that ancient texts could contain real power. P&eacute;rez-Reverte explores the same concept but adds in a puzzle and keeps the reader guessing. Does The Book of the Nine Doors actually have the power to summon the Devil? There is no doubt in Lovecrafts world that demons exist but P&eacute;rez-Reverte is much more coy. So does Lucas Corso raise the devil at the end of the film? I guess I'll never know. The real mystery of the film was the ending which doesn't exist in the book so in the end the book didn't really answer my questions although it delved far deeper into the symbolism of the nine engravings. The film and the book each are successful in their own medium but I have to give the nod to the book as the superior achievement.movie.

B000AMJC2K|5.0|I was going to buy other cheap desk mounts because spending 124$ on Ergotron LX is too much for my budget. This is Neo-Flex is perfect price-wise and functionality-wise. But then I thought why don't I just buy cheaper desk mounts around 25$? I wasn't comfortable spending 124$ for a desk mount. Given the quality and mobility of this Neo-Flex, I'm happy I spent 67$ on this. Ergotron LX would be an overkill for 24\\" LED slim screens (~10lbs). This arm is strong enough to support older, heavier 24\\" LCD screens. This is more than what you need if you have a standard 24\\" 1080p monitor. If you have a 27\\" the only problem you may have is that you may not be able to use portrait mode so easily. It sure can support 27\\" in landscape. If you have 27\\" heavy monitor though, I'd recommend you get the LX. I thought about buying this or other desk mounts for at least three days because this mount didn't come in black. At last, I decided I'll get this mount anyway and spray a good black paint on it. Still researching a good spray &/or if I should sand it first or just leave it gray. I'd really love a black neoflex. FYI, I'm using this arm with ASUS VS248H-P 24\\" 1080p monitor. It's a perfect combo. I feel like the mount is going to last for years.

0099908506|4.0|I will not review the book as there are excellent reviews on the internet. However, I would give 0 stars for the Publishers, Arrow Books.<br />The front cover has a photograph of a man and a woman dancing. The woman is obviously meant to be Brett but the male could be one of many men Brett is associated with. What irritates me most is that an important description about Brett is her androgynous, boyish hairstyle and her alluringly attractive nature. The blurred photograph of this edition would seem to show a woman with a full head of hair and as most of her face is in shadow, hardly a captivating sexually appealing woman.<br />Their back cover description reads:<br />\\"Jake is wildly in love with Brett Ashley,aristocratic and irresistibly beautiful, but with an abandoned, sensuous nature that she cannot change. \\" Ok so far but then \\"When the couple drifts to Spain to the dazzle of the fiesta and the heady atmosphere of the bullfight, their affair is strained by new passions, new jealousies, and Jake must finally learn that he will never possess the woman he loves.\\"<br />Warning spoilers.<br />Brett arrives in Spain sometime after Jake and with her fiance, Michael with whom she shares a bedroom. Brett then has an affair with a bullfighter, Pedro. Hardly the series of events indicated by the publisher's precis.<br />Arrow Books did not have to do much to produce this edition but the very little they did do in providing a front cover photograph and short narrative outline on the back cover was incompetent and showed no insight into one of the 20th Century Classics.

0547258305|5.0|Graceling was not at all what I expected.  I thought it would be a good fantasy with a unique story.  It was so much more than that.  (Why does it seem like I always wait the longest to read the most awesome books?)<br /><br />Katsa is not your typical heroine.  At first she is very brutal.  She is basically her uncle's hitman.  She doesn't show feelings and she is very cold.  Po is the reason all that changes.  Po is the exact opposite of Katsa.  He is warm, friendly, and kind.  Together he and Katsa make quite a team.  They were both strong and they were willing to use that strength to help the weak.  They really were great characters as were the rest.  I liked how silly Raffin was and how Bitterblue wasn't afraid to tell it like it was.  So many great characters!<br /><br />The plot was a bit slow in the beginning but that is my only complaint against Graceling!  If it hadn't been for that this book would have been perfect but I do understand that the world needed to be set up first.  Once things were set up the book really took off and I was hooked.  There were a lot of twists in this book and I was up late into the night reading.<br /><br />Overall, Graceling is one of the best fantasy novels I have ever read.  It really makes me want to read more fantasy.

0393035158|1.0|I always find it ironic in a dry humor sense when atheists such as Sam Harris speak of a brighter, new world that is free of religion and the evils that it brings with it.  We are called to do whatever is within reason to achieve this utopian vision, mostly through better scientific education; however, such a vision is chock full of the sort of faith and hope most often associated with the religions he attacks.  The main difference is that the atheist wants to see paradise on Earth through man's efforts while religious people see paradise existing beyond this lifetime and only through the grace of God.  Already you should be getting an idea why I have a problem with this work.  It becomes what it wishes to destroy, and in order to decry religion as a great evil it must ignore the scientific literature that says otherwise, which for a scientist using his every breath to praise the wonders and necessity of science seems to me more than a misdemeanor, but indeed a grave felony.<br /><br />Here's a very pragmatic example.  On an individual level, religious affiliation is a great bastion for mental and physical health to the extent that those who practice religion live longer than those who do not.  Merely believing in God and going to church will have a similar effect for your life span as not smoking or exercising, and we all know sitting in church for an hour or shaking a few hands does not count as rigorous cardio.  Now information and facts such as this are admittedly beyond Harris' scientific field, that of psychology, sociology, or anthropology depending on what is being analyzed.  Considering the argument he wishes to levy against all religions though, namely that they are destructive rather than beneficial, he is necessarily responsible for researching, addressing, and responding to such facts.  Now, one can argue about the reason why having a religious affiliation would increase one's longetivity; without an experimental set-up you will not be able to demonstrate causality, but he cannot disagree with the established fact that it has an obvious and important benefit.  The reason these facts are not brought up in his book is because hard data such as this is much harder to argue against than anecdotal evidence.  Yes, he will quote statistics here and there, I am aware of that, but he never attaches figures and data to his most important claims; religion is more harmful than atheism, and here is the research to demonstrate it.  Instead, what we get are historical horror stories and anecdotes of great evils and slaughters, arguing that they stem solely from religious belief as opposed to any other possible explanations.  If you want to see alternative explanations arise, merely mention a crime committed by a clearly atheist figure, and you will hear an immediate denial that a \\"lack of belief\\" would ever be the cause for someone doing evil.  You cannot do something in the name of a lack of belief after all, or so goes the old argument.<br /><br />Many people profess Sam Harris as a great intellectual, and I have to wonder why.  He makes such hasty generalizations and unsubstantiated claims as if they were pure gospel fact (when in fact they'll sometimes be at odds with established facts), and sadly people do not call him out for such sloppy work.  I am reminded of one of his opening vignettes about a passenger on a bus committing murder by suicide.  When you apply some skeptical consideration to his argument, it completely crumbles apart.  1. His religion is so obvious because Harris describe tenets of his religion in the story; he didn't think that would somehow affect his point?  2. This book came only 3 years after 9/11; clearly people are going to be primed to associate a \\"kamikaze\\" killer with Muslims, yet he still gave away the surprise by talking about his family's reaction to it and what his faith consisted of.  Even with 9/11 to prepare people to associate so reflexively a suicidal bombing with Muslims, he felt it necessary to elaborate on the person's religion before arguing how easy it is to box people into their religious niches.  I could go on, but this work is a poor excuse for logic, reasoning, and scientific data.  To suggest that religion is the great evil of the world when he presents this as its replacement is laughable.  Those who are all for a religion free world will eat this up without reservation, but I recommend this as an exercise for the religious.  If this is one of the great atheist thinkers of our day and this is the best he has to offer as an answer to religion we have nothing to fear.  Only our choice to not speak up against this will give it any voice because it has no new or worthwhile arguments.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was very impressed by this book. I was skeptical of it even with all of the good reviews because I couldn't really find an actual description of what the book is about. The product description is way too vague. Once I got a handle on what it was about by reading reviews, I decided to take the plunge. All these reviews have to mean something.<br /><br />I received a very engaging book told from the perspectives of a few different characters, with the story unfolding its layers the more into the book it got, teasing enough to keep wanting more but revealing enough to satiate the reader's appetite as it went through. I think that the relationships between the characters could have been better established as I had a hard time buying into the relationships and plot developments therein. However, as a whole, the plot is very smartly written and is a real page-turner.<br /><br />Here's my own plot review for anyone else who is searching for more information than the description gives:<br /><br />Wool is set in a post-apocalyptic world in which human society is huddled up in a silo, insulating itself from the barren world outside -- but also insulated from its past, with only vague recollections of a previous uprising generations ago. You first meet Sheriff Holden, who has just lost his wife after learning a secret about the silo. He begins to uncover secrets behind the silo, why its there and who is really in charge. As the story proceeds, shocking revelations are uncovered that threaten to spark another uprising.

Not tearing things down to the base detail, but allowing the work to speak for its self.

0861714911|5.0|The need for a larger anthology of the earliest extant texts attributed to the Buddha has been met by this compilation. Bhikkhu Bodhi is a Brooklyn-born monk in the Theravada tradition who has translated the Nikaya suttas. These \\"longer,\\" \\"medium-length,\\" \\"grouped\\" and \\"numbered\\" collections in the Pali dialect closer to what the Buddha had used when he orally transmitted the dharma are as far back as we can go when trying to find the \\"original\\" sayings that summed up and expanded the many teachings of the founder over four decades of preaching.<br /><br />These can be famously repetitive, astringent. This comes from their oral nature, as this aids memory and invokes its own state of reception. These formulae for repetition and recursion remain here, but modified in the middle of repeated paragraphs so the first and the last are kept full but not the intervening. It's a fair compromise for the reader, and it allows more selections to be included in this generous, sober, stolid, if sometimes daunting, collection.<br /><br />Bodhi here compiles highlights from the Nikayas. He tends towards conservative interpretations, as a monk himself seeking the early texts to put in Theravada context. He orders them into what makes sense for a student needing a way in to the vast corpus of suttas. It starts with the human condition before the teaching is heard, then moves step-by-step along as the Buddha arrives, so to speak, and the dharma unfolds and grows in complexity as the hearer advances along the path to awakening. Bodhi arranges substantial sections of the suttas so a reader can get a sense of the core teachings. He prefaces each thematic or cognitively arranged chapter with a detailed introduction and follows with endnotes. This leaves the texts themselves to be faced apart from an orientation or commentary.<br /><br />Now, unlike the shorter collections of equal value, Rupert Gethin's \\"Sayings of the Buddha\\" let alone Glenn Wallis' \\"Basic Teachings of the Buddha,\\" (both reviewed by me before I read this anthology--I'd sample these before taking on Bodhi's bigger book), Bodhi does adhere to a conventional, more obedient stance regarding the dharma. That is, as a monk, he's grounded in elucidating this dharma as not a scholarly enterprise or a linguistic exercise or a philosophical confrontation. Rather, he mixes a more devotional approach that assumes the dharma's truth-claims while inviting a reader to understand the original suttas in light of later monastic commentaries and interpretations. Wallis eschews this approach and Gethin minimizes it; Bodhi as a monk embraces the suttas within a larger framework of those Theravadin monks who have pored over the Pali texts and come to their own conclusions, as his predecessors and masters within the South Asian community. I admit I lean more towards those who challenge the texts rather than bow to them, but that may be my nature! One can't fault Bodhi for a more \\"literal' stance towards the canon, but this needs mention. He does peer beyond from the Pali to later commentaries to tackle textual cruxes and obscure passages.<br /><br />Wallis and Gethin have based some of their work on Bodhi's even if they differ from some of his choices for translation; Bodhi has pioneered anthologies aimed at a wider Western audience than professors or linguists, and for this, the affordable and handsomely designed book (as with many from Wisdom Publications) fills a space on a short shelf. Endnotes, a brief glossary, charts of where the texts fit into the canon, and a full index with italicized Pali and Sanskrit terms enhance its use. As I consult this more as a researcher than an insider, my judgment of it is aimed at a similar reader.

B001A3CP5Y|5.0|The story behind this album is as incredible and awesome as the singles in it. They reflect the best of each one of these artists. My favorite song is Handle With Care followed by End of The Line. Too bad that destiny didn't allow for a repeat.
0374214913|3.0|I enjoyed the first two-thirds of this book more than the last third. Robin Sloane did a great job of establishing the characters (everynerd Clay Jannon, manic pixie Google girl Kat, charming old Mr. Penumbra, etc.) and the setting (a dusty San Francisco bookstore, mainly). The descriptions are clever and geeky and fun.<br /><br />The plot sort of fizzled out for me, and in the end, I didn't really feel like much had happened. It's too bad, because really, up until the last third, I was planning to enthusiastically recommend this book to everyone I know. If I could, I would give it three and a half stars, but since that's not allowed, I'm rounding down. I might be interested to read more from this author, but this wasn't quite a home run.
B00005T30L|5.0|Much has been said about \\"Ghost World\\" and for some, despite the lack of \\"official\\" recognition, it borders on masterpiece. Take a young high school graduate, put her behind the<br />popcorn counter at a local movie theater, watch her \\"bungle\\" the job and fired- and realize this person strikes many of us as worthy of basing a movie around as James Bond, Jason Bourne, Julia Roberts, or any Hollywood idol. To me that is the profound attribute of this movie- reminding us of the incredible value of being simply human.<br />Many call the lead characters \\"social outcasts\\" while I tended just to see them as people- why give \\"society\\" that much credit? Are you saying it is better to be \\"one of the boys\\" than<br />being sincere to your own instincts, and letting it be? I do not draw a \\"relative merit\\" judgement between society and the lead characters- if they truely are \\"less than\\" in some way, would we love and respect this cinematic piece like we do?

B00466HNHM|1.0|The reason why I gave it a one star, it's because of the SDH (Subtitles for Deaf and Hard of Hearing). It only subtitles the dialogues. No subtitling on singings at all. That makes no sense at all. Not worth the buy if it only subtitles dialogues.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|This case is convenient and light weight.  Even tho I wish it were more sturdy, it was worth the money I paid for it.  It's a bit hard to keep it propped up while viewing videos, whoever, once you figure out a way to keep it propped there are no problems.  Over all, I like the product, but wish I had spent more for the sturdier case.
B000PY52EU|5.0|Not one of my favorites of all time, but I watched it twice. I really did like it. And I really enjoyed watching the commentary, as well. The commentary enhanced the whole package.<br />It's definitely a strange story. But, it was compelling in a down home sort of way. I bought it after reading many reviews that heralded the acting. I found that I agreed with those acting reviews. All of the actors-yes. But especially Jackson and Ricci. And especially Samuel L Jackson. Initially, I saw it as purely an exploitation movie<br />and wondered why an actor of Jackson's stature would stoop to that level. He was wonderful in a really understated manner. The movie has heart. And for all the in your face brutality, it is warm and has enormous sensitivity. It is, in my opinion, an indy that hits the mark. Because it takes place in the deep South, many social elements dictate the course of events and the sound tract reflects that locale. Thumbs up.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I enjoyed it and it is great but it ask for Facebook information and anything out in public on Facebook.
B00080Z53O|5.0|Javier Bardem is DIVINE in his role as Ramon Sampedro and is completely credible as a young man entombed in a body destroyed in a diving accident in his early twenties. Unable to move/feel his body from the neck down and bed ridden for twenty six years as the movie begins, this TRUE story tells the tale of this man trying to eek a modicum of dignity, creativity, and engagement in life while on a journey to elicit the courts to allow a compassionate, pain free euthanasia. This is an extremely complex story that encompasses family, friends, supporters and all elements that comprise over twenty eight years of living. There is much honesty, humor (believe it or not), and passion. Visually it is exquisite. The Acting is top notch. The sound tract is beautiful. You MUST meet the brilliant young director while watching the absolutely MUST see special features and commentary. Only then will you be truly able to understand what it took for Bardem to BECOME Ramon Sampedro. This is a GLORIOUS production. It is in Spanish, so there are subtitles. WOW!!!
B001O8C5KK|3.0|I have always kept well away of Butterfly performances. If one believes in the theatrical aspect of opera, as I do, then one knows that it is very difficult to find a soprano that is able to get away with, let alone excel in, portraying a fragile 15 (!!!) yr old Japanese girl. An admirable exception is the 1995 film starring Chinese soprano Ying Huang. As far as recordings go I would recommend the soundtrack of the film and of course the legendary 1966 Scotto recording. I have to admit that Angela Gheorghiu is doing very well for herself. I don't know how she does it, but she does it. She manages to convince the ROH to mount new productions for her and EMI to finance studio recordings. Despite what the artistic results may be one has to be grateful to her for this fact alone: keep operatic things going. Her voice is expressive, more so than any other soprano today, but is small in size. Against a terryfing spinto role than this one, she often sounds strained and overwhelmed by the orchestra. Jonas Kaufmann has a dark inelastic voice, usually not suited to the Italian repertoire, but here he is doing fine, because after all, he is portraying a dark character. Antonio Pappano is probably the best opera conductor we have today. He conducts the singers first and the orchestra second. But Puccini is Puccini and he cannot do miracles. There are moments, especially in the duets, that the soprano voice disappears behind the tenor and the orchestra. Reading the other reviews I find to my surprise that there are people today  who still muse over the rip-roaring Karajan conducting. Well, Karajan, very wrongly, was an orchestra conductor. He put the orchestra before the singers. That, in opera is catastrophic. In most of his recordings, the singers are not heard. I mean, who respectable opera conductor would cast Riciarelli as Turandot (!!!)? The only Karajan opera recordings that have any worth, are the ones with Callas, and only because she, at the height of her fame and powers then, would not be messed about. To sum it all up, this is an honest production of a much loved masterpiece. Artistically, it doesn't add anything to previous attempts. However, it will please the fans of the soprano and the tenor.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|We got this for our boy at birth, and within a few weeks, he could hug it to himself.  So, it was about 50 times less often that we'd have to reach over and adjust his pacifier.  The beads inside help to keep Wubba on our son's chest, even when he was very little, further reducing the amount of retrieval we had to do.  That adds up, and you can count it in whatever sanity is measured by.  The monkey is cute and soft, but very durable.  Whenever he gets grungy, he just goes in the wash with normal clothing.  I LOVE this product so much I got the Giraffe to leave at the in-laws.
B007EC6FIS|5.0|Critical reviews have been abysmal for this album - largely bashing Keane for a return to the old formula and not blazing any new trails. For fans of Keane who have simpler parameters - love of sublime melodies, infectious hooks, and great (if not literarily magniloquent) lyrics - this is great news. Keane has released an album of astonishing quality - at least 9 of the songs have transcendent melodies, the kind that you listen to one day and wake up the next humming, walking on air. I'd issue an open challenge for anyone to put in \\"On The Road\\", crank up the volume, and NOT start jumping around in sheer joy. Musical taste is innately personal, but for me, many of the songs and the lyrics were alternately evocative, joyous, wistful, uplifting. Ultimately though, the melody trumps everything - and they've simply hit the ball out of the park on that score. Magnificent!

B000BMSTMS|4.0|I have all of Korn's cd's.  Once again have to thank Jon Davis for the lyrics.  Coming undone is the best track.  The band once again thanks all of us bi-polar f-ups that our feelings are not alone in our world.  This group really has always hit on feelings of isolation and torment. I cannot think of any other band that wriites such talented lyrics.  This is a must cd for the Korn lovers out there.  Get the cd and enjoy it!  You will not be disappointed!
B005LAIHSQ|1.0|I personally was not thrilled by this film.  The acting on the part of Charlize Theron and Chris Hemsworth was quite good, but Stewart cannot act.  Frankly, she is abysmal, and cannot even deliver her lines in a way to make you feel anything towards her character other than dislike.  Stewart made this film difficult to watch at times, and to be quite honest, it is hard to believe she could ever be fairer than Theron.  Theron was amazing, and I think if they had shortened the film and found a different actress to play Snow White, it would have done much better, but overall I found so many parts of it rather dull or a let down.  I was actually just waiting for the film to be over while watching it in the theater.  There was great potential here, but it did not deliver.
1933952806|5.0|I've never written a product review before. I hate reading through reviews written by people who have just received their product and clearly don't have anything of value to say about it and by the time I get familiar with an item I don't normally care enough to go back and bother with it. I'm making an exception this time because Darrell Young's 'Mastering the Nikon D7000\\" rocks big time. It looks like a manual and it's long so it can seem a little intimidating but it's actually a lot of fun to read. Young does an exceptional job breaking things down and explaining how all the features of the D7000 work together. The D7000 has a lot of fully automatic features and it can be tempting to just turn the thing on, set those features on and take pictures you'll be happy with. Young gives you the tools to do more than that. If you're at all thinking about it and if you want to use your camera to do more than take uber point-and-shoot photos then BUY THIS BOOK! You won't regret it.

B008ODZEQ0|4.0|I was lucky enough to see this movie in theaters and I absolutely loved it.  This man has dedicated his entire life to being incredible at one thing:  sushi.  The movie, all in Japanese, takes the viewer on a journey into this man's drive and desire.  He has truly mastered the art of sushi and this movie helps most of us who will never be masters of anything see inside a person who has.  I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|I was very fortunate to have attended the \\"Grace For Drowning\\" tour show in Orlando. Having seen Porcupine Tree on their last 3 tours (including the amazingly recorded \\"Atlanta\\" \\"Fear of a Blank Planet\\" show) I knew to expect a great show, but was completly blown away! The show opened (after \\"Centopath\\", the latest Bass Communion recording, setting the mood) with the band playing behind a gauze-like curtain with video projections completely covering it. The surround sound was the best live mix I believe I've ever heard and when the curtain dropped during the 4th song, the crowd went nuts. My 23 year old daughter and one of her friends attended and after the show they both insisted on hearing all of Steven's solo work.  I won't go into details about the band, but be assured these guys are amazing musicians who helped Steven bring his solo work to the level it deserves. If this video does justice to the live show, I'm sure it will be one of the best live rock concert films ever. I pre ordered the deluxe 40 page book w/ blu ray, DVD and 2 CD recording of the complete show as soon as it was announced and will travel as far as I must to see the 2013 tour for his Alan Parson's (Dark Side of the Moon producer) produced 3rd solo recording. I can't recommend a better purchase for the money than any version of this product. YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!!

B0063GORYU|3.0|I enjoy the game but the tap feature is troublesome. The game doesn't always place the card in the most advantageous position. Sometimes the card or series of cards is needed to complete the run and, when tapped, it goes elsewhere. Except for that, I like this app.

0062124293|5.0|Caitin Moran is hilarious and insightful throughout this book.  It's definitely not an instruction manual on being a woman, but rather a funny collection of essays that look back through Caitlin's own experience of becoming a woman.  There are some very specific British references that americans may not get, but the author has included extensive footnotes.  I never felt like i didn't understand something because of a cultural reference.<br /><br />I highly recommend for anyone looking for a slightly rude and unapologetic look into one woman's experiences with womanhood.

B008E374PO|5.0|Owl Citys new music has always been fantastic, but now..FINALLY it's fantastic music with slightly more down to earth lyrics as opposed to the whimsical seemingly drug induced fantasy-like lyrics from the past. Great job!<br /><br /> After a while of listening, another thing I've found is the music, although still good,lacks that intricate, crisp sound from before...replacing it with a loud, more rock n roll type loud. I like the new lyrics, but prefer the older music that was not only more melodic, crisp and clean, but ever changing throughout the song.
0425263908|4.0|If you loved 50 Shades of Grey, then you will love this book! When I first started reading, it reminded me a lot of 50. But then, when you get a little further in, there is a twist!<br /><br />Both of these characters are f'd up! Pardon my french, but, they both have skeletons in their closets. Granted, it seems that Gideon is more screwed up than Eva but she just seems to have an easier time telling him about it.<br /><br />One thing I loved about this book was that Eva was not so quick to jump on the Gideon band wagon! She actually made him work a little for it.<br /><br />So many more questions linger in my mind and I can't wait for the next book! I want to know what is up with Gideon's family? Why does he not want Eva around them??<br /><br />All I can say is that if you are looking for your next fix after being lonely without 50, grab a copy of this book! You will love it just as much!!<br /><br />\\"B.O.B. and I have a longtime understanding - when we're done with each other, we know exactly which one of us has been used, and it isn't me.

1439190275|5.0|I lost 62.5 lbs in 5 months and brought my weight down to 167 lb running weight.  It's a great lifestyle.  The only time I got in trouble is when I slowly left it by my workaholic ways and eating junk food on long hours, and too little sleep.  It's incredibly easy to follow and stay on.  There is no calorie counting and it doesn't take long for the carb addictions disappear.  You'll be surprised how hard your body works to keep you at a healthy weight if you simply eat a diet that makes sense.  You'll even like it.<br /><br />Pull the mask of those who pretend to be educated in this area when they quote of the First Law of Thermodynamics:  \\"Energy can be changed from one form to another, but it cannot be created or destroyed.\\"  \\"A calorie is a calorie when it comes to weight loss, so it doesn't matter where it comes from.\\"  All they are doing is displaying their ignorance. When you flood your blood with too much sugar from simple carbs, your body is going to react by storing some in the liver, some in muscle, and the rest in fat cells.  Your body is not made to work with fast carbs.  It's made to break carbs down hour after hour in your digestive system.  These big rushes of insulin from fast carbs over time affects you insulin sensitivity and you pump too much insulin into your blood to store off the carbs, and your metabolism slows down to conserve energy due to low blood sugar levels.  You lose muscle.  What this all means is you can get fat on fewer carbs because you are burning less.  The same \\"professors\\" that quote the First Law of Thermodynamics never seem to know the Second Law of Thermodynamics which states: \\"In all energy exchanges, if no energy enters or leaves the system, the potential energy of the state will always be less than that of the initial state.\\"  In our case, there is an greater energy cost involved to generate what is necessary to break down more complex energy foods.  Making those chemicals and acids is not free.<br /><br />The only reasonthat Dr. Atkins could fly in the face of the \\"prestigious\\" organizations and his methods still survive to this day is because these organizations had no studies to back up their positions.  Their positions were simply logical.  \\"Eat fat and you get fat.  Eat carbs get skinny.  There is no fat on a wheat stalk.  There is more calories in fat.\\"  \\"Arteries are like pipes; cholesterol is gooey, sticky gunk. When you eat cholesterol, it winds up in your blood. If the cholesterol level in your blood gets too high, it starts caking up the pipes. Thus, if you don't want your pipes clogged, don't eat foods rich in cholesterol.\\"  The truth is, however, that there is no direct connection between the amount of cholesterol you eat and the concentration of cholesterol in your blood. In most people, eating cholesterol has little or no effect on this amount. In about 30 percent of the population, eating cholesterol does in fact increase the concentration of cholesterol in the blood -- but it increases the \\"good\\" cholesterol.  They are even backing off eggs an inch at a time.  Just like the world being flat, much was built on logic that was no more scientific than Mother Goose.  Dr. Atkins simply discovered the few real studies there were, and they ran counter to the accepted norm.  My mother was a nurse.  She often worked with cancer patients.  One of the things I noticed while growing up is that what was good for you kept changing.  \\"Eat lots of liver because it raises your blood count.\\"  \\"Eat lots of shell fish.\\"  Then it's, \\"Don't eat liver.  The liver's job is to filter and trap toxins.\\"  \\"Don't eat shell fish.  Shell fish are scavengers and filter feeders that take in heavy metals.\\"  \\"Toxins cause cancer.\\"  Thus, the medical profession was decreasing cancer patients chance for survival before.  The subject of nutrition is no different.  Understand that the average MD knows way less about nutrition than the average gym rat because the average gym rat over time has had more education and training in this area.  Gyms and Health Clubs don't post the \\"Food Guide Pyramid\\".  They've known it to be bogus for years.  You need to question what you read and hear because so much of what you read and hear has no basis in actual research.<br /><br />Some say the diet is extreme.  Not if you follow it.  An example used in one of his books is, \\"If your car is heading for the ditch, do you straighten the wheel?  Of course not!  You turn the wheel the other way until you get back where you belong, and then you straighten the wheel.\\"  The beginning part of this diet is to turn the wheel the other way to get you headed in the right direction.  This diet has been refined by Dr. Atkins over time.  He has gone to cleaner fats and added better choices in the other two food groups.  Now others have taken his mantle.<br /><br />What is extreme is starving yourself on a high carb, low protein diet.  Muscle burns calories.  High carb, low protein diets means you lose muscle, you burn fewer calories.  The muscle goes down and down and pretty soon you're eating like a bird, and you are still fat.  Long-term results are not found in the doctor's office.  A gym is one place you do find them.  The gym tells you 90% of your results will come from your diet.  You can't out exercise a bad diet.  What they promote is a diet that has no shortage of protein, and what they reduce first in the diet for fat loss is carbs, especially fast carbs, which comes from our processed food.  When you see \\"Enriched Flour\\" in the store it's because the FDA won't let them sell it unless it is enriched because they removed all of the good stuff.  The exercise part is because today our jobs don't have enough physical activity to promote reasonable muscle mass, flexibility, skeletal strength, and aerobic exercise for our heart and lungs to remain healthy.<br /><br />Don't let clueless buffoons relying on rhetoric, rehearsed mannerisms, specific attire, and letters after their name, waste any more of your time and money.  The only people with a real education are the ones that rely on their the long-term results to support their positions.  The Dr. Atkins plan is still here after 30+ years because it's basic premise was correct.  It has been nothing but refined over time.  It's opponents have become more and more feeble over time, ever more cowering into a smaller and smaller corner by ever expanding scientific evidence.
B0036T32LQ|5.0|The premiss of the movie is great. I don't want to spoil it for any one but I found it was frustratingly thrilling in a way that has you trying to figure out just how and when it all will end. It also had the bloodiness I look for in a good horror. The female lead (Australian born Melissa George) is great. She also stars in 30 Days of Night. I highly recommend this movie. I watch a lot of horror/thriller/sci-fi and this is something I have not ever seen before. Beautiful sad. I will watch this over again for sure.
B0072GPQNG|2.0|*This review contains mild spoilers* The biggest flaw of this movie is that so many characters come and go that I had a hard time feeling much of anything for them.  The first part of the story lasts the longest, but unfortunately contains, in my opinion, the poorest acting--Jeremy Irvine playing the main (human)character. He has a primary expression that he uses over and over again, he seems overly earnest and naive, and I never quite felt the feeling that he had for his horse. David Thewlis is a hoot as the landlord and it is a treat to see several other well known British/Irish actors.  Their parts,however,are so small that they are on the screen one minute and gone the next.  Tom Hiddleston is very good as the British officer who initially buys the horse.  His voice and  facial expressions convey the fear mixed with resolve of someone who is going to battle.  Benedict Cumberbatch, Patrick Kennedy, Liam Cunningham, Julian Wadham, Eddie Marsan and Pip Torrens all make brief appearances. The other main character, of course, is the horse.  I felt for the horse in the scenes where he is overworked and in the scene where he is caught in the wire, but the shots where he is a \\"hero\\" seem a bit forced and phony.  There is one scene where a British soldier and a German soldier come together to help the horse, and this scene is very well written and performed, if you can believe that it would actually happen in the first place.  Be prepared to suspend belief for many other scenes (German soldiers who speak flawless English--to each other even!,horses who apparently calming and quietly climb stairs in a cottage, the grandfather who hears about the \\"miracle horse\\" and somehow travels many miles and has a lot of money to buy it, an untrained horse who plows a huge, rock-filled field, a girl who gallops over a hill and supposedly runs into many German troops--what she couldn't hear them on the other side of the hill?, a horse that gallops through trenches filled with men--weren't war time trenches zig-zagged, by the way?) Although some scenes where hardened soldiers feel tender toward the horses are touching, many other scenes are so overly sentimental that they are cringe worthy (they have crowds of people standing around with gaping mouths and, of course, maudlin music in the background). In the end, War Horse is an okay movie, but I would suggest renting it or checking it out of the library.  It's not really something to see over and over again.

0425263908|4.0|This is a good folow-up to 50 shades . . . .and quite a page turner to boot.<br />It is actually quite interesting to see how another author could make a rewrite of an existing book, change the location, keep the main threads of the story and still create an inovative and enjoyable story. If you have liked to follow the ups and downs of the relationship between Ana and Christian, you will enjoy the build-up between Eva and Gideon.<br />And now, I look forward to the follow-up to \\"Barred to you\\", soon to be released.
B0088X7YMS|4.0|The fact that we had to wait from 1997 ti´ll now to see a good sequel of the great movie Starship Troopers is just ridicules.<br />The first movie was awesome and left a lot of potential for a sequel but both the second and the third movie destroyed all hope and were just two big middle fingers to all the fans.<br /><br />After watching this one I feel that the Starship Troopers franchise have potential for a great comeback with some more sequels from the team that did this one. Even though its good and WAY better than the previous two, it has some flaws.<br /><br />The storyline is good but the movie is too short. To get all out of that story it would really worked better with maybe a two hour + or so so, this one feels like they rushed it.<br />The bugs looks really good except when they run, then they look stupid as Sh*t. All the characters and animation looks very good but the voice actors arent that good..<br /><br />One thing that this movie had that the previous two didnt have was some great characters. while the others had some really boring characters that didnt do anything to the storyline or so, Starship Troopers Invasion have som great characters that you can feel for while watching it, and they all do their parts! ;)<br /><br />To sum up: its a REALLY big step forward from the second and third movie, this I would really call a movie worth watching :)<br />Its entertaining with lots of action scenes, but too short. I hope only for the next movie (if there is one coming) that it will have bigger action scenes in open fields or valleys like the first one, instead of getting stuck on a starship or a spacestation like all the other ones.<br />But it feels so great to have a new great Starship Troopers movie, and I will support it and buy it.
B005F96URI|3.0|This movie began its journey slowly, making it through production but having a time of getting distribution. When it finally did, the anticipation was high. It looked so good.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the execution couldn't entirely live up to the anticipation. I won't say this is a bad movie. It was entertaining, had some nice lines and okay fight sequences. The real appeal is in watching the execution of a very eclectic and risky style of filmmaking. In attempting to pay homage while also reinterpreting the artistic and narrative style of bunraku puppetry, the filmmaker created an ambitious project. I've read complaints from viewers about the sparse, flat backgrounds of this film. I thought, given the style they attempt to emulate, they were wonderful. The pop-up book approach to transitions was executed with grace. The color palate of the film, while a bit too dichotomous for my tastes, is sharp and functional as it represents the two opposing forces (oppression and rebellion) and opposing styles of the main characters (old west and samurai).<br /><br />While the inconsistent nods to classic American musical cinema puts some people off, I found it entertaining. I don't feel it was used in sufficient amounts though. It needed to be played up more, like Kung Fu Hustle, or down into a subtle nuance of Killer #2's fighting style. As it stands, it feels uneven, most likely due to its uneven application throught the film. It is either in your face or not there at all.<br /><br />I enjoyed the acting, simplistic as it was. I don't believe that Josh Hartnett's approach to the cowboy needed a dynamic drama to him, nor did Ron Perlman's Woodcutter. I will say, however, that Woodcutter had my favorite scene in the film when he philosophizes about the need for a costume with Killer #2. The only character I felt was superfluous to the film was Demi Moore's whore, whose connection to the other characters felt forced in an effort to make THEM, not HER, feel like a more complete character.<br /><br />My biggest complaint about this movie is the pacing. It starts off quickly, slows down a lot, take a long time to tell you what you really need to know, then speeds up again at the very end. In the middle, there are moments where it feels like it is moving, but it isn't. I spent more time than I like glaring at my BD-player's counter and wondering why it wasn't further along in the film. This pacing problem needed to be solved in two ways, streamlining the script and editing the film.<br /><br />Overall, the film doesn't come across as amateurish or mundane, but neither does it approach the sublime art/action film many of us had hoped it would be. The filmmaker, Guy Moshe, is new to the game and his status as neophyte is obvious. However, one could also see his shortcomings as momentary setbacks in what could be a great career. After all, how many novice filmmakers come up with an idea this ambitious or execute it with such style?<br /><br />I recommend this film to anyone who loves experimentation in filmmaking. This experiment is not a total failure, nor is it a complete success. Some people will like it more than others. It certainly seems to polarize reviewers on other websites. This is definitely a film that I would say you need to see on your own, regardless of your tastes. There are a ton of reviews but don't let them dictate your decision to view this film. Make your own judgement.
B007STBUIW|5.0|This review isn't about the movie itself. Everyone knows that Jaws is a classic. I just want to express how impressed I am with Universal. First of all, I like how they include a Digital Copy and an UltraViolet copy. It's gives everyone what they could possibly want. Plus when I downloaded my digital copy, the HD version also downloaded. This is the first time I've downloaded a digital copy that's include the HD version of the movie. I'm starting to stream more and it's a big plus to know that Universal's Blu Rays include an HD digital copy. Lastly, the Blu Ray transfer is really good. It's almost too good because the shark looks REALLY fake now lol.
B008N1LL42|2.0|There's nothing wrong with a popcorn movie, one that doesn't require deep thought or have a profound message. But it still needs to be entertaining, engaging, and that means creating emotion. To make that kind of movie requires both the desire to do it, and an understanding of the fundamentals of storytelling and casting. This cynical piece of trash is nothing but empty gimmicks (a moving camera for virtually every shot...it's like watching a drive in movie out the window of a moving car), too-obvious and overused slow motion meant to create drama where really there is none, and an attempt to make it seem like more is happening than really with overblown orchestral music.  With the exception of one minor role, the acting is all bad, noticeably bad, which means either the producers can't cast their way out a paper bag, or more likely, they just don't give a damn. But they couldn't leave it as just their greedy grab for money by shilling an empty shell of a movie...if you know what to look for, you see elements of the agenda pushed on our country by a small ethnic minority to bring it down and keep it controlled by their outsider brethren.
0312382464|5.0|This is the second of the Welsh Princes Series. It is the story of one of England's worst kings, King Henry III, and Simon de Montford, a Frenchman who became an Earl and married the King's sister. Montfort is a principled and noble man of great courage. He almost epitomizes the legends of the chivalrous knight in shining armor while the king is portrayed as a weak, spoiled child, prone to temper tantrums. With the fate of the entire country at stake, these two men will match wits and arms.<br />Penman novels read like a major motion picture. You feel as if you are there, know the people, and share their triumphs and losses. Without giving away any spoilers, the end was sad for me but, as usual, Penman keeps to the historical record. I always feel a little sad when I come to the end of a good book and this was no exception.<br /><br />I recommend this book but not before you read the first in the series, Here Be Dragons.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Finally there is something good to play. This game is pretty fun, especially without ads! Still not the best game ever but for this time it's one of the best.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  Could not put it down.  Could not have guessed where the story was leading.  Fantastic!!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Absolutely, an amazing book. It is a must read book. It is an amazing true events as the author hiked the Pacific Crest Trail(PCT). It is an inspirational story.
B007ZZKWHY|4.0|It was fine to get the Blu-ray with the digital copy but although I own both PCs and Macs, I prefer to use iTunes for my digital copies. Unfortunately this DVD only supports a PC digital copy. They also have placed a May 13, 2013 expiration date on creating your digital copy.
B005723JSQ|5.0|This is a great book. Funny, romantic and a light read. Absolutely loved this book. Will be a book that I would re-read over and over again. :)
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Great game in the style of Alchemy but has amusing combos and comments. Also love the quotes that come up after successful combinations.
B003UYUP58|5.0|Fabulous book; the mysterious and hard to explain is expertly revealed in this  story of one of the modern world's most elusive challenges.
B005JZBP8W|2.0|So sad.  Such a great film, but I've given it such a low rating. What a disapointment  Why is the Blu-ray disc PQ so bad?  Yes, there are some well lit scenes that are outstanding, but there are many, many more shots that are dull, flat, and just plain poor picture quality. It looks like the lens was fogged or gauze was placed over the lens. This spoils the whole film.  Glad I rented and didn't buy.  I'll wait for the remastered version....
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy has received a lot of negative reviews and it is expensive so it was a hard decision for me to buy it. I realize different people have different tastes, but I LOVED this trilogy and don't regret buying it at all. It does have a lot of sex and in variety. Even if you don't like that stuff, the story is worth reading anyway. It's a great love story that has to go through a lot of struggles. Loved it and would buy it all over again.
0345803485|4.0|I liked the story of this book.  It was the first erotic romance that I read and the story had me hooked.  The writing was a little elementary, but overall, I would definitely reccomend it.  If a woman likes this book, her man will probably also benifit.
B005LAIHPE|1.0|Battleship is like a cross between Independence Day and Transformers and is not even close to being as good as either of those films. The film is probably OK for 10 - 12 year old boys, but that's about it. The actors give the impression that they are a.) reading their lines, and b.) cannot wait to be finished with the film. The plot is absurd (taking the USS Missouri out to sea and finding live WWII shells still on board). The Navy does not take boneheads off the street and make them into lieutenants, even if their older brother is a Lt. Cmdr. There are more than three officers on a destroyer, so when the CO and Exec are KIA there would be more than one officer and a handful of enlisted remaining in the crew. When a captain gives a command to a desron (destroyer squadron) he is not ordering the start of air operations. EMI sufficent to take out radar, targeting, etc., would probably also take out most of the command and control systems. There is no such thing as slingshoting radio transmissions (which by the way, are invisible). And the list goes on and on and on. Hollywood could have done much better by not making the film and giving the money to a food shelf network.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|This series was only mildly entertaining. I did not think it was written very well. The author repeated the same phrases over and over again throughout the whole 3-book series and it seemed at times she did not have a clue as to how people actually talk to one another. Some of the conversations between characters were ridiculous.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|My friend and I love the game! I love the monsters and how you can battle with them but I don't like how you can only battle every 8 hours or so. And it also can be a little slow but only when your loading it. In my opinion, you should get this app!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:)
B001VLXNLU|1.0|Okay, so when I got this book, I was really willing to accept that it was going to be a Twilight knockoff. A teen vampire book written shortly after the vampire craze began, what else could it be? But I had high hopes; maybe in THIS book, the main character wouldn't be such an ineffectual person. Maybe in this book we could actually get some decent action ALONG with the romance and sighing about pretty eyes and faces!<br /><br />Hoo boy, was I wrong. This book is what happens when you write a twilight fanfic, change all the lore because the old stuff wasn't &quot;Cool&quot; enough for you, and then decide to discard all the original characters but yours and write a book about it. The main character is one of the worst Mary Sues that I have EVER seen. EVER. Practically everything that happens to her happens essentially because of authorial fiat(because the author said so). Oh, so she's the chosen one! Oh, she's more powerful than anyone else! Oh, she has tattoos that just so happen to make her look incredibly sexy!<br /><br />But even that could be worked with if the author had bothered to give her even the faintest trace of a brain. Nah, who am I kidding? Better to have her ineffectually stumble into the final confrontation with essentially no idea of what's going on, use powers that are vaguely defined at best, and skip away spouting daisies and sunshine.<br /><br />It's not all about the Mary Sue. A Mary Sue can be brilliant if done well. But this Mary Sue is not.<br /><br />Unless you can put up with terrible, mindless writing, do not buy this book.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Very poorly written.  Too many expressions used over and over again.  Not sure I will even finish the first book.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Frame rate stutters severely at points on my razr maxx and galaxy s3.  Unplayable on my galaxy s1 (expected).  However, it plays flawlessly with no slowdown on my xoom tab, which was unexpected after its s3 performance.
B007X4ECLY|3.0|Just watched Lockout and I thought it was quite enjoyable. Don't get me wrong this is not Academy award winning material but if you like action movies...this movie does the trick. Guy Pearce really delivers some great one liners.He(Guy Pearce) reminded me of Bruce Willis and Kurt Russel in Die Hard and Escape from New York respectively.<br />So, if you are ready to suspend your beliefs and take a leap, it is what it is an action movie with some laughs thrown in for good measure. The only issue that I had was the chase scene near the beginning of the movie. The special effects were very \\"fake\\" looking. The Blu-ray looked and sounded great and with Amazon's fast delivery it was worth the purchase.<br />Don't lockout yourself of a little fun on a rainy night...watch Lockout.<br /><br />Esteve
B00005RYLE|4.0|Great movie. An interesting part of film making history. The Limited Edition pack is where it's at. Offering a little background history in a little text booklet about the Evil Dead Trilogy, great illustrations within the Book of the Dead itself, the texture of the book will send a shiver down your spine and there is a convenient pocket in the back of the book for the Evil Dead movie disc. I recommend this. It arrived within the time promised and it was repackaged in plastic and then in a box (Obviously). I can only complain about the cosmetics of the cover of the book. There were a few cracks or tears in the rubber material encasing the book cover. I would have classified it as \\"Good\\". Not \\"Very Good\\" or \\"Like New\\". I ordered \\"Like New\\" but I'm keeping the item anyway. I love it too much to get rid of it. *Gives the little Evil Book a hug* ^w^
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I read this book and got so tired towards the end of Travis being so needy and so predictable. I liked Abby's character because she was stronger and she was more mature in her choices. I thought the book kept repeating the same scenario about Travis needing Abby more and her needing her space and desire to date Parker. I stopped reading it now because I can almost predict what will happen. Of course this will be a happy ending kind of book but I think if this was real life their relationship is headed toward disaster. I'd say this book is a meh.
B0087240Z4|5.0|This is one of Smashing Pumpkins best albums. Old school Pumpkins vibe with some experimentation. I suggest this for any fan of good music.

B005LAIHPY|5.0|Awesome movie!!! Alexander Skarsgard is my fav. Great special effects! I just really enjoyed it and cant wait to buy it on blue ray!!!!!!
B0088TG252|4.0|Definitely a guy movie. My son wanted to go see it. I didnt. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. Nonstop action with a likeable ending.
B004FOA84A|5.0|you need to get it the puzzles are hard but not to dificult. theres several ways to make beat the game so you can play it over and over.love the game you need to get it.
B007H7XJD4|3.0|Rent, dont buy. It was not bad. Decent entertainment on a rainy day with nothing else to do. I don't regret watching it. I'm glad I didnt go see it at the theater and I'm glad I didnt buy it.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|I like this chess game, but it would be nice to have an option to turn off the board flipping around in two player mode.  This would be helpful when playing on a tablet since you could play flat on a table like a real chess board.
B007X16GFC|3.0|Considering good old markie mark is in this, you'd think it would be a good film. ive never seen a bad movie by the guy. Oh wait, I just did.
B005CYLG5W|1.0|I bought this because I ran across some videos of this concert on YouTube and I am a total Roxy Music fan. I read the DVD reviews, and based on the positive reviews, I bought the blu-ray -- thinking that if the DVD is great, then the blu-ray must be even better.<br /><br />Bad mistake. This blu-ray is total crap. I don't know about the DVD's quality, but this blu-ray is garbage. Bad sound and bad video quality. Also, it is made in Germany (German introduction screens). I thought this was a legitimate blu-ray, not some bootleg-quality disk.<br /><br />Restarted the player a couple of times hoping for improvement, tried another player -- gave up. Took the disk out of my blu-ray player and repacked it for return.<br /><br />STAY AWAY FROM THIS BLU-RAY.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cute, fun game. Don't know why it needs location, but otherwise, it's great, great gameplay, awesome variety of levels, et cetera.
B008TRUDAS|1.0|Mostly 5 star reviews? New York Times best seller?  This makes me suspicious of all Amazon reviews and perhaps NYT as well. If you are a 13 year old girl pining for romance you might...and I emphasize might.. find this somewhat readable. Otherwise, DO NOT waste your money.  Honestly, I wish there was a way to make the author repay me for this dreck.  Avoid it.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It's fun, my only complaint is the fact that there is absolutely zero replayability. You beat it, and you're done. Congrats.
B004GJDQT8|1.0|thay is how terrible this app is. I have decided to buy from eBay.  I eould love to buy from Amozon.  But this spp eill not. alliw purchases.  This app created frustration that is reprehensible.  This is the app from hell.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the best calculator app I've found for my Kindle Fire (and I've tried a few).  It's a full screen app with large, easy-to-read buttons and all of the functionality of a standard calculator.  My search for a good calculator is over!  thanks Digitalchemy!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I carry my KINDLE FIRE like most do there cell phone. With. this app. I now have a 5 x7 calculator.  LOVE IT!!!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|omg best game ever! there is nice action fifteenth stones and of course fun. if I were you GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|I love the series, cant wait for season 3. Now I can go back and watch season 2. The zombie head was designed by Greg Nicotero who is the special effects and makeup leader on the show, and he did a great job. Its the zombie from episode 1 of season 2 that Andrea stabbed in the rv. Its awesome and its really cool that you have to stab him in the eye to open the head. A great edition and one of my favorites in my blu ray collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|great game love it my 3 year old cousin loves just as much as I do it's fun I think there should be a Simpson's temple run
B000HF4TIM|4.0|I love this movie and I was glad I was able to rent it. The only downside was the sound quality. I'm not sure if it's the movie or Amazon, but it was quite poor. My sound system was cranked up extremely high just to hear the dialogue.<br />Otherwise, it was great. It streamed quickly and I didn't have any problems with freezing or other technicalities.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Nexus 7.  The app is smooth and has many levels of difficulty that flow from easy to more challenging. I worked construction for many years and found the premise to be like the routing problems we would encounter in our blueprints of heating and water piping systems as they pass vertically from floor to floor. Not a tough game, but nobody really wants to play something they can't win. Well worth downloading.
1451696205|5.0|In the murky lake of trashy YA fiction, The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a rare gemstone.<br /><br />The story is told as a series of letters from Charlie to a stranger. His account is almost a personal diary of a year in school detailing his somewhat disturbed teenage life as somewhat of an outsider. The tale reads with great authenticity, and one easily sympathizes with Charlie and his story.<br /><br />This story reminds me of To Kill a Mockingbird mixed with Flowers for Algernon mixed with the South African schoolboy book Spud. Rather than a typical YA story with a formulaic YA plot, you get an intricately woven character story about friendship and trust and the ups and downs and general turmoil of life.<br /><br />This is a YA story that reads fairly slowly but at the same time extremely beautifully. Around eighty pages through the tension levels were a little low for my tastes, but they soon picked up again.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book, and recommend it to anyone looking for something more than the usual market YA novel.
B00932A6G4|5.0|I enjoyed the first movie however it went downhill from there (in my opinion)<br />This movie turns it around and sets the Starship Trooper universe in a whole new direction!<br />GREAT CG and some familiar art from popular games...<br /><br />if you like the first and want more bugs check this one out.
B000A2IPP0|5.0|This DVD is great. We forgot how good the movie was. Our grand daughters ages 2 1/2, 3 1/2 and 11 years of age loved the movie and have watched it several times. So glad Amazon.com had this movie.<br /><br />EEP
B004T4LUPW|5.0|It was a little challenging to figure out how to get things top show up in different colors, but their website was helpful.  It is easy to use, syncs quickly and works great!
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I am very please with this backpack!  In looking at the pictures before I made the purchase, I knew there were a lot of pockets.  However, you still don't get just how many pockets this backpack has until you see it in person.  If you don't have enough room in this backpack, you seriously need to consider downsizing what you feel you need on a daily basis!  I emptied 2 bags into this one backpack, and I still have room for more stuff!!  Everything I need as a business professional, and a student, fits perfectly in this bag.<br /><br />I was a little worried about my laptop fitting inside this bag.  It fits like a glove.  I have an HP 620 (school edition), 15.5\\".<br /><br />The quality of this bag is superb!  Very sturdy zippers; it has a handle on the top that is made from thick cable, the type you would use to chain up your bike somewhere; it also has another handle that is sewn into the back that you could use to hang your backpack up on a hook; the back is very padded for comfort when carrying the pack on your back and the weight of this bag is perfectly balanced so when you have it on your back it does not throw you off center.  Even with everything I have in it, it does not feel as though it is weighting me down.  I have had backpacks in the past that would throw you off balance if you had just a little bit of stuff in there.<br /><br />I am very happy with Beach Camera and my experience in doing business with them.  It shipped time; I ordered this bag on Saturday, it shipped on Monday and was at my house on Wednesday.  I will be doing more business with Beach Camera!
030758836X|5.0|After I was about 20 pages into \\"Gone Girl,\\" I asked myself why I'd gotten it.  I like an occasional mystery, but it's not my favorite genre (in fact, for many years I shunned them).  And I dislike books about dysfunctional families.  By about page 21, I was hooked, and I finished the book in two days. (I'd have finished it sooner but for my day job and what passes for my life.)<br /><br />I don't know if I'd call \\"Gone Girl\\" a \\"literary thriller,\\" as one Amazon reviewer called it, but it is definitely a thriller and a blazingly good read; it is extremely hard to put down.  And I disagree with the reviewers who disliked the ending; in fact, I think the ending was perfect for a book that kept me guessing on nearly every page.<br /><br />I will say no more, except that this was a great read and one that actually deserves its top spot on best seller lists throughout the land.
B006R8GK2Q|3.0|it was fun. some of the mini games are random and difficult. a bit too much dialogue. still kinda fun, tho.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|some of the games are really hard. they are confusing .....but .....its a very fun game. I love it. its awesome ...
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|I can't figure out why the Disney people did such a poor job of publicizing this film, starting with the<br />humdrum and misleading title. Earthguy On Mars would have been better, or at least more descriptive. Or<br />even Leading Woman Has the Most Incredibly Beautiful Eyes. The views are utterly breathtaking, the<br />script actually has some funny lines along with the comic-book hokum, and the whole thing keeps moving<br />along suspensefully at a fast clip. Anyone who loves sci-fi action thrillers will get a kick out of it,<br />even if the storytelling is a bit lumpy--important explanations can be gasped out rather suddenly, major<br />plot turns are often unsupported...that kind of thing. Clearly, a lot of people took a lot of trouble<br />to make this film exciting, and it shows. Don't listen to high-hat critics. See it for yourself.
1439102430|3.0|From the distressing opening scene of a small maggot-infested corpse, you know straightaway that this latest from Kathy Reichs is seemingly more edgy in it's subject matter and choice of victim than her usual fare, as Temperance Brennan once again finds herself embroiled in murders most foul. With typical attention to detail, we follow Brennan's crucial forensic discoveries as she pieces together- sometimes literally, as later she solves a macabre jigsaw involving exhumed remains- the secrets that dead bodies can yield up under her close scrutiny . No matter how many times the song `Dem Dry Bones' crosses my mind in Reichs' detailing of which bone connects to which, I always find the specificity of this information strangely compelling andit always adds to the perennial authenticity of Brennan's logical and focused investigations of the human body.<br /><br />Another weapon in Reichs' armour is her ability to perfectly capture place and atmosphere, whether in the `nuts and bolts' description of location, or is as particularly evident in the setting of Yellowknife, the own peculiar history of that location. Reichs' takes us on a historical trip back through Yellowknife's former fortunes as an area rich in gold, to it's now new lucrative position as a diamond -mining town. Personally, I rather enjoy this sojourn down a rags to riches memory lane (at least for some of the prospectors) to flesh out what is at times a slightly leaky story with some twists in the plot signposted a little too clearly for the seasoned crime reader. Also, in the course of the book, Reichs' tries a little homespun social analysis on the subject of race and dips her toe into a somewhat stereotypical depiction of environmental campaigners and, although I can understand her needing to employ these facets of the story to drive the plot forward in a particular direction, it does feel a tad forced and, dare I say it, slightly clunky at times.<br /><br />On an altogether lighter note, Brennan finds herself torn between two lovers as a couple of former suitors flex their muscles and vie for her attention, with the inevitable butting of heads that always ensues in these situations, and with rather a surprise announcement by Brennan's daughter Katy to add to her personal chagrin, there is a nice balance as usual between Brennan the professional forensic anthropologist, a concerned mother and quite possibly a lover...no spoilers here!<br /><br />I must confess after not having read a Kathy Reichs for a while it was quite nice to revisit a familiar character- like pulling on a comfy pair of slippers- and despite its flaws it was great to spend some time in the company of Temperance Brennan. I'd rather missed her!<br /><br />(And it goes without saying, extra points for the adaptation of a Bond movie for the title...!)herself torn between two lovers as a couple of former suitors flex their muscles and vie for her attention, with the inevitable butting of heads that always ensues in these situations, and with rather a surprise announcement by Brennan's daughter Katy to add to her personal chagrin, there is a nice balance as usual between Brennan the professional forensic anthropologist, a concerned mother and quite possibly a lover...no spoilers here!<br /><br />I must confess after not having read a Kathy Reichs for a while it was quite nice to revisit a familiar character- like pulling on a comfy pair of slippers- and despite its flaws it was great to spend some time in the company of Temperance Brennan.

B0017TFLBQ|4.0|Contains spoilers. Written for moderately advanced players familiar with the HOMM series.<br /><br />HOMM III and IV combine the best of both worlds, part RPG and part empire building/strategic simulation. Containing far more depth and replay value than the typical RTS, the turn-based classic provides the player with a seemingly limitless set of choices for creating a fantasy army while building up towns into veritable fortresses. HOMM III is highly playable and is one of the best games in the HOMM franchise as it contains the greatest number of variables and an extremely easy to use map editor. I would say the towns have the best collection of creatures and the factions make the most sense of the series. The graphics are also far ahead of their time.<br />HOMM IV is a bit odd in that the player is allowed to send out individual creatures as armies but it does allow for maximum customization of heroes within armies. Heroes can now fully become part of the action, even more so than in HOMM V. They can be fully immersed into combat and can wield potions to keep them in the fight longer. Also, HOMM IV allows for multiple heroes to work together in a single army posing the question: what's better? Having a set of high level heroes tooled up in a combat group or a mighty well-rounded army? Also, HOMM IV also contains a map editor for the creation of even more thrilling scenarios.<br />Definitely worth the modest price.
B008BIN9EW|4.0|the campaign is worth it for the cost best kindle game i hage played yet. although once you get more bases it is over.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book gives a ton of info about The Capitol and all the strange twisted things they do to people. It's very interesting and somewhat disturbing in areas although not quite as exciting as the 1st or 3rd book. But even though it doesn't hold the excitement of the other 2 books, it is a very good book in it's own right because it does give a lot more background info on The Capitol which makes it easier to understand why they do what they do.....and it helps you to understand that The Capitol and President Snow are actually much more dark and twisted than you ever realized after reading the first book. It may not cause you to endure sleepless nights to find out \\"what happened\\" but it's definitely an enjoyable and entertaining read.
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|It took me about an hour to install the batteries -- the fit is awful. I almost broke the battery pack while trying to jam it in to the mouse because the metal is so flimsy. The batteries never charged (sat on the charger for two days straight). I also didn't like that it took up one more USB port on my computer -- wish it had a battery charger that plugged in to the wall.<br /><br />I don't recommend buying this product at all. If you want to go with a rechargeable battery, I would purchase them directly from the Apple site.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was an unbelievable book! After reading the first two books I really didn't think the author could write a book that was even better but WOW!! Without giving anything away, let's just say that there were so many twists and turns in this story that I couldn't put the book down...I was even taking my Kindle to work to read on my breaks. However it was bittersweet, the more I read, the closer I got to the end of the book which was very sad. All in all this was an exciting read and I plan to read it again. My only disappointment with the book is that I thought it ended a bit upbruptly, I would've liked to see the ending spread out over a few chapters rather than a few pages...it was kinda like !!BAM!!....\\"wow I didn't expect that\\", and then it was over.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Loved this on my iphone, couldn't wait to try on my Fire. Thank you for giving me this one. LOOKS FANTASTIC on the bigger screen. Just missing the eagle but its no problem. you wont be sorry if you're a fan of AB
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I heard so much hype about this book (and the whole book series) that I decided to give it a try but I went into it with some hesitation. I realized that this was a book that had been intended for younger audiences (I'm 41) but I'd seen fb posts from friends my age who loved it so why not? Wow!! I must admit I was blown away! Once I started reading I was sucked into this story within just a few pages. It was not \\"dumbed down\\" for younger readers, it was wonderfully written and I truly believe it could appeal to many age groups. Even though I'm old enough to be Katniss' mom, I had no problem identifying with her character. I loved how she was not the stereotypical \\"weak girl\\" and indeed was a very tough and intimidating character. I purchased the second book in the series before I had even finished this one...I wanted to be ready to continue! You won't be disappointed...until you finish the series and realize there's no more Katniss stories to read!!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|My friends told me about this book and I decided to give it a shot. I'm not a fan of the whole romance/erotica genre but I travel a lot and I heard it was a quick read. I think I did manage to get through the book within a week which is pretty quickly for me. However, the beginning is the hardest to get through. There is little development and too much repetitiveness.<br /><br />As for the story line, I enjoyed it (once we got into the meat of the story). But like many other people said the author does not know how to write well. It almost seemed a bit too dumbed down for my liking. The sex scenes all seemed the same and if I had to read through the \\"rules\\" one more time I was going to rip the pages out. But like I said, I travel a lot and need a book with me that is easy and entertaining (Fifty Shades was both).<br /><br />I guess it's personal why I will not chose to continue reading the trilogy. I usually never read the endings of books, I just believe that I can think of a better ending than the one the author probably had written. However, because there is two more books, I was kind of forced to read it. I remember sitting on the plane, reading the ending, and literally wanting to punch Anastasia. I couldn't stand her character all throughout the book but the ending took the cake. I was officially done with these books. I understand the in the next book things changed but my annoyance with her character is greater than my desire to continue reading.

B000127LW2|3.0|Star Trek Voyager was the first Star Trek franchise I never bothered to finish. I even watched all 4 seasons of Enterprise on Netflix. However, Voyager just never rose beyond a mediocrity. The whole premise was that the ship was stranded in the Delta Quadrant, far from home, but we never actually see any implications of this. There is almost no tension amongst the crew, no divisions, no infighting. Starfleet discipline is maintained even when it doesn't make sense. Very few families or deep relationships forming, something absolutely impossible in such close quarters. The show could have gone off in an interesting direction, but instead became a more action-oriented Next Generation.<br /><br />Given that the producers decided to take the show in an episodic rather than serial format, the show needed something other than the plotline to make it interesting. However, the crew is for the most part an utterly boring bunch. Katherine Janeway is fine as the ship's captain, emanating a motherly concern for the crew, but can't hold a candle to Captains Picard or Sisko. The holographic doctor is ironically the most interesting and entertaining character. He provides much-needed humor. However, the rest of the crew shows little to no character development. They're usually relegated to restating the obvious.<br /><br />Voyager was partly a victim of more cynical viewer attitudes in the late 1990s and the rise of reality TV. However, Voyager also failed on its own grounds. Coming after TNG and DS9, Voyager needed to more than just another Star Trek.

B004PIKPTY|5.0|This headset is great, the sound quality is fantastic, the mic works fine, and the software is a good sound mixer if you haven't customized it yourself. The headset is a little heavy, and the top cushion can get a little uncomfortable if you don't rest it properly on your head, but I've used them for hours on end without any complaints. The control on the cord, which is braided, (a definite +) is facing the wrong way so you have to turn it in your hand, while this is not an inconvenience, it is worth noting. The spare cushions you get are nice, and the fact that they can fold makes travelling great and convenient. They even come with a great little pouch to keep them extra safe.<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who wants to buy some good PC gaming headphones (they don't work on xbox) who doesn't want to spend too much.

B008DVJO8C|5.0|For all those hard rock music fans, this is a must have CD/album. I heard this band on the radio and the song \\"Blood\\" is what won me over. After buying the CD and listening to it a couple of times, all the songs are just as good as \\"Blood\\". It's rare to have an album have all of its songs to be good. Usually it is one or two good songs and the rest are fillers. Not this album. Get it and you won't regret it!

B0031YJFCQ|3.0|This is my first Kindle purchase and my first book review.  Despite the plethora of comments, I felt compelled to leave my own.  Immediately from the first book in the series, I've been mesmerized Lisbeth--she is nearly superhuman in strength and intelligence, despite her diminutive frame and no apparent education.  Sure, it's completely unrealistic, but I don't always expect fiction to mimic reality, and I was immediately drawn in by the fantasy her character represented. Because I was so captivated by Lisbeth right from the start, I missed her presence in this third book.  Overall, I was disappointed with all of peripheral characters and subplots.  They seemed to make the story a bit convoluted.  Truth be told, I skimmed over many sections--I kept thinking, \\"Yada, yada, yada...what's the point?\\"  As many others noted, however, the last part of the book will make many readers feel rewarded for how much time they invested in finishing the final book in this trilogy.  On the other hand, if you are one of those readers who just can't turn another page, rest assured that this is one of those rare times that the movie may be better than the book.  (Yes, I know, I have offended those truly committed to literary works who scoff at the idea that a movie could ever do a book justice!)  For me, I'm glad that I finished out the series, I just wish this book had been an engrossing page turner like the first two.

B007ZGO7EM|1.0|Today I visited the appstore to check the top-rated apps, and I saw a calculator: the one thing all computers and tablets should have. So I decided to take a look, and... what? You can add, subtract, multiply, divide, even... wait. That's it. Not very interesting, is it? Now, other than that, this app is very helpful. If you want something that is ridiculously wasteful, unresponsive, and with the mental abilities of a ten-year-old, this app is for you. Actually, just kidding, this app isn't useful for anything. I can, without sarcasm, say one positive thing: it's free. So since the developer won't make, any money, I encourage you to try this app for yourself. Then use it once. Then delete it. Then write a negative review, just like me. And if you have no dignity and choose to actually use this app, you don't have to write a negative review. But if you don't have anything bad to say, its better not to say any thing at all.
0385523912|5.0|This book captured my attention from the beginning. The book tells the story of 6 people, their lives in North Korea and how they escaped. I feel so lucky to not have been born in North Korea. I find it so sad that the North Korean government treats their citizens as disposable.
B000Q76K1A|3.0|I saw \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" first, because I wanted to see Paul Greengrass' fiction after I saw his documentary, \\"United 93.\\"  And Greengrass delivered very big screen, car chases, multi-countries, a driving score!  Can't say enough.<br /><br />Then, I thought I needed to see \\"The Bourne Identity\\" because of flashbacks and references made in \\"Supremacy.\\" The only tie between the two movies are the use of the same actors.  The two stories can stand alone and don't substantiate each other.  After seeing \\"Supremacy,\\" you can't go back to the plodding pace \\"Identity.\\"
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Brilliant witty dialog and beautiful writing. I absolutely loved this book. John Green wrote a beautiful romance between two teens with cancer. The secondary characters are great too, you really get to know everyone in the story. An emotional read that is just fantastic. I will read this one again and again.
B000Q79HS8|5.0|I wanted to see this movie because I admired Paul Greensgrass' \\"United 93.\\"  And Greensgrass delivered big.  Then I thought I needed to see \\"The Bourne Identity,\\" due to the flashbacks and I didn't understand why Bourne had to kill the Russian?  What a enormous difference!  The \\"Bourne Supremacy\\" is not a sequel.  It's a whole different story, which distances itself from the original, especially Bourne's first assignment which is changed from \\"The Bourne Identity.\\"  So, no need to see \\"The Bourne Identity,\\" which is greatly dwarfed by the big-budget, country-hopping \\"Supremacy.\\"<br /><br />Greengrass delivers and I watched \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" many times to catch all the details contained in every frame.  I also appreciated the Bonus stuff.

There are a couple parts a little violent, don't actually show anything but kids put two and two together, for very young &lt;4 years old.

0316010669|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell, in his book blink brakes down the idea of instincts and discusses their possible credibility. As is the subtitle of the book, `thinking without thinking,' Gladwell leads the reader, mainly through examples and scientific findings, to the idea that we have two separate modes of coming up with a solution; the general one which we call thinking and a second one which he refers to as rapid cognition (or instinct).<br /><br />In his introduction, Gladwell talk about a very expensive statue which had to be evaluated for a possible fraud before the museum made their purchase of it.  He goes on to list several art experts, who at first sight of the statue either got a `hunch' that something was amiss, or said that they felt cold, or even strongly suggested that the statue not be purchased. The story line follows that a 14 month investigation that the museum conducted bought them to the conclusion that the statute in fact was a fake.  What took the museum 14 months to figure out, the exert `understood' within the first couple of seconds. \\"Blink is about those first two seconds.\\"<br /><br />Gladwell begins to build his argument by separating the two types of ways our brains can make sense of a situation: first, the common sit-down-and-think-about-it until you've consciously figured it out. And the second, which operate much faster than the first strategy, and generally operates completely outside our conscience. The latter method, which he compared to a giant self-operating computer, is referred to as the adaptive unconscious. He proposes that the adaptive unconscious is in place as a survival mechanism, because when we are in danger we don't always have time to rationally think about how we can solve the urgent matter. We can see this mode in action when there is a car coming right at us, and we are also privileged to see this kind of fast thinking when we get our `first impression' of someone or something.<br /><br />This form of \\"rapid cognition\\" says Gladwell, might put the reader into suspicious. He expands; haven't we always been told to `stop and think' and `not judge a book by its cover?' But can this be partially false, questions Gladwell? Can first impression and snap judgments be of any value? Yes, answers Gladwell as he begins to present his goals for blink.<br /><br />First, that these unconscious decisions can be as good as those made with general `slow' thinking. Second, when and how we can pick out times that these quick instincts can yield to false conclusions. Third, that we can educate and control out snap judgments and first impressions. And forth, Gladwell's personal hope for the world, that once the readers begin educate and control their rapid cognition it can improve the world on an economic, political, and social.<br /><br />The book is then broken down into six chapters and a conclusion. The chapters are used as different arguments to support Gladwell's goals for the book. The chapters are broken down into sub sections in which he builds up each argument premise by premise.dwell, might put the reader into suspicious.

If you want to see an experimental movie that proves a film doesn't need the computer graphics of Transformers or the budget of an Adam Sandler movie to be good. You get attached to the situation and characters despite the fact that there is no set and minimal props. Watching this movie truly a long-winded, but exciting, experience.

B000SW2F6M|5.0|Let me say first:  I was brought up in the Church which started the Crusades-- you know who I mean--and I graduated with a degree in theology, the \\"science\\" of religions--studied all of them, still di.  This movie should be required viewing for all history students -- and fundamentalists.  This film is a tru representation of how religion can be used by the power and money hungry.  It also shows how men of TRUE faith and good sense learn to rise above that religion.  The acting is wonderful, the costumes excellent and Ridley Scott is a truly great director.  There is some differing from history in the who actually loved who department, and truly, the final dvd cut is much better than public showing.  But it is fairly accurate.  Many Europeans respected Sala 'haDin so much they named their children after him.  The movie is beautiful and so procative.  Now in this time, you watch it and make up your own mind about who is the bad guy.  Tolerance will make a \\"better world than we have seen.\\"
B008CP6RWU|5.0|I was cautiously optimistic as I prepared to play Journey for the first time. There were so many glowing reviews by game journalists that I could not discount its quality, however I wasn't completely convinced of its greatness and so approached it with hope and a slight amount of pessimism.<br /><br />There have been many defining moments with video games that I've experienced in my life. The joy and wonder of discovering likes of Pac Man and Centipede in the arcade as a five-year-old. As I grew up and video games changed, my horizons opened up with the possibility for adventure in The Legend of Zelda on the NES. Super Mario Brothers, Mario 64, The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, Doom and Half Life. Each of these represented major evolutional steps in video games. Exploration, adventure, 3D worlds, immersion, storytelling. I look back fondly on all of those experiences but in doing so realized that as the years have gone by these types of moments came with less frequency and impact. I love games such as Mario Galaxy, Red Dead Redemption and Skyrim. I can appreciate the mind-blowing quality and depth of these games but they don't stack up to the experiences of my youth with, arguably, vastly inferior games.<br /><br />It only took a short time with Journey to come to the realization that I was experiencing something that I had been missing for many years. Chills ran down my spine. My pulse quickened. I was enthralled. It was not immediate but grew like a wave, building slowly and consistently until the wave broke in a crescendo that was moving and awe-inspiring that left me speechless and teary-eyed. I had not been affected like this in years and perhaps ever.<br /><br />Journey is an experience that is a privilege to partake in. It evokes a range of emotions from joy and wonder to fear and heartbreak. The visuals are a sight to behold. It is simple, but not simplistic. It will make you ponder life, friendship, love, loss and triumph. Journey deserves to be experienced.

B0061PEAUY|2.0|Although I'm a fan of the Tempe Brennan books, I was disappointed with \\"Bones Are Forever\\". There was less of the forensic and police procedural details that I enjoy, and too much (for me) uninteresting facts on diamond formation and mining. The plot seemed contrived and unrealistic. The investigation was chaotic and jumped all over the place, both in locality and facts. In most of the prior books of this series, the author provided rich detail - historical facts, investigative techniques and progress on the case, but this time, the long and overly-detailed info on diamonds was overkill.<br /><br />Detective Andrew Ryan was involved in the investigation of the deaths of four infants, along with a Royal Canadian Mountie that Tempe had a brief affair with when they were both at the FBI training facility, Quantico. But, there was no real connection between Tempe and Dr. Ryan, and very few words of a personal nature between them. Additionally, Tempe barely acted in a civil manner toward Mountie Ollie Hasty.<br /><br />I was waiting for Ms. Reichs' usual lush plot to lure me into the mystery, but it never happened for me. There was a Keystone Cops feel to Ryan and Brennan's behavior and too many supporting characters and convoluted theories crowding the story.<br /><br />There was no advance of a personal relationship between Dr. Brennan and anyone, except for a few sentences spoken between Tempe and Detective Ryan, signifying nothing.<br /><br />So, I was disappointed ...... and bored.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved The Hunger Games: it was the best book I've ever read.  It may not sound like \\"your type of book\\". Believe me, it wasn't mine either until I started reading it and I couldn't put it down. My advice is to just try it and you won't be able to put it down.  Its adventurous, suspenseful and will have you dying to know what happens next!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|After enjoying the first series immensely, I was extremely excited about season 2, especially with The Woman, The Hound, and The Professor on the docket.  Although I had seen the episodes online on PBS, I learned that, just as with the first season, slight and unusual edits were made in the aired/streamed episodes that remain intact in the DVD version.  If you enjoy the series, purchase the DVD.

B004SBQGHS|5.0|If you played and enjoyed it so much that you beat all the levels and stuff then you should have just ponied up the 99 cents long ago. I paid for it over a year ago and haven't gotten past the first 5 levels, but I haven't had to deal with ads since day one.  Playing a free ad-based game for hours isnt exactly supporting the developer. And then to bitch when the FAOTD overwrites your freebie progress even though you didnt pay again? For those that paid, then you are justified in your bitching.
0345803485|1.0|Wow, this is truly the most boring book I've ever tried to read...I say tried because it was so incredibly boring I couldn't even read the whole thing. It has NO story...the series is just basically an excuse to write S&M lite sex scenes for twenty somethings who've never actually ready good erotica. I read the \\"Story of O\\" in my twenties and this doesn't even come close. It's S&M lite for the Twilight obsessed YA audience girls who've never in their lives heard of S&M. There is NO story...not much S&M really takes place, well, a little ... mainly the sex consists of Christian \\"punishing\\" Ana with multiple orgasms for her disobedience, against her will...then she whines about it afterwards, yet she still marries him ... because he's \\"hot\\", I guess.<br /><br />The whole point of S&M is the woman WANTS to submit to the man...some of the sex scenes seem more like rape than willful submission. Rape can be good role play, but Ana seems to dislike the whole thing even though it makes her tingle \\"down there\\". And what is with all this \\"inner goddess\\"  and \\"subconscious\\" Sh*t...Gosh...I was beginning to wonder if E. L. James' comically bad writing is a joke. How did an editor let this mess happen?<br /><br />Ana definitely acts like a teenaged girl, and Christian, although we're constantly reminded about his hotness, seems a little psychopathic. And how does a 27 year old guy become a billionaire anyway?<br /><br />I LOVE erotic...and this is SO boring! Initially I thought some of the sex scenes were well written, but that has worn off fast. Also, some of the sexual gymnastics honestly seems unrealistic to me. How many women can actually orgasm from having their nipples sucked and tweaked? Not me...well...if you are a teenager who's never read about S&M and sex and you are obsessed with Vampire Edward, you will love this. Adult women beware...<br /><br />E. L. James should be on her knees every night thanking God for Twilight, because without those books she wouldn't have her characters. But WAIT - Twilight is boring as hell also! And she plans to re-write the third book from Edward's POV? Wait - didn't Stephanie Meyers plan to do that?<br /><br />Frankly I'm surprised that Stephanie Meyers hasn't sued E. L. James yet for stealing her characters. She must be a nice person.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Somehow I missed this book when it was first released.  Now, with the impending release of the movie in November, 2012, I looked into it.  I could not have loved this book more.  It has stayed with me for several weeks after i finished it.  Two separate stories evolve.  Before and after getting on the boat.  I cannot wait for the movie, but cannot imagine seeing it without first reading the book.
B000JBWWRY|1.0|The disc was made for eurpeon DVD players and it won't play in the us made DVD players. So it really sucked when my kids saw the disc and it won't play. My husband use to work in the DVD/cd production industry so he noticed right away the writing on the cover was in German that it won't play.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|this is a must get app!!!! it is beautifully presented and its nice to have hd videos......the app runs smoothly, and at a great quality. however i cannot seem to enlarge the screen on my kindle but it might just be a personal problem.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|amazing app! works really well on the kindle fire. I highly reccomend this app. also good for reading plans too
B005IQZB14|5.0|Makes you want to go out and do something meaningful with your life and to push beyond your comfort zone. Informative, personal, emotional, awesome.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|Would be 5 stars if they had online backup for progress.  Not worth trying for 5 stars without it. Come on now.
B000F4RHB6|2.0|In short, the idea of remastering is nice but a bad idea. Whoever did the remaster must have used Bobby Brady headphones for the reference playback. Boom crash. Highs are punishing and bass is boomy. I found the original release of Sports ( I friend had one) and played back The Heart of Rock and Roll on two players and switched between them the difference is amazing....... FIND THE ORIGINAL discs that the tracks you like are on and save your money......
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I read the reviews and took a chance and I am so happy I did. A truly great book with the feel as others have said of 'In the Name of the Wind'. The characters are well written and the pace is fantastic. I cannot wait until the next book. I have no idea how long the author took to write this book, but I do hope it was not years and that I will not have to wait years (like book three of 'The Warded Man'). The books that I have mentioned are my two favorites, but 'Blood Song' has joined the list and is number one!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|WOW, what a great series. I am not a fan of zombie movies, but this series pulls you in, in the first episode. My daughter talked me into watching the first season, and I could not wait for season 2 to come out. Hope (not question I will) watch season 2 before season 3 comes out on October 14th. Great story. I'm in for now, but when it turns into \\"Lost\\" I'm out.

B0088X7YU0|5.0|This is a great fan for all Starship Troopers franchise. It mixes both from the novel by Robert A. Heinlein and the first Starship Troopers movie. Fans of both movie and book will be satisfied with it. The story is not that complicated to understand. It is one of those pop corn movies that you just watch for fun and do not care too much of the story arc. Great film, loved the action scenes. I mean come-on who doesn't want to kill bugs. Plus since this is on sale for under $20 it is a great blu-ray addition to your growing library. Also watch the end of the cut scenes there is a little something at the end.
1451696205|5.0|This is definitely my favorite book! It is a well written story about Charlie and his freshman year. He has a very different insight in situations and his way of thinking is very interesting. All the emotions expressed in the story feel so real and make you want to either smile or cry. It makes you think about your decisions and your life.
0345803485|1.0|Atrocious is not even a strong enough word for this. Let's start with how the story is suppose to take place in America and the language is British Diction? The editing, the editor of this novel should have been fired, what fish-brained editor could not tell the difference in British diction and the American language. All the books from The Writer's Coffee Shop have poor editing, it's not brain surgery. If you read this alongside Twilight, it's the same crap, she took all of Meyer's details.  If I could put it better, this reads just copied Twilight into a new document and added a bunch of porn. This is not an erotic novel. Don't waste your money reading this, just go read fanfiction it's free porn on the internet, mind you well written porn.
B0006VBFM0|5.0|courteous service, I really liked the watch, what I expected. gladly recommend it. 100% satisfied. the seller was always responsive to my questions. This watch is sold at a good price with very good quality in the material production.
1594745692|5.0|I love these cards so much, I might order another deck and keep it as a collectors item. The artwork is great and they do have that retro feel to them. Aside from the usual minor arcana suits you get the additional \\"hazards\\" cards. Definitely worth getting.
B008CPBB0I|4.0|This movie was good.  Its good for the whole family and just about all ages.  Drew Barrymore's character was annoying, and I don't like her to begin with.  She reminds me of annoying people that I hated growing up, so its not necessarily her fault.  The movie is fun and touching, and has a lot of great actors in it.  I just rented it, and I don't think I would ever buy it.  Rent it.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I decided to read 50 shades of grey because everyone around me was doing the same. I´m not at all keen about all this bondage, sadistic thing so at first I did not feel inclined to read the book. I once tried to read \\"Justine\\" by the Marquis de Sade and was unable to go beyond the first pages. But I have to say that 50 shades of grey isn´t very disturbing. They are consenting adults, everything is previously agreed and the sex scenes are indeed quite sexy. Mr Grey reminds me of difficult Mr. Darcy (Pride § Prejudice) but in a 7.0 version! It was quite entertaining and in spite of the whole silliness I read it all. But I won´t buy the second and third book. I´d rather spend my time reading something more worthwhile. Anyway, I confess I entered amazon reviews to know what happened next to the couple...!
B005LAIHXQ|1.0|This film was a huge disappointment.  Flat characters with no development; a plot that was so predictable I was almost able to say the lines of the characters as they were talking!  There were several inconsistencies throughout the film (i.e., scares appear then disappear).  The religious overtones were also over the top.  All in all the film was a big disappointment and a let down.
0547569653|5.0|Scott's book is a really compelling story of running, struggle, change, joy, and heartache.  It's hard to classify because he touches on so many things.  No, this is not a coaching book or even a true autobiography, but you get s very intimate look at how he evolved as a runner and the things he has been through.  I liked reading about his failures just as much as his successes, because it shows that he is human -- and inspires me to keep going no matter what obstacle comes up.  He tells about how he discovered a connection between the food he eats and how that influences his running and other aspects of his life, which obviously is a main theme.  I enjoyed the recipes and can't wait to try them out.  I can't say I'm going to become vegan tomorrow, but I am certainly open to trying different things now.<br /><br />I received the book earlier this week and already finished it.  It's a quick page turner, and keeps you engaged throughout.  Highly recommend!
0312427999|4.0|In \\"The Shock Doctrine\\" Naomi Klein traces what she sees as a persistent economic trend during the last 30 years: the implementation of \\"Chicago School\\" economic policies through decidedly undemocratic means during tumultuous times for the benefit of multinational corporations and to the detriment of local workers and peoples. She traces this phenomena in a plethora of places (listed chronologically): Chile, Brazil,  Argentina, Uruguay, England (Falklands war), Bolivia, Poland, China, South Africa, Russia, Southeast Asia, Iraq, Sri Lanka after the 2004 tsunami, New Orleans after Katrina, and Israel with regards to Palestine.<br /><br />Ms. Klein personally spent time in many of these places, conducting interviews with everyone from local fishermen to famous economist Jeffrey Sachs. Her book is well-documented with a copious notes section. Of course, facts are (usually) irrefutable, but it is how those facts are interpreted that can differ. I have little background in economics, and I don't feel I know enough in that field to fully understand and respond to all of Ms. Klein's claims. However, I do think of myself as an educated and critical reader, and from that vantage, her general thesis, amply documented in a variety of places, is very strong. Clearly, unpopular economic policies have been foisted on many peoples in many places, a fact that explodes the fallacy that these peoples have chosen \\"free enterprise.\\" In times of chaos, many technocrats have used the smokescreen from anarchy and confusion to slip in unpopular economic policies. And the enforcement of unpopular policies often requires force, and torture, seen especially in Chile under Pinochet and Argentina.<br /><br />The book is a lucid and well-written expose. At times my interest waned, usually due to an avalanche of facts and figure, but I know the importance of including these numbers. However, overall I was very interested and engaged, occasionally enraged, as her book makes many events make more sense in the light she shines on them. The chapters on the Homeland Security complex and Iraq were highlights for me, depressing to learn the extent of cronyism and nepotism in my own country. There was much food for thought in this book and I recommend it as a highly critical and engaging history of one economic theory's underhanded foisting-on all over the globe. Get ready to be mad and then engaged! D.H. Lawrence said we walk through most of our life holding an umbrella with the sun, moon and stars painted on, convinced that is reality. Ms. Klein violently ruptures our collective umbrella and forces us to see the real sky, ugly thought it may be. Recommended.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|At first, I wasn't sure what I was getting into, as the book started by giving us a first person account by a scribe, which didn't strike me as all that interesting. But the book itself was clearly well-written and heading toward a purpose, and with such a teeny price tag, it seemed worth the risk of trying beyond the sample. It took a few chapters, but once I entered this new religion-driven, violence-soaked kingdom, feeling just as overwhelmed as our hero Vaelin Al Sorna, it was complete absorption. The characters throughout the book were all so well-developed, layered, and consistently drawn. The author showed a lot of patience carefully detailing all the main players, and the process never felt dry. It was a coming of age story that followed a boy into manhood on his path to greatness...while he struggled with religion, politics, brotherhood, and love. Granted, the plot itself doesn't sound especially original, but it felt so, and most importantly, it was masterfully executed. It deserves every 5-star review. One of the best fantasy books I've read recently. Desperately eager for the next book in Al Sorna's journey.
B0088X7YMS|4.0|Starship Troopers started out as a great ground-breaking first movie, a somewhat decent second movie, a mediocre third movie, and now comes roaring back in good form for a fun filled, exciting fourth movie.  It is good to see the series and Johnny Rico kick butt once more.<br /><br />It had some good \\"Planet P\\" type scenes in it (those who have seen the first movie will know what I mean) and was quite exciting and fun to watch.  I'm glad the series got its direction and its \\"Heart & Soul\\" back.
081297381X|5.0|Taleb wrote a brilliant tract that will stand the test of time.  The points he makes in the book have been illustrated in a spectacular way over the past few years. If you are making any long-term financial plans for dozens of years ahead, reading this book might alter your decision-making trajectory. Taleb goes after the \\"established\\" outlook on risk with absolute sense of righteousness.  His criticisms are often vicious, but seem to be well-deserved by the targets.<br />This is a great book that will change or refine your outlook on risk in its broadest sense.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|I became acquainted with Longmire when watching the TV series.  Wanting to know more about the character I decided to try the first book.  I loved it.  The characters are<br />interesting to get to know and I'm sure I will learn more as the series goes forward. The mystery was not one I could solve on the 4th page and there were many instances where I absolutely laughed out loud. The relationship between Longmire and Henry Standing Bear is wonderful.  I have purchased the second book and look forward to reading it and all the rest that are available. The only drawback was I am not fond of quite so many 4-letter words.  The TV series did this story as their end-of-season program but any similarity between the book and the TV version was purely coincidental.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|every update they bring out for this kindle version requires you to uninstall it first. this erases all of your progress. after paying $3 for it they shouldn't be charging 99&cent; for extra levels either. updates are at minimum a month behind all other platforms. just lousy customer appreciation or support.
B005C9YZIW|5.0|I have not yet watched all of the discs but have been blown away by the quality of the video and awesome sound of this blu ray. This is one of my prize blu ray's and a must for any collection. It looks so crystal clear and overwhelming on my 106 inch screen. The sound was also top notch with some nice deep rumbling from the sub woofer. Surprisingly it was my first nature disc but I don't know what took me so long. Definitely go with the six disc special edition version and steer clear of the Weaver commentary. I got this for around $25 used but all of the discs are in mint condition! There is some graininess present in the darker camera shots but this is expected. Also plan on eventually getting Blue Planet (when the blu ray comes out) and possibly Life as they both get stellar reviews. Others may want to check out the Extreme Ice video (still waiting for the blu-ray) as I was highly impressed when I watched it on Netflix.<br /><br />UPDATE: I wanted to give an update because after a thorough investigation and reading hundereds of customer reviews and also professional reviews there are differences that need to be pointed out with all of the versions.<br /><br />Six disc special edition: This is only 1080i- I have watched the entire episodes but not all of the special features. I found the picture to be stunning in most parts but there are some cases of noise espically in the darker shots. The sound is excellent and a solid upgrade from the last 2007 version. I did not like the special features as they did not look good on my set up or seem that interesting to me. When your eyes grow accustomed to watching HD videos standard def footage simply doesn't cut it.<br /><br />Planet Earth BBC 2007- 4 disc version- I received this the other day and did a quick test run on a few parts of the first disc. I wasn't more impressed with the picture even though it is in 1080p. To be clear, this IS IN 1080P, it is NOT 1080i like some other reviews had posted (the Discovery versionis 1080i from what I understand although I have not seen it). Overall is looked good but I did not like the sound as much. I also noticed some picture problems that I did not see in the Special edition version. On the freshwater disc during the Angel Falls sequence there is a slight stutter effect right before going over the falls.<br /><br />Overall, i will have to recommend the six disc special edition because of the better sound and smoother overall picture. I will however update my review after watching more of the 2007 version.If you're only buying it for the special features I would hold off as I found them disappointing.
B00127RAJY|2.0|If you like to workout standing up, and cool down with floor excercises do not get this DVD. If you do not like Bootcamp style workouts, do not get this DVD.<br /><br />I really wanted to have great abs and seeing that the reviews for this DVD were so high I thought I'd give her a try. She makes you do JumpinJacks, then lay on the floor for a sit up, then jumpinjacks again, then lay on the floor. My head was hurting really bad from laying down and jumping up. I was very dizzy and I thought I would pass out. I could do the excercises, it was the laying down and getting up that made me nauseous.<br /><br />It's not very fun and she pretty much does the same excercise sets every 3 minutes with a slight change. I do not recommend this for people who like their workouts structured like mine: standing up, and cool down with floor excercises. If you want to have fun while getting your body in shape, try turbojam or some type of dance workout instead.
B005LZW8FO|3.0|Plot summary: A college student into astronomy gets drunk one night and drives home.  While staring out the window at \\"something\\" in the sky, she collides with a family, killing a mother and her child, leaving only the father alive.  After being released from jail, she tries to deal with the guilt and the hardships in starting her life over.  Meanwhile, we find out the \\"something\\" in the sky is another Earth that is exactly the same as ours.<br /><br />Review: The movie itself is fairly original.  I was hooked in the beginning but after a while, the story of the main character and the father dragged on.  I don't think the movie was trying to find a deeper meaning in anything other worldly, which was the opposite of what I was expecting just from the title.  The ending was interesting but is pretty easily deduced if you pay attention to the news casts.  The cinematography was beautiful and was probably the most enjoyable part of this film.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I can waste so much time with this. It's great, time flies at work with  this, and keeps my kids occupied while shopping
0439023491|5.0|The book brings you right back into the world of the Hunger Games. The story continues to leave you guessing right until the end. As you read, you continually get to know the characters even better and are also introduced to newer ones, but the feeling of mystery about each person remains. Great setup for the third book of the series. So glad this place is fictional!
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I have all the angry birds free (with ads) versions and the only thing that would sometimes make me quit playing were when the ads got too annoying. This version takes care of that and the game runs so much smoother.<br /><br />People who are seeing ads on the play screen are NOT playing this version. They should re-install the app from the Amazon Appstore and then make sure they are hitting the right angry birds icon to open this game and not one of their other angry birds games that contain ads. Also, if you don't want to see the unobtrusive non-play ads for other rovio games you can just hit the \\"mailman pig\\" in the lower right corner of any pause screen and he will stop delivering to you! :)<br /><br />This game also does keep your scores/progress from the ad version of the game when you install this over it. There are several low-rated posts here full of misinformation, so trying to help clear some of this up. Hope this helps. And I got this app free today but after seeing the difference between this version and the ad version, I would pay for it as well.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I literally went to see this movie tonight at a second run theater and was absolutely astounded by how bad this movie was.<br /><br />As you can see, I don't take the time to review many things on Amazon or anywhere else for that matter but was moved to write this after I got home.<br /><br />I was not familiar with the books and had heard mixed reviews of both the books as well as the movie.<br /><br />From the writers to the directors to the acting and especially the filmography, this thing stunk to high heaven.<br /><br />The few action sequences were filmed so poorly you couldn't tell who was who much less figure out what they were trying to do. The dialogue was for 10 year olds as was the story which never got across why such a technologically advanced society would stoop to such brutal foolishness.<br /><br />The acting was third rate and quite frankly none of the characters managed to make me feel sympathetic in any fashion. It is rare to find a movie that is incapable of touching a chord with the audience in some manner but \\"Games\\" has managed to do it. I was so bored I just wanted to see all the \\"tributes\\" die just to get it over with.<br /><br />I truly cannot think of a movie I've seen in the last decade that was as bad as this one.<br /><br />If you have seen the movie and liked it, go ahead and pick up the DVD. If you haven't seen the movie just run away.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it's easy and simple to use. I have to fill 20+ words on this review and so far it's the only downside.
0307592731|5.0|\\"Wild\\" is a book that reminds us all that we have moments in our lives that make us stop and re-evaluate where we have been, where we are now, and where we are going - usually without even knowing how we got there. And sometimes it takes a drastic change to find who we thought we were all along. Cheryl found her path in life and herself by taking the path very much less traveled. While not everyone can up and leave what they currently have for a life and do what Cheryl did, we can change directions in our own lives, re-evaluate where we want to go, and make changes that are more true to ourselves. \\"Wild\\" is just one woman's way of doing that. And that's the inspirational lesson Cheryl teaches, even if she doesn't know it and it was never her intent. Everyone has it in themselves to find their own PCT - and maybe more of us should... Congratulations Cheryl on finding not only the strength to do what you have done in your life but to also share it with the world. Both of which are not an easy thing to do. Many more blessings and success. Namaste

1608871045|5.0|Fantastic well-crafted book. I have never seen a book so well put together combining everything from post-it notes to file folders, and other creative methods to give the book a feel of a notebook/book. Even the front and back hard covers have digital scratches giving the sense of a well-used scrapbook of Batman's toys. The schematics of the suit and weapons were my favorite. Very realistic and makes the genre feel more within reach of what an actual billionaire could get away with using modern materials. As a long time Batman fan I am very pleased to add this book to my library.

B004DLPXAO|3.0|I love my kindle's... I have a 2nd gen, a 3rd gen, and a fire.  The app on the fire is great, my favorite from any device.  But, do to some other limitations on the fire, I use a nexus 7 and a Motorola Xoom much of the time.  the android kindle app is really poor compared to many other amazon apps.  It's hard to navigate (try zipping around in a bible for instance) especially when compared to the fires version.  Please upgrade this soon.  And add the kindle bookstore as part of the app... while the web store works OK on a tablet, its much easier to read/explore the app version as opposed to the web version.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|There are a great many things wrong with this movie. The dialogue and character development are juvenile and boring (it was, after all, a so-called \\"young adult\\" book). Characters take actions that are not logical or reasonable. Much time is wasted developing threads that are never brought to fruition. This is perhaps because the story is Part One of a trilogy of books. Regardless, I am reviewing what now exists, and this movie doesn't hang together alone (without Parts Two and Three).<br /><br />A few examples of what my summary above includes:<br />1) At the initial battle at the Cornucopia, when the girl from District 2 is chasing after Katniss, we are not shown how Katniss got away. The camera simply cuts to the other melees between the other Tributes, and the next we see of Katniss, she's made it into the woods and runs into Foxface. Are we supposed to assume that the girl from 2 just gave up the chase?<br /><br />2) Alot of time in the first hour is spent developing the notion of the importance of \\"getting sponsors\\". Haymitch says \\"...things that can save your life...water, a knife, matches...only come from sponsors\\". Well, Katniss found water herself, and got a knife and matches in the knapsack she snatched at the Cornucopia...NOT sponsors. In fact, she never gets any sponsors. Cinna cannot be a sponsor because he asks Katniss about being told about sponsors. Yes, she gets a jar of medicinal cream for herself and for Peeta...probably came from a sponsor? But the accompanying card is signed by \\"H\\", which we must understand to be Haymitch (not a sponsor). Yes, we are shown Haymitch talking with some wealthy Capitol types just after having watched TV coverage of Katniss ministering to her leg wound...those must be sponsors. But they didn't contribute because of any effort that Katniss made...it was all Haymitch. Therefore, all the talk of sponsors throughout the first hour of the movie was all for nothing. There is no greater sin of a storyteller than that of wasting the reader's time. Big mistake.<br /><br />3) This is the one that gets me. Remember Peeta walking around the woods with the District 1 and 2 alliance? How Cato explains that they need to keep Peeta alive long enough to show them where Katniss is? What do they do when they chase Katniss up the tree? They lie down and camp out with him! (Maybe they decided to keep him alive as a walking, talking store of meat, in case later they can't get any food. Instead of calling him \\"loverboy\\" they could start calling him \\"Meat Locker\\"). Oh, and get this: did anyone notice that Peeta was allowed to FOLLOW the alliance members BEHIND, and carrying a SPEAR? And they even let him SLEEP with them?  How stupid/naive can you get?  And these are supposed to be \\"Careers\\", professionally trained Tribute volunteers from Districts 1 and 2! What a wus Peeta turned out to be; he had a perfect opportunity to stab one or two of them in their sleep and run off before they knew what'd happened. If he was really wanting to help his girl Katniss up in the tree, he could have done that.<br /><br />4) Last item, I promise. Remember the scene when Marvel throws the spear into Rue's chest? Somebody tell me why he threw it at Rue instead of Katniss? Katniss had the bow and arrows...Rue had nothing. Oh, and how when Katniss freed Rue from the snare, they just hugged each other instead of looking around for danger, which they should have known was coming because of Rue's cries for help. Ridiculous.<br /><br />There are alot of things wrong with this movie (hard to believe the author Collins herself adapted her book for the screen), but it has one big thing going for it: originality. It seems there's nobody left in Hollywood who knows how to think of anything new anymore. All we get nowadays are sequels, rehashed old plotlines, and these \\"reimagined\\" or \\"rebooted\\" superhero franchises. Is anybody else getting sick of all these tired old stories and characters? In my review of [[ASIN:B002VPE1AW Avatar]], I noted the fact that its plot was just a ripoff of Frank Herbert's [[ASIN:B0007PAMR4 Dune]]. I awarded two stars for its copycat plot because I detest lazy, thoughtless writing. Just as Tom Clancy's [[ASIN:B000IZ4QZM The Hunt for Red October]] was just a ripoff of Craig Thomas' [[ASIN:B001N8V7KA Firefox]]. On the other hand, I praised [[ASIN:B004EARTN8 Buried]] and [[ASIN:B002EOVXEC Fermat's Room]] for their wealth of innovative and inventive ideas and presentations.<br /><br />So despite all its flaws, which are really apparent only upon watching the movie several times, the Hunger Games is an exciting movie the first time or two. Perhaps that's because of all the anticipation that preceded its opening, but it's still a decent experience to have at least the first time. I cannot call it a great movie, but it does try to be different, and in my book that's a huge plus that is worth being rewarded. I also find worthy its treatment of Big Ideas, such as when President Snow (Donald Sutherland) says that hope is the only thing stronger than fear. (though I think that's a worthy statement, I personally can't always agree with it. Love of country -- patriotism -- often prompts soldiers to overcome their fears. And the emotion of hate always trumps fear: when you are possessed with pure elemental hatred, fear vanishes. You're focused on destruction of the enemy.)<br /><br />So, though I have to call [[ASIN:B008Z9YLV2 The Hunger Games]] a two-star movie, it was a five-star effort. That's worth four stars for my review. I can only hope that when they get to writing and shooting the Hunger Games sequels, they will do a better job of translating the books to the screen. No, correction -- I can also hope this new franchise is the beginning of a long and successful career for the Hunger Games world of stories yet to be conceived.
B0089LT8Y6|5.0|I've been a Testament fan for over 20 years, if you like Testament you should love this new album. These guys are still kicking ass, cool songwriting, Alex Skolnick's solos are awesome as usual, no complaints here. I really enjoyed \\"Low\\" which featured James Murphy on guitar but that was the only album he did with them and having Alex back you can tell he's a perfect fit for this group. I hope they make some more albums like this one, there are very few groups who can melodically rip like them.
B004GCKRWY|4.0|I've heard too many complaints that this movie is \\"just a guy in a box\\". It's alot more than that.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds plays truck driver Paul Conroy, who goes to post-invasion Iraq as a contract worker. The opening scene is total darkness. He lights his lighter and discovers he's in a closed wooden box, little larger than a coffin. It is made clear that he has no idea where he is or how he got there. He discovers a cellular telephone, and the story is off to his quest of finding out about his situation and how to get someone to find him and dig him out.<br /><br />I'm not going to give away the suspenseful plot turns; I will just cut right to the ending, which I found somewhat unsatisfactory. So if you don't want to know how the movie ends, quit reading here.<br /><br />In the end, Paul's box fills with sand and he suffocates. The part I found unsatisfactory was that he could have made a last-ditch attempt to get himself out since -- this is important -- it is apparent from his conversations on the cell phone that he's only buried about 3 feet under. If he could have gathered his feet under himself, or even just his knees, he just might have wriggled his way out (important: the panels of the box's top were broken from the weight of the sand, that's how the box was filling in). I know that may sound unlikely, but Paul is a young, strong man, he's fighting for his very life, and it's just sand, not packed earth. Anyway, he didn't even try, which made for a disappointing ending.<br /><br />One way many have described the movie is that it's just a guy in a box talking on a cell phone for 90 minutes before he finally dies. Well, I'm not going into details, but his effort to get somebody on that telephone who can help him made for quite an interesting story. Four stars.
B0000A2I1B|5.0|Beginning my journey with Santana since my junior year in high school, I became an instant fan. This 4th studio Santana group album (Carlos did side projects such as \\"Love, Devotion and Surrender\\" with John McLaughlin and a live album with Buddy Miles), is a stunning revelation in the gorgeous and dramatic, \\"Carvanserai\\". If you are looking for its \\"Evil Ways\\", \\"Black Magic Woman\\" or \\"No One to Depend On\\", it isn't here.    Released as a completed work. It was not led by an accessible Top 40 single. In fact, only a truly maverick Top 40 music programmer could play anything from \\"Caravanserai\\", especially during peak hours. Had Top 40 programmers been smart, however, they would have spun \\" Song of the Wind\\" as a great summer instrumental, though \\"Caravanserai\\" was released in the Fall of 1972. Instead, the burgeoning new FM band was all over this album, almost insuring against the lack of a single release. With the luxury to go far beyond the constraining 4 minute limit pop song, FM radio dug deep from \\"Waves Within\\", \\"Just in Time to See the Sun\\", \\"Future Primitive\\", \\"All the Love of the Universe\\", etc. to give listeners a broad cross section of this magnificent work.    To that end, Santana would easily earn another Top 10 platinum disc.    While it may leave the casual Latin rock fan of Santana's in a quandary, it still stands as a glorious introduction to Carlos' transcendental, atmospheric and spiritual jazz period that would extend well over a half a decade from 1972's \\"Caravanserai\\" to 1979's \\"Oneness: Silver Dreams, Golden Realities\\". Most of his albums from then on had a track in that vein.    I have a complete collection of Santana's work and own all of the 5 albums that Mobile Fidelity wisely remastered. Honestly, for my taste, most of Santana's releases deserve the Mobile Fidelity treatment. He commands nothing less.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|I got this app because when I was about 7 months pregnant, I started having a really hard time letting go of the stress of life and falling asleep. My 5 year old son sometimes has trouble winding down in the evening, so we turn this on while we read before bed and by the time the story if over, he is already half asleep. Even my husband who likes it quiet when he sleeps has used it to calm himself after a particularly frustrating day.

B007STBUIW|5.0|YOU'RE GONNA NEED A BETTER MEDIUM..., 2 Sep 2012<br />JAWS THE BLU RAY<br />\\"What we have here is a perfect movie, all it does is entertain, terrify adults and give little kids nightmares all night long...\\"<br />Like most people from my generation, I have a strange but very personal history with this movie. When it first came out I was not able to see it, I think I was thought to be too young. (The Poster did after all warn that this movie might be a bit too intense for little kids). My older brother saw it when it first came out and being a kid who lived inside his own head most of the time; he was able to remember every single line in the movie.<br />I come from the Bogside in Derry of Northern Ireland and I had absolutely no idea what a shark was, no concept at all - my brother Paddy, told me it was like a goldfish that was grey, that it was about the size of a bus and that it had rows of teeth the size of steak knives, oh yeah, and it also could bite a man clear in half below the waist - Yikes!.<br />One Halloween's night, a very stormy night if I recall correctly, in a friend's house, we sat, three friends and I, (all of us thought too young to see the film), under the kitchen table in the dark with a candle, and line by line, doing incredibly accurate impersonations of all the characters, the sound effects, the music, the screams from the onlooking bathers as people were eaten alive, my bother created out of the darkness of our overactive imaginations the entire 2hour plus movie and we were rooted to the spot and terrified beyond belief for every minute of that tale. When the shark was about to attack my brother did the two note music and that just built the tension even more than his vivid depictions of the mayhem off Amity.<br />When I finally saw the movie for the first time it was as a double bill with Jaws 2, - How lucky was I!!! - (which I think is still a pretty decent sequel but could have been better if Spielberg had a hand in it).<br />Needless to say, Jaws blew me out of my seat and when I had my first glimpse of what a grey goldfish the size of a bus with knives for teeth looked like up close on the big screen I told myself never ever to set foot in the ocean.<br />When Ben Gardener made his unexpected appearance from the jagged hole, I shot clear out of my seat as my heart jumped right out of my shrieking lungs; the timing, o boy, the timing of that appearance was sheer brilliance and from that moment on, whenever there was water on screen, even a slither of it, I was all bunched up in tension with my eyes darting all over just to make sure that monster was not about to suddenly pop from out of the screen to chomp on me.<br />As a kid from a slum, when I first saw the Chief's car driving along the beach road at the beginning of the movie I turned to my friend watching with me and told him that one day I would get out of the ghetto and live in a place just like Amity Island and strangely enough, I happen to live now in the very place where the underwater shots of the real shark attacking the cage was shot - Port Lincoln South Australia - a place that looks quite a lot like ole Amity - Weird or what, right?<br />I loved the movie and still consider it to be one of the most perfect movies ever made, great, mind blowing opening, and great pace, characters you care about, funny, frightening, and suspenseful with a great ending that makes you want to jump up and down on your chair and cheer.<br />I later read the novel in school, the version without the steamy affair between Hooper and Ellen Brody, and I loved that too. I went on to read Jaws 2 by Hank Searle and that was even better than the sequel movie, (I recommend it).<br />Over the years I have watched Jaws a number of times in different mediums, the last time being the DVD 2 Disc Edition and I have to say it is still one of my favourite films.<br />I have ordered it on Blu Ray and although it has still to arrive, I know it will be money well spent because Spielberg has had a hand in the restoration and if there is anything evident about this man when it comes to movies it is he is a perfectionist so I know I am going to have my socks blown off when I finally get to see my favourite film in HD for the first time.<br />I am already planning a Jaws fest with my eldest daughter, Storm, who also loves Jaws, she has yet to see Jaws 2, and so it is going to be great to watch the first one on Blu Ray and the second one on DVD. I have also ordered the Jaws Novels, 1 & 2, and the Jaws Log by Carl Gottlieb; maybe I should try and get a poster too!<br />I would like to say thank-you to all the people involved in the making of this movie and to those responsible for bringing it on to Blu Ray because even when we first watched it on video and DVD we all knew the makers were going to need a bigger boat to do this movie justice.<br />There I got in the best line in the movie.<br />Great novel, great story, great actors, Roy, Richard & Robert, great screenplay, great cinematography, and brilliant directing from a guy young enough not to know the difference between courage and stupidity.<br />Can't wait to get back in the water...<br />UPDATE...<br />Just received the blu ray and watched it immediately and I suppose the question on everyone's lips is does this transfer deserve me updating from the 30th Anniversary 2 Disc DVD Edition and the answer is YES-INDEEDYDOODY, YOU CAN BET YOUR GRANDPA'S BACK MOLARS AND YOUR GRANDMA'S PRETTY GREY HAIR - That is if he still has them and she isn't as bald and wispy as a China Man's chin -<br />The images are crisp on this baby now, I noticed things I had never noticed before and I loved that fact, the colours are glorious, the night time water shots are stunning, the blue skies oh so blue, the aqua waters crystal, the sheen of sweat on skin so clear you can see the pores on Chief Brody forehead, all of it wonderfully upgraded. This movie looks even better than it did when it first screened, and let's not forget, this is a 36 year old movie we are talking about. The underwater shots of the shark are especially good and one has to include the eeriness of the SS Indianapolis scene with the whales singing to each other in the background; which brings me to the sound, oh dear me, the sound, when that shark is on its way and the music tells you so, the sound in 7.1 is spine tingling, the hairs on your neck stand up, absolutely brilliant.<br />And as for the extras, well, we still get all the extras from the 30th Anniversary Edition, including the great Making Of, which ran at 1 hour and 40 minutes and I thought when I first saw that that it was brilliant, I loved all the behind the scenes information; however, the Blu Ray goes even further with another feature length doco called The Shark is Still Working. I thought it would be just more rehash from The Making Of; but oh how wrong I was - this doco alone is worth the upgrade, we get to see a lot more behind the scenes as well as getting to hear some current directors talk about how much of an impact this movie made on them and their careers; wonderful stuff.<br />So, as good as the DVD was; this Blu Ray treatment blows the DVD clear out of the water, it is most definitely worth the upgrade, it will be the best $20 you will ever spend on a movie and it is a movie that you can now introduce to the younger generation and do it some justice this time round.<br />Buy it, buy it now, tell all your friends to buy it, if you haven't got the money, go rob a bank, take hostages at gunpoint, do whatever you must do to own this amazing movie in this format; even go tell that old git down the road none of us can stand to go out and buy himself a copy today.<br />\\"Show me the way to go home; I'm tired and I want to go to bed; well, I had a little drink about an hour ago and it's gone right to my head, no matter where I roam, through land or sea or foam; you will always hear me singing a song; show me the way to go home...\\"<br />Jaws has just arrived.<br />Finally, she's home!<br />Shalom

B0083GQ2A0|4.0|The Grey was what I expected from Niam Leeson, and was fairly predictable. The end, however, left me feeling like it was unfinished. I understand what the director was going for, but nonetheless was not satisfying. Definitely a rental and glad I did not pay movie theater prices. Recommend watching.
B008XBCJ34|2.0|As much as I enjoy Cameron's visionary take on his films I'd have to say that Avatar is not his best work. In my opinion the storyline for Avatar is very, very similar to Dances with Wolves so I give Cameron a 1/2 point for originality. And honestly, Titanic was much more engaging for me than this film. Oh sure the 3D and special effects are without question cutting edge but that's about it. I can sit through Titanic many more times than I ever would though this lazy pile of artwork. Cameron should have given screenplay credit to Michael Blake. If you don't believe me compare the two films and see for yourself. On second thought Jimmy don't give Michael any credit. It surely must be an insult to take his wonderful novel idea and pepper it with flat, one-dimensional characters in some quasi-political correctness message.

B00000425R|4.0|Once upon a time there was this ensemble called I Musici, and they ruled the Italian Baroque scene. Their recording of the Corelli Concerti Grossi Op. 6 ruled the roost (not the current I Musici release, but the one with Felix Ayo and Walter Gallozzi). Characterized by tight ensemble work, good playing and a style that can best be described as heavy, driving, and tub thumping, it was a nice intro to some very influential music.<br /><br />In 1973, The Academy of St. Martin in-the-Fields under Neville Marriner recorded their version. A decidedly lighter weight recording (no tub thumping here), it experimented with several things.<br /><br />First, the over-all bowing by the strings was lighter and more separate, particularly in the fast movements. You would never confuse the Marriner recording with one performed on original instruments, but it marked quite a change from I Musici. Alan Loveday and Carmel Kaine handle the solo violin parts with ease.<br /><br />Second was the use of a diverse continuo section. Organ and harpsichord got mixed in the same piece, and theorbos were added. The keyboard continuo section was, shall we say, interesting: Christopher Hogwood (founded the Academy of Ancient Music), Trevor Pinnock (founded the English Consort), and Colin Tilney (who stayed a very good harpsichord soloist). Hogwood prepared the edition that gets played here.<br /><br />Third, they experiment with one instrument per part in the final four concerti of the set. This is a practice that's common now, but was somewhat revolutionary in 1973.<br /><br />Fourth, they experiment with the tempi. The finale, for example, of concerto 8 (the so-called Christmas Concerto) is marked \\"largo.\\" There is a real danger of taking this so slowly it disintegrates into mush. Not here. Largo means fast; you get a energetic shepherds' dance, outstripping even McGegan's Philharmonia Baroque recording.<br /><br />The overall sound and clarity of this recording isn't bad, but it is a product ofits earlier age. You buy this recording for historical interest, and because of the caliber of musicianship. It's still a very nice listen.
B000I52LUO|3.0|Too bad this movie is like a slow and dark version of fight club. Too bad because Christian Bale's acting job is absolutely incredible. Movie was WAY to predictable and obvious.

B00009R86L|3.0|The padding is ample and it sturdy and well made,  but this strap pad is also very heavy.  It weighed nearly as much as my messenger bag.  I purchased it to pad a narrow purse strap that would be used during many hours of sightseeing while traveling.  The foam shows too much to be used with a purse strap and still be considered stylish.  Other reviews say it is flexible, but it would probably fit a man's broader shoulder better than a smaller framed person.  The ends stuck out when I tried it.<br />I would only recommend for utilitarian purposes and when hauling heavy loads.  Made for large shoulders.

B001RJTFP4|5.0|Blade is a Daywalker. He is a Human with the powers of a vampire but he can be in the sun and he does not suffer from vampires weaknesses. Blade wants to kill all of the vampires he can find to protect mankind but to also seek revenge for the death of his mother who was bitten by a vampire, gave birth to him, then died. He is blessed with super strength, fighting skills, fast healing and enhanced senses but he struggles with his desire for human blood. He feels that if he drinks it than he is no better than the vampires themselves.<br /><br />Blade is on a mission to make the existence of vampires a thing of the past. He wants to kill as many as he can and it is his personal challenge to do so....<br /><br />This is a high action film and I really enjoyed it. Blade is played by Wesley Snipes and his martial arts skills just make this movie special. His partner, weapons maker and mentor is played by Kris Kristofferson who also does a good job of acting in his role. I liked this film as the special effects are good and the action fight scenes are spectacular.<br /><br />If you like vampire movies and action movies then this one is right up your alley. You should watch it as I believe you will enjoy it.<br /><br />My review is on the original DVD release.

B000P0J09C|5.0|During the Vietnam War, marine recruits are sent to boot camp to undergo training and be prepared to go to war in a foreign country. They face a Gunnery Sergeant who uses severe and cruel treatment to hammer the recruits into tough marines and ready to fight. One recruit in particular is a clumsy, slow to learn and does not do well in following discipline. His story is one of the first tragic stories in this movie.<br /><br />Another of the recruits winds up being a reporter for Stars and Stripes and he is assigned to go into battle with a marine squad. There his will and preparedness for battle is tested to its limits....<br /><br />This movie was directed by and produced by Stanley Kubrick. He also helped to co-write the script and it is one of his best movies. It is certainly one of the most dramatic movies I have ever watched and that starts at the boot camp scenes though the final battle scene. The movie features a good script with excellent acting from multiple actors. It even features some of the best depictions of the horror of war and the effect that it can have on people.<br /><br />This movie is ranked among the top ten war movies ever made and it deserves that ranking in my opinion. I strongly recommend it to you if you like war movies and seek realism in what our soldiers went through. This is also one of Stanley Kubrick's best films that he ever made. Buy it and watch it, you will not be disappointed.

We were very disapointed. The plot was horrible and confusing. The story was everywhere and the acting wasnt that great. I love every movie with Johnny, but I could almost not stand to even watch this. It was a train wreck from the start!! We almost walked out of the theater! Don't waste your time. It is nothing like the old shows and the plot really is bad!!

B00004YRQA|5.0|I highly recommend buying these memory cards. While most people would like to think that \\"more space equals better\\", keep in mind that Sony only makes 8mb and 16mb cards; anything else is third party and will cause reading issues or the inability to save first party games. With this memory card, it does exactly as you'd expect it to. Which would be saving games; and it's a reliable accessory.<br /><br />I won't go in depth with a review being that these cards are the best option for saving PS2 games even if you need to buy a few extra. The best part about it is they're priced alot better than Gamestop or your average video game store. (I purchased mine at under 5 dollars)

B0088X7YU0|2.0|Formula kill the bug rescue survivors and whatever you do keep them off the Earth.<br /><br />Looks like they could not afford to keep making pictures with people and needed to switch to cartoons. This could also make a good advertisement for a game.<br /><br />You can see that this was made after the films as it is more of an extension of the films than an attempt to recreate the original writing. They were able to completely strip the film of any original thought that that Robert A. Heinlein was trying to express.<br /><br />What is even weirder is the voice over commentary of the film where they say they are trying to be true to the book. However I suspect they only read the first film script and have no idea that there was a book.<br /><br />Bottom line better suits cheaper dialog with a Japanese feel.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0441014100 Starship Troopers]]

B003Y5HWK4|1.0|This is a great show just like Deadwood, Rome  and the Sopranos were.  My problem is trust.  After purchasing two seasons of Deadwood and five of the Sopranos, what did HBO do?  They cancelled Deadwood and never gave it a proper ending, they cancelled Rome after two seasons and the Sopranos ending was so bad I traded in the dvd's at a used bookstore and never bouight season six. My concern is after purchasing season 1 and season 2 and so on, will HBO just do what they did with Deadwood, Rome and the Sopranos and leave everyone hanging?  I will never waste my money on HBO dvds again.
B004SBQGHS|2.0|I tried to play this global phenomenon and just ended up getting bored with it. Actually plays exactly like those old trebuchet/catapult flash games from a decade or two ago except harder because you drag with your finger to set power and angle. There's a flimsy castle with knights and a king in it that you have to kill by hitting them and knocking over buildings they're in to win. I guess they innovated on that concept though. Just can't figure out why everyone goes so crazy over such a blah casual game. Maybe it's just popular with non-gamers.
