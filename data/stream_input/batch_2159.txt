B005LAIIFS|5.0|&#34;Easter bunny! Hop hop hop.&#34;<br />It was awesome in theaters the four times I went to see it. Now it can be part of my DVD collection along with the toy eggs that walk to steps and fall over.  :)
B001FB55H6|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie. It had a good story and I would recommend it to others. However this movie is a long one so if you watch this movie make sure you have plenty of time to do so.
B00881VLCE|1.0|I did really enjoy this app until one time I went to play it and the number of puzzle pieces decreased drastically! I would play with the most pieces, 233 I think, and now the most is like 42! please fix this I don't want to do little baby puzzles. if you fix I will rate 5 stars. thank you!
B005LAIH54|5.0|This was a good movie. It worked as a sequal to the crash of the titans remake, however some people complain about this movie because the original crash of the titans movie did not have a sequal.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I love falling asleep to the sounds :) they're so realistic sounding and I love that about it :). Also, you can create your own sounds to relax to. And, when you upgrade there's even more sounds to choose from!
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|This was a good movie, it is also the english version so I had no issue with whether I would be able to understand what was being said or not. I enjoyed this movie, although as with the swedish version there are some scenes that you probably would not want to see.
B007ED9FIY|4.0|I would recommend this movie. George Clooney and the girls who play his daughters are great in this story of a family facing the loss of their wife/mom.
0439023491|5.0|This was a good book, I enjoyed reading it. I would recommend thisbook to friends, family, or other people. Although some people complain about this series, saying it had run on sentences and was hard to keep up with. I had no problem keepng up with this series or reading this series. Plus you do not read books for grammatical correctness you read them for the story and I believe this series had a good story.

B005LAIGW8|4.0|The movie was good, however not everyone is a fan of Nicolas Cage so not everyone will enjoy this movie.
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|Jeffrey Archer scores again with another page-turning best-seller with the next book in the addictive Clifton Chronicles series. Archer is a consummate story teller and this series continues to display his skills in writing easy-reading and exciting family-based stories.  If you have read the first books in the series this one is a must-read. If not you will still enjoy it but it would help if you are able to read the other books first.<br /><br />Those of you who have read the first two books in the series will know that at the end of each one Archer leaves you with a cliff-hanger (I call them \\"Clifton\\" hangers) of an ending so you have to wait on tenterhooks for the next book in the series to be released find the answer.  At the end of \\"Sins of the Father\\" a tied vote in the House of Lords on whether Harry Clifton or his best friend Giles Barrington inherits the Barrington title and property has been left to the Lord Chancellor to decide.  All I can safely tell you is that the Lord Chancellor found this the most difficult decision in his career and he \\"would never admit, even to his closest confidant, that he changed his mind at the last moment.\\"<br /><br />Harry settles down to pursue a career as a best-selling detective novelist, while Emma goes in search of her illegitimate half-sister who was put into foster care when both her father and mother died after a fight. Giles Barrington pursues his career as Labour MP for Bristol with the slimmest of majorities.<br /><br />As usual Archer adds a few baddies to spice up things. Among them are Alex Fisher, who bullied Giles and Harry at school and nearly got Giles killed at Tobruk, and Lady Virginia Fenwick - a beautiful, aristocratic, gold-digging control-freak.<br /><br />The story moves to the next generation when Sebastian, the son of Harry and Emma, grows up and when he leaves school gets involved in the next \\"Clifton-hanger\\" ending where we have to wait for the next book to find out what really happened.<br /><br />I don't know if even Archer knows how many Chronicles are to come - he has only taken us to the mid 1950's so far and the next generation of Clifton's are only just starting to flap their wings.<br /><br />This book was released in Australia and the UK on 19 February 2013 but surprisingly will not be released in the US until 30 April.r />I don't know if even Archer knows how many Chronicles are to come - he has only taken us to the mid 1950's so far and the next generation of Clifton's are only just starting to flap their wings.<br /><br />This book was released in Australia and the UK on 19 February 2013 but surprisingly will not be released in the US until 30 April.

B00B04NJLW|4.0|The ABCs of Death is a horror anthology partially based on the Dark Forces novels and (of course) the classic ABCs children's books.  26 unique directors were given one letter of the alphabet each to create a short - some less than a minute short - horror film that must include at least one death.<br /><br />Because this film was an anthology it is difficult to rate the entire production without mentioning its individual parts.  So, without giving too much away I will highlight what makes this film great and what it lacks...<br /><br />A is for Apocalypse:  I can't give too much away with this one, other than we watch as a woman fails to kill her husband.<br /><br />B is for Bigfoot:  Very creepy, and very surreal.  A man and woman tell a young girl about a creature that tears the hearts out of children who do not mind their elders.<br /><br />C is for Cycle:  I really enjoyed this one, and can only say that it involves a man whose house is seemingly being invaded.<br /><br />D is for Dogfight:  This piece was interesting as it could be interpreted two different ways:  either the main character (a man) is fighting a dog for money, or the man is actually a dog and it is a genuine (illegal) dogfight.<br /><br />E is for Exterminate:  Here a man kills a spider that has been pestering him for days.  This one was just fun, and very reminiscent of many urban legends about insects that make their way into peoples brains through the ear.<br /><br />F is for Fart:  Yes, you read that right.  F is for Fart.  Oh, what can I say about this one except \\"What just happened?\\" this short was painfully bad and yet it was hilarious and worth watching over-and-over again.<br /><br />(As we go on with this review of the other lettered shorts I need to say that most of the films created by Japanese directors/writers were ridiculous and should not have been included in the overall anthology.  Most were pointless and more bizarre comedy than horror... F is for Fart was a Japanese made short, and thus ridiculous.)<br /><br />G is for Gravity:  After F is for Fart, G is for Gravity brought the movie back to its intended purpose:  to tell horror stories.  \\"G\\" was a very good story.  A man commits suicide in a very harsh and personal way.  It was shot POV (point-of-view) meaning we see what the character sees.  We also hear the character softly crying as he marches towards his suicide. Very good.<br /><br />H is for Hydro-Electric Diffusion:  Wow.  I could only term this short as a live-action-cartoon.  In it a female fox and a male dog - both, of course, dressed as a 1940's British Soldier (dog) and Nazi (fox) - have an epic battle that was both bizarre and rewarding for the viewer.<br /><br />I is for ________:  I'm not going to tell you what \\"I\\" stands for because you can only truly understand the short (which involves a woman being held hostage in a bathtub) after the title has been shown at the end of the film...  \\"I\\" was very poetic and very unnerving.<br /><br />J is for Jidai-geki:  Another Japanese one... I don't know what to make of it.  It was too cartoonish and too bizarre.  I'm not saying it was bad, just weird.<br /><br />K is for Klutz:  A woman's poop haunts her... `nuff said.<br /><br />L is for Libido:  A lot of the other reviewers of this film really hated this story.  They hated it because child molestation was strongly implied.  But, I did not hate it.  In fact it was one of my Short-List Favorites that I will include at the end of this review.  \\"L\\" told the story of a group of men who were kidnapped, and then forced to watch various sexual acts that ranged from erotic to sickening, all the while these men were forced to ejaculate to what they were watching.  The men were paired and the first man in a pair to ejaculate won, the loser was run through with a steel rod mechanically positioned at the bottom of the men's chairs.  Of course the men are being held against their will and are being watched by a group of masked (obviously wealthy) spectators.  Our \\"hero\\" is truly put to the test, as each display in front of him grows more and more terrifying.  I thought this piece was well thought out and ended just the way a horror story should end, unhappily.<br /><br />M is for ________:  Like \\"I\\" I'm not going to tell you what \\"M\\" stands for.  This was the shortest film in the anthology - one-minute maybe - and is self-explanatory once you know the title. It was fun and fast.<br /><br />N is for Nuptials:  I love this one!  Very funny ending, and a very cool concept.<br /><br />O is for Orgasm:  This was the one and only non-Japanese short to be weird.  It was very artistic, but still weird.<br /><br />P is for Pressure:  A poor woman is forced to make tough decisions to keep her family happy.  I am not squeamish but this one made me want to cover my eyes at one point.  Not because it was gory - and gore DOES NOT MAKE true horror - but because of what the woman did to earn a little cash.<br /><br />Q is for Quack:  Very meta and funny.  I won't try to explain it, but it's worth a watch.<br /><br />R is for Removed:  I honestly have a hard time remembering this one.  I do not understand what was going on, but it was creepy.<br /><br />S is for Speed:  Two women are on the run from a hooded creature, but is it a run worth making?  This one was surreal to begin and sad to end.<br /><br />T is for Toilet:  Rather than review this one I will supply a link to the full short that you can sample.  It is a claymation piece that plays on childhood fears of... potty training.  Here is the link:[...]<br /><br />U is for Unearthed:  A POV... we are witnessing a chase through a dark wooded area where every turn could mean the capture of our main character.  This is a great perspective piece that lets us perceive what are nightmares see.<br /><br />V is for Vagitus:  It is several years into the future and procreation has been banned.  One woman, an officer tasked with sterilizing and eradicating those who have propagated without permission finds a truth about herself.  I really liked this one, although it was more sci-fi than horror.<br /><br />W is for WTF?:  I think the title says it all.  And although the titles are not revealed until the end of each short you will be saying \\"WTF?\\" as soon as it begins.<br /><br />X is for XXL: An obese woman finds a way - a grizzly way - to make herself thin.  I really enjoyed this short and I believe that it may rank highest in my Short-List Favorites near the end of this review.<br /><br />Y is for Young Buck:  Creepy, and pure gross-out.  I won't go into detail but this one was very gross in parts.  Like \\"L\\" it involved some child molestation, but unlike \\"L\\" other reviewers seem to have no problem with it.<br /><br />Z is for Zetsumetsu:  There's no better way to end a good anthology than to end it with a bang!  Too bad we were left with \\"Z\\"... It was horrible.  Stupid. Pointless.  I was so disappointed that this Japanese disaster of a film was made to be the last short in the anthology.  As far as I could tell some nuclear blast hit japan and made mutants that enjoy making sushi.  Also there is a woman with a penis/sword.  Very disappointing.<br /><br />Okay!  We have formal knowledge of the short films and now we can give our approval or disapproval for the entire show.<br /><br />Horror is a tricky genre.  Those who don't understand it think it's all hack-and-slash and gory scenes of naked people covered in vomit.  Not so.  True horror is a story wherein someone overcomes or succumbs to fear.  It is a battle between good and evil wherein evil is often the victor.  Horror is the story of strength.  When you're telling a horror story you are inviting fear into the lives of your audience, what those people do with that fear is up to them and in essence feeling fear is to feel alive.  The ABC's Of Death offered up 26 stories for us to sample.  The goal when finishing a horror story is to walk away thinking \\"Wow, that was scary, and I'mstill a little nervous but I survived it and I maybe learned something new about death, or life, or how to persevere,\\" and I believe The ABCs of Death did that.  Mind you I do not believe they gave each letter a good story but they did create a majority of thoughtful nuggets of terror that I will not soon forget.<br /><br />Watch it alone, and then watch again with friends.  I think some of these shorts were meant to be discussed with a group.<br /><br />Finally my Short-List Favorites; the best-of-the-best (in my opinion) in the anthology:<br />X<br />U<br />I<br />L<br />P<br />S<br />Gitles are not revealed until the end of each short you will be saying \\"WTF?\\" as soon as it begins.

B0011Z7JRU|5.0|This has always been my favorite album by Led Zeppelin. Their extrodinary range of musical skills are clearly evident. I love the way they can incorporate concert music into some of the movements in this classic album.
1451695195|5.0|Read it in one day and even bought two other copies, one for my sister and one for my sister in law.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Although the physics/chemistry/biology/ lessons can be a bit tedious, this is a very entertaining story and the author has a real flair for character and dialog. I hope he writes again.
B004FN1T3A|4.0|I purchased this book in an effort to help/support my pregnant daughter.  One thing I did not expect was how calming it was to me as I read it.  It seems to be well thought out and researched.  I would recommend it to anyone who is either pregnant or a close family member of someone who is and wants to try natural childbirth.
B0094K1JPC|4.0|I liked the movie. It was a good story about bouncing back from failure. As a parent, I would say age 15 and above on this one, just because of some sexual relationship irresponsibility. Except for one hot make-out scene, everything else is innuendo. Rachel McAdams is adorable as always. Enjoyed the interaction between Harrison Ford and Diane Keaton. A few very funny moments throughout.
B001974DG0|5.0|For me it is one of his best.  I loved how  the characters, although quite different, come together to tell one story.  Lives intertwined some for good, one for evil.  Kept me reading to see next twist
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the story of an Irishman.  It made me feel sad at times, laugh out loud, and more compassionate for others.  It was a great read I won't forget.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Mystery, intrigue and karma all rolled into one.  Had seen the first movie before I read the book, wish it has been the other way around.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Challenging but not too hard.  I love the challenge of completing layouts in under five minutes.  Tiles are easy to read and layouts are challenging.  One of my favorite mahjongs so far.
B005IQZB14|3.0|I would give this book an average rating for being a \\"good read\\".  It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great.  Wild made for a better book club discussion than it did for reading pleasure (it got a high discussion rating from the group). I don't feel like I wasted my time reading this book, but if you have others on your \\"must read\\" list, dig your nose into those first!
B008476HBM|5.0|This is a must read for all Who enjoy romance.  On of the best love stories with none of the sex that defines a romance novel in the present.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|Exceptional service. Love the Kindle folks they are truly there to help and solve my problems. All customer service should be as good.
B001229HEK|5.0|Mastodon truly have a great feel for dark, strong music. If you are a fan of the genre you could use adjectives like &#34;beautiful&#34; and &#34;epic&#34; to describe their sound. This material drove me to pay for it. I wanted to &#34;own&#34; it. That is high praise I think.
B008EKON56|5.0|This LOD is simple and effective. I love the fact that the jack is positioned on the side of the connector instead of the bottom. It makes for a more compact and ergonomic experience. There's not a lot to this thing, so there's not a lot to say. It just works. I highly recommend it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I'm hoping for 30 seasons.  please keep the writing strong.  I love this show and would hate for it to get cheesy.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A story to make you believe in God indeed. This book truly makes you think about faith, love, and mortality.

B0027MJU00|4.0|Flynn has a way to hook the reader onto her books , the mysteries in her books hunt you until you find out what is going on!
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I like it but it's just so hard to knock down some of those obstacles!  I haven't gotten too far in the different  levels.  But the grandkids like it.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I know that we've seen this statement time and again for silly accessories such as this. But for a minor little investment. You can protect your expensive Plantronics Voyager and Voyager Legend headsets.<br /><br />As part of my job I travel pretty heavily, and I have to transit through various transportation security points on a frequent basis. Most of these security points require the removal of most articles on your clothing, and that includes your Bluetooth headsets. Most the time I throw the headset into my roll along bag. And not infrequently, unfortunately I have broken the headset, typically at the swivel that contains the earpiece and the microphone. Call it a Plantronics design flaw, if you will. It gets a little tiresome to have to replace the headset because you broke it at the swivel.<br /><br />I was getting pretty desperate, the Voyager headset is typically about $100 US. So the breaking of the headset is not cheap. Using this silly little carry case, I can protect the device as I transit the various security checkpoints, from being broken as a result of being thrown into my roll aboard case. There's an added vantage of the device being larger and easier to find in the case when I need to retrieve it.<br /><br />The case is leather with a magnetic closure, which is more than adequate for my needs. It worked with my Plantronics Voyager Pro (the battery died) and now it works with the Plantronics Voyager Legend; they both have about the same form factor and volume to fit in the case. The sides of the case are somewhat rigid, which allows for the protection of the device within the case.
B008B37CB8|5.0|Frank Zappa's 1966 debut album with the Mothers of Invention is an absolute masterpiece. This hour long musical journey taps the public consciousness with lyrics that depict what is wrong with our society. Some 47 years later, a lot of what's said on this album still holds true today. This satirical album is told through a variety of musical genres, such as R&B, rock, psychadelic, pop, alternative, spoken word with sound effects, and just plain undefined stuff. This album was so influential that the Beatles modeled their legendary Sgt. Peppers album after this album, saying that Sgt. Peppers was \\"The Beatles' Freak Out.\\" Now, for the songs: The album starts off with a solid straight up rock piece, HUNGRY FREAKS DADDY. The second track (I AIN'T GOT NO HEART) sounds like Cream, though this album debuted 6 months before Cream's first album. Next, we have the strange track WHO ARE THE BRAIN POLICE? This song is pure psychadelic, with strange lyrics. For those who like the more mainstream stuff, check out MOTHERLY LOVE, HOW COULD I BE SUCH A FOOL, ANYWAY THE WIND BLOWS and WOWIE ZOWIE. Then there's the bizarre and funny HELP I'M A ROCK. For the ultimate cap off, there's the iconic THE RETURN OF THE SON OF MONSTER MAGNET. This song has everything going on in it, with very cool sound effects. The remastering of the album has produced a superior product, with music this old sounding like it came out today. Freak Out is one of the greatest albums of all time, and should be in everyone's collection.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This app is good and a ton of fun to play with, but after a while it gets a little boring.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|A fun and challenging game. It becomes challenging quickly and is never boring. I highly recommend this game for those who like puzzles.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is an awesome app! ye ye ye ye ye ye ye ye ye ye good stuff! Makes me hard.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a good app for my kindle fire hd.<br />It shows you what is draining your battery<br />And how much of a charge you have. And what<br />You can do with what is left of your battery.<br />There is a paid version, but this works great.<br />And is free.
B0015DWJX2|4.0|The book started a little slow, and I did not realize until I was into it that although it is a novel, it describes the trivals of those on Guernsey during the occupation.  I was then captivated by the interaction of the people who became real.  I like something that is historical but not dry history presented in facts only.  BJ
1468179993|4.0|While brief, this book contains a lot of information about the key points presenters have used in creating memorable TED talks.  The author has obviously spent a lot of time and effort not only watching TED talks, but analyzing them to see what makes them great.  It is a good read for any presenter or person looking to improve their public speaking.<br /><br />The only qualm I have about it is that, as far as I know, the author, while having a lot of public speaking experience, has not actually given a TED talk.  For people that are actually preparing for a TED talk, they may be disappointed.  I feel the author could have compensated for this by interviewing some of the people that he mentioned in the book for tips from them personally what they did to prepare and deliver their speeches.<br /><br />But overall, it's a book that contains helpful information for any type of presenter.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|I was anxious to see the movie after I read the book. The movie was very disappointing and I really preferred the book. The book ties up a lot of loose ends.
B007N8RULO|2.0|Annoying ads between every game. Game is fun but ads are vexing. First game I downloaded kept locking up so I downloaded this version and got annoying ads<br /><br />.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Very helpful program. The different tile layouts are enjoyable. I love being able to select the playing mode which will give me the most pleasure.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|While Meryl did a good job acting, I couldn't get into the movie.  Guess I really didn't know as much as I thought about Margaret Thatcher!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game I am obsessed with it!!!!!!!!! I play it every day I know you are thinking I crazy but I am not k??!!!!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Such a good movie that I watched it twice during the rental time.  I luv Clint Eastwood and was not disappointed in this recent movie.  Amy Adams also very good!
B006FTC6ZC|4.0|I enjoyed several of the 'Tudyk' moments. Had a few good laughs. Definitely worth a watch on a rainy afternoon.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The game has two different modes, both are a lot of fun.  I've actually become somewhat addicted, so my only complaint about the game is that it's impossible to stop playing! I am a 9 to 5-er and I had been playing one night and realized it was 3am.  No bueno.  But again, the game is super fun.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Full of suspense keeping you engaged and reading on. Keeps you wondering from start to finish. Cannot wait to read next book.
037571457X|4.0|I am an English tutor.  Many of the people I help are Arabic.  When you deal with any culture, it is inevitable that difficulties will arise due to cultural differences.  It is worse, though, when there are political difficulties between your country and theirs.  Naturally, both sides are going to have prejudices. To better understand the people I deal with, I have been trying to familiarize myself with the cultures that I come into contact with.  This is why I chose this book.<br /><br />It is a graphic novel.  However, though the pictures might attract younger readers, I should warn anyone who is purchasing books for their child that it is probably more appropriate for teens.  It depends, of course, on how much parents protect their child and how willing they are to answer questions.  Though the book isn't  exactly &#34;snuff&#34; (meaning it focuses totally on violence and killing), it doesn't shy away from the violence that the author witnessed or heard about.  There is one picture that shows a man urinating on another man (as a form of torture).  There are references to torture, dismemberment, and rape. Another picture showed how the army locked a bunch of people inside a movie theater and set fire to it.<br /><br />All that aside, this is mostly a book about a girl growing up in Tehran, Iran during the Islamic Revolution.  The story starts in 1979-1980, when she is ten years old.  It concludes when she is fourteen years old (though there is a sequel book after this one).  It has a very strong plot and provides interesting tidbits about Islamic culture.  Iran has had a tumultuous history that is rather hard to keep track of.  However, this was particularly interesting because some of the events were ones I heard about when I was a child growing up.  It provides another viewpoint on the same events--such as Saddam Hussein's campaign against Iran.  There is also some nostalgia, as the girl had a fascination with American culture of that period. Though some of thethings depicted are disturbing--moreso because the book is visual--it has its moments of humor.  The author successfully humanizes the characters so you can identify and sympathize with them to some degree.<br /><br />I did enjoy the book, and I would recommend it to older readers who are interested in learning about other cultures.  If you like &#34;coming of age&#34; stories, you will probably like this too.  Be warned that it won't always made you feel good, and it may be inappropriate for young people and sensitive people.  However, it is a good book--and I plan to keep it, as well as buy the sequel.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|One of the best movies I've.  This movie is funny and the actors/actresses are very talented and upbeat.  I enjoy watching them sing their own creative versions of newer songs.

B0000TB01Y|2.0|When I listened to this music I was disapointed. Many other have said that they think that this is great. Guess it's just not my cup of tea. H. Cooke.
B0095VPBM2|5.0|I am actually a AMD person for starters . Always had Intel and once I switched to AMD ( better for video work and gaming) I have been sold This is my Second APU . I put this in my sons computer he is a Minecrafter and its FLAWLESS for what he uses this system for . Why spend big bucks for other high cpu's when you can upgrade mobo, and cpu for less than $100 ...<br />If you are looking for a simple upgrade and want power with out breaking the bank BUY IT !

0439023491|5.0|great book! Takes the continuation of the story to a new place. Don't miss this! Even if you've seen The Hunger Games movie, you will experience so much more when you read this series!
B003WUYRGI|1.0|20 Straight days of reading for NOTHING....Yawn. Whoever made this should be ran over. Not that I'm thinking about that, hehehe
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Super ending to this series! I wanted it to go on and on! So obsessed! Can't wait for the movies!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|This is one of the most enjoyable books I've read in a long time.  I need a light hearted pick-up after the holidays and this story did it.  Yet, there is some substance to be found in it about loneliness, friendships and aging.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|This is the first comic I have ever read, and boy am I glad that it was this one.  It may be slightly different from the show, but that doesn't hold back any of it's awesomeness.
B001QURA7E|5.0|I have always have been a YES fan - always will be  If I recall correctly this was the album on which Rick Wakeman rejoined the fold. Great music.
B000OVLINI|5.0|this novel, if you skim through it, is just another mystery about few lost people and the lives they lived and the words they left behind. this novel, however, doesn't let you skim through it. it grabs you by the neck, takes you deep inside a Post-civil war Barcelona, and doesn't really let you leave. it makes time go faster, and it makes you think \\"i'll just read a few more pages and then sleep\\" and then lets you hear the early birds chirping the next time you come up for a breath.<br /><br />this is a novel that starts with the hero finding a lost book- and while the suspense is maintained for every page of the 500 plus pages book, with revelations and new secrets garnishing the dark platter- the book is so much more than a simple mystery-thriller.<br /><br />people, all the critics were, for once, right. this is a book of the kind legends are made of. the dark mood persisting through the whole novel doesn't get crass, it only adds weight to the tale of tragedies and destruction and fires and ashes the writer weaves like a master.<br /><br />this is one book not to be missed.
B0044JTISS|5.0|Their swansong and one of my favorites of theirs. I never owned the album until I saw a documentary about the making of this album - then had to have it even though I have most if it on one collection or another. Excellent.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I loved it. A ton of emotions in one book. Made me laugh, cry, and feel as if I was in the story.
B00AAAJG2S|5.0|A lot of people don't think of musicianship or simply great guitar, bass, drum or vibe playing along with great vocals. Fraks plays with the tightest bands around and they all shine on this one. Laughter is an added bonus. Buy it.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I was first introduced to &#34;Game Of Thrones&#34; books by a friend who knew that I would like them. At the time I didn't know that it was a series on HBO. I enjoyed the books so much that I just had to watch them brought to life on the screen. I could not have been more pleased. The production values are major motion picture quality. I am currently reading book 5 and am looking forward to purchasing season 2.
B0018ARNR4|5.0|Great music. What can you say about the Doors that hasn't been said already? Excellent songwriting, musicality, creativity, trendsetting - it's all there.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Love the DPI changes on the fly.  Great for switching from gunning or flying to sniping in the span of a few clicks.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Dave Grohl is a genius. If you are a fan of music, particularly rock, this is must see. Can't wait to get the album!
0307352145|5.0|Excellent look into the world of introverted people.  Loved the insight into how to control the aprehensiveness associated with stressful situtations.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|As with other Jack Reacher stories, it is fast moving, an easy read, and doesn't get bogged down in manusa.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|IT ALWAYS LETS ME KNOW WHERE I STAND WITH MY POWER. I HAVE COME TO RELY ON IT FOR ACCURATE INFORMATION.
B00B0ZT9NI|3.0|Ho Hum. Another one of these type of films. We have seen it too many times before. Take a true story, completely revamp the truth for dramatic license, make sure Ben delivers an understated performance, because a lot of movie goers still haven't made up their minds about him yet. Get a good supporting cast, raise the tension at the right times, and there ya go! LET'S GET HARRY! PART 2. AN HBO PRESENTATION! It's watchable, but most certainly no Oscar contender.
0316224588|5.0|Former Detective Inspector John Rebus refuses to take his gold watch and fade into the sunset. Instead of passing the time in a retirement community, going fishing, or playing golf, he lives alone, smokes innumerable cigarettes, drinks too much alcohol, and makes a pest of himself at the Serious Crimes Review Unit of the Lothian and Borders Police. The SCRU's remit is to look into cases involving \\"the long dead, murder victims forgotten by the world at large.\\" Like Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch, Rebus is a maverick from the old school. When all else fails, he bends the rules and cleverly manipulates people in order to get the desired results. Unlike Harry, Rebus is a civilian, although he has applied for reinstatement to the force, much to the consternation of his harshest critic at the Office of Ethics and Standards (\\"the Complaints\\"), Malcolm Fox.  Suddenly, Rebus is right back in the thick of things when a teenager vanishes near the A9, the same road where a number of other young women have disappeared over the past dozen years.<br /><br />Rebus goes his own way regardless of the consequences.  He is a solitary, irreverent, and driven individual who has a wry and wicked sense of humor. He is not easily fooled, behaves imprudently, is cheeky to his superiors, and relies on the \\"gut instinct\\" that all great investigators possess. He is also immature, obsessive, and inept at interpersonal relationships.  Small wonder that Rebus decides to fill his ancient Saab with petrol and drive all over Scotland interviewing witnesses, hunting down clues, and even chatting with felons in order to learn the truth.  DI Siobhan Clarke, who has much to lose and little to gain by assisting Rebus, trusts him enough to stick her neck out for him.  As a result, Clarke and Rebus close in on someone who may have committed unspeakable crimes.<br /><br />Ian Rankin's \\"Standing in another Man's Grave\\" is another strong entry in a consistently engrossing series.  The setting, dialogue, and character delineation are all first rate; Rankin's use of colorful Scottish slang (\\"to get one's jotters\\" means to be fired) gives the story extra zest.  Although we sympathize with Rebus's tenacity and determination to use unconventional methods in order to flush out a clever and cagey villain, his unorthodox behavior makes us wonder:  Is it ever wise to skirt the law in order to catch criminals who would otherwise escape punishment?  There are compelling arguments on both sides, and we are left to decide for ourselves what we would do in Rebus's shoes. This compelling police procedural grows in intensity until its riveting conclusion leaves us wondering just where the truth really lies.haracter delineation are all first rate; Rankin's use of colorful Scottish slang (\\"to get one's jotters\\" means to be fired) gives the story extra zest.

B00AFEXRME|5.0|There have been 4 great portrayals of an alcoholic on film. THE LOST WEEKEND - RAY MILLAND; DAYS OF WINE & ROSES - JACK LEMMON; UNDER THE VOLCANO - ALBERT FINNEY; and Denzel's performance in this film. A complex and dark character, who at the same time, still warrants our sympathy. We cant help but root for him, even though we know, he will eventually succumb, to that next drink. The ending, although a bit Hollywoodish, is really the only acceptable ending this film could have had. Master Director Robert Zemekis' grand return to live action film making, and another Oscar worthy, and understated performance, from our finest living american actor.
B000JBWWBK|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I purchased it to have on hand whenever I want to see a sophisicated and charming movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game my sis plays it all the time so I use it to keep her busy. [[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B009SJ3GUK|2.0|Ha...  Okay, someone complained about my review... so, I'll be less specific.  It's a crappy show.  SAVE YOUR MONEY...<br /><br />Happy now?<br /><br />~~~~~Edited Original Review~~~~~<br />We were wondering what they were going to do for Season 2 after so many odd things happened in Season 1<br /><br />Season 2 has an odd spanking / sadistic streaking that just isn't our bag...  Might be yours (no judgement!)...  We didn't get past episode 4 or so...<br /><br />Love Jessica Lang, but a little too much sadism overall...
B0053TMP24|5.0|This book is really good for young adults who want a real adventurous book. Make sure to read the Lost Hero first though.
0802473156|5.0|This book is wonderful. It really helped my marriage! I read it first then my husband!  A must read! Worth the money!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This book is real good for young adults who are looking for a real adventurous book. Make sure to read the entire series.
B000SEI230|5.0|This book is incredible and heartwarming. By the end I was bawling. Jamie is such an amazing person and the way she moves people is inspiring. I truly recommend this book.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie will win the Oscar!! My husband and I missed it at the theater so we were so glad to find it on Amazon. Loved it!!
B008NW67E0|5.0|This album is a lot of fun from start to finish. If you like Mumford already, you should love it.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|Just like buying from Apple only getting it delivered, which is great because I am 2 hours away from the nearest Apple Store.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|this is not an important film...it IS a fun, Glee-style romp that acapella lovers will really enjoy A big thumb's up from this acapella junkie
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am a big fan of this game and I'd like to put ideas for adding blocks to your game. A few ideas are ice blocks, painted wood plank blocks  for if players want to build houses with, more styles for torches, and for those slabs some sideways slabs like this / but more strait, and any ideas you can think of. I hope you can consider thinking about this do  the players of Minecraft.<br /><br />  Sincerely,<br />A happy customer
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love this game I got it for my little sis she loves it too down load the best game ever!!!!!!
B005EWDA3I|4.0|I guess that the first two parts were better, the ending seems a little blad but still worth reading it.
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|This is one app that my 2 year old will keep coming back to. This and other Dr. Panda apps never get boring for her.
B005ERYEGU|5.0|Very Practical, great simple pithy guide.  Could be used as a manual but easy to read.  Definitely worth reading if you need any type of lead generation function.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|this is awesome and epic for adventure lovers I love it I love i love it I love it it rocks
B00028HBKM|5.0|We bought this the past year for our kids to see just how much suffering Jesus endured for us.  The church readings are pretty sanitized and you do not understand how vicious the scourging of prisoners was.  Once kids are of the age they can handle the graphic nature of the whips with the jagged metal pieces in them I recommend they see it.  It puts them on an entirely new level of understanding what was given up for us.  Mel Gibson has his detractors but this is a great piece of work as many of his other works such as 'The Patriot.' Ironic that it took an Australian to make one of the best movies about the American Revolution.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|If you suspend disbelief about how present day behaviors were so common in previous centuries, Follett's books are greatly entertaining and educational. The emphasis on early feminism and some hyper-sexual practices was difficult to believe.
B006LSZECO|4.0|While what starts out as a fun read turns unexpectedly dark, Gone Girl is an intelligent, layered, well-crafted story worth reading.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I wasn't sure I would like this it looked kinda cheesy. Once you get started its hard to stop. I have looked up at the clock and noticed it was much later than I thought. You'll love it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|love this game lots of fun hope i find more games like this one and all my friends play along
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Great series.  A new take on the old Merkin and King Arthur story that has been told so many times.  Suspenceful and funny at the same time.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Predictable plot line, comedic timing always seemed just off, a profuse amount if vulgarity to make up for pathetic jokes... Sorely disappointed since I love markie mark and had sen all the hype attached to this movie
B0042816YK|5.0|Great Movie, what a ride through life.  Felt it followed teh book closer than other novals with movie spinoffs.  A must see for those who read the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is awesome game you jump you slide you do a whole bunch of things this is way better than temple run.
B005Y423ZC|2.0|I could hear her getting fatter as the songs progressed.  At times it sounds like she is chewing and trying to swallow a whole Ham
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|superb acting with excellent development of story line. Although the ending of season three was a bit over the top.
B00AKKTDJY|4.0|Enjoy like diner dash but there is a glitch in the kindle version doesn't always credit you with money earned on some shifts
B007SYWFRM|5.0|AWESOME!! My daughter loves it. She has played it al  lot of times and still is still not bored of it
B004GVUPFE|5.0|This game is educational since it deals with spatial relationships!  It's also lots of fun and hard to put down!
B007IXWL2C|3.0|was interesting but a  little racy hard to believe people really practice such sexual practices in this day and age.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Handy size, sharpens nicely, can be carried on a key chain, [I'm using up characters and words now] I recommend the item.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love that game i love tthat game i love ttthat game.oooo i only learned to play it today and i already an expert but still challenging. kooooooooll
B0044IABFS|5.0|The story itself was heart breaking and full of suspense. I got to know each character and what to expect from each. Michael was my favorite along with the Doc. I could watch it again. Never boring , could not wait to continue with each episode. Everyone needs to see.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|I love how each person wrote there own! I would read it again and again fantastic book love it<br />GET IT
0345803507|5.0|Delivered on time; great reading!  I can't wait for the movie version; hope it's true to the books!  I would recommend this trilogy for the men as well!
B005J4A8AY|3.0|In the advertisements they are advertised as a Canadian version &#34;Tin&#34;  Well the tin turns out to be cardbvoard which was a bit of a disappointment
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|The concept and storyline seems to be good.<br />The acting is also good.<br />The movie is just too slow and seems to take forever.<br />At times it is very confusing for some people who don't pay attention.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|True to Baldacci's style, more turns than a mountain road. Set aside some alone time when reading this book 'cause you will have a hard time putting it down. Well Done David!
B00AYB0SX4|2.0|If you have nothing else to do you might want to watch this.<br />Its not very good.<br />The end is a little different and you don't see it coming.<br />Overall probably not worth paying money to see.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The first 100 pages were a bit full of info, but once I got passed that, it was quite a page-turner and I really enjoyed it.
098555780X|5.0|There are some great design ideas in the book.<br />Well worth the investment.<br />The author presents the material in a very flowing format.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Rating: 4 stars (above average)<br /><br />It was hard to be objective about this book, because I loved it for its content, reflecting my own experiences with gaming and early computers, movies, music of the era. \\"If I was feeling depressed or frustrated about my lot in life, all I had to do was tap the Player One button, and my worries would instantly slip away....\\" It's called Flow experience and, like the main character, I would play adventure and puzzle games all night and then try to go to work during the day (as an addict, I eventually had to go cold turkey).<br /><br />But reviews have to adddress things like plot, setting, characters, dialog. Setting? Great. Very believable, both the real world and the OASIS universe. Characters? The book has the standard range of sexes, ethnicities, life styles. Someone for every reader to identify with. Appealing though; I just had to root for the white hats. Plot? Every geek's dream--play the game and find the goal. Dialog was stereotypically adolescent. Note to author: not all of us geeks talk like prepubescent social misfits.<br /><br />The main character's thoughts about being human (when he realizes he is an anti-social hermit trapped in a player rig) and about the existence of God are set out early on, and the author does not belabor his viewpoints. Such restraint is admirable; his philosophy adds to the psychological setting of the story but does not require the reader to agree with him.<br /><br />Plot drags at times, gets too descriptive (but how else to convey a visual/tactile experience?).<br /><br />If you remember the TRS-80, audiocassette recorders, dot-matrix printers, and 300 baud modems, instantly you'll have a feeling of familiarity. Do you still have the telephone numbers for dial-up bulletin boards?<br /><br />Despite its flaws (Deus Ex Machina too often), this book is interesting and fun. Hacker skillz rock!
0316227706|5.0|Dog people will love this and even non-dog people will find it fascinating.  Makes me want to take my dog swimming just to see what she looks like. (It will never happen.)
B00846F1YW|3.0|It was fun. I like hidden object games. My only issue with them is the replay ability of them. Don't have much in that aspect but it has a decent story and the puzzles start easy and increase in difficult but don't get too hard to where you get frustrated.
B009EP3DJM|4.0|First off, I do own both previous albums by Ke$ha and while I enjoy listening to her pop club-style hits it never felt like something that was fresh. I have listened to this album a few times now (I waited reluctantly to purchase, I wasn't expecting to like it) and I have to say this is pretty amazing! It definitely has some of the \\"trashy\\" lyrics she is known for, but the album as a whole seems to be, dare I say, quite intelligently written as well as delightfully catchy. If I had to pick out a few of my favorite tracks I would say 'C'mon' 'Last Goodbye' 'Gold Trans Am' 'Crazy Kids' and 'Thinking of You' though this could all change tomorrow, I haven't found a song in particular that I would skip.
B009EEFTMC|4.0|Game is simple and fun. Very similar to mahjong. The puzzle mode is fairly easy but good for getting quick with the game. The Cube Attack mode is very fun and fast paced. Second you falter on it, they build outta control.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|Packaging and contents even better than the original issue in 1969! Faithful stereo reproduction - still breaks my heart that Eric Clapton played the guitar solo on &#34;Weeps&#34;, but it's still great guitar!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I read the first book for my book club and fell in love.  It was such a wonderful piece of historical fiction.  The second book had me hooked within the first two pages.  I'm half way through and don't want it to end! I can't wait for the third and final book.  I highly reocommend this trilogy.
B007D5E7C2|4.0|Disc 2 had a few &#34;skips&#34; in the electronic reproduction. :(  Totally enjoyed the movies - Tarantino one of my very favorites.
B003AVPV1O|5.0|This is a heavy little thing. Read the description. It takes one VGA signal and puts the same exact image on two monitors. Don't expect that you are going to be running dual monitors with differ content on each with this. That's not what it is for.<br /><br />I use my computer to stream web content. Using this I can send the shows to my tv too. My couch is way more comfy than my desk chair.<br /><br />Works as expected. Thanks!
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this!  Enjoy the different types of plays....I'm. addicted!  Have downloaded other solitaire apps but this is the only one I seem to play!!
B000002HJD|5.0|I had the original record but lost it in a fire...............so glad to be able to get it on CD!  Anyone who loves the Doors can't  help but love this album.  Of course I love them all.........the Doors are absolutely one of the best!  Great price, great music...........what more could you want?!
B00BGD07KS|5.0|I purchased this song because I am thoroughly excited about the movie Oz The Great and Powerful and I wanted to know what the song would be like especially with Mariah Carey singing it and I have to say that it is just AMAZING and wonderful and I completely enjoyed it.  I listen to it just about everyday as I sing along to it.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Frankly, I think the idea of this show is brilliant.  The bringing together of all of our favorite fairytales and their characters and creating one story around them is fantastic.  Portraying it with wonderful adventure and a great script makes it addictive.  Love is the central theme and keeps me coming back for more.
B002FQOI0A|5.0|The mystery was very well thought out and I loved this book so much, I couldn't put it down! Beautiful writing, and it has you at the edge of your seat! Definitely a must read!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is unexpectedly (I've personally never been a zombie fan) my husband's and my favorite show.  The writing is phenomenal and the characters believable.  Season 3 is the best season yet, with the antagonist of The Governor being introduced to bring what would seem to be some real evil to the screen.  Very exciting and only gets better!
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I downloaded it on my Kindle Fire, but couldn't play it. I don't know why. Do you need a Kindle HD for it to work? I finally deleted it - just not worth trying to figure it out.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Every song on this CD is good.  My teenage children, wife and I all listened to the songs on this album and couldn't say there was one bad song.  There is something for everyone.
143353083X|4.0|The book arrived promptly and in good shape, although somewhat loose in the box. Did not fully realize how small the book and corresponding text font was, but understand this due to the amount of data contained within. Good supporting graphics and explanatory text. Very satisfied with content but am not sure how well the binding will hold up under continual use. No complaints, however; would opt to spend a few more $$ and get the hardback book the next time around.
B00AGKHFCA|5.0|Once again, he can do no wrong.  Mr. Bochelli continues to amaze and better himself with each new recording.  You will be sorry if you don't purchase &#34;Passione.&#34;
B002PEP4SC|3.0|It was an easy read, enjoyable and entertaining but the language and plot was just like the tv show. I didn't mind that it was so much like the show because I watch it and love it but don't necessarily need to buy the books because it is redundant.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|This was by far the most mind numbingly stupid movie I have ever seen. I made it through about thirty minutes before turning it off. It wasn't funny at all. What a waste.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Nicholas sparks has done it again. America's love literary delivers again with Safe Haven. A story of true vulnerability and security, Sparks shadows the essence of courage and the inspiring strength it takes one to move forward, no matter the risk or cost. Encompassing love, danger, and suspense, Safe Haven comes to life cementing Sparks's next great scripture. A must read for any.
B00867GKIK|5.0|My grandkids had never seen this movie and I thought they would enjoy the whole idea of a house floating in the sky by balloons.They loved it as much as I do. They only got to see it in 2D but one day they'll get the chance to view it in 3D as it was intended to be seen.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book was so exciting. If you have read the Maze Runner, then you're gonna love this just as much. <3 Dashner's series!!!
B007PVHMCG|4.0|This was a bit pricey but my grandson loves it. He came up with a little game to play with it. He hides Lego guys inside and granny has to find them,
0307460444|3.0|I guess when it comes to anything edible, the bottom line is that personal preference plays a huge role.  I have been baking for almost 30 years, so I tend to be a bit picky when it comes to those unique recipes that make it to my go to favorites.  Unfortunately, nothing in this book is a keeper for me.<br /><br />I really wanted to love the recipes in this book.  I mean, lets face it, who wants to invest time and money only to be disappointed with the end result?  Unfortunately, that's the exact experience I had.  The problem with the recipes I tried, is that they were overdone in all aspects.<br /><br />First I tried the chocolate chip cupcakes with dark chocolate frosting.  In my opinion, 1 cup of chocolate chips would have been more than enough compared to the 1&1/2 cups called for.  I could barely taste the cake itself.  When taking a bite I bit into a mouth full of chips.  Another problem with this recipe is that it called for 5 egg whites which made the cake dry out just hours after baking, and speaking of baking, the amount of egg whites made this cake extremely delicate.  Way too delicate for the 20 minute bake time that was called for.  15 minutes tops if your oven runs true to temp.<br /><br />Now, for the dreaded frosting.  I could write a page on that alone, but for the sake of moving on I will just say yuk!  Too heavy, too rich, and too bitter.  The 1/4 cup of butter was completely lost in the massive amount of semi sweet chips and cocoa powder called for.  The entire cupcake was an overdone chocolate mess.<br /><br />The next recipe I tried was the vanilla buttermilk cupcake.  I am always in search of a basic vanilla.  Again, way overdone.  5 eggs plus 2 yolks???  Is she kidding me?  I knew it was a disaster as I was making it, but it was to late to turn back.  How can you add 7 egg yolks to delicate cake flour and expect to taste vanilla.  The result was exactly what I expected.  Instead of tasting a vanilla cupcake, I bit into an egg yolk cupcake.<br /><br />I did try more recipes, and I could go on and on about what I found wrong with them but I feel like I got my point across.<br /><br />I gave the book three stars because even the worst books have bits and pieces of useful information.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Great ending to a great series. Another series begins after it called &#34;Heroes of Olympus&#34; and I suggest that as well. Very fun read.
B003U53GK8|5.0|My wife and I had never really watched Lost in its heyday because each episode led to the next, so when we decided to watch all episodes, we found out how much we truly enjoyed the show.  Being to watch all season of Lost was very enjoyable and we would highly recommend this show and product to anyone
B00280LYIM|4.0|This guy is a very good writer and all of his books are very entertaining. I've moved on to the &#34;Heroes of Olympus&#34; series and it's just as good.
0446343129|5.0|I read this book years ago and needed to read it again.  I need to be reminded about it's sugar message.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|..to a new series. A lot of the same characters as &#34;Percy Jackson and the Olympians&#34; series, but also a lot of new people. Very fun read.
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|This album is a fatastic representation of love and passion. This is one of Andrea Bocelli's best albums by far.
0446547573|1.0|While I do enjoy Nicholaus Sparks's books, this book is the exact same story as the 1991 movie \\"Sleeping with the Enemy\\" starring Julia Roberts. Sorry, but Mr. Sparks looses tons of points for stealing the storyline.  Not impressed.
B002M9WW30|4.0|I bought this for my father's birthday. The order arrived in good time. The price was very reasonable for all six in the collection. Bought this in blue-ray because it was so much cheaper than dvd. Since he still hasn't gotten his new blue-ray machine connected, I'm not sure if they work. But bought them new, so I don't expect a problem.
B00466HN6S|4.0|It was delivered within the specified time.  I would have given it a perfect<br />rating, except it needed to be cleaned before it would play all the way through.<br />After cleaning, the movie worked fine.
B003L77GG0|5.0|SO sad to see the series go but atleast they had a plan and did not disapoint me at all.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was amazing alot different then the movie but that's a good thing  it gives more detail can't wait to read book two and three
B0070UFMOW|1.0|I ordered two of these in the last week. Both gave a flashing read light and would not charge. It worked plugged in and worked well. But I got this to have a portable amp on the go. Quality control seems to be a big problem at this company of late. Pretty lame because I like the product a lot.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Just like the game it is Drawsome it never glitches and it's really fun and sometimes challenging I love this game
B005COO1X6|5.0|Stephen King.. Never A Disappointment. A Master @ What He Does. Ready For The Next Book On My List Of Stephen King.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Narration is beautiful. Suzanne Collins knows how to sustain this compelling and riveting story without loosing beat of mockingjay melody.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|August comes alive in the pages of his story. I found this to be a sad yet sweet and redeeming story of strength and acceptance.
B000SEFNMS|5.0|As expected the author delivers fantastic writing that really takes you along the journey. Not a dispassionate non fiction account but a narrative that really gets under your skin.
B00ANDPGJE|5.0|Saw the original on PBS years ago & loved it.  Saw recent airling on BBC-America & still find Mr. Richardson's portrayal absolutely as wonderful as I remembered.  I look forward to watching the U.S. version with Spacey because of the story & the actor.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The book defiantly did not end the way I thought it would. Still a good book. The whole series was good.
B007SY3CEW|3.0|Compared to other piano apps this one is better produced and sounds more realistic. The reason I'm giving this only 3 stars is because while it is fun to play, the fun factor doesn't last long because there is so few goods songs to play. Out of the 30 preloaded songs there are only 19 that are actually playable on a cellphone. The rest are either too fast or require you to press 2 to 3 key chords. The developers need to put out more playable songs on a more consistent basis.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this can I find it a little better then the old one. its more exiting and also the graphics are better.another thing is the gems are cool and the opsticals are amazing. last is the mines are the best feature, but I would make them come up more attend
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|Im a big scary movie guy. This is one of the scariest i've seen in a couple decades !!!! See it
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I have this on my PC and have always enjoyed it so as soon as it came out for my Kindle Fire I bought it, although it was at a higher price at the time. Anyway, I would consider this to be one of the best match 3 games available. I've played it through and now I'm trying to get 3 stars on each of the 80 days. Fabulous game.
B004NOH9LC|5.0|I have a friend who was looking for this DVD and couldn't find it anywhere she said.... Yeah, we found one.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Gripping real-life drama that restores my faith in the ability of our government to use creative thinking and secrecy to save people and look at the larger greater good in humility instead of  seeking personal recognition and heroism. Like president Carter said, we were able to accomplish it while still maintaining the integrity of our nation. I wish that could be said about the last  decade.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I consider it a very good book, both by the biography itself as by the way it was written. I absolutely recommend it.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Eastwood tells a compelling story about relationships with baseball just being a backdrop.  Even if you don't like baseball, you will love the story.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|Couldn't put the book down would recommend hands down worth $…  buying the second part as we speak I'm sure it sill be even better
B00992CF6W|5.0|If you are like most people wondering whether or not to buy this game, two words GET IT. you can build anything you want to and has alot more blocks than the free version plus the free version cant save your world so buy it if you have the money it is worth it!!!!!!!!
B00A757EFW|5.0|Out of all the games that have been made; this is still one of the greatest.  I would recommend to everyone who is still a child at heart.  The only problem that I had; was that my big ole fingers wouldn't let me go where I wanted.  I suggest getting the pen that goes with your kindle.
1582701709|3.0|I don't doubt Ms. Byrne's sincerity, but I think as a society we look too much to the positive and not enough to the real.  Life's not like that: bad things happen, we deal, we grow and we move on.  Good for what it is, imo, not a true philosophy.
B004MMEF30|4.0|This book is a wonderful depiction of the Sherlock Holmes world. I think that this is the best depiction of the stories as a whole and is a must read for all ages.
034580404X|5.0|With all the hype about this trilogy shoved in our faces, you'd think I'd avoid it or be ready to compare it to other contemporary erotica novels like Belinda, Exit to Eden and the like.  This was different.<br /><br />There are moments when it feels more idealistic than real, but that's the point to fantasy, I believe.  It takes years to build any relationship, much less a D/s one.  What piqued and kept my interest was the dynamics between out Mr. Grey and Ms. Steele (somehow appropriate names, I think ).  It wasn't all drama and angst, there was fun and banter and a sense of marvel; how these two chose to intermingle his penchant for dominance and her head-over-heels awe and desire to protect.  I won't give a whole lot away, but don't confuse the general image of FSoG based on nothing but the porn.  The stories work if you approach them from a less-than-vanilla POV.
B00846REIS|5.0|It's great, let's see what the next book brings. I hope he lets us in on why he has his nightmares. I can't wait.
B00633W614|4.0|i have only read As the Crow Flies until i read Only time will tell. i love these kind of stories. They are total  mind candy and a great read when you want something light.
B00BETX5PS|5.0|I enjoyed this movie tremendously.  The locations, cast all of it was well done.  I also loved the subtle &#34;hat tips&#34; to the old bond movies.  You will know them when they happen.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|I have this app installed on my Droid Razr Maxx and works wonderfully.  I also have it installed on my Kindle Fire (1st gen).  The update downloads fine but will not install.  I hope it gets fixed soon.  I'll try again to update it in a few days.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is an easy read and a good logical expression of Dr. Alexander's NDE and the conditions involved in his experience.........
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|Found this after hearing a song on Pandora. Great I really enjoy listening to it in my car.glad I ordered this.
B000QY9WOU|3.0|I had been at \\"The Farewell Tour\\" live and it was fantastic, but whoever taped the show did a horrible job. Lighting and color weren't up to par. If you Like Cher you like the show, just don't adjust your TV it's them.
B006WPWH4E|2.0|Not Impressed with the game.  It's not really that great kinda boring I think.  Just plain old Solitare, nothing special.
B0093LINVK|5.0|This Intel NUC computer is perfect solution for an XBMC home theater PC.<br /><br />Setup with Windows 7 was fast and straight forward using a 32GB USB flash boot drive, although it did require manual installation of drivers for the Ethernet, graphics controller, and some misc. Intel support drivers. The performance is a great step up from slower ARM and Athlon based solutions. I have an Acer RL100 XBMC box and the NUC is much faster and it makes a big difference. While I did add a wireless card since it was only $30, yet in practice I only use it with a wired connection and the performance over the network is flawless. Streaming up to 1080P movies from my NAS works without issue and every Internet streaming solution (Netflix, Amazon Prime, Vudu, etc.) works wonderfully. Everything is zippy.<br /><br />To make a perfect HTPC setup I used XBMCLauncher to replace Windows Explorer making XBMC the default Windows Shell. It therefore boots quickly right into XBMC without any chance for operator (i.e. my kids) error. I use the Kylo browser that offers a nice 10-foot UI for surfing to any web based streaming sites, such as Netflix that are not supported well by XBMC. Windows Media Center works great for live/recorded TV, which is streamed from a HDHomerun Ethernet based TV receiver. I use an MCE infrared remote that works great with all the applications for simple media control and a Logitech K400r wireless keyboard providing full input/mouse capabilities.<br /><br />One really attractive feature is it only draws about 12 watts when playing a movie and less when idle and runs pretty cool. I don’t  go out of my way to turn it off or worry about the power costs since at most it’s only $30/year in power at the highest rates. It has a laptop style fan but I have never heard it operate so pretty much silent.<br /><br />I see others complain about the NUC not having USB 3.0 ports and for me that is not an issue since everything streams over the Ethernet network or from the ultra fast internal SSD drive. I goosed mine up with 16GB of RAM and 256GB SSD, which means I have way more RAM and storage than I need for XBMC today, but it sure flies and will avoid being obsolete for many years.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I originally loaded this game on my kindle fire for my 11 yr. old daughter,  but I ended up playing it more. We had the password protection for purchases so no mistakes there. A few weeks ago the game just restarted back to the beginning when we had about 72 pets. The customer care people were fair to replace the bling and kibble I had lost to my new game since I liked it enough to restart it. I really like this game and even got a small bling pack. I figure the game would be worth that much at least to purchase if it were not free. They have also recently added new content, houses and pets etc. and many don 't need blunt. Very nice.
0062103377|5.0|was a fun read, could picture Bobby  in this book. Great for Supernatural fans,  gives more background on the beasties they stalk
B0076DCT2G|4.0|DeMille never disappoints. John Corey's sass is up to par and always brings a smile even in the most harrowing situations. A page turner.
0062073192|5.0|I sure miss having John on Supernatural. This book tells of the boys lives (and Johns) after Mary's death and living and growing up on the road. How Dean  protected Sam and grew into a better hunter than John. And at what an early age they learned the hunters life.
B003YBUSMW|5.0|i got this wheel about 3 days ago right now is really good i really like it, lets see if it doesnt broke!!
B00BF2UKDE|5.0|I know, I know, but I like the new direction NC & tBS are moving in. This makes me think of Josh T Pearson and the wonderful Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford soundtrack. Keep it up, I say.
B00772M1F6|5.0|Amazing stuff! Super talented guy and i love the double bass sound. Easily one of the best albums of 2012.
B00846F1YW|4.0|This is a great game...fantastic graphics and challenges.  I like being able to skip the dialog and play without the timer if I choose.  The only glitches are that in more than one chapter...at least 3 or 4... the hidden objects are covered by the menu bar at the top.  The only way I found them was by using a hint.  I play on Kindle Fire and have not had any other problems.  I would have rated a 5+ stars without glitches...looking forward to more challenges from this game!
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|my son is enjoying it. Grandma enjoyed it too. happy with purchase and would use selller again. no issues with download
0060899190|5.0|I would recommend this book to any one who has a secret or who thinks they don't. Everyone I show this book to loves it male female or anywhere between.
1938469011|4.0|This book was extremely educational but at the same time did not read like a textbook and you could actually sit down and read it from cover to cover without getting bored or lost in technicals.
030758836X|1.0|What the other one star reviews said.<br /><br />There were so many missed opportunities in this book -- so many cliched characters, so many easy coincidences. The premise was good, and with so much of the story told in first person narrative it is easy to suspect everyone of anything... for a while. Then it just gets ridiculous. I think the author watched too many episodes of \\"MacGyver.\\" Or the DeNiro movie, \\"Cape Fear.\\" The bad character isn't just a bad character -- the bad character has secret super powers.<br /><br />My main gripe, however, is that the ending is beyond bad. It's as if the author got bored with the whole thing and just checked out. This book was not worth my time or my money. It ranks as one of my very least favorite books ever.
B008K8H9C6|5.0|As a mother, this is one of the games that my kids have on their kindles, that I enjoy playing.  I really like the fact that the kids have to think about how to solve each level.  It is not &#34;mindless&#34; entertainment as some of the games are.  It also teaches persistence - if you don't beat the level the first time, think about a new way to try to beat it.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|I love jazz.  Christmas jazz?  How does one make Christmas songs in to jazz?  Listen to this album by Ms Karall.
B000JMKTLO|2.0|This is just a troubling book.  The subject is troubling, the tone is depressing and the whole book just put me off.  NOT my cup of tea and I like some of her other books.
B00ANW33CM|4.0|Fun game. Love the 3D look with game. Challenging game on all levels. Great game for children to work on speed
B007712XAU|5.0|We got this as a gift for a friend and she loves it.  We have seen most of these so we loved it too.  I recommend this seller and I highly recommend the product.
B002VWNID6|4.0|Alot of action--darker story (witchcraft); Story of Robin Hood is great, though.  I'm sappy, so I like these kinds of things.  Loved it in the 80's, and still do.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent story with beautiful description. I couldn't put it down. So glad I read the book before seeing the movie.
B0093LFGMO|5.0|Excellent cd. Always loved Robbie's music and this is his best yet. A sure winner for anyone to own. Cmon USA lets get on board.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just when you think &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; can't get any better, season 2 brings the viewer closer into the family circle of England's Lord and Lady Crawley as well as their vast staff of servants.  Season 2 opens with WWI reaching in to the Abbey and taking away many of it's men and finishes just a dramatically as one would expect of a Masterpiece Theatre offering.  As I have said before, &#34;Downton Abbey&#34; is just plain good TV, it's a shame that the rest of the networks can not follow suit.
B004X4QW42|5.0|You have to see part one to put the entire story together. This is a true story of a great martial arts teacher. This is the man who went on to teach Bruce lee himself. What an awesome story of all the trials of this mans life. He was truly the best!! I think anyone who likes martial arts, True stories, or Great action movies should watch both of these films. I promise you will love them as i do.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great read it kept me interested to see what would happen next, would be good for anyone that has been in a relationship where major jealousy was a factor.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Good game just needs to move along little faster. seems to drag a little starting to get a Little bored. Now u need a nap.
B0086700CM|5.0|There's only one con about this game for me. The family and I can't seem to quit arguing about who's turn it is..fun and addictive.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Great book! Definitely different and unique. Hope to read more like it in the future. I enjoyed the photos alot
B003L77GH4|5.0|These series are the best.  I am excited about the fourth series coming out on dvd.  It is going to be awesome.
B000BTGY1O|4.0|Product arrived in a timely manner, it actually arrived before the expected arrival date. The DVD was scratch free and played well. The packaging was worn and torn, but that had no effect on the quality of the video. I'd most likely be a return customer.
B002NHGG92|5.0|These movies are amazing.  So happy I bought this.  I have the 1st and second season and cant wait for the fourth season to come out on dvd.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Really well written.....couldn't put it down.  Quick, easy read. 4 stars and not 5 just for the ending. Was hoping for a little more satisfaction.  Highly recommend this book.  Ok....I'm off to read the other 2!!
B004GHNIRK|3.0|I have never read this but it is on my phone in case i get bored and need something to read.
B0001MLMKY|3.0|I bought it because in the picture it looked like very similar to another model I used to have and for an everyday watch it's okay.<br />What annoys me a bit is the tic-tac sound which is very loud and sometimes while working it bothers.<br />I will not return it since I'd been wearing it for a while, outdoors or doing my housework you don't even notice the noise, but if you work in a peaceful environment I wouldn't recommend it at all.
B004LZFWJO|1.0|Not at all what I expected, it is a very slow game and there are no challenging levels.  Have deleted from my kindle
B006LSZECO|2.0|Slow pass start. Not interesting subject. Started to get interesting half way through, but I had already given up on it. If you liked &#34;Defending Jacob&#34; you might like this book.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I ordered this for my Niece It came very quickly. It was in the condition it said to be.. I would order from this seller again. All in all, i am very happy and i am sure that she will be to.
0345803485|3.0|Started reading the book and it was interesting, but the further I read the boring it got. Not recommended unless you like this kind of stuff.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I loved from the day I started to play the game! So much fun! I really recommend this game for all ages!!!
B003Y74KCK|5.0|When I bought this case I didn't think that one day I would drop my phone until it happened. One day at the store I drop my phone and with the case on it was protected.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie hits home. It tells it like it is. It's funny, sad, soul stirring and truthful. The stars that were cast to play their parts gave power house performance. Wow what a movie.
B00BB8SKPW|3.0|I certainly wouldn't call this his best role ever and the scene in the hotel room at the end was also a stretch. A guard right outside the door didn't hear any of it?  I have to admit though that I didn't like Denzel's character at the end of the movie so in that respect he did an excellent job.  (It's hard to dislike Denzel!)  John Goodman as a drug dealer wasn't the least bit believable.  Really hard to explain other than to say I won't be buying or watching the movie again.  Enough said?
B00BJG7H3M|5.0|Best show I've have ever watched I'm hooked and never letting go. This show in no way is predictable and keeps you guessing what is going to happen next, absolutely love it! Keep up the great work USA!!
B00ANGICRE|5.0|I received the blu-ray disc in perfect condition and when promised. It is an excellent movie and I am glad to have it in my collection.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|this game is really hard but extremely fun!It is so much better than the regular temple run!this game is awesome!
B003WKOTXE|4.0|I think this is such a beautiful movie. My husband found it boring.  I suppose it's not for everyone - no dialogue and no real plot to follow; I still found it fun and pleasant to watch.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|When this set arrived a few days before it was promised, I now own all of the Downton Abbey DVDs. The Season 3 set is as marvelous as the previous two sets. The technical quality is absolutely top grade.<br /><br />I highly recommend buying and viewing these DVD to all fans of Downton Abbey, as well as to pople who have yet to discover the joys of this series for themselves.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|When I first saw this movie, I really didn't know that much about it and that would be because the character is more well known in Europe.  I loved the animation, the music, the story, the humor, the action, and the actors who contributed to this film.  I highly recommend it!!
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Ordered DVD and it arrived quickly and in excellent condition.<br /><br />Great movie and the Legacy continues.  Must have in your movie collection.<br /><br />Thank you
B003VANOFY|5.0|Pros:<br /><br />Battery -  It lasts 6+ Hours, and charges in less than 45 minutes.<br />Sound - Crisp, clear, even sound.<br />Comfort - I have worn these 6 hours straight with no discomfort.<br />Programmable buttons - Work flawlessly with Ventrilo, and WMP<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Programmable buttons - A dedicated Stop/Play, Next Track, and Last track would be nice. As it is, they have programmable buttons that you can have do the same thing, but having additional specific ones would be more intuitive and helpful, IMO.<br /><br />Charging stand - Not really a &#34;con&#34;, but it would be a nice feature to have a charging dock that you just set the headphones on and it charges automatically without having to plug them in. With that being said... all and all, these are<br /><br />All in all, these are fantastic. Whether you are listening to music while doing housework, Listening to long conference calls over IP while needing to remain mobile, or playing shooter games needing pinpoint sound, these headphones can't be beat.
B005W3G2D4|4.0|Kelly's  powerful soulful voice is a rare gift for the world to cherish.  This album is an outstanding performance by a gifted singer.
1592402038|1.0|I thought I was ordering a book with punctuation refreshers but it was so complicated and not what I expected.  Returned the book.
B003Y5H5EW|4.0|She keeps faith with the previous movies, still a straight shooter.  Wonder what her daughter will turn out to be?
1609611543|5.0|IT WORKS GREAT, PRICE EVEN BETTER,LOOKS GOOD, WILL HAVE MORE TO SAY WHEN I HAVE HAD IT FOR AWHILE THANKS AGAIN
B0001WTUH6|5.0|Wow - More Underworld to love.  This is a fine addition to the epic masterpiece.  I could still want more !
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm hooked. I hope it never ends. The quality of the amazon video is much better than Hulu. I'm glad I switched.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I luv playing this game, it's easier to play than the real game!It gets very addicting much rather play this game than any other, this is a game for all ages
B00AL1ONN8|5.0|T.I.'s new cd does not disappoint n is a must buy.All songs from start finish will have u bobbing your head and ready to hit the dance floor.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Looking for proof for our spiritual existence. Anyone who is on a journey for understanding the world outside of our earthly bodies.
B008GFI4KY|5.0|Really glad I picked up on these guys. Enjoyed both of there other releases, but they are certainly a bit more mature sounding here. Each song is very good and several are addicting. You clearly hear elements of ACDC, Thin Lizzy, and even the Beatles in many of the songs. If you are looking for a classic guitar rock sound done right and fresh or just want a straight ahead &#34; in your face&#34; sound that ROCKS, without over engineering or deep lyrics, than this is for you! simple straight forward Guitar rock. My favorite cd of 2012 by far!  Hope they tour the states soon!
B001RU2YUQ|5.0|Australia is one of my favorites. It has action, romance, comedy, thrill, and a little music in between. A great movie for friends or families. A little lengthy, but I wouldn't have taken a single scene out. Great cast and beautiful scenery throughout the film. Definitely worth a rental (if not a purchase)!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|The cast nailed it. So many previous attempts at this movie were a bust but Tom and Camron put together a splended cast and an epic movie. Cant wait for the DVD.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|Fckn awesome :D and ill read the other books im looking foward to finish the whole series. This is my favorite so far.
1608871452|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Supernatural since it first premiered.  I was so excited to see this on Amazon and ordered it as a birthday gift for myself.  It met every expectation I had and more.  It's a fascinating book filled with so much information and cool extras.  It is by far my favorite Supernatural book.  It's a must have for any true fan of the show.  I'm proud to have it as part of my collection.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is probably the most amazing temple run it has great graphics that even my freak out brother enjoys it so yeah . Well I also have one bad thing the confusing obstacles there not very confusing but they still are . All I want to do is play temple run all day long . Although I mentioned this before the graphics are better than deep fried Oreos.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like this awesome game, it's really enjoyable.  I love the obstacles that challenges your reflexes.  You actually have too think before you do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a sound<br />Inning big high high high high high high high. High. High.  Huh big job chubby/ chic h b
B000EHSN9Y|5.0|The thing works.  What else is there to say?  Just make sure you've got a mini-DVI port before you order.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Another great read by Hosseini. Highly recommended if you enjoyed The Kite Runner. This novel told the story of strong female characters, most women can empathize with. Magnificent.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love it love it love it. I would recomend this to anyone..There is nothing that I dislike about the series
1936719010|5.0|As those familiar with the \\"Star Wars\\" saga, Master Yoda said: \\"Try not. Do. Or do not. There is no try\\". This small (I read it in about an hour) and wonderful book shows us how to fight and conquer Resistance, that enemy within us that I used to call our saboteur and that tries to stop us from doing new projects (or art, as Seth Godin likes to say). A simple, direct, strong message right to the point that made me stand up and immediately start a new project! Thank you Mr. Pressfield, I really needed that extra push!
0345803507|5.0|I bought this book as a gift to my friend who is still a virgin at 35. She's one of those old school women during the cold war and she's saving it for her Mr. right to pop her cherry. She loved the first book so much so I bough the book 2 & 3 for her. I'm glad I'm not going to witness her exploration agenda and I hope that no human beings and animals will be harmed during the process. I'm not a fan of this book though. I'd rather go to internet and watch the exploration in action.

0345803493|5.0|Bought this book as a Birthday gift to my friend who is still a virgin at 35. She loved the first book so I got this for her so she can explore whatever she needed to explore. I'm glad I don't have to witness it. I also bought her the book 3. I hope her exploration will go smoothly without harming any human beings or animals.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Many directors would find it easy, in a movie like this one, to focus on the bleakness of the lead characters' respective illnesses, or reduce their struggles to broad, unfunny slapstick. I admire David O. Russell, who manages to capture the complex, ornery nature of his characters' contrasting struggles. His subtle hand and natural, Mamet-like writing, coupled with an ensemble cast caring enough to sacrifice all pride, produce a work reminiscent of Coppola's best.<br /><br />The chemistry between leads Bradley Cooper and Jennifer Lawrence makes for characters who resist easy categories. Both characters have suffered traumas which they cannot live down, and which they try to bury by turning their natural desire for love in inappropriate directions. Their strange courtship, based on half-truths and subtext, resembles no other romantic comedy I can recall, yet reflects entirely too many real, funny, touching relationships I have known.<br /><br />The supporting cast, anchored to Robert DeNiro and Jacki Weaver as Cooper's parents, give the leads a rich context in which to create their characters. When was the last time you can recall DeNiro stepping back and giving somebody else the glory of all the best lines and most interesting unspoken moments? Yet an actor famous for his own personal dynamism so completely loses himself in the story that he willingly gives of himself so another actor can shine.<br /><br />This film will not reward people who like flash and fire. Despite a few scenes of shouting and fighting, probably all the most extroverted moments got spliced into the trailer. This understated, often moody, and surprisingly hilarious film creates characters and situations we long to see explored, yet doesn't demand loud cheers. It requires us, rather, to be an active audience, and let this careful, complex story into our hearts.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|Built-in flashes are almost never a good idea.  This relatively inexpensive add-on will provide you a flash that can better keep pace with your shutter, allows you to bounce the flash to avoid that \\"washed-out\\" look in your pictures, all while not weighing you down.  Photog guru Ken Rockwell of [...] recommends it and after shooting with it for only a week, I can too!
B008G12ERC|4.0|All that Muse does is write great music. They have set the bar so high in the past, that I think the expectations of people (including me) can sometimes be unrealistic. I am giving this 4 stars because I don't think it measures up to the band's greatest works such as 'Absolution'. But this is a very enjoyable release with all of their signature soft moments, bombast and experimenting. Matt's vocals are great as usual.<br /><br />The minimal use of &#34;dubstep-like&#34; guitar on one track is being overblown. It doesn't bother me.<br /><br />I do have to admit that the vocals done by the bassist (Chris) are OK, but forgettable. 'Save Me' is a snoozer - like listening to Coldplay. 'Liquid State' is ok, mostly for the music. I'd be fine if they stopped letting him sing.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Nice traditional spider game easy to use and play. Makes nice addition to kindle fire apps.  Easier on kindle if use a pen. Find it more difficult if just using a finger to play.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Love everything Monster High and these movies are awesome!  Fantastic animation and a great storyline!  Can't wait for more MH DVDs!
1419705849|4.0|Bought this for my nephew and found out he already had it, so I read it as a grown adult and I got a kick out of it. Will I buy all the books for me? Probably not, but will I recommend it to any young grade school kid, absolutely! Love the humor and style of Kinney's writing.
B0081SRJSY|4.0|I bought this game with the intent of trying it out before buying the actual board game.  I find that games like this are a good way to learn the rules of the game since the rules are strictly enforced and the game walks you through how to play.<br /><br />Now that I've learned to play, I'll be looking for the board game.  I'll also continue to play this when I can't find other people to play.  It's a lot of fun and the game design is done well.<br /><br />However, the scoring in this game is tricky and the game doesn't show you how it works.  Worse, when points are scored, they're written in a very small font that gets lost on the screen, made worse by the fact that it's not in a consistent location.  I still miss about half the points because I don't manage to catch the number before it disappears.  Luckily, I've learned what the points should be, so I don't need it anymore, but it's a glaring mistake that causes me to rate this at four stars instead of five.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I tried to deny the all consuming radio hitmakers fun. but simply could not resist this album once 'carry on' came out on the radio. Great album, crafty lyrics, and I think a few more songs will make it on to the radio as well. This album reminded me of a hybrid of the mumford & sons folk feel but the bizarreness yet intelligent lyrics of panic! at the disco. I saw fun. as an opening act before they were on the radio and before the folk feel tookover the airwaves and was not sure what to make of them, but took to the song 'carry on' then and kind of forgot about it until it was out on the radio, but I have to say, the best 2012 album purchase I made. Looking forward to more fun.!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|How can something this good be this cheap? $30 for a whole TV show season, blu-ray AND DVD, AND a Digital Copy. Wow. Amazon, you have outdone yourself.<br /><br />But seriously, this show's fantastic. Everyone should watch it. And by everyone, I mean everyone who can handle the adult themes.
B00979CS50|4.0|The first song on the first disc goes on forever and had me thinking, WTF? It was like hearing your neighbor's kid playing in the garage. However, after hearing the whole 2 sets, I have to admit, I had been nursing a serious Neil Young jones, and as crappy as the musicianship is, and the repetitive riffs, and everything else, it satisfies. It puts you in the frame of mind that maybe you were in back in the 70's, when you played in a rock band and got stoned every day. And a couple of the tunes are pretty nice. Classic Neil.
B008X9Z37A|5.0|I almost didn't get a case for my Kindle Fire, but my boyfriend talked me into it. I chose this one because it was inexpensive, but don't let the price fool you--this case has the goods. The interior lining is so soft, I just know my kindle is in good hands.

B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I've read a number of Jodi Picoult's novels, and I enjoy them immensely. That said, this isn't the strongest one. I was surprised that it came out in 2006, since the book is set in the mid-to-late '90s. All of the character are very East Coast: cold, withholding, more concerned about appearances than anyone's well-being. Hard to really empathize with any of them, other than maybe the boy's mom and the girl's dad. As always, the court scenes are very engaging - I finished the second half of this book in one long reading session.<br /><br />I read the Kindle edition, which is $3. It was fine. If you like her books, this won't be your favorite, but it's a decent read.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I bought this book in a whim and read all of it In Three days. It was by far the best sf i've read in a long time. Basically it's a Robinson Crusoe story about a man stranded on mars In the near future. All the science was spot on and the main character is hilarious. You've got to read this if your a sf fan!

B005WUHAX8|3.0|As far as its guarantees, it is water proof and dust proof and easy to use and much thinner than the otter box. However, no one can hear me! I have to take the plug for the headphone jack out in order to have a phone call because the hole they put in for the microphone is just too small. Also, there is felt over the speaker to let sound out and keep water from coming in, but this bumps the screen protector in the center, which isn't impossible, but can make typing difficult and tedious. I'm waiting for amazon to have the Otterbox Armor and buying that instead.

B005LAIII0|5.0|Ang Lee's \\"Life of Pi\\" is a masterpiece with some of the most beautiful and unforgettable images ever displayed on film. Not only did it give me an experience of the wonder in being alive while moving me to tears, but its story also encompassed a human life from childhood to mature age while dealing with pain and guilt that are part of the human experience.<br /><br />Ang Lee isn't thought of as an Asian auteur in the class of Wong Kar-wai, Zhang Yimou or Lee Chang-dong. He's actually more of a commercial director than a personal artist, but what he does in transferring the \\"Life of Pi\\" from novel to screen is miraculous.  Perhaps no director has ever captured the beauty and fear of the power of life, and when you look deep into the eyes of the tiger \\"Richard Parker\\", you see what Marlowe saw in Kurtz's eyes in Conrad's \\"The Heart of Darkness\\": a power so vast it dwarfs you with an awareness of your mortality, showing you your insignificance beside the powers of all life.  What Ang Lee does here in this film will, I believe, remain his tour-de-force, and is a work of art I will come to many times in the future.<br /><br />The acting is wonderful, primarily Irrfan Khan, one of India's greatest actors who plays the adult Pi.  Khan provides an entire acting course just in the way he uses his face, displaying a smile in the film's climax that rivals the Mona Lisa's in its ambiguity.  You see the world of pain, guilt, joy and sadness in his delicate expression.<br /><br />The film is supremely spiritual in every frame, yet, if one is paying attention, it winds up as somewhat of a Trojan Horse in what it ultimate reveals about religion.  I'm trying hard not to provide a spoiler here, but there are five words spoken by the adult Pi at the end of the film that viewers seem to miss that spell it out.  But moving away from its theme, no film I have ever seen in my life comes close to \\"Life of Pi\\" in relating the sheer force of nature (making you experience the beauty and terror in the soul of a tiger) and the cosmic beauty of our world, both inner and outer.  Using 3-D more brilliantly (and essentially) than any film to date, this film burned into my mind incredible visual sights impossible to find anywhere else, showing me beauty I will remember the rest of my life.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and one that truly deserves to be seen in 3-D.or in the soul of a tiger) and the cosmic beauty of our world, both inner and outer.

B00BB8SKPW|3.0|I was disappointed in the movie overall. It is a story of the times and it speaks volumes about our society, but for entertainment, it is NOT a movie to watch and leave behind.
0060555661|5.0|This book is fanastic, and considered one of the most sound books on investing out there. One warning though, it reads much like textbook, and is not a page turner. To get the most out of this book it would be wise to take notes, and mark pages. great great book though

1589795474|4.0|This book was very enjoyable to read and interesting on the facts of the smart investor vs the bad investor. Really just shows time and time again that living above or rght at your means will not create wealth.
B009LH1Y1W|4.0|More of the same, including more angst from Sam and secrets from Dean. Overall pretty good but how many more times can these guys get brought back from hell?
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Never thought I could enjoy this type of TV. But the actors are some of the best ever. The characters are perfect, the plot line very engaging. And these comments from a household who loved Lost, Battlestar, Flash Forward, Mad Men.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I couldn't get through it, was very boring.  Just not my kind of book I guess.  I'm sure there are readers out there who would enjoy it!
B002MUAJ2A|4.0|This book just tells you what you need in short, easy to understand blurts.  Meetings are toxic. Don't create policy to control every situation.  Ideas are immortal, inspiration is not.  Really enjoyed it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Would recommend this to adults who want to enjoy reading something that takes you away from your life for awhile.

B00BESIKWM|3.0|Was just okay, worth watching but not as good as the first, not that the first was anything to write home about.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is a well written story with a surprising twist at the climax.  In addition to the story line that covers two generations, a very person view of the bombing of London is portrayed.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|Definitely unique. Me and my family really enjoyed this movie, this is one I will definitely will be buying, kids love to watch it repeatedly.
B004GYY714|5.0|Even with Winamp for Android installed on my Kindle Fire, I still could not hear many streaming radio stations, some of which promised to play through a browser as long as WinAmp was installed. But TuniIn Radio does allow this, as long as the TuneIn utility has the station listed in its database, or can add it. (I'm not sure how this works.)  I simply typed-in the somewhat obscure station I wanted to hear, it popped up on the list, and I went to it and listened just fine.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|A little predictable, but good original story line, worth watching. Definitely at least worth renting. Would watch again if it was free.
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|Movie was great and got to me well  before the deadline, wonderful packaging and handling, A great job two thumbs up

B008MX7Z32|4.0|I bought this so I could sit at night and knit and not have to have big light on!  Works great!  Bright enough even when on it's lowest setting!  Wish a little taller but works as is just put it on a book to raise it up!  Now that I am done with knitting project I had to finish can read regular books at night, instead of e-books, and not disturb my husband as he sleeps!  Hope it lasts a very long time!
1594487154|5.0|Daniel Pink is showing us how things have changed in the business of selling because the buyer is also equipped with the knowledge of what's being sold.  Because this knowledge empowers the buyer, the seller will not sky-rocket his sales as would have been the case.  The book is interesting in that it's not only about selling and buying but also how we people need to care and treat others well in whatever we do.  I found this human-touch emphasis a beautiful thing!  I also must say that Mr. Pink has a great sense of humor.  As I was reading the book, sometimes I would say, 'Wow,' other times smile and other times laugh! I would recommend the book to my children and friends.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love it very addictive, I heard about the game but never tried it before I got my Kindle now I have to stop myself from playing to get anything else done. Thanks
B001RTP3Z0|4.0|This concert is for those who really like the way the old guy signs these days.  The program has pretty much every song I want to hear.  And the video, in a concert setting, adds some great personal touches.<br /><br />Mostly, I prefer to listen to my music, not watch it.  But in this case, the London 2008 concert video is way better than any of the audio-only sources for this music at this time in Leonard's life.  And you don't have to sit still to watch it; it makes great listening while working or dining.<br /><br />The disc isn't perfect.  The quality of the photography is very poor, especially at the beginning.  There doesn't seem to have been any attempt to adapt the stage lighting to the needs of the filming.  I don't know if one gets used to, or it improves throughout the concert; it didn't seem to bother me so much toward the end.<br /><br />The concert is a little long.  We probably will never do it in one sitting again.  But that's okay.  I'm confident that we will play it a lot in the days to come, even if only parts of it at a time.
0765325950|5.0|A great ending, how could it end any other way?.sanderson moves the pace along quickly and wraps it all up nicely. not quite the same cadence as RJ, but an enjoyable read and very satisfying to finish the series.

B009I2UH2W|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo2SYQFOD5S0PSU]]From the \\"it doesn't fit\\" to the Gremlin inspired \\"Bright Light Bright Light\\" claims, I almost passed on this one. I own the previous version for pre-iPhone 5 phones, but was concerned that I may go blind while driving and/or crash into a tree whilst trying to jam the plug into my, possibly uniquely undersized and apparently not at all standardized car plug. I felt bold and ordered it anyway.<br /><br />When it came, the first surprise was that it did not require that I fetch power tools to get the package open. It wasn't hermetically sealed in Carbonite Ala Han Solo, so I was immediately encouraged. Once I had it out of the package, I compared it's length to my previous version. This could be a male thing but length was one of my first concerns. I'm happy to report that it is longer than the original so a welcomed upgrade indeed. I went to the garage, fetched my welding helmet with auto-darkening filter, prepared to plug it in and braced for the impending luminous splendor that has been witness by others. I turned off the garage lights, turned on my headlights and plugged it in. The chargre had no problem going in to any of my 3 ports, so I must be lucky. Once in, I was a bit saddened that I didn't get to witness anything but a mild, white ring no brighter than a nightlight. In fact, the iPhone 5 when plugged in was at minimum 5 times brighter than the ring itself. Maybe I have special eyes or a special SUV, but I didn't experience anything like some of the others here. It works, it looks fine and the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I would have preferred that they put a red light on the ring like the previous version; not only because it would then match my interior lights, but would then serve a useful purpose of changing to a green glow when fully charged as did my previous one.<br /><br />If you need it, buy it.

B004NOH9LC|5.0|While Harrison Ford's character could use a little more pizzazz, this is an adorable story about a young producer (McAdams) who early on just can't seem to get a break in the business.  She's definitely a go-getter and her bubbling personality makes watching this film so much more enjoyable.  Reading all the reviews before me makes me wonder why people write so much - some reviewers give you every detail of the movie, so why do you bother watching it.  Too many spoilers I say!  You don't have to get more of Rachel's character to enjoy this film.  She's downright adorable.  So there are a few profanities in the film - they do not dampen the enjoyment.  For Prime members, the film is FREE, so why not watch it.

1457514508|5.0|When I completed The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club, I was reminded of Flannery O'Connor, a daughter of Savannah who believed irony and veracity were compliments - not contradictions - in storytelling. Author Duncan Whitehead's characters, with the exception of the little tart, Kelly Hudd, are ironic manifestations of the bygone days of Savannah's southern gentility. They couch their conversations and interactions with a disingenuous sincerity that turns \\"bless her heart\\" into a slur. It is deliciously provocative. More importantly, Mr. Whitehead paints each scene with such a fine brush, he allowed this reader to clearly see the setting and the emotions created by the lustful conflict inherent to the story. (His four main female characters are spurned by the real or imagined transgressions of their male counterparts and each seeks retribution in a manner wholly unbefitting a genteel southern woman.) It is funny and ribald and very visual. Mr. Whitehead, if he hasn't done so already, should find a screenwriter. The Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Club belongs on the big screen.
B002QZ399G|3.0|The tension in this movie is too implied. I was kind of lost the first time I saw this movie, and even after the third time I find myself pausing and rewinding to catch some stuff that is mumbled or said in a hushed tone. I find turning on subtitles to help a little because this movie move very quickly, and for the most part, relies on plot development from these quick and hard to observe conversations.<br /><br />Overall, this was a pretty decent movie.

B000063DI9|5.0|This album is just absolutely incredible, I really don't even know how else to describe it. While Iron Maiden's 1986 classic \\"Somewhere in Time\\" featured the band experimenting with synthesizers, here on their 1988 follow up \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\", they decided to take the progressiveness from the previous album further to an even more epic level of sheer brilliance with a handful of progressive elements on this album, especially on the near 10 minute title track which is a great example. SSOASS is also a concept album that follows the story of a cursed child who is born with special powers and is tempted by both good and evil, meanwhile the band's chemistry and musicianship are completely intact and in full force. Bruce Dickinson's vocals are incredible as always, while Steve Harris delivers excellent basslines that he's so well known for, and Nicko McBrain continues to show his masterful talents behind the drums. And of course, guitarists Adrian Smith and Dave Murray both continue to lash out a series of amazing riffs and solos throughout, unfortunately Adrian would depart from the band after this album, and wouldn't return until 2000's \\"Brave New World\\". Every song on SSOASS is a winner, but here are my favorite highlights. The opening song \\"Moonchild\\" starts off with acoustic guitars and clean, relaxing vocals from Bruce, until it builds on into a fast, adrenaline pumping headbanger with more aggressive vocals, guitars, and drums. There's also a great use of keyboards in the background as well. Track two \\"Infinite Dreams\\" is an excellent melodic number featuring more great vocals from Bruce and awesome soaring leadwork. This song is just perfect. The third track \\"Can I Play With Madness\\" is another classic Maiden tune which is followed by another catchy energetic rocker in \\"The Evil That Men Do\\", while the epic title track \\"Seventh Son of a Seventh Son\\" is a near 10 minute piece of pure musical magic. The band's musicianship is just absolutely wonderful throughout especially with the masterful instrumental section. A brilliant song this is, and one of the best songs on here, I may add. My favorite track on here would definately have to be \\"The Clairvoyant\\". It features an excellent bass intro by Harris, as well as a soaring chorus, awesome background keyboards, and more fantastic soloing. A true classic. And then we have the album's grand finale \\"Only the Good Die Young\\" which features fast riffs, another great solo, and a powerful chorus. The ending also closes the way that it began on \\"Moonchild\\" as well. All in all, SSOASS is another masterful work of pure musical brilliance from one of metal's all time greatest and most dedicated bands. It's truly an absolute must have for any fan of Iron Maiden, believe me, you won't be disappointed one bit...UP THE IRONS!!!throughout especially with the masterful instrumental section.

B008CRC506|5.0|We saw the series on TV, and had to have the DVD to see it again.  I hope they keep up the same quality in the second season.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I am just not mechanically minded enough for this game.  I tried it twice, and got stuck both times.  The instructions on how to build things just aren't clear enough for me to be successful with this game.  If you are good at building things (like legos), this game may be good for you, otherwise don't waste your time.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Sky fall was a fantastic action movie that was able to keep that same Bond feel. Highly recommended and you can watch the HD version on your Roku.
B0058UXHHK|3.0|At first I was ready to put down this book because of the psychic twist.  Once I got used to that, I loved the characters and the love story.  Keeps you on the edge as to what is going on in a comical way.  If this is a series, I don't think I would read any others, but I am glad I have a rule that I have to keep reading till the end with the only exception being if the book is still boring half-way through.  No later than the second chapter, this book had me hooked.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|My grandson was thrilled with this gift.  He says it very rare and very hard to find - so he was impressed and excited with his gift.  Apparantly all the kids at the party were jealous.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is really fun and addicting.  It is hard not to want to cheat.  It is easy to pick up and accomplish goals.  My only advise, once you get past the second level of arcade puzzles, it doesn't seem worth using your dozer dollars on the rest.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The book was outstanding. Sylvia Day writes a very believable, story that completely draws you in. I'm sad the book had to end. It's to many months to have to wait for the next book to come out! I highly recommend this series. It will grab you from the start!

B0018ARN6U|5.0|Marc Bolan was a unique talent. A prolific writer and an inventive guitarist; his music has a freshness that is truely original. On this record he outshines his fellow Glam artist David Bowie. Every song on the basic album is a classic. The extras are mostly first rate. And the interview reveals a sweet sensitive artist that we lost way too soon. Buy this---Electric Warrior---simply amazing !!!

B00B0ZT9NI|5.0|I now understand why this movie is up for the Academy Awards!  Ben Affleck and the talented cast  bring to the screen the &#34;story behind the story&#34; of the hostage-taking in Tehran, Iran, in the 1980s.  The intrigue, &#34;coincidences&#34; and near-misses keep you on the edge of your seat--while still remaining faithful to the real story of the Americans who &#34;escaped&#34; the hostage situation--only to find themselves trapped.  (No spoilers here!)  The bonus features include interviews with the actual escapees and the CIA ex-filtration specialist who got them out with an ingenious (completely crazy) scheme!  And only now, since the entire operation was declassified, can the whole story be told.  A Must-See!

B00124LYHQ|5.0|This film version of Streetcar lived up to its hype in every way: the acting by the three lead characters was fantastic, Blanche's degradation was believable and spell-binding, and the tainted relationships between characters were honest and palpable, which created a tumultuous cloud of tension.<br />This film is worth watching for so many reasons, even if you just want to witness Marlon Brando mumble-screaming &#34;STELLA&#34; like you've heard mimicked so many times before.<br />Overall, this film was moving and so clearly the work of Mr. Tennessee Williams, filled with depth and symbolism. I was certainly crying by the end.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|I really didn't want to read another book about a tortured soul. But I worked through it with anger for the foster child system, frustration that Victoria so often came close to healing but never was able to take that next step, and irritation that I knew beforehand what would happen next but had to tediously wait for the author to make her point. Perhaps all this because I am very familiar with the failures of many foster care programs, but also know of many successes. And I have known more than a few Victorias, Grants, and Elizabeths. However, anchoring the story in the language of flowers was a successful choice for a theme and I was thankful that the dictionary was included at the end.

B0063IH60K|3.0|This game is great in that you can customize the background and cards to whatever you like. Also, the tap to move feature is nice. I don't like that you have to dismiss ads between each reshuffle, but this being a free app, it's not too bad. Also, you end up having to self place the majority of the cards before the auto complete option appears. Overall, this is a very basic, but well done solitare game.

B000WGWQG8|4.0|I chose just under 5 stars because, while the film was excellent, ther were 2 or 3 places where the details lacked clarity and I had to reread the corresponding chapter in the book to make it clear.<br />All in all it is a wonderful series and kudos to the actors, especially to Laura Linney.
B001UV4XHY|4.0|This is a good book also but enjoyed The Divine Beauty by Evan Stalter more.<br />Harry Potter sends adventure in different ways.<br />Always
B00797MB0O|1.0|The movie does not consist of a modicum of entertainment. The plot was too shallow, there was not enough character development and the main characters seemed like they had just gotten out of acting school not knowing what was in store for the world.

0061673730|3.0|Let me preface this review by saying that I am both a writer and a creative writing professor--which I state not out of self-indulgence but to try and explain the mindset I had coming to this book.  To put another way, I try to live by the Pobert Pinsky motto: \\"Read the way a chef eats.\\"  I also happen to be extremely interested in \\"eastern\\" philosophy.  Recently, I assigned this book to my Honors students, and to prepare, I reread the book (which I hadn't touched in years).  As I was reading it, I found myself having an extremely different reaction than last time.  Something about it troubled me but I couldn't quite put my finger on it.  To be clear, I have no problem with writers talking frankly about their own shortcomings (in this case, Pirsig's actions as a father, student, and friend).<br /><br />So I read quite a few reviews (both positive and negative) to try and sort out that feeling.  The reviews weren't much help; some criticized Pirsig's treatment of his son whereas others praised what they took to be his honest depiction of his own troubled behavior.<br /><br />Then, finally, it hit me.  The problem with this book isn't with the narrator, but the writer himself.  Despite Pirsig's unquestionable intellect and education, he demonstrates a consistent inability to grasp the connotations of his own language and storytelling.  Since much of the original text has been discussed ad nauseam, let me illustrate my point by examining the famous Afterword.<br /><br />First, Pirsig begins with, \\"This book has a lot to say about ancient Greek perspectives and their meaning but there is one perspective it misses.\\"  Really, only one?  The sheer arrogance of that statement baffles me, especially since its presence in the Afterword (NOT in the description of the road trip and self-critical detailing of Pirsig/Phaedrus's own psychological troubles) implies that Pirsig the author is completely unaware of it.  Also in the Afterword, we have the details about someone close toPirsig being murdered.  I won't give spoilers but I found it odd that Pirsig tells us the assailants were \\"black.\\"  Why tell us that?  The obvious defense (\\"Well, because they were!\\") reflects a lack of appreciation for the connotations of language of which any writer (especially one like Pirsig) should be aware.<br /><br />Perhaps more telling, though, is the passage were Pirsig describes his wife being pregnant.  The couple has decided to terminate the pregnancy but as they're discussing it one last time, Pirsig has a change of heart.  Omitting only the spoiler, here's the Pirsig passage in its entirety: \\"I said, 'Wait. Stop. Something's wrong.' What it was, was unknown, but it was intense and I didn't want it to continue. It was a really frightening thing, which has since become clearer.  It was the larger pattern of [name omitted], making itself known at last.  We reversed our decision, and now realize what a catastrophe it would have been for us if we hadn't.\\"<br /><br />OK, what's missing there?  Well, we know how Pirsig felt about the situation but he has completely left out how his wife responded.  Did she agree?  Did she feel it, too, or did Pirsig bully her into compliance over whether or not SHE would carry the would-be child to term?  And before someone offers a rebuttal of, \\"Well, it's Pirsig's book, not her's!\\" I'd just refer back to my original point about connotation.  Pirsig himself opened this can of worms.  In this case, the \\"we\\" at the end of the passage seems like an afterthought; somehow, in such a pivotal passage detailing Pirsig's complex philosophy, he completely forgot to do what any good writer would do and give us a line or two of description on how his wife felt.  That's just bad writing.<br /><br />To be clear, I am not implying that Pirsig is racist or sexist; I'm simply saying that as a creative writer, he seems rather unaware of the subconscious, psychological effect that his word choice and approach to storytelling have on the reader.  That's the literary equivalent of the person who doesn't pick up on social cues in a conversation and I suspect that's why some readers experience an unsettling feeling when they read this book (or return to it, as I did).<br /><br />All that being said--yes, this book has some beautiful passages and insights, and it's worth reading.  After much reflection, though, I think it would be an oversight to completely dismiss some possible troubles with Pirsig's writing style.
0316113514|5.0|One of the mistake of the west has been the separation of body and mind, mind vs body. In this book,the authors explain and stress the importance of exercising on the brain by showing/detailing the numerous cases they dealt with. I was amaze by seeing the result of exercising against depression, Alzheimer and other mental diseases. After reading this book, I now understand the role of chemicals like serotonin,endorphin, morphine and others on the body and how they occur naturally in the body. Long read but well worth,the more you know...

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Some books make you laugh, or cry, or keep you up late at night with the lights on or just on the edge of your seat. \\"Ready Player One\\" had me grinning ear-to-ear in recognition and complete satisfaction. If you were there to put quarters in the first pizza-parlor Pong games, and if you've paid attention to anything that's been going on in the world around you since then, this is the book for you.<br />One of the few books I've finished and immediately started to re-read, just like when the magic words \\"PLAY AGAIN\\" appeared and I had more quarters!<br />And what a KICK...

B0070Y46UY|5.0|So much has already been written praising this book that there will be little I could add here, but I will say this: After 53 years of indulging in storytelling, in all media and from both sides of the page or screen, I am now rarely surprised. &#34;Life of Pi&#34; was more than surprising; it was an astonishment. I have been told it was Mark Twain who first made the comment about Dumas' &#34;The Three Musketeers&#34; that I will borrow for Martel's book: I envy anyone who is reading &#34;Life of Pi&#34; for the first time.

B007L6VR12|4.0|Very off-the-wall, funny, poignant, and able to entertain people of varied interests... I show this one when I don't want to offend people's political sensibilities, and don't know whether certain dramas or darker comedies or cult classics would be appropriate for all whom will be watching. No one has failed to enjoy it thus far, and my friends and family are a diverse lot.
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|The spoiler free part of this review is that this is the same fantastic series with a group of characters we still love. Every detail of their all-too-human lives had me riveted to the screen as usual. Also worth noting is that I enjoyed the fact that Thomas' sexuality is revisited in this season in a quite interesting way, adding even more depth to his character as well as to the characters of those who must react to his behavior. It's hard for me to give only three stars to a series I love, and I definitely will continue to watch the series, but...<br /><br />I am growing tired of the &#34;We're rich!&#34; &#34;We've lost everything!&#34; &#34;We're rich!&#34; &#34;We've lost everything!&#34; &#34;We're rich again!&#34; story line, always accomplished by Deus Ex Machina. Get a real plot, already. Great characters - you've already got. But that's not a reason to overlook good storytelling.<br /><br />Now for the real SPOILER so stop reading here if you don't want to know. ********************************************<br />While I didn't like the choice made to have Sybil die in childbirth, that alone wouldn't have knocked this season down to three stars for me. But, I absolutely hated the choice that was made to have Matthew's character apparently die. I can only hope that the writer rethinks this choice before next season, as he did leave the possibility open that Matthew survives his accident. It's not because I love Matthew and don't want to see him go, although I do. It's because it is a disservice to the story. Matthew is as close to a &#34;hero&#34; as anyone is this series. Following his character and his fortunes is a significant reason people watch the show. The story should revolve around characters and plot, not actors. So if an actor decides to take a hike, the writer, in my opinion, should find a way to carry on with the story. There are many ways to handle an actor's exit, other than killing off his character in the story. If a character's death is integral to the plot and accomplishes something important, then I do not object. But when the death occurs randomly, in the service of an actor's career choice, I'm against it. The audience is interested in the character, not the actor. Sybil's death already seemed random and did not advance the plot. Now Matthew dies, also in a random act? The writer could have and should have done better. I'm tired of windfall inheritances and car accidents driving the series.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Absolutely fabulous!!!!!!! I missed seeing it when it aired on TV...this set has all the extras and behind the scenes information. Really remarkable -- I will watch it again and again. (I may be hard-pressed to loan it to friends, however!)

0446554995|5.0|Last year I came across a book by Lincoln Child called \\"Utopia\\" and I was hooked.  After reading everything I could find by him, I discovered he had also written several books with another author, Douglas Preston.  At the time, I was really into technothrillers, which is what Child writes when he writes on his own so I didn't read the books he had written together with Preston.<br /><br />Until two weeks ago, when I read \\"Relic\\".  I was introduced to a fantastical story with characters that you can't help to care about and was immediately hooked!  I read the entire Pendergast series in 10 days and absolutely loved it.<br /><br />Two Graves is the latest in the Pendergast series.  At first, I didn't like it - Pendergast is supposed to be cool, unflappable, invincible!  So the first part of this book was depressing (I won't say why so as not to spoil it for those who haven't read it yet).<br /><br />But that quickly changed as the story went on and I knew I was in for another \\"stayed up waaaay too late last night reading\\" thriller.  The story continues when Pendergast discovers who murdered his wife Helen and why.  I think it's a great continuation of an amazing series.  It could be read as a stand alone book, but do yourself a favor and read them in order, it makes this one SO much more exciting and suspenseful.<br /><br />While the stories in this series are sometimes way out there, they do a great job of incorporating just enough realness to make it all mostly believable.  Or at least make you question it ;)  They also through in a bit of dry humor and a lot of colorful vocabulary (and by colorful I mean words that aren't commonly used, not swear words).  I love books that make me stop several times to look things up because the writing is so vivid that I want to see it for myself.  And it's always fun to try and figure out which things are real and which are only real in their imaginations.  I will be recommending all of the books written by these authors (Just finished the other \\"Gideon\\" series as well) if you like suspense, thrills, a touch of sci-fi, detectives, science, action, fancy gun shootin', history, etc.nished the other \\"Gideon\\" series as well) if you like suspense, thrills, a touch of sci-fi, detectives, science, action, fancy gun shootin', history, etc.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I gave this book a 5 star rating because I could not stop reading this book. This is a story that you can relate too. The characters in this book are people that you can relate too. The way the story is written is different, but because  of the way that it is written, makes it even better. There are no words to describe this book except that you must read it.
0525478817|4.0|I swore this book wouldn't make me cry...and I was wrong. Partly because I didn't like the character I'd assumed was going to die first, partly for the loss of young love.<br />As the mother of teenagers, I found the author had a very convincing teenage voice. Although that can sometimes be very annoying, trust me!<br />I know this is a work of fiction, but the way Hazel spoke to Peter Van Houten didn't seem convincing. I also found their reunion to be contrived and unlikely.<br />But if you need a good cry, this book's for you.
1400079276|5.0|Murakami is a genius, and this book is but one tiny shred of evidence. I have heard rumors that he may win the nobel prize for literature (for IQ84, I'm assuming?)The mystery he creates is so amazing and it is just delightful to push your brain to pick it all a part. It was an absolutely beautiful story about essentially not being able to run or hide from your past. It is a shame more people do not read Murakami. I walk out into a Starbucks right now and ask each person inside if they had heard of him, and I doubt I would find a single one. But, anyone fortunate enough to be turned onto reading Murakami will quickly recognize they are experiencing the work of a true artist. I am so grateful that he exists.
B00BESKTMG|3.0|This film had enough (I guess) for me to watch the complete film...but the temptation to turn it off crept up numerous times. It did have some decently &#34;cool&#34; components (like the weapons), but it had so much unnecessary fluff, cheesiness and poor acting (particularly RZA) that it made it difficult to bear at times (often). Russel Crowe, to me, was one of the very few people in the film that actually added some substance (Liu is always colorful).<br /><br />I'm sure some will come to the film's defense with &#34;It's supposed to be a spoof on the old kung fu movies&#34;. Well, that's been done numerous times and it got played out long ago.
B008HK3XYK|5.0|I was having some difficulty trying to determine which case I should purchase.  The Amazon brand was so cheap feeling and very expensive.  This is nice and sturdy and what I was looking for.  Some people complain about the charging plug not working with the case, but I just put mine in upside down.  I do wish there were more color options, but this case suits me fine for what I use it for.
B00APJLEGA|5.0|There is a game called Hotel Transylvania and it's an addictive game. I love the game and I love this movie. It's the best.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|Unfortunately I read this excellent novel at the time the movie came out. At first I hurried to finish it before seeing the film, but then... I saw it.<br />The book is written in different sections, each with its own century, narrator and themes.  At first, they seem to stand alone, and then the common threads start to emerge.  The writing is cleverly adjusted to suit each period, with new grammar and expressions in the 'future' episodes.<br />The author seems to be saying that love continues beyond death, and that injustices will eventually (over many lifetimes?) be resolved.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This calculator is fun to use.  I like it because you can change the skins.  And if you need all the fancy calculating stuff just turn it and uou can do all the complicated calculations!  Thanks, its good enough foe me.
B005AKFXZW|5.0|A beautifully crafted and satisfying book - it seems crass to say an adult Harry Potter however she has same skill as JK Rowling to create a world so intricate and detailed, characters so engaging that you wish you could visit and meet them.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an extremely simple calculator that was well thought out in design. Does exactly what I need it too and it doesn't complicate my already limited time with other distracting buttons I would use only once and a while.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Best book ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I love the lion . He is so cool. I love Toto too. I want to read again
B000ASATYO|1.0|I got this movie and it skips! I paid butt load of money for it just to find it skips!
B002RVCD0U|4.0|I liked the movie, and it was pretty good for a terminator movie, but this is from someone who not a hardcore fan.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|If you are a fan of persona or even if you aren't, this is a great game.<br />It improves in many ways over the original game and the new content is as entertaining as the main game.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|I was excited to get this movie, and it came in a decent time and was not damaged. Can't wait to see if it plays well in player.
1616550414|5.0|This is the perfect book for Zelda fans, great quality and a lot of interesting content including great concept art!
B00003JRCQ|5.0|I love this story and I love this version of Persuasion. I could watch this movie multiple times and still not get bored.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I was totally fascinated by this story when I read about Rodriguez in the NYTimes.  I just HAD to see this movie.  Well, I finally did and I have got to tell you it is such a great story and Rodriguez is so humble.  I encourage everyone to watch this -- and go out and buy the record/dvd.  How he did not get noticed here in the States is beyond me.  His music still speaks today.
B009LQKHIO|2.0|Ms Sanders has an interesting plot and likeable characters. It's a shame this promising novel is flawed by far too many spelling errors, sentence fragments, and comma splices.<br /><br />Even a character's name is spelled several different ways...Derrick, Derek, etc. The word &#34;cloths&#34; is used repeatedly when &#34;clothes&#34; is obviously meant. There's no excuse for this kind of proofreading errors. This reads like a very tentative first draft. I hope Ms Sanders can find several good proofreaders to catch the grammar (her as a subject pronoun??? REALLY!), and, as mentioned above, the other spelling errors, fragments, and comma splices.<br /><br />The errors detract from the story line.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Loved the written-as-a-letter style, loved the pop culture references and literary classics referenced, loved the characters. Afraid to watch the movie for fear of ruining the story!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is a wonderfully made movie with an encouraging message to follow your dreams and never give up. It was fun, exciting and gives you hope. I would recommend this movie for the whole family, however younger children might not find it as interesting as the adults, but the content is safe for kids too.
B00425S1H8|5.0|Works with XP, OSx and W7. I was able to get a 10+ year old lego robotics kit working again with this. installation was dead simple, I just wish it had some type of indication LED on it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down. I love Mitch Rapp  and all of the characters, the way their personality develops throughout the story. I had been looking for a replacement  for Reacher and I have found it!
B0031ES8P6|5.0|This Hello Kitty Beanie baby is so adorable.  I also go the Ballerina one, but this is my favorite one that I bought.  I bought this Hello kitty Beanie baby as part of a gift for a little girl.  The online picture is misleading with the color of the dress, and the size of the doll but that shouldn't keep you from buying the beanie baby. The doll pretty much sits, there isn't much going on with the legs or really a way to really interact with them.  It is just a stuffed animal to hold, love and squeeze.  If your child adores Hello Kitty, they will adore this beanie baby.  So pretty!
B009UWYFFK|2.0|*Minor plot references included, though no outright spoilers. . .<br /><br />If you think the highest achievement young women should aspire to is marriage, that you only get one chance in your life at true love, that incredibly controlling and deceitful fathers ultimately mean well and have the best interests of their children in mind - along with a host of other pseudo-traditional rubbish, you may enjoy this film. I watched it with another adult and we couldn't believe the shallowness of the paternal value-system this film portrayed. I'm not interested in hearing &#34;it's just a kids movie&#34; from people unconcerned about the potential influence of cinema on child development. That makes it all the worse. Hosts of youth-oriented films are released every year that make some effort to respect the youth they are primarily directed at. This film's &#34;messages&#34; were ridiculous and insulting to today's aspiring young women. Even the most jaded parent can't possibly believe teaching a young adolescent they will only have one shot at true love is a good thing. I knew a middle schooler (many years ago) who killed himself, at least in part, because he apparently believed that very thing when his young love relationship went to pieces. The teen oriented, female character in this film apparently has no ambition beyond living under her father's controlling cape until she can one day venture out and get married. Heaven forbid she go to monster school and grow up to practice law. The other, more promising theme of the storyline, vaguely alluding to reconciliation between different groups and shelving longstanding prejudices, plays second fiddle to the daughter's storyline - and frankly becomes largely lost in the frenetic visuals of the film and endless stream of (almost entirely unfunny) attempts at on-screen humor. Come on - they included nearly the entire Universal monsters pantheon. . .and this was the best they could do?<br /><br />The vacant storyline aside, visually the film looks great. The 3D version has some nice effects. The voices are done reasonably well. A couple of scenes went on - in my opinion - a little too long and watching it started to feel like a chore after a while, but the effects kept it marginally engaging. That said, there are much better options available for family entertainment. *1/2
B002VHI8J0|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Just loved the interaction. Isn't it true that sometimes you met someone and feel as if you have known them forever. Hope the movie doesn't let the book down.
B006M4F67A|5.0|THE BEST! I have tremendously enjoyed this app. I love seek and find types of games and this certainly keeps you entertained and every day have to go back and try to break the record I've set. Recommend this HIGHLY.
B009M1QRM8|5.0|Hopefully when Pendergast comes back from his trip that we will see more amazing adventures with him and Tristram. The question will be: Where is Alban?
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Good family viewing but not juvenile. You forget your troubles as you travel back to a more innocent era, and an entirely different level of daily struggles and joyful celebrations. Stunning cinematrography.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I'm used to spy, espionage, &#34;Bourne-Identity-Type&#34; novels and yet found this fascinating and extremely enjoyable. I will be trying out more of this author's novels.
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|This was a little mundane and occasionally silly.  Not the level of Bond movie I expect.  And waiting for 7 hours to have it download to Tivo kind of tweaked me.  Can't see how they can call it &#34;Instant Video.&#34;
B000JZ45LQ|5.0|Cher has always put on a good show. She seemed to be having fun, what more can I say. I hate these reviews, why do I do them...?
0316228532|2.0|The gloomy town inhabited by the troubled characters in J.K. Rowling's novel, The Casual Vacancy, presents the worst possible components of community. People here are cruel to each other, neglect their needs and live close to one another but in separate worlds. The most appealing character in the novel dies in the first few pages. I slogged through all 500 pages immersed in the sadness of the many lives Rowling presents to readers. Some of the teens are more mature than the adults, and all characters have something to hide or are dealing with one struggle or another. I found that I finished the novel feeling depressed and saddened and concluded that the time I spent reading it could have been spent in better ways.<br /><br />Rating: Two-star (I don't like it)
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I barely got to chapter 6 and had to stop. What a waste of money. The writing style and maturity was disappointing, the attempt at taboo sexy was too obvious. It made me sad to think that a company published this purely for the shock value instead of wanting to share a quality piece of literature.
B002UPQ246|5.0|Years ago I bought the LP for Dock of the bay but all of the songs are great. Still have the LP but wanted clean recording for the car. Wonder what would of been next if he didn't die in the plane crash? Price was also to low to pass up.
B008KWHM6U|5.0|I loved every song on this album and it shipped so fast quick too. I am happy with the service.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|It has a lot of additions that make it a fresh new game over the original yet still keeps the same simple yet addictive gameplay.  Only issue is it seems to be just a tad glitchy occasionally.  It seems to be very rare so far though.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|As the title says, this game is oh so fun! I recommend it to anyone who likes games of this genre.
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|James Bond, ladies, action, but something missing.  Yes it's 007, I think I was cheering more for the bad guy then Bond in this one, just noticed that back in Scotland in the home of Bond  where he grew up was named Skyfall, good one.  About time Lady M was finally offed, yes she is a fine actress and you can catch more of her acting on PBS, but come on now, they should have written her off in the last Bond.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Be careful. Downtom Abbey slowly grips you until you're addicted. We've seen all episodes through end of season three. Can't wait until four.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Great album, good quality sound. Support the artist buy here for.cheap! Good videos on deluxe edition (thrift shop) can't beat this deal 4$ for the whole album electronic download.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|This program is more than just a calculator. it allows you to work complex problems without having to carry a bulky calculator.
B0068RHSCW|5.0|Ok, there are ghosts... Yes, definitely. Or there aren't?  This ambiguity is one of the valuable assets of this fantastic story. Different point of views, many narrative twists (and maybe you can guess them even if you haven't seen the absurdly giveaway trailer-but who cares?), alternate realities...  But it's not a horror! I's a very imaginative thriller and also a romantic, heart- wrenching ghost story (that somehow reminds me of \\"Ghost\\"). Scaring and touching. Don't lose it!
B0042X9L6A|5.0|The LCD on the back has plenty of information and you can easily control the flash's features. It integrates well with Nikon Cameras.
B0047SF41G|4.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot but I am a Predator fan.  It is an interesting spin/twist on the original theme that possibly helps give more insight into these bizarre creatures.  I like the special effects and the cast of characters is very interesting.  Yes, this is SciFy, but I like it.
B008PC1GF8|5.0|Karajan's Bruckner is always interesting, always different from the rest. This is a great performance, the Vienna Philharmonic play like gods and the sound is pretty good with a touch of grain.<br /><br />One of Bruckner's finest passages, certainly one of the most sinister and frightening, from letter E to F in the 1st movement, is played with the upmost tension.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my granddaughter loves this game. we have it on our ipod and our kindle fire. She can't wait to come to nanas and papas to play with her horse.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|It's interesting and keeps me entertained. Requires some thought but not so much that it's exhausting. I recommend this for small intervals of spare time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love it. My kids to do. Its easy and totally addicting. I find myself playing it at work on my lunch break. And the kids love to play it on long car rides. Yes it does get faster and that makes it harder but I love it.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|The brand new cd was in brand new condition and was great listening.  I'm glad I bought this and enjoyed.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Bought it as a digital download for 1.99 after receiving a coupon.  MP3 Music quality was good and I would order more music in this format.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the graphics. But I don't like that the way the game is like based on temple run. But basically I love the game.
B00A46H3J6|5.0|This is my favorite album from them, I have loved it forever. I used to wear my cassette tape out.
0770435726|4.0|This book was recommended by a friend and they were right in their praise. This is a well plotted literary spy novel that does a good job in discussing family relationships.<br /><br />When Kate's husband tells her that he's had a business offer to work in Europe and that it would mean much more money for the family, Kate is surprised but there isn't any reason not to accept.<br /><br />Once they arrive in Luxembourg, her husband begins working long hours and doing extensive travel throughout Europe.<br /><br />They meet another couple who are also from America. These expats become friendly and are often with Kate and her husband at social events.<br /><br />Eventually, Kate wants to know more about her husband's work and why these new friends have so many questions and interest in Kate and her husband.<br /><br />The story has many twists and turns and moves from various European countries, all well described.<br /><br />The author has been nominated for an Edgar Award for the best first novel. I think it is deserving of the nomination and recommend it to other readers. It also shows Kate's resourcefulness and the degree that she would go to in order to protect herself and family.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I play with my daughter all the time, and I can not draw worth beans! This is a great game.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|The critics panned this movie infairly.Great special effects.Storyline a little dated but the original book must be a 100yrs old
B004ZA9HB4|1.0|this one is over rated and did not work so well with my kindle fire..better luck next time other devices may work better
B0049P1VHS|5.0|watched it when it originally aired on AMC.Got so much more out of it when I viewed it a second time at home
B009EEFTMC|5.0|an interesting alternative to Mahjong.  More of a challenge because of its 3D effect.  If you like 3 dimensional tic tac toe this is for you
B00AEBB9O6|3.0|This is a great movie, very underrated in my opinion. However, I bought this blu ray and expected crisp 1080p picture quality. However, there are some grainy moments in the quality of the picture. It looked as if I was using an older dvd player with the three A/V components. There are also some strange dark blue streaks in the picture here and there. The disappointing thing is that this there was never any &#34;Wow&#34; Hd 1080p moments. The movie takes place in a lush jungle and you would think that there would be some great photography and HD moments. None comes to my head. If you really want to buy this movie, get the dvd. The blu ray is a disappointment.
B008MM9630|5.0|love the game its so cute there so much you can buy and change fun for all ages. my kids and I love to play
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is one of those puzzle games that requires no skill but is addictive. Great way to pass the time if you don't want to exert alot of mental enegy. The shapes and colors are weirdly relaxing.
1427210241|2.0|After 20+ years ---  there were so many missed opportunities for a great story ending.  Instead, this is just so-so.  The narrators, of course, are excellent.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Some books about this subject come off too cheesy and \\"made up\\" sounding. It was a refreshing surprise that not only was it written so well, it was very profound.  It wasn't a \\"finding Jesus \\" moment, it was a whole story written about his life that all melted easily with the story of his experience.  Well done!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I love my Kindle and I purchased this cover for it.  I've been using it for nearly two years and it looks a good today as the day I bought it. If I need another one, I would come back for one of these.  Thanks!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever seen. Entire cast up & down are amazing. I would recommend this to everyone, it is refreshing to watch a show full of substance and morals.
B006QS07IK|5.0|This was a good read. It was in the original text and they gave the definition of some words, which is a plus. Also has a gorgeous cover!
B009HV2JT8|5.0|Must see movie. Made my evening exciting and Benjamin Walker was superb in it. Perfect movie to cuddle up with someone on a cold and windy nite...
0811879631|5.0|The book represents us a artistic world of storyboard in Pixar movie. Every storyboards are well prepared and they can inflect the main sense of the movie
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Love Christian Bale in The Dark Night Rises.  Movie was well made and special effects were as expected...AWESOME! I recently purchased this DVD to add to my Batman Collection..
B009K0P10K|5.0|Awesome show! However, I will stick to downloading my episodes from iTunes when needed. Amazon's instant video leaves a lot to be desired. The video kept freezing so a 45 min episode took almost 2hours to watch :(
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|Mark Wahlber was hysterical in this comedy. Was feeling in the mood for a little comedy and this movie definately fit the bill...
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Arrived in great time, now I can watch whenever I want!  My husband had not seen the show and now he is enjoying<br />it too, at his own leisure!  Great script writting, great acting and beautiful setting!
B0071NLG0W|4.0|I am truly hoping that this is not the last book in this series because they keep getting better and better.  This is book 3, it can be read as a stand alone, but the series is such fun why miss out on the previous books.  The characters are funny and quirky and loyal .  The romantic chemistry between the h/h is palpable.  The mystery aspect is engaging and suspenseful.  The author has  a great sense of comedic timing and a writing style that flows freely and is a pleasure to read.  All told, a great story that will keep your interest and make you laugh out loud.
1442419814|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book. I think it brings up a lot of great questions about how we perceive ourselves and others, and I liked the environmental ethics angle as well. Westerfeld did a nice job with the world building here. The whole concept of creating \\"pretties\\" completely freaked me out, and I felt a distinct sense of horror every time the characters spoke so casually of the horrific procedure that leads to becoming pretty.<br /><br />I did feel that some of the characters were a little flat throughout most of the book, especially Tally, but I did see growth there by the end of the book. For most of the book, I was more invested in the plot than the main character, which is unusual for me. Tally struck me as selfish, shallow and one dimensional, and I just couldn't make myself care what happened to her. It really bothered me that the most important thing in her world was getting this ridiculous surgery, so much so that she was willing to betray her only friend to get it. I was more invested in Shay, who seemed to have a lot more depth and frankly, a more appealing personality. By the end of the book, however, I noticed that I had started to identify with and care about Tally. She changed so much over the course of the book and I found myself hoping that she would be able to outrun the consequences of some of her bad choices.<br /><br />At the end of the day I thought this series had an amazing premise, but to me this book was good, not great. It was fun to read, and it was definitely a page-turner, but I didn't feel like it was the kind of book that I would still be thinking about weeks after finishing it. It was really the dramatic ending of the book that compelled me to give Pretties, the next book in the series, a shot. As you'll see when I post that review, I am so, so glad that I stuck with this series!
1409303187|5.0|I ordered two of these and gave each book as part of  party give-away.  Impossible to find Peppa stuff here in the US, so these were great.  The stories themselves are really cute too.  Very simple to read.  Perfect for ages 2-5.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|Great plot and character development.  I love the continuation of the story (I've read 3 of his books) as the characters age. Zafon is one of my favorite authors.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game is amazing!!  I hated for it to end!!  The story line was a lot of fun and not to creepy.  Now where is number 2?!?!
B005HEDI3K|5.0|It just doesn't get any better than the original! Everyone needs to have this in their memory banks, enjoy it!
075669812X|5.0|My 9 year old nephew is all about Ninjago. I gave him this book for Christmas and he spent hours going through it to see what characters he is missing. Very informative!
B00A9X9TIW|2.0|Then you will love this &#34;gritty,&#34; depressing, anti-heroic &#34;sci-fi&#34; fable (not even a parable, which would have given it some sort of redeeming quality; but, no). The only redeeming act, of course, is that the looper commits to ending the loop, producing  a possibly favorable outcome in the future; IF, that is, the kid grows up under the loving care of his mom and does not become the evil actor hinted at. The premise is clever, but one-note overall. Not living up to its potential development. But then I am a fan of more &#34;mainstream&#34; sci-fi: Serenity, Star Wars (original), and that ilk. Geez, I wish they'd make movies of Time Enough for Love and Foundation and THAT ilk. Solid, entertaining, epic.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Wonderful story, feel good movie with a little sadness of reality. Have a box a kleenex at the ready... LOL
B0073LWEXK|1.0|I don't know, maybe there's something wrong with me but I didn't enjoy playing this game at all! In my understanding games have to be easy to understand in the beginning and make sense, this one did not at all. If you enjoy games where you have to look forever and try to figure out how to get past something combined with lame 2D graphics this is the game for you. If not, don't waste your time...
B0043RSK3K|5.0|As high school students we were given what I refer to as the `hero and industrial giant history textbooks'.  In them we were instructed in how the world was reformed through the eyes of the warring victors, were shown how the rich nobility shaped and formed societies, and were, quite honestly, propagandized into believing that the USA was in fact a flawless gem of humanity that was not only separate from the dregs of the rest of the world but had risen far above the countries they left behind.  As I stated in my title, all of history is a subjective viewpoint that is told in order to convince others that historical events occurred as they were reporting on them.  Objective reality and subjective reporting are, obviously, are seldom the same.  The good guys do not always wear the white hats, democracy does not always benefit the culture onto which it was thrust and the decisions of the moneyed elite seldom positively effected the masses.  Such is the nature of our historical reporting.<br /><br />Oliver Stone and Peter Kusnick, along with Howard Zinn, never make the false claim that their reporting has come from on high as were made of our high school history books.  Stone and Kusnick state emphatically that their viewpoints are made from a politically neutral standpoint and not from the ruling party's political mantra.  Zinn, on the other hand, makes it quite evident that his view of historical events are through the eyes of the common man. As were our high school books, these writings are riveting!  A bright light is suddenly shined on old pretexts and, because of the ignited glow, we are now able to see all of the characters and actions that occurred throughout history and not just the heroes and industrial giants.<br /><br />From this viewpoint I make the following educational/ informational suggestion:<br /><br />#1.  Make all three viewpoints part of classroom study.  I am certain that if this were done the myth of American exceptionalism would quickly become a thwarted claim and that the world as it really is (and not the existing illusion) would be revealed in all its beautiful, yet horrific colors.<br />#2.  Do not, under any circumstances, allow the entrance of pseudo-historical materials.  At present the Texas Board of Education is making a concerted effort to rewrite American history into something that it never was;  a country that was founded under biblical and Christian principles.  The founding fathers, in order to distance themselves even further from previous English theocracy, created a purely secular government based on \\"We the people.....\\".  It was never meant to be Theocratic England 2.0...............thwarted claim and that the world as it really is (and not the existing illusion) would be revealed in all its beautiful, yet horrific colors.<br />#2.

B00AHSIQWE|5.0|There were a few bad reviews for the movie, but for the most part it was well-received. I greatly enjoyed it, and Im sure any fan of the previous two will agree. Great ending to the trilogy.

B000059T00|5.0|Blind Faith has a superb sound with a superb lineup. Clapton, Winwood, Baker and Grech can really steal a show. This record is a five-star buy and comes highly recommended; not to mention, you can listen to it all the way through. The deluxe edition box set is definitely way too expensive, but if your willing to starve for a week then buy it.<br /><br />A++

0316228532|5.0|Harry Potter wasn't my cup of tea, I stopped reading after 1/4 of the first book.I am in awe with this one. Hard subject,very much like XIX. Naturalism in French literature after 1860, admired Zola, it is likely that you may admire Casual Vacancy also.<br /><br />Sadness... But don't many people live like this? As abusers, bigots, or victims,as activists whose efforts meet without misunderstanding, or even hostility because other are hostile to people who the activists help? Or some people live in cold indifference without much thinking or feeling about ethics, because they have not the problems the others experience? Or do others who are terribly deprived labor in heroic ways and are met with disdain while they are heroes in their own way?(\\"Bad girl\\" Cristal in this novel for example). J.K. Rowling takes sides, but sides often need to be taken, and she explains why, and does it indirectly, without preaching, through showing, not saying.Brilant work with great attention to detail and fine story telling.<br /><br />Some complained that R.K. Rowling heavily criticized the middle class. I think everyone gets criticized.There are the upper crust members, people who live in the Sweetloves mansion.Those are not very present in the novel, but they are not angels. Middle class is criticized,as probably more visible in every day society in which we live, but the poor are getting their bitter critique, in their case they are more excused. For example heroin addiction is no ta choice,after all, is a very strong compulsion which is a battle, authors shows it. Or self harm, she explains the psychology behind both cases very well. And in cases of other problems. For sure j.K. Rowling did her homework, I admire that, she didn't shy away form difficult matters.<br /><br />This book is not an escapist one, and in addition to its own literary qualities this is has value on its own. Some art, writing serve as conscience of societies, this work is one of them.WE need such works,as we need investigative journalism, but it takes courage to deal with such subjects. This book shows a society which is morally in state or morally bankrupt.Which doesn't mean that all people are devoid of ethical instinct,or total war mongering sadists of some kind, no.There are of course kind of sadisits and victims among them: too ignorant to be nice,or have real sadistic streak,  have trouble with temper and no insight whatever.Or victim admiring the tormenter of all family, the battered wife who doesn't help her children but admires he husband and always excuses him.And quite a number of examples of dysfunctional interaction between people.So, it is not a pleasant read, rather one which can make someone cry.<br /><br />The book has two buildings which I find symbolic: ruined abbey on the hill and mansion which belonged to the gentry, the Sweetloves.No monks no Sweetloves are there anymore. The monastery had inhabitants who were daily devoted to high standard of morality,as much as we may criticize them, and see them as foreign, they did their share of effort and often were good example. Gentry, with all privilege and bigotry relating to class did effort to make their ways of life more gracious, filled with respect to others, even if this respect was directed to their own class only. In any case members of those types of communities respected their own member if they were ethically advanced. Not so for the community of Pagford.Yes, Barry Fairbrother does his great job, and only some can understand him, other engage in their petty local politics and hostilities fueled by ignorance and bigotry.<br /><br />The empty ruin of Christian monastery overlooks the community which claims to upheld high moral standards, but is not. Sweetloves' mansion is on the same level as the rest of community, just set apart,and other empty or inhabited by empty people to whom privilege in not obliging to anything, no noblesse oblige, they don't have any sense of obligation but they feel above all and enjoy their elevated position as a reason to feel above others and feel disdain. The hope for the  community lies in those who are able to break from it constrictions, have mental courage to face those who are empty.
B00A9C3RNQ|5.0|This is a fun and poignant movie with a curmudgeon and a wimp.  They both turn out to be better and any married person can relate to them.
0140177191|4.0|Entertaining.Long book, lots to read to be absorbed into another world. I liked the pace, slow, like life during those days probably was, weaving and other chores, slower journeys than today. Familiar story retold from women perspective, one lifetime. So, the pace or even certain level of repetitiousness didn't bother me, it works for the story.<br /><br />Epic tale, strong emotions, but are the heroines really so strong as often said? I don't think so. Had trouble to relate to any of them, but this is not too bad in itself. Morgause is an independent woman who has control about her thinking and emotions, i liked her. The book is talked often about as feminist,so, I expected more. The sense of \\"empowerment\\" in some of them is such that often the women deserve rebuke, \\"what?! You silly childish woman!\\"  Of course the characters of all females have depth, their weakness is part of their humanity,they are more believable. Viviane? No, very hypocritical.Igraine? Passive one who without questioning accepts some prophecy to have child. Motivated by frustration in her marriage? Weak in general.Morgaine: why to plot sex with man who doesn't love you? Lack of dignity or some kind of drop of pride, (this healthy one, not the I am above the other 's type of pride).Kind of sexually free but chronic underachiever. Gwenhwyfar is beautiful but totally shallow, and she is a Christian, so, she is of course as other Christians in the book.And males are really tow dimentional, in a novel of this lenghts they could be better fleshed out.Female characters don't become better in the contrast with poorly developed male cartoonish personages.<br /><br />The author doesn't make claims about historical accuracy, which is nice. I understand that the author wanted to present clash of cultures  and she did it well, even though it was very much black and white, it worked in an epic tale, coming out from nostalgia. Similar nostalgia which swept XIX c. and resulted in rediscovery and love for allthings Medieval.Zimmer Bradley wanted to show an extreme, which happened too. We don't know much about the days the novel describes, but not all tribal societies were converted with fire and sword, this is more an outdated view.  What we gather from writings by Romans and later, and what we know about Druids and Insular Christianity (called popular  Celtic Christianity). The transition from Paganism into Christianity was more like in Rome or some other pagan Germanic  societies.<br /><br />Lots of things seem overlap so much, that rather the other extreme was possible, that people slowly forgot the old ways.Slowly,as the regular folk didn't know much about Christianity. But Celtic aristocratic males, like Druids before them, (regular male wasn't allowed to become a Druid,lets face this uncomfortable truth for once) instead of living for 20 years in seclusion in one sex communities and learning and preserving learning about religion and rituals, and later exercising considerable political power, now were living as Christian monks devoted to learning and excercizing also lots of political power.Christianity was religion of aristocracy, and Celts were not an exception in binding religion to royalty, plenty other did it also, the Merovingians for example. There are other aspects overlapping, but to keep it short, I add respect for women in Insular Christianity, which came for Pagan ways.Women religious were judges, highly educated doctors of their days, had influence on politics, and even some abesses were in charge of male monasteries.[[ASIN:0312252889 Hemlock at Vespers: Fifteen Sister Fidelma Mysteries]] are mysteries where sister Fidelma is the detective, crime stories, but they show quite a knowledge about this still unfamiliar type of Christianity and powerfull women there.<br /><br />Historians have concept called historical text. Historical text actually doesn't need to be writing, it can be a movie, as song, a sitcom, etc. Those texts are mirrors of the societycontemporary which nurished given work. What Mists of Avalon say about us today? Of course women who were unhappy in their marriages existed always,so, many may find the story of Irgaine very appealing.Like in XIXc. with technology not only helping, but also invading human lives, there is  a level of nostalgia about old ways, viewed as better ways.Erosion of partriarchal authority of course calls for inserting women in history and legends, uncovering their stories, this book does it in an excellent way.Huge appeal here.Also frustration with Christianity or dominant religions in general ranging from mild frustration to real hate for sure can be channeled and finds collective expression through descriptions of horrible Christians. Also the enemy, Saxons, and danger they impose, have strong appeal.Enemies are important building blocks of any epic tales, they are and touch strongly on collective consciousness and appeal to collective fears.No wonder this book is so popular.<br /><br />I simply wish women would be able to create as strong female hero figures as men did before them for themselves.Nothing if this kind here in this book.But male heroes were connected to male warrior cultures, and such cultures have a lot of self respect and very high level group solidarity.(Aristocracy for example). Sadly, the oppressed people have less of this.This book shows that well, we women can accept with gladness women protagonists even as representing feminist ideas just because story is retold form a women perspective (and very well done)while we accept some women weaklings and even call them \\"strong women\\" when they are not strong. Manupulativenes, which is character feature of some women in the book, is not a real strength. It is a weakness. Some of the oppressed tried desperately to regain some power through it, like in the silly proverb that the man is head of the house but the women is the neck.Too much problems with women in this book for me to love it, to give it five stars.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Excellent work by Follett!  Continues with many facts during World War II and all of the same family members along with children and their grandchildren.
B003MC5N28|5.0|Great book, it is one of my favorites. I recommend this to every one with a taste for a good sci-fi read!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Yes, I read the books first. I realize this is a series that must be watched from start to finish and that folks who popped in to see one episode in the middle of the series were left feeling confused and, it seems, annoyed. I loved the books and, despite the violence in the later books and movies, I think this was a great series. If you haven't read the books, though, it might be a bit less understandable.  I don't know that from personal experience, but it is something someone has said .<br /><br />It's Sci-Fi-Fan in a delicious, magical format. Enjoy!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Absolutely LOVED the books!  Read all three books in three days. Am now reading them via my iPad to our middle and high school students. Highly recommended.

B009VLX8FS|5.0|I like Taylor Swift and this is a great album. Lots of fun upbeat songs and a few slow ones too.
B00AGKH45I|5.0|This box set is worth the money! You get a remastered version of Rumours which is a timeless album. Next you get a CD of demos versions of the songs, followed up another CD of early band rehearsals of the songs. Next in line is a CD that gives you Fleetwood Mac's live show from that era. And to make things complete, there is a nice booklet of photos and liner notes plus the Rosebud DVD which has band interviews interspersed with a number of songs played live. For HiFi fans, the box includes vinyl. I am glad to see record companies making an effort to put out such comprehensive box sets when the music merits it. Highly recommended.

0316056871|5.0|First, you should not expect to read a Pulitzer-prize winning novel. It's simple. It's funny. Don't read much into it - let it entertain you. Once you expect something from a book and it doesn't deliver, it's disappointing. If the front cover made you crack a smile, you will enjoy the read. I received it as a birthday gift. I took the day of my actual birthday off of work. With the kids in school and the husband at work, I settled in and started reading it. I laughed so hard tears were streaming down my face. That has only happened one other time when I read A Girl Named Zippy. I couldn't put this book down even as it neared time for my birthday dinner and I debated whether I should actually shower for the occasion or finish the book. Out of respect for the public and my family, I showered. But it was hard to put it down. I even enjoyed the broken, no-rhyme-or-reason way she put the chapters together. It was a casual read, which I thoroughly enjoyed. When I'm the mood for classic literature, I won't think of Tina Fey. Keep this in mind and you won't be disappointed.

B0014BY72Q|4.0|Logan's Run is an interesting film. For one, it had an incredible concept at the time of its release. A world that is trapped by a giant bubble, where citizens can only live to the age of 30, where they are taken out and dispersed of in an extravagant ceremony. Of course, as would be expected once someone gets to the age of 30, they run for it to continue their life, despite a force of personnel called Sandmen whose main function is to kill the runners. Logan is such a man; however, when he goes into work one day, he is told to find the sanctuary and must go under cover as a runner, along with a woman he's been playing cat and mouse with.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much more information, because it will ruin the plot for those who haven't seen it. This is a solid concept and it is thrilling at times through about the halfway point or so. One of the other sandmen continue to chase Logan to the sanctuary; however, when they are done fighting him off, they realize they must go back to the city to show people there is an escape and a sanctuary. This is where the movie falls flat, because there isn't anything Logan and his woman are fighting anymore. The only other thing is for them to persuade the people of what they have found. In most movies, there needs to be that thrilling climax and this is where Logan's Run falls short because there isn't one.<br /><br />Having said that though, this is still a sci-fi movie that is worth seeing. Its interesting concept has influenced countless science fiction movies such as &#34;Minority Report&#34;, &#34;In Time&#34;, etc. where there is an age limit or a secret force that must infiltrate everyone's maximum age. Logan's Run just falls a little flat in terms of keeping the interest from beginning to end, not to mention it has its hokey moments as well.

0765325950|1.0|After all those books and so many story lines, this 'ending' is just too sloppy. When Rowling finished HP, the last book tied events from each book to how old Voldy was brought down. I guess I was hoping for something similar. There is nothing satisfying about how this verrry long story ends. This book felt like 90% battle & 10% story line. How things end with Aviendha, Elayne and Min is just stupid, totally does not match with their's or Rand's personalities. Matt & the Seanchan are a story completely left hanging. I mean, are the Seanchan going to honor any treaty about Aes Sedai's or what? Hard to tell because of what happened to Moghedien. Seems like they will be ongoing problems to deal with. Sorry, this book was just a HUGE letdown.

Enough is said by others but from a newbie stand point this book helps to get the basics.<br /><br />I wish the formulas and strategies that were discussed were a bit more clear. Also, Mr Graham doesn't tell that this is the silver bullet to investing but what worked for him.<br /><br />I highly recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Nicholas Sparks has done it again. This book grabs you, shows you in depths between all the characters. I hope the movie does this book justice. As a married mother of two young children I was heart wrenched at the ending. Cried my eyes out. Amazing book, amazing author!
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|Ok Sci-fi too much unreal futuristic cg special effects. slums don't float above the city.  Only high end apartments or offices would.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Well done film even though it is well traveled territory of being a misfit in high school. But the great cast brings it alive and a few twists deepen the story and set it apart. I must have missed something at the beginning however, because I didn't figure out it was set in the early 90's until about 20 minutes into it. Highly recommend.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It was absolutely amazing! I couldn't put it down for an instant!!!! Had me in tears more than once :')
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|works very well I would tell anyone if they need a basic calculator to use this on there amazon kindles
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Books are like todays politics in a fantasyland.. Takes you aback a little when the honest true man loses his head... sometimes hard to like a book that takes the carpet from under your feet.. but learned to like the story during these fine books.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Game is slow and boring. It has a life like quality. The pop ups to go to other games is crazy!  Not a go for me:(
1936608898|4.0|I'd seen a review of this book in a magazine and decided to learn more.  Even though I was working out regularly and thought I was eating a mostly healthy diet, I challenged myself to the Whole30 in October 2012.  By the end of the month I had lost 11 pounds.  Even though I was delighted with the weight loss and didn't miss most of the foods I eliminated from my diet, there were some things I missed on a psychological level and counted the days until the end of the month when I would allow myself to indulge again.  Reintroducing some of those foods to my diet was disappointing taste-wise.  Other foods were like hanging out with old friends again.<br /><br />I'm in favor of whatever approach is going to get someone's attention to improve their eating habits and food choices.  This one worked very effectively for me for 30 days and I keep it in the back of my mind.  That said, if someone is going to follow the Whole30 to the letter, I recommend having someone else do all your grocery shopping from a list, avoiding holidays and social situations, and eating alone or with a partner, roommate, etc. who is willing to follow the eating plan with you.  We all know that temptation abounds, and for me, after 3-4 days of self-imposed and willing &#34;deprivation&#34;, those temptations were looking sexier than ever!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|really gets on my nerves that everytime I share something...it takes me back to the top of the news feed and I cant share anything on my friends page. needs to be fixed!!!!
B001NHNG64|5.0|It was thrilling and exciting.  Suspensful all the way through.  I plan on reading every Reacher book.  Lee Child is an excellent writer.
B0095P33IW|4.0|It is another installment in the comic book heros coming to the big screen.  Not awesome, but Chris is gorgeous so it was fun to watch.  Liked the era appropriate settings and clothing . . . neat to see.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Loved this book. Fairy tale and reality, a great combination.<br />Lots of twists and turns and you can't wait to solve the mystery. I imagine many will be tempted to to look at the end of the book.  Don't do it!!
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is one book that kept me on to it until I could finish it.<br />Tough book to put down.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|I adore Mark Wahlberg and see all his movies. I really wanted to like this because I think Seth McFarland is brilliant.  Aside from a couple great lines and funny moments i thought it was boring and couldn't wait for it to end...  Sorry Wahlberg fans
B00797MB0O|1.0|Horrible.... Couldn't even force myself to finish it.... Do not waste your time. I can honestly say that it was just not something I would even consider watching for monetary compensation. It was just endlessly painful.
030758836X|4.0|I couldnt put this book down! I was completely engrossed in the storyline & kept wanting to get further & further ahead to find out what was going to happen.  I will admit, when \\"Part 2\\" began, I thought it was a little ridiculous & far-fetched, but as I kept reading, I got into it again & it was a little more believable to me.  I can see how some did not like the ending - I was hoping for a little something different as well & kept thinking that it would end differently, but I think the author tied it together & the characters did a decent job of explaining how & why it ended like it did.  All in all, this was a great book - its been awhile since I have read one that had me thinking about it throughout the day wondering what was going to happen & excited to start reading it again.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Fast moving ,exciting and likely accurate.<br />Highly recommended. The CIA in action.<br />It is the way it is in Afghanistan .
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Wow, that was fun and challenging.  great time waster in airports or between meetings.  Addictive but quick enough to play a few minutes and be done too.
B00608HMFW|5.0|i have been a Supernatural fan since it first aired. however, working most of the time i missed huge chunks of the story & missed quite a bit. so when i seen this set i jumped at the chance & grabbed it! i thought it was a pretty good deal especially for seasons 1-6.<br /><br />when the package arrived it was packed really well so that nothing would happen to them. all the cases & boxes were surprisingly in excellent condtion & not ruined or torn.<br /><br />so over all i am pretty pleased with it.  i can now watch the adventures of my fave hunters & angel anytime i want now, without worrying about what is going on in the storyline. cant wait for season 8!
0451418433|4.0|I am not enjoying this book as much as I did the first one in the trilogy.  Too much on the characters and not enough history.  The book is huge, if you are concerned about getting your money's worth!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|It doesn't put a razor edge on a knife, but it will get it sharp enough to do most anything you'd normally want to do with a pocket knife (which is why I bought it).  Good price, and very easy to use.  Getting a very dull knife back to a better-than-average level of sharpness is pretty much a breeze.  Good job, Smith!
B000QCQ8Y4|3.0|Not up to the best of Jack Reacher.....a bit slow and it was easy to put down, unlike most of the Jack Reacher series.
0143121316|5.0|Kissinger demonstrates his superb writing as well as his diplomacy throughout the book. He brings dry documentaries to life and animated such characters as Mao Tse Tong and Zhou En Lai. He showcases his diplomatic sensitivities and sensibilities through and through even as he is brutally honest about the various delicate situations he encountered in the 3-4 decades of involvement with China. Never did he come across as judgmental, condemnatory, and condescending of China and the Chinese even while he was honest with his own analysis. He GETS Mao and he GETS China and the Chinese! And Mao trusted and respected Kissinger. I suppose this is why the relationship between China and the US has taken a much more positive direction during the last 30 or so years. A must read for students of China.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game. Runcout of diamonds fast and they r not cheap to buy.  Game does give 500 coins a day but most things to buy require diamonds.
0307352145|5.0|Well researched and well written. Plenty of real stories showing how introverts are leaders and producers. It helped me understand my family (I am the only extrovert in the family), and it helped my husband and children understand themselves. My 20-something daughter devoured the gift copy I gave her in 2 days!
B0090SI4KG|4.0|Ok, so maybe Arnie isn't as young and limber as he was in movies like The Terminator films or Predator or The Running Man or Commando, but that doesn't mean he's not still capable of starring in a great action movie.  The Last Stand is his first lead starring role since his return from politics (with stints in Expendables 1 or 2 warming him back up for the big screen), and although it isn't the absolute best action movie out there, it still entertains!<br /><br />My dad and I both are long time Schwarzeneger fans...I grew up watching Schwarzeneger movies with him, and we saw many later films of his together too.  We both were jumping at the chance to see him on the big screen again where he belongs in the likes of Expendables 1 and 2, and once The Last Stand came around, we were sold on it as well.  My dad and I enjoyed every minute of it.<br /><br />Sure Arnie moves a little slower now that he's older, but he sure put on a good show in this film.  I won't go into too much detail about the movie, as you can certainly read about it for yourself, and I do believe a couple of other reviewers have already elaborated on the plot some, but I will say that my dad and I both enjoyed it.<br /><br />The action is good...with a couple of exceptions, there isn't a great deal of action right off the bat, but it gradually builds action-wise, until one big showdown at the end and a face off between evil (the villain) and justice (Arnie).  There was some good humor thrown in here and there too, and of course I had to chuckle at the fact that Johnny Knoxville was in this movie...before then I'd never actually pictured he and Arnie in a movie together, but it was honestly pretty great.  May not be an utterly amazing film, but it's entertaining and has some good action, and that's alright by me.  If you're an action fan, then definitely check this movie out!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I laughed, I cried, it was pure entertainment from start to finish.  I am so glad I started watching this series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book. I have read many of Nicholas sparks books and this was just as good of book as all of the other ones he has written. This book emits so many emotions. Definitely worth reading.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was very easy to purchase at a very reasonable price.  Story line is very entertaining. It leaves you waiting for the next installment.
B001IWUZYK|5.0|Just as I remembered it!  Although the story isn't exactly as Charles Dickens could have imagined, the musical score is phenomenal!  And, the ease of digital downloads through Amazon.com is very convenient!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|a feel good on a rainy day book.  Worth the time and leaves you feeling good when it's done.  Like the characters as well.
B0033B5XCS|5.0|I have always been a fan of these movies & was thrilled that I was able to find them! My children and I are now able to experience the terror Freddy Krueger as often as we like!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great plot and follow thru from Book 1. I love the style of writing and the feeling that you are there! A real page turner-already well into Book 3! Don't want it to end.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I recommend this to everyone with a Kindle Fire 2G (or similar). It's perfect, I've been using it for a month or so now, and I love it! Haven't removed the Kindle from it once, and haven't felt the need to. With its seamless design, you literally don't even know it's there! And the protection it affords the Kindle is nothing less than great. I drag it around and I'm not worrying about setting it down on a counter top where there may be a few drops of water. I shove it in my coat pocket and don't worry about scratching the screen. It's light, adding no noticeable weight, and it's good looking.<br /><br />Seriously, the Kindle is much more usable with the case. I haven't read so much in years!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Even though I was sorry to see the series come to an end, I really liked MacKayla Lane series. To me, it was reviting. I liked the characters, especially MacKayla and Jericho...even Vlane, until I discovered who he really was.<br /><br />In my opinion, it's a must read series!
B003AKEGRK|3.0|Quite literally I wasn't too thrilled with this movie. Not my cup of tea. Lovely cinematography though. I give it Three Stars
B00B8R1NP0|4.0|I don't usually choose murder mysteries to read, but once I stated reading this, I couldn't put it down until I finished.  The characters are likable...I wish I could've found out more about them (but it looks like there might be sequals).  The plot was fast paced right from the start and never boring as new twists and turns happened regularly. The crimes were graphic (I didn't think they were TOO gory) and kind of disturbing(which made it creepy-fun )...  :)
B00003CXBK|3.0|A friend recommended this movie, after I mentioned how much I enjoyed \\"Howl's Moving Castle\\" -which is far superior IMHO. This movie was long, violent, and plot wise just had a ton of ideology thrown at me. All the back and forth traveling, giving messages, got tiresome. Was that really needed? Story means storehouse, a place where things are kept. Give me those things but spare me the 2 hours plus to do so. Ugh. Should have been better than it was.<br />This being 2013, the material/message seemed dated. But I knew that going into it. So, if you enjoy animation at it's finest, you will enjoy this one. The Amercian voices are very good, though not entirely accurate-as said. Characters are pretty one dimensional-typical of the Japanese medium on anime. Oh, with the decapitations, this is not for children-be warned. Hope this helps.
B008G12ERC|4.0|I would have given this album 5 stars if it ended after track 9, however the last 4 tracks are lacking in many ways.  First let's start with the bad:<br /><br />10.  Save me - The bass player, Chris Wolstenholme, sings on this track, so it doesn't feel at all like a Muse song at all.  This song is boring, and doesn't really go anywhere.  Definitely could have done without this track.<br />11.  Liquid State - Bass player Chris Wolstenholme singing again!  Let me say if I wanted to listen to a song that sounded like Stone Sour, I would listen to Stone Sour!  In fact, this song was so un-Muse like, that I had to make sure that I was still listening to Muse, and that my MP3 player didn't glitch on me!  Chris, please stick to what you are good at - playing an awesome bass!  His voice is actually NOT BAD, but it just isn't Muse, and throws the album completely off.<br />12.  The 2nd Law - Unsustainable - Ok, so this song isn't horrible, its just not that great.  Very experimental, and builds up to nothing.  Thought I was listening to Deadmau5!<br />13.  The 2nd Law - Isolated System - Sounds like a score from a David Fincher film.  Not horrible, but not an epic way to end a Muse album like \\"Black Holes\\" or \\"Resistance\\".<br /><br />Now for the good:<br /><br />1.  Supremacy - Great opening for the album.  This track rocks, slows down a little in the middle, then rocks it out for an epic intro!<br />2.  Madness - In the direction of \\"undisclosed desires\\" on the last album, this song is actually very amazing.  It is slower and melodic, on the electronic side, but I love the electronic sound that Muse is experimenting with.  This song definitely gave me chills.<br />3.  Panic Station - This song rocks.  Reminds me of a queen song with a beat.  Very nice, and definitely my favorite track on the entire album.<br />4.  Prelude - Just the intro to survival really.  Piano is beautiful and melodic.  Wish it was longer<br />5.  Survival - This song was created for the 2012 Olympics.  When I first heard this song, I didn't know what to think, but it has grown on me.  This one is very reminiscent of Queen, and is one of Muse's more epic songs.<br />6.  Follow Me - Now I am a big fan of 80's music, and this song has an electronic riff that reminds me of the great 80's songs. This is one of my personal favorite tracks on the album.<br />7.  Animals - This song reminded me a lot of Radiohead.  A great song, great singing, and overall a great song.<br />8.  Explorers - This is a slower song, reminds me of \\"soldier's poem\\" from \\"Black Holes\\".<br />9.  Big Freeze -  Any fans of U2 or the album Joshua tree?  Well here is \\"where the streets have no name\\" version 2.0.  Haha...  Ok, maybe not exactly.  But this song has to have been influenced by U2.  It is uncanny the comparison, they even use the lyric \\"can we hole up and ride out this ELECTRICAL STORM?\\"  Coincidence?  Decide for yourself, but as soon as I heard the song, the immediately thought of U2.  Song is still great though, and I like it...  What can I say, I am a U2 fan too!  Great way to end the album in my opinion as the album pretty much ends for me after this song.<br /><br />Overall, I would have loved to give this album a 4.5 or a 5, because it has some of the best music Muse has ever done, and I like how it is unlike any of their other albums.  But after track 9, the album takes a turn for the worst.  And no matter how you cut it, the 4 songs are PART of this album.  I can skip them all I want, and I have a top notch 9-track Muse album, but the album was written and released with these songs included.  These are not just some lame bonus tracks, although I wish they were, they were INTENDED to be on this album, and therefore my rating is a 3.5 or a 4 overall because in my opinion they completely throw off the flow of the album.  My recommendation?  Pick up this album, rip tracks 1-9, and enjoy!  It is definitely some of the best music Muse has ever made, and I think for all the good songsone here, it makes for a pretty solid Muse experience.one here, it makes for a pretty solid Muse experience.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|the weather channel app works  great!  I love it...so keep up the good work weather channel..i love it!  yea awesome
B006H5120E|5.0|this is my all time favorite movie.  and what better way to watch it than in three d and in your own home.  the quality is great.  love this movie  can watch it over and over again.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|this is a hard game and the tiles are very small and I am not thrilled with it...so? don't know what else to say about it
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Janeway and crew have unique personalities and abilities that keep us guessing each episode. The quality of video is great on my Kindle and the whole family enjoys it on their Kindles as well. We watch it seperately then have fun discussion about the crew and ship.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This game is pretty fun but it lags a whole lot for me if I were you I really wouldn't get this game if I were u...also when u move it finger to duck down it moves me to the side and stuff like that.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Simple to learn and plenty of levels!  It will keep you thinking!  Best way to describe it is it's like a complex Chinese sliding puzzle.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I love  the fact that this romance  isn't sappy like some Twilight book, but you actually feel the character's emotions and feel like you are actually in the story
B000PMLFRA|5.0|The blu-ray format really sharpens these movies up and brings out sharp details in the backgrounds that were never noticed before. They altered a few things from the last DVD set release. For example, they changed Boba Fett's voice to the same one as Django Fett, they made Vader yell \\"nooo\\" at the end of Return of the jedi, and they added some visual details that were not present from before. Overall the changes add more positives than negatives, and it just depends on what the particular person likes and doesn't. I thought they were fair changes to keep things looking fresh, and to help keep things compatible with the prequel trilogy. For those that don't like the changes, I think Disney will release the movies in original unaltered formats someday. These films never get old for me, and they are a treasure to have in the best format possible.
B001AW156U|1.0|they triggers don't work on my conntroller, it would coust me more to send them back, I do not see myself buying any more of these.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|This one made me laugh, cry, hope and remember to live. It pulled me in and I became a part of the story but I have to be honest there was something lacking in the overall flow.  Initially I thought it could have ended better,but once I learned and read book tow I understood why it ended the way it did. I would recommend this one and book tow made it all worth it the more!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book is so good I would buy it for thousands it's like be royalty and it be so good It is only ment for the best I promise you will love after the first chapter and if your like me you will finish it the same day you buy is and I aware the auther is hooked up with the amazon store people because this book is so addicting u could sell it as a living and be a multimillionaire in a day it's that good
B0000AXE8I|4.0|great  movie on so many levels. My only criticism is in the packaging-the discs do not stay in the raised circular flanges on the inside cover of the jacket
B003JTHXOK|3.0|A nice easy, relaxing, romantic and engaging read but overall predictable. Not as riveting or memorable as Sparks' The Notebook.
B000OZ0NXA|2.0|The story was interesting for a while but it became like most of the other works with a 24 hour time line.  The plot was a bit unbelievable and not very innovative.  It does hold your interest if you ignore these flaws but it did not make me want to buy other books by Lee Childs.
B008XG1X18|5.0|An extremely useful app. It can help me be creative. I used it at first as a place to gather ideas for decorating a house but I use it for so many other things now. It has really helped me plan events.
B00AAX68HG|4.0|its worth plying good strategy graphics just a fun exp. its great for kids too actually think of course if u want the 3 stars
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was recommended to me (and the other 2 by same author) and they didn't disappoint!  I loved the characters, the suspense, the choice of author's vocabulary - all very intense.  Looooooved it!  Just be careful not to Google or talk about this book too much if you are going to read it - the haters of the world will try to spoil the yummy surprises for you!
B004MNO0BQ|1.0|bought for my kids. The paddles keep attracting each other like magnets. useless because they are stuck in the middle.
B002C949KE|2.0|Predictably vulgar for no conceivable purpose.  I found this book to be very tiresome and tedious....dare I say truly boring?
B0062NAVXA|5.0|The whole family loves this movie and since we have all boys it is great.  I would recommend it for anyone!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game looks so simple, but I have had it for two days and I am hooked. It is addicting once you get started playing. Flow free is so fun!
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Really enjoyed the film. Got a little bored at some parts, but overall it was well done. Spoiler alert: The airplane flying upside down is a little bit ridiculous, but if you can get over that I think you can enjoy the movie.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Interesting approach a historical event.  Captivating, had to keep reading to see what the next twist would be.  Highly recommend, if you can step away from history and enjoy the story.
B008JIFJ4W|3.0|Passion Pit has some great songs that really rock but the majority of the CD is sort of fluffy or disco'y.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|great game. love to play... gets better as you level up and acquire more coins and puzzle pieces. recommend it for all ages. I recommend it for all ages.y.<br /><br />(6g.  :((:

140053271X|5.0|The Nook is perfect. I've already read 2 books on it since I got it and it's absolutely worth buying.<br />It took me under a minute to understand how it functions and connected it without hick-ups to my computer to personalize the screensaver and load books on it.
1439102813|5.0|Compassionate, revealing, stunning: a must-read for anyone living with dementia or Alzheimer's disease whether in themselves or in a loved one.
0061537969|5.0|The second I finished this book i called my family members and told them they had to read it ASAP!! This book takes a look at the lives of humans through the eyes of the dog who loves them. While looking through Enzo's eyes throughout the story you can't help but begin to look at your own life from a different perspective. You  can't help but think about any beloved pet that you have had and wonder...what are they thinking, and want to give them a giant hug and say thank you for their unconditional love. This book reiterates the fact that we are in charge of our destiny and we are all connected. I was very deeply moved by this book and really hope that many others have the same beautiful experience reading it.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I loved the original series, which is NOTHING like this movie- however, this film stands on it's own as entertaining and funny, and was a great purchase!
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|THE BEST MOVIE OF THE YEAR, BEN AFFLECK WAS UNBELIEVABLE.. THE MOVIE WAS ONE OF TRUE GRIT AND DETERMINATION. I STAYED ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT,SCARED AND AFRAID OF WHAT WAS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. LOVED IT, CAN WATCH IT AGAIN

B0098460O4|5.0|SUCH A SWEET STORY OF FRIENDS  MADE MY HEART WARM  TAKE TIME TO LEARN THE STORY OF THESE TWO YOUNG PEOPLE
0374214913|2.0|Mr. Sloan's debut novel clocks in at a sprightly 304 pages of straight-forward prose. It's an enjoyably quick read, structured like a Dan Brown novel - replete with secret societies, conspiracy-ish theories, and long, dimly-lit passages of books/purple prose.<br /><br />So if you're the type to enjoy, erhm, Dan Brown novels, I don't think you'll be disappointed by 'Mr. Penumbra's.' But if you expect things like character psychology and the other niceties they teach in English 101: the English Novel... well, you won't find that here.<br /><br />In fact, the characters in 'Penumbra' were as flat to leave me feeling concerned for Mr. Sloan's mental state. Clay's love interest dresses like Pepper Ann [...] - she has an entire closet full of the same t-shirt. Our protagonist Clay isn't much better.<br /><br />I could be lenient on the author and say, 'Hey, it's only a 300 page book,' but I've seen better character development in early grade Schoolastic titles. I'm talking Clifford.<br /><br />What troubles me even more than the book's cast of cardboard cut-outs is its thematic techno-fundamentalism (please see [[ASIN:0520258827 The Googlization of Everything: (And Why We Should Worry)]]). Sloan's story throws 'craft' a bone (see: the almost interesting roomie who works for Industrial Light and Magic), but he takes a dump on traditional forms of knowledge production and accumulation. Books and bibliophiles are painted as unwise, uncool, and backward. Applications of technology by people who work at Google, however, are hip and 'good.' If you can overlook that whole capital accumulation thing.<br /><br />That said the book glows in the dark. Which I guess is pretty cool.<br /><br />If you want a thrilling, light yet intelligent read, go with Gillian Flynn's amazing [[ASIN:0307588378 Gone Girl]]. Far better use of your time.
B00138KKP8|5.0|Ray LaMontagne's amazing voice is enough to make every woman swoon and hope he's singing only to her. This album is just beautiful to listen to.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I laughed, I cried, I felt the love and pain. And oh my God, did I cry. It definitely pulled the heartstrings.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I kept it for 2 months or so and only played it when I was bored. I started playing for about an hour or so when I bought but then it kinda just turned into a waste of space. I really think this is a game for your kids to play on a car trip or when you need them to calm down.
B007OTZ654|3.0|For a 40th Anniversary Re-issue this doesn't quite hit the mark if you are a collector.<br />Having several versions that have been released this is not my favorite. Why couldn't it have been done,as before with extra tracks<br />and better packaging,say like with a good booklet. But still worth having.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The book is well written, the characters develop naturally and there is no forcing any point.<br /><br />I finished the book in under 2 days, I couldn't stop reading it, everything is in it's right place, trully a masterpiece.<br />Gonna read it a bunch more times for sure!
0765325950|4.0|This final volume of the series doesn't include a glossary, so if like me over the last couple of years you've kind of forgotten the distinction between algai'd'siswai and siswai'aman, or just what a so'jhin does, or exactly who some of the multitude of third-rank characters are and where we last saw them ... well, just keep on reading, and in a page or two you'll forget about it anyway.<br /><br />There are a lot of battle scenes. Sure, it is Tarmon Gai'don. But there are really a lot of battle scenes (and there seems to be a near-endless supply of Trollocs to be slaughtered in them), and quite a few of the battles are still just the preliminaries to the biggest, last one. Like the characters, one gets a bit numbed by all the fighting before it's over.<br /><br />Something I admired about the last two books was Sanderson's ability to satisfactorily wrap up a major storyline (the Seanchan raid on the White Tower, the rescue of Moiraine) just when I was beginning to fear there weren't enough pages left to do it in. Here he doesn't do quite so well -- this is a lengthy book, but some climactic wrap-ups of long-running plotlines come very abruptly and are over very quickly.<br /><br />But -- we might be saying some similar things even if Robert Jordan had lived to complete the series himself. Is A MEMORY OF LIGHT an awesome finale? No. But it's good enough, it's an ending, and actually it is a bit awesome that we got an ending to this epic, when Jordan left with three long books' worth of story yet to be written.<br /><br />Now, do you suppose ... just maybe ... we could introduce Brandon Sanderson to George R.R. Martin, and get some closure on that series too ... ???
1250004217|5.0|I learned so much from this book about France during the occupation, how the Jewish children were treated.and the events in Paris.
B00APUQRPC|3.0|I was entertained and intrigued with the beginning plot and entertained by the developing story. Not exclusively about playing the whole game of baseball.
0307477479|5.0|The book was in excellent shape.  The story is really phenomenal, interweaving many main characters into one cohesive story about people who pulled their lives together.
B000BNX4MC|5.0|Your collection would not be complete without it. Very entertaining! The other required comedies for a true collection are Bill and Teds  Excellent Adventure, Little Nicky and Undercover Brother. These movies are essentials for a collection!
1426308469|3.0|I thought the book would appeal to my granddaughter, who is 2 1/2 years old, as she loves dinasaurs.  This book does not work for toddlers, maybe for elementary school age children.  Too graphic and complex for younger kids.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|:Having used the iOS version of this app and the android version, I can say that the quality is consistent and ease of use is guaranteed.  I wish all apps did their job this well.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|Didn't find this book all that good. It to me was dragging on. Wasn't clear what he was trying to convey.
034580404X|3.0|They were enjoyable and quick to read, but if you've ever read twilight you can predict how each book will run - just add sex! The books can become slightly repetitive, the first with Anastasia constantly going back and forth about whether she wanted to be involved, the second with Christian trying to protect her and show he cares and Anastasia not listening, and the third them reviewing the first two books and going on about how much they love each other. Personally I found the constant descriptions of an &#34;inner goddess&#34; irritating but that was evened out by their emails back and forth (which are hilarious.)<br />It's very predictable as to when something bad will happen, because in the pages before everything reaches a perfect moment type of lull.<br />If you're looking for a sexy read you've got it though, every 3 pages or so is a new sex scene! Overall it was enjoyable, a simple read.

B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Rent - do not buy. Good movie. Love - love - love Denzel and the dramatic aircraft landing but don't think this is a flick I'll watch over and over again. Other memorable cast-members also make this worth watching.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|I purchased it because I am a fan of  Denzel Washington.  I liked the story line and his acting was excellent.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. Not your everyday predictable love story has a few twists and turns. Would recommend this to anyone. Very quick easy read!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Not as good as One-Shot, but still a very good Jack Reacher Novel.  It has a great plot and enough twists and turns to keep you guessing what might happen next.  Ends a little weird but I think that only adds to the Jack Reacher character.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham books very rarely disappoint and The Racketeer doesn't. It amazes me how many different ways Grisham can portray lawyers and make it good reading. Sometimes you want to cheer on Malcom Bannister and other times you wonder , what is he doing?<br />I loved this book. Just when you think you have it figured out you don't and you do.

B009LGO88E|5.0|I ordered this product in hopes that I would be able to use my larger 3ds with a circle pad accessory. I was the first of my friends with the best accessory available to the dsLL or dsxl.

The product was not available in the u.s. during my time of purchase, unfortunately, the only circle pad accessory was smaller for the regular size 3ds

0985081821|5.0|I read this after reading the novella that covers the life of another character in this book and I am hooked now! I loved the novella Her Sweetest Downfall and when reading this book I am happy that I was able to refer to the knowledge I learned in the novella to kind of clear a few things up. I thought the storyline of this book was interesting and I found myself becoming connected to characters pretty quickly. These characters, even though they are in a completely imaginary world, were pretty realistic and their reactions to situations were believable. They didn't seem forced or too out there. I will definitely continue reading this series and look forward to what happens in the future for these characters.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have read numerous Stephen King books starting with my first introduction to him in the \\"The Shining,\\" which I read as a teenager one summer.  I thought that book was nonpareil for paranormal, horror genre writing.<br /><br />Reading this book however, made me feel as if I found an entirely new author since it wasn't in the paranormal, horror genre, but science fiction.  I remember reading at least one other science fiction book by Stephen King, but I always thought he needed to stick to what he does best --horror.  After reading this book, I felt Stephen King accomplished a couple of things that I would criticize him for not being able to do in his other books:  1)  He was written a science fiction tale that Dean Koontz, Bradbury, and others could envy.  2) He included a good love story in his book.  (Maybe his main critique Tabitha helped here?)<br /><br />I think this book is such a great tale that it is on par with \\"The Shining\\" and it has reignited the same level of enthusiasm I had when I was 15 years old.  Awesome!<br /><br />Dear reader, try to pace yourself with this spellbinding, page turner!
0784011710|1.0|Even though I really like the two main actors I didn't even finish watching the movie. Sorry, and I really like Holocaust themed books and movies.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Heard the song on the radio (how old school is that?!), and got on Amazon to find it.  Listened to the previews of other tracks, and got the Album.<br /><br />Refreshingly different music with a positive attitude.
B003VR5PPY|5.0|I loved this game and I am a mother of 3. You do have to read a lot though from the beginning and to the very end. The game has multiple endings and you for sure have to at least play twice the game all the way through. My first ending was the knife ending which wasn't a true ending. It was jar dropping since it came on so fast. Than I had to check which ending is necessary to reach the true ending. Which I did since there are tons of choices you make in between, even during conservations. Well, at the third time playing the game through some of the beginning puzzles are easy to finish since you have done them already, but then you come across newer rooms and puzzles which is a lot of fun. Then towards the end it is one surpise after the other, and then the end. WOW all those hours reading the story lines were worth it to me, and I am older. :)Great game. I won't go through it another time but I do have choices to reach some rooms I haven't been in yet and I will be able to solve those puzzles, but you do always have to start with that first puzzle with the red and blue suit cases.
B003D83DPA|5.0|I think 'Sultans of Swing' was one of the very first songs I recorded for myself off the radio back in the 70's!  My dad had a couple of reel to reel rigs, one of which had a slot in the side for recording onto 8 tracks!  So I sat there listening to the radio until I heard the DJ announce it...  These days my tastes are a long way from that top 40 station, as is the technology for listening and recording.  I don't really understand why more music isn't being released on the high quality mediums available these days.  Yes it's not portable, so what?  MP3s honestly sound like crap and unless I'm exercising I want to hear better!  HQCD, SACD, XRCD all follow DVD-audio, and Blu-Ray which sound amazing on a killer surround sound system.  But I'm sad that so little music is available on all these formats.  If nothing else the greedheads in the record industry should salivate at the bottom line, since it's such a pain in the b#tt to copy a blu-ray disk.<br />Anyhow.<br />This is a great concert or compilation of 2 concerts, from a tour when Dire Straits were at the top of their game.  And lets be honest, having heard a few bootlegs of 'average' shows w/ poor sound quality that still rocked, I was really looking forward to this and Dire Straits did not disappoint.  I confess, I love a good jam...when a band knows each other and their songs inside and out that they can riff on them and find something to entertain themselves even while playing a song for the thousandth time.  We've all been to shows of bands playing their songs note for note from the album...or worse, playing 'improv' versions of their songs note for note the same each night (Sting, I'm looking your way, buddy)... You can tell the guys are having a ball on stage, and the versions of the songs reflect everything coming together.<br />Even tho' the '80's clothing kinda makes me giggle...that headband, honestly I'm not going to _watch_ this that much... but I will be playing this frequently to _listen_ to, with the screen only on just to get everything rolling.  Yes, the 'hair' is a distraction, yes the 16mm original doesn't look flawless under HD resolution, but to expect it to is unrealistic.  Besides, to me the visual portion and the extras on the disk are just gravy because this is a delightful, rocking and infectious concert to listen to.the screen only on just to get everything rolling.

B0049VZ222|5.0|Such a great show. It is so realistic its scary.  I purchased all of the season and enjoy watching them over and over.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|NOT HAPPY!  After banking \\"saving \\" my coins and reaching the highest missions...this game reset me and took me down to zero coins and put me back to the first mission.  It took away everything I earned and bought along the way.  Pretty stinky thing to do Subway Surfers!!!!  Took all the fun out of playing for me!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great game to kill time.  No complaints.  Since I'm relatively new to this type of game, I'l learning slowly.  Recommend this one.
B00358ESI4|5.0|Easily the best Viet Nam War movie ever made.  Did not try to invent backstories or add drama to something that did not need it.  Simply told the story of a group of men and women who deserved to have their story told.  Fantastic acting from Gibson, Elliott, and Pepper among MANY other top-notch actors.<br /><br />It is extremely refreshing to see a fim about this war does not depict our soldiers as bloodthirsty, drug-crazed, or criminally insane.
0553386794|5.0|George R.R. Martin is a master with the written word and at bringing it into vivid life within your mind.  The angst, fear, tension and even joy that he builds within you as you read is unrelenting and wonderful to enjoy, and keeps you turning and turning and turning the pages until, before you know it, the book is finished and you're rushing out to buy the second book.  George R. R. Martin's A Game of Thrones flows like a river and is filled with twists, turns and wonderfully spellbinding moments.  I highly recommend, A Game of Thrones.

B00992CF6W|5.0|my brother recently got a new tablet. he had gotten minecraft too. he has always loved minecraft and on the computer he'd always download the demos since we cant afford to spend 30$ on a computer game. this one is cheaper and pocket edition. I recommend this and I cant wait till I can get this app myself.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|The format is easy to use for re-viewing either whole episodes or a scene.  Of course the production, and the actors superb.
B0096CDG0O|2.0|I really enjoy playing this game.  I don't like that players can buy extra turns, but I just avoid playing with those that do.  The big issue is that notification is no longer available.  I loved hearing the dice shake to tell me it was my turn, but no more.  No notification at all.  That makes it really hard to keep a game going.  I contacted the developers, but no response.
B006AZZPCM|1.0|I love this app but for some reason it just has stopped working. I re-downloaded the app, but it still doesn't work! Please fix this!

B007MB5OCE|3.0|After reading a sample the book sounded like it would be really entertaining and a delightful adventure, so I bought the book..... What with a one hundred year old man trapsing around Sweden, killing people and dodging gangsters, it seemed exciting.....And it was,........ for the first twenty-five or so adventures. After that I couldn't take any more adventures (and this was only into about a third of the book!). Maybe I'll pick it up again in a few months.

B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love electronic nah jongg and this one is great. There's so many layouts and though its set up so you can always win eventually the difficulty level of some of the layouts makes sure you'll keep coming back to get a better score. I recently went on a trip and this game saved my sanity while waiting to board planes and while squished into the third world like conditions of the interior of the plane.

B004UID2LC|2.0|I loved it...first. Videos would load fast and wouldn't slow slow. But as time went by it became slower and slower and sometimes I can't even open the app. I have to keep turning of my kindle fire just to watch ONE video I'M NOT EVEN KIDDING then after that I can't even open the app, ridiculous right? So it's worth it in the beginning but for me it slowed A LOT over time. When you get it remember that this happens to me so it might have happened to other people. Like this comment if this comment if this happens to you.
B0090X4GLW|4.0|I like that the disc is in order like the movie. Fun to listen to and makes me smile thinking about the movie.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think it is the best game in the app store I can almost play it all day every day. So buy the best there is. It is definitely worth the 6.99 so get it. But why does it take amazon so long to update it?
B00A3ATW4M|4.0|I really like this disc. Great music, great mash ups. I hope there is another disc for the rest of this season as there are many more great songs not on this disc.

B003XVYLDU|5.0|This is considered a classic and deservedly so. It is almost equal parts anti-war novel and science fiction, and is thoroughly enjoyable. There's never a dull moment and there are some very interesting ideas to take away. Many of those ideas are conveyed by means of the Tralfamadorians, the aliens who abduct the book's main character.<br /><br />Yes, the book's main character, Billy Pilgrim, gets abducted by aliens and then proceeds to tell others about it. His daughter tries to get him to stop. But at one point in the future, others actually listen to Billy and believe him. Yes, Billy Pilgrim also travels in time. Unlike most sci-fi stories of time travel, in this case Billy has no control over when he time-travels and to what point in time he travels to. As a result, we learn about things which occurred well after World War II before we learn all the details of the war. It's a very interesting way of telling the story.<br /><br />The main focus of the World War II portion is the bombing of Dresden by the Allied forces late in the war. Billy Pilgrim was among prisoners of war who were being kept at Dresden when the bombing happened. The narrator of the story (who is not Billy himself) was also at Dresden. The attack is the centerpiece for illustrating how awful war is - a beautiful city transformed into a barren wasteland reminiscent of the surface of the moon. Much is also made of the condition of the soldiers on both sides, with many soldiers seemingly too young or too old for war and none able to remain healthy.<br /><br />Besides anti-war messages, some of the most interesting ideas are the result of Billy's time travel and abduction by the Tralfamadorians. The Tralfamadorians live in four dimensions and are able to see any moment in time all the time. According to them, you never really die, you just visit different moments of your life constantly (similar to Billy's time travel). As a result they don't believe in free will - whatever happens will happen and nobody can change it. One idea they propose that humans could learn from is that since life is full of good and bad moments, it is often best to focus on the good ones.
0071762345|2.0|Despite the back of the book being listed as 'Marketing', this book has very little to do with marketing at all.<br /><br />I only looked through it a few times, but I got the strong impression that it all depends upon already having a customer base, and simply making the best of the relationships you already have. That's not Marketing. That's Customer Service. Maybe through good customer service you might get word-of-mouth, though.<br /><br />I have been looking for a way to take advantage of social media and how to quickly gain a big fan base, and this doesn't really talk about that. It also seems to be aimed more at established companies. A lot of the case studies were big brand names, like Dominos Pizza, etc.<br /><br />I just don't think talking about word-of-mouth or social media is helpful at all when it doesn't discuss how to get off your feet. From 1 fan to 500.<br /><br />Social media is for sharing, not just for customer service, and so I was a bit disappointed when I didn't particularly see mention of YOU as the company creating your OWN content and having word-of-mouth on social media take over. Only 10 pages discussed how to create valuable content, and it was brief enough that I'd recommend a better book for details, [[ASIN:111802723X Launch: How to Quickly Propel Your Business Beyond the Competition]].<br /><br />Honestly with all the rave reviews here (so incredibly predominantly 5 star, and so many of them), I really feel like the author took advantage of social media to encourage people to leave raving reviews. And many of the reviews are SO brief that it was almost like the author has some form on his site asking people to leave a quick message about how they felt about the book. That seems a bit scammy. Perhaps not so genuine and honest, and just people coerced or maybe given some prize (or chance at a prize). For 258 reviews for a book published in mid-2011, and not be on the NY Times bestseller list, there's some manipulation there. The reviews are too peppy and excited.

B0034G4OYA|5.0|I bought this for my grandson because he has watched me play the game on facebook.  In the game you build a room that shows a preview of the movie.  Well he had to have it, and he loved it.  All ages would enjoy this movie.
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Definitely starts out as a slow read but it has a good plot. Didn't like the ending though only because it felt very rushed. The author didn't do a good job of explaining all the details and on the why of it all
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I loved the story from the start, good characters, nice setting,good history to the story. Found it too short, and as such was left with too many questions. Wish the author would have given us more in its first installment.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|2 out of 5 stars. Two pragmatic people have a little fun spending time together and fall into a situation that they both believe will be beneficial to them, only to wake up the next morning with one not remembering a thing that she agreed too...<br /><br />I soo wanted to enjoy this novel, especially since the plot seems so light and fun, but I just couldn't get into it at all. The characters, while funny and intensely sweet at times, were hard to like (mostly Megan) because of how they seemed to talk around each other while not really moving along. Therefore, I could only read up to 34% of this novel before I stopped reading it all together.<br /><br />I don't recommend this novel. However, if you do decide on reading it, I hope you'll get into it better then I did, then you should know it's for people who enjoy contemporary romances.<br /><br />- On a side note -<br />It has a cute cover! =0/ Plus, Megan & Connor's playful banter when they first meet was fun to read.<br /><br />Review By: From Me to You ...

B00ANIEOH4|3.0|I have been watching Criminal Minds since its first episode and have always loved it. The quality of the show has had its ups and down- the season in which Prentiss and JJ were dismissed was one of the worst. Many fans (including myself) didn't like the new agent, Seaver, who replaced the two veteran stars. But I think this season is truly worse even than Seaver's season (season 6, I think). Why? Because of the newest team member, Agent Blake. Her character is cold, dull, and has almost no sense of humor. I can't see her really bonding with the rest of the team, and in fact, she expressed a dislike for \\"sensitive\\" people. Does that mean she doesn't like Garcia or Morgan? They both get a bit sensitive and the cases sometimes get to them emotionally. Is she saying she'd rather work with robots?<br /><br />I truly hope that the show either makes some changes to Blake's character or kindly asks Tripplehorn (the actress playing Blake) to leave.<br /><br />And what's with the endings? Why are they always the same? What's going on with this season? Where's the creativity? And why is the unsub's identity revealed so early on? It's so much less fun that way!<br />I give this episode 3 stars.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Great app for keeping track of events. Syncs perfectly with Google Calendar. I use it daily to keep track of classes, football games, and what-have you.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I've read all of Colleen Hoover's books and they are all wonderful, can't put them down page turners. Must read!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great read!  I enjoys it on my Jamaican vacation.  I have recommended it to friends and family.  Good for mant audiences.
B0052RE4MQ|2.0|Can't decide whether I liked it or hated it. Definitely not one of my favorite books but I will finish the series now that I've started it. Don't understand the hype about the books, though. Ky is a pretty interesting character, but Cassie....she actually works on my nerves a bit.
B004SBS8LA|1.0|Purchasing this was a big mistake. In order to get parts of the game there are additional charges. Also, there is no clear explanation of the process of the game or what one should seek to complete it.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!
B004UNX1LS|2.0|New videos took way to long to load espicially on the newer videos<br /><br />I have an HD Kindle and viewing quality very poor<br /><br />I prefer to stick with youtube
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love the variety of pictures and the amount of pieces one can select. Having a choise to see only the outer pieces is another perk.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Awful... just awful...... and BORING.  The flick got  high marks on the TOMATO-METER which is why I gave it a shot. WHY/HOW? --- I'll never know!  Basically NOTHING happens in this movie.  Two cops go into a building..... bang bang boom...... and they walk out.  Not a memorable line or scene in the whole thing. It makes the original JUDGE DREDD  look like Shakespeare.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I have spent most of my spare time playing this game. I like that it progressively gets harder and harder to solve. And yet, when stumped, I can move on to another. Thus, lessening my frustration.
B0060MYM7O|1.0|Great show, but the set is missing the digital copy code.  So it gets a low score since I'm not getting everything I paid for...
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This is one of the best hidden objects/matching game.  There is an overriding storyline that makes it interesting, plus there are several ways to find the hidden objects-by outline, by name, by picture.  In addition, the graphics are great.  I have played a similar game by the same developer and enjoyed it.  I was glad to find this one.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Awesome music, awesome Lindsey! Best tracks: Elements, Crystallize, Song of the caged Bird, Transcendence & Shadows.<br />I think best discover of the 2012!<br />Check her videos on lindseystomp channel.<br />Waiting for next album!
B001N1DPDE|3.0|If you like your blades short and fat you'll love this thing.  First it's a quality product for sure.  It's basically like having a hatchet in your pocket.<br /><br />I know many people love how thick this blade is, but I'm not a fan of 1/4 thick knives.  I'd rather bring a small axe or hatchet and and companion knife that does knife tasks better.  To me .130 to .180 MAX (3/16) is perfect thickness, no thicker or cutting performance suffers.<br /><br />Yes this knife will probably be around with the cockroaches after China nukes us, but while I'm living I just can't find much use for it.
B005IFWXWU|5.0|I have known for years that Hugh Laurie was musically inclined thanks to his little bits on &#34;Jeeves and Wooster&#34; from his early acting days.  I had no clue that his talents extended into the realm of New Orleans style blues.  Definitely worth listening to if you enjoy blues or jazz music.  This is now one of the top CDs I listen to while driving around.<br /><br />One of the things I enjoy the most about it is that Laurie doesn't try to make the music more than it is.  He doesn't try to make himself sound any different than he normally does when singing.  It is a little odd to hear an Englishman singing the blues in this style, but I think that because Laurie just sings the music instead of trying to mold to it... well it just works.
B004GBFF5Y|5.0|never even heard of it, sounded fun and holy cow, great little movie!  Moonrise Kingdom meets One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  And a great coming of age story, both for those in the middle of it and those way, way beyond it.  Like me.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Not what I expected at all. I'm usually pretty good at figuring out at least SOME part of the conclusion, but Bravo Gillian Flynn, i was completely surprised by the ending. Just light enough to not be depressingly dark.
B00138J234|5.0|The Clash's &#34;London Calling&#34; is a classic.  If you love punk rock, this needs to be in your collection.<br />One of my favorite albums of all time.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Great book! A real page turner. Very well written. I look forward to more from this author. A fresh talent.
B008GXHOFW|1.0|I love the gameplay but when I got back on every point I had was gone and my story restarted
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|To say that I was walking into this film with bias eyes may be a correct assumption.  I’ll be honest here, for there is not another movie in the history of film that I have been more excited to see than ‘Les Miserables’.  That isn’t to say that I expected it to be the greatest movie I had ever seen, but in all my years of movie watching, I have never anticipated the release of a film with such rabid obsession as I have with ‘Les Miserables’.  It probably stems back to my childhood and the fact that by the age of twelve I had already seen the stage musical four times and was pretty much obsessed with it as a whole.  Living a hop, skip and a jump away from many of the finest theaters in New England, my family frequented the theater.  I still remember the first time I saw ‘Les Miserables’.  I was seven.  It changed me.<br /><br />Musicals are, in my opinion, one of the greatest genres film has to offer.  They deliver to us such depth of storytelling in a way that is unique to its own.  You don’t see people running through the streets communicating in song and yet when it is done with such passion in front of the lens it all makes sense and feels so complete.<br /><br />When the initial reviews for ‘Les Miserables’ started to flood in with largely negative notices, I was nervous.  How could this be a flop?  How could this material get butchered?  Not that it couldn’t, since we’ve all endured the mess that was 1998’s ‘Les Miserables’, but I still had faith that Hooper would do the source material proud.  In all honesty, most of the vicious attacks against the film felt so contrived and calculated that it was almost as if critics were anticipating a failure.  Nathanial Rogers over at The Film Experience noted this same thing.  Whether it be angst against Hooper for stealing Fincher’s Oscar (like it was his fault, but I get it sort of) or an aversion to the movie musical itself, it seemed since the start of the year that this particular film had a lot of naysayers before it was even finished being made.<br /><br />Well, Christmas rolled around and I got to see it for myself.<br /><br />I loved this movie!<br /><br />‘Les Miserables’ is not a film for everyone.  It’s funny to leave a theater and hear complaints from people behind me like “did they really have to sing everything” and I’m thinking to myself…IT’S A MUSICAL!  Seriously, if that is your complaint then why bother going to the movies.  I, for one, was thrilled when I heard that this was going to be completely sung throughout.  ‘Les Miserables’ has some of the most beautiful songs and composed music that it deserves a faithful adaptation.  Hooper’s triumph is about as close as you can come.  Of course, no film is perfect and I am not blind to certain imperfections, but overall I was extremely pleased with this film and consider it a marvelous representation of what a true movie musical should and could be.<br /><br />What Hooper and company get right here is the tone of ‘Les Miserables’.  This film is about the depths of despair but also the rising power of hope that come blossom from redemption.  Jean Valjean, a man swallowed up by his past mistakes (and the looming oppression of injustice) is attempting to right his wrongs and turn his life around.  Being spared a life of slavery by the kind gesture of a Bishop, Valjean breaks his parole in pursuit of a life without chains and makes himself over as a wealthy mayor and business man.  There are two people in his life that cause unexpected friction and set his life spiraling into a different direction.  First is Fantine, a young woman trying to provide for her illegitimate child.  The second is Javert, the ruthless general who is in feverish pursuit of Jean Valjean.  As the years pass by Valjean’s guard is constantly up as he fights to evade Javert’s clutches, all the while taking on a new responsibility that opens his heart and teaches him the importance of love;something that has be choked out of his soul thanks to the heartless realities of life.<br /><br />For the fan of the source, Hooper’s film is going to make you smile.  I wept.  My parents wept.  In fact, the majority of the theater wept, and this is only the third time in my life when the theater broke into applause during the credits.  ‘Les Miserables’ is an emotional wonderment and a film that will break you down.  The performances by the entire cast are wonderful, with Anne Hathaway delivering one of the finest supporting performance of the past several decades (her take on ‘I Dreamed a Dream’ may be one of the finest cinematic moments, ever) and Eddie Redmayne completely taking me by surprise with the amount of depth and heart he brought to what could have been an easily dismissive role (loverboy).<br /><br />The pacing is also pretty spectacular.  The film just glides from one number to the next.  It certainly doesn't feel like a nearly three hour movie.  We are constantly drawn into each scene, not one feeling unnecessary.  This is a feat in itself, considering that this is a film consisting entirely of song and score and a lot of the score is redundant (and yet it is so beautifully composed that one never tires of hearing it).<br /><br />Some have balked at the vocals of some of the cast, in particular Russell Crowe.  To them I say this; film and theater are two very different things.  When one goes to the theater, they expect to hear voices that cause their hair to stand on end.  You are watching actors who are trained to sing to the cheap seats so-to-speak.  It is part of the experience.  Film is a different animal.  If this film were spoken word, you would expect the actors to dig deep.  You’d expect to hear their voices crack and their breath give out; why would you expect any less from a song?  It is very obvious that Hooper was going for a more realistic approach, a more earthy and grounded take on the musical.  Instead of expecting vocal perfection from his cast, Hooper wanted to unearth their emotional response to the story.  I mean, Hathaway goes as far as to suck snot up her nose as she belts out her big number, and it works.  Crowe, while not capable of hitting the big notes, has a very pleasant tone to his voice and handles himself quite well here.<br /><br />Yes, there are faults.  Hooper’s obsession with closeups is a bit overwhelming.  The film is so beautiful, from the costumes to the set pieces, that it is such a shame that for the most part ‘Les Miserables’ basically shifts from one person’s face to another’s.  I understand it to a degree, since watching Hathaway crumble during ‘I Dreamed a Dream’ in one take with no cuts and no makeup and full on pain works wonderfully, but it does become somewhat claustrophobic after a while.  It’s baffling to me that Hooper wouldn’t want to expand his view a bit and let us take in the vastness of the cityscape, especially since he did so quite effectively in ‘The King’s Speech’.<br /><br />This, and ‘Bring Him Home’ is a terrible mess.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I loved this.  My parents even noted to me that it was better than the stage musical.  I don’t agree to that degree.  There are few things that can rival the power of this story told on the stage, but I feel that Tom Hooper and company captured it to the best of their ability.  I feel pretty confident that if the cinematography weren’t so monotonous (the dutch angles at least added some flamboyance to otherwise boring camera work) this film would be the clear frontrunner for the Oscar.something that has be choked out of his soul thanks to the heartless realities of life.<br /><br />For the fan of the source, Hooper’s film is going to make you smile.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am sure everyone has said all that is to say about this book, and the series!!  The authur keeps you griped to the very end.
B000MD9UJC|3.0|Shipping was quick. Parts installed with ease. On/Off button works well. LED light bulb is not really an upgrade over original. I would say save your money and pass on this conversion
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this app is awesome I mean awsome I mean veryy awssoommmeeeeeeeee all the father apps are boring but thisnone is awsommee!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Awesome for a free game!!!! Really good graphics and storyline. Also would recommend this for adults as well as kids. Love it and can not put it down.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing. It surpassed all of my expectations. I love the characters and missed them after I finished reading it. This book evokes so much emotion, you feel like you are in the story.
B004QX07G4|2.0|Love Ellen Degeneres, her show is great and she is just a wonderful comedian and person when seen live.  However, the humor does not translate as well into writing.  If she were delivering these lines, I would be laughing out loud.  It just didn't work for me but might for someone else.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is the first sci-fi book to really surprise me in a while. It is stuffed full of 80's references, and I don't even like the 80's, but I thoroughly enjoyed this book.<br /><br />It just has great scenes- because it is set largely in a VR world, it can be very fluid, a bit like Stephenson's &#34;City of Golden Light&#34; series. This is quicker (a lot quicker!) than that series, while still being fresh, chapter to chapter.<br />Very nice.
B00881VLCE|5.0|What you would expect from a puzzle.  Neat pictures of cats, too.  Also there are pretty girls.  And other pictures.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Love Danzel....what more can one say....well acted...believable and the power of forgiving oneself and doing what is right....I highly recommend it!
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|My son absolutely loves this series of books.  He sat and read the entire book in one sitting. I would recommend this book for any young boys 2nd to 5th grade!
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Could NOT get into this movie....sorry I rented it...didn't watch the whole thing...do not recommend it....confusing...and odd...rented it for the actors but was disappointed
0307887898|4.0|this book was recommended in teh course on entreprise gwoth, so I bought it. It is nicly wrtitten, quote intersting reading, not an academic reading, but more fo rpractitioners. My peers liked examples in it
B009RH9J7W|5.0|I love the way this case works with my new Kindle! It works great to stand horizontally or vertically :D<br /><br />Only critique I could give this case is that the auto on/off doesn't work unless it's turned the &#34;right&#34; way. There are 2 ways to have the Kindle horizontally. If the power plug is facing outward, then the auto on/off doesn't work. It only works when the plugs are hidden which inhibits me from being able to plug it up and use the auto on/off function.
B00008DDSA|5.0|Such a great movie, kind of on the perverted side but still if you read between the lines it has a great story to it.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Sweet story of trying to find someone, anyone to just share your life with.  And the surprises you  get along the way.
B005JZBPHS|5.0|I chose 5 stars because this series helps lesbians relate to real life problems,<br />and find solutions.  I feel like the characters depict real relationships<br />In society. I particularly enjoy watching each character &#34;come out&#34;<br />or help others to do so. It helps people who are gay to know that is okay.<br />I just wish we had a place like The Planet, where we could meet other<br />lesbians and share our trials and tribulations together.<br />I learned that finding your true self can be done best through exploration.<br />I relate to each character in some way, which I'm sure we all do.<br />I've learned that being in a monogamous lesbian relationship, relationship can<br />be very difficult at times but so can being in a straight one.  If you follow<br />your heart, be true to yourself, everything else will fall into place.<br />I'm very sad that The L Word is no longer on, and there will never be<br />a replacement.  Thanks for reading.
1401235417|5.0|This is one of the best Batman stories I have ever read. I personally think the new 52 is fantastic and Court of Owls will be a classic for a long time. I can't wait to continue reading and find out what will happen next. This is a book for all fans of Batman, new and old. If you are one of the vocal minority who has a bad taste in your mouth from the new 52 launch you should probably get over yourself and check this out. The only reason I can think of that someone would hate this new Batman launch is because they were looking for reasons to hate simply because they want to hate on anything in the DCnU. Embrace the new changes like I have because I can't wait to see where this story goes. The book was exciting for me to read from start to finish and I can't wait for some of the newer characters to progress as well as see familiar faces grow into the new 52. 10/10 would recommend. Go and buy this now.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I rate this game a 5 its truly an addictive game to play! I  also have this app downloaded on my iphone. You have the option of playing alone or with others. Totally Fantastic!!!!! one of the greatest card games out there!
B0053KWDES|5.0|Works great with Iphone 4 and Ipad HD.  I use it for my music and watching movies.  Quite the long battery life and charge via USB.  I use it with AT-M50, Sen HD555, and Sony V6 (circa 1991).
B006LSZECO|2.0|Maybe I read too many novels written by amazing writers, but I had to drag myself through this book. The writing is terrible. Not only was there never once a sentence that made me stop and say, &#34;Wow, that was beautifully put!&#34;, but the writing is so bad it was distracting. It was difficult to keep my mind focused on the plot and stay interested, because every sentence was awkward. Flynns writing is choppy and completely devoid of creativity. Practically every sentence could have been changed to flow better. For example, Flynn describes several things from different characters' viewpoints using the same metaphors. That doesn't even make sense!!! Come up with new metaphors! Her writing throughout the book was repetetive. This is the first book I have read by Gillian Flynn, but now I am going to try to read her first two books just to see why they got so much hype. But if they are this painful to read, I might not make it through them. Have our standards slipped so much in this country, that we don't care about good writing any more? This book's writing is on par with the worst trashy novel you can think of. So what if the plot is mildly fascinating?! Maybe Flynn needs to go back to writing for Entertainment Weekly.
0679412697|5.0|I love Everyman's Library Classics books.  The quality is always dependable and makes for a nice collection of classic books.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I have used all the Anker products that i purchased from Amazon and all are fantactics. I will continue to support this product and recommend to my relative and friend to get this product when they need one. Fast delivery, actual product as shown and good product for everybody.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Thank you Weber!  It's the perfect size and price for a small grill and it works great!  I'm a proud poppa.
B008DL466C|1.0|This Album is a far cry from the Wiz I know. The entire is about money and all you here is the repetitive nursery like songs. Even if it is $5.00 trust me buy something else.
0141192429|5.0|This has become my favorite book of all time. I've never been a  big mystery buff but Wilkie Collins was an excellent writer. This story was fast paced and witty and kept you in suspense. I was very pleased.
B009CF7JDU|3.0|I have seen this movie on several occasions and it never gets old. It is a feel good movie.  Ferris Beuller's philosophy &#34;Yes I Can!&#34;
B00BHASXN8|5.0|i love game of thrones: books and tv series.  its hilarious and emotional.  the characters are well developed so you end up really really loving them.
0061565407|5.0|When I am looking for the perfect book that makes me feel good in the car, I still listen to this one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good book! Wanted to make sure to read before I saw the movie! Excited to see the movie, hopefully sometime soon!
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Was returned.  I also discovered a &#34;review&#34; online, where the guy plug this mic in while recording into his iPad.  The iPad built in microphone was far superior.  In this case, you get what you pay for.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Great read for any one who loves video games and nostalgia, loved all the random tidbits of geekdom. Would definitely recommend to any one who has a nerd side.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Hope that George Martin manages to finish the series, because this book leaves everything unresolved. Just as the other books did.
B005PK553C|5.0|This series is of better quality than the majority of the horror movies out today. Great writing and superior acting. Hope the show stays on for many more seasons!
B007XNAQLA|5.0|These cats are incredible!! Incredible performances! The DVD included is phenomenal! The artists are interviewed and is like being in the interview with them. If you are a Return to Forever fan, you MUST own this work. You will not regret it!
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Less buggy than the last g5 game I played.  Nice graphics.  Some objects would be impossible to find without the hints.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This is one of THE best books re: what it really means to be a creative. Insightful, funny, wise. I am definitely now a fan of Austin Kleon! It is a very short read, but is packed with good stuff that I'll read over and over.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|The amount of action scenes is amazing. The plot is very interesting, and also seeing James Bond making fun comments, ads up to the movie.<br />Javier Barden is superb. His role is really well developed and he is an ideal opponent for 007.<br /><br />Excellent movie.<br /><br />Rent it!  It's worth every penny.
B004PGNB1K|5.0|It is a really good book, one of the best I have read in a long time. Very highly recommended.
B003M70O5O|4.0|First season was amazing. very engaging.<br />This second seasson is not so much. There are a lot of inconsistencies with the characters... specially with the length of their hair... it goes from long, to Supper long and back (Opi and Jaxx).<br /><br />The story is ok... but season 1 was better.
1451695195|4.0|Purchased after the reviews.  Liked the book and shared it with a friend.  Now on the circuit to different people, so must be a good read to more than me.

B00AB0AR2U|3.0|Resident Evil retribution is basically the same movie as all the other films in the series. that's not to say a bad thing although the formula starting to spread thin. That's apk that needs to be said.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Love this story, truly inspiring and get to know the animals and the courage of an Indian boy fighting to survive of the predicament, by the time when I finished this book, grandpa just passed away, grandpa he is amazing back in the day he would ride his bicycle to everywhere sold his ice cream when everybody else driving an ice cream car and motorcycle, grandpa he doesn't have many friends but his hardwork and big heart reminded me everyday what kind of man I wanted to be.<br /><br />Grandpa, I Love you, rest in peace!
B007U8U1V8|5.0|What an inventive, creative, and powerful musician.  If it were not for Channel Orange, this would be far and away the best album of 2012.  I love the feel of it and the way the sound grows around you.  Be immersed.  You will love it.
B009CGYO0K|5.0|Funny, smart jokes and really nice pictures. Totally worth it if you know anything about cats! I recommend it! Great!
B007PBKG5G|4.0|I can't wait to see what happens as they grow as musicians and song writers  They will be around a long time making great music.

B004SBS8LA|4.0|Having heard about Angry Birds, but never having tried it, I was curious.  I really enjoy it.  It is fun!  I don't think it will increase my gray matter, but I do enjoy the graphics and the sounds the birds make.
B005K17RU0|4.0|After you look up the city zipcode it is fast and easier than on the TV look up on Dish
0345803485|5.0|Strictly mommy porn,but could not put it down until the very end. The writing is not that great, more like high class soft porn reading material but entertaining in a brainless kind of way. Will definitely get you in the mood.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow! That was an unbelievable and unexpected book. I guarantee you will not be disappointed with this book!!  Can't wait to read the next book.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Awesome, just like the title,very passionate. His voice is the most beautiful gift from God. Guaranteed to strike a flame and put anyone in the mood for a little romance.
B008FWHUQM|2.0|I did not understand much about this movie, it certainly is not what I thought I was going to be looking at.
B006O6F4O6|4.0|Cumplió mis expectativas, muy buena calidad a mis hijos les fascinaron espero seguir comprando con este vendedor muchas gracias c.....
B004LWZVZC|5.0|This movie is very good for learning aspects of Civil War history, and dramatizes how politics can have adverse influence on judicial proceedings.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Very addictive. Really love this game. Its just got a cool vibe of entertainment. I've lost a lot of sleep playing this one.
1451695187|5.0|I originally borrowed this book from my library. I loved it so much I have to own it! I intend to read this book at least once a year. (how many books can I say that about? NONE)  It really helped me put things into perspective about what's important in life and also gives a sense of peace about what lies after this life. Fantastic book! I would recommend this book to anyone!
0470901071|5.0|I read Wendell Odom's CCNA books, and DANG they were horrible.  I wouldn't wish anyone to waste their money on junk like his stuff, with errors galore (someone needs to edit his stuff next time...or someone with a brain at least).  Todd's Microsoft books in the past were excellent reads, and this book is the same...good, clear, but it does have some errors, so read the errata first.  Even so, it seems to have less errors, is better worded, and clearer in presentation (depth, practice material, etc), than anything Wendell included in the Cisco Press junk.
B0043EV774|5.0|We thought the movie was wonderful and the 3D effects were beautiful. The movie was super for kids also and they enjoyed it almost as much as we did

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I read this book for a book club and have since recommended it to many friends. It is a well told story, chilling in it's implications and a story that I think anyone would find intriguing.  I especially think that parents of any age child might relate to it. The quirky things that your child may do....are they within the normal range of behavior...are they just going through a stage that they'll soon outgrow.....aren't all kids like that?<br />The problems in Defending Jacob  are every parents inner thoughts about their child. They seem particularly pertinent in this day and age.<br />The author keeps you in suspense time and time again and you'll have a hard time putting the book down.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|LOVED IT.  LOVE THE CHARACTERS, THE SERIES & LOCATION.  GREAT SERIES HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO EVERY ONE YOUNG & OLD

B002N1RM5A|5.0|Jonas Kaufmann does an excellent job singing these lieder:  his voice is both vigorous and tender, whatever each song requires.  I highly recommend this CD for the art song singer, and for second-year, or higher, German students.
B009NPA3Y6|4.0|This CD is a must have, but in my humble opinion, some really great songs were missed, as 'Rain Fall Down', 'Streets of Love', 'You Can't Always Get What You Want', etc.

B0042X9L6A|5.0|This was my first external flash for a DSLR.  Had an EOS Digital Rebel for 10 years and don't know how I got by without an external flash. I can't believe how big of a difference it makes on indoor pictures.  The power and ability to bounce the flash off the ceiling/wall is a huge advantage over built-in flashes.  I mounted it to my new Nikon D7000 and it works perfectly.  I highly recommend this for anyone with a DSLR if they don't have one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I waited almost six months to buy this book and I found I can't put it down. Ican't wait to finish it , there are so many twists and turns that you never see coming.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|I love this series.  It's like a highly entertaining history lesson.  Every time i watch an episode, it inspires me to read more about the characters.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|A thriller based on fact which mostly holds one in suspense throughout. A little included comedy was clever, and appreciated.
B005HED08I|4.0|Really a great show, ahead of its time. I enjoyed it and the social statements it was making. Amazing and enjoyable.
B007REV4T8|3.0|Some great stunts start this movie off well, but then it tends to fall apart as it progresses. Albert Finney's part near the end, was weak and not well acted. Quantum was a better watch.
B000OVLIQU|4.0|I'm giving this 4 stars because I like reading stuff about the Beatles from someone's point of view who was there at the time.  Also because it was easy to read and kept my interest.<br /><br />However, there were some negative things.  There was a lot of emphasis on the negative qualities (from Emerick's perception) of the people he didn't get along with.  Emerick seemed to think that Paul was the most wonderful person on the face of the earth, John was a moody SOB, George was not very nice and not a very good guitar player (almost inept) until the final days of the Beatles, Ringo was not very nice either and had virtually no personality, and George Martin was interested in protecting/saving his own hide.  It's possible Emerick really thinks these things.  I just think it's interesting that a lot of people have said that Paul was very sneaky (I'd go so far as to say back stabbing), and George and Ringo were nice and interesting people.  John's another story but we'll leave that at that!  I don't know much about George Martin but I've never heard about the selfish side that Emerick speaks of.<br /><br />A couple of observations and this is all speculation on my part.  First, he said Ringo would be kind of standoffish and just when he seemed ready to really talk or confide in Emerick, he'd back off in a very abrupt manner.  Well maybe that's because just when he was going to actually talk with Emerick he'd remember that he was talking with Paul's good buddy.  I could imagine how that could stop Ringo in his tracks for a number of reasons.<br /><br />Second, Emerick says that he didn't click with Klaus Voormann when they were going to work on a project together.  Emerick says he begged off the project because of this.  Well, Voormann thought the world of George Harrison so who knows what was really going on during the initial stages of that project!  Geoff, maybe Klaus didn't like you because of the way you treated George!  Funny how Voormann and so many others thought so highly of George but Emerick did not see George that way at all.<br /><br />So anyway, if you like reading about the Beatles from the perspective of someone who spent time with them, and you can make allowances for the negativity towards some of the participants, you may like this book.
B000S88JTS|5.0|At seventy three and a lifelong motorcyclist, this movie has always been of interest. I remember first seeing it in 1971, and came away feeling thoroughly entertained. Whats so good about this, is that those outside the biker community wlll enjoy it too. A feel good experiance.

B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A great first novel from Christina McKenna.  Her characters are lovely people to know, especially garrulous Rose who gives the book its title.  The historical facts of the slave orphans in Ireland during the last century are horrifying to contemplate, and McKenna has shed light on the abuses unflinchingly.  The reader suffers with Jamie and his young friends, only finding relief from the knowledge that he survives into manhood - but at what cost? The book keeps us in suspense until the end and along the way introduces unforgettable characters from the small Irish towns that McKenna knows well.  She has a good ear for their language and sensibilities.  These characters give the book its rich contrasts of cruelty, suffering, yearning and - gratefully - its laugh-outloud humor.  Jamie, Lydia, Paddy and Rose will make the reader smile long after the book is finished.  I look forward to more from McKenna.
B005I6EU48|5.0|The design of the case looks like an old classic novel which is a perfect disguise to the books I read ;)

1848321600|4.0|Robert Gardiner has written several excellent books on the sailing frigates of the Royal Navy.  This one is in effect, an annotated catalogue of the frigate models in the National Maritime museum.  It explains through the beautiful photographs, the evolution of this ship type. It is an important contribution to the literature on this topic, mainly because it illustrates many models that have not been examined closely and which the NMM has not chosen to place on public display.  I see it as a useful ship modeling resource, a source of ideas on potential new models, and a well illustrated text.  I highly recommend it and look forward to other books in this series. The author has indicated that he plans to produce several more books of this type, each focusing on a different type of sailing warship.  I recommend it strongly.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Amazing! I love this whole series. you can picture everything just as the show has done on HBO series. I am Hooked!
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|The original MEN IN BLACK was memorable because it was a quirky sci-fi movie that had just the right balance of comedy and action. MEN IN BLACK 2 followed in that same vein, but the film wasn't as strong and felt more like a retread. MEN IN BLACK 2 was released in 2002 and a decade later (due to script issues, scheduling conflicts, and budget problems), the boys are back in MEN IN BLACK 3 and while the film isn't as funny as the original, it's a far superior film to MEN IN BLACK 2.<br /><br />The film begins on the lunar prison base, a maximum security facility that was specifically designed to hold Boris the Animal (Jermaine Clement who seems to be channeling Tim Curry), the last member of a species of creatures that's sole purpose was destroying and devouring other civilizations. Boris has been in prison for forty years and what he really wants is to travel back through time and kill the man responsible for his imprisonment and the loss of his arm: Agent K. Through some stealth planning, Boris escapes.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Agent J (Will Smith) and Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) still work for the top-secret organization that protects the Earth from intergalactic threats. Events during the past few days convince K that Boris is out to kill him. While that's true, K is mistaken on just when Boris plans to commit his crime. After fighting Boris, K & J have an argument of sorts. The next morning, J awakens and discovers that all signs of K have been erased. He soon learns that K was killed forty years earlier. J has to travel back through time to 1969 and prevent the younger K (Josh Brolin) from being killed.<br /><br />There will be some who will be disappointed by MEN IN BLACK 3 because though there are plenty of jokes and lots of humor, the film isn't as funny as the original film. However, what makes the movie a better film that MEN IN BLACK 2 is the characterization and a script full of pathos, not to mention plenty of action.<br /><br />MEN IN BLACK 3 focuses on the relationship between K & J. The chemistry between the characters is the main reason that MEN IN BLACK was so successful; the pairing of Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones was a great casting move. That chemistry remains and is just as strong between Smith and Josh Brolin. However, MEN IN BLACK 3 examines why that chemistry works. Though it sacrifices some of the comedy, I enjoyed the overall emotional tone of the movie. The MEN IN BLACK movies have always been fun, but MEN IN BLACK 3 provides the series with a heart and stable emotional core.<br /><br />Besides Smith and Jones who are excellent as usual, Josh Brolin should be commended for his fine work as a younger Agent K. Brolin is a great actor. I've been impressed with him time and time again since first seeing him in THE GOONIES. His resemblance to Tommy Lee Jones is uncanny. Also notable in the movie is the portrayal of Michael Stuhlbarg as the last of another alien species who is capable of existing in multiple dimensions of space and time at the same time.<br /><br />MEN IN BLACK 3 isn't as funny or action-packed as MEN IN BLACK, but it is a far superior movie than MEN IN BLACK 2.

B00ADR2DTG|5.0|I bought this to go with my portable rig. It consists of a Netbook, a Behringer UCA222 (DAC) and a pair of Grado SR60! headphones. Although this needs AC from the wall to work, it's still small enough to be easily portable. It sounds very good out of the box. I substantially improved the sound by substituting a higher quality tube. Highly recommended.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|I loved season 5 and thought it was the best season ever.<br /><br />I'm not happy with either Don or Betty's current marriages and hope that Megan, at least, doesn't have as much air time in season 6.  But I fell in love with Sally and her boyfriend.  (Apologies for forgetting names.)  And the scene of Don letting the boyfriend drive home in Don's Cadillac was priceless.<br /><br />It's nice to know ahead of time that we have two more seasons to look forward too before it's all over.  Or to even dream of continued success with the possibility of more after season 7.<br /><br />So looking forward to season 6 on April 7!
B008YW5RH2|5.0|The Ap functions great and gives you time to improve before you have to pay for any new features. I got hooked on the game and then did upgrade my racket and compeitition because I wanted more.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|I liked this book. The way it was written with present and past scenarios gave you a glimpse into the future without giving anything away. It was paced well and it was engrossing right up to the end.
0553386794|5.0|what an amazing book!
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I thought this would be another teen lit book where the girl oh-so-dramatically gives up what she wants for the boy she loves, but it so wasn't. Great twists in the story, and good characters made it not as trite as some of the books referenced before. Definitely worth a read.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I like to consider myself pretty well read & intelligent, however I found myself constantly having to use the dictionary feature on my Kindle Fire...so much so that for a couple of weeks after finishing A Discovery of Witches, I would find myself wanting to press down on words I would come across & were unsure of their exact meaning in paperback books. Other than that, I enjoyed the book enough to start the next one in the trilogy. Still haven't made my mind up as to how I really feel about the story...I have to wait until I finish the entire series to truly decide. Keep ya posted. :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl had me going from the start.  It was a fast-moving drama that kept you guessing from one page to the next..Was Nick<br />a killer...was Amy dead, and who would want to kill her?  Why is Nick so calm?  Was he just as quirky as Amy?<br />I expected a different ending, though.  I kept going back to see if I had missed something.  I would recommend this book<br />to those who enjoy a good mystery that keeps you glued to the story and wondering &#34;who dunnit?
0307155102|5.0|Richard Scarry books are the only coffee table books we put on the coffee table.  Anyone who spends more than a few minutes near that coffee table picks them up and lingers over them.  We have a picture of our daughter sitting on the potty chair reading this book. Now that she is pushing 30, she still loves to look through them.  I asked her if she wanted one for her own house, and she said no, it was just one of the (many) things that made coming to see us something to look forward to.<br /><br />What I liked about this book the most was that I saw how simple, really, the drawings of the objects were.  It gave me the confidence to try making simple drawings to entertain her.  I was one who said, I can't draw stick people. What I learned was that little kids everywhere will sit down and be quiet if you allow them to call out things they want you to draw and then deliver!  Many a crazy laundromat on vacation has benefited from this ability.

0345529057|5.0|I was so excited to get these books because I had started the HBO TV series and it was amazing so I immediately wanted the books. When I saw the first four in a box set for only $20, I couldn't resist: I ordered them right away, and I do not regret it for one second. The books are extremely small, i almost didn't believe it was them when I saw the tiny box sitting on my front porch, but that's what I love about them. The print is small, I suppose, but I don't find that an obstacle when I'm reading them. I also read on some other reviews that some people got their books and found that sections of pages from certain books were completely missing or just misplaced within the book. I flipped through each of my set, and none of the pages seemed out of place to me. They are in perfect condition and sold for a steal of a price. I am so happy that I made this purchase, and I can't wait to be sucked into the world of A Game of Thrones!!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Take the time out to see the movie &#34;Looking For Sugarman&#34; . . . and then you will understand why I gave his album five stars.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|I love Denzel Washington, whom I consider one of our best American actors. That's the only reason I chose to rent this movie. But even a great actor cannot make this script interesting. The best part of the movie is in the opening 30 minutes (or less). After that it's a snooze fest. I hope that Denzel gets a better script soon.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I really like this because it is kinda addictive and I really like how I can build things that's all...
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Not one of the best Bond movies. I gave 4 stars only because of Daniel Craig who is the best Bond since Connery. If the departed have any cognition processes,  then Ian Fleming must be tossing and turning. Trying to update Fleming's work to modern times just makes for for dissappointing story line.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Captivating look into the culture and social interactions of early 20th century Britain. Really enjoyed how the show pulls you in and you cant help but develop feelings toward the characters that shift with the story.

B0064X7FVE|1.0|When I clicked on the settings it kept locking up and shutting down.  So I really didn't get to use it.  I unstalled it and hoped someone would fix it so I can redownload it.  I love the Weather Channel.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|The Craig movies have always been their own animal but this most recent film completely demolishes what a Bond movie is. I know, I've seen all of them (even that unofficial Never Say Never Again!!). But that's not to say I'm a crazy, die hard fan. I think the Bond series has always been so-so with a few diamonds in the rough.<br /><br />There is, however, a basic formula: cool gadgets, cool cars, insane villains, bond girls. This movie ignores this formula, removing the fun parts.<br /><br />The pacing is slow and the plot is more convoluted than ever, but what really kills me is the lack of gadgets, cars and girls. There's still a crazy villain, and that's the one saving grace.<br /><br />Skyfall is under the impression that telling a good Bond story involves using gritty realism, which means no silly gadets, but Skyfall ironically ends up being one of the more unbelievable of the Bond films. In lieu of gadgets, the new \\"gritty\\" Bond opts for makeshift homemade devices in the vein of Home Alone paint cans and buckets of goop.<br /><br />The audience can suspend their disbelief that a pen could also be a bomb, a car could have oil slick hidden in the trunk, and a modern symbol of virility could still drink martinis in the year 2013.  James Bond is a character that has earned our suspension of disbelief, and it's frustrating to see the latest iteration take the magic away.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|I love this movie!  I'm an adult with an obsession in animation, and when a truly amazing movie such as 'Brave' comes out on video you've got to get it.  If you like movies such as this, I also suggest Disney's 'Tangled' and Dreamworks 'How to Train Your Dragon'.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is a great app for kids and some adults. It is fun because you can run and learn hand,I, cordination.

B00B2V66VS|3.0|its okey but after having it for a couple of days when I tried to play it it came up and then went back to the home screen over and over again. so I love the game but if it doesn't open what's the use of it anyways?
0739474189|1.0|Having never seen this book in person (only read it on kindle)I can not actually verify if it does exist in real life or if this book was created by two transients who happened to saunter into a public library and proceeded to make love atop a keyboard. I was disgusted by the entire theme of this novel. 873 pages of people complaining that they cant get out from under an invisible dome, and then in the end it turns out to be a group of alien kids. Sure, the part where the cops son stashes the bodies in the pantry and visits them at night over and over again was hilarious and probably the most realistic comparison to my own life that I have been able to find in any romantic comedy, but all and all I don't approve. I don't know why I trusted this Stephanie King person again after the trouble I got in reading her collection of children's short stories \\"IT\\" to my little boy before bed.

B0084670FU|4.0|Unfortunate decisions seem like irresponsibility as three stories portray people whose  rippling mistakes threaten people they love.The camera and its perspectives give the film a sense of universal truths. Besides, there is something 'haunting' about these people and their problems.

B00B0ZT9NI|3.0|This is one of those films that gets a lot of hype but ultimately fails to live up to it. Here are a few reasons why:<br /><br />- Very little character development in this story. Take the embassy employees, for example. Other than sitting around and looking scared and doubting whether Affleck could pull this thing off, the film does little to let me know anything about them. One scene had a guy voicing regrets about staying there too long and endangering his wife, while another had a guy with his camera turned around backwards in the marketplace. And yeah... that was about it.<br /><br />- Ben Affleck, while not the worst actor in the world, wore the same wooden expression throughout the movie, said or did very little of substance emotionally, and like the Embassy staff did almost nothing to make me care about him whatsoever. Other than waking up in his suit in the first scene of the film (suggesting he's a workaholic, or worse, an alcoholic), I saw little else that told us anything about his life other than the fact that he's working for the CIA and is separated from his wife and son.<br /><br />- Alan Arkin, a superb actor, had mediocre lines in the movie and was on camera barely ten minutes, if that. A real pity, that. He tried his best with what he was given, though, but I'm not sure it came off all that well.<br /><br />- The early scene of the intelligence briefing felt a little too much like The Hunt for Red October, except HFRO had better writing, not to mention better acting from Baldwin. When \\"This is the best bad idea we have\\" is your greatest line in a scene, you know something is wrong.<br /><br />- Bryan Cranston, easily the best actor sharing the screen, should have taken Affleck's role in this movie. He's so watchable, and an infinitely better performer than Affleck. Relegating him to such a small role with even smaller writing was truly painful to watch. He managed to act his way out of that corral, though, which is a testament to the man's skills when faced with mediocrity.<br /><br />- The historical clips, while setting a nice back-drop for the film, did not succeed in reproducing the incessant pain and suffering the country was going through at the time. I lived through the hostage crisis, felt it every night on t.v. and every day in my classroom, and experienced none of that in the film.<br /><br />- The so-called dramatic tension that had people \\"sitting on the edge of the seats\\" felt more like paint by numbers suspense. At no time did I feel uneasy or doubt a situation would resolve itself. And even though I didn't know the outcome of these specific individuals historically, I never second-guessed that plane would take off in the end.<br /><br />- If there was anything in this film that contributed to a feeling of mounting tension it was the recurring scene of the children putting together the shredded paper in the warehouse. That was a nice touch, even if it never really happened... so chalk one up for Hollywood, I guess.<br /><br />- Oh, and that bit about the housekeeper realizing that the Canadian ambassador's guests were more than they seemed... yeah, that wasn't bad, either.<br /><br />- And then there's the writing, if you could call it that. \\"Argo F*** Yourself\\"? As a catch phrase? Seriously? I'm just glad that one guy who shook Affleck's hand at the end of the movie did so without saying anything at all. Better to keep your character's mouth shut and be thought a fool than open it and remove all doubt.<br /><br />- The fact that many of the actors compensated for bad writing by overacting didn't help much, either.<br /><br />- And now, the good stuff. The direction and cinematography were perhaps the only redeemable qualities of this film... so too bad it wasn't nominated in those categories.  Some wonderful shots of Tehran that made me wish I could get over there and take a look around.<br /><br />So... to sum up: 3 stars at best.<br /><br />And is it better than Lincoln?<br /><br />Hardly.<br /><br />Django Unchained?<br /><br />Not by a long shot.<br /><br />But when you have a film that makes Hollywood producers the stars of the film, expect it to win something.ilm, expect it to win something.

B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Jewels Star is a fun way to sit and kill time on my Kindle Fire.  My only issue is that have to manually scroll down to the next level that I need to play instead of having that level show up at the top.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|really enjoyed the suspense and action. Excellent action and story line. good acting from all of the actors. nice directing
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I have to say that this temple run is very similar to the first one, but way more fun than the original.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This game is so much fun &amp; creative!  Loving the new colors &amp; having to go back &amp; replay levels to find them. Hope they keep adding things &amp; levels to keep the fun going!
B004N8CP8K|5.0|For a free app, I was pleasantly surprised how well it works.  Simple to use.  Allows me to connect to work and do half my job while laying in bed.  Awesome.
B008476HBM|1.0|I know it's a &#34;classic&#34;, but....yawn.n.n.n. - archaic language and perfectly useless characters. Little more than local gossip among the local teens!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|A poigant story, well told, solidly good read. Recommend to those who seek to escape though the power of prose.
B001GMQALY|4.0|The film holds you attention from start to finish and takes you on an enchanting journey.  Engaging, erotic, moving...I would recommend.
B004PQFI5C|5.0|Great Movie! I love watching this movie over and over again. This movie has great characters. I am happy with this movie.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Though many of the developments in this movie don't make a lot of sense, it still resonates with the great science fiction classics. It holds our attention with an unfamiliar world and the suspense of waiting to find out what it means for us. The technology is cool and the film does have a small amount of depth lent by the mythology reference and the psychological projections of the main characters. But I am getting tired of the HR Giger sets and the cavalier group dynamics that these Ridley Scott space movies always have. I was looking for Blade Runner and got another Alien.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Coming off the heels of Season one, just one word - - FABULOUS! The story line continues with its twists and turns and the end of each episode leaving you wanting more.
B00AIGQTEC|5.0|Prince can do no wrong!!!! It reminds me of the 1999 album. I'm looking forward to an entire cd!<br />I definitely recommend this song!
B003GJSUPY|5.0|I am a child of the 60's and 70's.  I have seen The J. Geils Band in concert many times and they always, always put on a great show with tons of energy.  I also over the years have purchased many cassette tapes and Cd's of their studio work, and while those are all great tunes there just isn't anything to compare with the raw, extended, and in your face Live tunes.  I am enjoying this copulation of songs a lot and if you like J. Geils, you will definitely love this.
B0091REZMW|3.0|don't like the energy refill...why limit playtime? graphics are ok and the different modes make it a little more challenging
B001NZ1IGG|5.0|These guys from Seattle,Wa. in the late 80's early 90's were a treasure of talent.  If you mixed Guns N Roses with a little Thin Lizzy and Rush thrown in that's what I think you would get, Mother Love Bone.  Great songs and talent.  They would still be going strong except for the fact their Lead singer died before their first release.  A lot of their member's went on to other groups such as Pearl Jam.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|NOT A SPOILER! Colleen Hoover is my favorite author.  Her stories are well written, extremely captivating, and emotionally exhausting!  I read Slammed and Point of Retreat AFTER Hopeless.  I'm sad Colleen has been missing in my carousel for so long!  This is an amazing story, and the Slam poetry is just the icing on the cake of this book.  It adds an element to the book that makes you feel like you are watching it live.  I will not spoil it for anyone.  This book and then Point of Retreat are just amazingly beautiful.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Thank you Amazon for having the cheapest rates for this series, watched the first two was so addicted and missed the replay of the first set of series three so had to purchase it so i can get caught up with the rest of the world!! happy walker hunting!
B008YU0AOE|5.0|this app is soooooooo cool I nearly fainted. this app is the most extreme app in the whole intire universe! !!!!!!!&iexcl;
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I downloaded this book to read for my second time. George R R Martin is an awesome storyteller. I really like the political intrigue in this series and the fact that no character is safe from danger.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|The show is eccellent and well put together. I like Mr. Carson and Lord and Lady Grantham very much. Their perfomances are exceptional.
086547897X|5.0|buen libro, recomendadisimo a mi novio le encant&oacute;, solo qye muy grande la caja y por eso el envio hasta Ecuado me cost&oacute; de mas
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I LOVED season 1, ghost stories are right up my alley.  Season 2 still had all the amazing acting with an unbeatable cast and superb directing. BUT, I don't like alien stuff or zombie stuff. I know the zombie thing wasn't a big part but, I just didn't find this season scary at all. I do like serial killer stuff and watched the whole season because it was entertaining and very well done. But story wise, not my thing. I can't wait until the next season though!!
B0000YEEGM|5.0|This is a good movie for anyone who does not understand autism.  It is shown in a compassionate way and will help people assist someone with this problem.
B001UGB1X8|3.0|It Probably reads better as a book then it plays as a movie . Although it held my interest I found it to be a bit slow . It reminds me of the Jessie Stone series of movies .
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Like always, it is a very exciting and entertainment movie, a lot of auction and more. Just the end could be better but the rest was perfect.
B009UZLRJE|5.0|great box set i would reccomend it to any fan i bought as a gift for my wife and she loves it
B007C4E1R0|5.0|The book is an excellent read, and it the final of the trilogy The quality of the book, and shipping was perfect.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This series is yet another feather in the cap of BBC shows. Sherlock is an utter success in their storytelling, acting, and production. There are fewer shows that are better done from top to bottom than Sherlock.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|There is so much I did not know. Very interesting in many ways. It makes my enjoyment of the movie even deeper.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I think this book is perfect for kids to read. Because I didn't really find a good book until I read the first book.
B00APJLX8E|4.0|I have been a big fan of Genndy Tartakovsky ever since days working shows like: Dexter's lab, Samari Jack, The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy and of course the Power Puff Girls... He's a man who creates movies / shows with a child imagination. You wont be disappointed and suggest to have  bucket of popcorn and tissue for tear drying. Go see it!
B001C1066E|4.0|Not as sturdy as we hoped but its darn cute! My wife loved hers - our pooch got a hold of it :(
0060005696|4.0|I would highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the complexity of human mind. Why in this day and age &#34;choice&#34; and &#34;choosing one thing over another&#34; has turned us into obsessive freaks. And why too much choice is not really good for you.<br /><br />The best part about the book is that Barry has a lot of insights and cites examples which are relevant to the modern family.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|You remind me of the Babe! What Babe? The Babe with the power! What power? The power of voodoo. Who do? You do! Do what? Remind me of the Babe!!!!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|It was a great read.  Not so many twists and turns that I couldn't keep it all straight.  Marino is always such a sad character, I do get a little tired of that in her stories. But would recommend it to all Cornwall readers.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Loved reading this on my Kindle Fire, anytime anywhere:)  Also Amazon Prime made getting up to date with all the seasons a good financial investment.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is a good explanation of the things that led up to WWI.  It humanizes the participants and give insight to the motives.
052118939X|5.0|This is the second boot that I have ordered.  My wife is using them to learn english.  So far, great progress, but she is smarter than the average woman, in fact she selected a great husband.
030758836X|5.0|I loved this book. Read it in two day's I couldn't wait to finish it and find out how it turned out. The ending was a real surprise. This was a fast paced dark thriller with great psychological themes throughout the book. Every other chapter was the husband or wife speaking. The twists and turns in the story were awesome. This couple would take the top prize for dysfuntional couples. It was interesting to have a female sociapath for a change. I thought this was a different story line than I have read in the past, I highly recommend it for its orginality.[[ASIN:0307588378 Gone Girl]]
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I have had Android phones for over three years. In that time I've tried all the major keyboards in the Market, and I have bought more than a few.  I have always been entranced by the Swype-like tracing keyboards. But I always kept coming back to SwiftKey.  It's prediction engine is unmatched.  The speed it adds to my typing cannot be overstated.  I've been using the beta version of the new Flow keyboard for a couple weeks.  SwiftKey made an already stellar keyboard even better.<br />There is not another keyboard that compares.  This truly is the only keyboards you'll ever need.  Well worth the price.
B000SEIDR0|5.0|I continue to think about what I have read in this book.  That is always a good sign that the material was good!
8866137626|3.0|This is just a moleskine, with a special embossed evernote cover, and a bunch of stickers that I'll likely never use.<br /><br />I was expecting features to make it more functionally \\"intelligent\\" -- maybe like a livescribe notebook, with page numbering or special fields to add tags, or something along those lines.  But no, at its core this is just a plain moleskine.<br /><br />The price isn't awful, and moleskine notebooks are in and of themselves quite nice, so it isn't a total bust of a purchase.  But it certainly didn't live up to its pre-launch hype.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My 8 and 13 year old boys cannot get enough of this game! They have completely different ideas on how to build their houses and it allows their creativity to shine!
B009G78EE2|5.0|Incredibly deep, between his personal issues, his views on society and discrimination, he brings light to topics rarely to never touched before by hip-hop/rap artists
1432794426|5.0|This book is a great read whether an MJ fan or not. It gives an insight into the incredible life of The King of Pop. It is honest in its writings without any media illusion &amp; hype. It gives an insight into the tribulations that Michael Jackson faced in his life. His life was tainted with deceit , greed and extortion by those around him. Which unfortunately continues in his passing. It shows a real account through research of his honesty, purity and compassion the man that he truly was.<br /><br />&quot;Lies run sprints, but the truth runs marathons&quot;  Michael Jackson
B005BRS8Z6|3.0|For the first time in a long time I moved and inspired by this book. In my opinion this book was written in the spirit of\\" the alchemists\\" and \\"celestine prophecy\\". Very enjoyable and awe in<br />spire ring.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|more contemporary historical setting and societal issues with many personalities highlighting social issues with interwedded drama and some titillation to keep you engaged.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|AHS is one of the few shows that was truly entertaining recently. A little on the gory/twisted side, but very good writing and characters.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|the book moves very rapidly providing thought provoking ideas on the dilemma of principle versus pragmatics in geopolitics of the early 20th century
B00BESLHEA|3.0|entertaining mindless fun with a B movie retro flair<br />a Quentin Tarantino influence is apparent - Lucy Liu shines as the clever madam, with Russell Crowe looking like he is having a good time making a movie more on the silly side
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey transports you to the land of lords and ladies at a time when women were coming into their own, men were finding out that the world is quickly changing, not all for the better and life as it has been for generations is being turned upside down. The classes are mixing, the lines are blurring and you are caught in the wake of it all. It's a wild ride into the lives of one of the grand old houses, American influences and changing times.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Since there is so little decent programming on TV these days, I really look forward to watching an episode of Lark Rise every night.  I wasn't sure if I would like it from watching the first episode; but it continued to get more interesting, and the characters are so colorful.  I have the cable that connects my Kindle to the TV, so I can watch it right on my TV.  Great Entertainment!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|This book gave a detailed look at Lincoln's political life.  We are taught to admire Lincoln in school, but this book explains why he was truly remarkable.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of my favorite books, uplifting and inspiring. The characters issues really hit home and as a reader I felt connected to them.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|amazing game it just sucks you in. and when im are stuck on a puzzle and just keep trying and I get it. I try not to use the hint

B0094K1WZE|4.0|Love the Mission Impposible franchise,Tom Cruise is fantastic in this role. Hopefully he will continue churning them out yearly till he,s  98
B00632HWOG|3.0|Seeing as I only have Yahoo mail I cannot compare it with any other.  Part of the time Yahoo or Yahoo Mail &#34;Cannot find the URL.&#34;  By using Google I can get it to come up therefore I conclude it is a Yahoo problem.  I liked the old layout better.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|good series but would have liked better if the  ending was better done  just seemed to be very anticlimatic but it
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good times. classic Sim city kinda feel to it. addictive and fun to play. very detailed in the way your city works makes the game that much better
