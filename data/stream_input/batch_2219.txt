0812993292|5.0|Very entertaining and introspective story about a man and his journey to prove something to himself.  I loved this book
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I enjoyed this book, not because it was in depth or overly thought provoking, but because it was easy to get wrapped up in the story.  Sylvia Day does a great job with the characters and drawing her readers in emotionally.  You often just want to reach into the story and give them a hug or shake them for being irrational.  The ending was a bit far fetched, but that's what I liked.  Sometimes it is nice to read a story that you don't have to think about and can let yourself get carried away!
0345529057|5.0|If you're a fan of the HBO series, Game of Thrones, then you really must do yourself a favor and READ his books!<br /><br />My main complaint about George R R Martin is that he takes a lot of time between books.  At this rate, we may never know how they end, but on the other hand, visiting and learning about this wonderfully imagined world is worth it, even if it is never finished.<br /><br />This world is fully imagined.  It exists very clearly in the brilliant mind of George R R Martin.<br />The characters are real and well developed ~ their circumstances/dilemmas/choices/consequences are plausible.  Because they are so clearly understood by Mr Martin, it is easy for us, as readers, to forget they are only figments of somebody else's imagination.<br /><br />The cons ~ The books are very long and honestly could be edited.  Do they \\"need\\" to be edited?  Well ~ that depends on perspective ~ They definitely could be edited without losing much in my opinion, but for those who crave the extra details or have a different favorite character than I do, then perhaps not so much.  I personally didn't care for EVERY perspective or every character.  I found myself actively seeking chapters that were from my preferred characters and skipping others ~ only to return to those skipped chapters, after I'd read all my favorite characters.  Admittedly, not the most ideal way to read a book.  One of the things I am noticing as I/we anticipate book 6 ~ is that most everyone I know who is reading this series has a different favorite character.  This is what fascinates me the most about Mr Martins work.  That is how clearly imagined these characters are.  So, maybe it shouldn't be edited further.<br /><br />*SPOILER*<br />One of the things I like best about Mr Martin's work is that you really can't accurately guess which direction the story is heading, which is what makes his work so tantalizing.  Sure, I grieved when Ned died, but it set the story in motion.  I have always hated where the hero or heroine is left to die, by his or her nemesis in what should clearly be an impossible to escape situation, only to escape or be granted clemency at the last moment.  To be given a 2nd or 3rd chance to win.  Really?  What nemesis in real life is going to let you live to try to thwart them 2 or 3 or 4 times?  I hated when Rob died and even had my own tantrum over how the Red Wedding unfolded ~ I HATED the Red Wedding when I first endured it.  But now...  Now, I see it was as necessary as Ned's beheading.  Ehh ~ I still have my complaints about how the Red Wedding unfolded, and in this particular case, I would love more information than Mr Martin provided in the story, but I can better appreciate how this would has unfolded.<br /><br />It took 20 years to get books 1-5 ~ hopefully it won't take near as long to get the last two books in this series ~ supposedly there will be a total of 7 and I doubt that is even possible, but I don't dare try to second guess Mr Martin, because he could just kill everybody and be done with it.<br /><br />Plainly stated, worth the read!he hero or heroine is left to die, by his or her nemesis in what should clearly be an impossible to escape situation, only to escape or be granted clemency at the last moment.

B006HL9G10|1.0|So I downloaded tis before reading the permission list.  I enjoy meditation and thought tis would be cool.  I won't find out, because I won't be installing it.  The permissions are too invasive.
B005CRQ2Y4|5.0|Do exist!!!<br /><br />For anyone who needs help navigating them, this is a good place to start! Or end! I'm not sure which. But it's one of the two and it probably depends on your particular situation.<br /><br />And Mucho Maas? Hilarious description of mundane struggles! I spit my coffee out all over myself . . . (you may notice from my other reviews that spitting my drink all over myself is basically how I measure whether something is hilarious or not. No spill = only amusing at best!)<br /><br />Here's a hint of that brilliance: \\"Yet at least he had believed in the cars. Maybe to excess: how could he not, seeing people poorer than him come in, Negro, Mexican, cracker, a parade seven days a week, bringing the most godawful of trade-ins: motorized, metal extensions of themselves, or their families and what their whole lives must be like, out there so naked for anybody, a stranger like himself, to look at . . .\\"<br /><br />Unlike some other readers/critiques that I've read elsewhere, I don't get the sense from this book that life's meaning is lacking. Oedipa is not engaged in a futile game (whether put on by herself or her ex-lover Inverarity).<br /><br />Instead it's more like the Ultimate Shades of Grey: meaning lies in the neglected middle. So if you're too caught up in a set perspective / B&W thinking / or mental heuristics - then you'll never find it. Her search looks confusing because it is confusing. That's the thing about the neglected grey areas, sometimes what you're seeing has significance and is relevant to your search other times it probably is just random stuff.<br /><br />Kinda reminded me of an old alchemy drawing I saw once, where a bunch little people were standing on various high points of a maze looking for the way out of it. The text with that pic indicated that most of them will not make it out.<br /><br />A former resident of California myself, I've seen the hieroglyphic streets. They exist! This book and my own experience with them reminds me of the Egyptian practice of putting hieroglyphs in the tombs of the dead so they can navigate the afterlife successfully.<br /><br />Is that what Pynchon is doing for us? How about you read it and decide for yourself?<br /><br />It IS hard to read in parts, and I would call it a mind-bender or mind-blender, but definitely recommend! Just maybe not all in one sitting . . .
1595141715|4.0|Beware-- this book will tug at your heart and emotions. I'd think everyone could identify with the main character<br />and how she felt as she went through her mental and emotional demise. I must admit, at the end of the story--<br />I had troubles moving on with reading---it was wrenching. Excellent read.....if you can handle your feelings.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Bought this for my niece for Christmas, we all gathered around the TV Christmas day eve and enjoyed this movie.
B006HL9G10|2.0|I had high hopes for this simple app. Sadly, each sound can only be played by itself and only one instance at a time. When a new sound is about to activate, the previous audio track is abruptly stopped resulting in an audible &quot;pop&quot;. Not very meditative if your singing bowl stops ringing when another bowl is in the room.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I started reading this book and simply could not stop. The characters are enthralling and the story leaves you in a perfect place, yet still wanting more. This is the kind of book I could read over and over just to live in a world for a short time where these characters actually do exist.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I think it's a good game. The fallback is things you have to buy. However, it is still pretty fun with good graphics.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think this is a very gripping . This is my way to have, care a horse I have always wanted
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is a little to advanced for my 5 year old but we are having fun playing it together.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think it is a really good must read book for teens but you are planning to read this book you would read hunger games #1
1616550414|5.0|I bought this as a gift, and it was PERFECT!<br />I flipped through it a bit after it was opened and this book has pictures, information and stories. It's pretty cool, even for someone who didn't necessarily grow up playing the games.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Beside the best bond ever, Well, The best bond ever. I liked everything , Fast car, gorgous women,action, and of course, bond jane bond. Yes, I would recommend this to any oo7 fan.
B002IT5OU2|5.0|the book of the chirstmas carol was given to freind as a gift. and the lady it was given to love the book,she had never read it,but has read it twice.  GREAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00B6DTWM2|4.0|I waited a long for this movie to come out on dvd and I was not disapointed, I'm glad I bought it !
0316228532|4.0|A well written book with a very slow start. It took about a third of the book before I actually felt like I was enjoying it but since I picked this one up for a book club I slogged through it and by the middle, I was actively interested in the characters and their lives. There are a lot of characters and it becomes a muddle of names and relationships for the first hundred or so pages but eventually things start happening and it becomes easier to separate who is related to who and who is sleeping with that other guy.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is a character driven book with a solid plot but not a lot of wrap up at the end. Barry Fairbrother is apparently the only morally upstanding citizen in the city of Pagford and when he dies, everyone rushes to snatch up what he's left behind. It's hard to find a likeable character among the cast and everyone is either selfishly motivated or annoyingly deluded but Rowling's writing creates believable characters and though they're not sympathetic, reading about their lives is gripping, especially when tragic events occur.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|Excellent story of George Harrison and his music. I would recommend to any G.H. fan. Newbies would be quite interested in this as it gives his life story and also highlights his fantastic music. Wish we still had him around......
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Because it was almost like living someones true life story. It also had some good ways of viewing things in many different perspectives. And kinda liked the  sex eduacation too :). Very entertaining!! Loved all three books.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great acting, wonderful story lines. Fabulous locales. Top quality tv, which we are sorely lacking in America. Thank God for the BBC!
B009TTGM3C|4.0|It's an excellent movie, but the presentation could be better, especially if one of the principal actor is dead and we would like to preserve his name, or have special things.
1449410243|5.0|I love this book as it is very funny. I realize color pages and great construction cost money, however I would have enjoyed a slightly longer book. Good for a gift. I read this in about an hour. Still funny the second or third time around.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|YESSS! MORE PLEASE! I LOVE IT! GIVE ME MORE ZOMBIES THAN I CAN HANDLE! ANDREW, PLEASE LEAD YOUR PEOPLE TO THE HOLY GRAIL OF ZOMBIES AND KICK SOME MORE ZOMBIE ASS!
0446554995|5.0|LOVE this series and Pendergast is my favorite character. You won't be disappointed if you are a Pendergast fan. I am glad I have it in my personal library and am looking forward to the next book.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|good deal for the cost-my grandson loved it-everybody loves Dr Seuss-what more can I say about this movie -enough already
0765334798|4.0|While the novel is not perfect, I do think some people are being too hard on it. You do have to keep in mind that it is written in a certain way due to its subject matter and philosophical questions. Maybe I am wrong, but there is a prologue because that is how the tv shows it is poking fun at start their episodes. The characters exist only for their specific purposes for a specific reason. The reason they don't have well fleshed out backgrounds is better explained in the ending chapters and coda. So many of what people are pointing to as shortcomings are really intentional. At least, that is how I took it after I finished.<br /><br />That said, I DO agree that a few of the lesser character reactions to some events seemed a little hard to believe for me. A little too simplified. And I did have a touch of trouble keeping a couple of the main characters straight. But over all I LIKED the style, enjoyed the banter, and had a lot of fun with it. The final coda is very different, but takes the novel's setup and asks some great questions with it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever it is so fun for all ages i play it all of the time you should buy it
B00957T6X6|5.0|I love the different plot twists & the intriguing characters. I can't wait for the next book to read what develops.
B00BOL126U|5.0|If episodes 1 and 2 are a fair representation of the entire series, I'm looking forward to future episodes.  It seems to do a good job of blending the ambiguity of myth with what historians report to be probable facts.  I'm really excited about an adventure drama featuring women who can contribute on the battlefield in a realistic fashion.  Who knew that Vikings were feminists! Sort of.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I'm hooked on this game. I'm stuck on my current level but I will get through it. :o)  It's a good way to forget about your day.<br />Give it a try you'll see how addictive it can be.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is a game where you have to get resources and survive. But you can get this game on Xbox for 20 dollars and it will be better. And you can get this game on computer and it will be even better than Xbox for 30 dollars.
0486274268|5.0|I purchased this book and The Artist's Guide To Drawing Realistic Animals at the same time.  They are both excellent sources of information.  I know I have improved my paintings, having read them.  This one also gives advice on drawing domestic animals.

B008C1O8CA|5.0|I thought that \\"21st Century Breakdown\\" was just ok and I was kind of weary when I heard about the trio of albums that Green Day was putting out. I read many mixed reviews, some that praised it and others that said it sucked. So I decided to give it a shot being a fan of Green Day since the early 90's.<br /><br />This album is basically a pop-rock album; if you thought \\"Dookie\\" or \\"Warning\\" was user-friendly, let me tell you that this definitely surpasses those albums in terms of catchiness and glossed over production. Having said that, this is actually a really solid album. The songwriting and instrumentation is really good, Billy Joe's voice sounds great, and they don't try to re-create the sound of the past which is actually refreshing.<br />There were only 2 songs I didn't like on this: \\"Nuclear Family\\" sounds kind of uninspired/boring and \\"Troublemaker\\" tries to experiment in a new direction but it doesn't really work for me and gets kind of grating.<br /><br />Other than that, this is an excellent Green Day album. The only other complaint I can think of is that the recordings were WAY too polished but I guess I can't complain about that because these are basically pop rock songs. If you go into this expecting to hear a certain sound or atmosphere, you'll probably disappoint yourself. Enjoy the tunes the way they are and accept that Green Day aren't as abrasive and fast as they once were and that they also don't need to write rock operas to make good songs.<br /><br />For die-hard Green Day fans, you'll either love this or hate it depending on how nostalgic you are of their early days.<br /><br />For the casual Green Day fan, if you give this a chance, this a really good album; there are definitely songs on here that you'll like if you give it a shot.<br /><br />For people who have never really listened to the band, start with \\"Dookie\\" or \\"Nimrod\\" and get a general impression of the band before you start here.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|I love this movie and love the bonus material on it. I stayed up all night the day I got this and watched it!!!
0785139168|5.0|Loved the illustrations of this classic novel!  The accuracy is excellent!  How fun that Marvel is exploring the english literature classics for new material.  I'm a huge fan of Jane Austen, and this was really well-done.  Very pleased with the purchase.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is down to earth honest. America has lost a great patriot; we have lost a great man. Five stars all the way.
B0086700CM|4.0|The second version is better graphics not as good my 9 year old still plays sometimes not a big fan though.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Couldn't put the book down.. Loved it from start to finish! Now I can not wait to see it at the movies!

B00B2V66VS|4.0|Still trying to learn how to play it. My 9 year old is a beast at it graphics are good.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I really enjoyed the first two books but was really disappointed with this last book.  I felt it was rushed and incomplete.  This book leaves you with more questions at the end then you had after the second book.  What happened with Lena's aunt and uncle?  Did the bombs in town work, does Fred survive?  What happens with Tac since Raven was shot?  What happens with Alex and Lena?  What does Julian do?  So the wall was torn down but what happens next, did the government fall in Portland?  What about the other cities?  Does Lena's mother stay around?<br />I really hope Lauren Oliver reconsiders not ending this as a trilogy but as a series.  The writing is great but not enough.  I just finished Raven and I'm again left with another question I won't mention here but will in my review for that book.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so awesome! I've had it for 3 days. I love temple run!!!TEMPLE RUN IS AWESOME!!!You have to run jump slide and it's just so fun!
B006HL9G10|5.0|The app is excellent at making meditation as peaceful as it should be, no interruptions, soft bells, and a countdown to get your body aligned. Everything about the timer and countdown wells well. You can set presets to quickly start future meditations.<br /><br />The best quality, and the reason I'd pay the price for this app, is the map. It is awesome. For example, right now it shows a world map and says &#34;114 people are meditating now&#34;, and with the world map I get an overview of their locations, it looks like 50 or so in North America, 50 or so in Europe, and a handful spread out in Australia, South America, and the Middle East. If you click on the map you get a detailed report of everything the map shows, for example &#34;Danny in Lexington, KY USA is meditating for 20 minutes.&#34; This is a very motivating feature, with both your friends who may meditate or with strangers around the globe. It makes you feel part of a community.<br />(Kindle Fire HD)
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It was a good storyline, but it could have been better. But with all the games made by g5 it was an awesome game

B009WO7NQO|3.0|Just an ok app for me. Lots of glitches/frozen play. Much preferred the addictive play of Rio and original Angry Birds games.
076115728X|5.0|I got this book for my nephews for Easter. I can't wait to see there reponse! I know there going to like it.
1609611543|4.0|The information was great and very thorough! The only issue I have with the book is that he needed to make it easier for the layperson to read it. I have a college degree and there was a couple of parts that was too technical so I just skipped. However, having said all that, the average person will be able to understand enough of it to get the meaning of it. Even with this seemingly negative remark, I do highly recommend it!!!

B0071WQ7WU|5.0|though not my favorite cd of theirs this still has a good mix of songs from quite a fast pace to a slower pace -- still good music so I can't complain.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Recommended by a friend and rightly so.  Great character development. That being said, I didn't &#34;care&#34; for the characters, but was intrigued the entire time and curious about the ending.  Great vacation read.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game that lets people have a horse for free. I wish u could g st gems a little faster and more at a time. All I have to really say is to HAVE FUN!!!!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I was looking for a game that was as good as nightmares from the deep. This one definitely delivers with it's good storyline and balance of the different types of games. I also loved the artistry, it's an art deck style which when combined with the fact that it's set underwater is hauntingly beautiful. definitely going to keep my eye on G5 games, well done guys.
0062014536|2.0|I'm so disappointed and I am glad to see that I am not the only one. This book was sub-par. Dreck. Garbage. I hate that I wasted the money. You completely snowed me Lauren. I think about how how incredible I thought the first 2 books were and I thought book three would be mind blowing, but you couldn't even bother to wrap one story-line up. Even if there is a 4th book, which I imagine there will be since this will be a CW tv show in the fall, I wont bother and I imagine many of my fellow readers won't bother either.

B005ETANC2|5.0|This review is actually just about the Universal Vault presentation (since if you're reading this, you already know the popularity and cultural status of this movie).<br /><br />Purchased my DVD-R Mar 2013<br /><br />Format: Originally filmed on 35mm (Spherical process) and softmatted to 1.85:1 for presentation, this presentation shows you more than the director intended by \\"opening up the matte\\" to a 1.33:1 presentation.  So, while you are getting all the movie, you're also getting what the director didn't intend to be on screen (to a degree).  -.25 in quality<br /><br />PQ: Astounding for print of its agent and not re-mastered.  If the very finest DVDs reach a scale of 4/5 (Bluray being 5/5), this disc would rate 3.60/4 - only marred by specs and flecks and grain a little \\"too\\" apparent at times for my taste. Definitely high quality that no one would complain about.<br /><br />AQ: Originally a Mono (Western Electric Recording) , this presentation is DD 2.0 (Dolby Stereo)w avg 192kbps. No annoying hiss, or tin can sound either. Very fine.<br /><br />This Region 1 (only) DVD-R is recorded with avg Bit Rate of 7.80 Mbps at 480i  29.97 fps so  best presentation will be with a DVD player that upscales (or at least de-interlaces). 8 Chapters stops on the disc (though NO splash / title menu / chapter titles, or special features).<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this purchase of this classic monster flick.  The only thing better would be a blu-ray with special features.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|love these type of games! awesome and sometimes I lose sense of time. cant put game down until finished. lol.
0071390111|4.0|Well organized and written book; gradual approach of all fundamental themes in neuroscience. Certainly one of the best books on the subject

B005723JSQ|5.0|I have really come to enjoy Sophie Kinsella's stories, and this was no exception.  I love how she took a tried and true love story and mixed it with some surprising modern day elements. I could hardly put the book down and recommend it as a quick, light, enjoyable read.
1616550414|5.0|That this book was out before yesterday, I would have given my left pinky finger for it :D. This is a dream book for the fans. This is something amazing that in the back of my subconscious I wish they would have made 10 years ago. Zelda has been my favorite game ever since I first heard of it in 1998 and OoT. I always wanted to know anything and everything about Zelda, and I am not disappointed. LOVE TOU MIYAMOTO!

B006OFN0BQ|4.0|I love Leonardo Dicaprio and actually really enjoyed this movie. Something left me wanting more, left me feeling like maybe I missed something. It was still very good, maybe I went in with too many expectations. Anyway, a good nonetheless.
B00005R2IS|5.0|I have watched the Mad Max movies whenever I get a chance.  Somehow I missed seeing this oneed, which sets the stage for all the moview that follow.
B005NGKMOU|1.0|I guess the title line says it all.  The only captions in this movie are those that are shown when someone speaks spanish.  That does NOT qualify it as &#34;closed captioned.&#34;  This is unethical and smarmy.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This game needs a few touch ups but if you invest in it it gets better its an Amazinggame and if I could id buy it again.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|Really like this dvd and am waiting anixously and hope<br />this is not the end, without a real ending. I don't like<br />having to use my own thoughts for an ending.<br />Thanks<br />Hope
B005WBBYXO|5.0|I downloaded these books from the internet (pirated really) but I love them so much I bought them this time to read again...sorry I stole your books hope this makes up for it. You fall in love with the characters and settings. It is an especially good twist on what religion is/could be leaving the reader open to interpret what is good and evil in these sequences, whether Lyra has done a right or a wrong  thing and the overall consequences of the actions she takes. These books are without a doubt among my most favorites.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have read many books this year and I thought I knew which book was my favo0rite and that nothing would compare until I read this one. Now I'm dying for Walking Disaster to come out next month (4/2/13).<br /><br />At first I had a very difficult time getting into the book. I honestly thought whatever it was that I was reading was dumb. But once that ball got rolling on the story I could not put the book down.<br /><br />I loved the idea of a cocky, hard attitude kind of guy becoming close friends with this girl he'd never met, a girl tht was no where near interested in this woman crazed boy. Especially when all he would do is be a womanizer. But not when it came to her. Things changed. He treated other woman terribly and only saw her in his eyes. But he still made mistakes.<br /><br />I felt like a hopeless romantic reading this book. I wanted so badly for this \\"bad boy\\" to fall in love with an innocent girl. And well, you know what happens.<br /><br />MUST READ!!!!!
B009EHDU7U|5.0|I loved this book from the first paragraph, it portrays an old man who does not want to submit to the restrictions and regimes put on him by living in a rest home and just before his 100yr birthday party he escapes the confines. The author puts coincidences in his path of escape that just seem to happen. The people he meets, his retrospective passages about his life are great. I loved Sonja the elephant and the part she plays in the unlikely group of people who make up the story. A great read and I was sorry when I finished it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's a really fun game and I LOVE how it lets me visit and care for my neighbor's horses.<br />But, I wish you could do competitions without having to have a certain amount of healthcare and happiness though.
1579128955|5.0|I purchased this for my 12 year old nephew and was immediately drawn to it. Very colorful, very interesting. An attractive book with just enough information to keep one interested but not so much that you fall asleep reading it. Wonderful for yourself or others.
B000NQRR1Q|4.0|The movie was certainly interesting but it through us for a loop at the end. Nevertheless I really enjoyed it.
B0095D8ZAA|5.0|This is a fun game for young and old.  My grandson introduced it to me and I play it every morning before I go to work.
B00881VLCE|4.0|puzzles are simple and challenging and keep me entertained.  I like the variety of subject matter in the game and especially love that there are so many free puzzles.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|wouldn't load whoever is handling this for the kindle fire should be fired, how many bad reviews do they need before its fixed?
1609611543|4.0|Loads of information I was not aware of.  Easy recipes and suggestions for an easy transition.  I am a work in progress with letting go of white flour, sugar, etc., however, this book has helped me on the journey.
0385341008|5.0|One of the greatest books I have ever read.  Our Book Club LOVED this book.  Very thought<br />provoking and certainly a very good read!  Read it!
B002ZG999U|5.0|After watching on television just had to buy this to add to our collection.  Love action movies.  There is violence and strong language but no sex and that is plus for us.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|loooved this book.<br /><br />never saw the ending coming!!!!<br /><br />this is a great story line. sometimes it gets a little hard to follow all of the family names/crests/castle names/etc.<br /><br />but as long as you follow the main characters its great. definitely ready to read the next book.
B004JM8X5E|5.0|I watched this movie years ago and liked it then too. This time I watched it with my 12year old son and even he thought it was a cool movie. I feel that this is  a must see movie, great moral to the story too.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|i love the HungerGames series. this book was great, and i really see the movie being as epic and the half blood prince (spoiler alert: shocking death!!!!)<br /><br />but i did get a little annoyed with katniss. her struggle with her feelings and her behavior in this book, definitely is a difference from the previous.<br /><br />still worth the read!!!
0800141849|4.0|I guess you can call this some of the best acting ever !  But then I have secret love for Barbara, she is the female with it all.Looks, voice and acting ability.  She shines and we loved this movie
B005LAIH5O|5.0|usually sequals never live up to the original. this movie was great!<br /><br />loved the action and the spin on the gods.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|I have been building computers since I was 16, I absolutely love it. I decided to build my own this year, I've been wanting to play some games that require a lot better than what my previous computer had. This product along with others has made my computer a crazy game monster machine. I can play games on high settings and easily get between 60-120 fps. &#60;3 &#60;3 &#60;3
B0053O89RY|5.0|i love this show. what i like about season 3 is how they take the most memorable moments from the previous seasons, and incorporate it into the show. Phil, Gloria, and Cam make this show great.
B00AYR2FOI|2.0|I really enjoy Boz Scaggs music.  I grew up with Silk Degrees and Middle Man...Enjoyed Some Change and Dig as well...but I think this Cd misses the mark.  With a steller line up of musicians I thought this CD would be a lot better.  More Upbeat...You have Boz AND Ray Parker, Jr. whom I also grew up with musically...CD is missing the guitar chops that I was expecting.  Don't get me wrong...the CD is enjoyable in spots but very boring in others.  I honestly skipped over Rainy Night in Georgia three minutes in...and the only songs I really like are Cadillac Walk and Pearl of the Quarter.  If you want something mellower from Boz check it out...those looking for something good to drive to work in the morning to...look elsewhere or perhaps the new Aaron Neville CD which I really enjoy.
B003L77G06|5.0|Phil, Cam, and Manny are my favorite characters. the comedic timing is perfect. what i love about this show is that some of the antics of the characters seem outrageous, but we all have that uncle who dresses in full clown make up...lol
B002ZG97EC|5.0|It was shown on television recently, and despite having the blu-ray on the shelf, I sat and watched.  I was a bit surprised when it said it had been edited for content...  This is a kids movie, what kind of content could they be talking about???  As it happens, they cut out the scene where they are talking about the &#34;dart gun&#34;.  Give me a break!<br /><br />Worth watching.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|i love claymation. and finally one without tim burton's influence.<br />great story line.<br />imaginative and interesting. kids and adults would enjoy this movie
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Saw it twice in the theatre, in 3d.  Couldn't wait to buy the disk when it came out.  One of my favourite movies of all time.  Be careful if, like me, you are afraid of heights!  Some bits will have you hanging on to the couch!<br /><br />See it.  See it again.
B003O86FMW|5.0|after the first book, i was hooked. and shocked of what happens to katniss and peeta in this book. great read for kids and adults
0307987299|4.0|This book definitely will keep you guessing.  The twist at the end was so interesting that I had to go back and retread the last few pages!
0811876373|5.0|i have recently started making cake pops. this book is great for holiday and random ideas. also helps you figure out little tips and tricks for designs
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a great game. One of the better mahjong games. I only wish more colors availabe; the blue, red, and white get boring.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|when a friend of mine first recommended this book, i thought it was a complete waste of time. but after the first few chapters I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />the concept is great, just like &#34;Lord of the Flies&#34; without all the metaphorical undertones.<br /><br />cant wait to read the rest!!!!
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This app was free so I got it just to pass time but I ended up playing it for the fun and ease of play.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|i love this show. i think everyone has a family that is unconventional, and i love how this show pokes fun of the day to day life. i like watching the facial reactions of the cast just as much as the dialog. great show!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really addictive once u start playing you can't stop they have better items cheaper items really better than temple run
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|i loved this book.<br />rarely are there times that i laugh out loud when reading books. but tina fey has a way of writing where you feel like she is speaking directly to you.<br />she is relate-able and brings you into her world without it being Liz Lemon awkward.<br /><br />Definitely worth the purchase
1616550414|5.0|is an excellent book for all zelda fans of all ages it has a very nice cover and the content inside the book is very detailed. there is information of all the games of the saga the chronology and a lot of artwork too. is simply awesome
B004LWZW4W|4.0|i love Caesar. to see how everything began was perfect. they even worked in the history of the first word spoken by apes.. &#34;No&#34; this is the first movie in the series that actually made me feel sorry for the apes (and it helps to have tom felton as the bad guy)
B007BT0RKG|1.0|This was not what I needed, it kept saying I needed the &#34;newer&#34; version to view maps and it didn't explain how to get to certain areas, just poked around awhile then deleted it.
B000O599WG|5.0|im a huge john Wayne fan. can't believe i didn't have this on dvd already.<br /><br />one of my favorites, and now i no longer have to wait for it to air on tmc!!!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I saw the movie and wanted to read the book. I'm a sucker for this kind of stuff and I have to say this book was much better than the movie.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|just as great as the first.<br /><br />the story keeps you interested. and the action scenes are well written. its almost as if you are there.<br /><br />this is a great story line. sometimes it gets a little hard to follow all of the family names/crests/castle names/etc.<br /><br />but as long as you follow the main characters its great. definitely ready to read the next book.
B0063M22QO|5.0|i love that it can be a quick fill in when i need something to do  it is clear and a little bit of a challenge on some
B004QX07G4|5.0|it's not easy pulling off mindless rambling in a book. but elen definitely did a great job. Ive never read any of her other books, but this one is great. though she jokes around for 99.999% of the time, there is still some interesting takes on life she has. cant wait to read everything else she has
B001P06GX4|5.0|We bought a number of games to play over the Christmas holiday, and this proved to be a favorite of my 3 teen age boys. If your kids enjoy the tetris computer game they'll probably really enjoy this one.
B002ZG9788|5.0|i almost always hate movie remakes. they never do justice to the original.<br /><br />this movie was great. the action wasn't overdone, and not too much of a love story (i hate love stories in action films).  they even managed to fit Bubo into the movie!
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I bought all 4 seasons of the OC, they all came in time as said and they were perfect condition. The OC is one of my favorite shows, and i have bought all the seasons i have seen the whole show series many times over, and might not ever grow tired of it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|everyone was talking about this, so i had to read.<br /><br />woooow!!!<br /><br />im not easily embarrassed, but i did flush at some of the scenes. not so impressed with the story line and at times Ana can get annoying with her &#34;innocence&#34; . but im sure that will change in the books to follow.<br /><br />cant wait. great read
B008K8X0IS|5.0|It came on time, and box set was in perfect condition, and the little dragon egg paper weight is nice, but its not as detailed as in the photo of it. The show is just GREAT. I know i will be getting a blu-ray box set for every season.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|the ending definitely makes me want to read the last book.<br /><br />at times the story line begins to drag. not very imaginative with anything other than the explicit scenes. but a quick read and kept my interest long enough to finish the book
B000GYI32M|5.0|I bought all 4 seasons of the OC, they all came in time as said and they were perfect condition. The OC is one of my favorite shows, and i have bought all the seasons i have seen the whole show series many times over, and might not ever grow tired of it.
B00340ESIS|4.0|Blake Snyder is supposedly “Hollywood’s most successful spec screenwriter.” I don’t know how that works exactly, since he has exactly two IMDB credits (for Blank Check and Stop or My Mom Will Shoot), but whatever.<br /><br />Save the Cat is basically a book full of little gimmicks for improving a screenplay, as well as pitfalls to avoid. The title comes from the idea of having the hero of the story save a cat early on in the movie to establish his/her likability. It sounds silly, but the examples Snyder gives (it’s not always literally a cat) demonstrate how effective it is. You have to take some of his opinions with a cup or so of salt; he is more concerned with making a script salable than writing something original, which is understandable, except then he proceeds to denigrate Memento, calling it a “low-performing art house film,” and praises the writer of the forgettable Skeet Ulrich movie Chill Factor as a “genius.” (For the record, Memento made $25 million on a $9 million budget; Chill Factor made $11 million on a budget of $70 million. Also, Memento is a cult classic that launched the career of Christopher Nolan of Inception and The Dark Knight fame. Chill Factor is currently chilling at 7% on Rotten Tomatoes.)<br /><br />Still, Save the Cat is worth reading for the very concrete advice it gives in structuring a screenplay. I think his tips apply to screenwriting sort of the way the rules of grammar apply to dialog: you need to internalize them and then forget them. If you doggedly apply the rules to dialog, you end up with stilted dialog. If you insist on following the advice in Save the Cat to the letter, you may end up with a movie like Chill Factor.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This has become my favorite show on TV (behind Doctor Who of course, which will always be number one).  Love having the season on blue ray, and this one also comes with digital copy and dvd as well, so you have many options for watching it.  Haven't explored any extra features, because they aren't really my thing, so I can't speak for those.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Very entertaining, fast moving, and somewhat touching story. Reminds me of the best classic Heinlein. Highly recommended for fans of sci-fi adventure.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|This is an awesome show, and having it on blu ray is nice because I can watch it any time i want in hi def, with subtitles for those actors with really thick accents.  I haven't really checked out the extra features, so I can't speak for those.
B000ETRCMQ|3.0|This is a good movie but those looking for a transgender based movie would be better off with looking towards Another Women, Different for Girls, and of course Boys Don't Cry. As a transgender women it is easy for me to want to give this 5 stars as there is not many movies with a good strong transgender lead. I have never met anyone who came across as clueless as Bree does in this movie. Her son shows very strong discontent right off about his step father and let's it known to her that he never wants to see him. Yet is completely taken back when she reveals she is has stopped in the town and he is upset by this. Then she goes to the fathers house proclaiming she is the bringer of good tidings for his son has come home. Again dumb founded to find out he just wants to go back to raping the kid. \\"Hello? Anyone home?\\"<br /><br />The whole connection between them I thought was uncompleted as it don't say if they ever formed any relationship which was disappointing to say the least. I would of liked to of seen more. Another Women does a much better job of the long lost Parent returning to surprised kids.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the movie for those who plan on watching it. It is not a bad movie just far from great. I would suggest watching it on Netflex or renting it before you buy.
B000AAF1U4|4.0|I love this Disney Movie it's one of my favorites. Davis spade's character is great since so many of us in our world are just so selfish too, and then!!! The writers did a fantastic job with this story.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Has anybody else noticed the photo for this game? what happened to the other one? why Is it this weird photo of whatever that is? Or is it just my kindle??
B00475BUVM|3.0|The Movie itself is not one of my favorite stories, but watching it on our new 3D television was pretty awesome. This 3D movie rated better than some of the previous ones I have seen.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|OMG this game is so amazing it is always fun to break your record and if you get good you can brag to your friends&quot;OMG I just broke 2 million points!&quot; so yea its pretty awesome
0385504225|2.0|In this third iteration, the book has become predictable, no surprises here... Perhaps it would be good if it where the first dan brown novel you are going to read
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Love my Mahjong games. A way to pass the time pleasantly. Nice background music to help you relax and challenging boards to keep you on your toes.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is fun playing with people from all over the world and enjoying trying to win the trophies. Can't wait to play every day.
B005PK56TA|5.0|EERIE and awesome show packed into one hour. If you love hauntings and the macabre, you'll love American hORROR! Start watching today.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is pretty interesting and cute.  I really enjoy the concept and I can play it for hours. It's great!!!!
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I wanted more. Did not want the story to end. Took a while to get into but then could not put down. Recommend
B000RH0C8G|3.0|One of the very few times I have had to say that the movie was better than the book but it certainly was. Plus, the computer guy, Paul DePodesta, who comes across as a genuis, was later the G M of The Dodgers and he was an unmitigated disaster!!!!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this show! Bring me season 4 already!<br /><br />Left us on a total cliff-hanger at the end of the season ;-)
0385344228|5.0|This is amazingly clever & beautifully written. I defy anyone to think they know how this ends!!! I am now reading all of his stuff!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This app is fun. could use some upgrades and more diversity to keep it interesting, but still cool and something to do
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Really appreciate a calculator that is so easy to read and to operate. The keys are large and even fat fingers don't have trouble
B00355L2TU|5.0|Love this I have been doing it for 9 days and can already see and feel a diference cant wait to move on.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|I love the whole CD, that's the first time with Christina's CD'S. All her older music, I only liked a few on each of her older CD's
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I liked this book, it was easy to read and followed along seamlessly. I am looking forward to more books.
B007V2UGPE|1.0|it's a great game yea but it reset all my stuff I heat the game spent money on it and now I have to restart
B00005JLCI|5.0|This is the only full script Hamlet I have ever seen as a movie.  Branagh is the best and most authentic Hamlet I have ever seen.  I enjoy seeing different presentations of Hamlet, with the interpretations ranging from psycho Hamlet, to depressed Hamlet, to confused Hamlet, to scheming Hamlet, to gay Hamlet.  The greatness of this play lies in the scope of human range and the room the play has to contain elements of this and much more.<br />Branagh touches on all of this and more.  And when he dies, and you already know he's going to die, you feel hurt and empty because you have come to love him.
B00005JKG9|5.0|DVD quality was great, brand new in packaging just like I bought it at the store.  Couldn't have asked for a better copy of it.
B009AMAJPA|2.0|A paranoid mob boss named Alphonse (Terrence Howard) is looking to expand his territory, but is currently distracted by an unknown assailant taking out his men and mailing him strange pictures to rub salt in the wound. His right hand man Victor (Colin Farrell) falls into the seducing grasp of his neighbor Beatrice (Noomi Rapace), who blackmails Victor into helping her rid of the man who's responsible for leaving her disfigured and destroying her life, which meddles with Victor's own vengeful agenda.<br /><br />\\"Dead Man Down\\" is directed by Niels Arden Oplev, the man who brought us the original \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.\\" It's his first English-language film and it reunites him with Swedish actress Noomi Rapace. What some don't realize is that \\"Dead Man Down\\" is actually a WWE Studios production; a production studio that was formerly notorious for casting wrestlers in starring roles. Stu Bennett, also known as Wade Barrett in WWE, has a supporting role in \\"Dead Man Down.\\"<br /><br />The crime thriller attempts to establish this neo-noir style, but basically reveals everything too early. So by the time other characters stumble onto the truth the audience has already known about it for well over an hour and it never really has that sense of mystery that could have added that extra spark it needed to be better than average.<br /><br />The cast seems somewhat remarkable at first glance, but is a bit of a letdown overall. Most of the film rests on the shoulders of Colin Farrell and Noomi Rapace, but they never quite mesh properly on-screen together. Farrell shows a moment of passion when he reveals his identity to a hostage and is at his strongest when he's watching home movies in his apartment where he lets his eyes do all the talking, but is mostly forgettable the rest of the time. Rapace has made a career out of playing damaged characters, so she's at her best when she's threatening Victor into helping her or the moments when she breaks down from coping with her disfigurement. Terrence Howard is unintentionally hilarious as his high pitched cursing will make you laugh out loud. The most surprising additions are Dominic Cooper as one of Alphonse's men who's constantly playing detective and a brief appearance by Armand Assante as one of Alphonse's investors who suddenly has second thoughts.<br /><br />There's a scene in the middle of the film where the camera kind of teeter-totters slowly while Victor and Alphonse talk to one another. This scene is like a metaphor for the entire film. On one hand, the film establishes several striking shots even though the film seems to purposely reside in this thick fog of darkness; the staircase sequence and the fireflies in the graveyard are visually fascinating. Imagine a sloth trying to sludge through a mud puddle and you've got an idea of how the film progresses. Despite its pace being extremely slow, there's this tense atmosphere and the conversations between Victor and Beatrice and Alphonse and Victor are intriguing despite never really going anywhere.<br /><br />On the other hand, it seems like the film is trying to sabotage itself at times. The first big action sequence in the film doesn't have a very big impact because they decided to have it dance along to dubstep, which doesn't work at all and just makes everything feel out of place. What little logic the film had is thrown out the window in the final act. Why settle on a plan that's been carefully constructed from the ground up for months when we can settle for something more spontaneous and impulsive?<br /><br />\\"Dead Man Down\\" is really sluggish at first, but tends to be really compelling in this overpowering \\"so bad it's good\\" kind of way. The story is a tale of revenge coiled inside another tale of revenge wrapped around a power struggle, so things get more than a little convoluted at times. Its explosive finale tries to live up to the rest of the film's slow building nature, but is mostly just impotent. Good, bad, even \\"Dead Man Down\\" can't seem to decide.ead Man Down\\" can't seem to decide.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I bought this to add to the first 2 I have to have all and it was real good just like the first 2.
B008JFUN8C|3.0|Set in Kansas in 1905, \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" introduces Oscar Diggs (James Franco), also known as Oz, a traveling magician with Baum Bros Circus. Oscar is also a professional con artist, but doesn't give nearly enough credit to his loyal assistant Frank (Zach Braff). Oscar has always dreamt of being a great man, but his lack of ethics and morality and extremely greedy intentions have always held him back. He is accidentally thrown into the Land of Oz where he meets Theodora (Mila Kunis), her sister Evanora (Rachel Weisz), their rival Glinda (Michelle Williams), a living China Girl (Joey King), and a talking flying monkey in a bell hop suit named Finley (Zach Braff). The prophecy has foretold that a wizard who shares the name of the land will come to save everyone from the clutches of The Wicked Witch. Even though everyone in Oz believes him to be that wizard Oscar can't find the courage to tell everyone the truth.<br /><br />\\"The Wizard of Oz\\" is in dire need of a revisit. It was something that was seen at a very young age. Not much is remembered other than having a fear of flying monkeys and trying to get a glimpse of that urban myth of one of the munchkins hanging themselves on set and the sequence supposedly making it into the final print of the film. Judging \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" as a stand-alone film was the only option since it had been so long.<br /><br />You can go ahead and welcome Danny Elfman back to a Sam Raimi film. This is Elfman's first collaboration with Raimi in nearly nine years and it's Elfman's score that helps bring that circus theme to life. The opening credits are particularly eye-catching and immediately establish that carnival-like atmosphere. The fantasy adventure begins in black and white and is presented in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio (full screen). It opens with the Baum Bros traveling circus and you witness some of the tricks Oscar has up his sleeve. The tornado sequence is done really well as the debris flying around makes full use of the 3D effect and the organ that passes by is a little unsettling in a good way. Once Oscar makes it to Oz, the film transitions to color and the aspect ratio changes to 2.35:1 (widescreen). The moments when Oscar is witnessing the colorful and wondrous Oz for the first time may be the highlight of the film. Personally speaking, those particular moments are really influential; someone being taken out of their element and placed in a strange new world is just amazing and reminiscent of \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" in a way.<br /><br />The film hits its peak once Oscar arrives in Oz. Oscar meets Theodora (Kunis) and saves Finley (Braff) who becomes Oscar's life servant because of it. After meeting Evanora (Weisz), Oscar sets out to the Dark Forest to break the staff of The Wicked Witch and become king. They meet a little China Girl (King) who decides to tag along after Oscar fixes her broken legs. Finley is the best character of the film. He's hilarious nearly every time he opens his mouth. The Dark Forest is also really creepy and the flying baboons are even more terrifying than their relatives.<br /><br />Everything is progressing smoothly until Glinda (Williams) is introduced. Just because she's The Good Witch doesn't mean she has to be so lame and boring. All she really does is make fog and bubbles. The film suddenly takes a dive into really cheesy territory at this point, too. The special effects seem a bit too overzealous at times as witches probably shouldn't fly around and shoot fireballs or electricity from their hands as often as they do. Mila Kunis is kind of awkward as The Wicked Witch. She's believable as Theodora, but once she transforms it almost seems like she's trying too hard. Her constant squawking and bizarre and rigid hand movements make her seem more like a giant parrot than anything else. Rachel Weisz is mostly satisfying as Evanora until she starts shouting at everyone near the end of the film. Then her voice suddenly starts cracking more oftenthan the Squeaky Voiced Teenager on \\"The Simpsons.\\"<br /><br />If you're planning on seeing this in theaters, the 3D is utilized quite well and used rather frequently so it's worth the money.

B001HC8516|5.0|Cuando vi la película se veía muy interesante lo que tenía que decir, y en realidad lo es, muy directo y abarca varios temas.
B0098VXMNE|5.0|Despite the sometimes gratuitous sex scenes, the story in itself was amazingly written. The fight scenes were awesome, even though some would complain about the over use of blood spatter. I think it makes it more realistic. I have seen too many movies and TV shows that after battle, the heroes or villains come away with clean swords.<br /><br />I would recommend it to everyone who loves a good epic, but it is definitely not for children.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is awesome you just can't stop turning page after page. I hope the third book is as good as the first to wow so in love with these books I could read them again and again

B000AJIF4E|5.0|These headphones are great.  They are very light and the sound quality is outstanding.  I love how they fold for storage and the extra long cord is helpful when using with my camcorder.  Great product!
1602834849|5.0|This is a delightful, clever story! I feel as if I've been allowed into the circle of those who have the privilege to know the Queen of England intimately. It is also a testament to the value of conscious reading and to how that is essential in the journey of a writer.
B00A2H9LK6|2.0|I got everything I was promised when I bought this movie. However, when I saw this in theaters I loved it, and now I don't. Partly, it's the weak 3d to 2d transition. If you don't have a 3d tv, the moments when creatures thrust things at the screen become surprisingly weak; somehow is worse than when a movie made for 2d features an object thrust at the screen. There's not enough depth, or something. Plot wise, the movie is just lame. For me, it used to be &#34;fun&#34; lame, but now it just seems lame. Pity.

B008JFC6F0|2.0|There has been an unfortunate trend in the music business as of recent, in which sound engineers over-compress a recording in order to make it sound louder, but damaging the dynamic range. This has become known to many as the dreaded 'Loudness Wars'. It has plagued many 'remasters' including Nine Inch Nail's 2010 remaster of Pretty Hate Machine, and subsequent releases of classic Beatles records. The compressing of an album is done for the sake of consistency. God forbid little Joey need to turn the volume nod up a notch from album to album on his iPod (A note here: the normalization function would do this just fine). Unfortunately, this is damaging the overall quality of sound. The first time I had heard anything by Tame Impala was on YouTube, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. I purchased the CD after hearing the truly excellent 'Music to Walk Home By', and was pleasantly surprised. It came in a very nice shrink wrapped Digipak case, with truly gorgeous album art. In a fold on the cover, you have the liner notes which list the lyrics. Everything package wise is very good, and I must say again that the album art - at least for me - is one of the best that has come in quite a while. But once I ripped it to my PC using EAC, my ears had started to hurt after the sixth song. I decided to affirm my notions that the CD had been overly compressed, by going on the Dynamic Range Database. To my dismay, I saw that Lonerism has indeed been affected negatively by the dreaded trend of over compression. Before I end the review, I must state that this album, music wise, is absolutely fantastic. If not for the poor mastering, I would have easily given the product a 4.5. I can only hope that in the years to come, Lonerism will get an ACTUAL remaster, so that the dynamics will remain intact on the retail release.<br /><br />Feel free to disagree/ask me anything in the comments.<br /><br />EDIT: As of recent, I have discovered that there is an unmastered version floating around. It is essentially the same mix without the volume levels turned up to the point of over compression and distortion. Drums in particular sound much better. Buy the CD and/or vinyl and support the artist and then go look for that particular version. Great album, problem solved!<br />The two star still stands though, as this is a product review of the CD and not the unmastered mix floating around out there.ame mix without the volume levels turned up to the point of over compression and distortion.

B004YAS9M8|5.0|I only recently found Ludovico Einaudi's music and I'm so glad I did.  I was looking for some interesting piano music and I was a little tired of the same old classical piano pieces (love them but wanted something different) and I didn't really like the \\"new age\\" piano samples I was hearing.  Ludovico's original compositions are breathtaking.  They are so unusual and have such emotion I could listen to them over and over again, and some days I do.  This is a double CD with 27 tracks and is about two and a half hours of beautiful music.  I was going to list a couple of my favorite pieces, but I like them all so much and I can't choose.  At $22.99 it seems kind of pricy but I think this one is well worth the cost.  The first Ludovico Einaudi music I bought was his Nightbook CD.  I had heard The Crane Dance and that sold me on the CD.  I knew right then his music was going to take up a lot of space in my collection.  I notice he has some repetition from CD to CD over the years and some of his pieces show up a few times but they never get old.  If you like Islands you might also like Nightbook [[ASIN:B002I8IZOU Nightbook]] and his newest CD, In A Time Lapse [[ASIN:B00AIQVLV8 In a Time Lapse]] I like both of these CD's as much as I like Islands.  Ludovico Einaudi is well worth the investment.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Drawn from the book Team of Rivals, this is probably the best film I have ever seen.  Everything is perfect in this film, from Danial Day-Lewis' performance, to the script, to the set decoration, costume design, and cinematography.  The film is not only beautiful, it is historically accurate in its discussion of a very short period of time in our nation's history.  This is an absolutely must see film.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Finally!  A full length game!  I had no issues with bugs and the ads are unobtrusive.  Plan to keep playing until I get 3 stars in all levels.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Sir Fellowes is an excellent writer, and his characters are enthralling.  This is a must watch for anyone who enjoys the English lifestyle of the early 20th century.  The series is a wonderful study of the daily lives of not only British royalty, but the lower classes, as well.  Heartwarming, fun, and sometimes achingly sad, this is an excellent series.
0385366752|2.0|The story is wonderful, and would be a great discussion book for book clubs.  My poor rating is specifically meant for the audio version.  Even more specifically, for the male narrator in the audio version.  Although his voice was nice, I almost gave up on the recording multiple times due to his VERY annoying habit of sharply, loudly inhaling at the end of (about)every 3rd sentence.  I found myself having to start sections over (and over and over) because I was so distracted by his sharp inhale that I found myself counting sentences rather than focusing on the story.<br />Read the book.  READ it, don't listen to it.
B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Very enjoyable thriller about a CIA agent who retrieves 6 Americans from Iran, where they are in hiding in the Canadian Embassy.<br />Very good acting.  A bit of a nail biter, too.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|i could write an essay on why i hate this book.    First and foremost, any abuse survivor should not read this. Not because of the kinky sex that barely edges into s&m territory, but because of the absolutely horrifying relationship between Christian and Anna. It is straight up emotional abuse as he can stomp all over her every time she asserts herself, and yet she is terrified to ever question anything he does. This is not the dynamic of two people who are in love with each other.     Even though they repeatedly stress that they are NOT in a D/s relationship (dominant/submissive), he is a total controlling jerk to her, dictating who she can see, what she can wear, what she eats, he forces her to take birth control, forces her to go to the gym, get waxed,  it's really disgusting. What is even more disgusting is our insipid protagonist occasionally starts to seem self aware enough to realize her awesome boyfriend is a domineering ass, but then gets distracted by mediocre sex. and seriously her internal dialogue which seems to consist primarily of \\"s***\\" \\"oh s***\\" or \\"oh my\\" is pathetic, especially since it's stressed she's intelligent. It's awful. I just want to stress that my distaste for the book as nothing to do with the heavily touted sex scenes. Those are boring and repetitive, but I have seriously problems with how the woman in the book lets her boyfriend treat her like a child while constantly swooning at either his good looks or his epic bank account. after a while it seems like the only redeeming quality this guy has is that he's incredibly wealthy, though that obviously gets turned on its ear by the fact that every time he treats Ana like an insipid child, he buys her something fancy to distract her from the fact he either didn't let her see friends, wear what she wanted, or actually enjoy being a 21 year old....which is such a horrible statement on how the author must view women or male/female interactions. but seriously, if Christian was broke or middle class, people wouldn't find him so dreamy. nothing about him is redeeming other than the trappings of wealth he surrounds himself with. It's awful. The whole series of awful. It makes Twilight read like Chaucer.    I swear this trilogy set feminism back about a hundred years and the fact that so many women love this terrifies the hell out of me.
0988262592|5.0|This fun, confidence -inspiring read helps re-imagine all-too-common daily technology fire drills as opportunities to improve your organization.

0143120530|4.0|Foer's book is definitely worth reading although sometimes I got confused by what Foer tries to convey. Moonwalking with Einstein describes a path that a normal journalist become a champion of USA Memory Championship. It proves the idea that memory is not determined by talent. It is about the time people spend on them. For example, the &#34;best predictor of an individual's chess skill is not the amount of chess he's played, but rather the amount of time he's spent sitting alone working through old games.&#34; So, if you read Moonwalking with Einstein, I promise you will find your own way to become the champion of any memory contest. This book is totally a great one that deserves spending time reading it.

B009GJCFL8|3.0|I have been trying to give Asia the benefit of the doubt for many years. I am a lifelong fan of all the bands that they came from (Yes, ELP, King Crimson, Buggles) I own a many of their CDs. I was very hopeful when I read everyone else's review of this live set so I was not predisposed to dislike this music. The fact is that, even at their best, Asia simply is not the progressive yet melodic super group that the sum total of their individual legacies should add up to. Please forgive this respectful yet dissenting opinion that Asia has ultimately failed to live up to the formidable talents of it's member's capabilities. I place this responsibility squarely on John Wetton and Geoff Downes. John's songwriting is often formulaic and insipid, his overuse of certain tonal progressions and resolutions feels maudlin and grating after a short while, with many songs sounding like the other and lyrics that say nothing and go nowhere covering similar self-referencial love-related and political PC issues but rarely ringing the bell of authenticity in the super simplified phrasings; rarely are the lyrics and melody well integrated. The rare joy I got from this DVD were Steve Howe's solo acoustic mini-set and the more prog cut Time Again. As musicians, these guys are very precise, but lazy. They are not challenging themselves enough to play their instruments more innovatively; they've acheived their super-fame and no longer need to try all that hard anymore. Sad to say so many bands have fallen into this same trap over time, Yes particularly, but Asia started out this way, almost as a pop-vanity band for aqing prog rockers who can't be bothered to push the envelope any further. Geoff Downes really has to get his keyboard unstuck from the one or two sounds he seems to be able to make, it doesn't sound like a mellotron Geoff, it still sounds stuck in the 80s candy chime electric piano mode. Give it a little attack, the keyboards here nudge the sound 3 notches toward muzak.  I did like his playing on Time Again though. None of these guys ever really lets loose and opens up on their instruments, they are trapped by the song structures themselves.<br /><br />I realize my words won't be popular here but someone has to say this. I am sad and I care because I actually love these guys separately -- they're my true heros. Together however, Asia still sounds like a cruise ship rock pop show, Steve Howe being the only exception. Look, Keith Emerson is still making great music, Steve Hackett, Chris Squire (Squackett) Steve Wilson, Glass Hammer, Izz, there's so much great prog out there that in contrast John's work here seems build on sand. I can accept that maybe Asia just really only wanted to be a pop band but their image and combined legacy should have yielded so much more.

B00B4Z5J92|5.0|A great documentary for a first time Director! So much dimension for a film that I thought was only about a once famous Studio in LA. There's so much depth to the story. Like how Digital started and the artists began recording using it, until big studios are not needed anymore to make music. It features a lot of Artists that I haven't heard of before and I now I'm starting to listen to their music. For me, the real essence of this film is how people can connect to each other, form a bond and can make great music together and you can only do that if you are recording on a studio unlike most of today's artist where they can just record their individual parts at home and put it together using a software. Okay enough talk, watch this film!

0345803493|2.0|EL JAMES - 50 SHADES DARKER<br /><br />Blurb......<br /><br />Romantic, liberating and totally addictive, the Fifty Shades trilogy will obsess you, possess you, and stay with you for ever ...<br /><br />Daunted by the dark secrets of the tormented young entrepreneur Christian Grey, Ana Steele has broken off their relationship to start a new career with a US publishing house.<br /><br />But desire for Grey still dominates her every waking thought, and when he proposes a new arrangement, she cannot resist. Soon she is learning more about the harrowing past of her damaged, driven and demanding Fifty Shades than she ever thought possible.<br /><br />But while Grey wrestles with his inner demons, Ana must make the most important decision of her life. And it's a decision she can only make on her own ...<br /><br />Well, I'll try and find something positive to say about this unfortunate read. It's only 532 pages long and despite not being what I would call a typical page-turner you can eat the pages up quite quickly! And I suppose anything that creates a media buzz and makes people who usually wouldn't read, pick up a book can't be a bad thing.<br /><br />So why did I read it? Well, in the Keane household, I have a habit of reading what my wife has read previously, just so we can compare afterwards. Typically she reads the likes of Linwood Barclay, Harlan Coben, Tess Gerritsen etc, so whilst these aren't on my A-list of people I would typically read through choice I have enjoyed some of these authors, some more than others. Anyway the girls at her work were reading these and chatting about them in the summer; ergo it's my time a couple of months down the line.<br /><br />I have to say James can write better than I can, though whether she is a good writer is doubtful in my opinion. For the record; I don't write and I don't have any aspirations to write but a big part of me has admiration for those who do and those who strive to, irrespective of whether or not they have any great talent.) But hey, she's sold a zillion books and has probably made a sizeable chunk of change doing so, so good luck to her.<br /><br />So back to the book............mildly interesting at the points where Ana interacts with others, sex parts - dull, tedious and repetitive. Worst parts - Ana's continual naval-gazing where she ponders her Christian, and the situation and anticipates seeing her hunk of Steele, but not before getting in touch with her inner-goddess first. The only mildly interesting person in the book is Christian's gopher, Taylor but that's probably because he sits on the edge of things most of the time. I did find myself pondering my naval and trying to get in touch with my inner god, to see if perhaps Taylor knocked out Christian with a tyre iron, having finally decided he was fed-up being a paid slave, and whether could he be the right man for Ana....... but hey, life like a lot of books you read, doesn't always turn out as you hope.<br /><br />I do wonder whether, Ana's Christian, that abusive, controlling gazillionaire hunk of a man who, perfect in every way will finally start expelling fragrant diamond-encrusted stools in an effort to finally put the seal on their troubled relationship.<br /><br />Anyway Ana and Christian, Christian and Ana......roll on book 3....crikes, I can hardly wait!<br /><br />2 OUT OF 5great talent.)

0307463745|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  It's written by two employees of the 37signals company, which develops software such as Campfire, Highrise and Basecamp.<br /><br />It takes aim at a lot of common business approaches and practices and starts hurling darts.  Some paraphrased examples:<br /><br />1) Meetings are usually excuses to NOT get something done.<br />2) If you're a workaholic, you've probably got nothing else going on in your life AND you are most likely an inefficient worker.<br />3) Companies with too much bureaucracy are, in essence, stating that they don't trust their employees by establishing too many rules and approval processes.<br />4) It's not essential for a business to keep growing all the time.<br />5) Products that are good enough are more than acceptable.<br />6) Focus on a few excellent things rather than a host of mediocre ones.<br /><br />While the book's not thin at 271 pages, the text is amply spaced and there are quite a few graphics throughout.  Personally, I prefer a business book that's short and to the point AND appreciate the pictorial content.  If you like Hugh Macleod ([[ASIN:159184259X Ignore Everybody: and 39 Other Keys to Creativity]]; [[ASIN:B00B9ZHINM Freedom Is Blogging in Your Underwear]]), you'll probably like this, too.

B009LGO88E|4.0|For those on a bit of a time limit, I'll leave a brief list of Pros vs. Cons, and a detailed review afterwards.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Improved control functionality in some games, mainly action titles<br />- Grips on the sides keep the hands from cramping up anymore<br />- Extra triggers prove to be far more handy than anticipated<br />- Adds another Circle Pad for greater control<br />- VERY good battery life (requires 1 AAA every once in a while)<br />- Goes in standby mode after 5 minutes of not being used to conserve battery<br />- Region free!<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Shipping costs because it's an import<br />- Shipping times<br />- Small selection of titles that use it<br />- Requires some breaking in to make the analog a bit more comfortable<br />- The added weight could bother some, but I personally like my devices to have some weight to them so this is a plus for me<br /><br />I'm a big action gamer, so when I picked up my 3DS XL, the first game I got was Metal Gear Solid 3D. I noticed that it had the option for a Circle Pad Pro attachment so every time I would buy a new game, I'd see if it also had that functionality. I ended up having three games that use it; aforementioned Metal Gear Solid 3D, Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance, and Resident Evil Revelations all of which are quite good (MGS has some framerate issues at times, but almost never during actual gameplay). Having played these titles quite a bit, I decided it was time to move on from using the face buttons as camera movement  and pick up a Circle Pad Pro.<br /><br />Now unfortunately, for whatever reason Nintendo hasn't localized the Circle Pad Pro XL to North America and I hadn't realized this when I bought my XL; I have somewhat large hands and the standard 3DS model cramps up my hands like nobody's business. This means that the CPP XL has to be imported, and shipping costs can hurt the wallet a bit more than anticipated. So on top of the 20$ the unit costs alone, I had to throw an extra 10$ shipping to boot. I understand that to some people, the purchase isn't entirely worth it since not many games use it. However I can't express enough how much better Resident Evil feels with another analog stick and two sets of trigger buttons.<br /><br />So if you're willing to deal with the shipping costs and time as well as the small selection of compatible games, you'll have one more thing to deal with. When I received mine I got a little excited and immediately slapped it on. The first thing I noticed was that the analog was a little stiff and if moved in just the right direction, it would make some crunchy sounds, like there was something inside of it. This was immediately a red flag, but I moved it around a whole lot and did everything I could to break it in hoping to alleviate the problem and so far seems to have worked.<br /><br />So overall, if you're patient enough to deal with the price, the shipping times, a little bit of breaking in, and the small selection of games, it really does offer greatly improved functionality in the games that use it (aside from Kid Icarus, from which I understand uses it for left-handed mode) and is worth the purchase in my opinion.0$ shipping to boot.

1433532778|5.0|I was pleasantly surprise at the quality of this cowhide leather ESV Study Bible  printed in the USA by Crossway. I expected it to be of average quality at best..sorry Crossway. When I open the box and took the plastic wrapping off of the Bible I was shocked to feel how  soft and nice the binding on this Bible is. Very nice feel to the leather and I own a couple of A L Allen Goatskin bound Bibles and 4 Cambridge bound goatskin Bibles, so I know how a quality leather Bibles feels in your hand. I was so pleased with the Bible I gave it a 5 star.<br />  I would assuming you are sold on the ESV, so I am not going there. It is a kin to the NASB, but a litter more readable...say in todays English.I like the flow of the ESV better than the NASB. Both are very good Bibles.  I am going to also assume that you know how good the ESV Study Bible is. If not, Google it, and read about all of the work that has gone into putting this study Bible together and what it has to offer.<br />  But you need to realize that this is &#34;ONE BIG BIBLE&#34; filled with  a lot of information. It is too big to carry to church on Sunday for me and I am BIG GUY.  It is the type of Bible that you would sit down at your breakfast table or desk,  open up, and dig into...It would be good for use at a in-home Bible study group....or take with you to the coffee shop and ponder of the scriptures. In other words you need a table or desk that you can put it down on and open it up and take notes/study.<br />  The &#34;personal size&#34;  version of this Bible would be more suitable for carrying to church or carrying anywhere, but, but... the print is smaller in it. I can read it fine with my glasses on...no eye strain and I can see it without the glasses, so the print in the &#34;personal size&#34; is OK. They have come a long way with imitation leathers too, so don't rule out the other bindings. ...good looking, soft and pliable....nicer feel and more durable than some leathers.

0553801473|1.0|This is one of those series where it just feels like the author grew to hate everything to do with the world he had created and started wantonly slaughtering the main characters with no thought as to how he was going to fill in the gaps that they left in the story.  Between the 5 years it took him to write this and the fact that he is off writing another series of books now I would DEFINITELY advise against buying anything that this author writes until he completely finishes the series or you might just get burned like so many have .  Oh and what was the deal with the so many chapters being dedicated to shallow boring characters that had no influence on the overall story.  It felt to me like they were just there to add extra chapters to an overly long book in a series that will in all likely hood never be finished due to the author dying of old age half way through the 7th book.  That and I don't know about you but I don't fee like waiting another decade for books six and seven to be released.

B00004OCQ2|5.0|If you love Badlands, it's a must. If you want to dabble in Badlands, this may not be your cup of tea but its pretty representative of what their music is about. What's really impressive is that these are demos...yep, just demos. They sound extremely polished to me and it would be hard to believe that Badlands could have gone back in the studio to make it better. This album does have a raw stripped down sound...but that's what they do. It's high powered hard rock that cuts to the bone. It's just a shame that they could only muster three releases but I suppose it's better than nothing.

B00006L9ZT|5.0|This was my introduction to the Ring in the mid 1990s on VHS. I enjoyed it then and am sure it looks/sounds much better on DVD. I will buy it if I ever have the spare cash (I usually prefer opera audio only so I can visualize in a theater of the mind). For awhile I wasn't into Levine's Wagner, mainly because of slow tempi. But I've recently revisited and reevaluated his work, deciding that the sheer beauty of his interpretation and the sound of the Met orchestra outweighs any test of my patience. If I get restless in the presence of such sublimity, the fault is surely mine.

0307959856|3.0|In some ways, Death Comes to Pemberley met my expectations, and in some ways it didn't. Six years after Elizabeth and Darcy have married, disaster strikes on the night before Pemberley's annual ball, when Lydia Wickham, Elizabeth's disgraced sister arrives, shrieking that Wickham has been  murdered. She, Wickham, and Captain Denny, who you'll remember from Pride and Prejudice were driving to Pemberley to foist Lydia onto Elizabeth, when Denny and Wickham both left the coach after an argument, and Lydia heard gun-shots. When Darcy, Colonel Fitzwilliam, a new character, Mr. Alveston, and a few other men go to investigate, they find that it is Denny, not Wickham who is dead. Wickham is of course the prime suspect, and what follows is an investigation of the murder.<br /><br />As I said, I had mixed feelings about this book. First of all, it's not \\"authentic\\"; even though Pride and Prejudice is a work of fiction, the actual book is what \\"really\\" happened, and all these spin-offs aren't \\"real\\" (even though none of it is real). Plus, I didn't like what P.D. James did with some of the characters. I really liked Colonel Fitzwilliam, and he was portrayed in somewhat of a negative light in this version. However, I really liked one of the main new characters introduced, Mr. Alveston, a lawyer who has fallen in love with Georgiana Darcy. He's smart, handsome, and kind, and unlike many men during this time, actually believes that women have souls, and have minds. Shocking, I know. He's called a radical once, and he probably would be considered one in that time period, but I really liked him.<br /><br />I also wished that Darcy and Elizabeth's relationship would have been touched upon more. That's mainly why (I, at least) read continuations like this. I want to see not just what happens to the characters, but also how their relationships shift and change. And we didn't get enough of that.<br /><br />Also, the book is set in 1803. Isn't Pride and Prejudice supposed to be set in the 1810's or so: Regency England? I think the author got her dates wrong...Though I may be wrong.<br /><br />My final criticism was that it seemed like everything was over-dramatized. At the beginning, before the murder even happens, Elizabeth is worrying about who Georgiana is going to marry, Mr. Alveston or Colonel Fitzwilliam. And I kept wanting to say to her, \\"It's not as big of a deal as you seem to think it is! Georgiana will just marry whoever she loves! And neither of them is poor!\\" Of course, she probably wouldn't understand me because of my new-age lingo. Even the murder itself seemed over-dramatized. Elizabeth, Darcy, and the other characters just agonize over it way too much. Sure, it's unpleasant and very sad for Captain Denny, but it's not like it's something that's going to ruin the rest of your life. That's how they were acting. Part of it was that the murder involves George Wickham, who those at Pemberley are not particularly friendly with. But still.<br /><br />However, I did like the author's writing style; it felt good, even though she didn't really take the book where I wanted it to go. A quote that I liked: \\"By 1803, therefore, Mrs. Bennet could be regarded as a happy woman so far as her nature allowed and had even been known to sit through a four-course dinner in the presence of Sir William and Lady Lucas without once referring to the iniquity of the entail.\\" (pg. 12).<br /><br />Death Comes to Pemberley was on okay book, but it pales in comparison to the great Austen herself. It wasn't really bad (though other reviewers thought it was); it just wasn't...good.<br /><br />My blog is at novareviews.blogspot.com.
B003F3FJQO|4.0|This was easier to read than \\"The Maze Runner\\". There are a lot of twists, almost too many. It's good but I don't know if will read a new series from this author.

B00AYDC5HY|3.0|I made the mistake of renting this for my kids. I really probably should have read more reviews and thought it out a bit more. They both ended up traumatized about dying animals and zombies. Overall it was claymation which I don't particularly like anyway and the story was a bit morbid. Definitely something for older teens/adults not young children!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ilove this game because this game has seasons with a lot of new things and players just like frizzy prince fresh and all of the other players so rock on

B008ZOHCKE|4.0|It was simple and easy to use, and I loved the design.  But there was no Cloud Backup.  I'm sure there's a way to back up your notebooks, but I'm looking for a secure automatic way just in case it gets taken off my Kindle accidentally.  Other than that, it's great.  If you enjoy it, I would suggest making sure the information is backed up somehow and frequently.  This is something I can't do because I'm looking for something that will keep my college work secure and organized.
B003Y5USG4|5.0|I love tornados as long as they leave me alone. I could actually feel the anxiety of the characters during the chases especially the last one with their last Dorothy. I also loved the drama that went on. I highly recommend this movie for tornado lovers of all kinds!!!
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|I had no problems understanding it and it was easy to use, but ultimately, it wasn't for me.  I can see how it would be handy to jot something down quickly, but I'm looking for something I can use to break down deadlines for school.  I still haven't completely decided if I'm going to use it for things like shopping lists or to jot down ideas, but this is the app to do that with.

0446580848|3.0|It must get harder and harder for an author to sustain a popular series.  In time, the characters become long in the tooth, and the plots more difficult to create.  Such is the case in this 600-plus-page novel in the John Corey/Kate Mayfield series.  This time, following the last adventure in which they killed The Lion, the husband-and-wife team is tasked with finding an American, known as The Panther, who returned to Yemen to lead an al Qaeda terrorist group.<br /><br />Apparently The Panther was instrumental in planning the attack on the USS Cole in Yemen, and the Anti-Terrorist Task Force asks the pair to travel to the Middle Eastern country as part of a small group to apprehend or assassinate The Panther.  The theory, of course, is that the suspect could not resist the lure of the possibility of capturing the killers of The Lion.  So they go, and the novel plods on, describing various aspects of the search for the target and conditions in the Yemeni capital and second city, as well as descriptions of conditions in the tribal lands.<br /><br />Not only is the book heavy, but so is the story.  It surely could have been reduced to half the size and been made more readable.  Much of it is repetitive, and Cory's wisecracks are becoming tiresome, not very amusing, as if the author is trying too hard.  It's too bad, because Mr. DeMille has certainly written some fine novels, and is capable of much more than writing a continuing commercial effort.

B00BNYCFNM|5.0|Big Big Train hit their stride with \\"The Underfall Yard\\" and they just seem to get stronger and more confident with each release. I actually like this second installment of  \\"English Electric\\" a tad more than the first one as they continue to amaze with unique song structure and using instruments that you don't usually associate with progressive rock. There is not a wasted moment or uninteresting song to be heard on this CD and I suspect that I'll be listening to nothing else for a solid week or so.<br /><br />It's such a tragedy that the music business has changed so much in the last 15 years or so as Greg Spawton and co. would have filled arenas and held their own with the best of them in the '70's. A very fresh sounding recording that manages to pay homage to it's roots and yet is head and shoulders above the typical new generation progressive bands recording today. Buy it without hesitation if you're already a fan or, if uninitiated, treat yourself to a truly amazing band that deserves to be heard. This review is for the CD release which I pre-ordered from the band's web site.<br /><br />Edit: After three more days of solid listening English Electric Pt. 2 has now become my favorite Big Big Train recording. As when David Longdon and Dave Gregory came into the fold, the addition of multi-instrumentalist Danny Manners to the band and the contributions of Rachel Hall on violin have once again enabled this band to achieve new heights unparalled in the world of contempory progressive music (imho), with \\"Curator Of Butterflies\\" perhaps being one of the most beautiful songs I have heard, regardless of genre, in a long while. Wow.

1932735410|4.0|After first reading the Head First PMP, I ordered Rita. Felt I needed another resource to explore some of the concepts deeper, mainly because I'm new to project management and don't have the experience it seems some people have going into the PMP. This was the perfect book for what I needed. I found all the exam tips extremely helpful, as well as the quizzes at the end of each chapter. I played the process game a bunch of times and did all of the other exercises.<br /><br />My only criticism is similar to what others reported - the material is very dry. The chapters seemed to drag on at times and were challenging to get through. I also thought the language/tone was condescending at times which was actually more amusing than upsetting. Just beware that this is a dry read but it's important to read it all. Another minor thing is there were terms on the exam that were not covered in Rita. Not many, but definitely a few. I don't have any recommendations for avoiding this, but just be aware that this book shouldn't be your one and only resource for studying for the PMP.<br /><br />A bit about my PMP journey ... I took and passed it in early February. I started studying immediately after Christmas 2012 and studied diligently through January. For the first few weeks I was reading Rita and Head First for a few hours a night. Closer to the exam I spent chunks of time on weekends taking practice exams. On the day of the exam I felt prepared, but I also felt burned out and at max capacity in terms of learning new information. If you're putting yourself on a rigid study schedule like mine, I wouldn't suggest extending your study time much more than 6 weeks. I mentioned practice exams above - I took about every free exam I could find on the Internet and believe this was absolutely critical in helping me pass. Although none of the exams seem to simulate the real deal perfectly, it really helped me see where my deficiencies were. Then I'd revisit Rita to reinforce what I'd gottenincorrect.<br /><br />Overall, this is one of several excellent resources I'd recommend.

B007UW9WOQ|5.0|This has been one of my favorite documentaries of the past few years.  I was looking forward to it before I bought it and was quite happy after viewing it.  I have a fascination with monomania in individuals.  While often a theme in both literature (Moby Dick) and cinema (almost every revenge film) it is interesting to see it in a real life scenario and put to good use.  I read some complaints about Jiro's work ethic and how it affects his family, but I think it is something to be admired.  Here is someone whose parents left him at an early age and was forced to find work at the age of 9.  He is still bitter about it and this can be seen when he is visiting his parents' grave and he mentions it a few times as well.  But the fact that he rose from poverty, eventually became rich (this would happen after the sons were born; they have several stories that go over how poor they were) and taught his sons a craft which they both excel at is something to admire.  In fact he states he was extra hard on his sons in teaching them the craft of sushi and this is coming from a man who makes his apprentices spend weeks learning to properly wring a towel (this reminds me of the story of John Wooden who would make all new recruits to UCLA relearn to tie their shoes).<br /><br />Jiro Ono is an 85 year-old  shokunin and the owner of Sukiyabashi Jiro a ten seat sushi restaurant located in a Tokyo subway station, where you have to make a reservation a month in advance and was the first sushi restaurant to be given a three-star Michelin Guide rating (though it is not the only one, Mizutani who was an apprentice of Jiro and appears in this documentary also obtained one for his restaurant Sushi Mizutani; Mizutani's personality is quite interesting as well as he is completely frank about everything).  His eldest son Yoshikazu is waiting to take establishment of the restaurant while his youngest son Takashi is in charge of a similar restaurant (I am not sure if he owns it or his father Jirodoes, the father makes it sound like it is his sons; this restaurant has a two-star Michelin Guide rating).  The film poses the question what will happen if Mizutani takes over, but also gives us the information that he was the chef every time Michelin came over to rate the establishment.<br /><br />You learn so much about high-end sushi in this documentary with much information coming from food critic and unabashed Jiro fan Masuhiro Yamamoto.  I am certainly curious on the restaurants portrayed here, though I do not know if I could spend so much for one meal - especially Jiro's where you are about done in 15 to 20 minutes making it one of the most expensive meals in the world.  I have had decent sushi in my life and the one aspect it changed for me was that I know have trouble eating the majority of mediocre sushi out there.  But one very important aspect that is mentioned time and time again in this film is the quality of your vendors.  You get to meet a motley crew of very unique individuals who have the same exact standards for their profession as Jiro does.<br /><br />Warning, if you like sea creatures you might want to skip this.  The suffocating of the octopus is the one I have read the most complaints on.  Some of the extras are even more graphic in their slow demise, especially one procedure which make a fish brain dead, but keeps its body alive.<br /><br />The commentary by Director David Gelb and Editor Brandon Driscoll-Luttringer is worth listening to though you get the feeling that Gelb is much more knowledgeable about sushi and pretty much everything else in the film in his full feature cinematic debut.  If I remember correctly, I do not think Brandon had even tried sushi by the time of the commentary.  Gelb stated that some of the cinematography was directed influenced by The Fog of War.  The additional extras (deleted scenes and a Masters section which goes over in more detail each of the vendors shown in the film) certainly help understanding not only Jiro but pretty much everyone else in the documentary as well.  Jiro's wife however is not shown, not that the director did not try as mentioned in the commentary, but he did not state the reason(s) why she does not appear.  The extras also make Jiro appear more human than the stolid portrait that is shown in the film.  Did you know he is considered an excellent bowler?
B005GFPZYK|5.0|When the poop hits the fan, which side do you want to be on?  I want to be on Chris's side.  The side doing the giving and not the receiving.  Great reading and I really love the added perspective of taya.  I bought the book after Chris's death.  Such a loss.  There are lots of us who have faced our demons by ourselves, not wanting family or church to know what we may have been capable of doing many years ago.  Some of us have somewhat succeeded while many have lost themselves in a bottle, a weed patch or a barrel in the mouth.  God bless America and the men and women who have lost their lives, a part of their body or some of their sanity in defending us and our country.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|Great game for Sudoku fans.  Plenty of levels and games.  I just want to know why there is a minimum number of words required for feed back?
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I've found this game hard to put down. Helps hand-eye coordination for sure too. I would wish the horses could interact, and would gladly pay to get rid of the ads, but all in all a fun game.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was an easy read and definitely entertaining. I found it hard to put down at times. I was slightly disappointed with the ending but not enough to not recommend the book.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|This story is well written as only Nicholas Sparks writes. A true love story. One like every woman would want ,a soul mate.
0670026603|5.0|This was my choice for book club, and everyone loved it.  That's a first.  The characters are very compelling.  I can't really summarize the story without giving something away.  Not only were we emotionally invested in this book, but we also learned a lot about an interesting legal/moral issue.  As you read the book description,do not be put off and think it will be too depressing.  Beautifully written, great plot.
B000T9OP7G|1.0|I opened the box and there was only the 3rd disk inside.  I don't mean there were two slots empty, I mean there was only a slot for a single disk inside.  Anyone else had this happen?
B009E9R1IM|5.0|EXCELENTE PRODUCTO Y RÁPIDA ENTREGA TOMANDO EN CUENTA LA DISTANCIA EN LA QUE ME ENCUENTRO. MUCHAS GRACIAS<br />ALEJANDRO ABT .
B00969PR18|1.0|NOT ACURATE. I am living in china and tried to use it just to try it out. But it said I was in New York
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I purchased this game for my daughter. After playing it for a few days I begin finding notices of coin and acorn purchases on my credit card. This game will allow your child (or you) to purchase these items extremely easy. That's not the worst part, we have had nothing but trouble out of this game. Sometime during your game play, you will get an update notification....download the update and your game will no longer open! We have been in contact with Gameloft ever since this happened and we finally got it to open but now we are back at the beginning of the game and my daughter has lost everything she had won and charged to my credit card! I have, again, emailed Gameloft to ask them what they are going to do about this....I am still waiting on a response!<br />Update....After several emails and about a month of waiting, Gameloft finally sent my daughter 1300 acorns. I have to say that they did make it right, but not until after I told them I was going to file a complaint with Visa and Amazon. Now that they have sent this last update and the acorn \\"gift\\" (that I had already paid for) the game seems to be doing very well. I haven't heard my daughter complain about anything while playing the game. I would recommend the game only if you are very careful to put a block on your device or your child will have a great time spending your money! It's VERY easy to do! Overall, after all the problems and frustration, the game is a good one.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Absorbing but didn't save my progress in the bonus chapter.  I'm a hidden object game addict and g5 makes some good ones. The dialogue gets annoying at times but it does serve to move the story along.  The puzzles were fun, not too challenging.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|AMAZING book. I couldn't put it down and finished it in just a few days. If you love romance with a little drama you'll love this.
0123694965|5.0|Approached from a more philosophical and what-makes-people-tick perspective, this book provides outstanding insight into why some games work and others should be banished from the face of the Earth. The book is written in a general enough way that it could apply to any type of game (computer/video, board, card, playground, etc.) but it is clearly aimed at the interactive, high-tech entertainment experience. The writing is very conversational-- this is not a book on &#34;how to&#34; make games, but more a book on everything to consider before and during the design and making process. It's very practical in giving useful understanding of the development process (the stages a design goes through, iterations of tuning and balancing, etc.) without sinking into technological specifics. If you love video games, in particular, you might enjoy reading this book just for the sheer pleasure of it (without any aim to applying an of it)-- but it's been the most useful education I've had in the magic that leads to some of my favorite games, as well as insight into why I hate certain games that seem like I should love them.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It was free for the first chapter then you pay. Filled in a few hours, nice graphics but it just seemed to come to a very sudden end. The hidden object screen hid some . Of the objects as nd even pinching didn't help. I suppose for a couple if quid not too bad
B000B8QEZG|5.0|The vinyl is PINK !!!! Awesome and crystal clear sound !
B005J9ZE5I|5.0|The movie itself is always a winner, but the blu-ray really revealed limits of the source media (some of the coloring was different from the DVD too)
B003DZX3SA|5.0|the movie was in brand new condition in original wrap as well. It had 2 discs which is always nice to have added features.
B0067EKY7M|5.0|Great movie with Ewan Mcgregor.It a romantic movie that involve salmon and two men .it is partly set in the yemen
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I found this game by happy accident. With three ways to play I could spend all day playing. The hardest part is to put it down.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love the game it's a little addictive can't seem to put it down at times having trouble getting to 250,000 points
B00APJLFEG|5.0|My kids consistently want to rent/watch this one. We are going to buy it soon. It's a funny but touching story!
1616550414|5.0|What can I say about this that all the other reviewers haven't?<br /><br />It's simply a very amazing book besides the information on the Skyward Sword and detailed information on the other Zelda games the Skyward Sword manga at the end was very interesting as well as all of the concept art, trivia, and more. It was definitely a lot more than I originally expected to come in this book. Definitely a must have for any Legend of Zelda fan out there.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie has everything! The action is amazing! The cast is awesome and the story is very close to the comics!
B004GYY714|2.0|The local radio I chose was not what the app played. I could not get it to play the station I wanted.
B009SQRL4U|2.0|The writers and animators tried too hard with this one. My kids did not sit still through this one so that is a not good indicator.
0553386794|5.0|I bought this as a birthday present for my boyfriend (as we're both really into the tv show) because he wanted to start reading the books.<br />He loved it! I shipped it internationally and it got there 3 days before the estimated time.
B00APUQT7I|4.0|As far as the series goes, this one was not the most entertaining. However it is enough to keep the kids sitting still.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was by far my favorite Nicholas Sparks book. It was well written around love, abuse, suspense, and escape with a huge twist in the end. I did see the movie as well and between both of them, the book took the cake!!
B008J34466|5.0|I had no idea what I was buying but I felt the ''title'' was appropriate for a recent break up!
B001DJLD1M|5.0|Worth every penny spent. Disc and packaging is good and looks great on the shelf along with other movie collections.
B004VSTP4Y|4.0|I like the finale of Mercy Falls wolves.  I really ended up being swept up in their world.  I love Sam and Grace, Isabel and Cole kept be laughing....would have liked it to end differently.
0385523912|5.0|Lately, I've been very curious about places like Cuba, Iran, Iraqi Kurdistan, and North Korea.  If the US issues a travel warning about a particular region, my interest is piqued.  Since I wouldn't actually get on a plane and go to these places, I read about them and use my vivid imagination instead.  I am fascinated that some (if not most) North Korean people actually live and breathe and devour whatever lies the &#34;Dear Leader&#34; feeds them, no matter how ridiculous they are.  Try to imagine a cult without the religious aspect.  Throughout the book, I envisioned one great big gaggle of brainwashed, vacant-eyed people ready to drink the Kool Aid.  Those North Koreans that see through the lies and propaganda have three choices:  Speak up and face serious and sometimes deadly consequences, suffer in silence and fear, or flee the country and hope nobody catches them.<br /><br />This book will make you want to both laugh at the absurdity and cry for the suffering.  It's intriguing.  When I was getting my nails done by my South Korean manicurist, I was asking her all kinds of questions about Korean politics, the plight of the Northerners that flee to the South, and if the DMZ erected after the Korean War separated her from any of her family members.  After a while, she laughed and told me that I asked too many questions.<br /><br />As much as I complain about my country, I read books like this and realize that I don't have it so bad.  I have food on my table, access to decent healthcare, warm clothes, and a job that pays me with money I can spend on necessities, not a ration card that I can exchange for a few cups of corn meal.  I can wear what I want, say what I want, and read what I want.  The simple things that we take for granted like internet and cell phones and freedom to travel are a rarity and luxury afforded only to very select members of the North Korean communist elite.  After the USSR collapsed, the communist &#34;paradise&#34; of North Korea turned froma tepid purgatory to a flat out fiery hell.  People over there are starving, yet Pyongyang would rather build rockets with outdated technology than provide food and medical care to its dying citizens.  I hope, for the sake of the citizens of North Korea, the regime falls and the two Koreas can reunite and prosper.  Wishful thinking, I know.
B002JWD6AS|4.0|You'll keep turning the pages and wanting more.  Keeps you guessing. Interesting how the mind of the wolves work. Interesting.
B00BESNKB8|4.0|RZA did a good job of creating an amalgamation of old school Kung Fu movies and hip hop.  Love the way it looked and felt like the old Kung Fu movies I grew up watching, though a little weird to see people actually speaking English.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|I really liked part 2 of the Mercy falls wolves.  Dont want to give much away, but i'm cheering for Sam to change!
B003QSEKTU|3.0|netflix doesnt have and i was just rewatching through all three because i was bored one day at work, boo
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What can I say.  Its a true page turner.  The movie is pretty on point to me but the book takes you to another place.  I have read them all twice, will probably read them again..Team Katniss all the way!!
B00APUYWYA|5.0|i liked the movie saw clips on youtube which made me rent it and watch the whole thing and i would recommend this movie
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Right amount of suspense, I just hope it doesn't get too soap operaish, or unbelievable like Lost did. I reccomend.
1401322336|5.0|The recipes are easy and delicious. The explanation is so clear that there is almost no chance of getting it wrong. Also, the book is beautifully illustrated.
B000N5F6OW|5.0|There are no bad guys or bloody conflicts - just a simple, fun, and family friendly story. Most of the acting is brilliant (and even where it's not, it's still not bad), and it's fun to see the characters interacting on screen. The action sequences capturing animals are exciting (though perhaps a bit long at times), and the scenery is amazing. Overall, this movie is a great way to spend an evening.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|This isnt what I had in mind. I wish I would of read the reviews. Glad it was expensive. Next time I will look
B005OZE9SA|5.0|Running an AT2035 sounds great, very easy to use. Great price, has greatly improved my sound. Would recommend this for voiceover.
B004JQN364|5.0|This is a amazing detailed toy. The jaw opens up and closes and the weapons can come off if you want too. I wouldn't call this a &#34;toy&#34; but a collectible figurine. The size is good and it is well built.<br /><br />Highly recommended if you like items like these.
B009JZVT70|5.0|Well-written and full of suspense and multiple twists, this series keeps me sitting on the edge of my seat every time. The actors bring full commitment and believability to this fantasy, making you understand exactly why they make every choice they do.
B004SEUJN2|5.0|I love these blu ray books, they look fresh on my shelf and are filled with great info and trivia on the production of the movies, a film buffs dream.  If you like this film, you'll love this edition.
0062082353|4.0|Factual story of a magnificent man who served our country so well.  Funny segments of his life mixed with the tension and adrinaline of the sniper's nest.<br />This man is tuely a hero.  Interesting that he knew Marcus Lutrell (The Lone Surviver). I like both of them - Kyle's book in more genuine.
B004SEUJKU|5.0|I love these blu ray book editions, they are filled with info and trivia on the production of the film.  The terminator gets this treatment and rightly so, a landmark film in the realm of action, sci-fi, and horror.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Hahahahahaha,heheheheheheh,hihihihihihihihihi,hohohohohohoho.huhuhuhuhuhuhu... YOU GET IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH.<br />For crazy comedy around the year of my high school graduation. Thank again.
B004LWZW6U|2.0|Piranha 3DD is not a great movies, it's filled with terrible acting and cliche characters with predictable outcomes, but that's not why I'm writing this review.  I'm writing it because I've recent become transfixed with 3D technology and felt that there are not enough reviews out there on the specs of the 3D specifically.<br /><br />With that being said, I noticed immediately that this movie is designed for 3D televisions that use polarized lenses and passive 3D technology.  Unfortunately for those of us with active shutter lenses, the 3D effects are filled with massive amounts of ghosting, especially those moments that are meant to pop out of the screen.  Less depth perception and tons of goofy items flying toward the screen.  I bet these look great on a passive 3D tv, but on an active shutter they boggled my eyes and mind and made it hard to continue watching.. the terrible plot didn't help either.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I love them type of games. G5 always has great hidden object games. Never disappointed by the graphics and they are always challenging.
B001YV502C|5.0|One of the things that makes this movie so scary is how the direction we are currently heading in today will almost absolutely result in the world portrayed in this movie.<br /><br />In this film, women of the world are no longer able to give birth, mankind is on the brink of extinction, politically the world is in turmoil, refugees are struggling to force their way into the one remaining utopia, London.  Suddenly, a light at the end of the tunnel appears and a glimmer of hope arrives.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Hilarious and very entertaining! Good for kids of all age levels! I think Jeff Kinney is à great author! Read his others! You'll love those too!
B002QFYJF4|5.0|Magnolia needs the blu ray book treatment, but until others recognize the genius of Paul Thomas Anderson, I'll be alone in this thought.  This film changed my life, it is filled with ideas and stories and scenarios that you will most likely relate to yourself, at least with one of them, but this filmmaker masterfully crafts these multiple stories and characters and never leaves any of them hanging, they all have their voice heard and will have you discovering meaning with each additional viewing.
0062238868|5.0|Great book, would recommend it to anyone.. I am Appreciative that he would write about his experience so everyone can get a glimpse of what it is really like to serve..
B000Q67876|5.0|Film buffs know that this is a movie that comes along maybe once a decade, if that.  It's magical, comprehensive, filled with subplots that all add to the greater story even during the final scene of the film.  A movie that will fill you with hope and joy, and make you cry, not from sadness but from happiness.  Truly a joy, Frank Darabont clearly loves the subject material as do the actors portraying the characters that Stephen King first brought to life with his short novella.  A film that can be viewed multiple times, and given the blu ray treatment, looks fantastic and the book gives it the love and attention it deserves with full color photos of the filmmakers and trivia and information on the production of this one of a kind movie.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Had no expectations going into the first listen and was pleasantly surprised. Not a clunker on here. Pick it up.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|A great hidden objects game with enough added puzzles to keep it interesting, spooky locations and eerie music add to the effect.
0439023483|5.0|I heard they were very good books. And believe me they are. You can't put the book down once you start.
0062082353|5.0|Kyle actually taught me plenty about guns and scopes in this book along with his great life story. Only halfway through and can't put it down. This was a real down home good guy and one tough SEAL.
0439023491|5.0|If you read the first one you MUST read the second one. The first one leaves you hanging. The second one is a very good book.
B00005O5CM|5.0|I'm not wild about Resse Witherspoon, but she does an outstanding job<br />in this musical and has made me a new fan of hers.
0439023513|5.0|The first two books are the best but this one keeps you reading till the end. But it is a very good book too.
B0000X61VE|5.0|Cindy and Radu help to work us out...great video, great production, great experiences!  Cindy keeps you motivated and on the right track!
1400069289|5.0|There are few books that can be applied to business and personal life. Excellent book. I'm buying several to give to friends and business colleagues.
B0099Y2MYK|4.0|Knowing the fate of two major characters nearly spoiled the third season of Downton. The lag in time between the British Season 3 airing and the American airing lead to numerous spoilers all over the web. It was impossible to avoid knowing what was in store for the viewer.
B000F8O35U|5.0|Ordered for my niece.  She loves this movie, movie has great color, and the sound is great for the music and songs, same great quality picture!!
1423124111|5.0|As a designer and Disney fan, this book offers a wonderful tour of some of the best Disney Parks poster designs.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I fixated on Denzil Washington playing the main part in a movie and that helped me enjoy the book even more.
B009PU2KIQ|4.0|Not sure there's a bad song on this album. Gary Clark Jr. is a really talented singer and guitar player.  I think if I had to pick a favorite song it would have to be Bright Lights Big City. Got a good blues sound to it.
B0061QD82E|5.0|I loved this movie as a kid, but wasn't sure how interested my little ones would be in it.  But I decided to get it after my sister talked about how much her kids love it! And I am so glad I did, my kids love it too.  I remember as a kid this movie being sort of \\"grey,\\" but the restoration is beautiful and it is definitely full of color now, and the backgrounds and colors are beautiful.  As a kid, I loved this movie because I have always loved dogs.  Now, as an adult, I enjoy this movie because:<br />-the beginning is so adorable, when Lady is a puppy and gets lonely and climbs the stairs.  And the owners are funny \\"if we are going to show her who's master we must start from the very beginning.\\"<br />-the love story is cute, and the spaghetti scene so iconic (and my picky eaters will all eat spaghetti now)<br />-anyone who has a dog, and then had a baby will find it interesting to see the goings-on from Lady's perspective.  The scene when Darling says \\"No, Lady, no walk today\\" is too familiar!<br />-the movie takes place in an interesting time period, early 1900's, with some cars, some horse and buggies, the end of the Victorian era? kind of neat.<br />-this movie definitely shows the difference between dog people -\\"Lady's trying to tell us something!\\" and non-dog people (or cat people) -\\"That animal's loose!\\"  And let's face it, I could totally see a restaurant owner giving two dogs a spaghetti dinner.  people even give their dogs weddings nowadays.<br />-growing up we had a dog with a sweet personality like Lady, but now we have a little terrier, much like the Tramp!  And I can tell you if our dog wanted to run away i don't know how anyone would be able to catch her.  And chasing chickens...a terrier wouldn't be able to resist it! it's all about the chase.  fun to watch.<br />-and if your kids are going to watch tv, it is better for the younger ones to watch things that have a slower pace, like Thomas the Train, or older movies like this, without so much crazinessand over-stimulation.<br /><br />I still love this movie, maybe even more than I did as a kid.  And my little ones love it too!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like it a lot. it is fun. I hope that other people will like it too. it is very very fun
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Weird.  Talk about making you having to read the next book.  Not my style of book, but I read it with my girlfriend so it wasnt all that bad.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Had so much fun reading this to my nephews as their bedtime story!! I can't believe I didn't read this when I was younger!!
1451695195|5.0|If you are still in daubt that there is Life after we depart from this planet, read this book. It changed my life!
B00B2PHSIY|5.0|... As long as you're not near the surface.  Above 10-15ft and it causes everything to wash out red (no surprise really).  Easily snaps on and off, even while underwater. Clips on securely, I don't think it could ever come off by accident. It comes in a nice little bag to protect against scratches.
1402786360|5.0|I love this book. Heather's creations are not just baked goods, but beautiful works of art. Having this book around is not just a source of inspiration in baking but in all forms of art. The skill and vision in her creations is outstanding!...not to mention absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this book to everyone. She is like the REAL Martha Stewart, except with an amazing artistic ability. Her recipes and directions are detailed and preciously explained. This is by far my favorite baking book (and I have quite a lot due to this baking addiction). I seriously can not recommend this book enough.
B00127RAJY|1.0|I am in decent shape, in my twenties, have had no prior knee injuries and I think this DVD is awful on the joints, especially the knees.  Also, Jillian stops to comment and correct and I find it very irritating and stop because I think the reps are done with.  Also, it seems like you are encouraged to do this every day for thirty days and I think I was experiencing injuries from it.  Use The Firm or Jackie Warner circuit training instead.
1608955702|5.0|As a professional photographer, I was fortunate enough to learn first-hand from Neil during a workshop at the beginning of my pro career. This book is every bit as good as learning from the master in person!<br /><br />Full of useful information on topics ranging from the basics of light quality to the advanced use of multiple off-camera flash, this book is a perfect resource for beginners who want to raise their skill level. It also solidly meets the need of the professional, by providing insight into the technical details of the example images. Using 'bad' shots and 'good' shots to illustrate the content AND providing the technical specifications are great bonuses for the reader.<br /><br />Using the same relaxed, informative and detail-oriented approach he uses in his workshops, Neil has created a 'must-have' resource for photographers of all levels. He provides theory and backs it up with real-world examples, created in all sort of environments and situations, perfect for the working photographer.<br /><br />Despite having lots of lighting gear in my arsenal, what I most appreciated about this book was that Neil provides ample instruction and relevant examples for working with only natural light. By teaching the reader how to \\"see\\" light and use it to create technically sound (and beautiful) images, Neil shows us that you don't have to have an excess of equipment to make great images.<br /><br />With informative content, logically ordered topics and superb example images this book should be required reading for everyone who calls themselves a photographer.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was a fan of John Green after reading Looking for Alaska. I decided to try out this book and I immediately fell in love with the story. I highly recommend this book as well as all of his other books.
B007HOGU3I|5.0|I was looking for this movie amazon is the only place to get it no bad thing about it in good shape thnks a lot

B0063M22QO|5.0|This version is very easy to use.  No surprises in the layouts, but it's still quite enjoyable.  I've been looking for a Mahjong app and am completely satisfied with this one.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Great read highly would recommend to my friends family and co workers.  Ready to start the others<br />Can't wait for a movie

B009J3K4MI|5.0|See the review by gimlet. That says it all.  You can't go wrong with this collection. And at two dollars a disc you can afford a few you don't care for. :-).  .
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think I got 10 people and their kids addicted to this game.  Everyone who tries it won't give me back my kindle.  It is a lot of fun.  Get it
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I am one of those people who doesn't subscribe to HBO or Showtime. It's too expensive, and there aren't that many things on it that I care to watch. HBO has made it pretty impossible to watch Game of Thrones without buying a monthly subscription. For this reason, I have chosen to wait until the complete season comes out as a DVD set and then buy the complete set. The downside is that I have to wait an entire year before getting to watch this amazing show. The upside is that the product is beautifully packaged and if you love the show, it becomes a valuable addition to your library.  Season Two was worth the long wait. I am also getting ready to rewatch Season 1, because Game of Thrones is not a story that you will want to read or watch only once. I was able to purchase Season Two from Amazon for 29.95, which is about the price of two months of an HBO subscription. I'll miss getting to see Season 3, when it starts this month, but I feel okay with waiting until I can add Season 3 to my library.
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|OMG -This game is off the meat-rack. Too much fun. I've only been playing it for thirty minutes and I can't stop busting out laughing. This game will have you on the floor cracking up laughing. Some games are challenging, enlightening, etc. This one is simply straight up, stupid, silly, goofy, laugh-out-loud, fun. There's like no other purpose for this game. Just fun. This kind of game you love playing whether you win or lose. If you're in a bad mood, play this game. This is the kind of game you don't even want to win because you don't want it to end. This game is straight up ignorant fun, a feel good, cheer up,  smile maker.
B008RV5K5E|5.0|So I have been watching DC Animated shows since Batman:TAS. My favorite movie is still Mask of the Phantasm. The one that I thought was the best for Batman was Under the Red Hood until now. While watching The Dark Knight Returns: Part 1 I have been on the edge of my seat, grinning and having a great time. This is one of the best DCAU movies. I haven't watched Part 2 yet though.<br /><br />I remember when they did an episode of Batman:TAS that had a small part of this story in it. (Legends of the Dark Knight I think) This is that part on steriods, same visual style, the same pointy nipples on the mutant boss but with more brutality. Incredible. Dark. Intense.<br /><br />I really appreciate these DCAU direct to video releases, I hope they keep up the great work.
B008220DIC|1.0|I had great expectations for this one.  It had great performances from a very talented crew.  Fantastic cinematography.  But the movie had zero plot.  It seemed to be a long very boring movie about Scientology and an attempt to show it for the sham it is, but it had no story line, no cohesion.  In a year of Argo, Django, Lincoln, Skyfall it is hard to compete when you don't have a plot. We watched it and I sold it the same night on eBay.
B00A2LOAKI|5.0|I tried a simple, one word review that said it all. Wow.<br /><br />I watched this directly after seeing Part 1 thinking that there was no way they could top it. They did. Batman, in an animated form, finally dealt with Joker in an appropriate manner. I know that there have always been restrictions to TAS because of their timeslot and the audience they were targeting. Now that those of us who watched it while growing up are grown up, these direct to video releases can be more  true to some of the stories that we have read in Graphic Novels. This one is PG-13 and I think they toed that line pretty well.<br /><br />Thanks again to Bruce Timm, Andrea Romano and the whole DC Animated team for giving us such great productions.
B0087YPCYA|2.0|I didnt like it as much as the first one. The plot was dumb and the actors were pretty horrible.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|I'm sorry to say after looking forward to this movie for several months, when I did get to watch it, it was really much too dry for my taste.<br /><br />Although well-acted, it just did not absorb or entertain me.
B00BHNR1KQ|4.0|Good horror movie, I like the story and it was a great ending. Looks like a part 2 is on the way.
B002ZG997M|5.0|Raw.  Emotional.  Terrifyingly realistic.  Not knowing what happened to this world leaves you curious, but what happened to this man makes you stick with it!  Touching and shocking, this movie will leave your heart pounding.
1616550414|5.0|The book is huge with tons of information about everything Zelda! The pages are glossy and strong and the whole thing is very well made and informative. This book is a must for any self proclaiming Zelda fan, you WILL learn a LOT from  this book and the original art is amazing to look at and read about! This would make a great gift for any video gamer or an amazing addition to your collection!
B000LB7G00|5.0|I bought this to use with Google's SketchUp. Wondering how I used the program without it! The navigator is an awesome addition to 3D work! Highly recommend.
0143118757|5.0|If everyone in the business world read this book every year the world would be a different place.<br /><br />Principled negotiations changes the negotiations process by joining together with the 'other side' to find solutions to problems.<br /><br />my highest respect and regards to the authors, i will be searching out other books they have written.I have been using the principles, and been getting success and i feel calmer, and not like the other side is an adversary.<br /><br />If it is always been a book you have been thinking of reading, do it.  These principles can help love relations, parent- child relationships, as well as business and everything in between. I wish i would have read this in high school.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I have been sharpening knives for decades, ranging from paring knives, chef's knife, jack knife and grafting knife.  I have never used anything with the efficacy, simplicity and speed of Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener. A few draws through the tool and its done. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys well maintained knives.  I only use this, a diamond hone block and a steel honing steel rod: give that drawer full of sharpening gizmos away.
0618918248|5.0|I began reading this book with a relatively open mind towards things, but I do believe I have been pulled closer to the side of atheism. The arguments presented in this book are extremely compelling and powerful, and I have been having a hard time coming up with arguments that can successfully refute what Dawkins brings forth. In general, I had been sitting on the fence on this issue for a long time because I couldn't figure out for sure what I knew, what I believed, and what I wanted to know or believe. This book is a powerful eye-opener for those who are willing to absorb and ponder the arguments Dawkins presents.
0425252868|5.0|as a pilot I was especially interested in this book. How did they ever find a target with out GPS? only a pilot will appreciate this comment. yes flying is a special club and this books shows that although the leaders of nations were at war, the soldiers, sailors and airmen longed for peace and respected the others thrust into the war.<br /><br />War is hell and this book does not romantize the pain, suffering and death associated with war. But it is a great read and you will not be able to put it down!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Excellent book, fast read recommended to friends and given to friend to read. On my Kindle fire, loved it. Thanks
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|So happy to be able to get this!!!  Fun to watch all in a row. Thanks amazon!! xx oo xx oo
B003O86FMW|5.0|sequiel to first book, read fast interesting, recommend to friend gave it to another friend, looking forward to the movie
1433502410|5.0|The maps and introductions for various subjects are very good.<br />The translation is very close the Revised Standard Version and<br />the New American Standard Bible.  It is a very big book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|a good read. only thing better was the movie. Got it on my Kindle fire, fast read and very interesting.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|The Lethal Weapon series is one of the greatest buddy cop franchises in the world. Experienced &#34;by the book&#34; Murtaugh is partnered with psycho professional killer Riggs as they encounter authority threatening crimes and criminals. Riggs gets excited at everything he can and Murtaugh is plagued with a series of embarassing acts. Yet, together they can beat anything. There is nothing out there that can stop Glover and Gibson. The plot for each film is composed of police determination and a group of upper class criminals.<br />This $10 purchase comes with 2 films on each disc. One film on each side. You will need to keep great care of these discs if you are clumsy. Other wise this was a great deal with great quality, languages, and subtitles. Along with nice special features. This is one of those movie series that can't go old.
B007EECSFA|1.0|Boring, boring, boring.  Confusing.  Boring.  Did I say it was boring? To bad I actually paid for this book. Bad.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game.  I have arthritis, so shuffling cards has become difficult.  I use my tablet, so, playing the game is easy on my hands.  Thank you for this app.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|This was my first Corinne CD, and I really enjoy listening to every song on the CD.  very relaxing. I would recommend for those who enjoy jazz and easy listening.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I've read this series a couple times now and I always enjoy it. The relationship isn't perfect but they're able to see past the surface. It's not just a book about a Dom/Sub relationship.
B000SFD21Q|5.0|possibly the best book on the topic of how exercise affects the brain. it is an easy read and very compelling. it gives clear examples of target heart rates based on age, one should be trying to achieve while exercising and what kinds of benefits it will deliver. every where i look i see people who would benefit from reading this book.
B006HL9G10|5.0|Takes less than a minute to create preset timers using simple and intuitive menus. I'll use these long-reverberating bells to give myself a time limit on work tasks. It's easy to edit/overwrite the presets, like adding a different bell at 20 minute intervals to keep track of the time. Hmm, maybe use it for meditation too.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Don't like it. I can't play any of my games with my friends. All I can do is see their post.
B005PTYOTE|5.0|Was looking to complete the set. Now I have them! It is great when you see something that you want, order it and upon arrival is exactly what you wanted
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Very good story. Started off a little slow but got more interesting as I read on.  Once you get into reading the book you just want to continue reading to see what the outcome will be. The only part of the book I did not like is the nativity of Katniss. You would have thought she would have gotten smarter on what was taking place. In the end, she did the right thing.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I could not get enough of this one! I am usually more of a romance novel chic, but this book may have changed my genre! Definite must read!!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Moves fast even w/ all the details very fun and exciting. Kind of crazy ending but the perspective of a DA is incredibly interesting even without a extreme case such as murder
B003O86FMW|4.0|Found myself getting bored towards the end of the book. Thought it was a little dragged out, lost interest but still couldn't not put it down. Have the third one purchased as well so ill see how that goes!!!!
B004G5VFOU|5.0|This is an outstanding recording. I had litened to it long time ago, but this recording is even better and CD 2 is a great surprise, Steve Windwood and did a great job in the performances shown in those live shows.<br />I'd say is highly recommendable.
B007EW9ISM|3.0|The Cosmonaut is very interesting.  On the positive side, it is amazingly smooth - this stylus glides across the glass more smoothly than any other stylus I have tried.  I really can't get over this feature.  On the down side, it is too large for my feminine hand to be comfortable for writing.  People with larger hands or with arthritis may like it a lot but be warned - it is heavy and this makes it difficult to do any fine (small) writing.  For drawing or larger writing it is great.  So some of you reading this may just love it but if you have a small hand or want to use it for tapping apps and keyboards and turning pages you may find it is not sensitive enough and you have to do a lot of repeat taps which gets annoying very quickly.
B0011EU0NG|5.0|Got this movie for my sister as a birthday gift because it was always her favorite movie. Personally, I didn't see where her interest came from but she loved the gift. Would recommend for other kids, DVD played I guess.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|any zep is good zep all day long jimmy page rules dude! man i'm hungry,i wonder if there is any thing to eat
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Fun fun fun  this app is very entertaining and everyone should try it. It is worth the time. I am in my thirties and still playing daily.
0345803507|5.0|I love this book!  I want more!!!  I think I'll read it again...the whole trilogy again and again and again.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I don't know. I just don't think its the best game ever. its pretty good though. but the gems are a bit pricey.
B008BIZ06M|5.0|It's the Offspring from beginning to end,  if you like them you won't be disappointed.<br />This is very consistent with the rest of their music.
B0099Y2MYK|1.0|I only hated it because the first two DVD's would not play on my DVD player, although the 3rd DVD worked fine.  I sent the set back and got a replacement set.  Same problem.  The first two DVDs would not play on my DVD player, only the third would.  I have a neighbor who did not have the problem with their set.  Perhaps they got it from another source, or ? ? ? ? ?<br /><br />I watched the series on TV so got to see the programs, which were superior - only the recorded DVDs weren't.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|I like the small size and extremely light weight of this product. It allows me to add a sharpening system to my every day carry bag. It's nice to be able to touch up my knife or other peoples knives. I've even had people tip me $5 for sharpening their knife for them. This thing has more than paid for itself!
1400067820|5.0|One of the most thought provoking books I have ever read.  I thoroughly enjoyed his discussion of knowledge and the dichotomy of experiential versus theoretical knowledge.  I highly recommend for anyone philosophical like me.
B0058IA8LK|5.0|This is Cohens darkest album as he was in a manic state while recording this master work. The title track is one of his best lyrical works ever. A song about despair and love lost fade into a Death of A Ladies Man.
B00AR1G3FS|4.0|Great video and sound. A must have for all Eagle's fans. I was a little disapointed that it didn't have Seven Bridges Road.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great movie, watched on amazon prime on my Xbox and the quality of the video and audio was great. I would recommend this movie to others
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I grew up in the eighties. I never thought about it before reading Ready Player One, but I now know that I wouldn’t switch it for any other decade. I mean, yes, at times I thought that growing up in cool space-time locations like Ancient Rome or the Age of Discovery would be fun as well, and growing up in the golden age of Sci-Fi would be probably cool, but the eighties had their magic.<br /><br />Ready Player One relives that magic.<br /><br />There are many qualities that a book, film or video game needs to become a classic adventure, and RPO has all of them. It’s absolutely fun. It has a couple of unexpected twists. It takes the hero through a voyage where the beginning and end are well defined, but the road there is completely unexpected.<br /><br />The mix of real and virtual should remind readers of Matrix and other works of fiction where things done in the real life have an effect on the digital life and vice versa. It’s played nicely in RPO.<br /><br />And it’s completely immersive. I mean, from time to time there’s a book that I don’t want to put down because it’s so good, and identify with the characters, but RPO takes this immersion into the next level. Somehow it felt different; like playing a good game. Whenever putting down my Kindle I felt like I’m logging out of the game, so I can go on with my real life, and then I knew that whenever I’ll pick the Kindle up again the hero will be there, waiting for me. And at the end, not only did I feel the emptiness of ‘no, I can’t believe this book is over’, but I actually felt like there’s nothing else for the hero to do inside the book as well. As if his mission, once completed, coincided with the completion of my mission of reading the story, and we’re both at a loss.<br /><br />The book is original, high paced, and highly engaging. The writing could use a few patches, and there are some clichés that could have been avoided, but I’d given it 6 if there were enough stars just forcapturing the essence of my childhood that well.<br /><br />It’s a must read. An experience everyone should go through. And those lucky enough to be born in the 70’s and grow up in the 80’s will have double the fun.
B006TF6WAM|4.0|An intriguing insight into a difficult relationship. Harold sets out to walk the length of England with no preparation or plan, and all his consequent problems used as metaphors for his marriage.
B00B4VI8MQ|2.0|Not sure yet....<br />I have (so far) only played the free portion of this game. I have to say at this point it is my least favorite G5 game I have played. I usually like them quite a lot. However the jury is still out on this one. I'm not even sure if I want to spend the $2.99 to open the remainder. This game seems disjointed and confusing to me. Not even the suspense of how the story ends is of interest enough for me to decide. This is a first. I will enter another review if I end up continuing on.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Yeah it's kind of fluffy and predictable but I enjoyed reading it. You can't always read serious things, sometimes you just need to have some fun. This was that for me.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|This game is really fun my favorite on on my kindle fire and all of you who haven't played it get the app already and  start playing it
0062082353|5.0|I enjoyed this book cover to cover. Chris Kyle in his autobiography discusses his missions his family and his feelings of everything he went through. You get a sense of what this wonderful man is about.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|A little slow at times but shows a dark side in the baseball of the past. I recommend it for readers of all ages
B0020MKTOS|5.0|I have this, bought it as a gift for my father in law. Good action move, I like the full screen edition the best
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app best app ever!I can not stop playing minecraft poket Edition!I can see why it number 1paid<br />app!it is worth the $6.99.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I received The Forever Girl in return for a honest review as part of the tour hosted by Dark World Books. Sophia is a wiccan which in her rocky mountain hometown makes her different. So of course when mystical things happen she's the first one questioned.  However it's not till she casts a positive energy spell that her life starts to spiral out of control. Suddenly Sophia can hear strange voices in her head. She's finding out her best friend is an elemental and that vampires are supposed to protect the humans but it's not working that way. She's even caught the attention of a vampire who's taken an interest in her and not in a good way.<br /><br />Sophia is thrust into a world she doesn't know existed with her friends and the new half breed stranger to help her. Together they will fight against the council, testing all of them even forcing Sophia to use the dark magic she's spent her whole life avoiding. Thankfully she's not going at it alone, she has the man she loves and her best friend but is that enough?<br /><br />I've been seeing The Forever Girl for a while before happening across a tour. I love the cover it's one of my favorites. I found the story well written it flows along from start to finish creating a captivating world filled with mystery and intrigue. I think the author does a fantastic job of creating a world that Sophia is living in filled with paranormal beings. She also creates a unique story about vampires which I really enjoyed.  The Forever Girl is filled with twists that keep the reader guessing. Sophia for me was easy to connect with she's one of those characters you can't help cheering for till the very end. She's a strong character which is what I tend to look for. It's a great start to a series that stole my heart and ended up being one of my new favorites. I'm looking forward to more books in the series.
B008NEMN0K|4.0|Nice special effects, good movie, this was one of the first things that had &#34;i&#34; attached to it and didn't involve Apple.
B009VLX8FS|2.0|Not Taylor's best work; I only bought it because it was cheap, and I wish I hadn't.  Not a song on it I really like.
B006JSXYPA|4.0|Good movie, wasn't to thrilled about Megatron not having a bigger part, but it held its on. Love the 3D effects.
0345803485|5.0|*For Mature Audiences Only*<br /><br />Ok, I'm just gone get right to it. This book, in MY opinion, is NOT a sex book. A sex book is when 90% of the book is all sex scenes. That's not 50 Shades. While several scenes in the book are graphic, the storyline overshadows them. This is a book of a love story between 2 people who are as different from each other as night and day. I feel the storyline overshadows the sex scenes because I found myself more intrigued with the characters actions, not the characters activities. Again, this book is for MATURE AUDIENCES ONLY and I would not recommend it to anyone otherwise because there is something to be seen past the sex scenes. It was definitely a page turner and I will be purchasing book 2 and 3 this weekend. Each is own but I loved it!
B001O1O71C|5.0|My daughter needed this book for school.  It is a great book.  The price and experience were a great one.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Channing Tatum is awesome. I have most of his movies he is such a great actor not to mention a very handsome actor
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|Maybe it was me but i really couldn't figure out what i was suppose to do, all i was able to do was pretty much walk back and forth.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|very very very good movie. I am always hesitant in remakes of the original episodes of films but with Channing Tatum it was well worth watching
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Left me unable to put down the book, but I can't wait to read another of his novels now. The plot was honestly unpredictable, I didn't see the ending coming. I'm left speechless but believing there is true love meant for everyone, if you are strong enough to look
B005LAIHR2|2.0|This was a very disappointed movie I couldn't keep any type of interest in it. It could have been written better
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book. Especially the ending. I think that everybody should read this book. It is amazing.I can't wait to watch the movie.
B004E9UB8O|3.0|Although I won't be making any of these, I enjoyed looking at the patterns.  Very clever and original pieces.  A plus.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved this book so much lat want to read it again and again. I wish that I could tell so parts because that would be cheating. But I would recommend this book and there are movies. Which are the best. I recommend hunger games.
B000001G1E|5.0|So great is James Brown's impact that even the 4 cd Star Time isn't quite comprehensive - between 1956 - 1988, Brown placed 100 singles on the R&B Top 40 charts
0061733199|4.0|I have been trying to upgrade our Home Emergency Kit. This &#34;SAS Survival Handbook, For Any Climate, in Any Situation&#34; seemed like a reasonable Kit addition. I have only read part of it and some of the information is good to know, some of it... well, I hope I never need to use it but I am glad to have some understanding about how to cope/survive!
B009IEXKXI|1.0|The author starts with 2 F-bombs on the first page. It is so distracting to me when an author is unable to deliver their concept without foul language that it is almost impossible, for me, to suspend my sense of disbelief. I tried to forge ahead a few pages but I could tell the poor language choices were going to be a pattern throughout the book and I gave it up.<br /><br />So if you are fan of crude language then this may be a good novel, but if you find it offensive and a signal that the author has not developed the skills to deliver the story without it, then avoid at any price.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|We really like this  Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal Multifunction Sharpener! It get lots of use, especially on our serrated kitchen knives.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book let me be able to do everything I needed to do. The simple step by step instructions really helped me not get frustrated in the process of putting my book together. Thank you!
B0002JJBZY|5.0|Excellent, my husband loves it.  The kids watch it together.  It is a beautiful set, well worth the money and quality
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I downloaded the Kindle for my Android tablet, and I love it! It works great, and I will using it a lot!
B008N9AASC|5.0|Ron Fricke takes you to different spots on this planet earth with this Samsara DVD and allows you to see cultures, people of many colors, lifestyle, food production, architecture, cities, monuments and most importantly god's architecture with the beautiful music of Michael Sterns that compliments each segment of the DVD without any dialogue or narration. Colors, colors, colors... Bravo.
B000Y5JFN4|5.0|At first I was mixed on my feeling, as a musician I felt they were making fun of my career but this movie is so true to the &#34;11th&#34; power. Of course they bring it to the extreme but that's ok. I actually saw the band live when they toured after the movie was released and they REALLY play!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It kept me guessing until all the pieces came together so beautifully. I read it twice. Holder is amazing in his sensitivity and insight, especially for an 18-year-old!  Easy to see why this was on the NY Times Best Seller list.
B00881VLCE|1.0|Downloaded and played it a few times.  Never could get it to open again. blah blah blah blah blah blah
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I liked it<br />Try it<br />It might not be for you<br />But , I liked it<br />A lot in fact<br />I recommend it<br />Okay<br />Love always<br />Charlie
B000NTPDSW|5.0|good movies. Like the godfather series. Was a great price.  Awesome quality cause it is done on bluray. Watch it

B0097EWK3A|5.0|This is the best hidden object adventure game that I have played and I am very picky about what I like!
B00B4VI8MQ|1.0|do not download app. I did and it doesn't work at all.  says download failed because of missing rescources. don't waste your time with this lame app.
1604590483|5.0|It's a short read and I suggest you read five times to let it sink in. Very powerful stuff! Highly recommend
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This is terrific.  It certainly is much better than using the eraser on a lead pencil, and it clips inside my Kindle cover.
0783240287|5.0|This movie is a family approriate musical portral of a well known Bible story from the Old Testament. This version is my favorite becasue of Donny Osmond. While it strays a bit from Biblical accuracy for entertainment purposes, it still manages to tell a story that many know and love.
0205313426|5.0|Thank you!! It was what my teacher suggested and so far is helping me write with more style! XD I am happy to have found it!
B0045HCJ6M|5.0|What a fabulous presentation of a story that has it all! Richard Harris protray's King Aurther with such intensity it seems the part was written just for him. This movie is long, but tells the story of Camelot with details not often seen or considered in other versions. BRAVO!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this so much more than one million dollars in this blog is expected to be a great game ever.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|This book continues one's obsession of the battles of power. It also develops a deeper insight into the characters. You never want for this story to end.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is so amazingly fun and addicting. Right now I have been playing for 48 minutes. The daily challenges and missions are fun. The Rome theme is cool. I also like the . Easter eggs.
B0009IW9CK|5.0|Re-release of a great album. Includes bonus track, an acoustic version of &#34;Jackie Brown.&#34; Some of JCM's best work, and my personal favorite. More folk-rock than some of his other albums. Highly recommended!
B008M721MS|5.0|the best video call on line to see my family and friends and to communicate to each others the best
0547884591|5.0|i got this item on time, i love tim ferris and the whole idea of lifestyle design. I am actually reading the 4 hour work week though, recommend you buy that one as well :D
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Washington is extraordinary. The cockpit scenes where he is effortlessly in control are worth the price of the film. The film is actually quite deft and subtle, it is a good drama. I can't think of a more compelling American actor around than DW, he is often overlooked because he doesn't play the Hollywood Game but is, apparently, a decent family man.
B00AYB20KI|4.0|This movie was better than I thought it would be.  Surprising twist at the end that had us rewinding and watching it over!
B002VCR08U|5.0|This book was so sensitively written both to its protaganists and to the subject matter of architecture.  Heartbreaking sad in places.  It shows that life is not always simple and people have tough choices to make.
1439152802|4.0|Fascinating and involved family mystery that keeps one guessing until the final pages.  Well written and thoroughly enjoyable.  Grown children gathered at their dying mother's bedside in 2011, try to discover their mother's secrets which evolved in 1941.  Transitions between '41 and '11 constantly, and gives the reader a taste of living in London during the Blitz, and how families coped then and now.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A series that gets your interest quick and keeps you wanting to see the next episode.  The cast and producers have done an amazing job of acting and bringing early 20th century British upper and lower class relationships.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I'm using it on my Ubuntu 12.04 car computer project with TangoGPS, it works as expected, the signal is better than I thought. It is for outside applications, it does not work indoors.
B00BHMF578|1.0|We gave up after ten minutes.  Amazon did warn us prior to purchase that we might have some issues with the film quality and they were correct.  Colors seemed washed out, the sound fluctuated dramatically, and the picture seemed somewhat out of focus.
B006MR2ZQC|5.0|Our grandson loved his LEGO gift. It arriveThanks ford as advertized and on time for Christmas. Thanks for your efforts.
B009KY0UCK|5.0|Nothing to say about this, really. Brilliant track! And instrumental on the B side. Adele out-did herself here. Way to go!
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Great app! Keeps me on task and I love the extras that come with it such as color coding my task and adding icons to a particular task to personalize it.
B007LYB0PC|5.0|Can't think of a bad song on this album or one that wouldn't fit in with the tone. Fantastic piece of work.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This game is addictive . It has awesome graphics . Great storyline. It's fun and challenging. I couln't stop playing it. It's the best seek &amp; find game I've found.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Sure this is just a rough and ready sharpener but it is small enough to pack with you all of the time.<br />I small steel would be nice to finish the edge up.
037582913X|5.0|This was my son's favorite book growing up and I like to give it as a baby gift to help promote reading and to keep Grover alive in children's hearts.  It is getting difficult to find because of the age of the book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|A book written from death's point of view during the holocaust? What a brilliant concept-a page turner that gives an incredible insight into humanity. The characters are real, likeable and admirable for being themselves; different than society's mold. I found this clever book to be more about our true human selves/souls instead of about merely coping during a destructive era. I recommend this book to all who love to read from the mid-school student to the most educated. If this book doesn't touch one's inner soul....I can't imagine they have much of one.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|simple design. powerful note app. so easy even a child could use. will purchase the full version asap. you should too. so worth it.
B005GFPZYK|3.0|The book is developed, with help from an established writer, by a true American hero.  The exploits described give some sense of meaning to the terrible and frenzied lives led by American troops during the Iraqi war.  Mr Kyle was a navy seal trained as a sniper and deployed four times to Iraq. His skills and bravery emerge in his first hand accounts of the things he saw  and did in prosecuting this terrible war.  The book itself is rough hewn, down to earth telling of events, mostly unpleasant. The language is very rough with no attempt to hold back.  The killing becomes almost flippant as there is little regard for the insurgent Iraqis as people, as human beings.  They are dispatched by Kyle as one might eliminate a bothersome rodent, and he thoroughly enjoyed it. There becomes an area of difficulty in terms of morality, if you read this, you'll have to consider it. I was shocked and troubled as I began reading this book to learn that Kyle, (the author,) was himself murdered in Texas by a former military man whom Kyle was trying to provide with some assistance. That, after all he went through.  A very serious read.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I was playing it on my friend's iPod and I was addicted automatically and I love the game!!!!!!!!! This is a very good game for all ages.
B0076DELIG|4.0|This is another Harry Bosch L.A.P.D. detective story.  It's a good one.  Harry is assigned to work cold cases and draws a twenty year old murder that he recognizes as one that he started working twenty years ago.  Typical of Connolley the book is tightly correct  with the police procedures and solidly written.  A really good read.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I enjoyed the book but had seen the movie first. If you've seen the movie already there isn't much surprise. I did otherwise recommend it as an easy leisurely read.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I am sharing this story with friends who are watching it repeatedly.<br />As soon as one person watches it, they ask if they can pass it on to another friend.
B009186E3O|5.0|A perfect addition to my extensive Stones collection, can't watch it enough!  Long time coming, and well worth the wait.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game no problems. I really like this game. Me and my brother play it all the time. Must Get!!!
B00002N9ER|4.0|The image shows two mounting brackets holding one Maglite. I purchased 2 Maglite's and use one bracket for each with no problems. I really like having them mounted, no more searching for the light when it's needed.
B00BIK3FAI|5.0|i splurged and bought the full version.  Definately worth the money.  Fantastic graphics and cute story.  It kept me entertained at 4AM when I couldn't sleep.  My daughter is going to love this too.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I think this game is awesome !You get to  make your own Jurassic  park and there is all sorts of dinosaurs like a t-rex.you also can put decorations and restaurants /museum and a police station.
B004GYY714|5.0|This app is great for me. I am currently using it to help me study Spanish. It is very useful as I can pick up radio stations from all over Latin America and Spain. The app is easy to use and interface is smooth. 5/5

B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is another outstanding action thriller. Excitement, adventure, twists and satisfying outcome.<br />A quick page turner that keeps you enthralled!
B006OKOZGU|5.0|What can I say about this movie that hasn't been said for the past 58 years. It is one of the best.<br /><br />What I want to say is Blu-ray has made this pure beauty to see. Grace Kelly never looked this BEAUTIFUL. The scenery is absolutely FANTASTIC.<br /><br />This is what we want to see more of. Oldies that are truly restored and presented like never seen before. I can not get enough. Please keep them coming.<br /><br />This one is a MUST HAVE for any serious collection.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I love this app and use it more than any other on my Kindle Fire HD. NOTE: Keep it plugged in though... it's a battery drainer. Best nightstand clock EVER!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Glad I got this app for my kindle fire. Works great and helps me keep in touch with The Lord wherever I go
0380016699|1.0|Bought this because a distant friend was reading it and wanted me to join her.  Skimmed it because while the ideas in it are good they are no longer new or surprising - which is fine, the book was written years ago so it would be unwarranted to expect it to break new ground today.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My kids love this app. They get stuck on it for hours and then I have to come in and take it from them just to get stuck myself
B001HN6EF4|5.0|The age old question was best resolved when I choose this version of UNO over the original paper card set. With two little girls, I wasn't sure if they would be able to hold these cards in their hands, but of course they use their mouths, feet, floor and whatever they can find to help hold this set. The plastic is thin, but not annoying. I'm thankful I purchased this set over the paper card option.
B0052SF6CM|5.0|Who really needs a CD anymore right? Well in my old hoopty I do and I am so glad that I got this one. It helps to pump me up on my drive to the gym.

1926778537|5.0|It's a Joe Madureira Darksiders II art book, how can this not be awesome? Like the first one its full of great concepts, sketches and models, and info.
0425252868|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  This has everything:  WWII history, fighter & bomber history, and simply a great tale.  You could equally empathize w German pilots, who were nothing like the evil SS.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love playing this game with friends and strangers.  I love that it sparks creativity and helps pass the time.
0743435729|4.0|Good Read, Considering no space battles. Think it ties in nicely with the series and an must read to keep on track. Unfortunately this book is currently not available electronically so I had to purchase the hard copy to keep on trak. Sometimes gets a little slow but overall a good read.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|awesome movie my kids loved it and im sure I will buy the dvd soon cute movie for kids !!
B003G4W49C|5.0|My son chose this book for one of his genre's for school.  He enjoyed reading it and was able to write about it in detail.  The book kept him interested until the end.  I would recommend it, especially for those readers who aren't very much into reading - like my son :-)
B00004YZFR|4.0|the product was for a loved one he liked it and watched it immediately. it was fast and fairly priced not much more can be said
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Inspiring movie about Temple Grandin, a real person who is on the autism spectrum. A must watch for anybody who has a kid with autism or knows one! Claire Daines did an amazing job!!
B0083V2W6I|2.0|the story was hard to follow as the cockney accents were thick and confusing, although the person who received the movie liked it but only because of the music featured in the film.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I didn't expect that ending. Recommend this to everyone. Very touching story. A horrible time in history told by a boy.
B007FC3AAI|3.0|I choose the okay rating because although the package arrived alright and in a good amount of time, I did not like the fact that the plastice wrapping was slit and like the dvd had been opened before it was shipped.  I have bought used and old dvd in the past so i have no qualms about it if it was used but the product was said to be new.  However as i said before it arrived and in a short time.
B00AYF5SHQ|5.0|I'm editing my earlier review. I think that the reviewer I previously criticized was just giving his feedback as to his feelings and thoughts about this recording. These remarks were valid, and I had no right to tear that person apart the way I did. I still stand by my feelings that these works are extremely difficult to play. I'm a violinist as well but, I don't have the right to impose my feelings as the only legitimate ones. So, please accept my apologies. You obviously have followed Julia Fischer quite closely.<br /><br />I think that this situation is getting out of control. I should have kept my personal attacks and comments to myself and kept my mouth shut.  You guys, leave this Music Lover alone. He was reviewing the recording giving his feedback, and he never deserved to be torn apart.  Lets stick to giving the review of the recording and not reviewing other reviewers.  I'm very regretful of how I pounced on Music Lover the way I did.  He actually made some valid points anyway.  Upon listening more closely to this recording, this reviewer is actually right about alot of the feedback given.  I'm extending an olive branch to you Music Lover and hope you will accept it.  I'm so sorry for starting all of this mess. We are suppose to focus on reviewing the recordings and not the other reviewers. You're right we should be able to freely give our opinions without a lynching to occur.  I know you love Julia Fischer alot as do I.  I think we all can agree that Ms. Fischer is a talented musician, and I don't think anyone is intending to tear her apart. I was childish and I feel responsible for starting this whole mess.  You guys, leave Music Lover alone. Now I know why my parents taught me to always be careful of my words, and I should have. Hopefully, we can all laugh about this eventually, even though I know Music Lover doesn't find this funny.<br /><br />Let's just stick to reviewing the recordings and not using it as platform to attack other reviewers.  And, fourstars is actually a really good review.
B00AFEY354|5.0|i have been wanting to see this movie since it was in theaters i loved that it arrived only a couple of days after i ordered it and that it arrived safe and secure.  this is why i love buying directly from amazon although not always cheaper the quality it always great.
0440234743|4.0|The Testament is a legal thriller by John Grisham about the probate for an eccentric, wealthy man living, just barely, in a Virginia suburb of Washington DC. That man, Troy Phelan, was reviewed by three psychiatrists who declared him of sound mind just before he signed a revised will. When the psychiatrists leave, the revised will was shredded, and Troy pulled out a simple holographic will that he prepared for the occasion. After signing the new will, Phelan leaped out of his wheelchair and ran to a narrow terrace adjacent to the top floor of his office building, where he dove to his death.<br /><br />The holographic will left Phelan's fortune to Rachel Lane, a daughter that nobody knew about. Probate, which affirms that the last will and testament of a deceased person is valid, was busy with this case. The six children of Troy Phelan, who hired the psychiatrists to affirm that their father was of sound mind before signing a will that was generous to them, claimed that their dear father had lost his mind before signing the holographic will, even though both actions were within second of each other.<br /><br />These six heirs are a motley group of spendthrifts who have wasted away previous large cash gifts from their wealthy father. The die had been cast years ago with their profligate and dissipated lifestyles. Dr. Phil McGraw couldn't do much to change their lot, and he was not available when the novel was written, only Father Phil. Nevertheless, you could practically hear the voice-over `this is going to be a changing day in your life' when Nate O'Reilly meets Father Phil at his church in the town of St. Michaels.<br /><br />Half of the novel occurs in the Brazilian Jungle, as Nate O'Reilly escapes with his life, surviving the dengue fever, and braving a long safari in his efforts to locate Rachel Lane. Troy Phelan had discovered her general location, but Rachel was a girl who did not want to be found. The law firm representing the estate of Troy Phelan found a partner who was burned out from his job, and recovering from a fourth trip to a detoxification clinic regarding his addiction with alcohol. That man, Nate O'Reilly, was dispatched to Brazil to find the girl who did not want to be found.<br /><br />The other half of the novel occurs in the Beltway, where the lawyer Josh Stafford tried to dispose of Phelan's assets as his client wished. The first two chapters of the novel are narrated by Phelan, and the reader realizes that his revised will is exactly what Phelan wanted. He would give no more money to his children - who all disowned him - and his three ex-wives. Phelan wanted his fortune to go to Rachel Lane, primarily to prevent the cash from going to the sharks in his family.<br /><br />Exactly who gets the money is the story of the Testament. It is not assured that O'Reilly will find Rachel, nor is it assured that she will accept the inheritance if she is found. Rachel, who had been a missionary in the Pantanal for over a decade, was not motivated by money. Nor was O'Reilly the kind of super-sleuth that could find someone who did not want to be found.<br /><br />Nate O'Reilly is a flawed character at the start of the novel, but the reader feels empathy for him despite his relapse during the lonely Christmas in Corumbá.  What makes The Testament such a compelling story is that the reader could not be happier with the way that O'Reilly redeems himself.
0060935464|5.0|Book as requested.  Excellent classic, as I knew it would be. My granddaughter chose it to do a school report on, and I wanted her to have her own copy.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love this show.It had the best storylines and the best characters.I'm excited that the show will live on through books. Get September's Notebook, its great for the Fringe Faithful.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is definitely the best horse or animal app around. I do wish it had more options to earn gems though.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|One of the best books I've read in years!!!!! SHOULD be a movie!!<br />Once started I couldn't put it down!  Awesomely written...super story line. Should be a movie like the 'Memphis Belle'!!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing. Kept me reading til the end. Couldn't put it down for a minute. Can't wait to read the next one
B009VYAVTG|5.0|Love this series, everything is great about it, puts you in to a different place and time. It is Merlin with interesting storylines and humor, has alot of humor.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|This album was awesome and I'm glad I got it on a daily deal. Six more words required. Now two.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|This is great music!! This is a great show! I hope the music and CD's keep coming! I  would buy them all!
B005LAII3U|2.0|SONY BE-LONEY.. OVER PRICED! This disk ,if it wern't defective should only be 14.95. Sony over prices all it stuff,movies disks and music. Don't fall for it. Even the digital disk is already turned off!! What a RIP OFF!!!!!!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This series was very difficult to get into but by season two, I'm addicted! I swear, keep watching...it gets BETTER!!!
B005VPRDAY|5.0|This is probably the best starter lego set for little girls. When pouring them out into the box, they only fill it half way up. This is so your little girl can continue to collect legos in her new box. Most of the small sets you get after this one, will have a couple of mini figs, and come in a cardboard box, so this box will come in handy for the new lego collector in your life.<br /><br />the box is pink, so she will know it is a toy geared at her, and will not think that you gave her a boy's toy, if she cares about that stuff. The mini figs also are little girls, and some have little pets.<br /><br />5 stars for being fun, coming in a sturdy box with extra room for collecting, being an affordable starter set, and having girl friendly colored boxes.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Easy read that keeps attention great to pass time in the car and put yourself somewhere else. Great plot and story
0062082353|4.0|The book gives the reader an inside look into Chris' thinking and his emotions about being not only a Navy Seal, but a true patriot.  I would recommend this to anyone that has been in the military or anyone thinking about the military.<br />The only negative thing about the book was of the printing itself.  It was made of a low quality paper and the page edges were ragged and uneven.<br />But overall, an excellent read!
B005HSL626|5.0|I love it is sooooooopo cool I love it a lot it is soooooo cool and I mean it get this game
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Works with all Amazon Kindle books, all the bells and whistles, last page bookmark, highlighting, etc. This Android app from the Google play store is free and offers everything you would expect from a pay app. This reading app is much easier to use than several others I have tried. I am very happy with the app and would suggest everyone add this into your apps - no matter what tablet you have!
1582701709|5.0|This is great to give you daily inspiration.  It was good that it is undated - just put in a marker - and you can go back year after year to be inspired.
B009IJJ712|5.0|My husband and I are long time fans of the Sherlock stories. So when this series came out we were interested but getting a little bored with what had been done so far.  We were very pleased with the fresh new approach of this Sherlock.  The actors play well together and are really entertaining.  Love the humor.  We are hoping there will be more seasons.  A very unusual Holmes and Watson.
0345505387|3.0|Well, much as I love Diana Gabaldon, I had a hard time with this book.  You have to have read the story to understand it at all and the pictures didn't do much for me.
030758836X|3.0|I was so excited to read this book having read over many of the remarkable customer reviews. I thought this book would be a perfect pick for me considering I couldn't even set the book down from the moment I opened it. I was initially intrigued by the 5 year marriage between Nick and Amy.  However, I quickly lost interest half way through the book when the plot began spirally downward leading to a very depressing ending.  It was sad that these two people fell in love with someone they didn't even know. Amy felt as though she needed to live up to her fictitious character in the book series her parents created, \\"Amazing Amy.\\" Amy would stop at nothing to keep her perfect reputation intact. Through dozens of lies to those who were closest to her, Amy somehow still ended up on top.<br />  I was truly rooting for Amy at the beginning of the book. I felt sorry for her pathetic character. It was only until I found out that she was a total psychopath that I began feeling empathetic toward Nick. I wonder what would have happened if Nick would have stayed completely faithful to his wife. Would Amy have gone completely crazy? Or were Nick's imperfections just an excuse to let her true colors shine? Overall, I was a bit disappointed with the book because of the terribly depressing and unrealistic ending. I would hesitate before I recommended this book to a friend.
B006HL9G10|5.0|This is very simple and straightforward app, which is exactly what I want and expect from a meditation app.<br /><br />Spot On - Sounds Just Like My Real Tibetan Bells<br /><br />I use the Now & Zen Tibetan Phone Bell and Timer, which replaces your telephone's ring with an actual Tibetan bell. I also have several Tibetan singing bowls, and also CDs here at home, so I can say with total confidence that the sounds in this app are spot on, and sound completely authentic to my ear.<br /><br />The Mechanics of Vibration<br /><br />So part of the experience when meditating with Tibetan bells, is the actual physical vibration emanating from the bells. The idea being, at least in part, is to harmonize one's inner state with the physical vibrations and sound waves being produced by the bells. Naturally, this app can only replicate part of that experience, since there is no actual bell physically in the room. However, modern times call for modern alternatives to scaling a mountainside and meditating in the earth's apex with the singing bells of Tibet. So, for those days when you simply don't have the time to make that lofty trek, just pull out this app, and meditate on the spot with these authentic sounding bells.<br /><br />Nice Selection<br /><br />Choose between 7 bells of different sizes and tones. All the bells are pictured and you can listen to samples before setting up your session or timer. In addition to the 7 bells, there's also a set of wooden blocks that also sound nice.<br /><br />Timers<br /><br />Set the desired length of your session; hours, minutes, seconds, or any combination thereof. Set between 1-3 bell rings for each strike. Choose separate beginning and interval bells. Save multiple presets so you can easily chose one that suits your needs.<br /><br />Insight Connect<br /><br />Is a global meditation network. See a live map of the world, pinpointing all the people meditating at that precise moment around the world. Join in and harmonize yourself with the world. Meditate with friends, or make new ones. Focus together on a global scale. Change yourself, and maybe even the world.<br /><br />Journals<br /><br />Add journal entries about whatever you wish to jot down at that moment; thought for the day, goals, intent, whatever you like. You can even export your journal entries and email them to yourself. I have Epson iPrint, so that also gives me the option of printing out my journal entries straight off my phone or tablet.<br /><br />Other Cool Stuff:<br /><br />> Custom Images - set a custom image to appear when your timer starts. Choose something that helps set the mood or focus your intention.<br /><br />> Hide Display - blank out the screen if you don't want it on while meditating; conserves battery and eliminates a potential distraction. The timer and sounds are still functional. Just touch the screen to get it to come back on.<br /><br />> Timer Message - appears when the session is complete. Set it to a personal affirmation.<br /><br />> Social Media - have a post sent to FB or Twitter automatically so friends know you're meditating and can join you, or know to contact you later when you're done.<br /><br />> Prompt for Journal Entry when session concludes - makes it easy to remember to do it.<br /><br />> Vibration - can vibrate with bell sounds or by itself with no bell sounds, depending on your environmental needs.<br /><br />> Do Not Disturb - Mute all other phone or tablet sounds while the timer is active<br /><br />> Charts & Stats - view info about your sessions. Very interesting.<br /><br />A Word About Permissions<br /><br />I'm really picky about permissions and often don't install apps if I feel they are needlessly invasive. The permissions for this app appear to be related to the group meditation options and social networking features. Location, accounts, etc.<br /><br />No Crashes<br /><br />Everything runs smoothly, both on my phone and tablet. Menus are snappy and respond well. Everything is welllaid out and easy to follow. Plus there's well written and detailed instructions on all the features.<br /><br />Bottom Line - clearly this app was created by people who use it themselves. This is very well thought out and executed. Very nicely done. Like it a lot. Best one of its kind I've personally tried. Happy! ;oDlaid out and easy to follow. Plus there's well written and detailed instructions on all the features.<br /><br />Bottom Line - clearly this app was created by people who use it themselves. This is very well thought out and executed. Very nicely done. Like it a lot. Best one of its kind I've personally tried. Happy! ;oD
B005GFPZYK|4.0|This book is different from what I expected.  But that's not a bad thing. It's a pretty in-depth review of Kyle's training activities on entering the Navy SEAL program.  There's a great deal of information on weaponry (Kyle liked guns) and their applications in specific situations. For me, that was interesting. Kyle also reveals himself to be a pretty (in my opinion) blood-thirsty boy, really anxious to blow away his enemies in the name of patriotism.  Compassion does not shine through in this man. The book is amusing in places, and it's loaded with tough-guy (which he was) anecdotes, and his battle scenes are realistic. I got the book in the aftermath of his death, and I'm glad I did. But there's a jingoism in his writing that doesn't set well with me. At times, he appears to be merely a political pawn.  I guess, if you're in combat in a U.S. uniform, that's what you are.  But I'm enjoying the read.
B0091LS07E|4.0|Alisha has grown up to be a wonderful talent. She is multy talented. She's a poet. A singer. A pianist and what a beauty. I enjoyed this cd. Her arrangements, the music. She is very distinguishable. And that's a gift. :)

B007IXWL2C|4.0|I have read all three books and while I liked the series I found myself skimming through some parts mostly because of repetition. SPOILER ALERT. The whole 'please don't leave me' and 'I'll never leave you' stuff got old quick. I found Christian to be a bit too much in some instances and though I get why he is that way it just did nothing for me. The fight scene in the club was kind of stupid and not essential to the story. It should have been left out. I liked that the books did not have endless pages of sexual escapades and that there was some thriller parts. Overall, a decent story. I look forward to more books and/or movies that may be made.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would definitely recommend this book to every adult who likes sex, gay or straight!<br />Amazing writing, interesting story, great sex!<br />Thanks so much!!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great piece of legal fiction once again! I read all but one Grisham book.  I really enjoy reading his books.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I actually absoulutely loved this app/game but I think sometimes its not great at explaining where to find the items..I couldnt finish the game because I couldnt find the last flowers. but it kept me entertained for many nights and i certainly would recomend to anyone!!

B00BFUUMO8|1.0|all it does is waste your time it takes 15 to get on the app the worst app I have ever got
B006LR0XLM|5.0|Can't believe I can use this anywhere. No confusion,, just sync.  Clouds are too confusing for me. Glad I found this!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I was expecting a layout of the traditional games but that layout does not exist. The game is OK but I expected more.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|The author tried too hard to make the oridinary people special and romantic. The characters seemed very forced and unreal. Not the highest level of literature.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Not the greatest but what do you want for nothing. I have used better games on my IPOD and IPhone then this one. I'llhave to try some other versions.
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Nice scientific and financial keys. Other good options like rpn. Works well on my SGS phone. Does everything i need of a calculator and i have the wolfram alpha app for the rest.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Not a great fan of face book. I think it creates more problems then it's worth. I only use it about once a month to see what is going on.
B004XQYBA2|5.0|On my mid range phone the sudoku laypout is the best i have seen. Open sudoku is my other favorite and this has better layout options for small screens, plus very useful highlighting to help you visualise solutions. Currently my favorite sudoku app.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|I have loved the Moody Blues since I first heard the song &#34;Nights in White Satin&#34;, and of course the voice that goes with it.  I have all their CD'S, and especially Justin Haywards solo projects.  He has the most amazing voice and songwriting talent.  His music has gotten me over some rough &#34;bumps&#34; in life.  So wonderful to have this new music now on the 1 year anniversary of my husband's death, it really soothes my soul.  I will always love the Moodies and Justin Hayward.  A fantastic collection of songs and a must have.
B005URRCUY|5.0|The Black Keys just have some many good songs you can't go wrong with any of the albums. This one is definitely on heavy rotation at my house.

B002N5N4M6|5.0|I like Penny and Leonard as Penny and Leonard instead of Penny with dumb guys and Leonard with random girls/ alone and pining. I know its doesn't last but I liked them together in this season.

0316098329|5.0|This story doesn't pull any punches and if it were told from any other perspective than from a 5 year old boy I don't think I could have made it through. I highly recommend this book and even made my bookclub read it.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|We live in vegas and went to three showing of the new day concert. Valet parking and great seats from many locations at Caesars. This video puts you in seats no one ever gets to see.<br /><br />The performance is excellent, the dancers divine but the Blu-ray HD DVD quality takes music and video to a new level, this video will change the way people enjoy vegas shows that reach new highs.<br /><br />Its been a couple of years since Celine performed live this show, but every time I see this music video I am back at Caesars living the dream. The quality of this recording is superb, musicians who see this show can't help thinking they need a new A game. HD Music Videos from the best \\"Celine A New Day.<br /><br />Her older French video is weak by comparison, filmed in a large stadium, video quality suffered, we like Celine but the technical issues left me wanting for more, thanks for the New Day concert, I can't wait for her next Caesars performance to go Blu-ray.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|As a teacher I like kids movies that I can show the day before break that keep the students interested and that I don't find obnoxious. This movie definitely fits the bill- very funny and still appropriate for kids.
B0011V9XT6|1.0|Our home theater experience was cut short because we did not like the artists attitude about men, it seemed like she wanted to be famous and we all should know it.<br /><br />We turned it off early and went to bed.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I may not understand the math but I still love the show. The extras feature where the cast interviews each other is actually pretty entertaining too.
B00068TJM6|3.0|with the time I believe it am starting to like it, I thought it was bigger according to the pictures, I was amazed it was smaller than I thought. Sometimes the buttons don't work properly and I need to touch it to make them work.<br /><br />with some more time I think I will like it more.
0321701763|4.0|This book is not interesting to read but you will learn Photoshop. I took a computer graphics course years ago where the CS3 version of this book was required reading so I bought this book to help me update my knowledge for the newer version of the software I bought.
B0002ONAM4|5.0|I have the reissue on vinyl, I've owned this album on CD for well over a decade and I've always loved it, picked it up on vinyl. Wow, massive difference. The instruments sound like real instruments, it sounds like the band is there in your living room. drums sound full and real, bass is lifelike and there's plenty of it.... I stuck the cd back on after I'd listened to the record twice in a row... The cold clinical nature of digital is ill suited to bands such as the Pixies, if you have this album on CD and you have a halfway decent analog system, pick this up, you'll thank me.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I was worried where they would go with the new season and how they would bring the brother back together but I for one am not remotely disappointed.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|Really enjoyable game with lots of hidden object scenes to complete, if you like mystery games with hidden objects you,'ll love this game x

B004EPYZU8|3.0|This movie is for those nights when you just want to shut you brain off and watch hot chicks hit things. As long as you understand that the plot is unimportant you will probably enjoy this film.
1439127700|5.0|This was a gift to my husband and he loved it as he is a history buff and is very interested in the lives<br />of our Presidents.  I also read this and of course I can remember living through a lot ot the events.
B00005JMJG|5.0|Without question the best film Jim Carrey has ever done. While there are jokes, Carrey proves he can restrain the zany antics inf favor of a moving performance. Plus it has the likes of Kate Winslet, Mark Ruffalo, Kirsten Dunst, and Elijah Wood filling out the rest of the cast. Not to mention the in camera effects- superb!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Without this life would suck on the net I wouldnt use any generic version of this . This is the best
B0011N1WE8|5.0|I think this is a great story with an awesome cast that somehow no one knows about because if you know about this movie you couldn't help but love it. Yes, it's a bit of a Disney-esque ending but the whole story is like a live action fairy tale.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I always know what the weather is and every day i check also it will inform you of the upcomeing week also storm warnings

B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I use google a thousand times a day everything ypou want to know and want to see just look it up
B000WCBPOG|5.0|How can you not love the Beatles music? I really liked how the movie adapted the songs and I think I might like some of the movie versions better than the Beatles originals. I bought this two disc set rather than the other because this set has some of my favorites that the other was missing, only downside is that neither set has Joe Anderson singing I Want You/She's So Heavy.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I need this all the time quick easy and very easy to read my eyes are not that great but I see this just fine
0767802519|5.0|This is not your average movie plot- Simple minded Hitman takes in orphan after her drug dealing (and stealing) parents are gunned down and teaches her to become a hitman so she can get revenge- and did I mention she is like 8. Oh how I love this crazy movie!

B005LAII08|5.0|Cheaper than in the stores.  All the versions you could want.  And my daughter thinks its the best movie ever.
034580404X|5.0|I had a few moments in the book where I went &#34;is it a good thing or a bad thing I know what that means?&#34; I don't have my own room of pain, but, I did have fun reading the different things they did. I think it made it especially interesting seeing how Ana reacted to things and it also made me wonder how much of what was done in the book I'd be willing to do. I especially enjoyed what Christian did with the neck tie in the first book.<br /><br />When things went from dom/sub to more of a lover's relationship, I have to say I was relieved. Laughing and crying because of a book did get some interesting reactions from my grandma and I had to bite my lip a lot to keep from telling her what was happening in the book, granted, that would have been loads of fun to see how red she would have gotten.
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|Very nice concert.  The band sounds like early 1970's....Robert Plant sounds great, but it would be hard for him to do a full tour---so it sounds.  All in all, it is worth the money.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this series, and I'm looking forward to reading the Shift series now.  It really does keep you turning the pages, which is what great books do.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|One of the best TV Mini Series seen on television in a long time.  Well done - terrific acting and story line.
B008D28HYS|2.0|I just wasn't a fan of this game, the app seems fine, not glitchy or anything. Honestly, just not my type of game.
B008742O32|5.0|I use this on my phones, tablets and computers. Just install it on your droid and use your web browser on your computer to transfer files. Works great.
B005IZLPME|4.0|The Blu-ray itself is good, I just thought the movie was a bit of a downer. I mean what's up with that ending?
0062014536|3.0|Ortal Gefen I was really excited for this book. This is the first time since Harry potter on actively waited for a book to come out and not only preordered the hard cover but also bought the audio version. Sarah Drew is an amazing narrator.<br /><br />Spoilers below.<br /><br />...<br /><br />...<br /><br />.ok<br /><br />I didn't love it. I wanted to. I really enjoyed the first to books, and this one started off super promising. I was weary though that the story was going a little too love triangle/typical YA. For a story about love, it really wasn't about that. But anyways I really liked how they went back and forth seamlessly from Hannah to Lena, and their different personalities. I also enjoyed learning more about Lena's mother and Hannah's life now.<br /><br />However I feel like there is absolutely no closure In this book. Being as it was the audiobook, I couldn't believe when it ended. None of the characters had any closure. Nothing. Raven dies In about two sentences. She was such a powerful character. We don't know what happens to Tack or any of the other homesteaders. We don't know what happens to Lena. All the backstory lead to him maybe being killed. The whole love triangle thing abruptly ends out of nowhere. I really liked Lena's character but the whole back and forth thing sucked. Poor Julian. I guess he's SOL. We don't know what happens with the resistance. Nothing. Just that the wall got torn down and it MAY have gone well or they may all have died.<br /><br />Up untill I realized that the book was almost over, I was happily plodding along. It wasn't too drawn out. And I don't expect 100 percent closure. Some things should be left up to interpretation. But not everything. For every major character.<br /><br />I hope there's a fourth.(less)<br />1 minute ago · delete
B007WFQZI2|5.0|This is worth all the money so crisp sounding and heavy as hell and it all just right in your face from the first song right to the last and then you want more after
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Enjoyed this easy read. Some disturbing flash backs to the main characters child hood in an orphanage, but this was the purpose of the book. A cute romantic story, that was refreshing due to the simple pleasures it shared.

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|We and our children (from ages 5 to 15) all loved this movie.  Very funny and sweet.  The minions are probably the best part of the whole movie.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|This is an interesting concept . I was surprised that is a true story. I was prepared for a comedy or some kind of erotic fantacy. Instead, it is a heartfelt, inspiring story of love & romance and life in the real world of a severly handicapped man. I like all the actors tho I had never heard of John Hawkes. I sincerely recomend this movie.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|this is so fun and entertaining.  you cant put it down. very relaxing. I ended up buying the full version and you will too. definitely worth it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think you should get this game because it is beast and boss. If your a DUCK DYNASTY fan and you think duck dynasty is awesome this game.is as awesome as that. But there is only one thing that this game is not as awesome as. And that is SI ROBERTSON. That is my opinion but your a is probably going.to be different.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have had this for a while and it is the best app out for kindle in my opinion and many others! buy now
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is awesome and has very beautiful graphics . This is my favorite game in the world . I recommend playing this game
B008FRFN7A|5.0|Easy to put on. Is holding up well.  Still looks as good as the day I put it on.  Thanks so much for the great deals. Amazon you rock!!!
B000TLMWMY|5.0|I remember watching the Johnny Cash T.V. show as a child and watching this DVD bought back wonderful memories. Anyone with an interest in the history of Folk / rock and country music must see this DVD. Cash was an underrated song writer and was a brilliant showman. It is only now that you can fully appreciate what he accomplished. I would recommend thisn DVD to anyone just for the entertainment value.
B008M721MS|5.0|I got this when I got my kindle, and it rocks . If you want to keep in touch with your family, then get this app, right away!!!!!!!!

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Totally loved it but wish it was longer. I guess when it's a fun game they are always too short!
B008HK3XOU|4.0|I really like this case except that my games are upside down...i have to turn my kindle upside down in order to play the games. Other than that, it's a great case, nice finish, not bulky, easy to install and use.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What an ending-now we have to wait almost a year for the next season.  What a story.  I have told everyone to watch this.  Its fresh and love the setting.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|Its fun to play but gets old quickly. My children like to play this game though. I keep it on my fire for them.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Loved this season-kept you wanting to go on to the next segment.  I loved how it just grabs you and you want to keep on going.
B00B2TUKI0|2.0|Dirgy covers of material done better elsewhere. I lover her voice, but it did not make up for the material.
B0081336FO|5.0|Really enjoyed this series.  No episode was disappointing.  The Brits know how to put together a series that keeps one involved.
0062238868|5.0|Wonderful book!!!  Hated to hear the Chris Kyle was killed after he had risked his life for us.  Thank you, Chris...
0735619670|5.0|I cannot stress how useful this book is to a software engineer. Reading this book and taking its lessons to heart will make you code far more sensible, better structured and readable; not to mention less buggy. The concepts inside are not mind blowing or anything but common sense is anything but common.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie (we are both dog lover's) Watching how much this dog loved his owner brought me to tears all through the movie.  Nothing like the unconditional love of a dog.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|One of the most touching books I've read yet. I loved all the characters except the ones who were despicable, and there were plenty of both! Cried through the last several chapters and enjoyed every tear shed! I highly recommend this book to everyone she has ever been in love!
B007VDN1PA|5.0|Never thought that this scanner would do such a nice job of transferring slides to our computer. Wow! Don't let the inexpensive price fool you. My wife loves this thing. We have thousands of slides to go, but it only takes seconds to put them in, scan, save, and later transfer from SD card to computer. It even lets you make minor adjustments to the scan before you save it. - Don't forget to change the setting back or it will apply to all scans after that. I would highly recommend if you have slides you want to make available for easier retrieval and ready for other family members.
B004D2GMR6|5.0|Great! Love it<br />Thank you<br />JC

B004ODLUGM|4.0|For people who love beautiful animations, lovely music and a nice story....not stupid jokes or characters running into each other with loud crashes. Definitely for fans of Brambly Hedge, Kipper and Percy the Park Keeper.<br /><br />The british always know how to put out an enjoyable peaceful animation.
B009XY97VC|4.0|This album they clearly tried to move their sound forward and experiment more, with mixed success. Songs like Blackheart and Blizzard and the unexpectedly modern &#34;All's Hell that ends well&#34; are some of their best work yet and worth buying the entire album.<br /><br />But be warned: Other songs on this album have English lyrics. Whaaa? I buy TSFH's kind of music to listen to while writing and I cannot have lyrics, period, so their mere presence was already a real problem for me, but these are BAD lyrics. Really insipid. I have had to delete the files from my computer and ipod so I don't risk them showing up on shuffle.<br /><br />You might consider listening to the clips and then just buying your favorite individual tracks. Or, support the group and buy the whole album, but don't download the entire thing. I think most listeners are going to actively dislike at least one track on this album, even if they love every other song.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is the masterpiece that the dude that wrote Gosford Park was trying to achieve that one time and the failed badly. Downton Abbey is awesome because of the outfits, the location, and some of the actors. If you've ever been to the UK like I have you will know that some of the random romance characters that are thrown in are underwear models and whatnot and are not long for this series. Sorry, but the writing is good, but sometimes the random maids and other love interests are not believable for UK standards. If you are watching as an American (like me) you know those characters are disposable. Otherwise, great performances and great attention to detail.
0385537697|5.0|Very pleased with the quality of the binding, the jacket cover, built-in bookmark, the whole thing.  Very well made, really glad I found it on Amazon.
B000TGJ8AS|5.0|Yet another season of delving deeper into the lives of the characters, learning so much more about them. Plus all the criminal scenarios have been fantastic!
0307383415|4.0|It's not often that we get the opportunity to read an autobiography written by a man BEFORE he becomes President of the U.S. and before he even enters politics (an exception being JFK's \\"PT-105\\"). For that reason alone this is a special book, for in it Obama shares some of his pivotal childhood and coming-of-age memories, as well as his concerns for the poor and disempowered people in his country.  While in the process of making decisions about his goals and how to achieve them, he shows how he embraces all the heritages he owns: Hawaiian, Indonesian, Midwestern and Kenyan, as well as New York and Chicago.  His writing reveals an extraordinary level of self-awareness, due perhaps to the fact of his differentness wherever he goes.  Therefore, his inclination not to take anything for granted.<br /><br />After reading this book, I cannot help but shake my head in disbelief and disgust when remembering all those people who claimed during his two campaigns for President that he was hiding something about his background.  Obviously those detractors never bothered to read his books, where he tells virtually all.
B002G4FQAC|5.0|I love it! i thought that it wasn't going to be new but it completely looks new and the songs play good.
B000063DFQ|4.0|I'm tired of wasting time in life.  In fact, it might just be easier to speak the blunt truth about this album without a long winded introduction.  I mean seriously who at this point doesn't at least no who these guys are or what they are about.  As for the album, it's...ahem...ALMOST classic.  Cough cough \\"Die With Your Boots On\\" sucks cough cough (How has this become a fan favorite?)  I mean to say that Piece of Mind begins to fall off a bit after \\"The Trooper\\" until the end, then \\"To Tame A Land\\" closes off the album very well.  \\"Revelations\\" and \\"Flight of Icarus\\" are personal favorite cuts from the Maiden classic period.  There see that was easy, quick and to the point.  Four stars, go get it, but don't be surprised by the inclusion of a few filler tracks.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Super fun game. Gold isn't very easy to get but you can still get plenty of entertainment without buying gold. Definitely  recommend this game!!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a YA novel. It has terrific heart and a wonderful set of characters (and the parents aren't made to be completely stupid). I laughed out loud - and of course cried through the end.
0525478817|5.0|The Fault In Our Stars is a must-read, and I don’t use that term lightly.<br /><br />There are some books that simply must be experienced, and this is one of them.  From now on, when anyone asks me for a book recommendation, this book will be at the top of my list.  I say this not because it changed my life—it didn’t.  But, as an avid reader, this book resonated with me so deeply that it will forever be ingrained as a part of my existence.<br /><br />The story is all too real.  A sixteen year old with terminal cancer meets a contemporary who happens to have been cured of his cancer.  They hit it off immediately, and she introduces him to a book that she loves, and he falls in love with it, too, as well as the girl.  Of course, falling in love with someone who has terminal cancer is a complicated situation at best.  Before long they take it upon themselves to reach out to the author of their favorite book, and the result is not exactly what they expected.  Furthermore, as one would imagine with a book featuring cancer afflicted characters, heartbreak ensues, but not necessarily in the way most readers predict.<br /><br />Green’s teenagers are precocious, witty, and downright hilarious.  This is a difficult juxtaposition for many readers because these characters, for the most part, do not expect to live normal lives or, in some cases, to live at all.  It feels inappropriate to laugh at things these characters say and do, but I think that’s the point Green is trying to make.  Life is horrible, wonderful, and everything in between, and when we’re not crying, we’re laughing.  The teens pull no punches, they accept their reality, and they force the reader to make peace with their burden as well.<br /><br />Green has written a book unlike any other I’ve ever read, and I’ve read quite a few.  At one moment he had me rolling, the next he had me nearly in tears.  The Fault In Our Stars never felt completely realistic only because the characters—Hazel, Augustus, Isaac, and both sets of parents—were too charismatic to be real.  They leapt off the page and demanded to become a part of my everyday life.  I struggled with this, because I don’t know anyone quite as charming, funny, or quick on their feet as these characters.  But, that’s also what makes them so utterly lovable.  They are not real, and so they are allowed to say the exact right thing at the exact right time.  They are welcome to charm the heck out of us.  A book like this is meant to be magical in many ways, and tragic in others.  After all, nearly all of the characters are made to suffer, so why shouldn’t they get to go down as some of the most dynamic literary figures to have ever existed upon the page?  Why can’t they be the coolest kids in the room?<br /><br />I am a married thirty-six year old father of two, an English teacher, an author, and I generally don’t read much young adult literature.  With all that being said, The Fault In Our Stars is now counted among my favorite books and I urge you to read it as soon as possible.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of Andropiastus, Isaac, and both sets of parents—were too charismatic to be real.

B007MDB6L0|5.0|It has seriously become my favorite!!! I had watched it today on Disney Jr. and I was really fascinated with the storyplot. I love how the films teaches about unity and making things work between both sides. It's almost like a Romeo and Juliet except that there's no discrimination here. It was just about two fairies trying to find a way that the fairies from Pixie Hollow and Winter Woods could be together without having to regard about their safety. I really enjoy the bond between Tinkerbell and her lost sister Periwinkle and how they would look out for each other. The animation was really beautiful and pleasantly done. Slush is really a cutie. I have definitely fallen in love with the new characters in this story. They are just so darn cute!!! I would have definitely watch this again. I even rank this film higher than the recent Disney animated films like Tangled and the newer Barbie films. IMO, this movie just outshines them with their story plot, character development, and animation combined.
0307277887|5.0|Take a walk through the mind of a serial killer.  It will be mostly palatable because he's kind of an avenging angel for the weak who have been preyed upon.  Most fascinating for me is the author's portrayal of this character which is so believable it makes me wonder if he doesn't have a dark rider of his own.  I do have to skim over a bit  now and then, but for the most part I find myself cheering him on.  By the way, the T.V. Series is definitely not a disappointment.
0446677450|4.0|I gave this book to each of my sons They each read it and gave it back. Each said I should have read it a long time ago and prepared them better, but they did say,&#34;better late than never!&#34;

0142410705|5.0|Read more: [..]    John Green strikes again.  I fell in love with him after A Fault in Our Stars and he doesn't fail to impress.  Katherines has all the snark and wit of Fault without the heavy subject matter, making this one a lighter, wackier read.  Yes, I said wacky.  It's over-the-top but believable, ramping up the humor without making it a complete eye-rolling exaggeration.  Colin is delightfully clueless; Hasan, delightfully snarky; Lindsey, somewhere in between.  Green takes their brokenness to hilarious heights without cheapening their struggles. The plot is somewhat winding.  The main conflict is Colin's inner struggle with the Theorem to describe all Katherines, the discovery that will take him from washed-up prodigy to genius.  As he and Hasan bumble along one weird incident after another, we watch Colin grow and learn that life is more about Katherines, and genius.  The footnotes add to the dry tone, the perfect humor for any geek or fan of good writing.    plot . 5/5  There isn't much of a plot, per se.  Colin gets broken up with and has a meltdown.  Hassan takes him on a road trip.  In the midst of looking for the grave of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in a tiny Tennesee town, they're taken in by small-town-smartie Lindsey and her pink-obsessed mom.  Who got rich owning a factory that makes tampon strings.  Cue hilarity.  It's kind of episodic, with the boys pulled along through each weird adventure: grave-seeking, hog hunting, interviewing oldies about the town's quaint history.  What ties it together are the relationships of the three main characters and their interplay with the people in their lives.  And of course, the flashbacks to each failed Katherine.  It's part memoir, part math book, and it reads smooth and easy like a summer tale, rather than a thriller.    concept . 5/5  Did I mention that I love John Green?  He has the power to exaggerate something to the point of hysterics while still making it so authentically emotionally real.  A boy brokenup with by nineteen Katherines is not your average teen contemporary.  Now make that boy a whiny prodigy obsessed with anagramming.  Who's got himself a summer job interviewing tampon factory workers for a woman in a pink mansion.  Who's trying to create a mathematical equation to predict the dumper and dumpee in any relationship.  It's ridiculous--which makes it the perfect background for some very deep issues of life and love, that could easily be cliched, but aren't.    characters . 5/5  Just as crazy as the concept, and fascinating, and real.  Colin is a whiny overly-smart overly-clueless underly-confident child prodigy who's afraid he hit his prime in high school.  An eighteen-year-old going through a midlife crisis?  Already endearing.  You just want to hug him or slap him, which is the best kind of character, really.  It means you care.  Hassan is a delightful contradiction--a swearing, irreverently reverent Muslim jokester who covers his insecurities in angry humor and sees more in the world than a prodigy like Colin could ever fathom.  Then bring in Lindsey, a smart, lost small-town girl who's afraid to matter.  Together, they play off of each other's issues and bring to light a lot of interesting things about the way we interact and what we want out of life.  And of course, the Katherines.  We get a little vignette on each one but really, they exist to show us Colin's inner world.    style . 5/5  Green is a fantastic writer.  He focuses as much on style as on story, creating works of art that few popular authors can claim.  In keeping with Colin's analytical (and brokenhearted) mind, his writing in this story is precise, a little maudlin, and a lot cluttered up with footnotes, wry humor, and math.  It's so dry you could burn your tongue on it and I loved every inch.  Except maybe the appendix full of math.  Because math makes me cry.    mechanics . 5/5  The footnotes are perfect.  Unlike the laborious ones in David Foster Wallace, these are a cute way to show the crazy workings of Colin's head.  The other thing, which at first I thought I'd be railing about, was the use of \\"fugging\\" instead of the obvious alternative.  It drove me crazy at first until they actually addressed it in the story, and then it became a funny and cute characterization of Colin and Hassan.    take home message  A brokenhearted boy's journey to solve the mystery behind getting dumped, and what he finds instead.
B002WV5A9G|4.0|I was in the mood for an action flick so this movie was a lot of fun for me.  I liked the acting though some of the writing and liberalities with hard science of physics was a bit of a let down.  The whole red matter thing was a bit crazy.  The re-writing of the entire original series didn't affect me until later after I contemplated it a bit.  I just think of the entire thing as an alternate reality.  It's a good fast story and has some great action though.
1892005034|4.0|This book gives the reader a structured system for dealing with relationship problems.<br />What I like about the system is that it forces the party who wants to create harmonious relationships<br />an introspective, non-judgmental way of looking at their own values w/o becoming involved in<br />negative bonding. Although trying to remember the processes when you are pissed at someone<br />is a challenge.
B00170M2JY|4.0|I liked this movie the first time when it originally released and I liked it again when we recently watched it again.  The story has heart.  It is the first and last thing I liked Ren&eacute;e Zellweger.  One of the last movies I liked Tom Cruise in (though he is great in Knight and Day) and Cuba Gooding Jr. makes the movie.  He is hilarious, with tons of energy and you want him to be in every scene.  Great movie.

B002Z8IWMS|5.0|The first time I saw Jobs talking was  a video of his Stanford address. Since then I have seen a few of his product launch videos  and have been mesmerized by the way he carried himself.  I brought this book about two weeks ahead of a major presentation with a client.I was given a two hour slot at 4PM on a Friday, a time when most people are well into their weekend .I badly needed some inspiration to do a good job.The book is well laid out , easy to read and the style of writing helps to recall a lot of stuff mentioned. I tried to employ most of the points mentioned in the book; changed a standard deck to incorporate the minimalistic, catchy  and engaging style that is the hallmark of most of Jobs presentations. And practiced. I had an audience who sat through and engaged actively  in discussions till 7PM that day !!. Good book which becomes better if you put the words into action at the first opportunity.

0345803485|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is probably one of the worst, most laughable books I have ever read- and I'm disappointed to say that because I think the plot had some potential. It's so bad that even people who gave it 5 stars admit that, \\"It's not very well written.\\" Ya think? I'm not looking for Pride & Prejudice of the 21st century, nor am I expecting fireworks from a first-time author, and I do understand that this is a Twilight fanfiction. But seriously, WHERE WAS HER EDITOR? As a favorite blogger of mine says, \\"...James tied up her editor and threw her down a well and then forged the signature on the notes for the book which read \\"No changes necessary! This book is totes perfect!\\" followed by three little hearts and a smiley face. It's the only explanation for how this book ever happened.\\"<br /><br />The sheer repetitiveness- \\"inner goddess\\", \\"jeez\\", some variation of \\"holy crap/sh**/fu**/cow/hell/Moses\\", and \\"wow\\" - is mind boggling. IT'S CALLED A THESAURUS, YOU GUYS. Also, your subconscious is, you know, UNDER your conscious; therefore, you do not know what it is saying. ADDITIONALLY, I wanted to strangle the absolutely ridiculous personifications of her \\"subconscious\\" and \\"inner goddess\\" by the time I finished the book.<br /><br />For those of you who really want to know, here's the word count (my Kindle told me so):<br />Holy crap/sh**/fu**/cow/hell/Moses: 153<br />Inner goddess: 58<br />Subconscious: 79<br />Wow: 38<br />Jeez: 81<br />This, in itself, is pretty damning.<br /><br />Those observations aside, I was pretty disappointed in her portrayal of BDSM. I'm not part of the BDSM community and even I was slightly put out by its characterization. Sex columnist Dan Savage summed it up best when he said, \\"To Fifty Shaders: BDSM is cops and robbers for grownups with your pants off + orgasms. People do it for fun. It's not a cry for help.\\" I understand that James broke barriers by publishing BDSM erotica. I just wish the mainstream literary world's introduction to BDSM culture had just been a little more.... researched? WELL-WRITTEN?<br /><br />You guys, I get that this is her first foray into the published word; this fanfiction is James flexing (forming??) her literary muscles. Which is all well and good- everybody needs to start somewhere, right? But I don't want to read something off the New York Times Best Seller list that reads like a hilariously bad first attempt at erotica by an 18 year old creative writing student. Scratch that, that would be a disservice to creative writing students everywhere.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book? Maybe. If you want to laugh a lot.<br /><br />But can somebody PLEASE fish her editor out of that well??
B008XBASVY|5.0|As a sophomore in high school and an aspiring journalist, this book has left me breathless and inspired. After watching the movie and reading the book, I felt so inspired and ecstatic for my future, just as Carson expresses throughout the entire novel. This book not only inspires, but teaches great inner strength and self confidence through awful experiences. I applaud Chris Colfer and all of his work. Thank you sir, for doing just as Carson did, and inspiring others to write while writing yourself. I am truly inspired.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy playing this game, it has excellent graphics and fun objectives. I would recommend this game to people of all ages.
B0099114WO|2.0|I like Meryl Streep.  I like Tommy Lee Jones.  I sometimes like Steve Carell.  This is not a good movie.  It's not a comedy.  It's not a drama.  It's kind of sad and mostly pathetic.  The ending is hopeful and optimistic, and I guess, romantic.  But it doesn't seem believable to me, based on what transpired in the bulk of the movie.  Use your time more profitably.  Watch something else.  Read a book.  Have a conversation.
B00A1EOBJQ|4.0|My wife wanted to get this and since I enjoy the show I figured why not. To my surprise it turned out to be one of the best CD's I have bought in years. Song number 2 \\"If I Didn't Know Better\\" is just fantastic. Well worth the price.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|Game play is fine. Graphics are not bad. The pirate theme is on the corny side. The part I didn't like and the reason I removed it from my device in less than a week is because it will not work unless you are connected to the internet. I was using this on my tablet. Depending on where I'm at or what I'm doing, I may not have access to wifi. Also, a lot of times I disable wifi to conserve battery life. the app will not start because of this! If you have a limited data plan this could use up some of that. It also always wants to connect with facebook. It would be a good time waister if not for that. I understand the advertisement aspect of the app. It would have been better to load a banner or two on my device and change them when it gets reconnected to the internet, or after a few days it says that it hasn't been online in a while and stops working then like a few other apps I have.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|There aren't too many shows available to watch together as a family.  Everyone enjoys it and loves the ongoing conspiracy.
0374533571|5.0|After hearing of the film, \\"Silver Linings Playbook\\" and the rave reviews that accompanied it, I decided to research the film. Upon realizing it was based on a book, I acquired the book and read it.<br /><br />This is a truly great story that does a phenomenal job of bringing mental illness and depression to the spotlight. Quick does a terrific job of taking his readers directly into Pat's fragmented and disturbed mind, as the story is told from his perspective. Seeing it from 1st person makes you feel very bad for Pat. I found myself rooting for him throughout the entire work and hoping his life turned out just as he wanted it. It was difficult for me to see Pat as a character. This book made me feel like I really knew him and I was thus able to sympathize with him.<br /><br />The entire book is loaded with heartwarming and emotional scenes that brought mental illness to a brand-new light for me. After seeing what Pat went through, I genuinely feel much more concern for anyone afflicted with mental issues. Readers will find it extremely easy to connect with Pat and understand exactly what he goes through.<br /><br />This isn't an action packed book that will leave you on the edge of your seat. However, it will definitely find its way into your mind and heart and touch you. You will be enlightened and see humanity in a different way. Life won't be the same after reading this. I don't mean to say your notions will become altered and up heaved, but you will see life a bit differently after this book. In fact, it isn't so much a book as it is an experience. I normally don't get all sentimental over books (in fact, I rarely read books like this; I'm a crime/mystery fan) but this one really moved me.<br /><br />I can't give away too much of the plot without spoiling the story, but I can assure you that this is a thought provoking and beautifully written novel that will leave you pondering it long after you have finished it.<br /><br />Oftentimes, films cannot adequatelystir emotions as well as their print counterparts. Novels allow readers to introspectively enter the mind of the characters and see the world from their perspective. Films usually struggle in this area and cannot compensate for the loss of this ability. I haven't seen the film that was based on this book yet, but I sure hope it does justice to this astonishing work.
B0084B5TK8|2.0|The form is interesting, the substance a bit of a let down. Dracula makes for a better movie than a novel.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I thought the book was very good and an easy read.  The ending was a little disappointing but over all it was okay
B004J4WKTW|1.0|The book really was very boring.  It moved so slow and jumped around a lot. It was difficult to really have any attachment to any of the characters.  I would not recommend this book.  I kept waiting for something exciting or interesting to happen but it never does.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|like a boss I love this game. its like a thousand times better than the old one I recommend this to every one
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I really enjoyed watching the show. the cast of characters that they bring together is quite interesting and they seem to blend very well together. The overarching story is well structured and the &#34;filler&#34; episodes are very interesting and walter brings a solid level of humor and intensity to the show on occasion. Over all bravo

B0097EWK3A|4.0|Artifex Mundi make excellent games that are complex and consuming.  I really enjoy the way the games are designed.  They require you to use logic and problem solving not just finding hidden objects.  The story lines are intriquing.  I just wish the stories were not so dark and cultic.  If they would lighten up the storyline I would like them better.  I would love to see adventure,  treasure hunting,  or mysteries of finding stolen objects etc.  Leave behind the demonic,  cultic themes.  The art work and sound effects I love!  It really sets the atmosphere.

I tried many samples of their 5-star recommendations, and even if I didn't personally love them I could see how they were superior from other things I had worn or smelled.It introduced me to 'niche' fragrance and that has been fun!

B00422LESO|4.0|Fun read.  The beginning dragged a little but got enticing around the middle.  I would recommend this book for an escape for a bit.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I did not buy the book for all of the five star ratings. No no. I purchased this book due to all of the 1 and 2 start ratings. When a book has this much debating I want to read it. And read it I did! **Spoilers coming at you folks!<br /><br />The book touches on a difficult subject, child molestation. It is one girls difficult journey when she learns the truth about something that had been hidden away from her ... her past! When her past comes crashing in on her it is her boyfriend, Holder, that keeps her together. There are parts to this book that I did indeed LOVE. There are also parts to this book that I HATED. But I am giving it four stars anyway.<br /><br />What I hated:<br />1.) The cowardice death of Sky's father. In fact, that whole scene was a bit disappointing and felt it was written just a wee bit sloppily. (Is sloppily a word?) I just felt that whole event was too .... I don't know ... easy. It went too smoothly. Sky was suddenly too bold. Her Dad popped himself off too quick. I felt this, of all the points of the story, should have been deeper, darker, and just more rich. I was ready for a full meal and instead was handed a tiny piece of sponge cake. Speaking of sponge cake ...<br />2.) Sex scene in the shower. I didn't mind the other sex scenes (in fact the first couple were pretty stinkin' hot) however, the one after her father's death was just too ... well, it wasn't needed, at all. I find that the shower scene was excellent up until they had to have sex. The sex scene itself was okay. I think the timing of it was horrible though. (Honestly the story didnt need it) There is something seriously wrong with a person who wants to \\"get laid\\" right after washing bits and pieces of brain tissue out of their hair.<br />3.) The explanation from Karen was just too easy. I can't help but think that if it were me, I would still be furious and non-trusting of Karen. That is not to say that forgiveness would not have been there - AFTER TIME AND HEALING! It just seemed like kind of a \\"cop out\\" explanation. It summed up everything, without consequences and all was forgiven. Kind of a complete happy ending. A story this dark should not end this happily. But that's just me.<br />4.) The grammar and lack of editing did pull me out of the story from time to time.<br /><br />What I loved:<br />1.) The molestation scene. YES, I thought this was well written and I want to give Colleen Hoover kudos for penning this in a way that was just graphic enough for you to be disgusted and hate the man, and yet delicate enough that you didn't close the book and walk away. This scene evoked many appropriate responses from me after reading it. Well done!<br />2.) The characters. The interactions between the teens made me laugh out loud many times, especially the texting between the three. It reminded me of my friends and I enjoyed it. It reminded me of, well, high school. I especially loved Sky's \\"Mormon\\" friend! These characters were interesting!<br />3.) I also loved watching Holder's character work through his issues with their awful childhood as well. Even though I thought his character was a little on the edge, I liked him. It was important that he received resolution in this situation too.<br /><br />All in all this book has flaws, but it also has some very good points too! Normally I would give a book like this three stars. However, with this book, it did what, to me, is the MOST important thing when hearing / reading a story ... it kept me hooked! I could not put it down. In spite of the difficult subject matter, in spite of the sex in brain matter, in spite of the grammar and editing errors ... I just could not stop reading it! I had to know what happened next. I had to know how far the author was willing to go with the subject. The book was VERY entertaining and THAT is why I read. Four stars well earned. Thank you for the great entertainment!<br /><br />~*~Rhea

B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great quick read full of great information on training and fighting our nations enemy's. excellent account of raid on bin Ladin 's compound , no BS state department propaganda.
030758836X|3.0|This convoluted novel definitely was not my &#34;cup of tea&#34;. To be on the bestsellers list for so long, it was a real disappointment.
B00AGOGOLE|1.0|The camera pictures are poor and now the video isn't working. I'm not sure what happend or why it doesn't open, but I wanted to see what the different video resolutions (780p or 1080p) would look like when taking a video. It did not open, and now, I don't have any video capabilities at all now! I wish I could get my money back! I guess you get what you pay for?!?!
B00A9X9ORI|5.0|Bruce Willis brings it. I enjoyed the movie and would say you should see it. I think he gets better as he gets older.
034580404X|5.0|E.L. James initially started writing \\"Fifty Shades...\\" as Twilight fan fiction, and, as can be seen in many of the reviews here, these are polarizing books. As others have said, about both this AND the Twilight series, you either love 'em, or you hate 'em. I seriously initially thought I wouldn't care either way, even after beginning my reading of book one, but once I got to page forty (or somewhere around there) of \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\", I was hooked. I literally COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN! I thought about, \\"what's gonna happen next?!?\\" constantly at work, and my mom was right: I told her I was going to take a break from reading them at the end of book one, and she said I wouldn't be able to. She laughed when I told her she could tell me, \\"I told you so\\"! Granted, I wanted to smack Ana more than once (who I saw myself in, for her romantic naivete' and lack of self-confidence), but you have no IDEA how thankful I was that I had books two and three sitting right there, because I was absolutely COMPELLED to pick book two up, and start reading immediately, at the expense of sleep in the middle of my work week!<br /><br />A caveat, for anyone that is skeptical, and not-so-open to the actual enjoyment of this series: you have to take this series with a pinch, not a grain, of salt. While not perfect, they're HUGELY fun to read, if you can just stop yourself from scoffing at things here or there during your reading (yeah, I'm talking to you, pretty annoying \\"Inner Goddess\\". SERIOUSLY?!? And then we have the \\"oh my\\"s, and the near-constant shock expressed by Ana... Dude, were you paying ATTENTION to the guy you're with?!? : P wait, sorry. She's young, naive, and growing into a woman. I'll cut her some slack). Once you do that, I have no doubt that you will simply devour these books, as I did.<br /><br />My MOM is actually the person that kept talking these books up (in addition to countless friends and co-workers), and ended up loaning me her copies. In all likelihood, unless you're one that's likely to re-read your books months or years after finishing them, buying used copies here is a cheap way to get your hands on a very absorbing series that builds upon itself, maturing and developing its characters into the sort that your brain will keep straying back to, willingly or not. The story here was just so damn absorbing that I literally spent HOURS reading after work each night, losing sleep and fighting to keep my eyes open to do so. And it's been YEARS since I was so absorbed in a series! Christian is gorgeous, sweet (deep down), and deeply flawed, and Ana is likable, near-blinded by love, and naive. Both characters have LOTS of maturing to do, and, through all of that sex (which, yes, you will end up growing a bit weary of), they start moving to where you want them to go. Of the three books, I think I enjoyed book two the most, although each is valuable - and enjoyable - for different reasons. Book one was the one that really sucked me in, book two developed the characters further, and book three ended up tying things up nicely. The extra little prize at the end, past the prologue, where we get to see things, just for a bit, from Christian's perspective, was very enjoyable, and just what I expected his thought process to be.<br /><br />Again, on the sex, since you've heard SO many whispers about it: yes, there's plenty of BDSM sex, but I didn't really find it to be all that steamy; if you're not a virgin, and you've had good experiences with your partner behind closed doors, really, come on, you've had experiences as good as the main characters' (at least, God, I HOPE you have!), even if you haven't used all of the exceptional toys and/or methods discussed in the series. Thus, the sex was just more background noise for me, although it IS necessary, again, to illustrate the progress made by, and the growth happening in, the main characters (no pun intended... Really).<br /><br />The characters here are young, and Mrs. James wrote this as what seems to me to have been a guilty pleasure of hers. That comes through for me, as the reading of this trilogy was a guilty pleasure for me: just like the most decadent slice of chocolate cake you can conceive of, where you don't even try to fool yourself into thinking there's any nutritional value, this series is purely for enjoyment. No Nobel prizes, or any sort of literary awards, will be won by Mrs. James for this series, but instead, she has the appreciation of countless individuals in the world for offering up a very fun, nearly meritless escape from our (potentially) dreary day-to-day existences. This book series isn't perfect, but it's a Hell of a fun read, and I enjoyed every single page that I read, and every moment that I took to devour Mrs. James' writing! I burned through all three books in less than three weeks, and, honestly? I've been looking for my next \\"Fifty Shades\\" ever since! This stuff is ADDICTIVE, and I would TOTALLY sign on for more, in a heartbeat!<br /><br />And, as for the film versions of these? I can't even conceive of how they could make a faithful book-to-film translation of these without either an \\"X\\" rating, or substituting a WHOLE mess of book content, so I really don't see myself going to any movie versions of these books...s what seems to me to have been a guilty pleasure of hers.

B00BHMF578|5.0|Wow, really explains a lot. I was pretty young at the time of the real thing and didn't know all this happened. This is a must see, maybe a must see twice.
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|I absolutely love these movies. It's rare when two actors mesh the way Gibson and Glover do. Just the right amount of comedy and action, too. I highly recommend these movies to anyone that likes edge-of-your-seat action and comedy. It was an amazing price, too.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is a cool game. If you have creative skills and are good at drawling, you will do great. I on the otherhand play with smart people so they can figure out what I am trying to drawl.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game was very entertaining game could not stop playing it.Finding the hidden objects were not real easy which made it more entertaining.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|This was so stupid but it was so funny. This is the type of movie you want to see over and over.
0143120530|5.0|In general, &#34;Moonwalking with Einstein&#34; is an excellent book. readers in different ages can learn from the book. No one will be regret to read this book, instead, a lot of readers will recommend this interesting book to their friends. Mr.Foer uses objective but persuasive narrative to achieve his purpose: &#34;Let everyone be confident to improve their memory and know how to do that.&#34; However, there are still some weaknesses. The author's statements are based on his own experience, so it is not convincing enough to say the same skill can take effect on every other normal person. It will be better is Mr. Foer can find a partner with him when detecting the art of memory. The book is nearly to be perfect, and i have learned a lot from this book!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Makes you want to always be heavily drinking just to get on a plane knowing that things like those could actually happen. I enjoyed this movie.
B00062IDCO|5.0|We watched the whole season in about two weeks time.  We couldn'twait to get the final season to find out what happens next.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I wasn't sure how good this movie was going to be, but it turned out to be a great story. I really enjoy this movie.
B008XG1X18|5.0|LOVE THIS APP!!  the problem is that is super addicting.  i find so much information.  i find recipes, to things for my pet.
B007HACDLK|5.0|What can I say? If you have not read every one of Vince's books and if your not eagerly awaiting the next one, then you are missing out.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I did not look at this yet but had seen it on public broad casting television.  I wanted to add this to my collection.
B00BESLHEA|4.0|Hey it is a Quinten Tarintino movie, so if you enjoy his movies then you will enjoy this movie. Just realize it is just something to see and will not be winning any awards.
0062014536|5.0|It's so interesting to me to see all the reviews that wish the ending had been wrapped up in a neat bow. But REQUIEM'S ending is wonderful for several reasons: it makes you wonder and imagine what will happen after you close the book, and I can't think of anything more satisfying than a book filled with characters who feel so real that you find yourself imagining what they are doing outside of the pages. As for the final battle, I feel the same way. This world is one we have grown to know and care about, and that horrible doubt we feel, hoping fervently that the Invalids will win but fearing that they may not, just goes to show how rich and wonderful this world is.<br /><br />In fact, one of the things that annoys me about a lot of YA is the way it wraps up so neatly--the girl gets the boy AND she saves the world! Single-handedly! At age 17! Lauren Oliver doesn't give us that. Instead, she is writing real literature--the kind that sticks with you long after you've finished reading, and makes you think.
B00AMBLDEE|5.0|Another good Bourne movie. Hurry up and make more. I really enjoy this series. Hopefully future ones will be as good as post series.
B0070ZLZ1G|5.0|For educators, that is. And maybe education majors too. Paul Tough breaks down the factors leading to success for American school children in such a succinct and organized way. This has greatly deepened my understanding of what success is, and how it is achieved. There are no easy answers in the world of education reform, but like science, we have to keep building on new information in order to keep improving the lives of our children and the outcomes of our schools.
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|My girlfriend saw this on a plane and said I had to see it that it was my type of movie. She was right it was enjoyable.
B004N6369Y|5.0|Loved It!!! I just love HAPPY endings and this book had just the perfect ending! The more of Danielle Steel' s books I read, the more I love her writing.
B003WE9TU8|3.0|Max Brooks builds on the success of his earlier zombie survival guide with a series of \\"short stories\\" purporting to be S.L.A. Marshall-style personal interviews with heroic, self-sacrificing WWZ survivors, military personnel and political movers-and-shakers. Each cameo is self-contained and unrelated to any other making for a fast-moving read but which does not allow for the character development that, I believe, is a key element of any good zombie yarn.<br /><br />The zombie concept used is carried over from Brooks' earlier work on zombie survival strategies.  I found this unfortunate since living dead who can live without food, water or oxygen in perpetuity is an absurd proposition which, sad to say, jaundiced my perceptions of this Kindle book from the get-go.<br /><br />I liked and appreciated the sparkling philosophic insights offered; for example the notion that no one comes through combat or a holocaust free of moral corruption is one that burned into my mind.  A high level of creativity in picking locations and scenarios was evident at all times.<br /><br />Although Brooks tries hard to make it have global appeal, its Motherhood and Apple Pie American emphasis is strongly evident.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a very fun read. The science was descriptive without bogging down the storyline at all. All of the challenges he faced were realistic and his solutions were believable and quite ingenious. I liked the fact that not all of them worked out quite as planned... And some created worse problems than he was originally trying to solve in the first place.... Very much &#34;real world&#34; science fiction! And the humor used throughout the entire book kept me laughing as I cheered Mark Watney on through every twist and turn.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I got this for my granddaughter for her 17th birthday and she is thrilled with it.  Who doesn't like Taylor Swift?
B006XF5BTG|2.0|Good  stuff, not so good for an \\" old guy like me\\" (one of the issues with E books compared with print)
B000050FEN|1.0|I write this because I can't believe both discs came with errors at reading in different devices, I try my PS3-computer-DVD, all the DVD's can't run on these devices.  Both DVD's even have a scratch they are perfect and unreadable.
B006L9KRHU|5.0|Mr Leeson was a very astonishing individual to have written such a book for us.<br /><br />A self reflective autobiography from a marginalized scene.<br /><br />Very innovative
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|At first it didn't seem interesting but then I got into it and it turned out wonderful. I couldn't put it down...literally. I can't wait for the next edition to come out!!!
1616550414|5.0|If you're a Zelda fan, definitely get this if you can! Or just read it- it's beautiful and reveals so much about the series!
B003UBTX6S|3.0|The book was okay, a really fun read. Not my favorite, but worth a read for light entertainment! Well written, sometimes a bit predictable but that's expected from the subject.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Some great surprises ... amazing action, and though I thought I could guess what would happen next (since I've read every DeMille book) - I couldn't. Bravo, Bravo.
0060594896|5.0|Love it! We looked for a brief second and found this deal, and we have been happy with it with no regrets!
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|If you like Jewel Quest, and those types of games, then this game will keep you entertained for hours.  Re-play is okay with the game getting tougher after the first play-through, but stays at that difficulty level afterwards as far as I could tell.
B00847UYWA|5.0|This starts off with a wild ride in a madman's mind and rolls on into the troubled tales of various artists. It's a wonderful and easy read on anyone's kindle.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Wonderfully set in the current recession, with smart, complicated characters and plot changes that cannot be anticipated. More to think about than just the mystery.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|A classic story told by a master. hard to believe it was written so long ago. one of the books that inspired me to read sci fi. First read in 1973.
B0089LOKHG|2.0|I loved books 1 & 2 and felt okay about the cliffhanger at the end of 2. However, book 3 should not have been the last book in the series because it leaves you completely unsatisfied with an unresolved ending. Oliver characterizes Lena and Hana very well, but completely lacks depth of Alex and Julian's characters. I think I am just going to make up a better ending in my head because Oliver's version is horrible. I hope the tv series has a better ending.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Great movie. My husband and I ordered it and we both really enjoyed it.  I dont watch any movie twice but this one is worth recommending.
B009NOVCU6|5.0|Gift for husband's 50th. He loves The Rolling Stones and the guitarist Keith Richards. Thanks for the special CD box set.
1478343516|1.0|I was excited to receive this book and stared to read it but... although the Table of Contents for this book has page numbers for every chapter, story, etc., the entire book does not have any page numbers. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to navigate to a specific story, etc.<br /><br />Also, the print if quite small and difficult to read....
1600595871|5.0|As soon as I opened this book I knew that I was going to go through it one by one and make every single book. I have many, many books on the art of making books but some of them are too simplistic and others are too technical. This book is just right. The layout is clear and the illustrations are clear and easy to follow.<br /><br />I am so happy to have found this book and I highly recommend it if you are looking for new book structures to create.
B0013ISU0A|5.0|I have just about worn this CD out since I purchased it 2-3 months ago. This is the REM I love. Socially conscious, real life music that makes you think.  It just sounds GOOD.  Listening to it you can hear elements of Automatic and Monster but yet it's not a repeat of their old material.  If you're looking for an album that really, really rocks, this is it!<br /><br />I recommend this album and now I wish I had gotten the version with the DVD! You won't be disappointed!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Great app p and easy t o use for a non tech ie like me .  Contains all the editing basics. And kneels them in a logical ORDER.<br />KUDOS TAO the author for a serviceable product.
B007REV4YI|5.0|50 years and one billion dollars -- a tribute to the series of one of the greatest characters in books and film ever.
1401324649|1.0|Amusing as this story is, I can't bring myself to care about the characters. They're all flat, particularly Allan, who, like Forrest Gump, seems to bungle into a historical event every 5 minutes. But whereas Gump laughed, cried, fell in love, got mad, and in short, was human, Allan never seems to care much about anything. Nothing bothers or scares him, and he loves no one. It's not important to him that he has solved the central problem of developing an atom bomb, or became friends with Harry Truman. His stay in a Siberian prison is just \\"less uncomfortable\\" than crossing the Himalayas. Ditto his pals, who rollick up and down Sweden, unconcerned that the police and underworld are after them. People just aren't LIKE that.<br />This book should have been the \\"Wizard of Oz\\" of assisted living. Instead, it's a bore. You read on, but only to find out what happens next.<br />For the same sort of black comedy feel, but with lots more heart, I recommend the book Penelope by E.V. Cunningham (Howard Fast), about a bored woman who decides to rob her husband's bank. Or the movie Kind Hearts And Coronets, with Dennis Price and Alec Guinness.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It wasn't as good as the first one , but I'd read it again. It was a little too violent and bloody for my taste, but it was pretty good.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Very nice plot, you just can't stop reading it, awesome ending.<br />You have to be careful though, you will want to buy the last book after this one
B008220DGE|1.0|I cannot understand how the voters of the acadamy for Oscars could sit through this peice of trash much less nominate it for any awards. It is not only boring,. It is also nasty. Turned it off after 40 minutes of waiting for it to have some redeeming value. Found none. Maybe there are those who would enjoy this piece boring and on the edge of porn movie, but I think it is more posturing to say it is art. Not much of a plot. A lot of nonsencical dialog. Amy Adams is wasted in this part. Makes ever her look trashy and I have liked everyting else I have seen her in. It should be beneath these wonderful actors to perform in such low scum.
B0017VT5E8|5.0|In the 70s, there was a trend to make a lot of gritty, ultra-realistic, downbeat, depressing films.  Rocky went against that trend and told a story of one man trying to better himself and capture the American Dream.  The music is terrific and the positive, can-do spirit of the movie is what gave it 5 sequels and has made it such a classic even today.
0316224588|4.0|Thank goodness that Ian Rankin returned to Rebus, and the character he did best. Is this as good as the earlier books in the series? Yes and no as like all series there are good ones and not quite so. You should start at the beginning, not jump into the series here to understand the characters. I enjoyed his meanderings in the NE of Scotland, a favorite are of mine which brought back recollections of several trips to that area. I do wish that Rankin had revisited some of his earlier characters besides Siobhan and Cafferty and redeveloped them and part of the reason it was given a 4 star. Lets hope that the next ones work well too as I think the author's non Rebus books are lousy
B009E3EY38|4.0|Let me start by saying this would be a five star rating were it not for the absolutely horrible packaging.  The splines to retain the CD are not compressable.  It feels like you are going to crack the CDs when you remove them from the splines.  I have experienced this with all of the &#34;Digipac&#34; style.  Saving the environment is fine, but you can make a more user friendly spline.  End of rant.<br /><br />Now to the good stuff.  I am glad this concert is finally available in its entirety.  Perhaps the most sought after ticket in rock history was this concert.  I was surprised by Plant's performance.  He opened for The Who a number of years ago and I was not impressed.  I was equally disappointed with his performance at Live Aid where he missed noted and Jimmy was sloshed out of his gord. Page has lost some of his flare (he is getting old), but has gained some precision that was lacking during his more &#34;wild&#34; years.  Jason Bonham does his father proud.  Jones' bass is solid as usual.  If you are a Zeppelin fan, this was the moment that we all waited for since Bonham's death.<br /><br />The CD audio quality is first rate and the BluRay concert film is very good short some cheesy 70's retro video gimmicks.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I was completely involved in this book from the start.  Richard Ford is a wonderful writer and I will be looking for more of his work.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't think the second book could live up to the excellence of the first book but thus one will not let you down!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I really enjoy the over sized buttons.  It's a solid app and I've had no issues with it on kindle fire hd.
B009AMALLM|5.0|Many people downplay the whole Paranormal Activity series, but Its a genius concept and does what not many horror films can do and that's build that suspense, where you think something is going to happen and when it doesn't your disappointed but when it does it hits hard and fast. Its almost predictable, however its predictability is not always what you think.  Just enjoy it for what it is &#34;an entertaining date movie&#34; A Great movie for a day or weekend with friends...maybe out in the woods in a cabin?
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|decent graphics.  challenging without being impossible.  easy to skip over unwanted conversations.  map feature makes it easier to keep track
0399256385|5.0|Bought this for my Nephew for his 1st Birthday and wish I would have ordered one for my Daughter too! She might not let him have it now! I also ordered Spot Loves His Daddy and that ones adorable too! Love spot!
0006486118|5.0|Every bit as compelling as the first four and I've read them all.  Couldn't put it down.  Can't wait for Book 6.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is one of the best dramas I've ever watched.  Love the characters and the situations they get themselves into!
B004J1DBJI|5.0|This is basically a super computer. You just type in any topic and tons of information comes up. You get current events for cities and much more. I would recommend this app to anyone that is taking pre-algebra or higher as a calculator and just as a computer or google replacement to anyone. After downloading the app, I realize I would have paid maybe $5 or $10 for this!
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a book that keeps you interested all along its way. It is also a lesson to parents who blindly overprotect their children to the point that they let them do whatever they want, and worst of all, these children lead their parents into absurd attitudes (as in this case when the father gets rid of the probable murder weapon!) that get them involved in not desirable situations.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Well written, funny, sarcastic, believable.  The perfect sci-fi book ... thought the hero would make a good Firefly crew member!
0763644765|5.0|My son is not yet old enough to care about the potty besides he doesn't seem to care about having a dirty diaper for any amount of time, but he has a fun time reading this book with me.
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|Tootsie is one of those classic comedies that is in the same class as Some Like It Hot.  Just wonderful.
B0057GUD7C|2.0|Unfortunately this is not for US customers and there was no mention of Canadian customers only. The Digital copy does not work in the US. The sells did the right thing by crediting back the difference.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|it is never updated on my Kindle Fire.  Seems to work fine with Microsoft products.  I keep trying to sync and it always fails.
B00881VLCE|2.0|Not much fun, actually; few choices of puzzles & same general shape of pieces. Young kids might like it though.
B009K0P10K|5.0|This show is very different and very captivating. I wish they would make more episodes because I hate repeats. This was a good idea for a storyline.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is amazing with all the features and abilities! Shows and feeding is very fun too. u can buy stuff for your horse
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Lots of levels and get harder as you go.  Wish the screen would change more often. Makes you want to keep trying to improve.
0765325950|5.0|Excellent ending. Brought the series, characters and plot back together for the finale. Loved the series, sorry to see it end. Thanks Mr. Jordan for the last 10+ years of reading enjoyment and thanks Mr. Sanderson for finishing off for him. Well done!
B004P68T30|4.0|My 3 year old daughter loves this book. When I say an app for it, I had to get it for her. She loves watching the kindle as it reads to her and touching various things and seeing the words pop up. My only issue is that when you try to turn pages yourself, you have to click on the screen a few times before it moves. Kind of annoying when your toddler has a short attention span.
B000BU0C98|4.0|It is a good album, lots of fun to hear the live show.  It was, however, pretty light weight.  This was a bit disappointing, but I would still recommend it.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Suits is the best show on TV. Every episode is captivating! Its story line is so different and creative. I love all the characters.
B0013K1ALE|5.0|Awesome DVD. I love seeing Jimmy Rockin on that guitar...oh man...If I only live in the 70's. =) And Robert Plants performance and vocals are amazing. If you do not feel like going out on a Saturday night and you feel like rocking, put this bad boy in and bring the concert to you! lol =)
B001UTW7QU|4.0|The show is somewhat confusing and difficult to follow at times, but for the most part, it is very entertaining.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I'm a fan of his shows and a now a fan of his books... .. . . . . . .
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Love this game!!! Can't wait for the new one to come out! Kept me busy and interested the entire time!
B002P3RCVU|3.0|The album itself is fine, it has a great selection of tracks.  The downside is that the vinyl is very lightweight, and the sleeve is very plain.
B0053O89WY|5.0|What else do I need to say? It's hilarious, and so much fun to watch over and over again.  My only complaint is that there are only so many episodes per season.
6305428425|5.0|Me and my friends had sleepovers back when I was ion Middle School and we would pop in this movie. Brings back old memories.
B004JN1CW4|4.0|It is a great book but it is disappointing at the beginning. I really wanted Thomas to get his memory back though.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Absolutely  amazing  I can't say much more GRRM has done another fantastic job I thought the idea of telling only half of the characters stories was in many ways brilliant
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn cannot write enough! I am never disappointed as every book is gripping and filled with awesome twists and turns.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I enjoy the movie, but I really LOVE the music.  I own the sound track and wanted to own the movie because I plan on writing movie scores.  I am a composer.  Yep.

B004EPZ06G|5.0|You know how usually the sequels to movies get pretty lame? Yeah not this one. I'm excited to see the 3rd!!
B000FC1KGG|5.0|I bought this book after seeing the movie that was based on it.  The movie was quite good but the book brings greater depth to the tale.  Readers of all ages will fiind not only magic but gentle lessons within its pages.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run 2 is so much better than the first because you have many more places such as mines and thing to do such as ziplining.
B000VX1CFS|4.0|excelente producto, responsables, el envio se hizo dentro de lo estimado por el vendedor. todo bien, lo recomiendo 100%,<br />gracias.
B007THA4FI|2.0|This book for me was just not quite up to speed, it leaves a lot that is just missing and what that is, is anyone's guess.  Their was no excitement, intrigue or mystery for me.  Not sure what I was expecting but this book did not deliver it.  That said my prayer is that others will love it.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This story is many layered, I found myself thinking about it long after I had finished the book.  It is a great compliment to the movie, or is that the other way around ?  A great read it will stay with you.
B000VBJ504|4.0|I bought this album because it was $4 and because of &#34;Live and Let Die&#34; and &#34;November Rain.&#34; Both of those songs are fantastic and worth buying the album for. The rest of the album is pretty good, but I think a little inconsistent. There are some other good songs on the album, especially near the end, but not as many as you'd expect from an album this long.
034580404X|5.0|I have shared these book with family and friend.<br />I loved the three book trilogy and that they was all packaged together.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Easy to use and works great with the Kindle Fire. I would rather use the app over the website. Also links with paypal.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Rihanna never seems to disappoint. You can listen to the whole cd without skipping a song. Her best yet. Most definitely 5 stars.
1609613937|1.0|I can't blame the book but this way of eating is not something I would care to do for long enough to see results.<br />I wish I had not ordered it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think the  book was excellently written. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good story. It has a little bit of everything in it, love drama and action. An easy read. Didn't want to put the book down
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I gave this book the rating I did because this author has the guts to go in directions I have not come to expect from most fantasy writers. The characters in his story are gritty and realistic in that they act in a manner you would expect from real people not the rose colored glasses characters you see in most books. I am quite certain I have never read another story where a son kills his father in a helpless rage (after countless years of verbal and emotional abuse) while Dad is sitting on the toilet. I guarantee that if you read this series you won't be disappointed.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I just bought this game and now it wont download! WTF! Hate this game so much! I do kot recommend anuone else getting ripped off
B0002VKZL6|3.0|I am a die hard Mark Knopfler fan who has bought all of his albums starting with Sailing to Philadelphia up to Privateering, his newest release. I then went back and bought this album, which came out between Ragpicker's Dream and Kill to Get Crimson. While there are some very good tunes here and the album is solid overall, I don't like this album as much Mark's other albums because many of the songs tended to be mellower and while there is some variety in the song styles here, it is not as varied as some other records.  You can chalk that up to Knopfler setting a high standard.<br /><br />Here are my favorite tunes on the album:<br /><br />Boom, Like That: I always laugh when I hear the opening line of this song because it sounds like Knopfler stole a line from a Sinatra tune (I'm going to San Bernardino/Ring-a-ding-ding)..its a great line to start a great song about how Ray Kroc created the McDonald's franchise..who would have thought someone could write a song about this? However, Knopfler pulls it off in vintage Dire Straits sounding style..seems like each of his albums has one song that makes you say,\\"That's a Dire Straits song.\\" Well, this is it..a great tune with a hammering electric guitar sound<br /><br />The Trawlerman's Song: Knopfler continues his fascination with the sea<br /><br />Song For Sonny Liston: the tale of boxer Sonny Liston who lost the title to Muhammad Ali..narrated to a blues beat<br /><br />Postcards From Paraguay: this is my favorite song next to Boom, Like That.  The song has a great latin beat.  I wish Knopfler wrote more songs with a latin sound, but I won't complain because I love his huge catalogue of songs with a celtic sound<br /><br />All That Matters: appears to be a touching ode to Knopfler's children with beautiful acoustic fingerpicking<br /><br />Donegan's Gone: Knopfler's ode to english skiffle king, Lonnie Donegan, played to a rootsy/country/blues beat<br /><br />The remaining songs fall into a mellow category without muchvariety.  Once again, not a bad effort, but not as good as some of his other albums.<br /><br />Check out my reviews of his other albums if you are interested. Hope the reviews help.
034580404X|5.0|product was excellent, arrived promptly, was still sealed, nobody cant complain with this type of quality. although i think the box they came in was a little bigger than necessary, but who's to blame for that...
B007REV4T8|3.0|Overall, I liked this movie, but it's certainly not my favourite Bond flick. The biggest bummer for me was that they took what could have been an excellent story line, and very decent screenplay, and with the addition of few over-the-top Hollywood inclusions the movie went from excellent to average. Instead of continuing with the fundamentally flawed but genuine Bond from Casino Royale, that Daniel Craig portrayed so diliegently, the producers decided to revert to the less-than-believeable and egotistical Bond from the Roger Moore days. You think they would have learnt their lessons.<br /><br />Bottom line: potential to be great but too much cheese, rubbish stunts, and unbelievability.
B004RPKUTU|5.0|So much better than the dumb movie. I LOVE this book! I am so glad I own it so I can read it whenever I want
B000007MVD|4.0|I was unsure what to expect with this, but as a lover of early Beatles music, I was not disappointed.<br />These tracks were recorded before the Lennon-Mccartney team really got going, so there are a lot of R&B standards on here, for example, solid renditions of 'Carol', 'Johnny B. Goode', 'Lucille' etc.  Even the Crickets' 'Please don't ever change' is given the treatment.  Unfortunately, there is some dross here also, but this does little to detract from the overall enjoyment of the double disc set.
B000YENUI6|5.0|This movie is fantastic. It's the perfect mix of mob, mystery, and violence! I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys crime dramas.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|the fire is really nice. Fell asleep to this one several times.  Very relaxing.  Nice sound choices. I picked it up as the free app of the day and am so happy i did! I love it and is one of the better ones out there. :)
B00AFEY354|5.0|one of my favorite movie.  best actors. love the quotes<br />we accept the love we think we deserve<br />we are infinite~
B005LAIIPS|5.0|This is a terrific movie. I thought Jeremy Renner wouldn't be able to follow in the footsteps of Matt Damon, but he was quite a surprise and performed admirably. Rachel Weisz was excellent too. I thought she played her character with considerable nouse - plus she's very easy on the eyes. An innovative continuation from the original Bourne movies, filmed with the same slick acton sequences that are both gripping and believable. Awesome storyline and the inclusion of Edward Norton was a master stroke.<br /><br />Bottom line: a top shelf movie that doesn't lose its edge even after watching it twenty times (like I have).
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This book keeps you interested. I liked that there where a few surprises in it. Good character description as well. It was a good read.
B000E1NWGO|5.0|These recordings hail from 1963, and this disc contains the 'Moonlight', 'Appassionata', 'Les Adieux', and 'Pathetique', played by one of the great pianists of the age-Arthur Rubinstein.  Here RCA used a 3 track approach, and the remastering is excellent.  This is just as well, as the interpretations deserve nothing less.  Some may find them a little overly romantic, but they suit me very well.
B000002OR4|5.0|I love, love, love this soundtrack. I am a huge Schindler's List fan, and I am equally infatuated with the film's soundtrack. It is haunting, beautiful, and emotional.
1781161313|5.0|Any fan of the Aien movies needs one of these. The manual contains some really great info and illustrations of the movie Aliens
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I watched this with my granddaughter and we both liked it. She is a total Batman fanatic. I liked the back story to it and everything you learned that way, even though some of it was a bit disturbingly dark.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I love this movie - it's a new favorite!  Pitch Perfect is funny, has great music, and leaves you with the warm & fuzzies.
B004I744AS|4.0|still testing it out but from what i have dabbled in very effecient and functional.  still working in the thesaurus.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's a real fun game git me hooked right in to it. I like it. Spend my time on break playing it
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I am enjoying catching up on the old episodes.  It was a total treat before season 3 started.  Love it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was one of the best books I have read in a long time. This book made me laugh and sometimes made me cry. I recommend this book to people who love a love story and an adventure at the same time. The mockingjay was one of the most inspiring book to me to keep going and do what's right and we shouldn't fight amongst ourselves, but we should love and care for eachother.
B00A83075M|5.0|This is a wonderfully delightful, funny movie for people of all ages! It doesn't matter if you're 5, 25, or 45 there will be something in this movie for you! Now-a-days there aren't very many movies that manage to be truly \\"family\\" movies. It has video games, racing, candy, humor, a love story, heart-stopping action, a villain, aliens, a hero, and lessons to be learned. What more could you possibly ask for? lol
1451695195|5.0|Excellent book in perfect shape.  We're discussing it in a Lenten study and are finding it very interesting.  Recommend it to all.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Amazing show that draws you in and makes you want to watch for hours. Surprising turn of rents this season and so tragic!
014050639X|5.0|This is a great book for sharing with grandkids (2, 3, and 5).  They had fun finding the hidden pictures.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to play, with different options. Ads are not too annoying, they pop up once before you start to play. I don't have the &quot;hijacking&quot; that some are reporting, the ads stay within the game as described above.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I could not put this book down.<br />It is not often that a book keeps my interest and this book certainly did.<br />I cant wait to read the next two books.
B0014LX420|4.0|I like that this album incorporates all of my favorites. For all Britney fans. A must have item indeed for sure.
B004DM0UII|5.0|In the begining I was a little hesitant about purchasing the app and I'm happy I did, try it and you won't be disappointed.
B006ATJXQW|4.0|This book takes you back 13 years before the Maze Runner book.  I thought the \\"dreams\\" of what happened during the flares were done very well.  I really enjoyed the flashbacks/dreams.<br /><br />The main part of the story was good, but not great (in my opinion).  While a small part of the story might be vital to the series in general (I won't spoil it for anyone), it is only a small part.  Kind of overkill.<br /><br />The only other minor complaint is that not many answers are given.  I was expecting a lot more answers.<br /><br />Another good part of the book is that it can stand alone...if you don't read the prologue and epilogue.  If this is the first book in the series you read...the first and last chapter will only confuse you.  Otherwise, it is a good place to start.<br /><br />Thanks to the author for another awesome book.
0060245867|5.0|This is a great book to read aloud to young children.  The game in the back is a fun addition.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Only thing stupid is there is a \\"don't show this again\\" button that doesn't do a thing until hopefully after I write this review so it won't show it again.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|The plot twisted through the book but it took me a while to get into the story. The ending was too neat.
B008JOLG7U|4.0|I liked that this album includes her most popular songs from other albums and songs that I personally like. This is for all JLo fans. A must have.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|I rarely purchase apps, but was aggravated because I could not find a calendar that  would sync with my google account  i paid $6 for an app for my 8.9\\" Kindle and the calendar is so tiny i cant read it without zooming in.  I also have many of my calendar entrys are duplicated, the app constantly crashes!  I expect more from a $6 calendar.  I have seen free apps do better besides the syncing feature. When zoomed in it is very sluggish, not user friendly when adding events or editing entrys.  I would love to have a refund but i know thats not an option, so I'll just suck it up to a loss.
1402786360|5.0|This book is beautiful!!! and so cleverly written.  How special to write a book containing art instructions and using art techniques in so many ways to make beautiful food.  I love that there are so many pictures of the processes and the finished products.  Very well done.  Many kudos to Heather Baird for her talents and abilities.
0316236535|5.0|I purchased this book for my grandson.  He absolutely loved it.  We read it over and over again.  It is his favorite book.  He is 4 years old.
B000TU16GS|5.0|I loved it it was very very very very very awesome ..........gun is awesome you are awesome everyone is awesome
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Now that's what I call an amazing read! Wow! Read it! I can't really find the words to explain. The book is so well written I feel as though I shouldn't write another word until I take a writing class.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|My son recently returned home from Germany serving an LDS (Mormon) mission. He was introduced to this game and asked for it for Christmas. My wife and I had played before so we got it for him. It's a great game. Rules are pretty easy to understand and game play is relatively quick. A great game overall!
B007THA4FI|3.0|I kept reading because I wanted to finally get it.  I don't think I did but maybe that was the point?
0062238310|5.0|We've having a grand time taking the roles among friends. &#34;I think he's dead. No, I know he's dead.&#34; LOL.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a very good story.  Likable characters, set in a time I knew little about.  You are truly rooting for the underdog.  I'm gald I found this book.  I'd like to read more of this author's work.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the performance of Maggie Smith, and the struggle with progress for the old guard.  Having an American in the mix makes it more interesting.
B005LAII8K|5.0|Love time travel movies?  - you will like this flick.  Listen to the Kevin Smith podcast (smoviemakers) with the director for more insight into the making of this film.
1250027624|5.0|I absolutely love this series. I have watched it since the beginning. I have all three seasons. Having the book to get the background on everything in the series is wonderful.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|I downloaded this on my grandson's Kindle Fire, and got the \\"no connection\\" error message.  Then, inexplicably, it began to work and he loves it.  My granddaughter decided she wanted it on her Kindle Fire, so I downloaded it, tried opening the game, it wanted to download some more files, I let it download, tried opening the game, it started the download over again...you get the picture.  We haven't been able to make it work yet on my granddaughter's Kindle Fire, and why it works on my grandson's is a mystery.  I sure hope the bugs get ironed out soon...it's frustrating for the kids not to be able to play something that looks so interesting.

B000M5AJQI|5.0|I received this DVD as a Christmas present and have enjoyed viewing it.  Great actors in the movie, happy to have it.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|I had very high expectations for this book given the near perfect reviews. Unfortunately I found it falling short. The story was ok, despite the various \\"twists\\" which I found predictable, and I found that I did not care what happened to any of the characters by the end. Dont get me wrong; it is a great accomplishment for a self-published author, but this book has been highly overrated.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Bought this for the blu ray and the digital copy - don't need the 3d version.  Still cheaper than buying the plain blu ray and the digital copy from Apple.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I absolutely love this series! I have all three seasons. I have enjoyed being able to watch them at my own pace.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I found this game very fun and challenging and addictive. So far i have seen nothing bad about it at all.
B00BN0BZVY|4.0|I find this book to be a little endearing and a little crazy. All the same, it makes you fall in love with the leading character on his outrageous journey to deal with his past and embrace his future.
B002ZG99NG|5.0|Great movie, great actors, nice DVD.  My wife and I really enjoyed the movie and we are glad to have it in our &#34;library&#34;.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is SO awesome! It has a lot more and harder obsticals. Again This game id one of the best!!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Will keep you entertained for hours on end. Lots of new levels more challenges and the same old pigs doing their thing.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a very addictive and entertaining game, it is simple to learn, and provided hours of entertainment. Highly recommend!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I love Lana Del Ray's music! Her voice is haunting and lyrics are intense. She is an amazing talent, no auto-tune here....
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I like the game but am disappointed in that when I upgraded I lost all my coins and my progress.  I cannot seem to get my things back
0060556501|5.0|I ordered two copies for my 4 and 5 year old grandchildren.  Tells the story in<br />very age-appropriate language and a condensed version.<br />Beautiful illustrations.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I don't know from other cases, just this one. It's small, light weight and feels as if it really can protect from small drops. Also, I use the little prop-it-up flap all the time - i wouldn't know what i'd do without it. very recommendable.
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|Pretty good.  It was suspenseful and kept you worrying about how and who would go next.  Seeing the mosnter causing it all was a let down.  He could've been vaporized in a number of ways.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|can't wait to see all of season 2 and 3. then i will wait anxiously for season 4. the characters and plot are fabulous. the acting and suspense is fabulous and the camera angles and cinematography is superb!
0385334206|5.0|Easy to read, with plenty of clever wordplay and humor to keep you coming back for more. Vonnegut even throws himself into the story, and hits on some deeply personal things in the process. Not just a silly story, there are real issues to be confronted among the characters, and Vonnegut does his best to make every character as important as the next.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Loved how it was overall a clean movie - if they could've just completely left out the profanity it would be that much better.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This is a really fun game, and my 5 year old really loves to play the different levels. It provides enough of a challenge for her. However, I wish they didn't have the pop up windows asking if we want to unlock something more with a cost to it. She does a great job tapping the 'X' to close the window, but I'm afraid she'll accidently push something and purchase it. I just wish there was a way to turn off those options.
B004XDYJRU|1.0|The most recent update will not install. I used this app all the time before. I have emailed support about this with no response. Will update review if it ever gets repaired.
B001C4CI8A|5.0|This movie couldn't miss in terms of its' authentic portrayal of how it is.  This due the collaboration with David Ignatius on substance and Leo DiCaprio as the star.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Would give it a 5 except for the ads that require a reset to play. Works great once you get to play.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|I didn't want the book to end it was incredible<br />I loved every single line and word in this book
B0071XO8RA|5.0|SO WELL WRITTEN. Finally a story I hated to put down!  I really enjoyed this book and did not want it to end!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I understand the concept of advertising, but when letting my 5 year old use it, it just got to be too much, so I uninstalled this and purchased the came to avoid this. Fun game though, when the advertisements weren't in the way!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've never felt so many emotions while reading a book. This book is funny, uplifting, heart renching, and so much more! I recommend this title to anyone over the age of 14. Best book I've EVER read.
B00008QSA5|5.0|This is good, it is raw, and it is pure as a music form.  Here's a case of Al Kooper hearing and finding the talent in the guitarists and making music with them.  The music was simplist in it's production focusing on the musician's ability.  This is another classic in rock because these guys were stil exploring and as yet to fully define themselves into a particular genre.  Or may be the genre had not yet been fully developed.  At least it deos not appear that some studio told thekm what they were.
B000006OS2|2.0|Delivery service by the vendor was very good and the DVD arrived in excellent condition.  Unfortunately it was copied from a worn out film with numerous dropouts and constant full screen scratches.  All characters have ghosting creating a slightly out of focus effect and there are numerous distracting changes in the intensity of the background lighting.  At the low price it is not cost effective returning to the vendor but I suggest you look elsewhere for copies of what is an otherwise excellent John Wayne movie.
B00BHMF578|5.0|This movie contains exceptional acting, a great script and the overall choice of actors could not be any better.  This was a great movie about true events most of us never knew happened.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|frankly i didnt think i was going to like this movie but i loved it! i do like Kristen Stewart and she played this role well, exactly how id expect one to act under what has happened in her life, loved the other actors as well, graphics were great, plot was well done, kept me hooked threw the movie :)
B001AITGWE|5.0|Great movie all around. Acting, cinematography, story, script, all blend together to give an excellent suspense/ drama film experience.<br />I love this movie.<br />It puts an emphasis on the perspective frames of mind of its lead characters (Micheal Douglas/ Robert Duvall), and draws you in.<br />It actually made me root for the bad guy. :)
1582701709|5.0|Interesting read with a different perspective on love, success, money, and health.<br /><br />Ask, Believe, Receive......<br /><br />Read it and start practicing!
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I bought this because of the song Cheers.  It belongs in the pantheon of drinking songs.  It is evident that Rihanna has the raw talent to put it there.  Watching TV I saw her jamming w/the GoGo Dolls.  She can truly sing.  So, strip away the studio machination and the talent is still there.  This simpliustic ditty is one you can enjoy knowing that.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|A delightful book that gives great reason for the movie. I have always been a fan of the movie and happy to understand now where it came from.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|Deftones always makes good CDs. This Cd is really really good. Must be played at high volumes to really appreciate how good this CD is.
0307592731|5.0|It was funny and such a cool story. I could somehow relate to the author and her needing to be in the wild. It's not too long and definitely a good read. Makes me want to hike the Appalachian trail!

B008220DIC|5.0|P.T. Anderson's latest movie has created a dichotomy among moviegoers. I even recall in the theatre, thinking \\"this movie is epic,\\" while two ladies behind me kept going on about their disdain for it. I hold no disdain for THE MASTER. I found it to be rich and honest in its exploration of humans and their mad culture. Notably, post-war lifestyles. Some may feel discomfort due to their own insecurities on certain topics that shed light in the story. Rarely are movies so multivalent. The acting was rabidly unique, and the soundtrack couldn't have been more perfect.<br /><br />I think mainstream audiences typically crave a mindless story with lots of CGI - I, frankly, am more interested in thoughtful, brave storytelling.<br /><br />Thank you P.T. !
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Got it for my boyfriend who works in the film industry and has several camera parts (I am unfamiliar with the exact names besides lenses and a grip) to carry. He loves it and uses it all of the time, a must have for camera enthusiasts.
B00A8307BG|5.0|Great new addition to Robin Trower's catalog. Some classic songs done with the signature blues touch of Trower. Love everything he does.
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I rate this book a 5 star as it provides the reader with a systematic approach to simplifying and streamlining everything in life. It not only instructs the reader in all the \\"how to\\" in regards to declutter, get rid of things that are no longer useful or beautiful, question every purchase, and other no nonsense advice but to look more forgiving on oneself as it is okay to recognize when something is \\"good enough\\" or places limit on psychological clutter and over doing it in other areas beyond home and office. Minimalistic schedules and personal outlook is also very freeing and refreshing. I recommend this to anyone who is seeking the peace that Francine Joy described through her minimalist philosophy.
B008645YEE|5.0|was a birthday gift for my boyfriend, and he loved it. Perfect, and it was in excellent condition! Love it!
B007REV4YI|5.0|I loved the action! and the actors this was a great movie, i think im beginning to be a Daniel Craig fan..I cant wait for the next one to come out!
B004T4KQJS|5.0|Although as a non-physicist I had a great deal of trouble following the specifics of many of his points, I really appreciated getting a glimpse into the amazing and exceedingly complex world of contemporary cosmology. So much of what we take for granted is so very inaccurate, like that something cannot emerge from nothing, and it is a privilege to be allowed to look behind the curtain to see &#34;reality&#34; for what it really is. Beautiful and startling, even if it is only quasi-comprehensible to a non-scientist.
B00008IHN1|5.0|Love this movie! I had looked for it on a movie rental site and could not get it.  Decided to buy it for myself, and got a good price and great service from Amazon!
1423140605|5.0|my son loved this book, it took him no time to read it but he really enjoyed it i would recommend
B007V4530A|3.0|Nothing awe inspiring, but some great insight and reminders about the art of presentation. I enjoy TED talks so I enjoyed this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Incredible.<br />There aren't many writers who make me feel like I owe it to them to read their acknowledgments but John Green did that with this book. Absolutely amazing.
B00AFEY354|5.0|BEST MOVIE EVER! I read the book and its just amazing. Its my favorite movie! The actors really portrayed their parts.

B00A7OIXW6|5.0|I had very high hopes for this movie being a long term gamer throughout my life. So needless to say, I went in expecting a great movie. What I came out with, still blew me away. I was just absolutely amazed at just how well done this movie was. The animation, the music, the story, the characters, just everything was so beautifully crafted and well done.<br /><br />The one thing I was concerned about was that it would end up being corny and just a bad attempt at being funny, but man was that shot down almost immediately. You'll laugh, you'll catch brilliantly planted references to gaming both new and old, you'll even tear up. It's very difficult not to want to give this movie an overwhelming amount of praise. It truly is an immediate classic.<br /><br />This was the first and so far the only movie by Disney, made by a 3D studio that isn't associated with Pixar, that I can honestly say lives up to the Disney name. Fantastic job. This is the Disney I knew and loved as a kid. This is the Disney I want to see more of.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Documentary film that's similar in format to the PBS series \\"American Masters\\", but has the magical qualities of a charming tale like the film \\"Once\\".  Rodriquez' songs from 1970 to 1973, like the early folk songs of Bob Dylan, have a timeless, enduring quality.  The sentiments expressed by everyone interviewed are so profoundly healt-felt and filled with emotion that I became overwhelmed with joyful tears several times.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As always the book is better than the movie. A must read for anyone looking for their next page turner.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This game has nice graphics and a good story line. Easy to follow in-game help button, makes a walk through unnecessary. Looking forward to Enigmatis 2.
B0002B15XI|3.0|I originally bought this dvd for a friend who had trouble finding it and is a huge mash fan but as for myself i didnt really care for it much.
B0000026UV|5.0|Back in high school, I had a friend  who could listen to the radio or records and then play the songs by ear. When a local band needed a bass player, he took the 6 strings off of his Fender Telecaster and strung it with 4 bass strings. He raved about \\"how great Chet Atkins is.\\"<br />My response was, \\"huh? That country boy? No way.\\"<br />Fast forward 23 years and another friend sent me Neck and Neck, my first real exposure to Atkins. It opened my ears, listening to the mentor tutoring his upstart pupil Mark Knopfler.<br />They trade licks and vocals in what sounds more like a couple of good friends sitting on the porch with guitars in laps and feet propped up than 2 of 1990's best guitarists working in a studio to document a fusion of Atkins' unmatched finger picking and Knopfler's notes that seem to sing as they travel from fret to pickup to amp to tape to CD.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|This was our first ever bluray purchase and experience. Fantastic. Quickly shipped and very very good price. If I were rating the movie, I would give it five stars to.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|When I first heard this book was coming out, I was against it.  But after reading it, I believe it was written properly and with the best of intentions.  This story has been, and will continue to be told for years to come.  After spending nine years of my life serving my country, after 9/11, it was satisfying to read the first hand account of the killing of Osama bin Laden.  I would rather hear it from the guy with boots on the ground than from a Intel report that has been prepared by an analyst that has never been to Afghanistan.  I do not feel that the author comprised any future operational, intelligence or national security information with the writing of this book.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has served in the military, or who has a loved one who has served.
B0064W65SO|5.0|A grate action comic with mystery and love it shows how batman cam to be,how his parents were killed,and the first crimes batman fought.
B001N4RORE|5.0|Wow. I love ABBA and the movie, Mamma Mia has so much energy. The music is so moving and how it expresses life. I could sing along as loud as I wanted to.
B007H7XJD4|5.0|This is just very cool to watch. Don't let poor reviews disuade you from watching this movie if you're a sci-fi or fantasy fan.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|All I can say about this cd.......Shes the best singer ever and makes every song sound wonderful. Love all her music
B000YAA68C|5.0|I love this movie for the romance and great story.  Loved seeing Ireland in the movie.  And the people there.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved the story it was very interesting fast delivery i would definetly recommend this Trilogy. I love to read and it comes on my Amazon Kindle the best item i've ever bought
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Had I known that this CD was not going to ship until my Sarah Brightman became available, I would not have ordrered the two of them at the same time.  However, thanks to the fact that I did order other things just recently, this album was shipped with it. And anything by Andrea Bocelli is amazing!  He has a beautiful voice and there is everything to love about this CD.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This story takes one back to a time of  the glory days as my late father would say. The love of a boy and his animal transends time and war. I was spell bound and didn't put it down until I finished it. I still think kindly of the words of wisdom within the book.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This show was very addicting! We couldn't stop watching it. We are looking forward to watching the next season for sure.
0920668372|5.0|Great baby shower idea - purchase some children's books to start off their library and help a child be successful early with reading.  Add a custom personalized rubber stamp with their name to mark their books:  [...]
B003WMA7BU|3.0|I liked the movie and decided to read the book, it was very comparable. It was a little too easy of a read.
0897502027|5.0|Great Book for fans of Bruce! I've seen alot of books about Jeet Kune Do, but this one is the best!
079284131X|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite movies of all time. I had to get it for my collection. It came fairly quickly and although it had a few scratches on it it played perfectly. I am satisfied. I will be purchasing from this company again.
B007UR1OHO|5.0|Soft and tender like gentle rain on a warm day. Another movie with rewared focus on a goal. I loved the movie but loved the book even more.  Loved the layed back characters.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Definitely worth the read, even if it is somewhat of a depressing book. John Green is a really amazing writer.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Love it, love it,love it,one of the best books I have ever read<br />:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think subway surfers is a wonderful game but I think that should make the super jackpot more.likely to get. They should also make clothing for the people but other than that it's a great game and should be like, 99¢
B00632HWOG|3.0|I use other services since my accounts do not get hijacked by spammers or other non authorized users. Need to fix that.
0316228532|5.0|I found myself pulled into the nuances of the relationships among the central characters.  Some events unfolded as expected while others were a complete surprise.  Great reading.
B003KRGCTI|5.0|To think, this may be the way of the future. This movie demonstrates man's ability to destroy society as we know it while leaving one with hope. I loved the determination of Denzel Washington and his focus on his quest.
B005ZO6NRA|1.0|The acting wasn't good.  The script was worse.  A low IQ affair.  I wanted the two hours of my life back.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|If you like TUNE IN RADIO,U will love the PRO version it lets you record and playback on your time.......FANTASTIC WORTH THE $1.00.
B00005N5RM|5.0|This film is a classic and I couldn't have bought this and been disappointed especially for under 20 dollars. Classics are classics and some just need to be a part of every movie lovers collection, this is definitely one of those movies.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Great Story, loveable characters, amazing music, so many retro video game characters ... what more can you ask for?  A truly feel good movie!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I'll admit it, I was a bit hesitant to read this one, considering all the hype from the recent movie, but I was not in the least disappointed. The book has a conversational realness that keeps you turning page after page. Highly recommended for any young, college aged, or adult reader, this piece gives scope and a gritty candidness to coming of age in the 21st century.
B000W799NU|5.0|I love the movie it is really good and almost finishes my Harry Potter movie collection and I really enjoy the movies

B007REV4YI|5.0|Good movie wrapper. Good movie. Easy access to digital movies on itunes and ultraviolet. Special features are a must watch.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|Obviously this is a bit cheesy but i still really like it! And Disney has used this music in most of their promotional commercials!
B00164GDD2|5.0|fast shipping and fast email response when i contacted the seller. incredible classic movie in high def and content to finally own this film! i was even more happier to have received this film with the slip case that is rare to find now. would buy from this seller again!!! great service!
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Once again Ken Follett has written a book that is hard to tear yourself away from... On to the next one.
B000W7FDBM|5.0|I really like the first movie  it starts my Harry Potter movie collection and the movie is great I like it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game it is so realistic. The only thing is is its very hard to earn coins fast and there energy takes a while as well other than that this game is awesome.
B004MC8CA2|2.0|I was so excited to hear of this production, but I feel that a lot of what is important was left out. before it rained 40 days and nights the people were warned, but they had never seen rain.  just such as that was left out, the ground was dry where Moses part the waters, you showed it muddy. God dryed the ground for them to travel on, that also shows his great power, this was not important? little things make a difference. Just so that people who do not know God, or about God  understand  there is a lot more details to the story. Don't tell the story of Little Red Ridding Hood and leave out the Grandmother??<br /><br />If the story is worth telling please tell it right.
B00005QZ7U|5.0|This is the most ORIGINAL movie i have seen. Now although this is one of my favorite movies, the first time i watched it i was not impressed till it got half way through the movie! It starts with a typical 90's movie style slapstick comedy. But all of the sudden halfway through it gets SO serious and will have you at the Edge of your seats! You will need to see it a few times. There are SO many twist, but at the same time it tells you EVERY SINGLE DETAIL before you see it! So the more times you see it you realize that it tells you what is about to happen! It may take you a number of times to see it all! ENJOY!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love the graphics and the object searches. Good way to pass the time and story line works for me as well.
