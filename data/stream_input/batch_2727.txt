B004WR125O|5.0|Excellent product, it enabled my receiver to work over my network and opened up a new way of listening to music and controlling my receiver. I would recommend this to any with an network ready onkyo unit!!!
B001RHPJBU|5.0|Phil Collins has the gift of writing and singing his music.  Many of his classics are right here for all to enjoy.  If you like a good dose of up tempo contemporary music ...then Phil has it for you.
B00138J7V6|5.0|One of his best albums! Lyrically crafted, instrumentally played, & vocally sung! Gavin is one of the best musician making incredible music!
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|I was totally engrossed. An amazing epic tale of great imagination and science fiction at its best. I highly recommend it.
B007SGM084|5.0|This Is The Hottest Love Story Ever, While Some Girls Are Waiting For Prince CharmIng, I Would Take Mr.Grey Anyday.
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I just love this show. I love the awkwardness of it all. It's funny and gives so much more then I really thought when I started watching it. I hope season 4 is around the corner!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I started watching season one and got hooked from the first episode. Finished the first season in a week . I'm in the middle of season 2 and haven't been disapointed
0425263924|5.0|Sylvia Day once again did a great job of continuing the story of Gideon and Eva. Her writing makes you feel like you are there in the story! I am looking forward to books 4 & 5, but will be sad when the story ends.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I have read almost all of Nelson DeMille's books and this book did not disappoint! Excellent! A great tale, keeps you wanting more!
B0049H9NVW|4.0|&#34;Takenoko&#34; is a lightweight game that involves more strategy than we suspected, at first, it might. As with games like &#34;Carcasonne,&#34; players build the board as the game is played.  Playing pieces represent a growing garden in which a garden grows bamboo for a panda which, according to the rule book, has been gifted by the Chinese emperor.  Players have goal cards, kept hidden, which earn them points as soon as the conditions are met.  Players can always add goal cards to their hand.  The goal cards are of three varieties:  points earned for growing certain color bamboo stalks to a certain height, points earned for maneuvering the panda in order to eat certain number of bamboo of a certain color and points earned for building board tiles into certain patterns.  Keep an eye on your own goal cards; and, you can build a strategy toward achieving them more or less quickly. Keep an eye on what other players seem to be trying to do; and, you could take an action which benefits yourself AND makes it more difficult for an opponent to achieve his/her goal.  The game ends when one player achieves a certain number (depending on number of players) goals.  That does NOT mean that this particular player wins since a player who achieved fewer but more valuable goals may actually pull out a victory.  Why four stars?  Hardcore gamers will find this one too light.  Casual gamers and families will have great time.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Suffice it to say that although well written  and thought provoking  I was actually upset and dusgusted with the lame and not to be believed dumb ending including the sister's reaction to Nick's decision to stay with his psycho wife so I will never buy another book by this author.
0765325950|5.0|I don't care what anyone says about the series getting bogged down about halfway throught: A Memory of Light was awesome!  It was filled with all the great battles we've been waiting for since the mid-90s.  I can't wait for the next volume in the, er, well, I'll definitely be reading more of Sanderson!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|this game really gets your heart pounding and is an intense game and the multiplayer is insane, if you watch the video trailor for this game everything is true that it says in the trailor
0307387178|5.0|I couldn't put this book down and I am petrified of heights and would never dream about attempting to climb the greatest mountains of the world. I understand there has been criticism of Krakauer, especially his portrayal of some of the climbers. But like many, I had no idea the difficulties encountered by climbers of this calaber, the roles of the Sherpa, and the dangers faced without adequate oxygen and other necessities. Not to mention how a clear sky with no problems in sight can end up turning into a death knoll. I was enthralled
B009C7JS14|5.0|very good and nice to see the  background. can change the way it is view. better than weather channel which is all ads now
B007REABAG|5.0|Unlike some, I thought this set was well put together. The CDs sound great, the mastering isn't overdone (which is always a plus). Definitely recommended
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This was a great season... Definitely one of my favorites with a great ending.  Can't wait to start season 5!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Thanks you Amazon for first making Kindle for Mac for free. Thank you again for letting me download the App to my Andriods and to sync the content on my MacBook onto my Android
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|I appreciate bad science fiction and good science fiction as separate genres. This is good science fiction. It's intelligent, not too predictable, the characters are convincing. There are only ten episodes in the whole season, though, so I'm on pins and needles till 2014.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Every time you open the game, something different comes up. Great game that won't make you bored. The hardest part is when your finger gets stuck on your screen. Keeps your mind thinking.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|It is so simple to use. And it clears up an amazing a,mount of wasted space with out interfering with your settings and saved info!! Highly recommend!!
B0066WJLU6|3.0|Unless you hold your cell phone perfectly still and touch NO buttons of any kind, this thing cuts off every 15 seconds. Most annoying
B00DQR26EC|5.0|This is definitely an old-schoolers dream.  Lots of references to other RPGs, and just plain fun!  Totally worth the price, I hope these guys make a sequel.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really like the game, although the cards could be a smidge larger to read from a smart phone, and could use a bit easier use of the tap feature. Otherwise, good game.
B00D3S1QD6|5.0|Great app!! I was amazed at how well it works. I have a terrible time with sleep. Love all the bells and whistles on this app!!
0979019710|5.0|Hal encourages each reader to unleash the motivation that is already in themselves to achieve their goals. Awesome speaker, great book, and FANTASTIC person.
B005F2BBLK|5.0|Funny and entertaining.  The story line is well written.  Good versus bad.  Animated with nice graphics.  I could watch it again.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|It really is a shame that this show was cancelled so quickly.  I've given this as gifts to a number of people and they have all loved it.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|Speaker for the Dead was a good sequel. I enjoyed reading more about characters familiar and new. I liked that Orson tackled the idea of a dysfunctional family and bringing them to terms with each other. And also about reconciling two species. It was a bold move for a sci-fi book.<br /><br />I did find the pace to be a bit too slow for my taste, and some of the story a bit like a soap opera. Perhaps it is my fault for having a shorter attention span with all we are bombarded with these days, but it seemed like once something really got going it cooled way off immediately afterward.<br /><br />With that said, I loved the characters and found myself emotionally involved in the story. In Ender's Game I forgot that the story focused on pre-pubescent children, because the author did not treat them like children. On a smaller scale, I found myself focusing on the interaction of the people with each other and the piggies to be the focus, not the fact that it took place on a foreign world separated from the nearest inhabited planet by 22 years of space travel.<br /><br />If you like Sci-fi with a heart, read this book. But read Ender's Game first, by all means.
B000ENWKN8|5.0|I bought this because I liked playing Devil's Rejects on the jukebox and loved that song - And I thought I'd give the whole thing a listen - WOW!  This cd is right up my alley.  Don't know why it isn't more popular - I think some people look at the cover and think it isn't really a Rob Zombie album and it scares them away, seriously - why do I think that?  because the cover almost scared me away and I was like, \\"This isn't Rob Zombie - or it's some different stuff he tried.\\"  I seriously think it is the Black and White - non-cartoonish barebones cover.  And what an appropriate cover that reflects the music inside.  Zombie is great on this - it is DEFINITELY Rob Zombie-ish - but some of his best song-writing.  It is a moody album, with great lyrics and an angry depressed sound that I love.  It is just song after song that I love.  It IS barebones and moody - but great songs and they rock - great feel and aura.  I think it is some of his best work.  Like I say - it is a hidden gem.  Hell doesn't want me, Hell doesn't need me!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This was an awesome game I recommend it to any one that likes iron man. The graphics were amazing and the controls very smooth.
B00DFRVAC2|5.0|Themes & movements harken back to the first Iron Man soundtrack, which I also adored. Highly recommended and I found it quite enjoyable to listen to sans movie.  Don't listen to this soundtrack while driving...friend of mine got a ticket and totally blames it on this... :D
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|it is love beeeeeeeeeeeeeeest<br />Illlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooooooooooooooove it plaese get<br />ppppppppppppopppppppllllllllllllllllllllllllllaeget it it is a good game<br /> I like it. I hope you like it
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have jut purchased  and cannot wait to begin reading books two and three, in fact I think I will start right now!
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|This was a fantastic series that fell to the pencilnecks that had absolutely no clue.  Why are all of the channels run by incompetent monkeys?
B005I4JG80|5.0|A very well written book. Very interesting and easy to read. The author narrates her experiences as a mother raising her children in France. Lots of comparisons to the way parents raise their children in the United States. A must read for all moms and moms to be.
B00AKS656U|5.0|It's a really active game like temple run but more fun u get new upgrade every time u play it really fun
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|Excellent!  A friend with similar musical taste to mine highly recommended the 20/20 Experience, and I'm so glad I listened.  There are not many CDs I can listen to from beginning to end, but each song positively enhances the overall experience.
0307951154|4.0|this was a  typical Nesbo novel  -  it is a style I enjoy and I will continue to purchase his books
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|I like the news exclusives and the ability to add stocks and mutual funds in the MyStock section.<br />This is a keeper.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I just recently found this app for my tablet and since I downloaded it, I've used it many times. It's very useful!
B00821OX98|5.0|This is an awesome series that offers its features on demands via its website  (TNT) and should have active links like Hulu that play the titles via the third party website.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|I wish that I have Showtime but since I don't I buy Dexter each and every season. Excellent. Will buy next season as well.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|Yup, it really is additive. It is hard to believe that am person keeps adding options to the vehicles and trying again & again.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love spider solitaire. I play this on my tablet all the time. It's fun and easy and you can play it over and over.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I love these characters and I love that there will be a follow up book to this one, great writing, great story, great book, enjoy, xx
B004SOR4H6|3.0|Posting is easy to do with this app. 😃<br />However,<br />editing  your profile, managing your followers and who you are following is more challenging.<br />I'm used to the iPhone app.<br />It's very easy to use.<br />This app is not as easy or convenient as the Apple app.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I was thoroughly enjoying this app, but suddenly it won't download anything.  It keeps saying the video can't be downloaded. I would love to know what happened!
B00007AJGH|5.0|A real classic to hold on to just a real fun movie. Great for the whole family. Crazy antics grap it
0515123447|2.0|Very readable but the plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese, makes detail errors and revolves around a literally billions-to-one coincidence.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son loves this game and also loves the movies too!!!! He has been playing nonstop since we downloaded it.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I wasn't certain if this TV drama would appeal to me, but it is very good.  I'm hoping that it stays &#34;clean&#34;.
B002LAM7PI|5.0|A wonderful film, masterfully crafted by the author, director, and Laika team, and brilliantly delivered by the voice actors.<br /><br />Coraline is a magical journey that is ideal for both adults and children - think A Night Before Christmas, but more relatable and (in my opinion) heartwarming.<br /><br />This is definitely one of my favorite films. Now that I own it, I plan to watch it regularly (at least once a month)!<br /><br />Something I should note: Watching it in HD (on an HD TV) elevates your experience twofold: the colors and graphics are stunning!
B00DFFI7K2|3.0|The movie as a whole was okay, it had a reason to be made, but they prevented themselves from making another movie really, because they killed off so many people. The effects where nice in the way nothing was really over done and the destruction of London was really interesting so congrats on coming up with that idea. I wish they had kept more of the original cast in this movie or gave more of a reason why they weren't there. I am really afraid if they make another movie that it is going to be the same thing of all new members and no explanation as to why the old cast aren't there. It is worth watching but I don't think it is going to become a classic.
B00COGXGNQ|1.0|I like Nicholas Sparks but I have to say this wasn't one of his best books to begin with. The movie is even worst. The actors are note very likable and the story falls into pieces too fast. Not worth the money.
B00B3EJ292|1.0|I didn't realize that this entire movie is sub-titled.  I became so involved with reading the captions that the movie lost its appeal.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Update 7/26:<br /><br />The Package arrived today and Chromecast works as advertised I have played a movie from the play store \\"Transformers Dark of the Moon\\" via Nexus 4, and netflix movie from Avengers (ON KINDLE FIRE OG). It also works flawlessly in mirroring from chrome I used it to play music from google play all access. I have not tried Hulu yet but have read many reports it works. So if you pay to have Hulu Plus on a set top box, Chromecast can save you a few dollars a month there. All in all this seams to be a great purchase and with more developers getting on board in time, a must have. I have also read reports and tried casting local computer files in chrome by pressing \\"ctrl o\\" on a windows machine it brings up a file browser then you select the file. On a mac its \\"apple o\\". Hope this helps and happy casting
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this story as well as the skill of the story teller. Made me want to pick it up in the am to see what had happened the night before. :). I read the entire series in less than two weeks.
B000BISBDY|5.0|I love this cd so much that this is the second copy I have bought of it. Amazing is all there is to it!
B008B11R1Q|5.0|This album is just wonderful. If you like indie music, you should check this band out. My husband agrees. Excellent!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I should have known this would be trouble when it took four tries to download.  Then once I had it on my Kindle, it took at least 5 minutes to load when I tried to play.  I never even really got to play though, because every time I tried it either hard-froze my kindle or just kicked me out altogether.  NOT worth the time or effort.  Play Temple Run instead.
B001NHNG64|4.0|I have read 5 so far looking forward to the rest. Always exciting hard to put down. An exciting unassuming lead character.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was intense for the special forces members of Seal Team 6 who performed this mission! It is sad to learn what demise had become of them during the year after their mission!
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|Heard this on Pandora, fell in love with her voice, got the cd and just think its wonderful. Several great songs on this cd.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love the live radar! The extended forecast is much more reliable than our local weather. I recently relied on the radar while in our basement as the tornado sirens were going off.
B008M87GJK|1.0|I thought I would get streaming BBC live news, only to find I got pre-recorded video clips of the news.<br /><br />I don't recommend the BBC News app, try Sky News and Al Jazeera English, BBC is blocking the US and not offering us any hope.<br /><br />Sky News and Al Jazeera English are good alternatives.<br /><br />I hope this helps you.<br /><br />Cheers and Vidimo Se!
B004XIZN5M|5.0|I am 33 and have been working out since I was 15 for sports and military training. This program makes sense and I have been looking for a good overall strength program for my various joint issues.<br /><br />I have been using this for about 2 months now and sticking to the technique recommendations and feel that I am slowly getting stronger all around instead of just focusing on specific areas.  Some exercises sound easy but if done right (slowly with good technique) they can really work areas that don't get a lot of focus.<br /><br />The whole prison angle makes for an interesting back story but the program can stand alone without it.  So if there are any questions about the authenticity of the story, its really irrelevant if the training works.<br /><br />If you are looking to get back in shape or change up your training this is a good book to check out.
0307744434|5.0|I just love this book. It was very magical, there is a nice love story but it isn't overly in your face, had a great story line, just a fun read. I bought several as gifts.
140006922X|1.0|How about a Christian fatwa against this guy who doesn't bother to identify that he is a Muslim.  Of course, I jest, but the Islamist movement has done just that against Christian fiction about Mohamhead.  What goes around, should come around.  This guy should go back to sand land and let us enjoy looking at girls in bikinis.  I borrowed the book and threw up all over it half way through.  The buyer didn't want me to replace it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This battery app works great. Gives me up to date easy to read battery information. I love how the battery bubbles too . Kinda cool. Tells me everything I need to know in a glimps.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I have recently started watching this season for the first time and I love it!! I am a pretty picky sci fi fan, and I had no problem getting hooked on this show. I highly recommend it to any sci-fi fan
B0011HF6GE|5.0|Justin Vernon is an amazing singer and artist. I love how he brings the sound together. Seeing him in concert is amazing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just got it today and it is awesome and I love it .it is the best game.<br />I can not stop I live the minions in the movie they are so funny .
B00CL66FEQ|5.0|Barbara stole the show with this one! She had me cracking up the whole time! Seth was unusually awkward, but definitely added to the comedy
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Heard about evernote for years. Intuitive to use. Great expectations. Happy so far.<br />Can recommend this. Four more words for the minimum
B00DBSZJRM|2.0|This is an ok movie.  Not spectacular.  Story is ok and it relies heavily on special effects.  Wouldn't watch again.
0553106635|5.0|Recomended to all fans of GOT, excellent product as describe<br />I ve ordered all the books and they met my expectations very much!!
B008Y7D4FY|5.0|Great movie that could give you the creeps without any gory scenes. Should have a follow up.  Definitly a must see. Without the kids!
B006LSZECO|2.0|While I was interested in the story I very soon was turned off by the unnecessary bad language. I would have recommended this book to others if the bad language was not there because the plot is captivating.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I hung in there to the end and now that I'm there, all I can say is, that was it? I spent all that time wading through this book for that?
0553801473|5.0|Recomended to all fans of GOT, excellent product as describe<br />I ve ordered all the books and they met my expectations very much!!
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|Takes a few games to understand mechanics and optimization, but a fun and satisfying game once you do. Wish you could get more than 12 points to use powerups, though.
B00DM0XXCM|1.0|Review from my husband: &#34;Music and visuals can't save this one. Yet another &#34;big corporations are stealing everyone's happiness&#34; film from Hollywood. That's a fresh new idea. Lacks emotional punch...I really didn't care about the two main characters. The movie feels rushed overall...&#34;
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever watched and Sam and Dean really top it off. Their characters are absolutely great and y'all have magnificent actors.
0553801503|5.0|Recomended to all fans of GOT, excellent product as describe<br />I ve ordered all the books and they met my expectations very much!!
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|I like this app because it matches the new style of gmail on my computer.  It's much more convenient for me.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|All I can say is that I'm very happy with my Chromecast. It's not perfect of course but it works extremely well and it will only get better. This is the future of TV and I'm sure future TV's will come with a Chromecast integrated. Hopefully TV manufacturers stop with all the \\"smart tv\\" crap and start adopting this as a default.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />- Cheapest solution for making your TV connected to the internet.<br />- Small and convenient.<br />- Really easy setup<br />- Uses your phone or computer as remote<br />- Works with Android, PC, iOS and Macs<br />- If you have a TV with HDMI CEC it will turn on your TV automatically and switch inputs.<br />- Made by Google<br />- Works perfect with Netflix and Youtube to start<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />- Needs more apps and better performance when casting chrome tabs but it will get there.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Didn't see the movie..... now I am going to have too!  I loved the characters, the humor, and the story.  It was a great read that I didn't want to end.
0553103547|5.0|Recomended to all fans of GOT, excellent product as describe<br />I ve ordered all the books and they met my expectations very much!!
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I was a little weary of this one going in with all the CGI made movies lately. But the alternate or extension of the old Jack and the Beanstalk tale was a delightful surprise. The special effects were amazing as well.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|THERE WERE TIMES I WAS NOT SURE WHAT WAS GOING ON EXPECIALLY WITH THE SONS OF ABRAHAM. SALLY FIELDS WAS GOOD
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers is really an outstanding game. We sold our original set when we moved, and just now bought this one again. We did not realize how much we missed it!
0553108034|5.0|Recomended to all fans of GOT, excellent product as describe<br />I ve ordered all the books and they met my expectations very much!!
B0064MPXFA|4.0|The story moved right along.  I never was bored and am looking forward to a new season.  I thought the cast was well chosen and I especially liked the actor who played Eli Gold.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|IT WAS BORING WAS VERY SLOW TO MUCH DOWN TIME WITH NOT TO MUCH GOING ON<br />WASTED MY MONEY YUCK
B0042ESTQW|5.0|Perfect for my GPS. It protects the  GPS when is raining and in difficult roads.I recommend this case to everyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love love love this game, it's fun challenging and cool ..<br />Be-Do Be-Do Be-Do Be-Do Be-Do Be-Do Be-Do Be-Do Be-Do !
B00004ST9Q|4.0|enjoyed this product very much.  she was a wonderful singer and her death was a real tragedy.<br /> at this time in her life.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|ACTORS WERE AWESOME THE STORYLINE WAS AWESOME THE SETTING WAS AWESOME THEY ADDED TWIST OF THE DEAD WIFE WAS AWESOME
B00CWY76CC|5.0|really cool and makes you think a lot. I had a great time playing it. there's a bit of math in it so helps a little with my math skills also.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I really got into the story and characters.<br /><br />What guy doesn't love the idea of 'playing fort' with a prison and defending against the animated dead?<br /><br />Loved it!
B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I started the series without much expectation, but it is turning out to be a fun Summer series to watch. I have not finished the first season yet, but am already looking forward to watching the next seasons. Recommended for relaxing fun!
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|IT STARTED OFF SLOW AND JUST GOT BETTER AND BETTER TIOL THE END I WAS HOOKED WOULD WATCH IT AGAIN
B008JFUR10|5.0|I was blown away by this movie. I saw it in IMAX & it was worth EVERY PENNY! I recommended it to family, who also went to see it, they loved it too.<br /><br />From the start, as soon as the movie starts throwing all this information at you, I KNEW it was going to be fantastic & it STILL BLEW ME AWAY.<br /><br />Best movie I've seen this summer. the scale of the monster mech fights will make your jaw drop. the designs of them are perfect.<br />Guillermo Del Toro really put his heart & soul into this movie.<br /><br />Go see it in IMAX!!! this will be a bluray MUST BUY!!
B007M45PMU|5.0|I love this album. I am so glad I bought it! Great songs for hanging out and chilling around the house.
B004E547D8|5.0|Fast moving, great story and terrific special effects with wonderful humor - Bruce never disappoints and now we're looking to Red 2
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I enjoy this app very much. the part I like about it is competing! I highly recommend this app to people of ages 5-105!
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Reliable and perfect looking. It's easy to use, and the safety device for the buttons is very usefull! Look like the photo, a very nice watch!
0142429104|5.0|Surprisingly, this is one of my favorite books I've read this year, and it's not just because it's funny, honest, well-written, and engaging (though it certainly is all of the above--the book makes me want to move in with this family!).<br /><br />Most importantly, this book helps me appreciate my parents more. On one hand, it suggests why my parents set high standards for me; on the other hand, it makes me thankful for how comparatively lenient they were.<br /><br />Thank you, Professor Chua. Because of you, I love my parents more.<br /><br />P.S. The audiobook is excellent--I'd actually recommend it over the physical book. Chua reads it herself, and her vocal nuances are pitch-perfect.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is an amazing game that makes you think and challenges your brain! I just wish that it had more levels to do. It is great as a free game though! I would recommend this game to whoever wants a challenge.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I would recommend this game to everyone who likes a fun challenge.  It is very easy to play and the tiles are very interesting.
B001AQIYJC|4.0|&#34;City of Angels&#34; has been an undervalued film largely, in my opinion, due to comparisons to the film &#34;Wings of Desire&#34; upon which it is loosely based.  The performances are uniformly good, and compelling, and Cage has never been better, exhibiting by turns passion, restraint and wonder.  I enjoyed it thoroughly (and it has some really good music on the soundtrack, e.g. &#34;Angel&#34;, Sara MacLachlan; &#34;Uninvited&#34;, Alanis Morrisette, etc.)
0345803493|5.0|Loved the second one. Didn't think the second book would be better then the first but it was. Can't wait to read the third one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Whenever a creeper blows up in survival mode it turns off my kindle and turns all my survival modes to creative.Why?
B00D3LA5WG|3.0|Like Beasts of the Southern Wild, the film's theme is how youth try to cope with life in dysfunctional worlds.  The two young teens in Mud convey their characters with credible skills.  We feel their journey into the unknown and dangerous situations brought on by befriending a fugitive hiding out on an island near their home.  Their acting should receive five stars in a movie worth maybe three stars.  Like Beasts of the Southern Wild, Mud also takes place in the South, where, if we take the two films as mirrors of the South, drinking, domestic violence and guns seem to be the mainstay of life.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Glad this app is finally free. Saw it on ipad/iphone for free...was like why not kindle! Kudos, love this game!
0385537670|5.0|Good Read. I just wanted to see what everyone was talking about. So happy I bought it and read it.

B00DFFHUUA|4.0|This film was all about following the first version with equally entertaining scenes and it delivered on most fronts - I liked it.
B00993FEUK|1.0|I found this  too old for kids and too stupid for anyone over 11. Far too many adult references for little ones and it will generally leave them lost while at the same time it is insulting to anyone over 11. Pass on this wait for it to come on cable
1400069289|4.0|We all are aware of habits...mostly the bad ones but this book opens the door on how habits influence our lives in many subtle ways.  While not written in a textbook style, the author recounts numerous examples of habits and their outcomes.  An easy interesting read!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|So nice to read books without having to buy extra gadgets to read from. I can read from my phone or my tablet
B00C2C637I|5.0|Ray Bradbury, like the picturesque old libraries or city halls found in many a marginalized American small town, was so ubiquitous that I often felt he was taken for granted. He was such a fixture of the literary landscape for so long, lauded as one of our great prose stylists and narrative dreamers so often, that it was easy to forget he was there.  Comfy old chair-like ubiquity aside, Mr. Bradbury's work remained moving, vital, and fresh right until the very end.<br /><br />Something Wicked This Way Comes has been a favorite novel of mine since my early twenties, when I finally got around to reading it. On the surface, Bradbury's nostalgiac Middle American nightmare is simply a dark and evocative fable of childhood; a precursor to every evil-threatens-a-small-town novel written by Stephen King or Dean Koontz or anyone who followed in their footsteps. It is the story of two boys--Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade--twelve years old, on the cusp of adulthood, suddenly faced with temptation and damnation when a devilish autumn carnival invades their picturesque little Midwest town. Little by little, Will and Jim discover that the delights promised by the carnival (led by the sinister Mr. Dark, covered in moving tattoos representing the many souls he's dragged to perdition) are thorny roses to say the least, wishes granted with terrible fine print folded into their infernal contracts.<br /><br />In deft, evocative, poetic prose, Bradbury paints a vivid and memorable portrait of a serene if static world invaded by a malign and alien influence, insidious precisely because it uses the all-too-human frailties of the townsfolk against them. Perhaps most impressive is the master's ability to entice the reader with nostalgia, then use those very objects of nostalgia to instill pity and terror equal to any Greek tragedy. For a man renowned for his love of autumn, carnivals, and Halloween with all its funhouse trappings, Bradbury succeeds magnificently in turning the objects ofhis affection (and ours) into vessels of fear. This is, perhaps, a central aspect of Something Wicked's success: by turning the objects of nostalgia and affection into devil's snares for our fragile, aging souls, Bradbury reminds us that what we love can damn us as well as redeem us. The difference between one and the other often balances on a knife's edge between ecstatic self-destruction and ascetic, self-punishing virtuousness.<br /><br />Folded into Bradbury's meditation on childhood fears and adult regrets, one also finds a simple, elegant consideration of how goodness and happiness rarely walk hand in hand. Telling his father that he considers him a good man, and learning that Charles sees himself that way as well, Will is forced to ask, \\"Then, Dad, why aren't you happy?\\"<br /><br />Charles's response: \\"Since when did you think being good meant being happy?\\"<br /><br />Seeing that his son doesn't understand, Charles tries to elaborate on just what trying to be good has cost him. \\"I was so busy wrestling myself two falls out of three,\\" Charles says, \\"I figured I couldn't marry until I had licked myself good and forever... Too late, I found you can't wait to become perfect, you got to go out and fall down and get up with everybody else... [but] you take a man half-bad and a woman half-bad and put their two good halves together and you got one human all good to share between. That's you, Will...\\"<br /><br />If anyone's ever written a better paen to marriage and child-rearing, I don't know what it is. Will's conversation with his father, and the revelations both share, strike me as beautiful and true.<br /><br />And that, ladies and gentlemen, is why Ray Bradbury was a national treasure.  Although he created a vast and beautiful body of work, in this simple, lovely, spooky little novel, made up of barely 80,000 words, he not only encapsulated the terrible moments that portend adulthood--the realization that grown-ups are fragile and flawed; the reality of one's own, eventual death--but also their obverse: the moment in our adulthood when we finally realize just how far behind us childhood, safety, and dreams without regrets lie. Two boys realize that a world of compromise and moral hazard awaits them, followed by death; an old man realizes that death is nearer than ever before, and that the compromises and moral hazards left in his wake make its approach all the more tragic.<br /><br />And yet, in the midst of all this darkness, hope endures. That it never comes across as a cloying, false, or flashy hope is further evidence of the late master's genius. The silver lining to Bradbury's thunderclouds is simple laughter; a willful outpouring of joy and delight, to light the darkness and defy the doldrums of inexorable time and lurking mortality. \\"Everything that happens before Death is what counts\\" Bradbury tells us, and we can only believe him. From the realization that we're all in the same boat--that we all suffer the same doubts, the same regrets, the same self-deceptions--we draw some small measure of strength, and find some small measure of hope, even in the face of oblivion. As the book's Moby Dick-derived epigraph proclaims: \\"I know not what lies ahead, but whatever it is, I'll go to it laughing.\\"
B000M02M2M|3.0|I've bought Stockmar crayons before and they are hands down my favorite.  The bright colors and quality of shading avalible make me want to color again.  So I give Stockmar high feedback for the quality and longevity of their crayons.<br /><br />This review is for this specfic set of 16, and hopefully my set was just a fluke.  But at almost two dollars a crayon, I'm upset that the classy tin of crayons arrived missing two colors.  Instead, there are two duplicate colors (red and brown) and it's missing two key crayon numbers: #8 a blue-green I think and #11 a purple.<br /><br />I'm grateful to Amazon for their return policy, and will be returning these for the smaller, less expensive, set of 8 [...]  as well as the supplementary set  [...] of 8 which will work out better anyway, as we'll have gray and light pink, colors which for some reason weren't included with this set of 16.  We use grey and light pink for animals and skin tones.<br />I say \\"we\\" because although I splurged on these crayons for my kids, I find myself coloring and drawing with them when I get a chance!

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Very suspenseful, exciting read.  I love his books and this did not disappoint.  If you are a DeMille fan, you will like it, too!
B001QL5MAA|4.0|There has always been a rivalry in sci fi between tales of interstellar derring-do, alien conflict, and exploration (space opera) and stories more grounded in real, conceivable science that try to posit a possible future bounded by what we know of astrophysics, chemistry, genetics and engineering (hard sci fi). Some fans embrace both streams wholeheartedly. Others act as if there's a high concrete wall separating the two, and that no one from one side should venture into the other (or muddle the boundary between them). Alastair Reynolds is that rare sci fi writer whose work embodies the best of both streams, binding them together into a twisty-turny Celtic knot of adventurous interstellar awesomeness.<br /><br />What I love most about Revelation Space is its very deft employ of fear and wonder in equal measures. By infusing the wide-eyed cosmic ooh-aah of Arthur C. Clarke with the vertiginous cosmic terror of H. P. Lovecraft, Reynolds has managed to tap into our most visceral attraction-repulsion responses where space exploration is concerned, and manages to tell a ripping good yarn chock full of xenoarcheology, space pirates, and star-slaying alien outsiders. In short, Reynolds gives us space opera, but he does it with his foot planted squarely in the camp of scientific possibility, while still managing to make the future seem both wondrous and weird. Surely, no small feat.
B0035S996U|5.0|This is one of the great cult classic films of the late 70's, early 80's, like Escape from New York. Memorable characters and often quoted lines throughout (I remember Shaquille O'Neal yelling &#34;Can You Dig It!&#34; to the fans. That didn't come from Shaq, it came from this movie). There's something in the way the Riffs leader Cyrus speaks that reminds me of Pres. Obama. Can't be sure exactly but it was just something in the speech pattern or the charisma (not the content, this is not a political statement). It's a fun movie.
0062255657|5.0|i havent read one of neil gaiman's books in a while, and i was reminded why i loved \\"good omens\\" so much... this book has notes of john connolly's \\"book of lost things\\" (which if you havent read yet, order it NOW with this one), in the childhood nostalgia and wisdom, applicable to most any age. it lovely, whimsical, and one of the few books i would love to see made into a dark adult animated movie, like \\"#8\\" if only just to share it with more people... its worth buying. sharing. and making sure you get back because you'll want to read it again. i already do.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|What a fun game. Very addictive. Just can't be enough the features are great and there's always different challenges. The downloading was fast there are few advertising, what can I say u have time to kill this game would definitely help.
B000IDEQTK|4.0|I was drawn drawn to this movie because I like the actresses and the story line peaked my interest.<br />Intriguing to the end. You'll be surprised
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|Barbra Streisand is amazing in this movie!  Jeff Bridges is quirky but drop dead sexy!  It is funny, sad, inspirational and romantic all in one!
B00DM0UTPQ|1.0|This movie reminded of the movie The Widowmaker w/ Harrison Ford. The pace of the movie was very very slow, and most of the actors seemed to have mailed in their performances. Special effects were mediocre. Rather watch Das Boot instead.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Love doing this, helps me to pass the time away when I want some down time. Thank you very much.
B003YUT1QM|5.0|This show is very exciting.  Suitable for 13 & over to 90+.<br /><br />One of Sandra Bullock's earliest films.  It made her a star.
B003G4GMPO|4.0|Delighted to find another well written series in the police procedural section.  I've since bought a couple more of Mr. Connelly's books and will buy more in future.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|I was a big fan of the movie Contagion by the same director. This movie did not disappoint me at all. The first thing that comes to mind when watching this movie, it felt like I was watching 3 movies in 1....but in a great way. The movie started out as a docu-drama on the pharmaceutical industry, but then it a huge twist and became a great, smart, intense thriller. One of my favorite movies this year so far. The main female lead (Mara) gave an oscar worthy performance..... I didn't think she deserved an Oscar nomination for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. Her performance in this movie makes up for ok performance in TGWTDT.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|We watch Red after seeing Red 2.  Red is good, but Red 2 is great!  We plan to see it again.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a very interesting read.  It was difficult to put down.  Very compelling.  A real adventure.  Hard to believe anyone lived through this.  If this character was real, it would be interesting to know how he is now.
B003VANOFY|5.0|that is an awesome produce! I bought one to my husband for gift, and my husband loves it. this is the good gift for a man who likes playing game!!
B008Y73940|4.0|I enjoyed this movie much more than I thought I would. Matthew McConaughey does a great job as the main character. The twists and turns in the plot keep you watching.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is enough to keep you interested but it can still be challenging on certain levels. Some items you don't need but it's difficult to determine which ones to eliminate and which one to try.
B009G41CG2|5.0|Typical for its genre, easy to see and tap, challenging layouts. I would recommend this version for anyone who enjoys mahjong .
B008JFUR10|5.0|This movie is what every Giant Monster/Kaiju/Mech fan wants and more. For the people who say it is terrible, they probably have never been a fan of any of the old films so don't give them too much crap since this movie has a pretty narrow market among us viewers. You all can count on my pre-order though. Stay together Kaiju fans! We're making a comeback!
B00CWV8X04|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was very boring, and I had no interest at all in any of the characters. Don't waste your time.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|What a great change of pace for superhero movies, the best Iron Man movie since IM1, this movie took a couple of great unexpected twists and turns and was much better than the second in the series.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Everything you want out of a Sigma Force book! Interesting locations, amazing technologies, terrifying realities and lots of Gray Pierce.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I think this game is awesome a little bloodthirsty but still cool.<br />I have read other comments about the potions and all that mess but I think people who have a thirst for adventure and don't mind a little blood shed would really enjoy this awesome app!
B00BP4ZNFM|5.0|My 6 yr old Loves this as much as I did when I saw it 30 something yrs ago.. Great Movie
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Surprisingly entertaining, given than I had never heard of this movie before. I don't want to, but I still like Bruce Willis as an action hero.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is very well done.  The development of the characters keeps you wanting to see what happens next.  The humor in some of the dialog is well-written. We have come a long way in getting away from the attitudes of the upper class towards those who are less fortunate... or at least I hope we have!
B004G5ZY7E|1.0|This is not my kind of book, and I didn't enjoy it.  It was selected by a member of my Book Club.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is great! It is very addicting. I cannot stop playing it. You should get it for your kids. Best game ever!
B0094N2PES|4.0|This movie is not really meant to be scary, so anyone publishing reviews criticizing that point are not credible. Scream 2 characters make fun of scary movies, but unknowingly are in one of their own. The story line is interesting and the acting is comical. However this movie does have some negatives that prevent me from giving it five stars. These problems mostly \\"how is that possible\\" sort things. I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.
B00DAXXO98|5.0|I hate that this season ended with a cliffhanger...because so many questions and ideas are left. I am so looking forward to season 2, I can't stand it.
0525478817|5.0|Absolutely fantastic read. This novel is painful: I literally cried -sobbed- through the entire last third of the book. It is hilarious: It is carefully lined with witty conversation and a touch of almost \\"inappropriate\\" humor that only John Green could master. And it contains possibly the most beautiful love story I have ever read: Hazel and Augustus are absolutely perfect in way that you must read and experience for yourself.<br /><br />This is my favorite John Green book I have read largely because of the way that he captures the depth of human emotion (as evidenced by all of the crying and the literal laughing out loud at times) and the fact that it has a fantastic plot that is never dull for a moment.<br /><br />Finally, this book will force you to think about the size and importance of the human life in terms of what you can/will/expect to accomplish during your lifetime, how you will be remembered, and how much this matters.<br /><br />I highly recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Yet again another great book by her. This book picks up right where the first left off. I dare say it's as good as the first one. This is my second time reading it and it's still a great read. This book is worth reading. If you liked the first book then you'll love this one.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This series had me at scene one. Wonderful depiction of what being a wealthy Brit was like in the early 20th century, and an excellent choice of actors and actresses for the many varied roles.  Seeing the staff side of the story is equally as interesting.  Enjoy!
B001EBV0OY|5.0|Excellent movie! The acting was superb. I fell in love with Morgan Freeman as an actor in this movie. Worth the watch if you haven't seen it.

1426308469|5.0|My grandson (4) who is crazy about dinosaurs and knows a great deal about them LOVES this book.  I am so pleased I bought it.  The pictures are especially good.
B003R7L1CE|5.0|ok so if you really love/prefer body weight training then you really need to include this volume in your collection.  Mark Lauren covers more than just exercises; he also shares circuit options, combos, routines, etc.  you get way more than just a dictionary of exercises.  you get a versatile at home-gym workout/trainer.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Like the game. Keeps me entertained when i have nothing else to do and even when i do but would rather play the game!  It is challenging but not so hard that i want to quit, at least not yet.  Great graphics. Very cute!
0345803493|5.0|I must say, I am half way through this book and I believe it is much better than the original. Way more realistic and down to earth.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great brain teaser! just sucks you right in! the puzzles are difficult and really get you to think on how to solve them.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|When the chromecast arrived, it was incredibly easy to set up. I was able to plug it in and immediately start the set up process. Rather than plugging it directly into a TV, mine is plugged into a receiver. When I bought the device, Netflix was still offering a three-month free trial. As a Netflix subscriber, this brought my cost down to just $11. At $11, this device is a no-brainer. At $35, it is a tougher one. I will try to compare the Apple TV and the Chromecast since those are the two I have.<br /><br />Set-Up<br />The set-up process was incredibly simple. I plugged the device in and instructions popped up on the screen directing me. I pulled up the website it told me to on my computer and I downloaded an app. The app then helped me connect the chromecast to my wifi network. After getting it connected, I then had to download an extension for my chrome browser. All in all, it took under five minutes from getting the package from the UPS man to watching videos on the device.<br /><br />First impressions<br />With the chrome browser, you are able to place a browser tab on the screen. I personally noticed that text was not as clear on the screen as it was on my computer screen. I have a 42 inch tv, and I cannot speak to whether or not that is due to buffering issues or something simpler. I then went to YouTube. On YouTube videos there is now a button in the bottom right hand corner that allows you to play the video directly on the TV screen. My understanding is that this ends up being a more effective method than Apple's mirroring for the Apple TV. While you can only use certain Apple laptops for mirroring, the ones that can are uploading the information and the Apple TV is then downloading it which slows the process down a bit. The Chromecast does not have the ability to mirror entire parts of the screen or anything like that, but streaming videos did seem very fast on the Chromecast. I also played a YouTube video from my phone. Similarly, a new box is in the corner that allows you to send the video to the Chromecast.<br /><br />Other notes<br />I have no idea what the future for the Chromecast looks like. I do believe, though, that Google typically opens their software up to more development than Apple does. Unless you have a specific laptop that can mirror to the Apple TV, the two products are very similar. On Apple TV you can watch and listen to local media which is nice. The difference between $35 (or $11 for me) and $99 is pretty drastic and I don't personally think the added functionality of the Apple TV is probably worth that.  If you already have an Apple TV, you probably don't need a Chromecast. If you don't have either, I'd snag a Chromecast.
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Enjoyed this book although it is probably something more suited to the teen/ young adult market. The story is fun and held my interest even though I am not a technology geek, nor am I 17. It really was just a fun light summer read, great for the beach or back porch when you really don't want to think much about what you are reading.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its ok but get survival craft its 3.99 and you can mine blocks more faster in creative mode in survival craft

B002WV5A9G|4.0|If you watched the original series you should get a kick out of this pre-quell. The casting is fantastic and the special effects are terrific .
0515142247|5.0|If only such a fascinating man truly existed.  But, it's fun to read about a human superhero who always manages to come out on top, even if he does make a few mistakes along the way.  He's got a soft spot for people in trouble, and this is just a wonderful read and a great way to pass a rainy afternoon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a cute little game that lets you compete and play with tons of horses.you can buy boots, headbands, and all kinds of stuff
0345803493|5.0|This book was amazing. I enjoyed it from the minute I open it. The first book truly caught my attention. It is like watching a movie but you are reading a book. I suggest you read the whole series!!
B00COGY2P2|5.0|This movie had lots of twists and turns.  There was a lot of humor and suspense and I loved Jack's character!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I do NOT own this product but am seeing only 5 star reviews, based on minimal marketing info from Google!  I've seen the announcement of the device, and a little bit more.  Unable to understand what does this product deliver that Roku does not today.  For a price of $100/-, Roku delivers much more than this thingamajig at a price of $35/-.  And this thingy keeps the device (Laptop/Tablet/Smartphone) engaged to stream content.  All it is doing is picking up the selection from the device, and playing it from the Cloud to the thingy, and then sending it through HDMI to the TV.  Meaning, if my device is out of battery, I can't use this thing?  And, yes, there's software to download to control the Pause and Play, Reverse and Forward.  Roku has that avaialble as a separate physical and practical Remote Control (and device based remote control software too) and has much more content than just what Google is offering here!  And it still needs power through an adapter (yes, I know HDMI has no possibility of power yet, but) and we go through all that fuss and still get only YouTube/NetFlix/Pandora?  All that Google is doing is to come up with a piece of hardware and sign up partnerships for content that are not Google.  I don't get it.  Seems like a 'me-too' product from Google.  Underwhelming!
0345803485|5.0|Many of my friends read this book and was adamant about me reading it. So, I gave it a try and I was Hooked immediately!!. This big is amazing. I finished reading it in two days and immediately ordered the third and the second books from amazon, which came the next day!! I love it and recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a good romantic but reality read!!
B0053O89RY|4.0|This series is ok.  It is made like a reality tv show but it is not.  The whole thing is scripted, so I suppose that is sort of original in itself.
B000FQJAIW|5.0|I got the movie 2 days before it was expecting to arrive. GREAT!<br />Great job you guys! Thank You!<br /><br />Now for bad news!!! I ordered the wrong one.<br />I have to return it....unless I can find someone that would like to buy it from me.
0345803507|5.0|I love how the ending of this series. Truly blew me away. The author also gives a little synopsis of Christian Grey perspective versus Ana Steele first-person narration. I hope she releases the book soon &#34;Meet Fifty Shades&#34;,.... Love this book!!
1416550518|4.0|I thought The House at Riverton gave me a good look at English class differences.  Grace never questioned keeping her place and the family secrets.  Fortunately for her, she was able to exit that life and make a life for herself.  In the end her secrets remain just that...secret.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son is really enjoying this game. I like how excited he gets when he plays it. I would definitely recommend this game. Who doesn't like the Minions!?
0316227706|5.0|I just adore this book.  Each dog is so full of joy. That enthusiasm for life is one of my favorite things about dogs.<br /><br />It is such an original idea to photograph dogs in the water from within the water.  I have never seen anything like it. I bought the book for my father who shares my love of dogs and is in a nursing home.  I am ordering the calendar for myself and perhaps for him, too.<br /><br />It is true that the book could have been put together better so that one picture wouldn't be spread across two pages, making it hard to see the dog's face in that particular shot. But, it is such a fantastic, original idea and is so well done otherwise that I am still giving it five stars.
B008GOG98Y|4.0|I've always loved the Italian focus of the main character in this classic cycling and coming of age movie-it's belissimo!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app this the best app that game loft made. Despicable Me Minion Rush is fun because you can watch what happen before you start playing and you need to put the code in, but there are 5 different codes to put in. What do is, I press OK for the earn one, but I start by scrolling down on the third one but press OK for earn until I hit the last one, Next I scroll down one on the second  and do the same on the third one, Then when I hit the last one on the second and third one, Then I scroll down one on the first one and do the same on the second and third one.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I loved the carefully developed characters and the ineptitude of socially immature but family-wise farm folk.  A quick read for a change of pace interlude.
B008220BLG|4.0|It's not often that a zombie movie catches my attention, but the trailer for this one made me laugh out loud. I'm not sure why this film wasn't a runaway hit. It should have been. A new twist on zombies with a classic (Romeo and Juliet) story backbone. Nicholas Hoult gave a terrific performance as R. Never once is his shuffling overdone or too subtle. Theresa Palmer is terrific as Julie. The supporting actors are wonderful too.
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Not as well done a Mandingo from yrs ago but a good piece like most of his stuff it is a bit over the top
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is filled with memorable characters, engaging story line and decent values, somewhat different than the line-up the networks dish out!
B00DGKQ5I2|5.0|Love these guys and never disappoint. Great album and mixed in just the right amount of new touches to their song. Really enjoyed the album.

B008ELUEQC|5.0|I love this CD. I saw the special and got this' l knew it would be good and it is.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show, devastating surprises, balanced acting.  Sometimes ensemble cast can be a mess of stories, but Downton got it very right.  Can't wait for Season 4:)!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. One of the best strategy games I have played. Can't wait for more levels to play. Hope they come out with more soon. Object is to find all the clues and pieces to open the elevator. Level10 is tricky and finding where to use the drill is note easy.I had to look that one up.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|It's a family favorite. She wants to go to library just like Matilda. And make pancakes like her too. Sweet.

B0064X7FVE|2.0|The new graphics are nice to look at but the usability has suffered with this new update.  &quot;If it ain't broke, don't fix it.&quot;
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Thoroughly enjoying playing against friends and family...good, clean fun!  Some are a bit challenging, guess it keeps us coming back and back.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|nice for a bedside or side table clock. it has many selections for the look and alarms. get the app.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The book is very well written but maybe a little bit wordy.  The story is good and I liked the way the author tied up all the loose ends when the book finished.  It may have been a different culture but not too hard to understand why the father felt he had to give this child a chance for a better life than he was able to give her.
B007SGM084|5.0|After hearing about what this book contained I wasn't sure if I would like it. It exceeded my expectations and I really enjoyed reading this book. I enjoyed the lows as much as the highs. This is because without the lows the highs wouldn't have been as grand. I am a sucker for a happy ending and this book did not disappoint.
B00B7ERH04|2.0|i found this app limited and not that worth the download. if it had more options that would be different.
B00B3EJ292|5.0|I loved this movie. It makes you think about what people did during this horrific time to keep their spirits going.
B00AOMR2S2|5.0|I love it went the soundtrack to a movie is just as much fun to listen as it was to watch the movie.
B00BKTFABE|3.0|good app for the kindle fire hd or any other device you'd like to put it on. works good for selfies. lol
B0026S93C0|4.0|Lots of good music, great dancing. Storyline was entertaining. A really good movie with very few dull moments in it.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Works Great, 15 min. and their ready to cook! Good for smaller grills. Burn hazard from the part of handle not covered though.
B00BHBBSZ2|3.0|note taking when an idea crosses your mind is easy with this. i like the hand writing section as well as the keyboard option. they ought to add  a grided section for drawing diagrams aswell.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is pretty fun and it keeps you interested longer than Temple run or other games like that. I like it.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is amazing. Every time I try to put it down I always go back to playing it<br />I just can't stop
B008P1EWIM|4.0|i put this app on all my devices. it is as useful an app as i have ever really found.
140006922X|1.0|This book was written from the perspective of a Muslim. What more needs to be said? Muslims do not believe the written testimony of the apostles and eyewitness accounts from the life of Jesus. What they have is made up speculation with a solitary goal of reinforcing the lies of Islam.
B00005LC4B|5.0|This is one of the rare remakes that is actually as good as the origional. Has some updated twists which make it better not cheezy. Well worth the watch.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|With the multiple stories to follow, the producers/directors make the transitions between stories too choppy.  Also, the dialog in one story is very hard to hear/understand.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love the Despicable movie, first and the second. That way this game interestingly awesome to play. I would recommend everyone to play this game.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|Please make available the other seasons !! This show is so great that I felt like a teenager again !
B00AREIAI8|5.0|So awesome.Those are the only words I can use to describe this game.The horses are great and it  allows you to do what you want.
B002BJGYV2|5.0|Love it, glad i have all the seasons now. I love amazon.  Love the show. Wish it never got canceled. One of the best shows ever made.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|When I listen to La Futura (which is often), I hear sounds from this legendary group's early hits, such as Tush, and I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide. Furthermore, this album seems to journey deep into their catalog of albums, even with sounds that are like stuff off of Rhythmeen. If that isn't enough, I even hear a little AC/DC and even Blackfoot!!! Whatever the case, this album is rooted deep in the blues and boogie, which is signature ZZ Top. What I particularly love about this album (besides the great songs) is the top-notch production; this album has a clear, crisp and bold sound that really brings out the guitars and percussion. Billy Gibbons has some of his best guitar work on this album. As for the songs, the standouts include I GOTSTA GET PAID, CONSUMPTION, the slow and wonderful OVER YOU, and the very bold and powerful IT'S TOO EASY MA&Ntilde;ANA. I will admit that I was torn between 4 and 5 stars for this album, but decided that it's worthy of top praise, due to the production. After a 9 year hiatus, it's so nice to get an album that's a 'comeback' of sorts, because it doesn't disappoint, so it was worth the wait. Don't miss this 'true to roots' album that can appeal to all fans of the Top.
B008AIGWVA|1.0|No practical use. May be fun for someone... I guess a young child may enjoy this? This not useful for an adult.
0062059963|4.0|In THE SELECTION, thirty-five girls came to the palace. The Elite, as they are called, are only a fraction who remain. And while America is still in the game, she's faced with a different problem - can she be a princess?<br /><br />  THE ELITE had some frightening scenes, amping up from the fluffy dresses and petty arguments between the contestants in THE SELECTION. But while the stakes were higher, the writing was the same as in THE SELECTION. It was simply not as good as you'd expect - so much so that you can't take the plotline seriously. At least, that's how I felt throughout the book. THE ELITE, like THE SELECTION, has an incredible storyline, but the execution is where Kiera Cass is lacking.<br /><br />  Another downside: America acts rashly in the latest installment. It was more annoying than anything else, but everything ties down nicely in the end.<br /><br />  One area in which Kiera Cass excelled: in making me as torn as America. Right when America (and I) start to think Aspen is the right choice, Maxon flips our wrong thoughts right - making him perfect. And right when we begin to think a life with Maxon would be the one, he ruins it, or Aspen does. It's a whole back-and-forth dilemma I really enjoyed.<br /><br />  THE ELITE has less eliminations than THE SELECTION did - of course, there are way less girls now than then. But I did expect one more than the actual number. But this has made me all the more tensed for the third and final installment in Kiera Cass's debut trilogy. And while THE SELECTION focused more on beauty and girls and getting them to eliminate one another, THE ELITE focuses more on the world - the war, rebels, and more importantly, the history. Which just so happens to be uglier than I thought.<br /><br />  In the end, despite the writing that irked me, the plotline won me over. I am beyond excited to see how everything - and everyone - ends up in the last book. I've got no expectations and no special hopes - I just need to see how it ends!nds!
B002OR0RP0|3.0|I am afraid this video led my kids to repeat things I do not allow in my home. Such a cute show, but not without it's inappropriate comments.
B00821OX98|5.0|It has everything...action, suspense , romance, fiction,..... some might say that the show is predictable but so what? live is predictable, you live and die.<br /><br />Love the characters and what they represent.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Still love Doctor Who. The Daleks, Cybermen, and the Ood.  Winston Churchill, River Song, Rose, Martha, Donna and Amy too.
B0046UGSNS|2.0|Without gratuitous use of bad language and sex scenes. This would have been an awesome PG-13 dramedy about kids growing up with 2 moms if it wasn't for the language and sex.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|An original take on Dr. Lecter that will leave you with chills. I am a fan of Mads' and this did not disappoint.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved it from page one. Intelligent, well crafted, emotional. The movie has nothing to do with the book except the name. Though at times cynical (or what I call, realistic) about government, military, and human nature, this book gives a rare glimpse into social issues and our ability to cope with a major catastrophe. It goes way beyond a mere zombie story; the zombies could really be any apocalyptic event. Though the imagery and imagination of the zombie events are also brilliant and absorbing.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I started with the free version but I ended up buying the app. It's fun if you enjoy mysteries. I love the graphics and plot. More then I expected.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Book four was disappointing, but GRRM redelivers with this one. Awesome PoVs and leaves the reader wanting more. Cannot wait for book six!
085720873X|5.0|I'm going to miss this great author and his writings....have enjoyed the Mitch Rapp series for several years. Vince passed away far too young :-(
B005544TRQ|5.0|Fun to watch, End of season 3 is pretty wow :)<br /><br />Season one is more light hearted in a sense, because they're just starting out.  They build up the relationship between Harvey and Mike really well.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|Adichie has written a terrific story that is well-told, believable, and enjoyable to read. I have recommended it to the book club that I am in and recommend it to anyone who has an interest in a good story and how race in America is seen by someone from outside of America.
B002RB7VMA|5.0|It's Michael Buble, what else needs to be said? :)<br /><br />Love all the titles in this album. Fun to karokee to!
B00BWJARHO|4.0|Amazing. Extraordinary! Great to be back deep in the wonderful beauty and terror of Middle Earth.<br />Peter Jackson and Ian Mcklellan do it again.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Something endearing about the characters in this show. We look forward to each episode and hope this series goes on for many more seasons.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Full of shocking moments, this season will not disappoint those who are fans of this wonderfully done series!  Watch with tissues close at hand.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Truly makes the difference over the crummy paste they ship with/on coolers these days. This added with a new CPU cooler dropped my CPU temps by over 20 degrees Celsius on high load.
B000002H38|5.0|I absolutely love Anita Baker and you had the best price I could find. All tracks play great with no skipping. Like new
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|This game is already a classic but with the addiction of this game I can still enjoy this game even though I'm not playing with my friends. classic.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is one of the best mobile games I have seen in a while.  A great port of the popular PC game, this is great for the first time Minecraft player. While there is still a good and varied amount of materials and builds, the selection seems miniscule compared to the XBox and computer. There is smooth gameplay, but there are a few major bugs, such as when placing a sign, the game sometimes crashes. Although there is good online multiplayer, I still recommend LAN, since it plays almost like single player. Altogether,  it's a very good game, and I recommend this<br />to anyone who wants the Minecraft experience, but doesn't have the money.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|As Stephen King said, \\"Gaiman is, simply put, a treasure house of story.\\" 'The Ocean at the End of the Lane' again proves Gaiman as a master wordsmith and wordsmith, a wonderful world at the edge of reality filled with great characters and horrors. This is one of those books you start reading, only to realize hours have passed. And once you're finished you just want to jump right in and read it again.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Great book. Amazing detail and storyline. Loved it. Couldn't stop reading it. Definitely wish there was another book to thisseries!
B004GYY714|5.0|Grate app! You can listen to radio stations from anywhere in the world, high quality audio and it is really easy to use.
B000W8HC8I|4.0|I loved the book, even though its hard to believe some of the crazy shenanigans the wolf of wall street and his beloved team of strattonites did, but yet again, they had all the money and power at a very young age with no limits, how far would anyone go?<br /><br />Waiting to watch the interpretation in film.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Good app, unfortunately It gets stuck when you try to use it immediately upon opening, that's why I'm taking one star. Good memory too, you can see all your work even after you turn off the device...
1475972350|5.0|I am only two thirds through this fascinating mystery, unlike all the others I have read lately, and I hate to put it down for the night. It is a gripping tale, but more than that, it has some interesting twists that make it an unusual study of human nature. It Doesn't follow the formula of a lot of mysteries - to its credit. I am anxious to follow it to the end. I think I know what is going to happen - we'll see.<br />I was wrong - what happened the last 25% of the book was much better than I could have imagined.
B0054SMID0|5.0|Brilliant movie, I can watch Matthew McConnaughey eat mashed potatoes honestly, but this is a compelling and gripping movie. Highly recommended. Book is great too.
B006X5L6VS|2.0|I was very disappointed that it does not work on my Kindle.  I think it should be  made more clear that it won't work on the kindle since it is advertised for the Kindle.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The people he writes about seem real as you are reading about their lives, the places they live.  It is all entwined and I found myself rereading certain pages. He is a great writer.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Not all characters are loveable (and some not even likeable) but you still want to know what happens but IT IS THAT GOOD.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Would really like to know the order the books are in, this is a excellent series a real page turner the characters come alive in your mind as you read the story. Will recommend this book to my friends!

B006O99SYA|5.0|In January 1937, newspapers around the world reported the discovery of the mutilated body of a young European woman in Peiping, as the present-day Chinese capital, Beijing, then was known. The young woman was 19-year-old Pamela Gladys Chalmers Werner, the adopted daughter of a retired British consular officer of Anglo-German extraction and New Zealand connections, a notable China scholar and author, E. T. C. (Edward Theodore Chalmers) Werner.<br /><br />'BODY FOUND IN PEIPING; Daughter of British Ex-Consul Disappeared Thursday Evening. Peiping was shocked this morning to learn that the body of a British girl had been found under the Tartar Wall, between Hatamen Gate and Fox Tower,' reported the New York Times on 9 January 1937.<br /><br />For a few weeks, sensational reports and speculation about the investigation, and suspects in the murder of Pamela Werner, appeared occasionally on international news pages, and then, no more -- or so it might seem from press archives.<br /><br />Seventy years later... a young British author living and working in China as a business advisor and analyst, Paul French, chanced upon the unsolved murder. He pored through old newspapers, and British Foreign Office files in the UK National Archives. Among the files was unpublished documentation detailing the private investigations and representations E. T. C. Werner pursued unsuccessfully for many years to bring his daughter's murderer to justice. Werner himself had died in England in 1954, but French located and corresponded with surviving former members of the foreign communities in China who had known the Werners.<br /><br />The case caught French's imagination -- obsessing him, by his own account. As he delved further, he found that Werner's abrasive personality had so alienated his colleagues and members of the expatriate community that he was forcibly retired out of the British China consular service in 1914 on health grounds. (Ex-British consular officer P.D. Coates, in his 1988 book, [[ASIN:019584078X The China Consuls: British Consular Officers, 1843-1943]], wrote, 'Werner was a byword throughout China for maniacal quarrelsomeness.') Despite his intellect and deep knowledge of China, Werner seemed throughout his life more easily to make enemies than friends. This character trait showed again in the rapidity with which Werner irritated and alienated many officials involved in the investigation of his daughter's murder who might otherwise have been predisposed to help him. This was the era of extraterritoriality, when foreign consuls exercised the role of magistrates and rule of home law over their nationals in China. Pamela Werner was a British citizen, so the British Consul in Peiping had jurisdiction in the inquest into her death and in any involvement of British citizens in the case. A senior British detective, ex-Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Richard Dennis, was brought in from Tientsin (Tianjin) to liaise with the Chinese police investigation, and worked closely with a top Chinese detective, Colonel Han Shih-Ching.<br /><br />Werner was irritating and querulous, but, unlike some of his former consular colleagues, he was a qualified lawyer, with the research skills of a scholar of long experience in China. He pursued his own investigations with stubborn thoroughness and determination long after the British Consul declared the case closed, unsolved, in July 1937. Yet more shocking and unacceptable to the British Consul and fellow expatriates, Werner became convinced through his investigations that the murderer was a wellknown and outwardly respectable member of the expatriate western community, a ringleader of a secret cabal of habitual sexual predators. This line of inquiry led into a sleazy side of expatriate life in bars, brothels and drug-dealing, and in secluded retreats of Peiping's Western Hills, that in Paul French's words, the \\"upright and uptight\\" foreign diplomats found too embarrassing and threatening as \\"loss of face\\" to haveexposed. After the Second Sino-Japanese War erupted in July 1937, and widened into World War Two from 1941, Werner was interned by the Japanese in Weihsien (Weixian) internment camp in Shandong Province. Among his fellow foreign civilian internees was the very man, an American dentist, he believed was the ringleader in his daughter's murder.<br /><br />Reconstructing events from extensive research, Paul French tells the story of the discovery of Pamela Werner's body; the associations with Chinese superstitions of the location; and the complex politics, social practices and personalities of the foreigners and Chinese involved in the case -- unearthing numerous old scandals and guilty secrets.<br /><br />The whodunit story told by this book is so irresistible, full of colorful characters and places, with such an exotic and dramatic backdrop of the curtain coming down on the era of foreign concessions and extraterritoriality as world war looms over China, that Paul French surely had a sense of its cinematic potential when he wrote it. It seems ideal material for a skilled screenwriter to turn into a script. A movie should be made of it. It seems readymade as the basis for a co-production in China with Chinese and western actors who have box office appeal in both markets.<br /><br />The Kindle edition by Penguin is well formatted and easy to read. Paul French and his publishers maintain an interesting \\"Midnight in Peking\\" website at [...] with additional information, photos and video. I wavered for 24 hours over rating the book 4 rather than 5 stars. Perhaps a V.S. Naipaul or Robert Graves might have delivered a greater literary masterpiece from the same basic material, but really there is nothing else to compare with it as a well-told historical narrative of such occurrences in China based on the author's original research, so I have given the book a full five stars.exposed.

B002RI9HUM|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - it was a great read - basically a rom com with some harder edge issues thrown in.  it demonstrated wit and humour, and i really did laugh both with the main character and against her.  very enjoyable for someone who likes Marian Keyes other works, or Maeve Bincy etc.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app!!  you should get it its great and fun get it don't get the other ones this one is the best. its great on survival and creative
B00CY0JY88|5.0|This must be the most frustrating books I`'ve ever read but goodness I could not put them down until they were finished and cannot wait to read more.............
B0046B3QTG|5.0|A very enjoyable movie.  Some good jokes, a heart-tugging story, and great animation.  The minions and the girls are the real stars.
B0058VW36U|5.0|It is cool for us and little kids but you guys should leave it free because now there's other versions, and other stores have them free.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I bought this based on reviews. I was not disappointed. I can sing almost any song I hear but Adele's style is truly unique. Cannot get the lyrics out of my head!
B006Z7Z3R2|4.0|I just watched The Innkeepers and was pleasantly surprised to find a movie that actually took the time for character development and atmospherics. I am sick to death of animated comic books, so it was nice to watch an actual spooky movie. The photography was excellent and the mood built really well. There is a certain ambiguity in the latter part of the movie that requires the viewer to assess the perspective and reliability of the characters. For me, this adds an element of interest. For those reviewers who found this movie to be too slow, I think they should just keep renting Transformers.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|My new favorite game! Love this game! Incredibly addicting... I could do sit and play for hours on end if I had that kind of hours to spare.<br /><br />Would gladly give a 5 star rating... but for the in-app purchases for most of the extras.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just when I wanted to give up I'd find a clue & couldn't stop. Way fun!! Bring on more of these teasers!
B0083EW97W|5.0|I love Mayer and his music but I'm really feeling the vibe of this album. Wonderful work and a must have for JM fans.
B00DU74U74|4.0|Being a fan of Stephenie Meyer's other work (you know the one), I was looking forward to this movie.  I watched it with my teenaged daughter and husband and we were all slightly confused as we went along.  I will probably read the book because it appears that this movie was trying to hit all the &#34;high points&#34; of the story without going on so long that it became a 4-hour mini-series.  Ms. Meyer's has an incredible imagination and writes very well, in my opinion, but her stories are hard to translate into a 2 hour movie.  That said, the movie was interesting enough that I want to read the book now.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|Read the book and the movie actually did it justice.  I've seen it 100 times :)  I wish they'd make a movie of the sequel :)
B00A0MJA1I|5.0|Finally got Peter Pan!  It's a Disney movie!  You can't miss with this!  A must have for any blu-ray collection

1439152802|5.0|Read this book for my book club and it is WONDERFUL!  I'm not going to get into a summary, as there are tons of those here.  Just know that you will NOT be disappointed in reading this novel!  If I could give it more than five stars, I would!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love it.It is like an english soapopera.and can not wait to see season 4 in Jan 2014,Best Buy.Season 3.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|It's not meant to be any great film.  It's meant to be a big actiony comical fantastical romp with serious butt-kicking and easy to hate villains!  Great movie for pure entertainment!
0786715103|5.0|Mr Dallaire (the term Mr chosen deliberately out of respect) is owed a great debt by all Mankind. The courage of this man is truly humbling. To stand alone shoulder to shoulder with his few troops (Men and Women) and fearlessly face down this kind of demon-ism is the true mark of a Peace warrior in every sense of the word.<br /><br />The self centeredness and complete ambivalence of the World community is disappointingly affirmation of what many already suspect. To sacrifice 800 000 lives at the alter of self interest is true evil. This is a story that is not easy to read as it is very uncomfortable and confronting but is well written. This is story that should be told in Schools.<br /><br />Mr Dallaire tells the story with dignity and respect. The story is not full of the details of the genocide although enough of those, unavoidably, reveal them selves - it is troubling enough even so.<br /><br />A must read for anyone with a conscience and real interest in how the World truly functions. A well balanced fascinating insight into how the UN works (or probably most accurately doesn't work). This is not a poor me story but one of incredible courage  with the acceptance of his own role. He, unjustifiably in my view, accepts his fair share of responsibility for the events.<br /><br />He learns of Gods existence as he shook hands with the Devil (his words) , truly a visual phrase.<br /><br />I would love to shake his hand and thank him for his contribution to humanity, much respect to a tourtured soul. I learned alot about leadership from this.
B00CFA227C|5.0|I love this movie!  I know the summaries are already on here, so why re-write it?  It's a great movie with fun imagination!  Love fairy tale themes!!

140006922X|3.0|Nothing new here. In 1967 Samuel George Frederick Brandon (1907-1971) a leading British scholar and professor of comparative religion at the University of Manchester published a controversial book called Jesus and the Zealots: A Study of the Political Factor in Primitive Christianity. Brandon argued that Jesus was a 1st century \\"revolutionary\\" figure, who was executed for sedition and that the early church tried to suppress this information, turning the revolutionary Jesus into the \\"pacific Christ.\\"
B004KPX4W2|5.0|We really enjoyed it. A couple of profanities were unnecessary, but the action was fun, and the cast was great!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|This is one of the best shows I've stumbled upon in a long time. Great character development, dialog, music, wardrobe, and excellent writing to pull it all together!  Love the foil charaterization developing in season 3.
B003B02O0A|2.0|I'm sure the book would have been good, however, after 2 chapters with the N word in every other sentence, I couldn't continue.  I realize this type of language was used by many years ago and especially in the South, but it wasn't used in our household, so I didn't grow up with it.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This was an Excellent movie. I Want to see the show again. the story line and all actors were fantastic .
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|I enjoy this game and play it usually every evening for a bit.  This is my third Mahjong application and, although the concept is still the same, it's fun seeing the different shapes.  I think it can be addictive because you are always trying to better your time.
B00COO2D6O|5.0|Great game.  Find some of the levels very difficult to complete with the points earned by playing only to upgrade. Geared to encourage players to buy points - which I may do.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Just when I get everything I need except one card, I have to deal another set of cards.  But it is enjoyable and I usually win, so that keeps me playing!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|this game was definitely worth the download. it was fun and it forces you to use your mind. cant wait for more levels.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|I really like this show.  They have had very few issues as far as continuity and logic jumps.  I mean it's sci-fi so tons of this stuff is crazy but things like the FBI clearing a house first before civilians move in is fairly important.  I like to see that attention to detail.  As far as the acting goes they all do a very good job.  John Noble is perhaps the best of them all.  He doesn't get enough credit for this great work.  I felt that this season was pretty tight and had some great interaction of the main characters.  Too bad it all ends with season 5.
0312330537|5.0|The author is a bit of an ego-maniac, but the story is one of the most engaging I've ever read. Hard to put it down. At 900 or so pages it's quite long, but in a sense great because for such a great story nothing is rushed and your don't get prematurely sad that you're almost at the end of the book.
B0036S4C6G|1.0|I kept reading Goon Squad, I did try to finish. But in the end I decided that the characters were probably going to remain depraved, sad, and hopeless. As I reached each new chapter, I kept hoping for the turnaround for one of them, any of them. But only more depressing stories unfolded. I also wanted a quicker reveal on how they really all connected to each other beyond the jump-around style that kept telling me I would have to wait for that until the author was ready, not me.<br /><br />When I realized redemption didn't seem to be a possibility for any of them, I gave up and ordered a new book. Goon Squad was well-written, but I ask more from a book than that. A lot more. Oprah, why in the world did you highly recommend this? A waste of my money.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was interested in reading it because I heard so much about it.  I can't believe it was so popular. It's really about a sexual narcissist who preyed on a young vulnerable woman. Terrible story line, no real plot except for his goal to conquer this woman - sexually.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love the way the writer presents the material; it is very intriguing. There comes a point in the book when you have to put all life matters aside and READ!
1591396190|3.0|Lots and lots of good research conducted.  I had to read it for business.  Very boring and text-book arrangement.  Had trouble keeping my interest. Respected the research component.
B001KZG99A|5.0|In a previous life, Robert Downey Jr was tony Stark.  This role is perfect for Mr. Downey.  The special effects rock.  Story line plausible.  It is good fun and great entertainment.  Buy it, rent it EnJOY It
1400069289|5.0|One of the best analytical books written on why and how we do the things we do and to change it.  Excellent research on how some major companies train their employees and teach behaviors to not only help the employees to better grow the company.<br />Excellent examples of how to change and or create a habit.  Loved it, loved it.
161655164X|5.0|For those who cant get enough of the world that Naughty Dog created with The Last of US, this is a must get.<br />Even for aspiring artists wanting to learn more about pre-production, this book has great insights.<br />Its not just about the art, though the art is incredibly beautiful, this book tells the story of how The Last of Us came to be.<br /><br />Its great to see how decisions were made when considering the looks and personalities for Joel and Ellie.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|What else can I say? I didn't have high expectations, and I'm not big into Sci-fi, but my wife and I really enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />The acting was quite good, the cinematography well done, and the soundtrack was top notch.<br /><br />I'd recommend it!
B002J4BW5M|4.0|This version of the CD is the Columbia House pressing. I wasn't aware of that when I ordered, but thankfully in this case there are no missing tracks or continuity errors as sometimes happens with Columbia House versions. Being an older release, it has full dynamics and really nice, warm sound. Still one of the best Lennon collections though the posthumous album 'Milk And Honey' is not represented here because it hadn't been released in 1982.<br /><br />Edit: of course some joker seller keeps offering this for ridiculous high prices such as $980. My review was referring to the seller fulfilled by Amazon where it was something like $3 at the time.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I haven't gotten the game yet but I think it's going to be awesome<br />Cool cool cool cool  Cool cool
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|It's certainly a classic, one of the best war films of all time.  Probably the most realistic submarine film ever!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|the app is great and i use it all the time, it's so easy and normal which is more than I can say for some of the other apps
B00BHMF578|5.0|Such a great film. The tension in this movie is amazing! It may not be completely factual but it doesn't really matter when a movie is this well made.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|the app is too needy, to much to work for to get a proper response, decided to through other means to get to Google, I just don't want to have to over think something I all ready know as easy
B003F3NEBG|4.0|I was a bit wary about this as there seems to be more than one HD version of this excellent video, but we've been quite pleased with the image and sound quality as viewed on our Panasonic 50 inch plasma, and Panasonic Blu-ray player.  Textures and colors of the costumes and settings are amazing compared to our old DVD version.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Love the sound and sights of this game. It's really just Tai Pei with a southern flair. I love jumping the boats and crashing into unsuspecting fishermen.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Wow...so hard to find an album these days that you can just put on and forget about it.  So solid...every track just kills.  If you have any love for classic rock, the blues and a bottle of double IPA, you just have to sit and let this just wash over you.  Let's just hope they keep making music.  Haven't heard an album like this in LONG WHILE...
B009R659L8|2.0|This is a disappointing and forgettable novel by one of America's most loved mystery writers.  I think Clark has lost her touch and should retire from writing. If you want to read a really good mystery by Clark, try &#34;Loves Music, Loves to Dance.&#34;
B00AVFO41K|3.0|I play games to relax, not to exercise my brain.  And that is the best I can do for this time.
B0019O6IWU|5.0|I took a class using this book and am using the tools I learned in my classroom. Would you be willing!
B0095MVOMC|2.0|Even if I couldn't see the numbers, I just kept clicking and the objects would disappear.  No challenge at all.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|How funny is this? Its easy and funny. Kids should have as much fun as adults (and probably better at it)
B00127RAJY|5.0|I like how this is a short workout but you feel like you actually worked out and it didn't take an hour and a half.
B005IQZB14|4.0|great,personal tale -  was rooting for Cheryl throughtout her journey.<br />we could all use a few miles in the woods with our thoughts.
B00E13ZRFA|5.0|Maybe it's the repetitive lyrics or the sweet high voice, or just the right mix that make this song one of my new favorites. And at the 2:15 mark there's a killer sound that I just love.
B001992NW4|5.0|The movie is even better than I remembered. The extras were very enlightening. Well done. This was bought in preparation to meet Ms. Blair at a horror convention. I was not disapointed.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|This is  a delightful cast and while some may write it off prematurely as just another cocoon, this movie has a charming theme and Maggie Smith adds razor edged charm to everything she stars in.
0425252868|5.0|What an amazing story. Franz is an example to humanity. It is was fiction you'd think that's rediculous, a bit far fetched but the fact that it actually happened, and then they became the best of friends is just astonishing. And so well written by Makos. Can't wait for his next outing. 5 stars all round. :))
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|This is not as it seems initially and continues to evolve throughout the movie with an interesting ending.  Worth your while to see.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I am really enjoying this show.  I have heard and seen rave reviews of The Good Wife ever since its debut, but I just started watching it on Amazon.  I love Alicia's strength, but the series also shows her emotional struggles in dealing with her husband's betrayal, her mother-in-laws controlling behaviors, raising her children properly, and navigating the political world of her new law firm.  These are issues most women face, whether or not they are married or have children.  That is what makes Alicia a sympathetic character.<br /><br />I also love the fact that Melinda has to deal with many other types of female characters, some of whom are difficult to deal with:  clients, opposing counsel (such as the pregnant Martha Plimpton character in one episode), Diane (head of firm played by Christine Baranski), and the elusive Kalinda (the beautiful Archie Panjabi).  It is, at times, hard to navigate the world as a woman among other women.  So many women are less than supportive of one another, and The Good Wife illustrates this perfectly.  Alicia finds herself at a loss as to why women who seem to be on her side end up attacking her.  She tends to handle herself much better around men; she's not afraid of asserting herself around them.  But women are tricky, and Alicia tends to lose her emotional footing in their presence.  Is this because of her betrayal or for some other reason?  It is so enthralling to watch her deal with this, as these are issues I face, too.<br /><br />Combine this Greek plotline with engaging legal battles and that is what makes this show so wonderful!  Yay for The Good Wife!
B005H9B2CE|4.0|Thor takes himself just seriously enough to be believable, yet entertaining.  Fun to watch, great to see these characters coming to life on the big screen!
B000MDJH9A|5.0|I've seen this three times, and I'll watch it again! It has a great story, lots of action, and a GREAT soundtrack - highly recommend it!
B008133MDK|5.0|Really worth watching, engaging characters and fun plot twists. The episodes are long and really draw you in. Start from season 1...
B0046B3QTG|2.0|My review reflects the quality of the Amazon HD streaming, not the movie.  The movie is fun.  Perhaps a little edgy in the early parts if your child is particularly sensitive but, as can be expected, there's a happy ending.<br /><br />What's disappointing, is the video streaming quality.  We stream our products through our Sony BluRay player that is connected a Samsung plasma TV.  The &#34;HD&#34; quality that was provided, and payed a premium for, was as bad as VHS.  This same hardware configuration produces vivid resolution when playing either BluRay or standard DVD's, leading me to believe that the quality deficit was in the product provided by Amazon.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A lot of fun, but done in an afternoon. Definitively avoid the clues at all costs. Just think of all the techniques you learn as you go.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The best season as far as I'm concerned, Chris eccleston is a much realer feeling doctor than most of the others
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Wonderful movie, Maggie Smith is the best! The entire cast was great. Hoffman did a good job on this one.
B0034G4P9E|1.0|The case came broken and the code for the digital copy was missing.  I know the movie is a good one from a previous viewing at a friend's house.  I am concerned about this shipment.<br /><br />  Please advise!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I just started playing a few minutes go.  It seems like it will be pretty fun.  The ONLY thing I don't care for having to depend on energy to find hidden objects.  They cost real cash to get them and I noticed several more items that are used in the game that you have to pay for with cash also.  Other than those couple of things, the game seems pretty fun, with lots of cool rewards and things.  I am sure I will enjoy a, and you will too, so go on and get it!  I don't believe you will be sorry!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love playing this. One of these days I am going to try the two suites and be able to win all the games.
B000NMZFKK|5.0|A must see, heart-felt, over all great movie! This movie has it all: love, family, a guy and gal type movie.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This was suggest to me by an acquaintance so thought I'd give it a try. I haven't had it very long but so far I am really liking it because I can access several translations to compare them. Also I can highlight text and make notes, which is very convenient.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is great- good mix of soapy drama & smart wit.  Actors do an amazing job telling a complex story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a WOW of a website and I love it. It is my art gallery at home. It is my dream-scape, sitting in my easy chair. It is overwhelming but so much fun and addicting!!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I really enjoy watching this series....great acting,drama and humor. I will buy this third seasons as well ~_~ I would love to actually tour this estate or one like it to see the huge scope of the grandeur.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like playing Mahjong Salitare on my computer and now on my Kindle. It is a nice way to pass the time.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Very informative and exciting. A Story of history with amazing details told from those who actually experienced it. As I read I could picture the scene and easily understand both the skill and fears of the pilots. Gives one a whole new prospective of the men on both sides. Interesting to learn the real feelings of German military toward Hitler. When is the movie???
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I recommend for anyone who likes science fiction & likes to see the underdogs fight the good fight.  The mix of mandarin & &#34;updated&#34; english words is very interesting to those with geeky tendancies.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|I am addicted to this show! I am almost done with season two and will be downloading the other seasons. I reccommend this to anyone wanting to watch good television.
B005H7UFV0|5.0|My wife & I bought this to help with our relationship, but we found it useful in relationships with family, etc. as well.  It is a good simple way to break down our interpretation & expressions of love.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I just received my kindle fire hd today and I am downloading the apps I use the most.  I was only able to view one video after several attempts.  I have downloaded and removed it several times but the videos seem to just say loading and then I get a message to either wait or quit or it shuts down all together!  The one video I was able to watch looked great.  I hope they can work out the kinks with this app it may be great to use.
B000ELJBAK|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums. I originally bought it on vinyl when it came out. A must have for Pink Floyd fans.
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Two stories in one, both funny, one slightly madder than the other. Highly enjoyable. A great read for anyone with a sense of fun.
B00C1GBOU6|5.0|quite the different sound as opposed to recent albums, but a welcome change nonetheless. i highly recommend this album for fans of past sigur ros.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Hope there is more coming soon! The only disappointing thing is how abruptly it ends. Other than that the game play is awesome
B009XIXVU6|3.0|i was so excited to read this book - i loved his previous 2. but this was just ok.  The first half was strong, and moving, and interesting. but the last half was very slow.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best app in the world it is super fun and very cool. It is the best game in the world. It is super addicting
B008JFUR10|5.0|MADE ME FEEL LIKE A LITTLE KID AGAIN, AND AS I GET OLDER ANYTHING THAT ACCOMPLISHES THAT GETS A 5//5!
B002EXGAS2|5.0|The only thing that's kinda off in this movie is Vin Diesel driving a foreign car - Right! American muscle, baby!!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|My first listen went a little like this..... \\"What was that\\" followed by \\"Weird... easily his worst album ever\\". However, it being Kanye, I kept playing it. At the house, in the car, after about 10 full plays I found myself loving almost every track. Is it his best, NO, but the worst Kanye is better than 95% of the other rappers out there. The beats are odd and sporadic, the lyrics are venomous at times, tired at others, the cohesion of the album is not quite there, but it is SO DIFFERENT. At least he is trying new and different things. I love \\"Blood on the leaves\\" and \\"I'm in it\\" which couldn't be more different songs. \\"Bound\\" is a great throwback Kanye jam (which incidentally feels very out of place with the rest of the album). Some of the \\"screaming\\" I could do without and there is a lot of angst-filled lyrics, but it feels so well connected. I used to skip the screaming at the end of \\"I am a God\\" but now feel that it is a lesser track without it. You will truly love it or hate it, there is no in-between on this album (As you can see by the many lopsided reviews). I think people will look back on this as a truly unique album from the greatest artist of our generation.
B003VR5PPY|4.0|After the game arrived at my house two days after I ordered it (Amazon Prime is the best!) I played it non-stop for about a week. In retrospect, it wasn't terribly excellent, and the psudo-science felt kinda forced, but it's like a pulpy fiction novel you just can't put down. I would definitely recommend you pick it up, but once you're done with it pass it along to a friend.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|The book and the tv show are pretty much identical. Both are fantastic! I actually saw the show first and then read this, so there weren't many surprises, but it was still really good!
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Excellent killer of time...found it kinda addicting. Hopefuilly ill continue to enjoy gameloft games on the kindle fire hd. The suit tree was awesome...got to see some awesome new and old suits
B00821OX98|2.0|The idea is good but too many of the crises in the show rely on unreasonably poor judgement and are very difficult to take seriously.  I mean, come on, you leave a dangerous alien captive unguarded most of the time?  And that is just one instance where the characters are somewhat clueless.
B005MMZ63C|5.0|Just exceptional and plays well now, with all the political shenanigans. Welles is at his finest, and the story aspect keeps the storyline more interesting than just a straight telling.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|i thought it was awesome! it's a very dif sound. it's new and it's fresh. some will call noise but real knows real
B0094MFITS|5.0|This was an awesome series. If I could give it a 10 star rating,  I would. Tom Selleck should receive some kind of an award.
B00B2064IY|4.0|Jimi is a god on the guitar.  Has a different feel from the big hits. More of a blues sound.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|this now the most useless apt.  hard to use now.  I have no use for it now.  a real piece of crap . can't get it to do anything.  looking for a new apt now
B007N0REX6|5.0|Love hearing Slash play the guitar but when you add the vocal perfection of Myles Kennedy you get a great rock album. Hopefully these two continue creating great music for decades
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|I really like this game, it's cute, fun, challenging, and something that you can play maybe while on break or while waiting at the Drs. office (sounds off of course) or wherever. The kids like it, too. They'll play it over and over watching the monkey jump and flip.
0894803123|5.0|I've made alot of the recipes from this book and we've been happy with all of them.<br />So I bought this book as a gift to go along with an ice cream maker.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Fun and addictive game with great graphics, cool creativity and a fun theme. Looks and runs beautifully on Fire HD. Very smooth and the upgrade system is really well thought out. Would have gladly paid for this game but it's free!
B006AX6ONI|4.0|I found the book a good quick read that reinforces the basics of business or the fundamentals that are needed to have a successful business. A good read with good real life examples of his timeline to success.
B000002GXS|5.0|I just recently started getting into tom waits because my older brother had gotten obsessed. Than when i listened to this album, this is what really got me into him. This is such a great album with variety of sound. Even if you dont know tom waits I would suggest listen to this album. Very great album.
0451198492|5.0|Must read for anyone who has seen the movie or is interested in space exploration. I'm currently reading the last book in the series.
B0049J2BSM|4.0|A movie with the classic story line about good over coming evil. Good humor and good fun for the whole family.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The character development is great. I can believe each character. The story is very well developed and well done. Great story.<br />JHM Chicago
B00005YW4H|4.0|I enjoy anything Norah Jones sings.  Her voice is so smooth & easy on the ears!!  Her music fits into the smooth jazz division.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|Matilda is a great movie for kids and adults alike! Its a classic that will be remembered and watched over and over again!
B00BM1AJIO|4.0|I jUST FINISHED THIS GAME AND IT WAS AWSOME! HOWEVER, THIS IS THE TYPE OF GAME THAT I LOVE AND I TRIED TO DO JUST ONE SCENE (PICTURE) A DAY AND IT WAS WAY WAY TOO SHORT. THE GREAT JOB THE DEVS DID THEY COULD HAVE AT LEAST CREATED A SCENE IN ALL OF THE PICTURES THEY PLACE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE GAME.WHEN I SAW THE LAST PIECE OF CANVAS BEING PLACED IN THE PICTURE MY STOMACH ACTUALLY SANK!! LOL CAUSE I KNEW THE END WAS NEAR.<br />I DO UNDERSTAND THE TIME AND IMAGINATION YOU NEED TO CREAT A GAME  THIS GREAT BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH THE WAIT. MORE LIKE THIS PLEASE!! SOON
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Great cast, dark humor, some surprises, a clever plot.  Mary Louise Parker.  I'm looking forward to the sequel coming out soon.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|This novel feels something like an adult version of The Fault in Our Stars, a wonderful YA book I read recently.  The two main characters' course in life, similar to those in that other book, seems fated from the start, and the eventual ending is quite predictable even as it breaks from the romanticized ending one might hope to expect.  Still, I read this book in a day and a half, and I really didn't want to put it down.  The narrative voice focuses mainly on the female protagonist but periodically shifts to a different POV to help the reader understand the full complexity of the situation -- namely a young woman who is hired to help care for a young man who is a quadriplegic whose only wish is to die with dignity.  Moyes handles that difficult issue -- the right to die -- with sufficient care that one is not left finding this to be a right-to-die polemic hidden in a novel.  There is no easy answer presented in this book, and that is what rises it above the Piccoult-like &#34;issue of the year novel&#34; it could otherwise become.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|I think the book I  pretty good but is too long and it needs to be shorter for people to read...
0062255657|5.0|According to interviews, Gaiman said that this book started as a short story and I can kind of tell.  It's less plot-heavy than most fantasy novels are, more philosophically leaning and interested in the mundane of what makes his young protagonist tick.<br /><br />It's the story of a grown man returning to his childhood home and looking back on his past, particularly to a time when a dangerous supernatural entity attacks his home.  This entity comes in the shape of a beautiful young woman and all who see her absolutely love her.  Only the boy can see her for the monster that she is.  He feels powerless and alone, and he knows only hope lies with the Hempstocks, his three peculiar neighbors who are as old as time.  Readers who are familiar with Neil Gaiman's work on &#34;The Sandman&#34; will recognize the parallel between the Hempstocks and the Kindly Ones.  They were my favorite part of the book, because I can always appreciate a good Weird Sisters reference.<br /><br />I can't really tell if this book has an ideal audience.  Personally, I consider an adult's book, but written with a child's perspective.  Some adult readers might not be into this, but I couldn't help but be absorbed by the way Gaiman recaptures the mind of one so young.  I saw a lot of myself in his unnamed protagonist.  There's a good combination of open-minded imagination and fear in the face of the power of adults.  I consider it an adult novel because of the looking back nature of the story, which is at times kind of solemn.  There are also some dark undercurrents to the story, ones that children may not be used to.  I don't mean spooky, though there is that.  It's a little hard to talk about them without giving spoilers.  They concern matters of sexuality, depression and troubled families.  Personally, I know I wouldn't have had trouble reading this when I was young, but then I read all sorts of stuff when I was a kid.  I do believe younger readers are more sophisticated than we say.<br /><br/>The book is mostly dark, with humor here and there.  It's also a very quick read.  I finished it in two days.  I was lain up with an injured foot at the time, and this story was a very welcome distraction.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|All I can say is dammmmnn<br />This game is the bomb but gang star Vegas is real good too<br />I'm just speechless<br /><br />Yes yes yes
B0091W0JPE|5.0|This movie deserves to be the classic that it is. I think it's America's favorite movie still. Bogart and Bergman wow.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is so fun and free I loved it. It was a blast. GO MINIONS the graphics were great and all the mini games were so fun.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing book! Mike goes into detail with everything. He is a great teacher and resource, he even will talk with you via emial and have his team help set your routine or diet. I strongly encourage you to purchase this book if you want to get in the best shape of your life!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I like Bingo, but don't like the way you are required to buy coins to play.  I was looking for a game to play for fun, not have to pay to play.
B005K17RU0|5.0|A great app that is easy to use. It displays a city/temp on homescreen but can be easily opened for more details. It is very easy to add and delete cities of interest.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I found this game as fun as the last one.  I like the puzzle aspect of these games, and looked forward to playing each day.
B0069G5Z9K|2.0|This is such a fun game, I hate to put it down. With the latest update, it put ads EVERYWHERE!  I don't mind ads in the game, that's even expected. But the latest update put ads in my browser that cover up precious screen space and play over web icons. And at random would open the play store asking me to download things. Totally unacceptable and invasive.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I really liked this game.  The puzzle aspect makes you think.  I looked forward to playing a little each day.
B000IZ4R1U|4.0|Exciting move, fun for that special movie night.  Curl up with a bucket of fruit or pop-corn depending and much away.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a lot like Templerun in my opinion. If you want more fun download download download!!!!! You will not regret it one bit!!!!
B009YBTZ8O|5.0|An interesting fast paced read. I haven't seen the movie based on the novel but can understand why Miyazaki would want to make an animation of the book. I read the book looking for books for high school students. I enjoyed it very much and will recommend to my students. Lots of fun twists and turns. This is a young adult book that I can recommend to everyone.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|You get everything you need to keep your kindle up and running  while you are reading or watching a movie.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|An interesting read. I enjoyed the book. I haven't seen the movie. I was a bit disappointed in the wind down after the climax. I think it would have been better just ending without setting it up for the sequel. This is a young adult book that I as a mature adult found an interesting light read. A recommended summer read and you will enjoy it.
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|Definitely  did NOT contain paranormal creep factor! Slice dice blood and gore is a cheap way for a movie to break into theaters. If you were scared by this movie you're WEAK! like soooo many movies nowadays, all the best parts were already in the commercials. I recommend only renting this movie.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Love this..... Easy to use.  I love that it has a timer available.  You can set the timer to run as long as you like...and it will shut down when the time runs out.  VERY HANDY.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I really liked the way the film follows the story and includes the back story as well. If you love Tolkien you'll appreciate the work that went into the many details of this film, and not be bored by it as some viewers are.<br /><br />I did not see The Hobbit in the theater, as I was confused as to which way to view it, having read pros and cons on both sides, and not wanting to feel discomfort.<br /><br />However, streaming from amazon was a good experience and I would do it again. I'm looking forward to Part Two.

B0052GACNM|4.0|Very easy and satisfying music both with with great vocals and a great arrangements. A great choice of singing partners with this this accomplished master. A great deal of nostalgia here......perfefect for those of us of that era. Great dinner music or cocktail music.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|This is one of the best non-fiction books I have ever read. It really touched my heartstrings to read how this poor young boys and his family had to live and how their mother struggled to keep food and clothes on her children while putting up with a drunken no good husband.

B00CJGP116|5.0|Marc's new CD is a great album that takes him back to his origin that started with Otra Nota in 1993. The Album should be named Marc Anthony 1.0 or Nueva Nota.  All the tracks are great and his voice is clear, powerful and full of emotion. A great addition to your Marc Anthony music collection.
B001XUPD94|5.0|Excellent story, directed by mr cheese himself, William Shatner.  Couldn't be better! Fits perfectly with the Star Trek franchise.  A very under rated story.

B00B7G3NFU|4.0|I feel that the physical connection in this film is about much more than just sex. It's definitely the right of passage for everyone to experience and it' no different for this individual. His warmth, spirit and unfailing perseverance/love of life are inspirational.

B009XIXVU6|5.0|For those that may wonder why they are in whatever life-role they are in, this book may help at least start to put some of it in perspective.  Many different characters are followed through a span of their lives, and events that put them where they are.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|*SPOILERS NOTICE* for the 2-3 people who haven't seen the movie by now, but feel compelled to read the reviews.<br /><br />As good as the first Iron Man was, the 3rd movie was horrible.  I can forgive a certain number of plot holes big enough to drive a Audi though (more on that in a second) since the whole point of a action-packed big-budget early-summer block-buster is to entertain, but there were so many problems with this one that my brain kept reminding me that what I was watching was preposterous.  Here are a few that annoyed me the most.<br /><br />1) EVERYBODY seemed to drive an Audi.  Okay, I get Tony owning an R8 and I'll even buy Pepper driving the RS7, but honestly, even the BAD GUY drove an Audi?  Talk about product placement overkill.  Did the pizza delivery guy drive a TT as well?  I'll have to keep an eye out for it in a future extended \\"director's cut\\" of the movie.<br /><br />2) One size fits all Iron Man suits.  It doesn't seem to matter if you are tall, short, fat, or skinny - an Iron Man suit will fit you and function perfectly.  Tony Stark could make a 2nd fortune as a tailor.<br /><br />3) Something like 500 Iron Man suits (including the Lego suit) that don't actually need a person inside of them to operate as autonomous entities.  'nuff said.<br /><br />4) That kid. One question - why?<br /><br />5) The self-destruct \\"button\\" in every Iron Man suit.  Even Doctor Doofenshmirtz knows better that to install one of them (and yet he does anyway - so perplexing, but I degrees).<br /><br />6) Pretty much everything that happened in the last 5 minutes of the movie.  Every single sub-plot and open issue is wrapped-up in a convenient (and absolutely ridiculous) montage.  Seriously, the only way it could have been made any more clear that this might be the last movie in the series would have been if Robert Downey Jr. looked right at the camera and said \\"THE END!  DO YOU GET IT PEOPLE?  EVERY SUB-PLOT AND LOOSE END HAS BEEN WRAPPED-UP!  THE ONE THING THAT MADE ME TRULY UNIQUE IS GONE!  IT'S OVER!  GO AWAY!\\"<br /><br />*sigh* - please don't foul-up Avengers 2.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Great read with some twists and turns that are not expected.  As usual, greed and egos get in the way of doing what's right, but Harry Bosch can help set things straight.
B00AYB12PC|3.0|We watched it till the end, but it was cheesy mostly due to the fact that it's an older movie.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This over hyped product spamming all news offers nothing new to consumers. Definitely something that Apple TV has been doing successfully for a loooong time. If it could stream local content from PCs/Macs it would have caught my attention. That is something we are waiting for a long time to stream downloaded local movies from a HDD to TV (1080p). Mac OS X with Airplay delivers it so looking forward for it.<br />I have given this product 2 stars as it is dead cheap. $35 (with 3 months of netflix) makes it cheaper than a meal.<br /><br />Update after receiving the product:<br /><br />Chromecast review based on day 1 usage:<br /><br />Pros:<br />Plays youtube and netflix (only 2 apps being supported currently) effortlessly which my tv already has built in, so no good for me.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. Chrome tab casting kills the performance of the device from which it is being casted. My Mac Air went dead from full battery in less than an hour.<br />2. There are audio sync issues as well with the chrome tab casting.<br />3. When you play a video from a chrometab in yupptv, cricinfo or any other websites, while on full screen it limits you to do anything else on the laptop.<br />4. The device should be continuously plugged on charge either to a plug point which makes it tacky or to a USB port within the TV (If the TV has one).<br /><br />More to update soon.

B00B7Y0206|1.0|I downloaded it and looked up a song and it took 2 hours to load literally!!!!! It wasted my battery plus when it did load it played 2 seconds of it and stopped working.  The only thing I liked about it was that it was free and I didn't spend money on it. I would have gave it 0 stars but it wouldn't let me

B009XIXVU6|4.0|I thought the characters were well drawn.  I appreciated the nuances in character, and the realistic view of people as being neither blameless nor evil.
0316247545|5.0|I love this book because the whole thing is in color, there is an exclusive interview with Lauren Faust,  lyrics to all songs starting from s1 and ending at s3, and so much more .Also, you could get to see never before seen photos as well.<br />I can honestly say this book was so worth buying
B0087IT8FK|5.0|This award-winning French film is based on the true story of a wealthy quadriplegic, Phillipe,  who chooses among the applicants for his replacement caretaker a man who really doesn't want the job.  Driss is a thief who has applied only to be eligible for the French equivalent of unemployment insurance.  Phillipe's intuitions, however, prove to be right on.  The two form an unlikely bond which brings laughter, tears, and lessons in relationships.  An excellent film!

B00BB8RKH6|4.0|The climax of this film (the court hearing) should live as a classic.  I have never experienced a moment in which the best and the worst in a person are placed in sharper contrast.  And the moment of decision for this person's \\"soul\\" is felt in its full weight.  Denzel Washington outdoes himself as a heroic pilot who brings about an unbelievable crash landing in a virtually hopeless situation - then has to deal with his even tougher down-to-earth addiction.  This isn't an easy film to watch but totally worth it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This book wasn't was I thought it would be and it  you look at the title of this book and think it would be a good choice to give someone who is a devote Christian I would stop and think twice but it never hurts to know what someone else believes.<br /><br />I recommend if you have time to go to the NPR site and listen to the author's interview on Fresh Air.[...]<br />The authors family had fled from Iran to the United States and when he was a teenager he converted to Christianity. He went to a college run by Jesuits and began to question his faith. In the NPR interview he says one of the reasons he left Christianity and went back to Islam was because he had problems with the notion of the Trinity. He goes on to talk about the book as wanting to show how a peasant and day laborer executed as a state prisoner was thought as by his disciples as God. He goes on to say that almost every word written about Jesus was written by people who did not know Jesus. That it fell to Greek influenced Jews who were familiar to the concept of God men from mythology to transfer the Jewish messiah to a Roman demigod.<br /><br />The main thing I got from the book was how cruel the Roman rule was to the Jews and in some ways it is worth reading just for that even if you don't agree with the rest of the book. My brief synopsis of the book would be people called themselves the Messiah before Jesus and also after Jesus so why believe that He was the Messiah and the author goes through his reasons for believing this. He shows how he feels the New Testament was written to fit Jesus as the Messiah because he wouldn't fit from writings from the Old Testament. I recommend also ( as long as it is still free for kindle) getting [[ASIN:B007D64VX6 English Translation of the Qur'an]] I just looked at this in Kindle cloud reader and I typed in Jesus in search just to see how he was written about. The author writes about Jesus be referred to as the son of Mary ( rather than the son of Joseph) and I sawit similar in this Quran.<br /><br />I would say its an easy read but I can't say how accurate it is and I read it with a grain of salt because some things just sound odd. He wrote about a famine and said people were reduced to eating their leather shoes and belts - why wouldn't the word sandals be used instead of shoes. There are other odd turns of phrases.  I think it is important to listen to other viewpoints that are different from what we believe. I read this as an ARC from Netgalley.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|Based on the true story of Mark O'Brien, this film is about how, totally crippled by polio, he is able to \\"become a man\\" sexually through the assistance of a therapist who is a sexual surrogate.  That's right, they literally have sex.  This sensitive and nuanced telling of his story demonstrates that sex is (or can be) much more than a physical experience.  Fed by his Catholic faith, Mark's straightforward honesty, his sense of humor, and his poetic sensibility affect all his relationships - with his caregivers (both male and female), his priest, and the surrogate.  Who can't help but love him?  A fine, fine film.

B009RWRIKM|5.0|This documentary features the work of much-loved German choreographer, Pina Bausch.  Unfortunately she died a few days before filming began, leaving her troupe to perform her works as they mourned her loss.  She selected the dancers by an arduous process.  They are all ages, all races.  Each member has a closeup on camera as their voice over talks about their experience with Pina.  Each exhibits a commanding yet simple presence.  She was like a guru, and the troupe was like nuns or monks.  Some of the pieces are performed outside, some in public spaces.  One is on a stage covered with earth and sand.  I love dance, but I have never been so viscerally moved as I am by Pina's creations.  This is a film to see over and over.
044651506X|5.0|Plum Island, Night Fall, and Wild Fire are all very thought provoking works.  We can't rely on everything Nelson DeMille says, but we can't rely on the media either!
B008N9AASC|5.0|This wordless documentary is stunning.  Beginning with wondrous footage of the natural world and native peoples, it flows to beauties created by human beings -  architecture, dance, sculpture, sand paintings.  Then the film shifts mood as it moves to segments picturing our mechanized processing of animals for food and the suffering thereby caused to animals and people, the objectification of women, and modern traffic.  Accompanied by music perfectly suited to each segment,  picture is indeed worth a thousand words.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|I downloaded this app so i could print directly from my Kindle. It automatically sync'd with my wireless HP printer and i was ready to go.  Very easy to use.  Just love it and it was free!
140006922X|1.0|I don't understand why this book is being hyped by the media as a historical account of the life of Jesus, when the author himself (Reza Aslan) is a devout Muslim, and not a trained historian.  Well, just the fact that he's a Muslim tells you of a huge conflict of interest.  Can you imagine a Christian writing a book about prophet Muhammad and pretending there's no conflict of interest?  At any rate, all of the claims about Jesus are centuries old Muslim claims about Jesus.  There's no new information here.  If anyone's ever been caught into a conversation about religion with a Muslim (e.g. a Muslim trying to convert you), you will realize those are the very same claims you find in this book.  It's old stuff.  Classic Muslim attempts at deconstructing Christianity.  But let's get back to the conflict of interest: I mean, come on!
1603425381|5.0|I really like this book.  I am fairly new to crochet, but the instructions and diagrams are easy to read.  It uses nice colors.....not just one color throughout the whole book.  My only suggestion would to use a spiral binding, so the book stays open easier.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Great book, i have read a lot of books about the historical jesus (yeshua) and his views are similar to SGF Brandon the scholar who wrote Jesus and the Zealots in 1967, also his views are similar to James D.Tabor who also wrote  good books called Paul and Jesus, and the Jesus Dynasty, I also think the works by John d Crossan, Marcus Borg, Richard Horsley, and especialy NT Wright have also written great books , while it may seem that their works conflict in their views of Jesus, I do Believe that these authors  each have a piece to the overall picture of who jesus of nazareth was in history because all of these views are in the new testament gospels themselves so they each tell the truth even though they emphasize different aspects of this remarkable life, So yes Jesus was a political, social, and religious revolutionary who brought the kingdom of God to earth through his actions and teachings and taught his followers to do the same, and he was a threat to the elite jews of his society based in the temple and to the Roman Empire and their control of Judea. Also just because mr aslan is muslim he is also a historian who has done his research and has come up with a similar view that has come up before, but for a new generation, all these other scholars that i have mentioned have different backgrounds regarding beleifs, so their religion should not be so much of an issue in this case, because Jesus was zealous (passionate) for the kingdom of god and was killed for it, but his death did have a purpose and the only thing i would disagree with mr. aslan is even though to the authorities Jewish and roman it may have seemed that jesus lost he didn't.

B00DFFI7K2|4.0|The first GI Joe film, \\"Rise of Cobra,\\" punched so many holes in the Joe mythos that Jon Chu's \\"Retaliation\\" found itself in the position of having to fix its own canon. Unfortunately, removing GI Joe from its '80s context--and thus losing the Vietnam War as an underpinning of the characters' psychology--means that a modern Joe film will never be perfect no matter how much spackling you do, but in my opinion, \\"Retaliation\\" still manages to pull out some charm. In fact it's a loud, fun, slightly brainless action movie, and that's never unwelcome.<br /><br />Ultimately, the film does feel sort of semidigested: large chunks of exposition are randomly shoved into the plot, and a couple of characters are almost totally extraneous. You can definitely see that it went through a LOT of editing, too--some sequences, such as the transition from the surviving Joes in the desert to Snake-Eyes with Jinx and the Blind Master in Japan, are embarrassingly clunky. (The Blind Master should also be called the Exposition Master. Writing team Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick give us some good one-liners, but they don't seem sure of how to convey a plot centered on a mute character.) But \\"Retaliation\\" wins back some points by reversing several of the blunders of the first film--eighty-sixing Cobra Commander's bizarre monster mask, giving Storm Shadow back some moral ambiguity, and letting the Joes rely on good old-fashioned guns instead of the totally uncharacteristic and, quite frankly, silly accelerator suits. It still feels cartoonish, but not in a bad way.<br /><br />The newcomers to the film franchise also have a good amount of life to them. Special mention has to go to Ray Stevenson, who's clearing having a ball hamming it up as the murderous Firefly. Jonathan Pryce, as our Zartan-disguised-as-the-US-President, takes great big joyous bites out of the scenery as he threatens an assembly of world leaders.<br /><br />This is not a serious film. But it's silly, goofy, loud and over-the-topin all the right places, and gets more things right than wrong. I'll take it.
0425263991|5.0|I discovered this series by accident. I was giving away some of my older books, and came upon one of her earlier books in the Psy-Changeling series. Looking at the introduction, I realized I had not read it, and put it on my reading pile. I was hooked. After that, I read the series in order, and was able to understand each character's role. I am so glad I did since &#34;Heart of Obsidian&#34; has many references to past events. I also am so glad to see the development of a another psy's role, and it fits so well in picking up where the last book of the seies left off.<br /><br />Nalini Singh is one of my favorite authors for another very basic reason. I was an instructor at the junior high and college levels for many years as well as working in rehabilitation centers. One skill that I had to have, and tried to teach was good grammar and punctuation skills for teaching, writing reports of all types, and filling out insurance forms. If you do not have good writing skills for these, serious problems do arise. Teaching was very difficult since many students either did not care, or did not have the proper background for writing. I could not believe that we had to have remedial classes in college in addition to tutoring. Nalini's books are so easy to read because she has this gift for writing, and everything flows from one part to another straightlyforwardly. Also, whoever edits her writing must also be good because any errors I have picked up are very few, and seem to related to typing errors more than anything else. Thank you so much for this. For me, this is a gift.

B00CL68QVQ|2.0|Loved the book; in fact, listened to it via audible. Given it was a first-person narrative; it set up perfectly for this type of presentation. Great character development and incredible depth. The movie, in my opinion, strayed way too far from what made the book so spectacular. With chunks of plot completely left out, twisted about, or made shallow, it was about as satisfying as a fortune cookie - minus the fortune. Without reference to the book, I'm sure the movie quite capably stands on its own. Unfortunately, watching it after having recently read/listened to the book left me disappointed.
B001KQKD50|5.0|\\"Nursery Cryme\\" was the first Genesis album I heard and bought. I had read in a magazine that their music to some extent resembled Procol Harum, which was my favourite band at the time.<br /><br />I must admit that I was somewhat puzzled by the album when it finally showed up in the mail; the album was not easy to find in Denmark at this point as the group did not yet have a name here.<br /><br />Of course, I could well enjoy the melodic passages in \\"The Musical Box\\" and \\"Seven Stones\\", but overall I felt frustration over the many musical antics that constantly disturbed the tranquility.<br /><br />I managed to eventually get to appreciate the album, and over the next few years \\"Foxtrot\\" and \\"Selling England By the Pound\\" were also to be found in my record collection.<br /><br />It's still \\"The Musical Box\\" and \\"Seven Stones\\", which are my favorites, but aside from \\"The Fountain of Salmacis\\", which I never really have come to love, I still think it is one of the group's very best albums. The album's also the first with the classic line-up Gabriel, Banks, Rutherford, Hckett and Collins.<br /><br />The lyrics are refreshingly different and at first rather mysterious and incomprehensible - not least the weird story in \\"The Musical Box\\" of Henry and Cynthia. This song was also the inspiration for the artist Paul Whitehead's haunting cover artwork.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey is an excellent series filled with fascinating, well-acted characters; stunning sets; beautiful period costumes and hairstyles; and captivating plot lines.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The board game of all board games, it is evidence of modern-day progress. The simplest analogy for the game's premise: where in Risk you take over the world through military might, in Settlers of Catan you take over through economic prowess. Involved are: trading, luck (from the die), strategy, and wisdom with money.<br />Initially the game is for up to four players, and you build settlements, cities, and streets to earn points. The first player to reach the point value wins. Each settlement, city, or streets requires resource cards (Wood, Sheep, Wheat, Clay, and Stone) to buy, and you gain resource cards by building a settlement near a resource on the map (which has a number on it) and the die must role your number. It's a simple premise, learned in 10 minutes of playing, so even some children can play along--although there are children's editions to the game.<br />I bought Settlers of Catan in Germany about five years ago and have played it regularly EVER SINCE. In addition to purchasable fifth and sixth players, three expansions were developed to make the game continually exciting and interesting. Whenever I move to college or to home or to a travel for a while in a different country, I bring Settlers of Catan. You MUST acquire this game for a well-rounded life.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|It is a lot of fun.  I enjoy the free spins.  I wish we got more than one.<br />I enjoy the free games too.
B00D6C0D42|5.0|This is the scariest movie I know.  I first saw it in 1984 in a movie house in the West Village, today on Amazon.  The ending was different.  I liked the original ending better, though it has the same sense as this one. The original is less gentle.<br /><br />People say this is a film version of Orwell's 1984.  Maybe.  But, there's nothing like it elsewhere in film, and it's a must-see for anyone who thinks of themselves as a film buff. It's a kick to see Jonathan Pryce as the good guy for a change.  I recall Michael Palin as a better villain in the original.<br /><br />With the benefit of hindsight, the movie is, above all, prophetic.  See it and weep.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Lots of action and River is one of a kind.  The Cast is funny, the movie is one of the best action films
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cute! If your a Despicable Me fan, you must play this! The minions are so cute! You get to play mini-games &amp; get new minions! This app is a must have!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Glad I was led to read this. Thank You to my sister for buying it for me. Thanks Anita!  Relax
B000FC1AGG|4.0|This book kept me on my toes till the very end! Looove it would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a humorous romance!
B007THA4FI|1.0|The book was hyped by the written reviews I saw yet when I purchased the book I was sorely disappointed. Filthy language, boring characters, and a maddeningly slow plot. Don't waste your time or money is my message to others.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it's love the game so much and I hope y'all make another one because it is so fun !!<br /><br />  Love Elva
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I love this game. I have always loved the movies and I was excited to play the game. Wish it was easier to get cash without paying with real money.
B005LAIIJY|1.0|unrealistic,predictable, boring,contradicting,are some of the reasons not to watch this more like a fantasy movie.<br />If you watch the n word over used, and then to pick up a pair of pistols and be able to call yourself a gunslinger. Bullets were too expensive to waste and most gunslingers died before 30. There was nothing real about this movie. I requested a refund.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Love this game. It has kept me and my kids occupied for quite some time. I have already beat it but I'm working on getting all of my gems now. Hopefully they will update and add more levels.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I recommend it to anyone wanting to improve their memory.<br />You have to figure out how to draw a line from same color dot to dot, while using the entire play surface.<br />You really work out your brain as you progress through the levels of play.
B00DP3IGJ6|2.0|I am not a Tom Cruise fan but I thought the trailer for Oblivion looked interesting.  However, I was disappointed when it just seemed to be sandy land scenes and chasing/repairing drones.  My seventeen year old son was even bored with it and we didnt watch all the movie.  Amazon did not give you a chance to rent so I purchased it and am sorry I did.  What a waste of money.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|To start I recommend this season to all my friends.<br />I started watching the Dr. once I upgraded my cable and received the BBC America channel.<br />It was hit and miss on the shows, then when the season ended, I found it was a free on amazon prime, so I was able to watch the hole season in order and enjoyed it.<br />It's a must see for everyone.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|App crashes a lot, and the time line is never accurate. Typical Facebook app problems. They will never fix it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This trilogy is a great deal for fans of the Dark Knight films. Much better than buying the discs individually.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|How do you not love these books, i think half the world is still obsessed i know i've re read them several times. great books!
B00A7L00XE|2.0|After receiving the cd and playing all the songs, I found there were only two or three songs I really liked.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved these books and i was skeptical but i loved every minute of them.<br />thank you for offering them online.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I rented Jack the Giant Slayer for my kids 6 & 11 and ended up watching it with them.  The special effects were really quite good, and I enjoyed the creativity shown throughout the film.  Was a bit worried about some of the scenes for my 6 year old, but she took them in stride w/out being scared or upset about them.  Probably best for 8-12 age range overall. Fun movie, the ending was pretty dramatic.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Well i wasnt going to stop with just the first book so of course why not bother to buy it on my kindle. =)
B0017HMF6W|4.0|Hitchcock's biggest crowd-pleaser is a mystery thriller that becomes less and less plausible the more the story unfolds - but it doesn't matter, because the movie is so entertaining and enjoyable and its lead characters so appealing that you suspend your disbelief almost immediately. Cary Grant plays Roger Thornhill, a dapper Manhattan advertising executive (the suit Grant wears has been called the greatest movie suit ever) who through a series of terrible misunderstandings becomes pursued by both a nest of enemy spies and the police. As he struggles to solve the mystery and clear his name, he meets Eve Kendall, an alluring woman (Eva Marie Saint at the peak of her beauty) who figures to be either his undoing or his salvation. Ernest Lehman's script provides wonderful dialogue, and the scene in the train's dining car where Kendall lures Thornhill into her berth is electric. With James Mason as Phillip Vandamm, the villain, Martin Landau as his henchman, and Leo C. Carroll as the shadowy government official. [[ASIN:B00HU8VK4K Phil's Favorite 500: Loves of a Moviegoing Lifetime (2014 edition)]]
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I read a lot before sleep on my Kindle, and this App is a wonderful and flexible alarm clock, whether I'm at home or traveling. It's very easy to use . . . and create different alarms for weekends, workdays, etc.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|This was my first time reading a Neil Gaiman book.  I loved it.  It lived up to they hype and was dark and fascinating.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I can't really complain too much as this game was free but there were no directions or instructions so I have not the foggiest idea how to play it! I figured out some puzzle with a horse and then there was nothing! I'll go back to Temple Run.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I love this song, it reminds me of early days of Funk with delicious bass and catchy lyrics and sweet synth.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|An incredible but tragic love story. Makes you realize how precious life is and how grateful we must be for everyday given to us.

B002VPE1WK|4.0|This worked so much better than the normal camera bag and the price was excellent for the quality of the product.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Storyline in sequel is too predictable- not much body to storyline.  Sexual content is way overdone. I would not read this series if suggested to me having known more about writing style and content.
B00000K31Q|5.0|I gave this as a gift and she LOVED it, amazon was the only place that had it and it can in PERFECT condition still in the plastic.
B0090KZDSK|4.0|Another great book in the series, as always the ending came to soon. I look forward to reading the forth Book!
030789701X|5.0|I don't use it unless im stuck but this book (yeah real book) is very helpful.Worth it if you are a serious gamer.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|Should have gotten one yrs ago...no more messy lighter fluid just 2 pcs of crumpled up newspaper in the bottom and light it up and set it on grill and sit back in about 20 minutes you should have good hot coals to grill on...<br />A good hint for grillin always use KINGSFORD Charcoal.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is AWESOME hands down. The only problem is that after I got the update the app kept re- downloading the update every time I open the app. I'm pretty sure though it's only gonna happen to me so to anyone else I totally recommended it
140006922X|1.0|The author of this fiction is  a confirmed Muslim and not an Historian and is clearly presenting  biased  opinions.  This author clearly has an  agenda to present. An agenda that if changed to an analysis of Mohammad would earn a Fatwa.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|This show is great! I did not realized how many episodes their are.  Having the ability to see all seasons at my own pace is wonderful.<br /><br />Thank you Amazon!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I love this game. I could play it for hours. It is very well done. There is so much to do.
B00404YUG2|5.0|This book has a similar message to other motivational books, with an appeal to the creative mind.  It is worth listening to a few times.  It would make a great gift for an artist, business person, or writer.
1402568851|5.0|The narrator is perfect for the character of Christopher.  You fully believe he has Asperger's Syndrome.  The story captured me from the opening words until the closing line.  The title of the book is interesting  -  it is a mild descriptive phrase and yet the events which follow the discovery of the dog are cataclysmic for Christopher, the narrator and main character.  Along the way the listener learns the many quirky habits,  preferences and paranoias  of a person whose brain operates in some unusual ways.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Good game. It has plenty to do and helps pass the time wherever I am at. Good for everyone to play.
B000JMLFLW|1.0|I have the movie and like it very much but never ordered the book.  Can't imagine why you asked me.
B008LXZFH6|3.0|If you just want to lay back and not think, this is the movie for you. Will Ferrell is predictable but a laugh a minute and the story is set upt for Anchorman II, no doubt.
0767903862|1.0|For a prospective traveler to &#34;down under&#34; I recomment reading this book.  It will take time but well worth it.
B0060FXDCG|5.0|Looking forward to making popcorn and seeing my grandsons eyes light up when we enjoy these three movies together.  I think I'll be as excited as he will be.
B006S086AM|4.0|This movie is a rare gem.  Great story and not overdone or silly.  Kristine Stewart for all her drama is really a god actor.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Love this series. Just recently started reading this series and am hooked. Have read the first eight books so far and am working on the ninth and plan to finish them all. These books keep you hooked and I typically finish each book in two days even during the work week. I just can't put the books down!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Based on a favorable review of this novel, I was led to expect something a bit better, but it was at least OK for the price. Generally, it was a good read but had a few too many formulaic plot details and repetitive style elements for my taste. Also, it would have greatly benefited from a more imaginative development of the dystopian world in which it is set. Therefore, I wouldn't put it in the top ranks of this genre but it will probably be remembered favorably by those of us who enjoy this type of fiction. Given the success of this book, the author may now be able to hire the services of an experienced editor for his next novel, one I look forward to reading.
B008Y1YK0I|4.0|I have the blu-ray (restored) version. I've never seen this movie before but I'm glad I finally did a few days ago. Yes, its long but it's also measured and paced very well to allow the story to unfold in a much more natural way than most modern movies. It allows you to more fully understand the character and his motives/choices etc. The blu-ray video quality is exceptional especially considering the age of the source material. I can't give it five stars however for picture quality because there are spots that have either damage or some other (albeit minor) flaw that takes just a tiny bit away from the film over all. To spite the few flaws I saw this film looks fantastic, really. In some spots it looks like a much more recent movie, it's that good. The sound, well the sound was good but not great as you can expect based on the soundtrack's age. If you're a film buff and haven't seen this movie, borrow it or buy it. Either way you will be treated to quite an adventure. Enjoy.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Free app for my phone/tablet who doesn't like? I would recommend it to anyone if it comes free again. Very nice.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Makes Sense - Eat less food to loose weight, which in turn helps your blood sugar and blood pressure normalize!
1616614609|5.0|The game is pretty solid in terms of its mechanics, and ability to build custom decks combined with the opportunity to purchase new card sets makes this a fairly flexible and extensible.
B009GX69RK|4.0|I don't want to give anything away, but this season brought us closer to a lot of characters. Nick (Jake), wowza! What a kisser!
B001V5CIFI|5.0|We asolutely love this movie!  I don't really know what else to say! Just buy it, and you won't be disaapointed!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I thought this was a great read with a nice twist.  Definitely a fast read and great for the summer poolside :)
B00BU18U82|4.0|Must be a really good game.  Can't get my 9 year old boy to stop playing it without a fight.
B000FCK8ZK|5.0|I loved the dark humor and the thought process that is Dexters mind. Its like six flags for the demented.
B00CRWJ7VC|3.0|leans toward reincarnation I find that to be for people trying to find purpose in life with out jesus christ
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun game. Similar to temple run. My son loves it plus its free. Save your gold coins to unlock upgrades don't waste  on revives.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best show on television -  would highly recommend this program.  Hate for it to be over and have to wait for season 4
B00005JLEU|5.0|I bought this movie for my son and he absolutely loves it...it's become his favorite movie, by far.  A joy to watch!
B00BIPCY14|5.0|This show is different and all the characters have depth. I highly recommend this show. I need season 4 to be on prime asap! You will blow through this season.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I have seen the movie and it was good but the book is much better. There is way more adventure to the book and I loved every minute I read it.
B009DBKKIY|5.0|What a treat this cd is. I'm happy that this compilation is available. My friends love it!<br />As a audiophile I also appreciate the quality of the recordings--exemplary
B001AQR3IU|4.0|They've done a smart job of translating Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess graphic novel. (Which, btw, isthe best way to experience this story as it's a gorgeously, fully illustrated novel.)
B000HL0EEE|5.0|Love 'em!  JJ Abrams, keep them coming please.  That's  what we need is more star treks man!  Kee them coming!
B00005221M|5.0|I use this as a teaching tool.  The scenes can give students a good idea about frontier life and the wilderness.  The story enhances a presentation about the story makes the politics of the time engaging.  The new material included is priceless for an inveterate fan of the movie like me.
B00DRDVHA4|5.0|\\"Superb\\", \\"Spectacular\\", \\"Fabuloso\\".  The Man, The King Of Salsa is back in his 1st Salsa recording EP in almost a Decade.  Great Job Marc!!!
B009WUBERW|2.0|I like action films and like to watch the movies of most of these actors, but as a group they seem to have forgotten how to act.  That said, the second half of the movie was fairly entertaining as it was action-packed and some decent FX.
B0054SMIH6|4.0|In retrospect, the plot elements are somewhat familiar, but with enough unexpected plot twists and so well-executed in this movie it was a complete joy to watch them roll out.  The acting is superb -- McConaughey gives his best performance ever, and the rest of the cast is excellent, down to the supporting roles of the prison cons. The linchpin to the plot is how the Lincoln lawyer can solve his dilemma of defending a client he knows is responsible for sending another of his clients to life in prison, and the suspense builds to the very end. This is a keeper, one to watch again and again.  Highly recommended!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Starting the game on a new device. After providing a lot of information, I am still hoping to have my progress transferred to the new device.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|This remastered version is so good that I feel like I'm seeing it for the first time. I have always loved this series and I still move my lips to the dialogue. Happy, happy!
B004E547D8|5.0|This is simply good entertainment. Great cast of memorable characters and a fun story. Lots of talent in this cast and they work well together.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|It was exactly what I was looking for.  I had checked in the stores but could not find this DVD anymore
B004SDEP38|5.0|Must Have, this is a great app for your smart phone, Worth the price, I do highly recommend this app.

B002B00GT2|5.0|Keith Ferazzi completely transformed my view of business. I shared this book with a friend, and he immediately began building his own network and is now well on his way in the Google interviewing process. This book encourages and inspires, and recommends changes that improve your life NOW.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Must Have, this is a great app for your smart phone, Worth the price, I do highly recommend this app.
B00B2YH7D6|5.0|This is an amazing story about a music studio and its sound board that recorded some of the greatest albums of all-time! Dave Grohl put this entire documentary together, along with the soundtrack, with some great artists who've recorded there. From Neil Young and Tom Petty, to Fear and Rage Against The Machine, there's been a ton of great music that was recorded at this studio. Sadly, as they tell you, the studio closed down because of the modern age of recording with Pro Tools. If you love music, and love knowing the the deep and rich history, then get yourself a copy of this documentary and its soundtrack. You won't be dissapointed!
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Must Have, this is a great app for your smart phone, Worth the price, I do highly recommend this app.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Very much reminds me of an Apple product... it makes you do what it wants you to do and isn't very intuitive!
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Must Have, this is a great app for your smart phone, Worth the price, I do highly recommend this app.
B00BLCHYKU|2.0|Although this gets decent marks for historical accuracy, I didn't enjoy the way it was presented. It is like Game of Thrones without  the drama but with much of the bloodshed.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|Must Have, this is a great app for your smart phone, Worth the price, I do highly recommend this app.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|...you might as well watch all the seasons. I'm an old Masterpiece Theater fan from way back (the original Upstairs Downstairs was a favorite) and this is just a more modern continuation.
B0055S348W|5.0|Must Have, this is a great app for your smart phone, Worth the price, I do highly recommend this app.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This show is so cute! Steve Carell is terrific as Gru. Our family greatly enjoyed this movie. I would highly recommend.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Michelle G. .... this is supposed to be like the Nintendo version!! Anyways.... I love this game it is soooo much fun!! I recommend it to everyone who likes using their imagination!!
B005NKGEP2|5.0|It was a Different story.  Kept you guessing!  Characters were believable & kept you interested.  Ended good, but not as expected.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is just like Temple Run except it's a Ninon Run!!!!!! U can save up enough bananas to get things. Plus u get to watch other minions work and knock them off if they're in ur way. If u love Temple run and Despicable Me u will love this game soooooo much!!!!!!!!!
B005V4ZEY2|5.0|top notch security. this application is exactly what I want it to be. lightweight and functional. I use it on all android devices.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|This book keeps you guessing. No character is safe... or who you think they are. I can't wait to read what happens next.
B00CEQ1JOO|4.0|this doll is so cute. very nice hair color!! this doll is little bit small isn't it. i want to other dolls too.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I think what I love most about this series is the setting. I like to imagine myself there, enjoying the beautiful countryside and quaint village of Larkrise. The characters are engaging, at times funny and at times touching. This is so much better than anything on TV right now.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Shiny! enough said, I'm hoping that at some point this series can be revived and brought back to TV, Heck maybe Amazon or Netflix can buy the rights to produce new episodes.
B000NY12LO|5.0|A must read for any adult, especially a teacher like myself. There are lessons to be learned in this book.
B00867GJYK|5.0|I absolutely love this movie and so did my kiddos during our end of the year party at school! Thanks!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love that the love story doesn't end. The ending makes me want more! Will be looking forward to the next book !
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Wonderful book! Could not put it down. I would recommend it. Very suspenseful and can't wait to read the next book
B003R5C5JE|4.0|I ordered this for my nephew's, he absolutely LOVES the Back to the Future series (already got him the first one). It looks nice,  very well detailed replica .....I think he a fanatic of the movies and it goes where he goes. He only afford the replica DeLorean in his home, at least untill he can afford the One that lights up the real DeLorean
B00A2IUHM6|1.0|The funny parts are on youtube, but the rest of the scenes sucked!  Get some other movie or item on this website.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|I heard a lot about The Dark Knight since it was released in 2008 and it exceeded expectations. I was pleasantly surprised by the complex character development of Harvey Dent and the Joker and the film overall was outstanding.
B009X01C64|5.0|It's a high quality, padded case. I was worried that it would be bulky, but it's not too thick. I also appreciate the ability to rotate the screen horizontally and vertically. Good stuff!
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|This game is really fun.  It takes strategy, careful planning and speed to get to the goal. It's fun to watch all the little men collect the money and build the towns.
B000KKPN5C|3.0|I like this flash, but realized later I should have purchased a more advanced flash. This is not much better than using the flash that comes with your camera.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|Fun, Fun, Fun!  This game has a story line as well as great graphics.  I'm looking forward to more versions coming out!
B00COHAUD4|3.0|This was a good film with lots of suspends, thrills and &#34;jumps&#34;. However, as fans of Del Toro know, he is obsessed with dark fantasy and fairies, and it comes across in films like this where such an influence has no place. The ending with the moths and stuff was just silly. For me it ruined an otherwise good film.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I loved how the characters were connected and entwined with one another.  Each character faced the same days with slightly different perspectives as they experienced the joys and challenges navigating middle school with its related problems, pressures, joys, sadness and growth.  I hated the incidents of unnecessary, but very realistic meanness of some of the students, which are unfortunately a part of life.  Auggie is an awesome character!  His descriptions of school, his fears, challenges, and successes were often no different from other middle schoolers.  The fact that they were told from the perspective of a special needs student made a real impact on the reader.  As a result, this book makes a great real for all middle schoolers, their parents, and their teachers.  I am recommending this book to my middle school grandchildren as I think this will appeal to them.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I came across this show accidentally since I do not watch the USA channel very much.  I found it on my Kindle Fire and watched every single episode available.  I highly recommend this show - great storylines, great acting, great characters.  Love it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Im not a big reader. But couldn't put down any of the books in this series.  I would highly recommend them.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I love this movie.  My daughter doesn't love it, and it is a little slow in the beginning but gets better as the movie goes on.  Whenever I need a laugh, this is the movie I go to.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Mr. Hosseini is one of my favorite authors and this book is one of his best. The story was riveting, the characters will stay with me forever. I didn't want it to end, but I couldn't wait to see how it finished.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|my daughter bought as a christmas gift for her boyfriend.  great movie, but i'm prejudice because i love just about anything disney.  great family movie.
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|I have never watched a minute of the Star Trek television series but this movie was a flawless sci-fi action movie.
B004LWZW9C|5.0|like this dvd especially the out takes.  i think my husband and watched it at lead 5 times in 1 week.  very good movie.  if you liked &#34;valentines day&#34;, you will like this.

B00340I4KG|1.0|I can't believe somebody paid to produce this movie, someone passed on the script and a omebody actually made this film.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|i had to buy this dvd since my college goes to the &#34;mansion&#34; where it was filmed, monmouth university.  it was cheaper here than the college bookstore - and i just love the movie.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|Several difficulty settings, many boosts to choose from, different size options.<br /><br />Overall it is the best of this type of puzzle game I've played.
0525953728|5.0|bought for my husband as a birthday after he saw the author interviewed on television.  he's not a reader but he enjoyed this book.
0553801473|1.0|The first chapter of A Game of Thrones involved The Other's attacking and killing a group of men from the Night's Watch. After reading that introductory chapter is there anyone who would have wagered that five books later The Others would have barely appeared again and done very little when they did?<br /><br />This is an example of the issues with Martin's story over the last two books. New stories are being added to the narrative and the story from the first few books is is moving at a glacial pace. A story that started with 7 or 8 main characters has expanded to over 25 and the series is suffering as a result.<br /><br />There are long stretches in this book where nothing happens. It's  adreadfully slow read and does not match the excitement and thrills of the first three books in the series.

B008A1NSTG|5.0|bought this movie for my daughter as a gift because she is a marine biology major.  me personally, i hate movies on animals because they always make me cry.  this movie was amazing - and yes, it made me cry.
B004SBULWE|4.0|Works but a few persistent apps may need further and more thorough encouragement.<br /><br />Otherwise a worthwhile app that will get you another 5-10% of battery life back
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love playing this game. It is so much fun. I have only had minor problems with connecting to friends but otherwise a great game.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 9 year old loves this app. He said it's fun fun fun. I must confess I really enjoy it too.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|Good movie for Tom Hardy fans.  Nick Nolte was excellent.  Good to see Tom Hardy in a different performance as Bane which made me become a Tom Hardy fan.
B00847KFDS|2.0|I have other music that John Fogerty wrote and sang but his latest CD I didn't enjoy. I sent the CD on to my brother because he went to school with John. I intend to follow up with him to see if he enjoyed Fogerty's last CD.
B0097AX6EQ|5.0|Love or hate helicopters, love or hate Vietnam, this is a life story, and what a life story.  I really was not expecting the last chapter - I'll say no more!
B009AMANBA|5.0|I bought the CD to give as a gift to a dear friend that didn't see the movie. It was greatly appreciated. I saw the movie twice, now I have to buy the CD to add it to my collection of great movies.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Best Show on TV.  American TV needs to take stock and produce shows as good as this.  Can't wait for Season 4
B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|I downloaded this game for my kindle fire. I went on the game it says put in name.<br />I put in like 50 names it says failed try again don't get game.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|Choose Yourself might just choose you.  If you read the stories tied together with the common themes of self reliance and creativity, then you will see that author James Altucher is right.  There is no better way to reach your potential than by pursuing your desires, your ideas and your work.  If you work for another, then you are at your employer's mercy.  It might seem safe, but from this employment rights lawyer's experience, it most assuredly is not.  This book helped me to refocus and renew my love for self employment and creative effort.  Choose Yourself is easy to read and refreshingly clear.  If you feel trapped, confused by the job market or doubtful about you ability, then read this book.  You have to feel different after you read it.  You just have to.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|As interesting as it should be, unexpected twists and turns, very good writing. Keeps you interested and addicted. Can't wait for the next season
B00AZ3027I|5.0|a movie that I watched as a child and now my kids get to watch thanks to Amazon. time to look for more class
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I enjoyed this movie! lots of excitement! When's the next one! I watched this on my Kindle while staying the night as a Family Promise Host. It must of been a fun movie to make for the Actors!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Anything that can capture my attention like these birds and pigs and make time disappear is wonderful.  My hat is off to the Finnish gents who created this entertaining app.  Try it, you may regret it if your time is more valuable than &#34;getting those pigs&#34;!  Especially in a Star Wars environment.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|All ages are entertained by this story of a disgruntled and corrupt old codger who becomes endured to three children who do not let his behavior take their joy away. He grows in his acknowledgement of their excitement about the simple things in life and chooses to appreciate their childishness and how it makes him feel.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I absolutely love this game! So addictive and can also let out some frustration after a hectic day at work. Thanks for making this available!!!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I've read a number of Lee Child books and loved them all.  I always know I'm in for a well-written book that will keep my interest throughout. If you like this sort of book, his are a must.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I feel like I read a completely different book!!! I loved it!! Gideon and Eva become so solid in this book, there was a review that said they didn't want to hear about how Megumi was sick for three days but I think that ties into the next book. Sylvia has written these books in a way that she knows will be enticing!!  I honestly think everyone was expecting this to be the end and it wasn't, well I'M GLAD!!! I can't wait for them to continue!!
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I love British tv shows and this was was recommended by a friend.  I didn't start watching until season 3 was under way, so I had to start back with one and then catch up.  I think the cast is excellent - and it was very easy to get hooked into the story.
B0067TQQI8|5.0|I work as a production assistant and let me just say i cant count the number of times this little device has saved me and co workers of mine!! I use it all the time and never had any problems...the dual charge is one of the best features!! being able to charge two things at once! well lets jsut say things always come better in twos!! anyways...this is an excellent product and a great brand! im very pleased and again working on productions our mobile devices get used alot and having basically 4 extra charges can be a life or death situation in my line of work! Love it!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like it. You just need a lot of patience if you are waiting for the FREE lotteries. I buy the perks once in a while to speed things up.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I Love this show. I wish I had cable so I could watch Season 3 ASAP...<br /><br />I recommend this. !
038542471X|5.0|John Grisham always writesgreat books and this is no exception.  The book keeps you interested in finding out what happens to the bad guys, the lawyer and the client. Very enjoyable.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|fun waste of time. kept both me and my 7 year old busy. cant wait for more levels- hopefully soon!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read. I adore Charlie and my boyfriend, MIkey for telling me about this book. Loved this book so much.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I wanted something for my gym workouts but had the following requirements<br /><br />1. Had to go over head, tired of buds getting pulled out<br />2. Flexible, these things have taken a beating in my gym bag<br />3. Cheap Cheap Cheap!<br /><br />This bad boy made it 8 months through vigorous work outs, both weights and cardio, saunas, pool sides, traveling, you name it!  It just retired last week as one wore is loose, causing sound to go in and out.  For $7.00 - you better believe this will be a re-order!
B009ZQ8FQG|3.0|I'm sick to death of tragedy.  We started on a really high point and then just couldn't stay out of adding tragedy.  I do think that stories can be advanced without killing people off.
B005EHILV4|5.0|Needed an external sound card, and was considering getting a Behringer UCA202, but the 302USB was an extra $10-$15.  Glad I decided to pay the extra amount!  Compared to the UCA202, this has phantom power, multiple inputs, and options to balance audio.  And while I haven't tried it yet, supposedly it will operate as a standalone unit using a USB power source.  If you need an external sound card, or a micro mixer, this is your best bet!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|Simply outstanding, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen! Story was interesting all the way through and I mean all the way, no halfway point where everything gets boring and predictable. The visuals are beautiful, one of the best I've ever watched. The audio and video were top notch on my blu ray. I don't often keep movies I get or re-watch them but this instantly goes in my collection.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My wife and I both really enjoyed the first season watched on amazon prime and we are looking forward to continue watching the series.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|After years of curiosity from afar, with random clips and episodes here and there, I finally decided to fully dive into the world of new Who and start from the beginning. A great introduction for new fans.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|Imelda May has shown a great talent that has been crafted from years of work.  And it has all paid off with a skill that will be in the limelight for years to come.  Can't wait to hear more from her.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|(History)  Very well done & great history not to be forgotten - Right thumbs up. Good job to Mel Gibson & other actors.
B001HOF8AA|5.0|I have three cd's now and not one is bad in any sense of the word.  All the songs from all the cd's have been a pleasure to listen too over and over.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Use GEMS wisely!  They are the premium currency in the game, and if you don't want to pay $$$, don't use them unless necessary.  Don't use them to feed Spike at the beginning to speed up building, don't use them on non essential ponies, no matter how tempting Lyra Heartstrings being only 10 gems is!  Use them only for Rarity and Rainbow Dash.  Don't skip parasprites, or Pinky's pony friend(Derpy) in the cardboard box.  Remember that you can cash in old shops that you don't really need anymore and get bits(coins) back. This is a very addictive game, and sign up on the gameloft site and get as many 'friends' as possible, it's really easy to do, you get hearts and get more coins and gems that way too!  Also check out the wiki page for lots of tips and people who will want to friend you.
B003M8NG94|4.0|...This movie will doubtless soon become a cult classic.And I choose to type no more words in this review. Period.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Interesting regarding the justice system . A turning mystery and awesome ending.<br />My husband was born n Newton Ma and I found that to be bringing it home.
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|It looks pretty awesome and you can make some neat pictures, but did not find much use for it other than that. Younger children will probably really enjoy this.

0143036424|4.0|I like the TV series and like most books this goes into more detail which I find interesting.  Good reading.

B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Very nice ensemble, Great directing to bring all those big names together and give them screen time without making it becoming a hodgepodge!

B002BVOYBW|3.0|too somber of a flick for me...but johnny depp is fantastic as usual of course.<br />i had a hard time keeping my attention.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|The most intriguing and romantic novel I have ever read<br />And my mom also read out so that is also a benefit of that
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I love it!!!!  Such a  practical what to do and what not to do.  The help we have all been looking for.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love this show! My husband and I watch this together. I hope this show continues for many many seasons.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|There are plenty of reviews that say it all. This is a great book to read although it is a sad story. It might teach us to be grateful for every day of our live.
0891419063|5.0|The best WWII non-fiction I've ever read.  An awful picture of war: the noise, brutality, cruelty, sick sadism, filth, and stench.<br /><br />  No heros,  no teaching.  Just brilliant literary gloom.  In effect, a strong anti-war statement.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Great little game just like all the other cut the ropes. If you played any other one and liked it you'll like this one too.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|So very badly in need of an update....
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|slow, boring, etc etc just another one of those games like farmville super annoying, dont waste your time on this.
B005MLOOJA|4.0|I like the show and all the court cases that reflect current events.  The love triangle and family life adds to the drama.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|It's rather hard to be completely original these days.  This movie manages to deliver an original twist on a story told many times.  We were very please and surprised.
B00009Z574|3.0|Despite the revisionism that labels Tormato as \\"the worst Yes album,\\" it was actually a popular album, despite some negative reviews at the time. The album cracked the US Top Ten, and I and my friends enjoyed it. In retrospect, it appears to be a transitional album from the prog of Going For The One to the rock of Drama. The result is a scattershot approach that also has somewhat of an unfinished feel to all it. Jon Anderson attempts a more straightforward lyrical approach that teeters between amusing to appalling.<br /><br />Future Times/Rejoice is a promising start, somewhat of a continuation of Going For The One and sounding like Tormato could be another Yes classic. That mood is instantly dashed by Don't Kill The Whale, a stripped down rock song that really does cook. Madrigal is a nice respite - reminds me of the short pieces on Fragile. Another straight-up rock song, Release Release, wanders all over the place without really going anywhere, although it does rock. With a little bit more time and effort, it could have been a classic track.<br /><br />Side two (for you vinyl fans) wanders even further afield. Arriving UFO also has an unfinished feel. The songs ends with an explosion sound effect that might be the sound of an alien spaceship landing, or maybe the aliens came to conquer. Or maybe the band ran out of ideas and blew up the track. Circus of Heaven is just too cute to be on a Yes album. Another half-finished idea, Onward, follows. The album ends on a good note, with On The Silent Wings of Freedom, providing a good bookend with Future Times and leaving you wondering if all that was in between was really that ordinary.<br /><br />And they are not that ordinary, because this is Yes, and the interplay between the musicians is fantastic as always. It's just that this all needed about another month in the studio.<br /><br />Now about that cover. The well-told story about Rick Wakeman throwing a tomato at the artwork just doesn't ring true with me. I mean, really, he just happened to have a tomato handy at the time. To me, the cover represents what the punk movement thought of Yes and other 70s \\"dinosaur\\" bands that they rebelled against. In that way, it's a clever commentary, not some spoiled rock star's temper tantrum.<br /><br />There is nothing really so terrible about this album that it deserves one star. It does reward the listener at certain points, just not consistently. Just an average, barely inspired effort.ally, he just happened to have a tomato handy at the time.

B0072PUC7W|3.0|I first ordered this CD with an unwelcoming crack on the jewel case, so I immediately filed a claim for a replacement; and i-Deals immediately sent me a new one when I didn't even expect it; when I didn't even know they would send you a replacement unless you were required to return the original item to their replacement center. Unfortunately the replacement CD did have a crack as well, and I give up on ever replacing the CD again, as i-Deals packages fragile CDs into paper thin cardboard stock which is extremely susceptible to careless mailmen. Nevertheless I admire i-Deals greatly for their no-questions-asked replacement, and I actually grew a little fond over them, however I will not be a returning customer to their services, knowing the care put into shipment is rather questionable.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|My new favorite game for Android.  I'm an old school MTG player (started playing back in 1995) and I was thrilled to find this app for Android.  I play it on both my Kindle Fire HD and my Samsung Galaxy S3. Works great...lots of fun.  Only one bug I have found...in sealed deck play I have one deck which is stuck on opening a booster.  Not the end of the world.  Great adaptation of MTG!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely love this series.  From the first episode in season 1 I have been a huge fan of Downton!  More! More!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Never thought I would like this English Drama but it has really captured me. Every episode is great and makes you can't wait to see the next one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is areally awesome game ive played a lot of times you should try it 4 yourself 2<br />minecraft pocket editon is awsome
0385528752|5.0|Great book, great examples used. I purchase this book for all our new management staff. I would buy this again.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is awesome just forget about the updates and play the game! It's awesome and If you can't find lava try the seed nyan.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|I read this book when it was first published. I think I enjoyed more the second time around. The story and the people were great.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|It's pretty well written at some points just don't things I won't get used to but it's interesting, might add well read the last book.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|If you are a sci-fi or Star Trek fan, TNG season three is one to watch. After a break in period for season one, and then losing Dr Crusher (Gates McFadden) for season two, this is the season where this series gets on track. Dr Crusher is back and better than ever, the characters have been developed and the writers deliver consistently. Thumbs up.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I like that when you gain a level you get gem I just wish you didn't have to wait so long for things I'm 11 and I love this game
B000AOEMXM|5.0|great to get the product. can't wait to see it. no problem in receiving the set of whole series. bye
B005CMSDLE|5.0|non stop action ,i mean from start to finish . chemical brothers nail the sound track . this movie does have a pretty high body count . your gonna love it ..
B005LAII44|5.0|I have never been a G.I Joe fan...at all, so when this sequel came out, I was like, \\"Oh well, I guess that it was time.\\"  After watching it one afternoon, I wound up really liking it.  I really did!  It was action packed and suprised me by killing off Channing Tatum's character so early in the movie.  I was like, \\"REALLY?\\"  After I got pass the inital shock of that move, the movie moved on, with Bruce Willis coming on, and it just flowed for me.  It had enough action to keep my interest, and the ending gave away, for me, that there will be a 3 coming to a theater near you.  After seeing this one, it seems a sure bet that I will invest in the next chapter of these character's lives.
B00003CWOL|5.0|i really liked this movie . jay and silent bob are just hilarious . i watched this with my catholic girlfriend she said &#34;it's really thinkie&#34; ? i don't understand what she says half the time anyway . this movie is great .
B001NA6096|5.0|This intelligent, artful, mindful movie is a very insightful trip to serendipity. The story is filled with real thoughtful conversations about love, relationships, death and life itself all portrayed in a beautiful Vienna. The only thing is that they only have one night to discover each other.  It is a great movie!
B00CWY76CC|1.0|I did not like this game at all to complex couldn't figure this game out didn't like this game at all.
B00009RDG9|5.0|As all of my purchases, my movie came in within a few days. The DVD arrived in great shape and for the price that I payed the disk was lightly worn.  It played without problem and it was an entertaining movie.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love Downton Abbey. I am glued to the show.  Does it seem that they are killing off all the sweet people? or is it just me?
140006922X|1.0|The scholarship is lacking and the viewpoint biased.  It is too bad this book is being pushed by the secular non-believing nattering nabobs....and, oh by the way, the author is an practicing Muslim, with and obvious agenda to discredit.  That should be part of the author's stated premise and any reviewer's presentation, as they laud a mediocre work because of their own non-belief/prejudices.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|I'm absolutely obsessed with this movie!  There are days when I run an Ever After marathon ALL day long.  My children love it, but they roll their eyes on the days when I watch nothing else.  Dougray and Drew definitely have chemistry, but I can't help but wish I was his paramour.  Oh my word Dougray absolutely is the perfect Prince Charming.  He steals my heart as does the entire movie.  I can honestly say this is my favorite movie of all time.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Who doesn't love TED talks? It is convenient and easy to find the talks I want to see. Get it!
B0044C5SCU|5.0|The Characters, in both universes, remain interesting and motivated by such a different perspective.<br />Nice to see the antagonist be yourself!  Conspiracy, misunderstandings, and planetary survival - all<br />wrapped up in an interesting storyline that keeps you moving from episode to episode.<br />Great job!
B001Q7JD3Q|2.0|Too many drawn out scenes with monster creatures eating guys. Best part of movie is relationship between king kong and his girlfriend.
B008EEZ64Y|4.0|This book is very different and quite strange but in a good way. It is a very good book about love courage and how great it is to live with hope and memories.
B006O5XYWG|4.0|I really liked this version of the movie.  Hope you watch it!! Cheer on the ape because he is more intelligent than some humans.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a great read for anyone who really derives great pleasure from their favorite movies, games, music, or books.  The author blatantly encourages geeking out while reading, and that made for all sorts of fun.  I've read a few books that have deftly created an environment so immersive I just did not want the book to end, and this is one of them!
B0060D15AK|5.0|Love this movie :-) there should be other ones like this. The actor. & actress were so great in the movie. It could be like real life...
B00D5YNQMW|3.0|The other reviews pretty much sum it up.<br />On buying this it has no mention on the sleeve of a tour documentary.<br />To be fair it is more of a concert film and some of the interviews inbetween tracks are annoying.<br />Another thing is the first half of Hangman Jury is cut.<br />Also where the hell are tracks like Jaded and Dream On???<br />The whole thing runs at 1 hour 34 mins.<br /><br />On the plus side the picture and audio are exceptional.<br />It is on a par with Led Zeppelin's Celebration Day and the live feel is fantastic.<br />It makes you really wish for a full on uncut, no interviews, live show release.<br />Considering they spent all that money filming in HD and recording each show then releasing this<br />it makes you wonder the decisions made by management/record company.<br />Saying this I'd still recommend it.<br /><br />NOTE - I have e-mailed [...] requesting they release an uncut & no interviews between songs full show.<br />If we all e-mail them maybe they'll get the hint!!!!
B002KYHZLQ|2.0|This was really just too much work for me to get through this series, 9 months in fact(books never take this long for me).  The series as others have stated \\"the book you love to hate\\".  First off, this is not a Kindle friendly book, you really need to have a hard copy to flip back and forth to keep up with the characters (see George Martin) and the Kindle isn't really good for that, there are just sooooo many.  I just wanted to be done with it!  Not to say this was a bad series, it just was extremely hard to get into the books, generally started out with no clue who peeps were, trying to recall the story/characters from the previous book (You are basically reading 2 different series in one with differnt stories and characters every other book)so it's difficult to keep up.<br /><br />Steve is a very wonderful complex writer, but there were times I would skip whole pages in the book because he would go off on a tangent when all I wanted to do was ready the story.  Generally these tangents were italicized, and made it easy to recogonize the skip parts as they were often not relevent. Characters were great, but there lacked closure with a lot by the end of the series, I kept asking a lady I work with who read it at the same time \\"what happened to so and so\\" and \\"where did so and so go\\"  a lot of loose ends left untied.<br /><br />I'm am just exhausted after reading this series and am almost considering taking a break from reading for a few weeks ( I'm just burnt out).  In conclusion, there are a lot of great things about this series, and if you don't have much going on for the say next 9 months, give it a go.  It's a challenging read with a lot of awesome characters (Karsa, Toc and Fidler)but god I'm glad I'm done with it.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|While I did order this product and am happy to do so, I am disappointed the marketing materials make it appear as though the dongle is powered through the HDMI connection.  It is not.  The dongle needs to be plugged in any time you're using it.  The pictures they released do not show this at all.<br />That being said, if the product works as indicated it should be a fantastic product with an amazing price point.  Apple TV is around $100 and their apps are nothing special right now.
B005HED11Y|4.0|the quality of the remastered episodes are great - i recall seeing them on a black and white T.V.<br />it amazing how much we have duplicated the ideas of that show into what we use and see every day
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I ordered Entwined with You in October 2012, then had to wait until June 2013 for the Kindle release.  The storyline has gotten a bit better due some possible twists that Sylvia may add, but I am tired of waiting for the next book.  Sylvia has a new release, but no mention on the Penguin site about the book after the Bared to You series.  If I had not read the first three books, I would have waited until ALL the books were released before I started the first.  I just don't like the suspence of waiting for the next book.  It's a done deal sale... why hold out?

B00DRPVE3M|2.0|Skipped frames when switching players and took several taps to pick up or select a card. Froze often too. I wouldn't waste space for this app.
B008OOYALE|1.0|I hate this game! you should not get it if you own a kindle.it crashes and it does not work
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Not a difficult challenge for let's say twelve and up. Adds are at the bottom, music can be turned off and it's free. Need more rooms now please.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I really got a strong sense of the reality of the Afghan women's strength in the face of incredibly oppressive, difficult lives.  The characters are so human--frail and tough at the same time..
B0067Q42BY|5.0|fun and challenging this game has it all. the rewarding part is you receive reinforcement of your work by obtaining the artifacts for each puzzle completion. you also receive rewards if you finish fast or thoroughly etc.  I recommend it.  have fun!

B0083GOVLW|5.0|We loved every minute of this film. It was historical, insightful, thought-provoking, and humorous. As well, the animation was creative and mesmerizing. All in all a nicely done film well worth watching. After watching the film, do some research on Persepolis at [...] -- very interesting stuff.<br /><br />Also, check out [...]

B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a good game but tnt needs to go kaboom and also needs to let us craft because it's called mine CRAFT so it needs us to CRAFT stuff or else it's just called mine. It also needs armor so FREAKIN UPDATE THE GAME SO THAT WE CAN CRAFT AND HAVE ARMOR and please update soon
B00CA4S3QW|5.0|This vinyl reissue is a stellar job. I wanted to give something very special to my wife, who was such a Zappa freak in the 60s that she could sing along with every song from this album, and since she has perfect pitch that was something to hear! I couldn't imagine the original could be so much better. Thank goodness we had inherited a collection of 2000 vinyl albums, so had invested in a turntable and a couple of excellent vintage speakers. Wow! The music just leaped out at us! Thanks to the Zappa family for having this done (and at a reasonable price). I hope they'll consider doing the same with other albums in the catalog.

B008XG1X18|5.0|I like to use it often so having an app for Pinterest is just so handy.  Learning how to manage my aps.<br />About time.
B00CE379IM|2.0|Not good. I watched it, because I paid for it. The whole story just felt like someone shook up a box of cliches and then spoon fed the rather predictable story to you. Also the male lead was painful to listen to; I kept thinking that they were going to uncover that he had some sort of learning disability.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|im am not prude.  in fact, the only reason picked this up was for the juicy content.  but man, does this book stink.  the writing is poor, the plot line weak and the characters are so one dimensional and boring that i could find similar shallow material on Skinemax... and much more tittilating.  just a terrible series - and not at all \\"addicting\\".  I was counting the pages before i could be done with this terrible read.  ugh - i want my 5 hours back!
B00CL50KDY|5.0|Fun, lighthearted take on a dark subject. I was particularly impressed with how little I had to work to suspend my disbelief. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Worth checking out!
B00821OX98|5.0|Love this show. Well written and Noah Wiley is great. Highly recommend it. The alien/apocalypse plot made me skip this series until a friend talked me into trying it. Now I'm totally hooked.
B007EECSFA|3.0|The book is long and the writing uneven.  Some sections hold one's interest and some don't.  At some point one has to ask, &#34;Do I really care?&#34;
B00DFFI7K2|1.0|To put this mildly; This was a master piece of crap. the action was so-so and the action was much less. The plot was so subtle, I think they forgot to put it in. Towards end the you can clearly see where Cobra commander has just finished watching Superman 3 and said \\"That's how i will take over the world!\\" I would say wait for HBO, but I think it will hit Netflix first.
B008HK3XOU|1.0|Haven't seen it yet because it hasn't arrived. Will write more when I have a chance to examine the case.
140006922X|1.0|This book is written by a muslim who is hell bent on destroying the legacy of jesus in favor of his beliefs about muhammad and makes up a bunch of crap and claims to be a historian which he is not.  Imagine if a christian wrote a book about muhammad having sexual relations with his 10 year old bride (which he did).... but if a christian wrote a book called zealot about muhammad it would be a big deal and that perdon would be acosted.  If you are christian and read this book you should be ashamed.
B003EYVXYQ|2.0|...and overall, just a really bad zombie movie.  Breaks my heart to give it 2 stars, especially being a Romero Superfan, but here's not enough good in this movie to even rate it mediocre.  While it's better than any of the Return of the Living Dead's sequels, you really don't give a damn about any of the protagonists in the story, and the story itself stumbles along like one of the undead.  And given Romero's made it a point to show that zombies are clumsy and slow in the rest of his body of work, suddenly here, one magically possesses the dexterity to ride a horse which makes me wonder if George even realizes just how difficult it is to ride one.  The digital effects are substandard compared to past films as well.  It's really a shame when we see Romero done better in films like Shaun of the Dead and The Walking Dead.  Here's hoping his next entry is stronger.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Not historically accurate but emotionally correct.  And that is more important.  Lots of fun with good looking people and sets.  A wonderful costume drama.
B0047S1KMS|1.0|The &#34;Dead Set NTSC All Region DVD&#34; is not what the item description claims.  It's a single episode, not the whole series as the description claims.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|Loved this book! Filled with many twists and turns that make it unexpected and enthralling! Couldn't put it down - will definitely read other Kate Morton books.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|This is an excellent collection of songs being performed by an exceptional artists. The clarity of Susan Boyle's voice is excellent and with each new recording, in my mind, she just gets better.
B00B5HQKNI|1.0|and not in a good way.  What a bad movie!  Stupid, boring, humorless. Of course, Judy Dench is a wonderful actress, but no idea why she decided to be in this dreck.
B00DGN51O8|2.0|This is a lame movie with horrible acting.  Don't waste your time or money with it.<br /><br />Bad take on an old favorite.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|I only watched this because the sequel is coming out and I'd never heard of the first movie.  Glad I didn't pay to see it in the theater, but it was a lot of fun for a rental.  If you're looking for over-the-top action with humor, this is the movie for you.  Great cast, as well.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love good music and this CD is excellent. If you like to relax to good music order this or gift it.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|Uneven movie. Some good and some Meh. Cheeky at times FWIW. Great cinema photography. Monkey is odd as is doll. A little like Alice in wonderland. The play Wicked is better!

B0089LOG02|4.0|I read constantly; and my obsession has only gotten worse since I bought the first Kindle.<br />But I did not buy this book, I got it from the Library.  With a Kindle books no longer stack up, but the cost does.<br />The book I read previously was also from the Library \\"Joyland\\" by Stephen King.<br />Oddly enough, Joyland was written with incredible, laugh out loud humor.<br /><br />So, I was not prepared for this book, which is quite solemn.  But then, what would you expect from a book called \\"Orphan Train\\"<br /><br />After the first ten pages I was struck that this Irish immigrant family came to New York and went to live on \\"Elizabeth Street.\\"<br />This struck me like a hammer because there was another book about immigrants, Italian immigrants, and they came to live on \\"Elizabeth Street.\\"  The book was free with Amazon Prime Membership, and it was pretty good.  So it simply shocked me...did everyone go directly from Ellis Island to Elizabeth Street ?<br /><br />If you care at all about America, then and now (the book begins in 1929) you will get something from this book.<br />It is solemn, as I mentioned, but it is well written and it is a window to a world we sometimes imagine, but never know.<br /><br />The other thing I noticed is that for a Nine Year Old Niamh has the insight and vocabulary of an adult.
B00DFFI7K2|5.0|well bruce willis was really good in this movie and the rock was good in it .I have to say I can't wait to see the next one the make or I hope the do .

B0094M4OW0|5.0|For me, there's nothing not to love about Bad Boys. It's non-stop action from start to finish, and Martin Lawrence and Will Smith are at the top of their game.<br /><br />Its sequel, Bad Boys II, for that matter, is no less thrilling, albeit a bit more predictably scripted. I own both movies and watch them on Amazon Prime Video from time to time.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|The story is harrowing and challenging. It is also profoundly complex and deep. The twists and turns and uncertainty of life in almost unbearable circumstances kept me turning the pages.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have to admit, when I first began reading Hopeless, I wasn't sure it was going to be my \\"thing.\\" Boy was I wrong.  Sky was endearing and relatable and Holder was funny yet so mysterious and sweet all at the same time.  The many surprises along the way felt real and not forced.  I especially loved how Hoover wrote about so many embarrassing, real moments that occur in every teens life (the text message faux pas had me laughing out loud).<br />One thing (among the many) I particularly loved was how she was able to write about teens but made it an adult book. These teen characters are faced with very adult issues and Hoover tackles them masterfully.
B0053Q9DHW|3.0|I had very high hopes for this film, despite thinking it was too soon for another adaptation. I mean, the 2006 BBC miniseries was released less than five years before this one! As much as I love Jane Eyre, I do think think there's such a thing as adaptation overload. I can't help but feel that they could have adapted another work instead.<br />Overall, my view on the film is that it is a disappointment. It could have been great but it did not meet my expectations. One of my main problems was the structure. The film starts out with Jane fleeing Thornfield and being found by the Rivers. Any scenes from before that point are flashbacks, occasionally coming back to a scene in the \\"present\\" at Moor House. I remember reading about this choice before the film came out and being hesitant, but I thought it might come out better than I expected. Unfortunately, it did not. The flashback structure was confusing for my friends who did not read the book. To me, it was just an annoyance. I get that they were trying to do something different, but it just didn't work for me in practice.<br />I think that the film could have benefited from about 10-20 extra minutes of run-time. A lot of the explanations and backstories are cut out. What really bothered me about this is that it looked like more things were actually originally filmed, but left on the cutting room floor. The DVD confirmed my suspicions on some of this- plenty of deleted scenes on it should have been left in the film, IMO! I do not know why some of them were cut. Because I saw the film with several people who did not read the book, I know that a lot of it was confusing. And for me, even though I knew the backstory, I was just irritated not to see it! One major thing I felt they should have done with extra time would be to show more buildup to Jane and Rochester's relationship. Some of their scenes together are great, but they needed more of these before they actually got engaged to show and explain their growing attraction more.<br />As to the actors, I found much of the acting to be understated. In some cases I liked this approach more than in others. Mia Wasikowska is not plain, but I thought they made her look the part well enough in terms of age and stature. I found her acting, however, to be underwhelming. I thought her performance was too restrained. In the proposal scene, in particular, I thought she held back too much. I don't want Jane to be over the top, but I wanted a little more passion. A lot of focus in this version seemed to be put on Jane wanting freedom and developing into a woman, but I could have done without the scene of her examining the painting of a naked lady. Not that I had any issues with the picture, but the scene accomplished nothing (that time could have been better spent elsewhere) and this \\"nude image\\" was part of the reason the film got a PG-13 rating. While Michael Fassbender was also a bit more restrained than some other actors (especially compared to Timothy Dalton, my favorite), I liked his performance more than Mia's. The two did have good chemistry, but there just weren't enough scenes to show them falling in love. Bertha, I felt to have not enough of a presence. Grace Poole was really just in the background and so there was never any of Jane suspecting her. Bertha herself was not as menacing as she could have been. I suppose they did not want to be offensive but she just wasn't scary enough. The Rivers siblings were all good in their roles, but I was not a fan of the change made to their relationship with Jane.<br />I don't want to make it seem like I completely hated this film, because I didn't. I thought that the scenes of Jane's childhood were particularly well-done, especially given the short time-frame. Many individual scenes were great. On the whole, I just found it to be slightly lacking. I want a director's cut!on more.<br />As to the actors, I found much of the acting to be understated.

B00BEEKN26|5.0|Never thought tv crime drama could be such riveting storytelling. The depth of characters is unbelievable even after the first one or two episodes. Beyond this, the absolutely haunting music of the Icelandic Olafur Arnalds contributes to the telling of the story through all eight episodes. Apparently, the musical score was recorded in an empty church in Reykjavik by a string quartet no doubt adding an extra quality of authentic yet eerie music. Just when you thought story, location and music were essential ingredients contributing to the success of this highly addictive series, the key protagonists/actors ( David Tennant and Olivia Colman) contribute a big wallop leaving an everlasting aftertaste even after the last credit \\"Broadchurch will return.\\"

It's a nice change from kids fantasy, and is closer in its adult tone to the old Conan the Barbarian movies than something like Lord of the Rings.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Reza Aslan was born into a family of moderate Muslims who emigrated from Iran in the wake of the Islamic revolution. He converted to Christianity at age fifteen. This book, Zealot: The Life and Times of Jesus of Nazareth is the result of twenty years of scholarship.<br />In Zealot, Aslan seeks to discover the \\"historical Jesus,\\" the man himself, leader of a social and religious movement and martyred revolutionary. Unfortunately, hard facts about Jesus are hard to come by, and, according to Aslan, much of what is written in the gospels was fabricated to suit the purposes of the writer.<br />What is known about Jesus, the historical person? Very little. He was most likely born in Nazareth. Aslan shows the story that he was born in Bethlehem due to Joseph's summons to answer a Roman census to be a fiction. The Romans didn't do their censuses that way. He probably had a number of brothers and sisters. Was he married? Nothing is known about a wife, but young Jewish men were not encouraged to remain single. It is likely that he met and was baptized by John the Baptist. It is likely that, after the death of John the Baptist, Jesus sought to continue his work and went about Galilee preaching, making followers and performing miracles. Aslan does not bring these miracles into question. It is likely that Jesus detested the wealthy priest class in Jerusalem and wanted to destroy it. He appears to have favored the notion of redistribution of wealth in favor of the poor. He was, in effect, a revolutionary.  After several years of itinerant preaching, Jesus took his followers to Jerusalem and confronted the wealthy priests of the temple by overturning the tables of the moneychangers and releasing the sacrificial animals. It seems a bold and foolhardy thing to do. In those days lots of people were executed for far less.<br />It is clear that Jesus was born into a society that was in complete chaos. Roman rule was a disaster for Judea and there was a vicious cycle of rebellion on the part of Judeans and oppression on the part of the Romans. Aslan seeks to put Jesus and his movement into this context.<br />Of great interest is the struggle, after the crucifixion of their leader, between Jesus's brother James and Paul of Tarsus. After Jesus's death his twelve apostles continued his work under the leadership of Jesus's brother James, known as James the Just. According to Aslan: \\"The movement's principal leaders-the apostles Peter and John, and Jesus's brother James-maintained their fealty to Jewish customs and Mosaic law to the end. Under their leadership, the Jerusalem church became known as the `mother assembly.' No matter how far and wide the movement spread, no matter how many other `assemblies' were established, no matter how many new converts-Jew or gentile-the movement attracted, every assembly, every convert, and every missionary would fall under the authority of the `mother assembly' in Jerusalem until the day it was burned to the ground.\\"<br />After the destruction of Jerusalem, however, it was Paul who prevailed. By the time the gospels were written, the Christian leadership was in the hands of a Hellenized Jewish elite who sought to make converts among Greek and Roman gentiles. They willingly abandoned the strictures of Judaism and largely adopted the rather deviant beliefs of Paul. In the end it is Paul whose teachings become the heart and soul of Christianity. According to Aslan: \\"Paul's portrayal of Jesus as Christ may sound familiar to contemporary Christians-it has since become the standard doctrine of the church-but it would have been downright bizarre to Jesus's Jewish followers. The transformation of the Nazarean into a divine, preexistent, literal son of God whose death and resurrection launch a new genus of eternal beings responsible for judging the world has no basis in any writings about Jesus that are even remotely contemporary with Paul's.<br />Zealot is a fascinating book both for Christians desiring to know more aboutthe origin of their religion and for non-believers who have an interest in history.the origin of their religion and for non-believers who have an interest in history.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|It was pretty good.  A little overboard at times, and it was definitely cheesy but overall I would watch it again.
B00CXQL828|4.0|The Winery Dogs, is great listening from beginning to end. While there are some slower numbers on here or mid-tempo, they keep it interesting. When you go into this after reading what the band has been describing the project as, may be a little different. I guess I was expecting some more balls out rockers in the more classic rock vein, which seem what a lot of artists are trying to re-capture, and to be honest, most don't succeed. With that said, these guys are rocking, on even the slower numbers.<br />While every song captures great elements of each of the players as an artist, to other players, should find this a great listen. Honestly, even if you don't play an instrument, it's not hard to tell that these guys are great and gelling together very well.<br />While I completely enjoy listening to this, I find only one song that totally sticks to my mind, when I walk away from it, and that is track 4, I'm No Angel, which is a slower number. Track 11, Time Machine almost comes off as a Alice In Chains tune when it starts. Great album, and great work. More mid-tempo and slower tunes than faster. I will be totally interested to see what these guys offer up in a live performance.<br />When I first heard of this project on TMS, they were talking about having John Sykes onboard and I was stoked. Needles to say, I am very happy they continued on with Richie Kotzen, as I have been a fan of his work since Fever Dream. Also, to me, His work on Poison's Native Tongue, make it one of Poison's best efforts, but it failed miserably in many other's reviews. All's I can say is,  watch the Live Poison concert with Kotzen onboard. Plus, Kotzen and Sheehan have put work in together on Mr. Big earlier on. Kotzen has been around for quite some time, but never broke in the USA for some reason, maybe this will put him in the spotlight more here.

B00BC24NT4|2.0|This is an oversimplified story that tries to make the point that American money can corrupt just about anything, and that U.K. government officials are readily willing to be bought for present and future promises of wealth. The message is timely, but the story doesn't justify all the hype that tries to explain how Le Carré is an insider to U.S. and U.K intelligence operations. This story might have been dreamt up by anybody, and certainly didn't require an insider to fashion it. The secondary message is that innocent life can be lost in the conduct of futile and needless government &#34;ops.&#34; In today's world &#34;collateral damage&#34; is considered acceptable risk, and is hardly anything most of us didn't know.
B005ELZKWS|3.0|I only wish Joe Satriani would unleash all his talent on this album as he does on his solo efforts . This is an Ok album but a little too \\"Comercial\\", maybe that was the idea. Michael Anthony does a great job here. The CD came with 3D glasses and some great pics of the band; that was very cool of them. Hoping next Chickenfoot will be a lot more heavy.
B00AW8UK0K|5.0|Tried a few &#34;Eating Plans&#34; in my life and this one was the least troublesome. Lost 21.56 Lb's in 24 weeks.<br /><br />Explains the science and makes sense to one who does not just accept claims put out there.
B009DJB9HC|3.0|I have the two previous recordings of this super-band and I enjoyed them a lot .. This third effort , not so much. The music is great, and  well executed , but at one point you wish Glenn Hughes would Shut Up!  If only Joe Bonamassa  would sing more songs it would be awesome. But it is not the case here. I bet I'm not the only one with the same opinion. Other than that, great hard rock album 'nuff said.
B00C1LIYWM|5.0|The movie is so sweet, just what I look for in a good movie.  The little girl is so precious and the two leading actors make for a great &#34;chick flick&#34;.  Loved it.!
B0072X2O66|3.0|Don't expect symphony X or Dream Theater here.  This is more heavy metal than anything else. The album is OK I'm glad I bought it. But some of the songs seem a little bit boring ( in a good way ) I mean, nothing new, nothing I haven't heard before on other bands. It is a good allbum to listen to, but this guys have raised the bar so high.. That I expected something that would blow my mind. -and it didn't -.
B009YQJ322|5.0|The movie shipped incredibly quickly, the DVD not only in great condition, but the content was well worth the money. Thank you for your prompt service and offering the great movie!
B0091REZMW|1.0|Okay so I used to love this game. Then I updated it and it gave me a little note. It said we are warning you now next time you play this you will get a virus.....please fix this.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|its a very simple easy to use calculator...you dont always have one on hand so its nice to have this just in case
B009X01C64|4.0|I looked long and hard for the best case for my Kindle Fire HD 8.9 and this case seemed to have the best features from what is currently available on the market. I use my Kindle Fire for many reasons, and being able to rotate the unit for both horizontal and vertical viewing while still in the case was very important for me.<br /><br />As I really do enjoy this case over the others out there, I am only giving this case 4 out of 5 stars because of the angle that the horizontal view gives when in the case. I wish the angle was not as steep as it is. When sitting in a chair with a recliner, it makes you have to bend your neck to far down in order to see the screen comfortably. If they could give just a bit more of an angle, it would be worthy of all 5 stars.<br /><br />So only good, but not great! Hope this helps to those of you that are looking for the perfect case too, this is as close as you are going to get and I still suggest it over the others out there. Cheers!
B001QOGYBI|5.0|Just as fun for the adults as it is for the kids.  Very clever dialogue and filming.  Glad we bought. fast shipping
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I have read the books and found the series to be better, and I don't say that often. The cast is amazing, and its a little different than the book, which makes the show more entertaining to those who have read the books.  Can't wait to get through the next season!<br /><br />Oh, and the quality is great.  sometimes stops here and there to buffer, but that might me my internet connection- next time, will download and watch.
B00005A1PR|3.0|I love India Arie and I will continue to purchase her CD's! Can't wait to buy all of her CD's.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|The movie is great, but be aware that the quality of the video isn't all that great.  I purchased the blu ray and it came with a free digital copy, however that copy was not of the same quality.  It has a great deal of artifacting/pixellation.  I was disappointed that I wasn't entitled to the HD version of a movie, since I did purchase the HD copy of physical media.  It seems wrong that there is an HD version that would cost me an additional ~$12 to purchase.  Otherwise everything else is great about the movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|High score is 114,500.  Not mine of course but it is a great app.  The graphics are super and no glitches at all.  Plays without a hitch!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Its a great shows.  It is smart, funny and sexy all at the same time.  Give it a watch you will not be disappointed.
B009B4ZEKM|5.0|Ms. Christina Aguilera perfectly written and perfectly sung an amazing CD titled Lotus.  Lotus is one of my most favorite CDs!
B005544TRQ|5.0|I had heard so much about this show but never had the time nor the means to watch it.  I found out that Amazon prime actually offers Suits in HD for free (with a prime account) and couldn't be happier!<br /><br />Now I'm 2 seasons in and have to give this show credit for its watchability, character development, intense storyline, contemporary and gripping dialogue (which is impressive for a show based on law).  It's a must watch, if you enjoy thinking while watching tv, you won't be disappointed.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great graphics for a card game. Gameplay is very intuitive especially if if you've ever played Magog the gathering. Can't get enough of this game. Sealed play feature is extremely fun to and useful to test your deck making abilities on the fly
B0094KT8W8|3.0|phenomenal visuals, acting was not the greatest in the world, storyline not too shabby, I just couldn't get into the whole thing
B00COGY2P2|5.0|Great action sequences with a constructive story-line.  A little over the top (but not too extreme,), at times that adds to punch to the movie.  Wouldn't recommend for my preteen grandkids.  Watched this twice during the 48hr rental.  Well worth the $$ as an action flick.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Only thermal paste I like to use.  Have used this brand for many years on many different computer builds.  Always happy with the results.
B0083Z614S|4.0|This is a classic. I had to read it for a Summer Task list for school but found myself really enjoying it.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This album reminds me of the early days of Black Sabbath.  This album will be at home on the shelf right next to the first four Sabbath albums.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|From the very first time I read this book - several years ago - I fell in love with the characters and the writing.<br />Since that first read, I read it about once a year (ok, sometimes twice a year).  I laugh and cry along with the lead character, Emma. I highly recommend this book to all my friends who are looking for a great, funny, heart-warming book to get lost in for a little while.  :)
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Great movie! Even better book series. I cannot wait for the next movie to come out this fall. A must watch !
B004ZY0VHY|4.0|Though I did enjoy the read and found it interesting and sometimes fascinating, I also had trouble understanding how this child never got any help given the extent and depth of his psychosis. I understand parents can very often stick their heads in the sand, but this child went to school and had &#34;relationships&#34; outside of the home. I would have given the book a &#34;5&#34; but had trouble believing this could actually happen the way it was written.
B000PC0SPU|3.0|Informative, but basic information about thinking with both sides of the brain. Or maybe with one side depending on your thought and circumstance.
B0096DZKZC|3.0|Classic sonic game play with nice new graphics. Level design is not as good as old sonic games like 1&2 but still fun and best graphics yet on a sonic game
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is one of those games that parents and children a like can enjoy! The graphics are wonderful and the story line is fun! I strongly recommend this game!!
B006S01GH2|5.0|I really enjoyed this piece. Great acting, loved the story line, and the ending. I can give a better review but would take too much of ur time....just watch it.
067144901X|5.0|Super cute book.  We purchased it for a friend's baby on the way.  They loved it and I know the new baby will too.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|First off i thought the film was fantastic! Sure it summarizes the first few episodes of the anime, but everything looks so much more pretty. The extra features are nice but nothing special unless you really like to look at early artist concepts. The case is really good looking as well and i'm super afraid to get it dirty. All in all a great purchase!
B004Q8LDL2|5.0|This movie has the tried and true Michael Bay formula: explosions, gun fights, repeat for approximately 1.5 hours. It's actually aged pretty well for a mid-90's action flick. The Nicholas Cage/Sean Connery combo makes for a quotable and enjoyable film.
0071752854|5.0|I received this book as a gift from a friend. And, it came at an ironic time in my life. I had just had my power stripped from me in a conversation with the president of a company I was leaving. He was using what Oren called the Analyst Frame in this book. I was telling him I was dissatisfied with the company's level of organization and customer service overall and was done working with them. And, he came with the analyst frame of being \\"completely unfazed, arrogant, and acting puzzled\\" as to how I could have come to my conclusions that the company with my limited knowledge (Klaff, p.44, 2011). I immediately took a stance of fearfully defending myself, but there was no end to his tactics. He even appealed to my ego by saying, \\"Quitting is a sign of weakness.\\" At least I had one thing to my credit, I was settled in my decision and could not be persuaded to stay although I played his game for a while to a loss of dignity and respect.<br /><br />I've had various sales positions since 2002 and have been moderately successful in them because I did not understand the game Oren outlines in Pitch Anything. Now, that I understand Oren's STRONG method, I can actually have fun sitting down with any type of prospect knowing that if we do not seal the deal I will never leave another sales call feeling defeated. This book will remain on my routine reading schedule. He goes deep into human psychology and the basic decisions that we ignore when making sales presentations and how they cost us the sale. He then goes in depth on how to use his STRONG method to keep your power and close more deals favorably.<br /><br />*If you have had prospects that zone out during your presentations...<br />*If you have had prospects that cut you short or put you under unreasonable time restraints...<br />*If you have had prospects that come to presentations without the main decision makers...<br /><br />...and you floundered and lost the deal because of their power plays, you need to read this book so you understand exactly what happened and what to do to turn these situations around to your favor. I was so amazed and delighted by the content of this book (because it is completely original to my knowledge) that I put it down after a few hours of reading and bought the audio book to play in my car between appointments. What Oren teaches you how to maintain the winners edge in any situation, and he's an entertaining writer at that.so you understand exactly what happened and what to do to turn these situations around to your favor.

B0052UZIFA|1.0|The app in the amazon app store is like 3 updates behind the play store version. One of the update is also really big! Don't waste any money at this place!!
B008M87GJK|5.0|Great customizability, works fantastic on kindle and provides all the most important headlines. I would definitely recommend picking this one up. Also, it's at a price you can't beat!
B00ACP3OOM|1.0|The reader is not fully compatible with iTunes. When you make the conversion process of the songs purchased from the iTunes from the AAC format to MPEG (as per the instruction manual), this latter audio format is not fully recognized by the reader and it is not possible to identify the song on the display within the \\"artist\\" selection.<br />For now, only one star.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Recent upgrade has ruined this app for me. Went from simple to counterintuitive overnight. I uninstalled and changed to a different weather app.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Love this movie! Great movie, great acting, great characters, awesome story. Excellent tale of the pre- Dorothy land of Oz.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The graphics are delicious, the puzzles range from easy to complicated...this is a unique game when it comes to artistry, challenges and the serenity of working toward solutions....put your brain cells to good use and enjoy the eye candy. Be patient and  you will not be disappointed.
B004SUWR2C|1.0|So stupid! Total waste of time just dumb and foolish app not worth the time and effort I used to download it.
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|This series may not appeal to hard core SciFi fans, but for someone who likes the exploration of imaginative possibilities, this was great stuff.  It helps to have an extraordinary actress convince us of times 12 cloning and all the permutations of personality without falling prey to cliché.
B0060Q962Q|1.0|So stupid! Total waste of time just dumb and foolish app not worth the time and effort I used to download it.

B00AFQC4QC|4.0|I was given a copy of this ebook in return for a review.<br /><br />It took me a little while to get into the book as I was told and not shown quite a few bits of information in the first few chapters but I kept reading and soon got drawn into the characters and their lives.<br /><br />The history in this novel was very rich and as it's an area I studied it complemented what I already knew perfectly and I really felt like I could have been there and a part of it all. The suspense at several key points was masterfully done and I found myself holding my breath, tensing up and being unable to stop reading until I knew everyone was safe.<br /><br />The pace wasn't quite as fast as I'd have liked but I think that was because so many years of history were being spanned in one book and so many characters and their interactions with each other. It's often the way with historical novels so historical lovers shouldn't find that a problem at all.<br /><br />All in all a really good book.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|Great game loved playing it while I could. Game has crashed about a month ago and the creator &#34;Gameloft&#34; says they are trying to fix it but it's taking awhile. Hope they get it figured out would love to play it again.
B00DM0XXCM|2.0|If you can get past the idea of a magical-gravity that only matter from each particular planet can gravitate towards it, but has no affect on matter from anywhere else, then this starts off as a fun movie.<br /><br />I won't spoil the ending, but if you follow the storyline about what gravitates towards what planets, etc - it makes you feel like they had no better idea of how to end the story, so they just picked an idea out of a hat.<br /><br />If you rent the movie, I would suggest watching the first 45-minutes then turn it off and use your own imagination to make up your own ending.
B00933JL0A|1.0|So stupid! Total waste of time just dumb and foolish app not worth the time and effort I used to download it.
0062255657|5.0|I just finished Neil Gaiman's new book, The Ocean at the End of the Lane. I'm blown away. I never thought I'd again read a story that makes the utterly terrifying and fantastic seem commonplace while at the same time preserving the transcendent and beautiful mystery that is the human heart. Gaiman is a genius at the top of his game. I highly recommend this book to anyone from age 12 to 100 who enjoys a good read.
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|Superb performances by these magnificent actors, in fact the entire cast... David Lean's epic vision with Jack Hildyard's cinematography brilliantly depict  humanity striving to overcome the self inflicted absurdities of war.
0679805273|5.0|I love all the Dr. Seuss books. I sent this to my grandson who liked it okay. He just graduated and I sent it as a present. He liked the money better.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|This show is by far one of the most interesting one I have seen. It has everything a tv show needs to be rank as high.<br />Things like adventure, action, suspends, love, drama, blood, sex etc. I can't wait for more seasons to come.
B000IEXVCC|4.0|Not for everyone, but modern noir classic with lots of twists.  The monster bum played by a woman is awesome.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|Great show for the family.  Has abit of everything.  Aliens, super powers, action, love story...check it out.  Two thumbs up.
B003THHIEM|5.0|I seriously love this show.  It's really fun to watch; great dialogue, great chemistry between characters, great story lines.  I like to tell people it's like watching a more fun and less creepy L&O.
B0082Z447U|5.0|I have to admit that this was recommended to me by a friend and fellow Kindle User.  The price itself was perfect...so it was a good reason to try the book.  I don't regret if for a moment.<br /><br />This richly textured tale seems to go on every time I expected it to stop.  The twists and turns and mysteries presented in the tale are gorgeous and unexpected.  I thoroughly enjoyed it when I absolutely did not expect to do so.  This is a book worth reading and worth having to re-read again.<br /><br />This book is told in the old style, sort of gothic with all the Victorian &#34;sensibilities&#34; of my some of my favorite books.  I don't know when the book was written, but truthfully, if I see anything else written by Wilkie Collins, I am definitely going to read it.<br /><br />A perfect read any time of the year and I highly recommend it.  This is a character study as much as it is gothic mystery.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game along the lines of Temple Run. The sound effects are great, the graphics are fun, and as always, the Minions are quite entertaining.
B005544TRQ|4.0|I am going to continue with my request that amazon not require comments in order to rate something! I can understand why you would like products rated and I do read reviews when considering a purchase, but not when watching tv or movies! I pretty much look at the stars only!
B002BVQU5A|5.0|Really good movie with real &#34;characters&#34;  No one can do strange like Johnny Depp!  I enjoyed this feel good movie a lot.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|A little slow at times but the story has an interesting twist.  Solid Friday night rental, you'll be entertained. Four Stars
B009GESJH2|5.0|it arrived on time, i love it, i love kid rock to death, i really enjoy his music and hope to meet him someday.
B00AHSGNJM|3.0|i purchased this video for my three year old--although the movie was beautiful my son was very frigtened. i wish i would have rented the film rather than made the purchase.
1452110581|4.0|This little book of cat poems became quite repetitive by the end of it, The material was original for the most part, and some of the little poems were amusing, so the couple bucks I spent on it were worth it.
0061906220|5.0|I will be able to teach so many different concepts to my first graders with this book. I am very excited to use it.
B002FQOI0A|3.0|From the very beginning, this story draws the reader in. It makes you want to keep reading to figure out what in the world is happening. It was enjoyable, but a little bit out there for younger readers.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A lot of this book gave off a depressing mood, but that's what made it so great. The events that lead up to the finale can get tedious, but it definitely pays off, so I hope the film adaptation isn't a complete flop.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is so awesome the graghics rock but it could be a little beter with more fun fun fun.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I love the way you have to get more cards just to get the card you need. Next thing you know you have all of them. Exciting!!!!
B001ECQ6E2|1.0|I love this movie, and my favorite scenes - Nero acting berzerk burning Rome - were pixelated and unwatchable. The entire sequence was wrecked. I don't like dissing anyone, but I feel really ripped off.  The video was shipped on time, but that is the only good thing that I have to say.  This is the first time that I have been unhappy using Amazon. All my other purchases I rated a 4 or a 5.  I should have paid attention to what other people wrote. I thought previous complaints were just flukes. I suspect the whole lot of Quo Vadis is defective.
0345529057|5.0|I got this book series in an extremely timely matter and I can't put the books down. This is the next legendary set of books.

B000YJ54DU|1.0|This book was crap... 85% descriptive of how far he walked and what ppl were wearing! Easily read in a couple of hrs if all you read was the first sentence of each paragraph... Don't get me wrong... I love the Jack Reacher books... This is the 12th Reacher book I've read in 3 weeks... But this was a waste of my money and time. This is also the first time I've ever given such a poor review of a book EVER!! Mr Child... Please don't do this again...
B00181JGI2|5.0|In the parlance of our times Big Lebowsjki is the greatest movie of all time!! Didn't like seeing Donnie go!!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book connects your worldly view to a heavenly view,it changes the thought of dying with fear to that of<br />a wonderful expectation.
0380713802|5.0|What can I say? Bill Bryson is the most interesting writer ever; wherever he goes, I go with him and really enjoy his travels while sitting on my couch.
B008JFURII|2.0|Not as good as \\"Red,\\" this sequel has a creaky plot, whose three sections don't segue. Jumping from one continent to another doesn't help. Then there are its many cliches: Rescue from a firing squad, turning the bad guy around, avoiding execution at the last minute. The chase scene is a mite long. Much too many rounds of automatic weapons fire. The running gag about putting Willis in touch with his sensitive side falls flat. Hopkins character isn't convincing, though Helen Mirren's impersonation of a mad Queen Elizabeth II is inspired, if brief. All this would have worked, if done campy, but done straight is a tad too much to ask from an audience, except at a Drive-in. As is, this is this a bad script perpetrated to exploit superannuated actors with box office appeal. Bottom line: Don't bother.
B004HWYTP4|2.0|Cute idea and fun cast, but it didn't hold my attention. I was hoping for more given the combination...maybe the sequel will work out better?
B00CHILW64|5.0|It's amazing that this is a true story.  God certainly had his hand on this family!  The story is incredible, the acting is excellent, scary recreation of the devastation and trials experienced by survivors of a natural tragedy.  Bravo.
B00AD9YLG2|3.0|It takes time to really understand,but the challenge is nice. I think reading it a second time would definitely be necessary.
B001NEK2GE|1.0|I bought several of these G-13s, in the hope that perhaps one of them would be decent enough not to break. The first one shorted at the cord near the LCD, the second one, several buttons stopped working, the third one did the same thing as the first one and now, this fourth one? Just did the same thing as the first and third. I give up. I play a lot of WOW, but that's it. I don't use it for anything else. I have tried the Belkin and I will probably go back to the original Belkin just because I still have it and it works. So much for looking into upgrading into something nice. :(
B004KPX5GC|5.0|An amazing story of a horse so amazing that in the final race of the Triple Crown spectators, horsemen and women, bettors, and owners stood open-mouthed as Secretariat crossed the finish line. If you are too young to have not seen this race and learned of the history of what was to become history's top racing equine, then you must watch this movie. It has all the drama and excitement you'll want and was executed in a way that will leave you wanting to watch it again and again.
B006Z20976|5.0|So nice to be able to sit down with the whole family to enjoy a really good movie. Kudos to the crew who put this on.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I'm hooked and can't wait for season three! Those two have to get back to being friends! Harvey must forgive Mike.
B0094K1PW4|5.0|I really like how the movie is pulled together and focuses on the human element and leaves the alien in the abstract.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I enjoy the show because the actors stay the same with a good main story line with another story that starts and stops with each episode.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved everything about this book. The authors choice of words were so captivating. I loved the intensity of Christian and Ana's relationship. I cannot wait to read Part II.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to all mature audiences. If you have ever experienced true love than you will understand that electrifying pull the characters in this book has.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|moving side to side on a kindle should be easier. it is fun and entertaining though. my son enjoys the minions and wishes more costumes were available.
B0068FZ07Y|5.0|This sophomore film project from director George Lucas is a testament to the world of cinema being the first film to pretty much feature simultaneous stories going on at one time (nowadays, they have this setup on sitcoms all the time), the first film to have an entire soundtrack of classic rock n roll and pop music in the background, and the first film to technically have a popular TV sitcom spin-off (\\"Happy Days\\"). To put it in the simplest of terms, this film is a pure rock n rollin' good time!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Other than my set-top-box having some networking issue connection up to Amazon, it was great.<br /><br />As for the series, Season 3 is much better than season 2 from a pacing perspective.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really did not want this story to end!!  Wish there was more...a great read..the whole triology..!!!!! You will not be sorry

B008J34466|4.0|Its pink. What else can you say. The music is awesome. I listen to it over and over. Diffenitly are driving music
B004TTMYQG|4.0|After using this wonderful app for 2 years, I now have to sign in to the Amazon app store EVERY TIME I OPEN THE CALENDAR!! This must have come via an update. DO NOT BUY APP FROM AMAZON, go to Google Play Store. This is a nightmare. I love this app, it is the perfect calendar but the Amazon-imposed nag screen has ruined this app.<br /><br />Does anyone knows if I buy the Business Calendar app again from Google Play this time, can I transfer my Amazon purchased calendar app data over to the new app? Alternately, can I maintain 2 separate Business Calendar apps, the Amazon one which I will keep as data storage and the new Google app to use going forward? Thanks!

B005PK57IK|5.0|This is simply a joy to watch.  And, I love the Investigator, Calinda.  SHE IS AN AWESOME ACTRESS.<br />Can't wait for the last season to come to Amazon.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|if you love despicable me as much as I do, then you'll love this game! its funny, entertaining and the minions brighten anyone's day! its a must have! (;
B005MMZ63C|5.0|Really not much to add. My favorite movie Ive ever seen. A joy to watch, it a shame the Welles paid such a steep price for the rest of his professional live because of Hearst!
B00821OX98|5.0|I thought this wasn't going to be that great but I find myself compelled to watch. Even my son is intrigued to watch it with me!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Had a great time getting to the end. It said continued but when and where does it do that. I wanted it to last. Longer
B000000OQF|4.0|Happy with speed of service. CD works perfectly. Was a pleasure to work with this seller. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|The gopher and all the traps makes this my favorite game. It keeps me interested and engaged.  I am glad to be able to now get this on my kindle.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Got hook on season 1 can't get enough.  The actors are wonderful and I just love the accents.  Great show!
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Again, no disappointment with another Lee Child story! As I'm sure has been said many times over, this guy really knows how to put together a plot. Thoroughly enjoyed this book!
B00A822VDY|5.0|Love Monsters Inc.  Somehow this movie never made it into our collection, so we just got it so that we can get the kids excited to see Monsters U
B005544V6A|5.0|Sharp, fast-paced, well-written and edgy...I love this series so far! I would definitely recommend it to my friends, especially those who are business-minded.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Wonderful opening season filled with back biting, suspense, great side steps and shuffle...skirting the law, using the law, power struggles within the firm...it has it all!  Both Harvey and Mike are superb flawed characters and they are enhanced by an equally talented and flawed host of lawyers within and without the firm.  One of the best series in a long time.  Kudos to USA for airing this gem, and, of course, thanks to Amazon Prime for catching up those of us who missed the original broadcasts!
B0025KW29U|5.0|I had my reservations the first time my friend wanted me to watch a Neil Patrick Harris musical, er, sing along blog.  However, it was a refreshing take on a musical, and is humorous, witty, and heartfelt.  In a way, it's a man's musical, er, sing along blog, and actually wish it had been a little longer.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|The game itself is incredibly original and unique, though some of the levels may be a little too hard for younger generations, but you can skip those and press on! Right off the bat, it's fun. The start screen, which you are free to do whatever you wish with no consequences. Want to ride a giant purple T-Rex and knock over the tree to get to your goal? Go for it.<br /><br />More levels and avatars available for additional purchases in game, which is the only reason I knocked the rating down from 5 to 4 stars. I would rather just pay the extra few bucks and get twice the levels and have the avatars be unlockable, not purchased.
B002WY65W4|5.0|A rock-em sock-em zombie movie with a heart of Little Debbie Twinkie gold, that doesn't take itself seriously and invites the viewer in for the fun.
B004XWLHI0|4.0|There's not much of a (musical) score to this movie and it's not as exciting as it looked in the previews, but it is well-done and creepy, especially if you're someone who's just about to go off to college and have no choice but to room with someone you don't know. This movie was intended to horrify college-bound students, I think.<br /><br />I suggest this movie to you if you are in the target audience or if you like movies about insane people.
B0081336FO|5.0|This is a great update for the Sherlock Holmes story. It is similar to the American series, Elementary. I like both but I prefer this version. They do a better job of following his deductions and tie in better to the original stories. And I know that this is a minor point but I like the British actor better. He comes across as a better Sherlock Holmes.  I look forward to the third season.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Ender's Game is considered a classic of Science Fiction writing, and though I just read it recently for the first time I can completely see why.  The story is incredibly creative, but holds on to ideas that make readers say &#34;maybe this could actually happen one day&#34;.  However, the strongest aspect of the book might be its characters.  Orson is able to create strongly opinionated characters, that fall on so many different levels of the &#34;ethics spectrum&#34;.  This allows for readers to enjoy many of the stories characters along with the main character.  On another note, I felt the books flow, and progression kept it very interesting, but possibly a little to fast at times.  Furthermore, I think the ending of the story, though awesome in many lights, was slightly abrupt, and maybe even unsatisfying.  However, I think that is simply the way I felt individually, and many readers might completely disagree.  It could also just have been that I was upset because that awesome book was finished..
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|I checked into this series because of the Doctor Who connection. The first ones were OK.  I'll watch a few more to see. I hope that they get better.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Cute movie - want to see the sequel as well.  Hopefully, the minions have a starring role as they were definitely the highlight of the first movie.
1451695195|4.0|This book leads to many questions and hopeful answers.  I great read for someone who has little faith or is afraid of the afterlife.  I<br />do believe the information is true and the experiences actually happened.  A good read.
B000QGAU4E|2.0|Everything about this movie is depressing from the plot to the loud artillery fire that serves as a continuous background. It would be more interesting in black and white than the dreary browns and grays that it is shot in. If this is the nature of mankind shoot me now, ( pun intended)<br />Its touching that the birth of a baby stops the endless warring for about 5 seconds. Somehow I bet the book was better. This left a lot to be desired including why everyone was shooting each other in the first place
B009YG2ND8|5.0|I miss old school games like this. Glad Square Enix brought this game to the android platform. Great game if your into RPG`s.
B00296A4F4|5.0|This is a show that filled a void we didn't even know we had on network television- a musical drama-dy (drama/comedy) with the soundtrack that adults could relate to, and kids could enjoy. The first season introduced us to the characters, immersed us in their lives and struggles and had us laughing and crying with them by the end of the first episode- by the third episode, a phenomenon was born. The musical arrangements give us goosebumps- and while handling music, life issues, and social issues-it gave us an escape with an edge of reality to it. The first season ends with regionals and leaves us looking forward to much more!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book like all the others i have read from Rick was epic. Plenty of action and great story telling.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I like the fact that the movie stayed with actual geographic designations from the book.  I just have to find my copy and finish reading it.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This book could have finished, now your just dragging it out! Plus this was supposed to be the last book in the series, I do not like waiting for another one.  The book was good, not as good as the first two and as I said it's getting too dragged out at this point
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|If you want a challenge this is it.  All the Quell Games get 5 stars from me.  These are a lot of fun.
B000JMKQX0|1.0|This book was very confusing to read, especially on my iPhone.  I would definitely like to purchase a paper back version instead.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Me and my fiance have been having a hard time finding good movies to watch and we are both big Steve Carrell fans so we figures we would give this a try. Ended up really enjoying this, we both love comedies this movie made us laugh while still having a good story to keep us interested.
B0012GN404|5.0|Oh yeah, had to keep my vinyl safe, and get some more janis on the portable devices - radio, mp3, oh man, can't play this in traffic.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|One of those all around good movies..good comedy & drama with a great story line.Would defiantly recommend this movie to anyone looking for a decent film to watch.
B0052FG750|5.0|this one had cuts that were not on my collection of cds but were on my vinyl.<br /><br />You know how it is, you have a doors song rolling around in the back of your head, you hear a piece of it on the radio, you can't find it in your collection. Bam!!! found it on amazon, bought it, and summer, doors, my babe. I am rolling to tunes.
B001B2CPH2|5.0|This film should be a requirement for United States citizenship examination. This is one of the best romantic films in Hollywood legends.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well worth checking out.  I really enjoyed the characters.  I'm glad I took the time to read this collection and the Shift collection as well.  Waiting on the next installment.  Mr. Howey really made this world come to life.
B000002GKT|5.0|This is so much better than that pop drivel Peter Frampton sold out to. Not that that album doesn't have a few good songs, but Frampton needed Steve Marriott.
0385486804|3.0|There isn't much to say about this book.  It was an OK read but not that exciting. I will pass the book along to friends.
B007BT0RKG|3.0|Good maps without the,need for wifi. Search is tricky and not good with addresses.<br />Location can not be set manually. I do not have GPS in phone so maps have no location.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|cool app need more rooms. make more rooms.I don't want tovwrite anything else but its making me if I wanna submit.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|I've learned to appreciate what comes from the BBC. Great acting, characters, the scenery etc. sad this series ended when it did.
B0088W6IMQ|4.0|I like Stargate Atlantis, but is not SG1 which was better casted. and had better writing. David Hewlett is what made Altantis.
0345803493|5.0|Great book. The only problem is that some of the pages came loose from the binding. Other than that, what a great book!
B00BWJ7LYG|2.0|More for kids. Less stunning cinematography than LOR, more digital enhancements. I hated it. And sitting through a 3 hour movie that you hate... kinda sucks
0345803507|5.0|Great book. The only problem is that some of the pages came loose from the binding. Other than that, what a great book!
1451648537|5.0|This biography of Steve Jobs was wonderfully comprehensive, and appears to truly showcase Jobs as he actually was...creative, mercurial, a visionary and a genius. Whether or not you're an Apple products user, I highly recommend this book. Jobs has most likely affected your life, whether you know it or not. He changed the personal computer, how we listen to music, how we consume information, and how we communicate with one another. You won't regret reading this!
0345803485|5.0|Great book. The only problem is that some of the pages came loose from the binding. Other than that, what a great book!
B005MMY9A8|2.0|This movie was mediocre at best.  It was sometimes a bit corny  Guess it was made for a younger audience
B00BCWOFIS|5.0|The season 3 previews lured me in!  I am now caught up on the first 2 seasons and am in love!  Officially taking another lawyers show off my DVR on ABC for this sharp, witty and amazing show!  First Gabriel (Harvey) is an amazing actor, where has he been all my life?, and plays the egocentric but secretly caring corporate lawyer to its utter fine-ness!  I could write on for paragraphs, but seriously this show is stunning. AND, the costume designer is delivering a stunning cast wardrobe!  Those pencil skirts, LV and the 3 piece suits -Wowza!
B002KCO6QA|5.0|I thought this movie was great because, it was captivating until the end and kept me guessing,<br />Hollywood always seems to put out movies that portray the life we will soon be  living, therefore, America needs to wake up! We will all be corporate slaves if we don't get pro-active.<br />I would recommend this movie to anyone!
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I got this app for her and she loves it I Had to buy the full version for her :3
B00846REIS|5.0|Better than 50 shades of Grey. After reading the Trilogy I can't wait to see if there is more to come.
161655164X|4.0|Amazing Art, Amazing Game,<br />Contains amazing amounts of art.<br />Would have appreciated more written insight into the development, as well as more of the 3D character and landscape modelling process.<br />I would also urge the publisher to credit the artists involved in each image, I would love to follow up on the artists and their past/ future works.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is one of the best games ever. I love this game.but they should make a lot more minnion suits and more power ups to it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game is awesome because u get to learn how take care and help animals so if u like animals u will love this game just like I do
B00A81NFAS|5.0|this movie send me to another state of mind...  i think that movie was made for me....  many things has passed me through!!!<br />I love this movie it´s one the best...  i hope you enjoy it!!!
B00594XOZU|5.0|It is awesome and great for a tablet because you can text people and other things.. but It needs an update all other phones have the update where you can draw and other things. But Azomson app store doesn't!!! Get the update now!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|brighter!!! one of the most beau-thinkingful movie!!!  i love it...<br />One of the best movie of Tom Cruise... i think....
B00B7Y0206|3.0|This is a good app I can see all my videos but ( bad part ) anyway whatever I play a video it just freezes in every 10 seconds but it is still a good app
B001FB4VZS|5.0|We are all hooked on this serious, I love the way they are packaged, all the discs secure safely in their compartments. I want to get the rest of the season in the same case configuration.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|We watched Seasons 1 & 2 and couldn't stop until we finished both series...then found out Season 3 had to be purchased to view.  There was no hesitation on our purchase of Season 3...as this series is the most entertaining and interesting made-for-tv series we've ever seen!  Not much more to say other than when Season 4 is available...free or cost...we'll watch it!
B00992CF6W|1.0|I have the app for my iphone and its wonderful but on here it wont even begin to download for me :( please help
B00B37RYMQ|5.0|Does anyone write like this anymore?  Of course not; that era is gone.  A slow-moving novel about people's pride, their prejudices, and how these adversely affect their personal relationships.  I marvel continuously at Austen's ability (like Eliot; like Proust) to so vividly portray people, manners, affects, relationships, thoughts, neighborhoods, customs...  With subtlety and tact is each character drawn so that, as with all good novels, when we reach that last page it's as if we had spent a good month visiting with intimate friends and now it was time to go.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun way to help children with their motor skills. It is even fun for young teens. Great game.
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|Convenient and easy to read. Also very easy getting to the storiesyou want to read. I definitely recommend this app.
B008LSVLGU|5.0|Maybe this set doesn't contain EVERY Jimmy Smith album worth having, but come on! 18 albums from his small-group period. This is just 10 CD's of unadulturated pleasure. The two albums on the first CD might come off a little cheesy, but by the second CD, he's found his groove. If you like Jimmy Smith (why wouldn't you?), you should beef up your collection with this set.
B000001GX8|5.0|If you want to free your mind and spirit with a music time to time then you should have this collection which can be played for hours. I love it and will order again next time.
B00821PCJS|4.0|End of the world - humans v aliens - fighting for survival.  It has a good story line and I've enjoyed what I've seen so far.
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|I did not see much humor for adults. It had some cute scenes but nothing laugh out loud for me.
B000LXHK22|5.0|This is a fine screen rendition of Peter Mayle's book, &#34;A Good Year&#34;.  Like Mayle's other work, it takes place in Provence and is finely crafted to convey the atmosphere.  A multilayered story of developing moral values and their emergence.  The acting is first class for all of the characters. A good antidote to our current forced diet of texting, Facebook, Twitter, and other linguistic and cultural atrocities.  I highly recommend this as a psychological and cultural refreshment.
B009YU6FJM|5.0|I would have bought this entire album for the song Entombed alone. But this recording is stellar from top to bottom.
B008XKT9FG|3.0|I wasn't crazy about the movie, but after a very slow start, it was okay. The ending made it worthwhile to watch.
B00ADS90EQ|5.0|The list of movies I can watch over and over again, without getting bored, is a relatively short one. This movie is one, and I love it, my husband loves it, and my kids love it. I actually lent out my physical copy of this movie, so I purchased a digital copy because we had family in town that wanted to watch it. Everybody loved it. We love the songs, we love that acting, and we seriously enjoy all of the comedy throughout.
B00CL68BK2|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in a long time and the acting by all was great. If you're like me, Italian and a football fan, I think you'll like it too. Though I'm not from Philly, I've known Italian families that I could relate to this story. Great, great, great.!!!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|Since i got this app i have really improved on my drawing skills and it is good to talk to your friends my art teacher even loves this app some times my teacher makes us just use this app for home work or for fun so if i loved this app i pretty sure u will to
B001UV4XHY|5.0|If you liked any of the other 7 Harry Potter movies, you will like this. Just as the books and the characters matured, this movie is more mature than the previous 6.<br />I suggest reading all of the books in order - and watching all of the movies in order too.<br />The Order of the Phoenix was my favorite Harry Potter book, but I enjoyed ALL of the books so very much, including Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. I think that The Order of the Phoenix may also be my favorite HP movie, but they were all good, especially Deathly Hallows Parts I and II.<br />In my opinion, this movie is not appropriate for young children.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|this game is so adicting it is very hard to stop playing world at arms I just stopped so I can do this.
B004HW7JH4|5.0|&#34;Mad Men&#34; remains the epitome of television art.  It's the only series I own on disc.  For me, it's the only show worth returning to over and over.  The peculiar nature of the American character has never been explored more intelligently or entertainingly.  Brilliant.<br /><br />RB
B00CL68NOG|3.0|the movie was ok.  could take it or leave it.  never really picked up to where it was exciting.  wouldn't watch again.
B00B5ACNRM|5.0|I'm sure other customers have made note of this, but I know that some people are still confused and don't understand this two part &#34;Dark Knight&#34; animated video is not Saturday morning fare.  These are rather faithful adaptations of the greatest Batman story of all time, &#34;The Dark Knight Returns, &#34; by the brilliant Frank Miller.<br /><br />When the chapters of this graphic novel were first released in 1986, readers everywhere in the country had their minds blown.  For the first time, the whole concept of Batman and the comic book universe he lives in was elevated to the level of actual literature.  Comic book elements important to the genre were still there, brutal fights, impossible gizmos, over-the-top dramatics - but all done in a fresh way that gave these elements new life in the context of the dark, futuristic world Miller created.<br /><br />As a big fan of the original work, I'm very pleased with these animations, especially since much of Miller's unique illustrative style is captured all throughout.<br /><br />Great story, very well done, and a worthy modern homage to Miller's masterpiece.  DON'T buy this series as just more discs to toss in the kid's stack - These two parts make up a big, epic adult movie as gripping as the live action Nolan trilogy.<br /><br />RB
B0091X2K0A|5.0|My drill sergeant was this dude- so when I watch the first half of this movie, it always makes me laugh 'til tears run down my face, and then...BAM- it gets real serious - real fast.  This movie is perhaps a good enough wake up call to folks about what military llfe looks like, but I also believe it's pretty one sided and very jaded to a view that was anti- before it got going?  But I'd watch it, the acting is first rate, and even though the characterizations are pretty lop sided and dang near stereotypical, it's still worth the time to see it.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|This game is awesome it teaches how to use these guns and how to load them I like this app is awesome<br /><br />I recommend it for everyone
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|Its fun and strategic. It allows u to be able to experience a nonlinear game for free like no other.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|It was done well with no use of fowl language.  Very good cast.  We enjoyed it and will go to see RED2
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I loved it soo much it is a great game to play especially if  u have some time on your hands<br /><br />Love it 5/6
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|As compared to Despicable Me 2 this is not as good.  However it is clean entertainment suitable for kids.  Lots of funny scenes.
B005G5PPGS|5.0|Great story of how one person changed the way professional baseball should be run.  Good reading for any baseball fan.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I've had my watch for a little over a month now and I've been nothing but pleased with it since I first put it on. The canvas strap, which is showing slight wear from being taken off and put back on daily, is comfortable and solves the problem I have with most watches chafing my skin or pulling at arm hairs.<br /><br />The watch itself is easy to wind. I've forgotten to wear it on the weekends a few times and it has stopped altogether. I simply move it back and forth for about 30-60 seconds (as described by the instructions for taking it out of the box for the first time) to get the mechanisms moving and then reset the time. It does tend to move around about 2 minutes after a few days, like most have described, but it's easy enough to pop out the little nob and readjust as necessary.<br /><br />The watch face itself has stayed clean and shows no wear despite my clumsy tendency to knock it into counters, chairs, shelves, and anything else I'm walking by during a regular work day. It also is fairly sized for my wrist, not too small, and not obnoxiously big like most men's watches these days, which was an important part of the reason why I chose this one.<br /><br />Overall, this has been a fantastic watch to wear and use. I'm looking forward to keeping it on my wrist for a long as it'll keep ticking. I would happily buy Seiko again and recommend this watch to others with similar watch tastes.
B00AZMFO9U|5.0|Thru humane look on life. Positively not for hip generation. Little to deep, for some people. We really love it!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is one addictive game. It takes a while to collect enough money to increase performance of your vehicles..but it is fun to do so. Hint: Buy the moon landscape as soon as possible to earn tons of money!
B00D6BQG1W|4.0|My husband and I both really liked this movie. He is really into the whole zombie thing, and I just thought it looked interesting so we decided to watch it. It was honestly really good. Try rolling a rom-com into a weird not quite so gory zombie movie and this is what you get. So if you are looking for just a zombie movie, I wouldn't suggest it. However, personally I think it was a different and interesting take on the whole zombie thing, and it even had a few real life points that you could take from it. All in all, I really liked it and so did my husband. It was a little on the slow side in some parts, but not so slow that we couldn't get through it.
0525953728|5.0|This was a good book.  Had a good time reading it.  Was a very easy read.  Good for any military reader.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love this book and the movie. Getting to &#34;see&#34; inside someone else's head that suffers from mental illness definitely helps me relate. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and a mood disorder, and like the main male character in the book I am easily triggered depending on the situation. I am no where near as bad as him, but it definitely helps me relate. The characters even talk about how everything feels when those kinds of things happen and that reminded me of myself constantly. The storyline was great, and the look into another view of mental illnesses was great too. These people go on to live completely &#34;normal&#34; lives even though they have their quirks.
0316019984|5.0|I am an adult collector of pop up books, primarily by Matthew Reinhart and Robert Sabuda as their creations are in my experience,  a cut above the rest. They are all awesome, remarkably inventive, creative and very impressive. My least favorite purchase has been \\"Star Wars\\", so I was reluctant to purchase \\"DC Super Heroes\\" as I assumed I would have a  similar response.<br />  I finally gave in as my need to have the complete collection overtook my lack of interest in both the material and the assumed format. Boy, was I wrong! \\"DC Super Heroes\\" is my new favorite! It's truly awesome. Everything about this book is fabulous. The colors, the stories, the smaller pop-ups on every page and the large pop-ups which are all as great as the best page in most of the other books. I am so glad I own this book and give it my highest recommendation.
1611748755|5.0|My son (age 16) and I listened to it on CD in the car together! We were riveted! Highly recommend!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Flawless and beautiful period piece. Stunning photography. I love to watch certain characters' human stories ebb and flow in depth and detail. Depiction of the classes and changing post war times for society is a well told story. Many historical events that happened in a similar snapshot of that time and place, are well woven into this series. I always learn so much behind the characters' stories.
B00CJGP116|4.0|Make no mistake, this is a great production by anybody else's standards, but Marc has set the bar so high with his previous salsa records that this one falls just a little short. While Marc's interpretations are on point as usual, there are definite lulls during the course of the record where arrangements and vocals become mundane. However, all the songs are solid. Standouts include: \\"Cambio De Piel,\\" a song asking the question of how we turn a new page in life and overcome the fear of failure, Marc's take on \\"Hipocrecia\\" and \\"La Copa Rota,\\" well known classics, and the celebratory, feel-good single, \\"Vivir Mi Vida.\\" Similar to how Tiger Woods is expected to win everytime he takes the course, Marc is expected to deliver a hole in one with every record. But the harsh reality is that just like Tiger hasn't won a major tournament in 5 years, Marc hasn't delivered a truly superb production since \\"Libre\\", his last salsa record. Maybe, like Tiger, we are expecting brilliance everytime, a standard that he might never be able to live up to again.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|It is a compelling family story.  Love seeing how the &#34;help&#34; lives and share their lives with the owners.  So good!
B000F3T3CS|3.0|The english subtitles don't work entirely correct on this DVD, sometimes the text disappears (don't exist?) during singing of the libretto!
B009MYAQK4|5.0|this book is very moving and inspiring. a must read. Paulo Coelho has definitely done it again, the best writer of our time.
B003U69IX6|5.0|Watched this with our 8 y.o. and 4 y.o. boys. Both hubby and I were pleasantly entertained, and of course the boys loved the mythical storyline and of course, the action.
B00AFCEIB0|3.0|There’s nothing special here. I have come to like Google gmail because it’s less cluttered than others I use. But from the start this one appears to want to advertise a lot. I understand apps exist to extract money, but I had in mind more of a Google gmail experience and that's not what this is.

B001EBYMB2|5.0|Best boot camp movie ever.  Acting is outstanding.  I'm a Vietnam Vet.  Not so sure everything about the &#34;Nam&#34; is that accurate.  I didn't care for the scene where they are talking about the stare.  Too contrived.  Otherwise excellent movie.  Watched it a number of times.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|A copy of this book was purchased by me for my own reading pleasure. This review also appears at SeductiveMusings.blogspot.com.<br /><br />This review may contain spoilers for BARED TO YOU (Crossfire #1) and REFLECTED IN YOU (Crossfire #2). Each book can nominally be read stand-alone but I would not recommend it.<br /><br />ENTWINED WITH YOU picks up exactly where REFLECTED IN YOU left off, with Eva reeling from the incredible revelation that Gideon Cross has given her the ultimate gift of safety, but at a cost no one could have ever anticipated. His actions in the latter third of the previous book now make a twisted sense to us and to Eva, but that doesn't mean it is safe for Eva to return to Gideon, at least not yet. The bulk of ENTWINED WITH YOU follows Eva and Gideon in their continuing journey of trust and love toward a lasting and emotionally sound relationship. But as with the previous books, there are external forces working to against them, not the least of which is the continuing danger in which Gideon has placed himself by his actions at the end of the second book. Along the way there are also ex-lovers, misbehaving parents and well-meaning friends on both sides, none of whom can truly understand the depth of the passion shared by Gideon and Eva, or they wouldn't be so keen on keeping the two lovers apart. As Gideon and Eva mature emotionally and learn to trust in their love, they move ever closer to that perfect happy ending that we all want to see.<br /><br />As with the other two books in the Crossfire series, I greatly enjoyed all the intimate scenes between Eva and Gideon, and was especially happy to see them stop pushing each other away any time things got a little difficult between them. The problems they both face due to their damaging pasts can't just be ignored, and we see that both are continuing to work hard on dealing with how they are and what they have experienced. What I did not enjoy was so much of the latter portions of the book being devoted to setting up multiple side plots with secondary characters that were clearly designed to provide fodder for the next books in the series. I have no doubt that in the next two books, we'll find that the dilemmas of these secondary characters are directly related to what will happen to Gideon and Eva, but frankly, I resented that they took up so much of my time.<br /><br />The sense of ENTWINED WITH YOU being a \\"filler\\" book feeds into my take on the current controversy surrounding its release and the somewhat recent revelation that this would not be the final book of a long-promised trilogy, but the third of a now five-part series. I posted most of my immediate reactions on Twitter back when I finished reading the book, which was that I felt like I'd only read half of the story I'd been led to believe would be in this third Crossfire book. If I hadn't learned that this was not the last book before I read it, I'd be just as outraged as all the other people who are making their anger known all over the Internet. After all, this was a book that was already delayed an extra 6 months within weeks of its originally scheduled release date, and then to discover on the last page that it doesn't have the HEA we've all been waiting to read? In my opinion, there might have been less outrage if the series extension had been announced back when the release date was delayed, but all we can do is hope that better decisions will be made with regard to the rest of the Crossfire series. In any case, it's a tribute to Sylvia Day's writing skill and the Crossfire series that any delay in seeing Gideon and Eva get their happily ever after can inspire such outrage in so many deeply invested readers.<br /><br />Although ENTWINED WITH YOU wasn't as satisfying to me as the previous books in the Crossfire series, I know I'm happy with what I got of Gideon and Eva's continuing romance and trust that Sylvia Day knows exactly where they must go before they can live happily ever after. I only hope I don't have to wait until next year to find out what happens next.<br /><br />Ratings:<br /><br />Overall: 3.5 (I wanted less Megumi and Corrine, more Eva and Gideon!)<br />Sensuality level: 4ly hope I don't have to wait until next year to find out what happens next.<br /><br />Ratings:<br /><br />Overall: 3.5 (I wanted less Megumi and Corrine, more Eva and Gideon!)<br />Sensuality level: 4

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Not the best Dan Brown Novel. Good action in the beginning but the ending was drawn out and a little preachy.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Very entertaining and nicely combines all the individual series together<br /><br />Very well done, great action, nice laughs, very enjoyable for the whole family
B002T921AC|1.0|When I first heard this \\"music\\" I thought a girl was singing. Seriously, this is as bad as it gets
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Although I enjoyed this book I didn't think it was quite as exciting as the Kite Runner, nor enlightening and heart wrenching as A Thousand Splendid Suns, which is one of my favorite books.
