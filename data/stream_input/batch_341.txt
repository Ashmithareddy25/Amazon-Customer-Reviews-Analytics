If your flesh is being burnt by lye you can't stop the pain with water - you need an acid, like vinegar.  This is an analogy.  The pain of existence can't be stopped with neutral action, it takes proactive - and like acid - potentially destructive action before the pain can be neutralized.<br />If this sounds like nonsense, if you are threatened by these ideas, then you should come by next Thursday for our weekly meeting.

B0000AR8NK|5.0|I'm a huge 70's bowie fan that lost interest after Let's Dance. Bowie seemed to be missing his midas touch. That is until the Earthling album. He has been back in amazing form every album since. On Reality he raises the bar again. The first time I listened to this album I was floored! The fact that after 3 decades Bowie can still create an album like Reality, proves he is one of the greatest artist of our time. A must have for any Bowie fan.
B000021XR5|5.0|No. 4 solidifies STP's legacy of the 90's.  A spectacular album, made more so by its simplicity and time of production.  STP came full circle with No. 4, utilizing all aspects of their talents to create a moody, yet raw opus.  &quot;Down&quot; sets the stage with its raucous and powerful tune, and its drive is carried on throughout the next three songs--through &quot;Church on Tuesday,&quot; with even more clever guitar riffs and undertones.  The fifth song, &quot;Sour Girl,&quot; was probably the song that sold the album to me (as if any new STP album wouldn't).  The song's direction and melodic flow just hit the spot.  If there was ever any doubt about their ability to wander off the beaten path and throw the listener off guard, there shouldn't be now.  The change of pace from the previous four songs and the genuine quality of the song make its position on the album essential (and perfect).  After listening to the album several times, however, the eighth song, &quot;Glide,&quot; slowly became my favorite tune on the album.  Its steady beat and dominating chorus give the album its second wind, so to speak.  The final three songs (&quot;I Got You,&quot; &quot;MC5,&quot; and &quot;Atlanta&quot;) ensure the album doesn't fade away with fillers.  Each one in its own right envokes comparisons to songs of the latter '60s.  &quot;I Got You&quot; is very similar to &quot;Sour Girl&quot; in its impact to the listener, and the erratic drumming by Kretz is right on in &quot;MC5.&quot;  &quot;Atlanta,&quot; with its striking similarity to &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; from Mary Poppins (shocking, isn't it?) ends it in grande style and is a great ballad.  For STP fans (and music fans in general), the Weiland/Deleo combination(s) is heard in full force in No. 4 and thus solidifies STP as one of the best bands of the '90s (not to mention our generation).

B00005JKG7|4.0|The Fog has always been misunderstood. Perceived initially as a failure because it didn't deliver the shocks of Halloween and the respectable but far from outstanding box office, The Fog is actually a superior ghost story and attempt by John Carpenter and Debra Hill to try something new. The Fog is an eerie mood piece that has far more going on than meets the eye.<br />On the 100th Anniversary of Antonio Bay the community has elected to hold a celebration and unveil a statue to their forebearers. Unfortunately, there's a curse associated with the community that no one is aware of. 100 years before six founding members of the community caused a clipper ship to crash on the rocks. All the crew and passengers were killed. Why and how it happened is part of the mystery of the story.<br />During the witching hour on the anniversary of the crash, an eerie fog rolls in occupied by the ghosts of that clipper ship. The Fog itself has an uncanny ability to cause electrical appliances to fail, cars to stall and furniture to mysterious move across the room.<br />Clearly Carpenter was attempting to tell a much more complex ghost/revenge story than slasher film Halloween. Although The Fog isn't as accomplished (or confident)as Halloween, the cast and ambitions carry the film. Carpenter's attempt to make The Fog itself a character is very successful. You can see hints of later Carpenter masterpieces such as The Thing in this early effort.<br />The transfer is from a nearly pristine and beautiful print of the film. The extras include the original featurette on the film and a new documentary chronicling the making of the film. Also included are a brief storyboard to film comparison (which, admittedly, could have included a bit more), the trailers, photos and some outtakes.<br />MGM does a terrific job on this DVD, Carrie and The Howling. Clearly they've taken their reissues of MGM and Avco-Embassy productions seriously. I can't imagine Anchor Bay or Criterion doing a better job for a single disc special edtion such as this.a single disc special edtion such as this.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Maynard and APC are doing something truly special with music.  This album (more like magnificent opus that makes you shiver in awe at the talent and brilliance that went into creating such a piece of art) is going to end up in the rarified air of Radiohead's OK Computer-HTTT, Tricky's Maxinquaye, Nirvana's Nevermind, Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, U2's The Joshua Tree, and Tool's Lateralus.  Musical journies like this come along only once in a great while.  You would be wise to pick this up now.
0316926345|5.0|This book is marvelous...when it was written it may have been valued for the story of religious convictions and societal conventions coming between a man and a woman who were in love.  Today it is more of a fascinating tale of a way of life that is not to be found on any continent, any country, anywhere.  I'm especially fascinated with the &quot;roaring twenties&quot; which to me, with my historical detachment, are kind of like the 60's only without the still lingering societal wounds.  My first introduction to this story was the amazing &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; adaptation which starred Jeremy Irons and his laconic british-accented narration.  To this day I associate everything before the 1940's with the always detached, always calm, always above all capable attitude that came across in the series.  Maybe the main reason to read this book today is simple escapism.  Maybe you just want to enter a world of easy privilege, if only for an hour or two.  Maybe you just want to be reminded that the people that you know, and how they behave, is probably the most important thing in your life.  It's nothing to be ashamed of, and Evelyn Waugh accomplishes all of these things admirably.
B0000666DW|5.0|How good is this album !? This is one of the best albums i've ever heard. It's ranking up there with Nellyville and Justified, choreographed music at it's best. If you take old metal kings Metallica and their new album and compare it with Mastodon, it's laughable. Mastodon pukes all over everybody and everything. There is not a second of bad music here. <BR>I must get new trousers.<br />PS. I saw them live before i had heard them, and their performance will make Neil Young look like Iggy Pop and/or Rolling Stones.
0060512806|4.0|Have you ever read a book and gotten that feeling that you were being lied to?  That the author is being intellectually dishonest for the sake of his weak storyline or to sell more books or for his own personal foibles?  Do you encounter examples of character behavior that make you say &quot;Oh, for crying out loud!&quot; and throw the book down in disgust because people simply do not act that way?  Neal Stephenson always does that to me.  Time and again he uses plot devices and premises that frankly, offend my intelligence as a reader...but damn him, I can't stop turning pages!  The specific examples of his authorial misbehavior are legion, but if you pick this book up you will finish it, and probably in at most three days.  The man has great storytelling talent, there's no denying it.  I just wish he would spend a little more time in the real world and make his characters a little less, well, unbelievably freakish.  In short, if you buy this book it's money well spent...but the phrase &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; will be more than appropriate.  Kind of like when you read a Tom Robbins book.
B0000DBJDM|5.0|When I think of my favorite video concerts, two in particular come to mind. \\"U2 at Red Rocks\\" and \\"Pink Floyd Live at Pompeii\\". The reason? LOCATION, LOCATION, LOCATION! How can you beat the early, classic Floyd line-up actually setting their gear up in the empty ruins of Pompeii (i.e., no audience), jamming out their awesome pre-\\"Dark Side\\" material as the day's sun sets in the distance?? Then the huge spotlights come on, and they continue playing as night falls around them. No overdubs (unlike most, if not all, of today's \\"live\\" concert vids), and one of the best Floyd performances you'll ever hear. It all makes for quite a \\"heady\\" experience (if you know what I mean - so be sure to enjoy whatever it is you like to enjoy with this show!) Added bonus: in-studio interviews and clips of them making \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" (to be expanded-upon in this DVD edition). A captivating experience - I can only imagine how awesome the DVD version of this will be!!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I understand that not everyone is keen on science fiction, and further that many would giggle at a scifi western, so I guess it didn't surprise me that somehow Firefly was given a terrible timeslot and was dispatched before the first season was even finished.<br />Those of us who gave Firefly a chance were absolutely bereft when it was taken from us.  We stayed home on Friday nights or we exercised our VCRs and TiVos.  We took it on faith that, just as Buffy did not turn out to be 90210 with vampires, so too would this not turn out to be the Lone Ranger with spaceships, and we were right to do so.  It was witty and charming, fun and interesting.  After a few episodes, we gave a damn about the characters.  It had the potential to be another Buffy for Joss Whedon.  In my opinion, it already was.  Alas, it was science fiction, very expensive to produce when produced as well as Firefly was, and not geared to appeal to the lowest common denominator, so in tough economic times it was cancelled in favor of inexpensive and popular reality television.<br />If you like Joss Whedon's other work, buy these DVDs and watch every episode.  Even though you'll lack closure in the end, you'll be glad you did.  Try it, you'll understand.  Then join the rest of us in wishing Joss luck getting a Firefly movie off the ground.
0142004235|4.0|While of course East of Eden is a great novel, brilliantly written with strong characters and great economy of language, and plot development, it's content is extremely sexist and thus limited in it's appeal.  All of the characters are either male, or perjoratively female with the exception of Abra Bacon, the final female character who's role in the novel is minimal.  Although Steinbeck's intent is to reveal the true meaning of life in his modern world by analyzing the biblical tale of Cain and Able, he effectively ends up giving an Episcopal sermon endorsing the male dominant themes of the Bible itself.  Too bad he had no knowledge of or respect for women.
B00000DGUG|4.0|Jagged Little Pill was released when i was 12 years old. I bought it and loved it. When I was 15, Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie was released. I bought it and was disappointed. I only liked a handful of the songs. Eventually, I let my sister borrow it. I never asked for it back and eventually forgot all about it. The other day, my sister brough out a box of her CD's. as I was digging through it i found this album and popped it into the stereo. I've spent a lot of time listening to it and am now appreciating what i didn't 5 years ago. i'm now 20 years old and can appreciate this album for what it was. it contains so many genuinely good songs. i think my (and a lot of other people's) initial disappointment was that this was not Jagged Little Pill Part 2. This is a great album. I truly had forgotten how great Thank U is. I LOVE That I would be good and Can't Not. Are You Stilll Mad and Joining You are fantastic. Great album.

THIS CD SHOCKED THE SH*T OUT OF ME! thats how good it is, its basically complicated metal with a medival sound to it and mostly clean vocals, with beautiful harmonies and melodies. i have to say its hard to select a favorite song for the most part because when you listen to one of them you become sucked into it until its done. fun for anyone who likes talent
0805062971|2.0|What the host site review fails to mention in describing the prose as &quot;lethally swift&quot; is what that swiftness is lethal to... which means, essentially, that you can tell Palahniuk wrote sections of the book in bars, clubs, etc. (which he has discussed in interviews) and not in a place where ideas, characters, anything can really be fleshed out to any great length.  It's a firecracker of a premise, and the film (which, to be fair, I must admit I saw first, which may present some bias) takes all the best parts of the book and gives them visuals, which Palahniuk's prose fails in most cases to do.  The plots differ in some ways.  Without the theme, this book review would rate the novel with one star; the ideas about manhood and culture, etc. give it another star.  The movie gets five stars.  Watch the movie and then read the book, just to get the whole experience.
B000002AH9|5.0|Who wouldn't embrace Billie Holiday's emotionally, cringing,  yet beautiful soul haunting pain that she portrayed in almost every single song she has sung from her soul? I respect Billie Holiday...I read her autobiography, Lady Sings the Blues...getting inside that lady is a higher blessing, a higher beauty, and a higher sense of pain. Nobody can ever express as much pain as she had. Billie Holiday was truly very rare, with a voice that was pure as honey, yet as tarnished as a burnt flower. This album truly reflect her life in whole with the heartache, the pain, the melancholy, the tragedy, and the abuse of a very tarnished heart that has lived to tell the world about it.
B00003CXXJ|4.0|Maybe it is a bit overratted, but I still think it's funny. Shrek was a great twist on the classic fairy tale. Watching Cinderella and Snow White in a fist fight and visiting the disney land theme park kingdom were fun. And by the way, I've heard a lot about this, Fiona didn't NEED to become a Ogre for Shrek to love her, but because that was her true form she truly understood that Shrek loved her whatever she was and she learned to love herself for whatever she was. Being an Ogre was the only way she could truly understand that her beauty wasn't something physical. Of course this is coming from someone who was upset when the beautiful beast became that pale generic Prince in 'Disney's Beauty and the Beast'.
B000002ADT|5.0|When I first heard this album, I truly felt the stranger of the blues. It took me awhile to truly feel the power that this album was portraying through each one of these very talented artist, but as soon as I got to know the shadow So What, the face of Freddie Freeloader, the touch of Blue in Green, the taste of All Blues, and the feeling of Flamenco Sketches, I felt touched through the stranger of each song that touched my heart. This album is truly a legend, a masterpiece, and delicate recipe of jazz and blues in its own right. I believe this album will always grasp the landmark of music as truly the most legendary and artistic jazz albums ever made.

How about &quot;I Found Someone&quot; or &quot;Believe&quot; or &quot;Song For the Lonely&quot;, for crying out loud?  <BR>As I said, glad to have the videos -- three is better than 0 -- but it does seem like a way to milk more money from longtime fans who already have the first edition.

B000002AP1|5.0|I've always had a great interst in proto-punk because it's really the music of the people who started the genre and the stooges are probably the key players. this is such a loud, furious and fantastic album. Not to mention the fact that it was produced by Bowie. every track is filled with energy and well... Raw Power. this album is a must have for anyone who wants to hear where punk came from and music lovers in general. if you like this then you should try the New York Dolls or The MC5.
B000066NW0|1.0|Every time I hear Avril Lavigne I want to vomit! She claims that she isn't punk and then turns around and says that she is. Her songs are boring with childish lyrics and are disgraced with her terrible voice. She sings songs that have no meaning or depth. She is probably the most fake person in the music industry right now. Avril Lavigne needs to rethink the image that she's portraying because she looks like a poser and has lost the respect of everyone who is truly punk.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Okay, from what I've seen over 160+ people have commented on Iron Maiden's new album Dance of Death analysing the new release from the band's songwriting to the lyrics to the guys' performance on their instruments to Bruce's vocals to the mix to the artwork to the production to this to that... etc. All that's necessary to say has already been said. So I'll keep it simple: This is IRON MAIDEN, one of the most important Heavy Metal bands on the planet. One of the handful of bands that has never forgotten where they're coming from, never abandoned their roots and musical vision in hopes of reaching to bigger audiences. They're still what they were back in 1988. Most complaints seem to be about the band's repetitious songwriting. About Harris' overuse of his galloping bass lines. Is there any truth to this? Maybe. I'm not a blinded fan, but at least I know what to expect from my Maiden when they put out a new record. At least it doesn't turn out to be a terrible pop-disco-rap thing that totally bombs and then every band member defends it giving out cliche statements such as &quot;Well we're a band that always progresses. We wanted to try something different on our last album and somehow it didn't work out. We're gonna go back to our roots on the next release, don't worry, keep supporting us blah blah blah&quot; kind of thing. Come to think about it, when was the last time you bought a Maiden album and were so very disappointed with it because Harris &amp; co. had gone disco or had tried to incorporate rap vocals to the music going for a 'modern approach'? But people are still whining out there. This is Maiden. They're doing what they do the best and let me tell you something they're still one of a kind. If you don't like this type of music, well fine. But there's no need to complain. It won't do any good. Maiden has always sounded this way. I myself am a big prog metal fan, but I know what to expect from these guys. I don't go like &quot;They keep repeating themselves over and over again, they're so boring&quot;. Iron Maiden is Iron Maiden. They've been this way the last 25 years, so don't expect them to come out playing something absolutely different all of sudden. Metallica changed after 1991. How many of us still like them? Megadeth changed in 1997 only to 'return to their roots' on their next release. Do you want the same thing to happen to Maiden? I certainly don't.<br />Furthermore, Brave New World was a great step in the right direction. The band acually did push the envelope and try to cover some new ground. While some fans were pleased by it, those Powerslave-era fans kept complaining. So here we have a new record that picks up where BNW left off. Apart from the first two songs, the record contains quite a fe 7+ minute songs. &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;, while not as good as BNW's &quot;Wickerman&quot;, opens the album with total energy and this is continued on the second track &quot;Rainmaker&quot;. Both below the 4-minute mark still manage to set the mood. With songs like &quot;No More Lies&quot;, &quot;Dance of Death&quot; and &quot;Paschendale&quot; we get our old Maiden with their traditional riffs, rich melodies, long but, in my opinion, fitting guitar solos from Gers, Smith and Murray as well as galloping bass lines from Mr Harris. Nicko has always done a great job in Maiden. His drumming is good. I know he's done better before but give these guys a break. They're aging. Still they're pulling it off. They're no longer in their 30's.<br />The sound on Dance of Death is crystal clear, just the way a Maiden album should sound. Kevin Shirley's done an awesome job as a producer. Bruce is as good as always. I know there are nitpickers out there waiting for the guy to accidentally not be able to hit the highest of notes, but no, not on Dance of Death. Cause he pulls it off. He's just one of a kind, a real frontman and the perfect singer for Iron Maiden. I am personally proud to have supported this band ever since I startedlistening to music at the age of 12, and I will continue to do so forever. Maiden makes me proud to be a fan of Heavy Metal. Period.listening to music at the age of 12, and I will continue to do so forever. Maiden makes me proud to be a fan of Heavy Metal. Period.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the first DVD I will ever have bought. I didn't even own a DVD player before I pre-ordered it. I'm trying to convey here just how brilliant \\"Firefly\\" is. The best gorram show in the TV 'verse. FOX bad, cast pretty.
B00005JKN9|1.0|For most of the movie, I could not take my eyes off of the screen. I sat there in the nearly empty theater, staring at the screen in shock, disbelief and horror, because I couldn't believe what I was seeing and hearing! \\"Gangs of New York\\" has got to be THE worst movie I've ever seen in my entire life. Every moment that I spent watching this film was absolute torture!<br />The prelude to the story--showing how The Butcher came to hold his place of power in New York and how Amsterdam came to be hardened and filled with vegeance--was genuinely captivating. The battle between The Butcher's gang and the Irish ragtag gang, led by Amsterdam's father, entices you with the promise of an exciting movie ahead. It never delivers. From this point on, everything goes steadily downhill, right to the tragically disappointing finale. The moments you anticipate never come. You wait with eager anticipation for Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio)to carry out his plans of vegeance on his ruthless, loathesome enemy, The Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), as the former infiltrates the latter's gang and gains his respect and confidence. When more than half of the movie passes, and Amsterdam is still playing right-hand man to The Butcher--even saving his life at one point--you realize with crushing disappointment that this moment will never come--and it never does. (As if that's not bad enough, The Butcher, who you grow to passionately detest throughout the course of the movie, actually becomes a HERO by the end of the film!) Unfortunately, after Amsterdam recovers his dead father's knife and vows to avenge past wrongs near the beginning, you never have any clue what he is planning, or if he's planning anything at all, because we're never really allowed to get into Amsterdam's head.<br />This brings me to the next issue I have with this film. Unfortunately, I couldn't really empathize with Leonardo DiCaprio's character--mainly because I had no idea who he was. The characters were underdeveloped and very poorly written. Whoever made this movie could have spent more time on this essential attribute, and LESS time on unnecessary scenes (dances, bar scenes, numerous stage performances, constant pointless nude and homoerotic scenes, etc.) that made the movie drag on MUCH longer than it should have (I was so bored I couldn't keep my eyes open, and at one point, even dozed off for two or three minutes. Of course, when I opened my eyes, I saw that I hadn't missed a thing). Ultimately, there is no real plot to this movie; there are numerous subplots, resulting in confusion for the viewer. I didn't find the movie to be TOO (eek-I-can't-look-at-the-screen) violent, but there was quite a bit of violence and gore that was not necessary.<br />Furthermore, there were quite a few things that I found unbelievable, such as the fact that Amsterdam's best friend--whose life Amsterdam had saved on, I believe, more than one occasion--jealous that Amsterdam had won the heart of the woman he wanted, betrayed Amsterdam in the worst way. It didn't make sense that he would do something so horrible that nearly cost his friend's life, and not even regret it in the least after having had ample time to give it some thought. He even went so far as to seek to become The Butcher's new right-hand man as a reward for having saved that man's life (but then again, since there was no character development, that may very well have been the guy's nature, after all). The ending, also, was ridiculous, unbelievable, pointless--and horrible.<br />The one good thing about Gangs of New York--nearly lost amidst the chaos that was this movie-was the message it attempted to convey. It is a message that is important in times such as these: that we are all Americans because each ethnic group has fought, suffered and died for our freedom and the right to live in America: Anglo-Americans had to overcome the oppressive British government; and out of fear, they in turn oppressed other groups, such as the Irish-Americans and African-Americans.<br />I hated this movie with a passion unequalled. My BF is still making it up to me for dragging me to this terrible movie, and rightfully so. I hate (so-called) \\"chick-flicks,\\" but I should drag him to one or two, anyway, just to get my revenge. LOL.ns and African-Americans.<br />I hated this movie with a passion unequalled.

It should have been a man like in the play with the surprise ending (things are never what they seem). Plus they left out Mary Sunshine's song. But all in all, I thought it was great. Richard Gere wouldn't have been my choice for that part, but he played it well! One of the love playing scenes could have been left out (Roxie and Fred) so children might not ask questions. But I have to say I LOVED IT!
B00006RCNJ|2.0|I loved the concert, what little of it was on the DVD, which is a short coming of Rieu DVDs. But the video contained a great deal of glare and was hard to watch at times. I have determined that the problem is in the DVD. I noticed when viewing other Rieu DVDs that show samples from the Albert Hall concert that the color quality is poor.<br />One of the characteristics that I have liked about Rieu's concerts is that there is a wide selection of music so that each DVD presents different music. Not so in this DVD. Many of the selections are repeats of the music from &quot;Dreaming.&quot; The interesting thing is when the same pieces were played in &quot;Dreaming&quot; they were dull and poorly played. Yet in this video they are lively and well played and interesting. I must say that there were two pieces on this DVD that I found uninteresting and thank gosh I could just fast forward over them.<br />Again the problem with Rieu DVDs is that only half the concerts are included. Maybe that is because the rest of the concert was boring and for that reason was not included. But I enjoyed most of what was included.
B000002ADT|5.0|I don't feel I even need to explain why this album is a must-have, but I will anyway.  Anyone who doesn't have it either has no appreciation for great music or is just a moron.  From the modal beauty of &quot;So What&quot; to classic blues tunes like &quot;Freddie Freeloader&quot; and &quot;All Blues&quot;, this classic will be listened to until the day the sun explodes.  This album is not simply great because of Miles though.  John Coltrane reaches heights on this recording that he had never reached before.  His solos are so intricate and complex and still soulful.  This album also was a large turning point in Coltrane's life, because he made Giant Steps under the influence of Kind Of Blue.  And how about Cannonball Adderley?  One of the greatest alto saxophonists to ever live, a technical wizard.  There aren't too many saxophonists who could hold their own with Coltrane on record or in live performance.  Just ask Sonny Rollins (who is also a GREAT player).  Bill Evans is swinging in an eloquent, sophisticated way.  His sound on piano always amazed me, and it works magnificently here.  Paul Chambers set the tone for the rhythm.  His beautiful, fat sound kept everything going well.  And Jimmy Cobb, a wonderful drummer, was another anchor in this group, always helping keep the beat steady and cool.  Of course, Miles was the leader and this album is some of his best playing ever.  His beautiful muted work on &quot;Blue In Green&quot; and &quot;Flamenco Sketches&quot; is enough to bring tears to your eyes.  There are no fast tunes on this set, they range from mid-tempo to ballads.  This album had an extreme impact on my life.  I recommend it to anyone.
B00003CXI1|3.0|Clever actors, nice visually, and good timing: this film would be worth five stars were it not for a couple of really worrying ideological problems. The first is something that is found in the books, and which the filmmakers have translated all too faithfully onto the screen - namely, any objectionable character is always portrayed as physically repulsive: Harry's adopted father and brother are overweight, Snape is dark-eyed and greasy-haired, professor Quirrel stutters and has long nails (!) and even the otherwise kind giant Hagrid is demonstrated to be dangerously feckless. The arch-villain Voldemort is so deformed as to be barely human. In other words, there is an underlying body-fascism in this film that kids really don't need.<br />More gravely, the narrative is a classical good-versus-bad story in which anything that Harry does is per definition good, and anything a bad character does is per definition bad. The most glaring example: when Harry is about to embark on his first Quidditch match, he admits to being scared, and is assured that that is all right. Not very long afterwards, Harry himself teases Malfoy for being scared! There is a double standard in this film which is frankly hypocritical and encourages children to think in simplistic terms. Wouldn't it be nice if someone could actually produce entertainment for children that was deliberately thought-provoking?
B000084T18|3.0|The prodigy found by Eminem finally gets his album, as his lyrical thoughts and beats are fantastic, something is very artificial about him, like he's not as gangster as he says he is. Yet I'm here to critic the record not him. Some songs stand out and raises the bar for some rappers. This includes Wanksta, Many Men, and Gotta Make to Heaven which seem to release alot of lyrical feeling and thought, while others such as P.I.M.P, 21 Questions, and In Da Club, ground the rapper and instead of reaching a verbal level and skill of Jay-Z, Nas and even Eminem keeps him more at a level of Nelly, P.Diddy or even his arch enemy Ja Rule who try to get their tracks more into the club than listening for lyrical value. The beats are great, some more than others. He loses many for this album from overuse of guns and violence, and loses alot of points for no creativity or originality(anywhere). If 50 works more on his rhymes, than his appeal, He might become one of the hottest and most respected rappers out there. But as of now, he's just wasted talent being something he's not.
0553277472|1.0|The only reason to read this book would be to learn a lesson about avoiding anything that has been hyped too much. This book is not only boring and badly written, it is astonishingly hypocritical: the tone is smug, self-satsified, preaching, everything that Zen philosophy is opposed to! The narrator's painfully inept treatment of his intelligent, sensitive son is all too typical: he doesn't listen, and tries repeatedly to impose his own vision of the world and of what his son should be like on the poor boy. What is Quality, the narrator asks? Well, maybe treating your child as a human being with emotional needs has something to do with it.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Wow. I just saw Requiem For A Dream for the first time. I don't really know what to say about it. What a stunning film. Gorgeously filmed, beautiful visuals...wholly depressing...crystal clear filmmaking. Excellent performances by the cast. The story almost seems inconsequential somehow (even though it's not)...mostly, I felt like I was was watching a moving painting.<br />Ellen Burstyn's performance as the mother, a lonely widow whose hope of being on TV (so that her loser son and deceased husband would be proud of her) leads to an addiction to diet pills and a severe case of dementia, was one of the finest moments of acting I believe I've ever seen. <br />The film style itself employs a variety of different camera angles, split screens, and some truly beautiful juxtapositions. The scenes become darker, more jagged and frantic, as the movie progresses and the four main characters spiral steadily downward.<br />The music and the sound in this film is also extremely powerful. The popping of pill bottles, the quitly mocking laughter of the empty mailbox...those are the two sounds that really stick out for me. Then the music, the haunting background theme that plays nearly constantly over much of the film, will stick in your mind and haunt you long after the movie has ended.<br />I believe everyone I know that has seen this movie has loved it, and I have to say that despite its disturbing content, I really loved it too. That said, this is definitely one of those films that people will either love or hate...it's really not a middle-ground type of movie. It's truly an example of movies as an art form. As you can see from my first impressions of it there, first viewings of it seem to lend themselves more to the art of the filmmaking itself rather than the actual content of the movie...it was so clear cut that I don't think there's a lot left to 'understand', but at the same time, repeated viewings will likely be necessary just to let it sink in. <br />I resisted watchingit for a very long time because no one could tell me why they loved it so much and I had it in my head that it was going to be 'just another of those stupid drug movies'. I understand now why they couldn't explain it, and I only wish I could explain it myself. :) Unfortunately, I think I'm going to fall short of that wish tonight.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|After buying Mer de noms right after it came out I fell in love with APC.  Despite the change in members from the first album, this second has much of the same feel due to Billy and Maynard being the driving creative forces.  This album, however, doesn't seem to be as cohesive as Mer de noms and some of the songs seems to be out of place.  The better songs seems to be: Weak and Powerless, Blue (perhpaps my favorite on the whole album), and Pet.  The Package seems really out of place for me, and I often end up just skipping it and going to Weak and Powerless to start off the album.  Lullaby is also very strange is another skip track.  <br />On the whole I really like this album and would highly recommend it to anyone who liked Mer de Noms.  There are songs on here that fans of the old lineup will love, and I'm sure others will like other songs.  Either way, its well worth the money as everyone can find at least 4 songs they love.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Finally! A DVD chronicle of Led Zeppelin's famed Madison Square Garden, Knebworth and Albert Hall concerts has been released! And no, its not the disappointing hack job that The Song Remains the Same was (there are some editing errors...easily forgiven, however).<BR>Easily accessible to the rabid fan as well as the mildly interested listener, its stunning to watch, to hear and experience the great band that Led Zeppelin truly was from the earth-shakingly complex version of White Summer in the Gardens to the serene acoustic performances at Albert Hall to the bombastic beat of Achilles Last Stand at Knebworth, Jimmy, Robert, John Paul and the late great Bonzo make it work and then some.
0192853619|5.0|Philosophy of math under 200 pages!<br />If one expects a thorough course in basic math, this book may not be it - \\"Mathematics for the Million\\" by Lancelot Thomas Hogben should be your first choice.  Nor does this book have much to say about the historical development of mathematics - for this there is no substitute for Morris Kline's \\"Mathematics for the Non-Mathematician\\" (which teaches the basic concepts of math simultaneously, aided by exercises).<br />This book aims to convey, I think, a sense of what mathematical reasoning is like.  \\"If this book can be said to have a message, it is that one should learn to think abstractly, because by doing so many philosophical difficulties simply disappear,\\" writes Gowers in the Preface.  And at times it does feel as though you're reading a book written by a philosopher.  For instance, p. 80-81 discusses \\"What is the point of higher-dimensional geometry?\\"  (Of course Gowers is not a philosopher but a VERY distinguished mathematician.)<br />Incidentally, here's something that stumps me.  Gowers says \\"[t]here may not be any high-dimensional [i.e., more than three] space  lurking in the universe, but....\\"  But I thought higher-dimensional space is what superstring theory is all about.  And besides, Martin Rees, Andrei Linde and Alan Guth are now telling us there is an infinite number of universes outside our own, each taking a different number of dimensions - some fewer than three, others many more!  Higher-dimensional space may not be as abstract as Gowers thinks.  <br />Gowers's main point, however, is that higher dimensions have meaning and validity in mathematics quite independent of whether they are grounded in objective physical reality, or whether physicists use them or not.<br />This once again illustrates what Eugene Wigner called \\"the unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics.\\"  Mathematicians often develop concepts, like Riemannian geometry, n-dimension geometry (where n is over 20), etc., which are way ahead of developments in the empirical sciences, often without any idea whether they will become applicable to, say, physics.   Steven Weinberg puts it this way: It's as though Neil Armstrong when visiting the Moon found the footsteps left behind by Jules Verne.<br />Rare indeed is the distinguished physicist who does not hold mathematics and mathematicians in high regard.<br />I find this book very stimulating to read (though not always easy to understand - my fault no doubt).  It won't help you with school problems.  Nor will it help with daily life.  But it is deep and thought-provoking, explaining \\"just what IS mathematics?\\"<br />I have a minor point of disagreement over this sentence on p. 127: \\"Here is a rough and ready definition of a genius: somebody who can do easily, and at a young age, something that almost nobody else can do except after years of practice, if at all.\\"  This definition would seem to exclude some of the greatest scientists of all time:  Einstein, Max Planck (who was already middle-aged when he discovered the quantum), not to mention Darwin, Benjamin Franklin, Niels Bohr, even possibly Newton.  (It would exclude many non-scientific geniuses also, like Marlborough, who won the Battle of Blenheim at the ripe old age of 54.) <br />I pointed out to the author that his definition is actually appropriate for \\"prodigy\\" (and he seemed to agree).  Indeed his statement is a very succinct definition of \\"prodigy.\\"<br />Is this point worth discussing?  It wouldn't have been, were the concept \\"genius\\" not so often used among mathematicians - to describe one another (with good reasons).  I might add by the way that Gowers, a Fields Medallist, is a certified genius himself.  (Gowers told me he disagreed on both charges.)<br />On reflection, Gowers's definition is not so much wrong as too exclusive.  There are of course no simple ways to define \\"genius.\\"  Like \\"beauty,\\" \\"genius\\" may be in the eyes of the beholder only - we think we recognize it when we see it.   My feeling is that most prodigies are indeed geniuses - how else would you describe a six-year-old who understands trigonometry, or the 16-year-old who is a world champion in chess? - but many true geniuses are not and have not been prodigies when young. Einstein is one such example.  And Darwin another (even more so).  Perhaps Newton also.  <br />I suspect that Gowers's error comes from his experience as a mathematician: many great mathematicians are indeed mathematical prodigies as children.  (Think of John Von Neumann.)   This rule is less true outside mathematics - and the further away from mathematics, the less true it becomes.  Music is close to math for some reason - Mozart is an outstanding example - but war-making is obviously not.  (Napoleon, who was good at math, and rose from nothing to Emperor of France at age 34, might disagree on the latter point.  But then he later lost the war.)<br />Anyway, Gowers does say his definition is only \\"rough and ready,\\" not complete in itself.  This leaves room for other \\"definitions\\" of genius, as there indeed must be.  Surely prodigy is that special kind of genius which catches people's attention instantly, and has some mysterious \\"magic\\" to it, which Gowers rightl stresses is not a necessary quality for success in mathematics.  Von Neumann (always capitalized \\"V\\"), who mastered calculus by age 8, and went on to contribute to quantum mechanics, the Manhattan Project, the first mainframe computers (the \\"Von Neumann machines\\"), set theory, cybernetics, meteorology, the hydrogen bomb, and Game Theory, was a child prodigy with a photographic memory who fits Gowers's restrictive definition of genius - and indeed he was a genius by any definition.  But as Gowers emphasizes, you don't have to be a Von Neumann to be a productive mathematician.<br />The following are Contents: Preface, List of Diagrams, 1 Models, 2 Numbers and abstraction, 3 Proofs, 4 Limits and infinity, 5 Dimension, 6 Geometry, 7 Estimates and approximations, 8 Some FAQs, Further reading, Index.<br />I'm surprised that calculus is nowhere to be found in the Index (as is Newton).  If Gowers has discussed calculus in this book, I may have missed it.  (But then I am no genius.)  In any case a fuller discussion of calculus (and of Newtown) would seem desirable to me.<br />I can't think of a better book to carry around in your pocket than this. This book is outstanding.
B00009ATIX|2.0|There are spoilers in this review. This is kindof necessary, I'm afraid, as many of this movie's flaws are there. If for some reason you want to see it, don't read this. <br />I feel very strongly about Solyaris, Tarkovsky's version made in 1972. I consider it as the best movie I've ever seen. But I went into Solaris with an open mind. Unfortunately, Solaris is definitively an inferior and dumbed-down remake of Solyaris, despite claims to the contrary. The first half of Solaris is basically a fast-forward reworking of the first half of Solyaris. The second half is basically a composite of flashbacks and the new, grating plot that comes to the fore. <br />There are things that work but they are not part of any coherent context. For example, the relationship between Kelvin and Rheya (Hari in the original) is much more fleshed out. These scenes are real winners, but only highlight one of the main problems of this remake : it is trying to force a love story where none is possible. The whole plot of Kelvin and Rheya/Hari is predicated on the premise that Kelvin does *not* love her, or at least that their relationship is doomed. Otherwise, there would be no point in having Solaris invoke her as a source of guilt for Kelvin in the first place ! That Kelvin and Rheya have such a great relationship, only marred by one clash (due to Rheya's extreme stupidity - I will mention this later), only makes the premise even less likely. <br />The scene with a dream of Gibarian has perhaps the best original dialogue, but is nonsensical and relates to absolutely nothing. There are nice special effects of the station, the docking sequence, and Solaris itself. While I still think the original Solaris visual is better, the docking sequence is very good, and one thing the original lacked. But once again, they amount to very little and relate to very little. <br />The blatant racism. Oh dear. I'm sure that organo-centric people will disagree with me, but I consider this version extremely racist and offensive. I know that in Solyaris, Sartorius is also racist, in that he considers the Solaristic constructs as beings to be studied and nothing more. But at least he has a reason : he considers the Solaristic constructs as objects of scientific study, and to do so has decided to ignore their sentience. <br />Gordon (Sartorius' replacement in this version), on the other hand, has no such motive. She is Pure Evil (tm), the kind of foaming-at-the-mouth racist you only see in movies, and only desires to affirm the superiority of man over the \\"inferior\\" constructs (indeed, she says as much, which is very disturbing) and leave the station. But she is also a black woman, so I suppose all this must be forgotten. After all, minorities cannot be racist nazis. Right ? <br />Well, never mind. Even the director and producer are openly racist. As James Cameron says in the commentary, \\"when a girl is cute, whether she's made of subatomic particles or whatever, we still want to **** her\\", and that the acceptance of the woman by Kelvin is \\"a male thing\\". In the surprise ending, where we learn Snow is also a Solaristic construct, the two others look at him in disgust, and desire to kill him. <br />There is also the whole thing about Rheya/Hari. In Solyaris, we are not *told* that Hari is intelligent, we *see* it, and we also see her humanization process. \\"Show, not tell\\". Rheya in Solaris is *told* to us to be intelligent, but we don't *see* it, and she does not evolve at all. In fact, she is shown to be rather stupid in all instances. She is shown as a theist arguing against evolution, a pregnant woman who gets an abortion because her husband is an atheist (thru the kind of twisted and simplistic reasoning that only a fundamentalist Christian would invoke), and as a floozy who is barely aware of her own existence, basically worshipping the memories she was created from. <br />The ending is atrocious, creating gratuitous tension instead of exploring Snow's character, losingall surprise and gaining not only a standard Hollywood good ending but also a blatant religious symbolism. At the end, Snow announces that the weapon they have used to destroy the constructs has spent all the station's power, and that Solaris is expanding exponentially. This creates tension as Kelvin and Gordon escape, but the former changes his mind. So we know where he will end up. No suspense. And the end that seems to equate Solaris with God is, I'm afraid, completely confirmed by the director, in the commentary. Ironically, a story which is partly about how humans try futilely to reduce everything to themselves, spawned a movie which reduces the unknown to human myths. <br />Solaris keeps a relatively slow pacing (compared to Hollywood fare), but it has no brain. It tries to make Lem's story into a love story, when that is a contradiction. Lem's story is the antithesis of a love story. Adding the ideological stupidity of the movie, these are really, really bad cards that even Clooney's great acting, Jeremy Davies' highly enjoyable acting, and the great visuals cannot help. Sure, it's superior to standard Hollywood fare, and has a number of great scenes, but this is a total intellectual dead end. <br />Kelvin : \\"What does Solaris want from us ?\\" <BR>Gibarian : \\"Why do you think it has to want something ?\\"
B000099T2L|4.0|I had been waiting through ALL the release dates that had been issued for this CD until it FINALLY came out! I must say that I this disc wasn't what I expected, but it's nice. I really expected her to work with the BIG heads in music like R.Kelly,Missy,Babyface,JD....you get the idea. My favorite song is probably &quot;Dangerously In Love.&quot; I have the &quot;LIVE&quot; version of this song.Oh my GOD! Her voice is angelic! I also like &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;Signs,&quot; &amp; &quot;Speechless&quot; a lot! She is the total package! I didn't think nobody else could touch my soul the way Brandy does, but Ms.Beyonce' has done that. When she goes on tour, make sure you go. She really knows how to &quot;Work It Out!&quot;
0066214122|3.0|This book *should* keep you racing for the ending.  But then again, you've got nothing to show for the ride.  The ending is rather choppy and leaves the feeling of \\"Well?? And?\\"<br />The use of first person was a bad idea. For example, when the narrator is in danger, you know he has to live. Because there would be no book without the narrator, he has to survive.  That really cuts down on the suspense.<br />One thing that really annoyed me about Prey was the continuous way of explaining things that ordinary people not involved in biology/nanotechnology/genetic fields wouldn't know.  First, Jack (the narrator and pseudo-hero) has a little chat and speaks in indecipherable language for about a page and half.  Then another page and a half explains what the heck the two characters were talking about.  And so it continues: Dialogue-explain, dialouge-explain, etc. <br />The plot itself has huge holes and is very Stephen King-esque.  A mystery/horror/this-is-going-to-happen-someday-and-your-job-is-to-prevent-is prevalent throughout the novel.<br />OK, but not the best Crichton out there.
B00005JKHN|5.0|when i was a kid i saw &quot;sleeping beauty&quot; and i just realized that when i was that age, i thought the young prince was so cute and i would rewind that scene in my 4 disney videos per cassete and practically scratched it. Now, it brings flutters to my heart when i see Phillip as a dying teenager. (he was 4 or something when aurora was born and he must be around 20) The DVD has so much better clarity than the video but i could have done without all the extra doo-doo that took up an entire disc. Like a nasty techno remake of Aurora's &quot;once upon a dream&quot; where horrid teenage girls with the worst attitude ( you know what i am getting at) and color Aurora games!!! i personally, would have liked the meaning and intention Walt had for each scene then all this nonsensical rubbish. But this is definity an upgrade from my VHS -which i will keep for nostalgia-<BR>What i love most about hte story is the way that young prince looks at baby aurora like &quot;yuck!&quot; and then when he is in the bushes with Samson and has this wide grin that makes you smile as well, like &quot; i have found treasure!&quot; look. Then that scene when you realize the peasant boy is the prince and how romantic it all is. THen it is almost like a tragic Romeo and Juliet thing where he leaves just as Aurora is coming to the castle. Then that scene where he asks Samson to wish him luck right before that chilling scene which made me always check a room before entering. When she puts her head on his shoulder, and this is all fine because they had no one and felt they knew each other from their dreams! how he memorized her song and sung it to Hubert. That scene was funny where he says &quot;this is the fourteenth century&quot; and the king asks Samson if this really happened. Aurora is so beautiful and the Prince is undeniably handsome and that scene where Malificent is threatening Phillip with that aurora will not like him because he is old. It is so wonderful when in the end everythngis as it should be and this is not the type of movie that you muddle over with, &quot; if this happened, then maybe...&quot; Sleeping beauty is the kind of movie that makes you believe in destiny, fairies, strength, courage, but the thing that determines all this, it makes you believe in love.
055357342X|5.0|I don't read fantasy books, never had, never planned to... until now.  Last summer my friend begged me to read just one chapter of &quot;A Game of Thrones.&quot;  Five days later, there was no turning back.  My life is forever changed... sound crazy?  Ask anyone who has ever read the books.  I have entered a world I never knew existed, never could have imagined.  As I read on, I kept expecting at some point to be disappointed.  Needless to say, it never happened.  <br />By the third book, I felt as if I had come to know the characters in their own right.  Each chapter had me crying my eyes out at least one, and a couple moments later, giggling quietly to myself.  Sometimes, I would call the friend who lent the first one to me and yell that I was going to throw the book out the window because I couldn't take the pain anymore.  Other times I'd call her and thank her for making life worth living.  I read for five hours at a time without getting up from my seat.  During the night, I'd wake up crying about something that had happened in &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot; that day.  <br />Every character is developed.  No matter how much I hate them, I can't say that I don't understand them because it would be a lie.  Picking a favorite character is hard, I'd have to say Tyrion Lannister is without a doubt my favorite here.  First book... ahhh, he was ok, second, a[...] he is so sweet, third... OMG, I want to marry the man!  *coughs*  Anyway...<br />I guess through all my rambling I'm trying to explain something that is completely inexplicable.  My friend tried to do the same for me, but couldn't.  I never realized I could get so much enjoyment from a book.  Reading anything else seems extremely trivial now.  So, the truth is, I can't explain the journey you're about to embark on; all I can say is, &quot;It's gone be one heck of a ride!&quot;
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The first time I heard A Perfect Circle, they were opening for Nine Inch Nails before the release of their first album (Mer de Noms).  I had never heard of the band before, but as soon as I heard Maynard James Keenan's voice, I knew who it was.  He has one of the best voices in rock, and while it worked wonderfully for Tool, he really has expanded his range for A Perfect Circle.  The music of A Perfect Circle isn't as heavy as Tool; it's more melodic and straightforward, and in many ways just better.  This may seem like blasphemy to many Tool fans, but those diehard fans have probably already heard A Perfect Circle from their first album and made up their mind about them.  If you liked the first album, or if you just want a solid rock album in general, I highly recommend this one.
051788710X|5.0|It's very simple, really. This book changed my life. Robert Moss' basic rule of dream exploration is NEVER to let anybody tell you what your dreams mean. Such integrity is what has attracted me to the practice of Active Dreaming. <br />In Conscious Dreaming, Mr. Moss explains very clearly how to work with dreams and create one's Own dictionary of symbols. What's important to me might not be important to you. He delves appropriately into dreaming with the departed, and into precognitive dreaming - things that drew me to dream work to begin with. He illustrates in practical terms how we can return to night dreams in a waking state and look around some more - or possibly change things if we don't like them! Haven't we all had dreams that we wish we could have enjoyed for longer, or nightmares that we would change if we could? A dear friend used to have horrific nightmares. The kind that had him punching holes in the bedroom wall. Since he has read this book and been sharing his dreams using Robert Moss' Lightning Dreamwork process, his frequency of nightmares is Way down (1 or 2 per Year, rather than per Week). I asked him Why he feels this change has taken place. He replied \\"Because I'm finally paying attention and honoring my dreams!\\" To me, this is Healing at its most basic - SELF-Healing! The seeds of which are all very skillfully set forth in this one little book.<br />Mr. Moss now has a series of videos from Psyche Productions called &quot;The Way of the Dreamer&quot;. They expand beautifully on Conscious Dreaming, showing the history that brought the author to dream work, and depicting very clearly the practical applications of the principles illustrated in the book. And listening to Robert Moss speak is a remarkable experience in itself!<br />I have given this book to many friends over the years, and it's my sincere hope that everyone who reads it will begin to Pay Attention to their dreams!
B000089RVX|5.0|I like all types of music, but evanescence is my #1 favorite. I will tell you about all the songs on the list. I hope you enjoy..<br />1. Going Under: 5/5<BR>Going Under is one of the best songs on the album. Period. It's spooky, got a good beat, and the video is phenomenal. Great job on this song!<br />2. Bring Me To Life: 5/5<BR>This is a great song. It got me into the band, and it got everyone else, so this is the introduction. If so many people like evanescence and gave their overall average a 5/5, then why not give this song a five? It's got a great melody, great lyrics, fabulous song.<br />3. Everybody's Fool: 4.9999999999/5<BR>A song about reality and falseness of life. Good song, but not up to the five in my opinion.<br />4. My Immortal: 4/5:<BR>Another gothic song, but it's pretty good. I'm not too much of a fan for ballads.<br />5. Haunted: 3/5<BR>Least favorite on the album. The song is creepy, and I don't wanna listen to it. Lyrics are a little strange.<br />6. Tourniquet: 4.95/5<BR>This is a great song. It has a great intro, the vocal tempo keeps changing- it's just a great song. I don't think it's a 5/5, because the lyrics are a little weird. Great effort though!<br />7. Imaginary: 4/5<BR>Another great song. Don't really have much to say about it, but listen to it.<br />8. Taking Over Me: 5/5<BR>The lyrics are perfect in this song. It's a great song, highly recommended. You'll love this song.<br />9. Hello: 4/5<BR>I don't like this song that much. It's a little too gothic and ballady for my taste. It's my second least favorite on the album.<br />10. My Last Breath: 4.5/5<BR>Pretty good song. Wouldn't give it a 5/5, but it's still pretty good.<br />11. Whisper: 6/5<BR>Whisper is the best song on the album. It's so good I had to give it a 6/5. You'll love Whisper. It's got a great melody, great lyrics, it's a fabulous song, it's the best song on the album. The end is a little off, but that doesn't stop it from being the best song.<br />Overall, evanescence rules. The average doesn't come to 5/5, but it's 5/5 in my opinion. Buy this c.d. if you don't have it, you may love the whole album.
B00003CWL6|5.0|From the side-splittingly funny, inspiring, introspective script to the artful, rhythmic, steadily-paced cinematography to the innovative, minimalistic, percussion-driven score, American Beauty is a brilliantly-realized piece of theatre.<br />This movie has made an everlasting impression on me.  Some might argue it is because I've watched it 30+ times, but I beg to differ!  Not only is this one of the funniest movies I've ever watched, but it is also THE most inspiring and enlightening movie I've seen.  Here is an excerpt from the movie... I hope those who are reading this don't get mad at me.  It may spoil the impact of the seen a bit, so be forewarned.<br />&quot;It was one of those days where it's a minute away from snowing and there's this electricity in the air, you can almost hear it, right?  And this bag was just dancing with me.  Like a little kid begging me to play with it.  For fifteen minutes.  That's the day I realized there was this entire life behind things and this incredibly benevolent force that wanted me to know there was no reason to be afraid, ever.  A video's a poor excuse, I know, but it helps me remember... I need to remember.  Sometimes there's so much beauty in the world, I feel like I can't take it, and my heart is just going to cave in...&quot;<br />It's scenes like the above that are so original, so poignantly written, that I can't help but be in total awe of them.  <br />The score is, I don't even want to say a perfect complement, because as with any great score it seems to meld perfectly with the film and enhance and amplify, and perhaps even add to what is already there.  Thomas Newman has outdone himself.<br />I could analyse this film for hours.  All I can say is rent this, watch it -- then watch it again and look closer.

B00008973Q|5.0|Ran is one of the best films of the 80's and the culmination of Kurosawa's lengthy career. A vast tableau of color and epic pageantry, it is probably one of the last films that gets better with repeated viewings.<br />The dvd itself is at times awful, but the commentaries do help to ease the pain somewhat. I believe the Fox Lorber came with practically nothing...<br />While famous for the battle sequences including the attack on the third castle (the set cost $1.6 million and was made as an homage to silent films) the long &quot;boring&quot; moments are no less intense. While the quiet scenes are at first demanding, they soon prove themselves to be the key elements to the film being so full of intimation.<br />Mieko Harada is chilling as Lady Kaede, brimming with evil while using the most minimal amount of physical movement. Her few violent outbursts are all the more intense after such formal restraint. Her handling of the two Ichimonji sons is fascinating,<BR>from merely suggestive with the eldest, Taro (in a too brief performance by Akira Terao) to physical and emotional seduction with the second son, Jiro (played by Jinpachi Nezu). <br />As  Kurogane, Hisashi Igawa gives a wonderful commanding performance as Jiro's aid, vainly trying to keep his Lord focused on the responsiblities of subduing his kingdom. His strength lies in his submissiveness to his duty: He obviously is better leadership material then Jiro, but his devotion to the kingdom is more important to him than personal gain. The scenes between him and Harada are the strongest in the film, and while the final beheading isn't all that realistic, it is effective.<br />His alter-ego Tango, played by former sporting goods store owner Masayuki Yui (who auditioned for Kagemusha after reading an ad in the paper looking for extras and ended up with a key role!) is equally devoted, more so to Hidetora and Saburo than to an empire.<br />Kyoami, the court jester, is played flamboyantly by Peter, who was famous forcross dressing roles (as was Tom Hanks).<br />Tatsuya Nakadai, a longtime Kurosawa cast member gives an over the top theatrical performance as old Hidetora. His makeup was designed after masks in the Noh tradition, first as an evil spirit, then later as a condemned wandering spirit. While not to everyones taste, it is a memorable performance nonetheless.<br />With some patience and an open mind, Ran will continually reveal its vast and intrically nihilistic textures  more and more through repeated viewings and firmly cement itself as one of the greatest Kurosawa masterpieces.  Catered to Americans my ...!

B000002UE9|3.0|Up there with Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, and other bands of the era, Poison helped create the greatest decade of rock music ever made.  Although not the best Poison album Open Up and Say ...AHH! is still a worthwhile purchase.  Their most covered song by pub bands Every Rose Has It's Thorn, a slow love ballad is on this album which most people either love or hate.  The other huge hit Nothin' But A Good Time, on this album is a sensational rock song.  Most of the other songs on here are pretty good too.  I would also recommend buying their album Flesh & Blood as well for sensational songs like Unskinny Bop.<br />If you like Bon Jovi, Def Leppard, AC/DC and similar bands then you have to listen to Poison as well.  The cover booklet also contains lyrics and photographs of the band.
630280082X|5.0|...even though it's far from a perfect movie. So why the 5 stars? Because it's so unique, so bold, so unconventional, and so ultimately pleasing. Crossroads is a fun fairy tale that uses an accurate history lesson as its back drop. (i.e., the kind of fim the just don't make anymore.) Not to mention it has some of the best music you'll hear in a movie. And if you're a musician, and especially a guitar player, it's simply a MUST! The plot and performances have already been reviewed but I'd like to add that Macchios &quot;less than confident&quot; portrayal fits perfectly with the character. The biggest flaw is the horrible miscasting of Steve Vai as the resident hot shot blues man. Vai is in no way or form a blues guitarist and would never be accepted as such,  and his poser/over the top performance at the end ruins an otherwise classic film moment. I always felt that Johnny Winter would have been the perfect choice for that role and they  should have left Steve to do the soundtrack for the electric classical guitar pieces. The bit with the &quot;selling the soul to the devil&quot; was a little forced as well. All in all, Crossroads is is an uneven masterpiece. Try to overlook the bad, appreciate the good and thank all concerned for at least attempting to bring the beauty of some wonderful music to the publics conciousness.   Not to mention you'll thoroughly enjoy watching it. This is one of very few films I actually hated to see end.

B000002H6C|5.0|It's too bad that Metallica is now associated with the Napster debacle and excreble trash such as Load and St. Anger, because at one point they were underground metal masters pumping out thrash gems like Ride The Lightning, Master Of Puppets, and this. Easily a Holy Metal Triumvirate if there ever was one.<br />..And Justice For All, released after the unfortunate death of brilliant bassist Cliff Burton, is the most epic and complex effort from Metallica to date. With the exception of the pummeling Dyers Eve, you won't find much cave-your-head-in hyper thrash. What you will find, however, is brilliantly dynamic progressive metal, embracing lots of tempo and riff changes. The lyrics are some of the best the band has ever put out, addressing the issue of justice and the abuses thereof.<br />So, why does this album get rated lower than the perennial classics Ride The Lightning and Master Of Puppets? For one thing, Jason Newsted's bass is completely removed (!), making this album sound a bit too thin. For another thing, fans take exception to the fact that the brilliant war ballad One made it to MTV video rotation. The first issue can be overlooked, and the second issue is just moronic. I for one am glad One made it to MTV--how often does something this progressive, heavy, and intelligent make it into the overcommercialized, soulless and bland popular music market? Definitely a far cry from Frantic, or even Enter Sandman, if you get my drift.<br />Moving on, there is so much good material here despite the somewhat lacking production. The Newsted-penned Blackened is a great opener, and a riff monster. The title track is an incredible epic, One is the chilling tale of a crippled Vietnam vet longing for his own demise, Harvester Of Sorrow is a crushing dirge, and To Live Is To Die is an emotional instrumental featuring a bit of poetry from the deceased Cliff. The album ends in the tradition of Damage Inc. with the raging thrash of Dyers Eve.<br />This is an absolutely essential Metallica album, and the complete opposite of what was to come with the Black Album in 1991. Buy this along with Master Of Puppets and Ride The Lightning, and prepare to blow your speakers. Oh, and buy St. Anger too. I hear it makes a very attractive coaster.y essential Metallica album, and the complete opposite of what was to come with the Black Album in 1991.

B000024D4R|5.0|Animals, the fifth album in the unstoppable series of 1970's Pink Floyd recordings, is oft-overlooked by the general public. Which is a shame, because this is both Roger Water's best lyrical effort (in my opinion) and a showcase for David Gilmour's finest guitar work. This 1977 album sees the whole band working together, which would not be seen again in the years to come with The Wall and The Final Cut.<br />This is Pink Floyd's angriest album and one of their most political, eschewing the spacey melancholy of Wish You Were Here for more minimalist, discordant textures. It is lyrically patterned around George Orwell's classic political novel Animal Farm (if you haven't read it GO READ IT RIGHT NOW!). Tycoons and corporate bigwigs represent the \\"Pigs,\\" yuppies and relentless social climbers are the \\"Dogs,\\" and the meek and dogmatic followers are the \\"Sheep.\\" There is one song dedicated to each character sketch, and each is lyrically savage. Waters is in incredible form here, spitting out such lines as \\"You radiate cold shafts of broken glass,\\" \\"You believe at heart, everyone's a killer,\\" and \\"Ha, ha, charade you are.\\" Classic.<br />But enough about that. What is REALLY impressive about this album is how such long songs--17 minutes for Dogs, 12 minutes for Pigs (Three Different Ones), and 10 minutes for Sheep--manage to feel like five minutes. This is due to the band's remarkable performance. Waters' moody basslines carry the song, while Richard Wright's perfectly placed keyboards add atmosphere and Nick Mason keeps the pace steady. This leaves the mighty guitarist David Gilmour to cut loose with some of his most edgy, emotional work. Whether it be eerie floating chords, clever animal-sound talkboxing, or dry runs for Comfortably Numb (see the spine-tingling coda of Pigs), Gilmour is absolutely inspired and never bores me despite the extremely progressive song lengths. The album is nicely bookended by a 2-part short acoustic ballad Pigs On The Wing, which is performed solely by Waters.<br />What makes Animals even more remarkable is that so few people have heard it. Every fan of Pink Floyd should have this release. Although some of the political references are a bit dated (one lyric makes reference to Mary Whitehouse, sort of an English Tipper Gore) few of 1977's punk albums contain the same level of articulate anger. If you're new to Pink Floyd, start with Dark Side Of The Moon and Wish You Were Here, but once you are ready to get your mind blown, pick Animals up.med solely by Waters. <br />What makes Animals even more remarkable is that so few people have heard it.

B00009V7RF|1.0|Gee, I can't give this ZERO stars. I'd like to though.    Where is the love? BEP slams all types of hatred and discrimination in their one hit from this lame CD, but then they decide it's OK to make fun of people with disabilities on \\"Let's Get Retarded\\". That's just plain disgusting. Tell ya what, boyz...come on over to my house and sing it for my developmentally disabled son. Then tell his sister that you don't mean anything offensive by it. Then try to sleep at night with a clear conscience.    Jerks.
B00007BK2N|4.0|This is a fantastic film by British director Michael Winterbottom which explores the history of England's post-punk Factory Records through the hilarious perspective of its founder Tony Wilson.  True, your enjoyment of the film will be greatly enhanced if you are/were a fan of Joy Division (the band that became New Order) or the Happy Mondays (the band that seemed to accidentally invent techno and the rave generation), but even for the unannointed, the film is painfully (and humorously) honest, filled with self-depricating wit, and a must-see for those eager to explore low-budget, Dogme 95-esque video-filmmaking.  Winterbottom may not be as devoted to the craft and cinematic grammar of directing as he is to capturing the tone and emotion of the story, but this lopsidedness actually seems to enhance the film, which feels as if it was made during the anything-goes moment of post-punk and MTV.
B00005JLTN|4.0|What's all the fuss about? This movie is excellent. The complaints about the first half hour of the movie need to stop. Agreed, there is little action, but that's exactly what makes the action in the rest of the movie so much greater.<br />Yes, the Wachowski brothers wrote these series of movies as a TRILOGY! It isn't as if their writing skills turned to mush after they wrote a first movie, and they were pressed for ideas. It's the same directing skills that we have loved ever since the movie 'Bound' was released. <br />The movie carries an amount of sub-plots and twists that will keep you at the edge of your seat and like always, wanting more action. In addition, the special effects, choreographed fight scenes, and a soundtrack feautring music by Don Davis and Juno Reactor all come together in a beautiful masterpiece that is made for DVD.<br />Despite what all the critics of this movie may tell you, they will be there on opening night to see 'Matrix: Revolutions' when it is released.<br />Keep up the good work Andy and Larry!
0380789035|5.0|I gave this book five stars, but then, I have always been a sucker for mythology. If you don't think that myths are the greatest thing since sliced bread, don't even bother. If you are not interested in gods, goddesses, deities, etc--and, I have to admit, unless you have some very basic background in mythology, particularly in Nordic myths--you will likely get lost in it.<br />This is how it goes: two days before Shadow is set to get out of prison, he is told that his beloved wife, Laura, has been killed in a car accident. Flying home for her funeral, Shadow meets Wednesday, who invites him to work for him--and does not truly take \\"no\\" for an answer. Eventually, Shadow accepts and begins following Wednesday around the country, running his errands and witnessing a number of bizarre meetings. Wednesday, on his part, is on a mission to gather up the support of various American Gods (i.e. European pagan deities, Asian gods, Nordic ones, Slavic ones, Indian ones...) in the incoming fight against the gods of the new age, the gods of technology. In the meantime, Shadow's late wife Laura is not so late... as of late, and quite desirous of seeing her beloved husband safe through Wednesday's tangled web of activities. And so on, and so forth.<br />Long, long book. Good book. Well-written, wittily and sexily--but that's Gaiman for you. Excellent book. That said, let me repeat my earlier warning: don't read it if you don't like myths. You will never get through it. On the other hand, if you DO like myths, this is the book for you--I learned a TON of new mythology information from it. Not to mention how great it feels when you actually recognize a god in whatever makeup he's wearing.
B000089RVX|5.0|If you honestly want an excellent duet with a female singer, this is what you want. Amy Lee, the vocalist in this band, truly pushes herself to the limits in her second album. All the songs on this album keep you wanting to listen to it over and over again. She shows many different emotions through her lyrics, and the music backs it up with full force. Even if you're not into &quot;girl groups&quot; or &quot;new-fangled modern music&quot;, this album screams to be heard by people of all ages. The tracks flow very nicely into one another, and the whole album seems to paint a story.
1400034779|5.0|This book is thoroughly cute--in a simple, homey way. Not exactly a mystery, but rather, a chronicle of the activities of a private detective, complete with fascinating information on Africa, the book is refreshingly different from your average mystery. Mma Ramotswe is just a lovely character--a smart, no-nonsense fat woman who isn't ashamed of being nosy and who starts the No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency. She goes from case to case, helping people, making liars confess, tracking cheating husbands, wayward daughters, and, in one particular case, a fake Daddy. The book is witty and beautifully written in a simple, very readable, flowing prose. I could hardly put it down.
B00009TB5G|5.0|Yes, the title says \\"Countdown to November\\", not December, when the \\"Return of the King\\" finally hits the big screens, but November, when fans of the Lord of the Rings trilogy can get their hands on \\"The Two Towers: Special Extended Edition\\", the entire movie that includes over forty minutes of extra film footage included in the theatrical release version. Many may think this review is not helpful (mostly because its being written before the Special Edition is for sale), but its here because many people are buying the standard theatrical version, seemingly without realising that a better and bigger edition is on its way. The 'sneak preview' for the Extended Edition - or the advertisment for it, if you prefer - can be seen on the theatrical release DVD, just as the the Extended 'Fellowship' preview was on last year's DVD, and if you fell into the trap of having to buy two DVDs in 2002, then don't let it happen again with \\"The Two Towers\\"!<br />My suggestion is to rent the theatrical release, in order to enjoy the movie and the special features, including trailors, interviews, music videos, and previews of both the Return of the King and the Extended Edition. This should whet your appetite and anticipation long enough for November, when you can purchase the four-disc set with all its extra goodies. The only reason I'm writing this warning is that my father almost brought the theatrical release DVD, but was very relieved afterwards when I warned him and we ended up renting it, wherein he saw the preview for the Extended Edition. His exact words were: \\"I would have been so annoyed if I had brought this version!\\"<br />For those who don't already know, the Extended Edition is set to be excellent. The \\"Fellowship\\" Extended cut had only thirty minutes of extra footage - here we get forty! Included in the cut (and this information is taken from the DVD preview and many internet sources) are:<br />* Merry and Pippen growing taller due to Treebeard's Ent-draughts.<br />* the stunning and elabourate funeral of Theoden's son Theodred.<br />* a pivotal 'flashback' scene between Boromir, Faramir and their father Denethor in Osgiliath, which clearly shows the somewhat strained family dynamic, and may help to make Faramir's motives in forcefully taking Frodo and the Ring to his city more sympathetic.<br />* Saruman looking over a book that identifies Aragorn as the \\"Lost King of Gondor\\"<br />* Frodo, Sam and Gollum escaping from Osgiliath via the sewers<br />* Merry, Pippen and Treebeard exploring the ruins of Isengard (and finding its larder!)<br />* The Ents (or was in the Huorns? - sorry, I can't recall) rounding up the last of the orcs on the borders of Helm's Deep.<br />* Eomer finding his cousin wounded in the orc ambush<br />* Gandalf and Aragorn discussing his fate<br />* Sam and Frodo using Galadriel's elvish rope to scale a cliff-face<br />* Aragorn taming the deceased Theodred's horse Brego and releasing him into the wild (yes, that's the horse that rescues him after he falls off the cliff)<br />* Legolas and Gimli sitting amoungst the dead orcs outside Helm's Deep after the battle.<br />* Aragorn reluctantly swallowing a stew that Eowyn has dished up.<br />* Faramir finding the boat containing Boromir's body and the Horn of Gondor cloven in two.<br />* More Aragorn and Arwen love scenes (*rolls eyes*)<br />These are the main ones, to the best of my memory, but certainly not the only ones - there should be more dialouge inserted into already existing conversation, more battle scenes, and of course added music composed by Howard Shore.

0679777547|5.0|[A tiny point in the beginning: please do not judge this book by the substandard movie that came out a few years back! It is far better crafted and more interesting...]<br />But here, I said it: I liked this book so much, at least in part, because I used to looooooooooooove Alexandre Dumas-pere's books and know my musketeers by heart. So here's a piece of advice: before reading The Club Dumas, read The Three Musketeers, at least in abridged edition (ugh!), to get what the author is getting on with one of the plot lines. <br />That said, there are two--but you do not know it, until the very end. All through the book, the author has you chasing the wrong hare--only to step aside in the very end and say that this particular hare had nothing to do with all the blood-letting going on in the book (and it is considerable). In the very beginning, the very cool book-hunter Lucas Corso is told about two books: a hand-written chapter from the Three Musketeers written in Dumas' own hand--and a book supposedly written by the Devil (its printer, too, was burned at the stake). ONly three copies survive, with notable differences. Corso is ordered to retrieve the chapter from someone who had bought it, and to figure out which copy of the Devil's book is the genuine one. From then on, an absolutely wild ride ensues. The author manages a masterful deception of Corso--and the reader, has you looking the other way all through the book. <br />This is absolutely one of the best mysteries I have ever read. One little nitpick (not enough to take away a star)--a hugely important twist is barely discussed in the very beginning, just before it's stuck in the very end--basically, to explain the whole story. It makes sense, of course, but Corso's reasoning in arriving at the important conclusion is not given--and the story loses a bit for that... <br />But other than that, it is an absolutely fantastic mystery. I think all who have read will agree: better the Devil you know--if it's anything like the Devil Corso knows.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I hate being a sucker for the networks. They air a show with some originality, with snappy writing and good acting, and cancel it after I've fallen in love with it. It seems like the kiss of death every time I watch a new show. I've learned to skip the first season and catch the reruns during summer if it survives. I rarely put myself out for unknown TV series anymore--I've been hurt, y'know? But FIREFLY was different. Firstly, it was the brainchild of Joss Whedon, the genius behind BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER. Secondly, I can't resist the temptation of a good science fiction show. And thirdly, it was a SF/Western hybrid show airing on Friday night on FOX (i.e. the timeslot o' death)--there was little chance of survival even to the end of the season. I watched from the first episode on, knowing I was probably going to get burned and not caring, just wanting something interesting and entertaining from the brain of Joss Whedon. How was I to know I was going to fall in love? And fall harder and more painfully than I've fallen in a long time--with the bruises to show for it? <br />FIREFLY's strengths are obvious: the writing, the cast and the concept.<br />The writing is pure Jossian goodness. Joss Whedon is a funny, funny man, and the show never lacked for a sort of character-driven, quirky, graceful humor. Beyond that there is the subtlety of the character development (this is SF where the characters are the showpiece, and not the tech or ideas!) and the able use of emotional power. \\"Out of Gas\\" was one of the best hours of TV I've seen in years, and I include THE SOPRANOS and everything else on HBO. It was beautifully structured and emotionally powerful. The whole episode had a plangent ache to it, portraying death unlike most of TV. Death isn't about killing--it's random, it's cold and it's solitary. One of the characters says that everybody dies alone, and this episode doesn't just spout such philosophy, it proves the words with a punch to the gut.<br />The cast was perfect. Adam Baldwin as Jayne, the mercenary with more firepower than brainpower, was my favorite. He was a simple, hulking, menacing idiot of a man, but he also was a human being with needs and instincts of a kind. Nathan Fillion as Mal, the cynical Independent captain, had these purely lovely line readings that made me adore him. How can a girl resist a man with cynical eyes, floppy brown hair and a voice made for sardonic irony? Who could take a character that comes from such a venerable archetype (think Humphrey Bogart as the rebel who professes not to care but actually does) and make it feel fresh and living? Sean Maher as Simon--a smallish role so far, but he played the doctor with a sad sort of hesitancy that felt unshowy and real. Morena Baccarin as Inara the space prostitute, had the hardest job. Not the most screen time but she made the role bearable by playing the honored and distinguished prostitute with an unruffled serenity (all in her eyes). Alan Tudyk as Wash, the pilot, got the funny lines and had the comedic chops to make them funny onscreen. And Gina Torres, as Zoe, the captain's formidable righthand woman, just plain rocked. Her face, her reticence, her little twitch of an eyebrow, told a person that she could kill you with her bare hands in ten seconds flat if there was cause to be any killing. She was lethal, sarcastic without words and utterly cool.<br />The concept was the clincher for me. So much of science fiction relies on the crutches of aliens and unbelievably advanced technology, in fantastical invention, while the quiet and complicated human stories are left ignored. FIREFLY had a coherent vision of the messy future human beings have fashioned for themselves. The Alliance is the Big Brother-like central government controlling the high tech worlds. The fringe worlds are peopled by settlers, colonists as likely to use a horse as a hover train, scraping a living from the dirt. Tech use varies from planet to planet, as do cultural customs.All the dialogue is in English peppered with Mandarin phrases. Politics has created strange patterns of human settlement and resentment. This future is a result of people, ordinary and great, who lived and desired and created. Nothing is simple. There was a Civil War, with the Browncoats (Independents) fighting the encroachment of the Alliance, a centralized government seeking to unite all of humanity under one umbrella rule. The Alliance won, Mal and Zoe (Browncoat soldiers) lost, and now they have a ship, Serenity, Firefly class, doing odd jobs. The world-building had actual thought in it, much more like serious SF novel than a typical TV show.<br />The saddest fact about the show's cancellation for me was the wasted promise. They aired twelve hours, and the DVD has three more episodes. There are a handful of great episodes (\\"Serenity,\\" \\"Out of Gas\\" and \\"Ariel\\" are all amazing), and the rest are nothing less than entertaining. The show was just finding its feet. There were plot threads left dangling. There were stillborn romances barely out of the flirtation stages--and as any viewer of BtVS knows, Whedon is a master hand at breaking your heart. The world building was thorough but not complete. When the final decision came down to cancel the show, I was honestly too angry to be sad. It was an obscene waste, to stop this amazing story right in the middle.<br />Thank God for this DVD set. Buy this, support Joss and the studio. It's stuffed with extras: a gagreel, EIGHT audio commentaries, deleted scenes, Joss singing the theme song. And thank God for the movie: a feature film on the big screen and the hope of resolution.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|Released in 1978, John Carpenter's Halloween was shot in 21 days and on a low budget but somehow, the filmmakers were able to pull off an effective movie. What makes this movie work so well is that it's very simple but proves that simplicity can work if it's done the right way. This was a very ambitous film despite the budget it was made on. It's visual style is filled with class and very detailed. The direction and cinematography is some of the most haunting I've ever seen in movies. It never feels like a low budget movie in my mind, director John Carpenter truly cared about the camera and how it was going to tell the story and he also used the anamorphic wide screen, that and Dean Cundey's lighting give the film a very timeless feel. Most low budget movies that were released in the late 60s and 70s are grainy and have a more documentary like feel but Halloween is truly more cinematic.<br /><br />It is now considered a classic and also the film that launched the slasher films of the 80s. It's become so iconic that it's hard to imagine it being scary anymore. It was the highest grossing independent film in its day. I look back at this movie now and even myself wonder why is it so good. What was it about this movie that made it become the classic that it is now? I can understand why some may not like this movie, I reccommend looking at it from a visual standpoint and maybe you will like it but if not then you may be dissapointed.<br /><br />The film launched 7 sequels (all of which I consider to be good films). Maybe I am taking it too far by saying this is my favorite movie but it truly is. It never looses it's power and it reminds me of why I love movies to begin with. It's a great film because it works for what it is, a horror movie. Halloween 2, released in 1981 is equally as good I think. The rest of the series was very well done also.
B00005JKZU|5.0|WOW!And I thought the FOTR was good!!!!!!!!!!!!This is the best sequal EVER made!The acting,visual effects,direction,everything is so mucher better than the first(well,except for maybe the story.I think the first one had a better story).They made a few changes from the book,but it is still an enjoyable movie.I can't wait for The Return of The King on December 17.See this,but see the first one first because you wiil be REALLY confused if you don't.A must see!!!!!
0684833395|5.0|If you like Seinfeld and the Movie Pulp-Fiction you will love the jumbled plot and crazy characters of this book.  Highly recommended, I've read the book several times and it still amuses me!
B00006ZCFH|4.0|This hot new one from badu takes a different turn compared to her other cds by only coming off as an Ep instead of an LP. This is one of the things that kept me from giving it 5 stars. I think this album could have been pushed to an Ep becasue it leaves you wanting more. The single \\"Danger\\" is easily one of the hottest tracks on the album. If you have a good system turn it up and see what I mean. This time around i think it was all about the groove and flow instead of lyrics and she says that on every interview I have seen. Anyone expecting the deep content of \\"mama's gun\\" should relax and approach it as \\"listen and see\\". Musically every track is on point but lyrically \\"Danger\\" is the deepest thing here. Best tracks are:<br />*Danger<BR>*I want you<BR>*Back in the day<BR>*Love of my life worldwide<br />Overall, Eryka gave you something musically this time around. Since there were few tracks this time around it leaves you open for more. All fans should pick this up and non-fans give it a listen. If you liked the song \\"Love of my life\\" you will like this. Maybe next time around Eryka will give us everything musically and lyrically with a LP instead. For now this will have to hold us over.<br />Get it!
B000002L68|5.0|Without a doubt, this was the best album released in 1984.   This album came on with a storm.   Whether you consider it a soundtrack to an outstanding movie or whether you stand the album of its own, nobody cannot deny that this album was a mega-impact. In the summer of 1984, &quot;When Doves Cry&quot; was released and became a smash hit.   Then the promos for the movie Purple Rain hit the airwaves and suddenly this album and movie built momentum.   But a hit album doesn't always translate into quality - but in this case it does.<br />Prince was a nice R&amp;B/funk artist in the early 80s who really was the architect of what was the &quot;Minneapolis Sound&quot;.  On this album, he brought back shades of Jimi Hendrix, yet Prince did it on his own merit.   He was backed by a superb set of musicians in their own right - &quot;The Revolution&quot; and put out an album that even got many die-hard Rock and Roll fans to take notice.  Not many artists who cross-over can take it to the degree that Purple Rain did.<br />Lets Go Crazy is a song that can make your heart race.  It has an edge and an excitement to it.  The end of the song was often cut out on Top 40 radio, but features a high energy guitar solo that really makes the song in a class by itself.  It would be a #1 hit for Prince.<br />Take Me With U was a song that did crack the Top 40.  It's a shame because it is one of the great duets in music history.  Its a short song in which Prince and Apollonia exchange lead vocals.  What is a shame is that it is short and as a result often makes you want to hear more.<br />The Beautiful Ones is intense.  If you saw the movie, it is a song that reaches to the core of a Triangle that forms between Prince, Apollonia and Morris Day.  This song describes a love triangle.  Great keyboards and the last 1/3 of the song is one of the most intense vocal and instrumental pieces you will hear anywhere.  Prince has a scream-like voice at the end, but hits it perfect.<br />Computer Blue and Darling Nikki are the weaker tracks of the album.  I never was a big fan of them, but they did have a big following among Prince fans.  Darling Nikki does have the famous backwards vocals at the end of the song that always invoked controversy on what they really meant.  The album is still very strong even though I didn't care for these 2 tracks.<br />When Doves Cry was the first #1 single off this album.  This song has its place in music history but was a victim of Top 40 radio trying to play too many songs in an hour - the ending sequence to this song is simply outstanding.  It features some  great instrumentals and really is a song to groove to.  This song is a masterful song from a musical and lyrical sense as well.<br />I Would Die 4 U and Baby I'm a Star are two songs joined at the hip.  I would never play one without the other.  These two songs are bridged perfectly even though the songs are two completely separate songs.  However its very hard to listen to I Would Die 4 U without launching into Baby I'm a Star at the ending.  Same holds true for Baby I'm a Star, its hard to listen to the start of that song without hearing I Would Die 4 U finish up.<br />Purple Rain is so much more than a ballad.   The instrumentation is incredible on this final track.  It has a 3-dimensional sound to it.  You can almost feel that you are sitting right at the First Avenue Club in Minneapolis feeling smoke from the stage.   The ending is often cut on the radio - it is this beautiful 2 minute wind-down. It's a rather long song, but not one to bore you.<br />All in all, its Prince's best work and he never approached anything at this level again.   If you never saw the movie, this album still stands on its own and goes far and beyond being just a movie soundtrack.
B00005JLSE|1.0|Sure hollywood needs to slap itself on the back and give itself credit when it can come up with something besides Daredevil, Gigli and movies which end with numeric digits after their title. So bring on the Musical! Never mind that there's no script, no story ... and really the music isnt very good. Best Costumes? maybe..what are we supposed to compare it against - The Hulk?
B00000099Y|5.0|I just think it is amazingly funny to see people write bad reviews of a cd that they just couldn't understand. If you had any intelligence at all you would be able see how truely amazing tool actually is. They are different from all of the rest, so go ahead and keep on listening to all the bands that MTV tells you to and you'll be happy. Try doing some research on what they are saying in their songs, there is a lot more to it than you actually think. TRY AND READ BETWEEN THE LINES!!
B000000WF9|5.0|Michael Nyman is a genius.  I don't really know if anything else needs to be said.  His skill in creating tracks that so perfectly reflect the mood of the subject is nearly without equal.  In particular on this album, I like the theme, which is Morrow, and it's used as a basis for other tracks on the disc, my favorite being The Other Side.  The power of the music in Morrow is great, but The Other Side is just breathtaking.  A great soundtrack from a great movie.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|At first I didn't know what to think about this album.  By the second time I listened to it I fell in love with all the songs.  Each song has its own uniqueness.  Everytime you listen to this album each song grows on you.  It's different then the first album, but that's what you get with true musicians.  A Perfect Circle is not going to put out something that sounds just like the last album.... This album is very powerful, I can't stop listening to it.
B00004RFCM|4.0|Friends raved so about this show, so I finally borrowed the season 1 DVD. To be honest, I didn't find it as funny as I expected, and much raunchier than I expected. I should've known by the title, but I was shocked by the potty language and the non-stop sex. The behind-the-scenes interviews were interesting, but I found it incredible that they think this show is representative of real women -- not me or the women I know! Still, I enjoyed the funny parts and the close friendship among the women and kept watching to see if the women would get more realistic.<br />Be warned: It's definitely R rated and not to be watched with young ones around!
B00008NRI8|1.0|I am a fan of Hugh Grant especially for the comedy movies Nine Months, Notting Hill and 3 Weddings and 1 Funeral. I also liked Sandra Bullock in movies like The Net, While you were sleeping for her excellent performances. So, with great expectations I wanted to see this so called comedy but it was a total disappointment. The movie was so boring that I could not even finish it. The actors look ordinary, the story looks ordinary and so the treatment. A total waste. The stardom is wasted and so is our time too.<br />Was the movie taken it two weeks?
6305897786|5.0|When you look at the average rating for this film you will probably think it is a dud that is not even worth a rent. Well I beg you to take a look at this film. Johnny Depp and Roman Polanski team up for this eerie tale concerning the occult and satanism, and... books. This might not seem exciting, but Polanski's signature syle and Depp's dead-pan delivery drive the action-depleted plot. The pace starts off slow and gradually builds into an intense piece of cinema. I will not go into plot details, since the other reviews will most likey cover it extensively, however I will say that this is NOT and action or horror film. The film is not filled with explosions, shootouts, and car chases. While I believe this is one of the best films in recent history, this is definately not a movie everyone can enjoy.
B00003CX8U|5.0|wow, this is one of the greatest films i've ever seen. simply fantastic and wonderful. i think that the recent hyped 'chicago' was somewhat and somehow miserably copied or at least stole lot of its lousy settings from this wonderful film. i would never imagine that roy scheider could be this good. he should get an oscar from this. and suppose this ' all that jazz' was competing with that lousy and boring 'chicago' from all the same oscar categories? mymymy, a movie about new york broadway showbiz should be and must be like 'all that jazz'. it should be the bible of this genre. another good dancing movie is the 'center stage' if you didn't watch it yet, get it, hombre.
B00008JLKL|5.0|I was just at Borders bookstore today. I wanted to spend some of my birthday money I recently received in the mail. One of the two cds I bought today were the new cd by The Raveonettes and the other cd was the new Era cd &quot;Mass&quot;. I listened to a sample of the &quot;Mass&quot; and was automatically hooked. Although predictable, I loved the use of &quot;O Fortuna&quot; on the title track &quot;The Mass&quot;. Sure &quot;O Fortuna&quot; has been either covered (Opera Babes) or sampled (Enigma) but I can never tire of that song and I thought Era did a marvelous job of re-working it. I found myself truly moved by the vocals Lena Linnegren. I was even almost to tears by the gorgeous melodies and the haunting lyrics. It was the song &quot;Don't You Forget&quot; that convinced me to get this cd. I almost got Era's second album but after hearing &quot;Don't You Forget&quot;, I opted for &quot;The Mass&quot;. The children's conversation on the song really moved me. I am glad that I bought the cd. This is the most beautiful new age music I have heard in a long time. &quot;Looking For Something&quot; and &quot;Don't Go Away&quot; are also two very powerful songs that I enjoyed immensely. I guess if there was a flaw with the cd, I guess I would have to say that it was only 39 minutes, a bit too short. Still as I always say, I would rather have a very short cd of high quality music than a cd that is too long with mediocre material. I haven't really been into new age music for the past couple of years but &quot;The Mass&quot; has really made me rediscover what I love new age music so much. All the songs on this cd were great. There was not one song on this cd that I did not like. The production value of this cd was top-notched. I will most certainly be looking to other cds by ERA in the near future. &quot;The Mass&quot; has converted me into a fan.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Brilliant follow up CD -  Beautiful Music that flows like soft water down a lonely creek. Their debut album was a great CD but they clearly take their sound and music to a much higher level on Thirteenth Step. If you are looking for Tool - break out your Lateralus because this CD takes a different direction from the heavy industrial guitar driven sound of Tool and engages the listener with intricate melodies and mellow ambience sprinkled with agression only when necessary. The listener must play this CD on a  quality sound system or risk missing the depth and interaction of the high end percussion, vocals and bass. If you are a follower of Tool and APC - you will appreciate this brilliant piece of work.
B000002UC5|5.0|Paul McCartney's 1970 solo debut is a groundbreaking masterpiece of home recording. With The Beatles facing their ultimate demise, Paul began recording this album in the privacy of his own home using a four-track tape machine and playing all the instruments himself. With the exception of some backing harmonies from Linda McCartney, this album is entirely a Paul effort from the music all the way down to the cover artwork.<br />The music itself is an eclectic mix of Paul's melodic pop, acoustic folk, heavy rockers and experimental instrumentals. The opening track, the short love song &quot;The Lovely Linda&quot; was recorded by Paul to test his four-track. If you listen carefully, there is a door squeaking in the background.<br />&quot;That Would Be Something&quot;, &quot;Every Night&quot; and &quot;Man We Was Lonely&quot; are fun simple songs with childlike 'sing-along' choruses.<br />&quot;Junk&quot; and &quot;Teddy Boy&quot; are leftovers from previous Beatles albums. Both of these tracks stem from the &quot;White Album&quot; and &quot;Let It Be&quot; periods. Because these two tracks were vetoed by the other three Beatles, Paul made fresh recordings of these songs for this album. &quot;Singalong Junk&quot; is an instrumental reprise of &quot;Junk&quot; and shows off the songs exquisite and simple melody.<br />&quot;Oo You&quot; is a solid heavy blues rocker which has a sound that crosses between Eric Clapton and Led Zeppelin. Paul gives heavy vocal delivery on this track recalling his musical heroes Chuck Berry and Little Richard.<br />&quot;Maybe I'm Amazed&quot; is consider by many to be the hit off this album. Although it was not released as a single until 1976, this song is truly a standout and is still one of Paul's all-time best songs. Definitely a classic piece of pop songwriting.<br />The instrumental tracks on this album are quite varied and show Paul's willingness to experiment with new and unusual sounds. &quot;Valentine Day&quot; is a short improvised piece with a slight blues influence. &quot;Hot As Sun&quot; is also short and has a bright pleasant melody harmonized with two lead guitars. &quot;Glasses&quot; is probably Paul's most experimental piece released at the time. It consists soley of the sound of water glasses being rubbed at the tops creating eerie ghost-like tones. The track ends with a fragment of an unfinished song which was initially called &quot;Suicide&quot;. &quot;Momma Miss America&quot; sounds as if it were two different pieces put together. The first part features Paul's steady drumbeat and has a heavily piano-based motiff. The second part is more bluesy and features Paul delivering some stellar lead guitar.<br />The closing track &quot;Kreen-Akrore&quot; is also quite experimental and features a tribal drumbeat, jungle sounds, odd harmonized vocals, solid guitar work and even a drum solo. Quite a finale to an adventerous album.<br />Although it garnered some negative criticism when it was first released, &quot;McCartney&quot; has gone on to be one of the most revolutionary albums ever made, one of the first to be made entirely at an artist's home as opposed to a recording studio. It is definitely a work of genius. Paul's talents as a multi-instrumentalist are at the forefront here.<br />This album definitely can be used as a guide for musicians who would like to make their own record at home. If Paul McCartney can do it, anyone can.<br />A highly recommended CD.h a slight blues influence. &quot;Hot As Sun&quot; is also short and has a bright pleasant melody harmonized with two lead guitars. &quot;Glasses&quot; is probably Paul's most experimental piece released at the time.

B000002WCJ|5.0|When I began to like metal I decided that I had to try the band Helloween.For a strange reason I picked this Album even though I had never heard the band before and I didn't know how important they were.I only heard a recomendation that said that the band was awesome. So I picked the CD and I thought ''This one''. Guess what happened. It had the same effect that it has with every single Metal fan. It blew me away.I mean... hey all the tracks are a freaking work of art.The lyrics,the guitars,the vocals,the percussion...everything is awesome.It still can impress anyone and it was released 15 years ago!!! .                                                    Every single track is extraordinary.The invitation is cool. ''Eagle Fly Free'' is a super classic. ''You always walk alone'' is really good. ''Rise And Fall'' is super funny with great lyrics and solo. ''Dr Stein'' is one of my favorite 10 songs in all my Metal collection(Trust me.My collection is big)and is ...there's no words. ''We got the right'' another great song. ''Save Us'' is another classic.one of the best(If not the best)vocals in Metal history.''March of time'' is another great song.Great guitars too(Like in every single song). ''I want out'' is one of the gran gran gran...fathers of the classics and Kai Hansen last song in Helloween. ''Keeper of the seven Keys'' is a freacking ass kicker song that gives you 14 minutes of pleasure.  THIS ALBUM KICKS ASSES AND ANYONE THAT LIKES METAL LOVES IT
B00005JL3A|5.0|As soon as I saw this movie for the first time I wanted to watch it again right away.  It is not a standard horror movie- it is a heavy metal onslaught of zombie killing- oh so fun! I have seen it 6 times in the last 6 months.  One of my favorite movies!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|This CD is brilliant!
B0000AR8NK|4.0|Not among Bowie's best, but pending the release of Sting's album, this is still arguably the finest offering this year. And the reason is simple - with his unfaltering voice, Bowie can still cut it at the age of 56. <BR>True, the Thin White Duke may no longer be the chameleon we knew until the mid-90s. He has stopped reinventing himself for the last two albums and opted for safer territories which by Bowie standards, can't be all that bad. <BR>In New Killer Star, Bowie's written his best single in ages - with its catchy guitar riffs and chorus, it evokes memories of his late 70s, early 80's circa Scary Monsters era. He is still one of the few artists capable of making cover versio sound better than the original, as is the case with Pablo Picasso, though George Harrison's Try Some Buy Some is among the weaker songs on the album. B<BR>ring Me Back the Disco King is chillingly beautiful - and who knows, perhaps this could be a springboard into jazz/ lounge-land, probably the only musical genre somewhat overlooked by Bowie so far. Save perhaps for the title track, there are hardly any fillers on this album. Better than Heathen, but still falls short of rekindling the magic of his classic 70s recordings. Who knows, perhaps he doesn't want to go down that path again...
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I actually bought Mer de Noms before I bought any Tool cds, so I'm not someone who came to Thirteenth Step looking for a Tool cd.  However, there are many more reminders of Tool in the new CD than in APC's debut.  A couple of the songs on Thirteenth Step sound like they would have been at home on Lateralus.  This isn't a bad thing to me, but there are no easily-accessible &quot;Judith&quot;s or &quot;3 Libra&quot;s on this new cd if that's the kind of thing you were looking for.
B00004YB9Z|3.0|BUY THIS ALBUM FOR THE GREATEST ITALIAN OPERA VERSION OF O HOLY NIGHT! it makes me cry :(
B000089RVX|2.0|Evanescence is NOT original. For proof listen to Linkin Park, Lacuna Coil and Nightwish. They all have different things that Evanescence took. Evanescence is just a mix of Lacuna Coil, Linkin Park and Nightwish. I must admit there are a few good tunes like Going Under and Bring Me To Life but the rest of the songs are all  boring and bland - the lyrics are really bad. (I looked them up and realized some of it doesn't make sense)Amy Lee has a \\"strong\\" voice but it sounds terrible and I'm not going to say anything about her \\"prettyness\\" because some people can't help that but what she can help is how she dresses and how she denies shes \\"goth\\". That is terrible. Do not buy this CD it is garbage. The occasional person might enjoy there songs but I ask of you to listen to Linkin Park, Lacuna Coil and Nightwish. And see what I mean :)<br />Song Reviews:<br />Going Under: When you first hear this song it draws your attention and gets stuck in your head for the rest of the day. The beats are good, and the music is pretty outstanding. The song is about being pulled down (or going under) into something you don't want to. Which can probably speak for most of us, but some of the phrases in this song doesn't fit with the message. Either way, not a bad song. 4/5<br />Bring Me To Life: This is the song that got most of you hooked on Evanescence. Amy Lee's voice actually doesn't sound that bad in this song. So when you hear this song your probably thinking \\"Wow, she has so much talent.\\" and I'm not saying she doesn't because after hearing this song I was convinced she had a beautiful voice. (Just wait till you hear the other songs) the rapping does not spoil this song, it sort of fits in but Amy Lee and Paul McCoy did a pretty good job. 4/5<br />Everybodys Fool: An interesting song. \\"More lies about a world that Never was and never will be have you no shame don't you see me you know you've got everybody fooled\\" I wonder what that means. People who like Evanescence will now say, \\"Iknow what it means.\\" I could figure it out, myself, but the way the words are peiced togethar upsets me. The first sentance states that there are more lies about a world that never was and never will be. I get that. But then it asks \\"dont you see me\\" and then says \\"you know you've got everybody fooled\\" OK. That just sounds siller every time I read it! 2/5<br />Haunted: This song has a really good beat and is a bit scary. However, when you hear Amy Lee's voice it will definetly scare you. The first couple of lines are defeaning. And heres another funny line in the lyrics, \\"hunting you i can smell you - alive\\" I  felt ashamed when I looked up the lyrics. Not only is the guitar annoying at the end - I think that they should have let Amy Lee have this one with a few good instruments that actually fit in nicely. I just wish Amy Lee wouldn't have screamed into the microphone. The lyrics are stupid and the beat was so good too! Its a shame they wasted in on this ... 3/5 (the 3 for a good beat).<br />Tourniquet: \\"A device, typically a tightly encircling bandage, used to check bleeding by temporarily stopping the flow of blood through a large artery in a limb.\\" As soon as I heard this song I looked up the meaning of a tourniquet. This song is one I hate. The lyrics are all about suicide and death. So if you want to get yourself in a bad mood and make yourself depressed go ahead and listen. Otherwise, stick to another song (or even better, another band.) 1/5<br />Imaginery: Its alright. This song sounds as if when it was wrote the people were drunk. Just check this out, \\"Monsters calling my name Let me stay\\" Okay, thats enough for me to realize this song was pretty bad. I don't know what else to say. I guess next time I see Amy Lee i'll ask her what the songs about ... I wonder what she'll say. 2/5<br />Taking Over Me: Another song that sounds too similar to the others. The difference is that the same words are put togetahr and mixed up making few sense but still drawing everyones attention. One day, all of you should go and amuse yourselves by reading the lyrics to the songs. (I have a few songs to go, because every time I read a songs lyrics I burst out laughing.) Ha ha ha. The song is sad. 1/5<br />Hello: The lyrics are so short, that I realized they ran out of ideas of what stuff to write about in their songs! I wonder what theyre  going to do in their next album? (A mystery to me.) The song is alright. Not as bad as Tournequit (or however the spelling was, Im frankly too tired to spell properly.) 3/5<br />My Last Breath: For some reason this ong reminds me of \\"Taking Over Me\\" and most of the other songs on the album. Horrid, really. The songs are all similar (As was mentioned earlier.) Pretty sad. \\"My last Breath ... Please dont sing...\\" oops, I'm being cruel. 1/5<br />Whisper: I don't see what the fuss is about with this song. Everyone says its so good. But really its just like the others. Don't waste your time with this song, but really you should I guess becuse everyone seems to absolutely adore it. This is another mystery to me. 2/5<br />Overall: I've heard worse but seen so much better. It was OK but really not good. ... So go and tick \\"no\\" if your a 14 (or teen. whatever) year old trying to be cool by listening to death. Go on. And tick \\"Yes\\" if you have a brain.
B00003CXMG|5.0|I mean it, this is truly one of the best movies ever made. It has lies, and decet, drugs, and most importantly music. It is a story of a somewhat small town boy with a mother who wount cut the umbilical cord, and a sister who left because of the mom. He gets all his sisters albums when she leaves and decides he waqnts to be a writer for a music magazine, he gets an awesome assignment to go on tour with this 'Allman Brothers/Aerosmith' sounding band and writes this amazing artical for Rolling Stone, and has all of his hopes and dreams crushed to the ground before him in a matter of seconds. This is truly one of the better movies you will ever own so buy it now!!!!!! And get the soundtrack while your at it as well cause it is amazing like the film!
630196697X|5.0|Better than most film noir entries, Samuel Fuller's PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET explores the life of a pickpocket who gets in over his head.  Skip McCoy picks a pocket on the subway, and gets classified government documents for his troubles.<br />The police convince a woman to help them find Skip and the microfilm, and heavy drama ensues.  Thelma Ritter is especially good as the informant.  Today her acting would be considered over-the-top and unconvincing, but for the time, it was a standout performance.  Widmark is excellent as the pickpocket, with his portrayal only rivalled by his work in KISS OF DEATH (also a must-see film noir).<br />As a landmark film for Widmark and Ritter, as well as for director Samuel Fuller, PICKUP ON SOUTH STREET is a must-see for fans of 1940s cinema and film noir.<br />ken32

B00006CXXU|5.0|I bought this CD a little while ago and I'm glad I did. The songs are amazing. Christina Aguilera has a lot of talent that you don't find just anywhere. Her lyrics are powerful and her voice is filled with emotion. I can't stop listening to her CD. If you didn't like Christina Aguileras \\"Dirrty\\" video (I sure didn't) you might still find this CD enjoyable. Most of her songs have a strong meaning and her voice delivers you that meaning and more. Her song \\"I'm OK\\" , \\"Fighter\\", \\"Beautiful\\" and \\"Walk Away\\" are my favorites. If you didn't like Christina Aguilera before - just check into this CD because you'll probably be really surprised.
B000096I9G|3.0|I bought the DVD mainly for the Disintegration Set and the Bloodflowers set.<BR>The Disintegration set is a bit shaky.I think a lot of that is due to Balmonte`s weak guitar playing during the set.The music just doesn`t seem to have that edge and moodiness that I enjoy in a good Cure concert.They seem to be more worried about making mistakes. <BR>The Bloodflowers set I found to be pretty bland, sounding virtually identical to the studio version.Balmonte`s guitar doesn`t sound that good either.It`s not his playing that is bad,it`s the sound of his guitar.His guitar setup is wrong or something.<BR>Although I`m not really a fan of the the Pornography record,the live set on the DVD is the best of the three.<BR>Overall,I found the DVD rather disappointing and a bit boring to be honest.<BR>Maybe they should have brought back some of the previous band members as guests i.e. Boris Williams on drums for the Pornography set and Porl Thompson on guitar for the Disintegration set.<BR>Try and see the DVD first before you decide to buy it.
B000002UA2|4.0|This is  very different from Meddle,Pink Floyd's previous studio release.A great collection of songs on thisrelease-they cover a wide range rangeof musical styles, from the haunting,almost eerie sounds of Obscured by Clouds to the ballad-like Wots Uh theDeal to the Spirit in the Sky-likeFree Four by Roger Waters. All fourare allowed to stretch out a bit musically on this album. Richard Wrightsounds especially good on this album-one wonders why he doesn't sing moreon other PF albums. David Gilmour isin top form as well. A must have forPink Floyd fans.
B000092Q4U|5.0|This is one of the rawest and crunkest albums I've EVER heard! Right when I put this album in my cd player and heard the controlled chaos of &quot;Ruin&quot; I knew that I was in love with this band, they are absolutely insane! It isn't a very fast album though, they slow it down a lot and that is why it is so badass, it is just insanely heavy and it will make you cry from being owned too hard. My ONLY problem with this album is the production, it isn't very smoooth but I guess that was the purpose of it. I am seeing these guys with Shadows fall, unearth, and killswitch on november 6th, it should be CRAZY.
B00006CXXU|5.0|Christina Aguilera's new album is deep down and beautiful. She speaks from her heart and is no longer \\"bubbly pop.\\" This CD is not something most of you would expect Christina Aguilera to have. But she has definetly earned my respect with it. Christina is obviously sick of being compared to Briteny Spears and because her voice overrules most people, this CD is shining and showing her golden talent. <br />Song Reviews:<br />Stripped Part 1: Nothing special this \\"song\\" is just an indtroduction. Christina mentions she wants you to know the real her. When I frist listened to it I thought it was going to be a boring \\"Christina is trying to earn everyones respect again yawn\\" CD. But don't be fooled. Shes just making a point that you should keep in mind for the remainder of the CD. 4/5<br />Cant Hold Us Down: A brilliant song about guys mistreating gals everywhere and girls that are going to take a stand. Christina's voice is powerful and Lil Kim brings some hip-hop rap style to the song. The lyrics are strong and actually have a big meaning.  An excellent song that I love and listen to all the time. 5/5<br />Walk Away: Ever had the feeling that you wanted to walk away from something bad, but you just kept getting drawn to it and couldn't move a foot? This is what the song is about. Its a short slow song, which gives Christina some more time to sing louder and not get drained out by music. She brings emotion to the song and depth. 5/5<br />Fighter: Don't tell me you haven't heard this song. If you haven't, your definetly missing out. This song is about a guy that dumps a gal and starts spreading rumors and nasty stuff about, which makes the girl only stronger as she faces it. Its a brilliant song that you should all listen to , it will be very motivating if you get dumped, or have personal issues. The beats are strong and Christina's voice comes through beautifully. 5/5 (If I could I would give it 6/5!)<br />Primor Amor (interlude): Because Christina is speaking in Spanish, I don't know what she is saying but as I read reviews it is something about a love story. Im not too sure so dont take my word for it. Its only a little touch to the CD, Christina wants to bring in some culture, fine. Its not a long \\"song\\" but you sohuld listen to it even if you have no idea what she is  talking about, because its nice and calming. Beautiful. 3/5 (for the language mix up hehe)<br />Infatuation: Oh goodness what a beautiful song. This is a soong about infatuation, which is nice because most songs are about \\"love\\" when infatuation in most cases is the proper term. A excellent song with a catchy beat and amazing lyrics and vocals. Good job on this song! **Thumbs Up** that was a bit tacky, wasn't it? 5/5<br />Loves Embrace (interlude): Sweet, gorgeous excellent. I'm raving about evey song here!! 4/5<br />Loving me for me: One of my favorite songs. It is about loving someone for who they are and not for how they look, etc. This type of song meaning is done cntinously but Christina just knows how to it right. Its calm and her vocals are sweet. I absolutely adore this song, its not fast and dance-able but slow and soft. Excellent. 5/5<br />Impossible: With Alica Keys playing the piano, Christina sings and sings beautifully (once again). The only trouble is I dont really like this song, even though it is better then probably most things you ahve heard on other CD's this song didn't get my thumbs up. Still, Christina sings gorgeous and continues to impress me. 4/5<br />Underappreciated: Christina Aguilera is definetly underappreciated! This song is absolutely brilliant. Its catchy and the lyrics are amazing. 5/5<br />Beautiful: You've all heard this song. The meaning (you are beautiful no matter what they say words wont ring you down ...) are powerful and beautiful. With all this negativity going around this is the only way to go. 5/5<br />Make Over: Just too brilliant. 5/5<br />Cruz: Gorgeous. 5/5<br />Soar: Excellent 5/5<br />Get Mine, Get yours: A songabout being with someone but now loving them. Its not bad, but not my favorie. Probably ht worst of the album. 3/4<br />Dirrty: This song is probably the song (music video) that is refraining you from purchasing this CD. Well, it shouldn't. This song is catchy and has its own style. It will certainly make you wan to dance. Not Christina's best but not her worst. This song will make you dance. It features Redman. (Hey, since he was in the \\"Dirrty\\" video how come no bodys disapointed in him for being so dang \\"dirrty\\") Excellent. 5/5<br />Stripped PT. 2: \\"Sorry I'm not ..\\" and she talks. Its a continuation from stripped part 1 if you didn't know. Its just a sort of \\"finished introduction\\" but its better then some I've heard! 5/5<br />The Voice Within - A gorgeous song, with Christina singing as gorgeous as ever. 4/5<br />I'm OK: When I first heard this song I felt my stomach flop. Its sad, about her childhood with her abusive dad. However, its gorgeous and Christian sort of crys in it. Wonderful and sad.  5/5<br />Keep On Singing my song: We all know that Christina has an amazing voice and extradinary talent. This song finishes the album  , leaving you wanting more. My favorite! This song is about her \\"keep on singing my song' and not letting anyone change her or make her someone shes not. Extradinary and brilliant. 5/5<br />Overall: A much better CD then all those awful ones out there. Its sweet and deep, showing the real Christina Aguilera. Buy it, before it runs out! Excellent! ou must buy this! :)
B000002UJQ|5.0|I'll keep this short and sweet- this is one of those albums that you you'll be proud to have in your collection. The first time you listen, the album seems to have a depressive ambience, but after you listen to it a couple more times, you realize that this album really is a work of art. The lyrics are awesome, the guitar playing  is awesome, Thom Yorke's voice in Exit Music seems to come from inside your head. It's hard to pick a favorite song out of this album.
0375432302|5.0|I am engrossed in this book and have stopped several times to get additional information on everything from Opus Dei, to the Inquisition to Gnostics to The Last Supper and Mary Magdalene on the net.  For someone raised with a sense of faith, yet having an intuitive feeling that there are unanswered questions and pieces missing in my life's puzzle, this was a springboard for me to learn more.<br />This book is captivating, eye-opening, and believable in its history and suspenseful, exciting and an incredible page-turner as a story.<br />Mind expanding to say the least!
B00006SFBD|5.0|This is my FAVOOORITE Opeth album! These guys are just absolutely incredible,people looking to get into opeth might have some concerns about the song lengths and such but I think the fact that the songs are so long is a GREAT thing! It gives them a chance to show how epic and heavy yet melodic they can really be and how they are masters at crafting the perfect song, this is a very dark and heavy album, it is in my opinion probably their heaviest album also so it is a great place to start if you are looking to get into Opeth!
B00006J3WH|5.0|A CD that Buffy fans will enjoy, thoroughly. Filled with memories of that special musical episode, reflecting on the past and wonderful singing. <br />Song reviews:<br />Going Through the Motions: Going Through the motions is a song sung by Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar)in the scene she is in the grave yard fighting vampires and staking absentmindedly. The beats are awesome and even though SMG isn't the best singer her emotion fufills the song, makng it real and beautiful. 5/5<br />I've Got a Theory: The whole cast sings in this one (I think, not too sure about Dawn!) Its really nice and relaxing to listen to. And Anya's \\"Bunny\\" ending is funny and very cool! 5/5<br />The Mustard: Nothing special. Just a guy singing \\"They got the mustard out\\" and backgroudn singers singing \\"They got the mustard out\\" and drums playing. Then it finishes. Not wildy enthused, but people who have seen the episode will understand and embrace it for beiing in Buffy. 3/5<br />Under Your Spell: Oh gosh! Tara (Amber Benson) sings like a dream! She sounds proffesional! Her voice rings out and the lyrics are gorgeous. Excellent, excellent song. 5/5<br />I'll Never Tell: Anya (Emma Caulfield) and Xander (Nicholas Brendon) sing togethar about their weddng worries. Its a fun song to dance too, and even though Nicholas Brendon's voice is not all that good his enthusiasm and (wonderful) actings kills make up for it. 4/5<BR>          <BR>The Parking Ticket: A good song. Again its nothing special like the \\"Mustard\\" except that the voice is more beautiful and the singer is ... oh take a guess! Its the beloved Marty Noxon! It has fun lyrics that are nice to sing along too. And the laugh of \\"hey I'm not wearing underwear\\" Buffy fans wll knwo what I'm talking about! 5/5<br />Rest In Peace: Spike (James Marsters) song for Buffy. A nice song, James Marster has a good voice. Love it! 4/5<br />Dawn's Lament: Average. 4/5<br />Dawn's Ballet: Nice. 4/5<br />What You Feel: 4/5     <br />Standing: Woa! Giles (Anthony Stewart Head) has a great voice. 5/5<br />Under Your Spell / Standing (Reprise): Two great voices \\"collide\\" togethar. Superb. 5/5<br />Walk Through the Fire: My favorite! Stunning! 5/5<br />Something to Sing About: Buffy (SMG) 's mixed up song. Its not a bad one, but has good beats and a nice performance. 4/5<br />What You Feel: Good. 5/5<br />Where Do We Go From Here?: A song that made me sad (as I knew Bufy was finishing) and the episode made me feel happy, sad and mixed up at the same time. Its rather hard to explain. sweet lyrics and sweet vocals equals a sweet song. 5/5<br />Coda: 5/5<br />End Credits (Broom Dance/Grr Argh): After every episode of Buffy, this wil have played. Great! 5/5<br />Suite from \\"Restless\\": Just a song from an episode. 5/5<br />Suite from \\"Hush\\": Sent chills up my spine!! Excellent! 5/5<br />Sacrifice (from \\"The Gift\\"): One of the best epsiodes ... with the best music. 5/5<br />Something to Sing About (demo): ... 3/5
B00007LTIA|5.0|Only Yes could get away with a double album with only four songs.<BR>Forget the impatient critics of this album, it is deep, complex and full of rewards.  Some of the most beautiful and interesting Yes passages can be found in these four epic songs.  <BR>The Ancient is as intense as their later work on Relayer.  I can't see them getting to Relayer from CTTE, but from this song, I can see it coming.  Steve Howe's playing is fiercely top-notch.<br />The mastering is incredible on this reissue.  You'll likely hear things you never noticed on the previous reissues.<br />Maybe the four long songs are a little intimidating to some people.  They just need to relax and let the music take exist as it is.  It's worth the patience.
B000005Z0G|4.0|The earliest work from pac,the beats are good but the album could of been better.Not 2pac's best album , but definetly a classic with hits like keep ya head up,i get around.Its similar to 2pacalyspe but it aint better than me against the world or all eyez and 7dt.If you have'nt got me against the world or all eyez on me or 7 day theory then i suggest u get one of them to this.
B000001E3V|5.0|Clapton's first stab as a lead singer and it shows.  Many of the songs have Clapton singing with Bobby Whitlock as &quot;backing&quot; vocals. But I did not purchase this album for Clapton's singing abilities.  Clapton's guitar skills are second to none and it shows in this album.  My personal favorite  is Presence Of The Lord where Eric's guitar playing is blistering and he seems to be more comfortable in his lead singer role.  The eighteen minute Let It Rain was a bit long but takes nothing away from the rest of this exceptional album.  Other highlights include Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad and Key To The Highway.  This is a must have album for any Clapton fan.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I decided to watch this movie after seeing the first one and knowing this was going to be a briliant trilogy.  As soon as the movie started I knew it was going to be another excellent movie. The storyline is amazing. Its like you have explored a totally different world and after the film is over - you crave for more. I wanted to see it again and again. I would definetly buy this film or at least see it, its worth your time money and even a little more!<br />Overall: Excellent! Its a must see!
B000002JPA|5.0|Nevermind the cover, this album is so good you just have to listen to it to believe it. Its needless to say that I am a Dream Theater (DT) fanatic just like so many others. These guys are capable of superhuman musical abilities and this album is just the begining of exhibiting them.<br />Released in 1992 with a new (then) singer James LaBrie, DT released this epic of an album. Features one of the greatest metal tracks ever composed by humans, PULL ME UNDER, the epic journey begins. Another day is a beatiful melody that haunts you. Take The Time is a great song about understanding oneself..spending time with yourself to know what you want to do...There isnt a single bad song here but the real killers are, METROPOLIS, the predesessor to another epic Scenes From A Memory, is such a rocking monster, this song can only be played by DT. LEARNING 2 LIVE is perhaps not cited as the best DT song ever? L2L written by the most overlooked bassist on Earth, Myung, has so many things incredible about it, it gives me goose flesh every single time I hear it. Perhaps the most scintillating guitar outros ever composed is on this one, this is just impossible to describe in words. John Petrucchi or any other DT band member reading this, thank you guys, for giving us this incredible masterpeice, Images &amp; Words, gives me a reason to live...
0385512104|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and recommend it without reservation.
B00000J7J4|5.0|SUPERNATURAL is a great blend of the classic Santana sound and style with newer pop and rock influences. Anyone who thought Carlos Santana lost touch with the younger generations can now put those thoughts aside. Even though I could have done without the rap, this is still a five-star album.
B00005LC6Z|5.0|Being the first Sequel to the brilliant 1978 Halloween Horror Classic, Halloween II (1981) is clearly flawed but clearly still delivers.  First of all I think It was kind of difficult to come up with a first sequel for such a great part one that came three years earlier.  With that being said, It left off directly from the ending of the first Halloween.  It brought back all the main characters from the first one as well.  The movie also serves it's purpose explaining why Michael want's to kill his sister Laurie Strode (Played By Jamie Lee Curtis).  But the Dr. Sam Loomis (Played by Donald Pleasence) is out to stop the Evil Michael Myers from wrecking havoc even some more from earlier that day which was shown in Halloween I.  The problem with Halloween II is that, Michael Myers Was shown a bit too much opposed to the first installment which made part II lack the suspense of the original.  It's like he was the main character in this movie, especially the first half.  Another thing is that this one had more gruesome bloody death scenes which were unnecessary.  Part One showed almost no blood and still found a way too be scary.   A large part of the movie took place in an empty hospital which made the atmosphere more creepy.  I thought that maybe they should not have shown too much of the movie inside the hospital, but I feel it certainly did not ruin the movie.  As for the supporting cast which was mostly people who worked in the hospital they were not terrible but after a while the viewer might be wanting Michael too kill them, due to them being a little annoying.  Donald pleasence intense acting once again did a great job in this one as Michael Audrey Myers Doctor.  Jamie Lee Curtis also did a solid job acting as a great scream queen,  but I wish they had spent less time showing curtis lying in hospital bed throughout the movie.  Curtis however, played a vital role in the movie's intensifying ending.  When you compare Halloween II to the rest sequels in the series orany other horror movie sequels or sequel's in the entire movie industry there was not many other ways this movie could have been better.  Don't get me wrong Halloween II has it's faults but at the end it turn's out to be one hell of a ride.
0060930349|4.0|... I appreciate this summary of 400 years of American History, ending in 1997.  While addressing negatives in American society, which seem to grow in number and size as time passes, Johnson (who is British) also leads a number of cheers for the American people and their spirit.  He also makes several jabs at the French.  So, while I learned a great deal, I am also somewhat cautious in sifting between what is fact and what is opinion in the book.  <br />I read this in preparation for reading Zinn's 'People's History', I may have more to say after I've read that.
B00008G9JM|5.0|\\"Sheer propulsive tension\\" was a useful phrase from one of the professional reviewers. The piece bounds along with the strength and agility and coiled self-confidence of a large predator in the prime of its life. The tumbling coherence of the musical ideas, the perfect tightness of the band, the textural fascination of Anderson's singing voice, the ear candy of the wall of sound with its reedy deep fatness, the places and moods you pass through in the words - it is an astonishing demonstration of creative power and technical ability, that will stand up forever. A thousand years from now, people will be dancing in their living rooms to A Passion Play pumped directly into their aural circuits.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I didn't get to see this movie when it was in the theatres, but I already knew that Gwen Verdon won a Tony for the broadway version in the 1970's.  So I checked it out from the video store for me and my grandfather to watch.  I'm almost 22, and I was glad when this movie was over, but my grandfather was gladder.  Gwen Verdon's musical is trashed in this God Awful film.  The movie version is about a woman who kills her abusive husband, (who probably deserved it) and is put in jail and threatened execution and the night club that she sings with makes fun of her with music.  As you may know, Gwen Verdon died of a heart attack in the winter of 2000 and if she could have seen this film, she would have been APPALLED!  Get &quot;Damn Yankees,&quot; instead.  This film is only for people who enjoy offensive musicals.
B000002LOE|2.0|I'm a huge REM fan, but if it were somehow up to me I'd end this business about \\"Out of Time\\" being REM's best album. If you listen to REM's early records (namely, the first three) what you get is a group full of originality, with lyrical ambiguity, guitars that jangle, melodies that are timeless, and so forth. <br />With \\"Out of Time\\" ironically, you get a record that is very much *not* timeless. In fact it's basically your typical radio pop ...! If REM could ever be accused of selling-out artistically, this is the one that did it. \\"Green\\", for me, was a hint of trouble to come, but \\"Out of Time\\" embodies everything that I don't like about REM. Somehow, they redeemed themselves with \\"Automatic for the People\\" and the very underrated \\"New Adventures in Hi-Fi\\", but ever since they're becoming more and more irrelevant. ...
B00005O3VC|5.0|THE MOVIE<BR>No explanation needed.  This is, without a doubt, one of the funniest movies ever made.  It's completely mindless and stupid, and that's why you should love it too.<br />PICTURE/SOUND<BR>All very nice, nothing special, but for it's age, it looks great.<br />EXTRAS<BR>Alright, here's the real review.  <BR>On Disc One, there are two commentaries included.  One is by the co-directors, Terry Jones and Terry Gilliam.  The other is by the other 3 (surviving) Python members, Eric Idle, Michael Palin, and John Cleese.  Also on Disc One are some oddities such as subtitles from \\"Henry IV, Part II.\\"<BR>On Disc Two is the documentary, \\"The Quest for the Holy Grail Locations\\" whcih includes Terry Jones and Michael Palin traveling the English countryside, visiting the sites used in the movie and reliving old memories.  It's good, I promise!<BR>Along with that is another documentary, shot on location in 1974 by the BBC on the production of the film, entitled \\"On Location with the Pythons.\\"  Not much gets done, but it's fun to watch, and Graham Chapman goes off to catch a large do-do like creature, you know, with a beak.  Not really, he just describes it.<BR>There is an education film, called \\"How to Use Your Coconuts\\" hosted by Michael Palin and a friend.  Not really educational at all, is it!?  But watch it anyways.<BR>A short little segment with LEGO people performing the \\"Camelot\\" song.<BR>A little segment about \\"Unused Locations\\" which means Python members talking nothingness over video of various things from the mid-70s...I mean, unused locations.<BR>Three of the musical segments of the film, with lyrics included!<BR>A -LOT- of pictures from the film, and not all by Terry Gilliam!  It includes promotional material and a whole bunch of other stuff.<BR>Oh, and a Cast Directory.<BR>Oh! Oh! And Theatrical Trailers!<br />Good stuff.  Get it.
B00005JKJA|2.0|To me this film was a bunch of nonsense. I liked the directing. At times it is really amazing what the director of photography pulls off because some of his shots and depictions of LA were just brilliant. I also liked some of the acting along with the score. The lady that was the land lord complaining about the prize fighting kangaroo in the courtyard along with  whoever played the cowboy were classic Lynch characters that I enjoyed thoroughly. Another stand out scene is the one in the Winkie's on Sunset Blvd. where the guy talks about his terrifying dream. Outside of that I found little in this movie that made sense or engaged me on an intellectual level. It becomes quite apparent in a lot of David Lynch's work (this film and the last 12 or so episodes of Twin Peaks) that Lynch is far better at complexifying the mystery and tangling plot lines than he is at solving them or giving any kind of meaningful resolution. Also, the masturbation and lesbian scenes were both totally gratuitous and did nothing but prove to me how ridiculous a film Muholland had become. If you want to see a good Lynch film go for Blue Velvet or the first 14 episodes of Twin Peaks. I also thought The Lost Highway was better and you might want to give that one a viewing as well. If you liked this film then I would also recommend Gummo and Julian and The Donkey Boy as those two films will be right up your alley.
6301066642|3.0|Opening text:  \\"Back in 1919, Vaudeville was a very big part of Show Business.  Our story is about the Donahues, a very little part of Vaudeville.\\"<br />Yes, the trials and triumphs of the Donahues are examined from 1919 to World War II.  They go from being the Two Donahues to The Five Donahues, with variances inbetween.  There are the parents, Molly and Terrance, and their three offspring, Steven, Katy, and Tim, whose adult careers are also covered.<br />However, the real drama involves the two sons.  Steven decides to become a priest, which upsets the father.  However, his mother and Katy are supportive.  It's all a matter of perspective.  For Steve, it's a change in venue, only the church has had a pretty long run.  Tim becomes romantically involved with aspiring blonde singer Vicky Parker, played by (guess who?)  and runs into all sorts of ups and downs.  However, he gets jealous when he suspects he's having an affair with the producer, Lew Harris.<br />The musical numbers vary from extravagant and splashy to simplistic, and it's the latter that play better, such as the \\"Lazy\\" number featuring Monroe, Gaynor, and O'Connor.  However, the \\"Heat Wave\\" number, with Latin rhythms fused with the usual big band stuff and MM's hot costume, is a highlight.  And the lengthy \\"Alexander's Ragtime Band\\" may offend those of German, French, and Scottish ancestry who don't like this glossy cariacaturing of their ethnicity, i.e. costumes and bogus accents.  Still, the bright colours are praiseworthy.<br />The interractions between Ethel Merman and Dan Dailey work the best, as the parents who want the best for their children and struggle.  At one point, they buy a house in Jersey, but what a time for a mortgage, especially during the Depression.  Most people gave up the theatre, with the theatres in turn giving up the Donahues.<br />As for MM, she sings three solo numbers, \\"After You Get What You Want You Don't Want It\\", the languid \\"Lazy\\", and the scorching \\"Heat Wave\\", which has her in a suggestive costume, black and white on the outside, red on the inside, with a full open skirt revealing her underthings.  She felt denigrated by the number, upset, saying, \\"I did what they said and all it got me was a lot of abuse...Big breasts, big a--, big deal.  Can't I be anything else?  The dance people kept making me flash the skirt wide open and jump around like I had a fever...it was ridiculous.\\"<br />This would be the last time MM would play a supporting role in a picture.  The reason was 20th Century Fox, which agreed to give her the starring role in The Seven Year Itch if she did this movie.  For this reason, the natural stars of the show are Ethel Merman and Donald O'Connor, two years after he made it big in Singin' In The Rain.  Merman plays her usual brassy self--after all, as Dan Dailey tells her, she isn't exactly Whispering Jack Smith.<br />However, Mitzi Gaynor (Katy) is the real one to watch.

B000089CJI|5.0|I'm not much for Death Cab for Cutie and admittedly have never listed to Dntel, but somehow, despite all that was going against it upon my introduction to it, &quot;Give Up&quot; has proved itself as one of the most gorgeous, delicate LPs I've heard in a long time. Basically, this is a very quiet record, but to say that it is understated artistically would be to severely ignore its power: &quot;Give Up&quot; is a testament to simplicity, a minimalist &quot;electronic&quot; record that establishes its sentiments (beauty, love, fantasy) and never lets go. It is very much a record to listen to at night, the kind where you can lay back and lose yourself in the melodies, a soft, gentle experience--absolutely rewarding in every sense of the word. Buy it!
B000001EL3|4.0|Finalmente la carrera del grupo se consolidó con la creación de este enorme disco. Mucho mejor que los anteriores, solo su primer trabajo se puede considerar a la altura de esta obra digna, del viejo testamento del rock. <BR>Enormes batidas de guitarra, gran ejecución de la percusión y buenos temas de rock duro en definitiva<br />1- Detroit Rock city: Súblime, desde los comienzos con sonidos ambientales, hasta la gestación de los ritmos apabullantes de la guitarra y en un envolvente bajo. Principalmete merecen mención el gran estribillo y el impresionante periodo intermedio. 9´5/10<br />2- King of the night time world: Simplemente una canción correcta, sin nada ni a destacar ni a recriminar. 5/10<br />3- God of Thunder: Potente, Mítica y poderosa una canción perfecta para momentos de gloria, y como dato representativo la asombrosa voz de Gen. 8´5/10<br />4- Great Expectations: Simple y llana  4/10<br />5- Flaming Youth: Kiss mostrando su dominio sobre la vieja escuela. 5´5/10<br />6- Sweet Pain: Buena introducción, nada más    5/10<br />7- Shout it out loud: Muy, pero que muy comercial, afamada y cansina al escucharla en exceso. Buen estribillo y un acompañamiento correcto   6´5/10<br />8- Beth: Primera balada decente del grupo, pero sin duda muy sobrevalorada.  6´5/10<br />9- Do you love me?: Estos son los Kiss que todos queremos: chulos, descarados, con letras cotidianas y musica que irrumpe con violencia en nuestras cabezas. 8/10
B000002J0P|5.0|How can anyone do without this? Crank up your stereo and blast \\"Wooden Ships\\" or \\"Long Time Gone\\".  I recently heard David Crosby say that Cass Elliot is somewhere on this disc. My guess would be \\"Guinnevere\\" or \\"Helplessly Hoping\\". Stephen Stills is one of the most underrated guitarists and one of the best wah-wah pedal players. A brilliant beautiful recording.<br />One thing.....who is the dude looking out the door window on the back cover?<br />Buy it....now!
B000092ZYX|3.0|I'm a Radiohead fan, but I think &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; is uneven, even dull at certain points--full of potential, yes, which only reminds me of how let down I feel when the record ends. It does have its moments, certainly--the single &quot;There there&quot; is as good as anything released by Radiohead, and there are a few other songs that remain pretty solid and engaging. <br />The problem with how Radiohead is reviewed, in part, has to do with the troublesome fact that Radiohead are too hip for their own good: when critics are afraid to *criticize* their work, you know there's something sour going on. I think popularity has really hindered their vision: after all, imagine the kind of pressure being labeled &quot;The Best Band in the World&quot; must bring.<br />A friend of mine said that this record wasn't their best, but still better than anything else out there. Is this the kind of status Radiohead deserves? I say absolutely not. It's a tired opinion, but I still don't think they've managed to reach the kind of artistic consistence they achieved on &quot;OK Computer&quot;. And unfortunately, as &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; has exhibited to me, I think Radiohead has finally reached the level of self-parody: what we have here is Radiohead *trying* to play like Radiohead. Personally, I think Radiohead is more finished than anything else. Sorry!
B00000263T|5.0|Estas son las puertas al verdadero metal, un album que forma parte del viejo testamento de rock, el grupo marcaría en este punto un antes y un despues en su música. <BR>En esta ocasión los riff de guitarra se mezclan con sintetizadores y sonidos góticos, a la par de contundentes.<br />Nada es prescindible en este trabajo, todo significa un gran momento de gloria y de puro sentimiento mostrando el mejor rock-metal de todos los tiempos, a destacar canciones: como la impresionante &quot;Metal Heart&quot;, la clásica &quot;Living for tonite&quot;, la distendida &quot;Midnight Mover&quot; y la épica &quot;Dogs on Lead&quot; entre otras
B000002IWQ|4.0|I'm gonna keep this review simple and straight to the point. I think Counterparts is an excellent album for one reason. I like it. Period. As soon as I heard it, I connected with it on a very organic level. It jumped out of my speakers and spoke to me. I'm not gonna sit here and claim that I'm so great and I know what I'm talking about because I've been such a loyal fan and I've gone to God knows how many of their shows. That has nothing to do with liking an album. It's all personal opinion. Does the music do anything for you emotionally? Does it connect? Rush have been saying for years that they play music because they enjoy doing what they do, and that it's communication. And it's energy. Ultimately that's what music is. It doesn't have to actually have a message, as long as it makes that connection in some way shape or form. That's all there is to it. Oh and I may be crazy but, this amazing ride cymbal work that Neil Peart does on &quot;Cold Fire&quot; that so many reviewers have been making a big deal about? Am I the only die hard loyal Rush fan that has recognized this cymbal pattern that he has also played on &quot;The Spirit Of Radio&quot;, &quot;Time Stand Still&quot;, &quot;YYZ&quot;, &quot;The Body Electric&quot;, &quot;Subdivsions&quot;, and &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot;? It's brilliant yes and I love it every time I hear it. It's what inspired me to learn how to play drums, but it's not unfamiliar to Neil's box of tools that he uses to craft a drum part.
6304806426|5.0|This is a mystery story that lives up to the promise of that description. Not very many movies fit that bill so fully. Ralph Fiennes is  Almasy, horribly burned after his plane is shot down, looking a bit like Boris Karloff in \\"The Mummy\\" but older, as Juliette Binoche nurses him in a ruined Italian monastery in the last days of World War II. He doesn't remember who he is - or maybe he just says he doesn't: doubts are sowed in the audience's mind and left there. But his story -perhaps remembered - unfolds in flashback. Here Fiennes looks rather more presentable and is doing a spot of mapmaking and exploring in North Africa and getting on the close side to Kirstin Scott Thomas's Katherine. Meantime in Italy, Willem Dafoe shows up - there is something seriously the matter with his hands and he and seems to know something a bit on the dark side about Almasy's past: perhaps these facts are connected in some way and we keep watching to find out what. The film's success depends on getting us interested in what's at the back of all this and keeping us that way (even when we find out...). And it delivers. The acting is consistently extraordinary - especially, no, on second thoughts, no \\"especially\\" about it, by \\"consistently\\" I mean consistently; the direction and cinematography excellent; and the writing literate and compelling.
B00005YW4H|2.0|-<BR>A word to the wise:  This album is overrated.<br />This album fell short of my expectations.  While the song list is good, the voice that sings them is not.  It is raspy, monotone and lacking emotion.  After repeated listening, striving to find the element that bewitched the Grammy judges, Norah's voice failed to grow on me; instead, it began to sound like fingernails on a chalkboard.<br />Sorry, Norah, keep working at polishing that voice.<br />Instead of falling for all the hype behind this album, take a good look at Eva Cassidy, a 'newbie' just like Norah Jones.  The only thing that separates Eva from Norah is the voice; refreshing, full of colour and emotion.  Eva's singing skills far surpassed those of Norah (she passed away in 1996), and is well worth a listen.<BR>-

You get to know your strengths, basically things you see anyway through how you do things, but there is no advice in the book on how actually apply this knowledge about yourself!!!<br />An I am doubtful about the quality of the test, since I took it twice, one with a time limit, another without, since I had to use a dictionary an understand the questions without an adrenalin rush; AND THE RESULTS ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT!!! <br />So which test is right then?

B000089RVX|5.0|Dude <BR>This album rocks. Amy lee's voice can spook you and when necesssary enchant you. The lead guitar does a great job too. Quite simeply 'Bring me up to life' and 'Going Under' are the best songs. The other songs are not bad. In sum Great album amazing sound.
0736041850|3.0|This book is highly recommended for those who wants to seriously know how exactly your work out is affecting each muscle groups. Easy to read, and a great reference book. This is not &quot;how to do work out&quot; book, but it is just a supplemental book to add to your work out book collection. I never really used it after I bought this book actually. I just keep on with a regular work out, and my body simply teaches me what muscle group is being worked on. Also, it is often your gym machine shows you exactly what muscle group is for. I realized that was all I neede to know. If you want to study a human muscle anatomy in simple way, buy this book. If you want to train, just sweat !
B00007KWHN|4.0|&quot;The Yes Album&quot;, long considered the group's first &quot;real&quot; album (although bits of &quot;Time And A Word&quot;, like &quot;Astral Traveller&quot;, pointed in the right direction), is also their most accessible from the 70s: the prog-pop mix heard here would not be as strong until &quot;Going For The One&quot; six years later.  With &quot;Yours Is No Disgrace&quot;, &quot;Starship Trooper&quot; and &quot;I've Seen All Good People&quot; the band managed to craft clean, crisp, melodic rock songs with all the elements of their trademark sound: CSN-style vocal harmonies mixed with strong instrumental hooks and Howe's bright, adventurous acoustic and electric guitar work. Although the arrival of Wakeman on &quot;Fragile&quot; pointed out the one deficiency in their sound up to this point (a kind of sameness of arrangement that made Tony Kaye's minor piano and organ contributions look a little amateurish), everything else that made Yes a force to be reckoned with is here, and most of these songs have stood the test of time to become staples in their live act and on anthology collections to this day. Even the brief &quot;Venture&quot; is a catchy singalong that serves as a nice link between two longer tracks.  Many fans claim that the live versions on &quot;Yessongs&quot; blow these away (Wakeman certainly had a chance to fix the keyboard work by then, especially on things like the closing outro to &quot;Starship Trooper&quot;, with its wall-of-sound mellotrons and synths), but it is still absolutely essential to hear the songs in their original compact studio incarnations.  The bonus tracks are the weakest of the remaster series, as there's nothing really new here, but it is interesting (as it is with &quot;Roundabout&quot;, &quot;America&quot; and the title track to CTTE) to see how the group edited their epic-length material in the bid for singles chart success.  In any case, &quot;The Yes Album&quot; along with &quot;Fragile&quot; are both perfect starting points for anyone interested in the group, even those not usually disposed toward progressive rock.
B000002UJQ|5.0|This CD, like most of Radiohead's albums, is truly amazing.  The thing that many Radiohead skeptics must understand is that initially Radiohead's music usually isn't that good, but the more and more you listen to it, the better it gets.  It's important for any person who is thinking about buying a Radiohead album, to know that they may not get what they expected or maybe even be turned off.  But the music becomes more moving and enjoyable every time you listen to it.  It does not get stale, it does not become annoying or wonder out of your musical tastes.  I doubt that very many people who have listened to this CD and did not enjoy listened to it again.  I've been listening to Radiohead for a few years and this cd is probably my favorite, throughout my varied phases of favorite genres, I still can pop in this CD and enjoy it more than I did the time before.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Although &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; beats it out for the crown of best Yes album, and repeated listens to &quot;Relayer&quot; reveal countless layers and subtleties, &quot;Fragile&quot; is the album I would recommend as a starting point for Yes--and since Yes is the definitive symphonic prog act, it provides an excellent starting point for prog in general.  Although the five brief solo pieces scattered in-between the epics are frequently thought to have made it sound a little disjointed, every track is strong, with the one exception of Wakeman's pleasantly dull &quot;Cans And Brahms&quot; (its brevity is, however, an advantage in this case!).<br />&quot;Roundabout&quot; is the group's most overplayed track and one even the most devoted fans might get tired of after the ten-zillionth listen, but fresh ears cannot deny its brillliant composition, playing and production, with stunning harmonies and definitive guitar and keyboard solos.  Speaking of stunning harmonies, &quot;We Have Heaven&quot; bursts from the speakers like a postcard from above<BR>and will have you singing along in no-time.  Offsetting its optimism is the darker &quot;South Side Of The Sky&quot;, oddly overlooked<BR>by the group over the years (apparently it was too difficult even for them to play live!) and thus a very fresh listen.  The howling wind and footsteps (reminiscent of Pink Floyd) presage a monster guitar riff that carries the track, although the jazzy piano/vocal interlude is perhaps the highlight.  At times during the playing of this album one is tempted to think that this is the direction The Beatles may have gone in had they continued with the experimentation of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;.  <br />Bruford's 30-second &quot;5% For Nothing&quot; acts as a novelty introduction to &quot;Long Distance Runaround&quot;, in which Yes implants their unique musical approach onto the conventional three-minute pop song. Lyrically, this is one of the album's strongest statements, being a subtly phrased questioning of religion.  The song melds with Squire's pulsing bass experiment &quot;The Fish&quot;, in which he overdubs dozens of basses (fuzz, wah-wah, both, you name it) on top of each other playing variations on a kinetic riff that rocks extremely hard.  Not only will one be dazzled by Squire's prowess, but the appearance of a more straightforward rocker is exactly what the album needs at this point.  Indeed, I'm tempted to name &quot;The Fish&quot; one of the greatest rock instrumentals ever.  Howe's moody, Spanish acoustic guitar piece &quot;Mood For A Day&quot; follows, influenced heavily by Segovia and very tastefully played with a &quot;less is more&quot; approach unusual for this genre of prog.  That is not the case with the closing &quot;Heart Of The Sunrise&quot;, however, which remains my all-time favorite Yes work and one of the best prog songs ever (note how this album has the best of everything--best pop song, best instrumental, best epics...).  The peaks and valleys in this song are quite extreme and frame what is, at its heart, actually a simple ballad with an emotional lyric that paints abstract impressions with words.  The way the group embellish this &quot;simple ballad&quot; to classical proportions, playing contrapuntal bits and extended keyboard variations that twist and turn against each other along with Howe's screaming metal-ish opening guitar riff, is like a picture-perfect advertisement for the virtues of progressive rock.  As a pop song, &quot;Heart Of The Sunrise&quot; would have been charming but minor.  As a ten-minute epic, the track manages to touch on all moods and emotions, while not a single note is wasted; the themes are all carefully composed and interwoven into each other for maximum atmospheric impact.  When a reprise of &quot;We Have Heaven&quot; bursts in and fades out just as quickly at the close, one is tempted to simply press &quot;play&quot; all over again.  <br />Yes' sound crafted here is like the perfect naturalbuzz; endorphins are sparked and heightened virtually every second this CD is in the machine.  Indeed, I have at times sung along to this in the car with friends and had a blast.  Wakeman is almost certainly the definitive factor that made this a step above the already brilliant &quot;Yes Album&quot;--his virtuosic (what else?)keyboard layering colors each track ingeniously, which is why it is a little puzzling that his own solo contribution sounds like background muzak--although all of the members seem to be challenging each other here.  The bonus tracks are not too rare but it is great to have the full-length &quot;America&quot; added to this collection, it fits better here than it would on &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; (and the single version is a bonus track on the latter album anyway). &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; may be even tighter and more complex, with just three epic tracks that all complement each other, but &quot;Fragile&quot;'s bits and pieces all fit endearingly together as well and in my opinion this album is only one miniscule smidgen below its successor in quality, and certainly the most fun.  Even if this is the first Yes album you ever purchase, its accessibility (especially for people not usually into prog) may make this the most-played, even after decades.
6304779356|5.0|This may be one of the very best films of its genre.  No, it actually is.  I first saw The Lost Boys at a local movie theater when I was a little girl, and it has always been the best movie I have ever seen in a theater.  I was only five, but I remember even now that I was haunted by the characters, the plot and the music for days afterward.  Joel Shumacher wanted to create a dream-like feel to his work, and he knew exactly what he was doing.  Truly original, it was very eighties and contemporary but still manages, in some way, to remain a classic as well.  It's interesting to find out how different the former version of the script was from how the film turned out.  The Lost Boys was actually being rewritten in some areas even as it was being filmed.  (Some of the best things happen by accident or on spur of the moment.)  Kiefer Sutherland as David, the nastiest bloodsucker of the four nocturnal dudes, can't be matched.  His sinister laugh, his blood-draining gaze, and that incredible, very, very sexy voice, makes half the movie what it is.  Jason Patric just seemed right as Michael.  He has a quietness about him that makes him seem vulnerable yet tough at the same time.  A very believable, very natural performance.  Jami Gertz was beautiful and did her thing as the lone female vampire.  She wasn't the annoying girl you usually want killed off.  Instead, you look forward to when she appears in the next scene.  I really like the way she potrays Star to be so mysterious and almost ethereal.<BR>I had to get this on DVD (I found the soundtrack as well and pop it in when I take breaks while studying).  Once in a while, you come across a movie that you can see a thousand times and never get tired of it.  The Lost Boys is one of them.<br />P.S. There may be talks of doing a sequel to this film.  I'm not sure.  Maybe there still is, maybe there was at one time but not any longer.  Please, please, anybody -- everybody -- DO NOT LET THAT SEQUEL HAPPEN.  Without a doubt, it would be a stake through the heart of the original ... and its fans.
B00005A46T|1.0|This band and this album sucks, it's nu metal, the most horrendous genre in the history of rock, a genre that I Despise more than rap and pop and country put together, the songs are pointless, there isn't even speed in this album, it's trash<BR>slipknot along with 95% percent of the nu metal scene, should<BR>be thrown right in the garbage.<BR>I Blame nirvana for this.

B000028U0Y|5.0|I recently put this album back in after not listening to it for a while.  I did it in honor of Mr. Cash's memory, after he just passed away this week.  <br />I had forgotten how amazing this album truly is.  First of all, there are tons of classic songs on this disc.  \\"Folsom Prison Blues,\\" of course, is one of Cash's standards, but he also plays \\"I Still Miss Someone,\\" which for me also has elevated to classic status.  Additionally, he sinks his teeth into the folk standards \\"Cocaine Blues\\" and \\"Long Black Veil\\"; the former is especially good.<br />This CD also contains three bonus songs not available on the original record, \\"Busted,\\" \\"Joe Bean,\\" and \\"The Legend of Johny Henry's Hammer.\\"  \\"Busted\\" and \\"John Henry\\" are especially good; one wonders why they weren't available on the original.<br />Another feature of this CD that makes it unique from the original is the fact that it's uncensored.  That is actually a great bonus.  Cash has a great interchange with the prisoners.  He tells many jokes for their benefit, at the expense of the wardens and their ilk.  It's also notable that many of the songs have a prison theme, such as \\"Folsom Prison Blues,\\" \\"35 Minutes to Go\\" [which goes through a man's thoughts while he awaits his hanging], and \\"Dark as a Dungeon.\\"<br />Finally, June Carter, Cash's wife, sings on two songs.  \\"Jackson\\" is especially superb.  It's a raucous affair, fast paced and fun.<br />I definitely recommend this album to any fans of country music, and especially to fans of Johnny Cash.
B000089RVX|4.0|The only problem (that knocks a star) is that the lead singstress's voice is almost TOO beautiful.  I can't really explain it. A lot of the songs run real deep, but when focused on the beauty of the voice, it's almost as if &quot;who could ever harm this sweet, perfect thing,&quot; ya know? I had the pleasure of seeing Evanescence live, and yes, she really DOES sound that sweet.
B000002WYT|5.0|Beautiful album from the Dave Matthews Band; in my opinion, their strongest work to date.  Includes the gorgeous &quot;Crash Into Me,&quot; the rollicking, aggressive &quot;Too Much,&quot; and the stunning &quot;#41.&quot;  Dave Matthews sings his heart out on all of the tracks - he's an incredible vocalist who probably doesn't get the credit he deserves for being such an original singer.  Another gem is the tender &quot;Let You Down.&quot;  Listening to this album makes you truly realize how incredibly interesting Carter Beauford is on the drums.  Anyway - this is an excellent album - clearly one of the best of the 90s and a clear indication as to why DMB lasted in a decade where what was popular one day, was gone the next.  It doesn't get much better than this.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Had to add my ringing praise for this series for the central reason not yet given mention ; namely \\"the writing\\". The idea of blending cultures , making this appraoch to Sci-fi a \\"Space Western\\" , works as solidly unique as what I always called the 1st \\"Eastern-Western\\" in David Carradine's \\"Kung Fu\\". And it even has a biting wit  to it , that can be howlingly funny if just for the surprise of it , that it just makes its characters and their world just so much more fully rendered and from its very 1st episode. The matter-of-fact perceptions and comments ,as well as the relationship,  just between the Capt. and the mercenary Jayne  alone is a diamond in the rough.  Yet anyone of this crew has that other-worldly aura about them perhaps summed up best in the final scene in \\"Bladerunner\\" when the dying Replicant Rutger Hauer reveals to Harrison Ford's Dekkard  that  \\"I ve seen things you people wouldn't believe...\\" <BR> Well with this Boxed DVD set release we fans are saved from being oh so very close to seeing \\"Firefly\\" become \\" ...all those monents being lost ...like teardrops .....in the rain. ....Time to die \\".<BR>( forgive the \\"Bladerunner \\" melodrama , but I thought it apt and , well , I plain just couldn't resist )<BR> But the first episode that finally hooked me for always was the one entitled \\" Out of Gas\\" which was the 1st episode to offer the viewers some insight into each member of the crew from the flashbacks of a slowly dying Capt. remembering the signature moments when and how he'd met and brought aboard each member while holding on to what he felt would be his last moments abord an \\"absandoned\\" Serenity. Most poignant to me was how this episode brought out the depth of what Serenity meant to this Capt. and , thus ,showed the depth of the Capt's love for \\"his ship\\" on a \\"live free or die\\" level. It was just beautifully written and portrayed. <BR> In fact I felt that it was \\"so\\" well-written that I never bothered to v-tape any of the episoides because I felt that FOX \\"knew\\" it had another hit and that \\" Firefly\\" wasn't going anywhere but up. I mean we \\"all\\" felt it would atleast be allowed to finish out the season....right?<BR> Well the crass marketeers at FOX will get their come-uppence when they see the success of the sales of this DVD Set if just because their collosal narrow-mindedness actually helped inflame & magnify this fierce loyalty that is about to have its numbers shown in units sold and all this is a foretaste for \\"the Movie\\" which is being produced by Universal and \\"not\\" FOX.<BR>Somehow \\"20th Centiury FOX\\" takes on new meaning in what is now already the 21st Century. <BR>  This series is such a winner and , with the eventual sales and box office numbers, the people will have spoken louder and clearer than any of the mindless manufactured audience pandered to through <BR>\\"American Idol\\".<BR> What else is there to say but  \\"Rupert Murdock 's loss is our gain.\\"
630463949X|5.0|I got this after getting a new computer with DVD player and searching for things to plug into it.  Already have a fair collection of Fleetwood Mac albums and was exposed to them in the late 60's while serving in the army in Germany.  None of this prepared me for &quot;The Dance&quot; and life's been better ever since.  There is real magic here.  Stevie Nicks, besides her vocal ability, has defined body language.  Lindsey's work with the Rick Turner Model 1 guitar affirms that it was designed with him in mind.  Mick Fleetwood plays drums as a musical instrrument.  John McVie lays out his great bass patterns and Christie adds a beauty in voice and visage.  I have played this DVD at least 4 or 5 times every week in the 4 months I've had it and never seem to tire of it.  Got my money's worth many times over.
0156027321|3.0|Amidst the unanimouse wide-eyed adoration for the Life of Pi, can a mere reader voice dissent? I shall try.<BR>    It is not that I did not enjoy reading the book; I am just totally mystified by its elevation to, without much exaggeration, one of the immortal pieces of human literature, the prize-winning, the fawning admiration. Within ten pages of Arundhati (I hope I am spelling this correctly) Roy's The God of Small Things I knew why that book had won the Booker. When Anita Brookner won for Hotel du Lac, I had no problem convincing myself that the judges knew something I did not know. With Life of Pi, I am totally puzzled. I kept reading, knowing that a masterpiece would somehow reveal itself just around the next page turn. After about page 200 I stopped expecting. It is a well written book, mind you, but no better or worse than several I have recently read. On page 300+ (whatever) I took a deep breath, put the book down and had to think for a few minutes--yes, it did this to me. Two pages later, that was it. The book was over. I felt the way you feel when your boss plays a practical joke on you. Knowing things that the reader does not know, the author does have a comparable kind of power over the reader. Great authors use it wisely.<BR> To be certain, the dramatic revelation at the very end of the book does make one think, does dazzle with this play on alternative universes, of fantasy as a means of survival--I loved it. The only problem: too little too late. I felt cheated. What I had read for 300+ pages was an interesting boy-scout kind of survival story with its tinge of  humor (the Japanese banana-floating experiment takes the prize here!) and a peppering of zoological knowledge. I had to read to within two pages of the end to find anything more profound. This is the sort of thing that would have worked great in a short story.<BR> I do like surprising plot twists; but an honest twist is the kind that makes the reader say: &quot;oh, yes, but of course, how could I have not thought of it! The author must give some notice, some inkling, a discomfort with the &quot;official story.&quot; The fantasy scene with the French cook in the fog is not enough, one easily dismisses it as a hallucination, it connects to nothing else. I felt a bit like this when Atwood sprang her secret at the very end of the Blind Assassin (with, admittedly, somewhat more of a warning). The difference: Assassin was a great book to read well before the last two pages. If a book is a journey, the destination is not the most important part.<BR> Pi is a good book, not a great one. Its author is obviously much more at ease developing tension with animals than with fellow humans. The kaleidoscopic pageant of religions springs out of nowhere, leads nowhere. What makes religion interesting as a literary subject is how it informs peoples' lives and here we get nothing beyond folcloric surface. The meercat island is fantasy without imagination, if imagination is the gift to enchant rather than merely spin a tall tale.<BR> Bottom line: had it not been for the raised expectations, I might have enjoyed Pi more than I did. But then, had it not been for the hype, I might have not read it at all.
B00000JPH5|5.0|Labyrinth never fails to make me smile. I have been watching it since 1989! It has a great storyline about courage, love and friendship. It is action packed, full of one of a kind Bowie songs, and quite frankly, hilarious. The characters are unforgettable. Jennifer Connelly(this may have been her debut) is as breathtakingly beautiful as she is charming and innocent. David Bowie, as the Goblin King is perfect. This is a movie to watch again and again and each time notice some new detail. My 30 something daughter, my teenage son and my 8 year old grandson all think Labyrinth is the greatest.  As mother, grandmother, and teacher, I highly recommend Labyrinth for anyone who likes an adventure.
B000021Y7X|5.0|I was a fan when this &quot;movie&quot; came out and always have been.  When I saw this come out on DVD, I thought, what the heck, I'll order it.  Wow, was I ever surprised!  I have a pretty good surround sound system but was totally unprepared for the quality of this recording when brought into the new millenium.  I listed to this in the days of vinyl or on the radio and was more than pleased at how well this transferred over to digital format.  David Byrne sounds great but is even better to watch.  I have no idea where he gets his energy.<br />An interesting discovery: I like to entertain friends and family with music and most definitely like to give them the visual effects that go along with video concerts like this.  What I was surprised about was how everyone responded when I put this DVD on.  Those who were already fans loved it, those who never heard of Talking Heads were blown away by the music put out by these guys as well as how dynamic they are in concert.<br />If you have any questions on whether or not to buy this, then I have your answer - DON'T hesitate, get it now, you won't be sorry.
B00000IQMT|4.0|This soundtrack album, first released in May of 1999 a few weeks before the release of Episode I, can best be called an appetizer for what followed. Not just to the film itself, mind you, but also to Sony's subsequent 2000 2-CD Ultimate Edition soundtrack.<br />While this double-dipping marketing technique is not without precedent, it does highlight this album's weaknesses, even though these, too, are not without precedent in Star Wars soundtracks' history.<br />Although the quality of the music is, as always, good and the London Symphony Orchestra's performance is brilliant, I found the music track names to be inaccurate and misleading.  For instance, Arrival at Naboo, the music that follows the familiar Star Wars main title on Track 1 is NOT from that sequence at the start of the film. Rather, that cue is heard when Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi, Queen Amidala, and Anakin Skywalker arrive at Coruscant. Call me nit-picky, but I find such mislabeling to be rather annoying.<br />The one virtue that saves this somewhat disappointing &quot;soundtrack&quot; is the rendition of the two central new themes introduced in The Phantom Menace: Duel of the Fates and Anakin's Theme.  It also serves as a good collector's item, but if you want the best recording from The Phantom Menace, do yourself a favor...save a few bucks and spend them on the more pricey (but more complete) Ultimate Edition.
B00004XOWM|3.0|Significant Other was a rap-rock landmark whether critics know it or not;that album was well put together and thought out. Choclolate Starfish and The Hot Dog Flavored Water was rushed obviously to capitalize on the success of Significant Other. This album does have it's bright spots though; both versions of Rollin', Gimme Watcha Got, My Way, Boiler and the beautifully evil Take A Look Around, their re-interpretation of The Mission Impossibile theme make this a solid buy, but not an overwhelming one.
B000002UB3|5.0|It's been applauded and raved about for 34 years now as perhaps the greatest album ever,what more can be said...If your without this album,get it know!!!
B000059XYA|4.0|This is one of the best early 80's action/science-fiction film I have seen. I thought Christopher Reeve was perfect for the role of Superman. The Plot: 3 exiled kryptonian criminals from Krypton: General Zod(Terence Stamp), Non(Jack O'Halloran), &amp; Ursa(Sarah Dougless) are accidently released from THE PHANTON ZONE. Meanwhile Criminal Genius Lex Luthor(Gene Hackman) &amp; his never-do-well sidekick Otis(Ned Beatty) plans to escape from prison, only Lex was able to succed with the help of his girlfriend(Valerie Perrine). Later, the 3 criminals arrive to earth with plans to take over it. Meanwhile, Clark Kent(Christopher Reeve) agrees to abandon his super powers to be with Louis Lane(Margot Kidder), But learns that Zod has taken over the planet, &amp; is forced to retrieve his powers to stop Zod.    <BR>         The music is great, too! Buy this movie
B00003CX97|5.0|After more than forty years, this movie remains one of the great war movies of all time.  It proves that you don't need an enormous budget, a teen idol, and stuff blowing up all over the place to make a World War 2 masterpiece.  The movie centers around a bridge being build by Allied POWs over the Kwai river (hence the title).  Colonel Saito is the man in charge of the bridge, and the British Colonel Nicholson (played by Alec Guinness) is commander of the British POW troops.  An American, Shears (William Holden), escapes from the camp, and later guides a crack British demolitions team back to the site of the bridge so they can blow it up.<br />A large part of the movie centers around the power struggle between Saito and Nicholson.  The latter refuses to be treated harshly, and insists that his British forces will not cooperate in building the bridge unless he and the other officers can lead the project and do not have to do manual labor.  Saito is a hardheaded despot, who cares nothing for Geneva convention rules but is forced to compromise if he wants his bridge finished on time.  Throughout the movie, these two butt heads until they finally reach an understanding, and from that point on they work together very admirably and build a fine bridge.<br />The problem with having built such a spectacular bridge, however (in which Nicholson rightly takes great pride), is that the allies want to blow it up.  At the end of the film, Nicholson is forced to make a choice between his pet project and his loyalty to his country.  The result is a suspensful finale worthy of this great epic production.<br />The scenery is beautiful, the cinematography grand, the performances exceptionally great.  No wonder this film won 7 Oscars.  This is rightly considered one of the best movies ever made.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|What can I say about this album.  It is a gem.  I suggest all of you to get up and run out the door for this one.  The songs on this album aren't necessarily heavier than those on &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; but they are more perfected.  The intro song, &quot;The Package&quot; is a great song, it has that TOOL feeling in the form of A Perfect Circle.  The wailing voice of Maynard fits this song perfectly, and the guitar work is well done.  &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;, well there is enough said about this song, one of the best on the album. These are other songs I enjoyed, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, &quot;The Noose&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Pet&quot;. Well I'm done ranting and raving so go get this album its just as good as &quot;Mer de Noms'.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle recently put out their second studio album (Thirteent Step). I have been waiting for this album for almost 4 years since there first one. I must say it was well worth the wait. <BR>     I love Tool so at first APC was just a holdover until the new tool album dropped. But after hearing Thirteenth Step APC has become a band I love all by themselves. This album takes me to a different place in my mind everytime i experience it. I say experience and not listen because it is more of an experience than just simply hearing music.<BR>     APC has put together, in my opinion, almost an hour of the greatest music i have ever heard. I can't wait to see them live this fall, and recommend all music lovers to experience this masterpiece for yourselves.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|&quot;Worldwide Underground&quot; is an intriguing, fascinating mess of a record.  Delayed for at least a year, it lacks some of the cohesion and focus of Erykah Badu's last two studio albums, particularly 2000's &quot;Mama's Gun,&quot; an underrated classic that literally turned the whole boho soul genre upside down on its head.  Badu hasn't made lightning strike again on &quot;Worldwide Underground,&quot; but there are some solid touches that are worth a listen.  The free-flowing groove of &quot;Back in the Day,&quot; the catchy and memorable &quot;Danger,&quot; the playful &quot;Love of My Life (with Queen Latifah and Angie Stone),&quot; as well as &quot;Bump&quot; pass along nicely and all invite repeat listens.  They're all good slices of the laid back soul we've come to expect, but the EP, as a whole, is as unstructured as Badu's afro wig.  And not everything holds together, especially &quot;I Want You.&quot;  That song has an interesting hook, but when stretched over 10 minutes in length, it overstays its welcome way too soon.  Warts and all, I like and recommend &quot;Worldwide Underground.&quot;  Did she record another &quot;Tyrone&quot; or &quot;On &amp; On?&quot;  Nope.  Did she release a flawed yet solid EP?  Yes.  This is one of those records that may throw you in for a loop on the first listen, but it will ultimately grow on you.  Grade: B.
B00005KHJM|2.0|I had been hearing about this movie for years and just recently watched it. At first I thought it was &quot;unique&quot;. Followed general pagan beliefs pretty well. But after I saw the whole movie I could not understand why everyone talked about it. I thought it was horrible.
B00009MGQL|5.0|The most important quality to this disc is Beck stepping it up and letting his fans hear him push a strat to the limits. Maybe the song structures are not of Blow by Blow quality, but it showcases why there are no other guitar players in the same league. Even Jimmy Page calls Beck the best and Eric who does not even register. This cd has me really wondering what Jimi Hendrix would be up to if he was still alive.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|this is a really good album it is just a little too slow.  it doesnt mean it wont get listened to, i guess i was just hoping for something to outdo mer de noms (which is impossible).  that was a such a crafted album, as is this one.  just crafted differently i suppose.  again, if you are a keenan fan then this is a must have, such a soothing voice.  even when he sings about death, destruction, and overtop heavy distortion his voice just fits.  enough with the babbling...get the album...you'll see
B00007KMP1|5.0|This album is beautiful, sad, introspective, melancholy and soulful.  <br />I originally bought the regular CD and it impressed me with the sound quality.  Then the SACD version came out and I bought it without hesitation even though I already had the red-book standard CD version.  When I heard this album on my SACD player my jaw hit the floor.  This album is the clearest exception to the audiophile rule that if an album is well recorded, the musical content will be as bad as the recording is good.  I've played this album for people that \\"don't like Beck\\", probably because the only song they've ever heard is \\"Loser\\", and every person, EVERY ONE, has bought their own copy.<br />If you own an SACD player, buy the SACD, it's a bargain.  If you don't, buy the regular CD version.  You'll not be disappointed, I promise.
1558216847|4.0|this is one one of the first books i read as far as 'real-life-non-fiction' goes. to be honest i read it several years a go but it is that which helped me delve into the world of non-ficton.  someone suggested it, because i love a travel narrative, and i found it to be one of the best novels-by-way-of-nonfiction i may ever come across.  I have looked far and wide, and there are few( please email me with anything i have missed, if you please, i beg..)i have not read a personal narrative more moving and page-turning as this. you truly won't believe that which you are reading all the way to the very last page! An incredible journey that truly separates the hardship of one or two generations to thenext. we will never experience this desperation and the endurance of their journey shall never be duplicated again in our lifetimews.. reads truly like a page-turning novel.. magnificent!!
B000000OUE|3.0|I enjoy this album, it's fun.  But I wan't all the boys and girls out there to know that good ol' Rob Zombie stole his shtick lock, stock and barrel from Al Jourgensen of Ministry.  This is great stuff to play loud and bang your head, but with lyrics like:  \\"slung low like a whore, devil wants some more, Jesus bought a gun he's gonna blow the f****r...\\"  uhhh... what?  Means nothing, says nothing, sounds great.  <br />If this stuff leaves you wanting more, check out Ministry and hear the real deal.  At least Al has something to say.
0060090383|5.0|rachel's holiday is just another masterful work of marian keyes whereby she captures  your heart and modern sensibility with an ubelievalble knowing and grace.  she really did her homework on this one, she nails the partying addiction as something to be reckoned with, as it should be.  the character of Luke is utterly delicious but also a 'strong and morale force to be reckoned with-solid-as-a-rock-type-save-your-soul'type of man'that wins all of our hearts... it took me several days to get over him!./..rachel's journey is insightful,entertaining(at least), valid, for any of us who has led a lifestyle that might compare.  I Love Marian keyes and I am psyched to read the, unfortunately, 2 last novel that she has written, that i haven't read: angels and sushi for begginers
B000089CJI|5.0|I'm in love. If a guy ever said the words in most of these songs to me, I'd be smitten. The two members of the band incorporate warm female voices and catchy beats with their own voices and music to create such a worthwhile album, I don't know how I lived without their music. Though the last song has a bit of a long and scratchy into, everything else is flawless. Many songs are romantic and can be fun (even if you aren't the romantic type). These guys are able to come up with creative ways to express their emotions, especially in &quot;Clark Gable&quot; and &quot;We Will Become Silhouettes&quot;. But my absolute favorites are &quot;The District Sleeps Alone Tonight&quot;, &quot;Such Great Heights&quot;, and &quot;Brand New Colony&quot;. If you can, I also recommend downloading the video for &quot;Such Great Heights&quot;, reading their bio, and checking out their record label's website ([...] In time, you'll be in love with the Postal Service.
B00005QDW5|3.0|No hardcore fan will take this album seriously- No 'Brain damage' the song that defines Pink Floyd and its missing lotsa goodies icluding some soundtrack stuff,1 more cd would have been good.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I bought this album about 2 months before they became popular. Thus, I had little idea who they were or what they sounded like, and the first time I heard the cd I nearly returned it. Laziness, luckily, prevented that, and on a particularly long airplane flight I learned to love Interpol. Paul has an original voice and the guitar riffs are catchy. Though the album has only 11 short songs, there are some gems. Obstacle 2 is my favorite of theirs, with PDA and Leif Erickson coming in a close second.
0714834491|5.0|This book found me one day and now has me totally in it's pages.<BR>Every little thing that was ever said and every problem ever created has some form of simplistic answer within it. <br />What is Left, Right, Up or Down, Sideways Backwards, Full or Empty has some form answer and deffernce to it.  But then again what is It?<br />All those funny sayings that pass our lips everyday are included and a full on assult on your brain senses really makes the old grey matter think.  It is a book to be picked up and put down as you simply cannot read it through without causing your brain to pass out!!!
B00006RU5B|2.0|I was a bit disappointed with this album. After all the fuss &quot;Like a Stone&quot; got on MTV and such, I figured the album would be impressive. It's as if they were trying to please everyone. Some songs are angry and cynical, others are mushy and metaphorical. Good bands are able to easily attract people on different levels with one cd, but this was not one of those bands. Of course, &quot;Like a Stone&quot; was okay and &quot;I Am the Highway&quot; is pretty good, but the rest of the album isn't worth listening to. Go buy some Radiohead instead.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|First the negatives: lousy cover art- I loathe computer graphics. Why not do a contest for fan art submissions next time? Title track is overlong and mediocre, and some of the time signatures are too fast in that song (still not a bad tune and far better than the best new Metallica song). Now the POSITIVES: BNW was a steller return for Maiden, an instant classic, so DOTD has a tough act to follow. The boys have not let this Maiden fan down! Lots of great stuff here, Bruce is, as usual, amazing, the guitar work is killer and the songs are classic Maiden-cool. I absolutely LOVE &quot;Rainmaker&quot;, &quot;Gates Of Tomorrow&quot;, &quot;Montsegur&quot; and &quot;No More Lies&quot; (&quot;Gates&quot; has a powerhouse hook of a chorus) and the others are solid Maiden; &quot;Paschendale&quot; is HEAVY and I dig the verse tapping riff. Also dig the lyrics to 'Age Of Innocence&quot;; if I lived in the UK, I'd feel this way about their problems with crime/home invasions and their stupid liberal gun restrictions and bleeding heart kid-glove treatment of scumbag criminals (not to mention the asinine UK law I've heard about that goes easy on mothers who murder their infants, but I shant go there at the moment).<BR>Bottom line: Maiden are still THE classic metal band and have proven that they can wipe the floor with anyone in the genre (especially Metallica). I love this lineup (Gers is a terrific player and songwriter) and hope they keep at it for years to come. A quality metal album is a rare thing these days and I thank God for the boys in Maiden for keeping the faith!
B000069KE0|5.0|I bought this CD a couple months ago and fell in love with it.  I have always been a big Chicago fan, but didnt have this CD, and let me tell you, I was MISSING OUT!!  There is not a song on this CD I dont like.  The real gem, however, on this CD, is the &quot;Ballet For a Girl In Buchanon&quot;  This &quot;medley&quot; contains the hits &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; and &quot;Colour My World&quot; along with lesser known componets of the Ballet such as &quot;So Much To Say, So Much To Give&quot; a trumpet solo from the legendary Lee Loughnane on &quot;Anxiety's Moment&quot; and Lee's duet with the talented Walter Parazaider on flute in &quot;West Virginia Fantasies&quot;.  &quot;It Better End Soon&quot; really has the rythm section &quot;cooking&quot; and &quot;The Road&quot; and &quot;In The Country&quot; have melodies you just cant seem to get out of your head.  &quot;Poem For The People&quot; has a hornline that will just send shivers down your spine.<br />So for those of you sitting on the fence about this CD, I encourage you to BUY IT!! You won't be dissapointed!!  I will easily say this is one of the best CD's I have ever bought, from the greatest band ever created!
B00005OM4N|1.0|If you look in the dictionary for the word sellout,you will find a picture of britney and p diddy.I cant even begin to describe how awful this cd is.All the music on this cd sounds the same as all of her previous records and is very boring.She is now resorting to selling her sexuality to appeal to a wider audience.Who does she think she is fooling?All the mtv sheep out there probably have this album since they dont have minds of their own.She butchers the classic song \\"I love rock n roll\\" just to provide filler songs on her album.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM HER!!!
B000000WCV|5.0|Finaly a team of DJ's and samplers who actaully know what<BR>their doing.Every cut on &quot;Homework&quot; emphasises dancibility above<BR>all else.&quot;Teachers&quot; even offers a funky shout-out to every artist<BR>known and unknwon who influenced the two and of course &quot;Around The World&quot; is &quot;Around the World&quot;.The memorable &quot;Fresh&quot; <BR>and &quot;Pheonix also stand out,even ammong a little indulgent DJ<BR>turntable noodling here and there.But no matter how they do it<BR>it seems Daft Funk would be a better name because these tracks<BR>GET DOWN!!
B00004SCX6|1.0|When will people realise that this little girl is all image and no substance.Dont get me wrong,she's veru cute but she cant sing for beans.All the lyrics are very cheesy and she probably didnt write any of them.She is just a puppet of the record industry and she lacks any originality.Why would anybody with half a brain purchase a 20 dollar cd thats only really worth 3 dollars.All this girl really cares about is using your money to shop for clothes and to act like a snobby brat.I dont understand why people support her when she clearly could care less about her fans.She needs to grow up because she doesnt know how the world really is.DO NOT BUY ANYTHING FROM THIS COMMERCIAL PRINCESS!!!
B000001AJG|5.0|Believe it or not this album may in fact BE Stevie Wonder<br />creating his own statement of intent.A musical journey emcopassing soul,sentimental balladry,classical and traditional<br />Chinese and varrious world music &quot;The Secret Life Of Plants&quot; is<br />an overly peaceful album so grunge fans BEWARE!Especially on<br />&quot;Power Flower&quot; and &quot;Send One Your Love&quot; this album is full of<br />gentle,pastoral musical backdrops and rose-colored sentiments.<br />It does tend to give one confidance that there is still a great<br />deal of beauty left in the world.Only that this album suffers in<br />the tempo department as only the incoherant &quot;Race Babbling&quot;,the<br />rousing &quot;Tree&quot; and the funny &quot;Venus Flytrap And The Bug&quot; are the<br />albums highest tempo numbers here.Personally much of my sentiments are expressed here but one simply has to take what is<br />here in for themselfs-the album is very all-encompassing.
B000002H6C|4.0|While there are some production issues with this album, Metallica shows their true colors this time around, and even without Cliff Burton (RIP), they manage to pull off a masterpiece that was characteristic of their career up until the mid-90s.  The new bassist doesn't contribute much, but he got better in time for the black album.  The title track is undoubtedly the best song on this CD, but every other track is worthy of your listening time.  I personally feel &quot;One&quot; is one of their more overrated tracks, but it's got good lyrics, and while it sounds just a little too folkish at times for my tastes, it's still a very good song.  See, at one time Metallica was able to produce a high-quality album, instead of the nu-metal they make these days.  If you haven't already gotten your hands on a copy of this, I invite you to do so now.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Wow, great stuff and Sandy Castle does the art work.
B00006CXXU|5.0|I am a big fan of Christina Aguilera. When I heard she was making a new CD I was so happy. First I saw the music video &quot;Dirrty&quot;, I knew that the CD was gonna be good. Then I saw the music video &quot;Beautiful&quot;, Another masterpiece. Then I saw the best music video &quot;Fighter&quot;. I totally fell in love when I heard that song, Cause I can relate to it. Then I decided that I wanted that CD. It was the best CD I have ever heard since &quot;Thankful&quot;. Anyone who thinks this CD sucks, They are so wrong!!!!!!!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|When I downloaded this album (it comes out a week later than it does in America where I live) I doubted it would last more than 24 hours on my computer.  I wasn't at all impressed with A Perfect Circle's debut album 'Mer De Noms', which sounded to me like a gutless attempt at something that sounded like Tool or Nine Inch Nails.  I began listening to this one with only a vague interest.<br />However, after I'd heard what this album had to offer, I decided that this album would find its way onto my purchase list (it comes out here tomorrow).  This is an excellent album, a totally different and more mature sound than Mer De Noms offered.  It does suffer from having two filler tracks, which would be easily bearable had they been spaced further apart, but they are both at the end of the album, robbing it of a strong finish.  However, The non-filler tracks are all so good that I can't really bring myself to care.<br />But, I have now discovered that in all countries other than America the CD will include copy protection (I assume that APC have influence enough to exert some pressure on the record companies in the USA, but not enough to get their way throughout the world).  This copy protection is well known to mess with about 90% of CD players, and none of mine are exactly state-of-the-art.  So I think I'll wait until I can thoroughly test a copy on my players before I shell out my hard earned money.<br />Which seems to be where the record companies have gotten it all wrong.  People may be listening to more music, but they're still buying the same amount as they were before MP3s came along.  And, as is the case here, the wider distribution of music can boost their sales.  For most of us, there's still a pretty clear distinction between MP3s and albums.  Maybe if you just stick your copy protection on Justin Timberlake's next album, and rely on the loyalty of us NIN and APC fans to keep your sales up.
0393317552|5.0|I loved this book! It starts at the beginning presenting a history of human evolution that rings true for me.  The book is divided into different subject areas all designed to support the theory that the Eur-Asian continent provided white men with significant advantages over folks on continents that are taller than they are wide. The book includes the progression of man from hunter-gatherers to farming, the qualities that make a good domestic animal (cow), the origins of the written word, etc.  He supports his theories with an abundance of research which at times caused me to think &quot;I'm sold. Let's move on.&quot;  Overall it was an easy read and the information was valuable on so many levels.

With Mogget, a free magic spirit imprsoned in the body of a cat to serve the Abhorsen generations, Sabriel must defeat what the last few Abhorsens could not. How will she accomplish this, bringing back the Old Kingdom at the same time?<br />With her talent, Sabriel shall rise to capture even the attention of even those who read little. Garth Nix has truely accomplished a majestic work of art. I reccoment this to all ages, whether child or adult or inbetween, this is one book to definately read. I have loved this book since I began reading it, many years ago and it has become an absolute favorite, right next to LOTR and In the Forests of the Night. As the first in the Abhorsen trilogy, it's a must read.
B00008JLKL|2.0|I am really sorry Mr. Levi but you can't mix your 2 previous albums and claim It's a brand new stuff.<BR>I guess I'll have to wait for your next album.<BR>I hope that you will understand that people do expect brand new songs, each time they buy one of your records.
B00007L4MJ|5.0|I've been waiting for this release for what seems like ever, after first seeing it at the Angelika with some friends in Greenwich Village.<br />The effects are breathtaking, even today.
B00004Y6Q5|4.0|This soundtrack has great expressive capability, due to the<br />ability of the Kronos Quartet. Although somewhat of a Philip Glass rip off, Mansell deserves attention for his effective application of minimalist styles in his compositions.<br />Overall, this is a solid, worthy score.
B00004TDTO|5.0|I don't think anybody that goes in the ocean today can not help but think of the music of JAWS!! This time Hollywood made a great movie from a so-so book!  A shark has attack and killed people on the beach! Then After a 3rd victim it becomes a showdown at sea!
B00006EXL5|5.0|This band is amazing. Their music is passionate yet sloppy, but very unique. In this generation most of these types of bands sound very similar if not exactly the same. My chemical romance is a wonderful band with deep music that will blow you away. Highly recommended for anyone that likes originality.

B000001ESN|5.0|This is clearly one of the best RUSH cd's ever made. Especially remastered, the sound on this is incredible. I saw the concert for this recording live, and they were at the peak of their talent during this period. YOU MUST BUY THIS CD !!!
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Wouldn't you know it. I finally decide to review a band that most people would know about and it already has seven reviews and it's only been out three days. Oh well, I'm going to do it anyway as a counterpoint.<br />I did it again. I bought a Cd by an American Band, albeit not one of my favorites but with Maynard James Keenan from one of my favorites, Tool, only to be disappointed. I know it's not Tool but I was hoping. It's not that there aren't any good numbers on the album. Let's just say there is a paucity of interesting songs. (...)<br />Thirteenth Step<br />An alternate name for this album could be 'Two Step', because that, it seems, is what you could do to most of this album. There were no lyrics within the packaging and it's too new to pull the lyrics off the internet, so I will dispense with any examples and comments about the lyrics.<br />Song / Track List<br />1. The Package (Howerdel/Keenan) - 7:40 ****<br />2. Weak and Powerless (Howerdel/Keenan) - 3:15 ***<br />3. The Noose (Howerdel/Keenan) - 4:53 ***<br />4. Blue (Howerdel/Keenan) - 4:13 ***<br />5. Vanishing (Howerdel/Keenan) - 4:51 ****<br />6. A Stranger (Howerdel/Keenan) - 3:12 *<br />7. The Outsider (Howerdel/Keenan) - 4:06 ****<br />8.

Lullaby (Howerdel/Keenan) - 2:01 *<br />12. Gravity (Freese/Howerdel/Keenan/Lenchantin/Van Leeuwen) - 5:08 ***<br />\\"The Package\\" has it's boring moments but it does pick up nicely about two thirds of the way through. Starts out sounding like someone is building something in the background then switches to a slow bluesy beat, until the 4:10 mark when we get some heavy guitar life. Good stuff, but to late to make this song a five star.<br />\\"Weak and Powerless\\" is a medium paced song with a plucky beat, not bad but nothing special.<br />\\"The Noose\\" is pretty much a ballad. now I sometimes like ballads but this didn't get it for me<br />\\"Blue\\" is another two step piece similar to the \\"The Noose\\" with a medium slow tempo featuring the typical guitars and drums<br />\\"Vanishing\\" has an interesting slow medium beat and some interesting background sound effects and a slight ethereal feel. One of the better songs!<br />\\"A Stranger\\" doesn't do anything for me! Call it psychedelic folk/ethereal/industrial<br />The Outsider\\" is another good song, which does give me the distinct feel of Tool. Medium fast varies throughout and has good drums and a whinning guitar.<br />\\"Crimes\\" is a short moderately interesting instrumental, which starts out like Queen's we will rock you<br />\\"The Nurse who Loved Me\\" another two step ballad, which sounds like it was sung through a megaphone. I really don't like this Gong Show song.<br />\\"Pet\\" gets my vote for best song. Has a nice varied pace and again reminds me of Alice in Chains as well as<br />Tool which is, of course, what I was after. Nice howling guitar effect on this one.<br />\\"Lullaby\\" another 'Bomb'<br />\\"Gravity\\" is a medium slow blusey rock piece with a reasonably catchy tune and beat<br />A Perfect Circle is a side project of Tool's main man, Maynard James Keenan and former guitar tech Billy Howerdel. Thirteenth Step is their second release, their first being Mer de Noms released in 2000.<br />Conclusion<br />I'm afraid this cd will either be resold as a used cd or relegated to my seldom played 'B' CD tower. Yes there are some good songs but I've got a lot of more consistent CDs with more good songs to listen too.

B00002MZ4W|5.0|I love this CD. I've had it for a year and I still listen to it constantly. Fiona Apple sings with such power and such conviction, and it her music aches with realism. My favorite song would have to be &quot;I Know.&quot; I love the song. I love the jazz feel to it, and how it seems so mellow, yet is so heart-breaking, especially with the ending lines: &quot;If you find you love me/ Then tell me so...&quot; It's such a perfect and such a telling song. &quot;Paper Bag&quot; is just as good. I love the beat, but I love the lyrics even more: &quot;I thought he was a man/ but he was just a little boy...&quot; It's excellent. &quot;I Know&quot; and &quot;Paper Bag&quot; are reasons alone why the CD should be bought, and that's not even touching on the other 8 songs. &quot;Fast As You Can&quot; is so different, with such a strange beat behind it. I find it so cool how it switches from the fast beat feel to the jazzy crooning. It's another song with amazing lyrics that I found to be so easy to relate to. &quot;Love Ridden&quot; is a powerful love ballad that makes you ache right along with her over her lost love. &quot;Get Gone&quot; has a strange power to it; it starts out sounding like a love ballad but quickly switches over to a powerful sound and her belting out that her lover doesn't care about her and how she doesn't know what to do anymore. A perfect, perfect song for any girl who has been slighted or used by a guy. To me, these were the high points of the CD. &quot;On the Bound,&quot; &quot;To Your Love,&quot; &quot;The Way Things Are,&quot; and &quot;A Mistake&quot; are great songs too, and this CD is definitely worth the buy.
B00009XITP|5.0|I saw this at the theatre and could not wait to buy it.  It is a great movie for all ages.  My children little and big loved it and so did I.
B00005JKZV|5.0|This is superb  - just as Tollers (as the author was known affectionately in Oxford) would have wanted it. It really is that good. Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (and a graduate of Oxford, Tolkien's old university)
0385504209|1.0|I actually couldn't bring myself to finish this book.  I got about 3/4 of the way through it and had to stop because I got so tired of all the mumbo jumbo and conspiracy theory.  And if you really look at the theories, they don't make any sense.  What this book failed to even acknowledge is that Christianity isn't based on proof.  It's based on faith.  Even though I believe that there is proof of Jesus Christ's existence and identity, more than anything I believe in the joy and love that he has put into my heart through a relationship with him.  As far as I'm concerned this is nothing more than propoganda itself.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I would definitely have to say that I approached watching a musical with a small amount of trepidation; but this trepidation was quickly washed away as I found that &quot;Chicago&quot; was nothing less than a thoroughly enjoyable and entertaining film to watch.  Although there have been many films that I've completely enjoyed watching, I cannot remember the last time I watched a movie that had me smiling the whole way through.  Despite the basic nature of this film being grounded in murder and those who committed it doing whatever they can to get out of it, the way in which the story was written within a musical just makes it so hilarious you'll find yourself just happily enjoying this film all the way to the credits at the end.<br />It is absolutely no wonder to me at all that this film won six Academy awards, all of which were well deserved.  I believe it takes an unusual and refreshing film like this to win that many Academy awards.<br />Renee Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones, Richard Gere, Queen Latifah, John C. Reilly and Lucy Liu all deserve extraordinary praise for their respective performances in this exceptional film.  I've read and heard that several people weren't too impressed with Richard Gere's singing and dancing which is an opinion I don't share.  Who knew that this big star could and or would do singing and dancing on film; I thought his performance was great.<br />Director Rob Marshall deserves nothing but the highest praise and accolades for bringing this brilliant film to the theaters and DVD format.  Chicago is nothing less, in this reviewer's opinion, than the best musical ever made!<br />To be perfectly honest, I'm not a huge musical fan, but this film and the sound track for it is just so enjoyable you don't have to be a huge musical fan to enjoy the film and the performances by these great actors.<br />The premise:<br />The setting for this film is Chicago in the twenties which makes it the perfect setting for the entire film as it is learnedin the &quot;Behind the Scenes&quot; special that it is somewhat ground in the true story of several women killing their husbands or boyfriends and the huge media blitz over their trials.  Taking that into consideration and the timing of the film, being in the twenties when women were struggling for more rights, you have all the ingredients for the plot of &quot;Chicago&quot; and then throw in the musical aspect and then throw in several exceptional actors and actresses and you have &quot;Chicago.&quot;<br />Renee Zellweger plays Roxie Hart who is a naïve young woman married to an older, blue collar working man who is gone all day.  Take that aspect and her &quot;intense&quot; desire to be on stage doing her jazz singing and dancing.  Being a bored housewife, she hooks up with a little side action in the form a furniture salesman who feeds her a huge line about getting her hooked up with somebody at the local jazz club.  After several weeks of believing his line about getting her on stage, he finally becomes tired of her nagging and tells her he's just a furniture salesman and doesn't know anybody at the club.  She becomes so distraught about being lied to that she whips out a thirty eight and puts him down right at the front door.<br />Her poor sap husband, played so brilliantly by John C. Reilly initially tries to take the blame for her, right up to the point in which he finds out that the body laying at the front door was the guy who sold them their furniture and boom, he drops the story and off to jail goes Roxie.  It's in jail that she meets up with Matron &quot;Mama&quot; Morton (Queen Latifah) and Velma Kelly who is played so brilliantly by Catherine Zeta-Jones who seems to have been born for singing and dancing.  Velma has been in jail for some time now after the films exceptional opening with her on stage singing and dancing &quot;All that Jazz.&quot;  It seems she found her sister in the bed with her husband and she whacked the both of them.  Richard Gere shows up not too long after that as Billy Flynn, the big shot lawyer in Chicago that has never lost a case.<br />What follows from there is nothing less than the best musical to hit the silver screen in years that will have you smiling from ear to ear from the very opening of the film to the credits.  I highly recommend this exceptional film to any and all, whether you're a fan of musicals or not, you will enjoy &quot;Chicago.&quot;  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features<br />- Deleted Musical Number &quot;Class&quot; Performed by Catherine Zeta-Jones &amp; Queen Latifah<BR>- Behind The Scenes Special<BR>- Director &amp; Screenwriter Feature Commentary
B0000AXM3N|3.0|Firstly, I must say, I love the CD. Different from Mer De Nom, Thirteenth Step is much more mellow. The single &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; is the &quot;heaviest&quot; song on the CD. <br />The CD itself is not my main reason for posting this review, I feel I should inform the consumer of what they're buying when they get this CD.<br />The Thirteenth Step is COPY PROTECTED. What does this mean? The CD is a data disc, it may not play in older stereos and certain CD players. Also, its designed to be unrippable, meaning no mp3s. My CD-ROM couldn't rip the tracks, but my DVD-drive was able to rip the tracks just fine (lucky I guess). Shame on the record companies for deciding how the consumer should listen to thier music. <br />The US copy is apparently non-protected, so if you're aching to make mp3s (I own a MiniDisc so I need the mp3 format), you might be better off ordering from the US.<br />5 stars for the CD, minus 2 stars for the copy protection. 3 stars overall.
B0000931QR|5.0|This cd is just as good as the two past ones. I really enjoy all of the tracks. It has the same feeling and tunes as the previous one, but this one carries a lot of interesting lyrics and stories that go along with them.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I love this album. LOVE IT. This album has a slightly different feel than Mer De Noms. Most of the expected string instrumentation seems to have been replaced with acoustic guitar, but the result is fantastic. My only complaint is that the album doesnt seem to flow as well as their previous effort. Tracks alternate between slow tempo acoustic works (A Stranger), to almost radio friendly pop-rock (Blue), and back to crunchy, eight minute, tool-esqe epics (The Package). Doesnt seem to be a whole lot of order to the track arrangement. And while I don't love the album quite the way I loved Mer De Noms, there are a few tracks I can honestly say are their best work to date. My absolute favorite being the anti-war/anti-US foreign policy/anti-government anthem &quot;Pet&quot;. I'm a diehard Tool fan, and yet, lyrically, I think &quot;Pet&quot; may be the best song Maynard has ever written. Absolutely-freaking brilliant. Buy Thirteenth Step. Well worth the money. An abslolute must have for Tool and APC fans alike.
B00004XOWM|3.0|as i dont hate fred but it seems like hes just trying to sell music instead of have it pour from the heart and all that jazz. first cd was a bit heavier , this one fell off a bit into radio friendly and the third , i dont know [what] happend .the third has some nice songs but im not sure if hes just trying to sell or be heard .
B00008DDXC|1.0|I do not wanna be the only saying that this film is bad but it just is the acting is repetitive and poor the closest thing you get to action is them in a car that flies and that scene is dull if you want to avoid ripping your hair out then avoid this!
B000059ZLH|4.0|First, the sound on this DVD is pretty shabby.  Surprising for &quot;Dolby Digital&quot; even if this is 2 channel...  Glad to see someone else mentioned this.  I am thinking Dream Theater needs to reissue this with full DD, 5.1 surround and do a little tweaking on the recording.  Maybe even DTS??  Could we be so lucky?  Should we fans start a letter-writing campaign?<br />Heck - if Zeppelin can do what they did with 30+ yr old VIDEO AND MUSIC, DT, with more recent footage recorded with current technology, should be able to surpass LZ's amazing feat of engineering prowess.  All of this talk about DT's engineer and he puts out a DVD that sounds as weak as this?!<br />Anyway - back to the hidden feature.  You can find &amp; watch the casting call for the hypnotherapist by going to the color bars and let them run for 5-6 mins..  Fast forward &amp; you'll see it.<br />Have fun!<br />Artofshredfl@aol.com
B000067CPX|2.0|This album could of been great following the old rap hip hop rock style but instead they come up with a pop album the only thing close to rap and rock are Miner Thing and Can't stop the other tracks will make you scream!<BR>All the tracks are kinda the same the vocalist uses the same tones of voice on every track which gets soo boring.<BR>To be fair when i got the album i did think it was alright but this just a 1 hour wonder so i can only give this album a 2 star!
B0000AM6LY|2.0|back in the 80's I use to  really dig Simply Red but as time wore on I noticed they got stuck in a formula&haven't changed one bit.now Mick Hucknall is a Cat that I respect His Vocals but even he can't make Average Material sound Good.since the 80's they have had songs that I have dug but nothing I'd break the Bank for.this Album is fairly run of the Mill&they have done far better in the past.
B00005JLSE|1.0|See above. I've seen Roxy Hart and although I adore Ginger Rogers, that wasn't a good movie either. All of these characters are despicable and unlikable. I've never written a review of a movie before but this was so bad I had to vent.
B0000AR8NK|2.0|David Bowie had a solid 70's run&then came back for a minute in the Mid 80's but since then He hasn't been able to find that touch at picking good material.this album follows a line of Half-Baked cuts that at best might be worthy of B-Sides but don't merit Album tracks.I got to Hear this set recently&just wasn't feeling it.
B00008EY9G|5.0|Excellent Movie for those who like to guess 'who dun it' before getting to the end.  Riveting, you won't want to miss anything and about the time you're sure you know who did it, you discover that isn't possible.  Also a very refreshing change of pace from what you might expect.  Some gore, you might not want the kids to see it till you do.  This is my first review and this movie was good enough and different enough to take the time. enjoy.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Maiden is usually a good band, a really good band. This just makes that statement more true. This CD is by far the best this fall. The solos are great and Nico(as usual) is great on his drums. My favorite song on here is &quot;Rainmaker&quot;. This one really blows the competion out of the park. &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; is a good single and the surprise of the album was &quot;Journeyman&quot;. I really like that one. As usual, the title track rocks. Dance of Death is a solid, and promising album. Maiden totally delivered on this one. UP THE IRONS!!! <br />Wildest Dreams- A-<BR>Rainmaker     - A+<BR>No More Lies  - A<BR>Motseguer     - B+<BR>Dance Of Death- A<BR>Gates Of Tomo.- B-<BR>New Frontier  - A-<BR>Paschendale   - A+<BR>Face in Sand  - B-<BR>Age Of Innoce.- B-<BR>Jorneyman     - A+ <br />Keep It Comin Maiden!!!!!
0676973779|5.0|If you're looking for a different kind of read, I recommend this novel. It is so adventurous you'll feel like you're eleven again reading your first adventure novel! Another book that I highly recommend is &quot;HE NEVER Called Again.&quot; Enjoy!
0385504209|1.0|Drivel, pure drivel.  Here's a tip, if you are setting out to write a fast paced caper where the charcters must solve coded messages to advance the story, the &quot;codes&quot; should be more complex than those found in the &quot;jumble&quot; in the newspaper or &quot;mirror writing&quot; used in my son's weekly reader.  I solved the three main codes in less than a minute each, but our expert cryptologist and religious symbolist aggonized over them for several pages.  Also, the author is oblivious to the facts and folklore that provide the backdrop of his book. As just one example, the Holy Grail derived from an earlier pagan legend about a magic cauldron, not the idea suggested by the author. This is the worst book I have read in ages.  If you want a good novel about the theft of a sacred relic and the follower's pursuant to retrieve the relic, try Wilkie Collin's &quot;The Moonstone&quot;
0688172377|5.0|This is a book sure to stick in your mind. This is the autobiography of Waris Dirie, who grew up as a desert nomad in Somalia, suffered female genital mutilation, and became an international model and United Nations ambassador. Waris proves to be headstrong and smart, with a deep sense of who she is and where she comes from. She's the best heroine you could find, and best of all - she's real. (A+)
B000008HPE|5.0|Fore! was the album that really turned me on to Huey Lewis back in 1987. Songs like Hip to be Square and Stuck With You would still fit in today, while Jacob's Ladder is a forgotten smash with a soaring tempo. Filled with memorable radio-friendly tunes that dominated Top-40 radio back in 1986/87, Fore! remains a very worthy follow-up to Sports, and I highly recommend it to any new (or veteran!) HLN fan. <br />One question though: Where is the rest of the band? The cover photo for the CD was cut in half compared to the original cassette release in 1986. I couldn't help but notice that.
B00005JLEX|5.0|SEINFELD IS ONE OF MY TOP FAVORITE SIT-COMS OF ALL TIME. THE FACT THAT IT IS A SHOW ABOUT \\"NOTHING\\" AND CAME OUT TO BE ONE FUNNY \\"SOMETHING\\" IS A FEAT IN ITSELF. TOTALLY HILARIOUS. I CAN'T IMAGINE WHY THE COMPLETE SERIES IS STILL NOT ON DVDS???!!!
B00005YW4H|1.0|Sleepy CD that sounds like everything else you here on the radio.  All the songs are the same, and nothing ever changes about her musical styles or the songs she's singing.  <br />There are much better CDs to spend your money on.  Don't buy the Grammy hyped CD.  Spend it on something better. I wish I could give it zero stars, but they don't make that!!!
B000002UAR|5.0|This is without question the best album composed by the Beatles, and is in contention for the best album of all time. Songs like &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot;, &quot;Taxman&quot;, as well as &quot;And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; are great. Another great song on this album that is frequently overlooked is &quot;Got To Get You Into My Life.&quot; Although this is one of the less insightful songs on the album it is still a great song<br />Do yourself a favour and pick up this album.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I was reading other reviews and nobody seems to mention the huge contrast Gaspar No is making between brutality and violence that is out there around us, and beauty and purity of a new life that lies in Monica Bellucci's womb. This movie is absolutely AMAZING and full of meaning if you think about it. Of course there are a lot of people that didn't understand the meaning of the movie, but this movie is not made for somebody who does not understand the art of film making.
B00000JCOV|4.0|Slipknot is a band to be reckoned with. Their debut album is a perfect example of how insane these guys really are. They have one of the heaviest, most incredible forms of metal around today in their music. And it's just so awesome you feel the need to start headbanging to it, or maybe go out and break something. I urge you not to miss out on this.
B000002N3J|5.0|&quot;Something To Remember&quot; is a compilation of Madonna's favorite ballads recorded through her career.  She expresses a softer side besides what she usually expresses on her upbeat songs.  This was crutial being that this was released before motherhood.  Some tracks were hits, some were just album tracks, but all are sung from her heart.  Madonna recorded three new tracks: &quot;I Want You&quot;(originally recorded by Marvin Gaye), &quot;One More Chance&quot;, and the hit single &quot;You'll See&quot;.  &quot;I Want You&quot;, recorded with Massive Attack, offers a taste of her upcoming techno sound.  Though a compilation, this gives the audience a taste of her life through the years.  Fans of Madonna will love &quot;Something To Remember&quot;, important material for all Madonna fans.
B00008DDHY|5.0|An emotionally crushing recreation of the infamous January 30, 1972 clash between British troops and Irish protesters in the town of Derry, which led to the deaths of dozens of civilian marchers.  \\"Clash\\" is perhaps too strong a word -- this film (as well as several abortive inquiries) makes a strong case that the testosterone-amped British \\"para\\" soldiers simply went berserk and shot people at random, in hopes of \\"teaching them a lesson they'd never forget.\\"  The distinction between IRA warmongers and the civilian civil rights movement was apparently lost of the embattled English, but their actions at Derry helped lock the Catholic-Protestant feud into place right up to the present day.  Filmically, this is an impressive work: the documentary-style handheld camera work, which seems a bit mannered and distracting in the first part of the film, pays off handsomely when the violence starts -- the fear and chaos of the event is made palpable in a suprisingly visceral manner... it's like a punch to the gut when the shooting starts.... and then it worsens and keeps on going for what seems like an eternity.  Regardless of what you think of the filmmaker's political slant, the skill with which they built this film's dramatic impact is undeniable.  Viewers will have to make up their own minds about what they believe actually happened that day, but this film proides a convincing argument on behalf of the civilian victims. Highly recommended.
0671027387|3.0|Unfortunately, I read this book after The Da Vinci Code, Angels &amp; Demons and Digital Fortress.  The books were read in that order and provided diminishing entertainment returns.<br />Brown's two best books are Da Vinci and Angels &amp; Demons.  Digital Fortress is a bit geeky, but still a pretty good read.<br />Deception Point, in contrast to all of the above, is a bit dull and formula driven.<br />The good news it that Brown's latest book is his best one yet.
B00005JMCN|5.0|Highly recommended - NOT just for the horse-lover either!  Wonderful film.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|The Matrix Reloaded is, quite possibly, the worst movie ever made.  My friends and I, all Matrix fans ourselves, went to see the earliest possible screening of this aborted mess.  And we wanted to like it.  That is to say we cautiously wanted to like it.  None of us is a big fan of martial arts movies, and that was exactly what we feared The Matrix Reloaded would turn out to be.  But, instead, it was so worse.  I kept my mouth shut, determined not to ruin my friend's enjoyment, until the moment when the little Chinese man says to Neo \\"You can never truly know someone until you fight them.\\"  WHAT?  That is the stupidest, cheesiest faux-philosophical line I've ever heard.  A lot of people want to say that it is \\"The Phantom Menace Reloaded.\\"  And how dare those people?  The Phantom Menace had its problems, but this movie is just AWFUL.  The special effects look like they came code-for-code out of some nintendo64 game and the story, well, what story is there really to speak of?  It is all a bunch of stupid diversionary stuff (i.e.- The Marovingian) which does nothing to advance the story in any way.  The first one is a pretty good, if somewhat overrated, movie.  The second is just, simply, a terrible movie.  It has no story, no deep philosophical meaning, and no good action sequences.  The only real mystery surrounding The Matrix is why on earth people actually like this junk.  Seriously, it is so bad it makes me want to vomit all over everyone who likes it.
B00003CX95|5.0|this movie is the best ever!!!! if i could give it 6 stars i would!!!
B0000ACY0Y|5.0|When The Byrds reunited for Asylum Records there was the hope that the original quintet would recapture the magic they generated with their first couple of albums. It didn't happen. While The Byrds (which is still out of print)suffered from an overabundance of ambition, production and egos, Clark's solo effort for Asylum had all the ambition and production of the previusly mentioned album but with the inspiration necessary to pull it off.<br />This is Clark's most &quot;produced&quot; effort. For that very reason, there are some Byrds and Clark fans that can't stand it. Looking past the ambitious production, the songs are what really matter. At its core, No Other features some of Clark's most sublime material. Many folks have compared it to Van Morrison's Astral Weeks but I'd venture to compare it to Lennon's Imagine. The heartache, pure emotion and powerful performances at the core of the album benefit from the production.<br />Rhino has done a terrific job of remastering the album. While I can't detect a huge sonic difference between this and the fine Collector's Choice edition, it does benefit from the inclusion of alternate versions and a bonus track not available on a legit CD before.<br />Gene Clark was always the most vunerable of The Byrds. That was reflected in his powerful, emotional songs as much as his emotionally naked vocals. It's about time that this great album got the deluxe treatment it deserves. Certainly if you're a Byrds/Clark fan pick this up. Even if you're not, it's well worth purchasing. Like Neil Young's wounded On the Beach, No Other is a classic album that stands outside of its time but was also made at the wrong time. Perhaps it'll finally get some appreciation.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|It may not be as thematically whole as such classics as &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot; or &quot;Heroes,&quot;  but it has an urgent eclecticism that reminds this listener of &quot;Alladin Sane.&quot;   Still, this album sounds distinctly modern, never nostalgic, although there is a certain melancholic and elegiac tone to some of these songs.  Highlights include great pop/rock songs like &quot;Never Get Old,&quot; &quot;New Killer Star,&quot;&quot;Days&quot;; an outrageous and funny reworking of Jonathan Richman's &quot;Pablo Picasso&quot; and &quot;The Loneliest Guy&quot; which sound like a dark torch song crossed with haiku poetry.   The album's audacious masterpiece is the closing epic jazz-tinged ballad &quot;Bring Me The Disco King &quot; -- as compelling and oblique a song as Bowie has ever written.  It's beautifully sung, and mesmerizing.  A stunning end to a distinct and compelling collection of songs by an artist who, after this and last year's &quot;Heathen,&quot; is demonstrating that he has a lot more to say and explore than most artists of any era.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Hello all. My name is Adrienne, and I'm ashamed to sayt that I'm a new APC fan. I downloaded Mer de noms and loved it, then I bought this cd, and loved how they fused mellow sounds with angry, strong rock feelings. I love their drummer Josh Freese, and I think I'm gonna be one of their fans for a life time. I love their lead singers voice. I just hope that you all enjoy it. And to vouch for one of the other review, 9 and 11 aren't really that great to listen to.(Sorry Josh!!!)
B00008J4P5|5.0|Amazing.  50 years in, we still can have new Greatest Album of All Time.  No disrespect to Abbey Road, but if anyone deserves it it's these guys.  The slide guitar solo on &quot;I want to be the boy to warm your mother's heart&quot; makes life worth living.  And the solo on &quot;black math&quot; puts even white light/white heat YES white light/white heat-era VU to shame.  Call them phonies, but remember that rock and roll is 50% music and 50% image.  Somehow THEIR black math makes that equal about 120% of rock and roll bliss
B00006F83Y|5.0|Queens of the Stone Age most recent album, titled \\"Songs for the Deaf\\", begins with the rather lengthy titled \\"You Think I Ain't Worth A Dollar, But I Feel Like A Millionaire\\". The song begins with the sound of an engine turning over, and the sounds of a radio being dialed into KLON Radio. An annoying disc jockey introduces us to the \\"saga\\", and the song begins. We hear a faint sound of drums, followed by a simple guitar riff. Both are quiet, but the listener can almost taste what is coming next. Suddenly, WHAM, it hits you like a ton of bricks. Josh Homme's alternating screaming and singing brings a chaotic edge to an already chaotic song, singing nonsense like \\"Space Flunky/ Four on the floor/ Fortified with the liquor store\\". The song is harsh, violent, and bloody awesome. Already it becomes obvious that these guys like to rock hard, and you're in for a ride. <br />The song ends, and the band's first single, \\"No One Knows\\", begins. Using powerhouse drumming from none other than Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighter fame, and an odd, though thoroughly hypnotic riff. This track has some of the best writing on the album, some great soloing, and is incredibly catchy. We are subjected to more radio drivel, but not too much. \\"First It Giveth\\" begins immediately with more power drumming from Grohl. He really gets to stretch his muscles here. After some powerful riffing, the song's tone suddenly shifts, becoming quiet, using an actual acoustic guitar, but suddenly shifts back at breakneck speed. Altogether a great track, but not the best, in my opinion. <br />Next is \\"Song For The Dead\\". A seeming tribute to the great Jimi Hendrix, it sounds like Hendrix if he had taken biker speed instead of acid. This seems like a dark and harder rocking \\"Foxy Lady\\", especially Grohl's drumming, where he seems to be channeling Mitch Mitchell. Using a call and response with the guitars that is reminiscent of \\"All Along The Watchtower\\", the song also includes some forceful soloing. Thisis probably my favorite song on the album, followed closely by the song that comes right after it, \\"The Sky Is Fallin`\\". The song, like \\"Millionaire\\", begins with slowly and quietly, but suddenly becomes strong and hard hitting. This is where it becomes apparent what is meant when QOTSA are described as \\"Robot Rock\\". The song is pure repetition. This in no way detracts from the song itself, though it does seem to give it an apathetic feel. The lyrics seem profound, and Homme's crooning seems quite beautiful here. <br />Unfortunately, these great songs are followed by \\"Six Shooter\\". The most unlistenable track on the album, the track is primarily Homme screaming \\"F*ck\\" repeatedly. After a few listens, I can honestly say I don't mind the track as much as when I first heard it. Its skippable, definitely. \\"Hanging Tree\\" comes next, with Homme's vocals virtually unrecognizable as his own. Seems to be his talent, adequately shown throughout the album. The guitars are good throughout the track, culminating in a good, though short, solo. <br />Another favorite of mine, \\"Go With The Flow\\", follows, allowing all musicians to showcase their talent. The drums come though in full force, the vocals are attractive, drawing in the listener, and great guitars throughout, and, to round it all out, keyboards are thrown in the mix. This big jumble turns out to be a very marketable, and altogether excellent, single. \\"Gonna Leave You\\" shows yet another vocal change for Homme. His voice seems almost (I hesitate to say this) poppy. Yes, its sweet sounding, and contrasts starkly with the grinding guitars. The two extremes come together to form a sad, yet strangely happy song. The writing is excellent: \\"You're out of my high chair/ I'm out of your womb\\". <br />Following it is \\"Do It Again\\". I really like this song, but I can't pinpoint a reason why. I'm beginning to suspect it may be Homme's vocal change mid-song, going from his normal (I think) voice to a higher pitched one. The vocals arethe outstanding mark of this song. Coupled with the hard-edged, grinding guitars, they make for an exceptional track. Next, after almost a minute of \\"radio\\", is the great \\"God Is In The Radio\\". Starting out with a simple bass line and a bit of keyboard, the drums kick in, sounding reminiscent of a marching band. This is one of the slower songs on the album. The song fades out, only to fade back in with a solo that, for some reason, reminds me of a heavier version of the Allman Brothers Band. <br />\\"Another Love Song\\" is really just a redo of \\"Gonna Leave You\\", but that fact doesn't retract from it. It is still a good song, with the vocals creating an airy, poppy mood. The guitars aren't as heavy as they usually are, adding to the pop-esqueness of the track. The closer (supposedly) is \\"Song For The Deaf\\". Now, I'll be honest, this track is near frightening to me. Of course, I usually hear it 10 minutes after I wake up, waiting for my bus, but still. It gives a sense of open, emptiness. It is easily associated with the thought of being deaf, and I believe that is what they were going for with this. The bass is outstanding, along with the guitar playing and vocals. All first class. It comes together to make a great ender (almost) to a great album. <br />Following \\"Deaf\\" is a short little jam from \\"Feel Good Hit Of The Summer\\", with the vocals replaced with laughs. The drums fading into the background make me remember why I like that song so much. Next is the \\"hidden\\" track, \\"Mosquito Song\\". A simple acoustic song, it sounds absolutely nothing like the rest of the album, but still finds a way to fit in. Using grisly lyrics and a simple guitar riff, the song tells of the dangers of killer mosquitoes. Eventually incorporating an accordion and cellos, this song is very quaint and beautiful, a fitting end to a melodic album. Whoa, déjà vu.
0140277447|1.0|--<BR>Iris Chang's &quot;Rape of Nanking&quot; is a book that fails to heal but rather sears all efforts for good international relations because it prioritizes passion at the cost of basic historical facts. We cannot ignore the book's inability and refusal, as witnessed by the usage of numerous doctored photos, to differentiate between fact and war-time propaganda.<BR>--
B0000AOV85|4.0|This DVD basically consists of interviews from the people involved in the making of the album, with a few solo sessions from Dave, Rick and Roger in a studio.  They go into some of the mechanics and inspirations for the album.  My personal feeling is that the bonus materials are better than the main portion.  Dave's, Roger's and Rick's brief solo sessions are very moving.  I sure hope more solo material of this nature comes forth in the future.  Great stuff!!  If you are a Floyd fan, this DVD is a must have in your collection!

B0000AXE8I|2.0|I saw this movie in the theaters, and maybe I was just expecting too much, because it didn't hold a candle to the first Matrix.<br />Granted, it had some excellent fight scenes, but there was so many scenes that were obviously computer animated that it felt like I was watching a video game on a big-screen t.v.  The choreography was awesome, but the scenes in between weren't compelling or inspiring or thought-provoking.  They seemed like an extended version of what the final movie should have been, with irrelevent extra scenes put it.<br />I loved the first Matrix...who didn't?  I really hope the Wachowski brothers don't let me down in November and ruin the final installment of the trilogy....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|If one ever had cause to doubt the wisdom of those in charge at FOX and are unfamiliar with the absurdly short-lived series FIREFLY, just watch these CDs and have your worst fears confirmed.  There seems to be an ongoing and massive disconnect between what is great on TV and what is fopped off to the public in primetime.  FIREFLY never really got a chance, though based on the few episodes that made it onto the airways, it most probably was going to go down as the finest Sci-fi series since STAR TREK: NEXT GENERATION.  It had a depth and complexity and potential for development that never really got developed.  One can only speculate about how good the series would have gotten, but some idea might be derived by considering producer Joss Whedon's two other series:  BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER and ANGEL.  Neither of those shows, as great as they were, was especially great in their first season.  BUFFY was short budgeted, and Whedon was still learning how to make a TV series after a lifetime of working strictly as a writer.  ANGEL was trying to find its own identify after breaking Angel, Cordelia, and Wesley out of Sunnydale, but by the second season it managed to find its own magnificent, if quite dark, identity.  FIREFLY was excellent from the get-go, but how much better might it have become had Whedon and Tim Minear had time to develop it?<br /><br />Nearly everything about this series stands out.  The special effects are without much competition the most outstanding I have ever seen on TV, most of it the result of CGI scripting rather than modeling, though models are used as well.  Just how spectacular the effects could be could be seen early on, in the episode \\"The Train.\\"  The Serenity, the space freighter used by the show's protagonists, soars down over a hyper speed freight train and hovers over it while one of the crew is lowered on a rope to one of the cars, where two other crewmembers have extracted cargo for the purposes of theft.  The sequence is simply stunning, even by feature film standards.  Luckily, there is more to FIREFLY than special effects.  One can't conceive a Joss Whedon show without great writing and a complete eschewal of the hackneyed and stereotypical.  Whedon is the finest chain puller in the history of TV writing, and just when you think a show is becoming predictable, the entire storyline will shift into completely original and sometimes shocking terrain.  Whedon is also a master at both short and long-range story arcs, and thanks to the brain trust at FOX, we didn't get to experience the long-range story arcs.<br /><br />The cast is absolutely first rate, and one of the great tragedies in the show ending as quickly as it did was losing the opportunity to get to know these folks better.  Just as the relations between the cast members were getting really interesting (another hallmark of a Whedon production), FOX pulled the plug.  Nathan Fillion showed that he had the presence to be a charismatic lead character as Captain Mal Reynolds, former fighter against the federation on the side of the Independents, now a rogue who takes on all kinds of odd jobs, as long as it never hurts everyday folk.  Gina Torres is a familiar face from movies like THE MATRIX RELOADED and guesting on TV shows like ANGEL, HERCULES, and ALIAS, and was great here as the ship's number two, with Alan Tudyk playing her slightly under-her-thumb (in a cute way) husband and ship pilot.  Adam Baldwin is great as Cobb, the ship's resident tough guy and muscle.  The incredibly stunning Marena Baccarin plays Inara Serra, a registered Companion (i.e., a very high-class prostitute along the lines of accomplished, educated, sophisticated courtesans) who is clearly in love with Reynolds despite her coolness.  Her role is remarkable in that she is not portrayed as being at all sleazy.  In fact, she is the ship's most respected passenger, being treated with inordinate deference wherever they travel.  Jewel Staite is Kaylee, the ship's mechanic, and Ron Glass the ship's chaplain.  He describes his role as that of giving guidance in an area where things are often confused and lacking in moral order.  Finally, the crew is rounded out by Sean Maher, who plays the ship's doctor, and Summer Glau, who plays his mysteriously gifted sister River, who is desperately sought by the Alliance.  Clearly River was the character who would have caused some of the most interesting plot developments had the series continued.<br /><br />Fans of FIREFLY have had in recent months two great pieces of good news.  The first is that not only the episodes originally shown on FOX will be shown on these DVDs, but three previously unseen episodes.  The latter along would justify the cost of the discs.  But recently we have had what is potentially an even greater piece of news:  Joss Whedon's next major project is going to be a full length feature film of FIREFLY, and he hopes to bring the entire cast of the TV show into the film.  Of course, this creates fantasies of the show being revived on a different television network.  But at the very least, it means that we have the DVDs of this great, great series and a forthcoming film to help us over our hurt.the ship's chaplain.

B00000JCB3|5.0|I like Limp Bizkit, I've liked them ever since this album. I didn't care for them that much on their first album because it seemed to repetitive. Bizkit is one of the real good rapcore bands. There are a few other good bands who have succeeded and been good like LB, like P.O.D. (Warriors!!!!) and Papa Roach and a couple more, these guys are great. I like this album alot especially the song \\"No Sex\\" it is the epitomy of Anti-Sex songs! Its funny too with a chorus like \\"Should have kept my pants on this time\\"! How can you not like it. The hits are old now and aren't worth listening to that much but the other tracks are better anyway. Anyone who misses when this was good music needs to click the helpful button. Also buy Chocolate Starfish and Hotdog Flavored Water which is just as good if only harder!
6305736650|5.0|Because I've been reading Michael Walsh's novel As Time Goes By, I recently decided to watch Casablanca again on DVD. I was amazed to see how this 1943 Oscar-winning film remains powerful and moving 60 years after its release.<br />Almost everybody knows its plot of of wartime intrigue and its doomed romantic triangle of bitter American saloonkeeper Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart), the beautiful Ilsa Lund (Ingrid Bergman), and her idealistic husband, Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid). This trio is supported by a wonderful and varied cast of characters, including Police Prefect Louis Renault (Claude Rains), Rick's faithful friend and piano player Sam Waters (Arthur &quot;Dooley&quot; Wilson), the conniving Ugarte (Peter Lorre), the Russian bartender Sacha (Leonid Kinsky), and  the loveable maitre d' Carl (S. Z. Sakall).<br />The heart of the movie revolves around the conflict created in Rick's heart by World War II. When his former flame Ilsa arrives in Casablanca, does he help her and her husband Victor escape to Lisbon, or does he allow German Major Strasser (Conrad Veldt) to capture the fugitive Czech resistance leader so Rick can take Ilsa to America himself? Or do his natural good instincts surface and get Rick to do the honorable thing?<br />This movie has a little bit of everything: suspense, drama, comedy, an exotic setting, and lots of music, including renditions of &quot;It Had To Be You,&quot; &quot;The Very Thought Of You,&quot;  and a thrilling duel between Germans singing the &quot;Watch On The Rhine&quot; and the Allies belting out &quot;The Marsellaise.&quot;  Other songs heard in the film include &quot;Knock On Wood,&quot; and the unforgettable &quot;As Time Goes By.&quot;<br />Another crucial element is the snappy and memorable dialog written by the Epstein twins and Hal B. Wallis for this movie: <br />Rick: I came here for the waters.<BR>Louis: Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.<BR>Rick: Obviously, I was misinformed.<br />Ilsa: (to Sam) Play it. Play &quot;As Time Goes By.&quot;<br />Rick: (to Sam) Of all the gin joints in all the towns in all the world, she walks into mine.<br />Louis: (pretending to be surprised) I'm shocked, shocked to find gambling in here!<BR>Casino Dealer: (handing Louis some money) Your winnings, sir.<BR>Louis: (takes the money) Thank you.<br />Rick: (to Ilsa) Now, now...here's looking at you, kid.<br />With all these ingredients, director Michael Curtiz and producer Jack Warner came up with a recipe for a movie that became a beloved classic, a status recognized when the Library of Congress named Casablanca as one of the most important American films.
B000069AUI|3.0|A pleasent effort.  Not since Oasis has a pop band gotten so much attention for music that is so derivative of other artists.  Oasis = The Beatles.  Coldplay = U2, David Bowie, Dave Matthews, Pink Floyd, The Beatles, Bruce Hornsby....  \\"Clocks\\" simply is an imitation of Hornsby's style top to bottom, done nicely I admit, but, come on guys can't you be more original?  A well suited album for the masses.
B00006LLJ4|5.0|I enjoyed this fast-paced futuristic movie. I liked the question proposed in the movie of if one can change one's destiny. This movie kept me on my toes with fast camrea action and well developed main charaters. In this movie the director of the pre-crime unit is fully supportive of arresting people accused of future murders. Until he finds himself being accused of committing a future murder. The chase is on, in the meantime he finds the secret that could shut down pre-crime, he could either ignore it or exploit it to put things arright. The movie was very futuristic but had themes that you can apply to today. Good movie, good actors, and good action!

0316666343|5.0|I was astounded at Alice sebolds objective writing skills when reading this book. The subject matter should provoke unease and distaste, with the thought of a young girl raped and murdered. However, it is written without to much sentimentality, no dweling on the event, but rather, how the girl was feeling towards the breakdown of her family, and her friends. At no point does she portray hatred or bitterness from the main character. The book could do with tightening up in some places, but for a first novel it is a highly inspirational, thought-provoking book that makes you stop and take stock of your own life. I had to have a cuddle afterwards!!!
0767830555|5.0|I had heard of \\"Taxi Driver\\" when President Ronald Reagan had gotten shot and finally, one day, I saw what the fuss was about after viewing the movie. This is one amazing and disturbing movie, folks. \\"Taxi Driver\\" is the movie that John Hinckley, Jr was taken by, when he became obsessed with impressing Jodie Foster, prompting his assassination attempt. It can be quite disturbing for people sensitive to racial and sexual issues. The combination of graphic language and sexual themes makes this a movie that should not be on everyone's \\"essential movie collection.\\" But for those who are fans of people like Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, director Martin Scorsese (tidbit about Scorsese below), and composer Bernard Hermann, it is worth every penny.<br />I cannot stress enough that \\"Taxi Driver\\" deserves every ounce of the \\"R\\" rating it got (strange that \\"Midnight Cowboy\\" had received an \\"X\\" rating less than a decade earlier -- only Scorsese's decision to desaturate (but not delete) the final blood- filled killing scene kept \\"Taxi\\" from the \\"X\\" rating). It's difficult to suggest just who would be interested in a movie that starts in such a dismal air and spirals into psychological depths  even further down as each scene rolls by. You may love it or despise it, but you'll be moved by \\"Taxi Driver.\\"<br />No details about the plot from this reviewer; practically every review has enough about that. I wanted to focus on the brazen and unflinching dialog and plot to give the readers here a clear warning to brace yourselves for one of the most powerful dramas ever filmed. And make certain to activate the parental block on your DVD player if you purchase this when underage children are living at your residence.<br />\\"Taxi Driver\\" has themes which include racism, sexism, violence, abuse, prostitution of children, and murder. In other words, Scorsese makes the viewer take a blinding, eye- opening view of a sample of the reality and brutality of life that some people live through, even now. If you're open- minded and sane enough to view such a movie, by all means, check \\"Taxi Driver\\" out. Just remember: It's only a movie.<br />If you choose to purchase, buy the collector's edition DVD (the one with the B&W half- face portrait of De Niro), which has plenty of extras that the original DVD lacks. It has a wealth of information on the movie's production, including how some of the players researched their characters. There are also interviews of the different actors, including De Niro, Foster, Peter Boyle and more. The disc also has production stills and commentary by the DVD's producer.<br />SCORSESE SIGHTINGS: Martin Scorsese can be seen in two different scenes in the movie. The first scene is the introduction of Betsy (Cybill Shepherd) as she reaches the door of the Palentine headquarters. Scorsese sits to the right on the steps.

B0000039PW|5.0|Biggie was the greatest rapper of all time. this album shows it. From the Intro to suicidal thoughts, biggie comes through on his perfect album. His best for sure. in my opinion the greatest ever. Biggie kept it real. talked about the streets and the struggle. Then to top it all off, he ended it with an ill ryhme. Ya should cop this album. its worth it all.
B00007LTIL|5.0|There's really only one reason to get this remaster of AMERICAN BEAUTY: this classic album has finally been done aural justice. Instead of an agreeable but muddy blur that made the original CD version a chore to listen to, every instrument is crystal clear, the sound separation between speakers is perfect and you sink into the, well, beauty of the songs in a way you couldn't before. The &quot;bonus tracks&quot; are okay, nothing special--what's the point of having the &quot;single version&quot; of &quot;Ripple?&quot;....but who cares with the meat and potatos of the disc, namely the original album, being so wonderfully restored to sonic health?
B00008DDXC|4.0|I was really looking forward to this installment in the Harry Potter series.  I was a little disappointed, but the movie is still very good.  The second book has always been my least favorite so it was understandable to me that this movie wasn't as exciting as the first, but it is still very cool and alot of fun! cant wait til #3
B000001H00|4.0|Overall, this is a great compilation of the Bach solo repertoire for violin.  My only criticism is the intonation problems, most notably in the Ciaccona of the d minor Partita.  It really detracts from the overall appreciation of these pieces.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I have not had the opportunity to view the extended version of LOTR The Two Towers yet, but I am 100% positive that it will only be more breathtaking than the theatrical release.  This movie is one of the most astounding undertakings in film history since the days of classics like Cleopatra, The Ten Commandments and Star Wars.  <br />Peter Jackson has taken an epic tale, which admittedly I was never able to stay awake long enough to read, and turned it into a trilogy that I am sure has as much if not more dramatic impact on its audience as the literary work itself.  And hats off to Jackson for his excellent attention to detail.  He could easily have created Middle Earth in the bowels of a computer program, but he wanted something tangible that his audience could believe in, so he demanded models, models, and more models, and hundreds of extras, and scads of the best camera tricks, and acres of perfectly prepared land to build authentic sets on (every inch of which he retored to its original condition when he was done by the way), and the list of his achievements goes on.  <br />Some of us were waiting for George Lucas to re-enter the arena as god of the film epic the summer before LOTR The Fellowship made its appeareance, and were more than sadly disappointed with his oversue of special effects and lack of characterization.  We plodded away from the theatre sure that computers had rendered a good old fashioned epic film impossible now.  Doubting Thomas's, we entered the theatre and were blown away by THe Fellowship.  And then we were blown away again with the Two Towers.  I have to say that I am ecstaticly anxious to see THe Return of the King, but at the same time I don't want it to happen because then the epic will be over.  The story will be told, and the characters will drift away into history, remembered, but never seen again.  I have no doubts that Return of the King will blow its audience away yet again.  <br />I can only say that the Two Towers was one morestep up on the scale of film making, hard to top, but Jackson has what its takes.  He has created a movie so rich in story, character, setting, and atmosphere that it is nearly impossible to believe that Middle Earth isn't on the airlines list of most popular places to visit.  I will say that the second movie was much darker and bloodier than the first, an objection voiced by a few people I attended shows with, but every ounce was neccassary to tell the story and that is what's important.<br />I can hardly do this film justice with my own words, so just buy it and watch it, and watch it again, and again, and again...Hey, I saw it in the theater 9 times at 7 bucks a ticket!  What else needs to be said? Buy it!  Watch it!  Love it!
B000092Q4U|5.0|I just found out about these guys when their video for &quot;11th Hour&quot;(which is way too heavy for anyones ears) played on MTV2's headbangers ballroom. I immediately bought this album. This a cd that is a landmark for metal. This is a cd that sets an example and level for which other metal should be. I am a metal guitarist, and this cd just blows me away. These guys destroy anything Slipknot could offer. The singers roars and shreiks are among the best I've ever heard. The drummer is absolutely tight in everything he does. The bass is actually audible, which isnt very common on metal albums; especially for a band as hardcore as this one. The guitarists throw out creative, awe-inspiring, and technical riffs. These are some of the most precise riffs, and heaviest, that have ever graced my hearing. This is a beautiful album. These guys will be huge someday. These guys know how to rock.
B000002UJQ|5.0|To the reviewer from L.A. who recommended that Radiohead fans (who are obvioiusly &quot;poseurs&quot;) listen to &quot;Fantomas, Mr. Bungle, Thinking Plague, Opeth, Porcupine Tree, and Spiral Architect&quot;:  I enjoy all of those bands, as well as free-form jazz, German experimental industrial, Krautrock, Japanese noise, and other super avant-garde genres and this is my favorite album of all time.  I suppose I'm a poseur.<br />Buy this.  Now.  Listen.  Enjoy.<br />Unless you're a &quot;poseur.&quot;
B000002AGM|5.0|This morning was my first journey of &quot;Miles Ahead&quot;, truly one of the most beautiful collaborations of mystery, love, happiness, passion, and creativity of jazz coming into one with an orchestra. I love it. It's so creative and revolutionary for my ears. It was amazing how each song attached to one another as a whole, not at all stopping to give us a cue that another song is coming up. There are no detours on this trip, just smooth, very smooth sailing. The music will truly keep you sailing miles ahead and ahead towards the greatest expression of life ever made by the man who made it all a journey.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|After repeated listenings of this CD...I have to hand it to Maynard James Keenan.  Not because this is &quot;his&quot; band, as if he was the only reason to buy this incredible album.  In fact, quite the opposite, he does not take over the band.  This is not to say that he does not have his moments to shine, but the band spreads the love.  There are times where you are encaptured by Maynard's soulful crooning, Billy's driving guitar, Josh's rigid yet fluidly beautiful supporting drums,and Jeordie's rollicking bass.  But each one never dares to steal the spotlight for themselves, but instead go for a unified approach and gives them a sum greater than their parts.  I can hear them trying to make a name for themselves, not content with the title &quot;that guy from tool's other band&quot; This album shows that they are so much more.  The opening song is the most comparable to Tool with its melodic buildup and its harder  finish.  The greatest suprise on this album for me was &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot;   I admit, the first time I heard this song, I was questioning why the heck it was on this album...but it really grows on you.  It shows Maynard can sing, and its  a beautiful song.  Closest to their &quot;Mer de Norms&quot; album, would be the song &quot;Pet&quot;  Pet is a great song, and sums up what this album can be.  A driven, melodic, profoundly meaningful album that can make you think about what these guys are capable of.  Some other Highlights include &quot;Blue&quot; &quot;The Noose&quot; &quot;Crimes&quot; and &quot;Gravity&quot;.  If you are a fan of APC, Tool, or any other hard/prog rock band, go buy this album now, if you havent already.  If you arent...buy this anyway, its a good introduction to the genre.  I enjoyed this album immensly, and I had almost as much fun listening to it as they sound like they had making it.  Here's to many more years of APC and Tool, neither overshadowing the other.
B00005JLRT|4.0|I have been going over the comments left by most reviewers about Nemesis and being another die-hard Trekkie, I'll voice my two cents worth. <br />I think some of the allegations against the last installment for the TNG movie series are not fair. The biggest one floating around is that the plot is a rip-off of The Wrath Of Khan. I don't think that is necessarily true. I agree that it does inspire some déjà vu but that hardly constitutes a true rip-off. There were tremendous similarities between the production and scene sequences of The Terminator and its sequel Terminator 2: Judgment Day; did anyone accuse T2 of being a rip-off of T1? T2 was a blockbuster. Similarly, Nemesis is a pretty good movie and it is not fair to forcibly compare it to The Wrath Of Khan. If you are a die-hard Trekkie, you might very well appreciate the similarity instead. <br />If you critique the movie beside itself, you could say that the movie was too \\"Data\\"-centered perhaps. Some characters, like La Forge, Worf or Dr. Crusher, did appear to be more of filler roles and did not get as much airtime and stronger lines as we would have liked. The production and effects were very good. The evolution of the characters themselves was excellent; the acting was superb. Picard was a bit on the mushy side but if you think in a frame of reference where they've become a family that has been together on a starship for 15 years, you begin to appreciate this side of his character and why it is so. Brent Spiner's acting was nothing short of fantastic; whoever did his script also did an excellent job along with the direction. Brent Spiner did justice to the role of Data. You could see the human evolution coming through in the android's personality over 15 years; the subtle smiles and winks in certain scenes, the smart jives and one-liners. He depicted just the right tones of humanness while retaining the rigidity of his android reality, which culminates in the ultimate (human) sacrifice in the end - a paradox carried out to perfection. The ending was bittersweet, which is what I personally liked. <br />All in all, it wasn't based on a strong standalone plot irrespective of the characters like \\"First Contact\\" was. \\"Nemesis\\" has a character-centric plot more like \\"Generations\\" did. That is probably the reason why people are so divided about liking it - you have to know the TV series and follow character evolutions there else you cannot fully enjoy a movie based on it; you lose the essence somewhere and then brand the movie as being bad. If you are a die-hard Trekkie or a fan of TNG, I think you'll be able to see beyond any weaknesses and read between the lines to appreciate the finer points of the movie and still enjoy it - including the déjà vu element with The Wrath Of Khan. <br />As for the DVD, it is produced very well and contains lots of goodies, like commentaries, production notes and deleted scenes. It is worth adding to your Star Trek collection, if you have one. Cheers.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is an amazing presentation of A Perfect Circle's development as a band. Being a huge APC fan who stills listens to Mer De Noms on a daily basis, I had high expectations for this album. Well, gladly I can tell you that I was not dissapointed.<br />For all the APC fans out there, you must embrace this album as something totally different from the band. If you are looking for another M.D.N, you will be greately dissapointed. Thirteenth Step is not an extension of M.D.N, but rather a journey from start to finish. I would argue that this album offers a lot more variety in terms of music style and lyrical content than M.D.N. It contains beautiful subtle tracks like the package, the noose, gravity and vanishing as well as more hard rock style songs such as Pet and the Outsider. Fans of APC and creative new music in general should definately give this album a listen.<br />Like M.D.N, Thirteenth Step is very creative and different from anything I have ever heard before. So it requires a few listens before you can truly appreciate it.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|sista done laid back in the experimental-cut with this yall...<BR>'sperimental like A STONE GROOVE... not 'sperimental like WTF?<BR>she channels many different influences with this, does a whole lotta hummin and scattin (not real deep with the lyrics on this album!)... heavily instrumental at times, somewhere between isaac hayes and some p-funk... <br />this is different than what you might expect from an ashanti or mary j. blige or somethin... but come on now... we talkin bout the lovely ms. wright, yall know how she gets down! and tho this may not be the instant classic that her other releases are, this is waaay better than the regular r&amp;b gracing the airwaves now...<br />this is a beautifully created conception... dont be shook.<br />dirty.
B0000AXE8I|3.0|This film was OK, but I found myself sitting in the theater wondering when it was going to end.  The rave/love scene is disturbing, but not intolerable.  Not something I'd expect to see in the Matrix.  What bothered me the most about this film was the ending scenes.  The creators chose to cut back and forth between several scenes that took place at different times.  I found this disorienting and lost what was happening.  Then I REALLY wanted it to end so I could go home.  It was as if they still had lots to say at the end, but had run out of time to say it in.  So they chose to cut in between scenes and just mash it all together right at the end.<br />I truly wished they'd stopped with the original Matrix.  It was interesting and somewhat original.  It introduced philosophical themes to a society that otherwise might not consider them.  Now, it's simply becoming the Star Wars of this generation.  Too bad.  But I guess that's what separates \\"movies\\" from \\"art\\".  A film that is \\"art\\" is a gem all by itself.  A \\"movie\\" is just a moneymaker.
B0000797IO|4.0|At first, I wondered how someone so loaded with cash and with everything going for her thought she could authentically recreate the daily experiences of the disenchanted commoner. <BR>Well, Jennifer did a surprisingly good job. It represented fairly well the drab and bleak existence of those of us with useless jobs and not much to look forward to, which is crucial because it would be an insult to do otherwise. <BR><BR>I can personally relate to \\"Holden\\", and Jake pulled that character off fabulously. He was just so apathetic and misanthropic, it was great. Notice how his last name, Werther,  is taken from the German tragedy \\"The Sorrows of Young Werther\\" (pronounced vair-tair) by Goethe, which this film could almost--but not quite--pass as an adaptation of. The end is directly lifted from that tale, at least the end as far as jake's character goes.<BR>Of course, like any other red-blooded American male, I was primarily interested in Jennifer's first sex scene. Bravo to her for going for it, but of course the lack of any distinct nudity is cause for lament.<BR>Ultimately the film was a great vehicle for Jennifer to show her stuff (talents, I mean) and she definitely steals the show. Very entertaining, but certainly not the \\"comedy\\" that it is mysteriously being sold as.
B000002G26|5.0|This compilation in 1993 misses Bryan's two #1 hits All For Love and Have You Ever Really Loved A Woman after this release. Yet I strongly recommend this album for wide range of music fans young or old over Best of Me. It really has most of hits that truly show the very reason why he has been loved by tens of million of rock fans around the globe.<br />Bryan Adams with songwriting collaboration with Jim Vallance debuted in 1979 and his third album &quot;Cuts Like A Knife&quot; in 1983 yielded three big hits and the 1984 follow-up &quot;Reckless&quot; exploded with six consecutive huge hits including his first #1 hit Heaven and super duet with Tine Turner in It's Only Love. And hit parade went on and on and now Bryan came back with Spirit soundtrack. Six tracks from Reckless, three each from &quot;Cuts Like A Knife&quot; and &quot;Waking Up The Neighbors&quot;(sort of Reckless sequel) respectively.<br />Although I had known most of the songs because I previously had Reckless, Into The Fire, and Waking Up the Neighbors, the songs to me are still fresh and consequently made me turned on CD player hundreds of times. Recommended for wide range of pop rock fans.
B00005A1PR|5.0|I have many R&amp;B albums by you name it, but this one is my favorite R&amp;B album. It's one of the few albums I have that is good as a whole and has no filler in my opinion. Even the for the content(which isn't all about loving self) it was amazing the spin she put in it. For example &quot;Brown Skin&quot; which is about India finding a brother with that brown skin and then taking him to....and then going for seconds (I'm not lying look at the lyrics). R. Kelly couldn't make a sensual yet tasteful song like this if his career depended on it. &quot;Always in my Head&quot; is about India's love of music which no one can't deny. &quot;Simple&quot; is about trying to find the right words when it is just so simple to say &quot;I love you&quot;; it's just beautiful. &quot;Part of my Life&quot; is about India having them physical desires but she tells herself that she wants more from a man than just...you know. Anyway this album is more than what it seems and that's why I love it.
B00008IHN1|5.0|Finally being able to see the magic of the performance of Southern Black Colleges Marching Bands, especially the drumline.  This is a movie that you would watch over and over again.  Great story, movie was well put together.  This movie will be enjoyed for generations to come.
B00000DOYR|5.0|All right, I'm tired of people not giving Brian Johnson any credit.  Yes, Bon Scott (r.i.p) is the best front man of all time, but this album alone shows that Brian Johnson is able to rock out with the kings of dirty deeds.  His ripping vocals on: Hells Bells and What do You do For Money Honey are unforgettable.  Every song on this album has riffs that will surely have you strutting and duckwalking.  Back in Black is a must have for any rock and roll fan.  If it's Bon or Brian AC/DC will give you everything you want in a rock band, and Back in Black shows it!
0767817729|4.0|Ok, the first time I saw this film was in the 93 or something like that and I thought it was an ok movie but nothing else... then in the 2000 I was in my home and remembered of that movie I saw one day, so I started to look into the tapes collection in my home 'til I found it, played it and actually saw the film carefully. All I can say is that Anthony Quinn played on of the most emotional roles of his career on this one; al the same time, Mrs. Stowe and Kevin Costner gives us on this movie two excellents pieces of acting, 'cause the deep and the honestly on the characters it's the best, it seems like they were actually in love and tryind desperately to find each other.<BR>The only bad thing it's that some scenes are too much slow, it's like the movie begin actually when Tibey (Quinn's character) do his revenge against Costner and Stowe. But, the bottom line is that this movie it's really worth seeing, and don't deserves all the BS that critics told about it.<BR>Give the movie a chance, you'll find satisfied with it at the end.
B000002HH2|5.0|If 'Debut' was '90s dance-pop broken down and concentrated into an ecstatic adventure, then 'Post' is a glorious wander into the unmapped forests and hidden backwaters 'Debut' left unexplored. Uillean pipes, harpsichords and 20-piece orchestra mingle naturally with multi-layered Howie B drum programs, Tricky's rude minimalism and Nellee Hooper's bubbling pop sensibility.<BR>While no one would expect someone with Bjrk's creative energy to produce 'Debut', 'Post' shares its predecessors jumble of sounds, from the (knowingly) cornily showtune production 'It's Oh So Quiet' to the space-age glam-disco of &quot;Hyperballad' and the flickering rhythms of 'I Miss You'. Meanwhile, more laid-back swingers like the Massey collaboration 'The Modern Things', the opulently spacious &quot;Isobel' and the not so surprisingly heavier, brooding Tricky-collaborated 'Enjoy' give her distinctive grunt and growl some new ground to cover. And all this before we get on to her lyrics - sometimes simple, sometimes obscure, but always deeply affecting in their insight and openness. Bjrk isn't wasting a second of her needle time.<BR>Post is like a beat-experimenter that Bjrk has conjured up for another magical masterpiece...
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This cd just reminds everyone with good taste in music as to why A Perfect Circle is one of the greatest bands out there today. Ares was really dumb and ignorant to turn down Mer de Noms, but whatever. His/her loss really, because that's one of the best cds, ever. However, Thirteenth Step is better, and that's saying a whole lot. They totally expanded off from Mer De Noms, which I know sounds tough. And it would be for most, but Maynard (the singer, who, hands down, is the best vocalist alive. anyone who disagrees is just flat-out incorrect) has a brilliant mind who will only create music with minds just as creative and intuitive as his. All these songs on this cd are equally near-perfect. I say near perfect because all music has flaws. But bands like Tool, Deftones, Radiohead, and A Perfect Circle are the closest to being perfect out of all the bands out today.
B000002HPV|5.0|She has definitely become more mature, yeah. And when you grow up, you need less toys. You also notice that as a musician. Debut and Post were full of little toys; it was very simple to draw the attention with that for 45 minutes. Every minute new gadgets were introduced.<BR>Beats, violins and vocals, and trying to cover the entire emotional spectrum with that. Preferably the same spectrum as on Debut and Post.<BR>With Homogenic she just decided not to please anybody except herself, and she's really touched by the fact that people still seem to be interested.<BR>It's a very Icelandic record, especially as far as rhythm is concerned, the beats and the strings.<BR>All it takes is inside you...<BR>The beats = earthquakes, snowstorms, rain, ice, volcanic eruptions, geysers...<BR>The electronic beats are the rhythm, the heartbeat. The violins create the old-fashioned atmosphere, the colouring.
B000007OY0|5.0|This is a movie you can watch over and over again without getting bored.  It just draws you in.  Everytime it's shown on T.V.  I watch it.  One of the best movies of all time!
B00006RCNW|5.0|The show's main focus is on Detective Vic Mackey ( Michael Chiklis) who leads a team of three other detectives with the best arrest records in the department. While the team does get fantastic results, they are the dirtiest cops in L.A.. Captain David Acevada ( Benito Martinez) is brought into the department to help clean it up and to make sure things run smoothly so that a strong media image is maintained. Acevada soon learns however, that he is going to have his hands full when it comes to Vic and the strike team because they go by their own personal agenda. This of course soon pushes Aciveda towards going after the Strike Team personally... <br />\\"The Shield\\" in my opinion is one of the best shown on TV right now. The FX Network raised the quality of their programming up a notch when they released The Shield onto the air. The thing that I like most about the show, is how realistic it is. It actually feels like you are witnessing what goes on in the real world. The show often showcases acts of violence, nudity, and tons of profanity. That is why the show works. The quality of the show is put above the actual opinion of the viewers. The Shield is also the first cop show that I have seen that actually ties the episodes together. A lot of cop shows are based on what happens from case to case. But with The Shield, you actually have to see every episode to understand what's going on. Michael Chiklis offers one of the best performances I have ever seen with his portrayal of Vic Mackey. The character often toys with your emotions because you will find yourself hating the guy and supporting the guy all at the same time. The rest of the cast is top notch as well, despite being filled with relatively unknown actors.<br />If you are fan of police related TV shows, The Shield is the one show that you should definately watch. The disturbing cases, excellent acting, and overall realistic feel will have you hooked after the very first episode. The DVD extras are a sweet bonus because of all the behind the scenes footage that is shown. Overall, this is an excellent buy that should not be passed up.
B00003CY6M|5.0|Serendipity is absolutely perfect.  The story line is magical and the acting is superb.. bravo and encore.. the best romantic comedy you'll ever see..  A movie for true romantics!
B0000026J6|5.0|There was a time when people quipped that you get a free single-edge razor blade with every Cohen album.  It's true some of his early work leaned toward depressing material, though every album had at least one song to blow you away.  I'm Your Man began an entirely different phase of Cohens career.  This album comes up almost all winners.  I'm not overly fond of Jazz Police and First We Take Manhattan, but whatever weakness those songs involve is more than overwhelmed by all the others.  If Cohen hadn't done so much and been around so long I'd be tempted to call 'Take This Waltz' my all-time Cohen favorite.  In other times I've called it the best song of the 20th Century.  I still might be tempted to do so.  This is the best of his career up until that time, despite Suzanne, The Stranger, Bird on a Wire and a dozen others.  Get it if you don't have it.
0679720200|4.0|I found this book to be interesting. The main charater, Meursault, seemed so apathetic about life, I had to continue reading. But his apathy was very suffocating to the reader. I found the direction of the book odd; the outcome was definitely not what I expected. I suppose that some of the writing probably would have sounded different if it was in the original French. Overall, I think the story was well written and well developed.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I have listined to this album around 10 times now all the way through. I love this album so much. I read that this album is about the 13 step drug rehablitation process. So each song is about what he is feeling at that point in the process. At first I said to my self &quot;Mer de Noms is so much better than this&quot;, but now I love this album much more than their last one! You might say the same thing at first, but give it a few songs and you will relize its one of the best albums of all time. This is a must buy album.
B00008438V|2.0|I have been waiting for this movie to be released on dvd for a while and I am totally thrilled with it...well...maybe not totally. The letterbox is botched. I experienced this same problem with the second &quot;Back to the Future&quot; film and the studio offered a mail in replacement with the correct aspect ratio. To be more specific, the bottom portion of the film is cut off. I noticed this in the kitchen/omelette scene first. I then compared it to my vhs copy and sure enough, the bottom of the film is missing. I returned my copy and got another one and it also has the same problem. Anyway, I contacted Universal and am waiting to hear back if they have a solution for this. You might want to wait if you are as big a fan of this movie as I am. OTHER than that...it is an excellent transfer and still fun to watch (just wish i could see the whole thing).
020530902X|5.0|It's under a hundred pages.  The bulk of the text is nearly seventy years old.  But after all this time, it's still a priceless, must-have reference.<br />If you're a writer of any kind -  student, novelist, journalist, poet, technical writer, graffiti artist, you name it - You need a copy of Strunk and White.  No book this small (and not many larger) cover as much ground as well as this little volume does.  Usage, form, misused words and expressions, style...it's all here.  But if you think this is some stuffy textbook written by a couple of old coots sitting in an ivory tower, you couldn't be more wrong.  The rules and examples are clear and easy to understand.  I don't know of a more practical book that can be used by everyone from grade school students to PhD's.  The book has instructed AND entertained for nearly seventy years.  May it last for another seventy and beyond.<br />92 pages
0380789035|5.0|That's really how I felt while reading this book.  I felt that Gaiman had seized my attention and taken me on a wonderfully twisty and mysterious journey.  The stances Gaiman takes in this book are original and elegant--his characters complex and beautiful.  Shadow and Wednesday, in particular, seized me, but I was also captivated by Town (working for the opposition) and Laura (Shadow's late wife).<br />Gaiman makes you care about the fates of all those in his epic, and no one in his novel is sketched.  Even bit players seem whole and real.  This captivating, original novel is a must-read.<br />Enjoy the journey.
0385512104|5.0|Christopher Boone is not your typical fifteen-year old.  He thinks logically, understands extremely difficult math concepts, hates the colors brown and yellow, dislikes being touched, and knows every prime number up to 7,057.  He's also autistic.  <br />Christopher relates to animals much better than he does to humans.  So when he discovers that a neighbor's dog has been killed with a garden fork, Christopher is naturally upset.  So this very unusual young man - who is afraid of strangers and unfamiliar places - sets out to find the dog's killer.  In doing so, he makes some discoveries that will be very unsettling. <br />Author Mark Haddon has written a very original novel, narrated by Christopher.  We see the world through this very special boy's eyes.  The way that Christopher tries to make sense and order of the world makes him a narrator like no other we have ever encountered in literature.  The novel works so well because the character of Christopher is so well drawn and his problems (and attempts at solving them) are honest, real, and touching.  Highly recommended.  <br />221 pages
0780020685|5.0|Looking through the many reviews, and looking at the one star efforts, I was amazed at the reasons given for being a bad film. A cheap Hong Kong effort, a rip off of The Magnificent Seven, a bad Hong Kong flick....I reckon that some of the reviewers weren't paying attention or never saw Seven Samurai.<br />This is one of those rare films where the more you see it, the more you get out of it. It is drawn out and ponderous at times, but that adds to it's realism. The photography is brilliant in wonderful black and white. Kurosawa is at his peak in a story that explores the hearts of men, and obtains memorable performances from his Toho acting corps.<br />Takashi Shimura stands head and shoulders above all others in what is, apart from Ikiru, his finest film portrayal. Mifune may seem too over the top, but when you consider his characters background, it is a magnificent effort. The scene where he and the farmers burst into the room with armor and weapons taken from murdered Samurai tells plenty about the character of Kikuchiyo.<br />Most of the performances from the large cast are memorable, and there is even  the first screen appearance of Tatsuya Nakadai as the second Samurai walking through the town.<br />This is not an action film, although there is the 3 days of fighting with the bandits, but more of a human adventure with little reward and great personal sacrifice.<br />A true classic that for me ends too soon!
B00007LTIC|4.0|1977's Going For The One, in my opinion, was Yes's least \\"progressive\\" and most \\"artsy\\" work of the 70's.  And even though the album consists of mostly 4-8 minute songs (hardly the norm for Yes) it still takes as many listens to fully appreciate as albums like Close To The Edge or Relayer.  But with the addition of seven (!) bonus tracks and a much, MUCH crisper sound than any previous edition, this remaster deserves to be in the collection of any self-respecting rock fan.<br />The least dissonant and most accessible songs on the album are 'Turn Of The Century' and 'Wonderous Stories.'  Both songs feature Steve Howe's remarkable prowess on the acoustic guitar.  'Turn Of The Century' features exceptionally moving performances from Howe and singer Jon Anderson- in fact it's probably Anderson's most emotional vocal in the entire Yes canon.  I don't listen to this track much, mostly because of its 8-minute length, which is quite prodigious for a song that's 90% acoustic.  'Wonderous Stories' is a good indication of what The Yes Album might have sounded like had keyboardist Rick Wakeman performed on it (it's also a good indication that Jon Anderson doesn't know how to spell *wondrous*).  Wakeman's Moog washes over the chorus are very cool.  The song features the vachalia, which Howe used on TYA's 'I've Seen All Good People.'  It's a pithy, pleasant little ditty.<br />The title track is a wonderful tune, and next to 'Tempus Fugit' (from 1980's awesome Drama) it's my favorite short-form Yes song.  It's very artsy and dissonant, but definitely grows on you after two or three listens.  There's not much \\"progressive\\" about the song, other than Howe's use of a steel guitar all the way through.  He gives one hell of an awesome solo from 2:05-2:40, which is the highlight of the song for me.  Bassist Chris Squire and drummer Alan White provide a perfect backbeat to the song.<br />The Squire-penned 'Parallels' took a long while to grow on me, and in fact I didn't even like the song until I heard it performed live on the Yesshows album, which is a good context for a song such as this.  It's even more cacophonous and harsh than 'Going For The One-' I figure this is because of the song's nature as a straightforward hard rocker with the addition of a massive church organ backdrop.  This new remastered edition is much better, as previous CD editions have the church organ drown out most of the rest of the song.  I don't blame you if you don't like this song, but at least listen to it more than a couple of times.<br />The zenith of Going For The One comes in 'Awaken,' and at 16 minutes it's nearly as long as the rest of the album combined.  Many, if not most, Yes fans think this is the best song the band has ever done.  I don't agree, but it is a very moving piece.  It opens with lightning-fast piano courtesy of Wakeman (which sounds uncannily like Queen's 'Seven Seas Of Rhye' if you ask me).  The song is very good, if also very overlong.  Steve Howe adds some very nice hard-rock guitar stylings that foreshadow his work on Drama three years later.  Alan White gives a great performance as well, but Chris Squire's bass is buried under the fury of the song.  Not that it detracts much, because it really doesn't, but I think his bass would have added a great element to the song.  The harp section of the song is great at first, but becomes very drawn out as it continues.  The highlight of the song is the final two minutes.  When Jon Anderson sings, \\"Like the time I ran away, and turned around, and you were standing close to me,\\" I almost break down in tears, it's so beautiful.  Howe's final little guitar outro is the clincher for me- it's the best finale of any Yes song, ever.<br />The bonus tracks are anything but essential.  However, they are very pleasant, especially 'Montreux's Theme.'  'Vevey (Revisited)' is nice but overlong.  And you know, it may be a very clich&eacute;d song, but I just love 'Amazing Grace' and Chris Squire's version is very cool(even though it sounds like it was done as a warm-up exercise).  The rehearsals of 'Going For The One,' 'Parallels,' and 'Turn Of The Century' are kind of asinine, but it is cool to hear 'Turn Of The Century' done with an electric guitar.  The same applies to the early version of 'Awaken,' 'Eastern Numbers.'  The intro is very cool but it really sounds unfinished, like the rest of the rehearsals.  Interestingly enough, the running time of the bonus tracks is longer than the running time of the album proper- that makes the CD come in at just a few seconds under the 80-minute mark.  Hey, if you're going to add some bonus tracks, you may as well pack as many in as you can.<br />This, along with The Yes Album, could serve as a very good introduction to Yes for the novice.

B000002H97|5.0|This album is definitely a starter album i'd say, with Enter Sandman being a massive hit with those who aren't into 'that' sort of thing, plus several other mentionable titles like &quot;The Unforgiven&quot; Seemingly different to alot of the other stuff they've done beforehand, to later be followed up in another album with &quot;The Unforgiven II&quot; (a personal fave, but most prefer the first one). Overall this CD is very listenable to, and will carry on being a firm favourite in years to come.
B000060P79|5.0|all the songs i would give 5 stars.i love this CD. i am so glad that i bought it and it was cheaper on amazon. if you like this CD you might like AAR or Evanescence.
B000069HK2|5.0|This album is by FAR one of my favorites EVER (second only to Finch's &quot;What It Is To Burn&quot;). There is a perfectly blended mix of singing, screaming, and poetic lyrics. From start to finish, &quot;The Used&quot; takes you on a wonderfully guided journey. &quot;Maybe Memories&quot; (my favorite track) is an oddly uplifting song, while &quot;Bulimic&quot; and &quot;Taste Of Ink&quot; show off the more poetic, meaningful side of The Used; while tracks such as &quot;Say Days Ago&quot; and &quot;Blue And Yellow&quot; hit hard with unforgettable musical beats. Probably the single BEST song from this album is &quot;Poetic Tragedy&quot; which shows off lead singer Bert McCracken's true vocal talents. &quot;A Box Full Of Sharp Objects,&quot; the CD's third single, while fairly simple lyrically, excels beyond expectations with its melodic mix of singing and screaming. All-in-all, &quot;The Used&quot; is a must-have for just about any music fan simply for its diversity.
B000001FDQ|5.0|If you want to buy an Yngwie album, and you don't know where to start, get this one. This is one of the greatest pieces of work for the electric guitar in my opinion. Songs like Black Star, Icarus' Dream Suite op. 4, and Far Beyond the Sun are classics. He was so far ahead of his time, that when this album came out it blew everyone away, he completly changed the way the guitar was played. You have to remember that when you listen to this album to truely understand how special it is. This album is a staple in any shredders collection and must not go unoticed. If you like this album pick up Marching Out and Trilogy also.
0060005424|5.0|This book is the sequence to \\"Sabriel\\". In the book Sabriel, Garth Nix takes us through the basics of Charter Magic, the Old Kingdom and the responsibility of the Abhorsen. If you haven't already read \\"Sabriel\\", then I suggest you do so right away before reading this book because if not, you will be missing out on some very important facts. <br />Fourteen years after the Abhorsen defeated Kerrigor, a greater source of evil is at work once again. Sabriel and Touchstone are doing everything the can to stop a necromancer from continuing to pursue his plans of destruction. However, little do they know that they will not be the only ones that will be trying to stop this necromancer.<br />Lirael is a Daughter of the Clayr. The Clayr's main characteristic is to See the future. However, at age 14, when most of the Clayr's have already received the gift of Sight, Lirael feels like an outcast. Added to this is the fact that she has dark hair and brown eyes, unlike the Clayr's blond hair, and blue or green eyes. Lirael, depressed and ashamed, decides to commit suicide. After a couple of coincidental encounters, Lirael is still alive when she is nineteen, but she still has no Sight. She thinks that the Sight is the only thing that matters, but that is until she is assigned a task where she will have to fight many Dead and where she will discover her true identity.<br />\\"Lireal\\" is an excellent fantasy book with so much action that reader's will just speed through the pages. It is just as good as Sabriel and Garth Nix is very faithful to his style of writing. There is never one boring part in this whole book, and that is quite an achievement for a book as long as this one. I cannot wait to get my hands on a copy of the final book in the trilogy, \\"Abhorsen\\". I highly recommend this book, especially to fantasy lovers and adolescents or even young adults.
B00000I14Z|5.0|If traditional jazz can be compared to arithmetic, you might say that Charlie Parker composed algebra, Monk worked in geometry, and Mingus entered the realms of calculus.  The songs on this album have the cerebral quality of the best be bop, and the swing of Duke Ellington.  For those unfamiliar with Mingus, don't be put off by the fact that he was a bassist.  He does solo, but he knew enough not to expect non-musicians to sit through extended bass passages.  While the music is complex, layer upon layer of rich sounds, it is also extremely accesable to anyone who loves jazz.
0064471837|5.0|18 year-old Sabriel was raised in Ancelstierre and her dad, a necromancer, only came to see her during the holidays. It was during these rare visits that Sabriel read parts from The Book of the Dead, which is like a necromancer's Bible. However, Sabriel is not ready to become the Abhorsen and fight a Dead so great she never could have imagined actually existed. But when her Father is trapped in Death, she has no other choice if she is to save him from passing through the Ninth and final Gate of Death. By taking the necromancer's bells and her Father's sword, Sabriel is in for an exciting and dangerous adventure.<br />Since the book \\"Sabriel\\" takes place in this new world, it is a bit hard to understand the concept of Death and Charter Magic. However, Garth Nix pulls it off beautifully and explains these things without making the story boring and adding too much description. \\"Sabriel\\" is, in my opinion, an excellent book for fantasy lovers. Though it could be a bit dark at times, this just creates a scarier atmosphere. This is great book that might make you shiver in fright or disgust at times, but always keeps you coming back for more.
080013558X|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of Annie in general... something about annoying ten-year-olds.  This goes for all versions.  (In my day, I could have been Annie, but that's a different story).  And I don't like the song &quot;Tommorow&quot; so there you go.  I happen to like this film version for oh... four reasons.  Burnett, Curry, Reinking, and Peters.  There's a lot of talk comparing the 1999 and 1982 version, but for me, I like the darkness and the characterization of '82.  I would have liked to seen &quot;NYC&quot; in this movie instead of &quot;Let's Go See the Movies&quot;.  And of course, neither Annie really impressed me.  But that's why I gave it a three.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I've loved Tool for a long time, and when APC's Mer De Noms came out, I bought it mostly because of Maynard. I ended up loving it. So, when I heard about Thirteenth Step, I jumped on it. Sweet, riveting, amazing, hypnotic. It is all these things and more. Yes, it is mainly a more mellow album than Mer De Noms, but that's what adds to its glory. I give this album a huge thumbs up. Anyone who likes Tool or APC's first disc should get this, as well as anyone interested in listening to something completely different.
B00006F83Y|5.0|WHen Joshua Homme &amp; co. put out Kyuss' 'Blues For The Red Sun' in 1993, it sounded like the saving grace of rock music, a new breed of metal, stoner metal, and it was supposed to take the world by storm, much like Nirvana did for grunge and Metallica for thrash. Okok, so Blues wasn't a commercial smash, but maybe there was still hope.  1994 - the release year of the greatest rock album ever, '(Welcome To) Sky Valley.'  Wrong again.  Sadly, the genre never caught on, and neither did the band, calling it quits out of pure frustration...damn.<br />Fast forward to 2002, ALL ex-Kyuss members have gone on to new projects, and finally, Homme finds success with the lighter, breezier Queens Of The Stone Age.  Will he ever get the respect he deserves for making some of the greatest rock music ever recorded?  Fck no, and it's a damn shame too.  All you ignorant fcks that reviewed this album (with a few exceptions), get your fcking head straight, and go buy EVERY Kyuss album to find out what Josh Homme has been doing since 1989.  Most of you discovered him with Rated R, and you should be ashamed.<br />QOTSA aren't really a band, more like one BRiLLiANT man at work (for like the thousandth time).  Although the first album was his best, this definately picks up where it left off, Rated R being more like a drugged-out interlude to their saga.  After an inventive opening gag featuring &quot;Kip Kasper&quot;, DJ for LA's CLONE Radio, subtle drumming kicks into gear, and the real fun begins...<br />1.)Millionaire - 10/10 - Originally on a Desert Sessions release, it features super-bassist (and 'Blues'-era Kyuss thumper) Nick Oliveri handling vocal duties.  Starting off soft, and then grabbing you by the fcking balls, its the perfect opener to a near-perfect album.<BR>2.)No One Knows - 10/10 - Of course you know this one, it was the first single.  Still great, and even though I skip it now, I still give it credit for incredibly original songwriting.<BR>3.)First It Giveth - 10/10 -Another perfect 10, 'First' is the brand new single and keeps the flow going with a bit of a Latin-type edge and passionate musicianship.<BR>4.)Song For The Dead - 10/10 - Easily the best track on the album, it's like nothing I've ever heard, nothing J.Ho's ever recorded anyway.  Not Kyuss, and not Sabbath, it's something new and in a class by itself.  It's epic in size and volume, and the drumming by Grohl is perfect.  Consitently blows me away time after time.  I think they're acutally playing to the dead in the song...<BR>5.)The Sky Is Fallin' - 9/10 - A Different, robotic track, I loved it the first couple of times, but it is just dragged out way too long.  I know that Josh &amp; Nick like to be obnoxious, but sometimes it gets ridiculous, as in this case.  Incredible the for first 3 minutes, though.<BR>6.)Six Shooter - 6/10 - Once you realize that it's really just shot at filler tracks, as a few other songs are also, you'll enjoy it.<BR>7.)Hangin' Tree - 9/10 - Obviously written for Lanegan, Josh just allows him to grasp the melodies with his smoky, whiskey-infused voice.  Excellent and one of the most original tracks on the album.<BR>8.)Go With The Flow - 9/10 - Great, lush, melodic pop-rock.  Full of fruitful keyboards and guitar, with a rambling bass and drum section, it made for a great single.<BR>9.)Gonna Leave You - 7/10 - The second track to the pop section of the album, decent track, just basic pop-rock.  It shows that QOTSA want to break new molds, and they know that the results may vary.<BR>10.)Do It Again - 8/10 - This is the track that describes why Queens have been dubbed &quot;Slack Rock.&quot;  Super laid-back track, and it like it!<BR>11.)God Is In The Radio - 10/10 - Original as fck, it picks up where 'Hangin' Tree' left off, excellent creeping melodies, and Grohl's best track, drumming-wise.<BR>12.)Another Love Song - 7/10 - Looks like Josh stil has time for some kidding around, placing an obivous filler between two amazing tracks.  It's basically just a &quot;CLONE&quot; of 'Gonna Leave You.'<BR>13.)Song For The Deaf - 10/10 - Creepy...a frighteningly violent track, it was written to showcase what it's like to be deaf, especially when loss of hearing occurs mid-life.  The bass is superb, so are the vocals, and the drumming, and the little guitar-solo interludes are mindblowing.  QOTSA are the only ones who could pull off a sound like this.<BR>14.)Mosquito Song - 10/10 - Beautiful, to say the least.  Dean Ween (another lost genius) handles the 12-string on this somber track.  Josh's vocals are purposely bland, but you forget about them after the orchestration kicks in.  Why is this song passed off as just a &quot;good song?&quot;  It's one of the best songs ever written.  Why is this whole album passed off in that fashion?  Why is Josh passed off as just another song writer?<br />You must understand J.Ho to understand his concepts and stylings.  There is no one like him, there never will be anyone like him, and I like it that way.  Bottom Line - Joshua Homme is the best-kept secret in music.  So take a bite out of the low desert, you punk motherfckers.
B00006ZCFH|1.0|What happened? No inspiration what so ever can be heard on this BS! No great musical arrangements or lyrical content. Badu would have never gotten anywhere if this were her debut CD. Save your money. Don't even get a bootleg of this stinker.
B000000H8M|5.0|Simply put this album is in my opinion the very best of the older Diamond/Fate stuff. Songs like Charon and Portrait truly sum up what King Diamond is all about, over the top vocals, screaming guitar rifts and a [good] story! All of his albums seem to sound different, perhaps that's his intention with the ever changing band members, and this one represents some of the cleanest guitar and best head banging music that the great King has ever given us! I've got every one of the King Diamond and Mercyful Fate albums and for the pre 1990 era I play this one more than any other! I'd highly recommend this one to anyone who's ready to embrace some very hard and heavy early Diamond!
B000002MP2|5.0|Dookie is quite possibly the most impressive punk cd there is in that green day made such a huge nationwide splash WITHOUT SELLING OUT (that would come later with &quot;time of your life&quot;).  <BR>Dookie is by far the best green day album they ever made (except maybe Insomniac) due to its better sound quality and lack of sappy teenage themes of previous albums, and its pre-sellout sound and attitude.  Billie Joe's &quot;life sucks&quot; attitude backed by Tre' Cool's impressive beats, Mike Dirnt's walking basslines, and his own frantic powerchords create the recipe for the ultimate punk album....My personal preferences: Basket Case and When I Come around, but the rest of the album kicks ass too.
B00005JM02|5.0|I went to the blockbusters and checked out the movies for the year and I put this one at the top of my list.  If you ask why, I will tell you that it made me laugh out loud, which is something that isn't very common for movies I have seen recently.  It is a great movie!  Just sitting back and watching the great visual stimulation while enjoying a clean humor filled laugh!  I actually saw the movie twice and still laughed!  If you are hardcore adult action film watcher, this might not be up your alley, but if you enjoy watching something different with a cute plot and lots of humor this is your movie!  The kids and adults alike will really enjoy the different characters and the voice actors to go along with them.  The casting was wonderfully done!  I was surprised that Dory's voice was Ellen.  I couldn't pick it out and had to watch the credits.  Again I stress that if you are going to see a movie that you need to Finding Nemo!  One of the best films of the year!!!
B00005JKC3|1.0|This movie is simply awful. I don't see how anyone would like it. The acting is horrible, the plot is horrible, the special effects are amazing (that's the only redeeming quality of this terrible movie. I almost turned green and muscular because I paid to see this ... thing! Other than the action sequences this movie will bore you to tears! Perhaps if you cut them out you could use this DVD as a cure for insomnia!! Nuff said!
0743424425|5.0|I read The Shining with Carrie and Salem's Lot in a multi-novel book in April. Compared to the other two, The Shining creates a catagory all of its own. It's amazing how he pieced this novel together.<br />It begins with a family moving up to the Overlook Hotel. The father is to be the caretaker so the family gets to live there during the winter while it is closed. One the first day they are there, a boy (the only child in the family) meets the cook, and finds out a little bit about how he &quot;shines&quot;.<br />As our story continues, we learn more about the family, as well as the history of this hotel. And as more is revealed, the fear and horror builds. The rising action is magnificent, and the father's corruption was absolutely brilliant.<br />With a climax that will blow your mind, and characters that feel like you can reach out and touch, The Shining is one of King's top five best books he's written. I reccomend this book to fans of the genre, and also to people interested in reading a good book. The Shining is just plain entertaining, and you'll think about it for months after closing it, only to open it up again and relive the adventure one more time.<br />- MB
B00001OH7Y|5.0|Released in the fall of 1980, Scary Monsters was the disc that all Bowie's previous LPs were leading up to, and the one to which all subsequent recordings are compared. Bowie has made more commercially successful music, and has produced more experimental, progressive music, but in Scary Monsters he strikes the perfect balance between pop and art. The music sounds better today than it did in 1980, largely because so much music produced in the past 20 years has been so bad. Take it from someone who has everything Bowie's recorded - it does not get any better than this.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Whether talking about great literature or great movie making, one of the hallmarks of both is for a creative hand to draw a portrait of a perfectly realized time or place that would not have occured to us, had not some genius come along and showed it to us. Tolkien's Middle Earth. Hugo's Paris sewers. Celine's nightmare, apocalyptic landscapes. Now we have Martin Scorsese's/Jay Cocks' warped, wonderful vision/hallucination of 19th century New York.<br /> I resided in NY for many years and I sometimes wondered where the term &quot;Hell's Kitchen&quot; originated. Now I know. This movie offers a bird's-eye/God's-eye perspective of a brutal, awesome slice of NYC history, concentrating on a small area of Manhatten known at the time as &quot;Five Points.&quot; An area ruled over by Bill, &quot;The Butcher&quot; Cutting, the most amazing, gruesome, threatening personage to be depicted in the history of cinema, perhaps. The combination of Daniel Day Lewis and Martin Scorsese is positively lethal. Do not watch if you are currently taking heart medication. You remember those old adverts for The Screaming Skull? Well be advised that this pic will do major damage to your aorta if you're not careful. It is a postcard sent from the lower regions of the Inferno. A three + hour nightmare from the other side of the Styx. Don't forget to give Charon a good tip or your way back or you're likely to take up permanent residence! Not a happy prospect, trust me!! Rent (or follow my lead and purchase) this movie! This film didn't win any major Academy Awards? Brody over Daniel Day? What are those people smoking out there? Oh right. The really good stuff!! That explains it!!<br />BEK
B000084T18|3.0|I think when people approach this cd they should do it without thinking of all the hype surrounding him. Now honestly the beats to me hands down were all hot like many cds today. As for the lyrics though only half the songs were good. I really rate this a 3.5 but if he talked about more things than just the typical I would have given it more stars. I cant hate on 50 cents even though I see a lot of other reviews doing just that. These things are his life experience (which just happens to be the same experience of many others) and like other artists he just put it into his music. Now whats good here?:<br />*In da Club<BR>*What up Gangsta<BR>*Patiently Waiting<BR>*Many Men<BR>*If I cant<BR>*P.I.M.P<BR>*Poor Lil Rich -- One of the tightest beats on the cd<BR>*21 Questions<br />Overall 50 gave you himself as best as he could on this without pretending to be anything else but 50. It is not the best cd ever made like the media has hyped it to be but it is a good cd and anyone who likes hip-hop/rap over hot beats will like this. Lyrically its not the best but at least half the songs he shows you how to put both lyrics and beats together.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Amazing, this is simply amazing, there is no better way to put it. This is one of the best live albums I have ever had. This is an live album that could go hand in hand with Zeppelins How The West Was Won, and Aerosmith's Little South Of Sanity. All the songs sound great here and the fact that they used a syphany is just awesome, I dont care what people say that isnt selling out, thats just plain brilliant! The song 'No Leaf Clover' is amazing, one of the better songs Metallica has ever made, I mean it really is. So if your a Metallica fan you must own this you will love it, there is nothing like live Metallica!
0811836363|5.0|Having being born after The Beatles broke up my discovery of the band's work occurred progressively in my high school years, as I got exposed to the bulk of their work and exploded when I got to College and first listened to the last leg of their recordings (after Sgt. Pepper). This alone would suffice for anyone to have enough respect for their music, however the Anthology book opened up a whole new dimension that was unfamiliar to me.<br />Going chronologically from their beginnings, the book is structured year by year, intercalating comments by each of them (George Martin, the fifth Beatle included, as well as several other people involved with them), flowing in a way that feels as if you were sitting with them in your living room, sipping a cup of tea (or coffee, if you prefer) while listening to the fab four talk about their lives while they were together. This effect is so impeccable that it's what I love most about the book.<br />Now, that's obviously not all. The 368 pages of the book (yes, it has 368, and the last one is a very Lennon-like &quot;handwritten&quot; statement saying &quot;By hook or by crook I'll be last in this book -John Lennon&quot;) are beautifully packaged along with tons of pictures, copies of letters, posters, etc. that complement magnificently the already outstanding document that the &quot;chat&quot; between them represents.<br />Three years after its release it remains an awesome gift and an endless source of information. I am sure it will remain that way for a very long time.
B000059HCN|2.0|when I saw this, I really got really bored. um, yeah ok shes taking a lot of pills and shes becoming addictive. stuff like that, and basically its a stinker of a movie and I did not like it one bit but it had some powerful moments and some disturbing images that can keep locked in your head after its done, but primarily I just got sick of it in the middle. Though Leto and especially Connelley give great performances
B000093BDX|3.0|The Beach Boys are one of my favorite bands, but how many &quot;Best of&quot; and &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; compilations do the Beach Boys really need?
1573229725|5.0|At first, I was put off by the first few chapters. They were slow and I couldn't relate to any of the characters. I decided, after reading several reviews here on Amazon to pick the book back up. I am so glad I did. This is the first Sarah Water's novels I've read and I can hardly wait to get my hands on another. Fingersmith was beautifully written. The characters were stunning. I especially loved Maud. She was described so well. I was mesmerized by her soft nature and sensitivity. This book is a page turner. I highly recommend it!!
B000002HMH|4.0|This is a relly great and underated album, it may not be as good as Reload but this is a great album none the less. 'Until It Sleeps' is with out a doubt the best song on the album. This is a strong and concistant album and I know its not Master Of Puppets or Ride The Lightning but this is really a good album. It has hard tracks, and great riffs and solos, and Hetfields voice sounds great. This may not be the fastest Metallica album but is still great none the less, but falls short of Reload.

B000066NW0|1.0|Look there are some really stupid people in this world like the people who say Avril writes her own stuff and is original *cough* Rolling Stone and every other music mag *cough* they are dumb and brainless.  They seem like they are brain washed by MTV and pop mainstream.  It seems like everyone who likes her is either 40 years old and like the Osmonds or is 12 years old and is too stupid for themselves.  Personally I can't wait till 5 years from now when we can make fun of her on tv (with Gimp Trizkit and Fakey Spears).  If you are going to by this album get the Velvet Underground and Nico album then listen to both and if you still like this album then slap yourself and say to your self &quot; I have no musical taste I am a puppet I hate my life&quot; and we all will be happier why you will be shunned.
B00005JLRT|2.0|I must've seen a different film from what some folks have written about here.  The Next Gen crowd is always fun to watch, but &quot;Nemesis&quot; was BAD.  I don't own the DVD, and I don't plan to, even though I own a copy of Star Trek V, which was just plain awful.  (Nothin' but love for ya, Bill, but that was a stinker.)<br />If you want a cool, interesting plot, this is NOT the film for you.  In fact, if you want a plot at all, this isn't the film for you.  There is something resembling a plot, but it may have been a cast-off episode for Leave it to Beaver.  This film just made no sense.  How has Shinzon lived this long without Picard's blood?  Makes no sense.  Why is there only one of those individual transporter gadgets?  Makes no sense.  Why is Riker having a knife fight ON the Enterprise, without a phaser, by himself?  Why don't they use the transporters to capture and subdue the intruder?  Makes no sense.  There are, indeed, acts of tremendous valor, but EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM IS POINTLESS.  You get the feeling watching the cast that they're hoping the next scene will provide some explanation of where this film is going (sorry gang, never happens.)<br />Finally, let's talk for a moment about the space battles.  The writers, director and production crew went back to what has become a staple of the Next Gen movies: let's blow up the Enterprise.  They crashed the Enterprise D.  They had the self-destruct set to pop in &quot;First Contact&quot; (which other than that cliche' was a fine film).  I have tried to block &quot;Insurrection&quot; out of my memory.  Maybe they blew up the ship then too, I don't want to remember.  They shoot the Enterpise to bits in this one for no discernable reason.<br />You know, Roddenberry had a concept about a future where humanity was struggling to better itself.  In Picard's best moments, he embodies that.  Kirk did, too (we've got a million years of savage blood on our hands, but we're not going to kill TODAY!&quot;)  However,the entire franchise has gotten away from thoughtful science fiction and has turned into just another shoot 'em up.  The last two Trek films were no better than &quot;Wing Commander&quot; or the last &quot;Godzilla&quot; remake.  Don't even get me started on what the &quot;Trek Killers&quot; of Berman and Co. are doing with the &quot;Enterprise&quot; series.  Ugh.<br />Khan is great sci-fi in general, not just great Trek.  The Voyage Home was fun.  I personally think Star Trek VI was the best of all the films, because there were almost no space battles.  The one at the end was quick and purposeful, and the lion's share of the film is spent with the characters figuring out an interstellar conspiracy.  Heavens, a plot.  What an unusual thing.<br />Why can we not ask for more from good sci-fi?  This franchise has the support to pull it off, but the powers that be are intent on killing it.  Between the horror of &quot;Phantom Menace&quot; (somewhat redeemed by &quot;Attack of the Clones&quot;) and &quot;Nemesis,&quot; our two most successful, most beloved franchises meandered off into irrelevance.  I can only hope there's someone with a fresh idea out there now.  Joss Whedon, Kevin Smith, James Cameron?  Are you listening?  Save us!
0345409671|5.0|I loved this book.  This is how I would like to believe if there truly is a devil.  The real struggle between good and evil.
B000002JNN|5.0|I love this album almost as much as I love Back In Black, which is probly the greatest album of all time! The gutar work here is amazing Angus and Malcom play some of their best riffs, and Angus' solos are amazing, and the best example of those two things is 'Thunderstruck' Brian Johnson has a great voice and I love the way he sounds here. Some of the highlight tracks are 'ThunderStruck' 'Moneytalks' and 'The Razors Edge' even though every song is a kepper here those are the ones that stood out the most to me personaly. AC/DC was (KINDA) in a slump with their albums until they recorded this, this is easily one of their best albums, it could easily go hand in hand against Highway To Hell, and that is saying a lot concedering that was their best album with former Singer Bon Scott.

1401200613|5.0|Loeb has proved himself to be one of the best Batman writers around, and Lee was already a comic book legend after his run on X-Men. Together, they have created one of the most intriquing Batman stories in recent memory, at least one that takes place in the actual continuity of the Bat-books. <br />    Vol. 1 collects the first five issues in the 12-part &quot;Hush&quot; storyline. This first installment sets up much of what is to come in this storyline, introducing Bruce Wayne's boyhood friend Tommy, and the mysterious bandaged stranger unofficially dubbed Hush, who really, really has it out for Bats and can get at him (I spoil nothing for anyone by stating that my prediction is that Tommy and bandage-face will turn out to be the same person). <br />      Lee's take on the world of Batman is simply stunning; he is producing the art of his career on this run. I love his take on Killer Croc, who finally actually looks like a monstrous human crocodile the way Lee draws him. Superman pops up, and while it's cool to see Lee draw him as well (before he takes over the artistic reins on a Superman comic after this Batman run), I'm sick of Batman and Supes getting pared up, it's been done TO DEATH! ENOUGH ALREADY, THEIR CONTRASTS AS CHARACTERS AREN'T ENOUGH TO  WARRANT THESE ENDLESS TEAM UPS!!!   Ahem.  Anyway, I can't wait to read the end of this storyline in a few days and find out who this 'Hush' guy is...
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I was first introduced to Tool through Lateralus, and then I heard about APC. I downloaded mer de noms, but I didn't like it at first. there were to many downtempo songs, with not enough faster, angrier songs. Thirteenth step makes up for this though, with almost every song having a very tool-like feel to it. The bass on here is very prevelant, and is used as melody at some times. The songs are not so much meditative and happy type songs, but they are more of the angry type. &quot;The Package&quot; &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; &quot;The Noose&quot; and &quot;Pet&quot; are my favorites, but they are all good except for tracks 4,9,11. These songs don't really apppeal to me, mainly because they are downright sappy and awkward, and they don't fit well with the songs around them. This is one of the best CDs I own, and it takes it's place up there with Tool, NIN and Dredg.
0783211856|5.0|With this film Steven Spielberg has proven his tremendous range as a director. From purely entertaining, escapist fare like \\"Close Encounters\\" and \\"Jaws\\" to touching dramas like \\"A Color Purple\\" and \\"Always.\\" But for a director to go from creating the hugely successful thriller \\"Jurassic Park\\" to such a profound drama as \\"Schindler's List\\" is simply staggering. In all its gritty realism, Spielberg presents images that will sear a permanent place in the viewer's mind. His representation of Nazi brutality is utterly bone chilling. I saw this film with a sold-out house at the Uptown Theatre in Washington, D.C. Not only will I never forget my emotional reaction to it, but also of reaction by those around me. The emotional outpouring ranged from sobbing to actual outbursts by some elderly viewers, who were so caught up by the film's intensity, that they shouted aloud obscenities at the Nazi characters on the screen. Never have I sat through a film that had such a profound impact on its audience. I'll never forget that experience. With his brilliant, unflinching vision Steven Spielberg has given the world one of the greatest cinematic events in a generation.
B00009KMEO|5.0|This album is amazing and I still have this cd in my car after 4 months.  No, not every song could be put on the radio, but what cd ever has that?  If you like Beyonce, then you will love the album.  Every song has her certain thang to her which is why her fans love her, and why everyone in the world will soon love her
B00008PW3Q|4.0|Plain and simple, being a young fleetwood mac fan, I was quite anxious to see a new disc to see if they still had it.  I love their old stuff, but new stuff is great too.  keeps it fresh!  I love all of the songs that Stevie has main vocals on......definitely a keeper.  The toronto show by the way was awesome, a great band to see live!

0451167716|5.0|Not many works of fiction can claim to have significantly changed the face of American culture; Mario Puzo's classic novel The Godfather is surely one of those. Look at the evidence: This book (and the wonderful cinematic counterpart) reintroduced the gangster as an American icon. It helped to spawn entire new genres in fiction and films. (Some critics suggest there should be an entirely new designation for this genre and have dubbed it &quot;The Eastern&quot;.) Of course, it introduced that classic catchphrase &quot;I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.&quot; Finally, it introduced one of the great heroic criminals into literature in the person of Don Vito Corleone (a character reportedly based on Puzo's own mother). Yes, it is true that the movie and not the novel must take much of this credit, but this work is hardly the two-star pulp trash that a few misguided critics have made it to be. It's solid all the way through, particularly the fabulous portrayals of the ruthless gentleman Don Vito and his family, epecially  the sons: hotheaded Sonny (whose penchant for needless violence proves fatal), cowardly Freddie (who is spooked by the Don's near-assasination and runs away to Las Vegas), and, most memorably, cool, reserved Michael (who, in the end, proves a tactical genius truly worthy to be called his father's son.) Also, don't forget the fabulous cast of supporting characters: singers Johnny Fontaine and Nino Valenti (read: Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin), and the many minor players such as Luca Brasi and Amerigo Bonserai, who literally owe their very existence to the Don's generosity. And the women!!! Such marvels of strength, tenacity and character presented in blindly obidient Connie, questioning Kay, and the Don's own wife, who knows much more than she reveals. Her tutoring of Kay into the Sicilian way of life ends the book on a high note. Puzo makes these character studies work because he gives each person his own little spotlight; by chapter's end, you know why each one has chosen to become a family member or confidant. The chapters showing the Don's rise to power, subsequent fall, and rebirth are the highpoints of the book, as the newer, more ruthless families seek to destroy the Corleone's sacred honor by forcing them into trafficking drugs. Yes, in the end, it is Michael who prevails, but the action is so good that the climax is not spoiled by knowing the outcome in advance. The reader will want to visit this novel time and again for it's unique perspectives on honor, justice, and The American Dream.
0345423496|2.0|A millennia later, man is still baffled by the mystery of the monoliths.  First introduced in \\"2001\\", the monoliths - enigmatic stones built by an advanced race - provided guidance to the first generations of prehistoric hominids (in the prolog to \\"2001\\", we meet a tribe of ape-men, just descended to the savannah's, and hovering over extinction.  A monolith educates the hominids as to how to fight off marauding predators, and that fattened wildebeests can be as nutritious as a tree full of berries).  If not for the monoliths, man might have gone the way of countless extinct species.  Later on, at the end of the 20th century, another monolith is discovered in the moon.  The implication is that while the first device was meant to educate man, the second was meant to alert its creators as to his technological achievements.  An expedition to the moons of Jupiter to trace the signal left by the moon-monolith ends in apparent tragedy.  Most of the crew - kept in suspended animation - are killed off by HAL-9000, the ship's computer.  Another crew member, astronaut Frank Poole, was apparently killed by the computer while repairing a faulty antenna outside of their ship.  Only Dave Bowman survived long enough to complete the mission and reach the moons of Jupiter...where he disappeared.  In the first sequel, \\"2010\\", we learnt that Bowman was found by alien intelligence and evolved into some hyper-sentient being with responsibility of continuing the work begin by the first monoliths - an epic program to evolve life on the frozen moon of Europa.  Turning Jupiter into a min-sun, and its moons into miniature worlds, the minds behind the monolith nurse the possibility of burgeoning non-human life-forms within our solar system as a possible replacement for us.  Clarke continued the saga in \\"2061\\", more of an afterthought or an oversized novella than a novel, in which he broaches the possibility that the monoliths, for their seeming divine powers, are still just machines which canbe knocked on their sides.  Unfortunately, Clarke did little to enhance the premise with a slim story involving Heywood Floyd (now an aged retiree looking to guild his sunset years with a trip to Haley's comet), his grandson, South African expatriates, an unauthorized landing on Europa (the one moon man was not permitted to explore) and a diamond the size of a mountain.<br />In \\"3001\\", Clarke promises to take us further, but doesn't.  He returns Frank Poole - who wasn't killed when he floated off into space near Saturn, but merely fell into suspended animation.  Much of the first half of \\"3001\\" has Poole learning of man's technical feats (brain caps, towers that stretch from Earth into orbit) before returning him to space.  In fact \\"3001\\" takes an insufferable amount of time telling us how cool the future is before it gets around to telling us what the story is actually about.  That wouldn't be much of a problem if Clarke's vision of the future was all that compelling.  Instead, it's pretty much a hyper-advanced version of what we have today - replacing desktop PC's and the internet with brain-caps (an optimistic version of the sinister \\"capping\\"  devices of Christopher \\"Tripods\\" trilogy?).  Computing, Clarke assures us, is much more advanced - though it's still a matter of numbers (petabytes and terabytes over megabytes and gigabytes; what's actually done with all of this capacity is never really explained.  Clarke's futurism requires that this new age be more enlightened than our own, though it just as likely gave us more websites devoted to entertainment news and sports).  Near the end, we get an idea of what \\"3001\\" is about - the monoliths return.  <br />Unfortunately, Clarke's futurism kicks in - the monoliths are a threat because their observations of Earth were based on Earth's medieval past (actually our present) before the world became host to a truly civilized age.  Poole must now find a way to sabotage the monolith before it can inform its creators as tothe evils of our own age.  \\"3001\\" represents a branch of sci-fi/fantasy epitomized by C.S. Lewis as the \\"snobbery of chronology\\", in which technology is not the only advance futuristic humans will have achieved over their backward ancestors (futurism takes moral and cultural superiority of the future as a given and seldom explains how or why Buck Rogers or Jean Luc Picard never sullied their minds with infomercials or talk-shows; typically, some catastrophic event, like a nuclear war, intervened between our horrid era and the golden age).  In that respect, \\"3001\\" is so close to form, that it's the least genuinely futuristic or compelling entries in the \\"Odyssey\\" saga.  Instead, pick up either of the first 2 books.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I watched a newscast after the movie opened and the newscaster said that she didn't get the movie. She didn't get the first one. Her co-anchored keenly observed that \\"she was not deep.\\"<br />The action was awesome in this movie, much better, as it should be than the first. The dialogue was sparse but meaningful. A lot more action and visual communication than the first. <br />You have to be able to make the leap from the first movie to the second. I would recommend viewing \\"The Matrix\\" if your memory is a little shaky before viewing \\"The Matrix Reload.\\" It may make more sense.<br />This is not mindless entertainment, it is thoughtful and thought provoking entertainment.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I am glad Norah Jones came on the scene. I am a 22 year old with a wide variety in music. Norah is now one of my favorites. She is just all about the music. Instead of selling pre fabricated music, nudity, rauchy dance moves, she makes you sit and enjoy the music with her. So relaxing. Thank you for the wonderful music Miss  Norah Jones.
B000099T2L|2.0|This CD disappointed me because I was expecting more high energy dance songs like the hits Crazy in Love &amp; Baby Boy.<br />However,after these songs on the CD, it winds down to a slow ballad tempo for all remaining songs - good for setting a romantic mood, or falling asleep to. <br />If you're buying this CD because you like the hits on the radio, I would recommend buying the singles instead - wish I did!
B0000BWVCM|2.0|This movie was OK. The plot was a pretty good. I guess I'm just nto the type for these movies. But if you enjoy these type of movies and you loved the first one, you'll probably like this one. I found it a little boring, but it is really action-packed (as I repeat I'm not liking these movies so you'll probably like it if you do) Hmm.. it was well - played but I didn't like the focus on the wolf-man guy (With the claws) THAT was a tad bit boring. But overall it was OK.
B00005QFHG|5.0|Like Mary Poppins, Chocolat is a classic tale of the transforming power of the Feminine in the face of patriarchal oppression.<br />The absurdly talented Binoche, Depp, Dench and Molina lead a cast made in heaven in this most magical of movies. Even on a simplistic level, this is a gorgeous love story which unfolds intelligently and concludes satisfyingly.<br />Chocolat is also a visual delight and remains one of the most beautiful and well crafted films I have ever seen.
B00005JLYW|4.0|The acting was pretty good, the funny stuff was there but the plot was a little \\"out of there\\". I think it was sort of silly for Dillan to have changed her name like that before. Dillan changed her name to Dillan because of her boyfriend whos coming back for revenge. Well, I saw this movie in theatres it was a litle weird and confusing and I was sort of zoning out. But 4 stars for well acted, funny film. But 1 star loss for the trashy-ness of this movie. I might buy this movie - its \\"fun\\" but I'm not too sure yet.
B000094HMU|4.0|If you want a conventional production of Turandot -- i.e., one that attempts to set the opera in some interpretation of ancient China -- this is the one for you.  As usual with Zeffirelli productions at the Met, no expense is spared in producing the spectacle.  Peking in Act I is depicted in a multi-level set as a teeming hive of activity, amongst which Mandarins and soldiers push their way.  The emperor's palace in Act II, Scene 2, is as lush as any illustration in any edition of Grimm's Fairy Tales.  The chorus and extras probably double the number used in most productions. The costumes are varied and rich in detail.  And so on...<br />None of this is meant to be a criticism, just a description of the production values.  The Met assembled an impressive cast to handle the big four roles, and they handled them all well.  Eva Marton and Kathleen Battle both sing well and appear lovely in the roles of the female protagonists.  Placido Domingo illustrates in his portrayal of Calaf why he is the primario of the so-called three tenors.  Paul Plishka sings the somewhat lesser role of Timur at a level of intensity and ability commensurate with the rest of the cast.<br />My criticisms, admittedly small, with this performance lie in two areas.  First, the three ministers, Ping, Pang, and Pong, generally seem to fade into the background.  The Met reached into its stable of comprimarios to cast these roles, and it shows.  They don't compare well to the enormous primario horsepower that appears on the stage.<br />Second, a few Zeffirelli tricks don't work.  Primary among these is the replacement of the singing Ping, Pang, and Pong with masked dancers during the trial scene.  The &quot;masks&quot; cavort around and pull flags out of Turandot's back as Calaf successfully answers the three riddles.  Now what is this all about? <br />Nonetheless, if you have never seen Turandot, this isn't a bad starting point.  Then, when you have it down, go take a look at the San Francisco and Saltzburg productions.  The contrasts will make you wonder what would have happened had Puccini lived only a couple of years more.
B00009XITP|3.0|This movie is completely crazy! Its a predictable, wacky teenage movie as well as fun-filled and cool! Amanda Bynes does a pretty good job of playing Daphne - the story line is \\"fun\\" and I would reccomend that you go watch this with your friends. However, if your not into \\"predictable teenage fun\\" movies then dont buy this or let alone watch this. Because thats all it is. Great film.
0790729377|5.0|In 1950, prodicer Charles Feldman brought Vivien Leigh and Marlon Brando together in order to repeat their theatre-successes(she in London - him on Broadway) og Blanche DuBois and Stanley Kowalski.<br />It became a landmark film.<br />It is a fascinating study of old-timer classical actress Leigh - versus the method prince Brando. THEY ARE DYNAMITE together and the film remains as powerful as it was in 1951.<br />Elia Kazan remained not ON MY SIDE however and claimed she had a small talent, but would have walked on broken glass if she thought it would have helped her career.<br />However; the so-called purists have always been sceptical about the combination of beauty AND talent.<br />A credit to Vivien Leigh: Like all her post-Scarlett-roles; her Blanche is a character made by Leigh and totally unlike Vivien`s other performances.
079284131X|2.0|I love childs play but the format for this dvd version is horrible. IT is in standard instead of widescreen. This normally is not a problem but the PAN AND SCAN transfer is horrible. It goes downhill throughout the movie. Scenes are blurry and badly pixelated. You can only see half of the credits at the end because the screen chops them off. The finale of the movie is bad because you can't see chucky! HE is cut out! Wait for a special widescreen edition or a better film transfer.

B000046PVN|5.0|From the original 2 LP vinyl recording to the &quot;special price&quot; one-disc CD release, I've owned every available version of John Williams' 1978 score for Richard Donner's Superman: The Movie. And even though I enjoyed all of those versions, there always seemed to be something missing from the various tracks.<br />Okay, so the London Symphony Orchestra (under the baton of the composer) still had that powerful timbre and the music was thrilling, but wasn't the main title music in the movie, well, a bit longer? And wasn't there a heckuva lot more music in the nearly three-hour movie than in any of the LPs, cassettes, or the first CD version?  (At least in the first CD version the label warns consumers that two tracks had been removed!)<br />Finally, more than 20 years after the premiere of Superman: The Movie, Warner Bros. and ace producer Nick Redman teamed up to present the complete score to this awesome comic book epic.  At last, Williams'legions of fans can now hear the Prologue and Main Title as they were presented in the film, and several other previously unreleased tracks -- some never used in the final cut of the movie -- are heard for the first time.  Also, as in other Redman-produced re-issues, the cues appear in chronological order, following the plot of Superman from beginning to end. In addition, alternative versions of the Superman March and the &quot;Can You Read My Mind&quot; vocal have been included.<br />The Superman: The Movie 2-disc set comes in a jacketed slimline jewel case and includes an illustrated booklet of liner notes and commentary by Christopher Reeve and others.<br />For Williams fans and lovers of film music, this version of the Superman score is indeed Super, man.
B00008H2LB|2.0|It really took me a long time to find something I liked about this album, but after a while, it grew on me, and while I doubt it'll ever grow on me to the point where I give it any more than 2 stars, it's got good points.  It unfortunately suffers from an overreliance on programming and a stray away from the band's already-minimal metal influence, but somehow or other, they manage to pull the synth and guitars in enough to make a decent product.  I can't really say it's an improvement over their first album; it's got more good songs but also more filler.  Basically, the tracks on here are either good or garbage.  Nothing great, but also nothing mediocre.  Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good, and there are some tracks that are almost entirely hip-hop.  Hardcore Linkin Park lovers will probably like it, but if you just use LP for an easy-listening deal, then you might want to think twice before investing in this one.
B000059XUT|5.0|When my kids were younger, I used to go with them to the movies they wanted to see.  I sat through a number of mediocre cartoon movies but, occassionally, I got to see a movie that we all really enjoyed.  Tops in that category is &quot;Toy Story&quot;.  This movie is the ideal family movie because it can be enjoyed by every age group.  Younger children seem to enjoy anything as long as it's a cartoon.  Older children can pick up on the jealosies and competition.  Adults will pick up on the subtle banter between the characters.  Everyone will enjoy the humor and there's plenty of excitement and suspense as well.  The art work is very good but the best part are the actors whose voices we hear.  Robin Williams in &quot;Alladin&quot; sets a pretty high mark but the sum total of the quality of all the voice characterizations in &quot;Toy Story&quot; is probably a team record.  From the beginning to the end the movie is entertaining.  Thanks to Randy Newman, it even has good music as well.  This is not a movie to rent, it is a movie to own.
B00005JKHN|5.0|&quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; is truly Walt Disney's finest movie. Disney Studios almost went bankrupt trying to make this film, but Walt believed that it would be a success. When it was released in 1959 audiences embraced this thrilling, romantic, and fun movie. It was second in the overall box office that year. The animation is truly stunning in this movie. One thing that never ceases to amaze me is that the Disney studios always comes up with a fresh new look for every movie that they make, and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; has some of the most impressive animation I have ever seen. I have the seen the movie enough times to be able to look at the tiny details in the animation, and each and every bush and tree has intricate details. This review would not be complete if I did not pay homage to the one that started it all, &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot; which is also a stunning accomplishment. &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; has a whole extra disc of fun features that are worth the money you spend for this DVD, not to mention you get this amazing movie. I am a college student, and this is still my all-time favorite movie. Don't miss out on this classic that is missing from your collection.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I am a highschool student, and have always listened to the top rap and pop songs, and even though I like to listening to them on the radio, i forget about them and move on to the new hits of the week. Ever since I listened to Gavin, i fell in love with his beautiful music. I listen to his songs all day..while doing homework, taking a shower, it even puts me to sleep. I can listen to his songs over and over, but i never am tired of them. He is a genuine musician, and his lyrics are meaningful and touching. I bought the cd of amazon the first day I heard his music, and I have not bought a cd since the 3rd grade. He is unbelievable, and I know I can say his songs will NEVER get old

B0000BYM3K|4.0|After reading the reviews on this album I am surprised with the range of criticisms and praise for it.  I believe it is one of the most creative offerings from Maiden in years.  I really liked &quot;Rainmaker&quot; (great guitar work), &quot;Paschendale&quot; (a Maiden classic, without a doubt), &quot;Journeyman&quot; (very solid, tight, pretty, ...shoot, it is simply a great song), and &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; (it's my favorite on the album--it has hammering riffs, varied and excellent vocal parts, and tough, mean lyrics that cut to the point.  I listen to it over and over.)  There are songs on this album that I can listen to repeatedly while I'm sitting around the house.  I can honestly say that I haven't been able to do that with a Maiden album--and they are my favorite band--since &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot; in 1986.  The negative aspects of the record, for me, are in the all-too-familiar and lukewarm Steve Harris bass intros and slow-then-exploding song structures.  From &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; forward you can see the same tired slow-moving-into-fast song arrangments.  Also, especially with Harry's lyrics, you see the same Weird Dream/Fighting for survival/&quot;War Sucks&quot; themes.  He was a lot more original and aggressive in the early days, but who isn't, I guess...<br />Anyway, Brave New World and Dance of Death are, IMHO, the finest one-two musical punch since Somewhere in Time and Seventh Son.
B00000G3I2|5.0|I've grown in and out and up and around the Big Chill over the last 20 years, but I get a craving to watch it every so often.

B000063V8U|2.0|Wesley Crusher was the best character on any Star Trek series. Since his departure TNG hasnt been the same. He was the ultimate SciFi hero.
B000068IEU|2.0|Wes Craven's uber-low-budget freshman cinematic outing \\"Last House on the Left\\" leaves me as puzzled as his second, ever so-slightly more effective take on brutality \\"The Hills Have Eyes\\", chiefly because I just don't understand why these two laughably awful clunkers are considered so influential to modern horror movies.<br />That said, it's useful to compare \\"Last House\\" with \\"Hills\\", since both films have a lot in common: 1) Both are astonishly low-budget---this is movie-making on the cheap, folks, not so much Low Budget as \\"We made this film for the price of a subway token and a Big Mac\\" filmmaking; 2) Both feature what are supposed to be horrific and harrowing collisions between All-American Innocence and evil, subhuman savages; 3) Both of these early Craven outtings really, really try to be shocking; 4) Both movies are abysmal and deliver absolutely zero scares. Just as there are a few celebrities floating around who are famous for being famous, \\"Last House\\" and \\"Hills\\" are movies that are shocking for the sake of being shocking.<br />Sadly, \\"Last House on the Left\\" isn't that shocking at all. It's crudely made, most of the acting is atrocious (particularly the avenging parents and the bumptious police), and scenes of true horror are constantly undercut by comedic sequences which serve absolutely no purpose other than to ruin the film's atmosphere of unease. Why have a pair of Laurel & Hardy-esque style sheriffs in what is supposedly a film of uncompromising savagery? And why, Wes Craven, tell me why would you include the toe-tapping musical number \\"Sadie and Krug\\", meant to be a ballad to the film's two psychos and set to the accompaniment of kazoos?<br />Yes, the film features a musical number with kazoos. \\"It's only a Movie\\"? Let's hope so. With that in mind:<br />THE BASICS: Two wholesome, all-American girls go on a fun-filled trip to the Big Apple to score pot and attend a \\"Bloodlust\\" concert. They are picked up by a motley crew of criminals led by a ravening psycopath named \\"Krug\\" (shades of Freddy Krueger, anyone?) and get more bloodlust than they bargained for. Their killers subsequently seek refuge for the night in the home of the parents of one of their victims.<br />THE GOOD: David Hess, who plays the surly, snarling, cold-blooded killer Krug, is actually creepily charismatic and does a good job as a Manson-esque psycho. Hess also penned the haunting ditty \\"The Road goes on to Nowhere\\" and the rest of the film's soundtrack, though if he's responsible for the kazoo number he should do hard time.<br />The three other psychos that make up Krug's merry men are also competent. Jeramie Rain does an itchingly nasty job as Krug's gun moll Sadie, serving up a convincing performance that is a little too chillingly close to Charles Manson's adoring female 'Family' members. Marc Sheffler plays Krug's slightly less repulsive younger brother Junior, and manages to convey his wormish, torn character's drug dependency and weakness.<br />Fred Lincoln also does a nice turn as Fred \\"Weasel\\" Podowski, who's just there for the ride but is as happy as Krug when the claret begins to flow. Incidentally, Mr. Lincoln evidently found his metier later in the Porn industry, starring in such family fare as \\"Devil in Miss Jones Part II\\" and directing charmers like \\"Heidi Does Hollywood\\" and \\"Anal Intruder 10\\" (I'm not kidding: check out Lincoln's bio on IMDB if you don't believe me).<br />Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham are, I think, quite convincing as the two teenage girls in peril, and the scenes of their rape, torture, and subsequent murder at the hands of Krug's thugs are unpleasant and shot with an unflinching camera. Doubtless this would be rough, grueling stuff, if not for....<br />THE BAD: The young Wes Craven really, really wanted to shock his audience, but unfortunately there's no suspense here, no shock, no horror, nothing remotely scary. You have a lot of sloppy editing, and the sequence in which Cassel and Grantham are torturedand murdered, though harrowing, is undercut by the brutish, forced comic scenes with the blundering deputies.<br />And what's with the ornate American Gothic house featured in the creepy cover art? Nothing remotely like that appears in the film; what you get here is a typical 1970's ranch house that appears to have been decorated, from a K-Mart, a few minutes before shooting started.<br />THE UGLY: Gaylord St. James and Cynthia Carr as the avenging parents are unremittingly awful and completely ruin whatever tension and suspense the movie might have delivered. And Marshall Anker and Martin Cove as the blundering policemen are mind-blastingly horrible. There's a sequence where the Sheriff and his deputy, their car having broken down, try to get a ride in a chicken truck. Why were these scenes included at all?<br />Finally, you also get a kazoo sing-along, which in its own fashion is pretty terrifying, though not in the way Craven intended.<br />THE VERDICT: Abominably bad, not shocking, and somewhat repulsive. If you want to be shocked, you'll find more shocking stuff in 30 seconds of \\"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\\" than you will in this atrociously bad film; come to think of it, you'll find more terror in 5 minutes of any of the \\"Friday the 13th\\" movies than you will in all of \\"Last House.\\"<br />If you're a Wes Craven completist or have a few hours to waste on a morbid curiosity, then you may want to check it out. Otherwise, you'll not have missed anything if you avoid this monstrosity.rtured and murdered, though harrowing, is undercut by the brutish, forced comic scenes with the blundering deputies. <br />And what's with the ornate American Gothic house featured in the creepy cover art?

0385504209|4.0|Overall, I enjoyed this book but I was uncomfortable reading it when it became particularly critical and dismissive of Christian beliefs. I think the author could have accomplished the same goal of creating a compelling &quot;villain&quot; if he had just focused on the extreme forms of Christianity, such as Opus Dei, without so contemptuously dismissing most fundamental Christian beliefs (especially in the character of Teabing). Aside from that rather large problem I had with the book, I have to admit I kept wanting to know what happened next.
B00005JLYW|1.0|god, this HAS to be one of the worst movies i have ever seen in my whole life. highly stupid. drew barrymore and lucy liu are some of my favorite actresses, but cameron diaz gets all the screen time. she's a horrible actress and she continues to do idiotic movies. good job cameron.<BR>this movie had almost no plot, and it wasn't very carried and supported throughout the movie. the dialogue was boring and dull.

0385504209|3.0|I thought this book was quite a page-turner and I enjoyed the religious conspiracy premise, but there were some annoying flaws that downgraded my rating.<br />Cryptologist Neveu is referred to as &quot;Sophie&quot; throughout the book while all the male characters are referred to by their more professional last names only. After all the talk about revering the sacred feminine! (probably mentioned before but I can't read all 900 reviews)<br />#2, the blindness these educated characters displayed when confronted with a simple mirror-writing clue was utterly ridiculous!<br />I thought the writing was average quick-mystery turnout quality with more in the way of plot, but again, it was a &quot;fun&quot; book to read for those of us who weren't already up on all the conspiracy points. Go ahead and read it! It won't be the best book you ever read but you'll enjoy it and be able to get in on all the buzz.
B000002B7U|4.0|It's 1986, Motley Crue and Poison are huge...where does Ozzy Osbourne belong ? A question I'm sure he asked himself a hundred times. Well, he just does what he knows how. Writes, sings, and performs and continues to draw the masses. Although not a classic in the aspects of Blizzard Of Ozz or Diary Of A Madman, it holds it's own. Spawning a hit single and video for the song, Shot In The Dark, Ozzy seemed bigger than ever, and he was. Ozzy embarked on a sold out world tour with a little band called Metallica, and even reunited with old Sabbath mates later that year to play a few classics at a little gathering called the Live Aids festival. It was short lived but a memorable event for anyone in attendance. Now that we know a little bit of Ozzy's situation surrounding the release of this album, lets get to the review.<br />- The Ultimate Sin (8.5/10)<br />Strong opener, nice lead in, great lyrics.<br />- Secret Loser (10/10)<br />One of my favorite Ozzy songs. Excellent riff, self-parody lyrics, typical of the Ozzy style. &quot;Although it appears to me that, the lose is king. Loser, I'm A Secret Loser.&quot; Great stuff. <br />- Never Know Why (7/10)<br />A big smack in the face to all the &quot;Nay-Sayers&quot; throughout Ozzy's career. You'll never understand him.<br />- Thank God For The Bomb (6/10)<br />A generic rocker going back to Ozzy's obsession with war.<br />- Never (8/10)<br />Powerful opening, a true-headbanger. <br />- Lightning Strikes (7/10)<br />One of the greatest riffs in Ozzy history torn down by bad lyrical content.<br />- Killer Of Giants (10/10)<br />A warning of war. Excellent lyrics with a great message.<br />- Fool Like You (8/10)<br />Another headbanger. <br />- Shot In The Dark (10/10)<br />The song that introduced Ozzy to so many people. Great riff, excellent melody, and a powerful vocal delivery by Ozzy. <br />As a whole I give The Ultimate Sin an 8/10. This album is not for the casual fan, but an essential piece in any Ozzy collection.
0316666343|5.0|Perceptive and haunting novel, narrated from the omnipotent vantage point of Heaven.  Thought-provoking and appropriate for a wide range of ages, since it can be interpreted on many different levels.  This story warrants a reread, because the nuances are more apparent the second time around. <BR>Stretches the readers' imagination  to the limits. Would adapt well to a screenplay.   <BR>Arlene Millman<BR>author of BOOMERANG - A MIRACLE TRILOGY
1559409002|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase this film, since I have seen so many flawed, tainted versions of it and been enthralled by the content and yet disappointed by the quality of the presentation.  In the end, I found myself trusting the reputation of the Criterion Collection and purchased \\"Carnival Of Souls\\", finding it to be one of the finest DVDs I have ever purchased.  The price of this DVD is worthy of the film, looking spectacular, crisp, clear, and utterly haunting.  I wonder now how Herk Harvey (Director) didn't end up changing the film industry by his methods of film-making.  This Criterion Collection version of \\"Carnival Of Souls\\" is well worth the price.  I can't wait to view it once more!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|hmmmm.....i just need to clarify to people that don't seenm to understand....Tool and APC are uhhhh....2 different bands with 2 totally different agendas....but it seems even with 2 cd's out...people are still making those comparisons.....i only laugh at them...seeing how pointless it is to try and rid the world of monotony...but yet to the faceless being reading this....ignoring what he doesn't understand.....he's gonna buy the cd because....Maynard is the singer and He's also the singer of tool....let alone....Billy Howerdel is one of the best atmospheric Guitarists that has ever graced our planet....and Of Course Jeordie....who just always amazes me with his melodies on bass.....but do people realize this......of course not....it's maynard.....he's the band.....he's the one who created A Perfect Circle....it'<BR>s a Tool Side Project.....We Live Like Penguins in the Desert
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Hello all,<br />I bought this cd the day it came with great expectations.  I have been a Tool fan for nearly ten years and when APC came along I was quite excited to see what else Maynard had to offer.  The Thirteenth Step is an emotional roller coaster that takes you on a journey through some intense hard driven beats mixed with melodic choir harmonies.  It took me 3 days to actually hear the songs playing in my head when I wasn't listening to it.  That's when it got really intense.  I love this cd.  It's so completely different then Mer de Noms but all the better for it.  <br />I am extremely impressed considering a lot of the band members have changed.  They were able to maintain a consistent vision that takes you on a journey.  God I love music like this. It makes my heart sing and goose bumps run down my spine.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is simply the Best Sci-Fi TV Series EVER! Don't know why FOX cancelled it. But what can you expect from FOX :(<br />It is funny, well scrpted, well acted, well filmed. The character are complex and interesting, Unlike the one-dimensional automatons that you see on most TV shows. The original stories are different and interesting. I can't wait to get it on DVD. May be if it sells well on DVD, something like this will be made again in the future.
0375422307|4.0|Marjane Satrapi chooses an original format for describing the Islamic Revolution and one child's place in it. Satrapi grew up in 1970s Iran with two outspoken parents who encouraged her to express her views. Coming of age into a country in tumult, she discovers that expressing her views might not always be welcome or safe. Truly funny moments, including Satrapi's dad smuggling contraband rock music posters under his coat, bump up against moments of horrifying brutality and upheaval. Will Marjane &quot;bow her head and let the wave pass&quot; or will she stand up against oppression?<br />I started this book knowing very little about Iran and its people. Not only did I get to know a brave and intelligent young woman, I also learned a lot about a country's role in modern history.
B00008PW2E|5.0|release it for the world to see.  what are you afraid of?  making some money??
B00008RH3L|2.0|This film is cleaver, the slow burn hammett style dialogue must have elicited a few sleepless nights stooped over the type writer (with the obligatory smouldering cigar poking its rear over the rim of an ashtray etc etc.) and the neo noir photography is 'gorgeous', with the 'honour amongst thieves' (and bookies and murderers and double crossers and confidence tricksters...) fallacy dispelled quite nicely. <br />Typing that dubious (and requisite) kudo required as much grating of my teeth. <br />The film is, as far as I'm concerned, willfully off-putting, self satisfied, pretentious..... The actors do their best, although they seem to have a real sense of reverence ('this is a smart movie') writ large upon their faces in every scene that requires them to spout forth the mucho stilted dialogue of which this movie is mostly composed. They shuffle through the film, strike poses (stunningly and ambiguously lit, of course) and spout forth the most ridiculous dialogue I've heard in years, as though they're somnambulist automatons plugged into the 'seedy-but-glistening-detective yarn' mainframe (there are a few silly visual tricks courtesy of the director of the \\"Men in Black\\" I and II, as is evident when Johnny Caspar confronts and executes \\"the Dane\\" figure). I realise that this is part of the films project, a revisionist potboiler, a left of centre treatise on human nature and the darkness within everyone including our (despondent, scheming but laconically smart) protagonist and what not. I don't care. How very pompous. The tranquil (read: composer on ritalin alert) title theme sets up the stolid, staid tone for the film within the first two or three minutes. The Coens again feel it fit to test out patience with their detached (and mypoic) view of human beings and their intrinsic pitfalls, it is almost as if in their quest not to pander to the audience and create some thoughtful Hollywood product, they forgot to add the most important ingredient (think of it in terms ofbaking powder in a cake mix); 'an iota of humanity'(understand that in whatever sense you will). I understand that the figures in this film are not meant to represent real people, they are ideal types to be found in pulp novels and films (I am sure there is a a veritable reference book of homages in this). That is not what I mean when I type 'iota of humanity'. I am against the pantomime nature of the references to be found in this and so many other nineties films. <br />My point is that the Coens are cold technicians, manipulators of quasi-intellectualisms, precocious NYU graduates with a severe carrot up their collective asses. I have not enjoyed a single component of their misbegotten ouvre. I thought (based on the consistent praise this film elicits even from those who don't generally like the Coens' work) that this one would be different. It wasn't. When all's said, neo-noir is a big fat cliche these days anyway. I don't buy any of it (although I enjoyed 'The Grifters a lot more than this tripe).
B00000B9BD|5.0|If there is a genre of music known as cosmic folk, then this album by the Strawbs is that which all else of this ilk revolves around.  Grave New World represents the folk-rock movement (pioneered by other bands such as Fairport Convention, Magna Carta and early Renaissance) taken to its logical limit.  In the end the Grave New World album incorporates just about every style from the eastern sitar-flavored &quot;Is It Today, Lord?&quot; to the heavy, melotron progressiveness of rock songs of &quot;Tomorrow&quot; and the title track.  In between are some other wonderful songs.  &quot;Queen of Dreams&quot; waxes some light psychedelia with its backwards organ; &quot;Heavy Disguise&quot; and &quot;The Flower and the Young Man&quot; recall some of the Strawbs earlier folkier moments of the first two albums; my personal favorite is &quot;On Growing Older&quot;--a great song about that stage of your life when one half of you is straddling the youth you're trying to hang onto and the other half is shying away from midlife.  The album ends with the gorgeous &quot;The Journey's End&quot;.  As concepts go, Grave New World is straightforward and simple.  Where the Moody Blues charted the passing of a day in their landmark Days of Future Passed album, and Magna Carta charted the course of a year on their sophmore album, Seasons, the Strawbs have charted the course of a man's life.  The bonus tracks, almost straight-ahead rockers, do not necessarilly compliment the overall theme of the album, but are nice insights into the full creative processes that were at work at that time.  Buy  this album.  You will wonder what took you so long to get turned onto these guys after you listen to it!
B00005JLTR|5.0|I loved this movie! I watched it as a child, and watched it again recently as an adult. I've asked my family for it as a gift for Christmas (hopefully it will be out in DVD by then but I will wait.) It's a beautiful love story of a destructive man and a caring woman. It's very moving, passionate. I'm not particularily a big fan of Babs or Kris but when they are together in this movie, it's incredible. I've cried everytime I've watched it.
0517201658|3.0|This novel is, in a word, mystifying. Mc'Cullough's style is, at some times, brilliantly poetic and beautiful, and at many others, extremely tedious. Her almost exclussive focus on Meggie and Ralph was annoying, and extremely one-sided; even though they are the main characters, it would have been refreshing to hear from the minds, as well as the lips, of people such as Paddy, Frank, and Dane, much more often than was the case. And speaking of Frank, as one can probably tell from the title of this review, he was my favorite character; I could relate to him most of all, despite never having been in prison. Did anyone else feel the urge to hold and comfort him as much as I did? My high level of empathy for him stems from the fact that he is, unlike so many males in contemporary literature, truly sensitive, compassionate, and idealistic, beyond the pursuit of monitary success (see Luke O'Niel for a portrayal of the power and money-obssessed egotist archetype). I thought the most romantic and touching sceens in the book were not between Meggie and Ralph (at least, not as older adults), but between the young Meggie and Frank, her misunderstood, despised, beautiful older brother. In contrast to Frank's, and Meggie's (as a child) softness, Justine, whose childhood was neglected so much that her decisions in later life seem to have no basis or logic to them, seemed overly heartless, impulsive, and, in spite of appearances, extremely insecure. Justine was so ascerbic and emotionally afraid that she was almost a characiture of the self-absorbed, overly dramatic, restless modern teenager struggling to break loose from tradition. Meggie, who I could relate to in early life, until she began her relationship with Luke, seemed more believable, in most situations, than many feminine characters in today's literature. Unlike them, she was not always stowical in the face of adversity, which reveals a true emotional center and capacity for great depth of feeling. Ralph had this as well,in spite of his ambition, and deference to the church's regulations; the reader has to keep in mind the time period and atmosphere of the culture in which Mc'Cullough's characters are placed. It was a stifling, rule-bound society. As for my point about the author being tedious, her inclusion of conversations between Ralph and his superiors, especially Cardinal Vitorio and Mary Carson, seemed more fitting for a political thriller and a true romance novel, respectively. Perhaps it is because in only a recent high school graduate who had the audacity to read this seven-hundred pager in four days because I just had to finish it, but I could not understand the intended humor or subtleties in their dialogues. Also, I disliked the subtle, but clear implication and portrayal of Maori people in the book. An Australian friend told me about the stereotype of Maori men as violent, uncontrollable miscreants, and after reading the description of Frank's eventual personality, and the diagnosis by friends of the family, I resent Mc'Cullough's idea on tne subject, considering Frank's first introduction as a compassionate, caring young man. (This, of course, could simply be my psychology classes working over time, and I could be overanalyzing Frank's character, and defaming Mc'Cullough needlessly), and it seems to me like a case of sensitive young man is mistreated horribly by society, and crushed by their insensitivity to his condition. In any case, Frank is still, to me, the little boy who needs protection and nurture, not to mension understanding and a realistic way to externalize his rage and other strong emotions. On the up side, though, Mc'Cullough has a definite talent for descriptions of the Australian landscape, as well as, when aplicable, the motives and exact nature of her characters's emotions. And, just to end on emotion, Fionna's relationship to Paddy, and all the other characters was never fully realized, and Stewart's contemplative tendencies never explained, and I would have loved to know more of Fi's life with Pakeha, what attracted her to him, etc. And, as I said, more Frank and young Meggie, and descriptions of their life in New Zealand in general would always have been appreciated!
B000000W5L|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all-time! It's got blues, gospel, country and rock'n'roll in one terrific punch! I cannot imagine never having hearing this music in my life, it is truly classic...my fave is the song about Angela Davis &quot;Sweet Black Angel&quot;...The song as well as the band was ahead of it's time...to be singing about a black woman...you all get my drift...get the album, cd, whatever, get an education...That's what this music does....
B00000J6AG|5.0|What an album! - Amicable and brilliant. This album reminds me of a four-wheel drive SUV bought at a rock-bottom price. This album can please anyone, of any music taste. When \\"PLAY\\" was released, MOBY was kind of an underground artist / producer. His earlier albums like \\"ANIMAL RIGHTS\\" enjoyed very little popularity and success. Even \\"PLAY\\" was a sluggish starter. It had its own unique sound: disco (nothing extravagant) songs, with sampled vocals from songs of antediluvian age. In a way, \\"PLAY\\" was meant to be an `underground' album.<br />Well, \\"PLAY\\" ultimately turned out to be one of the hottest dance albums of the last decade. How then could a supposedly offbeat album become such a humongous success? The answer is its universally appealing sound. The music is so uncomplicated and unpretentious that you fall in love with it, the very first time you listen to it. Dance music has never been so simple and humble. It seems as if techno has finally found an answer to Bob Dylan. <br />None of the eighteen tracks on \\"PLAY\\" extend beyond the four-and-a-half minutes length - the length of a standard `single' song. Though MOBY has experimented, as far as the inclusion of  `retro' sound-bytes in some of the songs of the album is concerned, he hasn't gone overboard with the experimentation-bit, as far as the musical complexity of the album goes - simple, but richly melodious tunes, is the formula behind every song on \\"PLAY\\".<br />\\"PLAY\\" is an album, which can be listened to, whilst one is going on a long drive. It also fits snugly under the rubric of those albums, which are supposed to be taken seriously. Also, it is a fantastic party-album. In addition, its songs enhance the appeal of a good visual - as is evident by the fact that almost all the songs on \\"PLAY\\" have found themselves as background scores for a good number of commercials. Adding to all this, the well-written essays included in the CD booklet, written by MOBY himself, and the enlightening quotes of famous people, also included along with the essays, come as perquisites to the quality numbers in this album. Considering its well-mannered nature, \\"PLAY\\" is a `concept' album's greatest nemesis. With a mixture of style, substance and versatile appeal, and of course the interesting reading material on the CD booklet, \\"PLAY\\" is indeed a four-wheel drive SUV, as far as music is concerned.
B00005JKZV|5.0|Tolkien's saga comes to life with an array of wonderfully talented scenery, dialogue, directing, and acting. Make-up and costumes are splendid, and the set is incredible. <br />Filmed in New Zealand, Peter Jackson, director of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, along with Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, and Ian Mckellen, to name a few, puts together another masterpiece. Though the first was remarkable, The Two Towers captivates the audience in a way that the Fellowship of the Ring cannot. <br />Split from their friends, Frodo and Sam set out on their own to destroy the ring. Frodo is beginning to feel the power of the ring, he is starting to realize that he cannot make the journey. It is too hard on him and he doesnt know the way. Just when things are getting hard on the two Hobbits, someone unexpected and unwelcome shows up. Gollum. Making a deal with the poor creature, Frodo and Sam follow Gollum to the Gates of Mordor, determined to get inside. <BR>Merry and Pippin are in the hands of the Orcs, being carried to Saruman, who is slowly taking over Rohan for his own evil bidding. <BR>Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are in search of Merry and Pippin, ready to free them from their captors at the slightest chance they get. And on the way they meet someone they do not expect. <br />An enjoyable film, the Two Towers goes beyond expectations into a movie that everyone will enjoy. Fun for mature children and their parents, a great film!!!
B000001Y2U|5.0|Im sure about 3/4 of these reviews are going to have the same beginning as mine but oh well. This is the BEST cd that Manson has come out with. I don't have Golden Age of Grosteque yet but as it stands Antichrist Superstar is the heaviest and the best cd thats come from Manson yet.<BR>My alltime favorite song on the albuim is The Minute of Decay. I love the slow melody of the song and I love how Manson begins singing in a very low singing voice and just about the middle of the song he goes into his yelling frenzy which I absolutly love.<BR>My other favorite songs are The beautiful people, dried up tied up and dead to the world, tourniquet, and deformography. Just because I didn't name evry song on the cd doesn't mean I don't listen to them. The songs I listed are the songs that I listen to the most on the cd.<br />I feel that Manson has fought real hard to gain the popularity and stardom that he has and that he deserves every minute of his fame. When Columbine occured Manson did kind of go into hiding which I think wasn't right because he got ALOT of negative publicity over that. I do have alot of respect for what Manson did say in a Rollingstone interview after Columbine.<br />Anyways, all I really have to say is that if anyone is thinking of becoming a Marilyn Manson fan I have three words for you..... Go for it. I would highly reccomend this cd to anyone who doens't have it. I've had to replace my Antichrist superstar cd 4 times because I listen to it so much so that should tell you something there.<br />To end this review I just want to say that Marilyn Manson is 1 of the best if not the best musician of the decade and probably the century. Honestly I think also all the contreversy surronding Manson is what gives him the fuel to be the best of the best.<br />Buy this cd right away if you don't own it yet. You WON'T regret it
B0000AXE8I|4.0|The Matrix is back, with a new thriller packed with action and surprise. The Matrix movie has many of the same characters we recognize. The plot is thicker, more intense, and a little more confusing. <br />Acting performances are great, as are the fight scenes and ideas of the directors. Neo now has to face his destiny, and learn more about the matrix then he has ever known. <br />The audience is thrown back into this thriller, wondering what is going to happen next, in awe at the special scenes of the movie, and in awe of the special effects. <br />There were some scenes that were a little too long. A scene where Neo and Trinity prove their love to each other takes too long, and is one you do not want your children to see. The fight scenes were a little drawn out as well. <br />Overall, this was a wonderful sequel to the original Matrix. It leaves you in wonder about the next movie. <br />The Matrix Reloaded portrays what every action movie buff wants to see: a movie loaded with action packed adventure.
B000002V0Q|5.0|Yes, I am a big fan of both Peace Sells and Rust in Peace, but this was Megadeths best in my opinion. <BR>It is perhaps a more commercial album compared to earlier releases , but it still has everything you love about megadeth.<BR>If you are a fan and dont have this album - you must buy it. On the other hand if you are wanting to get into the band, this is a good place to start.<BR>Great metal album.
B00000K19E|5.0|Matrix is a wonderfully built movie that makes the audience think and expand their thoughts on normal everyday life. It delivers a fine performance with Keanu Reeves as the star Neo, who may be humanity's last hope. The film has suspense, action, special effects beyond anything you've ever seen before, and even humor. The plot twists and turns, but the viewer is able to catch up if they get lost.<br />Such a creative film is a very impressive piece of cinematography. Never has the audience seen such an array of mind blowing special effects and such an intriguing plot.<br />The Matrix movie is about the world as we think we know it...but in fact we are all, all of us humans, being used as slaves for the machines that have taken over our world. Neo is trying to figure this out, and then he is told the truth. The world we think we are living in, is actually a wreck. We are living in a sort of dreamworld.<br />The movie is complex. It has bizarre ideas on things we wonder about everyday: even deja vu.<br />The Matrix is a compelling, wonderful movie that you will enjoy as well as think about for days after. It is rated R for a lot of violence, but teens should be allowed to see it. Enjoy!
B000051YEG|5.0|I don't speak or understand the French language, I stopped drinking alcohol 20 years ago and don't approve of smoking BUT Serge Gainsbourg (almost as famous for his boozing and smoking as his music) is one of my great heroes. I love his music so much I got a tattoo of his face on my arm ...and for me Histoire de Melody Nelson is his finest 28 minutes. It's mystical, sexy, seductive, dirty and even a bit vulgar. A concept album about doomed love for an English teenage girl, played by his greatest muse and partner Jane Birkin on the record and the glorious record cover. Birkin stands teasing in just blue jeans clutching a cuddly monkey to her [chest]. Jane told me that she placed this monkey in Gainsbourg's coffin with him when he died. The beautiful iconic cover would be worth the price of admission alone but the music is even more mesmerising. During the 60s and still in in 1971 when this album was originally released most people were content to make variations on a theme created by The Beatles, Bob Dylan and Brian Wilson... but what Serge offered, his brand of pop, had a completely different and individual voice. The gophic bookend tracks of the album Melody and Cargo Culte sound extraordinarily modern even today. There is great tenderness and melancholy in Ballade de Melody Nelson and Ah! Melody. Witness the sound of Jane Birkin laughing hysterically over the grooviest of 70s psych-grooves on En Melody. Birkin was actually being tickled by her brother Andrew while Serge had a tape running on record under her bed. Don't be put off by the short running time, length doesn't matter, it's what you do with it that counts.<BR>Histoire de Melody Nelson is ultra cool, ultra sexy and ultra modern music. <BR>Je T'aime, Gainsbourg.
0156027321|4.0|Way back in '77, when I was in secondary school, I had to study a book called Lord of the Flies. Who didn't! William Golding's classic tale about a group of English schoolboys who are plane-wrecked on a deserted island left a lasting impression. Unfortunately, so did the over analysis by my zealot school teacher.<br />I predict that this Man Booker Prize winner, Life of Pi, will have future students suffering a similar fate.<br />Perhaps that was Yann Martel's intent.<br />At one point, Martel has his main character, Pi recount, &quot;My greatest wish--other than salvation--was to have a book. A long book with a never-ending story. One that I could read again and again, with new eyes and fresh understanding each time.&quot; Pg 230<br />Perhaps it is no coincidence then that there are similarities to Golding's gripping story as well.<br />A young boy is shipwrecked and must survive on a small lifeboat drifting in the middle of the desert-like Pacific Ocean. Like Golding, Martel explores the boundary between human reason and animal instinct, in this case, on the ocean's brutal playing field.<br />And just like Lord of the Flies, Life of Pi has parts that are so moving, so exhilarating, so extraordinary that readers must catch their breath before bravely pressing on.<br />Martel cooked up one hell of a good story, but I'll bet students don't want to know if Pi's journey is carefully constructed representations of Sigmund Freud's Id, Ego and Superego. I know I didn't.
6305535264|1.0|This movie had all the appeal of watching my dog pinch a loaf on my lawn, actually that is more entertaining. The high point in the film was the actual construction of the robot, everything before and after was a total waste of money and time. What were Kirk Douglas and Farrah Fawcett getting paid to do other than taking showers and rolling around naked with each other? Surely they were there for a reason but what, they never did any work at all and as far as the special effects I've seen better shadow puppets for an eclipse than the one in this film. Harvey Keitel was a very convincing horn ball that's about it; I think his mission was to get laid by Farrah. The absolute worst was Hector falling into the acid and coming out with what looked like dried Crisco stalactites shouldn't all of his plastic tubing have instantly melted? Anyway I think I'll go watch Cabin Boy now since it now looks like Casablanca compared to this.
B00006BXI0|1.0|After sampling some of the tracks it became obvious that this is just hard rock and does not even come close in style to groups such as; Camel, Yes, Steve Hackett, Peter Gabriel, or even Dave Mathews.  It is most definately not progressive rock.
B00007JVBI|4.0|This is a beautiful album, which shows that when it comes to music, sometimes less is more. Most of the songs are built around simple acoustic guitar strumming, rudimentary piano chords, and Chan Marshall's raw, intimate vocals. The result is emotional, evocative, and personal. Some standout tracks include \\"Good Woman\\" (which features intriguing uncredited backing vocals by Eddie Vedder), \\"Werewolf\\", a haunting tune enhanced by a well-placed cello, and the mournful \\"Names\\", which tells the stories of a handful of abused or neglected children Chan has known in her life.
B000060OFT|5.0|this movie (romeo &amp; juliet- 1996 version) is the best movie ever made. It is one of my favorites along with good will hunting, and others. I watched this movie 6 times in a row one day, and i must say, being an actress, the acting and the movie itself is just AMAZING.
0792844890|5.0|A parity of Star Wars, this is one of the funniest movies ever.  This is a hugh family favorite.  Can I say it is Brooks masterpiece?  Well there is that other movie he made called Robin Hood Men in Tights.  But Spaceballs is definitely one of his two best.  There are so many memorable lines and for a guy who is a Star Wars nut anyway... lots of inside jokes as well.  The characters include Barf, who is a Mog, half man, half dog... he is his own best friend.  LoneStar is the hero who uses the power of the Schwartz to defeat Dark Helmet.
B00005JLSE|1.0|Although I enjoyed the music in this film, that's about it. My biggest gripe is that there are no characters you can admire or even like in it. Roxie's husband is the only decent character, and he gets dumped on throughout the movie. The rest of the characters are sleazy, deceptive, awful people, and unfortunately that is celebrated throughout the film. Not surprising that the Hollywood cesspool went ga-ga over it. I was pleasantly surprised at Catherine Zeta-Jones and Rene Zellweger's singing and dancing ability, that much I will admit. However, I would recommend that you rent this movie before you buy it. I bought it before seeing it at the recommendation of a friend, and unfortunately wasted my money. It's not a movie I want to watch again.
0790729970|4.0|The movie had a dozen smiles and several laugh out loud moments and was enjoyable in every way.  My 9 year old son has been watching this so I decided that I better check it out.  I had always assumed I would not like it.   Wrong.  This movie is pure fun and has no nudity and I recall no foul language.  <br />The story is simple, loser finds mask and gains confidence and power.  Loses mask to the bad guy but keeps confidence and gets the girl.  No r2d2 in this one, but it does have a dog.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|thirteenth step. this cd is amazing. i would have to say this album is better than the first one by a longshot. every song moves you in a different form and no two song's share the same idea or poetic suggestion. all of the songs are beautiful in their own ways.<br />if you don't have this cd, you MUST buy it. this is for people who want meaningful and poetic music. a perfect circle's music has art, an element missing in much of today's music. if you already own this cd, then buy it for a neighbor, friend, or family member, they will not be disappointed.<br />my favorite songs on the cd are 'the package' 'weak and powerless' and 'pet', but you know what, i listen to the entire album through. if you listen to this album enough, the songs go together VERY VERY WELL in the order they were put. i have never seen music like a perfect circle. if you liked Mer de Noms, you will definetely like this album. buy this album.
B000069AUI|5.0|Though I first thought of buying this album last November after hearing the rhythmically astounding &quot;Clocks&quot;, it was in February that I bought this after first hearing the haunting piano ballad &quot;The Scientist&quot;. In an era were it seems that you either need to strip on tv or shoot someone to sell albums that contain brief moments of musical inspiration, this album is a breath of fresh air, and can be listened to straight through over and over again. From the pulsating beat of &quot;Politik&quot; to the acoustic simplicity of &quot;Green Eyes&quot; on to the thought provoking &quot;A Rush of Blood to the Head&quot;, this album is just pure genius. A must-have for anyone sick of the orgasmic screeching of Britney, Christina, etc. or the cookie-cutter rock music of everyone trying to be like Blink-182 or Green Day. Buy this album. You won't regret it.
0767830555|1.0|I must have missed something. With all the lovely words of the previous reviewers of this film, you would think that this is the film of the century. Sorry, but no, it's not. It's not even in the top 1,000. There was nothing about this film that should appeal to anyone looking for entertainment. The greatest emotion you'll realize while watching this film is shear boredom.<br />&quot;Taxi Driver&quot; changes gears so many times you really don't know where this film is heading. It makes so little sense and De Niro's performance is so uneven, you don't know if he's doing it on purpose or he's just a bad actor.<br />A good date film? No, it will kill the mood. A comedy? You may laugh once but probably unintentionally. An adventure? Only if you consider watching the trials and tribulations of a wacked out taxi driver adventurous. This film is all over the place and it never lets you get a grip on what the director is trying to tell you. Oh sure, now, they tell you that it's a genius of a film but while you're watching it you'll swear that the writer and director were using illicit substances while making this nonsense.<br />Anyone that can't write a screenplay at least as good as this in one day, simply isn't trying very hard. This movie is a tragic waste of time and your wife or girlfriend will leave the room while you sit there hoping it's going to get better. Well, guess what. It won't get better and you shouldn't even spend one second giving any thought to renting or buying this over-hyped, over-acted lobotomy of a film.
B000000I0G|5.0|after more sober and celtic influenced &quot;Qe2&quot; mike rearanged his style adding a lot of heavy guitars and hard drumming and returned with &quot;FIve Miles out&quot; - propably his best album from eigthies.<BR>the opening almost half hour long &quot;Taurus II&quot; is a suprising continuation of QE2 main long track.&quot;Taurus II&quot; starts with a heavy main guitar riff and eveloves suddenly into great progressive rock suite with celtic elements,disco beat and a lot of great drumming.it is one of the best Mike's moments in his whole career.<BR>&quot;Family man&quot; is a ironic fast catchy pop song (Maggie Reilly on vocals) that was a big hit across the europe - later covered by Hall and Oates synth pop duet.<BR>&quot;Orabidoo&quot; is another great hypnotic track with a transe drums and vocoder voice singing mysterious lyrics about flying over Katmandu.the coda with piano riff repeated by other instruments is one of the most moving and exciting melodies from his longer tracks.&quot;Orabidoo&quot; ends with irish song sung by Maggie.<BR>&quot;Mount teide&quot; is nice instrumental with lovely guitar solo.drums played by mr.Palmer from Emerson,lake and palmer band!!!<BR>finally the title song &quot;Five miles out&quot;.intriguing sytnh-pop hit.Maggie's sweet voice sings along with more agressive and angry Mike's singing (i always wondered why he is singing so rarely,he is a really good vocalist).title song is based on Taurus II guitar riff and features some amusing parts (Mike's growling voice - &quot;lost in static 18...&quot;) but also very pathetic and memorable chorus.one of my favourite songs.<BR>The album is one if his most extraordinary and interesting items from discography.Mike creates here really rich and colourfull paintings using a lot of instruments and of course his beloved electric guitar.an album which you can't leave behind!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A P E R F E C T C I R C L E 'S album Thirteenth Step is by far the best cd i own! i have never heard such sounds from any band, being a TOOL fan and everything like that i know what im talking about when it comes to a perfect circle, this band is different, they have created a new sound, a touch of rock with such stron lyrics, the cd is addicting and i never stop listening to it, i have to force myself away from it. Thirteenth Step is better than their first cd Mer De Nom, its not heavy, but its somthing that all rock fans will enjoy.
B000000H64|5.0|well when i bought this cd i didnt know too much about Fear Factory but i had heard some of their songs and decided to buy Demanufacture.At first i felt like i shouldnt have bought it but after a few more listens i loved the cd.I can honestly say this is one of the best metal albums ever.The songs are brutal and melodic at once.Burton C. Bell is a great vocalist.He can growl and yell,and he can sing melodically.This album blends Melodic Death Metal with industrial and it really works.Dino is a great guitar player and his riffs on this album are heavy as hell.some of the key tracks on this album are Demanufacture,its a nice brual song and a good way to start the album,Replica is another hard song with a great rhythm and even some melodic sections and vocals.Pisschrist is another hard song that also has some melodies.H-K hunter killer is another good one.A therapy For Pain is the slowest most melodic and moving sonf on the album.it has synthesizers and melodic vocals the whole way through...........But the very best song on the cd is Self Bias Resistor,it has it all melody,brutallity,heavy riffs,amazing double bass drumming(i cant forget to mention that Raymond Herrera is one of the best drummers i have ever heard,extemely fast it just dosent quit)in all i think that anyone who enjois great metal should buy this classic Fear Factory album and listen to it loud in a dark room with nothing to disturb their listening experiance.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|First of all, the script is abysmal. The freeway scene where Neo is separated from his friends is blatantly contrived. There could not be a freeway scene if Neo was with them with his superhuman powers. With his powers to fly, it would seem he could have dispatched those Hong Kong kung fu extras in seconds. Think about it. Stopping that many bullets in mid air would take how much force???  He should have the power of a mac truck at least. Then Trinity leaves on an offramp leaving Morpheus and Keymaker behind when the most helpful thing would be to help them out.<br />As everyone knows, Zion was a waste. What could have been interesting to learn how 30th century or so humans lived, clogged up with abysmal dialog and performances. People in my theater showing were leaving for the exits soon after the Zion scene. Looks like some moviegoers know how to cut their losses these days and leave early.<br />I gave it a chance but the action turned out to be nothing but video game demos. I'd rate this sequel even lower than Jurassic Park II: The Lost World, marginally better than Godzilla.<br />Star Wars fans disillusioned by how Lucas has trashed the good ol memories should accept that Lord of the Rings is the \\"supreme film adventure of our time\\"- Time. LOTR has it beat. You're not going to find redemption or a substitute in the Matrix sequels.

B00008HCCF|4.0|I purchased this DVD without ever having heard Norah Jones, or at least I thought I hadn't. After playing it, however, I did recognize two of her hits. I bought it because of the genre and because I was hoping she would be similar to Diana Krall, which is one of my favorites.<br />The two artists are similar in many respects, the most obvious being that they are both vocalists, pianists, and have a similar style. <br />I do like this DVD. Norah Jones is a great talent. But she's not yet up to par with Krall. Compared to Diana Krall's &quot;Live in Paris&quot; concert DVD, Jones's lacks polish and class. <br />Although her music is fine, the overal performance seems almost like a practice session. Primarily, her accompanyists are not nearly up to par with her singing ability. The drums sounded like a cheap toy set. And, compared to Krall's full orchestral accompaniment, Norah Jones's accompaniment was a tad sparse. <br />Krall's sleek black dress, suit-clad musicians, and polished style contrasts sharply to Jones's casual attire, garage-band musicians, and relaxed demeanor. Their respective pianos are metaphors for their shows. Both are Steinways, but Krall's is brilliantly polished and reflective while Jones's is dull.<br />Not having a large number of accompanying musicians, it is not surprising that the Norah Jones DVD's 5.1 surround sound does not have enough separation. It is basically in stereo, with the surround speakers being relegated to applause from the audience.<br />Still, Jones is an excellent pianist with a great Blues quality to her voice. I did enjoy the DVD as I'm sure all Norah Jones fans will. Though not as polished as Diana Krall, the concert was still entertaining.

0385504209|5.0|The last book that was intellectually challenging enough to keep me running to my computer or dictionary was Dennis Miller's &quot;The Rants.&quot;  That was nearly 5 years ago.  &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; aroused such curiosity in me, that I had to stop reading many times, to log on to the Internet for more fact finding.  One of the first pages of the book states that all architecture, religious rituals, and art referred to in this novel are factual.  This hooks me every time.<br />Dan Brown is a master of the intelligent novel.  I didn't feel as if I was wasting my time reading a mere murder mystery; I was learning something new with the turn of each page.  Yes, sometimes there were too many coincidences, and some of the dialogue was trite; these sins pale in light of his obvious knowledge of the subject at hand.  I can forgive most slights of plot and/or dialogue when the book's details are scathingly accurate, and well written.<br />I am not a radical feminist, yet I rather enjoyed the intimations in this book that the Catholic Church has been responsible for the opression of women. Since men were &quot;in charge,&quot; in the name of &quot;God,&quot; the Catholic Church has condoned, initiated, and funded the systematic elimination of women from many historical documents. Some documents have placed Mary Magdalene at the side of Jesus, during the last supper.  More secret documents charged that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were &quot;married&quot; and had children.<br />Oh, GASP! This discovery could discredit the very foundation upon which the Catholic Church has carefully built its wealthy empire! Its devout, fearful, tithing and obeisant legion of followers may have a change of heart!<br />Whatever you may infer from the research and facts given in &quot;The DaVinci Code,&quot; it stands alone as a stunningly well written novel, guaranteed to keep you up long past your bed time.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and bought two other Dan Brown books, based only on the quality of &quot;The DaVinci Code.&quot;only on the quality of &quot;The DaVinci Code.&quot;
0452282152|1.0|The somber reality of 17th century poverty is realized, almost like Dickens, but the protagonist and even her family is too sketchily drawn. Like the hands of impressionists, instead of a master who used camera obscura to truly &quot;see&quot; his subject.<BR>An aficionado of Vermeer will recoil at this book. The immature voice of the writer renders this portrayal of him, as in the horrible realm or romance novel lotharios, auster, emotionally blocked until they meet &quot;the one&quot; of their true desires, and overemotional (his temper is quite apparent to her, rather than intelligence).<BR>Fact of the matter: Vermeer didn't have a brood of children because he didn't want to bed his wife. The romance angle overshadowed what could have been an excellent challenge, since it is a novel, to engage in a pupil-teacher exchange between them, albeit subverted from view by it's &quot;taboo&quot; of the age (perhaps, but although it is touched on, it is the only portion of the story that excites the mind!). <br />Well, this poorly drawn Griet, who simply does not bare close scrutiny, turns this book into a teenage coming of age piece. Much is lost in this proposition of Vermeer's life.<BR>The wife, the daughters placards for any real work on the authors part. Shame! Two people stand out Maria Thins and her servant. <BR>Perhaps we can beg Ms Brookner to render the inner lives of lost historical figures. She, indeed, could do them justice, and with such subtle flavoring in her prose, it is rereadable, where this book by Ms Chevalier, is not. <BR>Once done, you push it's sorry image out of your head, and know that it is a failed attempt.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|There are a few good songs on this album, but I regret to say that I found the rest to be rubbish. I expected much from APC, especially after MDN which was a truly brilliant album but I felt let down after listening to 13th Step. The following is written to express my opinion only:<br />First and foremost I would like to say I believe most people have already generated an opinion before listening to the album; it must be great because the singer is Maynard, and it must be great because they made Mer De Noms. But there have been a few band changes since then and I have found the new album to be bland, repetitive and occasionally boring. The production seems rather narrow minded - make a soft, vocalists record. I often felt I'm listening to another version of the same song. You can almost tell that Maynard has had the lions share of the creative work on it because there is hardly much to look forward to musically, and musically it seems rather cumbersome and easy to swallow. The album tries very hard to be sombre, mellow, relaxed and insightful. But I think APC lost themselves during the creation process since there is a fine line between a mellow record and a boring record. <br />This cd has little musical value whatsoever with songs like vanishing, a stranger, crimes, the nurse who loved me, lullaby, and gravity. Two of the aboved named songs aren't even songs but fillers. On the other hand, the package, pet and the outsider are great songs. The noose, blue and  weak and powerless are good but nothing special. In fact they are almost mediocre. <br />Musically the whole album is basically made of long non-complicated seagues with nothing but Maynard filling empty space. I find it difficult to believe so many listeners are obligated into liking this simply because it's from APC. While the songs may have alot of meaning lyrically, I havent felt the slightest motivation to care about the lyrical content of them since most are barely worth listening to.<br />This is nota bad album in comparison to much of the garbage out on the airways, but I think APC has taken a step back from the quality of Mer De Noms. I've heard some say this is a leap forward from Mer De Noms, which was a 'commercial album'. I would really like to know why, because at least Mer De Noms was both creative and sounded great. In my opinion, a great album is one which is memorable and listenable at the same time. I find 13th step is neither, with the exception of a few songs. I would have liked to have seen a much more unconventional approach to the album musically, and perhaps more memorable singing verses, not the regurgitated whining that Maynard has showered us with over both Mer De Noms and Tool's later albums.<br />If you have to make a choice between purchasing the two albums, choose Mer De Noms. Or buy something or real quality, such as Opeth's Damnation. At least after about 20 listens, you will come away feeling emancipated instead of frustrated.
B000058T5E|5.0|What can I say about this album...IT ROCKS!Yeah,yeah,yeah,Clapton is god,please im so sick of hearing that!Joe Satrani who please 1000 notes a sec with no melody.Page who ripped off jeff becks sound in led zeppelin.JEFF BECK Rules.And this cd rocks.Nobody gets tones like mr elbecko.He is in his own class.I like 6 or 7 songs off this album and they are great.
B00005JKHN|5.0|I have always loved this movie, and having owned it on VHS, I am so pleased with the DVD version! It's crisper, the music is clearer, and the colors are brighter. My husband and I are expecting our first child, and I have been collecting all the Disney DVDs I can so that my child will be able to watch them longer--some of my VHS tapes are warped from hours of use. If you love Disney as much as I do, it is worth the money--plus, there is usually a $5.00 rebate for the DVD if you already own the VHS format.
B00003CXFV|4.0|Based on a true story, Erin Brockovich, a single mother of three takes on PG&amp;E to prove that they are poisoning the town's water supply.  She manages to get a job with a law firm run by Ed Masry (Albert Finney)just in time to break open the biggest direct action corporate lawsuit in american history.  After a lot of hard work, no family life, and insulting everyone in her path, she wins the victims $330 million dollars and herself a hefty two million dollar bonus.  The movie is not as much about the courtroom battle with PG&amp;E as it is with the battles that Erin was facing in everyday life, a single uneducated working class mother raising three kids on her own in a very uncooperative world.

B00005JKDR|3.0|In the world behind our closet doors, monsters like Mike (Billy Crystal) and Sulley (John Goodman) work hard for their income. The monster world depends on  children's screams.  Big companies like Monsters, Inc. collect the scream energy and use it to make lightbulbs glow and cars drive.  Since the kids are being desensitized, the monsters are having a hard time to scare the kids.  One day, Sulley accidentally lets a human child into the monster world.  Since kids are supposed to be poisonous and carry loads of diseases, pandemonium ensues. After Mike and Sulley discover that the girl they nicknamed Boo actually seems quite harmless, they decide to bring her back through her door into her room.  Now, Mike and Sulley have to face an enemy within their own ranks.
B00003CXD0|5.0|When I first saw this film more than 20 years, I really did not fully appreciate then what director Sydney Pollack, his cast, and his crew had achieved. To be sure, I found the humor hilarious, the cross-dressing and gender-bending clever, and all of the performances first-rate. I have the same opinion today. However, in ways and to an extent no previous film had done, Tootsie makes certain assertions which have serious implications, then and now. For example, that at least some men can more fully develop their masculinity by recognizing their femininity, as indeed Michael Dorsey/Dorothy Michaels (Dustin Hoffman) does. And the same is also true of at least some women. Moreover, this film effectively demonstrates how difficult it can often be to gain and then sustain another's complete trust. To salvage his acting career, Michael repositions himself as Dorothy so he will be hired to play a character in a soap opera. As Dorothy, he establishes an especially close relationship with another cast member, Julie (Jessica Lange), and falls in love with her while continuing to deceive her. Later, her widower father Les (Charles Durning) falls in love with Dorothy and thus becomes another unwitting victim of Michael's deceit. The eventual happy ending does not include Les.<br />Shakespeare never devised for his Italian comedies a plot as complicated as the one Larry Gelbart and Murray Schisgal provided for Tootsie. Under Pollack's direction, all of the cast members provide brilliant performances, notably Bill Murray as Michael's friend Jeff and George Gaynes as John Van Horn, another cast member. Jessica Lange was selected to receive an Academy Award as best actress and deserved it. Much of this film is hilarious, it is always entertaining, but as I indicated previously, having seen it again recently, I find it much bolder and more thought-provoking now than I did 21 years ago. To some, perhaps, its serious implications may even seem threatening.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|Personally the matrix reloaded was one of the best movies I've ever seen.  Of the five times I've seen it the fifth was probably my favorite(as this time I saw it in the IMAX theater).  Yes it had some downfalls but so what.  I wonder if any of the critics even took into consideration that the matrix reloaded was just to tease the real thing is the matrix revolutions. Let's face it the only reason movies are even made is purely for entertainment.  If everybody would take critics words and went by their taste in movies there would be no movie industry.
B00006ZCFH|4.0|Badu's Worldwide underground is worth buying. At times Badu lacks the true funk that makes her one of the few real R & B artist today. The lyrics are not that deep but she often makes up for it with tight grooves that emphasize the Base, Keyboards and precessions. I especially enjoy \\" I want You \\" with the exception of that strange ending of 2 minutes or so, \\"Bump it \\" and \\" Back in the day \\" These are not songs made for the pop charts but they separate the true soulful artist from the pretenders. Keep up the good work Badu.
B0000640VM|1.0|I happen to be a huge Disney fan but no one can deny the studio was at its all-time low (their only low, actually) during the 70's and most of the 80's. Of all the animated Disney features of that era, The Fox and the Hound is the only one worth mentioning. However, the worst one must be &quot;Oliver &amp; Company&quot; (equaled with The Aristocats). Poor quality animation, substandard songs and a weak plot make this among the worst Disney movies ever made. One cannot believe this is the same studio that only a year later brought the masterful The Little Mermaid with its stunningly detailed animation, lush colors and appealing music.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This new two disc set for the Lion King is yet another masterful DVD production job by the Disney folks. The video and audio quality are top notch, with plenty of choices how to see the film (both original and extended). There are an amazing amount of extras included on disc two, it will take some hunting to find them all, and quite a bit of extra time to view the entire contents. A few are overly self promotional, but there is so much stuff here, just skip to the next item if that bothers you. Some of the games are actually fun too.<br />With both Lion King and Sleeping Beauty being newly released on DVD right now, if you can only get one of them, there is no question this is by far the better choice. The impressive animation, the story, the fantastic sound, the extras are all superior in this Lion King package. This still isn't my favorite Disney release (Roger Rabbit will always have that honor), but maybe top 5--certainly top 8. <br />Lion King Platinum is well worth the investment for your DVD collection.

0385504209|5.0|This book kept me intrigued the whole way through. Just when you thought you had things figured out, Brown threw another curve ball your way. He also brilliantly straddled the line between fact and fiction, making the reader question whether his &quot;fictitious&quot; plot had any truth. This is the best book I've read all year, and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|one of my all time favorites!
B00009V7T2|5.0|I bought this in July and I still listen to it everyday!  It has been a long long time since a cd has made me this excited.  It also made me take a serious look over the rest of my music collection. There is just so much out there that doesn't live up to the production, energy, and musicianship on display here.
B00009P1O5|4.0|Man, &quot;t-bone&quot; sounds too much like some of the songs that the rock band I'm in makes.  That's not a bad thing, IMHO.  Ain't got no t-bone...got mashed potatoes... for nine freakin' minutes YEAH!! So it's just part of the creative process, mates.  Sometimes you suck and sometimes you rock.  As you make more music and reach into your soul, hopefully you suck less.  I think there might have been some alcohol influencing this collection.  Maybe not.  But then again, pass them mashed potatoes
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Though it contains a few songs that are mediocre at best, this is one of the most remarkable and affecting pieces of modern songwriting that I have ever heard.  &quot;The Noose&quot; and &quot;Vanishing&quot; would each be worth purchasing an album for, and a number of Thirteenth Step's other tracks also shine.  This is transformative music, and if you give it an opportunity, it will change you.
0694016756|5.0|Don't listen to the one- and two-star people!<br />\\"Goodnight Moon\\" is the quintessential bedtime book.  It is worded perfectly for a relaxed pace and soothing tone from the reader, as well as a nice poetic rhythm.  The little bunny in the story says goodnight to objects in the room as he goes to bed; you can continue from this book to say goodnight to objects in your child's own room.  As you read, watch the moon rise and the time change on the clocks, and remember to look around the room for the mouse!<br />I am perplexed by the reasons given by some reviewers as to why they don't like this book.  As for boredom, any adult can become bored with a children's book of this level when it's read over and over and over (and over), as children of this age require of you.  \\"Goodnight Moon\\" is not aimed at adults.  That obvious fact being said, I have *never* been bored with this long-memorized book in four years of reading it (over and over and over), because it is so well written.<br />One current reviewer claims there is no lyricism or poetry to the words, which left me agape -- anyone who can speak English decently well could feel the rhythm and lyricism in the text, and read it accordingly.  Was she reading a different book?<br />To the reviewer who noted the \\"tired catalogue of meaningless objects,\\" remember that small children need repetition to learn -- \\"Read it, Papa, read it (over and over and over)!\\" -- and no objects are meaningless to them.  They are curious about everything; it is we adults who often narrow our curiosity too much, teaching our children to do likewise.  And of course, the worth of artwork is always a matter of opinion -- he is obviously a \\"modern art\\" person from his other reviews, so he knows this very well.  I too like Jackson Pollock's work, but I also happen to like Clement Hurd's \\"shrilly colored, crudely drawn, flatly artless illustrations\\" in this book and would not describe them that way.  The colors are bright monochrome (a bit garish) and they contrast starkly; the drawings are simple and basic:  it's a valid style, and it draws the child's attention.  But anyway, his recommendation of D.B. Johnson's \\"Henry Builds a Cabin\\" is great; the book looks and sounds fantastic, so I'll order it.  I too look for children's books with an eye to the artistic quality of illustrations.<br />Our older daughter (4.5) loved this book from the age of 6 months or so, and the younger (20 mos.) has too, although she loves the author's \\"The Runaway Bunny\\" better.  We replaced tattered, well-loved paperbacks of both these books with the big lap edition board books which, though heavy, are great for the size of the illustrations and are virtually indestructible.  The baby carries the lighter, tattered copies hither and thither, though she will heft the big ones also.<br />\\"Goodnight Moon\\" is a wonderful book.

B00003CXC7|5.0|Hitchcock directed his movies so that the audience would see and feel exactly what the characters in the movie experienced.  Never was this done more obviously or more effectively than in Rear Window, the 1954 classic with Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly.  <br />Stewart is a magazine photographer who has suffered a broken leg.  He is forced to spend most of his day in a wheelchair, and his only entertainment is staring out the window of his Greenwich Village apartment.  Kelly is in love with him and wants to marry him.  He wants no part of that (for some reason) and is contemplating ending the relationship.<br />It is interesting that we learn a lot about six or seven of his neighbors just by watching with Stewart.  There's the songwriter, who goes from failure to success right before our eyes, and the newlywed couple, who move in at the beginning full of love and lust and end up at the end like a couple married for 20 years.  Miss Torso is his name for a shapely young woman with multiple suitors and he calls another Miss Lonelyhearts, who is desperate for companionship.<br />The most interesting neighbor is Raymond Burr.  He has an invalid wife who disappears suddenly.  Stewart sees suspicious things in the middle of the night and develops a theory that Burr has killed his wife and disposed of her.  At first no one believes him, but eventually they come along and spy with him, trying to figure out what happened.  Stewart has a detective friend who refuses to be convinced, but Stewart tries over and over to explain why he thinks the wife is dead.<br />Throughout the film, Hitchcock has us totally hooked.  We are right there with Stewart and we are totally enamored by Kelly, who may have one of the most sensual screen openings in film history.  Thelma Ritter is Stewart's housemaid, and she dispenses advice on relationships and how to handle this supposed murder.<br />In the end, we learn whether Stewart's suspicions have any merit.  I can say that there is lots of tension and suspense along the way.  It takes real guts to make a film like this, where you are limited to one section of a room for almost two hours.  Hitchcock's genius is clearly obvious here.  One of the master's five best films of all time.
0385504209|2.0|The best I can say for Dan Brown here is at that at least he cops to all the sources for his story (including not only the 1980's best seller &quot;Holy Blood, Holy Grail,&quot; but Brown's own prequel!).  The real problem with this book is that it's just badly written.<br />The plot itself is moderately entertaining, but Brown engages in the annoying habit of dancing around a topic for chapters and chapters to avoid telling the reader what the characters already know.  Brown repeatedly refers to what Sophie saw her grandfather doing that kept her from speaking to him for twenty years, but doesn't reveal it until near the end, so while it remains a mystery to us, it's hard for us to have any sympathy with Sophie's trauma and, after a while, we just don't care what she saw.  And having a &quot;cliffhanger&quot; every four pages just gets tiresome, as do the intellectual and artistic references that don't drive the plot, but seem to be there simply so that we can be impressed with the wealth of Dan Brown's knowledge.  Is it really descriptive to say that the evening made Langdon feel like he was in a Salvador Dali painting?  There are enough artistic and scientific references that fit in with the plot to make this uneccessary.  Finally, some of the plot points (which I won't spoil), are just too convenient, stuck in to make for a tidy wrap up of certain loose threads.<br />I was looking forward to a good yarn involving art, science and religion, but considering the lack of anything novel in the plot, it would have to be a lot better written to have held my attention.  The underlying concepts, e.g., the notion of the perfect number, the symbolism in ancient and renaissance art and architecture, etc., are really interesting and I wanted to read more about them.  The hokey plot and mediocre writing just kept interrupting all the good stuff.<br />A decent read on the topic if you don't want too much of a challenge, but if you're willing to work a little, Umberto Eco's &quot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; is a much more rewarding Knights Templar conspiracy romp.ot;Foucault's Pendulum&quot; is a much more rewarding Knights Templar conspiracy romp.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Erykah is back. That's it plain and simple. You can hear influences from other artists such as Outkast within this cd and it adds a great depth that Mama's Gun, in my opinion lacked after Baduizm. Ms. Badu experiments a lot with some new and different sounds to create something unlike anything she has ever done before and also unlike what many people in the music industry are doing. Bump It ends with an awesome scat ending that's been all tripped out. The production on this cd absolutely shimmers with brilliance. Also Back in the Day (Puff) is just a great song to reminisce to while chilling out. Love of My Life mixes things up a little bit by throwing Queen Latifah into the mix and she sounds better than ever before. This cd also in rockin' the bass and has some serious funk. PICK IT UP NOW!!!
B000001F75|5.0|Don't waste any time. Just buy this. You are a Thin Lizzy fan and this is why. The last LP with Eric Bell and it should be had by you. He is a master and why he left is a mystery to me. Check out the solo on &quot;The Hero And The Madman&quot;. You'll be hooked. Phil Lynott is not only a great singer and composer but a very good bass player as well. Very evident on this. Brian Downey is always right on. They are an awesome trio to say the least. &quot;Slow Blues&quot; and &quot;The Rocker&quot; are among the best of any Thin Lizzy tracks anywhere. &quot;Little Girl In Bloom&quot; , &quot;Gonna Creep Up On You&quot;, it just goes on and on. There is only one track I skip. You'll be able to tell which one. Although I love the 4th album &quot;Night Life&quot; I think it took awhile for the band to gain the momentum lost after this one. I don't think even &quot;Fighting&quot; was quite as good. It's right up there with &quot;Jailbreak&quot; if you ask me. Buy it.
B00009V7RF|5.0|don't miss out on this cd .It is awesome. numeber 3 and 13 are the best. let's get retarded and where is the love.
B00006ZCFH|1.0|DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS CD. I'VE WAITED A LONG TIME FOR TO COME OUT WITH SOMETHING AND ALLI CAN SAY IS THAT I'M VERY VERY VERY EXTREMELY DISSAPPOINTED.
B00005K3OT|5.0|Its got to be one of best movies I have ever seen.  I saw it for the first time several months ago and I thought it was good.  Then I saw it again and liked it so much, I saw it three times in the same weekend.  The music is also wonderful, I had to buy the soundtrack.  I love Juliette Binoche in this movie, she is sweet to everyone even when they were hateful to her. Also love Johnny Depp in this movie, like always, he is a great actor.  Everyone should see this movie at least once.
0385504209|2.0|Sure it is well researched.  Sure it is a page turner.  But it really is the equivalent of chocolate cake:  I can't put that down either, but the pleasure is fleeting and it leaves me fat and lethargic.  This is a fine book for a 6 hour airplane ride.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|What a horrible album. What a horrible band. Godsmack are nothing but a fifth-rate Alice In Chains ripoff. They stole their name from Alice In Chains - Godsmack is an AIC song from the album &quot;Dirt&quot;. They stole their sound from Alice In Chains - their so-called &quot;dark, brooding, angry&quot; sound is a total AIC rip-off as well as Sully's horrible Layne Staley impression. They stole their image from Alice In Chains -  hell, they're even stealing album titles now. &quot;Faceless&quot;? &quot;Facelift&quot;. Even the cover art is a rip-off. If you're going to steal from a great band like Alice In Chains, at least do a decent job of it! Godsmack are nothing but a bunch of unoriginal, untalented, uninspired phonies. Their music is pre-packaged angst for trendy idiots with short memories. They ran out of ideas on this album? - they never had any &quot;ideas&quot; in the first place! They just stole from Alice In Chains. I only wish it were possible to give this album a no-star rating. If ever a band deserved it that band is Godsmack. If you already have this album you should be ashamed. If you're thinking of wasting your money on this album, go buy the real thing (any Alice In Chains or Jerry Cantrell album) instead.
B00000427L|3.0|These CDs features some of the greatest piano work ever created - Thats the good news! The bad news is that this recording has the worst MIXING job I think Ive ever heard on a classical CD.<br />It's not the quality of the recording so much as that the dynamic range is terrible (ie. The highs of the pieces are too close to the lows).<br />Then the biggest problem is that the piano is drowned out of the mix by the rest of the symphony for most of the performances (take note of the 3rd Concerto...it's a travesty to miss such finger-work!).<br />So there you have it. Find yourself another recording, I only wish I had another to recommend...
B0000A02TZ|1.0|I have no idea why this movie was ever popular or why anyone above the age of twelve would find it funny.  There was not one genuine laugh in it.  The &quot;Where Are They Now&quot; extra was very lame as well.  Anybody want to buy my copy?
B00005JG6Q|5.0|AKIRA is a film for both newcomers to the anime world and for established fans of the genre.  For new-comers, AKIRA may be a bit hard to take in during its first viewing due to the plethora of character introductions mixed with a somewhat complex plot.  However, both characters and plot seemlessly come together towards the end of the film.  For established fans of anime, we are all too familiar with the importance of an &quot;ending&quot; rather than an anime's &quot;beginning.&quot; AKIRA will forever remain a timeless classic, and I especially like how the film demands more than one viewing, thus making it very &quot;replayable,&quot; such as a video-game that's so darn good you just have to play/see it again and again and again!  This DVD is enhanced both visually and audibly; in other words, it's DVD quality.  I also enjoy the fact that there is new english dialogue in this DVD release.  If you want to add an anime movie to your library, then AKIRA will do the trick.
B0000029GA|5.0|Nas he just......DESTROYS it on this album. Illmatic Has that Something that other albums dont have. Tight beats, Crazy lyrics, and to think that he was only 20 when this album came out, its just crazy. nas had other rappers scare to death. When i heard It aint hard to tell then i was like nope this guy didnt. This wasnt the best album i heard but of course a great one. while your in the store. do yourself a favor and buy this album.
0385504209|5.0|This book was AMAZING! I finished it in only a couple of days (I'm an active college student) and I wanted to read it all over again! This book was so thrilling, and what a page turner! It also makes me rethink the way I look at modern symbols now, and has really turned me on to cryptology and art history.
B00005JKJA|5.0|First off, most people will hate this movie. If you're familiar with David Lynch you should know what you're getting into. This film is just as confusing as Lost Highway, another Lynch film that most couldn't stand. Another movie this one could be compared to in the aspect of how unconventional it is and how confusing it can be, would be Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, 2001: A Space Odyssey.<br /> I won't bother telling about the plot of Mulholland Drive, but I will say it's a surreal film about love and the devastaion love can cause. This film is very open for interpretation. Most people don't like to think when they watch a movie and all those types of people will swear that this one makes no sense. Mulholland Drive makes perfect sense to me, but I don't believe that there's one specific meaning to this film. It's more like a good painting or song that can mean different things for different people. This movie requires patience and you should expect to watch it at least twice in order to catch everything. A lot of people also complained about the lesbian parts, claiming they were unnecessary. These people totally missed the point of the movie. Sex has always been a huge taboo in the US, even when it's expressed artistically, and that taboo is multiplied that much more when homosexuality is involved. If you like this movie, I'd also recommend Lost Highway and Eraserhead, two other classics by David Lynch.
B00006RU5B|5.0|When I first heard audioslave's songs &quot;Show Me How To Live&quot;, &quot;Cochise&quot;, and &quot;Like a Stone&quot; I really liked Audioslave, but after I bought the album I was obsesessed with them. It's Chris Cornell's(soundgarden) amazing voice and lyrics mixed with the music of Rage Against the Machines. I loved every song on the cd. Here are my individual song ratings.<BR>1. Cochise 10/10  <BR>2. Show me how to Live 10/10<BR>3. Gasoline 10/10<BR>4. What you are 8/10<BR>5. like a stone 9/10<BR>6. set it off 9/10<BR>7. shadow on the sun 7/10<BR>8.

The Last remaining light 6/10 <BR>You amy not agree with my ratings but I only based them on my own opinions. All I'm trying to say is that this is definently a five star cd!
B000003TAR|4.0|I'd put this above Nevermind because it's more raw which is what Cobain was more about. At first I gave it 3 stars but it's grown on me more lately. Cobain was a smart musician. Too bad his bandmates didn't share his same artistic ideals.
B00004Y6O7|4.0|I hated this album when I first heard it years ago.  But multiple listenings have made it my favorite Van Halen album.  The band sounds dischordant and angry on some tracks, like they were ready to beat each other up after a track was recorded.  &quot;Mean Streets&quot; is unquestionably a classic, &quot;Dirty Movies&quot; has some of Eddie Van Halen's most dissonant and bizarre guitar work; &quot;Sinner's Swing&quot; has great harmonies if weak lyrics; &quot;Hear About It Later&quot; gets better with multiple listenings.  Ironically, the worst track, in my opinion, is &quot;Unchained&quot;-the vocals during the verses have very little melody, the guitar is horribly out of tune, and the choruses are catchy but tiresome.  &quot;Push Comes To Shove&quot; almost made me write this album off on the first listening, but only its unusual slow-funk style makes it a difficult listen-it's a good song.  &quot;So This Is Love&quot; almost sounds anti-climactic and bare.  &quot;Sunday Afternoon In The Park&quot; is not a synthesizer solo as is widely believed, but a Michael Anthony bass solo drenched in effects (he even plays this on VH's live album, yet no one seems to know that this is him).  &quot;One Foot Out The Door&quot; is simply bizarre-there is no singalong chorus, if a chorus at all.  There is hardly any conventional song form in this song, for that matter.  Great guitar solo at the end.

B0000029AP|5.0|It is funny to think that once upon a time Aerosmith was just another unknown band. They exploded out of Boston with this hard rocking, bluesy album and made it big. Every band member plays or sings great and they are on top form on this album. Aerosmith was certainly the best American rock band in the 70s. In fact they were good enough to hold their own against the mighty English Led Zeppelin. So do yourself a favor and get this album.<br />1. Toys in the Attic 8/10. Fast, with good guitars with a very cool solo and a nice chorus.<br />2. Uncle Salty 8/10. Addressed child abuse 14 years before Janies got a Gun, and a good song in its own right. <br />3. Adams Apple 8/10. How dids humans get started? Let Steven and the boys tell ya.<br />4. Walk this Way 10/10. Classic. Plain and Simple.<br />5. Big Ten inch Record 9/10. Very funny cover song.<br />6. Sweet Eomotion 10/10. Another Classic.<br />7. No more no more 8/10. Very good song. Simple chorus, yet it works great.<br />8. Round and Round 9/10. Heaviest song on the album. Very over looked song by the casual fan.<br />9. You See Me Crying 1/10. I hate this ballad. After the blistering track before I just can't listen to this drivel.<br />Aerosmith was at their peak on this and their next album. Some would say they never got better than this. Get it and decide for yourself.
B00005JKC3|5.0|I saw the movie and I was stunned. It was the best Marvel movie I had ever seen. The graphics seem very realistic. I can't wait for the DVD to come out.
B0000029AL|5.0|Aerosmith's self tittled debut is one of their best albums. The band is young and fresh, ready to take the world by storm. They accomplished that of course.<br />1. Make It 8/10. Good rockin start.<br />2. Somebody 8/10. Good riffing.<br />3. Dream On 10/10. Classic power ballad. Steven wrote this at the age of 17. Very impressive.<br />4. One Way Street 8/10. At 7 minutes long this was their longest song for over 20 years until a song on 9 Lives was longer.<br />5. Mama Kin 10/10. Hard rocking classic. This song could represent the very essence of rock and roll.<br />6. Write Me a Letter 8/10. I like the swagger and groove on this one.<br />7. Movin Out 8/10. Joe and Steven's first song written together. Great start.<br />8. Walkin the Dog 8/10. Cover of a blues song. They cranked the amps and had fun on this one.<br />If you are new to Aerosmith and want to get into their old stuff you won't be disappointed. Or if you're an old fan who hasn't quite gotten around to pickin up Aerosmith's substantial catalog do yourself a favor and pick it up now.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|I agree with many people that this movie was not as good as the first film. The only thing I think that The Matrix Reloaded did better then The Matrix is the music and the graphics.

B0000AI44Q|5.0|Neil never ceases to amaze me. After seeing the crowds reaction during the the shows prior to the release of the album you could tell who the true Neil Young fans were. Many people were dissapointed but not me. I just caught the show in Atlantic City about a month after the release and the audience reaction was like night and day. Standing ovations. This album is a masterpiece, a work of art by an artist who continues to be an innovator.This is the best music Neil has put out since Rust Never Sleeps.The songs flow together and it's impossible to turn off the CD without listening to the whole thing through.
B000099T2L|4.0|the album is ok for her first solo attempt.  there are at least 5-6 nice joints on the album, which makes it worth the purchase.  if you only have money for one album, you might want to try mya's new joint, which i think is a bit better.  anyway, i'm not sure some of the people posting reviews have listened to the album.  they just write because they dont like her.  it's pretty much the same stuff that goes on over at yahoo's reviews and message boards.
B00005JLSE|2.0|Chicago, 1929. Crime. Passion. Celebrity. Sex. And jazz...<br />I will say from the start that I have mixed feelings about this movie. On one hand, I would have expected to see a movie, being worth indeed 6 Oscars. From my point of view this is not a movie for Oscar awards. On the other hand, I have to admit that it is well done, made by intelligent and creative people.<br />But I can't help it and mention that some details of the movie show a slip of the makers' attention: one of the characters speaks Russian and has a Russian name, but they say she is Hungarian and a cabaret dancer had her silk stockings broken during a preformance.<br />Roxie Hart, an apparently innocent actress, dreams of changing her monotonous life thanks to her talent. She is attracted by the idea of becoming as famous as Velma Kelly, a well known vaudeville actress. She sees her dream come true when, due to some unusual circumstances, she finds herself in jail, next to her idol, both of them beining accused of murder.<br />This is a nice satire at the address of Chicago and its legal system, at a time when jazz was gaining fans and alcohol was prohibited.<br />I also admire the creativity and the rich imagination the movie makers proved when they associated the jail atmosphere with a stage where prisoners performed their own acts.<br />I am not at all a fan of musicals, but I did not get bored watching this movie and I don't regret seeing it. But I would not see it a second time.<br />I recommend this movie only to musical fans or to those who are great admirers of Catherine Zeta-Jones, Rene Zeleweeger or Richard Gere. It will be interesting for you to see them in different roles from what you were used before.
B00008WT5M|4.0|AC/DC was kind of stuck in 1990, after the just average albums FLY ON THE WALL and BLOW UP YOUR VIDEO. So, they hired late famous producer Bruce Fairbairn, went to Canada and recorded their last great album.<br />THE RAZOR´s EDGE is strong,has a crisp sound, drummer Chris Slade has a firm beat, and features twelve songs that, even all of them possessing the trademark AC/DC sound, has its own feel and difference between them.<br />For the first time, Angus and Malcolm shares the credits for themselves, without Brian Johnson.<br />As for this special package, it´s ok, but the lyrics are missing, as in all of the albums of the special edition.

B00005JKN9|3.0|I enjoyed this movie a lot, even recognizing some of its big flaws.<br />The best part is Daniel Day-Lewis. It´s a pity that him seldom works making movies. I wish he did more movies. He´s one of the best actors that EVER lived.<br />The rest of the cast is also good, but simply does not have much material to work with. Cameron Diaz´s character is lost in the middle. DiCaprio did his best, but, once again, the writers did not offer to him a good script.<br />Also great are the scenarios and the historic background. I mean, it´s just a background, don´pt expect a history lesson here. It´s like TITANIC, foe example, where Cameron used a hystorical background to tell a love story. Here, Scorcese used history to talk about the old cliche of revenge, the diffrence being that he got enthusiasthic about his movie and really tried to pass a message.<br />Good movie, it could have been better, but, I´m not a director, just a consumer!

B00004W52U|5.0|Operation Ivy has to be one of the greatest bands to ever record music. Energy is the perfect word to describe this album. Operation Ivy's songs are aggresive yet peaceful, with an intelligence that seperates them from all other punk rock bands. Not only is this album the birth of skacore, it remains the greatest of the genre. Jesse, Tim (Lint), and Matt have gone on to make other amazing records. Check out Rancid and Common Rider.
B000092ZYX|5.0|i think this album sets a new hight in musical standards.this is by far the greatest album released this year.every song on the album is a masterpeice.ot shows many sides of radio head like the soft tracks like &quot;sail to the moon&quot;(which is my favorite song on the album) and &quot;i will&quot; show great talent in the way radio head thinks.it also shows harder more agressive tracks like &quot;go to sleep&quot; &quot;2+2=5&quot; and &quot;myxtosis&quot;. and how  can i forget the artistic masterpieces &quot;where i end and you meet&quot; and &quot;sail to the moon&quot; perhaps 2 of the greatest songs ever written by radio head.finally it ends the album with &quot;there there&quot; and &quot;wolf at the door&quot; that in a way are totally different from each other but the same. if you buy this album (which i strongly suggest you do) you will be overtly satisfied with this record.(i bought it when it came out and i still listen to it everyday thats how good it is
B000000JO3|5.0|Complete Discography is the ultimate example of punk rock. The songs are about being independent, smart, and aware of the world and the way it works. Fiercly agressive from start to finish, Complete Discography remains unequaled in its excellence.
0800141806|5.0|Although Philadelphia is not the sort of film that I would normally buy for my collection, being too sentimental for my personal liking, it is nonetheless a very powerful and important film, that everyone should watch.<BR>Aids was an epidemic that took some time to get noticed outside the gay community, initially the most affected, and as such, as far as movie subjects were concerned,it was largely ignored by mainstream cinema and Hollywood.<BR>The most famous film to deal with Aids at that time was Longtime Companion, but this movie was largely considered as a 'gay' film, and as a result did not quite acquire the distribution and the wider audience that it deserved.<BR>But when HIV and Aids started to affect Hollywood and members of its 'club' then the mentality started to change drastically.<BR>It took the deaths of Rock Hudson, Brad Davis, Tony Richardson, Anthony Perkins and others for Hollywood to wake up to the beast that was slowly creeping up its iron doors.<BR>Philadelphia was primarily the result of this awarness and alarm that gripped the movie industry.<BR>Jonathan Demme's film had such an impact at the time that it got nominated for the Oscar and landed its star Tom Hanks a deserved best actor award (and Bruce Springsteen won his Oscar for the song 'Streets of Philadelphia).<BR>In addition to it being very well directed and acted ,it is a very important film for several reasons, <BR>The fact that Tom Hanks, a loved actor worldwide,a VIP member of the Hollywod club and straight, played the dying gay man with such convincing force, it brought worldwide sympathy to the character, and as a result an increased tolerance,and a deeper understanding and recognition of the problem of AIDS,no longer a fringe virus confined to a 'minorty group', but an epidemic that can affect everyone.<BR>It is also a shout of defiance at the conservative establishment, and can be looked at metaphorically as any fight for justice from any group of minorities, be it sexually or culturally different.<BR>For these reasons Philadelphia is a landmark film with a bold and heartfelt message, as death, love too should be indiscriminate about age, faith, culture and yes gender.
B000000I3O|5.0|A great collection of some of the best Misfits songs, this album is a perfect purchase to start with from the Misfits. Essential punk rock for new and obsessive Misfits fans.
B00005JM02|5.0|I loved this movie so much... I've seen it twice so far and I can't get sick of it! It's so good and the story is fanstastic. Also Dori (Ellen Degeneres) steals the show with her utmost funniness!
0375713751|5.0|This is one of the most entertaining stories I have read in a long time.  As a Mother who worked when my 3 children were young, I could completely relate to her hectic schedule, and the guilt she felt for missing so much of the precious time of babyhood and childhood.  Her humerous description of life during this period had me smiling and laughing throughout the book. Her missed lunches and dates with her female friends were so accurate,good intentions always but never enough time.  In the final pages she had me afraid that she had thrown in the towell, but all turned out well.  I shall be watching for other works from Alison, with great anticipation.  Wonderful. talented author.
B000002I6T|5.0|Yes, I will admit it-- a little part of me is forever stuck in the 60's (and early 70's).  This album goes a very long way towards explaining why.  They just don't make 'em like this anymore.  This is another one of my \\"desert island discs\\", one of that handful of albums I can't imagine having to live the rest of my life without.  It is absolutely brilliant.  A virtual who's who of west-coast-folk-rock-60's-hippie-cool artists of the time, the roster of people who contributed to this album is mind-boggling by any standards.  Everyone from Joni to Neil to Grace and Jorma to virtually the entire Grateful Dead.  One of the most amazing things is that there is absolutely no grandstanding here-- all of the artists greatly contributed but none made an issue of their presence.  At times it can be fun just to try to pick out the various artists as you listen.  And although I'm admittedly an unabashed Dead freak, I just can't let Jerry Garcia's contributions go by without special mention.  Not only can his unmistakable guitar work be heard throughout, but his pedal steel guitar on \\"Laughing\\" is indescribably beautiful.  It is really hard to know where to begin in describing this album and its high points because it's all high (pun very much intended).  This is truly one of the most gorgeous albums I have ever heard.  And as an added plus, it is all astoundingly well recorded for the period (despite the claims of some other reviewers).   Every time I hear this incredible album it makes me simultaneously happy and sad-- happy that such a masterpiece was ever recorded and that it still exists for all to hear and enjoy, and sad that the time it always takes me back to is gone forever.
B000002LE6|4.0|&quot;Controversey&quot; got me intuirged. &quot;1999&quot; got me hooked. &quot;Purple Rain&quot; is almost perfect (aside from that little bit where he lets Apollonia whine on &quot;Take Me With You&quot;) and &quot;Sign O' The Times&quot; is my fave album of all time. But &quot;Lovesexy&quot; is well worth the trip and the tour was the best I've ever seen him. A perfectly realized example of his message of the sacred and profane. But that I can die happy knowing that I have been blessed to have heard &quot;Anna Stesia&quot;...Get your plus sign today.
B0000C5RQF|5.0|Many of us hold up as the standard filmed version of 'The Magic Flute' the one that Ingmar Bergman did at Drottningholm perhaps twenty years ago. Obviously the film opened up the stage and made the opera more cinematic than a staged version could be.<br />This DVD is of a production taped digitally in January 2003 at Covent Garden, a new production staged by David McVicar, designed by John Macfarlane and conducted by that eminent Mozartian, Sir Colin Davis. And, of course, it is simply of a stage production; there is no breaking down the walls of the stage. However, the direction for video is both masterful and unobtrusive. And then there's the production itself.<br />The leading singers are all quite wonderful. The only slightly less than top-drawer singer, in my opinion, is Franz-Josef Selig as Sarastro; he has the cavernous bass required for the part but there is an incipient wobble that distracts. In the 'wonderful' category are some singers previously unknown to me. Tamino is sung by a young German tenor, Will Hartmann, whose voice reminds me of that star German tenor of yesteryear, Rudolf Schock; it is not innately beautiful but it is solid, masculine and has a ringing top. His acting is basic but more than adequate; Tamino is not a role that calls for great acting. The Queen of the Night, Diana Damrau, is not one of those coloratura canaries so often assigned to the role; she is a dramatic coloratura and not only does she sing the role well, her acting is believable. Her makeup and costume make her look, appropriately, like a cross between Morticia Addams and Cruella de Vil. A scary lady. Pamina is sung, and acted believably, by German soprano Dorothea R&ouml;schmann. Her 'Ach, ich fuhl's' is moving and utterly gorgeous. She has floated high notes that cause gooseflesh.<br />The lesser roles are also taken well. Papagena is humorous, physical and well-sung by Ailish Tynan. Monastatos is properly repellantly lecherous and sung with impeccable diction by Adrian Thompson. It was particularly heart-warming to see well-loved veteran basso, Richard Van Allen, as the First Priest; the voice is still there and his acting, as always, is spot on. Thomas Allen's Speaker is a bit less effective but still quite good. The three Ladies, the three Boys and the two Armed Men are all effective sung and acted.<br />My highest praise, though, goes to Simon Keenlyside who is quite simply the best Papageno I've ever seen. His is an extremely athletic performance; he takes some tumbles and makes some leaps that have you gasping in surprise. At one point he slides across the stage--trying to catch a bird at the end of his entrance aria--as well as any short-stop you've ever seen. His comic acting--aided by lots of close-ups--has you laughing out loud, and yet he portrays the longing for 'eine Weibchen' in a way that puts a lump in your throat. His sturdy baritone is one of the best around these days. A real triumph for him. The audience gave him, deservedly, the loudest and longest applause during the curtain calls.<br />Overall, this is the best staged production of 'Zauberfl&ouml;te' I've ever seen. I was riveted and didn't even take a break between the two acts I was so drawn into it. Extras on the DVD inlude brief interviews with McVicar and Macfarlane, and a long interview--quite informative and utterly charming--with Sir Colin. There is also a spoken synopsis that is quite well done, and I'd suggest you view it before you view the opera if you're not very familiar with the plot.<br />I give this DVD my very highest recommendation.<br />Scott MorrisonThompson.

0385512104|5.0|Don't want to go into details and spoil the book for anyone who hasn't read it. All I can say is that I would recommend this book to anyone! I have worked with autistic children before and the voice of the narrator is right on. It's refreshing to get a look at the world through the eyes of a young autistic boy. You'll laugh out loud, and maybe shed a tear or two. I read this book in a day..couldn't put it down! If you're at all curious about the minds of those with autism, or if you just want a quick read that will make you feel something, pick up this book!
B000069AUI|5.0|This album scores a five star rating, because it has a wide range of music appeal for all ages and all music tastes. It handles country, neo-classical and hip hop with ease. Fine example of this, HBO and a commercial use the piano track as back ground music for commercials. You will not be able to keep your fingers from drumming out the beats.
0142437611|5.0|I first read this book years ago, when I was losing my shirt (and just about every other item of clothing I owned) as a commodity-futures trader. Someone had told me the book concerned a guy in the same situation. Readers certainly won't find much in &quot;Seize the Day&quot; about the workings of the commodity markets, but they will discover an incredibly well-explored character named Tommy Wilhelm, who gambles what's left of his money in a desperate effort to get out of hock. Wilhelm is an excruciating combination of victim and self-defeating loser. Bellow's relentless examination of a man on the verge of a nervous breakdown makes for riveting reading. And while Tommy Wilhelm could serve as a poster-boy warning to anyone thinking of speculating in risky investments, he definitely stands as a symbol of what can happen to people when they take themselves and the &quot;American Dream&quot; too seriously.
0609610570|1.0|This book was on the top of my list when it was released. I was under the pretense that \\"Execution\\" would provide examples and vivid reasoing behind getting things done in the business world. Instead I received a lot of \\"Jack Welch Loving\\". The author, having worked under Welch found it very important to mention Welch and GE as much as possible. Not only that, the author gave off a negative vibe, that very few who try will accomplish what they set their goals to do. I can appreciate honesty if an employer tells you, that you are not cut out for something, but this book basically told you, \\"Don't get your hopes of executive mgt. up, because you most likely will not make it.\\"<br />I struggled to read this book, reading a chapter about once a week, and really dredding it the last 50 pages. While there are nuggets.... We all know he is one of the foremost executives of our time. But the title of the book is not Execution and the love for Jack Welch, but, Execution, the discipline of getting things done. I wish the book would have done that.
B00008DDRX|4.0|A great version of the best racing film ever made. The video upgrade is amazing, you can see every detail of every curve on the 917 and ferrari's screeching down the straights. The color is amazing. The sound overall is not great, comparable to the VHS version. The quiet scenes have a great track to them though.
B000099T2L|3.0|Initially, I thought that with the release of the very unique CRAZY IN LOVE and BABY BOY as the two first singles and the talk of Beyonce that this was a very creative and unique CD that this was going to be what was said. However, I was somewhat disappointed. I was not expecting this to be like anything from Destiny's Child because it is a solo project. I was expecting something creative and certainly not run-of-the mill which most of the middle to end songs are. <br />CRAZY IN LOVE- First, introductory single, with a guest by JayZ it is a very creative and fun song perfect for the season in which it was released- the summer. The song was overplayed and did become tiresome and annoying. However, it is a nice song overall and very fun. A<br />NAUGHTY GIRL- Contains a replay of Donna Summer's hit LOVE TO LOVE YA. Elements of Indian music is included here. The song is ok but it is no standout and is definitely not singles-worthy. It is good filler to say the least. B+<br />BABY BOY- Current and fun 2nd single which continues the current Reggae explosing of 2003. The song also contains some Indian influences as evidenced by the video. With a guest by Sean Paul and a tight and cohesive beat this song has smash written all over it. A+<br />HIP HOP STAR- Featuring Big Boi of Outkast and Sleepy Brown, this very unique and unusual song has a rocklike vibe to it. It is ironic that the song's title has hip-hop in it but the song is basically a Beyonce rock song. It is fun and is the kind of originality that I expected for the CD. One already knows that Outkast is unique so an appearance by one of their members makes for a fun song. A<br />BE WITH yOU- This slow song that is not a ballad but is sensual and quiet storm like is very boring overall. It is entirely too slow and there is nothing exciting about the song that has Beyonce saying she just wants to be with the person she is speaking of. Produced by Missy Elliott who usually does better work. B<br />ME, MYSELF AND I- Produced by Scott Storch and Beyonce who both produced BABY BOY, this song is slow but works better than the last one. It is nonetheless too standard and there is nothing special except for a few vocal runs by Beyonce. B+<br />YES- This is the kind of slow music that I like to hear. It is mildly reminiscent of DC's music and is a very tight piece of music. The vocals are passionate and the heavy presence of the beat with innovative production by Beyonce and little-known FOCUS makes this one of the standout tracks. A+<br />SIGNS- Also produced by Missy, this song has a creative title that would cause one to think that the song would have some power or attraction to it. Howerver, the song does nothing and barely says anything. It is so boring as a whole. What happened to Missy in the production of Beyonce? She did much better with Monica's project and some others, she could have done better with B. B-<br />SPEECHLESS- I have heard this on the radio a couple of times. The song is a little too long and drawn out and a bit overproduced. This slow song works better than BE WITH yOU and ME, MYSELF AND I and has some great vocals. B+<br />THAT'S HOW I LIKE IT- I very rarely ever say that something is truly music in my opinion but this work and YES are the songs that are truly music here. Kinda reminiscent of R&amp;B.Pop music of the Pop craze of the late 90s, this song works well and Beyonce's soulfulness but charismatic nature makes it work. With a guest from Jay Z, the song has added dimensions that make it a standout on the CD. A+<br />CLOSER I GET TO yOU- Duet with Luther Vandross, the song is a remake. There is nothing spectacular from the two abled vocalists. It is too laidback like they are both afraid to let loose and sing. The production is a little too weak as a whole. A-<br />DANGEROUSLY IN LOVE- Song appeared on DC'S SURVIVOR 2001 CD. This has the exact same vocals but the arrangements are a bit different. There is a stronger drum presence. The song is one of the best slow songs on the CD and though I am tired of it from hearing it alot on the SURVIVOR effort, it is a touching song with some good vocals. A+<br />GIFT FROM VIRGO- Very boring song that I skip over and remember very little from. The astrological songs on the CD do not work and should be left alone. Very boring. B-<br />BONUS TRACK: DADDY- This touching song that draws comparison to duet partner, Luther Vandross who has suffered a stroke, DANCE WITH MY FATHER, is a very heartfelt and emotion inducing song. A<br />This is an abled debut CD from Beyonce' but it certainly could have been better. Too much of the material is lackluster and run of the mill. Beyonce is defintiely charismatic and is a very competent performer and vocalist. None of this is shown on the CD. We never get to experience her vocal prowress or some of her fun personality save a few tracks. Beyonce is one of the young singers who parallels Patti LaBelle, a great and competent acrobatic vocalist the most. She is a great singer but the CD does not portray that. It is not bad but could have been better. It is a good listen nevertheless.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Ah, APC's second cd (I'm sure you knew that..) It's good and does in fact live up to expectations (for myself at least). The album as a whole though isn't quite as good as Mer De Noms, the first half of Noms in particular but still.. the Failure cover is sweet and this is a damn fine album for a mainstream band (all those other mainstream punk-rock bands suck as you know or should).
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|In general, I like the direction A Perfect Circle took on this album.  There is more ambience, subtlety and many of the songs feel raw (in the radio interview at APC's website Billy admits to leaving mistakes in songs like Blue, and it shows). <br />I admit, not every song impressed me on the first listen. I relate to the cover of the album, because the music crawls over your skin like that big yellow slug - it's a little disarming, but the contrast is so beautiful that you won't be able to wipe away the oozing from your mind.<br />It's easy to criticize the band for including songs like 'Crimes', but the other 90% of the record definitely screams for your attention.
6305291489|5.0|The original version of The Parent Trap was, in my opinion, the best movie to come out of Disney.  Therefore, I wasn't very optimistic about the remake.  So many classics have been remade disastrously that I tend to avoid them if possible.  My curiosity got the better of me with Parent Trap, and I must say I was very pleasantly surprised.  The remake has a terrific cast and a great soundtrack and updates the story in a completely believable way.  Inevitably remakes are always compared to the originals, so in comparison, I won't say I like the new verion better than the original, because I don't.  As good as Lindsey Lohan is, she lacks the star quality that Hayley Mills radiated.  Lohan is possibly the better actress of the two, but Mills' performance is still captivating 40-some years later. I doubt that Lohan's will hold up as well. Dennis Quaid is serviceable in the Brian Keith role, but Natasha Richardson, though charming, does not have the ravishing beauty nor the spot-on comic timing of Maureen O'Hara.  Wisely, Leo G. Carroll's role in the original wasn't even recast here--who could match him?  Before you fans of the new version hit that &quot;NO&quot; button, read on...<br />Although the basic plot is the same, all of the characters names except one and all the locales and particulars have been changed.  Joanna Barnes, who played the conniving Vicki in the original, plays her character's mother in the new version--still named Vicki.  This leads me to suspect that she is the same character--the Vicki of the original gets married to a rich man, has a daughter named Merrideth, and raises her to be a gold digger just like mom--making the new Parent Trap more of a sequel than a remake.  Far-fetched?  Yes, but in Disney-land anything is possible. Plus, by considering the new Parent Trap a sequel, I don't have to compare them.  There's room for both versions on my DVD shelf.  The original--still my favorite--and the remake/sequel--a funny, warm, and entertaining film--running a close second and quite possibly the best remake ever made!
B00005JKN9|1.0|This film should have been cut down to 1-1/2 hour. DeCaprio--great actor, but miscast, in real life, he would have been beaten up a bit more when he came out of the orphanage--too pretty for this part. You needed grittier looking guy. Day-Lewis over the top, Johnny one-note, snarl, growl, snarl, growl, etc. I know he can do subtlety, and should have used a bit in this film. Two excellent actors wasted in this dismally long, boring film. If you see one fight, you've seen them all. Didn't have to bring in the Civil War Draft Riots, it just made it lose the point of the rivalry between the two main characters. We didn't need that much of a history lesson. Many of us know when the Civil War draft riots took place in New York, and those who don't didn't need to know about it in context with this film. Diaz--is this the look of a slum girl? Lots of bad things would have happened to her if she looked like that in those days in that place. Lovely hair? Who cut and styled it in the slums? Better writing could have yielded two films of this one. It was like sailing through a mess of garbage all looking about the same. I rented &quot;The Pianist&quot; at the same time I rented &quot;Gangs . . .&quot;. World of difference. That actor knew how to, and did, use emotional range in his role. That's why he won an Academy Award.
B000003S0I|3.0|I have followed King Crimson from the In The Court album up to Three Of A Perfect Pair. After that I've found the group has developed into something less interesting. The Larks' album is highly rated by many fans but it's not one of my favourites. But KC fans are reputed to be articulate and well behaving so therefore I dare to deliver my doubtful thoughts upon it.<BR>The first track is an unusual way to open an album, a long instrumental track that starts very quiet and subtle but biulds up around some simple but powerful chord changes at the end. Great! Book Of Saturday, Exiles and Easy Money follows which are three of KC's more accessible tunes with fine vocals by Wetton. The Talking Drum is a repetitive tune that I've never liked too much. What's the point? It doesn't really develop too much from start to end. Maybe its role is to be a prelude to the final track Larks' Tongues In Aspic, Part Two. A classic KC tune from this era but the sound is very thin, not at all as brutal as on the USA live album. And that goes for the rest of the album too. Howcome the cousin album Starless And Bible Black sounds so much fatter?
B00005JLSE|5.0|It took me a long time to even rent this DVD, not because I don't love musicals of all kinds, but because I could never stand Fosse's choreography. Everyone always looked like their limbs were disjointed. But, last week my 40-year-old son and I were comparing movies, and he told me he loved \\"Chicago\\" and suggested I rent it. Well, I loved it, too. Most of the choreography was more in keeping with the old-fashioned hoofer style, but I saw Fosse's style in the \\"He Had it Coming\\" number, and it was great. For those of you who wanted a sweet lovely musical, just try to find one. All of them have some sort or conflict--for heaven's sake, Oklahoma had a murder, and Sound of Music had people fleeing for their lives from a Nazi invasion. Chicago is a beautifully crafted musical satire of the Twenties, and it's full of energy, great singing and dancing by people you'd never think could sing and dance. CZ-J put a hard edge on her character and changed her speech patterns to add reality to the time and the place she was portraying, and she did it brilliantly. To those of you who were shocked by the hardness in this film, we have one thing to say to you, \\"That was the Chicago way! Let's be glad we can now sing, dance, make fun of it, and laugh about it.\\"
B000050IE6|5.0|I bought this CD just the other day, and from the second I started my cd player to the second the cd was up I loved it.  This isn't like most of your late 90's black metal which is filled with either total screaming or electronics.  This is a nice blend of musical talent and classic sounds you have heard, which comes together as one of the most beautiful albums I have ever heard.  Each song is a bit long... and thats my only complaint, but they dont even seem to be that much longer than I would like and considering I usually listen to 30 seconds and get bored the 8 minutes of each song on here I can put up with is impressive.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle absolutly lives up to the hype.  I bought this cd the day it was released and haven't quite listening yet.  every song moves you in a way that only truely gifted musicians can accomplish.  the acustics are by far the best i have heard and the wait was well worth it.  pick up this disk, it is well worth it.  it will make the hairs on the back of your head stand up.
6300182193|3.0|I don't agree that this is the best version of<BR>Dracula.  Of course Frank Langella is a wonderful and talented<BR>actor,  but my favorite dracula film is the classic<BR>version which starred Bela Lugosi.  I think it is the<BR>better version of Dracula.  But judge for yourself.<BR>So many actors have done this one role over and over<BR>again. How can anyone judge the better version of this<BR>film.  Of course, Frank Langella steamed up the<BR>screen in 1979 as a more sensuous and sexy dracula.<BR>Definitely any woman's fantasy. If you want a good<BR>scare, definitely either rent any of the Dracula<BR>films with Christopher Lee or the old version from<BR>1931.
6304681011|4.0|After surviving a car accident during a drag race with a bunch of friends, Mary Henry (beautiful Candace Hilligoss) travels to Utah to begin work as church organist. When she begins seeing a mysterious tall man and experiencing moments of non-existence, she starts to fear that she is trapped between the world of the dead and the world of the living. &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; was made on a shoestring budget, but still remains to give me the creeps with its spooky organ music and otherworldy performances and direction. The edition I'm reviewing contains an effect added to the film in the late 70s for its re-release. It's called Super-Psychorama and adds green tint and strobe effects to the scenes with the spirits.
6300182193|3.0|I want to add a few comments to the review of this film<br />I just left.  An excellent comparison that could be done,<br />if your discoving this character for the first time is.<br />Read Bram Stoker's novel and then watch the 1979 version.<br />The author doesn't imply how handsome or attractive Dracula <br />really is.  The only thing you know is,  that Dracula is<br />attractive to women especially,  but your not given a reason<br />for it,  accept that women can be easily be manipulated and<br />controlled, as opposed to men.  Dracula can easily bend the<br />will of his victims,  that's why women fall under his spell.<br />Men on the other hand appear slightly stronger when coming up<br />against the Dracula character.   There are different<br />interpretations of this character, but again we don't know how<br />appealing and sexy dracula is.  In the 1979 version that<br />sexy quality comes out more then any other quality this<br />man may have.  It shows how irrestible and attractive he<br />is to women.  But their are different levels associated<br />with attraction.  I think part of the interpretation of<br />Dracula in the 1979 version,  comes from the actor who<br />played the role and the writers for the film.  Well,<br />that's what I think anyway.  Yes, I am a fan of this<br />actor.
B00009TB5G|5.0|With the smell of LotR still lingering in your home, remember films like Willow, or Conan: The Barbarian. Remember in the early '80s when the fantastic, the supernatural and the ephemeral were box office smashes, and the plague of teen films (starring Freddie Prinze Jr., and That Kid From American Pie)weren't even thought of, yet. (Yes, there was the earlier models of such films back then. Even so, they were of higher quality, and lacked the effect of brain atrophy.) I guess what I'm trying to say is: Peter Jackson is moving film in the right direction with this movie, in both it's atmosphere and content. Definite 5 stars.
B00005ARDC|4.0|SF-based trio Black Rebel Motorcycle Club became an indie sensation in the UK with their debut album (issued in 2001). So far, the US has barely noticed, but that may change with their just-released follow-up album &quot;Take Them On, On Your Own&quot;.<br />This is a dark, brooding album (11 tracks, 57 min). The tone is set on the opener &quot;Love Turns&quot;. The best track immediately follows: &quot;Red Eyes and Tears&quot; has a searing and distorted but irresistable guitar hook. &quot;Whatever Happened To My Rock and Roll (Punk Song) is not punk, but an all-and-out rock assault, another highlight. &quot;Awake&quot; is an accoustic strum-along crashing into a wall-of-sound (oft-mentioned comparisons to the Stone Roses are understandable). Other highlights include the slow-burner &quot;As Sure As The Sun&quot; and the heavily distorted &quot;Spread Your Love&quot;.<br />It is easy to see why the BRMC's debut album made such a big splash in the UK. Although a bit overlong (&quot;Head Up High&quot; feels out of place), this is a great collection of songs. Here's hoping that BRMC finally finds the recognition it deserves in the US with their even better follow-up CD, just released.
6300182282|5.0|I read the &quot;Soul Mate&quot; review and have to agree. Its a greatmovie.  This Movie belongs to Bernadette M. And myself, we are that movies real life counterpart.  I found my soulmate and have been in love with her since I first met her.  In essence, everytime I see that movie I think of her and vice versa. If ever a movie depicted the true dynamics of such a situation, this movie is it.  Bernadette M. and I have been in love for over 10 years,and I'll never stop being deeply in love with her.
B00007KQG5|5.0|This adaption of D.H. Lawrence has fairly explicit content, for a BBC adaption, and certainly won't be on Masterpiece Theatre, any time soon; at least, without some heavy editing.  Ms. Richardson displays quite a bit of flesh, in this adaption, as does Mr. Bean<br />(not the one played by Rowan Atkinson) and there are a few suprising inclusions of the most infamous word (we all know what that is) in the English language.  Wilby is sufficiently stuff, bitter, and arrogant as Lord Chatterley.  Bean is rough, yet tender, as Mellors; and Richardson is delicate but very sexy, as Lady Chatterley, and she has an attractive but stuffy sister, who could do with a bit of what Constance got.  Worth a definite look.
B000002UB6|5.0|PHIL SPECTOR and LET IT BE<br />Paul McCartney should check his ego out.  First he wanted to change the song credit to McCartney/Lennon on all the songs they wrote together.  What an insult to John.  But John is dead and can't defend himself.  Phil Spector is in a lot of trouble now and Paul chose this time to totally disrespect the job that Phil did on the Let it Be album.  Phil's work added a depth and a melancholy and a weight to that good but not great Beatle's album.  The strings he added to The Long and Winding Road make it a majestic wall of sound song where as without the sweeping orchestral it is just another mediocre Beatle's pop song.  It was the thing and it is still the thing to call that album overproduced when the fighting Beatle's dumped the project on Spector.  What did the Beatles expect?  He did his usual swelling wall of sound production on it and firmly stamped the Phil Spector sound on the project.  He did a great job on Let It Be and then all the Beatles and many of the critics found that hook, \\"overproduced\\" and jumped on it.  I will not buy Paul McCartney's weak attempt to kick another man when he is done like he kicked down John when John is in his grave and can't fight back against \\"The Happy Beatle\\".  Screw Paul, Phil Spector rules.  They shouldn't touch Let It Be.  Clancy
B0000B3FCX|5.0|Considering that Nickelback started out as a little indie band that no one cared about, they have hit a chord across the world with Silver Side Up, and now with The Long Road about to be released, they are going to do it all over again.  I've heard the new disc, and all I can say is it's even better than SSU, it's deeper, harder, and louder.  Anyone who loves Nickelback is going to drool over this one, and who know's, for the people that think they suck, this disc might just make them think twice about that.
B0000844IT|5.0|This isn't a visual masterpiece, nor does it showcase the greatest talents in showbiz...but you cant beat the knee slapping one liners and Bruce Campbell demolishing everything in sight. What a movie! Im not worthy!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I just want to share that I LOVE this album.  It's beautiful, emotional, hard sometimes/ soft when it should be, it's just... perfect.  :)   And no, it doesn't sound like anything out there, it's original &amp; it's magnificent... buy it!   <BR>Erin
B000003H34|1.0|Jesus, how incredibly boring can a band get? Well, self loathing, pretentious metalheads Anathema have no competition here. This album can put you to sleep in under 15 minutes with its repetitive, stoic, cardboard tunes.
B00005JLO2|5.0|In a lyrical and circuitous route we are carried through the story of one Englishman (Heath Ledger)and his penance for what is judged cowardice in his time. The director has brought an Eastern philosophical sway to the music, the cinematography and the development of the story.  The acting is superb. At the heart of the movie is Abou Fatma (Djimon Hounsou), the African whose character, courage and maturity give this movie its anchor. Without the counter-point of his code of honor, perhaps we would not see the more mystical side of the Englishman's quest to redeem himself. All told, &quot;The Four Feathers&quot; deserved more than it got from some major reviewers.
B00004U8DV|4.0|This album is maybe The Doors best album since Strange Days. The album can do without The Changeling, Cars Hiss By My Window, and Crawling King Snake. Been Down So Long, L'America, The WASP (Texas Radio and the Big Beat), and Hyacinth House are great songs to help support the album. Love Her Madly is a great song. The title track, L.A. Woman, is a great song with so much energy, especially with the big build-up during the bridge. The band leaves us with Riders On the Storm, which is just pure brilliance. The Doors finish up with one of their best albums ever.
B00005JLSE|1.0|To waste the time, talent and treasure on this film was too bad. Katherine Zeta-Jones is a very talented and stunningly beautiful woman, and she was the highlight of the film. Some other reviewer mentioned that various musicals have had cynical edges but the difference is that these classical musicals had a redeeming thread of morality.  Though the characters may have had a lapse or some were just &quot;bad&quot;, there was an accord about what was permissable for human beings in society. There are no &quot;good guys&quot; in &quot;Chicago&quot; and no one to root for, no underdog whom you can relate to, no reason not to hang the two ladies. And you don't even care.  Add to that the freakish surrealism of the filming style and you have a long and unpleasent viewing experience.
B0000C8AUO|4.0|Reminded me of the Berlin years.  If you are a Bowie freak, buy it.  If you are not - get a clue.  Bowie is a genius!  <BR>Check out Low, Lodger, and Scary Monsters.
B00001OH7X|5.0|David Bowie has made many fine albums and I own most of them. However, I am always a little surprised that this one seems to get overlooked. My friend loaned me the vinyl when we were in high school in the early 80's (his purchase no doubt prompted by the cool \\"DJ\\" video then in heavy rotation on MTV) and I have always returned to it over the years.<br /><br />To me, Lodger is right up there with Station to Station, Scary Monsters, etc. I have always thought that the late 70's marked the apogee of Bowie's career, where he was at once leading and transcending the New Wave then in vogue by inventing new sounds and new ways to rock out. The rocking out part is key here; you want to crank this record up. Boys Keep Swinging, DJ and Look Back in Anger are take-no-prisoners workouts. I can't tell you how many mix tapes I have made that included Red Sails.
B00005JMD3|2.0|This will show up on the USA network some day, as their ad campaign last year stated, \\"No films, just movies.\\"  SWAT was a mildly pleasant ride with few, if any surprises.  It was difficult for me to fool myself into thinking I didn't have the major plot points down after the first five minutes.  A friend said something to the effect of \\"A movie like that, people stick around for the dialogue, not the plot points.\\"  It's just unfortunate that the dialogue wasn't more creative.<br />There was one shining moment of creativity in this movie.  This has been stated about SWAT everywhere from the trailers to capsule reviews, so I'll just tell you this may be a very MILD spoiler.  The question of what might happen if an international criminal offered 100 million dollars to anyone who would get him out of prison was the one thing about this movie that really seemed fresh and original.  Some of the proposed answers to that question were rather disappointing, however, and on a couple levels reinforced stereotypes about people of color in LA.  <br />Bottom Line: Fun escapist fare.  Samuel L. Jackson probably saves the movie, but if you can only see one Jackson SWAT movie, make it The Negotiator, which you can convieniently purchase right here at amazon.com, or at your local retailer. :)
B000002GK1|5.0|Although not as big as other Seattle &quot;grunge albums&quot; from 1991, Badmotorfinger tops them all for: great vocals, songwriting, arrangements and raw power.  Before Badmotorfinger, Soundgarden's albums usually lacked the power and interesting guitar work of this album and Superunknown.  But, with this album, all of the best strands of Soundgarden's music came together and it made them a nationally known act.  If you like innovative arty metal with Led Zeppelin power, this is the album for you.
B0000C8AVM|3.0|There is too much purple. I like purple album covers, but this is not a purple album. The music does not have much to do with the color purple. The original was definitely more red. Dylan did not have purple hair at this stage in his career. If you are thinking of buying this because it is purple please be aware it is really not a purple record. Moby Grape made purple abums with purple covers. Tell your kids this was not a purple record. They may think this was originally purple.
0425152251|3.0|A cute, fairly clever novel that threads a story line and introductory philosophy lectures into a fat notebook.<br />I gave it 3 stars because as an introduction to philosophy it succeeds relatively well. It covers most of the key figures in Western Philosophy, and gives the gist of their ideas. It must be noted though, that the book misses some key figures, it virtually ignores Modern Philosophy and Eastern Philosophy, and it is superficial on many occasions. It is not a particularly thorough intro.<br />The style of presentation is just okay. Not dull but not engrossing. The summaries are presented in the form of long dialogues between Alberto and Sophie. I did not find those dialogues to be particularly stimulating - Alberto lectures and Sophie merely interjects pithily between lengthy paragraphs.<br />As a novel I would give it no more than 2 stars. The plot is weak, the writing pretty flat, linear, with little emotional impact and no character development or a central problem. We don't really care about the characters. What keeps it somewhat interesting as a novel, are the many clues Gaarder sprinkled throughout. They might get you curious to know how it all ends, although, frankly, that too could have been better. Had Gaarder been cleverer, he would have tied the ideas and clues all together, but he has not. The finale is not really the culmination of all the preceding ideas or clues, and that's very unsatisfying.<br />All in all, it's a good book to give to an intelligent teenager or young adult, as it might stimulate him or her to study philosophy. As an adult though, if you're new to the topic, you might want to read it for its novelty and for the ease of presentation. Then, you might want to turn to the real deal: Bertrand Russell's \\"A History of Western Philosophy\\", which is, undoubtedly, one of the finest introductions to the topic.
B000006045|4.0|I don't know too much about their other albums, but I can't imagine any other being better than &quot;Mezzanine&quot;. You can call this trip-hop or electronica if you want, but this is just cool mood music that is beyond beautiful. Perfect for putting on after the bars at home, with that last drink or smoke of the night. With guest vocals from &quot;The Cocteau Twins&quot; singer, and a cool sample of &quot;The Cure&quot; on track seven, you know this is gonna be good. &quot;Teardrop&quot; was the big song from this, and the rest is just as moving. It will go great with your &quot;Portishead&quot; and &quot;Sneaker Pimps&quot; cd's.
B00008X5J3|1.0|This movie is horrible.  How did it win any awards? I gave it a 1 star rating, it really should be a 1/2 star, but that was not available.
B000002UB6|3.0|Although I don't like the album quite as much, The Long and Winding Road and Get Back are good songs that wouldn't have existed without Phil Spector stepping in.<br />The Beatles basically dumped a bunch of unfinished demo tapes on Spector, who turned it into a respectable release.
6304286961|4.0|Kilmer is Morrison in this movie, he acts and feels out what the man did and how he saw the way he did. This is a big winner and I like The Doors myself and this was a good one. Hooray for Oliver Stone for making this awsome movie. Long live Morrison
B0000C8AUO|5.0|Optimistically explosive, electrifying, fresh, invigorating, expansive tunes from the consummate master of visions. Bowie has colorfully melded that unique spontaneity of his trademark seventies sound; with a cultured, seasoned, enduring and relentlessly upbeat, post-apocalyptic tempo - pushing boundaries and assuring all of us who have stuck with him through stickier times that no, he'll never get old.<br /> Surprisingly powerful rockers insinuate their chords around your neurons like elegantly twisting serpents bent on catapulting you into one delectable and perhaps forbidden dimension after the next. A fifty-six-year-old CAN make you younger. If that scares you, then avoid this knowledge tree.<br />  The keyboards and drums will delight, as will Gail Ann's magical bass. Tony Visconti pulls the best of Bowie's backing vocals to recreate those hopelessly lovely and memorable harmonies we have come to expect but don't always get.<br /> With every listen one picks up on marvelous new nuances and uncharted neural circuitries are explored with such delight.<br /> Thinking of the last three or four Bowie offerings (which I loved) I feel that Bowie has delivered in Reality the broadest palette, with something here for everyone (while compromising nothing), but especially fitting: an overall rich reward to those of us who have been there every step of the way.<br /> Twenty years on, after the Serious Moonlight, those of us who have been endlessly influenced by this pioneer still thrill to the beat that never ends. Stars have fallen from the sky while Bowie shines on.<br /> Bring me the disco king and I'll feed him a strong dose of Reality, according to the genius of its highly adept, unparalleled and foremost manufacturer - the remarkable and inimitable David Bowie.
B00006V9A0|4.0|This cd, like every collection, could have been better. 14 tracks isn't too short, but we could have had a few more. Another song from \\"Bleach\\" would have been nice. But what it does have is the great new song, a couple b-sides, one from \\"Bleach\\", two from the \\"Unplugged\\" album, and then a handful from both \\"Nevermind\\" and \\"In Utero\\". Really this is just a track or two from being a perfect \\"best of\\". Though each album is excellent, I would suggest this to the person looking for just one \\"Nirvana\\" cd. It will go great with your \\"Alice In Chains\\", \\"Soundgarden\\", and \\"Stone Temple Pilots\\" hit cd's.
B000069AUI|5.0|I have been waiting a long time to find a group that actually cares about melodies and songwriting.  After enduring one awful MTV promoted band after another, Coldplay was a godsend.  <BR>As someone who loves some of the older groups such as Queen, Fleetwood Mac, and The Police, as well as Counting Crows, I am so glad that these guys managed to get some airplay in a time when we hear the same pop/rap/hip hop stuff repeatedly on the radio.<BR>If you like Coldplay, go check out stuff by Mark Geary (an Irish guy who played with Coldplay this summer), Josh Ritter, and Collider (a punkier poppier band that puts a lot of emphasis on melodies as well). I was recently exposed to these artists, and really enjoyed them all. Allright, we finally have some good music to listen to.
B000002UAU|2.0|&quot;If it weren't for Sgt. Pepper, progressive rock would never have existed&quot;?.  I doubt it.  <br />This is an OK album with a few good tracks like A Day in the Life that can be had on the various greatest hits compilations without having to deal with songs like Within You Without You.  2-stars.
6303443214|5.0|loved it, loved it. this movie kicks you back in the old days and then takes you back in the new days. good production and good settings for the film, or you can say&quot; back in the old days, before I became a vampire.&quot;. something like that. but this is very good. Cruise is good as Lestat but Townsend rocked as Lestat in Queen Of The Damned. Pitt is equally as good as Cruise and Banderas needs to cut his hair. Slater kicks as well. an A+
0156027321|5.0|What a fabulous surprise this was!! This book is packed with fascinating details on topics ranging from Hindu, Muslim, and Christian religions, to Indian food, to animal behavior, to the behavior of weather, the ocean, and algae. On and on it goes. I am amazed at its depth of detail, its grand spiritual and human sweep, and its glorious, gory, and ecstatic writing, all packed into a mere 319 pages. It's a classic, no doubt about it. I recommend it for post-Harry Potter reading, and I will jump on the next Yann Martel book. I pray he has much more to tell us in whatever comes next.
0385504209|4.0|There are books you read because you feel some sort of compunction to be educated, there are books you read because others feel you should be educated, and there are books you read just for fun that end up being educational; this book falls into that last category.  This book is enlightening on two main points, the role of the &quot;Illuminati&quot; in art history, and the deep distaste Mr. Brown has for the Catholic Church.  Despite the bone he has to pick with &quot;Rome&quot; the book is very interesting, and even though it is a popular murder mystery, it does not descend into rank sentimentality. Overall, an excellent read.
B0000C8AVE|5.0|No question about the music - five stars - but if you're reading this, you probably already know that.  You're wondering about this new reissue, right?  Good news. The new edition is great. The sound is airier and more crisp, and the packaging is more complete and fancier.  However, sometimes the vocals are a tad high in the mix, particularly on 'Don't Think Twice.'  The new reissues of 'Highway 61 Revisited' and especially 'John Wesley Harding' have similar problems for some reason.  But the problem is much less pronouced on Freewheelin.  All in all, five stars.
0385504209|5.0|I'm sure that some will be annoyed at the liberties taken by Mr. Brown took when explaining the conspiracies, but I thought they were fine considering this is a great fiction tale. I'm an engineer by trade and I've learned that authors need some freedom when writing. The story is number one and the fact a close second.<br />Great story, great plot, wonderful characters, and believable conspiracy, make this one of the best books I've read this year.
B00003CXZ1|4.0|As a serious Tomb Raider fan I hesitated a long while to see this movie so as not to have my illusions shattered.  I finally gave in and borrowed the movie, enjoyed it, watched it twice in two days and will buy it along with the second one.  I don't think Tomb Raider deserved anywhere near the lashing it received.  It's a movie based on a computer game.  What exactly were people expecting?  The movie was lots of fun to watch, the sets were right on and Angelina Jolie made a great Croft in my opinion.  Was the plot line exemplary? No.  Was the character development there?  No.  Is it going to be up for an Academy Award?  No.  But it had all the attitude, and all the action.  I enjoyed Resident evil and I love Indianna Jones.  If you like those, you'll enjoy Tomb Raider.  And compared to Resident Evil, which had absolutely no story line or character development (again, a movie based on a computer game where you kill zombies, okay, who needs a story line?) Tomb Raider is a classic.  It's a fun movie.  Take it at face value, relax and enjoy!
B00004TJTS|4.0|I just revisited this movie, and i realized how great a movie this is. Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane were very good in this, but, i have to admit, i loved frankie muniz for it most of all, considering he is the main character. His current movies bother me, but this, this is classic. Some of the scenes were a little slow, but gee, the ending makes me cry. Any movie or show that can make me do that deserves some kind of treat.
B0000640WX|4.0|This 1982 film introduced the character &quot;John Rambo&quot;, and was followed by other films that portrayed a powerful but misunderstood superhero. Rambo is arrested for walking through a small town, but makes his escape against great odds. He flees into the wilderness, Sheriff Teasel's men in hot pursuit. [Does this remind you of some early Hitchcock films?] The many forces combined against one man prove unequal. [&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot; or &quot;Yojimbo&quot;?] Like some Hitchcock films, the visuals are used more than dialog for the story.<br />Most of the film is devoted to the hunt for Rambo in the cold, rainy forest. Rambo eludes his pursuers, the hunted becomes the hunter. The dead and wounded are brought out of the wilderness. The forces against Rambo are escalated, yet success eludes them. Colonel Trautmann, who trained Rambo to be the best killing machine, shows up to confront the Sheriff, and attempts to end the conflict by a political solution (&quot;let him go, get him later&quot;).<br />The burning gas station echoes that scene in &quot;The Birds&quot;, a film about Nature taking revenge. Shooting into electrical transformers creates a blackout that is all too familiar. The explosions and fires are another disaster. Does the ending with the Colonel remind you of Steinbeck's &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot;? While Rambo walks away, the rest of the story is left to your imagination.<br />The military trains its guard dogs to be vicious, and to obey only their handler. When the handler leaves the service, his dog is destroyed; it has outlived its usefulness. This film is important as an example of propaganda in the movies. A psychotic drifter who kills police and National Guardsmen is portrayed as a hero! Could this happen in real life? Does the failure of the hunt for Rambo echo the Vietnam war? Does the attack on the town portend future terrorism?
B000002MU3|5.0|I don't normally write reviews for discs as over-reviewed as this one (109 reviews and counting), but I thought I might be able to offer a different perspective on this album, seeing as how my two favorite REM albums are 'Monster' and 'Murmur', and I find 'Green' unlistenable! This may put me in a special group of REM fans...so let me explain why I love this album so!<br />If 'Automatic' was the first sign that REM was breaking out of the pretentious, chirpy, god-awful bubble gum of 'Green' and 'Out Of Time' by becoming more serious and austere (albeit extremely low-energy), then 'Monster' finished REM's re-emergence as a newer, better-than-ever and extremely hard-rocking ensemble. Gone are any additional instruments (strings, brass, mandolins, etc.), this is just the four REM dudes rocking their socks off. They also seem to be enjoying the new energy level, and that sense of enthusiasm permeates the album.<br />For you gloom n' doom fans (me too!) there are still the tormented 'Let Me In' and the wistful and countrified 'Strange Currencies', also the ethereal raga-rock of 'You'. But this album is mostly about the rockers. From 'What's The Frequency, Kenneth?&quot; on, this CD never lets up the loud, buzzing and partified atmosphere. I also like how Stipe sings in a variety of voices, falsetto on 'Tongue', and a Gordon Lightfoot-esque growl for 'Crush With Eyeliner'. Other faves are 'I Took Your Name' and the chugging 'Circus Envy'. The only tune I'm not 100 percent behind is 'King Of Comedy', although it has great lyrics, it's a wee bit grating.<br />All in all, if you like REM, AND you like to rock, pick this one up. Used, it's often cheaper than any other album by them (probably due to most fans wanting to hear 'Losing My Religion' redone another 1000 times...).
B00000J7S8|5.0|I recently discovered Diana Krall... I'm so glad I did! She has a beautiful low voice... just right to croon out those great jazz songs. Some songs have some suggestive lyrics, especially \\"Popsicle Toes\\", but over all not bad lyrics... Wonderful romatic crooning music.. Diana Krall is so talented! The same feel as Billie Holiday! Diana Krall, keep the cds coming!

B000003S2K|5.0|Brian Eno's \\"Music For Airports\\" is an exquisite piece of beauty that still holds up since its initial release 25 years ago. It was the very first album to labeled as 'ambient music' and has gone on to inspire numerous imitators. Even today, the album is used as background music for therepeutic purposes in many hospitals.<br />The album consists of four lengthy pieces which are titled numerically. The first, \\"1/1\\", is a gently simplistic piano piece with numerous bell like tones enhancing the background. The second piece, \\"2/1\\", consists of an angelic choir of voices whose harmonies were created stricktly by chance. Each note was recorded onto a separate piece of tape by Eno. The tapes of the voices were arranged so that each note would ocurr at random thus creating pure chance harmonies. The end result is a beautiful tapestry of sound which sounds like it were a throughly composed piece instead of the other way around. \\"1/2\\" once again features the voice loops only this time, they are accompanied by acoustic piano. The style of this piece is very much in the vein of popular instrumental pianist George Winston. The closing piece \\"2/2\\" was performed entirely on synthesizer and is a calming soundscape of pleasant tones. This piece is similar to the solo work of Cluster's Hans-Joachim Roedelius.<br />It is easy to understand why \\"Music For Airports\\" is such a pioneering album. It is a perfect piece of beautiful simplicity that doesn't sounded dated at all. This album was a blueprint for many of today's ambient and 'new age' music. Highly influential and a definitive piece of work.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|No other preformance has yet to be matched (and probably never will) by Al Pacino in Scarface. Excess is the name of the game in this epic film in the 80's. No other character has be more imitated than Tony Montana. Scarface is a classic and remains the best movie in cinematic history. Who should you trust on this review \\"ME THAT'S WHO!!\\"

B00005JMCN|5.0|One the best movies Hollywood has produced in years.  We need more movies about real winners in life and less about the losers. I think the whole cast did a wonderful job portraying  their respective roles, very believable.  I was completely drawn into the storyline, and found myself cheering in the end.  Great movie Hollywood!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Brilliant work! In the sea of nu-metal junk, I can hardly believed Iron Maiden is still rocking quality heavy metal. If you are a true metalhead, buy &quot;Dance of Death&quot;.
B00007J4SI|3.0|After reading the other reviews here and subsequently purchasing this set, I feel that people should be warned about the audio character of the CD's.  There's noise on the tracks - they were recorded in '74.  And the piano has a dry &quot;bite&quot; that distracted me.  I was hoping for a soft romantic sound.  I couldn't fully appreciate the performances because of these issues.  The price is nice; however, if you are just looking for Grade A recordings to fill the Scriabin gap in your collection, this set might not satisfy.
B00008URYM|2.0|If anyone other than Madonna had recorded this song it would have been dubbed one of the worst songs ever.  The lyrics are interesting and I can understand why she wanted to release a song about this topic - but BLAH - the music is AWFUL! I like Madonna, she great, I have all of her albums and many of her singles - but this one stinks.  I like some of the other songs on the album of the same name, it's worth your time and money, but this single isn't. The song is just all wrong - it doesn't flow, it's all over the place, trying to decide what it wants to become and never quite discovering it. I can listen to it, it's not horribly painful like some other bad songs - but I rarely do by choice. One of Madonna's worst works. This single is only for DIE HARD fans.
B00008PX8P|5.0|With this release, it makes me impatient to see the Who's fully restored DVD, the Kids Are Alright, due out Sept. 30th. If its as good as this it will be incredible. Zep has never been my fvorite band, but this DVD almost convinced me otherwise. They play like they are the ONLY rock band that matters. We know it aint exactly true, but it is mind blowing stuff. Kudos to bands that actually care enough to release things for the fans of this quality. Hopefully the Stones are next . . .
B000002LLC|2.0|There are two good songs on this cd: Vogue and Something to Remember. Both can be purchased on other Madonna albums (the Immaculate Collection and Something to Remember - a ballad collection), both of which are much better albums. I would strongly recommend them instead of this seeing as it's her most boring album to date.
B00001QGIQ|2.0|While Pinocchio may be considered one of Disney's classics, some of the scenes/content in this older animation would not be shown or considered appropriate in today's children's movies.  Gepetto is shown smoking in bed.  Many of the characters smoke. Young boys are brought -- as a treat -- to a place where they can smoke, &quot;drink&quot; (something frothy like beer or root beer), and act very destructively as much as they want.  The boys are tricked into thinking this is a fun place to go but are turned into donkeys and sold to work in mines -- never again to see their families.  In the end, old Gepetto does get his wish.  Pinocchio is a real boy.  And old Gepetto gets to share his bed with the young boy.  While all such scenes could be used for discussing appropriate behavior, I wouldn't recommend showing this movie to children.  I made the mistake of showing this to my 4 and 2 yr olds.  This is one those films I won't show over and over.
B00009MGQL|1.0|This should be five stars, Amazon won't let me<br />correct the mistake. Oh well, I'm sure Jeff will<br />get over it.<br /> If you are reading this you already know about<br />Jeff Beck. So what can I tell you? You already<br />know that he's the guitar player's guitarist. He<br />was Frank Zappa's favorite as well as hero to just<br />about anyone who played a six-string for more than<br />a few years. Although Eddie Van Halen has single<br />moments of pure guitar ecstasy, Jeff can continue<br />for the length of an entire set! One guy who comes<br />the closest to Beck is probably Joe Satriani. Of<br />course classical/flamenco guitarists such as<br />Armik can technically outperform Jeff. But Jeff<br />gets the most feeling out of each note.<br /> The first I heard of Jeff Beck was on \\"Over Under<br />Sideways Down\\" by the Yardbirds. It drifted out of<br />a car radio passing by in Detroit. The weird-<br />sounding violin was actually a Telecaster played<br />by the wizard himself. Of course that tune and<br />\\"Shapes of Things\\" were immense hits back in the<br />days of yore. Check out the CD \\"Roger the Engineer\\"<br />for \\"over ...\\" and \\"Jeff's Boogie,\\" a favorite of<br />Joe Walsh.<br /> After the Yardbirds, Jeff had his following and<br />you never again heard him on the radio, except for<br />the occaisional \\"Beck's Bolero,\\" or \\"El Becko.\\"<br />He seemed to peak with the George Martin produced<br />album \\"Wired\\" in the mid 70s. \\"Flash\\" was not very<br />well-received nor was \\"Guitar Shop.\\" He started to<br />get back on his feet with the help of Jennifer<br />Batten on \\"Who Else\\" and \\"You had it coming.\\"<br /> Now he got together with Dean Garcia the master<br />MIDI programmer of Curve and it's Jeff all the<br />way to the finish line!<br /><br />So what: Guitar samples put together with driving<br />tribal beat. Jeff plays slide guitar and gets some<br />tone that almost makes the guitar squeal with<br />pleasure. Good editing of samples.<br /><br />Plan B: Again with Jeff playing a George Harrison<br />slide style guitar theme (except he's now using<br />some type of ring modulator to get wild sonic<br />textures of single and double-stopped notes). How<br />he gets some of these sounds is amazing. I can<br />detect an overdrive unit and wah-wah pedal as well<br />as the ring modulator. What can you hear?<br /><br />Pork-u-pine: Heavy stomping on the bass and drums.<br />\\"If the boys don't say it, the guitar will play it\\"<br />Voice-box guitar work similar to \\"Full moon boogie.\\"<br />Harmonics, heavy compression, controlled feedback,<br />and who knows what else. Too intense for Clear<br />channel (too bad)!<br /><br />Seasons: Mood piece. Middle part is atmospheric<br />with the most soulful guitar riffs that I have<br />ever heard. Good use of volume knob or volume<br />pedal (I think knob, because he's fast enough<br />to do this--that's why he's known as the Flash)<br />to fade-in notes. Vocal a little trite, but if<br />you listen to the guitar you don't care.<br /><br />Trouble man: Starts out with simulated guitar<br />throwing up. Jeff likes digestive sick-well<br />sounds, always has -- a personal quirk. Ring mod<br />makes another appearance. Holds out sustaining<br />notes forever--refuse (note refuses to quit).<br /><br />Grease monkey: Again with the ring mod. Another<br />trite vocal -- well, you can't say this is an<br />instrumental album. \\"Make it dirty, grease monkey.\\"<br />Lead solo is pure Ted Nugent, only with 100 times<br />better taste. Killer drum breaks.<br /><br />Hot rod honeymoon: Quirky combination of Nashville<br />slide guitar work (listen to Jeff's boogie for<br />another Nashville style work) and Beach Boy harmony<br />provided by the \\"Beeched Boys.\\" What a set of<br />wheels.<br /><br />Line dancing with monkeys: Sampled guitar sounds<br />combined with blues riffs (using a vox box?) Very<br />lyrical guitar sounds.<br /><br />JB's blues: Jeff jams along with a sequenced track.<br/>Instrument type ballad--the guitar sings! Almost a<br />Santana style lead, only electronic.<br /><br />Pay me no mind: Jeff makes rude sounds with the<br />guitar to a slow house beat.<br /><br />My thing: Annoying sampled vocal, but the guitar<br />sounds great. Why does he bother with vocalists?<br />\\"Don't mess with me, yeah, what you looking at?\\"<br />Funk guitar break then into another Nugent lead.<br /><br />Bulgaria: Another lyrical ballad. This time Jeff<br />plays slide guitar with the London Session<br />Orchestra. Nice. By the way, try to listen to a<br />recording of Bulgarian bagpipes--a really wild<br />sound.<br /><br />Why lord oh why?: Another piece with Tony Hymas<br />and the London Session Orchestra. Written by Tony.<br />Nice mood piece -- atmospheric and orchestral.<br />Thank you Jeff for \\"Jeff\\"!<br /><br /> The most lyrical guitar work from Beck that I<br />have ever heard.

B00005RY7X|4.0|To the guy that said this is Jello Biafra's worst nightmare, I'm putting this in my CD collection right next to Become The Media. What do you have to say about that?<br />Anyways, Its a nice break from most of the more serious music I listen too. Basically Andrew WK is doing what he wants, and he does a good job at it.
B00008DDSC|3.0|\\" Secretary \\" is actually a film about ' finding your other half ' and about how ' love overcomes every obstacle ' although it does feel a little bit weird saying that . The story of Lee who finds shelter from her self-traumatising obsessions in Edward's passion for humiliation is a rather kinky yet surely memorable movie offering . Maggie Gyllenhaal gives a brave , powerfull perfomance in her first leading role and without wanting to underrate Spader's fine work , the film basically rests on her shoulders . Although it's a little too-much to actually call this ' my favourite movie ' since it's quitte difficult to directly connect with the heroes , \\" Secretary \\" manages to makes us understand them and that alone is truly a triumph . Joy Division's \\" Love Will Tear Us Apart \\" wouldn't make it to it's soundtrack but The Divinyls \\" Sex Will Keep Us Together \\" would have been an option to consider .
B00005JLEU|5.0|For many years, Hayao Miyazaki has been regarded throughout the world as a visionary on par with Walt Disney. It is rather ironic that his presence in North America consists of a devoted cult following because his films have barely been shown here because of Disney. The studio has the distribution rights to all of Miyazaki's films on this continent and has sat on them for years or released them direct to video with little to no fanfare. This changed with Princess Mononoke which generated such a critical buzz that Disney ended up releasing it in a few theatres.<br />It paved the way for Miyazaki's next effort, Spirited Away, which is the most successful film in Japanese history (it grossed over $200 million before it was shown in North America!). Despite Pixar's John Lasseter championing the film, Disney still gave it a limited theatrical release (compared to their own titles) here in North America. This made its surprise win at the 2002 Academy Awards for Best Animated Film all the more of an upset. Now, Spirited Away is out on DVD on a two-disc set.<br />From the haunting image of a riverboat full of lights that drifts along the water at night to the amusing sight of little balls of soot dancing along the floor and carrying tiny lumps of coal, Spirited Away is full of images that are as stunning as anything this side of Disney. Characters flying gracefully through the air is but one of the many flights of fancy that populates Miyazaki's movie. It is this sense of wonderment and the feeling of experiencing a waking dream that recalls the original Fantasia.<br />One of the most refreshing aspects about Spirited Away is its to appeal to people of all ages. It stresses character and story over merchandising, which is such a novel concept in this day and age. One really gets the feeling that this movie was made by a true artist who has something personal to say.<br />Aside from the movie itself, the first disc also contains a superficial featurette entitled, &quot;The Art of Spirited Away.&quot; John Lasseter and some of the American voice actors are interviewed and praise Miyazaki, however too much emphasis is placed on the English translation and not enough is spent examining the film.<br />Disc two begins with &quot;Behind the Microphone,&quot; a featurette on the American actors who provided the voices for the dubbed version of Spirited Away. This extra feels like Disney is patting itself on the back a little too much. &quot;Select Storyboard-to-Scene Comparison&quot; takes a few scenes and allows the viewer to go back forth from the storyboards to the final product. While this is a nice feature you cannot have both on screen at the same time for a true comparison. The strongest supplement is &quot;Nippon Television Special,&quot; a fascinating look at Miyazaki and his crew making Spirited Away. It clocks in at 40 minutes and almost makes up for the superficiality of the other extras.<br />The extras on these DVDs are obviously targeted towards newcomers to Miyazaki's world. This is fine but in the process, Disney is alienating his more devote fans. However, the stunning transfer and the option to enjoy the movie in its original Japanese with English subtitles, more than makes up for the lack of substantial supplemental material. This movie is required viewing not just for fans of animation but for film buffs in general. Spirited Away is an important film that is destined to be regarded as a classic in years to come.Art of Spirited Away.&quot; John Lasseter and some of the American voice actors are interviewed and praise Miyazaki, however too much emphasis is placed on the English translation and not enough is spent examining the film.<br />Disc two begins with &quot;Behind the Microphone,&quot; a featurette on the American actors who provided the voices for the dubbed version of Spirited Away.

B0000BYM3K|3.0|Maiden's 2000 return, Brave New World, impressed me more than I could have predicted--I honestly think it's the single strongest album Maiden has ever done, in all areas (smart songs [with one exception], great sound production, outstanding musicianship, inspired vocals).  I was, therefore, awaiting Dance of Death with no small amount of anticipation.<br />I had to make a 2-hour car trip the other day, and I thought that would be the perfect time to give an initial listen to Dance of Death, so I hit the road, popped the CD into the player, and prepared myself for a treat--and, for three songs, I thought I would get it.  \\"Wildest Dreams\\" sounded *much* better than it did on the Maiden website, \\"Rainmaker\\" was powerful yet melodic enough that it could have been on Brave New World, and \\"No More Lies\\" was solid.<br />On the majority of the remaining songs, however, things just don't come together.  Bruce's vocals often are pushing at the top end of his range and come off sounding strained and rather off-key.  Further, some of the songs themselves are just not terribly good, lacking memorable riffs or catchy hooks (\\"Face in the Sand\\" and \\"Dance of Death,\\" particularly, leap to mind) yet droning on and on and on (several flirt with or exceed the eight-minute mark, which is a good thing when the songs are good, but when they're not...).<br />The news isn't all bad, of course.  \\"Montsegur\\" and \\"Paschendale,\\" for example, are pleasantly reminiscent of 80's Maiden, and the musicianship is as tight as ever.  And it's certainly possible that I'll grow to appreciate this album more with repeated listenings.  But my first reaction was one of serious disappointment, and I suspect that this is an album for hardcore Maiden fans only.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I could not wait for &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; to be released. It took what...3 years?. But after hearing &quot;Mer de Noms&quot; for the 1st time i was blown away by the beauty and art that came with it.<BR>So 3 years later, came their softmore album, Which indeed comes with, Jeordie Orsborne White (Twiggy Ramirez from Marilyn Manson), replacing our loving and missed bassist, Paz Lenchantin (who left APC for another band with lead vocals Billy Corgan (who is also from &quot;Smashing Pumpkins&quot; as you all know), called &quot;zwan&quot; <BR>And another new member which as joined the band after the recording of &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; James Iha (guitarist from &quot;Smashing Pumpkins&quot;.<BR>Let me just say after the 1st time listening to this cd..it is the best cd in my collection of &quot;art&quot; i have ever heard.<BR>It tells me that music in itself is evolving.
B00005JKN9|1.0|What a pathetic excuse for a film.  Scorcese has re-written history to provide a story that cannot merely be described as unauthentic but purely fictional.  Yet usually fiction provides some kind of entertainment value while this is so painfully dull I could scarcely sit through it.<br />Oh.  And how about of religious intolerance thrown in for good measure?  The Irish Catholics are depicted as a fun-loving, faith-filled group of enthusiasts who support treat African Americans as their brothers and allow women to play major roles in their uprising.  Protestants are, of course!, a bunch of intolerant back-stabbers (literally) whose demise we are supposed to applaud.<br />Scorcese: spend your dotage sunning in Palm Beach.  If this is the best you can do in your old age, take up golf!
B00008NG5V|5.0|I like this one much better than 'Brushfire Fairytales'.  The songs sound more 'evolved' and 'accessible'.  Jack has won over many more fans with this one.  My other two favorite artists who deserve mention are Steven Delopoulos and Jason Mraz.  Both these guys are phenomenal.  Check out 'Me Died Blue', the current release from Steven.  It is one of the most heartfelt and musically talented acoustic singer/songwriter masterpieces ever created!
B000002IU9|5.0|One man's meat is another's poison.<BR>That's the only reason I can think of to justify the (thankfully few) bad reviews this album had. The vocals are divine. The drums are *not* electronic, but raw puissance. I know. I've seen them. The bass is punished by one of the most talented men in the industry. The guitars are wild. The Triumph of Steel is pure epic; not your average metal fare, that's for sure.
B00005YW4H|5.0|This is a great CD.  The songs are gorgeous, and Norah's abilities belie her young age of 22!  My other favorite artist is Steven Delopoulos ([...]  He is an amazing acoustic guitarist/singer/songwriter that transports you to a relaxing atmosphere!  Kind of like what Norah does, but on guitar.
0920668372|5.0|My daughter along with her Playcentre friends choose this book all the time to be read to them.  Their ages range from 2 - 5 years.  I also remember my own Mum who passed away ten years ago and reading this book always brings a tear to my eyes. For as long as I live my Mother she will be.
B00005JLTN|5.0|This movie is flawless. It attaches the spectator to the seat with it's mind-blowing scenes and incredible fights. All the caracters are incredibly charismatic. The script is a work of art and the direction is too! The performance of Hugo Weaving as Agent Smith is even better in this movie than in The Matrix. I honestly don't know what else to say, you just watch it and then you'll see. No one who buys this movie will regret it.
B000099T2L|2.0|Wow! if there is any way that I can describe this album to you is, the first 5 tracks are good!, the rest it's just boring!, and what about the title song! the same track from her Survivor album? without the background vocals? not a smart move!.  Crazy In LOve, Baby Boy are the best tracks!, Naughty Girl it's ok!, the rest of the album is sooooooo booooooooring......but the leading single(Crazy...) makes its worth it to buy it. &quot;Hip Hop Star&quot; it's nice, &quot;Be With You&quot; it's the last song that you can handle!, &quot;Me Myself and I&quot;, yuk!, &quot;Yes&quot; whassup with this?, &quot;Signs&quot;, I'm sure Missy hates her, she produce the worst song ever, The rest it's not worth it mention it, the song are just boooooooring.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Many people seem to have the same ideas about this album, and the biggest one to pay attention to it the one about it growing on you. When I first popped this cd into my cd player at midnight in the parking lot of Wal-Mart just minutes after it went on sale, I was not prepared for what I was about to hear. After the first listen through, I was impressed, amazed and surprised. It has everything you could expect from Maynard and company, and the surprise element of the fact that it is nothing like I expected as far as the tone of the album is concerned. The songs are slower than Mar De Noms, and many are much longer (The Package starts off the album with more than 7 minutes). With Thirteenth Step, Maynards vocals are much different from what you would typically expect from him. I would definately recommend this album to everyone, especially those who were fond of Mer De Noms' &quot;3 Libras&quot; because there are many songs with the same mentality and a similar sound. But don't fret, there are still the classic &quot;harder&quot; moments in the album which really help make this an extremely well rounded album that gets better each and every time that you listen to it. Every song is good, even the 2 so-called &quot;fillers&quot; of the album are cool and well-worth listening to, it helps set the mood at the cd comes to a close. This is the best rock release, wait, let me rephrase, this is the album of the year as far as I am concerned, I sure can't imagine anything this good coming out this year, or even next for that matter.
B000001ED1|5.0|When I First saw &quot;One Of Us&quot; on vh1, I was blown away!,... I believe this song is not against God(I truly believe in God and all his glory), I feel that &quot;One Of Us&quot;, describes the amazing loneliness sometimes the human being feels in this stress out world, One Of Us is a deeply soulsearching song, with great lyrics, great music. Only for this single, the album is worth buying, but the rest of the album has great moments, like &quot;St. Teresa&quot;, &quot;Ladder&quot;, &quot;Lumina&quot;, &quot;Crazy Baby&quot;, and one of my personal favorites &quot;Let's Just Get Naked&quot;, Joan aproaches that song like she really wants it badly!, &quot;Right Hand Man&quot; it's totally rock roots!, great album, I miss this kind of good music in the record industry this days!, well &quot;0304&quot; by Jewel is one of the few that are OK!
B00009V7T2|5.0|The only way that I can possibly (but remotely) begin to understand how anyone could think even for a second that this sounded anything like Rush is quite simply those reviewers must have a very narrow basis of comparison. There are many other bands that I can think of that I could describe a combination of to describe what Mars Volta sounds like. Using the analogy of Rush is quite frankly ignorant. I strongly urge those music listeners to branch out. CD's are cheap and there are many sources to hear new and quality music out there. Get it! Beyond that, I highly recommend this album. And as predictable a statement this may be,  buy it especially if you are an At the Drive-in fan.
B000003TAR|5.0|An aquired taste helps alot when listening to this album. Geffen Records claimed before it's release that it was \\"Unlistenable to.\\" The hard thrashes, the torturous screams, the heavy metal guitar sound, the vicious riffs and lyrics jump out at you like a bloody knife.<BR>God, I love it.<BR>Listen to it once, you'll hate it.<BR>Listen to it twice, it's okay.<BR>Listen to it three times, I guarantee, you'll love it.<br />1. Serve The Servants<BR>[Written by Kurt Cobain]<BR>This song has one of the best guitar riffs Cobain has ever come up with. The lyrics of this song are also excelently written. \\"Teenage angst has paid off well, now I'm bored and old.\\" This song is Cobain and Nirvana's autobiography. \\"I tried hard to have a father, but instead I have a dad. I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore\\" refering to his rocky relationship with his father. An excelent song to kick off In Utero.<br />2. Scentless Apprentice<BR>[Written by Kurt Cobain, David Grohl, and Krist Novoselic]<BR>The only song on In Utero where the whole band actually sat down and each one of them contributed to the song writing process. This song describes the novel \\"Perfume\\" by Patrick Süskind.<br />3. Heart-Shaped Box<BR>[Written by Kurt Cobain]<BR>God, you could write a book on this song!!! Back in the long idle period right after Nevermind came out, Kurt Cobain and his new wife, Courtney Love, they lived in an apartment with a large walk-in closet, where much of Cobain's writing was done. Before Kurt and Courtney were married, Courtney sent Kurt many heart-shaped boxes full of weird stuff. Hence, the writing of Heart-Shaped Box took shape. There are many many other details surrounding this song, but you can do more reasearch online if youre interested.<br />4. Rape Me<BR>[Written by Kurt Cobain]<BR>There are two defenitions to this song.<BR>One is right, and one is there for people you want to morally justify this song to. Like, say, you're parents or grandparents, or whoever youwant to convince this isn't a controvercial song.<BR>1. The real defenition of the song, is Kurt is playing the roll of a woman getting rapped. Kurt was a very firm believer in Karma. Whatever you do to me, you're gonna get it 10 times worse. So rape me, do it again, just rape me, get it over with...yours is comming!<BR>2. The parent-friendly version is that \\"rape me\\" is a metephore, symbolizing the press bashing his name, spreading rumors. So, he says rape me, he means it in a metephoric sense.<br />5. Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle<BR>[Written by Kurt Cobain]<BR>This is an exclent example of the \\"Unlistenable to\\" phrase that Geffen used to describe In Utero. Along with Milk It and Tourettes, and a few others, this is a very rough listen, but it is an excelent song. Frances Farmer was an actress in the early 20th century. She went insane and had to be labotomized. Cobain was fascinated with the whole story.<br />6. Dumb<BR>[Written by Kurt Cobain]<BR>This is an EXCELENT example of Cobain song-writing ability. This song is filled with drug references such as \\"My heart is broke, I have some glue, help me inhale, and mend it with you\\" And, the song has a certain relaxation feel to it. It's very soothing and easy to listen to.<BR>The overall idea of the song is there's a certain bliss in being dumb. A feeling of no worries.<br />7. Very Ape<BR>[Written by Kurt Cobain]<BR>Read the lyrics to the song, and know this.<BR>Kurt HATED macho men.<BR>He hated them with passion.<BR>This song has a great sound and beat to it.<BR>5 seconds into the song, and you're hooked on it.<br />8. Milk It<BR>[Written by Kurt Cobain]<BR>Perhaps the most unlistenable to song on the record, yet in my opinion, certainly one of the best. With direct referances to suicide, many people, mostly mothers do NOT like this song. It's got an excelent guitar riff, and excelent lyrics.<br />9. Pennyroyal Tea<BR>[Written by Kurt Cobain]<BR>Perhapse one of Nirvana's oldest songs, PennyroyalTea was written even before Nevermind came out when Kurt was living in an apartment with Dave Grohl. Pennyroyal is a naturally abortive substance. The theme of this song is not only the hard choices that come with abortion, but also the idea of other hard choices we have to make in life.<br />10. Radio Friendly Unit Shifter<BR>[Written By Kurt Cobain]<BR>This song starts off with a rather annoying guitar distortion effect. The theme of this song is the harsh popularity the band recieved from songs such as Smells Like Teen Spirit and Come As You Are.<br />11. Tourettes<BR>[Written by Kurt Cobain]<BR>The shortest track on In Utero, yet most possibly the loudest and most annoying. Tourettes Syndrome is a disease that causes one to yell out foul words at any time.<br />12. All Apologies<BR>[Written by Kurt Cobain]<BR>A truly beautiful song.<BR>And, something that parents don't like!<BR>The word \\"gay!\\"<BR>This song was Kurts way of making amends with everybody, apologizing for everything he's done.<BR>Now, if you want to avoid trouble with your parents, or whoever, tell them that it's a metephore. Tell them the truth. That Kurt Cobain was often depressed, plauged with servere stomach pains. What he means is he's terribly depressed, yet everyone around him is \\"gay\\" meaning happy. see? Easy squeezy.<br />I call In Utero the \\"Shakespear of Grunge\\"<BR>Buy it and see for yourself.<BR>You will not regret it.
B0000AQS0F|2.0|Darn, I was just about to pre-order this when I saw that FOX has chosen to release this in Pan and Scan, full screen. Yuck ! That sucks big time. I'll wait till they do the right thing by fans and release it in WIDESCREEN. I have been following this series on the internet for some time hoping that it may be released over here, the DVD news promised great things but now I feel I've been short changed. I would give 5 stars for widescreen, but this shabby treatment from Fox deserves only 2.
B0000089GM|5.0|This is a great album of theirs. Its definitely better than &quot;Herzeleid&quot; but that one has good songs on it too. If you get this also get &quot;Mutter&quot; because that has some killer songs on it. I recomment it 100%.<BR> <BR>By the way, for the people arguing whether its &quot;You Hate&quot; or &quot;You Have&quot;, the answer is both. In the REAL german version &quot;You have&quot; makes sense while in Rammstein's translated song &quot;You hate&quot; also makes sense. Here's how:<br />in German, it says: <BR>&quot;Du hast mich gefragt, Und ich hab nichts gesagt&quot; <BR>meaning &quot;You have asked me, and I have not answered&quot;. The words &quot;you hate&quot; substituted for &quot;you have&quot; would not have made the least sense here.<br />Their official translation is: <BR>&quot;You hate me to say, but I did not obey&quot; <br />I think the point they are trying to get across in english is something along the lines of &quot;you want me to answer, but I wont so you hate me because of that.&quot; So I guess that proves that the real version says &quot;You Have.&quot; Rammstein's own english translation to &quot;You hate&quot; also makes sense because the context its used in. Hope that helps!
B000002H97|5.0|One of the best CD ever!!!!!!!!!!!
0385512104|3.0|After reading so many superlatives about this novel, I have to admit to being disappointed once I finished it.  It isn't a bad work at all, but I didn't find it to be the superior work of fiction I had been led to expect.  Yes, he pulls off the voice of an autistic main character and remains pretty consistent in doing so, but since the voice itself is basically a reporter's voice, free of emotion and introspection and evaluation, I'm not quite sure why this is considered such a feat.  And besides, I'd seen it done as well decades earlier in Flowers for Algernon.  The plot is slim: the main character decides to investigate the death of the neighbor's dog and in so doing learns some shocking (to him, but not I would say to the reader) truths about his family and eventually takes an \\"epic\\" (again, more to him than the reader I would say) journey.  As I mentioned, there isn't much to the plot that surprises, though it is mildly interesting and manages to keep the character before us in varying degrees of distress and tension.  Unfortunately, those varying degrees include going over the top once or twice toward the end, where characters sacrifice real person behavior in service of plot movement.  The main character himself is nicely fleshed out despite the lack of introspection and the objective voice; the author isn't afraid to have him be unlikable at times.  The father is probably the other best realized character, though he fades out a bit just when I would have liked to have seen more of him.  The mother I thought was too sketchily and easily drawn, and what should have been some complex changes in her character are skimmed over far too glibly.  What works best is the contrast between that steady objective voice and the descriptions of what other characters are saying or doing.  Since, however, the author sometimes plays this hand too much or too obviously, it's a good thing the book is as slim as it is.  As it is, because so much of the weakness of the book lies inits last quarter or so, the overall reading experience is colored more negatively than the work probably deserves.  If you can finish it in a sitting (pretty easy to do), it holds up better than if you spread it over a few days, since you'll find your last few nights' reading inferior writing in comparison to the first few.
B00008NRI9|3.0|Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant were great in this movie taking every oppurtunity to make it funny. However, the script was pretty bad. I think there could of been some more humor in it around the middle to keep everyones attention. It got a bit boring and then picked up. This really deserved a 3.5<br />Overall: Give it a chance and give it a watch.
0393057658|5.0|The importance of not making an out in any particular half inning of offensive baseball comes though load and clear and the ways to do this to get on base and keep the inning alive raises all kinds of questions about the conventional wisdom of the last 125 years until the Billy Beane Oakland Athletics era!  The personalities of the managers, coaches, staff and players to carry out blue collar lunch box play by staying close to a discipline that favors the team and winning over personal/agent negotiated stats creates a dynamics of tension that causes those on the outside to second and third guess.  When luck is evened out over a 162 game season the faithfulness is justified with results.  Now for with a hopefully soon to be realized winning post season playoffs and world series victory, the exclamation point will be placed on the statement for all to see.  Changes are coming thoughout baseball even down to the Little Leagues!
B000084T18|4.0|50 cent came close to a 5/5 but I think the media is way too hyped about this product. Its not the best but its not the worst. If you like beats to get you groovin' or whatever this is the CD for you. However, I didn't like the language but its still better then Eminems. <br />Overall: great album if your into rap. Buy it.

B000066NW0|2.0|I have read reviews on this CD here, and also heard some opinions from people in real life. I have to agree that I do not like Avril Lavigne, she is a poser, and she cant sing live. But some people have to like her to have sold so many CD'S. Right? Or maybe people just buy her CD and realize its garbage I don't know. I guess I wouldn't buy this CD some songs are catchy like &quot;Complicated&quot; (possibly the best song on the CD) which made me want this CD a little while back but luckily my friend got it and we  listened to it, I was disgusted. Some songs were brilliant others were bad. Miss Avril Lavigne is NOT going to go far in the music world - she has hardly any talent, shes a poser (possibly more fake then Britney Spears) and she should lend her songs to someone who CAN sing. <br />Overall: The CD'S not too bad. The songs are OK. But Avril spoils it all.

B00005JM02|5.0|This movie rocks the boat! It was the best movie since Scream1,2,3 it had humor, emotion and feelings. It is a movie for the whole family! I would reccomned it to everybody that enjoys emotion and humor. I hope everybody gets a chance to watch it. It really puts emotion into prespective! It is the most fun I ever had at the movies!  IT ROCKS!!!
0385504209|3.0|I read this book in one day and agree that it moves quickly and is enjoyable, even if the writing style is awful.  Having been raised Catholic, I thought Brown's central message about how the Church needs to reform is sound, and a welcome message, even if his plot stretches the barriers of belief a bit much.  Other books I would recommend for those interested in doing further research are: The Gnostic Gospels &  Adam, Eve and the Serpent, both by Elaine Pagels, and any book by the German theologian Uta Ranke-Heinemann, particularly Eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven: Women, Sexuality, and the Catholic Church.

B000003CMB|5.0|Allman Brothers fans, blues fans, guitar players, human beings.  This is THE greatest album of all time.  There are no questions, comments or second thoughts.  There is no other album as perfect as this one.  They should issue this in every single music class for children starting from 1st grade and up.  This is what dreams are made of.  If you have ever had any notion of picking up a guitar, or even listening to a compact disc, this should be the one you judge everything else to.  This is the most brilliant compilation known to man.  If someone told me this CD was $100 or even more, I would still have to own it.  For those of you out there who are even considering reading a recommendation to buy CD's, this is the only CD you could possibly need to complete any collection.  And for those of you who own this, you surely know how valuable a piece of music this is.  It hardly seems fair paying so little for a masterpiece such as this.  As much as \\"Gone with the Wind\\" is possibly the greatest piece of film ever made, this CD blows it away in terms of perfection.  If only a video had been taken of this!!  Anyways, if you've gotten this far down the line of this recommendation, do yourself a favor and click \\"buy it now\\" you will not be disappointed.  I still get goosebumps from something 30 years old.  That kind of feeling should be shared with all.  Duane Allman is undisputedly the best recorded guitarist of all time.  Thank you Duane, Gregg, Dickey, Berry, Jaimoe and Butch.  <BR>ps. \\"Eat a Peach\\" ain't bad either.....
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Before I wrote this review I listened to Mer de Noms 1st then 13th step.  The main difference was the drum work.  The drumming was better on Mer de Noms, just a lot more aggressive.  The work by Maynard was different too.  Even though they say this album is more emotional Maynard moves away from the soft vocals and deeply emotional yelling like in Orestes, 3 libras, Thomas, and The Hollow. He instead tends to go harder on his vocals almost to what he sounds like in Tool.  The most emotional songs are The noose and A stranger and they still aren't even close to being as soft as 3 libras.  <BR>But this album has it's own beauty and strengths.  It's hard to explain, it's sounds more mature but it just isn't.     <BR>1. The Package: 3 out of 5- Reason being I listen to this cd mostly in my car that has a system in it.  When I listened to this song with the system it sucked, a lot.  Well before I wrote this review I used my headphones and it was night and day, so much better. My suggestion is listen to this song w/out bumping it =p.<BR>2.  Weak and Powerless: 4 out of 5- I'm being generous.  This is their 1st single and I thought it was decent but disappointing, it is growing on me so I'll figure in time I'll give it a 4.<BR>3-7.  The Noose, Blue, Vanishing, A stranger, The Outsider: 5 out of 5- These songs are beautiful!  The noose is amazing.  A great balance of different instruments and sounds.  Easily one of my favorites.  You'll fall in love with it when you listen to it for the first time no matter what your musical tastes are, I promise you.  Blue has great guitar work and a catchy dark, goth chorus.  Vanishing is a filler but a good one, gives Josh the freedom to go nuts on the drums and maynard gets to use his ghostly whispers.  A stranger is musically brilliant, good acoustic, lead vocals and backup, violen(sounds like), and an irish instrument.  This is probably one of the most emotional tracks on the album.  Fit to be their 2nd single(even though I'd rather see Pet as the next one).  The Outsider is pretty hard for this album.  Sounds like something Tool would come out with.  Heavy riffs, low growls, loud drums, not dark like the rest of the album though.<BR>Crimes- 1 out of 5- Filler track.  Surprised usually an all-star team could make mainly intrumental fillers good.  This one sucked.  <BR>The Nurse Who Loved Me- 2 out of 5-  It's a good song but it just doesn't fit, at all.  Couldn't they used this as a B-sides somewhere else?  Rumor has it the original is better too.<BR>Pet- 5 out of 5-What did you expect?  Most people agree that this is the best song on the album and the hardest.  Haunting lyrics are great, great guitar work makes this song what it is.  &quot;Head down, go to sleep. To the rhythm of the war drums.&quot;  Nice. <BR>Lullaby- 4 out of 5- With my system the beginning is awesome with my headphones this song is alright at best.  Listen to this song loud.  Jarboe sings this, whoever that is...some chick I think.<BR>Gravity-3 out of 5- I believe this was the 1st track recorded for their new album.  It is decent.  After Pet it just goes downhill.  This is just a normal rock track.
B000002GYI|5.0|I had been meaning to buy a Kraftwerk album for a while, but only got around to it last night... and this album is the one I purchased... I have known about these guys for years, but never really considered them seriously until this past year or so... I still remember one day in high school when a friend of mine came in to school singing Pocket Calculator... I could not take it seriously, and we both had many a good laugh at these guys... they seemed so silly... then a year or so later I saw them mentioned in a History of Rock and Roll special, and it showed brief footage of them playing their music... they didn't seem so silly there... then a little bit after that I had read the book U2 at the End of the World, and in it Bono mentions them a few times... hmmm, I'm seeing these guys a lot... in the last few years I've been getting into more modern electronic music like Aphex Twin, Autechre, etc, and I kept coming across these guys again... they were highly respected... so I figured I'd check them out... and man, this album rules!! I bought it last night, and already listened to it over and over... I've just let it repeat... the songs sound very minimal at first, and I guess they are, but as you listen more and more you catch all these subtle little changes, and it's really quite impressive... especially given that this album is from 1981, and that they had released a bunch of other electronic albums before this... I can listen to this album and hear Orbital, Aphex Twin, etc... these guys started the whole thing, and now I have respect for them... the genius isn't in their words, but the music... and it really does stand the test of time... it's 2003, 22 years after this was released, and I can't stop listening to it... the synth sounds are so full and lush, they just cover you up... and the melodies are intricate, and seem to blend so well, but if you listen closely you can hear the different notes... <br />I love this already, and know I will be listening to this for years to come... my favorite tracks are Computer World, Computer Love, and It's More Fun to Compute!
0380789019|4.0|I love Neil Gaiman. The guy's mind is just incredible; from all the Sandman related stuff to this, he's a writer with a killer imagination. <br /> So why did I say, not good enough to read over and over?<br /> I'd like to think that Neil Gaiman will turn out to become the Ray Bradbury for this generation, who didn't grow up reading his stuff, but all of us should own a copy of, Something Wicked This Way Comes. That book, right there, by Bradbury, can be read over and over again, and you never get tired of it. Also can be said of everything Tolkien has written. That's what great fantasy writers do, in my opinion: write the books you can read once every six months for the rest of your life. <br /> Now with, Neverwhere: killer plot, characters, beginning, ending, and all the in betweens. I just didn't think it had that magical, storytelling quality, to be read again and again. By all means, get this and read it, without a doubt. Just don't expect it to earn a home on your bookshelf.<br /> 4 STAR RATING FROM SCRAGGY'S TOMB OF HORROR, USA.<BR>(I know this isn't considered a 'horror' novel: but hey, this is my handle, call signature, etc. on here!)
B0000AR8NK|3.0|I've come to realize that perhaps DB's greatest strength as a singer is his ability to wrap a melody and vocal line around just about anything. This could also be considered his Achilles Heel as well, though, because inevitably, the success or failure of an album is largely based on the type of music he chooses to accompany. <br />After Tin Machine, DB seemed to have a sort of musical reawakening, producing the woefully overlooked 'Back Tie' album with Nile Rogers, a real singers record, then moving on to the deeply weird 'Outside' with Brian Eno, which produced some of the best songs of DB's career and finally assembling a crack young band to burn through the Earthling album. Each of these records was distinctly different musically and pushed DB's vocal and melodic approach into different, but equally memorable territories. <br />Since then, to my ears, DB seems to have settled for a much mellower, more conventional musical tapestry. Both Heathen and this new album are very much sonic trips down memory lane. There are little catches and cues from every period of Bowies past career. 'Reality', in fact, almost sounds like 'Lodger', if that album were stripped of all it's adventurous musical weirdness. It's not bad music, it's just not terribly interesting either. <br />The 'Disco King' song is definitely the most interesting thing here and maybe that points to a new direction for Bowie and Visconti. Mutant jazz with a hint of Krautrock. It could be that DB has decided to simply settle into comfortable middle-age and has grown tired of looking for barriers to break down. I hope that's not the case though. I hope he can find time to lock himself into a room with Brian Eno at least one more time and see what comes of it. Until then, I guess this will have to do.
0670032506|5.0|David Allen's new book, Ready for Anything, is both a delightful read and an immensely practical tool for improving your personal productivity and enhancing your life. For those who have followed David's teachings and writings over the years, Ready for Anything is the \\"how to\\" and the logical follow-up to his best-selling first book, Getting Things Done: the Art of Stress-Free Productivity. For those unfamiliar with David's highly effective and unique philosophy, Ready for Anything contains 52 prescriptions for effectiveness in your professional and personal life. <br />Twenty years ago I was beginning a six-year stint as director of management development for a large Midwestern university. We added David's two-day workshop to our public seminar offerings and watched as he helped literally thousands of managers, professionals, and people from all walks of life improve their productivity, satisfaction, and success. In the two decades since then I have not only followed David's emergence as a noted thinker and coach in the personal growth and development field but as a catalyst for change, guide to leveraged performance, and builder of successful organizations of all types and sizes. I have used his philosophy personally and with clients with outstanding results. Simply put, David's approach to managing actions and projects works! <br />In the past two decades we have been blessed with a progression of thinkers, teachers, and authors who have helped transform the way in which we work and grow. From Abraham Maslow and Peter Drucker to Tom Peters, Peter Senge, Jim Collins, Noel Tichy, Brian Tracy, and Tony Robbins, the individual and organizational development landscape has been rich in resources. First with Getting Things Done and now in Ready for Anything, David Allen has taken his place among the major thought leaders and influencers of our time. <br />If you've read Getting Things Done you will find Ready for Anything to be a wonderful companion piece and road map to making his philosophy real in your daily life. If you haven't read his first book, read and implement the lessons in Ready for Anything for nuts-and-bolts jump-start for your daily life. Then, read Getting Things Done for the \\"bigger picture\\" view of what his approach is all about. Then, give one or both of these wonderful books to your colleagues, your employees, your boss, your friends, and your family. You, and the world in which you live, will be better for it.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|\\"A Quick One\\" is a long one.. At least it was meant to be (7:30 according to my LP).  This amusing mini-opera with it's thought-provoking lyrics about \\"Ivor The Engine Driver\\" made it one of the more memorable moments from the film (which was my introduction to The Who as a 15 year old at a suburban movie theater in 1979).  When I learned that portions of \\"A Quick One\\" were cut from the original VHS release of TKAA, I was extremely disappointed!  Now that it's being released as a special edition DVD,  I'm ecstatic.  \\"It's like a dream to be with you again\\"!  I don't know who to thank.. The Rolling Stones' (Rock 'n' Roll Circus), Pete Townshend, or a bunch of record & film honchos.  All I can say is \\"You Are Forgiven\\" and my new DVD copy of The Kid's are Alright will \\"Soon Be Home\\"!
0316666343|5.0|Sometimes I resist reading the books that seem too popular, the ones that appear on everyone's top ten list. So began my response to The Lovely Bones. Then one day in my English 370 class, a student recommended the book to me, saying she had not read a book in years, and from the moment she opened this one, she couldn't put it down. At one point, she continued, her mom came into her room to find her reading well past midnight, tears streaming down her face. After a review like this, how could I not read the book?<br />The Lovely Bones is the best book I have read in a long time. From the first page we are inside the narrator's head, watching through her eyes as the world goes on without her. Touching, horrifying, sad, hopeful--we experience all of these emotions and more as we navigate through the story from the perspective of a 14-year-old girl looking down from heaven. If you don't read any other book this year, read this one. Read it, and then go out and hug all those people who mean the world to you.

One of the five best Tull CDs for sure.  A wonderfully rustic sound, beautiful song craft and unparalleled musicianship make Heavy Horses a true standout.  Anyone with ears can hear that Heavy Horses is further evidence of Anderson's genius.
0385504209|5.0|Whatever you do, do not read the reviews that have stars of three or less. They were insulting the book for usually obscure, simple sentences that did not have any relation to the plot that might have been less than historically accurate. Dan Brown got all the IMPORTANT details right, which I have discovered in my research. Really, what does it matter if he mistakenly put that a stick- shift car has a park gear? Does it MATTER?? Most of the people claiming this book is &quot;sacrilegious&quot; and &quot;historically inaccurate&quot; are exactly the type of people who should not be reading books that actually want them to think and open their mind to other possibilities, besides what they have been forced to believe their entire lives which, while it is nice that they have a solid faith, should not blind them to other possibilities. This is one of the best books I have ever read, both for its fiction AND its fact. I can't stop thinking about it, and everything I have learned from it. We all are taught traditional Christian beliefs, but now I see the truth about that religion, and I hope soon more Christians will as well. For those who have not read it yet-- if you are close- minded, judgemental, and/or upset by truth, don't read it. But if you thirst for knowledge, truth, and the other side of history, then read this! You won't regret it.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|In the past few years, it has become a clich to classify a new Bowie album as his best since the epic Scary Monsters (1980). Fortunately, this time we cannot avoid such a clich. Reality sounds even better than Heathen, 1. Outside and Buddha of Suburbia (other remarkable albums of the artists  90s &amp; 00s production).<BR>Since the groundbreaking album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars (1972), Bowie has presented himself as a post-modern artist, someone who sees life as something chaotic without any sort of absolutes (truth, style, behavior, etc.). Influenced by the beatnik generation (notably William Burroughs), his ambiguous and not direct songwriting has been reflecting such attitude towards the changing world of ours.<BR>Reality works like a summary of Bowies ouvre. It is fragmented, polyphonic, hybrid, schizophrenic, plural in stylistic and artistic terms. The vocals, musical textures and songwriting vary from track to track. For instance, just before the after hours jazzy piece \\"Bring me the Disco King\\", we have the punky and breathtaking title track \\"Reality\\", that features the revealing lines \\" I still don't get the 'wherefores' and the 'whys'/I look for sense and I get next to nothing/Hey, boy, welcome to reality/Ha, ha, ha, ha\\". <BR>Together with the skilful producer Tony Visconti and a fantastic band, Bowie has created a 49 minutes rock record that works all the way through (including the two covers - the highly imaginative and multi-layered recreation of Modern Lovers \\"Pablo Picasso\\" and heartfelt rendition of George Harrisons gem \\"Try Some, Buy Some\\". <BR>All in all, there are no filler songs and no lame moments in Bowies essential Reality.
B000000OQF|5.0|Almost all the songs are this are practicaly solo's. Every track has ripping sounds that just blast through the whole CD.

0385512104|5.0|A librarian, from Frostburg, MD:<br />Perhaps the most amazing quality of fiction is its ability to put us into the heads of those who cannot - or never get a chance to - tell their own stories. THE CURIOUS INCIDENT OF THE DOG IN THE NIGHT-TIM is the story of an autistic teenager and his attempts to solve the mystery of a murdered neighborhood dog; but, of course, it's much more than that, too. Haddon is a subtle and sensitive writer, leaving it to us to draw the conclusions that Christopher can't. His precise and careful prose reveal just enough to keep us a step ahead of Christopher - and give us an ominous sense of dark relevations waiting in the wings - while retaining a suspenseful mood throughout the narrative. In the end, though, the only mystery here is one that's beyond Christopher's, or anyone's, power to solve: how people can be so brutal, violent, and cruel to each other in the name of love. <br />Also recommended: THE LOSERS' CLUB by Richard Perez

0385504209|2.0|This editors / publishers of this book should be ashamed of themselves.  The pointlessly long book is in drastic need of editing and the author should take a course in English composition so he can write chapters longer than 1 page and distance himself from the &quot;stunning&quot;, &quot;frozen&quot;, &quot;wrenching&quot; school of writing, a sure sign of laziness on the part of an author unable to forge his own style.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle reemerges this year to bring us their sophomore set. Ever since May of 2001, I have waited patiently for the follow up to 2000's amazing album Mer de Noms. I've downloaded as much APC as possible from the web. None of it was doing me any good. The chance even came up to download the entire second album prior to the release on September 16th. I chose to tough it out and wait for The Thirteenth Step. Well the waiting is over.<br /> The album opens up with \\"The Package,\\" a near eight minute opener that begins with simple, acoustic like flow. Maynard James Keenan (the leader singer) begins to sing with his beautiful voice, and welcomes us back to the Thirteenth Step. A little after the four minute mark, hard guitars come blasting in between a haunting whisper from Maynard saying \\"take what's mine.\\" A true eye opener to the CD. Mer de Noms was known for short songs, but \\"The Package\\" rounds out at 7:40, a rather long song to begin the CD out. However, APC does not lose the listener at all. With the first few notes of \\"The Package\\" I was drawn in and have not stopped listening to the CD.<br /> The first single is \\"Weak and Powerless.\\" When I first heard the song on the radio in late July, I noticed how different it seemed from the first APC album. The most notable thing about this song are the lyrics. The lyrics are very dynamic and deep. I enjoy listening to the song. A wise choice for first single. \\"The Noose\\" comes next. I think this is one of the top songs on the album. \\"With your halo, slipping down your neck to choke you.\\" - very intense lyrics. One undeniable factor of Maynard is his vocals. Very soft for this song, something many stereotypical listeners might not know about. \\"Blue\\" keeps the rhythm flowing. \\"Vanishing\\" uses a new technique for APC. Fading in and out with vocals is very nicely done on this track.<br /> \\"A Stranger,\\" \\"Outsider,\\" and \\"Crimes\\" all come in as being strong candidates for second single off the record. \\"The Nurse Who Loved Me\\" is actually a cover of the song originally performed by Failure. A very nice addition to the CD. \\"Pet\\" provides the only offensive lyrics for the entire disc. (sorry APC fans, no equivalent of \\"Judith\\" this time) The band raps it all up with \\"Lullaby\\" and \\"Gravity.\\"<br /> I strongly recommend this album to anyone. It definitely has a lot of potential. The real question is if its better than Mer de Noms. And I'll go out on a limb as saying that it is it much better than their first CD. A lot of heart was put into it this time. Not to say their previous record had no effort, it did. But I can't decide which one is better. In some aspects both are amazing. Very few flaws here, but a new style is hard to adjust to. I recommend this album to everyone. It may just be the CD you're looking for. Take the Thirteenth Step, its well worth it.<br />Also recommended: Tool: Aenima and Lateralus.e\\" is actually a cover of the song originally performed by Failure.

At the end of the novel, I think her idea of atoning her &quot;sin&quot; was just an old woman's way to balm her never-to-be-cleared conscious for what she did to her sister and friend. Briony's just a quarter-inch shy of evil and if she hadn't been so &quot;loved&quot; in the last pages of the book - which I think was a device McEwan used in an attempt to tone down what she caused to happen - we'd all have been audibly cheering her descent into dementia.<br />The book's first section was difficult to get through; Mr. McEwan got too wrapped up in his command of the English language to make it a good read. The second part was good but an unfair LIE to the reader. The third part made me wish I had never started reading it in the first place since I couldn't decide who I disliked more - Briony for ruining two people's lives and living to a ripe old age, or Mr. McEwan for writing &quot;Atonement.&quot; And I do think the book was mistitled - perhaps &quot;Atoning One's Sin by Rewriting History&quot; would have been better, but I guess that title doesn't have the same &quot;punch,&quot; does it?
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Wow..I can't stop listening to this CD. She is definitely back!! <BR>I've been listening to it for 3 days non-stop.  She took it back to the first album!!!  It's funky, it's soulful and she has some bangin beats!!!
B00006ZCFH|2.0|Erykah Badu is hands down one of the most influential &amp; talented artists of our generation, however her Worldwide Underground EP does very little if anything to reflect that. Maybe its such a disappointment because her previous works, Baduizm &amp; Mama's Gun, were both flawless 5 star efforts, but with weak &amp; in some cases incomplete songs, terrible promotion &amp; lackluster production, this record can be used as good evidence to the theories of Badu just releasing material in order to leave her contract with Motown Records. Anyway you look at it, this album is no where near Badu's potential.<br />The lead single &quot;Danger&quot; is a greatt track, however it's very different from her previous works, and it doesn't have that unique sound that other singles like &quot;On &amp; On&quot; &amp; &quot;Baglady&quot; had. In fact, when I first heard it on the radio, I thought it sounded very much like songs that others had already released. Besides the single, very few songs will keep you satisfied. &quot;Back in the Day&quot; (Puff) with Lenny Kravitz on guitar is very nice &amp; &quot;Love of my Life Worldwide&quot;, with Queen Latifah, Bahamadia &amp; Angie Stone is great, but unfortunatley thats it.<br />The album's worst track is probably &quot;Woo&quot;, which is very reminiscent of &quot;Shany's World&quot;, from Ashanti's sophomore album 'Chapter II'. Here, Badu thanks people she went on tour with, has a few laughs, and a pretty good time recording, but the problem is there is very little singing and when there is its annoying. &quot;Bump It&quot; is atrocious, it gets off to a nice start and has a nice beat, but the werid crooning at the end ruins it. &quot;I Want You&quot; is way to long, over extended garbage &amp; &quot;The Grind&quot; sounds as if it was an incomplete demo for some neo-soul newcomer.<br />Overall, to say I'm disappointed with this album is a complete understatement. I never thought the day would come when I spoke so lowly of Badu and I gave her a terrible review, but Erykah you deserved it. I just hope the next record  is as good as the first two or I may be downloading those. Very weak attempts, buy at your own risk.nd I gave her a terrible review, but Erykah you deserved it.

B000068TPN|1.0|Oh my god: is there a single battlefield / home-front cliche that is not hammily thrown into the mix of this atrociously simplistic portrayal of the early, and increasing US involvement in Vietnam in the wake of the French fiasco?<br /><br />Let's count a few. You have the leather-necked Gibson, heroically giving his best John Wayne, non-stop, without a single let-up, barely drawing breath between one OTT-tough mouthing off and another (probably setting a celluloid record for not appearing like a recognizable human being, let alone the soldier who wrote the original book). You have the air-cav soldier heroically dying after being caught in an ambush, smilingly gasping out in his heroic last words that \\"at least I got to die for my country!\\" You have the guy heroically throwing himself onto the grenade in order to heroically save his buddies. You have the cut-off squad, heroically waiting to be rescued by their heroic buddies, deep in enemy territory. You have the heroically gung-ho helicopter pilot with the stupid nickname who carries on and on heroically flying to save and supply the heroic guys on the ground. You have the heroic talk-over. You have the prayers and the speeches and the swelling music and the doe-eyed wives and fellow GIs and marines and whatever cheering on the boys as they nobly (and heroically) head off to battle to fight for their buddies and freedom...<br /><br />I could go on, while someone passes me another sick-back, but why bother. Suffice to say that this moronic movie declares itself at the beginning as a tribute to the men who fought and died on both sides of the conflict. Sorry, but it's not. It's a patronizing insult to their professionalism and sacrifice and about as stupid and narrow-mindedly jingoistic as \\"Pearl Harbor\\". It's unworthy of their memory.<br /><br />Enjoy the big bangs and the helicopters, people, just remember to fast-forward through the talkie-bits if you want to hold your dinner down, and do NOT regard this as anything truer than another step in Mel Gibson's self-advancement as the next John Wayne.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was one of my favorite sci-fi shows to ever air.<br />There, we've got that out of the way. The show itself had its flaws, no question. The standard romantic subplots were not only predictable, but sometimes horrifying to watch (Sean Maher's \\"Simon\\" talking to Jewel Staite's \\"Kaylee\\", for example). The tired Remington Steele-Scully/Mulder \\"In love but in denial\\" sequence has been played to death well before now, and took some more hits in this series.<BR>Ron Glass as Shephard Book was denied some decent lines, given some great ones, and often forced to play the relatively unconvincing role of one Who Brings Inappropriate Morality To The Forefront. It was grating, sometimes, to see such obviously weak characterization forced into play.<br />Those were some of its weaknesses, and they were glaring. But the show drew me in despite these flaws. The interactions between crew members, especially the moments of normal life, were compelling. This cast obviously enjoyed working together, and the writing for them was typical of Joss's style: realistic conversations between real people.<BR>First sci-fi show I've seen where ships in space make no sound. Gunshot wounds bleed, and continue bleeding. People (especially Malcolm Reynolds) make hard choices, and ethics in a hard life aren't as clear-cut as we've been told to believe.<BR>The surprising humor of this show, which was a mixture of great interactive writing and excellent deliveries from the cast, was a true treat to see.<br />Essentially, and I suppose I could have summarized it earlier, Firefly was truly a Space Western. Exploring the lives of gritty anti-heroes, nasty villians and hardships both personal and environmental in an action-packed way.<BR>It was NOT realistic. But it wasn't supposed to be. It was supposed to be a saga of anti-heroes, a couple of rebels, a treacherous lunk, two felons and a ship built for smuggling, and what they did in the worlds around them, both good and bad.<br />For what it was supposed to be, Firefly performed exceptionally well. Even my bride-to-be, who hates westerns, found herself involved in the show and wanting to see what happened next. That Firefly was given a bad air-time, weak advertising, inconsistent scheduling, and eventually cancelled, is not at all related to how well crafted the product was.<br />If you liked the Spaghetti Westerns, Batman (the movie) and/or Alien Resurrection, you'll want to see this show.<br />If you watched the series already, then I doubt anything will keep you from getting the set. ;)
B000088E6P|1.0|This album is not real &quot;hip-hop&quot; by no means. I can see why the airwaves if full of junk and hip hop is so polluted with fakers, and wannabes. I really do not care about if you got shot or sold drugs. Be real, be true, and come hard with the music. We need to get back to GangStarr, Outkast, Tribe, and real artists. This is a studio gangster effort and it shows. I was not impressed by this album at all.
B000069AUI|5.0|You never know what your getting yourself into when buying a coldplay cd. You feel privledged, as if your doing something illegal. This album is a peice of art. It belongs in a museum. After watching their video for the scientist i was mesmorized. How is anyone this brilliant? Coldplay is by far one of the greatest bands to date. Their soul-ful music and amazing talant will surly take them along way.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Maynard has always been a wordsmith.  Unfortunately for the world, his band Tool has remained in the fringes and does not receive the exposure that would lend its talent attention.  Maynard's lyrics delve deep into the psyche of man and with Tool he does so with the tact of a powertool created by Bob Vila...precise and intense.  With A Perfect Circle he still does the therapy, but its a subtle and endearing form that leaves the listener wanting more chair time with Dr. Phil.  The imagery he conjers up is vivid, crystal, and unlike anything you have heard.  On &quot;The Noose&quot;, he captures the descent of what you are lead to believe is an angel by continually saying that your &quot;halo slipping down...&quot;  And you believe it!  He is that good.  The music is atmospheric without being an aural sleeping pill.  It is educated rock from first song to last one.  It is a tad different than their first album, and it may not be for people who find Limp Bizkit to be their favorite band.  But it belongs in your collection in between nema and Johnny Cash's &quot;HURT&quot;.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Its not mama's gun but its not supposed to be.  This album is funky, free flowin, vibin dope to the millionth power.  I've been listening to it for the last 6 days just groovin with a smile on my face.  I love &quot;I want you&quot;, &quot;On the grind&quot;, &quot;Danger&quot; just about every song on the album.  The only neutral comment about the album I have is that I liked the original version of &quot;Love of my life&quot; better then the remix with Queen latifah and Bahamadia &amp; Angie Stone.
B00005JLWN|3.0|hello there! the story of this movie is great! ppl with no emotions! a perfect world! I remembered demolition man when I noticed the concept of the movie! the actors are not bad at all and the movie is good! not a problem with that..<BR>but the FIGHT SCENES ARE SIMPLY RIDICULOUS! lolol what a matrix rip off!! swords and bullets everywhere lol simple stupidity! I guess 12 year olds will love it! lol when are they gonna make some movie that's 1% good as pulp fiction, 8 mm or shawshank redemption.....
0553274503|4.0|Daniel Keyes's novel, _Flowers for Algernon is a heart-rending, but true to life account of a mentally chalenged adult as he attempts to overcome the bigotry, hipocracy, and general evil all around him, all while becoming steadily more aware of his feeble, nearly helpless position as first an intellectually divoid, than overstimulated individual. I found the description of Charlie's experiences more enlightening when he was mentally slower, than when his IQ increased, and, unlike the short story version which inspired me, after reading it in eighth grade, to read this one five years later, Gordon's rise to intellectual brilliance is not as well-developed, except for evidence of steadily improving spelling and grammar. As for my comments about extraneous sexual scenes, I believe Keyes could have shown us Charlie's struggle and emotional confusion without resorting to so much of a reliance on explicitly Freudian scenes. However, that was the mode of psychological thought prevalent at the time, so it is to be expected, I suppose. All in all, a wonderful, if overly psycho-analysis driven, story.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Many music fans thought that Eric Clapton was God.  They were wrong... God is Jimmy Page!
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Hi folks around the globe! I saw this movie in the cinema immediately it came out and was at once enthralled by it. I just love the cinematography, the unrellenting pace of the movie and the actors' performances, each one of them is worth a big big hand. I was particularly surprised at J. Connelly's acting skills, she's so much more than a pretty face. The subjects brought up the film (addiction, the crave for love, fate, responsibility) resonate deeply within you, allowing reflexions and debate. Summing up, I am delighted to have the DVD at home, as it gives you access to previously unseen footage, interviews and so forth. Just one thing, and if anyone has an answer I'm all ears...well, English is not my mother tongue and even if I do get 90% of the dialogues, there's the occasional slang word or phrase that I miss, that's why I count on English subtitles as something to turn to now and then. This DVD is supposed to include close captioning. There's no way I could decode it, though. Could someone tell me if they were able to? And if so, how? Last but not least, buy the director's cut, there's already enough fascism about so as to foster censorship. Down with censorship, up with quality Art. And no doubt Requiem for a Dream is cinema at its summit.
B00005JLKB|5.0|Superhero tv shows barely work. They often have trouble adapting the source material or the show's vision isn't quite what you remember. Well here's the most beloved character in comicdom(next to Batman) being faithfully adapted.<br />Clark Kent(Tom Welling) has mainly 2 things in his life that he's going through: his rather inhuman abilities to run at high speeds(they show it has a blur), superhuman strength and more abilities along the way. The other is pining for the love of Lana Lang(played by Kristin Kreuk, one of the most gorgeous things I've seen on the Earth), who just happens to be dating the star football player Whitney Fordman. Clark's best friends in school are Chloe Sullivan(very good-looking too but nowhere near Kristin) and Pete(Sam Jones III)<br />The episodes play out in a very episode-like fashion unlike Season 2's continuing plot.  Every week there's a local teen who through green rocks(which we know as Kryptonite), they possess special abilities: shapeshifting, bee commanding, bodyheat draining and a kid who can read minds. Despite the &quot;freak of the week&quot; structure, it's very enjoyable tv and stay tuned for Season 2 which explores even more into Clark's history(including the famed red kryptonite episode)<br />A great introduction which deals with one of the most popular icons of the last century
0800141601|3.0|First Knight is a movie that offers exactly what you expect from its title: tons of heroic actions, lots of battles and sword fights, kidnappings, ambushes, the standard bad guy and, of course, a woman around whom evolves the whole story. Unfortunately it doesn't have what it takes to rise above the pack - something which is probably true for &quot;Exculibur&quot;.<br />The screenplay focuses on two quite different battles: We have the battle for the heart of Guenevere, who is claimed by the young, handsome and fearless Lancelot and the old but wise King Arthur. We also have the battle for the kingdom of Camelot, that is claimed by a fallen knight, called Malagand. The novelty of the story lies in the fact that it stresses more the former than the latter of those two battles.<br />Guenevere has to choose between the man that she lusts and the man whom she respects and knows that can help her people. Apart from such clichés of a classic love triangle, First Knight contains lots of action scenes.<br />Judging its battles, Lancelot doesn't even come close to the enviable rawness of movie like Braveheart. Furthermore, there are a number of scenes totally lacking any truthfulness: Lancelot gets in the bad guy's hideout, who at the time is having his lunch, and without any obvious difficulties manages to save Guenevere (actually, not for the first time), before Malagand's best boys realize what exactly is going on. On the other hand, which was the last film where you saw a general (as King Arthur in this case) watching carefully his men fight, providing them with strategic directions and by this way, affecting the outcome of the battle? I like it when little things like that are added to the screenplay, since they enhance a movie's credibility.<br />As far as performances are concerned, First Knight hits the mark. Sean Connery, with a suiting gray beard, is the ideal choice for King Arthur. He is totally convincing as the elder but at the same time full of experiences king, who now desires to live a peaceful life. Still, the best moment of Connery's performance comes almost at the end, when he calls his unarmed people to fight for their freedom.<br />Malagand, the former Round Table Knight who now wants to conquer Camelot with his own army, is portrayed, with an obvious tendency towards exaggeration, by Ben Cross. He is the classic bad guy who, as all similar roles would require, resorts to often met grimaces and one liners (&quot;Burn Everything!!!&quot;), but does so really effortlessly, not bothering us at all!<br />Richard Gere may not be that convincing as the next leader of a kingdom, but, without any doubt, breathes a much needed freshness to the role of Lancelot.<br />My only objection lies in the role of Guenevere. Julia Ormont has clearly the natural beauty necessary to convince us as the object of assertion between two men. Also, in the film's opening sequences she shows a very dynamic character, raising our expectations even more. What a pity... After that point and until the end, the writers let her do nothing more than simply watch Lancelot save her, in the most unbelievable ways, from her numerous pursuers.<br />Without being the most realistic depiction of the Camelot myth (&quot;where exactly is Exculibur? did they forget Merlin? an American as Lancelot?&quot; are only some of the possible questions posed by the hardcore fans), First Knight is a movie that remains entertaining despite its 134 minutes of duration.
B00000720W|4.0|Actually that &quot;Redneck&quot; from PA was right. If you look on the back of the cd it has Maniac as well as Messiah on vocals. Dead only appeared on &quot;Live In Leipzig&quot; and two studio tracks for an obscure compilation album. Still Deathcrush is one intense album.
B00005A0N5|5.0|By reading this review you will expect to read an objective opinion about this album. Even though I am not a Nightwish fan, I just like them, my review cannot be objective....Even more, my review won't even be whole as I will only talk about one particular song in this album...a ballad kind of song called &quot;Sleeping Sun&quot;. Seeing in the reviews earlier that a guy didn'g like this song, I can only respect his opinion and go on by presenting my own: You should buy this album no matter what kind of music you listen to, even if it is goa trance or traditional klarina, only for the &quot;Sleeping Sun&quot;. <BR> Why would you like this song? Maybe because of the etherial music? The fairy operatic voice? Maybe due to the fact that it is a great synthesis that doesn't belong to a sub category kind of music, but defines music itself as a whole? Could it be that your mother, father, daugther, wife, grandmother will like it? It must be one of the above reasons that you will like this song.<BR> Then imagine that if you like this song even a bit, what will be the chances that you will equally like all the rest songs of the album, if not more? Add to that the superiority that people see in the rest of the album and you will reach to a conclusion. It's simple math...Aren't the chances worth bying this album? <BR> ps. I wasn't paid either by the band or the company to write this review. It came from the heart by listening to Sleeping Sun that made me chill...
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|...just a few of the adjectives that come to mind with this album.  I learned to stop being afraid that Maynard would stop releasing magnificent albums after Mer De Noms was released (what is this, six incredible albums in a row now?!?)<br />This is a dark and mesmerizing journey into human emotions and is instantly in my top five albums of all time.  I have a feeling listening to this album over and over will produce &quot;favorite track of the week&quot; type behavior similar to Mer De Noms.  Every time I listen, there is something new that I discover.  After my fourth listen in so many days, The Noose and The Package have stayed in my head.  Such beautiful and terrifying songs.<br />I can't wait to listen again.
B00005221M|4.0|I think that this was a wonderful, moving movie. It was suprising, sad at times and has a great cast of characters. DanielDay-Lewis and Madeline Stowe have a perfect chemistry together and have a realistic relationship. It's GREAT!!!!1
0783225857|5.0|I write in response to one of the reviewers who said the movie is not suitable for ages under 12.  I think this movie should be seen by children as young as six.  After all, isn't scout six, isn't this about the world through the eye of a child.  A movie like this approaches the violence and hatred in the world as responsible as one can approach the subject.  Considering what young kids see on TV now, we can't shelter kids forever. This movie can break kids in on the harsh reality of the world in a positive way.
B000001FZK|5.0|The last reviewer commented on the similarity of Laughing Stock to Spirit of Eden, and I can definitely see it--but I view it as a positive...I would have gladly accepted the two albums as a single 2-disc work.  Laughing Stock and Spirit of Eden very much complement each other both musically and lyrically.  Even the similar cover art highlights the commonality...together like sunrise and sunset.  Sadly, this album marked the sunset for Talk Talk, a band that grew from mundane pop origins into mesmerising, minimalist, and deeply spiritual pondering that proved a nightmare for the creativity-stifling music industry.  Perhaps--and this is simply my interpretation--the title of the album reflects a resigned understanding on the part of the band of what was likely to be...and at the same time, maybe even a sense of eagerness to meet their fate, not in suicidal terms , but in an eagerness to embrace their eccentricity.  Perhaps there is even *pride* in being the \\"laughing stock\\" of the insipid popular critics.<br />They do indeed have much to be proud of.  Like its companion, Spirit of Eden, this album could very easily have been produced just yesterday instead of over a decade ago.  Though the comparison may seem strange at first, I am reminded of a more minimalist version of Sigur Ros (perhaps Talk Talk influenced them?).  Pieces like the rather atonal, meandering \\"Myrrhman\\", and \\"Runeii's\\" game of silences are perhaps the most experimental of the lot, although even the more \\"normal\\"-seeming \\"Ascension Day\\" shows signs of it as well.  On Laughing Stock, I nominate \\"Ascension Day\\" (despite its abrupt cutoff--glitch or intentional?) and \\"New Grass\\" as the two best tracks.<br />Laughing Stock is perhaps a bit more upbeat than Spirit of Eden, which seems to have portrayed a man so downtrodden that he yearns to make a new start.  Laughing Stock lyrically seems like the beginnings of that new morning, although that desperation is still there (New Grass in particular helps create this impression).  In order to decipher the lyrics, it's necessary to both read Mark Hollis' nearly illegible handwriting and his equally cryptic, faint and melodic singing--but once done, a very interesting picture emerges.  Mr. Hollis' lyrics are replete with a deep, instinctive spirituality...not the dogmatic, pop kind of \\"Christianity\\", but something very natural and flowing--he seems to write these things not to proselytize, but simply because it is an integral part of his being.  As such, it's a delight to listen to.  Yes, he can discern some of the problems, but rather than launch on a bitter diatribe, he instead expresses a gentle longing for things to be put right.  \\"Heaven waits--someday Christendom may come Westward\\"...perhaps a suggestion that what *did* come westward from the Holy Land very often did not truly reflect what Jesus stood for.  But, even with this he does not *condemn*--he hopes, and this is what makes his more spiritual ruminations so listenable and so touching.<br />Overall, this is an album NOT to be missed...I am deeply glad that Polydor saved this gem from fading away to a distant memory.  As it is, it's too little known.  Tell your friends about the gorgeous final triad of albums by Talk Talk: Colour of Spring, Spirit of Eden, and this album, Laughing Stock!  5 stars, all!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|This film went somewhere new, and took a lot of risks.  I for one loved that it made me think. Lots of people loved the original for its action, but that was a small piece of it.  I'm glad this sequel focuses on the more intellectual issues.
B000063S6Z|3.0|The timing of release of \\"18\\" is not proper: It comes as a follow-up to one of the most innovative and one best albums of the 1990s, \\"PLAY\\". Of course, the expectations for this follow-up, was pretty high. This alone is bad for the follow-up. If this is not enough, the follow-up turns out to be strictly mediocre. <br />Frankly, overwhelmed by the gargantuan success of \\"PLAY\\", MOBY has tried to repeat what he had done with its predecessor, to \\"18\\". Moreover, it seems as if he has run out of ideas for this album, and didn't have enough of them to make this album unique and special in any way, hence making it sound a lot like \\"PLAY\\", only worser. The result: a good number of songs, which sound more or less the same as some songs on \\"PLAY\\". The songs, \\"In This World\\", \\"One Of These Mornings\\" and \\"Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday)\\", are amongst the best songs on \\"18\\", and these sound really good. But sadly, any of these numbers could be \\"Porcelain\\" or \\"Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad\\" from \\"PLAY\\", if one changes the lyrics. It is because of the striking similarity of these songs from \\"18\\" to the ones on \\"PLAY\\", that they don't seem as enjoyable as they ought to be. In a way, there is a feeling that not enough justice has been done to both these set of songs, from \\"PLAY\\", and from \\"18\\".<br />Still, not everything is disheartening about \\"18\\". There is also a good deal of reasons to smile about this album. Not every good song on \\"18\\" sounds like a copy of the ones on \\"PLAY\\". To begin with, the first single, \\"We Are All Made Of Stars\\", with an uncannily 80-ish feel to it, is a perfect `radio song' - irresistibly likeable. Other songs like \\"At Least We Tried\\" and \\"I'm Not Worried At All\\", not only have fantastic vocals, but their melancholy and their musically simple and honest nature, are touching. As a matter of fact, \\"I'm Not Worried At All\\", is such a beautiful way to end the album: positive lyrics, simple and somber tune; it really invokes a teardrop or two.<br />So, \\"18\\" is not as good as \\"PLAY\\". It is made even worse, as its expectations are set too high by \\"PLAY\\", to which it sadly doesn't live up. Tough it has a few or even more than a few memorable moments, \\"18\\" is strictly a decent dance album, nothing spectacular though.

B00005JLKB|5.0|I was skeptic when I first saw the promo for this series back in the day.  I was like &quot;What lame network decided to do this series?&quot;  As a huge Superman fan, I was disgusted at the thought.  But after watching the show, I immediately became a fan and haven't looked back since!  Sorry for being a doubter!  I already own the shows on my computer (thanks to the digital age) but I'm excited to get the DVD set.  Great series.  Would definitely recommend.<br />Superman Superfan
B0000067L4|4.0|the four studio tracks - anyone for tennis, badge, scrapyard thing and what a bring down - makes this album worth buying (i was actually very surpised to see a few reviews trash the last two). The live tracks are gravy!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I've had the album for 2 days &amp; I must have listened to it 20 times thus far,<BR>It is intriguing to say the least, I've read some reviews elsewhere by people who thought the new apc album blew, well two points first of all if you listen to the album expecting it to be a carbon copy of their debut it's not, secondly you have to listen to the album in it's entirety to truly experience it's power, yes it's softer but what this album lacks in volume it gains in complexity, buy it, listen to it 20 times in a row then tell me you don't like it!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A whole new direction... a whole new life.  This release is absolute brilliance.  Everyone popping this cd in for the first time, do yourself a favor and just forget Mer De Noms ever existed because this is totally different.  I loved Mer De Noms, and it is very high on my list of favorite albums.  As of this moment, this album transcends that list.  I can't even pinpoint it.  I listen to many many albums, from many many different bands, but for some reason this album caught me off guard and off balance.  One thing that I did notice is that there is more &quot;air&quot; in this album.  There are a few very heavy moments, but even more melodic, peaceful moments (if you can call it peaceful).  It gives you time to think about whats going on and take it all in.  I might be in the minority, but I enjoy the Failure cover of &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; a great deal.  It works for me and I find it refreshing.  All in all, an excellent effort by an incredible group, and a lead singer that can do no wrong.  Everything Maynard touches really does turn to gold.  I'm beginning to think I can say the same thing about Howerdel also.
006016848X|1.0|If anything, a 'how to' guide such as this one could lead to further misunderstanding in many relationships. The pat 'this means that' would be far off the mark in more cases than one could count.<br />Here is a simple example (which I, as a woman, have a right to make.) Gray's assumption that women are invariably empathetic listeners, instinctively understand what other women say, and that their unsolicited 'constructive criticism' is an expression of caring and love, is laughable. Respectively, in many cases the 'empathy' is merely looking for key words in the other's speech in order to respond with one's own 'wisdom,' the assumption of 'understanding' means very poor listening ability (often accompanied by answers to questions no one asked), and the meddling, excuse me, 'constructive criticism' is an ego game.<br />No one is ready to explore knowledge of the other in relationships unless one first tries some honest self-knowledge. This is merely a 'how to' book for assumptions, accompanied by a smug 'I'm this way because I am from Mars/Venus'.
B0000072O2|5.0|Ok, I know that this album is not all original material, but Mike really touched gold with his remakes of some of these timeless celtic classics. High points (well, to me, it's all high points) are &quot;Women of Ireland&quot;, &quot;Flowers of the Forest&quot; and &quot;The Voyager&quot;. This is one of my top 3 favorite Mike albums, and I pretty much have them all on CD. If you were disapointed in &quot;Guitars&quot; and the &quot;the Milennium Bell&quot;, pick this album up to get you back to normal. My 3 month old son loves it, (puts him to sleep) and my wife and I had one of our most romantic weekends with the cd in the background..you can't lose with this one.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|&quot;Mers de Noms&quot; was a very good CD.  That being said, I will say that &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; is even better.  Whereas &quot;Mers de Noms&quot; established the unique sound of the band, &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; fortifies it and takes it even a step further.  The songs on this CD seem even more mellow than those on their previous release, but at the same time, they are more focused and somewhat darker sounding.  Its obvious that, with the addition of Jeordie White, the bass plays a more prominent role in many songs, and while I normally am indifferent to bass, it clearly adds more to the songs on this CD than I thought possible. <br />If you liked &quot;Mers de Noms&quot; then you will definately like &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;.  Some reviewer called this CD more mature that their 1st effort, which I initially dismissed.  However, that description is really right on the mark.  One of the year's best.
B00009P1O0|4.0|Many albums were left behind during the CD revolution of the early 90s, but few as well-respected as Neil Young's On the Beach. Last month, the 1974 album was issued on CD for the first time, along with five other of Young's &quot;lost albums.&quot; The long absences of the other five can be attributed to their being more or less low points in Young's catalogue, yet many critics and fans consider On the Beach one of his best efforts, making its former &quot;lost album&quot; status a source of curiosity (and outrage for Young diehards). Regardless of why Young shelved On the Beach or why he restored it, fans should delight in the return of this exceptional album.<br />Like its sister album, 1975's Tonight's the Night (recorded before it, but released after it and, strangely enough, always available on CD), On the Beach is fascinatingly bleak. The mood on both these albums is often attributed to Young's anger and sadness over the drug-related deaths of roadie Bruce Berry and Crazy Horse guitarist, Danny Whitten. But On the Beach is more the sound of Young letting it all out. He offers deep confessionals regarding everything from his break-up with actress, Carrie Snodgrass (&quot;Motion Pictures&quot;) to his rows with Lynyrd Skynyrd and other detractors (&quot;Walk On&quot;) to his one-time acquaintance with Charles Manson (&quot;Revolution Blues&quot;). Other songs are less specific, such as &quot;Ambulance Blues,&quot; a scathing, drunken-sounding indictment of just about everything and the title track, a day-in-the-life account of a rock star who feels dead inside. The pure weight of the subject matter and the openness with which it is addressed is one of the facets that makes On the Beach so outstanding.<br />Another is the fact that Young, like John Lennon on Plastic Ono Band, realizes that a gloomy album is necessarily have a quiet one. There is an electric undercurrent across On the Beach that is sometimes vigorous (&quot;Walk On&quot;), sometimes subdued (&quot;See the Sky About to Rain&quot;) but almost always present. Young even manages a blues number (&quot;Vampire Blues&quot;) and a lively bluegrass romp (&quot;For the Turnstiles&quot;). Regardless of the dynamism of the music, though, the lyrical theme remains strife and heartache, sung about with an intensity and frankness that are rare. It is great to have this album back.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|This cd is AWESOME!! Erykah never dissapoints, this is a must have cd.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I like it so much more than &quot;Mer de noms&quot;.  Like some wines, some bands are getting better with time.  I was hyptonized by the etheral guitar (played soflty like falling down from the sky ... it must be the sound of paradise).  Then I was captivated by the nice purring bass.  The pitch of singer Kennan is so impressive. Drum and all effects are nice too.<br />Favorite track is &quot;The noose&quot; followed by &quot;Vanishing&quot; than by &quot;The package&quot;. I love beats like in &quot;Pet&quot;.<br />Fantastic album.
0345357116|4.0|This a great book for those that read (and liked)Lord of the Rings and the silmarillion. It gives the extra details we want to know-that weren't in those books. The storys are very good, and fun to read even if you haven't read all tolkiens work.<BR>It goes in order of events by time. You start with the story of Tuor in Numenor.My fav story was about Tuors cousin Turin(they didn't know one another).<BR>I think every Tolkien fan will enjoy this book.
B000002J3W|4.0|Some of you might be thinking why i gave this cd 4 stars. i wanted to give it the full five but there are two songs on here that i just cant listen to. tracks 3.Bonehead and track 4.Beat yourself blind. Bonehead has too much of a punk sound  but as it goes on it gets better and beat urself blind just gets me at the chorus but besides it it is an ok song.however, the rest of this cd is great!!!!! when i first listened to this cd i was disappointed in it but when i really listened to it i saw that i didnt waste my money. if you are a good fan of skid row then you will really enjoy this album and hey, if ur not then u might become a fan. i bet all the bad reviewers havent really listened to it but if u want the opinion from someone who lives for music and is an artist themselves, then i will tell you buy it!!!! and listen to it well, no first impressions like listening to the first 10 seconds, i mean like the whole song. thanx for reading my review have have a great day!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This long awaited cd was well worth the wait! APC is unlike any other band. Their music transcends the quality and emotions of today's music except for a few select few (NIN,Tool,etc.) I am very pleased with this work and would recommend it to anyone who gravitates towards this type of listening pleasure!!
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Although this disc contains some great music, it is painfully obvious that Billy relinquished far too much of the creative process to Maynard. From being both a huge TOOL fan and a huge APC fan, I don't feel as though my ears have been fully satisfied. I don't feel as though I have been listening to APC, I feel like I have been listening to TOOL. The first APC record has a clear distinction in sound which made it unique, a difficult feat I'm sure given Maynards distinctive voice and style. This record falls short by not carrying on the APC sound and style. Don't get me wrong, it's a great record and I highly recommend it to all TOOL fans, I do though feel a little dissatisfied as an APC fan.
B0000640S1|4.0|In \\"First Blood\\" Sylvester Stallone is John Rambo a wandering ex-Green Beret looking for a former Vietnam buddy in a small hostile town.  Rambo is unjustly harassed and arrested by over zealous Sheriff Will Teasle (Brian Dennehy).  When Rambo is pushed to the limit he strikes back and single handedly beats up several officers in route to an escape into the surrounding hills.<br />Now that Rambo is back in his element things get interesting as a member of Teasle's posse unwittingly draws \\"First Blood\\" (hence the title) unleashing the wrath that is Rambo!  The subsequent hoopla and bombast that accompanied the remaining two installments to the series really overshadow the quality of \\"First Blood.\\"  Stallone is at his monosyllabic best with a screenplay that keeps the dialogue down and revs the action up. Veteran action director Ted Kotcheff expertly handles the key set piece of the film that shows Rambo deftly ambushing several unsuspecting victims with such precision that none of them is fatally wounded.  Finally Rambo comes face to face with his accuser Sheriff Teasle to issue an ultimatum that actually does more to up the stakes rather then cool the situation down.  Rambo's former commanding officer Trautmen (Richard Crenna) is brought in for advice but instead issues his own declaration when he tells Sheriff Teasle that if he continues to pursue Rambo he better have a lot of body bags.<br />\\"First Blood\\" is really a study in wills and the stubbornness not to know when to back down.  Sheriff Teasle is not able to admit that he is over matched and Rambo uses the injustice he has suffered both in the small town and in Vietnam as a reason to let his fury rage on an unsuspecting populace.  Recent films like the disappointing \\"The Hunted\\" would have done well to mimic the terse sensibilities that served \\"First Blood\\" so well.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|When A Perfect Circle first came out with Mer De Noms, I was immediately hooked by the powerful lyrics and haunting melodies to match. &quot;Maynard is a god,&quot; I thought to myself. After waiting patiently for a few years for this new album to come out, it has finally arrived!<br />Thirteenth Step is an amazing mix of musical genius, and beautiful poetry, which is clearly evident in their newest single &quot;Weak and Powerless.&quot;<br />I'm one of the biggest APC fans out there, and this album was not disappointing in the least. It completely blew the last one out of the water! I completely recommend buying this, whether you're a long time fan or looking for something new.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The much anticipated Thirteenth Step by A Perfect Circle delivers exactly what the avid APC fan wants, original music that no other band can come close to mirroring. The album is much more crisp and clear than APC's first album Mer de Noms. The music is heavier and more dramatic, a must for any music lover, regardless of taste.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing except for associating it in my mind with johnny bravo the cartoon. I was strangely surprised. The whole film, honestly, I sat with the same awe expression on my face. You will be confused. But its a good confused. Its one of those movies that makes you think and you leave questioning everything, reality, time, life, etc...<BR>Part of you will want to watch it over and over again but then part of you will still be scared and confused and never want to think about it again. I won't lie, its unsettling. Enjoy. :)
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I have Three Words for this Cd....Oh My Word...I was listening to my friend's copy of it in our English 101 class and, and I could not take my headphones off...Every song just put me into a trance...I highly recommend this cd to anyone who loves music.  I loved it so much, that I bought three copies, incase I scratched up one of them.
B00008AY3L|3.0|After his first three superb albums, which highlighted his stellar slide playing, 'Burn to Shine' was a massive disappointment.<BR> Luckily, this album is better than that. Unfortunately it's still nowhere near the quality of his first three efforts. And the Weissenborn is *still* absent.<BR>   <BR>  Additionally, Virgin appears to have introduced CDS2000 or a similar type of copy &quot;protection&quot;, which makes it all but impossible to get a bit-for-bit rip of the first track. <br />  This is because the &quot;protection&quot; process actually introduces errors into the data on the CD itself and counts on your standalone CD player to interpolate over the error properly.<BR>   <BR>  Some older or offbrand standalone CD players may therefore produce strange skipping sounds or refuse to play  &quot;With My Own Two Hands&quot; altogether. This is because the deliberate introduction of errors into the data track without corresponding error correction bits violates the Red Book audio standard (and no C2 or MMC error correction can fix it). The only thing that keeps this track from making obnoxious 'shlerpping' noises in mopst peoples' CD players is their internal interpolation logic, which varies in quality from brand to brand. <br />    This is a *serious* concern since most every CD retailer in the USA will NOT allow you to return a disc that has been opened regardless of whether you claim it will not play in your player. Amazon may be different in this respect, I am unsure.<br />  I would wager that one would have an easier time finding this track on an illegal filesharing network than actually ripping it properly off the CD for one's own personal (and completely legal) use.<BR>  I refuse to do this because I still naively believe that artists without their own labels might make some money directly from my purchases, and I use FLAC lossless audio compression so no data is lost. <BR>  I eventually used the CDex ripper with paranoid error correction turned off, andit finally came out without audible errors after attempting to rip it in several different optical drive brands. <BR>  Owning a 24-bit sound card, it would have been trivially easy to capture the (interpolated) audio in analog from a quality standalone unit and then dither the high-res signal down to 16/44.1. I am stubborn however, and refuse to compromise with any introduced additional noise - since the CD is ostensibly a CD, it should play in any redbook compliant CD player. <br />   This one doesn't, and yet they sell it at CD stores and make no mention of the deliberately introduced errors. Most people who make mp3's to trade will not insist on bit-for-bit accuracy, and non-&quot;secure&quot; ripping programs will probably be able to pull te first track off the CD without anyone noticing anything but a small blurping-noise to two. Most people who trade mp3's won't mind this at all. It angered me enough to write this long review, and I actually *bought* the album.<BR>  This is what the record company still doesn't get. <br />  As a pathetic &quot;concession&quot; to those of us to listen to audio entirely through our computers (which can be as high fidelity as you please and allows for huge playlists and instant access), Virgin has included a data track that contains a very bad installable media player and a horrifically low resolution WMA version of the album. <BR>  These compressed tracks sound far worse than a mono AM radio broadcast, literally. It does not matter if you have a studio quality 24-bit 192Khz capable sound card, there is nothing you can do to make the included compressed versions sound even remotely acceptable.<br />   So, while I enjoy this album to some extent, I'm somewhat disappointed with its lack of flow and general inconsistency. Even on his heartfelt (if tiresome) songs about jesus, Harper is sorely lacking in comparison to the first three albums. <BR>   And where is the Wiessenborn that made him such a unique and compelling artist to begin with???<br />   Even more disappointing is Virgin's asinine attempt to foil file sharers by penalizing all buyers of the album with an inferior and deliberately error-ridden (including the error correction code) copy.<BR>   Thanks for nothing Virgin. <BR>   <BR>   If I were a more mean spirited person, I might consider sharing the first track alone in a CD-quality Vorbis or LAME mp3 format on file-sharing network. <BR>   I still refuse to do this, but I will not be buying any more Virgin releases for a long, long time. Sorry Ben!
B00005JKMQ|3.0|This uneven account of the life of Muhammad Ali (as played by Will Smith) has much to offer, even if it does not hang together as a whole.  In many ways, this film is too ambitious in its effort to touch upon many of the complexities of the renowned heavyweight boxer; the film tries to include too much and therefore doesn't fully explore any one aspect.  As a result, this film feels incomplete despite its length.  Will Smith does an admirable job evoking Ali's outward charm and unreadable emotions, but this public mask often obscures a more intimate exploration.  The film succeeds best in more private moments, one on one with other characters, although Will Smith's evocation of Ali's public rhyming is dead-on.  The documentation of some of Ali's personal struggles (many of which I was not previously aware of) are both moving and politically/socially charged.  At other points, scenes drag on as though the director could not decide when to stop.  The acting is good to exceptional, with no one glaringly miscast.<br />As a Will Smith fan, I could not pass up this film despite mixed reviews.  I'm glad I finally saw it.  However, I don't recommend it for everyone because of its numerous flaws.  If you are a Will Smith or Muhammad Ali fan, you should definitely see it.  Likewise, boxing and bioflick enthusiasts should enjoy it.  Skip this film if you don't fall into any of the preceding categories since there are many other (and better) films out there.
B0000AZJXQ|2.0|I didn't like the last album very much.  It was pretentious and boring and the production was like a layer of plastic wrap pulled tight around the band that the music just couldn't get through.  Granted, the production on this one is better, they have managed to open it up a bit, but the music is just as dull.  The last album had some good songs, but not enough to justify repeated listenings.  This album is the same way.  My recomendation:  save your money and listen to your Tool albums.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|The songs on this disc remind me of the Blaze Baily discs.  Good edge, tempos, etc.  The Title track is also remeniscent of Seventh Son of a Seventh Son.  The mix, however, is not good at all.  The drums are faint, no deep bass drum nor clear snare or cymbels.  Steve's bass is also muddier than in albums past.  once you get over these problems, this is still classic Maiden.
B00009APK1|5.0|&quot;The Fellowship of the Rings&quot; maybe great but.....<BR>&quot;The Two Towers &quot; is nothing more than .......<BR>&quot;BRILLIAN&quot; and &quot;SUPERB&quot;<BR>Although I love the first because of Arwen having those black riders chase her, and drowning all of them.... This next one is simply more than what I expected to be more on the fights and adventures. But more on the Loyalty of a Friend!!!!<BR>and the Unity of all Man which was manifested by Lorien when he and his fellow elves went to Helms Deep to help the people of Rohan fight the Orcs. <BR>But then again Gandalf (Sir Ian Mckellen) was exceptional.<BR>&quot;BRAVO&quot; and &quot;LONGLIVE&quot; Gandalf and Arwen!!!!!!!!
B000001F76|5.0|Hank was a fine singer who ensured his place in popular music history by the exceptional quality of his songwriting. His songs were often recorded by pop singers of the time and this practice has continued ever since. He rarely recorded covers - so rarely that the ones he did record are often thought of as his own songs anyway.<br /><br />This compilation was originally released on vinyl and later re-issued on CD. As far as song selection goes, this is the ultimate double CD of his music. The sound quality is plenty good enough for me, though it might be interesting to hear it digitally re-mastered with the latest technology.<br /><br />Virtually every famous song associated with Hank can be found here, including all his own hits on the American country and pop charts. You can also find all the songs that have become popular via cover versions, some of which were only B-sides for Hank. The most significant omission (and it took me a while to notice that it was missing) is Honky tonkin', a great song but not absolutely essential.<br /><br />Tribute albums and other cover versions continue to be recorded, not just in country and pop music, but also Cajun, jazz, rock and other genres, so each new generation gets reminded of Hank's legacy.<br /><br />There have been many compilations of Hank's music but this is the only one that contains all the essentials and no more. As such, it is the ideal compilation for most people. I thought that the more recent British 4 CD budget box (Hillbilly hero) might include all the songs from this set but it does not cover his whole career and therefore omits several obvious songs including Jambalaya, You win again, Kaw-liga, Your cheating heart and Take these chains from my heart although it does include Honky tonkin'.<br /><br />So if you only want one collection of Hank's music, make it this one.

B000002KDB|5.0|Yes, there was an Emmylou album before this - the Gliding bird album on an independent label - but good though it was, it is this album that marks the beginning of Emmylou's career as we know it. Setting a pattern that would characterize many of Emmylou's albums, it featured many covers and few originals. Top quality musicians and Emmylou's superb voice ensured that the covers were often as good as, and sometimes better than, the originals.<br />On this album, there are three new songs, beginning with the rocking, upbeat Bluebird wine, the first of many songs written by Rodney Crowell that Emmylou would record.  Even better is Boulder to Birmingham, a great ballad that has been covered by both the Hollies and Joan Baez. Incidentally, the title contains the names of two towns - Boulder in Colorado and Birmingham in Alabama. The other original, another fine ballad, is Before believing.<br />My favorite track here is Queen of the silver dollar, a song originally recorded by Dr Hook and the Medicine show. I like their version but Emmylou and her musicians improved on it and I don't understand why it wasn't released as a single. It was left to Dave and Sugar to take the song up the country charts. Their version is wonderful but still can't match Emmylou's.<br />Emmylou does a fine cover of Dolly's Coat of many colors, but this autobiographical song is the most personal of all Dolly's songs. Emmylou's cover is the best I've heard, but still not quite up to the original, although I'm glad she recorded it.<br />The other covers are all equal to or better than the original versions, and that is hifg praise indeed considering who the original artists were. Too far gone was originally recorded (as far as I can tell) by the late, great Dottie West in the sixties but remained obscure until Barbara Fairchild took it up the country charts. If I could only win your love was the first Louvin brothers song that Emmylou covered but certainly not the last. Bottle let me down was one of Merle Haggard's early classics. Sleepless nights was first recorded by the Everly brothers in the early sixties and was later covered by the Judds in the eighties. For no one is a Beatles song that first appeared on the Revolver album.<br />This, then, was a very strong debut album from Emmylou. It set the standard for the next few years. The style of the music varied but the quality was consistently high.Merle Haggard's early classics.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Hey everyone! I just wanted to give you an informed review to A Perfect Circle's new album \\"THIRTEENTH STEP\\".  I am someone who learned long ago the lyrical complexity that is Maynard James Keenan. With his \\"other\\" project TOOL he pushed me to go new places to feel new things. Driven by music that you don't just \\"hear\\". You listened to it you felt it. Believe me you'll feel a \\"THIRTEENTH STEP\\". The music enraptures you, taking you to a new level. Sending you to a place that is thought provoking, and challenging. It could leave the \\"common\\" listener saying, \\"How dare APC make a album like this\\". I say to them \\"What an album that you can't just push play and bob your head to. Dare they make songs that sound different, and actually try to create something not just mimic something\\"? The songs contained within this album are beautiful captures of reality and the unknown. Starting out lulling you into a new environment, causing your brain to become open and accepting to an experience. Then leading into their first single \\"Weak and Powerless\\". Yes, this song is radio material. It's catchy and quick. With a funky beat and rhythm that only hints at what the album really holds for the listener. Again reaction from some &quot;fans&quot; I heard. \\"This song doesn't fit, or this song was so made for radio\\". Well that's somewhat true. It is a single. Appears it's easy and more inviting to \\"Joe shmoe and Sally from the Valley\\" to reach that bigger radio audience. To perhaps get them do buy something that might help them find out what real music is all about. When APC released their first album \\"Mer De Noms\\" they had a good running start, but they still needed that base fan group. So they released \\"Judith\\" as a single. The song was probably the heaviest song off the album and connected with the rock crowd. Well that was only a surface look at what \\"Mer de Noms\\" was. It turned out that is was a beautiful new sounding music that tugged at your more sensitive emotions. It was an albumof passion and moments of love. Simply put when APC came out they wanted to draw in the rock crowd, and have them create the \\"APC Scene\\". Ensuring that the band wouldn't be taken over by \\"teeny boppers\\". With their second release they took it to the Next Step. They used a single to draw in new fans that was from a different \\"scene\\". So they are just maximizing their exposure without being the typical \\"MTV LOOK AT ME BAND\\". I say it was genius, and a lot more obvious than how the record companies try to lure you in. Next you're gently laid into a beautiful airy place with the \\"Noose\\". This starts off the 4-song continuation of deep encompassing thought and submission to the music. The music goes in all directions. Using everything from simple guitars to digital beats inserted most likely from the great Danny Lohner. Along with Maynard's cleanest sounding, and most vivid vocals to date. On the whole album he shows that he isn't just a voice he is an instrument. Let alone that the lyrics are completely top notch, and as always teaching, questioning and acknowledging what it means to be human. Next you move into some really great get up and move to the rhythm songs. Not by any means mosh like. It's music your body can't deny. You move almost involuntarily as the deep bass and shimmering guitars twist and pull. Not a thing is missed in this album. Its vibe will leave you feeling positive and eager to live. For as the album ends with track \\"Gravity\\" an awe inspiring experience with the lines \\"I choose to live, I chose to live....\\"ending the album. If you want another \\"Mer de Noms\\" you aren't going to get. Understand that album is done. Its here, you'll always have it. Please listen to it often, but you should both want and need artist to push the envelope. To make something new and different from what you already have. I am thankful APC takes risk. Most bands won't put themselves on the line to be the group who changed the sounds of music. Most bands today don't have thetalent. So defiantly buy \\"Thirteenth Step\\", and go see them live in the fall and winter. It's a great new piece to add to your music collection. If you're like me, don't try and rank this cd. Don't compare it to its predecessor. Realize that there is room in life for many great cd's and records. We should be grateful that out of those thousands of records that are released we have the few select great cds we do. Love and support all great and creative artists. Especially APC for with \\"THIRTEENTH STEP\\" they helped us all reach the next level of our own self-understanding.<br />Nednarb's history<BR>Age: 22  Location: Under a dead Ohio sky.<br />In concert<BR>TOOL: 15 times since 1996<br />APC: 10 times since their debut tour with NIN's.
0486278077|4.0|This is quite a book.  Mr. Wilde has quite a literary ability.  His characters are as vibrant as a Van Gogh, his plot is tense, and he has quite a gift for quips and comebacks.  All of this combines for a great piece of literature, regardless of the topic or story.<br />This book explores the darker side of humanity, along the lines of Faust, Dr. Jekyll, and Lord of the Flies.  We all feel this dread and anxiety deep within our soul; Wilde does not hold a mirror, but a picture for us to look upon and marvel.  You get the chills up and own your spine as you watch Lord Henry seduce Dorian Grey.<br />I think the high point of the story was in Chapter XI when Dorian sets a mirror next to the foul picture and goes back and forth looking at his baby-face and then the incubus in the painting.  What is crucial is that Dorian is so detached: he sees himself as the smooth-faced god, but in reality, he is the demon in the picture.  But his detachment is what is so crucial.  He knows what his soul looks like, but he doesn't care!<br />At times this books seems like a play, which has Wilde's native element.  But the prose has such a smooth flow that you do not notice.  I found myself constantly underlining Wilde's aphorism.  He has a gift for one-liners, and his book is quite a charming read.
B000002UJQ|3.0|I find it amazing that people still try to beat each other into submission over what is &quot;good music&quot;.  The whole point of listening to music is to be entertained.  Just because you don't enjoy something doesn't mean you have the right to tell everyone else they are stupid for listening to it.  Along the same lines, if you like something, that doesn't mean everyone else has to like it as well.  OK Computer is a good album, IN MY OPINION.  I enjoy its different themes and I comend Radiohead for attempting to say something with their music.  Now, just because I like it doesn't mean everyone else will.  My suggestion is to borrow it from someone and listen to it a few times.  If you like it, buy it.  If you don't, at least you personally gave it a try instead of listening to someone on the internet talk out of their a**.  Wake up people, and make some decisions for your self.<br />\\"Life is a series of moments.  And the only moment of which we can be aware is this moment right now\\"
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The new album Thirteenth Step is phenomenal. Once again all the elements of sound fell under the spell of a powerful group and as a result guides you on a moving and riveting emotional experience. Despite the true and meaningful connotation(whatever that may for each of you)of the album title it is truly the next step in the evolution of A Perfect Circle.
B00001OH7P|5.0|Bowie derivative? from T Rex? Maybe on Mars. Not here on Earth. You need to see your audiologist, pronto.<br />Don't listen to j-sugila, folks: take it from someone who was *there* in the 70s when this album hit the streets, it was breathtakingly fresh back then, and still makes most of what's been produced since sound tired. Don't believe me? Play the audio clip from &quot;Hang onto yourself&quot; on one of the vendor sites (Hey,Amazon, put it up on yours!), and see if your heart rate doesn't kick up by 20 beats per minute.<br />Bowie is in the same class as Hendrix: he broke rules that nobody else even knew existed before he came on the scene. And like Hendrix, he's been imitated often and never duplicated.
B0000028M7|5.0|What a display of hopelessness and frustration! This, my friends is the where it all ends. The penultimate metal record and one of the best rock records ever. Forget Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. Don't listen to the misinformed critics. Grunge this is not. Lumping the Chains in with those inferior acts is a travesty. This is heavy metal! Buy it yesterday.<br /> What mainly sets Dirt apart is the harmony. It can be bludgeonly heavy at times while always hooking you. The dynamics and melodies from song to song are outstanding. Rain when I die, Down In A Hole, Angry Chair, Junkhead. The list goes on. No two sound alike. Lots of off key, slow sludgy riffs with the main man Layne belting a big slab of doom. Nothing ever knocked me back like this. Dirt is in a class by itself. Every tune is great. Multiple intense listens are required to truly get what is going on here. It is a creeper. The only other contemporary heavy band in their class is Tool. Satisfy yourself with this one folks....truly special music. R.I.P. Layne. You are sorely missed.
B0000AM6LY|2.0|For Simply Red, they really seemed to have it all throught the 1980's. They made some great songs, and inspired a whole Soul generation. Unfortunately, the popularity the group endured in the 1990's was widely recieved overseas, but not over here in the process. Still, it is justa shame that when it now comes to their music, it is about as loosely recieved as a flake from the sky. Still, that doesn't seem to tell within the careers Mick and the boys have recieved now.<br />Their 2003 album, Home, really seems to be the blandest record out there right now. They really aren't trying to capture when they had it, and the feel of the record is absolutely poor to the floor. The songs from Home and Fake, really don't have that kind of rhythm. The only good song that really seems to stand out is Sunrise, which became a Dance Pop hit on Billboard's Adult Contemporary charts. Otherwise, nothing else seems to make any enjoyment and pleasure here.<br />Still, I just wish that Simply Red could try to recapture those days, and score massively again, but it isn't the case. If you want to enjoy the greater era of Simply Red, purchase their 1996 Greatest Hits collection. Trust me, you won't be sorry with that one, instead of being Simply Blue with this one.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|After years of listening to &quot;mer de noms&quot; and loving every song as much or more each time, &quot;thirteenth step &quot; has added 12 more tracks for APC fans to fall in love with. Fight the temptation to play the first three songs  over and over again, because the following 9 tracks rock too!!  Do not miss track 9...'the nurse who loved me'...as it is a beautiful mix of musical genius, poetry, &amp; comedy--maynard's vocals are hypnotizing. Best when played loudly on your iPod and headphones. P.S. Don't miss a chance to see APC live...the short and sweet set at Lollapalooza left me longing for more...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Just a note for people put off by the full-screen format.  Chris Buchanan of Mutant Enemy has assured us that the release info was erroneous and that the final product is in fact widescreen (16:9).
B00005YXZH|2.0|I can't think of a single soul who wasn't on the edge of their seat waiting for YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT. The news of a band defying their record label, releasing the album for free on the internet just for spite, then.... going to another subsidiary of the same label... anyway... at first listen, it was like smoking a Cuban cigar... forbidden in this country. Once the initial joy wore off of listening to this album that defied executives, the real critical ear went to work. The album is dry. The songs tend to run too long and there is a bit too much noise. They can be borderline irritating, and this comes from a listener who tends to like more experimental sounds and artists that have an acquired taste. This album is a must-have simply for the story, but for the music, it's best to stop with &quot;Summer Teeth&quot;.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Mer de Noms (sea of names) was a brilliant cd.  Songs such as &quot;The Hollow&quot;, &quot;3 Libras&quot;, &quot;The Rose&quot;, and &quot;Judith&quot; were beautiful in their individual complex nature.  The 13th Step is also beautiful but it sounds much different.  With the changes in the group, bassist Twiggy Ramirez, and guitarist James Iha, this album is harder.  Billy Howerdel's guitar playing is incredible, as always, and there is a much stronger &quot;wall&quot; with the guitars on this album.  Drummer Josh Freese hold's perfect tempo throughout, and Maynard James Keenan's voice is amazingly disturbing as it should be.  Track three &quot;The Noose&quot; is one of the most incredible songs I've ever heard.  The biggest thing that sets the two albums apart though, is the timing.  Mer de Noms was released in 2000, when rock music was strong, and the dominant genre.  Today, however, that is not the case.  In a &quot;musical&quot; world that is subjugated by Ludicris, and Justin Tmberlake, and the best band that is recieving air-play is Good Charlotte, A Perfect Circle has definately produced a masterpiece in troubled times.  I wholeheartedly encourage anyone to purchase this album.  It is one of the greatest works of art of our time.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|\\"oh the hours we are seperate, 11:11 is just precious time we've wasted\\". that is how i'm feeling these days. i fell in love with rufus wainwright while being in love with someone. now 2 years have passed and me and him are not doing so well. i also turned 30 as did rufus wainwright. the new cd want one is absolutely stunning. it is his best work yet. this is far and above his debut and is more cohesive than poses(although poses holds a special place in my heart since me and him were together in better times then). the first track oh what a world is simply amazing. it really starts things off right. i don't know what it is another great song as well. movies of myself is one of the best songs on here. it is a different sound, as is the whole cd, with it's crunching guitars and fast paced melody. if radio were smart they would put this song into heavy rotation. but the cd doesn't show it's true changes unitl go or go ahead. this 6:38 song sounds like something pink floyd might've written. for the first time you get to hear an extended guitar solo in a rufus song. it's his first full out alternative rock song.  the cd is helped by having just one producer and the electric guitar of charlie sexton, who is behind the helms of edie brickell's solo cd volcano coming out next month, brings the whole cd up several notches. other highlights include  vibrate, 14th street, beautiful child, want, and 11:11. really though there isn't one bad track on here. while the cd may be very dark it doesn't feel that way at all. i bought it at tower's midnight madness and listened to it on the walk home. all i could think about was the person i'm seeing. i'm reminded of him whenever i listen to rufus wainwright because i was so in love with rufus at the time i was in love with him. we are having troubles in this relationship but rufus this morning made it all ok. rufus is a lot like my one true love in that whenever i listen to rufus he makes me feel comfortable and safe just like i feel when i'm in the arms of my one true love. i know what i want, me and the person i'm seeing back together, and i will have it. until that day i will spend my time with my other true love : rufus and his new cd.
B00008S2VH|3.0|O.k. ''American Life'' is already a few months old but I do like to share my review with other customers/ fans. <BR>Why is it that everytime Madonna does something or brings out a new record or whatever it's always bad??? Must say, I had big expectations when I saw the lyrics from the ''American Life'' album, that was because of the personal touch in the songs. But when I heard the album I was a bit disapointed. The songs are too flat and there are too much computer effects on the album that it becomes very boring. I think she must dumb Mirwais, because she has done a better job working with William Orbit (''Ray of Light'' is just another dimension of music, great vocals, great subjects, great lyrics, great atmosphere, great music, great production etc.)and for example Pat Leonard (''Like a Prayer'' the other great achievement in her career!). Then why does she works with Mirwais second time ahead? It's really not clear to me. But it's not all bad. ''Nobody Knows Me'', ''Nothing Fails, ''X-static Process'' are my personal favorite tracks on the album and whatever she does I will always admire Madonna for her ambition, guts, talent, charisme, attitude, beauty, appearences, fantasy etc. Even when she kisses with Britney and christina, that woman kicks asses! So why isn't there anyone who can say: Madonna has done a great job?! Why does she always have to be judged negatively? But I always hope she brings out another album that can measure up ''Ray of Light''. I can listen to that album everyday without getting bored (just like the demo's of that album). <BR>So Madonna keep doing what you do, keep bringing out music, stay beautiful and stay alert! And dumb Mirwais!
B00007LTIA|5.0|I have always been a little perplexed by the critics' panning of this wonderful work. I guess it's a little like telling Mozart he put in too many notes!<BR>If you're into prog at all, treat yourself to Tales (or Yes' Relayer). Yes simply operate in a league by themselves. The last few minutes of Ritual is some of the most challenging, and gorgeous, guitar work recorded.
B00006AG5N|1.0|Yeah, it's wonderful that a new generation is experiencing Elvis' one-of-a-kind music but why does BMG find it necessary (other than making money) to constantly repackage the same stuff over and over and over and over, ad infinitum?<br />You only need 3 sets: The 50's Masters, The 60's Masters (From Memphis to Nashville), and The 70's Masters. That is all.<br />Ever since RCA sold-out to BMG it has been horrible. If BMG wants to give Elvis fans something new how about cd's of unreleased music!!! I am dying to have a cd version of Elvis singing &quot;Bad Moon Risin'&quot; which he did in concert. Instead it's the same old, same old, just with new picture sleeves.<br />BMG SUX.
0156027321|1.0|This book has all the grace and purpose of a snuff film. It is just another trendy, cliched quasi-intellectual novel. Life of Pi (LoP)(go ahead, pronounce the acronym \\"lop,\\" because it captures in part the true badness of this book) is so offensive in so many ways, on so many levels, that it boggles the mind.     A Hindu boy raised on the grounds of a zoo converts to Christianity and Islam while remaining a Hindu. He practices all three religions at the same time, thereby embodying the tired academic fantasy that all religions are at bottom the same (just as I guess, being a Navy SEAL is the same thing as being a computer programmer is the same thing as being an ER trauma surgeon...they're all professions, right? Uh, no -- and just ask the kid going back for an appendectomy if it really makes no difference whether it's the trauma surgeon or the computer programmer who cuts him open).     The hero is then shipwrecked and spends weeks and weeks at sea. The tone is matter-of-fact in a Heartbreaking-Work-of-Staggering-Genius kind of way. In fact, it's the same tone precisely. Only instead of a cancer victim vomiting, as in HBWSG, LoP actually contains an episode involving the human consumption of animal feces. Part of the moral of LoP, to the extent that the term \\"moral\\" can even be associated with this book, is that there really is no such thing as truth (which is another tedious formula, but who's counting cliches in this book? If you're going to do that, you may as well turn it into a drinking game as a form of anesthesia.). Did a man brutally murder the child-narrator's mother and one other man? The book seems to suggest that there really is no way to answer the question, even though there is an eyewitness (go ahead, down that Tequila shot), because we all know that a person seeing something with his own eyes is so unreliable (only \\"unbiased\\" people who know nothing at all about the events, people, places, things or history are at all capable of deciding any controversy). The book goes on to suggest that the answer is actually irrelevant. (chug.) Throw in some symbolism and metaphors that could have been devised by a high school creative writing class and you have the book.     It is possible to write about brutality and nightmares with compassion. Stephen King writes about the nightmares omnipresent in our culture's urban folklore, with empathy and compassion and a complete mastery of the psyche and behavior of ordinary people. He gets the human response to fear and grief like no one else. For example, his description of Gage's death in Pet Sematery -- and the way that Gage's older sister displays grief for example by cramming herself into Gage's small chair and eating her baby brother's cereal even though she hated it before he died -- shows King's power to describe raw grief without melodrama. The main character's relationship to his two-year-old boy is a masterpiece approaching in quality the scene between Anna Karenina and eight-year-old Serezha when she sneaks into the house.    In contrast, this book: cannibalism, murder and coprophagia in a book that sneers at the human cost of suffering, uttered in a tone of jaded superiority and a callous shrug. And poorly-written in the same way that an ignorant high-school student's middling effort in creative writing class is poorly-written.    What Martel does say about religion springs from ignorance and backwardness and a complete indifference to the human condition. Whatever you may think about Religion, or any particular religion, it is impossible to ignore powerful hold religions have on human conduct and self-concept, the way they quantify the relationship of a human being to his own body, the way that a human being characterizes conduct as either right or wrong, or even their varying evocative aesthetics. This book says there is no way to quantify these things because you can't even prove that human suffering occurs in the first place, because you can't believe your own eyes that the victim is dead.    In contrast, Stephen King can be a hack -- but his best writing is literature and to prove it read his collection of short stories, Everything's Eventual. King makes it clear that human emotion and human fear that we carry with us every day are real, and they matter. And there is definitely a difference between good and evil, and even in The Stand -- a book that could definitely use some editing -- he does a good job of describing how \\"evil\\" people are actually quite human. In order to critically-read King, you have to read read Rene Girard, Mary Douglass, Mary and Herbert Knapp, and Jan Harold Brunvand.     In order to critically-read Life of Pi, read the most illiterate bathroom graffiti you can find.    Nothing prepared me for the level of brutality depicted in this book. If you want to experience the brutality depicted in this book without wasting the time it would take to read it, you could always search the internet for the Daniel Pearl video. Although the writer of this book would tell you that it really doesn't matter whether Daniel Pearl was murdered or merely devoured by a passing column of army ants.    In LOP universe, did Daniel Pearl even die? Who knows? You can't tell? Shrug. Sneer. Pass the tiger feces, the author is hungry. This is the core brutality of this book.
B00005JLEX|5.0|This show about nothing is exactly what most people talk about everyday, yet it's presented in a matter where we are laughing at ourselves with the cast.<br />It's the funniest TV show EVER!
B00009MGQL|3.0|... some nice playing in there, at times, but hardly tasty tunes. Solos alone do not an album make, and although the drum 'n bass and techno backdrops are all well and good, they just aren't very interesting. &quot;There and Back&quot; was the last great record Jeff produced, In My Humble Opinion. Great music and great musicians, and this is, I think, the 3rd album from Mr. Beck in as many years, where we were lucky to get one album per decade in the past. Clearly, the rent has been due, or he's preparing the old pension fund... I won't be buying the next one unless he's got some decent players in there. Must Try Harder.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|They took this album a step up and became a little heavier, and I love it. All the songs are awesome, some of my favs are &quot;Someday&quot; &quot;Because Of You&quot; &quot;Throw Yourself Away&quot; and &quot;See You At The Show&quot; this album is definitely worth checking out.
B000003TAB|5.0|This is probably one of the best Nirvana CDs you can purchase.  You get 15 B-side tracks for under 14.99!  Lets take a look at the tunes shall we...<br />1.Dive.  This is one of my favorite Nirvana songs.  Just can't get that chorus out of your head.  10/10<br />2.Sliver.  Great fast driven song.  10/10<br />3.Stain.  Pretty good.  This is not one of my favorites though.  8/10<br />4.Been A Son.  This song grows and grows on you the more you listen.  Great song.  10/10<br />5.Turnaround.  Good cover of a Devo song.  9/10<br />6.Molly's Lips.  One of my favorites.  Really fast and entertaining.  A cover of a Vaselines song.  10/10<br />7.Son Of A Gun.  This is my favorite song on the album.  A cover of a Vaselines song.  10/10<br />8.(New Wave) Polly.  Interesting song.  Basically a really fast version of Polly.  Not bad at all.  9/10<br />9.Beeswax.  An okay song.  Not much to say.  8/10<br />10.Downer.  This is also on most versions of the Bleach album.  Very fast.  You can't really understand the lyrics, but I like this one.  9/10<br />11.Mexican Seafood.  Pretty good.  Similar to Beeswax, but a little better in my opinion.  8.5/10<br />12.Hairspray Queen.  Very interesting song.  A bit strange.  8.5/10<br />13.Aero Zeppelin.  Not much to say about this one.  8/10<br />14.Big Long Now.  Okay song.  Again not my favorite.  Pretty slow.  8/10<br />15.Aneurysm.  Here we go!  Probably ties with Son Of A Gun for the \\"best song of the album\\" honors.  Just great.  10/10<br />Well there you have it.  If you like Kurt and Nirvana you should pick this up if you don't already have it.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|When I put this CD into my stereo I immediatly felt a sense of insecurity as an artist because I could not imagine making an album close to the intensity of this one. The empowering bsss that supports the slow melodic tune of the song keeps any listener at attention. Not to mention the sudden breaks into a heavier rendition of them that seems to just get you going. No matter what genre you are used to listening to I believe you would love this album.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Well just as the title says. I got this cd the day it came out , and well it is a decent album but sounds more like Tool than A Perfect Circle. So any real fan should enjoy it but if your looking for a cd with Mer De Noms sound to it dont buy this one.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This album is great for anyone, no matter what kind of music you like. There's mellow and heavy parts making it very interesting to listen to. If you're sick of having to keep skiping through songs and you would like to get a cd you can listen to the whole way through, this is it! Also if you haven't picked it up, try out Mer De Noms by A Perfect Circle also.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|...but not how you think....  He touched my soul with his mournful voice that brings to mind honey dripping from a gunshot wound.  But while Maynard's work on this album is as wonderful as anything you'd expect from him(even if it is a bit more subdued than his usual wailings), A Perfect Circle's brilliance shines through from the creative minds of everyone involved.  Billy Howerdel's superb writing and atmospheric guitar melodies sent shivers down my spine.  Joerdie's sort of aggressive flow-bass was a fresh addition to the band after Paz's departure.  And finally Josh Freese and James Iha's interlocking guitar and drum rhythms make ya wanna bob your head like a pop-star.  Its all extremely melodic and extremely wonderful, but the standout track on the album is in my opinion track #3-The Noose.  No song in my recent memory has affected me the way this one did.  I was weeping like a baby as I drove home from Target.  This song also takes the band in a familiar direction that they haven't done as well until this point.  That, for me, denotes a true dedication to growing as artists.<BR>Soooooo....pick up the album kay?<BR>Its reeeeeeaal good......<BR>Bye now.......<BR>dot dot dot dot....
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|geez i didn't think they could be any better at what they do, but they did.  APC's new album is by far one of the best albums i've bought all year, well that and mer de noms, and a couple tool albums, but they all have maynard, who is an amazing lyricist.  they're new album's main theme is about the long periods it takes to get off drum abuse, therefore the slug was their main symbol for the album.  i respect them for making such a personal album, and i expect even better from an already awesome band.
0790733226|5.0|this will happen someday. i hope i'm around for it.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is, without a doubt, the best CD that I have heard in a very long time.  It's one of those rare albums that you can listen to over and over again without skipping any tracks.  It's painfully beautiful, strikingly magical.  Maynard's voice is as hypnotic as the melodies. You need to buy this album.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|If you liked APC's first album, this is a must have. APC still has the same &quot;style&quot; as the first cd, but it is still very different. It is a very artistic cd. When I listen to this cd, my imagination soars. An excellent cd that I can't stop listening to.
B0000AR8NK|1.0|Preface:  I am a die hard Bowie fan.  I've seen The Man at least 10 times in concert (including the &quot;Glass Spider Tour&quot;).  Heck, I've even seen Tin Machine twice.  This is just him phoning it in.  My personal theory is that he is amassing money to build a space colony so he can prolong his life by living in zero gravity.<br />Reality is a weak album, he didn't even try.
B00005V9HH|5.0|This is one of only very few films I have seen in recent years which require total attention from beginning to end. Even then, it must be seen at least once more to gain a sense of its multiple meanings and then again at least several more times to appreciate its complexity and ambiguity. The viewer's patience is abundantly rewarded with thought-provoking entertainment and yet, the question persists: \\"What am I missing?\\" Under Brian Singer's crisp direction, all of the cast's performances are first-rate. Kevin Spacey (as Roger Kint, aptly nicknamed \\"Verbal\\" because he says so much and yet....) received an Academy Award for his performance. Were an Academy Award also given for best ensemble, he and others in the cast would have received it.<br />At one point, Kint suggests that &quot;The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing the world he didn't exist.&quot; That comment offers what I consider to be a useful perspective on the film because so much of what happens (or seems to happen) is unconvincing. I began to wonder, which (if any) of the characters can I trust? Was there really a mobster named Keyser Soze? If so, so what? With especially effective use of flashbacks in coordination with Kint's extended interrogation by NYPD detective Dave Kujan (Chazz Palminteri), Singer seems to be guiding us to one conclusion...only to have another occur, one which left me asking \\"Has all this been a dream? Or is it a practical joke? What am I to believe?\\" Recalling Kint's comment after I saw The Usual Suspects for the first time, I was almost convinced that Singer's \\"greatest trick\\" was that his film \\"didn't exist.\\" Of course it does...and becomes more and less clear every time I see it. Hence this film's elusive but compelling appeal, one which I, at least, am unable to explain in a brief commentary such as this.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This CD was well worth the long wait.  Thirteen Steps is solid all the way through.  This is a cd I would not mind wearing out!
B000002JPA|5.0|After catching the tail end of &quot;Pull Me Under&quot; on MTV back in 1992, I waited and waited until I saw it come on again and taped it.  Afterwards I watched it over and over, realizing how awesome these guys were, and how heavy their sound was.  So, I went out and bought Images and Words.  Boy was I surprised.  At that point in my life I was super into Metallica (the Black album was released one year prior, and I had listened to and owned all Metallica albums that existed at the time), and that was pretty much my musical influence at the age of 17.  When I popped Images and Words in, Pull Me Under came on and I loved it.  Afterwards is where my life-changing experience happened.  I was suddenly introduced to very different music and it caught me off guard.  Another Day, Take the Time, Metropolis... whoa.  What was I listening to?!?!  At first I was resistent and I couldn't keep up with the rapidly changing time signatures and keys, but the more I listened to it, the more I learned to appreciate progressive music, and, being a baby musician at the time, had a HUGE impact on my drumming style.  There was more to life than Lars!  There was Mike Portnoy, who then and forever more will be my biggest drumming influence!  Who, with the rest of the talented guys in the band, inspired me to add more flavor to my music.  If you want to hear some really great, challenging music that makes Rush tuck its tail and run, this is where you should begin.  The only thing I do not like about this album is the fact Portnoy uses drum triggers instead of micing his kit.  That's it.  The following albums remedy this.  My favorite album is Scenes from a Memory, but you should listen to all their albums in chronological order.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|When I first bought this cd I thought that additions of Iha and White were going to drammatically change the groups sound from something wonderful to something ugly. But sure enough apc has another wonderful record. If you haven't bought it yet there is no excuse.<br />Come on what are you waiting for?
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|The follow-up to &quot;Mer De Noms&quot; (Sea of names) was to define which direction A Perfect Circle would travel musically. After the success of the amazing and omnipresent first album, which touched upon every core genre the music world had to offer, I was personally looking forward to this much anticipated sequal, proclamed to be the love child of Maynard and his passion for music. The artist himself was much more involved in the music the second time around, and such devotion shines through in Thirteenth Step's depth and overall beauty. This album, however, stands to define the true fans from those who browsed through &quot;Judith&quot; and &quot;3 Libras&quot;. Slow and mellow songs dabbled with mild pickups are abundant, while Mr. Howerdel's electric guitar becomes a rarity. Those looking for Mer De Noms revisited are in for a rude awakening. Thirteenth Step does, however, whet the appeteites of &quot;Judith&quot; fans with hard rock oriented numbers such as &quot;The Pet&quot;, and &quot;The Outsider&quot;. This album does possess some of the most beautiful peices of music ive ever heard. From &quot;The Noose&quot; to &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; i was infatuated with the depth and flawlessness of this album. I recomned this CD to those who enjoyed the truely beautiful music of Mer De Noms, as this album delivers that and more. For the average APC fan looking for a second opinion, if you loved Brena, Orestes, and 3 Libras this album is for you. Overall a beautiful work of art.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This CD is succeeding in breaking down music walls that have been around for hundreds of years.  Mixed in with the albums beautiful guitars and melodies are tempo changes, and time signatures that popular music especially has never seen.  <br />Most bands these days, when they release a platinum album (Mer De Noms), would just stick to their guns and keep on pace with the next album.  But A Perfect Circle has managed to create an entirely different sound, and an entirely different musical landscape with Thirteenth Step.<br />This is, by far, the best album I have heard in years.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This CD immediately caught my ears when the package came on. The CD flows like no other I have ever heard before. Although it isnt as hard as their first one, Billy and Co. really knew what they were doing. The only thing that kind of threw me off on this album was The Nurse Who Loved Me, when maynard says, &quot;she acts just like a nurse, for all the other guys.&quot; I never thought I would hear Maynard say 'guys' but hey. Either way, this album is defiantly worth buying, and it is a good album for any listening mood.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Man... this if funny... all of you love Linkin Park and the guy who talked how they were just pop-rock likes them... What i don't get, is did you like them whne they were Hybrid Theory? Or Xero? I probaly doubt it... since the guy who called them pop-rock has no life and broke it down for us, i thank him for that. You probaly wasted 30 minutes of your useless life to interpret a CD. Good Game... Seriously... Linkin Park is good... the end.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|not quite as hard as the first one but still an all around good cd. there is so much talent in this group and is reflected in this compilation, prooving that there is more to rock than just crushing riffs, it has a soul too. i look foward to more in the future.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album was everything I'd come to expect from A Perfect Circle and more.  It is a powerful follow-up to Mer de Noms, and picks up where the last album ended.  Big shoes needed to be filled when Paz and Troy left and I think James and Jeordie did an excellent job.  The music sparks a rooted emotion I had forgotten, and the lyrics left an imprint somewhere deep inside me.  Thirteenth Step is not just an album for the die hard fans, it's for everyone.
0440178002|5.0|Shgun was to me the dominating factor in my growing interest in Japan and the Orient. The superb story telling: the love-intrigues, the political arguments, the fearsome battlescenes, and the ever existing feeling of being present in the storyline makes Shgun an excellent piece of reading.  Clavell succeeds to fascinate me time on time again. Tai-Pan (which i recommend as well) also gives the reader an urge to discover further, the depth of the societies he introduces. Though i was very disappointed in Shguns ending regarding the fate of Mariko-san,I can only encourage all who have not read it to read it right away. BUT: remember not to swallow it in one bite; enjoy it's length and reread some passages to furthen the curiosity of what is next.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A beautiful collaboration between raunchy distortion and melodic sonata. The album reveals the full talents of A Perfect Circle as well as their first CD, Mer de Noms, and displays an array of artistic riffs, vocals and poetic lyrics. It almost seems a splice of Maynard's two bands, releasing a complete rush of near anger that one would catch within the songs of TOOL, and soothing the listener with tranquil tune by the next track that A Perfect Circle is prominent for. Thirteenth Step is absolutely worth spending the money for.
B000002KLP|5.0|THIS IS THE ALBUM THAT BROKE PRINCE INTO THE MAINSTREAM (NOT PURPLE RAIN) I WAS LISTENING TO BLONDIE, THE CARS ETC AND WAITING FOR WHEN A BLACK ARTIST WOULD DO SOMETHING NU WAVISH. I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD BE SO FUNKY, SOULFUL, SEXY AND POWERFUL. THIS ALBUM DOESN'T EVEN LAST 40 MINUTES AND THERE'S NO FILLER FROM THE TITLE TRACK TO THE CARS -LIKE \\"WHEN YOU WERE MINE\\" TO THE JAZZ - SOUL LIKE \\"GOTTA BROKEN HEART AGAIN\\", ON SIDE TWO(OPPS) I HAVE THIS ON CD NOW. HE GETS DOWN AND FUNKY NU WAVE STYLE WITH SONGS THAT WOULD MAKE YOU BLUSH, FROM INCEST TO ORAL SEX AND A ANTHEM LIKE \\"PARTYUP\\" PRINCE THROWS THE FUNK DOWN HARD. I TELL PEOPLE THIS ALBUM IS BETTER THAN PURPLE RAIN GET IT NOW!!!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Once again A Prefect Circle brings us a great CD. Each song is powerful and makes you feel like a part of the music!
B000002KMV|4.0|THIS IS MY FAVORITE OF THE EARLY PRINCE ALBUMS IT IS WHERE IS FUSES NU WAVE WITH R&B MUSIC TO FULL EFFECT LONG FUNK JAMS LIKE THE TITLE TRACK TO THE NU WAVE PUNK-FUNK OF \\"SEXUALITY \\"WITH IT'S BRILLIANT GUITAR LINES AND CALL TO ARMS LYRICS AND THE SLOW LOVE GROOVE OF THE CLASSIC \\"DO ME BABY\\" AND SONGS LIKE PRIVATE JOY, THE ROCK OF \\"RONNIE TALK TO RUSSIA\\" THE FUNK OF \\"LET'S WORK\\"<BR>THE ABSTRACTION OF \\"ANNIE CHRSITIAN\\" AND THE BLUES ROCK OF \\"JACK U OFF\\" THIS IS A LITTLE BIT OF OLD PRINCE AND THE COMING OF THE FUTURE AONE ALBUM LATER BUT PEOPLE GET THIS ALBUM IT IS AN UNDERRATED GEM FROM A BIG PRINCE FAN.
B00005JKHN|5.0|I remember when I would watch this movie a countless number of times when I was younger and now that I am older I appreciate the movie more than ever. It is the last fairytale that Walt Disney helped create and for his last fairytale, it is stunning. The animation is very modern for 1959 and very detailed. The story is wonderful, with the typical Disney ending of good conquering evil and true love winning out. It is a great movie and I highly recommend it.
0316666343|3.0|This book, which came highly recommemded from critics, is a highly creative novel dealing with death, grief, and the necessity of letting go.  It's told by the lively Susie Salmon, someone who is dead by the end of the first chapter.  She tells her story from a heaven of sorts, looking down on her family and charting their grief and gradual acceptance of her death.  Amazingly, even with this subject matter, the book is never depressing, never too somber.  I liked it, but I think I came into it expecting too much--thanks in large part to the glowing reviews.  It didn't quite deliver, especially with the ending.     It seemed like the author wanted to take a complex subject, which she at first dealt with fairly, and wrap it up in a neat little box with a bow on top. That is not to say I don't recommend it.  I do.  Just don't expect a masterpiece.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|This is a great DVD tribute to Walt Disney's first animated feature film! All the galleries and special features are wonderful and the movie itself is a great story. I recommend this for any Disney fan.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|this album, I think,is a great album . However it was extremely different in some aspects from the first. Maynard is my favorite musician however I will say I think with his input he tried to put a little to much TOOL into A Perfect Circle .It's a little more electronic which I like but it definatly lacks the certain catchiness of the last album. I recommend listening to the album 2 or 3 times before making any final decisions on what you think of it. It's kind of an aquired taste deal. However, all in all I liked it a lot and will stand by A Perfect Circle as they develope . I just hope thier next album is a little more catchy.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The compilation of music and the carressing vocals of Maynard James Keenan are absolutely mindblowing. This album will saturate your mind and &quot;soul&quot; and consume you. This is another example of what happens when you put 5 very talented artists together. The results are absolutely amazing.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|People need to realize that Billy Howerdel writes most if not all of A Perfect Circles music. In essance it is HIS band ..NOT Maynards. or the first album Mer De Noms Maynard simply sang the words and never even touched the musical aspect. He had a little more say in this album ,however, hence the reason this album has a VERY TOOL feel to it. I love Maynard , Tool is my favorite band, but as far as A Perfect Circle goes Maynard does not deserve all the credit he gets just because he has a big name. Billy took years and years of his life in writing the first album hence the reason it was utterly amazing.People need to do thier reserch before they just go off and write some rediculous uniformed review because they burned Weak And Powerless onto a CD off thier Kazaa and listen to it 80 tiems in a row while thinking,&quot;Oh yeah, I'm cool now.&quot; Please, it's not the only song on the CD.And for all of you who think Thirteenth Step is great but haven't heard any other A Perect Circle , get Mer De Noms...It'll blow you away.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|You can't compare this CD to the first one, it's a different band with new views and new motives in writting. This album has more of a classical turn towards the songs... The songs have a wide varity of sounds that just make you smile. Don't get me wrong they still have some songs that have their power cords, but also have violin's added to them as well to add that special something to the song. The quality of the CD has got to be one of the best that I have heard in a long time. <br />So if you are looking for some progressive metal with hard riff's in it, then turn to TooL, but if you are looking for something to sit down, relax and smile too, then get this album.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album has A Perfect Circle style all over it! it's got a perfect mixture of acoustics to vocals and Maynard always has some knowlege to share in his lyrics. I highly reccomend this for ALL music lovers!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|A Perfect Circle blueprints an even bigger and more intensely emotional map with the long-awaited second album 'Thirteenth Step'. From the beginning track 'The Package' with Maynard playing the narrative of a soulless consumer of any kind by singing lines such as &quot;Because clever got me this far, then tricky got me in, get just what I came for, then I'm out the door again.&quot; to 'Gravity', the revisionistic end track that serves as almost an epilogue to the songs in this album, as if they were all visual sequences or part of a storybook. A Perfect Circle's first album 'Mer De Noms' ended with an exhausted sigh from Maynard, the highly talented lead singer but with the musical maturity that this band has showed by creating this album, the &quot;I choose to live.&quot; which concludes 'Gravity', is spoken in a stable manner, as to show that this band is now a permanent staple to the lives of it's band members and to the lives of it's fans and will no longer be seen as just a simple 'side-project'. Buy this album for the sake of giving it a good, through and toughtful listen because with all the character and content that it holds, that is the treatment that this cd deserves.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|APC has certainly come a long way with Thirteenth Step!<br />Thirteenth Step far exceeds the bands previous Mer de Noms (which was pretty good in it's own right).<br />The opening track (The Package), starts a simple haunting guitar riff over some distant lo-fi drums. Jeordie then makes himself known with an equally haunting bass line while Josh's drums move in. Maynard then expresses his vocals as only Maynard can. All very silky..then...it rocks..then back to silky.<br />This sets the stage for the remainder of the adventure.<BR>With so many changiing moods and textures you simply can't get bored of this CD.<BR>The music and words really couldn't get much better, backed by amazing recording and production.<br />I have been intently listening to music for longer than I care to admit and I do a great deal of recording in my little project studio - so I am not one to spew forth &quot;fan stuff&quot; at the drop of a hat. Thirteenth Step has more than impressed me enough to take the time to write these comments.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Yes boys and girls thats what this cd is all about. something sweet for you ears to process. Maynard James Keenan shows off his amazing vocals, and the talent of the bands on these instruments is just mind numbing. The whole cd is really good but I get trapped on the first 3 alot but it's not 2 good songs and the rest of them fillers. you guys know what I mean.

0783225849|5.0|In 1998, Gus Van Sant remade this classic with Viggo Mortenson, Anne Heche, and Vince Vaughn.  He used basically the same camera angles, the same dialogue, and even the same sets.  The only real noticable changes were the film's being shot in color, and the inferiority of the cast.  The obvious question is-- why remake a movie that really cannot be improved on?<br />I don't know.  But I do know that Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is one of the best spine chillers in film history.  The cast is excellent.  Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is one of the screen's most noted achievements.  Janet Leigh was the only real name at the time of this film.  Since she is killed about 40 minutes into the movie, Hitchcock forced theater managers to not allow patrons into the movie after the starting time.  Otherwise, they may not see the star they came to see.  <br />Naturally, this had the effect of huge lines down the street to see this film.  The story is basic.  Marion Crane (Leigh) steals 40,000 dollars to help her boyfriend (John Gavin) with his alimony so they can get married.  On the way to see him, she stops at a motel for the night.  The manager gives her the key and offers her a meal.  They talk for a while and she says she is tired and is going to bed.  She goes back to the room and gets into the shower and then...<br />If you don't know what happens after that, you obviously are not too familiar with movies.  This shower murder is possibly the most famous screen killing in movie history.  After the death of Leigh, the film switches to a search for her and the money involving a P.I (Martin Balsam) and Leigh's sister (Vera Miles)<br />One of the reasons this movie is so great is the way Hitchcock plays with and manipulates your emotions.  Take the classic example right after &quot;Mother&quot; has murdered Leigh.  Perkins cleans up the room, and throws all Leigh's stuff into her car.  He pushes the car into the pond.  The car sinks about 2/3 of the way and then stops.  At this point the audience feels panic that the car won't sink all the way and that Perkins will be caught.  We switch our allegiance to Norman away from Marion and don't even know it.<br />When I heard about the imminent remake of this movie I shuddered.  I knew the actors, especially Vaughn, would have no chance to succeed here.  I went to see it and of course it was awful.  If you want to see this film, see it from the master.  The new version is a shoddy joke.
B00006879E|2.0|Their single \\"Harder to Breathe\\" is a great song and I love it so I thought I would like some of their other songs, but I was disappointed. Some of the other songs seem way too pop for me and seem totally different from \\"Harder to Breathe.\\" I wasn't impressed.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Another perfect CD from A Perfect Circle. Thirteenth Step is completely mesmorizing! This phenomenal piece of work has taken me to heaven and back! Incredible arrangements, brilliant guitars and lyrics that pierce your soul!  Billys brilliance, Maynards beautiful vocals and Josh's heartfelt pounding of the &quot;wardrums&quot; never cease to amaze me! Although I absolutely love the whole cd, a few of my favorite tracks are &quot;The Outsider&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot; , &quot;The Noose&quot; and &quot;Pet&quot;. Many heartfelt thanks for sharing your talents with the music world and I definitely look forward to the future.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This cd is so good.  Anything maynard has anything to do with is great. Nothin he does is bad.  Anyone who wants something different from the horrible music that is being played today (good charlotte , simple plan) buy this cd
B000050IE6|1.0|This has to be one of the least enjoyable listening experiences I've ever had in my life. I want my money back. Just horrible, boring, lame, uninspired music.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|In Short and sweet review of this violent western epic, to me this is a great film to watch, and the music is HOT!!  Whoops, did I mention the word violent, eh?   Well dear friends, the old west days were not all \\"sugar & spice with every thing nice\\" and NO \\"tip toe thru the tulips\\", was not to be had in that xtreme violent times of yore!  Both ' The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly ' and this film are very real, as real as it can be.
B000050IE6|1.0|What is this? I actually fell asleep twice during this album. People rave about this group? This is just plain embarrissing. There is not one memorable moment on this album. Opeth should really just disband and hide in shame, or at the least offer refunds. I mean, this was just painful to sit through.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I usually disagree with many reviews.  To me, it seems like reviewers are much to easy on the artist, maybe thinking that their review will be more highly received or something.  When I first listened to this album, I was ready to write a review ripping it to shreds.  I was frustrated at all those who said give it some time - it will grow on you.  However, because I did not have time to write a review and because the CD has been in my car playing continuously, I must reluctantly agree that others were right in their assessment.  Its better after 3 or 4 listens.<br />The reason why it takes a few listens to get into this album is because its different, and it takes a while for you to figure that out and appreciate the difference instead of being unsatisfied at not getting a Tool replica or a repeat of Perfect Circle's fist album. If your looking for a Tool sound, or, even a repeat of Mer de Noms, your not going to get what you want. However, if your looking for something different, or at least willing to listen to something different, then you will probably enjoy this album. <br />I cant give it 5 stars because that level is reserved for exceptional, groundbreaking albums cause one to redefine what they think it is that they like about music.  This album is not that. However, its a solid 4 because it has new and interesting sounds and style from very talented people.
B000050IE6|2.0|Just quit now. I can't believe I fell for the reviews and bought this piece of junk.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|This new CD is better then their previous CDs in my opinion. The songs are well written and sound great. Do this anymore, Believe it or not, Because of you, ROCK. Should've listened is one of my favorites. Chad howls like only he can on this song. This song perfectly reflects what can happen if you don't listen to that significant other. A must have album for Nickelback fans!!
0783226160|5.0|National Lampoon's Animal House was released in 1978 by universal studios.  John Landis directed this rated R,109 minute film, that was made in color.  The films leading actor was John Belushi who played the role of Bluto.  Other notable stars from this film Tim Matheson as Otter,  Tom Hulce as Pinto, Cesare Danova as The Mayor, Peter Riegert as Boon, Stephen Furst as Flounder, Karen Allen as Katy, Kevin Bacon as Chip,  and Donald Sutherland as Professor Jennings.  In 1979 this film won the peoples choice award for favorite non-musical motion picture.  <br />Summary:  John Belushi and cast are great.  They go from one great reason to another to drink and party.  They stay in constant trouble with Dean Wormer and the boys from the Omega House.  Then they have the party to end all parties, did someone say toga?  All through the 1980's frat parties would never be the same.  Add a great road trip, a some fun at the town parade and you have a great movie.  If you have never seen this movie and you like to laugh, you owe it to your self to pick this one up.  Look for Kevin Bacon in his first big part, \\"Thank you sir my I have another.\\" Great movie one to buy do not rent, you will want to see again and again.
B0000009S3|5.0|A few months ago, I bought this CD on a whim.  I hadn't heard much about it, and the one Zappa album I had bought (Playground Psychotics) was godawful.<BR>Boy am I glad that I'm a compulsive spender.  Almost every song on it is perfect.  Willie the Pimp is the best song on here, Captain Beefheart's singing (the only singing on the whole album) is some of the most aggressive and primal sounds ever put onto vinyl.  Peaches en Regalia is the most effective song Zappa has ever done.  The tune surfaces in my mind every once in a while, and I have stop whatever I'm doing and give it my copmlete attention.  This has caused numerous car accidents.<BR>This would definitely be the one album I'd bring on a desert island.  I'd play Willie the Pimp until the coconuts shook off the trees. It's guaranteed to make your foot tap and brighten your mood.  <BR>Worth every penny, Buy It.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Well there are only a few artists that I KNOW will be on point so I go and buy their cds w/o even hearing a track (Mary J. Blige, Dead Prez, and Outkast to name a few).  Badu is most definitely on that list.  This album is so different and so beautiful too.  A brotha like me can imagine starting off a Saturday morning bumping this feel good music.  Without a doubt this is a INSPIRATIONAL cd.  Think outside the box. DON'T BE SCURRRRRRRRED!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This CD obviously needs no justification. If you liked Mer De Nom, you will indeed love this one. Upon the first listen, the most obvious upgrades seem to be in terms of overdubs [according to my ears, considerably more so than their previous effort]. The song structures, overall, seem to be more dynamic; with lots of odd time signatures. The moods are really consistent and otherworldly, yet familiar; and everything seems to effortlessly fall into the perfect space. There are some really odd sonic textures on this one [due in part to the introduction of the irish bassoon and electric banjo to the band], and it sounds like they used more effects than before. The vocals are obviously excellently done, as with anything Maynard does. I think the whole vibe of this CD is more uplifting than the last, with more of a progressive element, but not so much so that the CD loses atmosphere. There are lots of vocal overdubs. The sound quality in general is quite impressive considering what's going on underneath it all. Things sound pretty diverse on this one seeing as how it's only their second. The lyrics, from what I could decipher, are really good, symbolic interpretations and the artwork is pretty kick-ass, too. I have, however, only listened to this CD maybe seven times since buying it, so this review is not very comprehensive, but it is only an opinion anyway, so go buy the damn CD and listen to it for yourself [or else you can keep listening to the nu-metal noise you've been listening to, you unevolved vermin].
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Overall I think this is an awesome album.  The melodies and lyrics are beyond comparison and Maynard proves once again that he really can sing.  I will warn those that may come in contact with this record that, not only did it take about 3 listens to REALLY grow on me, it is not your typical TOOL album.  Or, for that matter, if you are expecting another Mer De Noms you are not going to get it here.  What you will get is pure genius.  It is music for people who really know it, not for the casual radio rock listener.  Thirteenth Step is not made for people who know TOOL and APC for their radio hits.  This record is dark and gloomy and caries a brutally masochistic theme.  It is full of pleasure in all its pain.  Lyrically speaking, it is typical TOOL/APC.  Any song can be interpreted a thousand ways and this album finds a way to relate to everyone on any level.  It explores the depths of fear and addiction in brilliant melodies that alternate between hard and soft but mostly get pulled back onto the gentile side.  Some may call this album soft, again, if you are looking for TOOL like riffs and rock outs you will not find them here.  If you are looking for insanely talented and well thought out lyrics and musical compositions this is for you.  My advice is to give it a few listens and open your mind.  It truly is another \\"step\\" in the right direction for music.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The Thirteenth Step is definitely wonderful, and we all must bask in A Perfect Circle's glory.  Although it is much different from Mer de Noms, variety and change are the spice of life.  I recommend that anyone and everyone buy it for you will enjoy it, and if you don't you are obviously delusional and need to be put away for good.
B000002H33|5.0|THIS CD ROCKS NEX TO METALLICA'S ...AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. MY FAV. SONG IS MASTER OF PUPPETS. IF YOU LIKE OTHER METALLICA ALBUMS GET THIS.OBEY YOUR MASTER AND BUY IT!!!!! MY ALL YIME FAV METALLICA SONG IS ONE, BUT THAT'S MY OPINION. NOW....... GET stop reading this ...
B00008H2LB|5.0|I still can't decide which album is better, Meteora or Hybrid Theory. Linkin Park sounds more mature with the lyrics in Meteora and truly bring out the truth without using vague curses, likewise with Hybrid Theory yet they weren't as strong or out of the box with their first album.<BR>01 Foreward- Sweet Intro, you can't tell the difference when this track slides into Don't Stay<BR>02 Don't Stay- Awesome song, great bass, great lyrics, lets you know that there is alot of awesome things to look forward to on this CD<BR>03 Somewhere I Belong- SWEET combination and a perfect for the first single, it tells about what some people feel at sokme point in there life, a song that I'll listen to for years to come<BR>04 Lying From You- Hahn does an awesome job in this song and the beat goes along well with the words, all in all, great song<BR>05 Hit The Floor- Interesting from the start, keeps you attached to the speakers, raps awesome with the background, goes along very well<BR>06 Easier To Run- a slower, softer song(compared to the others) yet not dissapointing at all, something to hang around, chill, and just listen to<BR>07 Faint- Overall, one of the best songs on the album, I'll listen to this song on repeat, it'll stick with you and its something to really jump too, the beat goes so well and Mike and Chester just fit so well with it<BR>08 Figure.09- Fun song, pretty cool guitar and some neat drumming, Mike's rapping goes along very well, the rapping and screaming just fit... very cool song<BR>09 Breaking The Habit- Another song similar to Easier To Run except more upbeat and driven, awesome song that Chester shows his somewhat quieter side on, not as much screaming but its a song you can't miss on the CD<BR>10 From the Inside- The beggining is hooking, the cresendo sounds awesome and the background is cool, the lyrics flow with it and its another quieter song, but very cool still<BR>11 Nobody's Listening- One of the best, right up there with Faint, sweet japanese flute,the beat and drumming...just..oogle over it and the Lyrics...oh the lyrics are very cool and easy to understand, this is a song I will play for a loooooong time on repeat<BR>12 Session- Matches the album's sound and sounds very cool, a neat little song, everything goes well and this is just a very cool track I love to listen to<BR>13 Numb- One of my very favorite on this album, emotional, hits you deep down and just sounds awesome, makes you want to sing along with it (which you can do, lyrics are easy) You just find yourself singing to it, Chester shows the softer side of his voice and Mike's voice just flows with Chester's, they match very well and Chester really blows you away with the changes he makes.<br />This is and will be a great album to listen to for a long time, I can't wait until their next album, I encourage everyone to go out there and Buy Meteora, sweet cd, something to love for years to come, songs that anyone can relate to whether 12 or 40!
B00003CXB4|4.0|Great DVD but you get a little tired of how Disney plays the marketing game.  First, a few years ago they release most of their animated features on DVD with no real spectacular added features.  But the kids have to have them.  Then they go into \\"moritorium\\" so you can't buy them for awhile.  Now they come out with the same animated features with all the bells and whistles so you have to buy these DVDs to make your kids happy.<BR>How many versions of the Lion King, etc. are their going to be?
0553062182|5.0|Until picking up this book, I had always felt different from others, but didn't understand why.  I reacted &quot;strangely&quot; to normal situations, deeply appreciated alone time, and was bothered by things others didn't even notice.  My high sensitivity was a joke with my friends. I mean, who &quot;needs&quot; to sleep on flannel or 300+ thread count sheets, with ear plugs, and block all light just to get a decent nights sleep?  This book has helped me to understand that my reaction to the world around me is not something to be ashamed of.  Now that I understand what the difference is I am learning, not to ignore my &quot;strange&quot; way of reacting, but to be sensitive to it and respond in a positive way.  Thank you, Elaine, for helping me understand myself more deeply.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Fans of Maynard James Keenan are arguing whether A Perfect Circle sounds &quot;too much like Tool&quot;.  A Perfect Circle fans are trying to decide which album is better, &quot;Mer Des Noms&quot; or &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;.  Whilst both comparisons are natural, in both cases, stop!  APC are not Tool.  This is why their name is not Tool!  Yes, we hear the same voice, but if One were to LISTEN to the music of both bands, One would realise this is where the similarity ends.  As for the APC albums, they are seperate bodies of work and should be treated as such.<br />When you put on a record and it completely envelopes you emotionally, making you want to put it back on and experience that emotion again, you have heard a good record.  So it is with &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; APC have created a true masterpiece. From the opening slow-burner that is &quot;The Package&quot; to the final moment of the gloriously serene &quot;Gravity&quot;, APC have created what has to be one of the most beautiful, not to mention unique, albums of the year.<br />Seeing these guys live is an experience I cannot recommend enough.  The lineup change does not weaken them one bit.  In fact, if anything, it only strengthens them.  James Iha works his little miracles alongside Billy Howerdel on guitar.  In Jeordie White we see a superb bassist, who, in my opinion, seems a lot more comfortable (and exciting) than he ever was in Marilyn Manson.  Driving all of this is Josh Freese, an extremely tight and innovative drummer.  Alongside this great musicianship, we have the talent of Maynard, whose voice contains so much intensity, it is hard not to feel a chill run up your spine and your eyes glaze over with tears merely at the sound of it.  He doesn't just sing the words; he captures the emotion those words entail perfectly.<br />So if you're reading these reviews out of curiosity, do yourself a favour and go and buy this album, along with &quot;Mer Des Noms&quot;, their debut.  Have your soul touched in a way it may never have been before.  When you can write and perform songs such as, &quot;The Noose&quot;, &quot;Pet&quot; and &quot;The Outsider&quot;, no comparisons should be necessary.  Just enjoy all this band has to offer.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is the second for A Perfect Circle, and they have new members. Even though all the original members aren't back for the second album, the music is still pretty awesome. Maynard's lyrics are amazing, as well as the rest of the bands work. I would recommend it to any person that is looking for new music to listen to. My favorite songs are, &quot;Pet&quot; and &quot;The Noose&quot;.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Fans of Maynard James Keenan are arguing over whether A Perfect Circle sounds too much like Tool.  Fans of APC are trying to decide which album, &quot;Mer Des Noms&quot; or &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, is better.  In both cases, stop!  <br />APC is not Tool, this is why their name is not Tool!  Yes, we hear the same voice, but if one is to actually LISTEN to the music of both bands, one would notice that this is where the similarity pretty much ends.  As for the albums, for some people, the band simply can't win.  To make a second &quot;Mer Des Noms&quot; would have been labeled &quot;boring&quot; and &quot;non-progressive&quot;, but to do what they have done, creating a different sound, an album with a different feel, some are calling &quot;unsatisfying&quot;.  Both albums are seperate bodies of work and should be treated as such. <br />In &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; APC have created an incredibly moving, not to mention unique, work of art.  When you put on a record and are totally emotionally enveloped by it, making you want to hear it again, you have heard a good record.  So it is with &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;, from the opening slow-burner that is &quot;The Package&quot; to the closing moment of the gloriously serene album-closer, &quot;Gravity&quot;, that APC take us in and cause an effect that is heavenly and that, at times, cannot be described in words.<br />Seeing this band live is an experience I cannot recommend enough.  The lineup change does not weaken the band one bit, if anything, in fact, it strengthens it.  James Iha works wonderfully alongside Billy Howerdel on guitar and we see in Jeordie White a magnificent bassist who, in my own opinion, seems more comfortable (and more exciting) than he ever was in Marilyn Manson.  Josh Freese is an extremely tight and innovative drummer and, alongside all this great musicianship, we get to enjoy the talent ot Maynard, whose voice is full of such intensity, it is difficult not to feel a chill run up your spineand your eyes glaze over with tears just at the sound of it.  He doesn't just sing the words; he captures the emotion of the words in his voice perfectly. <br />So if you are reading these reviews out of curiosity, do yourself a favour; go out and buy &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot; and their debut &quot;Mer Des Noms&quot;, two quite different, but equally as wonderful albums.<br />When you can write and perform songs such as &quot;The Noose&quot;, &quot;Pet&quot; and &quot;The Outsider&quot;, no comparisons should be necessary.  Just enjoy all this band has to offer.
B000066C8G|4.0|easily the best comedy since tommy boy. loved it. if you're into 'highbrow' humour don't bother. these one star reviewers just don't get it.
B000002OX5|5.0|If you're a Who fan, or a fan of true sixties psychedelia, you MUST have this album. <br />Shawn
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Perfect Circle is the side projcet of Maynard, the lead singer from the rock band Tool.  This is his seccond album with Perfect Circle, and beleive me it does not dissapoint.  From the opening cords and expiremental use of his vocal range on The Package to the closing bars of Gravity, the band takes you on an exciting musical journey.  The vocal and musical accompaniment are masterfuly mixed.  Give this album a listen; you won't be dissapointed!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle have outdone themselves. The sophmore effort from the band has made their first album seem like nothing at all. This album is much more than I expected and I had very high expectations for it. <br />P.S. The live show is incredible and the new members add even more to the package than imaginable. A Perfect Circle is at this moment in time just that, Perfect.
6304806418|1.0|This was a truly dreadful musical.  It shouldn't be surprising it was a flop. The one surprising thing I discovered was that Banderas can both act and sing.  Or perhaps he wasn't acting, he was just being himself.  In any event, he would do better to act as he did in this movie, rather than the usual cartoon like characters he plays.  There was far too much of Madonna's off-key wailing for my liking.  It's a pity my DVD doesn't have a button to filter her out.  The musical might have been watchable if it had one.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Gets some getting used to but after the first 2 minutes I fell in love. The cd is off the hook and the thing I love about it is that it's not an 18 track cd. 10 tracks is all you need. I know most of the songs already and I bought it on saturday. Go get it!!!
0385504209|1.0|This novel reminds me of a cheap, low production TV mini-series.  Distill out the historical data and references and print them in a pamphlet of probably 10 pages.  The rest of the book:  characters, story line, writing style, use of vocabulary is absolutely pathetic.  It's written at the level of an 8th grader.  Well, if Mr. Brown is writing for the masses, than at least he has this point right on; seeing how the average reading ability in the U.S rivals that of an 8th grader.  Overall, don't waste your time.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|'Mer De Noms' captivated me with its unique sound. With their debut, A Perfect Circle brought a true heartfelt melodic fashion back to a soulless music scene.  This different look at what music could truly be is what sucked me completely into their music.  The sophomore effort has been, for me, one of the most anticipated albums since they set the standard with that 2000 release.<br />'Thirteenth Step' has delivered everything that I expected from the band and more. The passion that each member has for music is defiantly reflected in the album and the way it was put together. From 'The Package' to 'Gravity' each step taking you in and filling you with its melodic and tranquil romance through the deep base and impeccable lyrics in strategic timing only to leave you yearning for more, forcing you to start the disk again. I can't say a bad thing about any of the songs on this disk, not one. <br />I bought the album over a week ago and I haven't stopped listening to it yet. It hasn't gotten old and is not like a lot of other bands lately where only a few songs are listenable and you have no idea what the rest is.  Maynard and Billy deliver once again.  Adding Jeordie and James to the lineup has been flawless transition and even a boost to the depth of the band and music. <br />APC proves that there first album wasn't a fluke, they have something raw and unbridled, the progression that developed in their second release is what will surely set them apart from the previous or other bands that each member has been involved with. &quot;Just ignore the smoke and smile&quot; [from Blue, TS]. It's already become an instant classic in my CD collection.  I look forward to the many experiences I shall have while listening to this album, as I know there will be many.  Thanks Billy, Timmy, Jeordie, James and Josh, can wait to see you live.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I bought this cd the day it came out and I can't stop listening to it. &quot;The Package&quot; is an excellent opening song and &quot;Gravity&quot; is a great closing song. The whole entire cd just flows as one, once you put on the first song, you just listen to the whole album. I think this album is just as good, if not better than Mer De Noms. I definetly recommend you purchasing this.
B000002UB6|5.0|the album that is about to be released &quot;let it be: naked&quot; or something like that is not a new thing for beatles bootleg collectors such as myself. Here you'll se the songs as they were intended to be: sweet ballads from Paul, raw songs from John and a beautiful song from George. Ringo does not sing one song but plays in them. The most beautiful part is that it is spector free. The thing with spector is that he tried to turn the Beatles into the Ronnettes but it just didn't work out. Why not? Because it is the Betles we're talking about for God's sake! This was a very difficult time for them so to hear a new &quot;let it be&quot; the way they intended it to be will be for some, phenomenal and for some, not so good. Still this was the first album i ever got so that's why i love it so much. The Beatles made me become a musician and it's because of them that i know there's still beautiful things to experience and see and feel in this world.<BR>Let it be is a very good album when you erase all the spector stuff. You'll listen and the understand what i'm talking about!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I was anticipating this cd and to my luck I was not disappointed at all! I'm glad apc took their time...even if it was a rather long wait.  I encourage anyone who is thinking about buying this should. It is great lying in your bed on a Sunday morning cd, or in your car cd, or cleaning your house cd. I love it all....except THE NURSE SONG. I have nothing against what he's trying to say but its too forced or something. I usually just skip over that. Please buy it.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|I ENJOY sitting on my couch and listening to this record.  That can't be said about too many records these days.  I hate it when people over analyse and try to compare it to albums he did decades ago. No it won't be remembered with his great albums, but who cares?  If you have enjoyed Bowie's last few efforts (&quot;Heathen&quot; &amp; &quot;Hours&quot;) this one should be no different.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Mer de Noms I still believe is the quintessential &quot;rock&quot; album. Thirteenth Step's exploration into the darker side of the human psyche, and explore it does. &quot;The Package&quot; reminds me of the Tool's &quot;The Grudge&quot;, yet is WWWAAAAYYY better. Other notable songs include &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, and &quot;Gravity&quot;. My favorite track was &quot;Pet&quot;, almost sounds like this albums &quot;Judith&quot;. This is an excellent cd and I recommend all to buy it.  Only downfall...doesn't even clock in at an hour.
B00005JLEU|1.0|There is already much being said about this film that, and I may not be able to say anything that hasn't already been said before. Many give it praise for being a well animated \\"Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass\\" tale. It's good for children that can count their age on two hands because in Miyazaki movies, children are heroes. Kids will like Spirited Away and others such as Totoro for that. As for anyone who ever \\"was 10 years old\\" as Miyazaki says, be more wary. It is at heart a children's film that could have easily been produced by Disney. It's popularity perpetuates the myth that cartoons are for children, thereby making it difficult to take seriously (for most of the general public) to take as \\"higher art.\\"
0385504209|2.0|I was not impressed at all with The Da Vinci Code. It simply boiled down to a classic chase yarn with a well-researched MacGuffin. Mr. Brown's exposition was clumsy, and his action was contrived. Chapters concerning Bishops and Policemen seem only present as an excuse to end the previous chapter on an obvious and awkward cliff-hanger.  Aside from one or two clever ideas, Mr. Brown simply has created brain-teasers for his characters to solve, and we must wait for his characters to solve them. Most of the interesting concepts and histories in the book seem to have come from other books, which Mr. Brown has condensed, simplified, and regurgitated. For example, the unwieldy and unnecessary exposition regarding the Golden Ratio goes into just enough detail to where we understand only that Mr. Brown understands it, but not enough detail (specific examples? the fact that it's an irrational number?  where does it show up in the UN building or in Mozart's music?) to where the information is actually useful. &quot;Donald in Mathmagic Land&quot; does a much better job explaining the Golden Ratio than Mr. Brown. It is as though he underestimates the intelligence of the average reader. I realize that the characters are under a lot of pressure, and cannot spend hours telling the entire history of the politics of Christianity to each other, but why could Mr. Brown have not had a separate, isolated chapter with enough detail to where I feel like I've actually learned something? A bibliographical appendix would be most welcome.
0930289234|5.0|This is perhaps the most important comic book mini series in the modern era. Sweeping and epic, the effect of watchmen on the industry was profound, if not too profound for Alan Moore's liking. The History Channel featured this among other &quot;graphic novels&quot; in the documentary &quot;Comic Book Superheroes Unmasked.&quot; Read Watchmen because it's remarkable literature, because it deconstructs the idea of superheroes, and because it'll make you think.
B00008PW2E|5.0|the first season is a perfect introduction to the fisher family.  in the second season everyone is explored more thoroughly and true colors really begin to show.  this is particularly evident in the relationship between nate and brenda.  what happens here is totally unbelievable and you find yourself after each episode what the hell are these two doing together.  when you watch the series also bookmark the episode where nate travels to seattle and visits and old friend because it has serious implications in the third series.  the relationship between david and keith grows and demolishes in this season but it makes for good dramedy.  claire just gets cooler with every season, and i love her to death because she is so strong but she is also so vulnerable at the same time.  she really becomes more of an adult in this season and we see her start to deal with the adult world and real life and i realize that her ascent into adulthood is very close to actual reality.  ruth maintains her stealy outside through most of the season but you see her start to break out a little and try knew things.  she begins to date even more this season and it just makes her so interesting.  there are so many twists and turn in the second season that it just keeps you wanting more.  the fight between nate and brenda is awesome and has been building the whole season.  and then there is the cliffhanger ending episode that just makes you want the third season to come right after you finish watching the second season.  you really want to know what happens to nate and the first episode of the third season will really throw everyone for a loop....i swear.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I got this CD the day it came out (pre-ordered). After how much I loved the first CD - playing it over and over until I had to buy a new one - I couldn't wait for the second. I popped it in my computer to play and, honestly, at first I was like, &quot;It's just not the same, as magical as first one.&quot; (Orestes is definatly my fav song off first album.) All I have to say is listen to it all the way through a second time before you judge. Then a 3rd and 4th and 5th . . . &quot;Vanishing&quot;, amazing, magical, &quot;Pet&quot;, gives me chills! Great job APC! Definatly recommended.
6305609705|5.0|1-Francis Ford Coppola, <BR>At the height of his creative genuis, and with films like The Conversation, Godfather 1&amp; 2 to his credit, he was considered to be one of the few directors/auteurs,one responsible for enriching American Cinema and lifting it to new artistic heights to this day<BR>2-Brando..Brando..Brando..<BR>He was paid millions to appear just for a short time at the end of the movie, and he is worth every single penny/cent and more. Forget his speech in the opening of Godfather, as great and classic as it is, the 'Horror' speech still gives me a chill down my spine, one of the most haunting speeches in cinema history.<BR>3-Vietnam<BR>With Deer Hunter, Apocalypse Now is the best film that dealt with the Vietnam war, and how it slowly affected the hearts and minds of some of its soldiers, pushing them into the darkest recesses of the human soul.<BR>4-Scenes<BR>There are many memorable scenes in Apocalypse Now, but few have forever stuck in my mind, the Helicopters attack with Wagner's music playing, and the tiger jumping out of nowhere in the dense jungle, though short was totally unexpected and scary.<BR>5-Actors<BR>Martin Sheen, Robert Duvall, Frederic Forrest, Dennis Hopper, Larry Fishburn,all giving 100% and more for Coppola.<BR>6-Joseph Conrad<BR>John Milius and Coppola adapted Conrad's novel, and though Africa became Vietnam, the spirit of the book was not compromised in any way, one of the very few who devled into the darkness of the human soul.<BR>7-The making of Apocalypse Now, appropriately named 'Heart Of Darkness' is the most interesting making of documentary ever filmed. Done by Coppola's wife Eleanor, it brilliantly manages to be personal yet detached and objective, and captures in intimate details the creative process and the difficulties that it encountered with the heart attack (Martin Sheen), near nervous breakdown (Coppola),and logistic problems (with Phillipines army).<BR>8-DVD<BR>Though short on Extras, it is of excellent quality<BR>9-Music<BR>With a combination of classical and original score, the music expresses and complements perfectly each scene.The soundtrack CD is a must buy too, since it also includes extracts from dialogue (including the 'Horror' speech)<BR>10-Movie Library<BR>If you are serious about starting a movie collection or enhancing your present one, then Apocalypse Now is what a 'movie collection' is meant for, a rich and rare film, the product of a time when directors and actors had personal visions great talent, and the free hand to translate it on screen and share it with cinema lovers worldwide.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|i have waited for a perfect circle's second installment for a long, long time, and believe you me, it was worth the wait.  maynard's lyrics, steeped in the pain, apology, regret, and hopefulness of an addict (of so many things).  this able made me feel emotions akin to that of &quot;orestes&quot; off of mer de noms.  buy this, not for a comparison to mer de noms, because they are totally different entities, but for a view of the band that is different, changed by the life lived.  standouts include &quot;the observer,&quot; &quot;blue,&quot; and &quot;the noose.&quot;
B00005JKC3|2.0|ive been a hulk fan since the mid 80s. collected the comic for awhile and ive seen just about every version of the hulk-from stupid and green to smart and grey.  hes always been my favorite comic hero.<br />this movie is overall not what it should have been. anyone who is a fan of the comic would agree that the movie really didnt capitalize on what makes the hulk such a cool character.  that is the fact that hes insanely strong, almost indestructible and gets into huge brawls with other superpowered bad... <br />this movie had some of the weakest action ive ever seen. i mean, whos brillant idea was it to make him fight some [mad] dogs?! why did it take 45 mins for the hulk to come out? why didnt he fight some other supervillian like the abomination, now that would have been seriously cool if done right. oh yea and what the holy hell was up with the end sequence and the lake?! that was just plain confusing and ridiculous.<br />i think the big problem is obviously that ang lee is not a hulk fan and tried to make the movie deeper than it should have been. the hulk is, i guess, a complicated character and banner was an abused child with emotional problems in the comic, but come on now, 45 mins of pure drama before we see the hulk? gimme a break-nobody cares, we wanna see action, ie big brawls with building crashing down and cities razed to the ground. <br />im not all complaining, i do have a solution for the hulk sequel if there is gonna be one. no matter what it takes, whoever is in charge of hiring the director MUST get JAMES CAMERON. he will make a movie that will make everyone forget how bad ang lee screwed up.
B00006879E|1.0|One of the best live bands to come around in a long time? You have GOT to be kidding me.  I saw them live opening for Jason Mraz. Mraz was great, but watching Maroon 5 really put a damper on the whole evening.  The lead singer tried to act all cool and everything, but came off as being REALLY annoying.  Their live show is really nothing special and altogether boring.  As for the album, come on people. This is major music industry at its finest, producing mindless sludge that has been used over and over again and then labeling them as being totally &quot;unique&quot;.  So what makes this band so &quot;unique&quot;?  Believe me, if you really want to listen to this band, you're better off downloading the songs than buying the album.  Trust me, it's not worth the price tag.
B00003CXE7|4.0|The plot has been done. Man seeks revenge after a struggle of power leaves his family dead. Man becomes a gladiator to prove himself and to seek justice. Man kills villain yet man dies and is given a full hero's treatment. But this movie does it in a sweepingly enchanting way. You can picture yourself almost in the period that the film is placed in (there are enough historical inaccuracies to fill a booklet but it has the feel of the times more than the actual details). It at some point becomes entertainment that satisfies our hunger for pure bloody action(as the games did during Pax Romana), but it turns back to the tragedy of Maximus and focuses on his seeking of justice for his family and waiting to be reunited with them. It had a much overused story but shows it in a powerful, convincing way.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Well, what can I say about this album that probably hasn't already been said. It's a beautiful and just brilliant album things I rarely see anymore someone actually putting themselves into the music... all I can say is you have to at least listen to it all once. Then you can &quot;judge&quot; it if you're that type of person.
B00005JLSE|4.0|My only problem with musicals (or just bad ones) is that the singing is put on at the worst time and makes me distracted from the storyline (even though I think that is the point of it). But in this one, what was so unique is that the musical numbers seemed like a separate movie from the storyline about Roxie's trial. It was more in the thoughts of the characters than them actually just singing out of nowhere. A musical in order to grasp the audience has to be very visual and breathtaking in scope (ex. Sound of Music, Moulin Rouge). Or the storyline has to be tragic and heartbreaking (ex. The West Side Story, Dancer in the Dark). And this movie contains a little of both. The musical numbers are very colorful and the stage is set up in spectacular vision (ex. &quot;They reached for the gun\\", and &quot;Roxie&quot; bit). And you feel bad at how low the characters go just for attention, and how the public just eats it up (it made the film satirical in nature). I enjoyed it and recommend it to those who are a little put off by singing and dancing in the middle of an engaging story. 4-Stars
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is a masterpiece musically and lyrically. I think that they acquired a slightly different sound with the addition of Jordie White and David Iha (Sorry if i spelled that wrong) But none the less it is definitely unique and unique to this band alone. I mean seriously this album is so good, my dad and my mom who are in their 50s were jamming out to it in the car. And they dont really like alternative/rock stuff. They only listen to jazz.  I mean that tells you something when you can sit in a car with your parents and say &quot;hey mom put this cd in.&quot; And they are like rolling their eyes thinking oh no all that noise! Then after the first 2 songs they are just like wow this is really good. Anyways.BUY THIS ALBUM! get MER DE NOMS well.
B00005JKQZ|4.0|Even if it was loosely translated to the screen, there was no denying the effort that those who worked in this project were quite successful. The screenplay (which is regularly accused of being sugary-coated and manipulative) actually is quite witty and at times smooth. Even if Akiva Goldsman other writing works are laughable, this is really the best work of his career (the reason why he was awarded &quot;Best Adapted Screenplay&quot;).<BR> The direction in A Beautiful Mind by Ron Howard is not his best work (if you want to see the direction of his career so far, look at Apollo 13) but he is good with the scenes where John Nash seems to be involved in a spy plot. <BR> But if anything, this is an actor's movie. Considering Russell Crowe's ability to shine on the screen is more prevalent in this movie than in anything he has done, with the exception of The Insider. Jennifer Connelly does a good job in this considering the very little work she was given. The greatest thing about her performance was that her character was never intimidated by Nash and always made him question the work he did, and focused on what really matters in one's life (and that leads up to the speech at the ceremony at the end). <BR> It won 2001 Best Picture over more &quot;qualified&quot; films for the title, but that didn't take away the beauty and quality of the film. 4-Stars!
B0000C7PSW|5.0|Rufus Wainwright's underground following has steadily grown over the years since he released his self titled debut in 1998. One of the main reasons, is that this man possesses a talent that is almost unmatched in this age of lip-synching and throw-away pop music. Wainwright's music is gorgeous and lush...filled with a sense of romance that most people would be afraid to express. and thank God he isn't afraid to put his heart and soul into his songs, because every one of his growing number of fans love him for it.<br />You can definitely hear a progression through his three albums. His debut was mainly a 'chamber pop' gem, filled with love songs, and breathy vocals. While with &quot;Poses&quot; he branched out...showing more range musically as well as lyrically and vocally. and now with the release of &quot;Want One&quot;, Rufus Wainwright has officially gone beyond the bar. Listening to this cd, it very nearly made me cry several times, simply because i knew i was hearing something special. something that only comes around once in a great while. And Wainwright's voice has never sounded better....soaring in stand-out songs, such as &quot;Go And Go Ahead&quot;, &quot;Movies Of Myself&quot; and &quot;I Don't Know What It Is&quot;. The production is excellent, and each arrangement fits the song perfectly.<br />This is most definitely going to be at the top of my &quot;Best Of&quot; list for 2003.
B000084T18|5.0|I LOVE THE CD, IF I COULD, I WOULD GIVE IT 10 STARS**********<BR>KEEP SMILING 50 CENT!!!
B000002IGP|5.0|The BEST Ratt album of all.  A classic!!  A must have for any 80's metal lover!
B00005JKZV|1.0|well. what  can you  say?  looks great, what story?<BR>ho hum<BR>like the first
B000005DSN|5.0|I will have to agree with most of the other reviews when it comes to Visions, this is probably Stratovarius' best album. The cd is packed with classics like Kiss of Judas, Black Diamond, Forever Free, Paradise, and Visions. Black Diamond is an awesome song, and its worth the price of the cd. If you are looking to buy any album by stratovarius, buy this one.
B00009W0U4|5.0|Gaspar Noe's Irreversible is an unforgettable film and one that is guaranteed to provoke a strong reaction. The first half of the film is so bleak and unpleasant that it's almost oppressive. Though it's not exactly a horror film itself, this film is darker and scarier than most horror films. Depicting a brutal head-bashing murder in a dingy hellish nightclub, and a vicious violent rape in the first forty-five minutes, it's difficult to watch and may be too much for most audiences. These scenes will not leave your head for a long time.<br />The film unfolds in backwards chronological order, similar to Memento. More than just a simple gimmick, this structure adds even more depth to the experience. The main theme of the film seems to be choices that we make and the irreversible consequences of them. By having the film sequenced in reverse, we actually see the consequence before we see the choice. I agree with what Roger Ebert wrote in his review of Irreversible, saying that our present happiness depends on not knowing what will happen in the future. In this film we see the horrible, horrible circumstances that the characters are going to find themselves in. In the second half of the movie, when we see them in happier times, we know what is going to happen while they do not. This just makes it seem all the more tragic the way things turn out.<br />The style of the film can be a bit much at times. In some scenes, the camera moves all over the place almost making The Blair Witch Project look relatively still in comparison. It's quite a cinematographic achievement, but it does call attention to itself. In contrast, during the rape scene the camera is completely still and does not cut away, presumably to force us to focus on what is happening onscreen. <br />Irreversible is a fascinating film which will have you glued to the screen and also, at times, wanting to look away. It's powerful, well-made, brilliant and unforgettable. However, the first half of the film is mercilessly grimy, unsettling and dark giving nearly the most unpleasant feelings that this reviewer has ever had in a movie. It's not all that way, however, and the second half of the film shows the couple (Monica Belluci and Vincent Cassel) in happier times and significantly lightens up. Irreversible is not at all for the squeamish but for those who can stomach it, it's an exhilarating cinematic experience.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I cant say anything more.  Buy this album you will NOT be sorry.  The best track by far is the nurse who loved me and the rest of the songs are absolutly the best.  Jeordie im proud.
B00000DG1R|4.0|I just bought this album yesterday after seeing DD on Sunday, live.  First of all, seeing the original band live 20 years after seeing them the first time (and that being my first concert ever, at 11 yrs old) was absolutely amazing.  I was shaking and had chills the whole time.  Where has my head been the last few years that I've actually started to forget about this band, the greatest band EVER.  <BR>I agree with the comments, this album is for the casual DD enthusiast, but all my albums are in storage somewhere and I NEEDED to hear their music quick.  I did start to miss some of the Bsides and other great songs that were left off this album while I was listening, but it will suffice until I can get to the storage room.<BR>Seriously, when you think about it, Duran Duran basically invented Mtv and music vidoes, have been the first to do many things in the music/concert world, ie, first to use video projection at a live concert, etc. and write and produce all their music.  They ROCK.  And, Simon is a GOD.  He is the most underated sex symbol of our times.  He has the most amazing voice and presence.  The whole band has aged wonderfully.  I'm so excited they are back together and can't wait for the video DVD in November.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle's sophomore effort is nothing short of spectacular.  If music was capable of being attractive and fancying someone, then the Thirteenth Step is by far the best candidate.  This album lacks an element that was crucial in making Mer De Noms such a beautiful album, which is Paz.  Regardless of the lack of violin on the new album Billy howerdell manages to compose yet another intriguing album and Jeordie White measures up to filling Paz's spot.  The album does a good job of putting the listener in to a mood, which is generally a somber one.  If anyone is a fan of Mer De Noms or Maynard James Keenan's work then I highly recommend they get this album.
B0000C3I6U|2.0|The original VHS version (which I have at home) is a fantastic, very dated, documentary about body-building, starring Arnold right before his big break into movies.  However, he bought the rights to the film, so this newly released DVD version was re-edited. Gone is the scene where he smokes pot (he's a republican, after all) and they probably took out some of his nasty comments to other competitors as well, since the original showed him in an unflattering light.  Try and see the original.  Buying the new DVD only supports his current campaign...
B00006690G|5.0|I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S JUST ME BUT EM'S ALBUMS SEEM TO GET BETTER AND BETTER TO ME. HIS OTHER 2 ALBUMS R HOTT. BUT THIS ONE IS THE BEST OUT OF THE 3 TO ME. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE &quot;TILL I COLLAPSE&quot; AND &quot;WHEN THE MUSIC STOPS&quot;.
6305171769|5.0|I remember watching the original Halloween for the first time with my best friend. It was late at night, and we were expecting some good old-fashioned scares. Unfortunately, we came away disappointed, and we couldn't help feeling the entire movie was pretty lame.<br />Nevertheless, I persisted through the series, and while the Michael Myers movies were, in all, not bad, nor do I feel they are anything out of the ordinary. I mean, honestly - psycho stalks victims, victims run around screaming, victims die horribly, last remaining victim manages to turn tables on psycho and kill him, usually by pure fluke, and never permanently.<br />Then Halloween H20 came along, and boy, do I wish I had gone to see this one in the cinema.<br />Other reviewers have varying opinions, especially where the middle slew of films is concerned. It is a big complaint that H20 basically ignores the existence of film sequels #3 through #6. I admit that I particularly enjoyed sequels #4 &amp; #5, with the introduction of Laurie's niece, Jamie, and her psychic connection to the infamous Michael. But I don't think it detracts at all from H20 to pass over those middle films. (especially #3, which does not even have Michael in it!)<br />H20 begins in an unspecified town, at the home of the nurse who was Dr Loomis' carer until his death. Although it indicates that Laurie Strode was killed in an accident years ago, Michael Myers clearly believes otherwise. In a nicely chilling opening scene, Michael brutally murders two teenage boys and the nurse after raiding Loomis' old files. No three guesses who he's looking for...<br />There is plenty to enjoy in this film. We are reintroduced to Laurie 20 years on from her terrifying Halloween night experiences with her psychotic brother, now with a new identity and enough emotional trauma to to put any psychotherapist on the back foot.<br />She is a single mum and a closet alcoholic, who suffers severe nightmares, and frequent moments of hallucination, seeing images of her brother everywhere.<br />The premise is simple enough. The school of which she is headmistress is all but empty as 95% of the students head off on a school trip. There are only 7 people in total left in the grounds - Laurie, her boyfriend, school guard LL Cool J, and the four students who didn't go on the camp.<br />Steve Miner does an excellent job of setting the scene, and manages to pull off a film in the end that is not simply another standard slash &amp; hack.<br />Somewhere in the middle of her own neuroses, Laurie finds the courage to use what she knows about Michael to try and turn the tables on him. And in all honesty, it gives me chills every time to watch her striding up the driveway, axe in hand, yelling her brother's name.<br />It's about time we were given a victim who refused to be a victim.<br />The final scene between the two main (and original) characters was almost touching, although it's a fair bet that had Laurie actually taken Michael's hand, he probably would have dragged her in and broken her neck.<br />Shame on them for doing what they did in the next film, and devaluing Laurie's brave actions so much. They should have left well enough alone, and ended the series with the outstanding H20.r brother everywhere. <BR>The premise is simple enough.

B000002H97|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST METALLICA AKBUM TO DATE. FAVORITE SONGS ARE &quot;SANDMAN&quot;, &quot;UNFORGIVEN&quot; AND &quot;NOTHING ELSE MATTERS&quot; THE OTHER SONGS ARE GOOD TOO.
B00006JKOL|5.0|Tull is, in my opinion, the BeSt band of the 20th century. They've put out a lot of albums and a lot of different sound styles. Minstrel in the gallery is extremely underrated in midst of more commercial aqualung and thick as a brick and while it is better for a beginner to check out those two (or stand up) this is the one that shines as best. black satin dancer is my favorite tull song ever, beautiful in every way, reqiuem (mispell?) is another beautiful song about anderson's failed marriage and a nice prelude to the EXCELLENT one white duck. Baker street muse is unbelievable. it is like 5 or 6 songs in one. every song is better than the last and is pure ear candy music and lyrically. grace is every thing you could ask for after the 16 minute baker street, a 30 second song which is beautiful in every word. I said nothing of the first two songs which have been favorites of lots of other fans but never quite fit with me. Overall, get it. Underrated severely and unjustly, the best.
B00005OM4N|1.0|THE GIRL CAN'T SING.LOVING THE &quot;SLAVE 4 YOU&quot; VIDEO.THE GIRL IS HOTT. SHE CAN BE MY SLAVE ANY DAY.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Wow, where to start? This is a very good cd. It's definitely a cd everybody can enjoy, it's very mellow. Maynard's smooth vocals really flow well with everything else. I have been listening to his music since Opiate, and this is one of his best works. I would REALLY recomend this for someone who either likes Tool, Pigmy Love Circus, Smashing Pumpkins, King Crimson, Pink Floyd, Nine Inch Nails, or old Red Hot Chili Peppers. It's one of my favorite cds and it hasn't left the stereo since i put it in. Buy it. Now.
B00004T9UF|5.0|TIHS ALBUM IS ALOT BETTER THAN THE SLIM SHADY LP. MY FAVORITE SONGS ARE &quot;KILL YOU&quot; AND &quot;THE WAY I'AM&quot;. THAT SONG &quot;KIM&quot; THAT IS ONE F***ED UP SONG. BUT HEY I LIKE IT IT'S COOL. OVERALL THE ALBUM IS VERY VERY GOOD.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This is truly one of the greatest movies of all time - and one of the few worth owning for repeated viewing.  It manages to combine comedy and tragedy with more subtlety and success than any other.  Benigni was born to make/direct/star in this movie.  I hope, but doubt, he'll ever be able to top it.<br /><br />One suggestion, watch the movie in Italian with English subtitles - slightly better that way.
B00004SCX6|1.0|ANOTHER ALBUM THAT JUST PLAIN SUX. I REALLY WANT TO KNOW WHO LISTENS TO THIS GARBAGE. HOW DID SHE EVEN GET A RECORD DEAL. BUT I'M LOVING THAT &quot;DON'T LET ME BE THE LAST TO KNOW&quot; VIDEO. ALL THIS GIRL EVER WILL BE IS SOME HOT CHICK CAN'T SING.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Due to confusion caused by conflicting DVD specifications posted by Amazon and other online retailers for the Firefly DVD set, Chris Buchanan posted the following message on the FOX forum to clear matters up a bit: <br />Quote:<br />--------------------------------------------------------------------------------<BR>To give you a quick response to a complicated subject... <BR>The Firefly DVD will be in the 16:9 format (1.78:1). <br />I know that there are a multitude of issues surrounding the definitions of \\"letterbox\\" \\"widescreen\\" & \\"anamorphic\\" etc, but I'll be real practical here: <br />We shot the show on 35mm film in an aspect ration of 1.78:1 with a 1.33:1 (or 4:3) box to enable us to deliver both a \\"regular\\" TV version and a \\"widescreen\\" TV version to Fox Broadcasting. (Firefly was always conceived as a 16:9 show, but Fox, as a policy, does not broadcast any letterboxed shows. That being said, their HDTV broadcasts do go out widescreen.) <br />As for any differences in what you've already seen, we might have rendered some of the title work in 1.85:1 (anamorphic) but I really can't remember. <br />The bottom line is: What you are getting on DVD is what Joss intended: 16:9. No fake letterbox bars on a 4:3 show, no \\"panned and scanned\\" anything, just Serenity and her crew in glorious widescreen! <br />Hope that clarifies things. <br />Best, <BR>Buchanan <br />-----------------------------------------------------------------<BR>As for my review, this show had the potential as being the best show ever produced for television.  I am an enormous Buffy fan and own many things Buffy but this show grabbed me from the beginning and the storyline just got better and better.  I am still extrememly upset with how Fox treated it and still cannot understand how they could cancel it.  I am now looking forward to seeing the movie that will be coming out and hope that we will get some answers to the wonderful storylines that were just abruptly ended and left dangling!
B00006CXXU|1.0|I HEARD THIS ALBUM FROM A FRIEND OF MINE AND I'LL SAY IT IS BETTER THEN HER FIRST ALBUM. ALOT BETTER THAN ALL OF BRITNEYS ALBUMS. BUT WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED TO CHRISTINA. SHES GONE FROM HOT CHICK TO UGLY A** GOTHIC CHICK.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Just because you may not like TOOL, does not mean you would automatically dislike APC.  Maynard's harmonies are better on this album than any other, and you definitely get to see the softer side.  Everyone needs to own this album.
B000002KXO|3.0|This is the worst sound quality CD I have heard and I've heard thousands.  Don't buy until Warner Brothers can get the original master tape and remaster this correctly, my record sounds better then the CD!
B000069AUI|5.0|The best album I've heard in a long time.  This collection of songs will please anyone with ears.  Great for all music tastes.
B00005JLSE|5.0|You should. Chicago is a musical that is not a happy sound of music kind of a show. It shows the underbelly of humanity-- how people get trampled, ignored and used all out of humanity. The main character is looking for fame, her lawyer is looking for money, her husband is just looking for love. The only one not to get what they want is the poor husband.<br />When I see this film and musical it makes me re-evaluate what is imporatant. In a way this is a tragedy - with some catchy songs. If you understand what this film is trying to show you about yourself, society and our values you will appreciate it for what it is.
B000002UUX|5.0|Definitely the best metal album of all time.  Megadeth got the new lineup yet again, and Marty Friedman and Nick Menza were the perfect fit for Megadeth, as it would show from 1990 and on.  The riffs on this album can't possibly get more complex, from Holy Wars to Rust in Peace, they are amazing.  <br />1. Holy Wars...The Punishment Due: The best Megadeth song of all time, without a doubt.  Starting off with an awesome intro, going into a long spectacle of riffs by Dave and Marty before the lyrics. The riff during the verse is maybe the most complex riff I have ever seen, and Dave does a good job singing on this song as well.  Before we head into the slower section of the song, Marty pulls off a grade-A solo.  Into the bridge, Dave does a deeper style voice, while not an amazing part, it serves as a good leadoff to another great part.  While I may not be a huge fan of fast songs with slow parts, this song is one of few that I like that way.  The riffs, Marty's solos, are all perfectly blended into the middle to form a perfect part.  Leading into Dave's solo, things pick up again, and finally burst when his impossible solo comes and charges hard all the way into the ending.<BR>Rating: A++<br />2. Hangar 18: Beginning a mid-tempo intro, and going straight into the Call of Ktulu part that Dave wrote, serving as a good riff, used in a completely different style.  The part after, though, is probably the best usage of harmony guitars of all time, as they both flow so perfectly into a superb riff.  The actual song contains some great singing by Dave, great lyrics, and even more awesome riffs.  The highlight of this song, though, is the soloing done by Marty (mainly) and Dave.  Absolutely packed with solos, Marty proves to me why he is the best metal guitarist of all time.<BR>Rating: A+<br />3. Take No Prisoners: Nice opening, but the highlight is by far the middle where it all gets faster and more energetic, and the lyrics get more energetic.  A weaker point on the album,but still not a bad song.<BR>Rating: B+<br />4. Five Magics: The first 5 seconds of the song rock, then the next minute doesn't, just a bit draggy, as a shorter part there would have made the song feel more complete.. The rest of the song, however, is brilliant. A midtempo song, it packs a punch with the mini-solos thrown in seemingly everywhere, and you don't know what's coming!  Not to be missed.<BR>Rating: A<br />5. Poison Was the Cure: The first bass part is good, and then the rest of the song is just simply awesome. If Holy Wars does not have the most complex riff of all time, then this song does.  The electric speed of it, with a great bridge into a super-solo by Marty.  If only this song was longer...but that would be a tough thing to do!<BR>Rating: A<br />6. Lucretia: Probably the best intro on the album, but after that, the song seems rather lacking.  Overall, it just seems kinda, &quot;blah&quot;.  But yet, the solos done by Marty and Dave are just complete, overall good solos. <BR>Rating: B+<br />7. Tornado of Souls: One of the best songs on the album, and the whole beginning shows you why.  Starting from the opening riff, and the one right after that, shows you just how good Megadeth can write riffs.  The whole song up to the bridge seems just a little bit too slow, which prevented me from giving it a A, but everything after the solo is perfect, like the solo itself.<BR>Rating: A<br />8. Dawn Patrol: Not exactly a true song, but hey!  It's got a cool bass line!<BR>Rating: ?<br />9. Rust in Peace...Polaris: Polaris, now that is a cool word! The riff during &quot;tremble you weaklings...&quot; is perfect, couldn't be much better, and the chorus is great, too. The Polaris part of the song lacks something, but still is good.<BR>Rating: B+<br />Definitely an album to get...and it is MUCH better than Metallica's 1990 release as well...
B00005JM0B|5.0|Movie is about The Skynet System sending back into the present...... a Terminatrix  that is part liquid metal and part machine who's ability is to morph into a target she kills and to hack into varies types of machines and controls them mentally. Her mission is to destroy alot of targets (liutenants of the future war) but her main objective is to destroy the primary target....... John Conner! Of course the Terminator (Ah-nold) is sent back to protect him and some other chick! Only this time the Terminator doesn't follow orders. His primary objective is to get John and his lady to a safe haven to avoid getting killed by the nuclear war! So there!<br />What an awsome movie! For one thing, the action is explosive and the story is solid and sticks to the tradition of the other 2 Terminator movies! Ah-nold, as usual, is funny with his cheesy one liners, and the chick who played the evil Terminatrix is  hot and sexy! The fx was awsome, the whinny loser who played John Conner was good at his role as well as the redheaded girl with a big nose. The best part in this movie is when both Terminators were man handly each other, running each other through walls..... kinda like Ah-nold and T-1000 only this was better! Some critic said that this movie is a rip-off of the Matrix! WHAT A GOOF!! Terminator was the first to ever come up with the idea of A.I. destroying the human race (unless I missed something here). 5 stars and I WON'T TAKE IT BACK!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This record was exactly what I wanted to hear exactly when I needed it most.  When every other band is chunking out the same chords and screaming into the mic, APC opts to instead layer sounds upon sounds to build textures and moods as much as songs.  Keenan has actually outdone himself on vocals again.  The newer members only add to the cohesion that makes this a whole and completely great record. I couldn't have asked for more from this CD.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Mer De Noms was an awesome album, yet somehow, Maynard, Billy, and the rest of they guys have managed to pull off another beautiful album. Maynards silky smoothe, meaningful (to just about anyone) lyrics, make this CD one of MY favorites, I preordered it, and received it as soon as it came out...that was over a week ago, and I still can't bring myself to stop listening to it. On the computer, in the car, in my bed, in the bath! I would recommend this Disk to anyone. With the new additions to the band, The sound has changed just enough to keep you coming back for more. Great Job, Guys! Best of luck!
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|Mer De Noms, A Perfect Circle's first release was difficult to find flaw with.  With the line-up changes, fluid seemingly up until Thirteenth Step's release, something appears to have been lost.  While most of the songs' writing credits seem to be credited to the original lineup, all of the studio work was done minus Paz and Troy.  It's hard to pinpoint any actual character flaws in the record, as all of the arrangements are equally beautiful to the first album, and all of the lyrics are typically Maynard (introspective, cryptic, and often times open-ended); but something just doesn't click.  The tracks don't leap out at the listener the same way they did on Mer De Noms.  The clear single candidates, &quot;The Outsider&quot; &quot;Vanishing,&quot; and the already released &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; hold up just fine, but there are no solid in-between tracks to match up with the &quot;Magdalenas&quot; and &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot; from Mer De Noms.  Maynard fans will enjoy this album, as will prog-rock junkies, but this effort will go over the head of the average rock music fan.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is just great. If you're looking for something unique look no further. I cant believe how well this album was done.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle has to be one of the best bands out there..Maynards voice is soo great and inspiring..I can listen to A Perfect Circle and just think and think...they are great and I recommend EVERYONE to check them out..no matter what kind of music you like...its great..
B00006AG9F|5.0|When the history of British Rock is written, it will be seen as criminal if this album (and indeed &quot;Vigilante&quot; and &quot;Wings of Heaven&quot; that followed it) is excluded from such a list.  Magnum have always had the ability to evoke powerful images and emotions through the joint efforts of the band's superb musicianship, Tony Clarkin's exquisite lyrics and Bob Catley's heartfelt singing.  He is seen more as a storyteller than a straight vocalist, as his voice perfectly captures the mood and emotion that each song asks of him.  Epic songs &quot;How Far Jerusalem?&quot;, On A Storyteller's Night&quot; and the excellent &quot;Les Morts Dansant&quot; sit alongside pop-rock number such as &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, &quot;Just Like An Arrow&quot; and the under-rated &quot;Steal Your Heart&quot;.  Coupled with the gorgeous piano-ballad &quot;The Last Dance&quot;, this is an album who's delights are savoured time and time again with each new playing.  Also, the album cover by Rodney Matthews is superb too.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|this album is easy listening kicks ass from one end to the other there are no other albums out now that can hold a candle to it
B00000E5MC|5.0|From the bombastic first chords of &quot;Days Of No Trust&quot; to the majestic power of &quot;Don't Wake The Lion&quot; this is arguably Magnum's finest work, and certainly their most commercially successful.  From fine atmospheric songs like the aforementioned &quot;Don't Wake The Lion&quot; and the beautiful and stirring &quot;Wild Swan&quot; to the pop-rock of &quot;Start Talking Love&quot; to the moving ballad &quot;It Must Have Been Love&quot;, Magnum prove here why they are so well loved by their fans and so well respected by and reputable musician and journalist.<br />In finding that fine line between commercial and individual that had so far eluded them, Magnum hit it spot on with this album.  Every song is a winner and nothing can stand out in terms of quality but &quot;Don't Wake The Lion&quot;, a 10-minute anti-war anthem of the very finest vies as a true classic song of the 80's.  If I have one gripe, it is that the three bonus tracks (&quot;Maybe Tonight&quot;, &quot;C'est La Vie&quot; and &quot;Crying Time&quot;) haven't been released with the album recently on any re-release as with these killer tracks included, this album would actually score more than a mere five out of five.
B0000047CX|5.0|The Girl from Ipanema is the first Jazz song I remember hearing as a child. This song and the album has stuck with me throughout the years. Maybe I like this album for sentamental reasons but this song helped me define Jazz for me.  For me, this is classic Mombo. This album is a must have in your record collection, Period.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I'm always nervous about a band's second record after I love the first one.  Thirteenth Step is outstanding.  The swells of Pet and The Outsider are reminiscent of my favorite parts of The Hollow.  Even at their most minimal moments, APC are haunting.  Highly recommended!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|With the release of Thirteenth Step, Maynard James Keenan has taken A Perfect Circle to new heights.  No longer a side project apart from Tool, this band has formed into a more mellow, artistic genius.  This album is excellent.<br />In comparison to Mer De Noms, I believe that it's a little early to tell if this recording is at the same level.  However, at this point in time, it sure as hell seems like this has the makings of another masterpiece that you simply cannot get sick of.<br />This music makes you think, takes you into other spiritual dimensions, reaches into your soul, and takes you for a ride on one of the most beautiful emotional rollercoasters ever constructed.  Maynard is back.<br />BUY THIS ALBUM, AND BE CHANGED - FOREVER.
B00005JKZV|1.0|This movie has almost nothing to do with the story in Tolkien's legendary books. Peter Jackson has basically written his own story and called it &#34;The Two Towers&#34; to sell more tickets. In The Fellowship he at least tried to stick somewhat close to the book and despite some gross inaccuracies I think he did a pretty good job. This movie however is a joke and does not deserve to bear the name &#34;The Two Towers&#34;. Peter Jackson basically decided to say &#34;Forget the book I can write it better&#34; (actually that is pretty much what he did say in an interview with Time magazine) however, in my opinion, he was wrong! The characters are for the most part were well cast and the actors did a good job. The sets also looked nice. Otherwise, this movie was an insult to Tolkien and his books.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I guess I was expecting something totally different. But I like what I wasn't expecting. This record is not as heavy as the first, but in a way, this is the better of the two. GO BUY THIS ALBUM IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT...<BR>Although there is not as much screaming on Thirteenth Step, Maynard has brought me to tears with the beauty of his vocal style. Any serious music listener knows the power that Maynard James Keenen holds.<BR>FAVORITE TRACKS 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|being a fan of tool and perfect circle i always look forward to the newest albums to see where the creativity waters take them.  in APCs newest album they leave the melodic catchy tunes from thier debut and lean towards a more ethereal sound.  one of which that sounds as if it were infused with enya. <BR>   the songs are potent, pensive and have an air of regret in maynards voice.  it seems as though where as their debut album was more of a commentary and subjective this one is internal and objective.    either way if you like music that offers a moments pause to reflect you will treasure this album.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|this is the best album i've picked up in years. it is the only thing that can hold a candle to a tool album. the lyrics are gripping, and the music is supurb. i don't know how any one can give a bad review.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Well honesty is the best policy right? So I went out and bought this album the day it came out (of course) and there are some really great songs on it. Noose being my personal favorite. But to be honest I don't think it's all that it could have been and I was a tad on the dissapointed side. There are a few riffs that seem a little too familiar. And my boyfriend put it best when he said that Nurse is abysmal. I appreciate the new album and I am hoping that it contines to grow on me ... some of the songs already have. I will continue to be an avid fan and look foward to hearing more.   - Angela
B00006V9A0|3.0|Nirvana is... beyond words. They are just so excellent. This was the first Nirvana CD I got as a present and, yes, it was a great introduction to Nirvana. Why? It's their super-hit songs that only intrigue one who is just getting started on Nirvana. When you move on to the better, underground songs on Nevermind, all of In Utero, great songs on Bleach, and Unplugged, you can see what I mean. Obviously Courtney Love wants some dough and &quot;Nirvana&quot; was assembled. This CD poorly displays summary of the legend we call Nirvana with, oh geez, Smells Like Teen Spirit. Do we need to hear that again? All I'm saying is that this album in no way captures the talent and rockingness of Nirvana (except You Know You're Right, which is pretty good).
0446677450|5.0|This is a fantastic book. If you are seroius about making money, and escaping the rat race that involves working 9-5 until the age of 65, then we recommend you read this book. You'll get good business and income ideas from it.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This Cd has brought out the most talent of Avenged Sevenfold, and has broken the seal to a new era of metal, it is quite possibly the greatest album ever made, and AVENGED SEVENFOLD IS AWESOME, i think they are the best overall metal band there is , they just started , and they have won my ears and heart, they will win your's also, the perfect cd this truly is, I LOVE IT SO MUCH, IT IS GODLIKE!

1559409010|5.0|Ohhh all you 1-god religion people still waiting for your messiah to come after his death, it's been 2000 years for &quot;heaven's sake&quot;...   get over it... he Isn't coming back.<br />As for the film, it's comical, amazing, and exactly what should be on film, everything that is depicted on the film, is in line w/the Roman occupation of Nazareth at the time of Jesus, with some social comentary of how things were in his time, numerous religions, ultra-pious jewish sects; who among other things would live in seclusion, with out ever reproducing offspring, are parts in it a little streched?  Well sure, it's a comedy, it's I'd say streched a lot, but on the whole, it's all there.<br />this is all in the dead-sea scrolls people, wake up from your 2000 year decension, to the world of conformity, and forget your 1-god religions, like your 1-god religions left you, spread the word 1-god religions are going down....

078401213X|4.0|I read a nice review of this movie awhile back and decided to watch it.  It was a very intriguing and scary film about a man going insane.  I think this whole movie was ripped off and inserted into that short video in The Ring.<br />Max Cohen is a man who is trying to find the meaning of it all particularly a great way to get over on the stock market.  He tries to use all the math (pi, chaos theory, golden rectangle etc)  in his search.  But unfortunately for him he suffers from severe migraines for which he overmedicates, and he has become mentally unhinged.  Sean Gullette is wonderful portraying a once great math prodigy who is socially underdeveloped.  He is paranoic and suspicious of everyone.  Because everyone is after him for his great pi theory from the wall street weirdo stalker, the Kabbalah wackos, a stranger on the train, his sexy next door neighbor and the cute kid with a calculator.  The scenes with his next door neighbor were very hilarious.  Her attraction to him completely scares and flabbergasts him.  The Cohen character is totally unaware that he could be considered handsome and mysterious to the opposite sex.   Since the movie is regarding his mental breakdown, it is hard to determine whether all these people are real or only his imagination.<br />It kind of leads nowhere after all the buildup but it is a great looking film.  It also ends on a great note with our hero safe (after a harrowing suicide scene) and reasonably sane but it could all change again.<br />It gets loads of kudos for being intellectually fearless and wonderfully acted!  Watch it for the great atmosphere too!
6304698542|5.0|One of the most memorable musical/comedy-dramas ever made and the one that catapulted Liza Minelli to international stardom and cemented Bob Fosse's reputation as an American musical genius. 1931 Berlin is brilliantly realized as an era of apathy and decadence in Hitler's pre-rise to power. This is acted out virtually on stage at the Kit Kat Club where American Sally Bowles (Minelli) performs. The bizarre Emcee (Joel Grey) welcomes the patrons to the sexually charged performances and sexually ambiguous performers. Grey resembles a macabre ventriloquist's dummy as he sings and prances around on stage. He's perfect for the club's bizarre ambience. Into this world comes British Michael York---an innocent into a kind of hell. Sally takes him under her wing and embroils him in her life. He is a writer but has to give English lessons for survival. They are opposites. She is worldly, carefree, sexually outrageous and oblivious to the changing political climate while he is gentlemanly, sexually inexperienced and socially aware. But Sally desperately needs a real friend (as well as a cigarette, most of the time) and they become involved. Excellent supporting cast includes Marisa Berenson as a Jewish heiress, Fritz Wepper as a German \\"gigolo\\" who falls for Berenson and Helmut Griem as a rich playboy who comes between Sally and York. The musical numbers are fantastic and mirror the action, attitudes and atmosphere in pre-Hitler Berlin as well as the actions and emotions of the characters on screen. Stunning uses of color and beautiful sets and costumes make \\"Cabaret\\" an eye filler as well. A near perfect film and an unforgettable cinematic experience. Based on the writings of Christopher Usherwood as well as the legendary Broadway play by John van Druten. Filmed before (as a non-musical) as \\"I Am A Camera\\" in 1955 with Julie Harris, Laurence Harvey and Shelley Winters. A modern day classic and winner of eight Oscars including Minelli and Grey.
B000089RVX|5.0|After downloading the MP3 as suggested by my friend of \\"Bring me to Life\\" from the Daredevil soundtrack, I admit, I was enamoured by the idea of a female lead in a Linkin Park-esque type of sound.    But \\"Bring Me To Life\\" was the only song that was similar to the sound of Linkin Park. I continued on Kazaa downloading all the tracks I could find and much to my chagrin, could not find one I really didn't like. An amazing eleven tracks of downloads (the entire CD) I was hooked.     I saw how the range in Amy Lee's voice could go from angry to poetic with songs like \\"Tourniquet\\" to \\"Hello\\", both of which have a definate aura to themselves. My broad taste in music was covered in one CD, with sounds that echoed classical composers, dark and meaningful lyrics, and a woman that could take the range of these sounds and melt them beautifully into a CD that really is to be frank, amazing.    If you like this CD there are tracks out there (and you can find them however you'd like) which are equally amazing that haven't been released by Evanescence before, at least not on a broad scale. You might want to check out the totally instrumental/synthesised \\"Eternal\\" for a more aggressive song, or \\"Even in Death\\" for something more bleak and dark with a chillingly wonderful lighter sound. You could call it a ballad but well... it's not.    I know the comparisons to Linkin Park have been made continually, though I think that only one song really echoes that group, and it's also a good reason why that song wound up in a movie, as commercialized as the sound has become. The rest of the CD is refreshingly fresh, original, possesses great music and an even greater voice in Amy Lee.    Buy this CD. I did -- And I don't buy CDs.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|This movie is subtle. I rate it the highest for all the Jane Austen on film. It's not flashy. It sticks to the heart though. The worst reviews on this site must be taken with a grain of salt. I find that none of them [bad reviews] are compelling.<br />I saw the movie as a VHS rental first, and watched it several times before returning it, and yerning for a DVD copy of my own.<br />I have all the other's, save Mansfield Park, on DVD in my own library, and Persuasion has been watched more than Pride and Prejudice, which is an amazing feat in this home.<br />P &amp; P has long been my favorite, only to be eclipsed by this late discovery of Persuasion on film.<br />I totally admit it's a BBC production, and sort of dim looking. That's not how this movie should be viewed though, for the heart of the movie beats strong and true and the story builds to utter and complete fullfillment at the end.<br />C. Wentworth &quot;telling off&quot; Lady Russell is a highlight. His character so vivid, and restrained anger ever present when dealing with Anne. Manipulated, he still loves her. And rightly so.<br />And as for understanding the story from the beginning, though I'd never read it at the time, I understood it and craved it over and over again.<br />I've lent my copy to a friend, and am in withdraw. I miss my Persuasion on DVD. The local rental place only has it on VHS, but I may have to go get it. It's really that good of a movie. Now as to persuade others to view this movie, it's hard. My expectations are not every one elses. Most people I know look at me like I'm from a different planet when I ask them if they have seen this movie. They've never heard of it mostly. That explains why I never new it was out. [I've long been an at home movie person only] It's hard to love a movie and want to share it's greatness, but have to tippy-toe around the subject and apoligize ahead of time, since the person may not like the movie. This movie is just like that. I don't get it that otherpeople don't &quot;get&quot; this movie though. It's an incredible tale, on screen or in print.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I immediately fell in love with APC when &quot;Mer De Noms&quot; was released. Now, after listening to their new album (Thirteenth Step) I became obsessed. They took their chemistry to a new direction, and didn't give out any resemblance from their previous album. It's Just what I expected. <br />Some are saying that this album is boring. I don't believe it is. If you can expand your interests and your point of view, (and if you like &quot;Mer De Noms&quot;) then you won't find the album boring. For people who bought (or thinking of buying) this album and are listening to APC for the first time, give the album some time to grow on you (Though I recommend  that you listen to &quot;Mer De Noms&quot; first). Don't immediately judge it. Give it some time. <br />Overall, I love this album. I don't necessarily have a favorite track but I recommend that you listen to &quot;The Noose&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;Gravity&quot;, and &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;.
B00005AQE8|1.0|true this album is still great, but come on' everybody, it's been almost 10 years, why don't you all listen to something freshly amazing, i'd recommend Common - Electric Circus, as the kids say in high school, &quot;get out of the ill, and into the chill&quot;
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Wow, Erykah really impressed me with this latest cd.  I read something she stated &quot;this is for high ceiling, when people were not afraid to play their music loud.&quot;  I'm feeling what she putting down, and I'm would recommend this to anyone who enjoys head nodding, and simplicity.  I notice there are some people who were disappointed that she didn't go deep with the lyrics, but she was showing here artsy side.  She just wanted to kick a beat, set a mood with little words, and create some magic.  I personally think she did an excellent job.  I can't stop listening, and everytime I listen closely I discover something new in a track, and will hit repeat over and over.  This is one of my fav's and it will definitely be with me on any road trip.  I know some of you know what i'm talking about.  A cd you can take on the road and let it ride without skipping to the next track.  This is definite earcandy.  Much props to Ms. Badu....
B0000C7PRY|5.0|&quot;Testimony&quot; is the third and latest solo album from Neal Morse, former mastermind behind the retro-progressive rock band Spock's Beard. This is his first album  to be released since his departure from the band. What an extraordinary effort it is.<br />&quot;Testimony&quot; is a two-hour musical journey into Neal's life chronicling his spiritual searching and ultimate salvation through Jesus Christ. The album's lyrics are deeply personal and autobiographical. There are some truly moving moments in the story, some of which can bring a person to tears.<br />Musically, &quot;Testimony&quot; picks up where Spock's Beard's &quot;Snow&quot; left off. The album is loaded with complex musical arrangements and excellent compositional structure. This is definitely a progressive rock effort.  Throughout the album there are traces of Yes, Genesis, ELP, Kansas and Moody Blues influences. Although Neal performed most of the vocal and instrumental duties on this album, there are some notable appearances by musicians such as Christian music artist Rick Altizer, Kerry Livgren from Kansas (who plays guitar on the track &quot;Long Story&quot;) and Dream Theater's Mike Portnoy who plays drums on the entire album.<br />In typical prog-rock fashion, the music is divided into five lengthy suites consisting of several movements. It is neither boring nor longwinded. The music as well as the concept is so gripping, it makes its two-hour running time lapse very quickly.<br />Although &quot;Testimony&quot; isn't Dove Award-suited material, it has definitely won my vote for Christian Rock album for 2003. This is as close to a perfect album I have heard in a long time. This is definitely a must for Spock's Beard and Morse fans, saved and unsaved alike. Whether you're a Christian or not, it isn't difficult to listen to Neal Morse's &quot;Testimony&quot; and truly be moved by it.<br />&quot;Testimony&quot; is also available as a special edition boxed set that includes a bonus disc consisting of Neal performing a 13-minute  medley of &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; by The Moody Blues and &quot;Find My Way Back Home&quot; by Blind Faith.Neal performing a 13-minute  medley of &quot;Tuesday Afternoon&quot; by The Moody Blues and &quot;Find My Way Back Home&quot; by Blind Faith.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|Finally released on fully restored DVD, THE KIDS ARE ALRIGHT is a anarchic, fast-paced documentary of one of Rock's greatest acts. The film reveals the WHO to be not only expert musicians but also pure and eccentric entertainers as well. Film maker Jeff Stein collects and edits an endless stream of invaluable classic footage along with a concert specially staged for the film. Stein wisely lets the WHO and their music speak for themselves and gets out of the way. Easily one of the greatest rock and roll films ever made. A most entertaining and classic must see for all rock and roll fans in general and all WHO fans certainly.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Three years after the debut of Maynard James Keenan's &quot;side project&quot;, APC has produced what could be called a veritable orgasm of sound.  That may sound fruity, but there is no other way to describe the incredible music that this band produces. <BR>   This could possibly be the best cd that I have ever bought as it displays perfect harmony between Keenan's stunning vocals and the astounding collection of professional musicians present on this recording.  The lyrics are deep and meaningful, and are accompanied by the near perfect bass work of Jeordie &quot;Twiggy Ramirez&quot; White, and excellent guitar work of Billy Howerdel and Nine Inch Nails' own Danny Lohner.  You couldn't ask for a better collection of artists. From the hit single &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; to the stirring &quot;Pet&quot;, the tracks offered on this cd are as diverse as they are brilliant.<BR>   Oh, and one more thing: SEE THESE GUYS LIVE!!! Despite the absence of Lohner on tour, this band does not suffer in the least.  They have replaced Lohner with the equally skilled James Iha of Smashing Pumpkins fame.
B00005A1PR|5.0|every woman out there should listen to this album. truly beautiful in every essence. arie's soulful voice totally brings out the love, warmth and courage in us.<BR>this album rocks and deserves more than 5 stars!
B0000B3FCX|5.0|This album blows away all of their earlier albums. The playing is tighter, Chad's voice cuts through your soul like a knife, and the production is perfect. Nickelback are one of the only true ROCK bands around today. They aren't 14 year-old adolescents singing about girls and the woes of being a pimply-faced loser. They write songs that have to deal with real-life problems and issues. To sum it up in one word, this CD is MAGNIFICENT! Props to Chad and the crew for staying true in this era of corporate generic-rock. Rock On Nickelback!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Where mellow psalms meet post-teenage angst and the tedious road the combination formulates: There's a certain brave ambition in creating music that is anything but radio-friendly and casting aside any concern of acclaim or album sales just to pander to the mainstream.. but Maynard James Keenan, singer for A Perfect Circle, seems almost to be snickering with such an apathy. Throughout the entire tumultuous scenic route of Maynard's emotion-drenched palette, an epic is formed that goes against the pop-star grain and shapes a work of art with substance, obviously squeezed out of the singers own pain, despair, and longing, delivered to the listener through vocals that soar at times, and whisper as a somber lullaby at others. Most every track leaves you with a couple of catchy lines describing a feeling or thought you've never heard worded in such a way before, and it keeps you mulling over and thinking how cleverly they were put. Ironically, the album starts with the line &quot;if 'clever' got me this far, then 'tricky' got me in&quot; which, after a listen or two, would seem most appropriately finished with the words &quot;your mind&quot; after this album casts its spell on you with devious perfection. The surreal atmospheres and landscapes even Bob Ross couldn't have painted are the captivating features that keep this album warm in your car stereo. Every song tends to fuse together and some shorter tracks are even used as quick interludes between the epics, as Maynard weaves searing lyrics through songs that build up like miniature &quot;1812's&quot; and eventually explode in the same dynamic fashion, though moodier, on this surprisingly sedating sophomore effort that tends to lull you into a hypnotic slumber of comfort. Somewhere in the opening single, over a thick, driving bass line you learn to expect from every track, Maynard breathes the lines &quot;little angel, go away/come again some other day/the devil has my ear today.&quot; If this album was inspired out of anything the devil advised him on, then let us hope Maynard doesn't find religion anytime soon.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Thirteenth Step is a true accomplishment! I am usually pretty skeptical at first about new albums, especially with bands I hold in such high esteem, but this album hooked me immediately. It has not left my CD player since I bought it the day it came out. Maynard continues with his intimate and cryptic lyrics. Billy and Josh break some new ground with some incredible instruments and rhythms. It has a great balence of hard rock songs and softer, introspective tunes. If you liked &quot;Judith,&quot; you will love &quot;Blue,&quot; &quot;The Outsider,&quot; and &quot;Pet.&quot; If you liked &quot;3 Libras,&quot; you will love &quot;The Noose,&quot; &quot;A Stranger,&quot; and &quot;Gravity.&quot; &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is a great song that is completely hard to categorize, and for some reason, sounds to me like a mental hospital. It's just genius. Anyway, all the songs on this album are priceless and mind-blowing. Check it our for yourself.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|I was sorta debating whether or not to buy this cd after nickel's last outing but im very glad that i chose to get it. They have definetely refined their style and all the tracks are amazing, if your a fan of nickelback or just alternative rock in general this is a must buy!
B00000IL29|5.0|I was listening to this disc just a moment ago and I decided to make justice for it and decided to review it. This is what I´ve got to say.<br />FIRST THINGS FIRST<br />About The Rudy Van Gelder Edition<BR>(In these RVG edition CDs all transfers from analog to digital are made at 24-bit resolution). The remastering done by Rudy Van Gelder is excellent! The sound Gelder gives the recording - which he originally engineered - a more life like balanced sound that is more pleasing to the ears. The listener is able to hear nuances of the instruments (f.ex. fingers on trumpet valves very clearly). Sometimes the remastering makes you believe that the recording session was held only recently. <BR>By comparison most of the mid 80's Blue Note releases - that have been precursors to RVG editions - are muddy and have little bass definition and an inappropriate amount of treble. <br />About the packaging<BR>I find it very nice! RVG edition CDs contain the original liner notes and also liner essay  (&quot;a new look at&quot; as it is called) from critic Bob Blumenthal, that provides interesting historical insight that may - or may not - reveal new information to the seasoned jazz fan, but definitely could be helpful to new listeners discovering the legacy of Blue Note through these deluxe RVG editions. Also some session photos by Francis Wolff that fold out to full view in the booklet are very nice, some of them are well known and some are published for the first time.<br />About the music<BR>To put its simply - it is beautiful. Other adjectives that I would use to appraise this disc: reserved, complex, elegant, sophisticated, cerebral, refined/mannered...<BR>It is modal jazz that has some post-bop influences. Maiden Voyage is less overtly adventurous than its predecessor, Empyrean Isles, but it is nevertheless full of creativity of these musicians, notably Herbie Hancock who is at the peak of his entire career. It could easily be the finest recording of the ´60s, reaching a perfect balance between accessible, lyrical jazz and chance-taking hard bop. <BR>Each member is on top of his game for this session, and the result is a very enjoyable recording. Rhythm section is exceptional; Ron Carter on bass and Tony Williams on drums. Carter and Williams ceate an ideal backround (along with Herbie) where Coleman and Hubbard can do their soloing. Freddie Hubbard plays trumpet with nice phrasing but George Coleman won´t stay far behind him as he shines with some of the best saxophone playing ever. <BR>The quintet plays five Hancock originals. They are all simply superb showcases for  the group's provocative, unpredictable solos, tonal textures, and harmonies. The quintet does take risks, but the music is lovely and accessible, thanks to Hancock's understated, melodic compositions and the tasteful group interplay. All the elemenst blend together and make Maiden Voyage a shimmering, beautiful album that captures Hancock at his finest as a leader, soloist and composer.<BR>This is an excellent recording, which I unhesitatingly recommend as a great addition to any serious jazz library, and possibly as good a way as any to have Hancock represented as the essential musician he is. This is an excellent CD to begin exploring jazz - it is an ideal introduction for newcomers but also a must have for veterans.<BR>It will immediately let you know that you're listening to a classic and with every listen it gets better.<br />When I listen to this CD I feel like I´m in one of those tropical isles surrounded by blue-green sea. Sun shines and the sand on the beach just shines pure white. Sky is blue and a few white clouds are scattered here and there. I walk in to the sea and dive to the direction of the bottom of the sea. I see many different coloured fish species swimming around me. A green turtle flows over my head. So much life... But suddenly it all disappears. I see couple of sharks swimming and passing by. And it all just calms down. Life returns. Turtles, fishes, octopussies... Everything shines and colours are bright and warm. It is so beautiful...And when the music begins to fade away I rise from the sea, get back to the beach and just watch as it all gets wrapped around the calmenss of nigth... Beautiful.<br />This is Essential jazz. Essential Hancock and essential modal jazz. It definitely deserves a five star rating. I have had this CD for a long time. I keep enjoying it time after time.  You will do yourself a big favor if you buy this. If you don´t believe me, just read what other reviewers have to say.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|&quot;Highway 61 Revisited&quot; is the landmark album that cemented Bob Dylan as a major musical and cultural icon for eternity.Filled with crashing,dense keyboards and tough rock guitar,the album is a series of parables and tall tales;its highlight is of course &quot;Like A Rolling Stone&quot;,a form-busting 6-minute classic that said everthing that needed to be said about the turbulent 1960's in simple terms.For that alone, the record would be essential;with the addition of the bitterly sarcastic &quot;Ballad Of The Thin Man&quot;,&quot;Just Like Tom Thumb Blues&quot;,and the apocalyptic 11-minute epic closer &quot;Desolation Row&quot;,among others,it became an immediate smash and a major classic-rock touchstone for the baby boomers and the ones that followed.Newly remastered in a SACD/CD form,it leaves the cruddy thin-sounding mid-1980's CD in the dust in both richness,fullness and detail.Any Bob Dylan fan or someone who loves geniune,meaningful music should RUN,not walk,to their local record shop and add this to their collection.As for the wanker who said Justin Timberlake is better,I hope your seriously joking for your sake!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Maynard and Co., have outdone themselves with this effort.  The addition of ex-pumokins ax man brings a new sound that blends perfectly with what was allready there.  The lyrical content of this albumn pushes us further into the mind of a musical genius that has yet to recieve the credit he is due.
B000002MQ9|5.0|This album is the sound of Gothic Dream Pop,Yeah this is mostly World Music but it does have a Gothic Edge to it.It's not Goth rock,it's what the Milkbaby likes to call Symphonic Dream Goth.This album takes you into a dream a dream of a dark haunted Castle,or a cold night in a cemetary.This music if you let it can transport you to another place and time.A place that existed long ago and Time that is no more,this album is very haunting and etheral especially the vocals of the beautiful Gothic sounding Lisa Gerrard.Brendon Perry's vocals remind me of a dark fairy tale/musical.<br />All of the tracks s are pure gold on here but if I had to pick one it would be&quot;summoning of The Muse&quot; which has Lisa Gerrard's vocals,it sounds like a vampire movie set in the 1700's or any real good horror movie set in a older time period.The Sound is really hard to describe but i'll say this If Heaven were drenched in Black and the angels had a gothic edge to them I believe this is what it would sound like.Think classical but with a dark edge meshed with etheral vocals and think of it as a soundtrack to good Vampire movie.We'll the Milkbaby hopes this review was helpful,Mes has to go now.MILK,PINKY WAVE,BABYLAND FOREVER,YAY,GOODBYE,YAY.
B00005JLYW|1.0|The reason why I went to the cinema to see this movie was because the first one was Ok and when I saw the trailer thought that it was a stupid movie but had some funny scenes.<BR>But let me tell you that after 30 minutes I was coming crazy with it because there was nothing good about it and I was hoping Demi would kill the angels so it could be over so I could leave the theatre and the most important thing that there will never be Charlie's angels 3.<BR>I may be hard about this movie but I'm being honest, if you haven't seen it you don't know how borring and stupid it is. Besides I don't understand how Jackelyn Smith (singer Pink also appears in the film) agreed to appear in the movie because honestly it's an insult to her good work as an original angel.<BR>This is an unrated version but it's just to excite to buy but I've seen this version and there's nothing that could be rated except stupiness.<BR>The only good thing that I understood with this movie is that almost always sequels are no good.
B0000AR8NK|1.0|At 56 years of age, Bowie finally became \\"Rolling Stones-esque\\" rocker, i.e. putting up albums just for commercial reasons and make few bucks off of them. DO NOT buy this album! It's so unoriginal, it's made up of teeny pop songs to attract younger audiences. Huge disappointment.
0441009425|4.0|I just love galaxy-spanning novels, space -archaeology and cosmic mysteries.<BR>Here you find all this, beautifully written in a gothic post-cyberpunk style. In my opinion the flaw of the book is that none of the characters is in the least appealing. The two main personae are obsessed egotistic zealots that would breezily commit genocide to achieve their ends. And the others aren't much better. Also, the novel is overlong, as usual whit most of today's Science-Fiction and Fantasy production. Still, it's an interesting read whit good ideas, and an intriguing alien equivalent of a biblical myth that would interest the writer Storm Constantine, whose gothic style is similar to Reynold's. <BR>My vote would be thus 3 and a half. Interesting, but not as the Night Dawn's Trilogy of Peter F. Hamilton.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld isn't already out there because there isn't a demand for it or because it wouldn't be profitable to produce. Heck, they put the cult Planet of the Apes series on DVD. The fact is that the rights to the series are complicated. Fox owns the network rights to the sitcom and TBS has recently bought the Cable rights. Even though the series has been off the air for half a decade the reruns still bring in better viewership than some of their networks' primetime programming. Also, running reruns requires little overhead, it is a cost-effective arrangement, more so than producing an original series. As a result, if the DVDs were released, it would stand to reason that less people would tune in to their respective networks for the reruns, lowering the price of advertising and ultimately lowering profits. I am sure that these networks will eventually see the (monetary) wisdom of giving the people what they want, but they are stonewalling for now, and until a deal can be struck, we will just have to wait for the DVDs and watch the reruns on the stations.
B0000C7PRY|5.0|This is an amazing album that has all the muscial elements that made Spock's Beard so great.  Mike Portnoy, of Dream Theater fame, is awsome on drums, and Neil does a great job on keys, guitar and bass.  Throw in a full orchestra and numerous other guest musicians, including Kerry Livgren of Kansas fame on one track, and can you say EPIC?  This is definitely an album that can be compared to some of the greatest progressive rock CD's of the 70's.  <br />As everyone knows, Pink Floyd \\"The Wall\\" was Roger Waters life story.  However, unlike the character \\"Pink\\" who builds walls to protect himself from all the negative things life can throw at you, Neil's story is utlimately one of hope and triumph.  This album is about one man's spiritual quest, with CD 1 spent reflecting on Neil's life of dispair and hopelessness prior to his enlightenment, and much of the 2nd CD spent sharing Neil's new found faith and trust in God and Jesus Christ.  The CD presents Neil's personal story in a non-threatening non-preachy manor, and the listener can choose to be curious about Neil's new found happiness, or simply enjoy the music.<br />This is an excellent CD that continues what was started with Snow.  In fact, they probably could have combined Snow and Tesimony into one 4-CD box set!  I highly recommend to all Spock's Beard fans, and especially those that are looking for spiritual direction in life.  If you do not like things with a Christian message, I think you will still appreciate the music as a masterpiece on it's own.
B00005ASIL|5.0|The very best of Jethro Tull is a very nice compilation featuring some of the bands biggest hits, such as Aqualung, Bungle in the jungle, locomotive breath, and minstrel in the gallery to name a few.  The performace of the cd is exceptional and each song is an individual testament to the greatness of the band. Having missed them at musik fest I felt obligated to at least get a cd and I found this one to be the best. While the band did not play to much good stuff at Musik fest their old stuff more than makes up for it, and 20 of those songs are on this cd. <BR>Any body into Tull will definitley wanna check this one out.<BR>ROCK ON!!!!!!!!!!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I can't get over the review by the guy who based his opinion on hearing Greendale live for the first time. This album requires repeated listens and you will surely be rewarded. You can't rate an album that you don't own.  I remember back in '92 I saw Neil at the Tower in Philadelphia and he played the ENTIRE Harvest Moon album, no one had heard it before, and consequently, no one was pleased......Do yourselves a favor and pick this album up and give it a good listen....it's vitage Neil and Crazy Horse.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I Was soooo looking forward to hearing this album but have to say there is some great songs and some Rubbish  songs The noose is from what ive read of other reviews the best song on the album and i agree with that after hearing that song being one of the first i thought this is going to be the best album ever but was disappointed that the rest didnt live up to it.  i was so looking forward to hearing more guitar solos like magdelena which blew me into another worlD...Blue is another great song the first is a grower with a great solo the other tracks are Just ok I have listened to over 2000 albums so expect a lot from these bands who are the future of Metal
B000002L1L|5.0|I am a huge Deep Purple fan, and I believe this to be an excellent album.  For some reason, most DP fans badmouth this one, as if its somehow inferior or full of &quot;filler.&quot;  Usually when tons of fans don't like an album, I would tend to agree with them somewhat - or at least admit the album is weaker.  I couldn't disagree more.  Underrated is the word to describe this album.  Its fun, its fast, and Blackmore's riffs and soloing are as good as they've ever been.  Gillans vocal performance is excellent too.  The riffs to the title track, Lick It Up, Anya, Ramshackle Man, One Man's Meat - how can you not think this is great Deep Purple music?  I just don't understand why this one isn't put on par with Perfect Strangers, because I think it is almost as good.  The Battle Rages On is the best DP song from the 80s till today - simply a powerful, incredible track.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Fans new and old should be pleased with the newest release by A Perfect Circle. I had seen the band perform some of the songs live in concert prior to the release of the album. Just hearing 'The Package' played live was MORE than enough motivation to purchase this artistic masterpiece. Brilliant lyrical pictures, beautiful vocals and musicianship on display here. 5 of 5 stars!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|The new APC cd was amazing. The songs were more softer then the previous album and more melodic where as the first was more heavy and full of angst. I thought this cd was well done, and much different from the first one.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Easily one of the finest albums of 2003, Thriteenth Step is a truly remarkable sophmore effort by APC.  Incredible arrangements, fantastic guitars, and quite possibly Keenan's best vocal effort ever, this is simply a fantastic record.  Highlights include &quot;The Noose&quot;, &quot;Pet&quot;, and of course the lead single, &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot;.<br />Run - don't walk - to get this album!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Like many fans, I couldn't wait for the new APC cd to come out, but it was definately worth the wait.  Every single song is unique and complex, melodic, just plain awesome.  The Package, The Noose, &amp; Pet, are my top 3 songs.  It's a really hard call though, since the whole CD is fantastic.  If only the Deftones could  have put out a CD 1/10th as good as this to follow up White Pony.  Maynard is a genius.  The new lineup is great.  Only negative thing is the packaging is kind of blah.  I guess all the cool Tool packaging has me expecting more from Maynard.
1400049628|5.0|I have used this book and I am writing from a baracaded house.  We are well stocked and well prepared because of this book.  I give thumbs up to a truly funny and slightly scary book.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Once again A Perfect Circle has shown us that they are truly a one of a kind band. Their new album Thirteenth Step is both hypnotical and beautiful.  This band has so much talent, you are doing a disservice to yourself by not buying it.  Singer Maynard James Keenan of Tool fame shows us that A Perfect Circle is not just some side band, he gives 100% of himself to this music, as does the rest of the band. The result...utter and complete pleasure for all.
0385504209|4.0|I was delighted to see this exciting novel move its way up the bestseller list.  &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; contains much truth in its fictionalized accout of, among other things, the Priory of Sion, one of the great mysteries of the Medieval world.  Although the author does not get all the facts straight, he certainly knows how to weave together a great story, and enough of the truth squeaks out as to reveal that much of the world's history has been distorted in order to favor the ruling authorities.<br />I really hope this book becomes a movie.  In the meantime, if you want to read a non-fiction book that truly exposes the conspiracy behind the scenes purported by the power elite against the &quot;little people,&quot; I highly recommend the excellent and well-researched &quot;The Christ Conspiracy:  The Greatest Story Ever Sold&quot; by Acharya S.  Othre books of the same genre, which demonstrates that much of this so-called &quot;history&quot; is fiction, include &quot;The Jesus Puzzle&quot; and &quot;The Jesus Myteries.&quot;  I find, however, that the Christ Conspiracy is the easiest to read and understand.<br />Three cheers for Dan Brown for not only broaching important and controversial subjects, which can only help in the improved consciousness of mankind.
B00003CWTH|5.0|When I first submitted my search for &quot;magnolia&quot; (my favorite movie of all time, incidentally), i was irritated to discover that Tom Cruise's name was the only name that followed the title.<BR>  Obviously, this is because of his super stardom.  <BR>  John C. Reilly's performance in this movie is one of the greatest, most thoughtful and most underrated.  I didn't think that this degree of honesty in a performance was possible.  It was the first thing I'd ever seen him in and since then, he has been my favorite working actor.<BR>   The copy of this film that I happened to own was one of those academy screening editions that they send members during Oscar season.  On the back, under &quot;for your consideration,&quot; It read something like this;<br />BEST ACTOR-John C. Reilly<BR>BEST SUPPORTING ACTOR-Tom Cruise, Jason Robards               Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Phillip Baker Hall<br />I'm not saying that Tom Cruise was bad in this movie.  In fact, I think it's his best performance to date (since he seems to pretty much be playing his own slimy self).  But can't we just give somebody else a chance in the spotlight here, amazon? Somebody who really really deserves it? <br />Furthermore, it seems to me that Paul Thomas Anderson may have deserved this credit as well.  He is one of the few true geniuses we have working in Hollywood....I've seen all of his films and there's not a one that I didn't appreciate (actually, i still haven't gotten a chance to see his debut film, HARD EIGHT, but i'm trying).<br />Anyway, it's not like this sort of thing really matters.  I was just irritated and felt like complaining.  See Magnolia!
B000006O7C|5.0|Simply stated, this is a very very cool collection of songs, of sincere, heartfelt creativity, interwoven with some beautiful, angry, intense, wistful, eerie and reflective moments. Having said that, I feel a special connection to this album (all his albums really)because I've made the effort to try and understand who Jeff was, and when you personalize music, what anyone else says is a totally irrelevant. Okay, enough with the platitudes....to be critical, disc one is a bit uneven, but circumstances being what they are, what can be done about that? This isn't a John Mayer album of nice pop ditties carefully crafted to &quot;flow well&quot;. This is the real deal, a mastermind going through the heartwrenching struggle of identification that is being an artist. It shows Jeff searching, perhaps setting aside the Zeppelin influence of &quot;Grace&quot; and trying to acheive a musical breakthrough of sorts. More on that in a moment.  &quot;Everybody here Wants You&quot;, &quot;Morning Theft&quot;, &quot;Opened Once&quot; and the alluringly haunting &quot;You &amp; I&quot; are certifiable beauties, especially the latter. Turn this one up loud, dim the lights, and stare at the back cover photo while playing this. You will be deeply moved as a result. &quot;Sky is a Landfill&quot; and &quot;Vancouver&quot; are excellent, well crafted songs, and they draw you in like no other. &quot;Yard of Blonde Girls&quot; is a little weaker than the other nine tracks here, but the trancelike, Arabian feel of &quot;New Year's Prayer&quot; more than suffices and makes up for it. &quot;Witches Rave&quot; is just a fun little number, kind of serving to clear the palette as it were, coming just past midway throught the first half of this...<BR>Disc 2 offers us two alternate versions of songs from Disc 1, and another bonafide cool moment in &quot;Haven't You Heard&quot;.....dark song, but worth the price of admission. The rest of this disc gives us that breakthrough I mentioned earlier, and for some this is where the rough going may occur. It shows Jeff exploring some of his experimental side, both in recording approach and songwriting. My recommendation here would be to go about listening to this as though Jeff is a great friend of yours (through his music, he certainly means this to me), who has just worked on his little four track machine in his rented house in Memphis, and he comes to you and says, &quot;Hey man, check out this awesome stuff I've been creating&quot;......these are rough &quot;sketches&quot; that went down not that long before Jeff left us, and the results, while certainly disjointed in parts, are pretty phenomenal. &quot;I Know we Could be so Happy&quot; is sheer musical mystique. &quot;Murder Suicide....&quot; is scary, even by my standards, but I LIKE it!! &quot;Jewel Box&quot; is a very coherent song, would have been suited nicely when Jeff played &quot;Sin-e&quot;.......whether all of the 4-Track demos would have been released will always be speculative at best, but thank God we have this important musical document.....I could go on, but see for yourself....hear for yourself, and allow yourself to be taken in by this music.....then go out and explore Tim Buckley......you will not be disappointed....both were truly blessed!
0312263120|3.0|I'm always surprised to find typographical and/or spelling errors in a mass market paperback. It changes how I ultimately judge a book. <BR>Digital Fortress was a very fast read. I like the short chapters and the simplicity with which the author moves from character to character and in and out of settings. <BR>I'm not a techie but I am an experienced computer user; however, I didn't quite grasp some of the computer jargon. In some cases the simplicity is taken too far....'oh yes, and by the way, he's dead.'  <BR>Comic relief, &quot;Captain, she's gonna blow!&quot;
B00006879E|4.0|The first song I ever heard by Maroon 5 was their first single &quot;Harder to Breathe.&quot; I thought what a great, refreshing sound! I bought the CD a week later. These guys have great harmonies and they write meaningful lyrics. Highlights include &quot;This Love,&quot; &quot;She Will Be Loved,&quot; &quot;Through With You,&quot; &quot;Not Coming Home,&quot; and &quot;The Sweetest Goodbye.&quot; My personal favorite is &quot;She Will Be Loved.&quot; Great song. This band isn't just another one hit wonder so check them out! You won't regret it!
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|A Perfect Circle's sophomore CD, Thirteenth Step, is a very solid album.  The arrangements by the band's founder, guitar player, producer, engineer -- face it, this is Billy Howerdel's creation -- are musically sound.  The vocals are typical Maynard James Keenan gold, and the playing by the other members is, well, solid.  And therein lies the major problem I have with this album.<br />None of the songs on Thirteenth Step, with the exception of Pet, have any kind of hook to them.  While they flow into each other in terms of mood and timbre, there's very little to distinguish the songs from one another.  The Package leads into Weak and Powerless which leads into Noose, etc.  While this makes sense in the larger context of the album, it is difficult to listen to the parts that make up the whole by themselves.  <br />The track order serves to mess up the overall feel of the album.  The Nurse Who Loved Me, quite frankly, is a waste of time.  Surely they had a more suitable song to put in the album.  Lullaby may have been better served by going before Pet, to echo Tool's Parabol --&gt; Parabola form.  <br />The overall mood of this album is darker.  The songs on this CD sound a bit more muddy and subdued compared to those on Mer de Noms.<br />In conclusion, let me say that I do enjoy this album.  The songs have no technical flaws at all.  Unfortunately, the soul that was so evident in Mer de Noms seems to have withered away a bit, which is a shame.  I can only hope that their third CD, whenever it comes out, is able to recapture the magic of the first.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|this is perfection at it's greatest. maynards voice is like no other and the music just comes together so perfectly. guitar riffs are just unbeliveable. i can't stop listening to it. please support the band and buy this album, it will be well worth the money!!
B0000BYM3K|4.0|I don't want to come off as a snob. Or a bitter old timer. But I miss the Martin Birch produced Iron Maiden era. Not just because the albums were better. Even though they were. I'm well aware that it is not really fair to compare any of Maiden's modern releases with NOTB, POM, Powerslave, Somewhere, or Seventh Son. But it's more than the good tunes; it's the sound quality. I'm one of the rare breed who listens to Maiden on a very high quality audio system. The older albums were such high quality it made the \\"sound\\" just one more of the things that was fantastic about The Irons. Nowadays it seems as if the sound quality of music is secondary. With the popularity of MP3, I guess it makes sense. Folks aren't listening to the music on good stereos anyway - so what does it matter if the sound is compressed, lacks upper treble or deep bass, or lacks the utmost clarity? Dance of Death is not a bad mix, not the same way the otherwise great albums A Real Live/Dead One's are, but it just sounds like its MP3/FM ready. That's all.<br /> Otherwise, this is a fantastic modern Iron Maiden album. Better than Brave New World even. And should make just about every Iron Maiden fan happy. At least I can listen to it in the car. But at home, I don't think so - maybe from another room, but not listening to it sitting in front of the stereo.<br />Thanks for letting me vent.
0140177396|5.0|Twice, once in a Junior High English Class and again in High School I was required to read John Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men.\\"  Each time I have read it since, I have enjoyed it more and more.  It is a brief, easy-to-read but emotionally resonant novel about two migrant workers set in the California countryside.  As with most of Steinbeck's classic work, the prose is very discriptive while not being clunky or overly verbose.  The themes of friendship and brotherly love are apparent on every page and aren't as emotionally manipulative as many books that try to be today.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read.  Unlike many alleged \\"classics\\" I've been forced to read in class its actually a great book and I had no problem reading it outside of class (I couldn't say as much for A Farewell To Arms, but oh well :-) ).  I would recommend this book for anyone from a mature junior high reader up.  The violence might be a little much for someone younger than that (and might be a reason why the book has been, unfortunately, banned so many times).
B000003TA9|4.0|It's hard to say what the best \\"Sonic Youth\\" album is, but this is one of them. It's an album that has it all. Some straight forward rockers, some that are just beautiful noise, and Kim or Thurston singing on most of the tracks. Anyone who likes their albums \\"Goo\\" or \\"Washing Machine\\" should like this too. It's a long way from \\"Confusion is Sex/Kill yr. Idols\\" though. Some copies of this have a picture behind the cd, of a nude man and woman molesting stuffed animals. Mine does anyway. There's also a new \\"Deluxe Edition\\" of this with a bonus disc. Whichever one you choose, it will go great with your \\"Dinosaur Jr\\" and \\"Pixies\\" cd's.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|okay sorry about the title but it's true. normally i'm very bitter about orchestra music because i played the viola once and i hated it so i refused to have anything to do with this kind of music anymore. but then i saw this movie. and every time i left the theater i'd be humming the music. and it would make me so mad because i couldn't remember most of it. so finally i broke down and bought the soundtrack about three weeks ago. i absolutely love it. yes it repeats itself and yes it isn't too long but hey that's what the continuous play is for, huh. i'm not sure if it's because the music is from the movie, or i really do like this stuff, but i listen to it all the time. this cd has definitely gotten a lot of use from me. it's cool to listen to the music and imagine the scenes and go through the whole movie from beginning to end in your head. if you've seen this movie and really love it, i definitely suggest you buy this soundtrack. but only people who are completely in love with it, like myself. the casual movie watcher probably would get sick of it. but i'd still recommend this to anybody who likes exciting music, because it definitely is exciting.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is easily one of the best albums of the year. It rivals Radiohead's, Deftones', and Opeth's newest ones, as well as the Mars Volta's debut. But, let's talk about the album.<br />Thirteenth Step is the sophomore album to the band led by Maynard James Keenan (Tool) and created by Billy Howerdel. They added James Iha (Smashing Pumpkins) and Twiggy Ramirez (Marilyn Manson) to the line-up, adding a new spice. The difference between Mer De Noms and Thirteenth Step are a couple things.<br />1. Obvious concept. Mer De Noms translates into Sea Of Names, but can you really grasp whether or not it's a concept album? Sure, there are several songs on the album that have names of people (Judith is Maynard's mom), but do you see the songs tie together that well? Though I'm not quite sure the first album was based on a single concept, I'm positive this one is. When you go into rehab, there are &quot;steps&quot; to recovery. Each song represents the stages of drug use. For the most part, it's in order; it begins with the receival and first usage of the drug (&quot;The Package&quot;) and ends with the choice of life (&quot;Gravity&quot;). You might be thinking &quot;If it has thirteen steps, why are there only twelve songs?&quot; Well, as cheesy as it may sound, I think they wanted you to choose the Thirteenth Step. You might need to listen to the album a few times to fully enjoy it, so remember the concept at all times. I don't want to give away which each song represents, that's your job.<br />2. More experimentation. Though they don't pull off any Pink Floyd-esque lavishing bizarrities of music, what they attempt is atleast different than the modern music scene. The most obvious example is the cover of the Failure song &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot;. I would have to say that this is my favorite song on the album as well. It contains an orchestra and some type of Caribbean drum, possibly steel. This album was more progressive than the last, taking more of a Tool route. Thefirst song stretches out over seven minutes, which I believe isn't really needed, considering there was no explosive crescendo. There is also an intro to a song on the album (&quot;Crimes&quot;) which is basically a semi-instrumental song about choice, but you'll understand that after you purchase the album. Lastly, it was quite noticeable how much drum usage was increased. It seemed to be as dominant as guitar in many sections.<br />So if you like Tool, Nine Inch Nails, Radiohead, or any bands somewhat related, you should check out A Perfect Circle.
0142004235|5.0|East of Eden is easily one of Steinbeck's best novels (and that's saying something considering how many great books he's wrote).  The novel itself is an allegory following the Biblical accounts about the fall of man in the garden of Eden and Cain and Abel set in rural California.  Although the book is quite long, its a fast and easy read.  The only problem I had with the book is that Steinbeck, at times, tends to make the themes (free will vs. destiny) and the allegory a bit overly-obvious.  But this is a minor point and its a great book (Steinbeck won the Nobel Prize shortly after this novel).  I would highly recommend it and am glad that Oprah has brought this book out of the required reading lists for high school english and back into the public eye.
B000002G26|4.0|I don't know what his &quot;Best of Me&quot; album was trying to prove, but it should be called &quot;Some of Me&quot;. This has everything that's essential, including &quot;Heaven&quot;, &quot;It's Only Love&quot; with Tina Turner, and &quot;Cut's Like a Knife&quot;, which the other collection is missing. The only track I really miss here is &quot;Have You Ever Really Loved a Woman&quot;, which was released after this anyway, on the &quot;Don Juan De Marco&quot; soundtrack. Glad I have that. I also like &quot;Please Forgive Me&quot;, which was new on this album. Overall, this is the only &quot;Bryan Adams&quot; the casual fan should need, and will go great between your &quot;Richard Marx&quot; and &quot;John Mellencamp&quot; cd's.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I really have to say that this album from A Perfect Circle is one of the best investments i made in the past year.  This album is full of so much emotion and talent that i really couldnt put it into words.  One thing thats a little different, is that its not a hard rock album by any means.  If you were expecting this to be just like Mer De Noms, i think you might be a little dissappointed.  This album is a really mellow album, but it is for the better.
B00003CXB7|5.0|MASH is on of the greatest comedy movies of 1970's.I think<br />    it's far better than the boring TV series that hold the<br />    same title.The direction by Robert Altman is great and<br />   the cast including:Donald Sutherland,Elliott Gould and Robert<br />   Duvall did a wonderful performances.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This days most groups/bands only make music for money not only that but... the musicians themselfs dont make the music , they are just puppets for the producers they chose,this album is a rare piece in this comercial world.<br />Each song is very good  , you can listen to the cd over and over and over again and not get tired of it.<br />The music in this CD is very complicated you need a lot of skill for playing some songs for example 07-The outsider just left me spechless when i heard it.<br />2 of the songs from this album are trully beautiful that will awake some feelings inside you 04- blue and 09-the nurse who loved me.<br />The last song of the album called gravity is a great great song to end the album it will leave you like in a peacefull trance.<br />with this CD from now on  a perfect circle is in my top 3 bands that i like
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Must have cd.Very powerful messages was put into this release.I loved the first one but the second release is even better.
B000046PVN|5.0|&quot;YOU WILL BELIEVE A MAN CAN FLY&quot;-(original 1978 advertising catch-phrase for SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE)<br />The musical score for SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE is as much a masterwork as the film itself.  Both are artistic achievements of the highest order.  The only difference is, that of the many aspects of the motion picture's production which were crafted to perfection and make the film all it could possibly be, John Williams' superb score is the one part that can be separated from the whole and remain standing as a seminal creation.  This music is among the most powerful and emotionally-charged ever composed, and I dare say William's best.  I realize it's not &quot;safe&quot; to make these claims about both the film and it's music because of the comic book subject matter.  &quot;Surely, a more serious film and it's score deserve the 'best' label&quot;, many would say.  On the contrary, it is the very fact that the filmakers and composer were able to take a fantasy character and achieve such artistic greatness that makes SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE and William's wonderful aural accompaniment all the more awesome.  Shame on those who say the film is dated.  The exquisite cinematography of Geoffrey Unsworth, the inspired direction of Richard Donner, a top-notch acting job by the entire cast high-lighted by the endearing personality of Christopher Reeve, Mario Puzo's excellent script with just the right balance of deadly seriousness and effective humor, the sets, editing, special effects, right down to the coolest title/credits sequence ever concieved, as well as JW's masterful contribution, all combine to make SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE a timeless work of pure cinema, honed to perfection.  Hats are also off to Alexander Salkind who gave the creators the luxurious amount of time and money needed to do the job right.  The reputation of the film and it's score will continue to grow in the years to come.  Those who prefer their super-hero films dark and cynical need know that idealism will always have a place and media products that glorify good-will do not exist only in the past.  SUPERMAN: THE MOVIE and John Williams' score are heroic, epic achievements, both of which bring almost infinite pleasure, not to mention inspiration, to those blessed souls able to appreciate them.l always have a place and media products that glorify good-will do not exist only in the past.

B0000AXE8I|5.0|This movie was not as good as the the first movie story wise, infact things moved rather slowly and nothing much has changed as I relised after walking out of the theater for the 3rd time.<br />But, you need to keep in mind this all links up to the final matrix trilogy \\"The Matrix Revolutions\\". I think they kept us all entertained with the matrix style action sequences and ofcaurse the Agent Smith that now can make multiple copies of himself and Neo can fly as we saw vaigly in the origional. The Revolutions does live up to the origional action (if not better).<br />The new characters that were introduced are all pretty cool, especially those twins. I think reloaded was a great movie and was necessary to build up to \\"Revolutions\\" in which I am greatly looking foward to.<br />I think people were disapointed because they wanted this 2nd trilogy to be better than the origional or live up to it.<BR>But I believe they did what had to be done.<BR>There was nothing wrong with the ending because they made it clear that the series is going to be concluded.<BR>I love Agent Smith and his men as always and he is even cooler in the 2nd trilogy. I am looking foward to the finale between A. Smith and Neo.
0800141660|5.0|I really can't tell you how much i love this movie. i'm not going to prattle away about the cinematography, directing or even skript and acting, because when you watch this film you really just don't care; because you're too involved with whats going on to notice those things. It is simply stunning and leaves you wanting your own Mr. Ferris or Colonel Brandon
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle hit it big with this one. The powerful lyrics of such songs like &quot;The Noose&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, and &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; make me want to listen to this CD everyday. Personally, I recommend this CD to anyone who is into enlightenment and learning more about life. This CD, although it may be considered as rock, should not be thrown in with such bands as Limp Bizkit and those cornballs Korn. A Perfect Cirlce ectually has something meaningful to say, not some stupid sappy lyrics or hardcore BS about nothing at all.
B00005QIPH|5.0|Many people dislike The Strokes for some reason or other. Maybe it's because they are rich kids from New York that have it made. I feel like if you can put your ego and jealousy aside for about 35 minutes, you will be in for a real treat. This album is fresh and catchy in ways that no album has been for years.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album was better than I expected. Maynard James succeeded again with the help of Billy and Jeordie. The music awakened emotions deep inside. &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard. I am completly engulfed with this band. I am now truly a fan of their music and I hope they continue with what they are doing. Mer De Noms was wonderful, people should not belive it was just a fluke of good luck. They are creating some of the best music these days, compared to whats out there. Keep it up!
B000062XM3|5.0|awesome, in your face, bloody, brutal, brillant, sometimes over the top, bashing, gory, nasty, comical, disturbing. David Fincher's second best film next to Se7en. Brad Pitt can act and he can fight and so can Edward Norton. The fights are awesome and the suspense never stops. The finale I never suspected, which was great. and theres a lot of sex and moaning in this one as well and some big juggs on Meat Loaf. Watch and enjoy
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is a awesome CD, it is worth every penny i spent on it. It is hard to resist a CD with all this talent on it, it blows my mind every time i listen to it. If your a fan of tool or previous apc cds, BUY THIS CD RIGHT NOW!
B00006RU5B|5.0|To anyone who thinks negatively towards this band or their musical efforts, based on the simple fact that it is not the same thing as Rage Against The Machine, needs to smarten up. This band has been saying all along that this is not the same type of music as Rage. For any of the ignorant people who thinks in any way that Zach de lo Rocha is a better singer or lyracist than Chris Cornell, shame on you. Chris Cornell is a absolute poet and leaves me in shock every time I listen to Soundgarden, Temple of the Dog, or Audioslave. This disc is the best album I have heard in years. With the power of 'Cochise', or 'Show me how to live', or the melody of 'I am the highway', or 'Like a stone' this band- no SUPERGROUP is the most talented group out today(except for TOOL) because of Chris Cornell. Any person who disagrees I challenge you to find a better band.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|the band created a new c.d. altogether, and not only created a different sound, but created each new song to affect me in so many ways. you can still hear the melodic tunes of keenan's voice, and you know you are listening to a perfect circle, but it's so unique and different, and the ability to do that in their next c.d. makes them one of the best.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|It's not possible to describe in words how incredible this album is.  The more you listen to it the more you get from it. Maynard's vocals are gorgeous, and the music is intense. I highly recommend adding Thirteenth Step to your collection.
B0000026NC|4.0|Pulse is indeed the best Pink Floyd live album, no question.  But this little diddy isn't too bad either. Sure enough all the versions of the songs on DSoT are inferrior to the ones on Pulse. But that doesn't make them horrific to listen to.  I actually recomend getting both Pulse and Delicate Sounds of Thunder.  They both have a great feel, and Pink Floyd fans will love them.  The only real attrocity on this album is Another Brick  in the Wall part II, where the song doesn't seem to have any life in it at all. it seems it was just thrown in there. Other than that this really is a decent effort.  Just try it.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is one of the best CD's that are out on the market I went and bought this album the first day it came out and I was not disaponted by it &quot;The Thirteenth Step&quot; was worth the wait.I recommend it to everone Maynard is a great artist.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Did I really just read someone recommending Justin Timberlake instead of this?  Must be some kind of reverse psychology..  I find the SACD remastering gives a clearer, cleaner, more transparent sound, even on a regular CD player.  It doesn't have that kind of bathroomy sound earlier CDs had, but it doesn't quite have the warmth of the original vinyl (although that just may be nostalgia).  The music, of course, is great..
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Once again APC delivers the world an unbelievable album full of emotion, raw grit, and genius lyrics.  Only Manynard and his crew could pull off two stunning albums in a row.  Would recommend to anyone regardless of their taste in music.
B0000033PB|2.0|This is a reunion album from 1991.  This CD has 10 tracks and is 48 minutes long.  The tracks are 4 to 6 minutes long.  Note that there is an import version of this CD that has 4 bonus tracks.  The bonus tracks are just edits or different versions of songs already on the original CD.  I haven't heard them, but none of the original songs are any good, so I can't imagine that these bonus tracks would be much better.<br />The cover is indicative of the album.  It is just a boring picture of a merry-go-round.  There is no excitement, energy or interest in the cover.<br />Most of the tracks on this album are relatively short songs.  The songs are bombastic and repeititive.  There is a main theme that is just repeated.  There is no depth to the music or the song writing.  For the most part, there is nothing here to remind you of the old ELP.<br />There are three instrumentals on this CD.  The music was always ELP's strenghth.  But, 2 of the instrumentals here are just tedious, bombastic, repetitive and boring.  <br />The album does get a little better near the end.  The last three tracks are enjoyable.  Closer to Home is a nice piano piece and Better Days has a good, driving beat.  <br />ELP broke up in 1979 due to differences in musical direction and the great progressive rock blow up at the end of the seventies, when the progressive rock bands were done in by their own excesses (especially ELP and Yes).  The group sort of reformed in 1984 as Emerson, Lake and Powell (with Cozy Powell, who died a few years ago).  They broke up again to reform in 1991.  They played in concerts, released some live albums and then released one last studio album, In The Hot Seat, which is along the same lines as Black Moon (bad).   They took a break while Keith Emerson had surgery on his hand.  Emerson most recently has done a reunion tour with the Nice.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I've been waiting for this DVD set more than any other series... just for the simple fact that Kristen Kreuk the babe-alicious import from Vancouver (awesome city) is in each episode...<BR>This is one of the best primetime series it has almost everything that a good show would want.  Appeal, interesting characters, personalities, stories that develop the characters leading to the ultimate but with a distortion of the time line from the traditional Superman series... but that's what makes it interesting far more interesting than the Nicolas Cage playing the man of steel on the big screen... yuckkkkkkk....  <BR>I'm really looking forward to seeing the extras that are on here the interviews, the narrations, etc...  I think those are always the fun and sometimes even more interesting parts of the the DVDs...  <BR>Please say yes Kristen...  &quot;=)
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I originally heard this album when it was leaked prior to its release. I had been waiting for a new album by APC for what felt like forever! When I popped it into my car cd changer and listened to the first 3 songs I knew that A Perfect Circle had done it again. Mer de Noms was a masterpiece of melody and emotion that I never thought they would be able to match, but they did! Today is my birthday and I received a store bought copy of the cd from my husband as my gift. A Perfect Circle lives as proof that if you make a great album, people will buy it whether or not they can get it for free. Their albums are works of art that can touch your soul and they are reminders that there are still talented, down-to-earth artists out there doing what they love and becoming successful as a result. I will continue to support them by buying their cd's and going to their concerts because they have not forgotten what the music business should be about and because, to put it bluntly, they make amazing music! Buy Thirteenth Step, it will not disappoint!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Maynard still has the power to give me chills! The second album in the APC arsenal, \\"Thirteenth Step\\", is very well thought out and has enough passion to make me ball my eyes out for hours (in a good way of course). Now with Joerdie White aka Twiggy Ramirez former Marilyn Manson bassist and James Iha former Smashing Pumkins guitarist, the circle is complete. Go buy this album! You wont regret it.
B00005JLSE|5.0|What a spectacle, the numbers and routines take your breath away.  The approach is clever in that the routines are seen through Roxie's dreams, much more acceptable than the old style musical where everyone on the bus starts singing together on cue despite being total strangers.  <br />The story underlying the glam and glitter is a satire of celebrity status being available for sale , public servants being corruptable and the legal system being open to manipulation.  Some reviewers find this depressing, I agree that it is depressing, depressingly realistic that is.  Despite the lack of &quot;Yellow Brick Road&quot; goodness this is a well written, extremely funny movie that is well worth watching.<br />The performances from Catherine Zeta-Jones, Renee Zellweger and Richard Gere are superb.  Zeta Jones in particular is nothing short of stunning in the &quot;All that Jazz number&quot;.<br />If you are looking for the everything is rosy in the garden musical of old this is not it.  However if you are prepared to open your mind to a satirical musical, look no further.<br />I think Chicago is worth every award it received and then some.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|a perfect circle's follow-up album to mer de noms is thirteenth step. this album lives up to mer de noms in every way. although there are two new band members, a perfect circle still sounds as perfect as before. mer de noms might be a little harder but thirteenth step is lyricly deeper and more molodic. if you like mer de noms then i think you will like thirteenth step just as equally if not more.
0064407667|4.0|The poor, poor Baudelaire orphans.  Life throws them down a flight of stairs at every step.  Somehow, however, they overcome their ill fate (at least until the next volume) through wit and strategy. They must, as the adults in their lives are either clueless or evil, period. <br />For this reason, the children-and hence, the readers-have no time to dwell on the unfortunate events.  Though their world is set on the All-Tragedy-All-The-Time Channel, you find that you enjoy brainstorming a solution rather than only empathizing.  The circumstances are so gleefully unbelievable that you never once walk away with a tear in your eye or a lump in your throat.  This is hilarious quasi-goth wordplay, villains with more than a touch of Disney camp, and three kid protagonists you can relate to/want to be like/want around in the event of a nuclear holocaust.  The ages 9-14 set will swap this out with their parents and older siblings.  <br />I haven't made babies yet, but this is the first book I'm saving to read to my kids when they are old enough to enjoy a story without pictures.  I got overeager and tried to read it aloud to my husband whilst he watched the History Channel.  He was annoyed, confused, and frightened.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is a great follow up to Mer de Noms. The music is so melodic and MJK's voice is just excellent. #9 &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is simply beautiful. Buy it now...you will not be disappointed.
B00005JM02|5.0|Wonderful casting in this movie.  I took my 6 yr old daughter and we had a blast.  The story is about a fish, Nemo, who was taken from his father, Marlin, by a fisherman and put in a fishtank in a dentist's office where he is awaiting delivery to the dentist's niece, who is quite frankly, very evil and quite homely.  EEK!!<BR>Anyway, Marlin goes in search of Nemo and befriends Dory, a fish with some problems remembering things.  Hilarity ensues and the plot is quite predictable but it is cute and Ellen Degeneres, who was the voice for \\"Dory\\" is soooooo funny.  She was the \\"only\\" person who could have done justice to this part.  She was perfect. perfect. perfect!  The animation by Pixar was outstanding.  Overall, a very good movie for the family.  Definitely one to buy.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I cant say exactly what a perfect circle makes me feel when i listen to their music but this cd did not disappoint me. APC never fails to make me weep like a child every time i listen to their music. Their songs always touch my heart. I reccomend the songs Gravity and Blue.
B00005JMD3|5.0|Okay, this isn't going to be an unbiased review.  I love Colin Farrell.  I really do.  The fact that he is a very gifted actor helps, but I would still love him anyway and he is in a uniform in almost the entire film carrying a gun and does life get any better than this?  I think not.  Colin, I think you are wonderful.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|On First listen I was overcome with the emotion and dedication that was put into this album. Hosting a new line up on this ablum and adding some refreshing faces to this album was what blew me away.Adding Jordie White, former bass player of marilyn manson, and James Iha of the Smashing Pumpkin fame on guitar. They compliment each other in a unforseen way, all coming from very diffrent backrounds.The Production quality of this album and the musicanmanship carrys you far into the emotion of the cd and intesifies the meaning and overall feeling of the cd.In one word to explain this cd is Beauty.
0385335482|5.0|First of all, I need to say that I love the heroine of this book, &quot;Becky Bloomwood.&quot;  I think she could honestly be my best friend, if she was real that is.  Okay, maybe I took the book too seriously...Sophie Kinsella's writing style is wonderful.  She flows from one thing to another without any breaks in the plot that leave you unfulfilled.  She left me wanting more so I bought both of her other &quot;Shopaholic&quot; books and I LOVE them too. <BR>It is the story of &quot;Becky&quot;, a lovely English girl who writes financial columns who tends to get herself into humorous financial situations because of a slight shopping addiction.  The ways she explains why she buys things are so funny I started crying because I , although not to her extent, have used some of these tactics on myself when shopping and justifying the need for certain items.  Sophie Kinsella has a very sharp sense of humor in her writing.  She is wonderful!!!  I give this 5 stars and if I could give it more, I would.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|This disc has got songs on it  -- like Montsegur, New Frontier, Paschendale -- that ought to put a big grin on the face of any Maiden fan.  The three-guitar mix sounds fantastic, big and clear; Bruce is in great form; songs range from short &amp; punchy to the orchestrated epics.  I'm a long-time fan who was disappointed with the 90s stuff, but BNW recharged my love of the band and DoD continues the upward trend.  Time will tell, I suppose, but I really believe that the best tracks on this disc will assume a place right alongside the &quot;classics&quot; of the Maiden canon.  Don't miss it!
B0000028PI|5.0|While Alice has certainly produced some fine albums since his 70's heyday, many longtime fans often complain that he hasn't made any album since that time, that stands up with Billion Dollar Babies or From The Inside. However, that perception would be inaccurate.<br />In 1994, Alice decided to return to his roots and the result was the Last Temptation. The album is a pure joy to listen to. It takes Alice character, Steven into the 1990's and presents him with all the temptations of the world. The songs are moody and hard rocking and the lyrics are classic Alice. Check out songs like &quot;Nothing's Free&quot; and &quot;Cleansed by Fire&quot; to see that even the more modern Alice still is one of the greatest forces in rock today. Be ashamed to call yourself an Alice fan and not own this masterpiece.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|After buying several of the Rolling Stones remasters last year, it was a delight to hear about Bob Dylan's back catalogue receiving the same SACD/hybrid CD remastering treatment. Instinctively, I bought 'Highway 61 Revisited' first out of all, and I only own a handful of selections (including the original cd pressing). Musically, this is archetypal Bob Dylan, and lyrically among his most oblique and challenging. 'Like A Rolling Stone' is one of his most famous selections and arguably among the greatest rock songs ever written. 'Ballad Of A Thin Man' is an eerie piano dirge about a despicable character by the name of Mr. Jones (who exactly is this guy?), and 'Desolation Row' is epic in every sense of the word with lyrics all over the place (Einstein and the jealous monk, Dr. Filth, Casanova, T.S. Eliot??). <br />I don't own an SACD-compatible cd player, but the regular stereo mix is good enough to merit re-purchasing the album. The difference is audible even on computer speakers; Dylan's voice much fuller and in the center, the low and mid-ranges given a boost, and the stereo separation is wider and much clearer. Listening on headphones is where the subtleties of the recording come alive better. The original cd pressing had a surprisingly good mix for its time, but the 2003 reissue blows the old cd away with a lively, yet subtle mix. Most notably present is the piano playing on many songs, especially 'Like A Rolling Stone', and the clarity of the improvised guitar line on 'Desolation Row', all given new life.<br />Bob Dylan's back catalogue has finally gotten the attention it needed on cd and I plan on getting at least 'Bringing It All Back Home' and 'Blonde On Blonde' next. Hopefully artists such as Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young will have their essential but poorly-mastered back catalogue remastered soon enough.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Its a great album as well as the first one as soon as you put in the cd your taken to a new level of mystery and fixed emotions listen to the bazzar lyrics of maynard and the odd timing beats of josh and the rest of the members take action this cd should be in your collection as well as it is in mine
B000002G7E|5.0|After listening to this incredible, album I was wondering why it only got a 4 star overview.  Well, a few had to post many poor reviews, giving this epic work a lower overall rating. Way to go.  So ignore the overall review and just try it for yourself.  If you are one who would rather listen to My Bloody Valentine, Slowdive, Sonic Youth, Jesus and the Mary Chain all the way to BMRC.  Then this is ground zero.  Put it on, find a mate and bite, pull, scream and tear the night apart. As far as the review that said it just sits beside Daydream Nation, so people can feel &quot;cool&quot; about themselves, is obviously a  long walk on the beach, soft nibbler.  If that is not you, and Aphex Twin II and late night Thai take out is more your speed.  Then buy, and get started.
B00005JLSE|4.0|A film by Rob Marshall<br />Considering that I saw this movie months after it had won the Oscar for Best Picture, I went into it with somewhat high expectations.  On that level, it was something of a disappointment.  It was a good movie, but not necessarily a great movie, and certainly not the best picture of all of 2002.  Granted, choosing the best picture is an entirely subjective task, but the movie wasn't all that it was cracked up to be.<br />The plotline of the movie has Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger) send to jail for murdering her boyfriend in cold blood, all the while trying to pin the murder on her husband Amos (John C Reilly).  Roxie wants to be a star; she wants to be on stage.  The man she was seeing told her that he had a connection and could get her an audition.  He was only trying to get Roxie in bed.  Roxie ends up in jail and she sees Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta Jones) is also in prison (for murdering her sister).  Velma was a huge star of the stage, and Roxie wanted to be just like her.  Fast talking lawyer Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) takes Roxie's case (along with that of Velma).  Velma and Roxie are also being assisted by the prison warden, Mama Morton (Queen Latifah).  Mama Morton can help out Roxie and Velma get in contact with Billy or make a phone call, but for a price.<br />The rest of the movie focuses on Roxie as Billy builds up her celebrity so that she can potentially be acquitted of the charges.  There are really two movies here.  First, is the real story of Roxie and how she gets to court.  The other movie here is the musical.  Unlike other musicals where the characters are just walking along and burst into song (and then carry on like nothing happened), the musical numbers in Chicago are fantasy sequences.  They are the imaginings of Roxie Hart (mostly) and give a better picture of her feelings than Zellweger's acting does.  Some of the musical numbers are just so so, but some are actually memorable (two that Richard Gere does, oddly enough).  There is a routine where Roxie feels that she is just Billy's puppet, and this was fantastic and the best one of the show.  Billy is in court and basically tap dances around a tricky situation, and we see Billy actually tap dancing.  John C Reilly gets one number, and that man can sing!  The real star of the show was not Renee Zellweger, but instead was Catherine Zeta Jones.  Sure, Zellweger was the lead, but Zeta Jones was the reason the movie was a success.  Nobody else commanded your attention like Velma.  Anytime she sang or danced, I couldn't look away.  Without question, she deserved her Oscar.<br />The movie talks about how celebrity is power.  If a celebrity can build up her image, she can literally get away with murder.  All they need is the right angle to play and maybe a fast talking lawyer.  Think about the parallels today: the biggest is obviously the O.J. Simpson case with Johnny Cochran as the lawyer.  But, any big case becomes bigger and more spectacular when the personal on trial has (or gets) a measure of celebrity.  Roxie Hart may be the lead character, but there are no heroes.  The only truly likable and sympathetic character is Roxie's husband, and he is a pushover.  We aren't supposed to relate with Roxie or Velma, but rather to look at how celebrity can corrupt the judicial system.<br />I know that Chicago won Best Picture.  I know that it was well regarded, and I'm not saying that it isn't a good movie.  It just wasn't a great movie.  To put it simply: Chicago did not live up to the hype.  All the ingredients were there, but it was a little underwhelming.  The only thing I can attribute this to is that Renee Zellweger, while she did a good job, could not command the screen.  She is fine in her role, but she is lacking in the power necessary to command attention.  Catherine Zeta Jones is an example of an actress commanding the screen.  If she was the lead, we might have had a different movie, but Roxie would have been a much stronger character (and thus the movie would have been stronger).  It's a good movie, not a great one, and there were better movies in 2002.ger character (and thus the movie would have been stronger).  It's a good movie, not a great one, and there were better movies in 2002.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|I have to admit that I was not impressed. Some of the album has its shining moments but for the most part its lame. The album is too polished, way too produced. Maybe they should have spent more time writting good songs, than trying to make badly written songs, into good ones. APC is suppose to be Maynards pop outlet and he has it. Too bad this album is not worth a damn. If you like polished brittney spears type albums with no soul then you will love this one. It's an album that was made for the girl rockers who like 80's type heavy metal. This album will offend on one.
0804106304|5.0|After letting the book sit on my shelf for more than a year, I finally decided to give The Joy Luck Club a chance.  All I knew is that it had something to do with the Chinese, Amy Tan was a well regarded author, and there was a movie made of the book (which I have not seen).  That's it.  I didn't quite know what to expect and when I saw the chapter list, I saw that there would be multiple narrators (a technique that can work very well).<br />I'll be honest, I don't remember a single character name and even during the book, I had a hard time remembering which character was which.  From the details provided in each chapter's narration, I knew who was talking, but I didn't know the name.  The Joy Luck Club is a story of mothers and daughters.  The Club itself was formed by four Chinese women who had emigrated from China to America (separately) and did not know anyone in the country.  It gave them a chance to become friends and share in each other's lives.  This was perhaps 40 years before the chapters dealing with their children.  One of the members of the original Club died, and her daughter was invited to take her place.  The Club, among other things, sits and plays Mah Jong late into the night and the game requires four players.  Each member of the club and their daughters tell their own stories and the story of their parents.  This reveals both how they came to be where they are and also how they view their family dynamic.  Some are more satisfied with their lives than others, but in all cases the story is intelligent and interesting.<br />This was Amy Tan's first novel and the only one that I have read that she has written.  Already I can tell that Tan is a major talent and an author from whom I look forward to reading her novels.  While The Joy Luck Club will not make my &quot;favorite novels&quot; list, this is still a very, very good novel.  Knowing what the subject matter is, if this interests you, give it a shot.
B00005NTN5|5.0|I was beyond blown away by this stunning film.  Gina Gershon who has rapidly become my favourite actress stars in this along with Jennifer Tilly (who I don't really care for, but plays her role quite well...)- its sexy, its suspensful and its smart.  It avoids all of the hollywood cliches and consumes you with its creative and incredible plot twists.<br />Corky (Gershon) is an ex-con who ends up working in a building that has mob-goings-on and meets Violet (Tilly) in the elevator one day while she's with her mob-boyfriend, Caeser (the guy from the sopranos) - there's instant attraction between the two females.  The two inevitably submit to their desire and hook up - then conceiving a plan to rob the mob.  It's really exciting and the girls have a really hot scene.  (It's converted me, kind of - Gina Gershon herself has made me 20% Lesbian with this)  Its really just a fabulous film - I HIGHLY recommend it.<br />Its entertaining, appealing and aesthetically pleasing (gershon).
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|If you liked Mer de Noms, you will love this CD!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|When I first heard about the next A Perfect Circle album all the way back in december, I could hardly wait. After Mer de Noms, in which the band come across like Tool's older, wiser and more spiritual brother, I was unsure whether the band could do better. After finally getting hold of a copy, all my fears were assuaged.<BR>  Originally, the album merely appears to be good, easily a great buy. And then you listen again and hear a bit more. One more of Maynard's soulful lyrics and an extra depth to a guitar riff. It gets better and better with each listen and soon you become unable to part with it.<BR>  The inspiring first track is beautiful and then 'Weak and Powerless' is by far the most powerful new track I have heard this year. 'The Noose' and 'Blue' also feature fantastic lyrics and amazing guitar riffs. Finally, the moment you fall in love with the album is when you notice the parody of the riff from 'Judith' towards the end of the album.<BR>  My favourite album of the year by far and it will be interesting to see how it compares to Tool's next album, to see whether they share this change in direction. Do not fear. Those new to A Perfect Circle will fall in love and fans of Mer de Noms will be far from disappointed.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This record has nothing to do with the first APC record. Mer de Noms followed most of the rock'nroll structures and rules but 13th Step is almost avantgard in some parts. It will drag you down, embrace you and welcome you to its own little sphere. Songs like &quot;The Noose&quot;, &quot;A Stranger&quot; or the Failure cover &quot;The Nurse Who...&quot; are not compareable to anything else out there right now. Maynards vocals sound better than ever and Billy's great songwriting and guitar playing is shown in almost every song. Josh Freese's unique and clean drumming gives every tune on this record another dimension. Add James Iha and Jeordie White and you have a great band that made a great record. For me the album of the year so far.
B00006690G|5.0|I had loved the Slim Shady LP and Marshall Mathers LP before Eminem Show had been released.  I was looking forward to it because I knew he was not going to miss.  After listening to this straight through and loving every minute of it, my opinion about his first 2 lp's slowly started to change.  Not in a bad way, but in a way that shows that Eminem has outdone himself once again.<br />Without a doubt, this is Eminem's best cd out of his 3 LPs.  Taking the reins on his album, he does the majority of the producing.  You can see his obvious growth from his previous two albums to this one because he has left the gay-bashing and wife-killing lyrics on the shelf this time.  Instead he takes a stand on political issues (White America), hip hop's issues (\\"Hip hop is in a state of 911\\" from the song Business), women issues (Superman) as well as his own issues (Soldier, Say Goodbye to Hollywood).  The hit singles \\"Without Me\\", \\"Sing for the Moment\\", and \\"cleanin' out my closet\\" kept him on top of the charts for pretty much all of 2002 and part of 2003.  You can tell from a few songs that he still has issues with his mother and Kim, as they are mentioned in several verses.  Em tries to take a stab at singing in \\"Hailie's Song\\" and while he's no American Idol, the song was still enough to touch me.  An angry delivery ensues in my favorite track \\"Till I Collapse\\" where Em spits angry grimy lyrics.  The last \\"controversial\\" track if you can call it that is called \\"My Dad's Gone Crazy\\".  I've seen some reviews that said Eminem is a bad influence over his daughter for including her in a song with those kinds of lyrics.  Obviously nobody has heard of audio editing where he inserted his daughter's vocals into the song.  Now that I've put that ballot to rest, moving on to \\"Sing for the Moment\\" which uses the sample of \\"Dream on\\" by Aerosmith.  Sing is another great song with more real lyrics from Eminem.  \\"Say what you say\\" is probably the weakest effort along with \\"Drips\\" but these below average tracks are not nearly enough to bring down this 5 star album.  Eminem needs to ditch these clowns he is hanging around with (50 cent, G-unit, d12, obie trice, etc) and go solo.  Eminem himself is powerful enough to carry a label.  He doesn't need anyone.<br />In any event, whether you love him or hate him, there is no denying his lyrical as well as his production talent in this album.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Once again, a collection of musicians have come together to create a most awesome audio experience. With each endeavor undertaken by Maynard (and all of the talent he manages to assemble) the music and lyrics take on a life of their own. Just a little something to alter those brain waves.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD!  I bought it because it was cheap at Target and it hasn't left my cd player since. This is one of the best male singer/songwriters that I've heard in a REALLY LONG TIME! There are some similarities to Ben Folds but Gavin is in a league of his own.  His music is just fun to listen to.  Don't let this guy pass you ear without giving him a really good listen!
B00005Y7L4|5.0|This is one of the best movies EVER~! I watched this for the frist time at a friends and i couldnt get enough, i simply cant wait until all of the books r out. BEST PLOT EVER!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I love the new album, Maynard is a genius even if he isnt with Tool! It goes to show you that one man can have the two best bands in Rock! I especially like 'The Noose' it is a badass tune! Buy the album and find out for yourself what you are missing!
B00007BK2N|5.0|As a student in the 1980's I remember the Factory Records phenomena and was a passionate fan (still am) of Joy Division and New Order and this film was 2 hours of nostalgia heaven for me.Everything seemed to blend and work well.The actors (especially Danny Cunningham as Shaun Ryder and John Simm as Bernie Sumner) bore an uncanny resemblence to their characters physically and Steve Coogan has never been better.Move over Alan Partridge and Paul Calf.A special mention must also go to Frank Cottrill Boyce's script for it's authenticity and the ever excellent Robby Muller's photography for it's grimy views of Manchester.I also think Michael Winterbottom has not made a finer film.<BR>Yet it's the music that makes the film.For Brits like myself it's like time travel.For anyone else it's a chance to learn the story behind some of the best music of the 80's and how 'Madchester' became 'Gunchester'.The film doesn't sugarcoat everything.The gang warfare in Manchester was frightening and the film conveys the decline of the Hacienda well.<BR>There are no Hollywood happy endings here,no stars.It's often unflinching but is so unmistakably British and so well acted it should and deserves to do well in America.One film everyone must see this year.No film is perfect but this one comes bloody close.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Not to sound like a groupie but this band is so refreshing. In a world of music where everythng sounds the same and not too many try to create art- APC steps right up and lays everything out on the line.  From the lyrics- to the music- the production value- all above and beyond. Comparing this to Mer De Noms- there is no comparison. These are 2 different animals. Blown away by their debut- I find myself  unable to listen to anything else but the 13th step.This is the first cd I have owned where everyday since I have gotten it, I have had a new favorite song. If you are a fan of Maynard- you will love the way he chooses to sing on these tracks. This is not Tool Lite, as some have mislabeled Mer de Noms- this album has a feel that is not only original but fresh. Im finding myself at a loss for words when trying to describe this album. I can say this- you will not be disappointed- If your a fan of good quality music, this is an album for you. To be honest and blunt- I feel a lot more emotion in this album than I have from anything else that has come out in the past 2 years. <BR>If mer de noms was a debut that said- HEY, HERE WE ARE!! then the Thirteenth Step is an album that says-  Now that you know who we are- lets connect on a deeper level and make things more personal.   <BR>Blown away yet again, not overly surprised, extremely happy with this album- GO BUY IT- and Enjoy!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I have had this CD in my cd player on repeat for an entire week, and it looks like it's going to stay there much longer.  That's how /good/ this CD is.
B000005JA8|1.0|I bought this album back when I was in college based upon the fine review given it by Roliing Stone and the fact that Beefheart was associated with Zappa. I knew Zappa was bizarre but in a very humorous sort of way; therefore I figured the dear Captain would spring from the same vein. Oh dear lord ... was I mistaken. I didn't have much money back in those college days, and when I purchased any new music I had to feel that the expense was justified by the product that I purchased. I can honestly say that this is absolutely the worst album ever produced in the history of pop misic. It is totally unlistenable. This was the only time that I ever purchased a record and destroyed it immediately after a single listening (in fact I have never destroyed any recording other than this). As soon as I realized the ugly truth that I has been ripped off and conned I broke the vinyl into as many pieces as I could and set the pieces on fire. I thought about sending the ashes to C.B.'s supposed fan club along with my comments, but I figured he was already laughing on the way to the bank. For God's sake, please don't waste your money on this piece of trash.
B0000542DJ|5.0|Now that some time has passed and the dust has settled, JFK can be looked at as a movie that is NOT historically accurate portrayl of what went down on that fateful day in Dallas, but rather an engaging, nail-biting thriller.<br />Whether you agree or disagree with Stone's view, there is no disputing the craftsmenship that went into this film. The use of multiple film stocks that create layers upon layers of interpretation of the events depicted. The editing alone is masterful as Stone juggles many subplots at once. Robert Richardson's cinematography is incredible (there's a reason why he won the Academy Award that year) and has become Stone's signature look.<br />And there is the cast: Kevin Costner does a fine job as the Gary Cooper-ish Jim Garrison who doggedly pursues his investigation. From here on in, there is a staggering who's who of big name and character actors filling in major and minor roles: Jack Lemmon, Walter Matthau, Tommy Lee Jones, Kevin Bacon, Vincent D'Onofrio, Gary Oldman, Joe Pesci, and the list goes on. Everybody does a great job and give the film an authenticity and believability.<br />This new, 2-DVD set is a HUGE improvement over the old, single flipper-disc. The entire movie (Stone's preferred cut) is now on one side and included is a fascinating audio commentary by Stone who manages to keep it going for the entire running time! His commentaries have always been a real treat to listen to and he does not disappoint on this one.<br />The highlight of disc two is a nice collection of deleted and extended scenes with commentary by Stone. It's pretty obvious why they were cut but nice that he included them.<br />This is a DVD that should be in every movie lover's collection. It's an important work and a cinematic landmark. It's influence can be felt in the TV show, 24 and the made-for-TV movie, The Pentagon Papers. I would also recommend picking up the annotated screenplay to the film which acts as the perfect companion to the film.
B0000042H4|5.0|Some people are put off by the fact that the Ring has 14 hours of music (up to 16 hours if the conductor is slow). But have no fear, the Solti Ring is here. Solti keeps the music moving along so you don't feel bored. Also, the Ring contains Wagner's best music. Don't be daunted by 14 hours of music, you are missing out of 14 hours of miraculous music
B00005JLKB|5.0|Smallville is the best shows on TV. It tells the story of a young Clark Kent before he makes his way to Metropolis and becomes superman. <BR>     Clark(Tom Welling)has the same problems that other teenagers do and is also trying to deal with his developing powers. He is desperatly trying to win the heart of Lana Lang(Kristin Kruek..who is the most gorgeous girl in the world). <BR>     He also befriends a young Lex Luthor(Michael Rosenbaum) before he goes evil and wants to dominate the world. The two's developing friendship is great and so ironic.<BR>     The first season of Smallville is outstanding. It's a great addition to the superman story. It's clean, family oriented, and is fun for the whole family. I'm 19 years old, and it's not to often that my 3 brothers, 2 sisters, and mom and dad can agree on one show. Smallville is one of the shows and I'm sure you'll enjoy it too, if you'll watch it. Don't miss out on the DVD.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|I need to rave for a minute before I review:     Rufus has this amazing power to create a completely hook-laden, singable melody which perfectly describes a mood, and then subtly change it over the course of the song, brightening or darkening it with burst-out-of-the-clouds moment...  similar to maybe Thom Yorke or Will Oldham in his melodic flourish.  That aspect of his songwriting completely blows me away.    Now, review.  The orchestration, harmonies, big buildups, and european fetishism are all there, but he adds so much that makes it worth listening to.   New textures, moods, even a bit of opera in the first track.      The difference at first listen is that the lyrics seem more earnest than on Poses or his debut.  Not necessarily in a soul-baring way, but it does seem to have an even mix of songs which feel like they should be Cole Porter standards, and songs which are a little more lyrically askew and give the impression of having come from his life.    Looking forward to Want Two...
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Maynard and Billy have created another masterpiece, the first being MDN. This cd sounds more like tool in many aspects than the first. The single &quot;weak and powerless&quot; has tool-ish rhythms and of course Maynards distinctive voice and exceptional thought provoking lyrics. The opener, The Package, starts rather slowly with a droning bass and tom rhythm. The song then explodes with frontal guitar riffs and time change signatures with a well orchestrated guitar solo by Billy. Another highlight of the record is The Outsider. It is another of the harder edged syncopated rockers. Pet rounds out the assault with a Manson type bass line (jeordie) and interesting guitar interplay. I hear that Pet is the only song off 13th step that has the full new apc band (James Iha, Jeordie)lineup in place and represents the new direction of the band. A must get album with all other bands sounding the same, apc breaks new ground, again. 5 stars
B0000AR8NK|3.0|Delivered by a band of experienced sessioneers we have mostly a big muscular Tin Machine sound allied to some retro Glam-Rock decorated with some pretty dumb lyrics.<br />I stopped listening to DB after Tonight and Tin Machine 1, and haven't missed anything, so far as I can hear from this outing.<br />The less seasoned DB fen should find this comparatively okay, but I think he needs to freshen it up a bit and get away from the Laughing Gnome lyrics.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A Perfect Circle has produced yet another masterpiece.  With their intense lyrics and the glorious sounds of the guitar, you are taken to a place that no other band could possibly take you.  Thirteenth Step is a wonderful follow-up to their first album.  While it may not be as hard hitting it truly showcases each of their talents.  From Maynard's hypnotic voice to Billy's amazing guitar playing this album has genius written all over it.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|THIS CD IS AMAZING, I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD LIKE THEIR FIRST CD BETTER.  BUT ONCE I HEARD THIS CD I LOVED IT.  MUCH LIKE THE FIRST CS I CAN'T PUT IT DOWN, MAYNARD HAD AN AMAZING VOICE, AND FINALLY TWIGGY AKA Jeordie White WILL GET THE CREDIT HE DESERVES AS AN AWESOME BASSIST. THIS IS THE BEST PIECE OF MUSIC TO COME OUT IN A LONG ASS TIME ANYONE WHO THINKS OTHER WISE SHALL BE PUT TO DEATH...
0060012331|4.0|The Character development is just not what I expect from Pratchett
630463949X|5.0|WOW, Lindsey Buckingham. I bought this to learn to play &quot;landslide&quot; and rekindle fond memory of their best songs. But after  owning it for weeks, I found myself watching &quot;Go Insane&quot; over and over again (along with Big love and landslide), not that I don't like other songs, it's just the way Lindsey performed &quot;Go Insane&quot; that keeps me mesmerized (simply don't have time to watch other tracks), you feel the fire, the passion, the emotion, the intensity from him and, My God, his guitar, the vibrant arpeggio and the furious strumming will leave sighs in your heart. If you play guitar at all (classical, pop, doesn't matter), you HAVE to see this.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|APC totally comes through with this album. Been listening to it for a week straight. Its not very often that I buy an album where I like every track. Fine job done all around.
B00007LTIA|4.0|To longtime fans: Anyone notice the little burst of static in one of the last spots where Jon sings &quot;Nous sommes du soleil,&quot; in &quot;Ritual&quot;? Listen to it now after the 19-min mark. Was that always there? I doubt it -- I've known this album back to front since 1981. Have to bring out the Gastwirt version now. And what about 12 or so minutes into &quot;Revealing,&quot; where it starts sounding...louder. I know Inglott and team did some fine work on this release, but it's unforgiveable passing off as perfect product something he actually effed up. Even one mess-up means they should admit the (apparently unfixable?) mistake and sell the thing for way less.
B0000AZJXQ|1.0|This CD is sort of boring. I was expecting a lot more from such a talented group of musicians. This album lacks the passion, energy and drive of the first One. I suppose if you're looking for a good CD to fall asleep to, buy it, but if you like your albums to rockout a little, save your money.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I respect the group Tool and enjoy a lot of their songs but it never influenced how I feel about this band, nor do I think people should compare the two (it's just not right). I mainly buy their music simply for the lead singer's haunting voice which sends shivers down my spine, but when APC came out with a subtler, melodic approach, and with Maynard as the front vocalist, my head was spinning with sheer delight. Around the birth of this phenomenal band I begin hating 90% of what was being played on the radio (especially when it comes to today's mainstream rock, which absolutely sucks!) but I was saved with relief when A Perfect Circle made their name known. 'Thirteenth Step' is the much anticipated follow-up to 2000's 'Mer de Noms' - a dark, atmospheric masterpiece that garnered this group (not a side-project!) a healthy amount of devoted listeners. Compared to most other bands being heard by the majority of mass consumers less fortunate to discover other acts that are far more talented, such as Vast, Porcupine Tree, Mostly Autumn and Lacuna Coil, the material here is a hell of a lot better. I gotta admit though, some of the songs are seriously lacking and I tend to skip them. A couple few sound unfinished; like more could have been done to it. Overall the album's worth buying but I think they could have spent more time building some of the songs. The ballads took some getting used to and I could have lived without \\"Crimes\\" and \\"Lullaby\\" (two lack-luster tunes that I consider to be intros) but the slight change in sound will likely grow on you, as it did me. I'm impressed with most of the full-length tracks and am once again entranced with Billy Howerdel's guitar playing and Maynard's hypnotic cooing; I just wish they would have recorded at least two extra songs in addition to what's already on here. The lyrics are brilliantly clever, as heard on \\"The Noose\\" ('...and not to pull your halo down, around your neck and tug you off your cloud') but when it comes down to it, the music is what's most important and APC delivers yet another amazing record; however, I'm truly greedy and want more, more, more!<br />I'm already looking forward to their third release because A Perfect Circle is very addictive.it, the music is what's most important and APC delivers yet another amazing record; however, I'm truly greedy and want more, more, more! <br />I'm already looking forward to their third release because A Perfect Circle is very addictive.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|At first I was very disappointed to see that this was only a clipped pan and scan version, see my previous review below. Now, after a bit of research I'm estatic to see thats its not !!! Below is information found on fireflyfans.net <br />\\"To give you a quick response to a complicated subject... <BR>The Firefly DVD will be in the 16:9 format (1.78:1). <br />I know that there are a multitude of issues surrounding the definitions of \\"letterbox\\" \\"widescreen\\" & \\"anamorphic\\" etc, but I'll be real practical here: <br />We shot the show on 35mm film in an aspect ration of 1.78:1 with a 1.33:1 (or 4:3) box to enable us to deliver both a \\"regular\\" TV version and a \\"widescreen\\" TV version to Fox Broadcasting. (Firefly was always conceived as a 16:9 show, but Fox, as a policy, does not broadcast any letterboxed shows. That being said, their HDTV broadcasts do go out widescreen.) <br />As for any differences in what you've already seen, we might have rendered some of the title work in 1.85:1 (anamorphic) but I really can't remember. <br />The bottom line is: What you are getting on DVD is what Joss intended: 16:9. No fake letterbox bars on a 4:3 show, no \\"panned and scanned\\" anything, just Serenity and her crew in glorious widescreen! <br />Hope that clarifies things.\\" <br />To me this is great news !!! I'm now going to go ahead and pre-order this asap.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|This movie appeared toward the close of the John Wayne era, and not long after the beginning of the Clint Eastwood era of westerns.  In those days, western heroes stood and fought against overwhelming odds, and did not take insults from anyone.  In the midst of this, Paul Newman and Robert Redford star in this film about two outlaws who turn tail and run when the going gets tough.  Newman and Redford star (respectively) as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, two goodhearted outlaws who decide that living on the run is more desirable than dying where they are.  When a super posse of lawmen and trackers comes after them, Butch and Sundance head for Bolivia.  There it is assumed they died, though no one knows for sure.<BR> <BR>William Golding (who wrote The Princess Bride) wrote the screenplay for this film, and did a wonderful job of bringing these two most lovable of outlaws to life.  Golding manages to capture the essence of these two men--they were not inherently evil (they did do a number of charitable deeds with the money they stole), but were outlaws by trade, not by hatred of humanity.  They robbed because they knew how to do little else, not because they enjoyed inflicting pain upon others.  And even though Sundance was legendary with a gun, these two bandits did not enjoy killing, and did so only when it was a necessary part of their work.<BR> <BR>A tremendous amount of mystery surrounds the eventual fate of these two men.  Many believe they died in Bolivia, though others think this was simply a ruse and that Butch and Sundance continued to live in the United States under different identities.  There is also much controversy surrounding Sundance's woman and the exact location of their hideout.  Many of these questions may never be answered, and depictions like this one are often the best we can do to understand the lives of those men whose true fate we don't know.<BR> <BR>This film is a classic western, and well deserves the fame and the awards it received.Newman and Redford are spectacular together, and both give outstanding performances.  This is one of the best movies about the American west, even if it does feature protagonists who don't stay and fight like John Wayne would.  Instead, the realism and personality of these men make them all the more endearing to the viewer, and the result is a film about two outlaws who were nothing if they weren't human.
B000001ELR|5.0|At the time Kiss released Creatures Of The Night, the band's future was in doubt. Their previous three albums Dynasty, Unmasked, and Music From The Elder were all among their worst work as a band at the time and sounded very little like the Kiss that their dedicated fans loved from 1974-78. Changes in their sound such as the pop on Unmasked and the strings and horns that cluttered Music From The Elder turned many of their longtime fans off. There was also turmoil within the band. Longtime drummer Peter Criss and lead guitarist Ace Frehley were replaced by the more talented Eric Carr and Vinnie Vincent respectively. The band felt that a return to their roots was in order and they went back to basics on Creatures Of The Night.<br /><br />Although the album didn't return the band to the superstardom they had achieved in the mid-70's, Creatures Of The Night was a return to form and was the first of their three consecutive '80s albums that would be among the strongest heavy metal released during that era. Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons sound reborn here, penning their best collection of tracks since the Destroyer album. Gene sounds downright menacing on the very strong tracks \\"Killer\\", \\"Rock and Roll Hell\\", \\"War Machine\\", and the near hit single and the now classic \\"I Love It Loud.\\" Paul Stanley's songs are also top notch with his best tracks being the title track, \\"Keep Me Comin'\\", and the ballad \\"I Still Love You\\", one of the band's best all-time slower tracks. Paul's vocals also are stronger here and aren't nearly as high pitched as on future releases. Eric Carr's drumming is way up in the mix, very heavy, and his performance here is strong throughout. Although Ace Frehley was pictured on the original album cover, he didn't play on the album. Vinnie Vincent's playing on the album proves he was a stronger guitarist than Frehley and he would show he was a very capable songwriter as well on their next album Lick It Up. The best track here is Gene Simmons' \\"Saint and Sinner\\", a song that is criminally neglected as it's never mentioned as one of their best tracks and has never been featured on any of their future live albums or best of compilations. Kiss fans already know how great this album is. Anyone who didn't think that Kiss was a heavy metal band should check this out. Highly recommended.ng that is criminally neglected as it's never mentioned as one of their best tracks and has never been featured on any of their future live albums or best of compilations.

0393057658|4.0|I came across Michael Lewis' Moneyball through an excerpted article in the New York Times Magazine one Sunday back in the spring.  Not being a huge baseball fan, I was still fascinated by the success of the Oakland A's despite having a budget less than a quarter of some of the top paying teams (i.e. Yankees, Mets, Dodgers, etc.).  I was intrigued by the article and sent innumerable copies to friends:  first to baseball fans and then just to fans of good writing.  Almost all of them read the article (or so they told me), and we all basically had the same reaction:  can't wait to read the book.<br />Unfortunately, I think that the story was better as a long magazine article, rather than stretched out to book length.  Unlike the article, the book was slow getting going, with the personal history of Billy Beane.  Once the story moved into the offices of the Oakland A's, the book became much more interesting.  I particularly liked the fast paced atmosphere that Lewis recreates surrounding the draft and the mid-season trading period.  In fact, some of these reminded me of his best writing about the bond trading floors in Liar's Poker. <br />Overall, Michael Lewis has detailed a very interesting angle on success in baseball, although he might have done it with 50 fewer pages without losing anything.  For anyone interested in baseball (or particularly the business end of it), I think that this book will make fascinating reading.  For those interested in underdogs succeeding, you might enjoy this as well.  At a minimum, anyone who appreciates good non-fiction writing should read the NYT Magazine article, and then get more details in the book if they like it.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I must say that I was very excited to hear the new APC and was I ever not disappointed!  With the new additions of James and Jeordieformerly known as &quot;Twiggy&quot;  I was excited to hear something new from him.  And this album is FLAWLESS.  It is a musical journey that is indescribable.  Every emotion you can fathom is right here on this cd.  Thanks guys for all the effort you put into this record.  It was well worth the wait and I hope the rest of the world is ready for it.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|Admittedly, this is the first time I've heard of Klaus Bedalt, and therefore was a little unsure on what the music would be lilke.<BR>Listening to the tracks, I was suitably impressed. Not only has he captured the spirit of the movie, he has also steered clear of the stereotypical sounds associated with pirate movies in general (eg, pipe music, etc).<br />A little too short for my liking, the music takes you instantly back to the movie, highlighting the scenes they came from with distinct sounds. For example, in track 2, 'The Medallion Calls', there is definately a military undertone which takes you back to the the English-governed port and all its formality.<BR>Track 5 'Swords Crossed', you can nearly experience the daring sword-fight between Jack and Will. And in track 7, 'Barbosa is Hungry', there is a dark undertone, illuminated once by the haunting call of a flute and accompanied by a humble male chorus. You can nearly experience the panic Elizabeth felt when confronted by the skeletal crew, and yet later on feel the wind in your hair as your ship cruises towards the horizon.<br />Littered throughout the CD is the constant theme which embraces the swashbuckling nature of the film, altered at times to accent the mood and setting brought about by the scene from whence it was set.<br />A thoroughly good listen, and an excellent soundtrack that will keep you constantly humming the main theme for days
B00009V7P8|5.0|but in a good way.  Inside is a 10-song set of pure poignancy and you'd be a fool to write this one off as just another lightweight folk album.  Rice's voice is simple and gentle and reaches areas of cutting, raw emotion.  The melodies are fantastic and Hannigan's guest vocals only make this a more rich listen.  This is the CD I use as a capper to my day.  It's the perfect album to ease me to sleep, like a lullabye.  This is definitely the best I've heard this year and easily earns its 5-stars!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Thirteenth Step is superb in its melodic dreamscape. With each song I felt drawn into a new world form love to hate to death to life. Maynards voice is as velvety smooth as I have ever heard it and the music is amazingly soothing yet also angry at times. I was totally suprised by this cd and happy to hear that it was not the &quot;same ol' same ol'&quot;. It is nice to know that there are bands out there that still believe in change and chance (as in &quot;lets take a chance and write whats in our souls and play whats in our hearts&quot;) AperfectCircle breaks from the drab and mundane and reminds us what music is really all about...Incredible!!! Thank you..thank you..thank you.. (Now I can't wait for some new Tool!!!)
0385504209|1.0|I am a fan of DALE BROWN (Dan's brother) so I thought I would give the Da Vinci Code a try.  The book is intriguing at first, but poorly written and filled with half-truths and out-right lies.  Mostly based on Anti-Catholic myth and pagan symbology, there is ZERO evidence to support the claims made in the book<br />If you are an ANTI-CATHOLIC, you will love the book.  The simple facts are that the Holy Roman Catholic Church is THE FINAL word on Christ.  The Church has the historians and scholars that can read the original scriptures written in Ancient Greek, no other church does!  That is a FACT JACK!<br />Dan Brown is no Dale Brown.  Dale should knock the heck out of his little brother, who obviously envies Dale's success.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|It is any fan's first instinctual reaction to listen to one of their favorite bands' new CD and start raving &quot;This is the best album i have ever heard! Ever!&quot; and then eventually you come off the high and find it's flaws and weaknesses. Let it be known i am having a hard time coming down off of that high! Thirteenth Step is not only a great step for APC as a band, but for music as a whole. The band made a gigantic leap from masters of melodic rock, to masterful composers through the course of Thirteenth Step. One has a delightfully difficult time picking out what is the &quot;guitar part&quot; or the &quot;bass part&quot; throughout the CD because it all gels together so well into a masterpiece of delicious listening. Maynard, as usual, does not let us down in his finest vocal work to date. MJK simply croons his way throughout the album, refusing to sing what you WANT to be there, but what you need to hear to connect on multiple emotional levels with the music. The Nurse Who Loved Me showcases MJK's vocal talents in a forum and a key we are not usually accustomed to, and it's such a treat. Also, Josh Freese continues to achieve the difficult task of making a simple drum beat...catchy. It is, in my opinion, Josh's delicate snare drum work that absolutely makes this album his best work. Thirteenth Step is just one of those albums that will transcend through generations, trends, and genres and remain an amazing and classic album for countless years to come! *tips hat* thank you kind gentlemen of APC, for this album is truly a wonderous gift!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I felt good about spending money on this CD.  It was as good as expected. Very powerful music that actually places a demand on the listener.  Looking forward to seeing them live.
B0000028VT|3.0|This album should be consider Mariah's peak album!, totally classic, overselling 10 million copies!, including the number one hits Hero and Dreamlover.  I totally hated is &quot;Never Forget You&quot;: I don't get this track!, many people like it, but for me is totally boring and does not apport nothin' new, why if Babyface made such great tracks for Madonna and Toni make this dreadful song for MC.  I remember the video of &quot;Dreamlover&quot; was the first shocker of this album.  &quot;Music Box&quot; for my taste is the best track of the album, makes you want to sleep and hug somebody! a total love declaration!, &quot;Anytime You Need A Friend&quot; I love the lyrics, but I must said I enjoyed the C&amp;C Dance Mix better!, &quot;Without You&quot;, this cover is way better than the original, Mariah's voice sound strangely painful here, this is a 90's ballad classic!, this album is worth it, a great stand out.  Some fillers like the last two ballads(Just To Hold.., All I've Ever...), remain unnoticed. The C&amp;C produce tracks &quot;Now That I Found You&quot; and &quot;I've Been Thinking About You&quot; are great dance numbers and they take out the album monotony.  &quot;Hero&quot; a classic, I shoul've give a 4 stars to this album but &quot;Never Forget You&quot; is sooooo bad I'm givin it 3 for it!
B0000AI44Q|1.0|I have to admit I did not buy &quot;greedale,&quot; but anyone who went to see ole Neil live this summer (2003)probably wouldn't either.  His live concert was all about &quot;greendale&quot; and featured, almost entirely &quot;greendale&quot; songs.  If I hear one more stupid song about &quot;granpa&quot; etc, I think I'll puke.  Generally, I am a huge Neil Young fan, but he really did us a diservice this summer with a rock opera about some bogus hippie family.  Give me a break Neil!  I'm in my late thirties (like most of your fans, many of which were literally sleeping at your &quot;greendale&quot; concert)and I don't need to be preached to or &quot;awakened&quot; to the state of our society.  Just go back to playing vintage &quot;grunge&quot; rock and let us decide for ourselves what political causes we will get involved in etc.
B000002AVF|4.0|This was my first Mariah Carey album, I bought it because I couldn't get enough of &quot;Fanstasy&quot; the only upbeat track of the album, that introduce us to the mind of someone who's love hasn't come true, great beats!, great lyrics!, the rest of the album is well produced, but is a little to slow, it should have include at least one more upbeat song, cuz the daydream inturlude it's just wrong!, the best tracks for my taste are:<BR>&quot;Always Be My Baby&quot; a little corny but it's okay, &quot;Long Ago&quot; great meaning and beat, this song was the predecessor of Butterfly's tracks, &quot;Underneath The Stars&quot; so sweet, &quot;Forever&quot;, my second favorite, timeless love lyrics, sound like a 50's song, &quot;One Sweet Day&quot; I hated this song so much back in the day, but now I learned to rejoice the lyrics and the meaning of it. The Other songs are too much alike(When I Saw You, I Am Free, Melt Away), I feel like their are filler, except for &quot;Looking In&quot; wich I consider a teaser, to taste a different Mariah.  This album deserves the 4 stars because of the killer tracks that are include here and for the classic status of the album selling over 10 million copies.  But to tell you the truth, in the middle of the album you will be SLEEPING!, so if you want to listen to Forever or Long Ago skip the filler tracks!
0440234743|4.0|I had to read this for a worldview class for my degree and really didn't know how well I would like it.  It was easy reading and so interesting, I felt like I was reading it for pleasure!

Words cant describe it - but ill try anyway!<BR> This album follows on so well from Mer De Noms and adds so much more to the incredible atomospheric, theatrical, incredible band that is APC. <BR> Every single track shines with oustanding quality, its gotta be the best album ive listened to all year! :)<BR>Masterpiece!
B000088E6D|5.0|oh my gosh!!  this guy has such an amazing voice!!  i mean, i am 15 years old and completely wrapped up in this music like sinatra and dean.  my dad and i pop this cd in the player when we are driving and sing our hearts out!!  this guy is amazing!!  nobody could ever replace the one and only frank sinatra, but micheal here is going to give him the biggest run for his money he has seen a real long time!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|this album is just pure poetry, anyone who doesnt appreciate this album, is simply not very into maynards style.  if you are looking for hard core rock, go look up godsmack or disturbed.  if you want some great songs, with phenomenal, mind blowing lyrics, then look no further than any album by Tool or A Perfect Circle.  First thing i gotta say, the album is really really soft when compared to Mer De Noms, and any Tool Album, however what it lacks in raw power, it more than make up with emotional angst.  this album is just fantastic, specifically &quot;Weak And Powerless&quot;, &quot;Gravity&quot;, &quot;Blue&quot;, &quot;The Package&quot;, &quot;Vanishing&quot;, &quot;A Stranger&quot;, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, &quot;A Stanger&quot; and particularly &quot;Pet&quot;<br />Pet is the one song that you wont forget, seriously, the riffs in this song are mind blowing, and the lyrics are just...well...any word i can think of, such as &quot;fantastic&quot; &quot;phenomenal&quot; or such simply doesnt do it justice.<br />Lyrically this album will definately get it done for you.<br />i HIGHLY recommend this.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Thirteenth Step is not an album you can listen to once and become aquainted with.  It is not an album you can listen to multiple times in passing and nod your head to or an album fit for background ambiance (at first).  As with many of the world's best albums, A Perfect Circle's sophomore effort is one of those albums that takes multiple very intent listenings to even begin to hear.<br />On first listen the album appears too studio, too buffed out with effects.  It's a little confusing and hard to fathom, and some of it doesn't completely stick with you after just one or two listens.  But strokes of beauty cascade you each listen, from the first out, and before you know it all that exists is overwhelming beauty.<br />Too much time on Billy Howerdel's hands on first listen turns into incredibly constructed soundscapes of experimentation and depth.  It's an ambitious and brave album, reaching far, but rarely ever farther than it should.<br />For a CD like this to come out of a revolving door of band members is amazing in itself.  It is a CD that will keep you listening for days on end.<br />There is too much to say about each individual song.  The album ranges from heart-wrenching subtle beauty to heavy guitar riffs one would not expect after Mer de Noms, and all of it is well worth it.<br />And of course, as well as the all the players play on this album, one cannot review an APC or Tool album without mentioning Maynard's godly voice.  There really is nothing to say to even begin to touch upon this immesurable force.  Words are almost infinite, but they end just before his voice begins.<br />Give this CD a chance and you won't need to buy another CD for months.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|APC has taken a major step forword with their newest cd, Thirteenth Step. While Mer de Noms put them on the map.. this cd takes the intensity and emotion in the previous cd to an even higher level.<br />Its hard to describe each song in words, but when played... i feel this cd is generally mellower, and much better flowing then the previous cd, whith songs having common themes and connecting with each other. Not to mention Maynards lyrics and vocals, which be it with Tool OR APC, challenge your mind, your beliefs, and are pure poetry.<br />The Package-- An excellent opener to the cd.. and the longest song APC has done at 7+ minutes. After a long slow build-up, this song explodes into Heavy riff, immediatly setting the tempo for the album...<br />Weak and Powerless -- The first single.. and a good song, with some interesting lyrics<br />The Noose -- One of my favorites of Thirteenth Step, a rather mellow, but amazing track that reminds me a lot of Tool's The Patient. Brilliant song<br />Blue -- Great vocals from Maynard on another rather mellow, but good track<br />Vanishing -- This track strikes me as kind of an odd darker track, a quiet opening, a sudden pick up, and then a mellow groove. Intriguing and enjoyable track<br />The Stranger -- Sort of the &quot;3 Libras&quot; of the CD if you will, this one has a very mellow, acoustic sound with no drums. Relaxing.<br />The Outsider -- Rocking song, with powerful lyrics... a real wake-up call to those who had been relaxing to the mellow stuff. <br />Crimes -- an interlude with counting..<br />Nurse who loved me -- the VERY mellow cover of the Failure song by the same name. Imagine Maynard singing a love song..  yea.. Beautiful, but a little freaky!<br />Pet -- My favorite, and a great rocking song with amazing lyrics.<BR>brilliant<br />Lullaby -- The live intro song.. interlude<br />Gravity -- A great close out song, harmonic... amazing.<br />All in all, the Album has not left my CD player since i bought it a week ago.Buy, Listen, Let go.. be happy.  And go see APC when they tour, as i can tell you they produce one of THE BEST live shows i have seen.
B00005JKHN|4.0|Highly recommended to those who want to see background art at its zenith.  Taking one aspect at a time: 1) COLOR: Incredible!  The same dark intensity I remember from the 70mm prints.  One reviewer said the DVD color blew away the original theatrical print he saw when the film was first released.  He may have seen a 35mm print back then, because the original 70mm print I saw in 1959 was about equivalent to this DVD, but, in the theatre, the image on the retinas if all viewers in the 20 or so rows nearest the screen was much bigger -- bigger than is currently possible, while maintaining sharpness, with any home equipment.  70mm in those days was projected on a very large screen with at least some curve, and was meant to simulate the arc of vision.  In Sleeping Beauty, the effect seemed like being immersed in a dream-like, ornate, medieval world. That the color in the DVD is equivalent to the 70mm, the first DVD I can say that about, means that the restorers and transferors are to be heartily congratulated!   The marvelous color styling of Eyvend Earl comes through in all of its carefully thought out detail. There is a marvelous, rich, often dark look. There is a wider range of colors, and more variegated backgrounds, both drawn and suggested, than usual, by far. The story I heard a few years after the film was released, during a visit to the Disney studio (as a college newspaper writer) was that Disney had asked Earl (and the other background artists) for &quot;A moving Illustration; a medieval tapestry come to life.&quot; &quot;But Walt, medieval tapestries had muted colors!&quot; &quot;But Eyvend, ours won't!&quot;  Disney, Earl, and the others later decided to go for dark, rich images, and to imitate the fancier and more colorful style of the rubrics.   While it would not be appropriate for many other films, this color is the best of the best. <br />2) SOUND. They toned down the dynamics, and shaved off the deep bass!  Try turning the Bass control way up, and crank up the subwoofer, if it has a separate control.  If you have seen the film before, ask other viewers to step out of the room for a moment, and go to one of the scenes with thunder, or the climax, and make sure there is enough bass -- then go to another spot and check to see if the quiet and delicate treble music is still clear.  The escape from the castle and the events immediately following should be overwhelming, and Tchaikovsky's mad, wild, frenzied string music -- particularly the &quot;Dance Vertigo&quot; part of the Sleeping Beauty Ballet that they used for the thorns catching on fire, and just about the whole climactic sequence (as the prince tries to get to Aroura's castle), should really rage, and shake the floor. It did in the theater in 70mm and 6 channel stereo, and it did at my house, when I got through with it. Manufacturers often slice bass and dynamics in DVDs of films that had spectacular sound, to avoid blowing out the feeble speakers people have in their TV sets. They should either offer special &quot;full dynamics&quot; DVDs for those who are equipped, or just risk it. <br />3) THE FILM AS A WHOLE : Using Goethe's Three Principles: a) &quot;What was the artist trying to do?&quot; Probably trying to make a more elaborate and beautiful than usual Disney fairy tale film. b) &quot;How well has the artist done that?&quot; Very well indeed, in most ways. Much of the archetypal depth of such tales is intact. There is the nurturing mother (aunt type, in the three good fairies) the incompetent parent (King/Queen/ and the good fairies when befuddled), and the feared/bad mother (you-know-who).  Jung would have liked the demonstration of what happens when you try to exclude the bad/feared parent from your consciousness. The Uninvited.  More scuttlebutt from the time the film was released: at first, Disney was going to have all the good fairies the same, and mysterious, (this was partly confirmed in the supplementary material on disk 2). This was rumored tobe in response to critics who didn't like him giving the Dwarfs in Snow White, and later the Mice in Cinderella, very individual personalities.  Based on his many humorous, public comments, if this happened to be true, he might not have admitted paying attention to the critics.  When the animators complained that making the fairies the same was &quot;no fun,&quot; he decided to go the other way, and make them very individual, and since one of them was to be named Flora anyway, he decided to make her gently bossy, like his own mother, a school teacher, who was named Flora.  So Flora in SB is Disney's mother, and Mr. Banks in Mary Poppins is his father (with a little of Walt thrown in by Bill Walsh and Don Da Grady).  I would have used a larger orchestra, and not lightened Tchaikovsky's music quite so much (but in the fiery climax the music used is untouched, except for adding a repeat!. They did a marvelous thing by turning the &quot;Blue Bird&quot; into a vocalise for Aurora walking into the forest! c) &quot;Was it worth doing? &quot; Yes. And you will see several younger animators/artists in supplementary materials saying how much it influenced them. Favorite characters: Merriwether and Maleficent, the quintessence of projected evil.<br />4) SUITABILITY FOR CHILDREN --- not too young, can be scary.<BR>For more information about 70mm, try the excellent widescreenmuseum.com  &amp;  in70mm.com
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|This cd far surpassed my expectations of A Perfect Circle's sophomore album.  Mer de noms is one of my favorite records of all time, and it's hard to follow something that good at all, much less make it as good or interesting. The album feels much more organic and loose than mer de noms, and isn't quite as &quot;catchy&quot; or &quot;rockin'&quot; but it is very flowing and beautiful.
6305736650|5.0|The turn of the century produced a lot of lists including &quot;Best Movies&quot;.  I noted that &quot;Casablanca&quot; ranked right up there with the best American movies of all-time.  Many would argue that it is the BEST movie of all time.  I certainly have in in my top-ten because it is one of those classics where everything came together just right.  The acting is superb and there is a great chemistry between the main characters.  The story-line was exciting, believable, and emotional.  The audience is drawn into the emotion and no one but the hardest boiled eggs among us gets away without a heart-warming or heart-breaking reaction.  The directing is great, the music is memorable, the supporting actors terrific...what else am I missing?  It has it all.  <br />For some the message may be diluted somewhat by time but most of us know from hindsight that this movie takes places in a time of upheaval.  Lives are at stake.  The casino setting is an excellent metaphor for the twists of fate that have affected so many in this corner of the world.  Into this crossroads of humanity come two former lovers who meet unexpectedly.  Their lives have changed since they parted but their love was strong.  What will happen now that they meet again?  This mixture of romance and adventure makes &quot;Casablanca&quot; a movie for everyone.<br />The greatness of &quot;Casablanca&quot; might be best appreciated by speculating on what if the movie HAD been made with Ronald Reagan instead of Humphrey Bogart.  That was supposedly the person the studio initially had in mind for the role of Rick.  Opinions vary on Reagan as President but as an actor he was strictly &quot;B movie&quot; quality.  Make that change or any other of a number of possible changes in the acting, the script, the directing etc. and you would end up with a lesser movie.  That is why &quot;Casablanca&quot; is so loved even after all these years.  It works so well because everything came together just right.  If you havenot seen this movie, you must do so.  I recommend that you watch it with your spouse or significant other.  You'll probably always remember the night that you did.
068484267X|5.0|Just finished rereading Angela's Ashes for the fourth time and it is as entrancing as ever.  One of the best books around and an absolute miracle of writing.  On this one book alone, Frank McCourt should get the Nobel.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Mere words cannot describe the beauty contained within &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;.  I have been a fan of APC since I saw them open for NIN, and I was eagerly awaiting this albums arrival.  Well I was not disappointed.  Maynards dreamy voice combinded with the melodies contained within, are so intense, you can find yourself being carried off with the music.  Jeordie White is an incredible musician, and I think that this album shows off just what he can do.  My favorite selections would have to be &quot;The Package&quot;, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, and &quot;Pet&quot;.  All of which have a darker heavier beat then what I was expecting, but they turn out to be the best songs!
6305922756|5.0|You heard me. The DVD menu is funny. As soon as you pop this disc in and get to the menu, you hear David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest), and Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), comment about the options on the menu, and how black the screen is before the menu shows up. I think it's more of a pastel black myself.<br />This infamous mockumentary details the life of the band, &quot;Spinal Tap&quot;, and its members as they tour the USA. Many things happen to them that are very true to real rock bands, such as getting lost backstage, getting the wrong sized props for an onstage show, and having props not work right. And of course, hilarity ensues.<br />This mockumentary also reveals some of the history of Spinal Tap, such as the fact that every drummer who has ever been in the band has died under mysterious circumstances, such as Eric &quot;Stumpy Joe&quot; Childs, who choked on vomit(but we don't know whose).<br />In addition to this, we also see some of their early songs, complete with video. &quot;The Flower People&quot; is a song they did in the 60s, it looks like a cross between The Beatles and John Denver, and I could not stop laughing through the video.<br />What surprises me most about this movie, though, is that the music is actually good! And further more, it's actually played by Spinal Tap! <br />This edition of the DVD also includes over an hour of deleted scenes, four music videos (actual music videos, not just the scenes from the movie), commercials, and a few other extras that fit in great with a mockumentary. <br />Whether it is because the band members try to explain things the right way, or because of the paralells between real rock bands, or because the band members are talking about the spanish subtitles option in the subtitles menu, you will be laughing almost nonstop! It is rare that you will find a movie that will always be funny, and this is one of those rarities!
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|With the departure of Paz Lenchantin from the group, the rythm and flow from the music has been somewhat lacking.  Mer De Noms has been one of my all time favorite albums, and by that I was expecting a beautiful flowing group of songs to include tracks ranging from the slow &quot;Three Libras&quot; to songs like &quot;Judith,&quot; and &quot;The Hollow.&quot;  Yet I find myself thinking they are sub par and there is something lacking, maybe due to the fact Paz Lenchantin's Departure from the group for unknown reasons, or just the dramatic feel has just left the group, nevertheless it was an album that I would put in my cd player from time to time, yet I would not recommend it to a fan of the Band's first album.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I bought this CD last week and find it brilliant have hardly stopped listening to it since I bought it Marvelous Well Done Perfect Circle!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This actually has to be the best album I have bought, equal only to mer de noms. The new arrangment of musicians makes no difference you still get the same incrediable outcome. Gravity, Blue, and Weak and Powerless are all outstanding. The nurse who loved me is unique, moving and beautiful, I highly recommend this album to anyone who is looking for simply beautiful music.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|if u wanna hear music that means something if you enjoy being touched deeply or entertained at all moments or soothed of life get this cd its beautiful its so beautiful
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|A must have for the evolved, thinking music lover!
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Unfortunately, I was kind of disappointed with the CD as a whole. When I dropped it in the CD player, I expected it to blare out in a drum intro and warp me in a 6/8 lullaby type melody... And what I got was a Tool song. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Tool; but that's not what APC is supposed to be. There are some great APC-style tracks on this CD (The Noose, A Stranger, Weak and Powerless), then there are a few too-Tool tracks (The Package, The Outsider, Gravity), and some tracks that seem to combine the two (Pet). And there also are some really weird tracks, like The Nurse Who Loved Me and Lullaby (which does its job quite well). But, all-in-all, it just simply doesn't have the flow and magic that the first album had; too many veterans in the band with their own style for them to go experimental.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I LOVED THIS ALBUM!!! A Perfect Circle is an awsome band, check this new cd out- its definately worth it
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|IF YOU WERE EXPECTING THE SAME OLD  THING FROM APC YOUR IN FOR A SURPRISE.ONCE AGAIN THEY HAVE CHANGED THE WAY THAT ROCK SHOULD SOUND.MAYNARD JAMES KEENAN'S VOCALS ARE AS RIVETING AND EERIE AS EVER.BILLY HOWERDELL IS NO DOUBT A GENIUS IN HIS OWN RIGHT,PUT THIS COMBINATION TOGETHER WITH AN ALLSTAR LINEUP WHICH ALSO FEATURES FORMER SMASHING PUMPKINS GUITARIST JAMES IHA FORMER MARILYN MANSON BASSIST JEORDIE(TWIGGY RAMIREZ)WHITE AND VANDALS DRUMMER JOSH FREESE. IT DOESNT GET ANY BETTER.TRACKS LIKE THE NURSE WHO LOVED ME,AND THE NOOSE ARE JUST TWO OF THE MORE ECLECTIC SONGS.WHILE THE OUTSIDER AND THE PACKAGE SHOW YOU THEYCAN ROCK AS HARD AS THE REST.THIRTEENTH STEP IS THE MOST ORIGINAL ALBUM IVE HEARD IN A LONG TIME. I HIGHLY RECCOMEND THAT YOU BUY IT I PROMISE ONCE YOU LISTEN YOU WILL BE TOTALY HOOKED. IF YOU LIKE THIS THEN TAKE A LISTEN TO TOOL ALSO!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is absoutly outstanding. I ducktape my cd tray to never open, since I will be listening to this every night before I go to sleep! The first track to the last is breathtaking and almost like &quot;tool - Aenima&quot;, but better and a little more 'upbeat'. If you download music a lot, this is the album you should rather buy at a store, cause it will make you forget ho much you paid for it, since it cost $9.25 at target.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The Thirteenth Step is awesome!  I've heard many of the songs performed live and it was absolutely amazing.  \\"Weak and Powerless\\" is just a sample of the creative genious known as A Perfect Circle.  Don't limit yourself, or the band, by just hearing this single...BUY THE ALBUM!  You won't be sorry.  It will keep you hooked track after track.  This is an album to remember...
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Hypnotic, powerful, a true work of art. What else can I say about something that has moved me so much. each song speaks in whispers and shouts that somehow wash over you like sunlight and hit you like a brick wall. I've been a Tool fan for about as long as anybody else and I never thought I'd hear another band that I'd call my favorite. This is one of the best c.d.'s to come out in a very long time. The Package, Pet, and The Outsider have to be the standout tracks for me.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|...you won't be disappointed with the maturation of the second! It is a beautiful album and should be in everyone's stereos ASAP!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|It may be more of a mellow album, but it is much more textured and darker than the last (at least in content). &quot;The Noose&quot; is one of the best songs I've heard in a while.
B00006ZCFH|3.0|I think the cd is okay.  I give Erica credit for making something fresh and new.  To me it's just not lyrically want I expect from her.  Of course, it's catches you with the first couple of songs.  The last two tracks are not that good.  Erica, is sooo talented...I just think this was something for her to do. Not a lot of effort and thought was put into this project.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|As the opening guitar riff slides in on the opening track The Package, we see that A Perfect Circle has taken a little different turn. Billy Howerdel, Maynard James Keenan and the rest of the band really show it to the listener that this is not just a Maynard side project, but Billy's child and how they have nursed it to be a music monster amongst some of the other bands of the day. This monster shows its teeth in certain tracks on the album such as the outsider, pet and the somewhat haunting side in Blue where an arpegiation grows into a vibrant piece brighter than the pure blue sky. APC show how calm they can be as they perform the Failure cover The Nurse Who Loved Me half way through the album. you're almost intranced and in awe of how delicate they can be and how maynards voice can be as delicate as it is howling. A brilliant follow up album which would be better than the first if the first wasn't spectacular in its own sort of way.
B00006LI26|5.0|This album is very different than anything Helloween has put out ever since. But this, in my opinion is their gem. This is straight up Speed metal, and its damn right amazing. The guitars are so melodic, the bass makes my skin crawl, and the pounding drums just make the whole sound elevate to a next level. On Walls of Jericho, you get to hear Kai Hansen singing his brains out and he does an amazing job at it. &quot;Ride the Sky&quot; is one of the most amazing songs I have ever heard, the guitars are really melodic. &quot;reptile&quot; has always been one of my favorites, on the chorus part, you can hear the bass follow Kai's voice, that makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up! &quot;Heavy Metal is the law&quot; has got to be the coolest Heavy Metal anthem ever, this song would make even Man O War bow down to them. In short, you have to get this album to understand why so many years after its release, it is still regarded as one of the best speed metal albums ever.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly was one of the best shows on TV.<br />I think what I liked best about the show is that it took pieces of the world and smashed them together in a new way, but without feeling like it needed to be too specific about the events in the intervening time, so it retained the sort of mythic feel that Whedon does so well.  E.g., as mentioned elsewhere, people speak Mandarin as a matter of course.  We aren't told why, because we don't need to know - it adds flavor, and it suggests plotlines in which we might find out more because THEN we'd need to know.<br />Whedon is also great at starting with what you think is a  stereotype and then turning it on its ear ... and creating his own stereotypes and turning them inside out.  A great example can be seen at the end of the first-aired episode, The Train (and in fact, this instance of SF TV stereotype burning completely sold me on the show).  <br />Bring on the movie!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|APC has done it again with a great follow up album.  Since I bought the CD the day it came out I havent been able to stop listening to it.  I recomend the cd to all,  And visit their website<br />aperfectcircle.com

After the move finished I played back that scene about 15 times and I cried the entire time.  The next day before I returned the movie I watched that scene again and again was crying. <br />Definitely check out this movie it is good.

B00008EY9G|4.0|I have a few rules when it comes to movies and sometimes they don't always hold true, but there is one that's a lead pipe cinch: &quot;Anything with John Cusack in it has got to be a pretty good movie.&quot;  Whether it's quirky comedies like High Fidelity or intense dramas like his recent movie Max, John Cusack is right up there with Kevin Spacey, Tom Hanks, and Morgan Freeman when it comes to the great actors working today.  &quot;Identity&quot; is not an exception to this rule.<br />&quot;Identity's&quot; basic plot can be summed up as a re-hash of Agatha Christie's Ten Little Indians.  A group of people get stranded at a motel in the middle of nowhere and they all begin to get murdered one by one.  It's hard to write a really in-depth review of this movie though because the more I talk about the plot, the more of the twists and turns will be given away.  Someone else has already mentioned the trailers for the movie building up intrigue about the characters at the motel, so when the movie starts off with something that isn't even mentioned in the trailers, you may be thrown for a loop.  Does it all tie in at the end or is it just independent and work as a &quot;B&quot; plot to the movie?  By answering that question, I'll give away a lot of what the movies relies on to drive the final act.  <br />Let me say that this is one of those movies that if you sit and try to figure it out, you might go into a coma because your brain may just shut down from working overtime.  What makes this movie really cool is that there's not just one twist, there's several.  The director shows you just enough to get you thinking one way only to throw something totally different out there a few scenes later.  The only real drawback to the movie is that the &quot;shocking twist&quot; at the end seems a bit far fetched, but it does make sense, although I think there's probably a way to make it a little more realistic instead of just kind of coming from left field.  Oh, and if you want to check out the alternate ending, don't blink or look too hard or else you're gonna miss it because that alternate ending is pretty much the original ending with just a couple or three new shots thrown in the mix.

B00005JLKN|4.0|Thomas Harris' is a great writer.  The Silence of the Lambs still stands as one of the four or five best books I've ever read, Red Dragon is a great book as well, but Hannibal leaves a lot to be desired.  But, anyways, we're talking movies here not books.<br />Most of you know that Red Dragon is an adaptation of the Thomas Harris book of the same name that was made into a movie before called Manhunter.  The plot of both movies and the novel is that there's a killer on the loose nicknamed The Tooth Fairy.  The Tooth Fairy kills entire families and arranges the bodies in a ritualistic fashion.  The FBI can't find a pattern or a motive, so they bring in Will Graham who's one of their top profilers, but who has retired after a bloody takedown of Hannibal Lecter.  Graham is pulled into the hunt for The Tooth Fairy and somehow the paths of Graham, The Tooth Fairy, and Lecter all converge.  <br />Manhunter is a great movie, although it is really dated when you watch it now and see William Peterson sporting a quasi-Miami Vice look.  Red Dragon is a great movie as well, but it doesn't move and flow as well as Manhunter.  Ed Norton plays Will Graham the way I would envision him from reading the book.  Graham is haunted by the demons from his work, but he almost seems to take a sadistic satisfaction in the fact that he's able to get into the minds of some extreme psychopaths.  I think Norton does a really good job of showing the fine line Graham walks between wanting to live a happy, quiet life with his family and being pulled at by a job he at the same time hates and loves.<br />Ralph Fiennes seems to just go a bit overboard with the whole Tooth Fairy thing, but maybe he was trying to unleash some inner demons after he stared with J-Lo in &quot;Maid in Manhattan.&quot;  I've always thought ol' Ralph was a good actor, but in this movie it's almost as if he's trying to figure out whether he should play this role seriously or just off the wall dog mess crazy.  The book and Manhunter focus more intently on The Tooth Fairy character, but Red Dragon opts to throw more focus on the whole Lecter aspect, which is to be understood considering they've made a couple hundred million dollars off Anthony Hopkins.<br />Which that gets us to Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.  Hopkins is a great actor, but you can tell he's a bit bored with the character.  I'm not saying he does a bad job in this movie, but he lacks the sadistic glee he had in The Silence of the Lambs.  I still think the guy from Super Troopers did a kick ass job as Hannibal in Manhunter, but Anthony Hopkins won a freakin' Oscar for this part and he plays a cannabilistic killer better than anyone else out there.<br />Red Dragon is a good movie.  It's way better than Hannibal, but not nearly as good as Silence of the Lambs.  It's definitely worth checking out though if you're a fan of either or both of those movies.  The movie moves pretty well, although there are a couple of scenes that do slow the action down a bit.  As a whole, this is a four star movie despite some less than stellar acting from the bad guys.
B000002GYI|5.0|To be in High School and to hear 'Numbers' blasting from a IROK parked in front the parking lot is an experience that can only be rivaled with 'the first time', bungee jumping, getting away with something really big, or winning money.  It was both completly unorthodox and firmly planted in urban music traditions (hard hitting beats, hooks~both vocal and musical).  This is also a 'no track advance' album.  You can put it on and from Numbers to Pocket Calculator to Computer Love and Computer World, your riveted.  I think at this point they knew they had black/urban Amerikkka on LOCK!!!!!!  I think I remember reading in an interview that they were sooooo honoured to be embraced by the hip hop/urban music community.  Imagine the program director at a power urban music station in the eighties not being able to ingnore the clamour from the listeners wanting to hear that 'bugged out computer jam' from those 'German cats'.  When I'm digggin down trying to grasp at something that is completly on some 'next shhh', I use Kraftwerk (and Numbers, in particular) to channel that vanguard spirit.  God Bless you Kraftwerk.  I gotta get the autobiography &quot;I was a Robot&quot;!!!!!!
B000063DI9|5.0|Upon first hearing the title, it can be slightly confusing attempting the math (at least for a seventh grader, which I was when I firtst bought this album). Iron Maiden stepped a little to the left with this album and weaved 8 songs around the concept of the 7th son of a 7th son being the &quot;chosen one&quot; and the forces of good and evil attempting to lure him to one side or the other to weild his power for their own. The story ties everything together in a storybook fashion and for a first try, it comes off exceedingly well and close to as perfect as Pink Floyd's &quot;The Wall&quot;.<br />Songwriting-wise, these songs definitely stepped it up a notch from Maiden's previous outings. The textures were very fine-tuned and more broad than prior to this album. The music is so well written that it nearly tells the story on its own but like any good concept album, it serves to move the words from beginning to climax to questionable end. Every track is a keeper once your listen to the album as a whole. Hearing anything as a single would be a mistake because any one song detracts from the album genius as a literary piece.<br />This album has all of the makings of a well done feature film, providing that someone who knew the band and their music was willing to step up to the plate and make it happen. But, even as a stand alone recording, it is Iron Maiden's most impressive ever made.
B000007R1M|5.0|I'm going to keep it short and sweet.  The blackest whitemen alive.  I haven't seen too many urban music heads review this, except for the B-Boy but I think that the influence Kraftwerk had on urban music can never be overemphasized.  Drum Machines, metal and flesh, automatons, all of this was very P-Funk-esque for urban kids.  We were already accustomed to artist creating their own 'worlds' within the music for the listener to dive into.  Krafwerk did this with the quadruple blow of TTE, Man Machine, Computer World and Tour De France.  There is no smarter music than this stuff.  Go out and buy the quad shot you'll see the magic
B00004TH7Z|5.0|The world was almost ready to stop rotating when the word of Bruce Dickinson's return to Iron Maiden was circulating. I remember my friend showing up at work with &quot;Brave New World&quot; and playing it for me and me being astonished at what I was hearing. I thought &quot;This is the best thing I've heard since Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son&quot;. Despite not having a job in the summer of 2000, I made a point to see Iron Maiden on that summer's tour and purchased &quot;Brave New World&quot; 3 times; once on gatefold picture disc vinyl, once on CD and once on cassette.<br />Without a doubt, this was the best Iron Maiden album I had heard in years. It marked the return of the singer that made them a metal household name, it was a significant release in the metal world and from a musical standpoint, it was full of life. It beared all of the best elements that Iron Maiden had possessed from day one. Beautifully written melodies with punchy tracks of epic proportions described the whole of BNW in a short breath. It was, essentially, the album that so-called Maiden purists had been waiting 10 years for and now, it was here. Iron Maiden had seemingly shouted &quot;WE'RE BACK&quot;.<br />On paper, that sounds very accurate. &quot;Brave New World&quot; is a monster of an album and is most definitely their best since 7th Son. Everything came together and it seemed that the stars were aligned perfectly as the whole process went down. So, where does my somewhat discerning tone come from? Everyone was quick to call this a &quot;comeback album&quot;. But, where did they ever go? Nowhere. Granted, I love the idea of The Human Air Raid Sign fronting my favorite band but that only discounts the other five, equally important members of this monumental outfit. The 90s saw Maiden suffer some serious blows but through it all, they managed to create top notch albums that have merely gone unnoticed. Put aside the fact that Bruce is absent and you still have Iron Maiden, noting that Bruce isn't even the original singer.<br />I suppose I got off track there some. I think that this has more to do with my being hesitant to call this a &quot;comeback album&quot; than anything else. I'd call &quot;Brave New World&quot; more of a &quot;modern classic&quot; as it is Iron Maiden stealing the thunder from most everyone else once again. &quot;Brave New World&quot; bleeds power and stature in an age where simplicity and unoriginality reigns supreme. It has set a new benchmark for metal in the new millenium and for that, I am grateful that this album has surfaced at all. Another gem from an exceptional band.e isn't even the original singer.<br />I suppose I got off track there some.

B0000AZJXQ|5.0|the album is just great....a really different album from what everybody expected....it's really calm..really relaxing....<br />it has a lot of envolving sounds..and soft guitars...some wired drums...and really worked rithms...<br />maynards singing is stunning...<br />some oriental sounds i guess in there too,..<br />but i really wanna complain.. on the anti-copy system we are getting at least here in europe!! it gives problems when listening the cd no some discmans or car cd players....<BR>sometimes the tracks just stops and then goes again....or some saturaion problems also... it's a shame that the end product is not perfect!<br />stupid record labels....
B000063V8R|1.0|If you need to get a Star Trek buy Deep Space NINE or wait for Voyager. Your best bet is to get the Farscape sets or Babylon 5. I have to admit Wesley Crusher is a great character!!! LOL
B00006LLNU|2.0|Tweedle dee, tweedle dum...there's nothing but blank space between those two parentheses.  I found the whole thing to be pretty unmemorable, and although it's good to see the hype machine settling down on a band that's willing to push the musical envelope, the music on ( ) seems to drift in one ear and out the other, like a parody of their previous album.  There's no 'there' there, just a dull, endless ocean full of toothless fish.  After a start-to-finish headphone session I had to jump start my consciousness with some Mogwai and Bardo Pond just to be sure my synapses were firing correctly.  They were, and this disc was filed in the 'sweet nothings' slushpile, to be resurrected when I enter the old folks' home.
B00006M183|5.0|Riot Act is by far the best, most meanigful cd I've listened to in a long time.  Every song has a strong message and is a statement for the times that we are living in.  Going to see Pearl Jam this summer only added to the effects that this album has on me.  The talent of this group goes beyond musicians.  They are thinkers for our times and express what the average person cannot.  Pearl Jam stands for a better world and this album shows their maturity and dedication for spreading a message to mankind. We better wake up soon. <BR>Awesome, wonderful album.  I get something more out of the lyrics every time I listen.
6305327041|5.0|Look this movie is a great, fun little film PERIOD. Tim Roth steals the show from a huge cast,strutting all the way. Just know that this film is 4 different stories with nothing in common but poor Ted the Bellboy. Roth is hilarious as he tries to get through New Year's eve without getting shot, stabbed, or thrown out a window.(oh yeah he did get stabbed didn't he?) Antonio, David Proval, Tarantino, and an uncredited and stoned Bruce Willis take the unusual walk to the funny side and thrive.(especially antonio) Trust me rent this film and you will wish you would have bought it. The best in short attention span film and a MUST HAVE for Tarantino/Rodriquez followers.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|i just got the cd on tuesday and havent taken it out of my sterio yet. from the moment the first song startes until the final note at the end of the last you know you got far more than you payed for. maynards voice accompanied by the rest of the bands music is almost angelic and breath taking is the only way i can think to describe it. it is a perfect blend of mild melodic spiritual songs and the more driving sound you are used to hearing from tool or of a perfect circle's first album. i have nothing bad to say about this album except i wish it was longer.
B000053VAZ|5.0|Out of all of Depp's powerful performances this is as good as it gets. This film and Edward Scissorhands proves that so much of acting can be potrayed in the demeanor and face as well as the lines. Depp plays Sam so well after you watch the film you can see no one but Depp playing him. I heard that his whole audition consisted of the park/hat scene and he won them over as well as me. Depp fan or no, this movie should be in everyone's collection.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This band has proven they really are a perfect circle of sound. Such an awesome blend of heavy guitar, and many soft melodic songs even with a few ballads. Great playing, talent, devotion, sweat, and blood put into each song on the album by each musician who worked on it. Wow. If you liked Mer De Noms, youll love this one.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I have been an avid Perfect Circle Fan for quite some time now, when I heard that they had a new album out I was way psyched. I just saw tham live at Lollapalooza and they were the best. If you never have listened to A Perfect Circle before, you have been missing out on one of the bands ever, buy this album and Mer De Noms and you will not be disappointed. I promise you that.
B0000AZJXQ|3.0|What happened to the band with so much promise?. After listening to this CD about 10 times now, I have to say that I am indeed disappointed with this effort. It sounds to much like TOOL in spots. Quiet and plodding is the best way to describe it. The last CD was grooving big time, while this one never really gets started. Sure the lyrics are interesting and it has it's spots of greatness, but unfortunately those spots are to far apart for a cohesive effort. If it had more heavy spots tossed in here and there, I would have given it a 4 or even a 5, but it doesn't and that in a nut shell is the problem with this effort. A dud for sure
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I was absolutely in a nearly catatonic state of mind while listening to this cd.  I am not surprised though.  Maynard was given the gift of having the voice of an angel and Billy Howerdel and Josh Freese are so extremely talented!  They surpass any expectations that I had about this new album...By far!  My advice for people...Buy this!  But it now!  No drink, no drug, no sexual experience could ever leave you feeling more alive than listening to this!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The new APC album left me feeling Weak and Powerless. The moment I pushed play I felt that feeling I only get when Maynard does his thing. The Whole album has a softer, sorta, indie feel to it. If I had to pick my favorte song(s) they would have to be &quot;the noose&quot; and &quot;gravity&quot;. But every single song makes me want to fall to my knees and wonder how one gets to be so talented?<BR>This album rocks!
B00005JKES|4.0|Where the heck is the pilot episode????  Why does David Lynch insist on being difficult when it comes to packaging his work?  The pilot isn't even available stateside, I had to track down an import, with horrible sound quality.  <br />Plus, why release season 1 if you have no intention of releasing season 2?  I know some viewers believe season 2 to be largely inferior, but at least release the full cultural document!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Once again, Billy Howerdell, Maynard James Keenan, and Josh Freese have crafted a truly beautiful piece of art. These songs show an even deeper side to the band. Billy's use of textured guitar tracks and Maynards abstract, deep lyrics literally take you to another place. I have spent hours with headphones on getting lost inside of this album. My personal favorites as of right now are &quot;The Package&quot; and &quot;Pet&quot;. I promise you will not be dissapointed with this album. If you are not already a die hard fan, you soon will be! Be smart and buy the album to support the band! Don't burn it or swipe it from Kazaa. If we don't support these bands and buy there CD's they will not be able to afford make a living entertaining us! Where would we be without the music we love and live for? Hats off to APC.
B000001DV2|2.0|First, Peace Steve you where the best and your music lives on with your fans who still miss you. Second, with the release of Adrenalize. I lost all respect for Def Leppard and never followed the band after Steve Maynard Clark died. Steve was a amazing guitarist, songwriter and the heart and soul of Def Leppard in my eyes. Very few fans other than those that followed them pre-Adrenalize will know this. Adrenalize could have been released with Steve Clark playing on every song, and some songs in demo form. Which they should have done, dedicated to him and would have been a fitting way to remember Steve Maynard Clark with their fans also. I'm one fan who would not have complained and probably would have continued on enjoying them in the Vivian Campbell era of the Leppard. Had they done that. But they fired Mutt Lange and recut the album with a new producer way over-produced. The end result, the only song Steve plays on is the last guitar riff on &quot;Tear It Down&quot;. Sorry but that is no way to treat a lost bandmate, your fans who loved &quot;Steamin&quot;, too worried about quality versus realizing they would never be the same band again. Adrenalize could have been a fitting ending to the Steve Clark era of the Leppard. I purchased the album, was disappointed by it and got rid of it when. I heard that the band, could have released it with Steve playing on every song. I still listen to &quot;On Through The Night&quot;, &quot;High'N'Dry&quot;, Pyromania&quot;, &amp; &quot;Hysteria&quot; and watch their &quot;Live In The Round In Your Face&quot; video. I recommend them and if you never listened to them. The Video give you the chance to see &quot;Steamin&quot; live. Get your hands on them your going to love it and you'll see why Steve was so special.  But stay away from this Adrenalize or as I call it Un-adrenalized, unless you like Sappy Pop-metal. Before you give me a bad review just remember. The Leppard lost a key member of their band and let their egos get in the way. I just feel the band could have done a much better tribute to &quot;Steamin&quot; and it still bothers me all these years later that they never really did. Even if they think they did.way. I just feel the band could have done a much better tribute to &quot;Steamin&quot; and it still bothers me all these years later that they never really did. Even if they think they did.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|With the haunting opening drum beat of &quot;The Package&quot; that sounds like it's coming from an empty room down the hall of an empty house you know that you are about to take a sonic journey somewhere outside of the conventional rock band/radio template. This is a CD for fans of music, not just TOOL or A Perfect Circle. This CD sounds like it could be the score for a movie that hasn't been written yet. The lyrics are surrounded by music that is very disarming, but as you have a closer listen to the words you realize that there's more of a message and a theme than is obvious. &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; is another familiar sound that is unique to this band. Not to say that this album is taken from the same formula as the previous one though. Track three is called &quot;The Noose&quot;, a surprisingly gentle song that could have easily been written for TOOL with different music. With lyrics like, &quot;I'd like to pull your halo down, around your neck and tug you to the ground&quot;, one can see the image in their mind. Track 4, &quot;Blue&quot;, is a stand out track and I wouldn't be surprised if it was a single. Track 5 is a song called &quot;Vanishing&quot;, it's one of the most haunting and cerebral songs that I've ever heard from any band. Maynard sounds like an entity not even a person in this one. Track 6, &quot;The Stranger&quot;, has the tone of Nine Inch Nails song &quot;Hurt&quot;. Track 7 is a song called, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, has the lyrical theme of Judith but the tones of a more patient warning. The next track &quot;Crimes&quot; is a short interlude or perhaps a tail end of &quot;The Outsider&quot;, tribal sounding drums. &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me&quot; is the next song. It is completely devoid of any percussion. It's actually a cover song that will take many fans by surprise. You NEED to here it to appreciate it. Track 10, my favorite off the album, is a song called &quot;Pet&quot;. Arguably the most aggressive song on the record, &quot;Pet&quot; has a driving rhythm and this is what many fans of TOOL would say sounds like it could be an lost track from their album &quot;Aenima&quot;. A song where Maynard is trying to protect someone or something from a cold brutual world outside. With lyrics like &quot;Lay your head down child I won't let the boogie man come&quot; and &quot;like sheep to the rhythm of the war drums&quot;. The next track &quot;Lullaby&quot; seems to be a continuation of &quot;Pet&quot; with Maynard whispering &quot;go back to sleep&quot; followed by a siren singing. It's a short song that fades out into the final track. The last track is called &quot;Gravity&quot;. It's a song that was written before Paz left the band as she gets a writing credit for it. If you're familiar with Mer de Noms, it's in the vain and pace of &quot;Orestes&quot;. All in all if there were any doubts about A Perfect Circle's talent or musicianship before there won't be after one listen to &quot;Thirteenth Step&quot;. One of the best all around albums to be released in quite some time. Maybe if more bands put out music like this record companies could justify high album prices, because then it would be worth it. Beg, borrow or steal the money.....do whatever you have to do to get it............then BUY THIS ALBUM!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is an excellent cd.  I saw them live at Lollapalooza and they blew everyone away with the new songs, especially &quot;Weak and Powerless&quot; and &quot;Pet.&quot;  This cds just as good as the last one, if not better.  Maynard's vocals just reach inside of you like no other vocalist can do.  Definitely a band that people should hear.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|I have been listening to this Thirteenth Step non-stop since I picked it up 4 days ago.Seems like the more you here it the better it sounds.Well thought out, and Maynards vocals are great,even the new bunch of band members it's still A PERFECT CIRCLE all the way!Great Album!    \,,/   \,,/
B0000AZJXQ|1.0|I don't know where to strat about this CD...<BR>Maybe a good strating point would be the first APC CD which easily ranks between the top 10 CDs of all time as far as anyone asks me.<BR>This CD is nothing like the first APC... Everything had changed from the songs to the guitar sound and I don't like it sir.<BR>I know that by this point you would say I expected a CD just like the first one and that's 100% true and that's because it was so good.<BR>This CD has most of the songs on it sounding the same and you can easily fall askeep listening to it, my girlfriend actually did!<BR>There are about two &quot;rocker&quot; songs that sound better but they are still very far from the standards of the first CD.<BR>I don't know why this CD is so bad compared to the last one and just sound like another Tool CD, maybe it's because MJK had no deal in music writing? Or is it because you make the first CD for years and the second one in 6 - 12 months?<BR>At any case, I was really really disappointed from the songs and from the sound. Billy knows how to use Protools very well and he knows how to make guitars sound AMAZING - so what's this nu-metal sounds on this CD?!?<BR>Maybe next time they will make something better? Do I want a next time???
B00001U0DP|1.0|Let's cut right to the chase: we can all agree that there are certain things that can be appropriately parodied: Presidents of the United States (when they are not addressing things like 9-11 and Pearl Harbor), religious subjects within reason (enter Foul Play), Star Wars movies (enter Spaceballs), Westerns (enter Blazing Saddles), and The Legends of King Arthur (enter Monty Python and the Holy Grail).<br />But there most certainly are other things that are so serious in nature that to make comic movies of them descends to the abysmal depths of bad taste.<br />I am sorry but I can find absolutely nothing funny about life in World War II concentration camps or the Holocaust.  Nothing! To attempt to make light of such subjects tarnishes the memory of those who suffered so greatly.<br />Accordingly, Life is Beautiful should be renamed Life is Pathetic or, perhaps, a better title would be &quot;Life is Beautiful, but this movie is STUPID, INANE, IRREVERANT and DISRESPECTFUL!&quot;<br />Douglas McAllister
B0000AZJXQ|1.0|I loved the first album, went to see APC live 5 times, and was anxiously awaiting the new album.  The album, both lyrically and musically is disappointing.  The production/mixing is bad, where's the powerful guitars we heard on the first album?  Where are the thought provocing, insightful lyrics of the first album?  The best song on the album is weak and powerless.  Unfortunately, the entire album is weak and powerless.
B0000B3FCX|5.0|If you've liked their previous stuff, you'll love this. If you don't know who they are, you should check them out. It's worth the money, no question.
B000002J0G|3.0|Momentum is what this album lacks above all else.  The songs are solid for the most part but the overall flow of the CD moves in jumps and starts.  However, when the music is good, it is very good, with Chuck Billy's vocals the most notable element.  But there are some tracks that seem oddly out of place on a metal album.  After hearing this album I wanted to put in \\"The Gathering,\\" a superior effort without a doubt.  The fans like this album, but I'm enamored with \\"The Gathering\\" and \\"Demonic,\\" which are more Death Metal than simply Heavy Metal.  It's just a matter of taste, I'm sure. Later.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|I am an old school Bowie fan. My very first LP was Diamond Dogs. DB's latest release, a collection of rock and roll pop songs is a fun ride. Reality is not nearly as dark as his previous album, Heathen. Many reviewers have compared this album to various stages of DB's past. How could one not notice these references!?! But they are only references. Reality is the product of a mature artist and businessman.<br /><br />Why 4 stars? This is not a genre defining milestone like Ziggy, Diamond Dogs, or Heroes. If you are looking for groundbreaking work, check out the older catalogue. This release is undeniably pop. But it's also a fun ride through Gotham with the top down.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|If you dont have this cd, there is something wrong with you. This is, by far, the most amazing thing that I, or you, have ever heard. Buy this cd, and if you dont like it, hurt yourself.
0140042520|4.0|DHARMA BUMS is Sal the next morning. The screaming mad party, heaven-reached and bottle-drained, rests in peace and the sun is here. Time to reassess. Time to repent. That is how this book reached me. Read on the heels of ON THE ROAD, BUMS is the next logical step in that journey. He still enjoys a party, still makes love to wine, but instead of ending in wild sweats, it approaches nirvana. He abstains from women, communes with the mountains, and is definitely on his way to shedding his skin of the world. His cohort this time around is not Dean, but right good Bhikku, Japhy. Together they hike the trails of Buddhahood.<br />I enjoyed this book, but felt disconnected from the main character, the way a designated driver feels removed from the drunken group. He is on a path, to which I cannot wholly relate. The inner monologue passages are not as user-friendly due to their Buddhist nature (or \\"Buddha Nature\\") as those in ROAD. However, it is still a very engaging read that ends, like ROAD, in a euphoric afterglow. Desolation Peak is the new Mexico. Fog replaces bums, and silence, the exhausted laughter of done mad men.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Pick this album up at all costs.  One of the Best albums of 2003.  Although it isn't as good as Aenema or Lateralus (both works of pure genius), this is a big step beyond mer de noms.  More atmospheric and melodic than Tool (but not as heavy).  The Outsider, gravity, noose, weak and powerless, pet, blue are especially good.  If 3 Libras was your favorite song on Mer de Noms, you will LOVE this album.  If your favorite song was more in the 'Judith' vein, you still have hard tracks like pet and the outsider to keep you happy.  5 stars.
B00005JLZN|4.0|The Life of David Gale was slammed by critics for being a sanctimonious preachfest. I prefer to view the movie as a mystery/thriller with the death penalty views as a background for its plot. Seen as thus, this is a mostly satisfying thriller, packed with just the right amount of twists and turns, red herrings, and intriguing characters to entertain for its two-hour running time.<br />Kate Winslet (look prettier than ever) star as Bitsey Bloom, a journalist who is on task to interview David Gale (Kevin Spacey) before he is to be executed in three days. He was a former professor sentenced for the rape and murder of Constance Harraway (Laura Linney), who along with Gale, were close friends and advocates against the death penalty. As Gale unfolds the tale of the last few months of his life before the murder, she slowly begins to believe he might actually be innocent and that the real killer could be very well out there, watching her every move.<br />As I said before, The Life of David Gale is a very entertaining thriller. Seen as just that, a thriller, it does have its flaws, some of it pertaining to Winslet. Her performance is actually quite good, it's that, as is the case with a lot of movies in this genre, the &quot;detectives&quot; are usually the least well-developed characters, simply because they're there to gather the facts and piece the clues together. The only things we know about her is that she's determined and very tenacious. <br />Both Spacey and Linney are excellent, convincing in their portrayals of normal individuals who suffer plenty of heartbreak in their lives, with the latter eventually losing hers in a brutal manner. Spacey, during the interview scenes, exudes an aura of mystery and quiet uneasiness, basically the same style of acting he's relied on almost his entire career. Still, he's good at it, but one wonders when he'll really break out into something completely different.<br />The film runs smoothly for most of its running time, and the movie's first big twist, revealed with about a half-hour left, caught me off-guard, in a good way. It's the final scene that irks me. That last shot should have been omitted from the film, as it negates the purpose of much of what went on the previous two hours and might even make you lose complete respect for one of its major characters. Director Alan Parker obviously meant for this shot to chill us, and while it will probably to that effect initially, you're going to feel cheated once the credits have rolled.
B00005MCX3|5.0|In the record store I stood and on a whim I figured I'd finally buy a Hawkwind album, since their legend had persevered through decades.  I asked the record store guy where to start, since the Hawkwind catalogue is intimidatingly immense.  Without hesitation, he whipped out this album and said this was the absolute best place to start.  And so for you who have yet to discover Hawkwind like I have recently, BOY ARE YOU IN FOR A SURPRISE.  This album is a fine balance of introspective mellotron drenched songs and caveman stomp.  These songs are beyond the heavier stuff of Space Ritual and Doremi Fasol Latido.  The opener, 'Psychedelic Warlords' comes across like a slick/apocolyptic BOC song, a desert hallucination if you will.  To continue the desert mood, is &quot;Wind of Change&quot;, my favorite song on the album.  When there are comparisons to King Crimson being made, this song is one of the reasons why; both cosmic and ethereal, it is one of the most gorgeous mellotron songs you will ever hear.  'Web Weaver' is a nice piece of accoustic, pseudo-Pink Floyd psychedelia.  Other more ballsier songs are the awesome guitar driven 'You'd Better Believe It', the phazed, metallic psychedelia of 3D-Rider, the short (comparably) but punchy 'Lost Johnny' (the rhythm part is definitely a template for many of the glam-metal bands to come a decade later), and finally the mind blowing 'Paradox' where you will hear this heavy, heavy distorted rhythm guitar duel it out with a mellotron!  There are two more mellotron-dominated songs:  the pastoral 'Goat Willow', which which features a sci-fi sounding synthesizer, a harpsichord, and a synthesized flute, and the title song, which has a nice piano duet with the mellotron (and that sci-fi sound again in the background) along with a string section.  The bonus tracks are mostly edited down versions of the album rockers.  &quot;It's So Easy&quot; has a heavy Mott the Hoople feel and is an appropriate closer for this remastered album.  Although notorious for heavy sci-fi themes (which I suspect is what queered their chances of mainstream acceptance), the science fiction takes a back seat to the musicianship.  This is an album by a band at the height of its powers of creativity.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Thirteenth Step is truly a work of art.  It seduced me the second I heard it, it is so intense and emotional.  I didn't think it was possible for it to be better than MDN but this cd is absolutely amazing and and shows how much they've improved musically and lyrically.  It's completely and utterly beautiful and kicks serious ass too, it's a brilliant cd, I recommend this cd to anyone and everyone!!!
B00006ZCFH|5.0|Erykah Badu drops a relatively unexpected album Worldwide Underground in the midst of major rap releases like Outkast and DMX, and in the shadow of major releases such as Mary J. Blige and Ashanti's albums.  The question is could she floor all these releases with an amazing cd?  Hell yes!!!!!  I don't have a clue what some of these people on here are listening to but this album is much better than Mama's Gun.  This album has the GROOVE, it has the FUNK.  The vibe of the album is just amazing.  Freeflowing groove that never slips.  Just checc out `Bump It' with its `Push Up the Fader, bust the meter, shake the tweeter bump it well well well'.  Badu's effortless voice is perfect over these tracks.  The producers FreakQuency have simply got it goin on. I Want You is ten minutes plus of complete brilliance.  Woo is more brilliance.  In fact every song is nothing short of genius with subtle nuances that keep you coming back for more.  Danger is just basically GENIUS...once you hear the beat that's it!  This album should win something, anything...Grammy material...this is the best soul album in YEARS.  Erykah Badu switched it up and changed the game again.  Think Twice, Love Of My Life 2, Back In The Day all classics.  This album is a masterpiece...I can't get it out the changer.  Everywhere I go...I want to hear that Badu...I can't even sleep!!  Wake up in the morning it's playing, in the car it's playing, get home it's blasting. I think I might have to buy some more copies of this album...one I ain't even gonna open...yes it's that good. This album puts a constant smile on your face and it gets better with each spin.  Badu has a winner on her hands...a masterpiece.  10 stars!!!
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Ever since A Perfect Circle's first CD, Mer De Noms, came out I loved it.  I had listened to it over and over and over, waiting forever for a follow up CD.  I had been waiting and was eager to listen to their second, Thirteenth Step.  I got it right away and was not disappointed.  Anyone who is a fan of A Perfect Circle or Tool will most likely like this one too.  The songs have variety that make each one of them stand out from the next.  Some songs in particular like &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Lullaby&quot; have been stuck in my head continously for the last few days!  This is a CD that any APC fan must get!
B000066C6Z|5.0|it was and still is popular in romania
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The second album from A Perfect Circle begins right where Mer de Noms left off. Although not as musically heavy as the first album, this album is heavy with mood. It's obvious on tracks such as &quot;Blue&quot; and &quot;Vanishing&quot; how strong The Cure influenced Billy Howerdel, creator/composer/lead guitarist of the band. The album flows beautifully from track to track, with a great take on &quot;The Nurse Who Loved Me,&quot; a song by former member Troy van Leeuwen's old band, Failure. After &quot;Nurse&quot; comes the reason why A Perfect Circle is a band unlike any other. That reason is &quot;Pet.&quot; Enjoy another album from one of rock's most essential bands.
B000002B1M|4.0|Lets be real. This album is a great album just like his other releases. I am not trying to say this album is a Hip Hop Classic, but this is one of Nas'es most standout albums. Just about every song on this is a great song. I will admit. Nas did change the way flowed compared to the Illmatic album. His first album was more metephorical and punchlines but, at the same time the songs were meaningful. On the it was written CD, Nas came more gangstalike, but his songs were definately understandable. Overall this a fantastic album.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Another Amazing Cd from A Perfect Circle, This compiments their last album amazingly. Every track is excellent, i cant stop listning to it! Buy This Album Now!!!
B0000BYM3K|3.0|I was quite disappointed when I grabbed my copy of DOD from the shelves of Best Buy and saw the cover art...WTF were they thinking? Is that Eddie in that robe??  And the text that &quot;DOD&quot; is written in...oh my. But besides that, I was defintely rather disappointed my first listen....but I must admit, the album did grow on me.  It is different by leaps and bounds in terms of the sound.  This does NOT sound like Maiden to me...sure Bruce is there and Nicko's style is very recognizable...but that's where it ends.  Where did Steve Harris go???  To me, their sound is DEFINED by that man's bass playing...not many other bands have ever had such a distinct cutting and driving bass sound.  It sounds like Steve was out to lunch on this album...or perhaps Bob Rock slipped in and produced this album under an alias :)  Pick it up and check it out...but be warned...it's a new sound.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|Another brilliant CD by A Perfect Circle, i cant stop listning to it! Buy this cd now!!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Unlike other bands which change their sound to go with the latest trends (such as Metallica), Maiden has remained very close to their original sound. Yes, Maiden has &quot;matured&quot; a bit with their sound, but it still sounds like Maiden, and is still great. The first track on this, Wildest Dreams, is the disc's only weak spot. Other wise, you have a great disc. There's the epic tunes (Dance of Death, Paschendale), and everything else you'd expect from Maiden. If you liked Brave New World, you'll like this. Heck, if you like Iron Maiden in general, I recommend checking it out. Great disc.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|If you are looking to listen to Tool you need not apply but if you are looking for A Perfect Circle this is a fantastic CD. Maynard is a musical genius and can add any type of feeling to any song he writes, GOD would be an understatement. The sophomore album just puts this band ahead of the rest. You may not like it when you first listen to this CD but keep listening and you will start to understand its power.
B0000024LN|5.0|This is album is the best i heard for a very long time. It ranks up to 2pacs &quot;All eyes on Me&quot; and OutKast first LP. This CD is one the very few CD that you dont have to skip tracks...... The skits are hilarious..... And the lyrics and beats are off the hook. There are a few appearences by Method Man, Mally G, Keith Murray, etc., but Redman holds his own. If you like true rap, pick up this album....... You wont be disappointed.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I did not think that A Perfect Circle could do better than their first album, but they did.  I am so impressed.  Maynard voice is beyond anything I could imagine.  Buy this album, you won't regret it.
B00001QGPS|4.0|Blackout starts off a a classic but kinds falls short after the 16th track. I didnt care too much of &quot;Big Dogs&quot;, and the remix of &quot;How High&quot;. I was looking torward to the original version. The best songs of Blackout are &quot;Fire in the Hole&quot;, &quot;Mi Casa&quot;, &quot;Checka&quot;, and &quot;Tear the Roof off&quot;. The rest are above average.
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|Quite the opposite of the first album, Thirteenth Step takes the listener on another journey - a new road perhaps, showing the different sides of the members who are currently 'A Perfect Circle'. This side project highlighted by Maynard of Tool (or at least drew the interests of many), which seems ever evolving and changing, has done nothing but brought music created from the hearts of the group for the listeners - not for the record label. <br />If you're looking for another Mer de Noms or TOOL CD, don't look here. I went expecting something new... and I got what I wanted. Check out target/bestbuy... I picked mine up for about $10.... can't get better than that...
B000088E6M|5.0|AN INCREDIBLE CD*****<BR>KEEP SMILING 50 CENT:)!!!<BR>LOVE YA!
0451169514|5.0|Ignore any bad reviews you read on this website. IT is a masterful tale, although long: the paperback is 1,080 pages long, with the hardcover 1,138 pages long. <BR> The book starts out with the death of Georgie Denbrough, the little brother of one of the hero's in this long but great tale. <BR> Bill Denbrough, Beverly Marsh, Mike, Richie, Stan Uris, and Ben all experience with this ancient evil that has been haunting their town called Derry. The thing about it, the people who live in this town try to ignore it like it goes not exist at ALL! <BR> The townspeople are scared of what lurkes in their sewers. <BR>The story takes place in two times: Derry 1958 and Derry 1985. <BR>Mr. King goes through both times very easly, and most of the times when u r reading this novel, you dont notice it. <BR> Then in 1958, they go down in the sewer, all experiecing with IT: who calls himself Pennywise, and they destroy IT; or so they think.<BR> Mike, the only kid who stays in Derry, see's a number of murders of small children happening again like it did back in 1958. So he calls all his friends, and back in 1958 they all made a promise that they will come back to fight IT again. <BR> So they come back (minus Stan because he slits his wrists in the bathtub while spelling IT in his own blood and his wife discover's his corpse.) and recollect the memories of that summer. <BR> I dont want to give away the ending because that would just destroy the book, but read it nontheless. GREAT NOVEL.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This album is amazing! I especially enjoy The Nurse...Maynard is a genius! You must buy this album!
B0000AXE8I|3.0|Honestly, I did not love this movie. I really wanted to, but I didn't. However, I don't think I hated it quite as much as many other reviewers. One thing is for sure though: it certainly didn't live up to my expectations, particularly given how much I enjoyed the first Matrix. The first one somehow managed to combine outstanding special effects with an intelligent and well-plotted storyline. This one seemed to rely too much on special effects and did not do much to drive the story along in my opinion. Granted there were some really exciting scenes, but it wasn't enough to keep me consistently entertained. Unfortunately, it did not leave me eagerly anticipating the conclusion. I am still giving it 3 stars purely for the imagination that went into to whole series, and hopefully the third film will bring a little more storyline along with all the effects.
B000092ZYX|4.0|radiohead is still WAAAY above average in my opinion, but to compare HTTT to OKC is setting yourself up for some major disappointment.  <br />instead, I would consider HTTT a much more *polished and perfected* version of Amnesiac.  For me, I'd prefer the roller coaster ups and downs (like the dramatic jump from &quot;You and Whose Army?&quot; to the horrible &quot;Pulk&quot;) to a cd with a relatively good songs that all sort of blend together (that's httt).  Their new album is nothing groundbreaking, but it's nice and pleasant<br />At times when everyone's &quot;rocking out&quot; to HTTT, I am rediscovering Radiohead's old B-sides, such as Trickster, and I'm developing a new sense of appreciation for their more rock-oriented-less-electronica style.  However, to new Radiohead fans this cd'll be a treat.  To an old timer, I think we just set our hopes a bit too high.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I think that this album is totally different from &quot;Mer De Noms&quot;, but at the same time look at the new artists in the band. They have the perfect combination for a killer, melodic sound.
B00008AY3L|1.0|the kids at my bus stop would steal their sisters new kids on the block giant buttons and throw them down the street to see how far they would roll.<br />please don't allow this man to make more music.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|The title says it all, the sweet vocal melodies of Maynard, the god-like guitar skills of Billy, the professional back up of James, the amazing bass tunes hammered by Jeordie, and the rythmic drums from Josh, put them together and you get one hell of an album. Every song on this album is worth listening to, the art, the music, believe me it's worth it. Buy it, or do as Maynard suggested &quot;Buy 6 of them, glue them together and make a box, you can put sh*t in it.&quot;
B0000AZJXQ|4.0|My First expieriance listing to this cd was at 12:30 on Tuesday morning... half an hour after the cd came out. It is a perfect cd to listen to...any time. The sound is more exotic and the songs... more under your skin than in your face. It makes you want to move... like Maynard(from TOOL) does on stage. But we tend to forget the other great musicians that are in this band. James Iha (live) formally from the smashign pumpkins, Jordie White formally Twiggy Ramarez from Marilyn Manson, Josh Freeze who is an amazing drummer from the punk band the Vandils, and Billy Howerdel who I beleve did tech for  Nine Inch Nails tour all coming through and all shining through individually. I can listen to this cd all the way through with out needing to skip tracks. I do think that some of the tracks lyrically, forgive me, could be a bit stronger, such as VANISHING, but thats just me.
B0000B3FCX|4.0|Nickelback seems to step it up just a bit with THE LONG ROAD.  This CD displays some good hard rock sounds.  Remains true with Nickelback's previous releases, and rolls out the future hits.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|In this 12 track cd, all different emotions are felt throughout it.  The band took a different direction on this album and it has now been rated album of the year by me. Maynards vocals and lyrics are better than ever and the band musical compostition is amazing. Even the order of the songs is perfect. This cd is and probably will be in my cd player for a long time. APC kicks ass and i cant wait to see all the florida shows.
B00005JLZN|1.0|This movie was perhaps the biggest disappointment of last year.  It could have been the riveting, shocking drama that was promised.  Instead, it quickly beomes hokey, second-rate, easily predicatble tripe that is so obsessed with its own attempts at being clever that a decent script was forgotten somewhere.<br />It wants desperately to be smart and shocking, but it is anything but.  Anyone paying any bit of attention can guess the ending within the first half an hour.  (Every one of the five people I watched it with did.)  The only areas where this movie succeeds is in making all death penalty abolitionists look like a bunch of nutbags, and all women look like either devious and conniving jezebels or helpless and clueless morons who need a man to guide them every step of the way.  Anyone against the death penalty or with feminist leanings will be offended, as will anyone who knows a good movie when they see it.
B00009ATIX|4.0|In a recent interview, Stanislaw Lem said he was disappointed that Soderbergh's update brought the love story to the forefront. Agreed, but the movie clocks in at half the length of Tarkovsky's, so naturally many of the philosophical threads can't be addressed. Lem, like many other writers in similar situations, needs to stop thinking of his novel as the sacred scripture from which the adapting artist should not deviate. He should understand that hacking a text to pieces, selling it for spare parts, junking what doesn't fit, reassembling it--this is high praise. Soderbergh does a great job with the story, and with the camera (as usual, though he was coming off of &quot;Full Frontal&quot; which has my vote for the worst movie of the last 10 or 15 years), and the performances are all fantastic as well. I don't believe there is as much sacrificed in this 90-minute version as Lem would have us believe. It's still a deeply thought-provoking story.
B000003N89|2.0|Sure, this album works on the same level as a fun dance album would- it's not dance, but it's something that you would put in when you don't want to hear music that is stirring and inspiring. And sometimes, you don't, right? But I wish people would stop making all these statements about how darn great Diana Krall is, come on??It makes me wonder if this is the first piece of jazz these guys have ever bought. To praise this and call it great jazz is insulting, to well, great jazz!!Diana is a completely middle of the road singer, and the catch is, is that,she doesn't really know what to do with jazz. She sings in more of a soft pop tone and doesn't possess any real emotion. There isn't anything distinctive or expressive about her voice. Her piano playing is lackluster-it doesn't bring out any of the nuances in the music and sounds positevely detached. I believe that Diana Krall is much more about good marketing, than she is about true music. There can't be any other reason such a mediocre singer has come so far.
B000001FCB|4.0|Elis, the little hurricane, had one of the most powerful singing voices--amazing range and acuity, and it's all on display on this record, because Jobim's compositions have an equally impressive range. Some of the arrangements are a little too \\"poppy\\" for my taste, but the electric organ works to great effect on a tune like \\"So tinha de ser pra voce.\\" And everyone is familiar with the version of \\"Aguas de Marco\\"--the very structure of the lyrics allows Elis and Tom's voices to engage in a sinuous cat-and-mouse game. By the end of the song, they are simply singing out disconnected syllables, both under the spell of the music. \\"Triste\\" is given a nice turn, though the guitar solo at the end doesn't quite fit. Elis lets it all go on one of Jobim's quintessential ballads, \\"Retrato em Branco e Preto\\", Tom very tasteful on the piano behind her. All in all, a little syrupy, yes, but it can be forgiven because it was the 70s, and syrup was everywhere.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|I have owned Mer de Noms for over three years...It was one of the few cds in my collection that I never got tired of listening to...And I can very safely say that Thirteenth Step has now been added to that list of few...I couldn't wait until this album came out, just so I could see what APC was going to do next...Well I've seen, and it's beautiful...To the band memebers: Thank you for the great music...Looking forward to more in the future...
B00006IU73|5.0|I originally heard of this band on Amazon.com, as they consistently turned up in my recommendations based on other albums I said I liked (mainly prog type stuff). One day, in the record store, I happened upon this for ten bucks and figured, what the heck. Upon first listen, I thought, hey this is pretty cool. Not exactly what I expected, as I had assumed a more prog influenced sound, but some cool and memorable songs. The kicker came on the second listen. I just sat there with my jaw in my lap as song after song just floored me. From the hard rocking opener &quot;Blackest Eyes&quot;, to the hypnotic and powerful &quot;Trains&quot;, the Meddle era Floyd-like &quot;Lips Of Ashes&quot; I was stunned: How has this band not hit big in the states? I kept listening. The next track &quot;The Sound Of Muzak&quot; ripped the music industry while at the same time was tuneful enough to be a natural on a rock radio playlist. Then the epic &quot;Gravity Eyelids&quot;. I literally had goosebumps. I could go on and on, but every second you spend reading my review is a second you are not going out and buying this album. To sum up: If you like Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Tool, or just any great, intelligent rock: BUY THIS ALBUM! Then dig into the PT catalog, you won't be disappointed.
B00009V7T2|5.0|at the most, the singers voice sounds like Rush, but the styles and abilities are at absolute opposite ends of the spectrum...<BR>aside from that, if i HAD to (note: had to) make a comparison, i would call The Mars Volta the [lonely] child of Radiohead and Blue Man Group (more RH than BMG...and i only mentioned blue man because the drumming is SICK!)  <BR>this is an intense, immensely talented group of individuals that deserve to be heard and appreciated as musical geniuses<BR>buy the album, its worth the money, unlike most music of today
