0316154687|3.0|I am a rookie Sedaris reader, so I am unsure how this compares to his older material. I found the bulk of the stories to be simultaneously interesting and familiar at the same time.<br /><br />Sedaris recounts his days living in various pockets of Europe and the US and encounters every day menaces that we all have came across: the rude cab driver, the misunderstood neighbor, the apathetic couple, the loud passenger on a plane.<br /><br />As far as humor is concerned, I never uncontrollably laughed but thought the author's insight was clever and probably resulted in a mild laugh an average of once per story. In the end, I enjoyed the various adventures and the stories/lessons Sedaris was sharing.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|How can you go wrong with Pixar production.  Lots of fun and emotions for the entire family, the story, the characters are so good and touched.  Amazon was great for delivery, followed up with special pre-order price to match with other merchants.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Product got in later than the due date, but it was worth the wait. Awesome image, sound and movie.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I've been reading a lot of the reviews submitted for both the stereo and the mono sets; which is better, etc.  I truly appreciate a lot of the information and specific songs, parts, variances that many of the more expert listeners have submitted.  I'm just a life long hack who loves this music still and have been content to listen to them via LP, cassette, 8 track, 1980s cds and the new superduper, no phony baloney remastered sets.    I bought the stereo set and a friend has given me mono tracks for Sgt. Pepper and an assortment of songs that some of the previous reviewers have given as examples. (Thank you for that!)    I also have the Capitol Releases that feature those cds remastered in stereo and mono. So, I think I'm set.    Again, I'm no expert but as a life long fan listen for certain parts that sound clearer (If I Needed Someone) in stereo or sound fuller in mono (I've Just Seen A Face). I'm still tyring to figure out which sound does Sgt. Pepper greater justice.    I find it funny that the mono vs stereo debate has accelerated since the sets were released.    My generation ( 12 years old in 1964) thought that stereo was the ultimate way to listen to any music. We couldn't wait to get everything in stereo!    Then cds started to crop up in the 80s and I noticed a certain emptiness in \\"the middle\\". You know, clear vocals and instrumentation but something sounded hollow within the songs. I mean, I could hear vocals, instrumentation and certain nuances in guitar solos ( I never knew Paul did the bass part vocally in \\"I Will\\" until I downloaded the song from my 80s cd and put it on my Ipod).     Still, some things have not improved with all of the technology we've gone through. The drum break in \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" never has had the kind of loudness and pop that I've heard when I've seen it done live by tribute bands like the Fab Faux or 1964-The Tribute. That \\"pop\\" I'm listening for has never been there. So, maybe that's the way the boys recorded it.Too, bad, it sounds better with the louder drum break.    Whatever your preference, both sets improve upon what was previously available. The importance to a true Beatles fan is that they're both available to us even if some of us can't break down the sound quality as expertly as others out there. I thank those that can and have used their advice and comments to learn something new about this beautiful music that I've been listening to for over forty years. I still have my original LPs. I ruined them by picking up the needle and placing it songs that I preferred to hear out of order. I tried to be careful, but, when one is young, distracted or not fully conscious, the hand slips. I'd like to think that my generation paved the way for needle play for the legion of hip/hop, rap, house djs that followed us. Take that, youngsters!    God rest my father's soul. He was Cuban, didn't speak English well, didn't understand the British Invasion and said it would never last like Sinatra. Still, I'd catch him humming \\"Yesterday\\", \\"And I Love Her\\" or \\"Something\\" around the house.    Hey Pop, guess what? My music held up, too. Strawberry Fields Forever.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I read the books and didn't know what to expect from the show. I have to say I was pleasantly surprised! It has a little soap opera, action adventure, fantasy, horror, semi-porn and B movie in it. I just think it's fun! NOT for kids! The show follows the books pretty well... but they go more in-depth into the less important characters like Tara. You also learn a lot about V... vampire blood that's used by humans like a drug. I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who likes vampires, sex and the Sookie Stackhouse books!
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|.....Does anyone remember that Judy Holliday won the best actress award in 1950?  Bette Davis (ALL ABOUT EVE) said that she and Gloria Swanson cancelled each other out and that opened the door for Holliday.  The fact that Swanson did not win and that Sunset Boulevard did not win Best Picture can be attributed to the petty politics of the Star Machine that built up and then discarded aging actors like spoiled milk when they could no longer pull their weight at the box office.  It was a cutthroat business and they didn't like having their dirty linen aired.    .....Gloria Swanson gives the performance of a lifetime as the aging star still living in the past and William Holden's performance as the wise cracking con man established the screen personna that would win him an Academy Award in 1953 in another Billy Wilder Black Comedy, \\"Stalag 17\\".    .....It would seem that the movie was written specifically for Ms Swanson because she had been a Silent Screen Star but that was not the case.  Swanson had been retired from films since the talkies and Wilder originally wanted Mae West for the part of Norma Desmond.  He wanted to write a \\"Black Comedy\\" that would spoof Hollywood and the Desmond character was supposed to be a parody of an over-the-hill actress that would make the audience laugh.  It was George Cukor who recommended Swanson to Wilder and it was the best posiible choice.  Ms Swanson was so perfect for the part that she pulled the audience in and won their sympathy.  They didn't laugh at her character, they felt compassion.    .....Holden's character who originally used Desmond for his own personal gain redeemed himself when he rushed to her bedside after her suicide attempt.  In a gut wrenching scene after he admonishes her for being so foolish and she sobs that she will do it again, the band that she had hired for her seduction scene of her young lover, begins to play Old Lang Syne to an empty ballroom.  Holden goes to her bed and wishes her a Happy New Year.This is a great movie and a must have for the serious collector.
0061914177|1.0|I reconsidered my 2 star review and gave it 1 star.  This book is a LOSER as are all who rate it 5 stars. TWoM.  Total waste of money.<br /><br />I would give this book only 2 star if the content were not so darn current....and trust me for this book that is the only saving grace.<br /><br />Read it at the gym on my Kindle, otherwise my reading time would have been even more wasted.<br /><br />Content may be relevant for a 20 somthing or even a 30 something but I am neither and the book offered very little for a standard business that you couldn't gleen with a little social networking knowledge. As a current owner of a business I was offered very little useful information.  If I didn't own a business or have any decent ideas it MAY have been more helpful...but I doubt it.<br /><br />If this were a movie I would say wait to rent or just don't watch it at all.<br /><br />Gary V (author) is an interesting case study in business growth (and looks to be an extremely dynamic entreprenuer on his web blogs) but my gut feel is that \\"personal branding\\" that Gary touts is already being squeezed because of its very viral nature to allow only a few dynamic personalities to rise to the top and create sizable incomes.<br /><br />Gary says to work til 3:00AM and wake refreshed at 6:00AM ready to build your brand...I guess Gary aint lived in a 40 year old body yet, or heard the phrase \\"work smarter, not harder\\".  My understanting is that Warren Buffet didn't amass his fortune keeping those kind of hours and my guess is that Warren's business model is not dead yet.<br /><br />Unless your only goal is \\"personal branding\\" I would recommend \\"Duct Tape Marketing\\" (John Jantsch) which is a book with real relevance to the real world.<br /><br />I agree with the reviews that say that something is up with the reviews of this book.  5 star reviews for this book should be the vast minority and not the other way around:(
B001M4YZ90|2.0|While I have to hand it once again to Guy Ritchie for his unique style as a director-this film really is a terrible, nonsensical imitation of snazzier London gangster movies which have preceded it (Ritchie's own for example).  Simply put, \\"Rock N Rolla\\" is a sharply directed and sharply executed mess.    Well acted and full of strong character portrayals-the problem with \\"Rolla\\" really comes down to plot.  Crucial plot points zip by with lightening speed with very little time for the viewer to really digest or process before being assaulted with another lightening round of additional plot points.  I'm well aware that this is all part of Guy Ritchie's style, but it seems a bit too manic here even for a Ritchie film.  And the film continues to barrel along in this fashion throughout its entire duration-never really letting the viewer catch his or her breath until finally a person just has to ask themselves, \\"huh?\\"    One of the major problems for me with this film was that every character (each coming from very different factions) seemed to be involved in every other character's business in some way and after a while, it became really frustrating to try and grasp who was working for whom and who was playing whom.  Quite frankly-after a while I just really didn't even care any more.  And in the end, when it all came down to it-the movie just seemed completely pointless anyway.  It's too bad the actors involved in this film (an impressive bunch of performances mind you) wouldn't have had a stronger, more \\"sensical\\" plot to work with.  It truly is a waste.  Watch this film for its style, but don't expect anything even remotely akin to substance here.
B001992NUQ|5.0|I do not want to talk too much cause the disk was already reviewed on a number of different sites. The movie is fantastic as we all know, but the HD quality of the sound and picture really surprised me. Fantastic all around and surely worth the purchase.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This is the best movie ever made.  Not much of a review - but there you have it.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|I grew up reading this book and bought the dvd as soon as it came out.  Now as I am a mother this movie is a favorite for my whole family.  It is perfect for my 4yr old who loves the magic of Santa and my 2 yr old who is obsessed with trains.  It is great to have a movie that our whole family can watch and enjoy.  I think this is the perfect addition to any families Christmas movie list!

0316010669|1.0|\\"Trust your instinct except when it's wrong\\".<br /><br />There, I just saved you $10. No kidding, that sentence is the entire book. Sorry Gladwell fans, I must say this book is terrible. For the first few chapters, Gladwell talks about all these instances where lives, money, and prestige were saved thanks to people who trusted their instincts (or where all this was lost, because people did not trust their instincts). So you're thinking, great, you should trust your instincts. Then without warning, all his stories start to shift to ones where people trusted their instincts and turned out to be wrong. The End. And you're left wondering, why did I just read 10 stories where people who trusted their instincts were sometimes right and sometimes wrong? Of course that would happen.<br /><br />Skip this book.
0800177975|5.0|It's so strange to me that this movie tanked at the box office.  This is one of the most entertaining movies I've seen, and it comes with a message that even children understand.  In this movie Schwarzenegger plays a movie hero.  One of his biggest fans, a boy, gets sucked into the movie with him.  While in the movie the boy sees first hand that what happens in movies is completely unrealistic.  When Schwarzenegger and the boy get pulled form the movie into real life, the opposite occurs and Schwarzenegger gets to see the real life is not like the movies.  If you get shot, you get hurt and might die.  If you shoot your gun at a car it doesn't explode.  If you punch a window, it actually hurts.  And women in real life?  Well, they're not all super models.  Etc.<br /><br />It's one of those movies that everyone in Hollywood wanted to be in and so there are loads of very famous actors and actresses in it.  It's funny.  It's exciting.  It's very tongue-in-cheek.
B00288KNLS|5.0|Arrived quickly in great condition.  Can't say anything about the CD quality yet though as it is a Christmas present.
B000TT1QLE|5.0|...and even worse, it's repeated on the four individual cardboard sleeves inside. I'm sure I've seen worse covers, but I can't actually remember when.<br /><br />However, by opening the box and its contents face down, so that I don't have to look at this particular bit of silliness (hopefully the deviser thereof has since been taken out and shot), and then bunging the disc in the machine and hitting the play button - magic! Ms Hewitt may never make the supermodel stakes in cheesy covers, but by gosh she does when the fingers tinkle the ivories. Suddenly you forget the stupid covers and disappear into the world of the genius that was and is J.S. Bach. The WTC is one of the great achievements of the keyboard, and Ms. Hewitt makes it dance and sing and jump for joy, but without overromanticising it in any way. You (well, OK, I) find yourself moaning along and singing and waving your hands in the air and tapping your feet.<br /><br />Purists will (correctly) point out that this was written for the harpsichord, so playing on a modern piano is inappropriate. However, I am no purist, and if a modern artist on a modern instrument can make an 18th century composer speak to us today, then s/he has my vote. What would J.S. have thought? I bet he'd have loved it. Of course, given a modern Steinway, he, one of the greatest keyboardists of his time, would have written extraordinary things and not the WTC we now know.<br /><br />To my admittedly untutored ears, Ms. Hewitt communicates Herr Bach brilliantly. To me, it simply SOUNDS right. I recommend it.

B000005RXH|2.0|I've collected just about all the Supertramp albums. Ok I admit it, my favourite by FAR is the first one, so I can't say that my opinion counts for anything that could stand for a general concensus; definitely not.    The first album was a big prog effort, while their later efforts were slick prog-pop, sometimes catchy, usually thoughtful. I was expecting this to be more prog but it's just a bunch of wonky-sounding pop songs. And by \\"wonky\\" I don't mean progressive in any way, but off-key sounding and unprofessional. Maybe the cover says it all, when they recorded this they might have been stone drunk writing their lyrics on some groupie whose 'papa don't mind'.    Ok it does have some highlights. They seem to be going with country-rock but are unsettled and are still searching. There's definitely an influence from 'The Band' here. The mood here is a lot more up-beat than on the debut, and is more care-free than the more philosophical Supertramp that would re-emerge to great success in the late seventies. However the production sounds like it was reocrded on Archaic equipment, didn't this band just get millions of dollars? Oh anyway the songs are striving for pop perfection but the song writing craft is lacking. There's just not enough hooks or strong melodies to tie this one down. My favourite tracks are the off-kilter 'Potter' and the loving ballad 'Forever'.     I'm not saying don't buy it, it does complete your Supertramp collection.  They were still a young band searching for their sound and we're just testing themselves out here. It's interesting to see them in the development stage.
1416594787|5.0|I got interested in evolution because of my study of 19th century British intellectual history, which led me to Charles Darwin and the ramifications of his \\"Origin.\\"  Although my focus is the 19th century, I am always on the lookout for good books on evolutionary theory (and have reviewed several on Amazon), written for the non-scientist, and this is a very good and useful one. The author has engaged extensively in the \\"intelligent design\\" wars, but one thing I liked about this book is its more positive tone: what is the evidence for evolution?  Not to say that Dawkins does not, from time to time, point out a fallacy in ID arguments, but that is not the primary goal of the book. In one 450 page treatment, the author covers about every conceivable point relating to evolution. Another bonus of the book is that Dawkins writes very well for the layman when discussing scientific terms, approaches, and studies.  There was only one chapter (that dealing with how the human body develops from single cells) where I got a bit lost in his discussion.    Darwins develops his evidence for evolution in an interesting fashion.  First he talks about what a scientific \\"theory\\" is, since this is a frequent point of contention with those who dispute evolution. Next, he focuses on dogs and cows, and other domestic animals, to argue that the multiplicity of canine breeds (all derived from the wolf) demonstrates how man has employed evolution--the so-called \\"artificial evolution.\\" Natural evolution takes place without human intervention, in nature, and is not controlled by anyone or anything. An interesting chapter is devoted to methods of dating rocks and embedded fossils. Moreover, the author contends there are such things as \\"living fossils (e.g., guppies).     Dawkins rejects any suggestions that the fossil record is incomplete.  In fact, he says we don't even need fossils to verify evolution; in any regard, more are being discoved all the time.  Nor is there a human \\"missing\\" link, as he discusses the extensive human fossil record--quite a thorough but compact discussion with superb illustrations. The importance of tectonic plates and isolation is the subject of another chapter. Two later chapters I found particularly interesting: one on the vestiges of prior evolutionary stages left in animal and human bodies; the second on what Dawkins refers to as the \\"arms race\\"--how animals are in competition to survive and develop biologic weapons as part of the \\"survival of the fittest.\\"  The book includes extensive illustrations, including 32 pages of helpful full color illustrations: 6 pages of notes; and a 7-page bibliography (some of which sources are discussed in the text). An extremely helpful discussion of the topic by one of the best informed scientific students of evolution.

B002BU0DPE|4.0|For the record, I have 5.1 surround sound but wanted this headset so that I could play while the rest of the family was sleeping.  However, my new main reason for this headset is the ability to hear things that I never thought were even in the games.  I play PS3 MW2 and SOCOM mainly and was blown away (no pun intended) by the various sounds I could hear.  Like footsteps, magazine reloads, etc.  I highly recommend this headset!!  It is comfortable during short and long sessions as I have played for 6 hrs with no problems (sore ears, head, etc).  My only gripe is that I wish the mic mute was a button rather than slide activated.  Other than that, if you're looking for a headset, I don't think you can go wrong with the Turtle Beach P21.
B0000YEE7Q|5.0|I saw this originally as a Hallmark television presentation in 1971, loved it; bought the book and loved it. This year in an English grad class I decided I wanted a copy of it; didn't know if it were still available, but as usual, amazon.com had it.  It's wonderful, particularly for English majors.
B00177Y9ZC|3.0|Don't get me wrong.  I enjoyed Hayden Christensen's performance in \\"Life as a House.\\"  And I felt he gave a good, strong effort in Star Wars trilogy.  But I just feel he's not the appropriate actor for the lead role of David Rice, the jumper whom the movie revolves around.  The guy discovers his jumping ability as a teenager, and runs away from home, leading to an easy life of crime.  After setting up this background, the movie picks up on David eight years later.<br /><br />If you pause and think about it, the character David Rice is an immature, small time crook who could basically go anywhere he wants to.  It's okay for him to steal to finance a lavish lifestyle, because he has that one-in-a-billion god-given talent to do it.  Life is easy for David Rice.  And I just think Christensen plays the David Rice role a bit too straight and narrow.  Rice is crafty, beguiling, the big easy, and Christensen does not role play Rice in that way.  Christensen has the good looks of a leading man for this film, but not the sly, charming, and shifty manner needed for this role.<br /><br />Perhaps Leonardo DiCaprio can take over for a Jumper II film?
0307454541|5.0|I don't know about you, but I have heard so much buzz about this book and the following books in this series that I had to read it.  I know, I know, I like to avoid those books, but there was something about this one that intrigued me.  Honestly, it was probably the cover, but I digress.<br /><br />To be fair, I found the first twenty or so pages to be a little dull and dry, but don't give up because that's just a little background to get you familiar with our main character, Mikael Blomkvst, an editor and journalist at Millennium magazine.  The premise is that Mikael wrote a piece about a corporate giant and gets burned in the process (a trial, jail time, etc.)<br /><br />Mikael receives an interesting job offer from a man named Henrik Vanger, of Vanger corporation.  He finally gets Mikael to do the job because he has information on Wennerstrom (the reason for the trial) that Mikael wants to salvage his career and reputation.<br /><br />Henrik commissions Mikael to write his family's history, and to solve a decades old murder.  This is where the heart of the story lies, in Mikael's research.  That may sound dull, but it is anything but.  The killer is still on the loose, and Mikael's research into the family does nothing him to prepare for the secrets and surprises that are to come.<br /><br />You may be wondering about who the girl with the dragon tattoo is, let's just say her name is Lisbeth Salander and she's unlike any female character you have ever seen in your life.  And that comment is marketed to an American audience because this book is Swedish and I don't read a whole lot of Swedish authors so I couldn't tell you if she's a stereotypical woman there, but I highly doubt it.<br /><br />The story will grip you and keep you on edge until you find out what happened to Harriet Vanger, and what's going to happen to Mikael, Lisbeth, Erika, Vanger and many, many more.  There are a few bits that are quite disturbing, but just keep on reading!<br /><br />Notes on the Cover:<br />There's something about these books that are very striking to me.  Maybe it's the use of yellow and green with the black letters, maybe it's the subtlety of the dragon tattoo on the cover.  Whatever it is, it works!that are very striking to me.

044024367X|1.0|Where to start... I'll start at the end and save you, dear reader, some time.  Simply put, DO NOT read this book. There are plenty of good Reacher novels, but this one is a gutter ball. Even Reacher seemed pissed about having to work his way through the tedious and totally nutty  plot... another one like this and Reacher's going to get on a bus, find Child in some hipster coffee shop in NYC, and give him a well-deserved pubic drubbing.
B00000ING2|5.0|Just as \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" is THE quintessential film for many people on Christmas Eve, so is \\"The Hudsucker Proxy\\" the quintessential film for me for New Year's. It's a Coen brothers film, so you know a few things up front: it will be creatively written and directed, it will have some delightfully quirky characters, and more than likely the film will be head and shoulders above the average dreck oozing out of Hollywood these days. What you may not expect is such a funny and oddly touching story that will carry you into the new year with a fresh perspective.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor: this New Year's Eve find some time before the big party to watch this film with a few friends or someone special. You won't regret it.
B002SQ364Q|1.0|this movie is not a movie. it is a thinly disguised notthing. and paying for this movie is a crime against every movie maker who truly makes an even decent movie. thismovie has none of the music, and none of the real joy of woodstock. although for my money there really wasn't any joy of woodstock. ya see the thing about it is, that all those who attended woodstock while preaching about love and drugs and whatever, were drinking and eating and being taking care of by those who worked their hinnies off. that little cleared area where they held woodstock? oh right, it had been taken care of for years by a farmer for his cows. and all that poop being removed from woodstock, some guy working had to remove it. and on and on. well ya get the drift.<br /><br />ya see the thing about those who want everything for \\"free\\" and want ti all just to be peace love and joy, is that they want all the amenities of civilization. they just want you to do the work while they spout off about \\"freedom.\\" freedom now, and always has cost a lot.<br /><br />and then there's that whole gory (that's the only word for it) hollyweird thing where even though \\"gays\\" are this very small segment of society, they must be a major factor in every movie. every girl must have her \\"best friend\\" be gay...isn't that intersting?<br /><br />so in this movie we have the main character exchanging a few googly-eyed pieces of conversation with another male who just happens to be a construction worker (can you say \\"village people:\\"?) and who the movie maker, ang lee, just apparently doesn't wanna do another brokeback, er i mean, woodstock mountain movie. know what i mean? but for all that, there sure isn't much \\"love\\" going on in the movie,<br /><br />the only saving grace? liev schrieber was hilarious as a dolled up security guy. but that's five minutes of a boring ineffective horrid no-redeeming grace movie.<br /><br />you only have so much time in yer life, don't watch this movie with any of it.

1570193800|5.0|I bought three Radio Spirits Christmas CDs and plan to look for more. I have not listened to an audio book, or vintage radio show in quite some time.  This really is something that should be done in a family setting.  Even at a large gathering.  Imagine, it's only an hour, people in s room, silent, watching kids faces and wondering what they are imagining etc.  Around the tree or fireplace.  We must do it more.<br /><br />A Christmas Carol with Alastair Sim is one of my favorite movies, and it is refreshingly revisited.  Recorded live in front of an audience, there are no retakes.  The only difference is that Alastair Sim was replaced with Orson Welles! This package is obviously misleading. With Sim on the cover, a scene from the movie, you expect him to be part of it. But otherwise, a fun experience.<br /><br />They mention John Barrymore was to be playing the role of Scrooge, as he had done on stage for many years, but he was ill. Therefore, Welles was a last minute replacement.  Barrymore was supposed to play Scrooge in the 1938 version of the film, but he also became ill at that time, and was replaced with Reginald Owen.  But Orson Welles is by far the welcomed surprise here and he is great.<br /><br />They left the intermission commercial breaks in, which is fun, and short enough.  Rounding the cd out to about an hour.  You are essentially hearing it exactly as we would have heard it over 60 years ago!<br /><br />Look closely to the Amazon special offers, as I got 4 various titles for the price of 3.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|This was a great movie which ties in well with the original Star Trek series.  Even Leonard Nimoy plays a part in this movie.  A must see.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|\\"Up\\" stands apart from most animated movies for two reasons. It begins with a lyrical and deeply touching portrayal of a life-long love affair of two people who meet and fall in love as kids -- and then marry and grow old together. This section, which lasts just a few minutes, is worth the price of admission alone. I can't think of another movie, animated or not, which paints such a lovely pictures of a marriage with all its joys and sorrows.<br /><br />The other point that makes this movie stand apart is that the hero is a grumpy old man, beautifully voiced by Ed Asner. Again, it's wonderful to see a movie with a protagonist in his \\"golden years.\\"<br /><br />Apart from that, we have the usual cartoon fare -- a quest, a pair or heroes, some adorable sidekicks, a nasty villain. It's all very well done and amusing and often pretty to look at. The overarching metaphor is that we can escape our daily humdrum existence by daring to look up and challenge the clouds and that dreams may be postponed but should not be denied. But what stayed with me from this movie was that wonderful opening 10 minutes.
0151013837|5.0|I had to buy a copy of this book for my husband after checking it out from the library.  The story is an unbelievable misadventure that breathes on the pages with the help of Martel's poignant protagonist.  The story had me so rapt that I couldn't wait to return to it and felt like a kid discovering the joy of reading.  The beautiful illustrations lend to that feeling of being a big kid with an adult picture book.  Lose yourself in this fantastic tale.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|Here's the classic, already available in an earlier dvd and three laser disc versions. I have all of the above, but had to grab this one, too. The picture is stunning. I've always felt disappointed by the other videos  because they never seemed to get the color exactly right. Well. this one certainly does it up big. It's Metrocolor, which is no three strip process to begin with, but this disc really improves it by really escalating the color values.     The commentary by Lehman is the same one from the last MGM dvd and several other items are duplicated, too. But there is a great new documentary, THE MASTER'S TOUCH, and the excellent AMERICAN EXPERIENCE biography of Grant.     The movie remains the same whirlwind cross-country chase, hodgepodge of THE THIRTY NINE STEPS and SABOTEUR as it alway was. Saw it in '59, and have been a major fan ever since. This is like having a print, and a better print than anyone has ever seen. Well worth re-buying.
0451528956|5.0|Jekyll and Hyde is commonly evoked to describe someone with a split personality. Stevenson's novel is not really about a split personality, but rather a dual physical and spiritual nature struggling for control of one person. In this struggle, Dr. Jekyll doesn't just assume a different personality, he actually becomes Mr. Hyde.     Presbyterian Pastor Tim Keller has a good, brief analysis of parts of the Jekyll and Hyde story in his book [[ASIN:B002FSMSPA The Reason for God: Belief in an Age of Skepticism (Hardcover)]]. Keller pinpoints a key point in the story, noting that it's in a moment of vainglory that Dr. Jekyll involuntary transforms into Mr. Hyde. This transformation occurs as Dr. Jekyll sits \\"on a bench in Regents Park, thinking about all the good he has been doing, and how much better man he was, despite Edward Hyde, than the great majority of people.\\"     All this to say that Stevenson's novel goes far deeper than a psychoanalytic study of a split personality; it's about a profound spiritual struggle of the evil and good nature within a person.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|I love kids movies. I love animated movies. I am not a big Nascar or racing fan. So, I was a bit concerned about whether I would like this movie or not. However, from the beginning to the end I found a smile on my face. This is a great movie that is a lot of fun (whether you are a kid or a 36 year old kid like myself). Highly recommended.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|In Treatment is one of the most original ideas for a television series in a long time. Short episodes do not allow for wasted time on useless storyline. Gabriel Byrne's transformation into a therapist is flawless. Between Monday to Friday there are real characters with every day problems that are sure to leave the viewer thinking. HBO you have backed a winning horse yet again, do the not so simple minded viewers a favour continue bringing these original ideas to life.
1416550542|5.0|Wow...I am so impressed with this book. The craftsmanship and love that went into creating this gem shines through. This is definitely one of my favorite books. Everything about this book...the plot, characterization, settings...perfectly described. You feel like you've lived the lives of the people the author has created. Stunning and a must read.
0345441184|1.0|I rarely every stop reading a book.  I slog through them because I feel committed.  This book made me want to not only stop reading but give up on fantasy.  I've read the Arthurian Legends in their many incarnations and wanted a feminine point of view.  The story could never get through the agenda of how terrible Christians were.  When in the beginning nuns were discribed as the \\"slaves\\" of priests I knew it was going to be bad.  The reality was that the convent was female world where women promoted learning and controlled their lives, especially in remote parts of Britain.  Then there were the historical inacuracies.  When reading a blending of history and fantasy I give a lot of room for playing with facts, but some were so bad they made me scream.  It made Dan Brown look like a rigid, fact geek.
0812550706|4.0|I think Orson Scott Card is a fine and very talented author. His success as a writer trumps mine to a ridiculous extent. I also like the fact that Card is engaged enough with his readers that he writes a review expressing his strong thoughts and feelings to us, his readers.<br /><br />I'm a voracious reader and I read almost all genres. I'm a bit of a neophyte in regard to sci fi, so I don't have a great pile of books with which to compare. However, I enjoyed Ender's Game. It was written tightly with a nice taut story line. The plot is fairly simple and I had no real problem with the sibling sub-plot as some did. I don't think the plot was particularly ingenious but it kept me reading. It would be interesting to know how many of the enormous number of reviews were written by teens and young adults. The fact that the book features kids may have added a vast young readership who would see this as the coolest book ever.<br /><br />I've read another title or two by Card and enjoyed them. And I will probably read more of him at some point. He's too great a writer to ignore.
0385340575|5.0|This latest Jack Reacher saga by Lee Child pits our nomadic hero's wits against both domestic and foreign adversaries and actually has him getting wounded in the process, a first for the series. It's packed with the fast-paced action, deductive reasoning and terse yet insightful prose fans have come to count on from Child's suspense-filled series. And instead of keeping his stoic hero perpetually young and invincible, author Child lets him deal with the very real ramifications of aging. My only warning: read this book at your own risk of becoming obsessed with this series.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|From the beginning to end of the movie i sat on the edge of my seat! All of the graphics and the story line blew me away! If you have not already seen this movie i would recommened you see it TODAY!
1400031354|5.0|I am now beginning the first book of the series, which appears to now be 10 books long.  I bought this because I found it on a clearance rack in Half Price Books and I love stories about strong women, and I thought it would be fascinating to read a book set in Africa by someone who has lived in Africa.  I am also always curious to see how male authors characterize women lead characters.  I was not disappointed in this tale on any count.  McCall Smith's storytelling is wonderful, humorous, and filled with a lot of heart.  His passages were very evocative of a dry, beautiful country which now seems so full of warmth and life to me instead of being just another faraway place on a map.  He does not shy away from the dark aspects of life, nor does he skirt the confusions and conundrums that plague daily lives of ordinary people, but he addresses them all in a matter of fact and amusing way so that the result is very uplifting instead of depressing.  If you want a read about how awful life is, you will have to look elsewhere.  There are certainly plenty of awful things that are addressed in this book and the first one which I am now reading, but he does not stuff you down in the mire, but creates characters who, through wit and will, rise above and make the best of their circumstances with dignity and sometimes aplomb.  I applaud this wonderful book and look forward to reading the entire series and probably some of his other series as well.
0786838655|5.0|Ever wonder what happened to the gods of mythology? Well, let me tell you...Nothing happened to them! They're still here and Olympus just so happens to be on the 600th floor of the Empire State building in New York City. New York City also happens to be where the young Percy Jackson lives with his mom, Sally Jackson and his horrible step-dad, Smelly Gabe.<br /><br />Now Percy is just another 12 year old who happens to be dyslexic and has ADHD...or does he? After a crazy incident with his math teacher, Mrs. Dodds (she turns into this terrifying winged beast and attacks him), Percy's life and the world around him will never be the same again. The journey begins for Percy on that day, discovering who and what he is. It seems the people closest to him know more than he does, his friend Grover, his Greek teacher, and even his mom. You see, Percy is a demi-god, a half-blood. And his father is none other than the god Poseidon!<br /><br />This adventurous first installment was a roller-coaster ride of action and monsters from mythology, as we follow Percy and his two friends, Grover the satyre and Annabeth daughter of Athena. Prophecies and lies propel the three on Percy's heroic quest to save humanity from a terrible war between the Greek gods, Poseidon and Zeus, as they travel from Long Island to Los Angeles, where they must seek the entrance to Hades.<br /><br />This book was just tremendously fun to read! I loved the spin on the gods, making it a rich and fantastical journey into the lore. Great for both young and adult readers alike. I cannot wait to see the movie in February with my son!
0385340559|2.0|The book is okay and I read it all the way through. I didn't really mind the mathematical premise though at times it seemed a little contrived. I also don't necessarily need a bloodbath from Reacher every time. However, Child disappointed me a bit. I don't know why he had to portray a bias against all things biblical. That was a turn-off to see his cynical bitterness. I also saw no reason to come down on the LAPD. Not sure where Child's head was at. I read Bad Luck and Trouble a while back but it also seems to me that the ending was particularly bleak. Not my favorite Reacher novel.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|This DVD is so sharp and clear, the color is fantastic, and is so much better than my VHS colorized version, it was like watching the movie for the first time. I highly recommend this DVD to all who love this movie as I do, and watch it every year at Christmas time. Merry Christmas Bedford Falls!
B002PMV9FG|3.0|Another Harry Potter movie, ** Yawn **  I got thru it, and it is the same as all the others.  Plot: kids, evil castle/school, odd teachers, Harry, Ron, a little girl named Hermione, some bad ass dude name Voldemort, a fat dude named Hagrid, etc.  What's great is if you've seen the other films, you can watch this and not pay attention.  Just eat the popcorn and enjoy the awesome film visuals.
B002VECM6I|5.0|This has be in my opinion Sandra Bullocks best performances! It touched my heart how the family reached out to someone in need and just look how he turned out! i look forward to the dvd coming to see it again! this is definitley going to be one of my favorites of all time!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I originally purchased this CD, in part, to show my support for a \\"regular\\" woman with an incredible talent. So many people have acted as though she couldn't be a superstar because she isn't young enough or beautiful enough. I bought this because I thought she could sing and I wanted to support a quality singer.     What I didn't expect was how utterly incredible Susan Boyle really is! I sat down with some family and began to listen to this one evening. We sat through the entire album in silence just listening to this incredible vocal artist. All of the songs are beautifully done, but tracks 9 and 10 are so moving that I cry every time I hear them.    This album was simply done. There is nothing complex or fantastic about the accompaniment. The focus is entirely on this woman's wonderful voice. I think there are few popular singers today who could pull of an album like this one because most simply don't have the sheer vocal talent.    Needless to say, I have since purchased several additional copies of this CD for Christmas gifts as everyone in my family who heard it now wants one of their own. If what you are looking for is a lot of fancy music (instruments and effects), this is not the CD for you. If you are looking for beautiful vocals and some moving songs, then you can't go wrong with this album - and the price is certainly reasonable at $10.
1439175640|5.0|I love to bake and I do it very often.  When my fiance and I went to NYC, we had to visit Magnolia Bakery.  I loved their banana pudding and wanted to try to make some myself.  I was worried when I ordered the book that the recipes were going to be fancy and very complicated, but to my surprise they were all relatively easy.  It is pretty much great recipes that are easy to make and taste amazing!  This book was COMPLETELY worth it!
1878424505|1.0|This book could best be described as an insult to people's intelligence.  Or perhaps the writing is just very very poor.  The author has just written an entire book on four common-sense principles and managed it by writing as if we are young children and repeating everything several times to fill pages.
B000OONQ9O|1.0|The movie itself gets 5 stars as the ultimate cult movie. I'm saying this as someone whose favorite movie is \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and who considers \\"Donnie Darko\\" underrated. This modern (OK, modern for 1979) retelling of a Greek legend is amazing, as all the comic-book-come-to-life characters give the movie a gritty realism mixed with existentialism and a melancholy sadness, particularly at the end. A lot of die-hard fans complain about the Ultimate Director's Cut, but honestly it's not that bad, except for the fact that Walter Hill changed up the end scene too much (which is inexcusable). Otherwise, the comic-book style interludes don't take away from the movie (and yes I've seen the original). The Blu-Ray adaptation is awful because essentially all you're getting is 7.1 Surround (if you have a home theater system) and a marginally better picture: I watched this and the DVD version on a Pioneer Elite 60\\" TV and didn't notice much of a difference. There are no real extra features and there doesn't appear to be any BD-Live content (though admittedly my Panasonic Blu-Ray player isn't hooked up to the Internet yet; I'm just saying I didn't see anything pertaining to BD-Live in the main menu). If you want The Warriors (and if you're a movie fan with a functioning brain, you will), save a couple of bucks and just get the DVD version. Can you dig it? CAN YOU DIG IT?!
B001KVZ6G6|3.0|Up was entertaining...at parts, but more or less a mediocre movie. Quite honestly, I felt like it was flat. It had a few funny parts...many of which they gave in the previews, but was no where near other Pixar greats.
B001QOGY9K|5.0|My daughter LOVES the Disney Princess collection. This movie is no different! I personally love the soundtrack and listen to it even when she is not around. I love the movie equally!! I cannot imagine anyone who wouldn't feel the same!

1400063736|5.0|This book was a purely delightful read from cover to cover. McCann is an accomplished writer and he has created a story that is entertaining and thought provoking on topics from racism to religion. It was one of those rare books that you are sorry when to see the last line: the world spinning.
0439023491|5.0|I loved this book and also The Hunger Games.  I can't wait for the third book to come out next year.  I had heard that these books were really good, but had no idea what they were about.  I took a chance on all the good things I heard and am so glad I did.  I felt they were very original, I have never read a series like this before and I finished both of them in 3 days. :)
B000I9YLUI|5.0|If you have not read the book, or do not watch it with outrageous expectations of this film depicting the book line for line then you are sure to enjoy it. It is a terrific love story with fun and interesting characters. Keira Knightly deserved that Oscar, the part where Elizabeth confronts Darcy is SO powerful, I just love it. I do think that Elizabeth's behavior at times is a little more bold than 19th century England would allow, but that is easy to overlook.
0930289234|5.0|There is so much to praise and review about this graphic novel that I hardly know where to begin. In the watchmen series there is an alternate reality of superheroes that have come and gone each bringing with them their brave strengths and cowardly weaknesses. Which is an entirely original cast of superheroes who range from the mundane (e.g., Nite Owl) to the fantastic (Dr. Manhattan) to the disturbingly sociopathic (Rorschach). The writing, the artwork--and the story all start, off with a bang and the level of suspense is riveting and does not let you down until the very end in which every piece of the rather, convoluted plot makes sense, and the story wraps up with a satisfying close to the finish for which the comic book saga itself was released 20years ago, and that no comic book since has been viewed and discussed as much as this one because of it,s  fictional based storylines which is for adults and of course  has opened the doors for deep  provoktive thinking in it,s characters storyarcs in which The  heroes/heroin,all have mind blowing complex psychological profiles to deal with in there everday mundane mild lives. Rorschach is not a playboy billionaire like bruce wayne but instead a troubled loner with a sociopathic streak that easily strikes at anyone who disturb his mild psycholgical maintained lifestyle. Nite Owl instead is a sexually impotent pushover.Dr.Manhattan, the lone character who really possesses supernatural powers gained from a quantum physics experiment gone wrong belongs neither here nor elsewhere on earth.Finally in the end it will go on forever in been an Icon of a book and a must have for any serious intelligent comic book reader or fan of the saga.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|Avatar certainly could have been a disaster, a technological husk with no soul. Worse, the reliance on CG characters could have landed it smack dab in the uncanny valley...the realm where special effects wizards attempt to match reality but reap unsettling and awkward results. Beyond all reasonable expectations, however, Avatar must be considered a smashing success.    It's easy to see why 3D has been pushed in lock step with Avatar; the film melds CG and reality to create breathtaking scenes and believable characters. The eye candy on offer simply hasn't been paralleled this year. But Avatar's most significant technological feat lies in its ability to confuse the viewer. Halfway through, I had entirely lost track of what was and wasn't CG. The main characters, though some of them were alien, appeared to be fully-fleshed entities, and the world surrounding them was simultaneously impossible and yet flawlessly presented before my eyes.    Beautiful scenery and high octane action can only carry a film so far, but Cameron's screenplay, though not without a few warts, succeeds in inviting viewers to a new world and lulls them into caring for its characters. The barebones story isn't particularly complicated, and many of the plot points are telegraphed well in advance. The focus here is on a simple story told well. Cameron takes his time introducing his world and slowly unraveling its mechanics. The 162 minutes are judiciously apportioned such that the pacing avoids the twin pitfalls of skipping proper character development and drowning in excess exposition. Some of the characters are necessarily flat, and a handful of one-liners fall a bit short, but most of the writing implies a sure hand at work.    Of course, Cameron writes with a message, and the elegance of his delivery comes very close to perfection. Science fiction and fantasy often deliver morally or politically charged messages via metaphor, and Avatar can be viewed as one epic metaphor. Said metaphors risk crossing the line from art to rhetoric when they try to attach explicit anchors to the real world, and Cameron's script commits this error in two unrelated lines. Still, considering the length of the film and the otherwise effective development of the metaphor, this is a decent record.    On top of these aspects of the film are more conventional concerns such as acting. Sam Worthington, Segourney Weaver, and a host of other notables fill their roles with polish, but again, the true acting miracle in Avatar revolves around the CG characters. Never will a glitch remind the viewer that they aren't watching humans. The wizards behind Avatar have managed to simulate the full breadth of human expression and movement; the execution is flawless.    Combined with another rousing score from James Horner, Avatar's superlative special effects, measured pacing, and likeable characters form an unlikely synergy. By the film's climax, my heart was in my throat every time the life of a character was threatened. Sitting through the credits, I realized that Cameron's enormous gamble had paid off. Avatar is a cinematic tour-de-force and fully deserves the accolades it will surely garner at upcoming awards shows.

Do you want to get better if you are just starting photography? Then this is a PERFECT book for you.     Ok. Yes, there are a few annoying jokes - I did not find them annoying thou.. But if you want to play along with the writer of this book, you should get into his jokes... He said this is a companion book... and he is just trying to be friendly and next to you while you take the shot. He is breaking the moment with a joke - which for some can be annoying - but if can call it silly, then you are going to get the best ideas for your next photo shoot...    Yes, get this book... If you are a pro, you might know everything in this book. But if you are not a pro... then get the book. Is worth the money. Even in 5 years you will get back to this book...    Yes, I like the book a lot. I just got it yesterday, and I went through the first 50 pages... And no, I do not get any profit out of this review...     Cheers!! and have fun taking photo shots!

It's a cute holiday film that makes me smile. Very much a chick flick. Nothing too heavy. Not sure what exactly makes it one of my favorites but it could be Jude Law. He is very, very cute in this movie :)

Certain rental versions of \\"UP\\" have NO ENGLISH SUBTITLES!<br /><br />Furthermore, these DVDs without the subtitles are going to make their way to Amazon.com as used copies for sale.<br /><br />So us hearing impaired people are going to have to PURCHASE a NEW version to avoid risking buying a used copy that doesn't have subtitles.<br /><br />Furthermore, why did you (Disney) decide to exclude hearing impaired people from the rental market in the first place?<br /><br />\\"Up\\" may or may not be a great film, but too bad I'll never know.<br /><br />ZERO stars for this major marketing blunder.
B0000AQS6R|5.0|I love this movie. It isn't secular Christmas until I've seen it each year. (I know it isn't the 'reason for the season.' That's the \\"other Christmas\\".) Every time I see it my appreciation grows deeper and I see it afresh. \\"My favorite part\\" changes every year!

Dexter Haven you have unsuspected depth!;  funny, 'Thank thee.'; characters willing to change, 'I'll be yar, I promise to be yar!'. I can't add to 157 comments. If you are a Katherine Hepburn, Cary Grant or Jimmy Stewart fan this movie should be in your film library.
B002T9H2LA|2.0|This movie sucked out loud. I cannot stand a movie with subtitles it's a horrible distraction from the actual movie to have to read while you are supposed to watch pictures on a screen am I missing something? I thought the point of a movie was to watch something not to read and watch at the same time. The good thing is the subtitles went so fast I couldn't even read the whole conversations! The so-called action packed movie of the year only had brief moments of action until the final ending. The last half hour was about all the action a person could stand it was good but, that was all nothing spectacular. Brad Pit stain is a hit or miss actor anyway there have been many movies he destroyed but there have also been movies that he shined in, this was not one of them. His accent was horrible and he lacked his so-called talent. This movie was a big let down but I never tend to believe the hype that comes out of Hollywood anyway so I wasn't setting my hopes that high to begin with. A little off topic but is anyone getting tired of hearing best movie of the year yet as an advertising pitch or is it just me?
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I just think this is such a feel good movie. It's funny,touching,and just the perfect good time movie! Love everyone whos in it.Great gift.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. Before, I was never a huge fan of Star Trek, but now I am in love with the characters, and I find myself watching old episodes of Star Trek and The Next Generation. I've also added ALL of the other Star Trek movies to my Netflix queue. I can honestly say that this new version of Star Trek set off a chain reaction of obsession for me.

B0026P3G12|5.0|This album was such a surprise.  Her rendition of Wild, Wild Horses is unbelievable really.  It makes me cry and I don't know why.  I had to go to the original Rolling Stones version and yes, it's good - but there is something about her singing of this song.  I am happy with more songs on this album than I have been in a long time.  Mixing the \\"rocker\\" with the \\"religous\\" seems weird on the surface, but it really works!

B00000JLWW|1.0|Titanic is a long, boring bomb of a movie that was grossly over-rated.  The acting is abominable.  The subplots about the personal affairs of several passengers are an annoyance to watch.  They are not believable as to what some people were doing with their time as their lives were in peril.  They detract from the real event, the sinking of the ship and circumstances that led to its happening.  Kate Winslet is a lousy actress and is tiring to watch.  The one good feature of the movie is the actual sequence of frames of the sinking of the ship, which are well done.

B001DJ7PR8|4.0|From a thematic standpoint, Woody Allen's second 2008 film offers nothing we haven't already seen in his earlier work like [[ASIN:0792846109 Manhattan]] and [[ASIN:B00005O06J Hannah and Her Sisters]]. Like those classics and several lesser efforts, this 2008 romantic dramedy is a distilled examination of why men and women long for romance and how we fluidly fall in and out of love as a result, often with dire consequences and not without personal humiliation. What makes this entry particularly welcome is the full-blooded infusion of Spanish art and architecture that brings an emotional ripeness to the story. It also helps that Allen has gathered a more eclectic cast than usual to inhabit the richly developed characters. This is easily the most enjoyable film he has made since going abroad and probably his funniest since at least 2000's [[ASIN:B00003CXGS Small Time Crooks]].<br /><br />The plot focuses on two American college friends, polar opposites on the subject of love, as they vacation in Barcelona for the summer. As the conservative one who values stability and devotion, Vicky is there to study \\"Catalan Identity\\" as she waits to return to the states to marry Doug, an ambitious young man who maps out their future with a stifling lack of spontaneity. Failed filmmaker Cristina, on the other hand, is a romantic adventurer who craves unbridled passion with no limits. Their differing perspectives on love clash immediately when they both catch the eye of renowned abstract painter Juan Antonio. He makes a supremely self-confident proposition to Vicky and Cristina to join him on a romantic weekend trip to Oviedo, a picturesque town near the northern coast. Naturally, Vicky is appalled and makes no bones in telling him so, but Cristina is excited by the idea of being seduced by him. They agree to go with him and face unexpected consequences. Things get even more complicated when Juan Antonio's tempestuous ex-wife Maria Elena shows up and forces him to face his weaknesses.<br /><br />Part of the resulting roundelay feels like a throwback to Allen's [[ASIN:B00005O06K A Midsummer Night's Sex Comedy]], but there is also a palpable sense of melancholy more reminiscent of his mid-period films like [[ASIN:B00005AUJK Crimes and Misdemeanors]] and [[ASIN:B000062XE6 Husbands and Wives]]. What remains consistent throughout is the filmmaker's incurable romanticism, a freshly optimistic viewpoint that makes the film thoroughly pleasurable despite the familiar set-up. The performances are terrific beginning with Rebecca Hall, a surprising find as Vicky, a young woman who thought she knew what she wanted only to find out too late that it's not what she wants at all. As a typical Allen heroine, Hall lets her initially strident manner as Vicky give way to a resonating sadness. As for Scarlett Johansson, the third time's definitely a charm. In [[ASIN:B000EQHXNW Match Point]], Allen exploited her effortless sensuality, while he tried to make her a fumbling Diane Keaton copy in [[ASIN:B000IU37SO Scoop]]. As Cristina, however, she gets to blend together her carnal allure and comic insecurity in a more seamless fashion. She has a wonderfully funny moment when she just can't control her titillation at Juan Antonio's proposal in the restaurant.<br /><br />For those who have only recently been introduced to his mesmerizing work by way of his maniacal killer in the Coen Brothers' [[ASIN:B00118T63C No Country for Old Men]], Javier Bardem is completely convincing as Juan Antonio, a man who effortlessly controls the fates of the three women enraptured by his sensual manner and open soul. Unlike a shallower actor like Antonio Banderas, Bardem manages to move between smoldering and vulnerable with fluency. As Maria Elena, Pen&eacute;lope Cruz finally comes into her own in a non-Almod&oacute;var film. Taking the concept of a tortured artist to an extreme, the actress blazes with dangerous vitality, even though the role is relatively minor. She brings visceral life to the combative relationship between her and Juan Antonio, and at the same time, displays a sharp Allenesque wit, especially when she slyly ridicules Cristina in Spanish during their tension-filled conversations. The always-reliable Patricia Clarkson is quietly effective as a family friend of Vicki's with secrets of her own, while Chris Messina conveys the right level of unctuous smarminess as Doug.<br /><br />The film is beautiful to look at thanks to the luscious, sun-dappled cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe. With Gaudi's most famous work on display, Barcelona could hardly look more appealing on film. Just as evocative is the atmospheric music by a bevy of contemporary Spanish composers. The one aspect that doesn't work quite as well as intended is Christopher Evan Welch's stentorian narration, which lacks the right level of irony to make the ploy worthwhile. Most of the time, it comes across as a conceit to explain parts of the narrative that seem clear enough from the scenes. Regardless, this is a genuine return to form for Allen and well worth seeing for fans.een her and Juan Antonio, and at the same time, displays a sharp Allenesque wit, especially when she slyly ridicules Cristina in Spanish during their tension-filled conversations.

B002VKE0XA|1.0|I have finally got around to witnessing this much talked about movie.  I've heard and read many great things about it.  \\"Scariest movie evar!!\\" they said.  Not really - not even close.  About 10 minutes in I started getting that same nagging feeling in my gut that I had when watching The Blair Witch Project. It was that feeling like \\"oh boy I am about to waste some time and walk away utterly disappointed\\" - and I was.    This movie is not scary at all.  I see a lot of people's number one defense of this movie is \\"you need a good imagination\\".  I have a great imagination.  Was I wondering if it was the demon Pazuzu moving the sheets or having fun walking through the ingenious \\"flour trap\\" set by the heroic Micah? Not really. Would a demon have something better do to than follow around a chubby girl her whole life? I'm leaning towards probably.  But let's forget about the whole \\"suspension of disbelief\\" thing,  the gags themselves are not scary either.  There are things that could have been done, maybe with a tiny bit bigger budget, that would have produced some real chills.  A Ouija board moving by itself and then catching on fire was not one of them.  One of the more effective things in the movie was when the girl got out of bed and stood there for several hours - not exactly breaking the bank with that effect are we? They would have been better off stealing some of the effects from \\"Ghost Hunters\\"(c'mon, you don't believe that show is real, do you?). Well at least they decided to include the paranormal staple of EVPs.  I think I heard the demon say \\"I want a hamburger\\" but I guess that's left up to interpretation of the garbled nonsense that's usually recorded.     Other problems were the acting and pace.  Acting is forgivable and I can look past it - I don't think they could afford Brad Pitt.  The pace of the movie sucked however.  You don't need money to fix the pace you need better writing.  Every \\"night\\" just left me more disappointed and I kept wondering whenthe movie was going to get good.  By the time something finally happened on the last night I really didn't care anymore, I was just thankful it was over.      If I was going to compare this movie to others in this sub-genre of demons and possession I would put this up against The Exorcist and Evil Dead.  If you really think this is better or scarier than those two movies you need to get your head checked(for demons possibly omg!)
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|Let's face it. If Meryl Streep was cast in a Fruit of the Loom commercial, she would still be the standout piece of produce, lending conviction to a one-dimensional part others would easily dismiss as too superficial. That's the way to view this ebullient, featherweight 2008 confection based on the [[ASIN:B000031WEN long-running jukebox musical]] from the prolific songbook of 1970's super-pop group ABBA, all of which were written by bandmates Benny Andersson and Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus. Even though there is barely a part there, Streep throws herself into Donna like it was [[ASIN:0784011710 Sophie Zawistowski]], [[ASIN:0783240171 Karen Blixen]], or [[ASIN:B000J103PC Miranda Priestly]]. She also gets to perform the lioness' share of the over two dozen songs that drive the flimsy, derivative storyline over its 108-minute running time. If you've ever seen an underrated 1968 Gina Lollobrigida farce called [[ASIN:6302641934 Buona Sera Mrs Campbell]], you'll recognize the plot straight away since it pilfers the same basic idea.<br /><br />This time, we are focused on the upcoming nuptials for Sophie, the beautiful twenty-year-old daughter of Donna, a resourceful hippie-chick who runs a dilapidated inn on a stunning Greek island. To make the chronology work, the story, one can assume, is set sometime in the late 1990's as Donna apparently led a hedonistic lifestyle in the late 1970's when she became pregnant while fronting a girl-group called Donna and the Dynamos. This becomes pertinent because Sophie's paternity is a big question mark and is about to be answered because Sophie clandestinely invites the three men who could possibly be her father to her wedding - staid British banker Harry, adventurous Swedish travel writer Bill, and divorced architect Sam. The inevitable complications ensue when all three show up on the idyllic island, each coming to the conclusion that he is indeed Sophie's father. Meanwhile, Donna invites the Dynamos - now best-selling cookbook author Rosie and multiple-married, cosmetically altered Tanya.<br /><br />Add Sophie's intended, a hunky beach boy named Sky and his equally tanned and toned pals, as well as her two giggly bridesmaids and a rhythmic chorus of Greek villagers - and you indeed have a musical revue for anyone in the mood for one. At the same time, that's the caveat because you have to love ABBA's music to be enthralled by a movie riddled with flaws. The pacing often feels off, especially when characters belabor their individual dilemmas ad nauseam. Some of the choreography in the production numbers feels amateurish, and the cinematography frequently looks washed out (Streep looks particularly pasty and red-eyed in certain scenes). These lapses probably have to do with the arguable decision to have the Broadway crew of producer Judy Craymer, writer Catherine Johnson, and director Phyllida Lloyd translate all this to the screen, none of whom have any significant filmmaking experience. Perhaps a Rob Marshall could have lent a more polished sheen to the proceedings, but then again, there is a certain camp value that makes you wonder whether the whole venture is meant to be a parody of a good musical. Note the energetic \\"Dancing Queen\\" number which feels like a Bollywood production number with all the village women parading down to the dock in exaggerated unison.<br /><br />In the end, I guess it doesn't matter since a game cast has been recruited to make it all work at the intended level of fun. Streep shines without peer and sings with supple conviction on lighthearted ditties like the title tune and \\"Money, Money, Money\\", as well as the more emotive ballads like \\"Slipping Through My Fingers\\" and \\"The Winner Takes It All\\".  She can't help Pierce Brosnan who duets with her sounding like a wounded cow on \\"S.O.S.\\" (The audience erupted in laughter whenever he sang). However, he regains some of his self-respect when he plays Sam straight-up. The other two actors - Stellan Skarsgård as Bill and the omnipresent Colin Firth as Harry - are also likeable though hardly challenged in their roles. Julie Walters as Rosie and Christine Baranski as Tanya perform petty larceny in stealing their scenes, especially in their specialty numbers. As the hopeful Sophie, bright-eyed Amanda Seyfried is sweet without being cloying and has a bell-like voice which she shows off well on the bookend anthem, \\"I Have a Dream\\". The climactic wedding party scene is like watching news footage of Sydney's Mardi Gras festivities, while the end credits flash on a karaoke reprise of \\"Dancing Queen\\" complete in Vegas drag-queen regalia followed by a funny encore of \\"Waterloo\\" (my personal favorite in the ABBA songbook).

B002FRNCG0|3.0|I have all of the Paramore albums and in comparison to the others, this is in line with their other works.  It is true to their style.  I love RIOT, it is their best album in my opinion, so I am slightly disappointed with Brand New Eyes because it's not quite as good.  Brand New Eyes is still good though; if you're at least a moderate Paramore fan, I'd recommend to go ahead and purchase the album.  I gave it 3 stars instead of 4 only because I was hoping for something as awesome as RIOT.  Compared to a lot of other bands, I think it's better.
B002SVBDYQ|3.0|A costumer definitely has to have an acquired taste to purchase and enjoy this unusual medley of songs.    This soundtrack is very similar to the Twilight soundtrack, because of their unusual selection of music, or at least for the average teenager's taste.  I originally didn't buy this before I saw the movie, because, truthfully I thought the music was just really bad.  Then once I heard how most of the songs really did fit the motion picture well, I decided to buy it.  The first few times of listening to it after I had bought it I had no idea what I had been thinking, but the more and more I heard a few of the songs, the more in love I fell with them.      Unless you are sure that you enjoy most of the songs, or you have an alternative or abstract taste in music I would recommend not purchasing the soundtrack.  It's unfortunate that all the songs can not be sold separately, because it's not worth it to spend 8.99 on  an album that contains only 2-3 songs that you find enjoyable.
B002VECMAY|5.0|As someone who has both laid off staff and a year later, became the victim of a layoff after twelve years with the same company, I had a personal interest in seeing how director/co-screenwriter Jason Reitman ([[ASIN:B000H0MKOC Thank You for Smoking]], [[ASIN:B0014CQNTK Juno]]) was going to adapt Walter Kirn's smart, unsettling 2001 novel. Even though eight years have elapsed since the book's publication, the filmmaker - along with co-writer Sheldon Turner - manages to deepen Kirn's themes in this wry, emotionally resonant 2009 dramedy and make them even more relevant with the pervasive downsizing of corporate America. The movie also manages to surprise even when certain plot turns seem evident before they occur. Initially, there is a veneer of cynicism that makes you think the story will be an abject lesson in the impermanence of life, but instead, it evolves into one man's journey into the heart of the emotional turbulence he had been careful to avoid. Toward that end, Reitman seems to be inspired by Alexander Payne's equally perceptive road movies, [[ASIN:B00005JLSK About Schmidt]] and [[ASIN:B0007TKOAA Sideways]], films that reflect a similar storytelling style.<br /><br />The plot focuses on laser-sharp corporate layoff consultant Ryan Bingham, a man who regales in the impermanence of life by traveling 322 days on the road, informing targeted employees that they are about to lose their jobs. There is a necessary callousness in his approach, but he knows it's necessary to be present and honest when it comes to conveying the unpleasant news. Bingham is also a motivational speaker who espouses unburdening one's life of possessions and fitting everything essential within the confines of a backpack. Proving his case, he lives in hotels, airplanes, and airport terminals with his one life goal being the seventh person to collect ten million frequent-flier miles. If you can get past the Spartan one-bedroom apartment he keeps in Omaha for the 43 days he is forced to be at home, the hatchet man appears to lead a charmed if rather solitary life. Complications, however, ensue on both personal and professional fronts.<br /><br />Bingham meets a fellow transient traveler named Alex Goran in an airport lounge and assesses that he may have found his soul-mate, so much so that he invites her to come to his estranged sister's wedding in Wisconsin. Meanwhile, Bingham's boss wants to introduce a new strategy proposed by a fresh-faced, post-grad school upstart. New hire Natalie Keener suggests using remote teleconferencing to perform the layoff notifications. Since the new technology is the antithesis of Bingham's one-on-one method, he brings Natalie along on the road to show her how it can't possibly work. In a role that feels custom-tailored to all his strengths, George Clooney plays Bingham with an emotional precision that complements his charismatic persona which pivots between swaggering and self-effacing. On one hand, it's his most definitive movie-star role, and yet Clooney has never revealed as much about himself onscreen.<br /><br />The always watchable Vera Farmiga ([[ASIN:B000M341QE The Departed]], [[ASIN:B000I0QL7I Down to the Bone]]) is sexy and confident as the woman who seems perfect for Bingham, even though their adroit compatibility could not possibly sustain an actual commitment. Their interplay is fun to watch because there is a Cary Grant-Rosalind Russell-level rapport that keeps both on their toes. Anna Kendrick ([[ASIN:B001P5HRMI Twilight]]) is winning as Natalie even if her character's naivet&eacute; feels a bit manufactured at times. Jason Bateman has a field day playing Bingham's smarmy boss, while Amy Morton, Melanie Lynskey, and Danny McBride ([[ASIN:B001J9KJ4I Pineapple Express]]) plays their accustomed types with aplomb as members of Bingham's immediate family. In cameos, J.K. Simmons ([[ASIN:B000YABYLA Juno]]) and Zach Galifianakis ([[ASIN:B001UV4XEM The Hangover]]) sharply play two of the victimized employees, but for the rest, Reitman uses non-actors replaying their recent experiences of getting laid off. As usual with Reitman's films, it boasts an eclectic soundtrack that works really well with the storyline.non-actors replaying their recent experiences of getting laid off.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|I must admit to being a little skeptical when I heard that someone was going to try to revisit the original crew of the Enterprise; however, those worries were set to rest when I saw the initial trailer.  The actual film was great and something to be enjoyed by old fans as well as new ones.  The story was great, the pace was well-timed, the acting was awesome, and the special effects were simply amazing.  Since I purchased it, I have already watched it five or six times over and it keeps getting better!

B000MCIBB6|4.0|Since my youth I have had an ear for American (and other roots music), whether I was conscious of that fact or not. The origin of that interest first centered on the blues, then early rock and roll and later, with the folk revival of the early 1960's, folk music. I have often wondered about the source of this interest. I am, and have always been a city boy, and an Eastern city boy at that. Nevertheless, over time I have come to appreciate many more forms of roots music than in my youth. The subject of the following review is an example.    The Doors are roots music? Yes, in the sense that one of the branches of rock and roll derives from early rhythm and blues and in the special case of Jim Morrison, leader of the Doors, the attempt to musically explore the shamanic elements in the Western American Native American culture. Some of that influence is apparent here.     More than one rock critic has argued that at their best the Doors were the best rock and roll band ever created. Those critics will get no argument here. What a reviewer with that opinion has to do is determine whether any particular CD captures the Doors at their best. This reviewer advises that if you want to buy only one Doors CD that would be The Best of the Doors. If you want to trace their evolution other CD's, like this \\"Waiting For The Sun\\" album do an adequate job. Stick outs here include: the anti-war classic \\"The Unknown Soldier,\\" \\"Love Street,\\" and \\"Spanish Caravan\\".

B002XTBE8I|5.0|For anyone who may have bought the original release of the album I wouldn't suggest buying this only for the extra tracks unless you're just a die hard fan then of course that's fine. I would just buy them from the amazon mp3 store and save yourself some money. I did buy the CD album itself only because I hadn't originally bought the first album so this re-release was perfect for me. I had heard the original album before and loved it which is why I really wanted to buy it when he released it again with more on it. The new tracks I haven't been able to listen to much in depth but on a quick listen through they sounds pretty good to me. In my opinion this is definitely one of his darkest albums in terms of what the songs are about and things like that, but it's still a great album just like all the ones before. Like I said, it's a good buy if you havent bought the album already and now want it with the bonus tracks, or if you're a serious fan/collector. Otherwise I would save some money and just buy the mp3s from the amazon music store.

0451216725|2.0|I've found Ken Follett's books to be \\"hit or miss\\", with this one in the \\"miss\\" category.      This book comes across as more mass market trash than any of his other works, and his research was shoddy at best.      The whole basis of the book was that the Russians were spying on the American Rocket program, which is a bit hard to fathom, as the Russians were far ahead of the Americans at that time.  Korolyov and his team had developed the R5 and R7 by that time and didn't need Von Braun's help.    His explanation of the Buzz Bomb is laughable.      Overall, not one of his best.  I suggest you try \\"Lie down with Lions\\" or perhaps \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\".
0385532458|5.0|Short fiction is just about dead, alas.  Few mainstream magazines publish it--in fact, I can't think of any.  But here we find seven examples of long short stories, if I may be allowed the oxymoron, all set in small town Mississippi.  I'd be hard pressed to say which tale I liked best.  The characters are not of the country club variety.  There are the three buffoons who set out for Memphis to give blood to an ailing acquaintance and meet with misfortune, owing to their ignorance.  There is a couple who set out for a prison to retrieve the body of an executed murderer.  These are but two examples.  The characters and stories are wholly unlike anything I've read in recent years.  The only resemblance is to the short fiction of Erskine Caldwell from decades past.  The book restores some of my admiration for John Grisham.  He has written some fine books (e.g., \\"A Time to Kill\\"), but he has also given us some utter nonsense (e.g., \\"Playing for Pizza\\").  Too many of his books have been no better than so-so, but he is redeemed by \\"Ford County.\\"

This changed my focus after reading the first two chapters from spending so much time dealing with weaknesses and focus on stregths instead.  I had to apply some thought to the approach mentioned in this book, but after finishing the book, I agree with its coonclusions.     I highly recommend this book for anyone who has to manage people on a daily basis.
B002G1K82Q|5.0|There have been several movies that have tried to make the music of The Beatles a central focus of their reason d'existence. Some - like The Beatles' own [[ASIN:B0000542D2 A Hard Day's Night]] and [[ASIN:B00000JRUQ Yellow Submarine]] - are perfect, some are not (the dismal \\"All This and World War Too\\"). Even the camp classic [[ASIN:B00009APB6 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] was so bad it was worth seeing because of the music. Heck, even the forgettable [[ASIN:B00005TT77 I Am Sam]] raked in a killer soundtrack thanks to John, Paul, George and Ringo.<br /><br />But they've got nothing on \\"Across The Universe.\\" Taking the turmoil and tumult of the sixties and re-imagining it through the lyrics of Beatle's songs, it is a trippy, hallucinogenic ride that is a visual and sonic feast. Jude (from Liverpool, naturally) comes to the US to find his American soldier dad (Robert Clohessy, a regular from [[ASIN:B00031TYBC Oz - The HBO prison drama]]) only to collide with rich kid renegade Max and then to fall for his sister, Lucy. Suddenly, they find themselves in NYC with a Janis Joplinish landlady, Sadie, and her Jimi Hendrixian boyfriend, Jojo.<br /><br />The sixties then take their turn into the war, and the drama unfolds as Jude falls for Lucy (\\"I've Just Seen a Face\\"), Max finds himself drafted (\\"I Want You\\") and Lucy falls under the spell of the anti-war movement leader. Each point is often brilliantly illustrated, and director Julie Taymor tosses subtlety out the window for several of the film's best sequences. In particular, when Prudence sings \\"I Want To Hold Your Hand\\" as a lament for a love that can't speak out loud, football players fly through the air and collide as she walks through them. When Max gets to his indoctrination and the exaggerated GI Joes march in \\"stomp dance\\" style to \\"I Want You,\\" it's breathtaking. While the narrative occasionally falters, the visuals and set pieces never do.<br /><br />Of course, there is the music. While there's nothing earth-shattering here, all the actors acquit themselves just fine. The small handful of cameos are great, especially Joe Cocker singing \\"Come Together\\" as three different characters, and Bono playing the Ken Keasey Electric Kool-Aid guru Dr Robert on the magic bus, promoting his new book titled (heh heh) \\"I Am The Walrus.\\" (I could have done without Eddie Izzard's \\"Being for The Benefit of Mr Kite,\\" even if the sequence is sufficiently madcap.) But this isn't a sloppy kaleidoscope like the [[ASIN:B0000067L8 Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band 1978 Soundtrack]] was; other than the three men mentioned prior, there are no stars here. In particular, Sadie (Dana Fuchs) and Jojo (Martin Luther McCoy) give dynamite performances, and other than Evan Rachel Wood, the cast is relatively unknown.<br /><br />I really can't say enough about the pleasure I got from \\"[[ASIN:B000WCBPOG Across The Universe]], and it may be the first time you walk into a theater humming the songs. I was skeptical at first, because many of the reviews I'd read were not kind. But I have a feeling many of them were written by folks of a more tender age, lacking the comprehension of the times portrayed on screen. One of the most fun things about this movie was catching the goofy Beatles' homages sprinkled in the film's dialog (favorite, when Prudence sneaks into the Sadie's communal apartment and someone asked where she comes from, Jude replies \\"she came in through the bathroom window\\").<br /><br />This is also a recommendable movie for one other reason. It isn't. When I say 'it isn't,' I mean, not a sequel, not a rip-off of a TV series (old or new), not a remake and some lowbrow teen sex-romp. There isn't anything cloying or coy, and while the movie is certainly political, the politics you get from it will be what you read out on your own. \\"Across The Universe\\" is as relevant today as it was when when The Beatles sang \\"But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao, you ain't gonna make it with anyoneanyhow.\\" Grab your popcorn, sit back, relax and float downstream.relax and float downstream.
B002P5XXR0|5.0|Easily one of the most anticipated scores to come this year amongst some big contenders. James Horner has worked his ass off for years to make a great score for James Cameron's epic sci-fi movie about the Na'Vi world and the (mostly) evil humans and their avatar characters. It has been hyped up by just about everyone and it's supposed to be an epic orchestral score of massive proportions. First I got hold of part of a cue from Avatar, then 1 minute previews of all the tracks on the score. We can't wait any longer! James Horner is back ladies and gentleman so sit back and enjoy the ride.<br /><br />Every single time James Horner releases new work, the same criticism and discussions arise about him re-using his stuff. It never fails, and it used to be amusing, but now I just find it annoying. If the music is good, then it's good, it's not rocket science folks. If the music is bad (and it happens, even for Horner), then fair enough, but don't say you hate it because he uses the 4 note danger motif or any other strange reason to hate him. Another funny thing I've read on forums is that some people get disappointed because he spent so long on this. What has that got to do with anything? The fact is, James Horner is king when it comes to fusing what's going on in the movie with a great piece of emotional music. There's simply no one better at it today, and I stand by that remark.<br /><br />As for the score  itself, after we all heard the various previews and some got excited, some didn't. I firmly place myself in the excitement camp. I admit, I have put Avatar on a pedestal, expecting James Horner to shine more than he has ever done before. This of course leads to extremely high expectations and Horner almost succeeds in meeting them. The first part of the score is much more calm than the second part. There's some jungle rhythms in there and there's also the use of ethnic vocals. Now clearly, if you don't like either of these things, this one will be hard to truly enjoy. The main theme heard in a number of cues is not Horner's greatest work, but it does work in the movie itself. The movie has gotten great reviews and several have commented on how great the score works in the movie. Those who know James Horner, weren't surprised by this as it is his main strength.<br /><br />According to other sources, this score was supposed to be hugely epic and orchestral. Is it? Yes... to a degree. There's certainly traces of electronica in cues like The Bioluminescence of the Night, but it's hardly the main thing here. Voices are a big part of the score, to the innocent boy chanting along in the beginning of Becoming One of \\"The People\\" Becoming One With Neytiri'. It really works great. More vocals in Climbing Up \\"Iknimaya - The Path to Heaven\\". It's a beautiful cue mostly based on a choir singing with hypnotic jungle percussion in the background. The fact that it sounds like Glory, makes it even better in my mind.<br /><br />You can't have a Horner score without the hated Rachmaninoff 4-note motif of doom of course, and yes it is here as well. Stay away from the cue The Destruction of Hometree if you hate it, because it will be repeated without remorse at the end. Personally I have no problem with it. It was brilliant when Rachmaninoff wrote it, and just because Horner uses it, doesn't make it less brilliant. It propels the action and when you see it on screen within the context of the movie, you'll love Horner for it.<br /><br />James Horner loves to make those long cues, and I love him for that. It seems like him and Hans Zimmer are the ones consistently doing it. The last cue War is a wonderfully epic and choral ending cue. It is 11 minutes and 22 seconds long , and every second of it is great. One of the best action cues this year for sure. It sounds like a trailer song to be honest, starting with a violent epic choral section that represents the humans with their war machines. At 0:50 it changes to a more soft, but still epic theme with horns and some choral bits as well to represent the Na'Vi heroes. It changes back and forth as the humans and the Na'Vi advance. The humans have an evil sound, which almost reminds me of the Nero cues from Star Trek by Michael Giacchino. It's beautifully put together with the epic scenes that unfold as machine meets nature in one of the most epic battles ever produced on screen. The Na'Vi sections of the cue are heroic in nature with horns, making it a perfect representation of the good guys. This cue is war, and it never lets go of you until the very end, where war finally ends. It is one of those cues that makes you go \\"wow!\\" every single time you play it. Pure gold from Horner and I wouldn't be far off the mark if I say that this cue is one of the best cues he has ever made.<br /><br />There isn't much negative to say about this score, unless you get stuck counting the Horner-isms and similarities with other work by certain composers. I just listen to this score as music, and music can be interpreted in many ways. For example, the opening cue You Don't Dream In Cryo... is clearly lifted from Trevor Rabin's play book which you can clearly hear from 1:40 to  2:32. At first listen, you might think that it sounds like a Hans Zimmer or a Remote Control Productions score, but that feeling goes away after the second listen, at least it did for me. It's James Horner all the way for better or worse.<br />Conclusion<br /><br />I could probably say a lot more about this score and James Horner and I'll say this much. James Cameron has got the perfect score for Avatar, even though the score itself is not perfect. James Horner has spent over a year making this, but that doesn't matter in the end. Hans Zimmer created Lion King in about 3 weeks, so it can work for you or against you, when you spend a lot of time on something. In this case, this is his best score since Beyond Borders in 2003. I wanted to give this a 10, but it's not a 10 score overall due the following: The main theme doesn't do it for me. I love James Horner's themes, and the theme in Avatar is quite good, but I was expecting a lot more. The year is coming to an end and I feel this is one of the best scores this year. People are whispering about Oscars due to the immense success of the movie. Who knows? I would personally be surprised to see Horner's name when the nominations are released. Oscar-worthy or not, it's a solid score worthy of the praise the movie has gotten so far.resent the Na'Vi heroes. It changes back and forth as the humans and the Na'Vi advance.

014118261X|5.0|Finishing this set of novels is like losing a friend. The Long Goodbye also was Chandler's goodbye to his readers. Raymond Chandler only wrote six novels, excluding the controversial postscript Playback, and the other three (The High Window, The Lady in the Lake, and The Little Sister) are best read first. Few will dispute that Chandler was a genius. His work oozes atmosphere. It is packed with witty, imperishable dialogue. The characterisation is strong, and what stereotyping it contains only serves to make it more picturesque. For the universe Chandler created, lodged in 1930s and 40s Los Angeles and ranging from sleazy back alleys to beautiful people's mansions, is one from which we only wrench ourselves with regret.     Hinting at these three novels' storylines would be useless. If this is classified as crime fiction, the plots, somewhat implausible (especially of the last two novels), serve as an excuse for painting a world of danger and corruption into which, in the author's own words, `a man must go who is not himself mean, who is neither tarnished nor afraid'. That man is Philip Marlowe, the protagonist of all of Chandler's novels, immortalised by Bogart in the movie adaptation of The Big Sleep. One reason Chandler wrote so little is that he came to writing late in life, publishing his first short story at age forty-five. Chandler fought in the First World War and led a tortured life, no doubt influencing his dark, sarcastic style. But with numerous stories and film scripts to his record, he was also, alongside Dashiell Hammett, a leading figure of what soon became known as the `noir' genre. Chandler's views on detective fiction, and on writing in general, are presented in his succinct The Simple Art of Murder, available online and well worth looking up.

B002HWRYJE|5.0|I'm old enough to have watched the original TV series in the 60s (on our first color TV). I thoroughly enjoyed this re-take on the original using the same main characters.    I have to admit I didn't quite follow the logic behind the new story line until I watched the movie for the second time on DVD, but once I plugged in to the fact that the elder Spock's time trip took us into an alternate reality with the same characters, I bought in wholeheartedly. (Ahhh, it all makes sense now...)    I had no serious complaints about the new characterizations; in fact, knowing the history of the original Trek made it more fun to see how the new story line gave a new take on them. Ben Cross was excellent as Sarek (\\"I married your mother...because I loved her\\" made a lot more sense than \\"it seemed logical\\", as spoken in the original), as was Zachary Quinto as Spock; and seeing Spock's ongoing struggle to suppress his natural emotions, especially with a love interest, seemed much more realistic than the original.    Simon (Run Fat Boy Run) Pegg and John (Harold and Kumar Go To/Escape From...) Cho as Scotty and Sulu were just plain fun to watch. But in my view, the big prize goes to Karl Urban as Dr. McCoy. More than any other actor in the new Trek, I felt he captured the essence of Bones without being a caricature of DeForest Kelly. He even managed to change his appearance to the point where he didn't even look like the same guy I've seen in several other movies.    This is one of those movies that you appreciate more every time you watch it, because there alway seem to be more details you notice each time.

1416594787|4.0|Richard Dawkins asks creationists, why are there no flatworm fossils? None at all if creationism is true. He asks, would they state that flatworms just popped up into existence today? No, of course they know that flatworms have existed (at least to them) for at least thousands of years. His point of this question, is that some species we know have existed for more then a day or a week don't make good fossils (such as flatworms) and so we don't have any or few fossils of them. That is why before the Cambrian era we see less fossils because the species that were alive then, because they were harder to fossilize then more modern animals.  At most there are a few traces in the earth that suggest a flatworm.     Dr. Dawkins mentions also that between any species such as homo erectus and homo sapien there is a flow of evolutionary rate. An anaology is that when is a man old and not middle age? Does he wake up one day old and last night was middle age? No, of course not, it is a contimum where you get older and older until the point is that you can't identify as middle age anymore. One day is too arbitary to make such a designation and there is virtually no change physically in age from one day to another. The same thing with species, there is evolution even within a species. Homo erectus evolved to a different gene pool over tens of thousands of years even while still homo erectus.  We are evolving right now, in terms that the collective human genome pool is changing. It is just at a rate that isn't much noticeable to our eyes. So in reality, every species is a transitional form because no species is static in its' collective DNA.     Dr. Dawkins explains radioactive dating and how radioactive dates are set such as when a crystal forms, by measuring its' half life.  For example one can measure the ratio of potassium-40 vs. argon-40 and find the age of granite or basalt by the fact that it takes 1.26 billion years for 1/2 of potassium-40 to change into argon-40. Then another 1.26 billion years to change the remaining half of potassium-40 into argon-40. So on and so on onto no remaining potassium-40 is left. When the crystal formed there was no argon-40 so it is a very accurate clock.    Dr. Dawkins also explains how the continents have moved and how the fact that this has dramatically effected the species that exist and where they exist, around the world today. For example, only in Madagascar are lemur primates native. Now, if evolution isn't true why would they only be found there? If they got off a big boat 5000 years ago, called Noah's Ark, wouldn't they be random througout the world? Did he tell them to all go to this island off the coast of Africa? How did they get to that island anyway? Africa would still be seperate from Madagascar even after the supposed flood. Did they build a raft? Did the kangaroos of Australia build a raft to Australia and go nowhere else? The fact that continents and big islands like Madagascar have moved show that species become seperate when these movements occur and that they lead to a group isolated from closely related species evolving. An analogy would be English settlers coming to America and the evolution of the American type accents from the British over the course of a few centuries. After isolation or relative isolation then accents and so species evolve or change to some degree from they come from.     Dr. Dawkins writes about how if you take a rubber sheet and draw a chimpanzee skull or a baboon skull on it that it can be stretched or retracted to show a modern human skull. Or, take a human skull and make a chimpanzee skull. Or take a lobster  and make a much different species of lobster. The point is, that the physical features of different species are only a matter of degree. One species might have a bigger forehead, or wider nose and that those differences built up over time and change in DNA between the species lead to our physical differences. Dr. Dawkins also asks why are there no feather on any non-birds? Why would a deity or designer limit himself in that way? Or, why don't any reptiles produce milk like mammals? Why would a deity limit himself in such a way? The answer of course is that only mammals produce milk is because mammals have a common mammalian ancestor that developed the ability to give milk to its' young. The reason only birds have feathers is that there was a common bird ancestor that had feathers. Both these features increased the odds of survival for individuals that had these traits, or natural selection in action.    Dawkins asks why does the laryngeal nerve in a giraffe does not go straight to the larynx but make a weird circular route around the heart of the giraffe. In fact, it is not just giraffes that this happens but in all mammals. Why would a deity create such an inefficent design? The reason of course, is that just like many of the \\"unintelligently designed\\" physical features of not only humans but other animals, they were a product of non-planned traits  that have evolved.    Dr. Dawkins covers the 2nd law of thermodynamics (he is a jack of all sciences and just not biology) which to sum it up in layman's terms states that an external energy source is needed or organization breaks down. For example without an energy source life couldn't develop. Creationists say this creates the need of a deity. The problem with this, is that it seems they have never noticed that big round yellow ball in the sky that we call the sun. The earth isn't a closed system because we have the external energy source of the sun which supplies energy for plants to grow which animals then eat.     Lastly, if evolution isn't true then why are there no homo erectus found with dinosaur bones? Why no 500 million year old amphibilians found with mammoths? The reason is because the fossil record is laid down when those species existed so it is expected they won't be random.    I don't expect this book to convince hard core creationists. A deity himself coming down and telling them evolution isn't true wouldn't convince them, but I believe for those on the fence or not sure of evolution it will convince them that yes, evolution is true and it isn't the work of \\"evil atheist\\" scientists.
B002VPE1AM|3.0|No question, the digital effects and CG-landscapes, creatures, and effects are truly amazing.  But unfortunately, as a result, the whole film comes off as an extremely hi-tech, brilliantly conceived, lavishly produced --- cartoon.  The few gritty (and thus realistic) scenes inside the ship, where we can see real people, are a welcome relief from the mind-numbing (and, as a result, patently artificial) jungle/planet scenes that pervade this film.  I found it hard to empathize with the Na'vi and their plight (despite the frequent pathetic squeals of outrage and sorrow vocalized by many of them), because I felt like I'd be weeping tears for Simba or Nala in The Lion King -- they were digitized fantasy-creatures, not a real race of people, with real feelings and real lives.  I believe that the whole thing would have come across tremendously more effectively had they employed real actors (in blue costumes and makeup, if you like), instead of CG-created fantasy-people.  I don't mean to sound callous here -- it just left me a little distanced, and as such, emotionally uninvolved.  But I have to say, the ducted-fan gunships were VERY cool...
B002NOAF9W|1.0|When I saw the review of this item on the CBS Sunday Morning Show yesterday, I got all hot and bothered. In 2002 I purchased the redone version of this CD in the paper gatefold holder. When I heard that there were 3 CDs, I logically thought, one CD would be the Rolling Stones concert with all the extra songs included, and in correct running order. Then one whole CD of B.B. Kings set, and the last CD would be the whole Ike and Tina Review set. Then as for the DVD, (wishfully thinking), the whole Stones show captured on film, plus footage of B.B. and Ike and Tina also. After reading some reviews all I can say is, it would be better to pass on this item and purchase the documentary GIMMIE SHELTER on Criterion instead, or try and track down some boots(Brusells Affair 73****, or the DVD of LADIES AND GENTLEMAN THE ROLLING STONES from 72 tour****), or wait a while for the price to drop to about half. It`s kind of obvious that these guys don`t want to look backwards. We`ll probably never see any outtake sets or even any BBC material from this band, like the Beatles gave to their fans (both outtakes and BBC material). They will probably never release the 1972 US tour film called Ladies And Gentleman The Rolling Stones,  with a soundtrack also, (in 72 and 73 shows Mick Taylor was pushing his playing much more than the 69 shows, especally on Gimmie Shelter, which for some reason or other is NOT included along with the extra tracks, I`m pretty sure they would not leave New York without playing it. They did play it on November 9 in Oakland, Ca.) If somebody was real smart they should get it together and release the King Biscut Flower Hour Shows recorded in Europe in 73. Its a shame that nobody in this band or on their payroll wants to sit down and go through their archives (especially the Mick Taylor years), the way Jimmy Page did and George Martin did. They make a lot more touring, and they have way more than any person can spend in a lifetime. Since for most ordinary people money is very tight right now, so I would say pass on this ripoff and stick to the single disc which I`m sure you all have already.

B001OQCV9M|3.0|I enjoyed this movie and really liked the part that focused on Julia and Paul Child in Paris.  The Julie Powell part wasn't as interesting to me, but then, I am older and have been watching Julia Child on PBS since I was a little girl.  Conversely, my 30 year old daughter seemed to fully identify with the modern New York part of the story, and so I guess my age has something to do with my greater interest in the older characters.<br /><br />I love to cook and this movie inspired me to get Julia Child's book and try some of her techniques.  I actually boned a duck! :D  Although I am not ambitious enough to cook every recipe, I think it will enrich my own repertoire of dishes.  I am now looking for a video of Julia Child's PBS series and can't wait to try some of her recipes.<br /><br />I gave it only three stars because of two issues:  (1) The Julia Powell part wasn't very interesting, and (2) the political commentary was trite and wearing.  Several of the reviewers were offended at the political slant of the movie.  I agree that there was some political bias and it got a little preachy, but I wasn't shocked.  I had already read Julia Child's biography and was aware that she and her husband were liberals who were at odds with Julia's super conservative parents.  Even though I didn't agree with the Childs' political views, I considered the movie to be accurate to the extent that the tension was real, and the incidents described actually did happen.  In addition, the author and screenwriter are liberals, so one must expect some of this type of thing to come through.  I just let it roll off my back and enjoyed the sweet love story of Julia and Paul Child; and of course, all the yummy food!

I avoided the AP Lit classes during my 50/60's high school days for the same reason.  Those who took those classes hate literature and reading and write poorly...Not so for me.

B002ONC9MS|3.0|\\"An Education,\\" directed by Lone Scherfig from a screenplay by Nick Hornby, takes place in London in the early sixties.  Jenny Mellor, played by Carey Mulligan, is a bright, middle-class high school girl whose goal is to read English at Oxford University.  Although Jenny's father, Jack (Alfred Molina), loves his only child, he is an excitable and bombastic individual who constantly reminds his family how much everything costs.  Jack's wife, Marjorie, calmly looks on while her husband rants and raves.  Jenny appears to have a bright future ahead of her.  She studies Latin, is well-versed in literature, plays the cello, speaks French, and dreams of leaving Twickenham, the London suburb where her family resides.<br /><br />One rainy day, Jenny is offered a ride by David Goldman (Peter Sarsgaard), a handsome man in his thirties.  He soon asks her out and charms her parents so thoroughly that they permit her to spend time with him.  He buys Jenny new clothes, takes her to night clubs and concerts, and even whisks her off to Paris with his sophisticated cronies.  Jenny is so enamored of David and is having so much fun that she puts her studies and her ambitions for a college education on hold.<br /><br />This film may be viewed as a coming-of-age story, but it is really less than that.  It is a depressing tale of how a worldly man takes advantage of a naïve and easily dazzled teenager.  Although all the actors turn in competent performances, the film ultimately falls flat.  It is unthinkable that Jenny's bourgeois parents would let their daughter gallivant around with a man whom they barely know.  Nor is it plausible that a bright girl like Jenny would be so foolish as to believe that she could have a future with a man more than twice her age.<br /><br />Emma Thompson has a thankless role as Jenny's prissy and prejudiced headmistress, and Rosamund Pike is Helen, David's brainless and glamorous friend, who teaches Jenny how to dress fashionably and apply makeup.  Olivia Williams plays Miss Stubbs, Jenny's stern English teacher, and she is one of the film's few bright spots.  Miss Stubbs genuinely wants what is best for her prize pupil and is aghast to learn that this promising young lady may be about to throw away her future.  Although Sarsgaard gives David an occasional bit of shading, his character is basically a sleaze.  It is cringe-inducing to watch him beguile the inexperienced Jenny, who learns the hard way that there are no short-cuts to becoming an adult.ss Stubbs, Jenny's stern English teacher, and she is one of the film's few bright spots.

B002W6Z0UK|5.0|This EP is an achievement of GaGa's work !     Bad Romance, Alejandro, Monster, Speechless, Telephone and Teeth are just perfect !  The 2 others are great though !    This is very encouraging for her forthcoming album !
0385751060|4.0|Initially, young Bruno, the protagonist, comes off as being quite an innocent youngster.  However, after delving deeper into this story, his innocence and naivete became irritating to me.  By the middle of the story I was quite aggravated with the author's character development style and his protagonist's...gullibility? simplicity? - to the point of wondering if it wasn't more the author than Bruno who was excessively innocent and naive.  Young Bruno had, in my opinion, moved beyond innocence and naivete to being just an idiot of a kid.  However, the excessive innocence comes to terms successfully in the end, playing a vital, important and necessary component in the final chapters.<br /><br />Within this story there are certainly more points for pondering, reflection and learning than just the innocence of this child and how that played against him - as one should expect in any story set against the Holocaust.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|What a wonderful story!It makes you smile just thinking about the love that grows between the characters. Our favorite character is Doug (Dug)!!!!
B000M341QE|4.0|Undoubtedly a tough, gritty good guy/bad guy movie with a very good storyline.  The cast of big name actors bring home an entertaining thriller that kept this viewer engrossed in the story without let-up through the entire length of the film.  However, viewers should be aware the movie contains pervasive profanity.  Those unwilling or unable to stomach such talk would do better to go with something more tame.  With the language and the violence, the movie is better viewed when the little ones are not around.
0525478183|5.0|Quentin loved Margo Roth Spiegelman. Nobody ever really knew Margo and Quentin was no exception. They were friends as kids but as they grew up they managed to grow apart despite still being neighbors. One night Margo climbs in through his bedroom window and reenters his life. They pull an all-nighter filled with payback and cross town adventures. But too soon the morning comes and they go back to their respective homes. Quentin manages to drag himself to school and is only a little surprised Margo is not there. As the days keep coming however and there is still no sign of Margo, Quentin wonders if maybe there is some way he can find her. He thinks that for some reason she wants him to find her. With the help of his friends Quentin embarks on a discovery mission of Margo Roth Spiegelman.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed this book. John Green knows Laugh Out Loud funny. This book kept me on edge almost throughout. I could never really predict how one clue could lead us to the next and maybe eventually to Margo. John Green pegs teen geek voices perfectly and how in a small boring town you really have to make the most out of any situation you can. It seemed weird to me how much Quentin worshiped Margo, even after years of not knowing her. I can see how that is possible though, because that person would still be the same in your mind as how you last remember them being. Paper Towns also includes the Best Insult EVER!<br />\\"She may be hot, but she is also 1. aggressively vapid, and 2. an absolute, unadulterated, raging bitch.\\" See what I mean, classic.<br />This is a must read for all who enjoy this genre. It's funny, suspenseful and realistic; all things a great novel should be (unless it's fantasy). John Green has a new fan on his hands and I look forward to reading some of his older books and waiting for his newer ones to come find me. I do have one question, can you use the word accompli without anything before it, like fait?<br /><br />First Line:<br />\\"The way I figure it, everyone gets a miracle.\\"<br /><br />Favorite Line:<br />\\"I didn't want to leave Margo alone with the dead guy who might be an attack zombie, but I also didn't care to stand around and chat about the circumstances of his demise.\\"le.\\"    Favorite Line:  \\"I didn't want to leave Margo alone with the dead guy who might be an attack zombie, but I also didn't care to stand around and chat about the circumstances of his demise.\\"
0385341008|5.0|This is a tremendous read. The book is written as a series of letters which simply entices you to keep going.  You will not be disappointed with this read.
B000EHSVS2|5.0|This is the role that George C. Scott was born to fill. He portrays Patton as a very complex general, born perhaps out of time. Some of the most haunting scenes are when Patton reflects on his role in the battles against our enemies during the Second World War. How his destiny and a sense of deja vu overcomes him as he hears muted battle trumpets coming from afar. He feels that he was here before, long before.  A telling, sober tale of a great American hero, born of a time and for a  great role in our nation's history.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This is one of the blockbuster movies of 2009. As another reviewer put it - this is a reboot of the Star Trek franchise. Stunning CGI visuals and great sound make this a showcase Blu ray disc. But this is not just an empty, blockbuster film. It has a good story to tell, with a well developed plot and excellent performances from new-comers Chris Pine and Zachary Quinto. Having Leonard Nimoy on hand as a link to the classic series is icing on the cake. Completely enjoyable for Star Trek and Sci-Fi fans, or anyone who enjoys a great movie experience!
1563890119|5.0|I loved this work. It is dripping in symbolism and allusions to other famous literature, both classical and modern (DC comics). The plot presents a very straightforward mission, in which the main character comes in contact with several other familiar personifications. There is so much creativity in this work, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the series.
B002Q4U9YU|5.0|I purchased the Michael Jackson's Music CD \\" This is IT\\" because I wanted something to remember the \\"King Of Pop!\\" This album does not disappoint and the music is \\"Right ON!\\" Rest in Peace MJ and may his music LIVE ON!!!
B002LK3DUQ|4.0|A very enjoyable movie.  You had to feel the character played by Ed Asner (Mr. Frederickson), not only for his determination, but for his sentimental reasons of reaching his destination via his promise with his wife.  There many additions to the movie for those who kind of steal the scene(s) from the main character--Dug the dog and Russell, who belongs to a Boy Scout-type troup.  Like I said, a very enjoyable movie.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|John Mayer has spent the latter half of the `00s wining and dining Hollywood's leading ladies; still, I was surprised when he mentioned that the subject matter for his newest album Battle Studies would have more of a bluesy feel simply because, well, unless I'm mistaken, HE'S the one that ended the relationships. Well, since John is one of my favorite artists, I didn't hesitate to pick up the album.<br /><br />Because of the subject matter, I envisioned this album to maybe turn out to be a studio companion to [[ASIN:B000BJS4SU Try]], but as it turns out, the songs aren't really like that. Most of them ARE about bad relationships, but they're about fixing and avoiding them, not necessarily the aftermath of them. And John does a good job of crafting such songs, like \\"Edge of Desire\\", \\"War of My Life\\" and the Taylor Swift duet, \\"Half of My Heart\\". There's also a nice cover of Robert Johnson's \\"Crossroads\\" on here (no, Clapton fans, Cream did NOT make it first -- speaking of that, I think another reviewer's comparing John to Clapton is going a little too far).<br /><br />The only concern I have is that \\"Do You Know Me\\" is too short. And I'm not necessarily talking about the length because some songs do work well with only two verses, but I think the song really would have been better had it included a third verse (listen to it to understand what I mean). But it's not a bad song, and neither is anything else on here. Battle Studies is John Mayer's best album yet, so pick it up and get educated.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
0786868724|4.0|I have read just about all of Mitch's books and I find them all very easy  to read. His writing ability just seems to flow right along with your comprehension.  Good book.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I just picked this up at Best Buy for 226 dollars plus tax and am elated with my purchase!!  I read the reviews/comments here and got quite an itch to buy this thing.  I plugged the usb into my car's Kenwood 7120's usb port to listen to this on the way home.  My Kenwood was only able to read the mp3 files . . . they sounded remarkably better than my AAC Beatles files that I ripped from my remastered cd's . . . remarkably better!!  I ended up taking a very long route home!  Finally home, I plugged the usb into my mac.  It was very easy to navigate through the music, artwork, and video files.  All the \\"gushy\\" reviews on here are accurate.  I have yet to listen to the flac files but would be surprised if they did not impress the heck out of me.  If my BEATLES USB were lost/stolen, I would not hesitate to purchase another . . .
0307408833|4.0|I have noticed many negative comments about the inclusion of spelt-first of all she explains why it is in there, and secondly, some people who can not have gluten/wheat flour can have it. As for the frosting recipe issues- she tells you that substituting other milks for soy milk is fine, which is great, as I am allergic to soy. so I automatically substituted coconut milk and used hemp protein powder-yes you do have to let it set (irksome, as there is no immediate gratifaction and my main reason for only 4 stars)- and it was WICKED! Served it with both the chocolate and vanilla cupcakes at a baby shower and nobody knew they were gluten free and vegan. and as for those complaining about substituting flours for the spelt,I say to you bob's red mills gluten free baking flour mix. If you don't have the time/money to do trial and error that is the best mix I have found on the market, especially at high altitude (over 5k feet). also, coconut oil is the most versitle fat for vegan baking there is- yes it is more expensive than shortening, but it makes for a moist, tender crumb and has the same luxurious mouthfeel that butter has. I agree with all the other reviewers who talk about the pictures inspiring you to bake-everything looks amazing!     1/21/10 UPDATE: just made the peach blackberry cobbler, subbing gf flour for the spelt (becuase i can't do spelt) and it was delicious! also, last week made the apple pie for dinner party (again, subbed spelt flour with gf) and it got raves! so to all who are complaining about duds, i say maybe you should read the recipe through and not think you know what to do. i <3 this cookbook even more now!
0143038419|5.0|I adored this book, I read it in a few days while on vacation.  I think some who have written such negative reviews missed the point, or were not paying close enough attention (which is obvious from some details that they mention which were wrong).  Liz Gilbert takes the readers on her journey to heal after a shattering divorce and a general recognition of the fact that she has worked for years at attaining success in a life that she does not want.  Many of the reviewers here accuse her of being selfish and self-centered for this, but I found the exact opposite to be true.  So many women work for the \\"ideal\\" life of a thirty-something woman, which is often viewed to be a good husband, children, a house in the suburbs, and a stable job.  Not as many people really think about whether or not they actually want this life, and it is immensely sad when a woman settles down and has children just because it seems like that is what she \\"should\\" be doing, rather than it being what she truly wants.  I have witnessed this, and I'm sure many others have as well.  Liz Gilbert realizes that she is no longer compatible with her husband and she dreads the idea of having children.  She realizes this fortunately before having children, which she knows would be a monumental mistake for her, and makes the painful but appropriate decision to leave her husband.  She admits that both she and her husband did many things wrong, but she did not go into any details about how and why their marriage fell apart.  The fact that some reviewers lampoon her for obsessing over what went wrong is simply laughable; I would like to meet the woman who has never obsessed over a broken relationship, at least for a little while.    Of course, divorce is nothing new, nor is the soul-crushing depression that often follows (and despite the judgment cast upon her by many reviewers for the relationship she enters immediately after her marriage falls apart ... umm, have you seriously never rebounded?  Everyone does this, get over yourself).  But, instead of undertaking years of therapy to come to terms with these failures, she creates an opportunity for herself to travel to places she has always dreamed of (one place to which she has already traveled) in order to learn how to experience pleasure, devotion, and balance.  This is not selfish, nor trivial.  So many people, especially women, live their lives in the pursuit of pleasing others: husbands/significant others, children, society.  Taking the time to nurse your own spirit is not selfish, it is a survival strategy for a world that is increasingly focused on individual achievement, rather than nourishing families, friends, and communities.  Only when you feel happy and complete are you most capable of being generous and giving to others.  Liz Gilbert realized that her depression was a burden not only on herself, but also on everyone around her, so she actively set out to heal herself.  The ensuing story is inspiring, uplifting, and certainly not meant to serve as a guideline for how others should lead their lives.  It is more like strong but friendly advice on living a life that is appropriate for you, rather than living how you \\"should\\" based on others' standards.       This book was tremendously helpful to me, and it may be to you too.
B002QEXN2K|4.0|Listened to only the samples as this was a Christmas gift. Sounds like some very good work.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Great movie, even for an original Trekie. I guess since the last time we saw Spock as a character in the franchise, he was alive and working with the Romulins for peace, I guess it made sense to have him as the link to the \\"old\\" characters.  And you can tell that he is playing an \\"old\\" character. Being 50, and working on the \\"old\\" label myself, it was quite nostalgic to have at least one link to TOS.  Too bad that the series didn't pick up on Shatner's version of the Trek universe, by following the story lines that brought him back after his encounter with the Nexus. But even in his story line, he was resurrected as a younger Kirk, and the \\"old\\" Shatner would not have worked. So, I guess that is why they couldn't find a way of writing the character into the \\"young\\" crew version.    Anyway, the movie itself is great and does not dissappoint, and the characters are strong and seem much deeper than those presented in TOS. Its cool to see how and why Kirk has his swagger and Spock, his struggle with his Vulcan/Human heritage.  But the Spock/Uhura romance is just a little over-the-top.  And where is nurse Chapel. You'd think that at least a nod to Majel Barrett and Rodenberry would have been called for.
0786838655|5.0|my son read the entire harry potter series in 2nd grade and it's been hard to come up with series to keep him interested in since! this one seems to fit that so far...he also liked the magyk, but only the first few.  i also heard this was being made into a movie, which is always fun!
0763631205|5.0|We have long loved this book.  I was charged by my family to find a good copy, beautiful and legendary, to replace the hardback collection we picked up used somewhere many years ago.  The old copy was falling apart, kind of sterile.  This new book is beautiful.  The pictures are great.  The text easy on the eyes.  Everything working together to make a special edition to our family and one we hope to continue to read annually.   I succeeded in satisfying the charge given to me.  Great for a gift.
B002T9H2LA|1.0|If your into mindless violence with no real point this is your movie like any of Quentin Tarantino's movies.  If you want a good movie you might want to save your money for a movie like \\"the Hangover\\".  Or heck some porn has a better more engaging plotline.  Movie of the year no way..
B001992NUQ|5.0|I simply loved this movie and has stayed at my #1 movie favorite since I saw it in the theatres.    Smart, witty, well written and directed, acted... I cannot say I found a single flaw in the entire movie.  There are small liberties taken when converting from the book, but nothing that detracted from the story, and in many cases, improved the plot.      ***Bluray Review*** The Bluray just expounds on all of that.  Sound is exceptional, the visuals blow me away.  This is the 4th copy of the movie (1 of them this BluRay), and I'm glad I bought it.
B0015ABRE2|5.0|Very entertaining.  I can't wait for the 4th season to come out on DVD.
B00288KNJU|5.0|This product had excellent quality, they still had the 4 3d pairs of shades in the DVD container, I am definitely happy with it and it got to me timely.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|This wonderfully faithful adaptation of The Snowman, a children's book written by Raymond Briggs, tells the story of a young boy whose snowman that he has created comes to life on the stroke of twelve, midnight. The two become friends, and the snowman explores the boy's house. Later on, the two go on a journey out in the open, from riding a motorcycle through the fields to flying north to meet Father Christmas (aka Kris Kringle). I've always loved reading the original children's book when I was little, and I was in even more awestruck at the animated adaptation. This is about 25 minutes long, and it's gorgeous from beginning to end. There is no dialogue whatsoever, but it shouldn't be a fault because it's the visuals that makes this film so mesmerizing. The animation is breathtaking as it looks exactly like the original illustrations. Oh, and we should never forget the music. The song \\"Walking in the Air\\" is probably made famous because it's used in the second half of this film. The lovely vocals blends in perfectly with the entire \\"flying\\" sequence.<br /><br />How come we never see more films like this one anymore? It's a real shame. Fortunately, we still have The Snowman and many other classics that we can always enjoy watching. This is absolutely timeless and should never be ignored.<br /><br />Grade: A
B0027J4SKA|5.0|This is an amazing CD, the cadence of the voice takes you out of the grain of the day. The sounds are so vibrant that you think you are listening to a voice from another time.
B00192IV0O|4.0|THE E.N.D. (Energy Never Dies)  being BEP's 5th studio album and their 2009 release is a mix of hip-hop, dance-pop, electropop and synthpop. The sound is very different then their previous releases and many reviewers did not like this change. However, a group can not produce the same kind of music constantly since then they do not grow but stunt their own development. \\"Boom Boom Pow\\" is an amazing track and other great tracks are \\"Meet Me Halfway\\" and \\"I Gotta Feeling\\". The album received surprisingly low reviews and Allmusic, Slant and Spinn all gave it between 2.5 and 3/5 which is way too low. To me this is a great dance record and I give it a solid 4. The album did quite well in several countries and reached number one in countries such as Australia, France and New Zealand. 4/5.
B00026WU4G|4.0|Enough with the \\"born again\\" stuff!! You are only \\"born again\\" if you were a Christian and then accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord & savior.  Dylan is quite Jewish and many, many of his lyrics come directly out of the Torah and the Jewish prophetic tradition.    Certainly, Dylan re-creates himself over and over again.  That is what is so incredible about his music and also, at times, so frustrating.    How could a previous Reviewer not know that Neighborhood Bully is about the attdempt of the State of Israel to survive?    The CD is incredible and the guitar work A++
0312370849|5.0|I started reading this book and could not put it down.  It is a sad story about the round up and persecution of the Jews in Paris in 1942.  The author was able to intertwine a present day story of a journalist researching the events, with the specific story of a little girl whose family was sent to a concentration camp.  I found myself caught up in the lives of both characters (present day and historical) and couldn't stop reading to find out how the stories would end.  There are some tragic turns as to be expected with such a heavy topic, but this book makes you rethink what is important in your life and how you treat those who are less fortunate.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle has a voice of an angel and everything she sings comes from her heart. This is a very emotional and touching album that makes you calm down and enjoy every second of it.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|this is a collector's must have..the casting director and director    got it right.... a great up date to a much loved crew..    excellent job...    the three disk set comes with the behind the scenes of how they did it.      Great work hope you all get many awards for this wonderful work.    Excellent job SPYGLASS PARAMOUNT DOLBY TRUE ETC
B000ZELISO|2.0|I'm not that big of Harry Potter fan and bought this Blu-ray for the kids.  I'll leave a discussion of the plot to others.  However, I will mention that the sound quality on the Blu-ray received was particularly poor, at least through the first 30 minutes or so.  The TV volume had to be cranked up to almost full just to barely be able to hear any dialog.  After a while, the movie volume improved and the TV volume could be lowered a bit.  There were several dark scenes that were too dark, making the viewing quite difficult.  For the most part, I don't see much point in buying the Blu-ray version of this movie, primarly due to the crummy sound reproduction and a dark video making Blu-ray moot.  This version that came from Amazon was missing the digital copy of the movie, but Amazon has recognized the problem and will apparently be sending out a free copy of the widescreen DVD.  Hopefully, the sound quality will be better on the DVD.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|While I thought some parts of this movie were slow going, and its length bordered on being too long, it had enough substance, however cliche, to keep it afloat, and the visuals were nothing less than spectacular.  The CGI was really expertly done.  We wouldn't have been able to have this kind of movie experience in the 1970's or 80's.  I thought that the ability of the Na'vi to be able to link up with the flora and fauna of the planet and interact with it using a direct mind link was a nice touch.  Some said this story was predictable, but I was not entirely sure where it was going to go next.  Rather than spoiling some main plot points, a few of which were really good ideas, I will leave it at that.    All in all, this movie is a success.  It keeps a certain level of tension throughout, where you begin to fall in love with the protagonists, and you develop a fear of them failing and/or dying.  If you are a fan of sci-fi and fantasy movies, definitely give this movie a chance.  You might find it's one for the collection.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|I believed the reviews, but was still thinking \\"I'm doing fine without them, why would I REALLY need them?\\". I put them on, played games, noticed that they helped somewhat, and thought they were an ok buy, and that I still could have lived without them.<br /><br />Then I went to my brothers house and we started gaming and he doesn't have these on his controllers. NIGHT AND DAY!!! I was half tempted to run home to get my controllers. I definitely noticed the difference in my efforts to keep my fingers on the L/R2 buttons without the trigger attachments, which I'd not noticed as I gradually got used to mine once I'd put them on.<br /><br />Highly recommend these. I agree with several other reviews that this is how the controllers should have come stock!
B002RSDW80|5.0|99 people have reviewed this before me so I'm not going to rehash the plot. Quite honestly, I never had a desire to see this movie, but was at loose ends and it was the only movie that was half way appealing to me in the RedBox vending machine at the local Walgreens.<br /><br />The movie appealed to me on several levels. First, I did not know much at all about Julia Childs and the information relayed by the film whetted my curiosity to find out more. Streep is totally believable as Childs. Having seen only glimpses of her show, Streep obviously did a study of her and her mannerisms. Amy Adams as Julie portrays a newly 30ish woman searching for her identity through her year long blog where she cooks all of the recipes in Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking.<br /><br />The movie satisfies on several levels-as a biographical portrait, a comedy, a drama. Definitely worth seeing.
0316017922|5.0|I liked this book.  Broke down success into a way that I haven't seen done in most other books.  Most books talk about what YOU can do as an individual to have success-- change your mindset, do this, do that, go this way, go that way, whatever.  This books talks about how connected we all are and how important other people are in our life and how important we are in the lives of other people.  Great examples of how this works.  Really interesting.  Would love a sequel.
B001AR4K8K|1.0|This is a 5 star movie for me overall, but the Blu Ray is a major disappointment.  I'm noticing a clear trend with WB on their recent BR releases - they're a very minor and insubstantial improvement over the original standard def DVD that certainly does not merit the upgrade.  This one is no different, and disappointingly so.  The Lost Boys is an absolute classic of vampire cinema, and deserves much more than Warner Bros did to release this Blu Ray.  The image quality is nearly identical to the original source material, and the audio is the same as well. The original release is more than 95% identical to the Blu Ray, so save your money.
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|Buy this edition if you like this movie.  If you have not seen it yet rent it then buy this cut. it is worth every penny.
B002HWUU1I|3.0|What I loved most about the \\"Once\\" soundtrack was the raw emotion that came out in some of the songs.  All of that edginess has been buffed off of this latest collection of songs.  They are pretty songs but extremely mellow and they just aren't as engaging. Almost a collection of lullabies.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|Very impressive transfer for such an old film.  Crisp images and of course an all-time great movie.  No CGI, just terrific writing, acting, and directing.    I wasn't a fan of the 'book' style of case at first, but now that I have a handful of them it's not so bad, as they don't stick out like sore thumbs as my first 1 or 2 did.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I am a big star trek fan and have been for years. This reboot gave new blood to the franchise and raised my hopes for the future. I recommend it to anyone who is a star trek fan or not!
B001U6YI92|5.0|Crisp transfer to blu-ray, a clear improvement over the DVD.  Nice features and 'new' scenes, although hearing an old Eli and Clint read lines for the latter was a minor (and very brief) distraction.
B001FB4W0C|2.0|I am frankly amazed at all of the 5 star reviews.  I, like many have been a fan of the series from its inception, but this season just lost it.  Clearly the production values have slipped and were in cost saving mode.  Most of the episodes barely get out of the boy's cheesy motel rooms.  Very few special effects save bright lights. To be honest I found this season a bit boring.  Few new adversaries, in fact when the boys do battle something, it is mostly a \\"monster\\" we have already seen before.    I am also surprised by the huge course change into \\"Biblical\\" subject matter.  The first 3 seasons avoided religion pretty much, and kept it purely fantasy, but not this season. Here we have angels and constant references to prophesy and Armageddon BUT surprise, the angels are lying, deceitful, violent, and threatening not unlike the \\"other side\\".  There is no \\"Good Guy\\" to root for.    More surprising is that apparently Lucifer is in on the action, but his antithesis, God, is off in Bermuda on vacation or something because in the story God has no clue what's going on.  Now I am not particularly religious but if you are going to quote Bible verses in the story, and follow a Biblical arch how is it that the Biblical nature of God....you know the \\"knows when even a sparrow falls from a tree\\" thing is totally ignored and God is portrayed as either dead, absent, doesn't give a damn, or dim witted.....or am I missing something.  Also the full on Demon, black eyes and all transition of Sam, and the silly demon blood addiction just doesn't seem to follow where the previous 3 seasons were going..    Finally I really, really hated to see the political message thrown in clearly to prove the writers Liberal bona fides.  Season 3 had it's \\"special parking place in Hell for Chaney\\" line, and this season had its \\"Joe the plumber...what a douche\\" line.  Why?  Purely gratuitous and serving no plot purpose, nor adding anything to the narrative.  Just inserted to show that cool people, likeDean are liberal. Can't I even watch a fantasy show about demon killing without politics?    Add to my disappointment with the stories the fact that the first three discs would not play properly, and the menu function did not work, and I would say I was NOT thrilled with this season.    I am giving it 2 stars because I have enjoyed the series up to this point.  I hope the last season doesn't continue the decline of this one.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I was genuinely looking forward to this much-advertised CD from the unbelievably talented Susan Boyle.  When it arrived, however, and I played the tracks for the first time, I was disappointed.  Wild Horses was well done, as was her signature I Dreamed A Dream.  The rest of the tracks were lacking in one thing or another.  For example, How Great Thou Art was just an almost endless repetition of the hymn's refrain...none of the actual verses to the song were part of this production.  I found this very disappointing; a beautiful, traditional, and inspirational song was condensed to a repetitious, broken-record, refrain.  I love Ms Boyle's one-of-a-kind voice, her unique style, and the robust vitality she can easily add to any song.  But, unfortunately, my overall reaction to this CD was one of betrayal.  I have played the CD often during the past month, since it's release, but generally find myself skipping those tracks which lack the beauty and awe-inspiring vocals I was expecting.  I remain a Susan Boyle fan, and hope that her future albums will contain more of the dynamics one would hope to experience.  As for I Dreamed A Dream...definitely not \\"5 Stars.\\"
0061719544|5.0|I am unable to offer any kind of analysis on the purchase of the book \\"American on Purpose:  The Improbable Adventures of an Unlikely Patriot\\" because this was a birthday gift to one of my best friends.<br /><br />However, having been given the opportunity, I would be so remiss if I did not provide a \\"review\\" of Amazon.com itself.  There would not be enough words of praise and adulation to even begin to adequately describe just how wonderful you are.  While so many things can go awry with on-line shopping, generally, purchasing items at this time of the year could certainly become a nightmare.  Amazon.com is not in this category.  Their shipments of merchandise are almost unbelievably prompt and perfectly correct.  Amazon.com obviously has the art of customer satisfaction mastered.<br /><br />So, thank you Amazon.com.  You are the bestest!!
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I've bought several McCartney Concert DVDs in the past, only to be disappointed by extraneous video clips that really detract from the overall concernt as experienced live.  I saw essentially the same show in Washington D.C. and found myself able to relive several great moments including Paul's tributes to George and John and incredible live versionsof \\"Live and Let Die\\" and \\"Helter Skelter.\\"  If you couldn't catch this tour, this DVD is the next best thing.  Crank up the speakers and enjoy the show!

0810979772|5.0|My nephew lives in Montana and I live in California.  When he told me he couldn't find a book (Diary of a Wimpy kid, Do-It-Yourself) in a series I told him I would look on Amazon.  Of course you had copies and lots of them, new and used.  So I got him a new, hardcover copy and he received it in perfect condition within the time span we were told. He loves his book and has probably read it several times by now.  Thank you for having the book and making me look like the Auntie that can do anything!
B002VPDOFK|5.0|I think this is Alicia's masterpiece album. When I first started listening to each song on this album, every song moved me. This album, more than any other, got to my soul. The music, lyrics, and rhythms really moved me! I was also pleased with the added bonus tracks on this edition and the dvd video of her in-studio performances. The 2 bonus songs really put the final touches on this great album!
6305076995|2.0|We all can bet that contractual blither-blather is holding back a proper redoing of this film and it's album.  Brian Lane, I'm guessing.  Otherwise this tripe quality of such great material wouldn't have been released.  Ragged print - what a joke.  Looks like a VHS transfer from some 3rd generation film after gathering dust for the past twenty five years.
B00260HH3K|1.0|Honestly don't even bother wasting your time and money on this lousy movie. James Wong obviously can't direct for crap if this is the result. For someone whom has not seen the Dragon Ball manga you'd still expect him to direct a film with a decent plot right? what talent?. I mean Batman was a great comic and the movies were great but this film totally suck.    Don't trust the 5 star reviews from a bunch of virtual marketers. (You might like this film if you are mentally aged 5 or under or under influence of drugs) If you don't believe me just read the other reviews from people with 1 star, we can't all be wrong, and we don't try and trick you into buying or seeing the movie too!

1401323820|5.0|Short novel, but a nice mistery plot. I find interesting the interaction between the characters in the book and bring to mind how similar they are to the characters in the TV show. The fact that the Castle character actually have a book that we buy and read, is pretty original. I wonder who is really writing this book. Any way, still a good plot and entertaining.
B000001EHS|3.0|I was a little dissapointed.  I should have just downloaded the two or three good tracks rather then waste the money on this whole cd.
1400063515|5.0|I came to this book expecting a clever but flawed argument for intellectual laziness or superficial thinking, another popular argument for \\"gut\\" or \\"intuition\\" or \\"Zen.\\"  Or perhaps a slick Gladwell-esque treatment of randomness.  Perhaps a popularization of postmodernism or neo-pragmatism applied to financial markets, or a \\"Thriving on Chaos\\" (Tom Peters) for the 21st century.<br /><br />This book is none of those things.  Instead I found myself immersed in a very intriguing and deep intellectual journey into the roots of applied statistics and empirical science that had me thinking and taking notes prolifically.  As readable as it is, this is not (or should not be) a quick read.  Taleb is an erudite scholar but he uses his scholarship in the service of ideas rather than to accumulate impressive footnotes.  His lectures are conversational but convey great weight.<br /><br />I do find his tone somewhat arrogant in spots, oddly so.  The half dozen or so people he finds interesting are worthy dinner companions, the rest of the world of intellegent mortals are pretty much fools who he chooses to stereotype and parody.  Anyway, that's the impression I get.  Contempt for audience usually works against an author.  Still, very few modern authors can combine technical knowledge, originality, and readability the way Taleb can, and this to me kept me reading even when I imagined I was one of the many targets of the author's contempt.<br /><br />Enough on style and impression, the content of this book is what makes it merit five stars.  The core idea here is that we are creatures who quickly and easily sort things into categories and tell stories to make sense of them.  Narration comes unbidden to us, but not skillful abstract thinking.  This much of course we have heard before from the heuristics and biases school and behavioral economics.  Taleb's contribution is to point out a particularly broad implication of this principle, that our knowledge rapidly degrades when rare events are consequential.  We explain them away and miss their importance.  At the same time, we overestimate the impact of rare events for arbitrary reasons when they really have no consequence.<br /><br />That would be of mostly academic interest except for one thing.  The key to Taleb's overall argument is his claim that the impact of rare events is domain-specific.  That means we can learn to distinguish domains where: (a) classical risk statistics apply (\\"Mediocristan\\") from (b) those where rare events and winner-take-all competitions dominate (\\"Extremistan\\").  In \\"Mediocristan\\" domains, classical decision theory in principle should help us (although Taleb seems to feel that these domains are few and far between among things we really care about).<br /><br />In \\"Extremistan,\\" Taleb advises, we should take steps to protect ourselves from rare adverse events and use diverse aggressive risk taking to exploit rare positive events.  The idea here is that we are betting that something rare will eventually impact us in these domains, even though we can't know what specifically it will be.  The point is that in domains where likelihood can't really be calculated, we should focus our efforts instead on the impact rather than guessing at the probability.<br /><br />Taleb doesn't make this argument lightly, he explains the limits in our predictive ability in an understandable way yet he also takes heed of technical details in his arguments.  \\"Extremistan\\" consists of all of the domains where scaling and nonlinear accumulations occur, or rapid deviations from small differences in initial conditions.  In line with complexity theorists, Taleb finds these effects pretty much everywhere of interest to social scientists, economists, and people in general.  He suggests that we might be able to use scalable non-linear maths to get a rough idea of what to expect in some domains, but that we need to remain careful of the illusion of mathematical predictive power.<br /><br />Biological values like height and weight and average life expectancy are areas where the normal curve applies, and perhaps mean failure rate of parts in engineering.  But when important things like money or fame or success can accumulate virtually without limit and often for arbitrary reasons like contagion, the assumptions of Gaussian distributions are just not relevant.  At least that's how I understand Taleb's claim that the normal distribution is a great intellectal fraud: it is applied confidently to things where it has no place being applied.<br /><br />With one strange but perhaps unavoidable exception, Taleb usually follows his own advice.  He considers theories for storytelling purposes and explanation but doesn't take them seriously or depend on them for his argument.  He does use storytelling quite a bit to make his point, even though his argument is largely about the unreliability of our stories.  He seems to be saying that we automatically make sense of events through stories, so it takes a story to help us understand the argument against relying on storytelling.<br /><br />I suppose there is a touch of the postmodernist skepticism of narratives in The Black Swan, but the possibility of having specific strategies for dealing differently with specific domains is in intriguing and welcome update to that tradition, bringing it perhaps more in line with the critical rationalism and conjectures and refutations of Karl Popper and the scientific skepticism of the classical pragmatists than with the modern cynics.  Taleb is not rejecting theory entirely, but he certainly prefers direct experiment and aggressive risk taking (in strategic areas) to bland assumptions of predictable statistical likelihood and the reliability of knowledge.<br /><br />For me this book ties together a lot of diverse ideas very nicely in an original and interesting way, and yet stays on target with its message.  Very impressive effort and a very worthwhile read.ife expectancy are areas where the normal curve applies, and perhaps mean failure rate of parts in engineering.

B002SQ364Q|4.0|In a film about Woodstock, we expect two things: great music, or deep meditations about humanity and coming together.  \\"Taking Woodstock\\" doesn't really give us either.  This is NOT a film about the concert--it's a film about ESTABLISHING the concert, which trust me is a very different thing entirely.  We don't hear the music, we don't see the acts--this is a film about the young man (Elliot Tiber) who sees the opportunity to bring some revenue and culture to his small New York hometown.<br /><br />I'm not criticizing \\"Taking Woodstock\\" for it's lack of music; the film stands solidly enough on its own, though there will be obvious viewers who expected something a little more formulaic.  What I AM criticizing the film for--and, really, the only criticism I have, though it's a big one--is its lack of depth.  It is a pleasant viewing experience, but doesn't come off as overly memorable.  Even Liev Schreiber in drag, as funny and pitch-perfect as he is, comes off as rather ho-hum in the grand scheme of things.<br /><br />The best thing about the film is the performances, which are strong all-around.  Demetri Martin proves he's more than just a funny man in the lead role, providing a near-flawless performance.  He's helped along by some great supporting roles: Schreiber as a gun-toting cross-dresser; Emile Hirsch as a Vietnam vet; Paul Dano in what is probably one of the more random film cameos; the ever-reliable Eugene Levy as the farmer who loans his land for the event; Jonathan Groff as concert promoter Michael Lang; and especially Henry Goodman and Imelda Staunton as (respectively) Elliot's caring-but-tough father and extremely thrifty mother.  The latter risks being a stereotype, but we don't care--Staunton is so enjoyable in the role, it's worth the risk.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Taking Woodstock\\" is definitely a film to see, if you like this kind of thing.  Lee gets a little too creative with the camera work at times--the multiple screens and documentary-style footage come off as hokey--but most of the film looks stunning, with solid cinematography.  Elliot's sexuality seems more of an afterthought.  The film should either focus more upon it, or ignore it completely; we get the sense that, after \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" Lee feels compelled to address the subject, but too afraid to make another \\"gay\\" picture, leading to a tediousness that the actors handle well enough, but weighs down the story at spots.  Still, solid performances highlight this entertaining--if not incredibly memorable--film.most of the film looks stunning, with solid cinematography.

0684171600|5.0|I bought this book for my 10 year old boy.  We recently watched the Walt Disney movie together and I wanted to interst him in the book for his fun as well as for his reading development.  But I may read a few of the parts outloud for him for our fun together as we practice our best pirate voices.         This is a very well made reproduction of the most notable version of this classic book with famous artwork pictures.         Buy this book for your boy and write a note to him on the inside cover like I did.  He will keep it always.
0061703257|5.0|I picked up this book because I had seen the trailer for the upcoming film version. It wasn't until then that I realized that this same author wrote Gone, Baby, Gone and Mystic River, both films that I really enjoyed. Shutter Island definitely holds its own!<br /><br />Once I started reading it, I could barely put it down. It is a detective story, a thriller centered around the case of Rachel Soldano, a patient on Shutter Island, the site of a high security mental hospital for violent offenders. US Marshals Teddy Daniels and his partner Chuck Aule are sent to find out how Soldano escaped a locked cell. I can't say too much without giving away one of the many twists---just know this one will keep you guessing until the shocking end.
0312370849|5.0|I found this book a real page turner. The two stories intertwine and come together at the end of the story. The content of the story was unknown to me and this alone was not only something to learn about, but also shocking.

0316044938|4.0|Good fiction transports us. It takes us out of our own lives and experiences into those of others. In this case, it takes us beyond the world as we know it, to an \\"in-between\\" from where the spirits of the dead can know and see everything, and can tell the story of a family coping with an unspeakable loss. Alice Sebold has chosen her narrator well, a young murdered girl, Susie, who in the afterlife inherits an omniscience that shines light into the haunting shadows of an inexplicable act of horror, and grapples with questions of \\"why?\\", \\"what for?\\", and \\"why me?\\" Susie finds it as difficult and unwilling to leave the physical world behind, as her family does in \\"moving on.\\" It is this constant tension, the pull between the living and the dead, that gives this book its drive. Sebold paces her story perfectly -- moving back and forth in time,  from heaven to earth and back again, imbuing the narrative with the rich sensory luminosity of Susie's \\"in-between\\" perspective. Our urge to find out what happens to the killer, our desire (like the characters in the book) for justice, while never fully cast aside, diminishes in Sebold's skillful hands, and is replaced by concern and empathy for her family and friends as we watch how they cope, or don't cope, with their loss, and how their love for Susie finds shape and form when Susie is no longer there.<br /><br />It takes a remarkable writer to give shape to a tragic loss an make this kind of story work. If you believe in a heaven, or that the spirits of the dead move among the living, this book may resonate very powerfully with you. Others, may find the incident in the latter half of the book where Susie is briefly transposed into physical form as going too far. Fair enough, but, ultimately, the few imperfections, a few strands perhaps not fully teased out, did not diminish this exquisitely honed tableau of a suburban community torn apart by tragedy that tries to find a way to be whole again. \\"The Lovely Bones\\" is a book to be savoured. It broaches a difficult subject but does not exploit it. It demands that we willingly stretch our notions of life and death. And if we can drop our expectations of revenge, it rewards us with a fuller appreciation of the fleeting intuitive moments that imbue even a life cut short too early, with depth and meaning.

B00000IMTG|5.0|I received this album on vinyl for my 18th birthday, from the guy who played guitar in the band I was in at the time. A better birthday gift (or one that has left so lasting an impression) would be difficult to pinpoint.    From the very opening track of \\"Kill the King\\" where they intro with dialogue from the movie \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", \\"Toto, I have a feeling we're not in Kansas anymore!\\" and BAM! Smack you between the ears with Blackmore! Hard to describe the album after that because it all becomes a sonic blur of ecstacy.....    I have read some of the reviews of this album and its lack of incredible tracks like \\"Stargazer\\" and the like, but I think Ritchie decided to make an album of heartfelt tracks and not pander to the obvious. Of course, trying to tell someone like Ritchie Blackmore, with an ego the size of a continent is no easy task... the man had things \\"under control\\". Much like what Iommi has done with Sabbath.    This album ABSOLUTELY SMOKES like there's no tomorrow. As good as most of the tracks are, the one that stays with me the longest (other than the beautiful and most powerful \\"Catch the Rainbow\\") is \\"Still I'm Sad\\". A better LP ender there could be none. All of the best Rainbow musicians each nail their own parts with expertise and care, Cozy bashing the skins, Jimmie Bain (one of my favorite bass players) thumping along,  and of course Ronnie James Dio nailing all the difficult vocals and interacting with the crowd. Crooningly beautiful vocals on tracks like \\"Catch the Rainbow\\" just set your soul on fire.    If you've never listened to this album, and you're a dedicated rocker, SHAME ON YOU......
B002JCSWUW|5.0|\\"Invictus\\" is superb! A movie that weaves true life and artistic license seamlessly....with strong appreciation for Nelson Mandela's spirit and insight towards unifying a country fraught with numerous woes, and no formula for resolution. Rugby may be a more vicious game than portrayed in this film, however, served its purpose as a unifying vehicle for a country divided by bigotry, ignorance and fear. Recommendeded with highest acclaim...oh, and take a tissue :)

0143144448|2.0|This book starts off, then gets exponentially sillier and siller.    It is similar in some ways to the classic movie- Colossus, the Forbin Project (but not as smart).    I don't care how many times the characters in this book say pre-programming AI to follow sensory inputs is doable, check out how hard it is for real, really smart scientists to make robotic cars.
B002H3F7F6|3.0|Not surpised that Sting has taken another creative turn to re-invent his musical style,.  He is of course an artist of great diversity.    However the majority of the songs are not to my liking.    Soul cakes is a festive and addictive song that you will easily  gravitate to.  However I must say that I was dissappointed on  the whole regarding this album.      I am a big Sting fan, but in my opinion, this album is not one  you may want to purchase.(first time I ever thought that would  actually be my situation)

B002LL13BQ|5.0|This grand Zeffirelli production has a perfect cast. All singers look the parts and act well. Teresa Stratas was considered the greatest singing actress of her generation. Her fragile Mimi really hit the benchmark! Jose Carreras'passion and drop-dead handsomeness, coupled with a great voice and vocal technique provide the perfect Rodolpho. Renata Scotto's Musetta was brilliantly acted and sung by the greatest Italian diva of the day. All the other roles were well cast. The great Maestro and Music Director of the Metropolitan Opera,James Levine, presented an impassioned reading of the score-remarkably cognizant of the composer's wishes. The Met Opera orchestra is at it's best and the choruses are great!
045122499X|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  You need to set aside some truths about the middle ages, particularly the male/female dynamic of the time, but this is afterall fiction, not a history lesson.<br /><br /> The characters are well developed, rich and likeable.  Their individual threads weave a beautiful tapastry as they are all connected to each other's destinies. All this begining with a secret encounter when they were children.<br />There are striking similarities in development af each character with their roots being nearly incarnations from those in \\"Pillars.\\"  It is satisfying  when their fates are finally revealed.  I was however hoping for a more dramactic reveal of the secret towards the end, for it is a bit anticlimatic, but all in all this book is a terrific read that could have, despite it's length, gone on longer.
0385504225|2.0|I must say I agree with some people here. While the lost symbol is interesting, it is long winding and leaves you with a definite feeling of anti-climax. While I was prepared for the book to be a bit redundant at times (his books always are), this book had way too many pages to process. Does anyone else think all his books featuring Robert Langdon essentially have the same storyline? Robert Langdon gets caught up in something and has to crack some kind of code from centuries ago while being coerced by an perverted, sick lunatic.     I liked parts of the book, especially about arcane symbols, codes and centuries-old plots. But couldn't it be set against a different backdrop? He knows his Art and Architecture, but the science part can get a little fuzzy.    All in all, definitely not worth the money spent...but is a nice one-time read.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Definitely in the \\"chick flick\\" genre, but a very funny, very good movie.  Gave it to my Mom for Christmas and she loved it.  Meryl Streep is unstoppable.  She morphs into any character she wants - it's amazing.  She WAS Julia Child.  I recommend the movie to chicks and dudes alike.
0143034901|5.0|When I first started reading the SOTW, I thought it was along the lines of a Mary Higgins Clark. But as the story progresses, it depicts not only an amazing portrayal of human frailty and weaknesses but also the human ability to love. The story is very suspenseful, deep and leaves you pondering over it for hours. While I could guess parts of the story, the style of writing still made me feel the full impact of the scene. The best part of the book, however, is the overall positive feeling you are left with. Definitely worth the time and money.
B000069AT7|5.0|This is for the collector who actually likes E.T. Though I've seen the remake and prefer the original, having it in one package like this is just magnificent, from the book to an actual film stock. Great packaging shows this was done with heart. The soundtrack addition was quite unexpected (even though it does say it includes it). It would be awesome if more movies included their separate audio soundtracks. This is a real treat for the family.
0060007737|5.0|As a marketing professional with an advertising degree and fifteen years of experience, the more marketing I do, the more these \\"Immutable Laws of Branding\\" seem come into play. When I first read this book six or seven years ago, I thought, \\"Well, I understand and agree with most of the precepts, but not all of them.\\" But, as I've managed marketing campaigns and projects over the years, whenever one wouldn't get the results I wanted (or expected), after going back and reviewing it, the issue oftentimes could be clearly tied back to the violation of at least a couple of the \\"laws.\\"     The biggest problem with the book isn't anything in the book itself. The biggest problem revolves around what most people think marketing and branding is or does (or should do). So, for the most part, even most professional marketers operate on their already understood beliefs about marketing. They take \\"common sense\\" approaches to solving branding problems (which are always unique) and then wonder why they didn't get the results they wanted. Common sense is just that, \\"COMMON.\\" This book explains the importance of a brand being unique and singular in its focus. So, if you take common sense approaches to unique problems, you'll get an \\"average\\" result. To me, continually obtaining \\"average\\" results is a sure fire road to ultimate failure.    So, I recommend this book for marketing and non-marketing professionals with a couple of caveats...     Realize that this book is very, very focused on developing and managing a brand. It doesn't give you an economic model that tells you how to price your product or service, or how you should set up a distribution channel (but, if you fully grasp the concepts, it will give you ideas on how to make decisions like these).    Most importantly, keep an open mind as you read and realize that many of the concepts in the book will absolutely be COUNTER-INTUITIVE. You will most likely flat out disagree some of them, but I would challenge you to read the book in its entirety and then, over time see if and how the \\"laws\\" apply. You may be pleasantly surprised over the years (just as I have been) and end up with this one being one of your favorite marketing books as well.
B000ZECQ08|1.0|I've loved Rowling's books, and the first three films, but I confess I found this last one disappointing. There are so many key scenes left out and strange ones put in that make no sense, I wondered at times if the film was of the book I'd read. \\"Based on a novel by...\\" is only too true. And don't get me started on the 17 minutes of game ads, trailers and other rubbish that are impossible to fast forward over before you are finally allowed to see what you paid for. I wonder what the author makes of it all.

B002WTX7XO|3.0|Not a terrible movie but it falls short of its potential.  The cast of young actors are talented and deserved a better script but as is so often the case with such \\"end of the world\\" scenarios, the movie industry demands a certain formulaic plot line. I suspect that even a 1970's existentialist would have problems with the \\"hell is other people\\" unspoken subplot of the movie and I wonder how much of that was intentional on the part of the writers. When roaches are shown, they can't be just ordinary roaches but have to be what I think was giant Brazilian roaches because they look so much more yucky than say an ordinary North American roach. Forget the fact that they don't exist in the wild in the USA. It's a little detail but it speaks to the general attitude of those who made the movie. Poor Chris Pine is saddled with the role of the \\"dumb\\" (read didn't go to college) brother who is however tough and street savvy and acts like an idiot even in the face of incomparable human destruction because that's what Hollywood (?) seems to think movie goers want to see in such a movie and believe people would act like in such circumstances. There are moments in the film that work (I'm not writing this review to be a spoiler so I won't name them) but with the talent of the cast it could have and should have been much better.
0385340540|2.0|I'm relatively new to Grisham's work, but even I could tell that this book was not up to his standards. The story follows Joel Backman, a high-powered broker who gets himself into a lot of trouble and is sent to a federal prison to be kept in solitary confinement. What that trouble is exactly we don't find out until about halfway through the book. When we are first introduced to Backman, he is described in such terms that make you glad he got caught. Surely, he is the bad guy in the book, right? As events unfold so painfully slowly, I thought perhaps that Backman would turn out not to be too bad and perhaps he was framed or something. Nope. He did everything and got everything he deserved. But yet by the end of the book, I got that feeling that I was supposed to like him, despite being the sleazeball that he is/was.<br /><br />The story is set in Italy where the U.S. government has decided to hide Backman until they deem an appropriate time to leak his whereabouts to foreign nations in order to see who kills him first. I thought perhaps this was going to turn into a story of how Backman kept having to hide from either the U.S. government or foreign governments. Instead, way too much of the book is spent on Backman learning Italian or eating some lovely Italian delicacy or visiting some wonderful Italian architecture. The pace does pick up when the time actually comes for Backman to run, but even that doesn't make up for the rest of the book. The professional, government-paid assassins sent to whack him are seemingly a side note, even though the whole premise of the book is that Backman is hiding from them and is supposed to be on the run.<br /><br />It's evident, as Grisham points out in his author's note, that he greatly admires the Italian culture. I'm sure quite a bit of research went into describing the various Italian cultural tidbits. But reading how to greet one another in Italian over and over again is not the stuff a person usually wants to read in a Grisham book. Overall, it was slow and disappointing.it was slow and disappointing.
B000244FDW|4.0|The movie is the greatest for all the details-  The remakes after this all vary on the theme and leave stuff out.  This DVD is a 2 sider and i do not like that- I was not expecting that - seems cheaply done for such a nice classic
1449575617|5.0|Wilkie Collins, friend and confidante of Charles Dickens, wrote thrillers, many originally published in Dickens' magazines that gave Victorian readers a generous helping of delicious chills and thrills.    The Woman In White was his most successful novel of suspense.  So popular was it that it generated a whole Woman in White industry that included Woman In White clothing, Woman in White perfume, and even a Woman in White waltz.    This is a classic story of mistaken identity as two women of remarkably similar looks but extremely dissimilar circumstances find their lives inextricably drawn together.  Laura Fairlie is beautiful and wealthy and has led a calm and sheltered life. Anne Catherick, Laura's pale look-alike has known only poverty and neglect and suffers from mental illness.  Both women find their lives drawn into the dangerous net spread by Sir Percival Glyde who seeks to marry Laura while pursuing Anne in order to suppress a guilty secret which he believes Anne will use to destroy him.    Enter artist and teacher Walter Hartright who falls in love with Laura and is also drawn into the mystery of her close resemblance to the unfortunate Anne Catherick.  Told through multiple points of view, where each character tells some part of the story, The Woman in White keeps the reader constantly off balance as person after person reveals what they know or suspect or fear about the mystery surrounding Anne, Sir Percival, and Laura.    Filled with memorable characters, including the irrepressible Marian Halcombe and the infamous Count Fosco, darkened with mystery, and peppered with wonderfully comic scenes, this story justly earned its reputation as one the Victorian era's most loved novels.
B000IOM1RI|2.0|I love Jack Black but the language is terrible on this CD.  It was distracting from the music.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|Everybody has their favorite holiday film; the one they must see before the old year ends and the new year begins.  For me that favorite is The Apartment, starring a very young and bewildered Jack Lemmon and a very young and lovely Shirley MacLaine.  True, this is not your usual holiday fare, full of happy families and  wrapped presents under the tree, but there is a feeling of love and redemption about it that happily triumphs, despite the machinations of the evil boss Fred MacMurry, before his bland and boring My Three Sons days. And no matter how many times I watch Jack Lemmon strain spaghetti through a tennis racket, I still smile. The best films linger in your mind long after the credits. The Apartment does that for me, year after year.
B002CIY8EM|1.0|this is a great book if you are narrow-minded enough to believe that ancient humans were so primitive that they were incapable of creating the great monuments that still stand today. he wants you to believe aliens were responsible instead of human ingenuity. it could be funny if it wasnt so apparent that he actually believes that
0307346617|4.0|Like many books I've read, I picked this one up after hearing of the impending film adaptation.  This book was a great read.  It is written in an interview style and recounts the \\"zombie apocolypse\\" from outbreak through not so much eradication but thinning the hoards down to a manageable level.  There is no real impending danger so I think putting this in the horror section is probably not accurate.  It should be in the Sci-Fi genre.  Anyways, The accounts are so vivid and seem so real that what you are reading feels like it actually happened, or most definately COULD happen and maybe even WILL happen.  It almost seems inevitable.  Some of the stories that are recounted are gruesome and tense.  The most frightening stories occur during the section dedicated to \\"the great panic\\" where there are some disturbing stories showing the lengths people will go to survive.      This book made me want to read more about zombies and I want to check out Max Brooks' other book \\"The Zombie Survival Guide\\" but I decided to start on another book that was just greenlit for a film \\"Pride and Prejudice and Zombies\\"  Catch you on the flip side.
B002QEXN2K|3.0|As a big fan of the blues and JM's more recent work, I was disappointed by the sound of this album.  It's too poppy, reminiscent of his early work (Heavier Things, Inside Wants Out), which is fine, he does it well, but not what I was looking for.  Because of his axe skills, he is capable of so much more, and while the abbreviated \\"Crossroads\\" is a nice nod to blues history, that's all it accomplishes.  This record will sell very well, possibly getting a Grammy nomination or two, but I long for the sound he accomplished on Try! and Continuum.  Bring back the blues, JM!
B002T9H2L0|4.0|This movie is really pretty outstanding.  The opening scene is intense, frightening, shocking, and appauling all at once, and it sets up the entire film perfectly.  I really had no expectations for this movie because I had read so many mixed reviews and none of them really said anything, so I actually thought this was a really good movie although a bit drawn out.  The film is artfully done beautifully shot and extremely well acted.    Now here's why you may not like this quite as much as I did and why my wife absolutely HATED it.    What most expected from this movie:  1- Gore, action, and more gore and more action  2- A story that follows the Basterds as they wreak havoc on Hitler's army  3- Maybe a few subtitles as the film does take place in France after all  4- Classic Quentin Tarantino comedic dialogue    What the film actually is:  1- A character driven story HEAVY on dialogue and other than the last 20 minutes extremely light on action with a couple pretty graphic gory bits tossed in.  The last 20 minutes is extremely graphic and violent.  2- The story largely follows the young Jewish girl/woman who escapes the opening scene.  The Basterds are just kind of there as an afterthought because they are planning to blow up the same theater.  3- This film is conservatively speaking about 80% subtitled and spoken either in German or French.  4- The only part that is really funny (and it is hilarious) is Brad Pitt \\"speaking\\" Italian so poorly that Helen Keller could have picked him out as the American in the crowd.    I've read negative reviews about how this film is \\"war porn\\" and diminishes U.S. veterans in some way, but this couldn't be further from the truth.  First of all this film is pure fiction that just happens to take place during WWII in France.  Nothing depicted in this film is based in any way on fact.  It is a complete fantasy of what could have possibly happened if Hitler and all the Nazi upper echelon had all decided to go to a jewish owned movie theater to watch a propaganda film.    Overall it is an extremely well made film that does just about everything well.  It is a little bit drawn out at over 2.5 hours but like I said it is very well done and the acting is superb.  4.5 stars.  I'd recommend it but be sure to have an open mind.      ***Update***  My wife wants to watch it again.  She thinks that maybe due to the fact that we started this at about 2:00 am might have had an effect on her opinion.  We'll see.  For me personally after a second viewing I like it even more.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|this is the best tv show in a long time,not to mention the brothers are hot! With all the reality show crap out there this one is a breath of fresh air.
B001FB55I0|4.0|I never bothered to see this in the theater because I couldn't really accept a PG-13 rated Terminator.  I understand that that is the money rating, but come on.  I'm actually glad I bought this the R-rated version because I really enjoyed it.  The action was good and really well shot.  Overall it was really a good flick.  It wasn't the epic that I was hoping for, but it is definately a solid 4 star action flick.    ***MILD SPOILER***  I hadn't heard anything specific about this movie so when the T-800 came out looking exactly like an early-mid 80's Arnold I was pleasantly shocked because during the marketing of this they made such a point to say that he wasn't going to be in it when I saw him I got goose bumps.  I realize it was a CG head (or at least face) but that was pretty sweet.  *****NO MORE SPOILERS*****    All in all I recommend it for any fans of the first two Terminators.  It's at least worth a rental.  I do hope the extended version that everyone seems to be talking about gets released.  I'd like to see that.
B0017ZB8M6|5.0|Here is my track by track review of \\"One of the Boys\\" by Katy Perry. After selling more than 5 million copies worldwide, this album has cemented Katy into the elites of pop artists.<br /><br />1. One of the Boys - The title track, this dance song deals with Katy hanging out alot with guys, but really just wanting to be a girl to be in a relationship with one of the guys she likes. In short, she doesn't want to be just One of the Boys anymore. This song is extremely catchy and a great starter. Hopefully an indicator of things to come!! 4/5<br />2. I Kissed A Girl - We've all heard it, with mixed reactions. I don't necessarily love the message that she is conveying, but the point is that this song is addicting and will be stuck in your head for days on end...and fun to shout along to!! 3/5<br />3. Waking Up In Vegas - A Fun, face-paced dance track, Katy Perry recalls a trip to the infamous city of sin with her boyfriend, chronically telling the listener about all the different things they did. It is an AMAZING song all around! 4/5<br />4. Thinking of You - Whoaaa. Slowww Dowwwwwnnnnnnn. Katy takes a MAJOR turn from the rest of the album at this point with this ballad. It is moving and telling, and I truly love it (and am disappointed that it did not do well on the charts!!) The music video is MOVING, TOUCHING, and you NEED to see it to complete the expirience! 5/5<br />5. Mannequin - Another slower/tamer song, this song is still good nonethless. \\"I wanna hit you just to see if you cry\\" exemplifies the rest of the song, with electronic beats and angsty lyrics. A good song, but a skipper. 3/5<br />6. Ur So Gay - She released this song a while ago on the internet exclusively, and I have to the say that the lyrics are just...clever!! I wish that it wasn't censored though...because there is really no need...anyways, a funny, humorous track!! 3/5<br />7. Hot N Cold - Her second single, I would venture to say that this song is the single best song on the entire album. A fun dance song (like many others) and it really exemplifies what the whole album is about--just having a good time!! 5/5<br />8. If You Can Afford Me - Another fast-faced song, this one is pretty fun to listen to. \\"If you wanna ride, just name your price, don't play cheap with your heart\\" I like this song alot as well!! 4/5<br />9. Lost - Katy slows it down a bit, with the music-box like \\"Lost\\". This song is SO emotional and PERFECTLY delivered, which makes it easily the best slow song on the album. 5/5<br />10. Self Inflicted - Stepping up the tempo (anyone else feeling a little nauseous!!?), this song is another SOLID track. It is almost filler, but if it classified as such, it is some of the best filler on the album (which means...it really isn't filler!!!!!) 3/5<br />11. I'm Still Breathing - Another emotionally tinged ballad, this one is probably ranked lower than Thinking of You and Lost in my eyes (well...ears i guess). 2/5<br />12. Fingerprints - FILLLLERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. But still good filler. =) 2.5/5<br /><br />Verdict,<br /><br />A strong album from Katy Perry, you NEEEEEEDDDD TO BUY IT!!!! You will not regret it!nd it really exemplifies what the whole album is about--just having a good time!! 5/5  8. If You Can Afford Me - Another fast-faced song, this one is pretty fun to listen to. \\"If you wanna ride, just name your price, don't play cheap with your heart\\" I like this song alot as well!! 4/5  9.

Self Inflicted - Stepping up the tempo (anyone else feeling a little nauseous!!?), this song is another SOLID track. It is almost filler, but if it classified as such, it is some of the best filler on the album (which means...it really isn't filler!!!!!) 3/5  11. I'm Still Breathing - Another emotionally tinged ballad, this one is probably ranked lower than Thinking of You and Lost in my eyes (well...ears i guess). 2/5  12. Fingerprints - FILLLLERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR. But still good filler. =) 2.5/5    Verdict,    A strong album from Katy Perry, you NEEEEEEDDDD TO BUY IT!!!! You will not regret it!
B00003CXB4|2.0|We bought this under the led assumption that this was an original copy of the movie. It is very apparent it is not when looking at the printed cover. Someone who has never seen the real casing may not even realize that its fake, but the pictures are very blurry. The dvd works great but the credits skip badly. I basicly paid $30+ for a copy of The Lion King. If that is what I wanted I could have gotten that for free!
B002T45VX6|5.0|I am from the Philippines and decided to buy this US Special edition because of its bonus contents not present in the Philippine copy I already have.    With She Wolf, Shakira has concreted her reputation of being able to cross genres and be very good at it. She had been to rock, pop, even reggae, bossa, acoustic, etc. Now, she is into the electronic beat in music, though she had electronic-sounding songs in the past, e.g. Timor and Las de la Intuicion, She Wolf is the full blown electronic album.    However teh genre shift, the Shakira everybody knows is still in its best with all those fresh metaphors of lyrics and word combination.    The title track, She Wolf is a very dancey musical treat with all the basses and the truck-like beeps in addition to Shakira's own howling and panting. It suits well on full blast speakers and the clubs and parties will never be sedentary with this song played around.    Men in this Town is another song dancers just cant get enough of and Mon Amour contains that \\"rockera\\" spirit Shaki always has. Gypsy is the only mellow song in the album but has its own strengths as another pop treat conducive to musings and reminiscing. Did it Again is quite an emphatic song that will never be out of place on the break dancing floor. Why Wait reminds one of Eastern Europe and the Middle East with the exotic sound it contains. Long Time and Good Stuff also contain those world music elements Shakira songs have been known for and she additionally plays with the pace of singing from singing fast and then slowing down, which is also present in some other songs. Spy, a collaboration with Wyclef Jean is the song friends can play and sing during music jams and when having a good time.    Additional track, Give it Up to Me, a collaboration with Lil Wayne is a hip hop sound that has a very naughty feel to it. Did it Again Remix has Kid Cudi's rap lines and occasional hums throughout the song. The T4 Live version of Gypsy has Shakira playing the harmonica inthe beggining and in the end of the song, which cannot be heard on the album version, while the live T4 She Wolf version is just as teasing as the studio record.    This is definitely a worthy buy. The She Wolf Shakira may sound a bit different from her previous works but that defines a good artist, one who can shift and change and still be at his or her best. Besides, the She Wolf Shakira is not totally different, just a little experimental, and still the very great artist--Shakira!
B002HWRYJE|4.0|While there are some holes in the plot, Star Trek still shines as a very entertaining movie. The acting and visual effects are great.  You need not be a Star Trek fan to enjoy this movie.  Very well done!
B00127RAJY|5.0|This will actually make a difference. In 25 minutes. You don't have to go to the gym, you are done with it around the same time you start to think about how much working out is bore. Bam it's over and you get to feel virtuous and move on to your life. I'm in pretty good shape but don't belong to a gym and one of those people who want to get the best workout bang in the fastest time possible.         Divided into three levels with each level using interval training, you will notice a difference in your arm muscles within a couple of weeks. I've used this DVD during my pregnancy second semester as well, making modifications for the abdominal work because I want to keep my arms toned and work in some aerobic even as my belly gets larger and larger. The abdominal work isn't great but it's something and you will certainly find yourself sweating (especially when you are on level two or three).          And quite frankly, I really like that Jillian is not a cheerleader type, that she finds the right balance between encouragement and reminding you that you are a wimp if you don't keep going. Sort of like mom but not as cut.
B002XTBE8I|5.0|I'm pretty sure these 7 extra songs at least 6 of them were recorded for Relapse 2 but he heard all the people complaining about the voice and all on Relapse so he is rerecording the whole Relapse 2 for us so it will be classic. But needless to say the 7 songs on here are well worth buying the CD the songs are great I love them.
B0020MKTOS|5.0|I hadn't seen in a movie in..drum roll please..six years. ANY movie.<br />As I bought myself a portable DVD player for Christmas for business use and for travel, I of course needed to get some movies!<br />AHHHH!!!!!!!! I had no idea what was even out there or what I would like to watch!<br />I had a plane trip coming up and wanted to get some for the trip.<br />When I went to Amazon's DVD page, Gran Torino was showing and of course, since I'm a huge Clint Eastwood fan, it was my choice.<br />I'm stunned as to what to say and I can't really add anything that other reviewers have not already said. BTW, I concur completely with Robert Crawford's absolutely beautiful review as that says it all so well.<br /><br />The unfolding of the layers to this crotchety, bitter man is what is so special and yet at the same time so sad that this is what his sons will never know, never experience is one that hit the 'closest to home' for me and much of the sadness that I did feel in this movie. The loss. The waste.<br /><br />I also want to comment on how much I enjoyed the actress who played Sue - the girl next door. She was a fabulous actress and you adored her instantly. Conversely, I had a bit more of a difficult time 'believing' the character of the boy until much more into the movie.<br /><br />Clint is still so very handsome - one scene where he puts on a nice jacket and has a close shave and no matter his age, he's still 'got it'.<br /><br />Yes, the old man thought long and hard and came up with the winning solution to a very real and very gruesome problem. And along with that, he buried the demons haunting his heart and mind for all those years.<br /><br />The movie is sad? Yes, but the saddest part of all is that it's a reality that is a part of so many peoples' lives all the time.
159562015X|4.0|If you are in any area of leadership not only do you need to go over this book but you need to have all your employees go over it too. It's a great way to learn how you operate and how to inspire those you lead. But then again I'm context so I really dig stuff like this!

B000MR9D5E|3.0|[I added updates and further details to the bottom half of this review due to requests that I offer proof to my claims.]    If I offered a rating after one viewing, I would have said 5 stars without hesitation. However, after a careful second viewing, I have become disenchanted.    The video of the snow leopards was one of the most remarkable components of the entire series. However, BBC added fake snow to this video, presumably to make the final snow leopard scenes more dramatic. For those of you who have the series, please verify the fake snow for yourself***. To my knowledge, no one else has noted this fabrication... either in Amazon reviews or anywhere online. It is sad that BBC fabricated a part of this video. This series is about nature, not Hollywood special effects. This prompts two questions:    (1) What other special effects have been added by BBC that we have yet to notice?    (2) Are the story lines real? That is, did BBC simply take a lot of video footage and then make up the animal story lines for each part like many other nature videos?    My comments regard the authenticity and honesty of the construction of Planet Earth. My enthusiasm for the series has been tempered and I now watch it with a vigilant and skeptical eye. While I still enjoy the series greatly (plenty of other reviews explain why), it has lost much of the magic that made it so unique.    *** View Disc 1, Episode 2 (Mountains), starting at time 31:26. The snow in the first part of the snow leopard part appears to be real. However, the last couple minutes with the snow leopard part has fake snow added after-the-fact. [Update with more detailed evidence below.]    - - -    12/30/09 Update: Reply to \\"... Please get some proof or solid evidence...\\" in comments. (For those curious, current review rating: 1 of 7.)    The proof I provide is the video: it is self-evident that it is fake.    Detailed evidence:  (1) The snow is thick and heavy in the \\"fake snow\\" scene.  (2) The light snow in previous scenes built up in a layer on the ground and animals.  (3) There is no snow accumulation on the ground or animals in the heavier snow, i.e. where the snow was added as a special effect.  (4) Near the end of the scene I describe, the snow is so heavy it becomes difficult to see the animals, yet there is still ZERO accumulation on the animals or ground.  (5) The special effect snow is added in three \\"layers\\". Often times at least two layers fall at the same speed, which cannot occur naturally (since they would be presumably at different distances from the camera).    For those of you who do view this part of the video with a critical eye and disagree, I welcome any criticisms of the points above.
B002RBZ13Q|5.0|Simplemente increible, maravilloso, el concierto es increible, todo fan de The Killers debe tener este concierto en vivo, la calidad de la imagen es excelente, el sonido maravilloso! recomendado 100%
B002UWH8P6|5.0|A great and interesting stuff. A bit more dramatic and edgier than Atlantis and SG-1...but like those two its a lot of recycled scifi concepts from other shows from startek to BSG.. still a fan and i love it
B000RZIGVS|4.0|It is as expected, the 20th Anniversary edition. I would have wanted more in depth interviews and behind the scenes coverage, but there is a fair amount at the end of each season. Don't expect anything other than the bare-bones basics here.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Wonderful for old fans and new. Great starting point for anyone interested in getting into Star Trek. Old fans who are closed minded to change should stay away though. Give it a chance!
B002RSDW8A|5.0|Julie and Julia was such an entertaining movie (my husband loved it as well). Julie is a woman who is about to turn 30. She and her husband have just moved to a tiny, cramped apartment in Queens, NY above a pizza shop. She works full time at a just so so government job, and is unsure what to do with her life. Julie does love to eat, she loves to cook, so she comes up with an idea to cook every single recipe in Julia Child's Mastering the Art of French Cooking cookbook. She plans to do this all in one year and there are over 500 recipes. Every day she blogs about her cooking experience, and soon she becomes quite popular out there in cyberspace. She becomes totally obsessed with her project, and fortunately for her she has a supportive husband on her cheering squad.<br /><br />If you see the movie, I think you will agree the Meryl Streep was just fabulous as Julia Child. She sounded just like her, and she too had a supportive husband like Julie, who encouraged her to pursue her interest in cooking, even though she was in her 40's when she did.<br /><br />It was amazing how they combined Julie Powell's story with Julia Child's : My Life in Paris story. Laugh out loud moments you will want to experience again and again. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B002P7UCMC|5.0|The amazing thing is the album gets better and better on subsequent listening. Even on the 30th play I notice new elements and find the songs more attractive than ever. It is so unusual for a band to make music this good this late in their careers. This is a real achievement and as it may well be their last studio album, it is a wonderful way to close out their studio sessions (they will tour for years, dont worry). Dont miss this album even if you are a new Rammstein fan.  For those of us who are already fans, this must rank as one of their best and most complex albums ever.  First four tracks are as good as Rammstein gets.  Three more tracks on the album rate constant play so thats 7 out of 11 that are fantastic and will sound better and better the more you listen.  And the other tracks are pretty good too.  Try it...then get Mutter and dont forget Live aus Berlin and Volkerball for the Rammstein concert experience on DVD.
1597772992|5.0|Great book by a qualified writer. Will give you a whole new slant on scientific evidence. Will give you the information to improve, prolong and perhaps even save your life for many years.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I loved this movie at the Theaters and just had to buy it. It has enough action packed scenes to keep your interest and if your a Trekie, has the past change enough to bring new things into the story. A young James T. Kirk, starts his life with his new friends, in space.  Great Movie.  Bought it on Amazon for a great price. Checkout other items of interest on Amazon.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|On the planet Pandora, a mega-corporation and its military lackeys are preparing to blast the indigenous Na'vi in order to gain access to a valuable mineral.  In a last ditch effort to resolve the situation peacefully, genetically designed replicas of the natives are linked to the minds of human operators and sent into the wilderness to broker an agreement.  The stage is set for a cataclysmic clash of cultures.    Writer / director James Cameron has delivered big time with his first fiction film in ten years, which breaks new ground technically while telling a compelling and moving story.  No one injects human drama into special effects extravaganzas more effectively than Cameron.  Here, he indulges a fetish for technology that would shame Tom Clancy and juxtaposes it with a fascinating alien ecology and a noble race of arboreal aborigines.  Thankfully, he avoids heavy-handed messages with a tight focus on character, some incredible action sequences, and absolutely jaw-dropping visuals.  I hope it isn't another decade before Cameron's next film.

B001FB4VZS|5.0|I don't get to watch Smallville throughout the year, so when I purchase the set, it really is new to me. If I had been asked a few years ago what I thought the chances were that Smallville would run this long, I would have said no. Not because I don't enjoy the show, but because I couldn't see the producers, directors, writers, and cast carrying it off this long. I'm pleased to have been proven wrong. For those who loved the comics, there's enough of the original story to give a sense of familiarity; for those who want something totally new, there are elements that make you sit up and take notice.   The new villain is (OK, villains are) wonderful in both their humanity and lack thereof. Be sure to watch the filming of Allison Mack's directing debut in the extras section on the final disc.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|I've purposely waited a while to review this album. I'm a huge Muse fan, been to one concert, looking forward to my second coming up in 2010!    So this album; I like it. I gave it five stars, based upon the comparison to what's out there right now. If I had to compare it to the rest of Muse's discography, I'd probably give it four stars, but they are still my favorite band around right now.    All I can say is, give this album some time. I only really listened to Uprising and MK Ultra for a while, and didn't really care for the rest. I finally started branching out a bit, and dug Eurasia due to the Chopin tie-in. Then I started listening to the rest, and they grew on me. Basically, this is probably not an album that will grab you right away. Additionally, this is not the album to listen to first to get hooked on Muse. However, all of that said, the music here is very solid, if not completely \\"Muse-like\\" on first listen, so give it some time. It will probably grow on you too!

B001UGIIMA|5.0|Nathan D. Muir (Robert Redford) is retiring from the CIA today. However, he has learned that the agent that he mentored (Brad Pitt)is to be executed as a common criminal in a Chinese prison. I will be in 24 hours. The CIA is suspicions but always a step or two behind.<br /><br />I am not normally a fan of Redford as he has a tendency to twist films around for his own political agenda as he did with &quot;Three Days of the Condor.&quot;  However, this film is exceptional in all things, pacing, dialog, and visuals among them.<br /><br />The constant flashbacks and voice over is annoying but it is the only way to get through the story in time and preserve a little mystery on the way.<br /><br />I have seen the film a few times and can tell you that the even though Blu-ray does not contribute that much that the media is easier to navigate. I also appreciate the voice over commentary by Tony Scott the director.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I like these workouts because they are only about 30 min including the warm up and cool down.  The cool down/stretching is shorter than is ideal but you can only squeeze so much into a short workout.  There are three levels to choose from and they're each a little harder.  The workouts are intense which is how they're designed, so you can squeeze as much calorie-burning and toning as can be done into the short amount of time.    My husband and I have been doing these 6 out of 7 nights a week for the past 3 1/2 weeks, and I haven't lost any weight.  I think this is partly because I'm already in decent shape, and maybe partly because my appetite has increased a little.  If you want to lose weight, of course, you need to burn more calories than you eat.    I think people need to be somewhat careful doing this workout to make sure they're doing the moves correctly.  I've had a sore shoulder after doing level 2 and I'm not sure exactly why...    Overall, a great workout when you have limited time!  (Make sure you have time for a shower afterward, though!
B0019EXZXU|3.0|Nicely capturing the look, fashion, and atmosphere of a classic 70's British caper, Roger Donaldson's Bank Job (2008) is supposedly based on an actual bank robbery that took place in London in 1971.  The film features a group of working class mates, who looking for a big score, band together on something of a lark, to have a go at robbing  a bank.  But things are not what they seem, and with a bit of bad luck, things escalate to total chaos.  More than just a straight caper adventure, the complicated and seemingly unlikely tale, also includes political intrigue at high levels of the British government.<br /><br />Former model Martine Love (Saffron Burrows), is setup for a drug bust while returning from holiday, and contacts Tim Everett (Richard Lintern) for help.  Everett, a government official involves her in an elaborate scheme to find someone to rob a bank, in order to recover compromising photos of British royalty taken in Jamaica by one Michael X (Peter De Jersey), and locked in a safety deposit box.<br /><br />Martine runs the idea by Terry Leather (Jason Statham), an old friend who currently runs a used car dealership, and is having financial troubles.  Rounding up mates Dave Schilling (Daniel Mays) and Kevin Swain (Stephen Campbell Moore), tunneling specialist Bambas (Alki David) and front man Guy Singer (James Faulkner) the group begins planning the robbery of Lloyds Bank, located in the heart of London.  Securing the lease on an  nearby shop, the group begin tunneling towards the vault, with a lookout on the roof of a nearby building in radio contact in case of trouble.  Even while still inside looting the vault, the police are already looking for them, having been tipped by a radio operator who has overheard their communications.<br /><br />All hell breaks loose soon after the gang escapes with over four million pounds in loot, and incriminating photos of royalty and Whitehall officials.  Also missing are the records of an organized crime leader (David Suchet), who is willing to do some very harsh things to get them back.<br /><br />Although based on a real events, to what extent is unclear, as exactly what was stolen from the vault was never determined.  Why the British government, with so much at stake, would back such a dodgy venture is a complete mystery.  It seems totally insane, but apparently it happened.  How could the government expect that the thieves would not look at the photos?  Where are the negatives?  As copying records is simple, the odds of matters ending without complications was highly doubtful.  Was there really a burial vault below the building?  If so it was one fortuitous coincidence.  Many questions remain unanswered, and the film does not have a comfortable sense of closure.<br /><br />Bank Job is not as gritty and violent as some crime films from the period, but it has a retro vibe, and tells its tale without a lot of gadgets, stunts, special effects, fights or chases.  With solid acting all the way around, staying closer to reality is kind of a refreshing approach.  Some may be disappointed this isn't a balls out action extravaganza like Death Race, but Bank Job is more a nod to the past.willing to do some very harsh things to get them back.

0062515675|1.0|There are some good ideas here but none are original. It is just a rehash of the stuff that has been known for centuries. The story is very lame and the author's writing style and use of the language is so poor that it makes this book unreadable.

B002XTBE8I|4.0|While I can't agree with the decision to make these tracks available ONLY by re-purchasing an album that came out 7 months ago, the bonus tracks are (mostly) worth the hassle.  Here's a track-by-track review from a fan who's been following Shady since the first underground leaks in 1998.    Forever:  Only throwaway track, not worth the 4 minutes it takes to get to Em's verse. This belongs on one of the B-Artist's albums and not here.    Hell Breaks Loose:  A good Em and Dre track.  Dre sounds like he's trying a bit too hard to switch up his style though.    Buffalo Bill:  A solid, demented track with the lyrical quality we've come to expect.    Elevator:  Might be the catchiest hook of Em's career and the best of the bonus tracks. This was the right single to release.    Taking My Ball:  Never been a fan of the poppy, celebrity-focused songs but it's a decent track.    Music Box:  Great intro, beat and lyrics. The bells in the beat make me laugh coming out around Christmas time...    Drop The Bomb On 'Em:  My favorite track on the album. It sounds like he got hungry again but ran out of people to battle.

B0000042MY|5.0|I'm not sure whether I like this or the CD that was a remake of the sound track, but it is one of the most beautiful movie soundtracks ever (IMO).

This (or the newer release) is a must have for those loving fine music.
B000V6BE6C|2.0|I happen to love Avenged Sevenfold's first two releases. They were, and remain to be, two of my personal favorite metalcore records. Many fans backlashed when City of Evil came out, and even though I noticed it's move toward the mainstream and was initially turned off by it, it's grown a bit on me, and now I think it's pretty good. But I still feared, somewhat knew, that further commercialization would be inevitable.<br /><br />Which brings us to this point. A7X hyped this record up as their \\"heaviest\\" before it was released. Well, the guitars are more distorted (on some songs), but that doesn't necessarily make something \\"heavy\\". And ironically, for being hyped as their heaviest record, this is easily the poppiest one the band has ever recorded. And it does it's job of being pretty catchy, and some of its poppy moments are actually pretty cool. Some of it is also pretty unlistenable (particularly the ballads). Brompton Cocktail sounds like a hip-hop song for christ's sake. Apparantly this is the band trying to be \\"experimental yet heavy\\", but it's just not working. Others are just far too bland and repeditive and just feel like the same thing we've heard before.<br /><br />Ironically, the best song on this disc (and one of the best A7X songs ever) is A Little Piece of Heaven, their most experimental song yet. It sounds like a victorian/polka/circus monstrosity. It could've been a total disaster, yet this is some of the most masterful and emotional songwriting I've seen from the band in years. I think it's a great feat, and the only real gem to be found on and otherwise disappointing record.<br /><br />I know this band has left behind it's metalcore days and will most likely never go back to them, and that's just fine. But the band doesn't need to contract into a bunch of cliches and formulas (some of which they came up with themselves in previous records,) that they have nowadays. They're pretty much a radio band at this point. There isn't much to hate about this record, and if you fancy Almost Easy and most mainstream hard rock, you'll probably like this. If you don't, than keep away. That's pretty much the only recommendation I can give this record.<br /><br />UPDATE (12/29): RIP The RevAlmost Easy and most mainstream hard rock, you'll probably like this. If you don't, than keep away. That's pretty much the only recommendation I can give this record.    UPDATE (12/29): RIP The Rev

B000FVGN00|5.0|Right after Beatlemania T.Rexmania started. It's not that easy to find someone equal to Marc Bolan as composer and musician. Glam-rock started with him was invented by him, and glam-rock was Marc Bolan. Bowie came after. T.Rex gave a chance to Slade. And to Cockney Rebel (Harley was co-opted by Bolan). \\"Slider\\" definitely is one of the best and most important albums of the century. The rest of T.Rex is a MUST as well
B000VS6P9Q|3.0|Seeing that this album serves a defiantly arty film the music contained herein is especially tame.  This is partly due to the two central purposes of the soundtrack.  Firstly to represent the sheer scale of Bob Dylan's influence via the sprawl of the packaging--33 covers by a range of important musicians past and present.  This is important since for all of the ambitions of film it ended up glorifying the personas and myths over the music itself. Secondly, many of the tracks here would need to double for performances in the film, limiting the palette of sonic tricks available to the performers. So Karen O couldn't employ any of the noise freakouts her daytime band's known for, and Steve Malkmus and Eddie Vedder just ride the rails set by the originals. In the end many musicians resorted to mimic rather than interpretation.     Calexico provide the backing tracks for five songs here, and work best within the constraints set upon them.  They don't veer away from the sounds of mid sixties Americana, but every cover breaks away from its source in rich ways.  By way of contrast `The Million Dollar Bashers' provide for another five tracks and their work recalls a competent bar band.  Who would have ever guessed that putting Steve Shelly, Lee Renaldo, Tom Verlaine, Nels Cline and John Medeski together would result in such a distinction?   Their moody take on `Cold Irons Bound' is a highlight however.    Nothing here will make you throw out any of your Dylan albums, but Mason Jenning's warm rendition of `The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll', Jim James & Calexico `Goin to Acapulco',  Ramblin Jack Elliot's `Just Like Tom Thumbs Blues',  Mira Billotte's `As I Went Out One Morning' and the four other Calexico tracks come close.

0743455967|5.0|I noticed some reviewers who didn't appreciate the fact that the first section of King's book is autobiographical. I had no problem with that personally. To me it is always refreshing to see how another writer progressed from the initial submissions, myriad rejection slips, the first acceptance, and then publishing success and the building of a readership...<br /><br />King's writing advice is also very insightful and I found it practical also. The caution some have given, though, is always apropos. One of the huge cardinal rules for writers is cut, cut, and cut some more. Get rid of all excess words so that everything is significant and moves the plot forward.  When I see some of King's more recent books being lugged around in wheelbarrows, I realize that immensely successful writers get to ignore some of the taboos and their books usually still rate great reviews and big sales. So just realize that, for all King's fine advice, he is now exempt from some of the cardinal rules.

0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown really needs to try a new direction. His novels are a replayed formula that's growing increasing tired. The DaVinci code was original and thought provoking, but he keeps reapplying the same formula to every subsequent novel. Robert Langdon, check; intelligent female partner, check; singular, super-dangerous antagonist, check; wealthy benefactors, check; race against time in the course of one evening, check. Seriously, thats the plot to DaVinci, Angels & Demons, and now Lost Symbol. The only thing that changes is the city and the nature of the threat. In this case, however, the antagonist is not only singular and super-dangerous like an albino assasin, or a hired assasin, he's a totally shaven, tattooed, weight lifting mystic, but at least he's not an assasin - he just kills people at need.     I did find the historical bits about Washington DC interesting, but otherwise this is just rehashed Dan Brown. It was entertaining, but his novels are beginning to read like Madlibs. Pick a city, pick a threat, pick a womans name, pick an antagonist, and crank out a novel. I've come to expect better from Brown, and he's let me down.
0470477237|5.0|Imagine being ahead of the curve at the turn of the 20th century and capitalizing on the industrial revolution. Imagine stumbling on to Bill Gates at a mid 1970's networking event and hearing him talk about a great idea he has for helping Americans work more effectively. There is a coming revolution in marketing and communication and Erik Qualman has an instruction booklet on how to perceive and capitalize on the communication revolution. The old methods of marketing with television commercials, newspapers, radio and emails are nearing the end of their useful lifespan. Communication must be more personal and delivered in ways that can be time effective and specific to the customer's needs. Erik has written a useful and fact filled guide to understanding the emerging technologies utilizing such social media sites as Twitter, Facebook and others. Information must be handled differently for the communication age. Erik's book is one of the most intriguing and useful books I have read in quite a while. If you have heard of twitter, dabbled in Facebook or thought about finding out what the heck these funny sounding names mean, you must take the time to read this book. I am utilizing these new forms of communication in my business as a new way to get out in front of my competition. I am surprised that so few companies use SocialMedia and the companies that do seem to only scratch the surface in uncovering it's usefullness. This is one of those times, when you will wish you had taken advantage of a trend in it's infancy and capitalized on it's meteoric growth. Get this book and get on board and don't get left behind.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|Let the Right One In is a 2008 vampire movie from Sweden that received overwhelming acclaim from those who saw it. An American-ized remake is due out in 2010, probably due to the vampire-frenzy created by the awful Twilight Saga. The movie-world has been overpopulated with vampire movies lately, but this film serves as that little glimmer at the end of the tunnel; a film that uses the vampire mythology to tell it's story, without ruining the mythology. It's a film that tells a story quite similar to the one told in Twilight, except it's more poignant, more violent, and much more original.    Kåre Hedebrant plays Oskar, a 12-year-old boy with no friends; he's a strange kid, seen playing with knives and acting out violent situations, probably directed at the bullies he's frequently tormented by at school. Outside of his apartment building, Oskar meets a strange, 12-year-old girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson) who has recently moved into the building with an even stranger man (Per Ragnar). It's no spoiler to tell you that Eli is a vampire.    This is not a \\"vampire\\" film in the traditional sense of the word, however. The film is much more interested in the relationship between Eli and Oskar, who begin to bond in a strange, initially disconnected way. It uses the idea that Eli is a vampire and Oskar is a human in the same way Twilight did, but the two characters are both 12-years-old. That's where Let the Right One In really succeeds. In this relationship, there's actually a poignant representation of a relationship between two pre-pubescent children, vampire aspects notwithstanding. Both are (technically) at an age where they haven't quite reached a level of sexual understanding, but there is a certain understanding of some sort. Their relationship is much more touching and poignant that the silly Twilight drivel.    Both Hedebrant and Leandersson handle this material exceptionally well and, being the stars of the film, they're required to carry it...They do so quite admirably, especially when one takes into consideration that they're the same age as their characters.    Looking beyond that, the story is just very well told if you have a little bit of patience. The story drew me in, although don't expect all your questions to be answered right away or, in some cases, at all. Despite the relationship angle, it's still very much a horror film that exercises much restraint on blood, gore, and special effects. There's a particularly chilling use of makeup in one scene, but other than a severed limb and some blood here-and-there it relies more on atmosphere (particularly it's gray, somber setting), poetic cinematography, and a haunting musical score.    It's an eerie, effective film that is simultaneously haunting, violent, and beautiful. There are those who will find it slow and uninteresting, but it's really a quality piece of horror cinema. Anyone who has grown tired of the tired, clichéd \\"vampire-romance\\" movie will find this to be a welcoming breath of fresh air...It's an outstanding film, that truly deserves to be called \\"a work of art.\\"    GRADE: A-

1591391105|3.0|My background is as a teacher, which is in many respects identical to a management position. I am required to make connections, establish myself, and do my job diligently. This book describes many of the key points to make during a transitional period, but if you have already gone through a management transition nothing here will be new -- you probably already learned it the hard way. If, however, you are about to undertake your first major transition this is very good information. Recommended for managers entering their first new leadership position.
B001OQCV2O|4.0|I came in knowing it's Roland Emmerich and my friend had said to me before I watched the movie that he was on the edge of his seat most of the time. I was still not prepared. Emmerich laid out the characters, made them loveable enough and made the audience hang on to them every step of the way with the exception of a few blatant throw aways. With these world disaster movies, Emmerich has taken on the challenge of representing the globe and its destruction in one movie. It's still a long way before anyone can really represent the crumbling of the physical world and one family's survival in one movie, but Emmerich is probably the closest I've seen in doing so. Traveling the world with leaders, researchers and families through planes and automobiles through the fickle human urban landscape air and sea, Emmerich takes us on a thrill ride scarier and more beautiful than anything ever imagined yet.
B000B5XOYI|5.0|I got this collection 4 Christmas's ago it is an awesome set of movies & extras I recently reviewed all 4 of these movies along with the newer movies with Bale. The set has Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever & Batman & Robin unfortunately. Starting off with the 89 movie this 1 is my favorite along with The Dark Knight there the Batman movies I would watch the most. The extras on disc 2 are great hearing about pre production & post production cast & the music videoes scream awesome 80's goodness. Batman Returns, was darker & considered mean spirited but it's a good sequel the extras also are great more behind the scenes stuff it even has        The Bat_The Cat_The Penguin from 1992 a documentary that was for the movie & the Face To Face music video So Batman & Batman Returns along with the extras make it worth the purchase if you grew up with these movies like I did or read the comic like I did when you were little or still read them.
B002AT4K9Q|5.0|I have to say this is a must see movie. i have seen all movies and own all on dvd (die hard fandf fan). The day i went to watch this when it first came out we literally checked my blood pressure and it was high thats how intense i though this movie was. I thought there for a second that everything was gonna be over between paul and vin but no. Still at each others side even after everything that went down. I am hoping they come out with another so if you dont have this one go see it right now.
B0013N7AD8|5.0|So when Batman, Forever came around there were changes made it was more Family friendly read my Batman Forever review for that story. Val Kilmer played Batman & he stayed true to what Keaton had done while coming into his own style I think he's the 3rd best Batman behind Christian Bale who's behind Micheal Keaton Kilmer kept my attention & I'm ready for the hate Forever is as just as good as Returns. Disc 2 has delete scenes that helped with the movie 1 of those scenes I'm glad they cut but I think the rest should've stayed. Batman & Robin on the other hand is a kids movie it more like 60's Batman in the late 90's no extras on disc 2 can save it from 1 liner h**l. BTW how did B&R even get a special edition anyway.
B002MJV75O|3.0|The layout seems like it would be space saving and it is in a nice looking long book format.  The only main drawback is how it is put together manufacturing wise.  They put the DVDs inside the thick book pages, and they must glue the layers with the pictures on them (it is set up where there is foam in between two cardboard pieces) with the DVDs in place because when I went to pull mine out you had to do a lot of wiggling to get them out.  When I did get them out only 2 did not come out scratched and with flecks of glue stuck to them.  They should have saved themselves the creativeness and put those unsightly clear (but PROTECTIVE!) plastic disc holders over the descriptions of the episodes or something.  I was just really disappointed with having brand new discs that I was forced to scratch just to watch, and then of course had to go buy some repairing serum for some of them because (for instance the heartwrenching series finale) some of the scratches made the thing skip into oblivion.  I wish I could have my money back and pay the extra $10 it would have cost me to buy them all individually.  So take my adivice and either do that or take your own risk at pulling them out and praying that they don't come out too bad.            As for the content of the collection there are not many extra features, if you are like me and were not originally into the show that much when it was on then you also will not have the soundtrack CD, which is a nice bonus.  The extra DVD only has soem trivia and an interview with Kevin Williamson in 2009, but he wasn't around for the show after the first two seasons and so it's just a lot of what he originally intended it all to mean.  The commentaries are by Paul Stupin the producer and so he talks a lot about how much things cost and the difficulties they had making episodes, and how he doesn't like it when the actresses wear hats, but he only comments on the first and last episodes of seasons 1-4 and then the finale.  It is only slightlyinteresting.            All in all I thought this was a great price for a nice looking space saving set, but I was very disappointed in the design as it caused you to ruin your product before you even used it.  They will hopefully re-think that design.  I am going to let them know how I feel about it.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|Blu-Ray Review<br />Movie:  4/5  Video Quality:  5/5  Audio Quality:  5/5  Extras:  4/5  Overall:  4.5/5 (rounded up in total star ranking)<br /><br />We've all seen sci-fi films and stories where aliens come to Earth and lay down their dominance through superior technology and intellect.  But in the case of \\"District 9,\\" we have something else entirely.  It's a rough and brutal film, portraying aliens not as the sleek, powerful, awe-inspiring beings from heaven.  Instead, these aliens are wretched, and humans are treating them like dirt.  Therein lies the strength and power of the film; it serves to showcase modern issues concerning refugee camps, shanty-towns, and social corruption, while simultaneously demonizing humanity.  With themes like these, \\"District 9\\" proves to be a truly unique and thought-provoking experience.<br /><br />As far as the entertainment value goes, the movie is not bad.  The first half is purely rough documentary-style, with interviews and news footage cut in throughout.  Then the second half resembles an actual film with lots of action (and some very gnarly violence).  As such, the plot is interesting and moves at a decent pace.  The story is generally not bad.  Characters are alright; there are some moments where the people do appalling things or act stupid, but I believe it goes hand-in-hand with the flawed portrayal of humanity in general.  Acting and writing are adequate.  Photography is solid half of the time and a bit shaky at other times; it's pretty good all around.  Production design features some great sets, props, costumes, creature effects, vehicles, and weapons.  Music is decent too.<br /><br />This disc has good quality.  Video quality is excellent for the most part; most of the movie shows strong sharpness and detail, with excellent color, contrast, and clarity.  A few parts may appear fuzzier or softer due to different cameras or film stocks used for the \\"archival footage,\\" but overall, the disc offers the highest possible PQ overall.  Sound quality is good (DTS-HD MA 5.1).

B0018O4YT0|4.0|Dark City doesn't have the most interesting plot when it comes to science fiction movies.  There's little character development, , and the movie is pretty much a series of chases, running around that basically piles evidence about the big picture that can be summed up in a paragraph (and also loses the mystery and the jolt moments after you see it again).  How can a movie with a story like this possibly even warrant a good grade?<br /><br />Well, Dark City does, and it does so with ease, thanks to the visionary directing of Alex Proyas, the art style, some fine performances, and execution.  Excellent, excellent execution.  Director Alex Proyas was responsible for that turd Knowing, but I always thought that the directing was very good in a sense.  However, it was it's totally unimaginative in all aspects and really bored me to death (and the movie didn't even explain why those things were even there!).  Dark City, however, doesn't bore you, thanks to it's one of a kind world that it creates.  Sure, Dark City may not be any way significant or have anything to say, and it's frequent comparison, The Matrix, even said a lot more, and I find that movie to be little more than psuedophilosphy (don't get me wrong, I dig the Matrix, I just don't believe it's worthwhile social commentary like A Clockwork Orange)<br /><br />Even though the story isn't the most profound of science fiction I've seen, it's miles better than garbage like The Day After Tommorrow, Armageddon, and even Alex Proya's own Knowing.  It's not terribly complex, and the movie almost seems like a game of Myst regarding it's plot.  However, unlike, say, Knowing, Dark City features some explanations that are at least interesting and gives us some insight on the creatures, who can do all kinds of crazy things and are merely just curious.  It's not among the most memorable stories out there, but at least it has some grounding in creating interest and some insight.<br /><br />However, Dark City really elevates itself to it's execution, from it's acting to it's sound, and most of all, it's visual style. The acting is reasonable as it makes the characters believable and somewhat likeable even though they don't develop much (but actually works because of the plot), but it's the two senses that make Dark City a great movie to behold (inspired by German Expressionalist Films) Borrowing from such movies as Metropolis (1927) (though I really can't see much of the influence of M and Nosferatu, to be honest).  A special note is the effects, which are great to see.  The climax of this movie, in particular, is awesome.  I still can't believe they were able to make a movioe with a visual style like this in 1998, a decade before big budget CGI fests flooded the Hollywood market.<br /><br />Dark City does have it's influences, but it still is a good movie that should easily complement movies like Brazil, Blade Runner, The City of Lost Children, and The Matrix, and not replace them (and those movies should not replace them either).  Dark City may not have many mindblowing secrets, but it sure is a place worth visiting again and again.  This DVD makes the movie even better, as it includes 3 commentaries, a theatrical trailer, cool production shots, and two documentaries totaling an hour and a half.  It also adds fifteen minutes of footage to the movie (and movies)  Whether or not you get the director's cut or not, the trip to Dark City is worth it.<br /><br />B-from it's acting to it's sound, and most of all, it's visual style.

0307716988|5.0|It was during the 1980s that Michael Jackson the solo suoperstar emerged from being with  his brothers in the Jackson 5 to owning the world and being crowned the King of Pop. This intimate read into the life of Michael (up until he released Bad) is a candid look into the star's thoughts and feelings about fame, success, dissapointment, fear, jubliee and love and written in his own words. The book begins naturally with his childhood and as you read on, you realize that he was indeed deprived of one. Strip clubs and bars are no place for a small child to be; however, it is here where the true geninus of Michael was slowly developing. He candidly recalls watching and studying James Brown's every exact move until he came up with his own.Growing up, he was in fact very close to his brothers, often calling them his'best friends'but it is little sister Janet whom he calls his 'best friend in the family.'<br />We get an insight into his battle with his image - his became a vegertarian and stopped eating junk food and was happy his  chubby face 'slimmed out.' His dedication to mastering his craft is revealed -  'the process to make  Thriller be the best album ever became so important after Off The Wall recieved only one Grammy nomination to which Michael seemed disapointed. The book ends too soon though, and you just want to know more about him. Moonwalk showcased Michael's creative talent as not only an artist but as a singer, songwriter and dancer. In light of his tragic demise, this book is a must read for any true Jackson fan,<br />As you read page by page, you gain an insight into the Michael Jackson many of us wanted to know. Brilantly written with a touching forward by motown founder Berry Gordy.

B001TOD92C|4.0|Mickey Rourke plays an over-the-hill professional wrestler, Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson, eeking out a living in the sport when health issues force him to leave the ring and deal with life on the outside. Along the way he seeks companionship with a stripper (Marisa Tomei) past her peak who isn't convinced she's exactly overjoyed with his attention. Randy tries to become reaquainted with his daughter after many years apart, and initially is rebuffed but the girl reconsiders, and just when it appears he has something new in his life, he blows a date with her and she bitterly sends him on his way. Randy has a bad day behind the meat counter in his part-time job trying to earn a buck, and quickly realizes the only life he has is in the ring and, despite a recent heart attack, decides to return.<br /><br />The film does a creditable job taking the viewer into the make believe world of wrestling as an entertainment device. Rourke looks and plays the part convincingly. The fight scenes are sweaty and realistic; interesting also are scenes showing the wrestlers choreographing the day's fight action. This is a gritty down-to earth movie and somewhat of a downer, but worth a watch especially if you are a fan of wrestlig and/or like Rourke who seems to thrive in roles playing struggling losers. The blu-ray PQ is very good but it does have a slight grainy quality to it which I guess adds to the realism.

B002QEXN2K|3.0|John Mayer's Continuum is an excellent CD.  Unfortunately, this effort has little of the passion characterizing his last.  I think when the majority of music seems to be about casual relationships or the attempt to make them casual, then this emotional withdrawal and lack of commitment is (in his case) reflected in the music and songs as well.  John can do better when he puts his heart in it.
B002VPE1AM|3.0|The hero is a grunt of the \\"Jarhead Tribe\\" which is to say, a Marine with a young, plain face, who wears two outstanding characteristics; (1) he is paraplegic and weelchair-bound, AND (2) he is twin brother whose sibling has only very recently taken the dirt nap.  Somehow he is drafted into a hyped-up \\"Hearts and Minds\\" effort to subvert a native population on a distant planet rich in strategic minerals as a last-minute replacement for that brother.      Here we are:  We find ourselves immediately on a recognizable next-generation Marine Outpost movie of Sci-Fi flicks like the second ALIEN movie, in the company of characters that seem virtually identical to those trigger-happy guys 'n gals, and not only that, there's a familiar, older version of Ripley.  She's a chain-smoking Science virago in an orange marcelled wig, and she's running the remote-conrtrol neuron-link \\"Hearts and Minds\\" thing, with irritable ineficiency, hampered by yet a new version of the Corporate A-hole smartypants.    The first scenes of what appears to be a fairly complex exposition, take place in a series of metal pre-fab shelters and control pods overlooking a landing field and exercise yard in which newer versions of Sci-Fi Military hardware grind, zip about, hover and stomp by.  (These would be newer, larger helicopters like olive-drab dragonflies; armed, transport battle-barges like Herculese lifters, but bigger with multiple fan-wings; and occasionally large armed steel exo-skeleton walkers out of the one Ripley debuted in her hand-to-hand battle with the Alien Queen, and the morphs of those machines the defenders of Zion used in MATRIX REVOLUTIONS.  The way the movie is laid out, this military-industrial complex is to this story as the modern version of the old Western Stockade of Indians vs. Cavalry movies would be.  (Its Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan again.)  Outside of the perimeter, a dangerous and hostile world of painted savages, and creature hungry for blood.    Ripley, here called GRACE, is diffident about the paraplegic replacement (Grunt) for her prize subject in the experiment, which depends on a kind of mind-meld between the human (controlling partner) and an artificially-grown replicant of one of the savage in habitants of this new star.  All the Grunt has is a twin's identical DNA to the dead replant-subject.  He hasn't been trained!  We glimpse the large humanoid the Grunt is to animate, floating in his tank of amniotic fluid, an elongated 8 or 9 foot male like a computer blend of an Massai warrior and a leopard, with yellow eyes and a tail and not-quite super physical powers.  He is about ready to be born, or activated.  The mind of this blue humanoid will be totally animated by the mind of the paraplegic grunt while he lies unconscious and dreaming in a kind of sensory deprivation box, wearing an electrical harness.  This enormously complex system will enable the Grunt to spy on the natives and to become 'one of them.'  That's the scheme.  Once he is accepted by the tribe or one of the tribes, he will persuade them to abandon their rights to the minerals coveted by the Americans.  Meanwhile, during those times he sleeps as an humanoid savage, awake and out of his box, the Grunt will betray whatever strategic information he learns while undercover.    Now, it happens that the Grunt is not the only human being to work in this way on these people; Grace herself also travels among the natives in a syntho-body, and we learn that it was she who so disguised set up what little contact and communication there is when she opened an english language school -- the equivalent of a Missionary School -- and made some progress with the foreign culture.  What progress there was, was taken over and is now completely controlled by the Corporation, and managed by a smug, unprincipled manager, aided by his harsh, bigoted military captain.      That's the set-up.  The rest is the beautiful wallpaper of artificially contrived flora and fauna, or \\"nature\\" of this planet PANDORA.  We are plunged into that colorful scenery when Grace takes her small crew into the jungle for a brief 'drop.'  There, the Grunt (who is often called stupid or inattentive) wanders away from his mates, following his senses in a new world of plant life that bears many of the characteristics of earthly acquatic life.  Aside from the flashy and benign life-forms, he contacts some dangerous mega-forms -- the Sci-Fi equivalnts of wild dogs and rinos and elephants -- and after losing himself completely in the phosphorescent gloom during a defensive fight against predatory animals, he is contacted by one of the natives, a female, who saves him by killing one of the predators.  He is as thrilled by the presence of the female of his species, as a teen-aged football hero would be, meeting the head cheerleader at a prom.  This biological truism is apt, because we fill find out soon enough, that the female is the Chief's daughter.  And this inescapable cliche is apparent when she leads him to the Great Tree (or village) of her people.  Then, true to form, we get a bit of renactment of the Pocahantas and John Smith situation, with grunts and body language right out of Central Casting in the generations of American movies where the native princess brings the white intruder to her village.  There, of course, he will have to prove himself in order to be accepted into the tribe.  And there, true to form yet again, the daughter of the chief will be instructed to teach him.  (Sometimes it's Polynesia, sometimes Arizona.  Gary Cooper did it in Kubelai Kahn's China, in MARCO POLO.)    All this is wildly delightful to the Americans back on base, as the Grunt awake and functioning on his own out of his box, tells his story reviews maps, and begins to narrate his daily diary.  One of the things he or his alter ego will do with the native people, is to find a mount in the native way.  Now, we've entered DANCES WITH WOLVES on steroids.  You see, the Princess rides or rather flies around, on a kind of blended or synthesized version of a flying dynasauer, (or peridactyl) but with the head modified to look like one of the flesh-eating earth-bound animals.  Beautiful animation.  She rides the thing through the skies like a rodeo trick rider, high-pitched shrieks and all.  Well, obviously the Grunt has to have one too; all the other males have theirs.  So, the group sets out for \\"the land of floating mountains,\\" where enormous vine-draped clods float or hover.  Its rather like a Chinese lamdscape painting on a mirror.  There, at the very tippy-tops of these mountains, in noisy nesting gaggles, the peridactyls live and squawk, crawling about not like birds, their wings folded against their pectorals, but like repriles who must walk on four legs, their extended skin-stretched digits folded.  Like a group of irritable umbrellas, they are annoyed by the intruders.  The Grunt must choose one, or as the Princess says in her Plains Indian way, it must choose him.  Well, that's done with a struggle, but the animators have chosen an interesting, parallel way to show the collaboration between mount and rider.  The beast's crest ends with a kind of long tassel.  All the natives, male and female, wear long braided pigtails.  What the Grunt must do is touch the end of his pigtail to the tassel of the flying lizard.  Tendrils will spring from both ends, grasp each other, entwine and be covered by a kind of skin cocoon.  That is the way the natives communicate with their mounts.    This pigtail tendril device is important because it is an unique method of joining with or tuning into various beings; trees, often.  And particulaarly the Soul Tree, or thickets of them, which is an essential part of the symbolism of Earth Worship and its resultant sympatico the natives have, and Americans (the Sky People) do not.  (NOTE: the tails of the Pandorians serve no spiritual function.)    The plot lumbers on:  The Grunt is accepted into the tribe and into the princess' arms in a mercifully brief Teen Love episode.  Meanwhile, inevitably, driven perhaps by Stock Market Pressures, the Company makes the first move by buldozing a sacred grove, one day, with bulldozers as big as those used in open pit mining.  There's an armed protest, which the natives cannot possibly win, but there's a stalemate wherein the Grunt's hidden identity is compromised.  Rows with the Princess.  Rows with the Chief and the Tribal Council.  Rows when the Grung's awake in the Strategy or Briefing area.  The Corporation intends to use the US Military to attack and destroy the giant Tree (native village) in order to capture the minerals underneath it.  Grace protests.  The Grunt protests.  Pleads for time to persuade the natives.  Granted little or none, and the attack takes place.  Fleets of olive-drab flying machines attack the tree with incendiary missiles and bring it down in flames.  Many natives are wounded.  The Chief is killed.  The Princess is PO'd.  The Grunt is driven away.  But...  But...  A prfoundly butch Latina-looking pilot deserts, refusing to fire on civilians, presumably (or civilian females) and returns to base.    At Headquarters the Grunt is relieved of his duty.  But, before he can be returned to earth, the Latina-traitor-chopper jockeyette facilitates a plot whereby the Grunt, one of his buddies and Grace, will be transported back into the bush, with one of their control pod dwellings, from which, in suspended animation, they will be able to re-enter and re-animate their native bodies and sieze control of the situation.  This is done, but the action animates headquarters, and the Corporation authorizes the Military to mount a full-scale bomb attack on the center of native culture, Soul Tree Central.      Drums.  Big music.  Everybody's on the march.  The armed might of the USA takes to the air for a little Shock and Awe.  The Grunt gets a mind-flash from native history and decides to appear as the Racial hero of the Planet, riding a mega-lizard.  He finds one, its orange and huge, captures it and appears to the assembled, dispirited people, a Geronimo among men.  Like a Fazenda bodybuilder in a loincloth, they accept him as leader and the word is sent out to all the people on the planet who hurry to join in the defense of the Soul Tree.  (It is the open air equivalent of the MATRIX's Zion.)  But, after a very interesting and colorful battle, though Grace is killed and cannot be regenerated, the natives win the war and the Military Sky People are sent back to Eath, their machines of war in ruins.  The moral seems to have been that you are not permitted to take whatever you want from others simply because you want it.    (Do I have that right?  The moral, I mean.  I wonder.)  One thing particularly sticks in my mind, more than any other in this elaborate and occasionally fascinating movie.  It is this detail from the great battle scene.  There's an actor who plays the formidably muscular and scarred Marine Commandant, ol' Steel Sphincter.  He looks the part and plays it well throughout the movie.  During the final battle scenes he's shown in the command cockpit of a huge bomber loaded with incindiary explosives, standing just behind the pilot's seat, huge muscular arms folded, giving orders.  His body is shown full length, with that of the seated pilot through the machine's window.  The camera is not far away, and we can see clearly that there is an emblem painted on the side of the plane, immediately under the window.  It's where one would expect to see one such war emblem.  Strangely, it is a painted Chinese dragon in red and white, with gold stripes, and one has the impression that the Commandant is standing on the back of, or riding the dragon in the angle of attack.  This shot only appears twice, and the second time the impression is inescapable.  This is the only time in the entire movie that any political or national emblem is seen.  We know these are Americans in the mobvie, on the planes, armed and in battle uniform, but no American emblem is ever shown anywhere.  The flag is never shown.  And I wondered, although the dragon is not the national symbol of China, and is not shown on the Chinese flag, it is the universally recognized symbol of the Chinese culture.  Can that be intentional?  Are the producers of this show attempting a little subliminal propaganda here?  Is somebody trying to forge an imaginary link between China's participation in the Nigerian Oil industry (and some say their exploitation of Nigeria) and tentative rumors of dread out of Washington about Chinan's global intentions?  Hard to tell.  Easier to imagine the original art on the plane to have been the Stars 'n Stripes, fluttering, until -- who knows? -- after a screening, somebody high up in the Money end of the biz sent a memo suggested that it wouldn't be a good idea to suggest that possibly the USA once used its Military to attack a small nation for its mineral wealth.  And that might suggest Iraq to some and Arbusto.  Or Viet Nam to others.  Or the forced Regieme Change in Iran in '52, or Haiti twice in one century, or even, God!  The war to bring Christianity to the Phillipines.  (Never mind they were already Catholic.)  The Korean War?  Or the Hawaiian takeover and annexation?  Or it might just put people in mind of the fact that most of the wars of the 20th century have pitted the USA against one after another of populations of brownish people all over this world, never mind our own indiginous population, we call Indians.  Maybe by portraying Pandora's \\"Natives\\" as 9 foot blue-striped leopard people with yellow eyes, the intention is to soften or diffuse that recollection.  But that's Pandora's Elixir.  An expensive 3D illusion, doubtless, though no Gilliad's balm.  Like cheap, artificually flavored and brightly colored gin, it deadens as it insults the mind.

0199535981|5.0|In roughly three weeks Dorian Gray starring Ben Barnes comes to DVD in the UK (and I intend to buy it. I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film).  I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world.  I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting.  Now that was terrible.  And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda.  So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.<br /><br />  But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde.  I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde.  Allow me to stress that.  I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde.  My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.<br /><br />  The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty.  While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins.  He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.<br />  Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery.  As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting.  Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.<br /><br />  Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour.  The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.<br />  Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about.  He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.<br /><br />  The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil.  The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.<br /><br />  People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins.  Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.<br />  Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.<br />  However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold.  The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.<br /><br />  The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue.  Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.<br /><br />  It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.<br />  Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul.  And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.<br />  The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing thatin acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better.  This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.<br />  Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book.  There's only well written or poorly written books and The Picture of Dorian Gray is very well written.<br /><br />  This isn't an action packed thriller (though there are some intense moments).  This isn't a romance about an immortal with a teenage lover (though something of that does happen).  This is NOT Twilight.  This story actually has substance.<br />  This is more of an exploration of a character's nature and all of human nature in the process, the flaws of modern superficiality, selfishness and hedonism and the power the spiritual can still have over human consciousness.  It's sad that for all of Dorian's shallowness he had to physically see it to feel the weight of his conscience instead of just knowing what he was doing was wrong but this is the flaw of the character and the reason behind his downfall.  Dorian was a true aesthete to a dangerous extreme.  Oscar Wilde was making a statement about society that many even today either don't get or don't want to get.<br /><br />  The Picture of Dorian Gray is written in a nice flowing prose. It's written in a third person perspective novel, not first person perspective, not alternating, and certainly not epistolary (which was a very popular style of fiction writing in Oscar Wilde's time).<br /><br />  I strongly recommend The Picture of Dorian Gray.

0141191538|5.0|In roughly three weeks Dorian Gray starring Ben Barnes comes to DVD in the UK (and I intend to buy it. I have a region free DVD player and sadly there was never a US release of this film).  I haven't seen this film version yet and I know it strays from the original novel but that's not the worst thing in the world.  I've seen a version where Basil was a woman and it was set in the nineteen sixties with really bad acting.  Now that was terrible.  And there's also the 1944 version of The Canterville Ghost that turned it into World War 2 propaganda.  So I don't mind what they've done with the Ben Barnes version of Dorian Gray.<br /><br />  But since I am waiting for this adaptation I would like to write a review now for the novel The Picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde.  I LOVE the work of Oscar Wilde.  Allow me to stress that.  I absolutely love the work of Oscar Wilde.  My two favourite works of his are The Canterville Ghost and The Picture of Dorian Gray.<br /><br />  The Picture of Dorian Gray tells the story of a young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty.  While he remains flawless, a portrait of himself grows uglier every time he sins.  He cannot die unless you destroy the painting.<br />  Thanks to temptation and vice Dorian falls into hedonism and debauchery.  As he externally remains pure and untainted his soul bears the burdens of his actions as reflected in the painting.  Dorian learns the hard way that it's not physical beauty that matters but the inner beauty of one's own soul in qualities of kindness, mercy and compassion, things that he had lost along the way for selfishness, hedonism and greed.<br /><br />  Dorian's fall from grace is a road lined with wit and humour.  The story is riddled with clever epigrams (witty, short sayings) mostly said by the morally questionable character, Lord Henry.<br />  Lord Henry is a surprisingly naive character who plants bad ideas and temptations into Dorian's head while he, himself, doesn't seem to actually commit any sin he talks about.  He even has the naive notion that people of their status don't do things like murder, as if such crimes are vices only of the lower classes.<br /><br />  The picture of Dorian Gray is a very good and interesting read that talks about social conformity, morality, hedonism, and good and evil.  The messages are not heavy handed and it's an intelligently written story.<br /><br />  People of Oscar Wilde's era who called it an immoral book were made uncomfortable by Dorian's descent and lack of redemption but ultimately he was punished for his sins.  Others noticed the subtle hints of homosexuality and bisexuality in the story but these things were kept subtle as this was a Gothic Victorian novel.<br />  Many people over-estimate how much homosexual content there is in this book or they don't see it at all but in fact it was actually very subtle and you only notice it if you are looking for it.<br />  However lines such as 'The world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold.  The curve of your lips rewrite history.' - which was engraved in a cigarette case given to Dorian by Lord Henry make the relationships obvious to the astute reader.<br /><br />  The sexuality of the characters isn't even an issue.  Poor Oscar Wilde was far ahead of his time in this regard.<br /><br />  It's Dorian's decadence, hedonism and selfishness that cause his downfall and prove the moral lesson of the story; the value of the soul and inner beauty over external eternal flawlessness.<br />  Dorian might have had eternal youth and beauty but it was at the price of the eternal beauty and youth that comes from a good natured and kind soul.  And Dorian, being an aesthete could only see this transformation when his soul was physically manifested in a portrait that changed with the changing of his nature.<br />  The 1940s movie adaptation of the story (the first film adaptation of The Picture of Dorian Gray) held the hope of redemption in showing thatin acts of compassion the portrait could change for the better.  This was something the novel lacked though it is still a fine novel.<br />  Oscar Wilde was right when he said there is no such thing as a moral or immoral book.

B002PMV9FG|2.0|The quality of this DVD  was not good.....at times so dark the action couldn't be seen.  I would not recommend the wide screen because it looked like it was a copy of a copy.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|I cannot understand why anyone watch more than 30 minutes of this film. It is just pure garbage. I don't mind documentaries but why would someone make one up about alien trailer trash. The aliens were left to die in their UFO by their leaders and when the people of earth finally break in to see whats up, they discover aliens that are starving and in extremely bad shape. All this is shown as a documentary. Interviews with different people giving their take on the aliens. (BORING!!!) Finally a nitwit is assigned to move the aliens to an area that is away from the populace. Like that would happen in real life. Wake up people. If something like that was to happen then we sure as hell would not of picked a complete incompent moron to do the job. After he starts having them moved there is a lot of shooting of the aliens and of the soldiers that are trying to move them. I can't tell you more as I walked out of the theater. I felt my intelligence was insulted.
0385339607|5.0|I've read almost all of Grisham's books and through the years I've always considered The Rainmaker his best work.  I chuckled numerous times, which, to me, is a demonstration of good writing if it can get me to laugh. The protagonist was likeable and all the backstories did not detract from the main theme of David vs. Goliath in Lawyerdom. Overall a very satisfying book, more than I can say for some of his novels.  Kudos to The Rainmaker!
B0026P3G12|4.0|This album is lovely - though none of the songs are as powerful as her debut song on 'Britain's Got Talent'.  I recommend this for anyone who enjoys the purity of Susan's voice.    Going forward, here's hoping she can recapture some of that original unbridled passion in her upcoming albums.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This movie is fantastic, J.J. Abrams used 35mm anamorphic film to create a more real look than digital can provide. J.J. Abrams is a great director who knows what he's doing, and has incorporated his imense skill into this film.  It's got the fast pace of a modern day film, while the actors have really captured the old feel you remember and expect the orginal roles played by William Shattner, Leonard Nimoy, Deforest Kelley, James  Doohan, Walter Kooenig, George Takei, and Nichel Nichols to have been like earlier in life.  And Explains what made them who they are very well. While incorporating state of the art speacle affects and a buget probably 20 times what the  original series had to offer for more potential.  Chris Pine is great and has himself captured James T. Kirk better than anyone I know could do, he's hilarious, and outstandingly good at the role. And it's full of commedy. Overall, a true film that I think will make its way to being considered classic someday.  And at a steal price here on amazon.
B001U0HBPG|3.0|The human element of time is explored her in emotional<br />relationships. The old man / baby is brought up by a nursing home<br />nurse who is all heart. Benjamin  experiences life and love<br />in a way very different than the rest of us.<br />I liked the movie and it reminded me of an F. Scott Fitzgerald<br />short story about reversed time that I read in high school.<br />The plot may not be entirely new, but the make up and acting<br />is very well done.<br />We see history in a unique prospective.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I absolutely love this CD and everyone that I've shared it with is of the same opinion!
B000FIMG68|5.0|Season Two of \\"Lost\\" merits five stars.  The acting is still consistently good, the storyline is gripping, the background is gorgeous (Oahu, Hawaii, one of the most beautiful places on Earth) and the speculation is tantalizing.  There is a gothic, macabre feeling to Season Two that is hard to explain.  The films that they find in the \\"Hatch\\" are particularly strange and tantalizing.  More would be telling.<br /><br />For those who have not seen Season Two, it can safely be said that most viewers will not see where this one is going.  The plot is loaded with surprises, twists, and turns.  Not always to my liking.  I do not wish to give out any spoilers except to say that I liked Locke and in particular Michael a lot less after Season Two--I liked both in Season One. (Who didn't?).  Both seem to be firmly established as losers by the end of Season Two.  Well, who knows, maybe Season Three will redeem one or both.  It has happened before.<br /><br />\\"Lost\\" is a wierd combination of Lord of the Flies, Survivor, and any number of \\"alternate universe\\" or apocalypse pieces.  It is well put-together and addictive.  Highly recommended.  RJB.
B000002QWD|4.0|Look, let's face it. If you celebrate Christmas and listen to Christmas music, odds are you own this album. It's a classic. This album has been around for decades, and Bing Crosby's 'White Christmas' (as it's now being issued; used to be called 'Merry Christmas') has become perhaps the most classic and essential Christmas album on the market.     And look at the track listing! 'White Christmas,' 'Silent Night,' 'Adeste Fideles (O Come All Ye Faithful),' and 'Jingle Bells' are all Christmas standards, and Bing is largely responsible for that. They all appear on this album, as well as 'It's Beginning to Look a Lot Like Christmas' and 'Christmas in Killarney,' two songs that should be standards but aren't.    But, I give this four stars. Why, you may ask?    Well, in 2009, 'White Christmas' is still a classic, but it's becoming outdated. Nowadays, there is '20th Century Masters - Christmas Collection: The Best of Bing Crosby,' which has the original 1942 recording of 'White Christmas,' as well as an older version of 'Silent Night.' Or, for those who want it all, there's the two disc collection, which has the remake and the original version of 'White Christmas,' everything on this album (minus 'Faith of Our Fathers,' which, in all fairness, is not a Christmas carol) and plenty more. I recommend seeking that album out if you are a Christmas music purist.     And that leads to another complaint. When this was first released in the 1950s, they had to use the 1947 remake of 'White Christmas,' because the original 1942 master was severely damaged. While that version is great, don't get me wrong, with the compact disc reissue, I would have personally added the original '42 version as opposed to the '47 version offered here and the one that gets the most radio play. But that's just me personally.    Overall, as many previous reviewers have stated, it's just not Christmas without hearing at least one Bing Crosby Christmas carol. And many people will tell you that you don't havea Christmas CD collection without 'White Christmas' in your possession. And, quite frankly, I can't say I disagree.     Highly, highly recommended for anybody who likes Bing Crosby or just Christmas in general. This CD is truly a must own if you celebrate Christmas and want some carols to deck the halls with. But, just keep in mind there are better options nowadays.     ENJOY!!!
B001FB4VZS|4.0|This was a great DVD set. Think it was the weakest of all the season but still love the season and show and can be proud to release this dvd. Not a big fan of the new design of the case because my broke already. Prefered the old one but overall great DVD. 8/10
B0015HOFZI|5.0|[[ASIN:B0015HOFZI Sony PS-LX300USB USB Stereo Turntable System - Black]]  I like this product. I had a lot of old records here and there taking up space. This product is very easy to use with the soft ware provided.  If you do not have amps or a receiver you can plug this device into you tv av jacks for great sound.  The final product from the record to the computer was great. But you have to lift the arm after each song is recorded to record it seperatly into your media files..or else the entire record records as one long song on your media files.
B00005QGAT|4.0|First off R.I.P. Michael Jackson. Next good CD 10 songs on the CD and like 9 of them. Pretty good CD by my standards. Clasic CD by MJ and CD's just kept getting better. 9/10
0440178002|5.0|I read this book in 1975 and thoroughly enjoyed it.  all these many years later, I can recall vividly episodes in the novel and even almost word-for-word descriptions of some scenes.  This past summer I bought this same paperback to replace my older banged-up copy.  And then I just bought this book as a gift.  BEWARE!:  This is a down-sized version of the book I had just purchased this summer.  The print is unbelievaby small.  It is unconsconiable that a publisher put a book with so small a print on the market.    My advise is to get a larger format book.  Your eyes will appreciate it and so will you.  This a a story not to be missed.
B002ECJZ76|5.0|This is a great movie telling the story of how Santa came to be in a non-animated fashion.  While the element of death is present in the movie, it is done in a sensitive way as to not scare younger children.  I think the theme of this movie will also help children to understand others and to accept kids who have a different situation than them.  As well as adults to help others out in need. It is very touching and I really enjoyed it from beginning to end.
B0029O08WA|5.0|I checked this soundtrack out of my local library on a whim before I'd even saw the movie, and ended up liking it so much that I bought my own copy. The songs perfectly capture the mood and feeling of the novel New Moon. There is not one bad song here - it is one of those rare soundtracks that not only enhances the film for which it was created, but can also stand on its own.    I'd say that the collection of songs is on the eclectic, indie side - the whole together paints a dark, hauntingly beautiful musical landscape that fits its story so well.     One of the best soundtracks I've heard in recent memory, and I have listened to it for several months now and have not tired of it. Kudos to the musicians  who wrote these great songs and to those who envisioned and put together the soundtrack. Glad I picked it up - it turned out to be a true gem.
B002JIOQCO|5.0|If you heard first wolfmother album you would know that it is worth a listen and that this band brings real rock n roll back to life, but they broke up, everyone was disappointed, but then with the new line up,except for the singer/guitar player they are back with a more rocking more heavy riffed stoner album, you can head bang to. it includes in it all the best from the rock music could. from soft ballads such as far away to stadium rock songs like white feather and head banging new moon rising, cosmic egg or pilgrim! If you love rock, you would definatelly enjoy this album.
B002QNGKGW|4.0|I liked the family-man spin that Dexter has taken in this episode, but I saw the \\"shocking finale\\" in episode twelve coming from this very telling beginning. Not to spoil anything, but Dexter should know that his dark passenger will eventually cause nothing but horror and grief for everyone around him. To have a family in that situation with what he does is probably the most evil thing he does on a regular basis.<br /><br />On that note, however, it has been suggested that if the right frontal lobe of the brain is either underdeveloped or has some sort of damage, as is suggested in the last season's full body scan, it would cause a person to become disassociated with feelings and conscience. Be this as it may, it seems to me that Dexter has PLENTY of emotions. He just lacks the ability to identify them correctly. Just like a person born with a heavy callous over a part of the skin, there are still nerves going to it. If you shave away the callous you can feel just like anyone else.<br /><br />This season's closer should be something that finally shaves off a bit of Dexter's emotional callous; because if it doesn't he's going to wind up dumping his entire family into the bay.<br /><br />And it really, REALLY sucks that Showtime hasn't released this season for sale online. I have Christmas credits to spend, and I wanted this, but Showtime says \\"Bah, humbug! Subscribe to Showtime and pay regularly to watch all of our programming, not just the one program you really WANT to watch! Dexter's the only show people really want to watch (and pay for), so we'll hold Season 4 hostage as long as it takes to get you suckled down on the tate.\\" I don't care about Californication, Nurse Whatever, The Tudors or any of that other stuff. Give us Dexter NOW!
B002VH7P4O|4.0|I have the Mono box set, plus three re-mastered stereo CDs (Abbey, Pepper's, Let It Be). I have listened to them all on my Sennheiser HD-485. I also have the Beatles:Rockband game with every downloadable album to date (Abbey, Pepper's, Rubber Soul). Last but not least, I also have many Beatles LPs and 45's (some in original mono) that I still listen to from time to time.     When I received this USB apple as a Christmas gift I thought it would be a bit redundant and wouldn't add much more to what I've already had (or heard). But after listening to just one album (Abbey), I was completely blown away. The clarity and details are simply amazing. Subtle things that I could hear on the remastered CDs are now even more pronounced. And I'm hearing even more sounds that I've never heard before, tape hiss and all.     I'm listening to Pepper's as I write this. And my opinion about this product has not changed. The spaciousness and intimacy are immediate. If you thought Mr Kite sounded good on the new CD, wait til you hear it in FLAC. I suppose this is about as close as we can come (yet) to being there.    On the negative side, there are gaps between the songs in the Abbey Road medley that you don't hear on the LP or CD. Extremely annoying and distracting! Perhaps there's some configuration or player issue that I'm not aware of?     Anyhow, I am somewhat disappointed that the mono set was excluded from this wonderful package. What a shame really. Otherwise this would have been the mostest perfectest Beatles music collection to date.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|I dig this album. Not all of it, but well over half which, these days, is saying quite a bit. M79 is a great track, as are some of the others mentioned throughout these comments.   What I don't get is why all the \\"college freshman-sounding\\" angst? Some of the best albums I've ever heard were introduced to me as a college freshman. That's one of the things that makes being a college freshman so great. Yeah, this album would've fit in nicely to that time in my life (I'm far removed from college, sadly), but what of it?  I dig what Vampire Weekend is trying. The lyrics are often a bit random, but interesting; the rhythms are often unique (for this genre at least); they don't take themselves too seriously.   I'll definitely check out their stuff in the future.
B000PMFS2I|4.0|It's hard to believe that Dutch director Paul Verhoeven actually had serious intentions when making this film. I can only guess that the Duch must have a very different sense of humor to not \\"get\\" the joke with this film. Or Verhoven just simply blindly accepted whatever screenwriter Joe Eszterhas threw at him in light of the success they both had with Basic Instinct. No matter, if you love \\"so bad, they're good\\" films, you'll love this. With it's over-emphasis on sex and nudity along with some of the most enept and over-the-top dialogue you've ever heard, you can't help but be entertained.    The story is simple, out-of-town girl (Berkley) comes to Las Vegas to try and get in as a big league showgirl dancer. Only she ends up finding out that the backstage politics are a little more than what she was prepared for. She encounters the pressures to sell herself, backstab and suck-up (almost literally) to get ahead. As stupid and ridiculous as the plot is, it's really not that far off from reality. Back in the 80's, I dated a girl in San Diego that once worked as a showgirl in Vegas and she told me some pretty hairaising stories much like what you see here.    The acting is about as bad as the dialogue, campy, over-the-top and I love it! We see Berkley taking her frustrations out by violently squirting ketchup on her french-fries! I didn't think that was possible, but she can do it! About the only casting that's smart here is Gina Gershon who plays the illustrious and egocentric bisexual Cristal Connors, the \\"star\\" of the show, who considers all the other dancers as merely hand-maidens. She plays it like some evil intergalactic queen in a bad sci-fi movie. Of course Gershon is a natural at playing Wicked Wandas with those glaring eyes and crooked diabolical grin. Somehow I think she knew exactly what kind of film this was going to end up being, because she plays it to the hilt.    The film is without a doubt destined to be a cult classic along with Rocky Horror and Beyond the Vally of the Dolls. The DVD here is pretty much the same that came out earlier only without the shot glasses, the \\"pin the pasties on the showgirl\\" game etc. An audio commentary with Showgirls fan and documentarian David Schmader is included. Only beef is no deleted scenes, and we know they exist. Calling Criterion please!    So go out and pick this up, watch it and stick it in the movie shelf next to The Defilers, Rocky Horror, Linda Lovelace for President and whatever \\"good trash\\" cinema you have have!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|If you haven't seen these DVD's yet buy them now.  Everyone that I have talked to about this series says that they are phenomenal.  Usually when you see a new nature show they rarely have anything this interesting, or more unique.  Most nature lovers have seen most of the creatures filmed today.  This is not true with this series.<br /><br />This is a set that you want to watch on Blue ray.  The HD really makes a different experience.
B000FA57RG|5.0|Great CD, sounds amazing live.  Reminds me of this tour I saw in Atlanta!
B001P5Q6FC|5.0|Maybe not their best album but one of the years best.  I would describe it as a cross of palaces and sacrament.
0312370849|4.0|I'm always wary of \\"book club\\" and \\"Oprah\\" type books, but when I read the subject of this novel, I ordered it -- and read it through. The ending borders on \\"chick lit\\" and is a little pat, but the subject at the center of this novel -- the round-up of Jews in Paris by the French police -- in 1942 was a subject about which I knew little and wanted to learn more. Told alternately in the past and the present, the author opens up some painful memories for the French, a subject which, I understand, they are MOST reluctant to remember, much less discuss.<br /><br />Sarah's character is beautifully drawn and the reader is with her every minute. About half way through this, I knew what was going to happen to the contemporary character, so I think this could have been done better, but it is still very much worth reading, very much thinking about, and yes, worth remembering.
B001R4MEYI|4.0|I see all these magazines and people givning this the best metal album of the year.  Metal?  really?  sounds like rock album to me.    anyways its a good rock album.  I just wished mastadon would have progressed the other way and back to metal.
B002RSDW80|3.0|I think Amy Adams is a fine actress -- but this is -- and I wish it had been totally -- Julia Child's story. Julie Powell tried something that was -- OK, interesting, but also pretty self-indulgent. And maybe if I hadn't read that her new book is a tell-all about her now-failed marriage, I would be less opinionated. But then again...<br /><br />I wish Ephron, who is a terrific director, had chosen to make \\"Julia Child in Paris\\" and left Julie out of it. Meryl Streep and Stanley Tucci are just out of this world and I would have loved to have seen a movie just about Julia and Paul -- if you've ever read not only this book, but the several bios of Mrs. Child, you'd know there is enough material for four hours, let alone two.<br /><br />More Meryl, more Julia!
B002VPE1AM|2.0|You on that stuff, man? Cause 5 stars... I love great sci-fi and fantasy. BEST movie in a long time??? No. Just considering sci-fi, \\"District 9\\" BLOWS Avatar away in every way, including special effects. Dialog, plot, special effects(!)character development, editing, music -- thumbs down.<br /><br />The characters are simple and boring. The dialog is soo unbearably cliche and lame...I'm not a big fan of the U.S. Marine Corps but what a Hollywood liberal slap-in-the-face. Not that real Marines should care and, btw, when people have a job to do it helps for them to LOVE it and be enthusiastic. Also, if it happens to be a job that risks your life and require you to be brutal, your going to create psychological defense mechanisms to deal, or you'll crack. That's why Marines are gung-ho and crazy. They murder people for a living. The aliens are as one-dimensional as the Blackwater/Marines. Just like as is fashionable these days with American Indians and all tribal peoples, they are presented as simpletons full of pure goodness in touch with nature. This romantic, fictional view is not truly respectful of native people. Never mind this hippie alien dialog... but at lest they don't refer to a made-up metaphysical realm --their planet really is conscious and communicating with them, unlike Earth to our New Age humans.<br /><br />These scientists... well if they care about Earth Mother, time to pack it in because their whole project and science is built on exploitation of nature. Need natural resources and money from those resources as corporate- cliche jerk Giovanni Ribisi rightly points out. But, so maybe we can exploit the people and Earth more nicely, with a happy face. You bribe the locals, build some stuff for them, speak their language. \\"Win hearts and minds\\". Which is what corporations would typically prefer anyway when it is possible. When not, well THEN you call in the Marines and make the natives bad guys. Same old story. Same old story. If you love the Gaia theory (at least it's real on Pandora)and New Age philosophy this will be a movie you will love and cherish till it is time to return to mother spirit or and \\"give back your energy\\" with the ancestors.<br /><br />Avatar is such a simplistic, ham-fisted message movie I was amazed. Are we supposed to actually be moved and care about it's \\"message\\" or just enjoy the effects?? In this manichean fairy-morality tale military and business = bad, scientists are...meh...kinda neutral, and indigenous generic Native American/African/island peoples aliens are = good. Characters and roles all one-dimension. Do people need this kinda propaganda and oversimplification of reality to actually care that in reality right NOW WE ARE DESTROYING THE REAL WORLD?? Who actually cares? You know the the oceans are being so over-fished Japan is having trouble getting it's sushi? Hip, moral liberals should care about that *especially*. That should be enough to put down that micro-brew and get busy! (Or never-mind Obama is in office, so it's all good.) Your part of the problem, just like Sigourney Weaver. But seriously, right now mining companies are removing _entire mountains_ in Appalachia. It's called, fittingly, \\"mountain top removal\\". And Avatar points out Iraq so heavy-handedly I had to laugh. Jesus that dialog. It was insulting. It was for the children I guess. Or Fox News views. Anyway, so a war in Afghanistan is escalating! C'mon let's do something. Or maybe just watch a multi-million dollar Hollywood movie and pretend we did.<br /><br />Obviously the major draw is eye candy, as always. Avatar special effects are supposed to \\"change how movies are made\\". Starts off bad: the space ship? OK, not looking real. Pretty flat. The aliens looked really cool: about as real as CGI can look in 2010 (not including the amazing District 9 pawns which are incredible) ,but I liked their design. I skipped the 3-D but have repeatedly heard it isn't too fantastic. The Pandora rain forest often looked like an almost real CGI rain forest. Some of the trees and plants were amazing, especially the tribe's home. The animals of Pandora aren't too absurd, except for the giant beast with a couple of feathers it's back. The whole world should be called planet Psilocybin, but that makes it sound cooler than what it is. The night time shots with all the glow-in-the-dark, tripy black-light lifeforms is very pretty, but crossed the line into kitsch.<br /><br />It all looked familiar --plot, characters, imagery. But not in good way, the way a good myth hits deep with archetypes. Avatar has been compared to a children's cartoon called \\"Ferngully\\". Calling the planet Pandora is lame and clues you into how much care and originality was given to the story.<br /><br />Actually, hippies and New Agers and ESPECIALLY environmentalists and anti-war activists deserve much better than films like \\"Avatar\\".<br /><br />2.5 stars for Avatar.Some of the trees and plants were amazing, especially the tribe's home.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|Here's the irony: Stereo was conceived to simulate a live performance, but it is The Beatles in Mono mix of the respective albums that deliver the closest approximation to a live performance. I own the re mastered stereo mixes and the re mastered mono mixes as well as the 1987 CDs. Listening to The Beatles in Mono is startling. The mono mixes ultimately and substantially deliver a dynamic Beatles performance. Beyond the technical aspects already discussed, it is the listening experience, with a decently good compact disc system, that makes it easily discernable that the mono mixes are superior to the stereo mixes of the ten original mono albums. The Beatles in Mono - What a joy!   Don't be \\"penny wise and pound foolish\\". Spend your money wisely. At Amazon's price of $199.95, buy \\"The Beatles in Mono\\" and supplement it with \\"Abbey Road\\" and \\"Let It Be - Naked\\" in stereo. You will hear The Beatles as you have never heard them, but as they meant for you to hear them.
B002RSDW80|3.0|Okay maybe this is just my prejudice because I read the book (Julia Child's \\"My Life in France\\"), but lately I'm starting to think that Nora Ephron has passed her creative peak and her movies just seem to follow this production checklist of music, cinematography, Meg-Ryan-cookie-cutter heroine, etc... because this movie just fell flat for me.    With Julie's setting for example, I really didn't get the feeling of being in a run-down Brooklyn apartment over an ancient pizzeria (in an ancient neighborhood). Nor did I really feel the tension that supposedly led their marriage to a \\"break\\".    Then there was the portrayal of Child's life. In the book, her journey read like a crisp and inspiring retro breeze, and could've been portrayed with a lot more weight and artistry on the big screen.    It would've been nice to find out why Child was so upset with such a fan. But I did read one editorial in which the reviewer rants that Julie didn't view Child's book so much as inspiration for learning and appreciating the \\"art of French cooking\\" (and living), in which the philosophy seems to have more to do with taking things patiently so as savour life's pleasures and possibilities... but rather she was simply using the book as a personal finish line, in the more American vein of finding self-worth and adequacy through accomplishing specific tasks within a certain amount of time.    That reviewer's theory seemed to fit as an explanation, and with that in mind it probably isn't possible to give much weight to the movie, since the two women's stories really don't parallel at all... so then, coming back to my first point, it just becomes another heap of over-produced fluff, like Bewitched.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I purchased this for myself and for a friend.  I absolutely love it!!!  Her voice is amazing!  I do agree that \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" lacks the \\"wow\\" that she captivated the world with during her original performance, but it is still stunning.  I only wish the album contained \\"Memory\\".  My friend also informed me that she has played this cd constantly since I gave it to her for Christmas.

B00127RAJY|4.0|I usually only run and completely neglect abs and strength training. Doing this workout (I'm still on Level One after 3 weeks) made me realize how much I neglect everything but cardio. I've already noticed great strides in my body. I can always find 20 minutes in my day which makes it the perfect workout to do from home. Jillian may not be \\"entertaining\\" but my focus is doing the workout and what she says/does is little motivation to me. If you cannot find your own inner motivator, you will probably have a hard time running a couple miles on the road, too. That can get boring if you cannot find your inner voice to keep yourself going.

Any little boy or girl who loves cars will be thrilled with this set!
B0026P3G12|5.0|I Dreamed A Dream -the debut CD of Susan Boyle, the unusual heroine of one of the most amazing, inspirational, and wonderful fairy tale stories of the year 2009. By this time, I believe there are very few people in this world who follow the entertainment news and those who don't that have hot heard about Susan or have not heard Susan singing.  And now - the gift for all lovers of good songs and  amazing singing that goes directly into a listener's soul, Susan's first CD with 12 beautiful melodious songs, many of which have been  loved by millions for years and which Susan made her own by the power of her talent, by the warmth, depth, and artistry of her voice. I received the CD as a Holiday present, and once I started listening, I could not stop until the last song was over and then I listened to my favorites again. What a talent the woman has. How lucky we all are that she finally decided to share her talent with the world by participating in the Britain's got talent competition. I am grateful to her for overcoming her fears, for getting out to that stage on January 21, and for singing in front of quite skeptical audiences who did not take her seriously when she first appeared on the stage but who were transformed after the very first sound of her voice. What a moment it was -the triumph of a real talent that is the gift so rare and precious. I like all twelve songs recorded by Susan, but there are few that moved me very deeply.  Among them the one that introduced Susan to the world and gave the disc its title, I Dreamed A Dream;  Wild Horses - who would think that one of the most beloved Rolling Stones' songs may sound so differently and so hauntingly after all these years;  always bringing the tears to my eyes Amazing Grace, and her best song, IMO, Cry me a River. The song of love forever gone that brought tears and sadness, a jazzy blues ballad, \\"Cry Me a River\\" was originally written for Ella Fitzgerald by Arthur Hamilton in the beginning of the 1950s.The song has been recorded and covered by many famous singers in many languages. Some of the most popular besides the original performer, Ella Fitzgerald, are Julie London who brought sensuality and class in the sentimental lamenting song and Barbra Streisand whose version sounds a bit aggressive. Susan Boyle's version is incredible. This was the song I kept coming over and over while listening to the CD. There is so much in Susan's performance of Cry me a River; her voice is perfect for the song of memory, regrets, and dignity.<br /><br />I should agree with the reviewers who expected a little more diversity of the CD content. I would love to hear Susan singing few dynamic rhythmic songs. I believe she will bring her talent and unique individuality in any song she chooses to sing. But I hope she will come up with many more albums and they will be as much pleasure as her  first one. This year was a very special in Susan's life - she has moved from the total obscurity to the very bright spot in the world of music. Her video has broken all records on YouTube. Her first CD has been the most pre-ordered in the history of Amazon.com. She is famous but I wish her be happy and never lose this magic spark inside that makes her singing so incredible.has been recorded and covered by many famous singers in many languages.

0385504225|1.0|Not to rehash what others have said, but in a nutshell, the big secret isn't a secret at all. Langdon goes through all these efforts to decipher a legendary, mythical pyramid and it points to ... an everyday object. It's like Brown had a good idea (sort of) for a new symbologist book, but nothing in mind for the end. When he got there, he just threw something in that sort of fit with what he'd already written. Without totally spoiling the book, the end is a dramatic letdown, and a waste of time.
B000002UVX|5.0|\\"Band of Gypsys,\\" in my opinion, ranks within the top two live albums of all time (the other being The Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\").  It's interesting that this album is the result of a contract dispute between Warner Brothers and Capitol Records.  Apparently Jimi was forced to deliver an album to Capitol, and for something that began as a necessity, I'm amazed at how much heart and soul was put in to the music.    \\"Who Knows\\" and \\"Machine Gun\\" are two of the best pieces Jimi ever recorded.  Period.  The guitar solos, the pounding drum rhythm brilliantly laid down by Buddy Miles, and the haunting vocals make for an unbelievable track.   To me, this is the only Jimi Hendrix album that truly showcases his talent.  No drug-fueled, hippie-pleasing nonsense, no smashing of amps or setting things ablaze.  Just Jimi playing his guitar extremely well, and believe me, that alone is mind-blowing.      Jimi is at his absolute best here.
B002SJIO54|4.0|Sometimes the best way to describe a situation is to come at it from the side. Rather than comment directly on what is happening, use an allegory to describe a situation and discuss it. Such is the case with DISTRICT 9.<br /><br />Set in the not too distant future, the story is pieced together at first via news footage and interviews, later on depending on the standard filmed story. An alien spaceship hovers over South Africa, motionless in the air. A team is dispatched to enter the vessel and they discover a breed of alien that seems a cross between an insect and a crawfish.<br /><br />Called prawns due to their bottom feeding nature of scavenging for food, the folks of Johannesburg treat the aliens with a combination of fear and resentment. The story continues as we learn of the aliens settling into an encampment of their own, a shanty town that houses both aliens and a group of Nigerian thugs who trade weapons and run their own crime ring out of District 9.<br /><br />Enter Wikus Van De Merwe (Sharlto Copley), an employee of MNU (Multi National United).  A Halliburton type group of weapons dealing/mercenary styled executives, they've employ both soldiers and Wikus types, office workers who believe in what their doing with no clue what goes on behind the scenes. Wikus is put in charge of a plan to relocate the \\"prawns\\" from the shanty town they're in to a new location built with huts for them all.<br /><br />Going door to door to get their required signatures for the eviction notices, Wikus and his group face everything from attack to verbal confrontation with the \\"prawns\\". Unbeknownst to him, one alien is in the midst of formulating fuel to power a shuttlecraft to leave the planet. Wikus confiscates the fuel but accidentally is exposed to it. As the film progresses, Wikus personal DNA begins to alter and he starts to take on the aspects of the aliens, watching as first his hand changes into a claw and moving forward.<br /><br />Of course MNU sees this as an opportunity since the weapons they confiscated from the aliens won't work when held by a human. It seems there is something in the genetic make up of the aliens that causes the weapons to work. Wikus becomes a guinea pig of sorts, used to make the weapons work and kept away from friends and family in a science outpost.<br /><br />Fearing for his life, Wikus escapes and seeks out the alien he encountered with the vial of fuel for help. He discovers what it was that changed him but also the fact that the only fuel left, the only way for him to receive help, is to recapture the fuel container at the research station he was in.<br /><br />Should the pair be successful, Wikus may be able to be changed back, the alien return to his home world with his young son and the \\"prawns\\" finally be treated as something other than outcasts. A battle between the mercenaries employed by MNU and Wikus in a souped up mechanical suit add some action to the tale as we wait to find out what the future holds for all involved.<br /><br />The story about the mistreatment of those that are different from us is universal to every country in the world. Perhaps that accounts for the popularity of this film when it was released. As Wikus becomes one of them, he is exposed to their treatment and how they are perceived. By becoming one with them, he learns in the process and his outlook on his life and the world around him changes.<br /><br />As with all great science fiction films, the story is the centerpiece but the surrounding portions add to the whole. The special effects are magnificent, offering us a look at an alien life form that looks as if it is right there, shot on camera without the use of effects. It makes the story all the more believable. And the performances by stars that are relatively unknown in the US make them seem real as well. While grounded in sci-fi, the film makes it seem as if it's taking place now.<br /><br />Slow going at first, we are given a look at a world we think we known inhabited by creatures we do not. It takes a bit of time to learn about them as well as about ourselves. And in the end, the story we witness makes us think a little bit more about how we react to others. At least let's hope that those who see the film do.as well as about ourselves. And in the end, the story we witness makes us think a little bit more about how we react to others.

B002UXRH10|2.0|This album is a waste of talent. Why is it that she feels the need to curse so much? She may as well do secular hip hop now. She has a great voice and she has a talent that sets her apart from others. So why the need to lessen her music with all the swears. This is such a waste.<br /><br />PS: If my review offends you, then you know how I felt listening to this album.

B001JNNDBA|4.0|I have to admit picture quality is not the best for BD standards but who cares, this movie is great and I love all the topics (time travel, tangent universe, CellarDoor, deus ex machina, etc). The main difference from the DVD version is that you have the Theatrical Cut and Director's Cut on a single disc, that's all. If you already have DD on DVD don't buy the BD. The extra material is just okay, no more no less.<br /><br />Btw, that guy from the \\"darkomentary\\" is a total freak!
B002HHPVHQ|1.0|The title of this book is completely misleading. It offers no insights into the failure of Lehman, just the story of one of its employees. A total waste of time.
0740785508|5.0|I must admit, I was taken aback by the subtitle of \\"How to Paint What Doesn't Exist\\".  But that is just my own personal slant on imagination.  I believe we all have our own equally imaginative abilities, and for those of us artistically inclined, we shouldn't need guidance on imagination.<br /><br />However, this only lasted for a fraction of a moment as I dug deeper into the book.  Gurney is a very talented artist, and those of you who love Dinotopia will know of his work.  I actually am not a fan (only because I don't watch much television) but I have seen his work without knowing the name of the artist behind it.  This book will further teach or reinforce the principal of observation.  If we can perceive and understand what gives an object or image solidity, then we can take that knowledge and transform it to our imagination.<br /><br />I am a self taught artist and have always done things \\"my way\\".  I was surprised to see he used so much life referencing and maquettes.  But perhaps they do this heavily in art schools?  I find it quite enlightening of course, it can save us time when we have an image of how shadows and lights fall on a given object, but can't quite recall how it falls here and there, or how the back cast from one light source highlights the edge of a shadow and how it creates the complementary color.  It is also intriguing to see how involved Mr. Gurney's setups are, from not just simply maquettes, but sometimes full and even miniature set style setups.<br /><br />This is a great resource for those artistically inclined who are still enamored with the old ways of painting with paints and not just doing things digitally.  I believe this book would be appropriate for beginners as well as anyone beyond.  Appropriate for beginners because it underlines the fundamentals of transferring what you see before you, to what your eye and your hands can render unto paper, that which is observation.
B002MW50KO|5.0|Who'd have thought it? Believe it or not, 2 years before its release, I was jokingly thinking \\"What would a Christmas album by Bob Dylan sound like?\\" My idea was nothing like this. And that's a good thing, at least for me. But I digress.    Bob opens with \\"Here Comes Santa Claus\\" with a sweet sounding glockenspiel. Next is \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\" with some pleasant violin melody. Bob has some fine harmony backups, especially on \\"Oh Come All Ye Faithful.\\" It almost sounds like the Andrews Sisters are backing him up! \\"Christmas Blues\\" sounds more like something you'd expect from Mr. Zimmerman, with some bluesy harmonica. If you're having some hard times at Christmas, it can almost bring a tear to your eye, as could his rendition of \\"Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas.\\" \\"Must Be Santa\\" is like a rock and roll polka, complete with an accordian arrangement, a Mitch Miller-style chorus and reindeer named after ex-Presidents! Thanks, Bob, and we hope you have a merry Christmas, too!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was a very interesting and adventure filled book and I couldn't stop reading once I started. I literally read it in 1 day and I have nowread it 3 times! I don't recommend this book for younger readers because it is based on murder and survival in harsh conditions, I read it when I was 12. Everyone in my class loved this book and almost all of us would read it again. (I used my moms Kindle to write this review.)
B002VPE1AM|5.0|AVATAR is a tough movie to review and perhaps even tougher to put a score on.  On one hand, it is technically (or technologically, if you will) one of the most stunning, game-changing movies you'll see.  It makes you feel what audiences seeing the original KING KONG must have felt...a sense of what was POSSIBLE in movies that you never knew before.    On the other hand, the story it tells is pedestrian and predictable in many ways.  Remember how James Cameron's TITANIC took  a lot of heat for having a poor script?  AVATAR is much the same...while its romantic scenes aren't as painful as the ones George Lucas penned for Natalie Portman and Hayden Christensen in the latest STAR WARS epics...they aren't exactly convincing either.    If the movie were measured purely by storytelling, acting and all the conventional items we usually judge movies by, it would be a solid 3 out of 5.  If we were to judge it purely on technical merit, it's perhaps a 10 out of 5.  (And while I'm thinking of it, let me say right here and now that this movie MUST, MUST, MUST be seen in 3D.  In most movies, even with today's current excellent technology, 3D is a \\"nice\\" add-on.  It's integral to the enjoyment of AVATAR.  So get out there and see it in a theater!)    AVATAR is set about 150 years in the future.  Earth has apparently become a bit of a desert, and so mankind (or at least a corporation eerily similar to Halliburton and a military eerily similar to the one liberals apparently think Dick Cheney would run) has invaded the planet of Pandora, where a rare mineral named Unobtanium exists in abundance.  Problem is, the Humanoid species on the top of the food chain there, the Na'Vi, live in a giant, wondrous tree that is right on top of the biggest deposit of Unobtanium.  In the best tradition of all movies where the clumsy, conniving, greedy and bloodthirsty white men yearn to trample over the differently-colored, close-to-the-earth natives in order to earn money, AVATAR draws no ethicallygray areas.  The Na'Vi are 100% the good guys, and the military/corporate interests are bad.  In the middle is a tiny group of scientists who yearn to study and learn from the Na'Vi and Pandora, and to perhaps obtain a sort of peace between the two species.  A diplomatic solution (as someone says).  The scientists, led by Sigourney Weaver in a strange, tone-deaf  performance, are interested in building schools, learning the language and seemingly don't  understand that the company's patience is at an end.  Why build a school if it doesn't result in a pile of Unobtanium?    Into the mix, we throw a paralyzed soldier, whose brother was one of Weaver's team.  He had been about to have an Avatar grown from him when he was killed.  So his brother (Sam Worthington) is talked into taking over the Avatar, and using it to befriend (and spy on) the Na'Vi.  What's an avatar?  It's basically an empty Na'Vi that has been created by blending DNA from the Na'Vi with the DNA of the specific human destined to use the avatar.  Once the avatar is fully grown, the human can \\"inhabit\\" it by having his consciousness transferred to it.  Worthington agrees to do this when his colonel (Stephen Lang, in a gloriously over-the-top performance) promises that his legs will be repaired if he can deliver good intelligence on the Na'Vi.    You might guess that when Worthington enters the 10 foot tall, blue but able-bodied Avatar, he becomes hooked not only on having mobility again, but is enchanted by the lovely planet and his lovely female guide and teacher (Zoe Saldana).  Conflict ensues when the information he has gathered is used against the Na'Vi, whom he now loves and wishes to protect.     This mundane story, full of clichés that are almost laughable in their earnestness, becomes almost secondary to the experience that is Pandora.  It is a beautiful, lush planet filled with unusual plants and animals.  Creatures that show remarkable imagination from Cameron and crew.  We are shown one swooping vista after another that takes our breath away.  There are flying creatures, something like dragons, that Worthington and the other Na'Vi fly...and we truly get a sense of flying (making stuff like the flying scenes in HARRY POTTER look amateurish).  The depth of the 3D is like nothing you've seen before.  Layer after layer of jungle, mountains, and people.  The movie is gorgeous in a way that I've never experienced.  I'm a somewhat jaded moviegoer, and my 22 year old son has a 2nd career being jaded...but we were both blown away by how COOL this movie is.      I've barely touched on who wondrous this film is in so many ways.  I don't think I really have the vocabulary to describe how happy I was to be seeing it.  It's a longish film (160 minutes)...but I did not want it to be over.  I wanted to see some more of Pandora.    And the movie was also greatly assisted by a grounded and capable performance by Sam Worthington (who also made TERMINATOR SALVATION watchable).  He's a rugged, manly actor...but his performance is self-effacing and open to the wonder that is Pandora.  We experience it mostly through his eyes, and his reactions inform our understanding.  I think this guy now needs a more down to earth, non-sci-fi film to really show us what he's got.    Cameron is a great director in many ways.  While his scripts are often a bit uninspired...he knows how to construct a story.  It takes a long time for AVATAR to come to its real \\"action\\" scenes...but Cameron knows that if he's built everything up correctly, made us care about the right people, understand the stakes and simply feel the tension...then finally getting the payoff makes things work so much better.  The battle scenes are pretty impressive, and worth the wait.    In the end, although I think there are some significant flaws (some sketchy performances and some clumsy writing), I must give the film top marks, because so many things aren't just right, they are revelatory.  Take your friends and family and experience AVATAR!

B000067CPX|5.0|If I was stranded on an island for the rest of my life all I would need is food and this \\"By The Way\\" CD... I am guy who likes music in all its different forms, and I have come to the conclusion that this album is the most PERFECT album ever made.  My love for this album cannot be described in words, but the feeling I get from listening to every one of these tracks is just amazing. I like all of their albums, but this one is just, just.... PERFECTION.    It makes me sick to think that some people could say that in this album they lost their \\"funk\\" or whatever. Anyone who would say this just doesn't understand what the chili peppers are about.    This is the only album which I have listened for over 10 years and I'm still not tired of (I just appreciate it more and more)    BUY THIS ALBUM

B000001FDK|5.0|Moments after purchasing this soundtrack, I had chills that started multiplying, and I felt I was losing control.  The power it was supplying  was electrifying to say the least.  I thought that I better shape up cause...I needed something to set my heart on.  Thought I better shape up,   understand, to my heart I MUST be true.  Nothin' left, nothin' left for me to do.  This is the one that I want!!  Filled with affection to shy  to convey, meditate in some direction and feel my way.  Am I sure?  Yes, I'm sure deep down inside!!    My story is a sad story to tell, once a teenager ne'er do well.  Most mixed up delinquent on the block.  My future's so unclear, what's left of   my career now.  Can't even get a trade-in on my smile.  I'm a beauty school drop-out, no graduation day for me.  Beauty school drop-out, missed  my midterms and flunked shampoo!!  Well at least I could have taken time to wash and clean my clothes up after spending all that dough to have  the doctor fix my nose up.    Guess mine is not the first heart broken.  My eyes are not the first to cry, I'm not the first to know, there's just no getting over you.  Hello,  I'm just a fool who's willing to sit around and wait for you.  But...baby can't you see, there's nothin' else for me to do I'm hopelessly   devoted to you.  But NOW there's nowhere to hide since you pushed my love aside I'm not in my head.    With this soundtrack, you'll be coasting through the heat lap trails!!

0071636080|4.0|This is a solid book. However, it presumes that you are already have some presentation experience and want to improve. That being the case, it should definitely help you avoid many pitfalls and greatly enhance your audience's enjoyment.<br /><br />I have given a fair number of presentations as a Master Gardener over the last 10 years. My presentations have always been well received and have been pretty good -- mostly because I work hard on them. This book pointed out a number of areas where I could (and will) improve. In a few cases, the book pointed out things that I already knew -- but failed to practice.<br /><br />Let's face it. Most presentations are abysmal. All of us have endured time spent semi-listening to some schmuck drone on and on. In many ways, this book provides a looking glass view of yourself -- the one that the audience sees. As far as I am concerned, PowerPoint (or other similar programs) are required to effectively communicate your message and look professional doing so. These programs offer the *potential* to give stellar presentations.<br /><br />Sadly, most speakers fall way short of \\"stellar\\". They need this book. It is currently the only one that I would recommend on this topic.<br /><br />On the downside of the book, there seemed to be a good bit of repetition; perhaps for the sake of adding filler.  On the other hand, it could be argued that it was a good educational ploy to present the same material from several different perspectives.  Personally, I think that argument is a bit of a stretch. But then, in the educational presentations that I give, I have also found that a multi-prong approach is necessary.  I have done it both ways and have learned to err on the side of repetition -- just try to be clever enough to veil it well.
0810982862|2.0|For months, people have been talking about James Cameron's sci-fi epic \\"Avatar\\" -- the exotic alien world of Pandora, the clash between the blue cat-elf natives and Earth's military, and the Pocahontas-ey love story that all movies of this type have.<br /><br />\\"The Art of Avatar: James Cameron's Epic Adventure\\" could easily fill a vast tome that follows this movie from conception to finished product... but instead we get a lushly-illustrated, thinly picture book that dips into the origins of Pandora's designs, but not much else. It feels less like an \\"art of\\" book that explores the visuals, and more like a pamphlet advertising the movie.<br /><br />Most of the conceptual art seems to revolve around the Na'vi's world of Pandora -- there are floating mountains, lush misty rainforests, vast lakes and twisting mushroom-shaped trees. Additionally, there are some studies of the bizarre flora (luminous, fungus-like plants and ferns) and fauna (the six-legged viperwolf, the vaguely reptilian/leonine thanator). Not to mention the Na'vi, the aforemented cat-elf aliens.<br /><br />And there's also some focus on the human technology -- the sterile grey \\"shack\\" known as Site 26 and the Vietnam-era base around it, the clunky mecha \\"amp suit,\\" the Dragon, and the chopperesque Samson (which looks a lot like something I saw in the anime movie \\"Appleseed\\").<br /><br />Any movie as huge, elaborate and intensely alien as \\"Avatar\\" -- especially one decades in the making -- must have a small library's worth of concept art, outlines, backstory, and design work. And I'm sure this exists somewhere... just not in \\"The Art of Avatar,\\" which is heavy on the finished visuals, but rather light on conceptual art, the evolution of the movie's style, and artistic bumps in the road.<br /><br />Perhaps the most frustrating aspect of this book is that it spends a lot of time telling but not showing. The creators of the sets and special effects talk about all sorts of fascinating creative dilemmas and unconventional artistic decisions (aerial mountain shots! Francis Bacon! Undersea life!). But.... we don't see a lot of it, or the various steps that took them from A to Z. We're just told that hey, they had troubles with the six legs or the sleek biolab designs, and that's it.<br /><br />And there's no real exploration of the epic Na'vi/human climactic battle, except for some pretty pictures of the AMPs charging around shooting and blowing things up. Or the science of Pandora's epic-looking landscape (just how do those mountains float?). Additionally, the prose parts of the book are as skimpy as cheap pantyhose -- every couple pages we have two or three brief paragraphs, and that's it.<br /><br />I will say this: the art is STUNNING. Luminous, filled with light and mist, with plenty of epic shots of Pandora's rainforesty fantastical world. And they have some foldout sections that give further exploration of Pandora's wildlife (such as floating firefly... lizards?).<br /><br />HOWEVER, most of the pictures are straightforward digital pictures, with a relatively small representation of maquettes and pencil/watercolor concept art. Most of what there is.... pretty much looks like the actual creatures/places in the movie -- for instance, there are only a few concept images of the Na'vi that don't look just like the finished product (head tentacles and cat lips). It took twenty years to design all this?<br /><br />The digital art is vibrantly, exquisitely lovely, but \\"The Art of Avatar: James Cameron's Epic Adventure\\" isn't much more than a sci-fi picture book.

B0026P3G12|5.0|After downloading the MP3 version, I purchased three copies of this CD as holiday gift for friends.  It is a very pretty album -- a consistent sound and quality, and a lovely background for relaxing and just listening.  After enjoying the entire thing a couple times, I'm going to merge it into my Sarah Brightman and Enya mix, as Boyle, for me, brings that same quality and temperament to her songs.<br />What I missed, however, was the WOW factor we all saw when she was on stage and on You Tube.  I feel like someone overcompensated on toning her down.  She's got a lot more power inside her, and I hope to hear more of that in future albums.
B001FB562U|4.0|The one thing that The Road does well is the same thing that may divide audiences on this film--sticking to its source material. If you're familiar with the novel of the same name by Cormac McCarthy, you'll know that it may have raised some eyebrows when it was announced it was being made into a film. However after the immense critical and commercial and success of the Coen brother's adaptation of his novel No Country for Old Men, it's no wonder that it would eventually make its way to the big-screen sooner or later.<br /><br />  The film follows a father and his son on their journey through a post-apocalyptic world. They have no mission other than to survive, or \\"carry on the fire inside\\" as the father repeatedly tells his son. Little is told of the events that have caused this worldwide catastrophe. There are few characters in the book and the ones that do appear have little depth to them, making it an even more difficult task for director John Hillcoat. What the film really centers on, and why the book rendered so well with readers, is the relationship between father and son, and its examination of just how far a parent will go to protect their child in the most grim and hopeless of circumstances.<br /><br />  The film's biggest strength is the incredible performance of Viggo Mortenson (A History of Violence, Eastern Promises) as a father who goes to unspeakable lengths to protect his son (Kodi Smith-McPhee) and carry them both through a bleak and desolate world. His son was born during this tumultuous time, so this world around him is the only thing he knows. His father steers clear of telling him what caused all of this and solely focuses on teaching him how to survive by being one of the \\"good guys\\". They are on a constant journey for food and shelter, of which there is little left. The \\"bad guys\\", as the father puts it, are some of the few survivors who have turned to rape, murder, and cannibalism as a means to carry on in this world. One of the most frightening and chilling moments of this movie are when the father has to tell his son how to hold a gun to kill himself in case they ever are attacked by any of the outlaws that roam the countryside. It hits the viewer square in the gut and makes the question the lengths they would go to protect their child from harm in the worst of circumstances.<br /><br />  While the film may be no masterpiece, Mortenson's portrayal of a father willing to do next to anything to protect his son from the unspeakable danger surrounding them is nothing short of brilliant. Cormac McCarthy's novels may not render themselves well from book to movie, but its tough to argue that a much better job could be done than this.<br /><br />-Jeffrey Ryanmost frightening and chilling moments of this movie are when the father has to tell his son how to hold a gun to kill himself in case they ever are attacked by any of the outlaws that roam the countryside.

B002P6TA94|5.0|To anyone thinking of buying this album, I would say do so without a second thought.  If you're a fan of real rock n' roll then you know that these days it can take a lot of searching to find an album that lives up to the standards set by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Black Sabbath.  It is here, with this album, that your search can finally end.  Wolfmother's sophomore attempt rocks harder than ever and more than lives up to the expectations of Wolfmother fans and classic rock alike.  The new lineup gives Wolfmother new energy and creativity that really brings this album to life.  I can only say so much so in the end you have got to check the album out for your self.  I promise you your purchase of this album will be worth every penny.

0061729078|2.0|I expected to read extensively about Aldous trips.. That however only fills the first few pages after which he jumps into theories and conclusions on drug use based on having tried this one drug (mescaline)... There are some interesting ideas in there but be warned, they are only a few and it boils down to this:  - According to Aldous drugs \\"open the doors of perception\\" and let you perceive the world as it \\"really is\\"; as a baby would experience it.   - There are many cultures in which drugs have been used for centuries now.  - He thinks it would be beneficial if more people had a trip like his. He thus also dreams of the perfect drug that could be developed in the future. (though mescaline is not that bad he adds).  - Some long theories about art and why we find certain things beautiful (according to him: we find that which is \\"otherworldly\\" beautiful- i.e. what we can see during trips)    If you still wonder what his trip was like I will sum it up for you in one phrase:  He was content observing, saw immense beauty in simple things (like the structure of wood, or a flower) and could stare at them for for ever... + he lost interest in humans.
B0026RHR6K|1.0|So I believe that it goes without saying, especially if you're here looking to purchase the entire series, that Battlestar Galactica is one of the BEST shows in recent history, and in my opinion the BEST science-fiction/drama. Previously a friend lent me the individual seasons and I loved them so I decided I wanted to get the complete series, but when I saw the packaging I was APPALLED!  Its simply the worst.  Flimsy and seemingly bad housing for the DVDs.  And NO episode guide?!  Looks aside, its terrible packaging.    BUT, then I saw the UK version of the box set and frankly it looks a THOUSAND times better.  Much more space efficient and packaging conscious and from the photos it looks like it has a booklet etc. This leads me to believe that the UK import is the way to go, my only concern was whether or not it would play on a fairly new American DVD player.  Still not sure about that.  Open to input.

The album is dark and gloomy, full of effects and strange noise, but under all the polish lies not only great music but great lyrics.<br /><br />Anyone that doesn't own this all-time classic should go and buy it, or better download it from amazon.com.
B002XHN776|5.0|I was very much looking forward to this new album by one of my favorite bands, 30 Seconds to Mars. They certainly didn't let me down. As much as I love \\"A Beautiful Lie\\", I think I might love \\"This Is War\\" even more. I just love how the guys let their fans be a major part of the album. They are one of the few bands who truly acknowledge that their fans are the reason that they do what they do. This album is a gift to the people who have supported them over the years, over the long wait while worked out their problems with their label company. I recommend this album to anyone who loves to rock out to great music.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|Refraction may not be the right word, but regularly the video looked as though the camera shooting the film, was having lights reflecting off of its lens.  It was very annoying and it is hard to believe that the filmmakers allowed this to happen, so I wonder if it was a flaw in the Bluray or the very recording I received.  Anyone else notice this?  I did not see the moving in a theater.     I did, however, very much like the movie and think the new Spock is a great choice and probably the toughest to have gotten right.  Uhura is great, too, and Bones is Bones.  Kirk might turn out ok and so may Scotty, but can't tell from this movie.  I really liked Chekov and I think Sulu is also a good choice.  Seeing him its hard to remember who the original was.    Had the flashing on the screen not been there, I would have given this a five star easy.

Nope.  To say this book is written for amateur writers is an insult to amateur writers.  If you've been writing for more than a month, his advice is meaningless because it's the same old recycled advice you'll hear in even the amateur writing circles.  However, if you want to read a completely self-indulgent memoir about a small part of a writer's life interspersed with tired writing advice, this is the one.  Good luck staying awake.

Now if your a hard nosed TV series viewer and expect the same thing you may be disappointed..I never saw any Tv series.. but this movie has so many cool elements that it makes it down right entertaining.. Val Kilmer at his best.. He can pull off so many looks it was impressive to watch. Plus Elisabeth Shue.. how can you go wrong? See it!
B002K0WBXW|1.0|I was disappointed in this movie. There is absolutely no chemistry between Bullock and Reynolds. He also looks and appears 10 years younger than her. None of the actors/actresses played their roles well. Betty White's character was a typical Betty White character but silly to the point of ridiculous. The tribal scene in the woods was pointless. Craig Nelson was not convincing as the overbearing dad. The dude from The Office who played the male stripper/minister was disgusting. I did not laugh a single time in the movie. The best thing about the movie was the Alaskan scenery.
B002QF31HQ|2.0|This is a review of the vinyl reissue of RELAYER. I won't comment too much on the music here as this recording is not new but  from the mid- seventies. It is a powerful  work,probably the most progressive 'out there' recording in Yes' career. I looked forward to buying this new copy on  vinyl and received it the other day. The gatefold LP jacket is reproduced perfectly with the inclusion of a small red '180 gram' logo on the back. The vinyl is thick and dead flat...so good so far. It's downhill from there folks.This is a DULL lifeless pressing. I don't know what went wrong here but it is lacking in overall presence. It sounds as is the high frequences are shaved off. I pulled out an old copy I have with a $3 sticker on it and gave it a spin. Wonderful dynamics, extension in the bass and treble...the only thing the reissue had over the old one was a dead quite surface ( no ticks or pops). BE WARE!

0446607274|4.0|When the body of Howard Elias, a high profile black lawyer, is found inside one of the cars on Angels Flight in downtown Los Angeles, no detective in the city wants to touch the case.  Elias specialises in lawsuits alleging police brutality, racism and corruption and every LAPD cop is a potential suspect in his murder.  The atmosphere in Los Angeles is tense: racial distrust and recriminations against the police are part of the legacy of the Rodney King case and the O.J. Simpson trial.  Every step the police take to solve this crime will be viewed with distrust as it is widely believed that the murderer was a cop.<br /><br />Solving this case is a challenge for Detective Harry Bosch: feelings both amongst the police and the community are volatile.  Negotiating the politics, dealing with the suspicion and hate makes trying to investigate the crime difficult - especially as quick action is required.<br /><br />And, if that isn't enough, things aren't going very well for Bosch at home either.<br /><br />I am reading Michael Connell's novels out of order.  This may not be ideal, but it works okay for me.  The novels stand alone and while I'm missing some of Harry Bosch's back story it's kind of fun filling in the gaps.  This is one of the best Michael Connelly novels I've read so far.  Right up there with my current favourites: `The Concrete Blonde'; `The Lincoln Lawyer' and `The Poet.'<br /><br />Jennifer Cameron-Smith
0061914177|5.0|Crush It! is a great primer on why and how to use various social media applications - Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc - to build your brand and get yourself known in your niche. The overriding message in the book is that there are no longer any barriers to entry to building your brand. Gatekeepers that used to stand in your way and deny you access to the tools you used to need to get your word out have been eliminated by the Internet.    Gary talks about the tools that he uses as well as the ones he does not use, explaining the whys and why nots along the way. If you like Web video, use YouTube, Viddler, or UStream. If you're good with audio, do a podcast. If you prefer the written word, use one of the many blogging services. He repeatedly makes the very correct point that building your brand is hard work and requires a great deal of patience. There are no shortcuts. He offers many points of encouragement and gives several hypothetical examples of how people in various niches can outshine their competition.    The advice offered in the book is spot-on. I see a number of people online already following his advice, whether they're aware of it or not. Leo Laporte, Chris Brogan, Pamela Slim, and others. All of these people are leaders in their respective niches.  They're very effectively using the tools they're most comfortable with (if there's a secret in the book, that's it right there - don't force yourself to use tools you're not comfortable with) to get their word out, connect with people, and build their brand.    Towards the end of the book, Gary expands on what you can expect to see happen if you stick with your efforts. As I was reading I became gratified to realize that I've already started to experience some of the things Gary describes.    This book has earned a permanent spot on my personal reference shelf. If you're looking to strike out on your own, build an online presence, and develop your brand, there's no better place to start than with Crush It! Youwon't be sorry.
B000002KB8|5.0|Forty years on, its time to put this band in its proper light. The doomy circus act of Ozzy Ozborne may have made Black Sabbath the fathers of metel.<br /><br />But there is a reason this band was one of the first four or five to be signed to Vertigo, Englands premire progressive labal in 1969. Sure, the gloom theatrics of the title track make this a fright night to scare little kids and old ladies.<br /><br />But in 1970, even this was inventive. For all the peace love flowers and protest, there were fat, ugly, freeky beer drinking kids with limited prospects all over the world. These guys did not join the counterculture: they were in  it the day they were born. Giving them guitars and setting them loose on Strawberry Alarm love love love Pepper rock was a geniuinely scary prospect, and they made genuinely scary music. No one had heard anything like it. Music was not supposed to SOUND like that.<br /><br />But it is: the open spaces gave Geezer Butler's bass and Tony Iommi's guitar plenty of room. The cornerstone of early Sabbath is blues, but this music almost worked as jazz.<br /><br />Simply put: These guys were fantastic players, and streched out over the wide chords like modal jazz musicians. Iommi sailing over the top of Butler's chunky bass and Bill Wards drums almost was like Coltrane working over Elivn Jones and Jimmy Garrison: get a great soloist, pick a few chords, and GO!<br /><br />So much has happened since 1970 that the thunder and fright seems nieve today, and Ozborn is now the cute burnout on TV, not the scary kid with no direction and a witchy bucket of PISSED!<br /><br />We forget how innovative and different this was: this stuff was dismissed all too quickly in 1970 and now has become a textbook of metal moves. Metal is now a stage show, not the exitential statement it was when this album was realeased on Vertigo--which put its best foot forward with Manford Mann and Juicy Lucy as well as Sabbath--so long ago

0452289963|4.0|I bought this book after watching Oprah, and I was absolutely delighted.  But, I must say Tolle´s books are not for everyone.  I mean, it´s easier to read and practice the principles suggested by writers like R. Holden, Dyer, Phillip McGraw, G. Neuman, Spezzano, Kabat-Zinn and Shmuley Boteach to name a few.  When I was reading E. Tolle, he reminded me F. Nietzsche \\"We must still have chaos within us to be able to give birth to a dancing star\\". I did liked this book and found it very comforting.  He clearly defines with good examples, how our identification with the ego keeps us from simply being in the present tied to our thoughts, stuff, pain, and all the things we let get in our way and cloud our lives.    This book has changed the way I look at many things around me, and it has made me understand why I think the way I do, and therefore why  I act the way I do.  It has also given me some tools to enlighten my daily life.  But I´d suggest to read this book thoughtfully and never with kids around you.  This is the kind of books that you read, you stop and think, you keep reading.......
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Liberties can be taken when it comes to some holiday movies, and Elf is also one that fits this niche, as Will Ferrell plays a human who mistakenly was left abandoned and wound up being raised by Papa Elf and his group of elves. Trying to fit into the elf world, Buddy (Ferrell) helps his fellow elves prepare gifts for Christmas and do other sorts of jobs, but never quite holds up his end (at one point, after not meaning his quota, Buddy frustratingly calls himself a \\"cotton-headed ninnymuggins\\" in despair). One day, after overhearing other elves speak about Buddy's \\"humanness\\", Buddy has the truth broken to him by Papa Elf: he was adopted by the elf community, and he's really human, and his father, who is on the naughty list, is in New York where he works. Buddy departs to New York to find his real father, and tries to understand and fit into the culture of the human world as Christmas approaches. Buddy's father is play perfectly by James Caan, who is aloof and distant from Buddy. While in a department store, Buddy meets a beautiful worker who he falls for. From here, the film focuses on Buddy trying to gain a role in his human father's life as well as his new found relationship with his fellow worker, all the while trying to stir up Christmas spirit in a world where it is sorely lacking.     The casting for Elf is superb. Ferrell can use his zany and over-the-top antics, and it fits well with his character Buddy as he makes his transition to the human world as a giant elf. He plays the role as \\"man-child\\" with perfection, and his obnoxious and overly loud outbursts go well with the inner child and innocence in this role. There is also great chemistry between Ferrell and Deschanel, who is the department store clerk who Buddy falls for. There are a few parts where they sing, and Deschanel has a wonderful voice, with Ferrell's not being too bad either. James Caan does a great job and is cast perfectly as Buddy's reluctant and tough-guy father, who at first wants nothing to do with Buddy, but eventually softens. And Bob Newhart is solid as Papa Elf, who raises Buddy to be more elf than human.     There are some great laughs in the film as well as a few memorable lines. At one point, Buddy overhears that Santa is coming to the department store the next day and he screams out \\"Santa!\\" When the \\"phony\\" Santa arrives, Buddy sniffs out that this is, in fact, a fake and is on to him, saying \\"You sit on a throne of lies\\", which follows with a major altercation between the two.     The nice thing about this film is that it is a family friendly Christmas film with humor and a feel good attitude. The latter part of the film probably isn't as good as the first half, and we can probably predict how things will turn out, but that doesn't deter an over all good time.

B002NPCSJG|5.0|Don't let the weak title deter you from this novel. This military sci-fi novel from John Scalzi is a real page turner with an interesting premise of elderly people getting recruited to join the service. After reading this novel, the other books in the series immediately went on my wishlist!  If his other novels grab me like this one, I'll definitely have to pick up his other novels.

Season two has no subtitles.  \\"Teenage\\" girls talk so fast, I only heard about three words across the entire season - watching these shows was like work.  Season one and three has sub titles - what happeded to season two?  Did they air without closed captions?
B0002F6BRE|5.0|A really funny movie with an interesting premise. A human raised as an elf at the North Pole is introduced to life in New York City as he learns that he's not really an elf and that his real father is on Santa's \\"naughty\\" list. Much of the comedy comes from how this grown man acts like a kid because he doesn't know any better.
B002MW50KO|3.0|It's too bad Dylan didn't release this album back in the late 1980s, when he was still in fine voice (well, fine for him), since he seems to be channeling his inner Wilbury on this project. Some of the songs, to be sure, are delivered without a hint of irony or playfulness, mostly the overtly religious ones, such as \\"Hark the Herald Angels Sing,\\" \\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\" and \\"O Little Town of Bethlehem.\\" A couple of them are unfortunate evidence that some songs are well out of his range and the result is rather painful to listen to (\\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\" almost demands the listener to respond, \\"I dunno, Bob. I'm hearing you miss a lot of notes in this song. Is that what you hear, too?\\"). But then again, some of the traditional songs are genuinely pleasant to the ear, such as \\"Little Drummer Boy,\\" which conjures up distant memories of \\"Nashville Skyline\\" when Dylan found a sweeter voice for his \\"country\\" album. The real highlights of this Christmas collection, though (and let's be clear here - while this may not quite be \\"Slow Sleigh Coming,\\" it's very much grounded in the Christian tradition), are two songs as archetypically Dylanesque as anything else he's ever recorded: the superb \\"The Christmas Blues\\" and the raucous, infectious \\"Must Be Santa.\\" In the final analysis, it's really hard to know exactly what Dylan's concept for this might have been - some of the songs feature backup singers right out of the Ray Conniff school (\\"Winter Wonderland,\\" \\"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\\") and the cover artwork is almost cloying in its evocation of Currier & Ives. But then, what are we to think of the Bettie Page photo inside the booklet, which evokes an entirely different mood? Ultimately, we'll have to just chalk this one up to Dylan being Dylan, and just enjoy its highlights.
160094048X|5.0|I got this cookbook on Wed and by Thursday I had baked the Peanut Butter Chocolate Pillows, the Mexican Snickerdoodles and the Irish Creme Kisses (was fresh out of Irish whiskey however, so I subsitituted with brandy...just as good!) I even whipped up a batch of Pumpkin Brownies and hauled them all to my local watering hole for a holiday party.  Each and everyone was a huge hit--all my crazy carnivore friends refused to believe something that good could be vegan.  I really can't wait to try more recipes!
B001992NUQ|5.0|I watched this movie 220 times now (plus or minus 2) ...  and will watch for the rest of  life .. This is a Legendary Film .. Cult movie once in life time .   I have mild dissociative disorder .. so it appeals to me more...   I'am in total disbelief how this thought provoking movie made only a $35 mil in box office ..   We should all buy copy of DVD and donate it to friends to make this movie a success .
B002VPE1AM|5.0|I almost didn't go to see this movie this past Saturday due to predictions of a bad snow storm here in the Northeast, however the tickets were already paid for via online with no refund and were $16 a piece so I decided if I didn't see it now I probably would not buy another ticket at that price and would have to wait for a DVD release. All I can say is thank goodness the snow didn't come until a couple of hours after the movie was over and I did go see it, I have nothing but praise for this movie and would find it really hard to point out any real flaws to this movie.<br /><br />  I'll give you the premise without giving away any spoilers of the story. The movie takes place in the future, the year 2154 and on the Planet Padora, actually Pandora may be a moon and not a planet but regardless it looks like it could be a jungle here on Earth, also the air in unbreathable by Humans and they must wear masks when outside. Humans have come to Pandora to mine a precious mineral called Unobtanium (do not ask me how you say it) anyway this stuff is worth a fortune, and the largest vein of it is located right below a village of one of the native species known as the Na'vi. The Na'vi are about 9ft tall with tails, blue skin, and bones reinforced with carbon fiber, although they appear primitive compared to the humans they are putting up a good fight to protect there land.<br /><br />  The movie foucses on former Marine Jake Sully(Sam Worthington) who is paralyzed from the wiast down after a battle that took place on Earth, although they do have procedures to cure this it costs lots of money and the military does not cover the costs. When the movie begins Jake is on his way to pay his last respects to his twin brother Thomas who was a scientist working on the Avatar program on Pandora and was murdered. The Avatar program is where they created human-Na'vi hybrids these clones were mentally linked to the DNA of the there hosts and after Thomas is killed Jake gets invited to take his place as they are twins and share the same DNA allowing him to link up with Thomas's Avatar which cost a small fortune to make. The purpose of these Avatars is to find diplomatic ways to negotiate with the Na'vi, however this has not been working and a military composed of ex-Marines and mercenaries is about to do things the hard way. Through a series of events during the early parts of the movie Jake ends up in the Na'vi village in his Avatar body and is given three months by his superiors to get them to leave peacefully, and at the same time to expose the weak spots of there hide out.<br /><br />  Okay the story is not really anything new, as far as movies I have seen It's like The Last Samurai but with Aliens and on another planet instead of Japan. However that doesn't mean the story is bad, I loved the whole thing from start to finish, this had to be the quickest two and half hours I have spent at a movie, I did not want it to end. I saw it in IMAX and in 3-D which looked beautiful for the most part, but I'm glad to say it is not needed and this movie will hold out on it's own without the 3D, which means I will definately be picking this up when it comes out on Bluray down the road. There is plenty of action to keep you adrenaline junkies happy, and there are also some tender moments as well. This movie was well worth the $16 admission I paid and coming from someone as cheap as I am that's high praise, I liked it so much that if my girlfriend and her kids want to see it I would gladly go see it again.s they are twins and share the same DNA allowing him to link up with Thomas's Avatar which cost a small fortune to make.

0743454529|5.0|This book was so moving and powerful that I am going to have a hard time putting my feelings into words, but I'm going to give it my best shot. Bear with me.      From the very beginning, we can see that the Fitzgerald family is falling apart. Kate's illness has been the center of their lives for fourteen years, and Sara Fitzgerald's other children have suffered because of this. Neglected and ignored, her oldest son Jesse turns to destruction and rebellion in order to receive attention. Anna feels that she is only wanted because she can keep Kate alive- not because she is loved by her parents. Before I read the chapters from Sara's point of view, I sided with Anna and thought the mother was doing a terrible job of parenting. Then, I read the first chapter from Sara's point of view, and that idea went down the drain. Sara and Brian (the father) are doing the absolute best they can, given their terrible circumstances. Picoult does a marvelous job presenting each side of the story through different characters so that the reader has a fuller understanding of what's really going on. I came to know and love every character.       As a teenager, I can relate to many of the feelings that Anna has about wanting to find herself and discover who she will become. Ever since Anna was born, her dreams and goals have been overshadowed by Kate's needs. It's no wonder that Anna feels unloved. Being able to relate to Anna helped me to immerse myself in the story. I hate it when I can't relate to any characters or get inside their heads. I never had a problem learning to understand and love Anna.       When I first picked up this novel, I fully expected to take one side;  Anna's or her mother's. I wasn't sure what side it would be, but since I'm a fairly opinionated person, I thought I'd be able to choose one quickly. I wasn't. Both Anna and her mother had beliefs based in truth and love, which made it hard to decide which was \\"wrong.\\" Picoult did an incredible job in convincing the reader to feel both sides of this controversial topic. I have a little sister, and she is my best friend in the world. I would have donated a kidney without a second thought. Knowing this, I thought I'd side with Sara, but after loving Anna, I didn't know who was right. Sometimes letting go is the only way to be free.       Four years ago, my younger brother was hospitalized with pneumonia over Christmas break. It was one of the worst times of my life. I developed a hatred for hospitals and doctors, who couldn't seem to heal my brother. He did eventually get well, and the nightmare finally ended. This novel allowed me to take a walk in the shoes of someone who lives this nightmare every day. I have a new respect for everyone who deals with cancer and other illnesses. They are the true heroes who have the strength to fight through ever day.       As much as I loved this novel, I did have one problem with it: the ending. It was shocking and beautiful (as is much of the novel), yet I was disappointed that it ended so unhappily. You'd think that after picking up a book about leukemia, I would have been prepared for a sad ending. I was at least hoping for some sort of cheesy line that proved the family was eventually happy, but it seemed to me that no one ever got over the death. This is just a tiny bit depressing, and let's just say that I know someone (okay, it was me) who bawled her eyes out right before going to bed.       This novel touched my heart and made me look at life with a whole new perspective. Amazing.
1594488878|3.0|Tucker Crowe, one of the main characters of Nick Hornby's new novel, is a fictional early-indie rock musician with a lot more critical acclaim than commercial success -- imagine Paul Westerberg as a hapless lothario. One day in the midst of a tour, he checks out, disappears off the face of the earth.    Years later, Crowe's early recordings are released, and Duncan, an obsessed fan, publishes a rave review on a tribute Web site he runs. Then the fan's long-suffering girlfriend, Annie, posts her own review, giving the tunes a thoughtful thumbs-down, and suddenly finds herself trading secret e-mails with the reclusive musician.    That's the set-up for \\"Juliet, Naked,\\" a return to territory that Hornby staked out 15 years ago with his book \\"High Fidelity.\\" That, too, was a love story about a pop culture fanatic -- written by a pop culture fanatic, for pop culture fanatics.    Its music-loving hero wasn't always heroic, but the character -- who composed lists of his favorite albums and most painful breakups -- struck a chord with readers.    This time, however, Hornby is less on the side of the fan, a dweeb drawn as having little substance beyond his musical interests.    While the book at times seems like a blueprint for a movie (a number of Hornby's books have been made into films and Annie's aging, stammering therapist could almost be subtitled \\"The Bill Nighy Role\\"), there's a little more going on here, particularly with Crowe, who grows deeper and more sympathetic as the book progresses.    Readers will have to decide for themselves if a big, last-minute twist works for them -- it struck me as a loud, false note -- but the book is still worthwhile for its breezy wit and mild wisdom, and for asking just how much artists owe to others, to their craft and to themselves.
B002NUULNG|4.0|Although the purists seem to prefer the original version, I feel the new, updated version is also worth watching and having. Of course you get both with this Blu ray. I am happy with this version.
B002XHN776|4.0|I remember vividly back in the mid-90's watching \\"My So Called Life\\" on TV, the episode where Jordan Catalano (Jared Leto) sings I wanna be sedated, and I thought, damn, he should be in a band.  So, back in 2005/2006 I bought a 30 seconds to Mars CD.  It was pretty good, but unfortunately I ought it on a business trip becuase the car I rented didn't have an input jack for my MP3 player, so I needed something to listed to.  Needless to say I destroyed that CD on the trip cause I listened to it over and over and over again.    So the new 30 Seconds to Mars CD comes out and I see these great reviews.  I almost didn't download it.  I am still so sick of their \\"sound\\".  But I did based on the reviews.  I listened to it about a week ago, or at least tried to, on a 10 mile run and couldn't make it thru the whole thing.  I just wasn't in the mood.    Then yesterday I had another 10 mile run to do for a half marathon I am training for, and BAM, this CD hit me.  I guess you just have to be in the right mood or frame of mind, but this is a killer CD.      The fan \\"backing vocals\\" are awesome and really make the CD what it is.  While listening to this you can really picture this band playing a larger arena with the fans singing along and the concert being \\"an experience\\" instead of just being a live concert.      While I still think I personally need to be in the right mood to listen to this CD, when I am in that frame of mind, this CD is great.  Full of energy and life and 30 seconds to Mars trying to make a statement/connect with their fans.  Too many bands act like they are so above it all, cooler then the rest.  These guys just seem to want to make music the fans will really appreciate and they gave them a reason to on this release.    I would say if you like compilation/theme typed releases where maybe one song does not stand alone well on its own, but you do like to listen to a CD as a cohesve set of songs, then this CD is worth picking up.
B0015DROBO|5.0|This book was so addicting.  I loved that there were several mysteries in this novel. I wasn't sure while reading the beginning of the novel if it would hold my interest. But as soon as Salander's character was introduced, I was hooked.  I highly recommend this book and now I am going to read &#34;The girl who played with fire&#34;.
031606792X|4.0|I didn't start reading this series until after it was over and I had heard people on the Internet complaining about how much they hated the last book. I decided to read the series anyway, just to know what people were talking about. To my surprise, I ended up liking them and actually getting invested in the characters, despite the fact that the books aren't the best-written things in the world.    I'm kind of amazed by how seriously some people hated this book. Maybe it helped that I knew the general outlilne of what happened before I read it, but seeing as the Twilight saga is essentially a bunch of supernatural romance novels, is anyone really and truly shocked that Bella ends up with everything she wants and then some?    I can see why people who never liked the series in the first place might dislike this one in particular, but what is there in \\"Breaking Dawn\\" that didn't exist or wasn't foreshadowed in the previous books? We knew about imprinting. We know about Meyer's love of too many adjectives. We knew Bella didn't want to go to college, and we knew that Edward didn't want to make her a vampire or have sex with her unless they were married. (God forbid Edward have any say over the circumstances in which he makes someone a vampire or loses his virginity. If Bella was so terribly against marrying Edward, she could have just not done it.) If the fight against the newborns in \\"Eclipse\\" didn't kill any of the Cullens, there's no reason to expect that any of them are going to die now.    The one and only thing that happened in \\"Breaking Dawn\\" that wasn't foreshadowed in previous books in the series was that it was possible for Bella and Edward to have a baby. If reading about Bella and Edward having a baby isn't your thing, okay. That's understandable. But the fact that some people seem so flat-out offended that Bella and Edward have a baby just boggles my mind. Bella would not be the first woman in the world to not be interested in having kids before discoveringthat getting pregnant changes her mind. Are people offended because she didn't have an abortion? I'm offended by the attitude that someone would think a woman should have an abortion when she didn't want one. As for Edward being able to read Renesmee's mind while she's still in utero, this is a fantasy novel, guys. You find it offensive that a mind-reading vampire can read the mind of his half-vampire daughter before she's born?    Stephanie Meyer is obviously happy to be a mother, as are most women who are mothers. So Bella's happy ending gives her the vampire of her dreams, a sweet little daughter, special powers, breath-taking beauty, and circumstances that allow her to keep her relationship with her father and Jacob's friendship. Does \\"Breaking Dawn\\" have flaws? Yeah. I thought having Jacob imprint on Renesmee and lose all his romantic feelings for Bella was the easy way out of the Jacob/Bella/Edward love triangle. The part where the Cullens gather all their vampire friends to help them win against the Volturi goes on for too long and introduces too many pointless new characters. I'm still trying to figure out how it's possible for Edward to have an erection when he doesn't have a beating heart to pump blood downwards. But this was never meant to be a series that ended any other way than Bella and Edward living happily ever after, and for the final book in a series of romance novels about sparkly vampires, I thought it was interesting and ultimately satisfying. And if you're still upset that Bella doesn't want to go to college, she's got all of eternity to change her mind and get ten doctorates if she wants to.
0385737947|5.0|This is a sci-fi book, though at times it hits pretty hard and is a bit gory. The you folks in this book seem to range from around 10 yr old up to 17-ish. As part of some demented experiment they are placed in an artificial construct world after having part of their memories erased - the specific parts about their names, past, friends, family, etc. It seems that they are just meant to survive on their own and they have no idea to what end. The main protagonist seems very different and his arrival in this small world is the first catalyst for the ending stage of the experiment. The author develops detailed characters that draw you in and encourage you to care about them and pull for their success, while at times wondering if they should succeed, or if that may make it worse for them.<br /><br />In all it quickly drew me in and kept me turning pages the whole way through. My whole extended family, including my 71 year old mother, ended up stealing the book from one another because we were all reading this at the same time. Although some did not particularly like the ending, we are all eager to follow the survivors to their next trials to see them overcome more adversity and aspire to achieve freedom and find the truth about what they have been put through.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|One of the best movies since \\" The Dark Knight.\\" Its too hard to describe just how awesome this movie is. The action is just incredible, great storyline and a movie that will probably go down as one of the most memorable movie of this decade. A must see movie!

B002RVZV9K|5.0|We are entering an era, I feel, in which some names in the arts will remain constant in history, while some will slowly fade out - even if their music has, perhaps, the same quality. That is what I felt when I watched \\"It Might Get Loud,\\" an illuminating and penetrating documentary about three guitarists of importance in present times: Jimmy Page, David \\"The Edge\\" Howell Evans, and John Anthony Gillis (aka Jack White).    Although the film begins by telling us that \\"on January 23, 2008, three musicians came together to discuss the electric guitar,\\" we are in for much, much more. The guitarists do get together, but in between the takes of the meeting, we are shown historical footage of their careers. It is also a get-together of three generations of masters of the electric guitar, if you will: Page was born in 1944, The Edge on 1961, and White in 1975. White is the only one born in the United States (Detroit), while Page and The Edge were born in areas adjacent to London. White, being the youngest of the trio, says, before the meeting, that he wanted to \\"trick them into teaching me all their tricks.\\" Whether or not he succeeded, will go with him to the grave.    For my taste, I mostly enjoyed the scenes of the film in which the guitarists are shown in their own environments, before they got together. They discuss, almost in detail, their musical influences, and we see some footage and hear some of the music of the artists that influenced them. This is pure gold, I think. We see them playing some chords of some of the recordings that they admire, and they talk about their guitars, including their very first one. We follow them throughout their evolution as musicians, when, for example, Page was a member of Mickey Finn and the Blue Men, Carter Lewis and the Southerners, the Yardbirds, and, of course, Led Zeppelin. We see White performing with his sister (at the drums), the Raconteurs, and the White Stripes. We also enjoy them performing in concerts, including U2's \\"Where the Street Have No Name.\\" When they get together, they play parts of their songs, like \\"I will follow,\\" \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" and \\"Dead leaves and the Dirty Ground.\\" Interestingly, they perform these tunes with their electric guitars. At the end, however, they sit down at a different location inside the soundstage, and play with acoustic guitars.    \\"It Might get Loud\\" is an important document of our times, and, as I said at the beginning, I got a felling that one of the guitarist portrayed in this film will be remembered forever, one may survive the test of time, and one will probably be almost forgotten. When they play together, you can feel the nervousness and some degree of discomfort - maybe because there are too many people around, as well as cameras. However, they do synchronize their efforts the best possible way, given the fact that they have probably never been together before. It's all for history. By the way, it was The Edge, who at one point in the film, while practicing at an undisclosed location, says, \\"It Might get loud for a second,\\" which probably got the film its title. The DVD also includes deleted scenes; commentary by director Davis Guggenheim, and producers Lesley Chilcott and Thomas Tull, and more.

B000002I2I|4.0|Morrison Hotel is one of those albums where the good moments are great and the bad moments are just boring. The good news is that Morrison either wrote or co-wrote all the songs on the album. No offense to Robby Krieger, who wrote his share of great songs alongside some mediocre ones, but Morrison is the poet of the Doors. Morrison's lyrical output was missing for more than half of the band's previous albums, Waiting for the Sun and The Soft Parade, but now it seems as if Morrison's creative juices were flowing well once again. The first half of the album is almost perfect, with the only misstep being \\"Blue Sunday\\". I have never been a fan of the Doors ballads with a few exceptions and I would describe \\"Blue Sunday\\" as dreary and boring. The second half of the album is lacking. \\"The Spy\\" is boring and repetitive, as is \\"Indian Summer\\". One song on the second half of the album that gets a bad rap is the closing \\"Maggie M'Gill\\". The lyrics \\"Mom met Dad in the back/Of a rock and roll car/...yeah\\" are actually quite funny if you ask me. The way Morrison says \\"yeah\\" with the guitar playing as if the couple are making drunk love afterward is a hoot, as is the whole song. \\"Maggie M'Gill\\" is not a song to be taken seriously. I haven't gotten to the bad news aside from the three boring songs that appear on the album. The bad news is that Ray Manzarek's organ is less prominent than on previous works. I think the reason for this is because the Doors brought in a bass player on some of the songs to achieve a more guitar-based overall sound. Don't get me wrong, I love Krieger's guitar; always have, always will. It's just that I love Manzarek's organ playing just as much. Having said that, when Manzarek's organ/piano is audible, as in \\"You Make Me Real\\", \\"Ship of Fools\\", and \\"Land Ho!\\", the results are fantastic. \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" is a rousing bar rock standard and will never ever get old. \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" is slow but not boring since the band's musicianship is very commanding throughout the song. \\"Queen of the Highway\\" sounds autobiographical and could be about Morrison's relationship to Pam Courson at the time. The album on the whole is bluesy, but not quite as bluesy (or effective) as L.A. Woman (which won the 1971 Album of the Year award in France). Consider this the fourth best album in the Doors catalog.ng throughout the song. \\"Queen of the Highway\\" sounds autobiographical and could be about Morrison's relationship to Pam Courson at the time.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD has changed the way I look at working out.     Not only do I just plain NOT like working out with a DVD for an hour, I really don't have the time (with 3 kids) for that.    This DVD allows me to have a challenging, entertaining (with 3 different circuits, different workouts in each) workout that I can fully complete in only 25 minutes!    After reading some of the other reviews, I decided to rotate through the levels. My schedule is this: Mon. Level 1, Tue. Level 2, Wed. Level 3, Thur. Level 1, Fri. Level 2, Sat. Level 3, and rest on Sunday.    I love it and am now addicted. I'm literally a slave to these workouts! I try to do them in the morning, but if something comes up and I go all day without working out, I WILL NOT put my head to my pillow without doing this first. It's so easy to do, because it's only 25 minutes. There is no way I'd be able to commit to do the same with an hour-long DVD.    And with all this, I've lost 10 pounds so far, and am only a couple weeks into it (without following the eating plan). I can see the definition in my legs, arms and tummy.    I HIGHLY recommend this DVD.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|Funny movie, fantastic actors, great for adults but clean enough that the kids can watch (and will enjoy too).
B0014I4KH6|5.0|Taylor's first album sounds more like country music than her second album. The songs are also more acoustic in a way. I recomend you buy it, if you haven't, and see how Taylor's music has changed.    I really enjoyed this album, and my favorite tracks are:  Picture To Burn  Teardrops on my Guitar  Should've Said No  Our Song  I'm Only Me When I'm With You (my all time favorite)  Perfectly Good Heart
0061733199|5.0|I like this book.  The illustrations are top notch, but it would be nice if they had full color photos for some cases.  It contains a good base of survival information, but one would probably benefit by seeking out other manuals to compliment this one depending on where or what you are specifically doing.  Regardless! You won't be disappointed in this book!!!
076781214X|4.0|There are many things I like about this movie and all those reasons have been said before here. It's so hard to find scripts today with even average mature adult dialogue out of the US industry. Whenever I watch it it's always a treat to hear some great moments of dialogue that say so much with so few words and get you thinking if I was in there position revisiting my past...wouldn't that be interesting?    Some people don't care for Nicolas' performance, but again, he has some excellent dialogue with Peggy. What a great script sharing thoughts of mature people but in a more light hearted way instead of reality TV conflicts.    Kathleen does give a great performance but so do others. Barbara Harris, Joan Allen (where I first took notice of this excellent actress), Maureen O'Sullivan and then look for young Jim Carrey (not overplayed, overly comical, perfectly cast) and others.    I would love to go back for a short visit my parents and grandparents and face what would I say to them knowing what I know now. This movie did that well without making it overly comical when say Marty goes back and visits his parents in Back to the Future. That's not to criticize Back to the Future, different kind of movie and I loved those scenes. Peggy Sue Got Married is a warmer fuzzier approach to what could be sci-fi plot, time travel no less. It really let's us know that we do change as we age, and sometimes that change results in a life that is incoherent with the past, especially the relationships we started with innocence and love, and precious honesty. How and why do we let go of that? When is right? When is a detriment? That's what Peggy comes to face, and perhaps she will find herself healed and renewed.
B00006JKOL|5.0|First I've got to say that this was the very first Jethro Tull album I ever bought (on vinyl). Over the years it has been long overlooked and the opportunity to grab this remastered CD was the ideal opportunity to reacquaint myself. I haven't made it all the way through yet, so I can't comment on the bonus tracks, but everything about the regular album is just as I remembered it from my youth with one exception.    At the end of Baker Street Muse, after the song itself has concluded, the tapes keep rolling as Ian Anderson walks out of the studio singing. You can hear the door handle being rattled, and he exclaims \\"I Can't Get Out\\". However, this is abruptly cut short on my version, and takes away a lot of the humor that was Jethro Tull (as we remember Anderson's ragging on the late John Glascock over the riding crop he carried in his suitcase, and David Palmer's bladder problems on Bursting Out).    With that small problem aside, this should be in any record/CD collection, not just that of a Tull fan, who would have it already.    My favorite track has, and always will be Minstrel In The Gallery itself, and after a long break it's good to hear it in all its glory.    Buy this!!!
B001I10ABE|4.0|I'm not here to debate how this album does / does not belong in Metallica's portfolio.  I am a fan of their \\"mainstream\\" music, I think they are amazing in their creativity, sound, and professional commitment.  Their early stuff is too hard for me but I like this particular album.    The vinyl set is nicely done...well packaged; sounds great; very quiet.  My only ding to four stars is the sound of \\"Nothing Else Matters\\"...their biggest \\"top 40\\" song in the set!  As another reviewer complained, I too wonder if there is something wrong with the pressing.  [I have a high end sysatem so, it's not me.]  It's the only track where the \\"s\\" sound comes out as \\"zzzz\\".  For example, '...so close\\" is \\"...zzo clozzzzz\\" and \\"...nothing else matters...\\" is \\"...nothing elzzzz matterzzz...\\"  And it's not on all the vocals or the entire track either.  The instrumentals are as pristine on this track.    I've been unsuccessful in reaching Warner Bros. to see if there is a manufacturing problem (I doubt it), and I don't have the CD version to compare.
B002T45VX6|3.0|I missed Shakira's old songs about love and more important things in life. All the songs in this album seem so dumb and make her seem promiscuous. Some songs like Gypsy resemble the old Shaki but aren't as great. I think she should have stuck to her roots.    I wasn't compleatly dissapointed though. There were some songs I liked:  Did It Again - Lo Hecho Esta Hecho  Good Stuff  Gypsy  Mon Amour    But other songs were compleatly ridiculous:  She Wolf (I should have known it wasn't a great album when I heard this single.)  Long Time - Años Luz (She mentions how she can go \\"a long time\\" and is \\"breaking the record\\", which sounds wrong.)  Men In This Town (it wouldn't have been so bad if she hadn't mentioned how \\"Matt Damon is not meant for me\\" but that ruined the song for me. It just sounds ridiculous in my opinion.)    I really had high hopes and was let down. Shakira tried too hard to be a hit with this album and it doesn't happen when you try so hard.
0938045695|5.0|This is an excellent way to improve your conditioning.  I was surprised at how hard my heart was beating. This is not an all encompassing book as far as different types of exercises, but it is all encompassing when it comes to the basic kettlebell movements.  Pavel will teach you how to do it correctly.  You could seriously hurt yourself if you do not practice what Pavel illustrates in this book.  I would get the DVD to.
1416585710|3.0|What is up with all the freaks carrying on about a simple made up language in this book? Hell, just read it as it was intended, to bring you into the character's lives, and let it go at that. I can understand not thinking this is the best SK book, but to base your entire review on nitpicking that language is ridiculous. On the other extreme, this is by far not the worst SK book, as has been stated. Evidently the Constant Readers in the crowd are not particularly constant. This novel falls solidly in the middle third of King's work, and works well as a glimpse into the power of the creative mind and the depth of love between spouses told through memory (as one spouse is dead). Beyond this, the book did get bogged down with the alternate storyline of Dooley and Scott Landon's abusive father, though I did like the 'bad gunky' reference. Pretty funny. There were quite a few references to other King works (always a plus for Constant Readers), and the other world where Scott travels was great. Personally, I wanted more of that, and less love story and Dooley angst. Ah well. Overall, this was a decent novel for fans of SK, as his writing was hitting on all cylinders and the dialogue was superb. For a newcomer to King's work, this would never be a good first choice. One should go classic initially, with IT, 'Salems Lot, or The Shining, then build into the newer works. As for the aggravating language crowd, try Wolves of the Calla and the later Dark Tower novels. Calla speak is much more tedious, but the excellence of the Dark Tower series overall trumps all tedium.

0199539103|5.0|Nearly ninety years after its first publication, _The Beautiful and Damned_ is still a shockingly relevant account of the entitlement class, the children of the rich or privileged who don't know how to navigate through life without big money.  And, it's a New York City novel--written as only a mid-westerner can.  It seems to me that because New Yorkers are too much in the middle of it to see themselves clearly, an intelligent \\"outsider\\" like F. Scott Fitzgerald must come along.  To write as well as he did, Fitzgerald let the city inhabit him.  New York got into his blood, and he recorded it in narrative right down to the dirt under the carpet.  Fitzgerald's details lead the reader into the depths of the beautiful and doomed couple, the Gloria-Anthony entanglement, as they are part and parcel of the extremes of poverty and wealth (in the World War I era or the roaring 20s).<br /><br />I don't know how Fitzgerald knew what he knew about the human psyche, or specifically about how a young man might react when he is good-looking and swimming in money and New York, but Fitz's life at Princeton University among this set of people gave him the environment in which to observe; Fitzgerald supplied the story around which the narrative coheres.  Of course, there are autobiographical elements to this novel--a lot of himself and Zelda--but what the literary art requires is critical distance.  To put his main characters through some shameful scenes, Fitzgerald had to know what tough love is in the New York City context.  He had to put his couple to the test, people who from birth had relied on the \\"religion\\" of charm and money.  And the author had more than just critical distance: F. Scott had them down right!  Every expression, every word.  Gloria: \\"This is life!  Who cares for the morrow.\\"  And you can see Anthony deciding to have one more drink, his speech becoming slurred, his manners maudlin.  While Anthony and Gloria wait for his inheritance, we find out what they're made of.<br /><br />Most pleasurable about Fitzgerald's craft is his carefully-controlled technique of letting Anthony and Gloria visit hell (the \\"damned\\" in the title) while softening the harsh surgery-like light with well-timed, well-handled, lyrical sentences.  In a single beautiful line, the passage of the winter sun describes both Fitzgerald's craft and his beautiful couple's descent: Gloria \\"lay still for a moment in the great bed watching the February sun suffer one last attenuated refinement in its passage through the leaded panes into the room\\" (p.173).  Fitzgerald knew how to show the attenuated and refined way downhill.<br /><br />One more thing about the craft of writing: Only the omniscient narrator technique--which Fitzgerald employs--can show characters in shameful acts and show what they're thinking, and the circumstances in which they got there, and how they \\"need\\" money in order to \\"survive.\\"  I wonder if now, in nearly 2010, this novel is not more important than in 1922.  More than ever, _The Beautiful and Damned_ is a national portrait.  (I can see how \\"spending\\" money could be the \\"sex\\" in the novel.)<br /><br />Advice: Read this novel while in New York, if possible.  The first time I read _The Beautiful and Damned_, I was living near 123rd (me, a Westerner!).  I looked up every address in the novel (except for the gray house near Cos Cob, Conn.) and got to know New York through this novel.  In fact, I could almost pick out their final apartment in Harlem near 127th.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I workout ALL of the time and LOVE all three of her DVDs, 30 Day Shred, Banish Fat Boost Metabolism, and No More Trouble Zones.  Seriously, all 3 are awesome videos especially for ladies' trouble zones.  I feel it in my toosh, thighs, and abs.  30 Day Shred especially rocks because if you're short on time but want to feel like you had a decent workout, you'll get it.  I'm sweating in 5 mins!  This video is not for beginners or unmotivated people! Besides the amazing workouts, the price of all 3 makes them even better.  I ordered all 3 together on Amazon and got free shipping for $25, what could be better?

B0011KQSZ4|2.0|How do you do an: English comedy with English actors, set in England and written by an Englishman - and still screw it up? Hire an American to direct the film.<br /><br />I mean no offense to Frank Oz, whom I personally admire - not only for his ability as a writer/actor/director/voice of Ms. Piggy - but \\"Death At A Funeral\\" is such an incredible bore-fest of wasted talent and lost opportunities.<br /><br />After reading the review by Amazon's Kathleen C. Fennessy, I have to admit at being surprised that she credits Oz for having been born in the UK as some God-given inheritance of British humor and filmmaking. Trust me - it doesn't. That's why being born asian doesn't mean you'll become the next Bruce Lee; an incidental burst of amniotic fluid to a locale will not transfer the cultural heritage of a people 'just because'.<br /><br />Are there some mildly amusing moments - yes. Alan Tudyk certainly puts all of his craft on display and wings out a wonderful smirk or two as he is accidentally given an experimental hallucinogen. But the laughs are few and very far between.

B000AGTPUK|2.0|I have owned the book upon which the movie was based since it was first published. It was in our home before it received the Caldecott Award and I have read it to my baby daughter every year since it was published. She and I hear the bell and we always will. There are few books that compare favorably with this one.      The movie is something else again. The film maintains the general story line of the book while complicating a sweet and engaging story in a manner that is neither necessary nor appropriate. It takes less than ten minutes to read the perfect story and it takes ten times that for the the movie to run. The book never fails to maintain an interest level from start to finish and the movie does not.      Get the book, read it to your baby girl on the evening of December 23, watch her eyes grow wide, read The Night Before Christmas to her on Christmas Eve and again watch her eyes. Listen with her for the ringing of the bell and you will hear it. And, you will see it in her eyes and she will see it in yours.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|Inglourious Basterds is probably one of the 50 best films I've ever seen. It's also one of the few Tarantino films I've actually loved or even enjoyed. I walked out of Pulp Fiction, but I saw Inglourious Basterds ten times in the theater before it eventually closed. I probably would have seen it a few more times, and plan on buying the Blu-Ray as well. It's just flat-out great entertainment, intelligently done, immensely satisfying.<br /><br />It's so rare for a film to be engrossing, sophisticated, willing to defy political correctness (or even rise above it), appealing to both the intellectual's and the common man's tastes, violent and action-packed yet refined, funny and also devastating, profound, upsetting and yet pleasurable and deeply aesthetic, but IB is all of these things, and more.<br /><br />The performances and the casting that made them possible really rise to the highest level. In recent years I've come to realize how critically important the art of casting is to filmmaking. There should be some prominent award for it, imo, maybe an Oscar category on the main Oscar night.<br /><br />If Cristoph Waltz doesn't win the Best Actor Oscar I think AMPAS should be firebombed. But seriously, please don't mention the Supporting Oscar, Waltz is the BEST ACTOR, PERIOD. There WAS NO better performance by an actor in all of 2009, and not any in the last ten years that I can think of.<br /><br />I think the Best Supporting could go instead to Michael Fassbender, whose performance as Lieutenant Archie Hicox was exquisitely entertaining. I also loved Diane Kruger as Bridget von Hammersmark, especially in the tavern scene. Listen, every single performance in this movie was superb, but I really think Waltz must get the Best Actor Oscar if there is any justice in this world.<br /><br />This was a true \\"Great\\" film, right up there with the best films ever. Yes, Quentin, as you yourself wrote and directed in the final shot, this IS a \\"masterpiece\\". I couldn't have said it better myself. Thank you. Keep making films like this, and I'll keep going to the theater to see them ten times each, and then buy the DVD's. This is exactly the kind of movie that I am willing to spend serious money on.films like this, and I'll keep going to the theater to see them ten times each, and then buy the DVD's.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|Superb.  Awesome visuals and even a great plot, even if its repetitive and shallow at times.  We all need to escape from time to time (i.e., the definition of a movie, a fantasy world), and be reminded of what's important in life and the evils that we still need to overcome.  I enjoyed it immensely.  Can't wait for its sequel. Lots of action, a terrific diversion, and good moral topics to reflect upon.  Go enjoy.
1594488916|1.0|The author is obviously a journalist, not a book lover. She seems indifferent to the plight of book dealers and libraries victimized by this thief. By the way, did she ever return the Krautterbuch to the library from which it was obviously stolen? Or is she happy with the deception of \\"the borrower of a book of indeterminate provenance? Is book theft OK if you can get away with it, or simply rationalize it? Sounds like Gilkey!

0375854819|2.0|Like a good number of people who've reviewed this book, I'm a writer who's hoping to get a fantasy novel published. Along the way, I've purchased and read my way through a lot of fiction to train myself; \\"Brisingr\\" is, by far, the most important book I've read since I first began my training.     When I bought this, I told myself, \\"I don't care if it's good or bad. I just want to learn something from it.\\" At a gut level I knew it would be disappointing. I sensed it when I first picked up the book and held it in my hands.  It's more than a year later, and it's taken me this long to read through the book twice, and I still don't remember most of what happened in the book.     But here's the truth: It was a purchase I'm proud of.     I've read hundreds of reviews of the book and at least a thousand of the entire Inheritance Cycle, and I've come across a lot of great advice. But nothing has helped me more than actually struggling through the book. By reading it word for word, I got to step into Paolini's shoes and understand his thought processes as he wrote the book. As a result, it's taught me some things to keep in mind as I write fiction. Here are a few that tie into my issues with \\"Brisingr\\":       1) Eragon is worsening as a character. I can't get around it. The more I read his dialogue, the more I can't stand him. There's nothing that I can relate to. There's nothing I can admire. There's nothing that makes me want to keep reading about him. Of course, he still has to defeat King Galbatorix, but there's nothing else in his life or personality that I can fall back on. Every word out of his mouth sounds forced: the more I read his dialogue, the more he sounds like Paolini instead of like a fresh, original character with a mind of his own.     This happens because Eragon was poorly developed right from the get-go. He's simply a stock superhero. Most of his plot's substance was spent on the first two books, and now he's trying to take care of loose ends in the thirdbook. The seven promises don't have anything to do with killing King Galbatorix and the Ra'zac; they instead have to do with a massive trudge through dwarf gods, Alagaësian politics, and people bowing in his presence. All this could have been interesting if Eragon were a stronger character. But he wasn't created to deal with all of that. He was created to defeat an evil king with the help of his dragon.  As long as he's a stock superhero, he needs to stay a stock superhero, and the pros and cons of such a life need to be fleshed out in their entirety.    Paolini said that the book's main storyline featuring Eragon was too large to fit into the volume, so he split the book into two volumes so that Eragon (and the rest of the cast) could grow more. Aside from my disbelief, there's a problem with that logic: a published book should never be spent with an author trying to figure his characters out. Doing this brings the story to a dead-stop. What happens is that the author engineers a story instead of losing himself in it. It's always better to create good characters and storyworld elements before you write. The sooner it happens, the sooner the characters and world will take on lives of their own. What ends up happening is that the characters create events and conflict on their own. Characters should determine plot, not the other way around.     To me, Eragon has always been a case of being a product of the plot. He was created to be the one who takes down the evil king. But what if more time were spent crafting Eragon's history and personality? Perhaps he wouldn't have been an orphaned farmboy. He could have been nobility, the son of a soldier, or a scholar. Maybe he wouldn't have been born with magical abilities. He could have been compassionate, or funny, or a kid who never wants to grow up. But the plot that Paolini created doesn't allow room for possibilities like that. Plots never do. Eragon is so locked into his plot that he never had room to change. It would probably give the story a facelift if Eragon were to say, \\"I'm done going after Galbatorix. I want to do what I really want to do! The Varden can handle this.\\" But because of how much Paolini crafted his plot first and foremost, that just won't happen.       2) The writing is weak. This has been debated long after the cows have come home, but here's my two cents' worth. After reading \\"Brisingr,\\" I've realized that writing style ties directly into content and characters. If you have strong characters and a well-developed storyworld, then you've already saved yourself the trouble of figuring out what they are, and you can spend more time (and less effort) telling a story. In other words, the stronger your content and characters, the stronger the writing style is likely to be.     Like both books before it, \\"Brisingr\\" suffers from the same cast of weak characters and the same derivative, underdeveloped storyworld. As a result, Paolini has to word and re-word the smallest details to make something seem original. This makes the details more important than the story and the characters. Details shouldn't obscure what you're trying to say; otherwise, they take the clarity and power out of the sentences they fill. Too many details sacrifice clarity, emotion, and substance.  If you don't have good characters and settings to use, details are all you can use.    Paolini knows that the picture you paint for your audience is all about the details, but it's the sheer number of them that makes the book so bloated. There are so many details that it's a struggle to find out what he's trying to say. The content that lies beneath the details is just not there. Details are important only as long as they're based on good content. They have to contribute directly to the story, the characters, and the picture that the audience is seeing painted. The level of details can mean the difference between enjoying a painting from a distance and looking at it through a magnifying glass. In other words, which is better: looking at the brush strokes or looking at the whole picture?       3) For all its length, it doesn't get to the point. It takes way too long to get to anything remotely important or interesting, and most of the time, those interesting points never come.  \\"Brisingr\\" and its sequel could fit into the same 750-page book; you can cut out most of what happens in this book and not lose any important details. If anything, it would benefit the book. The faster that the characters go toward their goals, the faster you get to the heart of the story. The old cliché is the best: \\"Just cut to the chase.\\"     Both \\"Eragon\\" and \\"Eldest\\" had their share of filler--a lot of traveling in \\"Eragon\\" and a lot of training in \\"Eldest\\"--but \\"Brisingr\\" was the worst. Eragon spent so much time trying to fulfill his list of promises that it kept him (and us) from seeing him fulfill his main goal: going after the people who killed his family and destroyed his home. That's what the story's supposed to be about, and every character and subplot should reinforce it.      I have to give the book at least one star because it's helped me understand some of the things to avoid when writing fiction. Still, I feel like a two-star rating is generous. \\"Brisingr\\" was a great training tool but a disappointing entertainment; it was a bore from start to finish.  If this indicates how Book 4 will be, I won't buy it.  There's only so much I can support a book series and feel rewarded by it.    It's tough for me to praise this book, especially since I had such a struggle reading it through twice. The few highlights of this book are a poor reward for more than seven hundred pages of filler. Paolini needs an editor who will show him the things that make a good story. There's no excuse for his age anymore. When you publish anything, it's not your age or your accomplishments that matter most. It's the story that matters most. I would rather read the seven pages that mean something than the seven hundred that don't.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This is the only one of the three CD's that I have played. I enjoy it very much. It is outstanding Music.
B0026P3G12|4.0|As with all albums, I did not like all the songs.  The quality of the CD is excellent.
B002Z4C3K4|5.0|It's easy to forget that Cliff Richard and The Shadows were only together for ten years, 1958-1968 or perhaps more accurately 1959 -1968. They were the soundtrack of my life through those teenage years of mine. This DVD and concert represent that period in their history. Anyone looking for Cliff songs after that period (Devil Woman, Miss You Nights, We Don't Talk Anymore, From a Distance and so on) will not find them here.     The quality of this DVD is outstanding. It is so well filmed that you only rarely see a camera, the sound is crisp and, as mentioned in other reviews, not a lip-syncher in sight. We were fortunate to be at the Sheffield concert on Cliff's 69th birthday and can vouch that this DVD is the complete concert. Even the beginning pictures of microphones and guitars are exactly what are seen in the arena. It is just like being at the concert. The Shadows were in fine form for their set. I personally would have loved it had they played `Flingel Bunt' but it was not to be. And does anybody look like they are having a better time than Hank Marvin? The sounds that he gets out of a guitar are extraordinary.     All 42 songs are great. My only disappointment is with `Willie and the Hand Jive'. I wish they had performed the original Hank solo at the beginning instead of a newer arrangement. But I nitpick. For the traditionalist, it was interesting to see that the version of `Move It' they performed only includes the original 1958 words; it does not include the additional verse written I think some 20 years later.     I recommend this DVD to anyone who was there on this tour. It is a priceless souvenir. I also recommend it to anyone who couldn't go. Once you view this DVD, you'll think you were there.
B0015AARJI|2.0|Bummer controller.  It would have been 'okay' as a controller if the tiny joysticks weren't pretty much off/on for fine control.  Man! it is really tough controlling a car driving a hundred fifty mph when a tiny movements on the toggle stick finally whips the steering wheel like 20 degrees.  I can't believe how large a dead zone this gizmo has in these controls.  Sadly I bought two of them in a package deal, so I doubly regret this limitation.  Otherwise, the controller would be fine.  It just seems like sony cannot get it slider type controls right, where I own a sony video camera that makes a huge popping sound with its zoom button control and is almost impossible to not intrude this noise into the video...crapola.<br />In short, the PS3 is an okay toy for most people, where I like it for the netflix and blue ray that I bought it for.  But I would've liked to also be able to stand to play the games too.  Must be fine for shoot em ups only.  What's up with that?<br />H

B00005QGAV|5.0|Dangerous is Michael Jackson's 4th Studio Album, and its just incredible, and wonderfully diverse. The first six songs are bumpin party jams such as Jam, In The Closet, She Drives Me Wild, and the timeless classic Remember The Time. The album features the anthems Heal The World, and Will You Be There, which motivate us all. Then comes the smash hit of the century Black Or White. Then comes Who Is It, a masterpiece in itself. Then Give In To Me, a excellent song about the want of the opposite sex, with a excellent rock edge. Then Gone Too Soon, a short but touching song about aids victim Ryan White. Then you have Dangerous, the albums title track, which is just incredible lyrically, and production wise. This album is new jack swing perfection, motivational, and inspirational, by far my favorite from MJ.     Lets RATE Song By Song    1. Jam - Inspirational, Catchy 5/5  2. Why You Wanna Trip On Me - Personal 5/5  3. In The Closet - Sexual, Bumpin, Catchy 5/5  4. She Drives Me Wild - Catchy, Wild, Funky 5/5  5. Remember The Time - Classic 5/5  6. Can't Let Her Get Away - 90's Classic, Catchy 5/5  7. Heal The World - Motivational 5/5  8. Black Or White - Anti - Racist, Powerful 5/5  9. Who Is It - True, Personal 5/5  10. Give Into To Me - Rock, Sexual 5/5  11. Will You Be There - Inspirational - 4/5  12. Keep The Faith - Okay - 3/5  13. Gone Too Song - Touching 5/5  14. Dangerous - Dance Perfection 5/5    INCREDIBLE
B002XMGGK6|1.0|This movie until the last 5 mins was really great, could have been one of the best movies of 2009 - but then the horrendous ending came along and totally killed the WHOLE movie. This movie falls flatter than a pancake at Wafflehouse. I mean the first 90ish minutes is a 5 star movie, ending drops it to 1.<br /><br />****SPOILERS****<br />Why would I want to see a movie where the morally bankrupt lawyer wins!? In a situation where the protagonists' wife and 10-year old daughter are raped and murdered, the entire system deserves to be brought down. If I go to a movie where the system screws over the little guy and that little guy comes back to dish out real justice, I absolutely, positively DO NOT want to see the \\"system\\" win in the end, regardless of any Hollywood-ed glossed over change of heart the corrupt lawyer might happen to have. Just goes to show that even in making the movie about Selling out - the Director sells the audience out as well.<br />****SPOILERS****

B001NEK2GE|1.0|I bought this to replace my trusty Belkin n52.     The hardware build quality is good. But the mac drivers are absolutely terrible.

B0002XMF5I|2.0|As I have heard from many other reviewers, I am a huge Sabbath fan.  Not just the Ozzy or Dio Years.  I have a collection to include all of the solo efforts of every single original member, and I have to say that to include Iommi's soft rock Seventh Star, this is the weakest effort by far.  Even with some of the jazz inspired pieces by Bill Ward, there was at least talant and inspiration for what they were trying to accomplish, after all Black Sabbath was initially a Rythem and Blues band, and full of very talented musicians who would succeed at just about any genre of music they attempted, so why is this so god awful to listen to.  After Dio left, Sabbath was still a label that inspired confidence.  I know that the dio fans don't want to hear this, but Sabbath mellowed down with him some to accomidate a hard rock label, that was more radio friendly, and they did a very respectable job of it, but from what i gatter from interviews, all involved were heavily into drugs and it might have had something to do with dio's departure from the band after he was accused of tampering with the mix on Live Evil from a Coked out perspective of Geezer Butler and Toni Iommi, There was a frenzy to find a new singer, and also a singer with some weight behind him,<br /><br />Dio was the former singer of then heavyweight Rainbow, and Ozzy was still a big name to fill, so with all rumors of trying to get Ian Gillian circling even before they were able to get Dio, meanwhile Ian was off doing Jesus Christ Superstar of all things, finally needed more steady imployment.  Not many interviews are dedicated to this album, and for good reason as I am sure that all involved would like to forget it, so I can not say whether Ian was involved in the anarchy that can be heavy drug use, but so many different and good ideas are thrown in here but never really mesh.  I have read many articles by Iomi about different composition methods regarding different Sabbath singers.  Ozzy would not have a strongenough voice to sing through power chords so there would be breaks for the lyrics of old Sabbath songs, helping them to achieve that awsome rythem stop and go.  Dio had a strong voice that they were able to play through to get an 80's hard rock ballad smothness, and there was no though put into Gillian.  Bill Ward returned to Sabbath for this album for the first time in two Sabbath projects, so the music does seem to have familiar rythem, but it really does sound like the arrangements of when Gillian comes in feel rushed, like he doesn't know what he is doing, and the whole album feels rushed.  They try very hard to heavy and succeed so I can understand why the hard and heavy black metal fans flock to this album, which i understand originally had very poor production quality not evident in the re release that I purchased, but by 1983 there were so many other great examples in the genre that I don't understand the need to praise this album.  If you are looking for that check out old Death, Deacide, Venom, and Celtic Frost.  All the songs feel rushed and it is credit to band that they come out as good as they do, but as much as I do like Gillian, he ruins this album.<br /><br />I understand that coming to a new band, a band that is already known for something, that you need to bring something new of yourself and familiar fo sabbath fans, but he never found a way to mesh with the band.  He comes in trying to sound like a mad man and after subsequent spins wonder if he really was going mad not know when to jump in.  You can start to hear an almost rock opera of dark tones that would become sabbgath during the Tony Martin years, but it just seemed to be more worked out by then.  The lyrics are really bad here, everything that is part of the planning for a record is horrible here, and this band is too new to wing it like they did, and they paid the price as the \\"band\\" broke up after this leaving Iommi to keep the Sabbath name by himself, partly because the record companywould not allow him to make Solo projects.  This of course does not count for the later Dio album Dehumanizer that is the best post Ozzy album to me, or last year's The Devil you know, which was only mildly disappointing after hearing the bonus tracks for the dio years best of, but as repetative as that album is, at least they didn't try to reivent the wheel and fail like they did here.  For extreme collectors only.
B002PMV9FG|1.0|Production Values:    I don't know if it was purposefully photographed so darkly that very little could be seen and that little was colorless/lifeless or if it was as another reviewer wrote a copy of a copy of a copy, but it was bad.    The Movie:    Marginally better than its production values, disjointed, boring and really didn't go anywhere. Have them all, wish I hadn't bought this one and won't be buying the next (if there is one).
1433502410|5.0|I have had my NIV Study Bible for many years and it served me well. I then read a piece by Ps. Mark Driscoll on the difference between Dynamic and Literal translations. It really spoke to me and since I respect him, I wanted to get the Bible he recommended.<br /><br />I first bought the ESV hard cover non-Study version, but I found the print a fraction too small. I gifted that to my daughter, and bought the burgundy leather Study Bible whose print is slightly larger and also more white space on the page. It is now my Church and Study Bible and I love it, (and it's Author) dearly!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|First...Pepper, Pepper, Pepper!!! I hadn't heard it in mono since my old LPs went to heaven. It is so much better in mono. It sounds as I remember it. Much more powerful than the stereo version.     Couple of little things that I haven't seen anybody mention..in 'A Day in the Life' after Paul's 'woke up, got out of bed' bit and before John reads the news again, oh boy, there's a orchestral section with John singing on top. I remember listening to this as a kid and it was quite majestic sounding on LP. Then the 80s stereo CD was issued, and John's ethereal 'aah' over the orchestra was now spun around the speakers, and was buried just enough to lose the glorious effect. Also in 'Lucy in the Sky' there's some whatsit (phased guitar perhaps) that tracks the melody along with John's singing. In mono it blends into one instrument. In stereo instead of the blend you get to hear the ingredients, which is not nearly so interesting.    One other little thing that I haven't seen elsewhere.....on 'Slow Down' there's a piano that plays a very simple double of the bass line. In mono it's there if you listen for it, but it's not very prominent and is intended to simply bolster the bass riff, not stand out. In the old stereo CD issues, this dopey piano part stood out like a sore thumb. Drove me crazy every time I heard it.    Anyone looking for advice as to whether to buy, I'd recommend James Perlman's review. For me the greatest improvement is having everything from Beatles For Sale - Sgt Pepper in mono. They just sound better.     And again. Pepper, Pepper Pepper!!!
B002JIEYL2|5.0|Sabbath Bloody Sabbath really should have been the send off to Ozzy Sabbath.  It was their last truly great album.  The Title track has so many rythem changes that are all awsome that it really was the blue-print for all metal to this day.  There would be no heavy metal if not for this album, but there is a lot of filler.  There are some really good songs also on this album, Spiral Architect and Killing myself to live are good, but don't compare with track number one.  If not a true Sabbath fan might want to just pick up a sabbath greatest hits that hit the high points of this album.  The albums you really want to hear all of are Masters of Reality and Paranoid.  Still Great cover art and what a great send off.
B001PO53IO|4.0|After the disappointment of the prequel feature films, I would not have expected that an animated TV show would be what got me excited about being a STAR WARS fan again. I liked the Clone Wars feature film, but this method of expanding the Star Wars universe really comes into its own with the first full season of THE CLONE WARS. The series has been a great way of introducing Star Wars to my young sons, but I brought the Blu-ray of season one for me...and I've enjoyed sitting down by myself to watch this great-looking, entertaining and superbly cinematic show. TRESPASS and HOSTAGE CRISIS were, for me, the highlights, though a high standard is maintained over all 22 episodes (even, amazingly, the ones 'starring' Jar Jar). The BluRay presentation does the quality of the production justice. My single gripe would be that I don't know what to do with the onsert that comes with the gorgeous book-style packaging. Bring on season two!
0446581348|4.0|I am in my 50's and have been doing my makeup almost the same since I was a teen.  This looks as if it will help me to really learn how to do things right, more needed in 50's then it was in teens and 20's...mistakes show up 3 times as much now.  I got one for my daughter, in her late 20's, also.  Good to help her learn the basic's then she can do whatever on top of that.  I have looked at other so called makeup books in the past and they may  have had a page or two that really showed something but did not really help you learn makeup.  I wish this one showed a bit more on the types of makeup now.  Such as, I have found that light glitter or whatever it is, in eyeshadow or lipstick/gloss seem to help hid wrinkles, etc.  but to much makes it worse.

B002JIEYLW|4.0|I grimace to not give this great album a five star rating, but if I gave it five stars i would grimace at that too.  This is the first sabbath album that you can start to see the cracks.  The first three sabbath albums are amazing from begginning to end, and though this has some genre defining greatness that would inspire for generations, there is also some filler.  It seemed that this is when the Ozzy era sabbath started to pace themselves.  I can understand that there was a need to get out albums quickly but that also leads to sloppy tracks.  Supernaut and Snowblind are two of my favorite tracks of all time, but I look at my real player score based on how I rate each song and it comes out to less than four stars, and I can't help but wonder if that is fair considering how great the good songs are.  It is also evident in the next two albums, with Sabbath bloody sabbath being the only great song off that album and though there are good songs, the album seems lacking to me, and sabatage lacks even one great track, then you get into the death throws of the band with their last two albums with ozzy.  I can only wonder what would have happened if they just toook their time or stayed away from the inspiration for Snow Blind but in a lot of ways, I wouldn't want to change anything, because when this album gets cooking, there is nothing in all rock and metal for this to be compared to.
0316035904|5.0|Love, love, love David Sedaris.  It's a great take on the holidays: snarky and dark and it fills a void in the sometimes over-merrified season.  The recording of Holidays on Ice is worth checking out, too.  It's fun to hear how he interprets his work.
0156421178|5.0|This is just a great book. As a North American, I have long been confused about the realities, circumstances and forces at work in the Spanish Civil War of the late 1930's which led to Franco's long, loathsome tenure as dictator.<br /> I will keep this short, but if you are having any qualms about \\"wasting your time reading outdated history\\" or what not, don't think twice, even if you don't purchase this one, find a way to read it. This is not only an expertly told account of the real as well as the political nature of what went on (at least from the Loyalist side) during critical points of the Spanish Civil War, but it also serves as a treasure chest full of information beneficial to any persons interested in resisting the forces of fascism (corporate capitalism and its enforcer, the police state) which grip us daily in a tighter and tighter strangle hold in the modern world. I would suggest it as must-read material for any would-be revolutionary, protestor or freedom fighter in that it details many of the same forces that would inevitably be in play, even to this day (although undoubtedly given different names), should an uprising occur.
1416594787|5.0|This book changed my self-perception. The Greatest Show on Earth is a beautiful and utterly convincing account of how humans (and all other creatures) came to be through the agency of natural selection. For those of us given to introspection, and, dare I say it, metaphysics, this book goes a long way to sharpening the boundaries between what we really do understand, and what we don't (yet). I will always now be aware of my reptilian components, of the insane route over the kidney taken by one of the tubes feeding my testes, and so many much more of the incontestable evidence for evolution. Thank you professor Dawkins!  This book just about closes the door on the spurious debate created by the theists. Of course, and by his own admission, what Dawkins cannot explain, is what 'life' actually is. So although we may now be confident in the common genetic heritage of all living things, we are left with the mystery of the first 'living' organism. That's not to say that 'God did it', but it does seem that creation of the first organism is all that's left for the creationists to cling to.  My one criticism of this book is entirely unjust, but here goes: Dawkins' primary purpose in writing The Greatest Show, seems to have been further discrediting creationism. As a geneticist he has done a fine job. However, our general conception of 'being special' centres as much on our conception of consciousness as it does on interpretation of the scriptures. I think therefore that a section on the evolution of consciousness would have added further value. I an well aware of the work of Penrose in this domain, but there is a definite need for the synthesis of works on genetics and consciousness if science is to convince a wider audience of the veracity of its claims in this sensitive area.  A great book nevertheless.
B000SXOI66|5.0|UPDATED REVIEW for the Immersion Box set, 3/7/2012<br /><br />I held off on buying this Immersion Box set until I noticed the price came down to $62.99.  That's about 50% off the original asking price, and I think that is the true value of this box set.  Not much to say about the original album that hasn't already been said.  It's a masterpiece, and sounds as great as ever.  The real treasure here is the second disc, The Wembley '74 show.  It's been bootlegged for years, but now we get the official release.  Disc 6 is pretty cool too.  We get an early version of \\"Dark Side\\" from 1972, as well as some unreleased studio and live recordings.  More demos would have been nice.  The demo for \\"Us and Them\\" is a near identical copy of \\"The Violent Sequence\\" from the \\"Zabriskie Point\\" soundtrack.  I've heard raw demos for both \\"Money\\" and \\"Time\\", but here we only get the demo for \\"Money.\\"  More would have been better.<br /><br />The DVD on disc 4 is pretty much useless to me, since I have a blu ray player, and the exact same material is presented on both discs.  The blu ray is nice, but there isn't really anything I would find myself watching more than once or twice.  The concert screen films are okay, but overall a bit redundant and boring.  Personally, I would have preferred to see the entire Brighton concert, rather than just two songs (which are edited).<br /><br />The swag is the most ridiculous part of the set.  Marbles, scarves, coasters, etc.  Totally useless.  I have two kids (5 and 7) that love those marbles though.  Had I payed $127 for this set, I would have felt ripped off, but thankfully the price has come down to a much more reasonable level.

B00006AFF5|5.0|When I heard they were making a film based on the holiday classic 'How The Grinch Stole Christmas I was apprehensive to say they least! I mean, you just don't fool around with the classics!...right? When I heard Jim Carrey was going to play the Grinch, I figured he'd just might be the guy to pull it off....and pull it off he does in spades! Carrey is a living cartoon to begin with and his physical brand of comedy lends perfectly to this type of film. Ron Howard creates a world that may not be exactly like the beloved cartoon, but it does give you the sense of Whoville and their Christmas obsessed lifestyle. Carrey was also smart to play the Grinch in an original form rather than mimic Karloff from the cartoon. Considering the source in a 20 minute cartoon, Howard also makes a film that is not boring by stretching a small idea into a tedious film. It's a lot of fun and the 2 disc DVD edition is also a treat featuring commentary, outtakes, deleted scenes, Grinch games, making of film, make-up and much more. \\"Tis the season\\" and this film should be in everyone's Christmas collection.

9113020730|5.0|I very rarely write reviews because I feel like good books speak for themselves but The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, the last in the Millenium series is a terrific read!<br />I felt myself completely wrapped up in the workings of Sapo and Salander's mind.  Larsson's ability to express himself in this novel was truly wonderful.  I found myself sitting on the edge of my chair (literally) while reading and in the last few chapters I actually cheered a few times aloud for Advokat Giannini.<br />Larsson's character development is spot on and I highly recommend this series.<br />The one downside was that I had to order this book from amazon in the UK since it is not available in the US yet.
B001EN71DG|5.0|Forget the \\"prequels\\", these are the films to watch.  These were the films that ignited a science fiction craze that continues over three decades later.  Good vs Evil, heroes and villains and a heroine with spunk.  Robots that elicit humor and incredible battle scenes and deep human emotion.  Lucas can retouch them with new and better sfx but the basic wonderful films are there.  For me the best will always remain THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.  A must for any sci-fi library.  Funny when you realize this came about because Lucas couldn't get the rights to do FLASH GORDON !!!  Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Lia, Obi Wan Kenobi, Darth Vader ... classic characters for the ages. A Young Man who becomes a Man and goes the path his Father could not follow.  A star wandering rogue who grows to be a hero.  An Evil Villain who, in the end, finds his humanity.  It doesn't get much better than this.

B002SJIO5E|5.0|Peter Jackson may be known for his work on the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy and \\"King Kong\\" but as producer for the science fiction film \\"District 9', needless to say that with his name attached to this project, many people had high expectations.<br /><br />\\"District 9' is a film adapted from a 2005 short film \\"Alive in Joburg\\" directed by Neill Blomkamp (known for his visual effects work for \\"Smallville\\" and \\"Stargate-SG1') that focused on social segregation.  This time around the film (which was budged for around $30 million) would take events that took place in South Africa in District Six, Cape Town during the apartheid era but bring a sci-fi feel that features aliens instead of humans in a camp located in District 9.<br /><br />Needless to say, TriStar Pictures marketed the film virally on the Internet and despite not having any big name actors in the film, Peter Jackson's name and the teaser trailers featuring the film's awesome special effects would help in creating interest and hype a for the film  and in August 2009, \\"District 9' made $37 million in its opening weekend and eventually making over $204 million worldwide.  Now the film makes its entry to Blu-ray and comes loaded with many Blu-ray exclusive special features and also a digital copy of the film.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"District 9' is featured in 1080p High Definition (1:85:1) and what a gorgeous film does this film turn out to be on Blu-ray.  The film is not only vibrant and colorful, the amount of detail scene is incredible.  From the grime and dirt on Wikus and the surroundings around District 9, to the detail of the clothing and alien and human skin is incredible.  The detail of the broken down, dilapidated slums are brought to life on HD and if anything, this film looks incredible on Blu-ray!  Definitely one of the most amazing looking film to come out on Blu-ray this year from Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.  This is a film that is literally \\"visual eye candy\\", \\"District 9' looks fantastic!<br /><br />As for audio, the lossless audio soundtrack is featured in English and French DTS-HD MA and also features an English audio description track.  And similar to the picture quality of \\"District 9', the lossless audio is also fantastic!  There are many action scenes in this film, so from the radio control communications which you hear on all surround channels, gun shots and alien weaponry blasting to the LFE kicking right when the spacecraft starts to move, I was very impressed.  The soundtrack really creates an immersive soundscape and the fact that all surround channels are being utilized, people who own a 7.1 or higher setup will love how \\"District 9' will sound on their home theater system.  Absolutely fantastic!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, French and Hindi.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"District 9' comes with the following special features featured in High Definition and in English Stereo.  Included are:<br /><br />  * BD Exclusive: MovieIQ - If you have a Blu-ray profile 2.0 player that can connect to the Internet, MovieIQ connects you to access real-time information on the cast, music, trivia and more while watching the movie!<br />  * BD Exclusive: CineChat -If you have a Blu-ray profile 2.0 player that can connect to the Internet, you can send on-screen instant messages to your friends around the world while you watch the movie together.<br />  * BD Exclusive: Joburg From Above: Satellite and Schematics of the World of District 9 - Interactive Map - Using your remote, people can see a satellite view of District 9, the alien mothership and MNU headquarters.  When you click on one of the locations onscreen, you get detailed information and video.  Definitely a pretty cool feature for those who want to learn more about the surroundings of key areas in the film.<br />  * BD Exclusive: GOD OF WAR III playable PlayStation®3 Game Demo and unlock an exclusive making-of the game. - For those that own a Sony PlayStation 3, they can play a demo of the video game and making-of video.<br />  * Director's Commentary - Audio commentary with director/co-writer Neill Blomkamp who is giving commentary before the film came out in theaters.  What is interesting is a discussion about how polluted the area where they shot the film (slum area) with asbestos and chemicals all around.  But overall, good insight from Blomkamp and overall an informative and entertaining commentary.<br />  * Deleted Scenes - (23:26) A total of 23 deleted scenes.  The deleted scenes are actually quite good and could have added more info. to the film.  But I can understand that they were trying to reduce the time for better pacing but definitely worth watching after the film.<br />  * The Alien Agenda: A Filmmaker's Log -- Three-Part Documentary - (34:19) The documentary features how Peter Jackson chose Neill Blomkamp, the collaborative writing project with Terri Tatchell and Blomkamp, filming in South Africa and working with the film with a limited budget.  The second part features the behind-the-scenes of making \\"District 9' and working with the talent.  The third and final part is an interview with Blomkamp and talent during post-production.  Incorporating the sounds, CG and the special effects for the film and how they were accomplished and the challenges of editing the film between documentary and cinematic sequences.<br />  * Metamorphosis: The Transformation of Wikus - (9:52) Discussion of Wikus transformation and Sharlto Copleys experience of having to go through the various transformation.<br />  * Innovation: Acting and Improvisation - (12:04) Behind-the-scenes with how the director's worked with many actors and how the dialogue was mostly improvised.<br />  * Conception and Design: Creating the World of District 9 - (13:18) The conceptual art design and set design for the film.<br />  * Alien Generation: Visual Effects - (10:18) Creating the visual effects for the film and working on a budget.<br /><br />Note: Before the film starts, you get a menu which you can choose human or alien.  As far as I've seen, the changes are just menu driven - one featuring humans with a red color scheme with the other featuring aliens and blue color scheme.  I have not found any easter eggs or anything at this time to show anything significantly different by choosing a certain menu.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />The trailers for \\"District 9' may showcase the film a human vs. alien type of sci-fi film but once you start watching the film from beginning to end, you realize how many layers this film has.  It was not meant to be a political film but yet, the film uses the aliens and the segregation that took part in South Africa and so there is a deep underlying tone to the film.<br /><br />Typically when I see a Summer film or any film that is pushed virally, films such as \\"Cloverfield\\" have left me felt that there was over-reliance on CG and special effects and at first, before watching this film, I was thinking that \\"District 9' would be a film with not much substance but all visually eye candy.  \\"District 9' is visual eye candy but it's the good kind of candy that you want from a Blu-ray release.  Awesome picture and audio quality, a lot of special features and for the most part, a film that goes beyond the average \\"popcorn-flick\\" flair.<br /><br />Sure, Peter Jackson's name is attached to the film but in truth, you have to hand it to first time director Neill Blomkamp (and also screenwriter Terri Tatchell)  who adapted his short film and was expected to take that short film and make this monstrous sci-fi film with only $30 million dollars.  In contrast, to other 2009 films \\"G.I. Joe - Rise of Cobra\\" cost $170 million to make, \\"Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen\\" cost $200 million to make and here is a film that was shot by a first-time director, features no major stars, shot in a hazardous area, dialogue that was improvised and yes, they director and crew had to cut corners but what an amazing film \\"District 9' turned out to be for its low budget, considering how immense this project and film actually came to be.<br /><br />Actor Sharlto Copley (who plays Wikus Van De Merwe) who has never really acted in a major film was incredible and almost like an Ed Norton who got his first big break with \\"Primal Fear\\", \\"District 9' definitely puts Copley on the map and will be a talent to watch for more and more in the near future.<br /><br />Overall, \\"District 9' turned out to be a pretty smart and deep sci-fi film.  It definitely was not what I was expecting and that's good because it turned out to be much more fulfilling.  Is it a great film?  No.  But it's a pretty solid, thought-provoking sci-film that features a gripping screenplay, awesome special effects and also solid acting.  All from a director, crew (aside from producer Peter Jackson) and cast that we have never heard of.  An ambitious film that looks and feels like it should have cost a lot more to make but in the end, Blomkamp made it happen with a low budget.  The Blu-ray release of \\"District 9' actually enhanced my appreciation for this film  and in the end, I feel that this \\"District 9' is just too awesome of an HD  release on Blu-ray and definitely earns my recommendation!as I've seen, the changes are just menu driven - one featuring humans with a red color scheme with the other featuring aliens and blue color scheme.

B000FA5TTW|3.0|the best thing i can say for this book is that the proofreader did a good job. storywise, it was just alright. not horrible. definitely better written than twilight, but nothing special.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|In 2009, the documentary \\"It Might Get Loud\\" directed by David Guggenheim (\\"Gossip\\", \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\") made its way through the various film festivals.<br /><br />The documentary was created to highlight the electric guitar, so what best than to feature three iconic electric guitar musicians: Jimmy Page (The Yard Birds, Led Zeppelin), The Edge (\\"U2') and Jack White (White Stripes, The Raconteurs).  Each men with different musical backgrounds and from different countries and get to know how they became passionate for the electric guitar, learning of their musical inspirations, revisiting areas where they first became involved in their bands, footage of them performing live (with vintage footage) and their approach to music, what goes behind-the-scenes when they are writing songs and much more.<br /><br />The documentary captures these musicians up-close and personal but also what happens when you bring these three musicians together with their instruments and what kind of music they come up with together.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"It Might Get Loud\\" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:78:1).  The picture quality is fantastic.  The documentary was shot in HD and aside from the vintage footage and old photos, the modern footage was shot entirely in HD and the amount of detail is just wonderful.  You literally see the detail in some of the vintage instruments.  For example, in one scene, Jack White performs a song on the piano and you can see the rugged look of the old piano.  Especially later on as he performs on an older guitar.<br /><br />You do see quite a bit of grain on some of the stock footage and of course, older vintage footage is not exactly going to be the best looking on Blu-ray but for the most part, picture quality is quite solid for the modern sequences of this documentary.  Skin tones are natural, blacks are nice and deep.  Some modern scenes has its share of low light noise and I did notice certain scenes with occasional dust but for the most part, picture quality is solid!<br /><br />Audio quality is presented in English, Portuguese 5.1 DTS-HD MA and Spanish 5.1.  Lossless audio is fantastic!  From when you first hear Jack White messing around with a guitar, that the electric guitar comes out quite clear through the front channels.  But when you start hearing Jimmy Page and The Edge play and the followed by Jack White and the various bands, you can't help but be impressed about the clarity of the instruments.<br /><br />I can't tell you that by watching these guys play, especially when Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White just sat together and then started jamming, you can't help but get goose bumps.  Absolutely fantastic!  Especially the final improvisation scene with all three men just jamming.  Just brilliant!  There was no rehearsal, these three guys just start jamming in unison.  Awesome!<br /><br />Subtitles are in English, English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese and Arabic.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"It Might Get Loud\\" comes with the following special features featured in Standard and High Definition.  English Stereo and subtitles in Portuguese in Spanish and French.  Included are:<br /><br />  * Audio Commentary -- Audio commentary by Director Davis Guggenheim, Producer Lesley Chilcott and Producer Thomas Tull.  An informative commentary with good insight on what happened behind-the-scenes and what the filmmakers wanted to accomplish.<br />  * Toronto Film Festival Press Conference --(38:26) Q&A footage from the Toronto Film Festival Press Conference featuring Director Davis Guggenheim, Producer Thomas Tull and Lesley Chilcott and the three musicians: Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White.<br />  * Deleted Scenes--(26:06) Featuring the following eleven deleted scenes:  Jimmy Page plays Acoustic, Four Sticks on Acoustic, Kashmir, Strings, Theremin, Nicknames, The Edge plays \\"Stairway to Heaven\\", The Edge's Sound Check, I Fought Army's, Seven Nation Army, Deleted Animation.<br />  * Theatrical Trailer - (2:26) Original theatrical trailer for \\"It Might Get Loud\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />An incredible and amazing documentary.<br /><br />For anyone who enjoys rock n' roll especially these talented guitarists such as legend Jimmy Page, The Edge and Jack White will love this film.  I was pretty amazed about how enjoyable this documentary turned out to be.  Learning about their passion for the electric guitar, playing music, learning about their past and also footage of their bands (vintage footage of Led Zeppelin and U2) was pretty awesome.<br /><br />But what really made things much more enjoyable was watching \\"It Might Get Loud\\" on Blu-ray.  The film was shot in HD and the detail was just amazing.  From the old vintage instruments, you literally see the age on them and the various locations where the documentary were shot looks quite impressive.  The lossless audio was fantastic and to hear the three perform and hear the guitar so crystal clear and so well-defined through your home theater is quite amazing.<br /><br />This documentary goes beyond just enjoying the music and historic information from Page, The Edge and White, you also get to see other classic footage of artists and bands that these musicians enjoyed.  Seeing 1930's Blues artists to punk bands such as The Clash and the Ramones was pretty awesome.  But there are some deep thoughts from the musicians that you can't help but listen.  This is probably one of the most personal rock documentaries as we see the thought process behind the music, their first instruments, the challenges they faced earlier in their career or at a young age and more.<br /><br />I know there are some people who wish there was more music and less talk but personally, I was amazed by hearing their stories.  Yes, I enjoy listening to their music but to tell you the truth, aside from listening to their music, I never knew the personal side to these men.  Director Guggenheim let these men do their thing and I know some wish there was more prodding by the director but this was a different type of documentary that Guggenheim wanted to accomplish and so, it's less about ego's or personal clashes, it's all about the love of music.  So, I found this documentary to be quite fascinating and just highly entertaining.<br /><br />Also, the special features were just enjoyable to watch.  The fact that these three musicians allowed the filmmakers to get up close and capture the personal side of them was quite amazing and when all is done, the special features showcase some enjoyable scenes as Jimmy Page plays the guitar and The Edge and Jack White are just in awe by the legend.  You can tell that these musicians savored the moment, especially when the three start jamming with Jimmy Page while he plays \\"Kashmir\\".<br /><br />Overall, if you are a rock musician or a fan of any of these talents or the bands they are part of, \\"It Might Get Loud\\" is a magnificent documentary worth owning on Blu-ray.<br /><br />\\"It Might Get Loud\\" on Blu-ray definitely receives my highest recommendation!DGMENT CALL:    An incredible and amazing documentary.

B000O179EK|4.0|Learned the difference between HD DVD and DVD...  I know the it said HD-DVD when I went back and looked but not sure it was there when I bought.  If you know anyone who has an HD-DVD player I have a HD-DVD copy of the Big Lebowski cheap.    The seller and the transaction were flawless just cant use the dvd but that was my fault.
B002KDUDG6|1.0|Brings nothing new or interesting to overly recorded work.  Outclassed by any number of previous masters recording these songs.
B002MTTZ5I|5.0|I was in high school from 1983 to 1987, and I saw Ratt, Motley Crue, Cinderella, Autograph, Dokken, and many, many more hair metal bands perform in their prime, as well has having attended party after party where cassettes and CDs of those bands supplied the soundtrack. I can safely say that Steel Panther have completely nailed \\"it.\\" It's a parody so good that they could pass for the real thing, and it's extremely funny to boot.    There are nuances in the way they play the music in particular, that I think only a fan who was around during the original genre can appreciate. Steel Panther play like a band that has genuine love for hair metal culture, and that's why they're able to parody it so brilliantly.      I think that's where the line may be drawn between the love and hate reviews here. To the generation that only knows the original bands through YouTube and VH-1, that extra level of detail is perhaps unappreciated. I'm not talking about the over-the-top lyrics, but just the way the music \\"feels\\" when I listen to it. I was there, and Steel Panther have recreated it dead-on.
B0000YB7Z8|4.0|I remember my local library got this LP when I was 10, maybe 11 years old.  I think I wore it out, I checked it out so many times.  It made that much of an impact on me.  A really good live album.
B002NWRMVS|1.0|This is a complete waste of anything I can think of; time, money, CO2 - and most importantly; talent. Why did she hook up with people that cant play (or at least dont....), record songs that no-one would ever dream recording - well - beats me....
B00168OIOE|5.0|Loved this movie on DVD. Now love it even more in Blu-ray.  Great family movie.
B002JIOQCO|5.0|This is truely a great album. There are great guitar riffs, killer drums, cool keyboard, and Of course, good vocals. Wolfmother has done it again with there segual to there great first album. Grat Buy for this holliday season!
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Dave Lombardo kills his drum set and both guitarists shred like never before. The songs are varied in their structure but have the familiar Slayer sound. You have your slower darker tunes and your faster ones as well. \\"Beauty Through Order\\" reminds me of the song \\"Seasons in The abyss\\" \\"Unit 731\\" is reminiscent of \\"piece by Piece\\" off of the Reign in Blood album. So they all sound familiar but more musically proficient and more interesting than anything off of Christ Illusion. The gap between \\"God hates us all\\" and Christ Illusion was roughly 5-6 years. \\"world Painted Blood\\" has only had a 2-3 year gap so I think that the vibe is still flowing amongst the band so you get a better album. Plenty of squealing solos, harmonics and angry vocals. Buy this and you will be happy and maybe pleasantly surprised that they still have what it takes after all these years. I rank this album up with their older stuff. Yeah it's that good!
1423101472|5.0|Do you ever wish you had a normal life?  Do you want to be like everyone else in your school?  Have you ever had a life-changing decision?  The last Olympian is about all of these issues.  People can't have normal lives when they're saving the world.  The Last Olympian by Rick Riordan is an action-filled, pulse-thriller that will make you kick yourself if you don't turn the page.                 The Last Olympian takes place in New York City.  It is about Percy Jackson, who is a half-blood, which is a child who has a god and a human for parents.  For instance Poseidon, the god of the sea, is Percy's dad.  Percy is the child of the prophecy; a prophecy that states once he turns 16 certain death will come.  Well it's here, Percy's 16th birthday less than a month away and Kronos, the titan king, is on his way.  Percy and his half-blood friends must defend Olympus.  Percy is faced with his toughest challenge yet and must make a life-changing decision.   Percy Jackson's tale starts when he is 12 and ends when he is 16 so I would say the audience of The Last Olympian is mainly 12 - 16 year olds, people who believe in mythology.  Mythology is the main topic in this book.  The author does a good job of keeping the same audience because he stays on the main topic throughout the entire book.  The genre of The Last Olympian is mainly action/adventure, and is similar to the books I've read.   There are many things I liked in The Last Olympian; one is the descriptive picture Riordan tries to put in your head, like when he is explaining the final fight in excellent detail.  Another is the plot of the story, the plot makes the books a real page turner, because Rick includes mystery into this book as well as action.  The mystery makes you think something will happen, but then something else happens.  One weakness is the fact that there are no sequels.   In conclusion The Last Olympian is an amazing exciting book that really grabs the reader's attention, and you should definitely read it
B000ZECQ08|4.0|Being a Harry Potter fan of the first two movies then moving onto the books, I have to say I am a fan of the books first and the movies second. For those of you that haven't read the books though, the movies are still great if that's the only way for you to get your \\"Potter Geek On.\\"<br /><br />With that being said, book readers have to realize that there is no way to be 100% true to the books. The movie would be so expensive to do, plus they have to be able to have their \\"creative license\\" with it. They have to draw people who don't read the books into the theater. I am also one of those haters that get so mad when something was changed completely or not even in the movie, which IMO should have been.<br /><br />The first movie is still my favorite, the second one I felt was a bit boring, the third was done fairly well considering, the fourth kept me on a \\"high\\" almost the whole time but was very disappointing with how much they left out (hell-O... I was SO looking forward to the world cup in the beginning, it really set the stage for the rest of the book) I think they slaughtered this one, the fifth wasn't as true as it could have been but it was also one of the most boring books in the series IMO so it was bittersweet, the sixth is probably my second favorite honestly though it too lacked a lot of information that I feel was needed to go into the seventh book.<br /><br />We book nerds have to realize they can't do it 100% perfect and have take it with a grain of salt, but that doesn't mean we can't pause the movie and fill in the blanks or tell it how it should be!!
B000FC1RCI|5.0|This quite simply the best mystery I have ever and probably will ever read. And Then There Were None will pull you in and not let you go till the very end which i can gaurantee you will not see coming. I`m only thirteen and this is by far my favorite book and if I enjoyed it this young any one can too.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|Brian de Palma stormed my heart back in the mid-seventies when he released Phantom of the Paradise. That unforgettable film represented exactly the kind of feverish extravaganza that I wanted to see at that time of my life. Phantom was blatantly absurd, a movie that could be enjoyed only by moviegoers who accepted that it was intentionally unbelievable, a blatantly absurd, feverish and surreal dream made with passion and conviction.<br /><br />It is a long journey from the risky, outside mood of Phantom to this mainstream video with its blatant appeal to the American moviegoers craving for fare that offers unadulterated visions of money, violence and sex. Nevertheless, I always enjoy watching this movie.<br /><br />Perhaps Scarface can't be fully appreciated unless you have first seen Phantom of the Paradise. From the swirling camerawork in Al Pacino's crazed and brilliant opening scene through the Tarantino-topping violence of the final shootout, everything in this movie pushes us beyond the place where we can sit back in dispassionate comfort. The point here is that no decent person can sit through this movie without feeling uncomfortable. A naïve viewer might think this is simply an exceptionally wild violence and sexual ridden romp, but the point here is that every scene in this movie is calculated to take matters to extremes, to push beyond the boundaries of the real world.<br /><br />Tarantino and Oliver Stone get the credit for making movies that intentionally court a surreal degree of violence -- in Tarantino's case for the fun of it, and in Stone's case as a protest against the American obsession with destruction. Yet this movie shows that de Palma was there well before them. Like Natural Born Killers or the Kill Bill movies, the camera never sits still in this movie, and the violence is intentionally taken into an unreal realm of the imagination. Egregious consumption, egregious violence, and a disturbing sexual ambiance are captured by de Palma's careening camera and thrust in the viewer's face, making us squirm in our seats, unable to turn away from what simultaneously repulses and fascinates us.<br /><br />Personally, I don't think there is any need to make this movie again. De Palma got out in front of his audience and made a movie that was panned when it shipped, but which neither audiences nor critics have been able to ignore since. In many ways, Scarface makes both Natural Born Killers and the Kill Bill movies redundant, mere remakes of what de Palma laid down in the mid-eighties.<br /><br />The dark side of America is captured on the screen by this extravagant production that left me stunned when I first saw it, back when I was much younger and my blood ran much hotter than it does today. Al Pacino gives an exalted performance that is simultaneously absurd and brilliant. The same is true of de Palma, who dazzles us while eliciting gasps of laughter and shock while pushing us beyond our tolerance for any number of things. To say that this film is too violent, too sexual and too hard too believe is only to reiterate de Palma's purpose in making this production. Watch this movie when you have a craving for the extreme, when you want to analyze how a talented director performs sleight of hand effects, and when you want to see the movie that lay the groundwork for the careers of contemporary directors like Tarentino. Watch this movie when you want to contemplate the dark side of America, when you want to watch an actor go the distance and then travel half as far again just for the heck of it, and watch this movie if you are willing to let your demons out to dance. Just don't watch this movie if you want to take it literally as a Hollywood entertainment.<br /><br />This is a movie about bad people doing very bad and very destructive things. It is so egregious, that I'm sure it had the opposite effect that its critics suppose. Young people who saw this movie while growing up probably left the theatre or TV screen convinced that nothing is crazier than taking drugs and running around on your wife. But to ascribe a moral purpose to the movie is to undermine its fundamentally anarchic spirit. Go back to Phantom of the Paradise if you want to understand the movie. The point is that it takes conventional movie ideas and pushes them beyond the extreme and into the absurd.ugs and running around on your wife.

B002XTBE8I|4.0|I'm actually glad that the original Relapse was included due to the fact that my copy is completely worn out.    Ok, by now you have heard \\"Forever\\", so there are only six originals and two would have been in the top 3 or 4 if released with relapse.    \\"Hell Breaks Loose\\" and \\"Music Box\\" are both instant jams having the best beats and lyrics.  In my opinion, Music Box is already a Shady classic.  He murders the hell out of this song.  It reminds me of \\"Stay Wide Awake\\" which is the best song on Relapse.    'Elevator' is the 3rd best song with a catchy hook and clever lyrics (as usual).  The remaining tracks are all average to good songs, but have a distinct smell of relapse possibles that did not make the final cut.    ENJOY........ Also, these 6 songs were supposed to be on Relapse 2, and they are all similar to Relapse in sound and in Shady's voice.  He is saying that for Relapse 2 he is now starting from scratch and going in a completely different direction.  Be ready for another classic.  I have a feeling it is going to be his greatest effort thus far.
B002RSDW80|4.0|The movie was a lot of fun, especially Meryl Streep as Julia Child.  The story pretty much revolves around Julie Powell's blog, which gives everyone hope they can be noticed on the web, but the scenes that really standout are those of Julia in Paris, learning the fine art of cooking that would make her famous. Amy Adams was a bit too mousy for my taste, and one has to wonder after cooking all those dishes how she managed to keep her figure.  Stanley Tucci was excellent as Julia's husband.  One of my favorite movies was his [[ASIN:0767802535 Big Night]], which also revolved around food.  Chris Messina appears to have a knack at portraying sympathetic husbands and [[ASIN:B000E6EK42 boyfriends]]. The movie certainly makes you want to revisit [[ASIN:B0006VXMHG Julia Child]].  The movie was tasty enough, but somehow it lacked bite, as it Julie's rise to web noteriety hardly matched the time and energy Julia had spent getting her book,[[ASIN:0375413405 Mastering the Art of French Cooking]], into print.

B002M3GPOI|1.0|Wilson's 09 mix is unnecessary. Red and Lizard, on the other hand, are excellent.  The 04 ITCOTCK remaster was itself the greater accomplishment and revelation.  Also, on the 04, Moonchild is intact in running order with all its chill mysteriousness.  A 180g vinyl reissue of the 04 remaster would have been more appropriate as a 40th anniv marker.  Genesis did this beautifully and with meaning on their 70-75 remix box.  I do hope Fripp will get this done soon and for the full catalog incl the original Young Person's Guide.  Crimso LPs were masterpieces of design, perfect representations of what was inside.  Often their texture made them a wonder to hold and touch.  I went cold when I took hold of this box -- glossy and off-color, harsh outdated jewel cases, icky foam compartment insert, wimpy garish buttons.  The entire packaging of this new box is an embarrassment to Barry Godber, the musicians, and the fans.  Until I give this away or sell it, it is going in a cabinet to protect people from seeing it.  I love the mini-LP packages done on the 02-04 remasters.  They even faithfully reproduced the original paper stocks used on the originals. But for now I'm through buying ad nauseum Crimso repackages on CD.  Gimme vinyl, please please please!

1595822003|5.0|I bought Bernie Wrightson's trade paperback edition when Marvel published the title in 1983. I hesitated picking up Dark Horse's reprint until I chanced upon a copy at Border's. This is a gorgeous edition that every horror fan must have on their shelf. Dark Horse pulled out all the stops to make this an event publication. Cloth bound with slick pages. This book is a true work of art and an amazing bargain given Amazon's pricing. Worth every penny. This is the only edition of Mary Shelley's book you'll ever need. Bernie Wrightson's artwork is stunning and Dark Horse Books proves once again why they are the best in the business.
B000003N7K|5.0|A friend introduced me to this album and the story behind it.  I fell in love with it within the first few notes.    There is a great story that he shared with me.  You see, my friend went to hear Hartman in the early 80s at a club in Englewood, NJ, where the album was originally recorded.  Hartman himself gave him a copy on vinyl telling him, it was the album of which he was most proud.    As another reviewer said, it was Coltrane's idea.  Hartman wasn't so sure and went to meet Coltrane in NYC.  They talked, tried a few things and decided to do it.    It was literally on the way to the recording studio when they heard Nat King Cole's rendition of \\"Lush Life\\" playing on the car radio that Hartman said they should include it.  He didn't know all of the words, and they had to get them for him that day.  There is only one track that required a second take, and that was only because the drummer dropped a stick.  This album is pure musical alchemy that happens only when you bring the greats together, and even they become more than the sum of their parts.
0140306013|5.0|Some stories forever change the landscape of literature. They permeate through the varied genres of fiction, beyond age or demographics, and somehow manage to speak to everyone, to see the world in a little better light. Richard Adams wrote just such a work in \\"Watership Down.\\"    The story, now published in several editions and the subject of a fairly well done animated movie, follows a band of rabbits who strike out from the apparent safety of their warren into the unknown English countryside. Pricked by the intuition of his wan brother, Fiver, Hazel convinces a small group from the warren that the time has come to seek a new home, one where they can live free from danger and away from the restrictive regime of their chief rabbit and his officers. The way is fraught with danger from both the expected predators (mankind being the most potent, albeit oblivious), as well as some more surprising antagonists. They discover that life among rabbits in the outer world is far different from anything they have ever known. When, at last, they reach Fiver's promised destination, they are thrust into war with a tyrannical and expansive neighboring warren, led by a powerful warlord known as General Woundwort, the conclusion of which contains perhaps the finest epitaph for a battle scene ever penned in the English language.    Interwoven throughout the entire novel is warm prose, dynamic characters, beautiful depictions of the country (that obviously flow from a life spent in appreciation of nature), and, perhaps most interestingly, a richly imagined mysticism for rabbits which comes to guide some of the higher aspirations of the heroes. The impressive breadth of the novel makes this among one of the longer fantasies of its time. But it is worth reading every word.     Indeed, the world of reading is a far better place because of \\"Watership Down.\\"     -Matthew Lucas (author of \\"A Roar in the Pinelands\\")  [...]

B002KQ6BT6|2.0|While I loved Angles and Demons .. liked the DaVinci Code .. the Lost Symbol left me lost.  I was disapointed in the lack luster role given to Robert Langdon.  I agree with the idea of looking into ones self in order to find a greater connection with God ... but I felt the plot of the Lost Symbol never really got off the ground and for some reason Langdon just seemed to be playing stupid in this novel.  I will not recommend to anyone.
031606792X|1.0|Ok for one I think it is souch a waste of paper having so many pages filled with blah blah blah blah, that the very best part is in the last 2 or 3 chapters. This is by far one of the worst books I've read. It's soooo bad I wasn't even going to give it a star but I had to give it a one.
0143105426|5.0|Just finished my second time through on this beloved novel, but first time on the printed page with this cool cover that I won online! Just as fun as I remember. Darcy and Elizabeth are destined for one another, but they both have to overcome their pride and prejudices in order to see the reasons why they should be together and fall in love. I know there is a lot that I'm missing since I'm not an Austen expert on her subtleties and innuendos on society, but that's what makes it a timeless classic...it still speaks to everyone even without knowing everything that she was intimating in her social commentary. My husband even enjoys watching Pride and Prejudice with me! He's a sucker for the romance! So give it a try!
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I purchased this because it was such a great deal and I'd already purchased the season sets individually for a lot more than that, but they were taking up a shelf and half of my DVD cabinet!  This set is just a bit wider than the average individual season set of this show, and saves so much room!  As much as I love Dr. Quinn, I've been wishing they hadn't taken up so much space.  I feel like the packaging for this season is very secure, each season is held in its own plastic case, and each disc has its own plastic holder, so I'm not concerned about scratches.  This was my favorite show in the 1990s, and there really aren't any great quality family shows like this left any more.  So if you're seeking a show that offers drama, romance, a family friendly one, a great western, get this one, you won't be disappointed!
078513915X|5.0|This is a beautifully drawn rendition of the classic Pride and Prejudice! I won this online and was very excited! It's the same story, but in graphic novel form. There are some slight changes, but overall Nancy Butler keeps the same classic lines and I just can't get enough of the illustrations. I highly recommend it for all you Austen lovers!
B002H3F7F6|1.0|I listen to Sting everyday durring my long 2 hour drives to and from work and have been a huge fan since the Police and became an even larger fan when he went solo but this album and the last two Sacred Love and Songs from the Labyrinth held absolutely zero interest to me. The Songs from The Labyrinth album required one listen for my to conclude he either needed money (as it was pretty mainstream and poppy) or he was going through a bit of a midlife crisis. The Sacred Love album found me counting the days till it's release only to be scratching my head in disbelief wondering what the hell happened. Now onto this new album.........................with the lack of interest from two previous albums certainly my hero and favorite musician wouldn't let me down again but he did and he did in a big way. If on a winters night is as bad as the last. Do not buy this album if you're into the more jazzy stuff he's come out with.     Could it be that Stings sick of making jazz? If thats the case then he's lost a fan but for those of you just now getting in Sting please disregard the last three albums and get his early solo albums you will not be dissapointed in the least!
B0026P3G12|5.0|The voice says it all. Purity of intent. I would have bought this album just because Susan deserves it. I was not let down. Amazing voice, amazing story, amazing woman. I hope they just let her be herself. The juxtaposition of her real personality and the honesty and feeling in her music make this debut album a consciousness changing event for the whole world and everyone who ever had a dream.
B00007LTIG|5.0|In the fall of 1967, I was a college freshman (I know I'm dating myself, but, given it was also the autumn of my first heartbreak, I actually really did date myself!) I spent an inordinate amount of time listening to my meager record collection --- The Blues Project's Projections, J.A.'s Surrealistic Pillow, Moby Grape's intro album, Cream's Fresh Cream, The Amboy Dukes, and this album---Grateful Dead's freshman offering. While all of this wonderful music has a special place in my heart, I've come to be especially attached to The Grateful Dead. From the first Pigpenny organ trill of The Golden Road to the climax of Viola Lee Blues, this album was the one I could count on to always cheer me up. For the record (or C.D.), American Beauty is my favorite Dead studio album, this first one is a very close second. As another reviewer notes, the quality of the vocal performances (as with the Dead's live shows) leaves a great deal to be desired, I can't imagine any song being any different than it is. My favorites: Morning Dew (yes, I know they later slowed down the song's tempo, but I like the upbeat version just fine, The Golden Road, and Good Morning Little Schoolgirl). And, at Amazon's price---you can't<br />buy music this good at twice that anymore! My son has also taking a liking to the CD and Jerry Garcia's rolling guitar licks...
B001AQTWF2|3.0|Amidst all the marriage and drug problems that plagued Whitney Houston for much of the decade, there came a point where I said, \\"I never thought Bobby would look like the sane one.\\" And although I've always been a fan of Ms. Houston, I really didn't care for her last proper studio album, [[ASIN:B00006HCUW Just Whitney]]. But that album was released seven years ago, so now that Whitney has cleaned up her act, how will she fare with I Look to You?<br /><br />Well, this album has already gone platinum, so it's clear that she still has a devoted fan base. Now, it goes without saying that the album shouldn't be expected to duplicate her first three, but -- actually, here's the thing: it's not that all the songs on here are bad; it's just that none of them really have that classic Whitney Houston feel. In other words, this kind of sounds like ANYone could be singing these songs. This is especially proven by contributions that aren't all that surprising, like Akon (\\"I Got You\\", \\"Like I Never Left\\"), as well as songs penned by Diane Warren (\\"I Didn't Know My Own Strength\\") and R. Kelly (\\"Salute\\", the title track). And in each of those songs, the lyrics aren't exactly mind-blowing.<br /><br />Speaking of the title track, that song was the most disappointing to me not because it's bad, but it sounds just like the kind of song Whitney should be letting her vocals soar on, but instead she isn't giving it her all (her friend Mariah Carey is following that same example on [[ASIN:B002DSM8UC HER latest album]], but I digress). Although I Look to You isn't a bad album, it doesn't really jump out at you either. Basically, if you're not a big Whitney Houston fan (like most of these reviewers seem to be), B.I.F.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B0029LHW68|5.0|Every time I listen to any of their albums, I get away from the real world and enter a journey full of melodies and solid meanings. I'm tired of listening to bands that sound exactly the same and simple, with these guys I can rest assured with This Is War that they put their most and solemn effort to take people like me to that journey that Jared can lead with such amazing voice, and the tunes take me away. I would never waste a single track on this album, WHY? Cause it's such an amazing story, like a book or a movie, EPIC and SOLID but most of all REAL and PROVOCATIVE... 5 STARS from beginning to end.
B001AVCFK6|3.0|This was reasonably entertaining...but definitely not Star Trek...should have just made a new franchise rather than rehashing old characters...it's like changing Darren on Bewitched....just feels strange and fake.  The sequences of Kirk as a kid were not needed and the acting in those scenes was extremely amateur.  JJ Abrams should NEVER direct Star Trek...stick with Transformers because this was just Transformers with Star Trek character stand-ins.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|This movie is a Christmas gift and I never saw it.  I just heard that it's good.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|It's best not to compare the original theatrical release of Avatar in 3-D to an ordinary movie.  It's more like one of those rides at an amusement park, where you put on 3-D glasses and sit in a moving chair, or like an Imax event, where what you really want is not so much a story but an experience, to see something new, something you've never seen before.  Most of those films do not really have brilliant stories behind them, and the narration in Imax films is usually pretty preachy, but what you get from them is a few moments of immersion, an exciting new experience.<br /><br />So when I saw it from the dvd I was disappointed. My wife, who missed it in theaters, couldn't see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />The basic plot line of this one is [[ASIN:B00000F187 Dances with Wolves]] (or [[ASIN:B0007KTBIU Pocahontas]] or [[ASIN:B0001JXOVC The Last Samurai]]) in space, but each of those was, in its own way, a pretty powerful movie, in spite of everything that might be said about the bluntness of its message.  Avatar combines the emotional impact and message of those films - of a vibrant culture and way of life on the brink of destruction by armies with big guns, and of a lone person who discovers how terrible that loss will be - and combines that message with the astonishing richness of a whole new world, with alien characters who come vividly to life and breath with realistic performances, and with incredible visuals that never quite overwhelm the characters.<br /><br />Jake Sully is a paraplegic and former military special forces soldier, who is invited to take the place of his deceased twin brother on a mission to make contact on an alien planet.  The planet is Pandora, and it is inhospitable to human life, so to really get close a select few are linked to genetically engineered hybrid human-alien &#34;avatars&#34; that they control with their minds while their bodies lie dormant.  Best of all, linking with his brother's avatar gives Jake the experience of being whole again, of running and moving in ways he couldn't even have managed with his human body before the unmentioned crippling incident.  He ends up befriending the Na'avi natives, and (somehow) ends up being initiated into their tribal wisdom in the course of a few months (perhaps implausible, but it works in the story).  The only problem is, that was the deadline he faced for convincing the natives to leave their lands and make way for a major mining operation beneath their sacred tree.  Initially gung-ho for the mission, Jake begins to identify with the Na'avi, leaving him with the important question where his loyalties lie when the military-industrial mining corporation decides to give up on diplomacy and use force.<br /><br />Okay, so this is a James Cameron film, which means it wears its message on its sleeve, which means it will feature over the top and one-dimensional villains and gruff but lovable heroes, but which also means that it will show you something you've never quite seen before in film.  For those who go into this looking to poke holes in the script, there are holes to be found - as a story this is not quite on the level of the [[ASIN:B000GTLR2A The Lord of the Rings Trilogy]] trilogy.  Still it's quite clever and complex in its own way, and in spite of the novelty of its look, this is classic Hollywood style epic storytelling, with a central character whose personal quest comes to coincide with a cause much larger than him, with a romantic subplot whose successful outcome is tied to the fate of the world.  You can poke holes in most of the major classic Hollywood films too, if that's what rocks your boat, but if you are in the mood for a truly moving and immersive motion picture experience, best to let go of the inner critic and prepare to be overwhelmed and astonished.  I was enchanted, and couldn't take my eyes off of the screen, and didn't want it to be over when it was.  This is epic filmmaking, that has to be seen to be believed, and I strongly recommend that you see it in 3-d in theaters.  This is the first &#34;live action&#34; film where I've seen 3-d that didn't feel like a gimmick - but was completely in the service of creating an immersive theatrical experience.  Seeing it in theaters was amazing. The dvd experience is just another fantasy - not bad, but not astonishing.ongly recommend that you see it in 3-d in theaters.

B001AIRUOU|5.0|You can go through Halloween and/or X-mas without watching this precious jewel! Based on his short story, Tim Burton brought back the concept of stop-motion animation with this in a way Gumby never did.<br /><br />Jack Skellington is the Pumpkin King of Halloween Town, and he with his fellow bumpers of the night are in charge of Halloween every year, but totally unaware of any other holidays. After another successful trick-or-treat jamboree, Jack pines for something more to do with his life, and happens to stumble into a magic doorway that leads to Christmas Town, where Santa Claus runs X-mas. Jack falls in love with all things Christmasy, and decides to bring it back home. After doing some more research on it, he proclaims that he'll be the one running Christmas for that year. Everyone in Halloween Town gets on board with it, except for Sally, a Bride of Frankenstein-ish ragdoll girl who has a crush on Jack. Jack sends the trio of Lock, Shock, & Barrel to capture Santa so that he can replace him, but they take Santa to their boss, the slimey Oogie Boogie. Jack's attempt at being Santa totally backfires as he's shot down by the army. He realizes his mistake at trying to take over someone else's holiday, so he goes to get Santa back to save Christmas. Jack battles Oogie in his casino lair to free Santa, where its revealed that Oogie is really a pile of bugs. Santa manages to salvage Christmas for yet another year, and brings the holiday to Halloween Town. Jack then realizes his feelings for Sally, making for a happy ending.<br /><br />This is one of my absolute favorite animated films of all time. When it came out, I was getting out of animation for a while, but this totally brought me back into it. It also makes for a great refresher for the holiday season. As tough as it is to get through that time of year, watching Nightmare always makes it alot more tolerable, and from it you realize that if a skeleton from a horror-based society who knew nothing about Christmas could become a better person after finding it, then it shouldn't be too hard for all the real Scrooges out there either.better person after finding it, then it shouldn't be too hard for all the real Scrooges out there either.
0446619078|5.0|\\"The Last Coyote,\\" an early novel by American mystery author Michael Connelly, is the fourth of the writer's bestselling Harry Bosch detective series that now numbers fourteen published works.  That is, if you don't count in  [[ASIN:0446401196 The Brass Verdict]], a recent bestselling Mickey Haller-Harry Bosch novel. The series, Los Angeles-set police procedurals, looks at life on the \\"noir\\" side; Connelly is a former journalist, a crime beat writer for the Los Angeles Times, who certainly earned his spurs in murder while earning his daily bread. His recent standalones, [[ASIN:0316166308 The Scarecrow]], \\"Brass Verdict,\\" and [[ASIN:B002MAQSAM The Lincoln Lawyer]], have all been #1 New York Times Bestsellers. [[ASIN:B000JLXDW2 Crime Beat: A Decade of Covering Cops and Killers]], a non-fiction collection of his journalism, was also a New York Times bestseller, as most of his previous standalones have been, too.<br /><br />The novel at hand finds veteran detective Bosch suspended, after doing a bit too much acting out.  His house has been condemned after an earthquake; he's having trouble with a girlfriend.  So, to while away the time, he looks into a cold case, the October 28, 1961 murder of Marjorie Phillips Lowe, his mother.  In this regard, \\"The Last Coyote,\\" like the novel that followed it,  [[ASIN:0446198196 Trunk Music]], is unusually resonant, and emotionally powerful, as each centers around the most important relationship known to humans, mother and child.  The novel is further fueled by the great mileage the writer gets out of the last coyote metaphor, as Bosch searches, poignantly, for the killer of his mother, an LA whore. He introduces the animal early: \\"He saw a coyote step out of the brush of the arroyo to the left of the roadway and take a tentative look around the intersection. There were no other cars. Only Bosch saw this. The animal was thin and ragged, worn by the struggle to sustain itself in the urban hills. The mist rising from the arroyo caught the reflection of the street lights and cast the coyote in almost a dim blue light. And it seemed to study Bosch's car for a moment, its eyes catching the reflection of the stoplight and glowing. For just a moment Bosch believed that the coyote might be looking directly at him. Then the animal turned and moved back into the blue mist.\\"<br /><br /> Connelly is a wonderful writer, my favorite among American mystery authors, and I've read all his books save \\"Scarecrow.\\" (Like many other readers, I imagine, I prefer his series works to his standalones: like many other writers, his mysteries seem more powerful if they are filtered through the sensibilities of his detective protagonist.) At any rate, Connelly's plots drive like Mack trucks; furthermore, they are usually fresh, tight, riveting, complex. His narrative and descriptive writing is terse and witty, informed by his deep, accurate knowledge of police work, after several years on the cop shop beat.  His dialog snaps. He explicates his love of jazz as he goes. And his mise en scene writing: well, it's heartfelt, written by a man in love with a city, and it's so precise that a stranger could find his way around LA with a few of his books as guides. His books clearly follow in the footsteps of earlier outstanding hardboiled Los Angeles authors Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald, but add the further ingredients of a police procedural, as they chart the career of Connelly's creation, LAPD Detective Bosch, assigned to Hollywood Homicide.<br /><br />If you've come to Connelly's work through his later, better-known books, it's worth doubling back to this one.flection of the street lights and cast the coyote in almost a dim blue light.

Star Trek III a bit bright but otherwise Perfect    Star Trek IV Too Much DVNR again    Star Trek V the best this film has ever looked on DVD    Star Trek VI substandard old transfer from an old HD scan, edge enhancement artifacts and less than sharp image.    Special Features are nothing really.  The Captain's Summit is basically worthless Banter instead of Interesting stories and repetition of what stories these stars have told before.  Nice to see Shatner and Stewart, Nimoy and Frakes on the same stage. None of the special features from the 2 disc sets or special editions have been carried over, no trailers, or old commentaries either or making of and no deleted scenes.  Basically this is the movies only.  With that in mind i was ready to give the set five stars but subtracted 2 because of the wrong colors on wrath of Khan.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Wow!  The three disc Blu-ray package is definitely the way to go on this movie.  Although the movie itself was good, not great but good, the additional material, including the digital version, make this a great package.  The video quality itself was awesome and looked great on my 50\\" plasma set.  The audio was good and gave my surround system a decent workout.  Ever since I got a Blu-Ray player, I get big budget sci-fi on BD to get that true cinema experience.  I was not disappointed with this package.<br /><br />I thought the movie was a fine addition to the Trek universe, although I had problems with a lot of the logical inconsistencies and flaws.  Some you can chalk up to artistic license, others, well . . . not so much.  Beyond those little distractions I really enjoyed the movie.  I think I'll send J.J. Abrams a copy of the Star Trek Bible for Xmas :)<br /><br />Disc 1 contains the movie and the only thing I really would have wanted to see would have been an extended version that included the deleted scenes.  No such luck though.  Disc 2 has the Extra Features and its truly packed.  Interesting and engaging material throughout.  Disc 3 has the digital versions and getting it onto my computer and iPod was simple.<br /><br />All in all, I would recommend this package.
B002XTBE8I|3.0|Well, it's nice to see they released a \\"special\\" version of an album months after it came out AGAIN... These labels are REALLY getting annoying with this crap. I only heard the first Relapse, but didn't buy it. This one I bought cause I had a gift card, but I thought that My Darling and Be Careful What You Wish For would be on here... DISAPPOINTMENT. Those are the two best songs to come out of the recording sessions for this album. Other than that, yeah, the album is cool. It's not bad, and I admire the experimentation that Em and Dre went with (all artists need to experiment), but the album is still just decent. Eminem will probably never be as good as he was on his first three major releases, but hey...<br /><br />Beats provided by Dr. Dre are good for the most part. The lyricism and variety of flows and rhythmic rhyme patterns are all on point. Eminem can still rap his a$$ off. Subject matter is kind of tired though. \\"I'll kill you, I'm crazy, give me more drugs, blah blah blah vicodin, blah blah, Christopher Reeves, blah blah, incest, Chris Reeves AGAIN, blah blah blah...\\" The extra tracks are more of the same that was on the first disc and original version of the album. Not bad, but nothing spectacular. Well, except the Forever Remix, but that's totally out of place. Drake, Lil Wayne, Kanye West and then Eminem is just on the last verse? WHY put it on here?? Whatever. I guess if you didn't buy the first edition, but were kind of on the fence about buying it, this would be the better choice. At least you get more for your money. All I'm saying is that I hope Relapse 2 is a better effort because this was really a letdown. DON'T call THIS a comeback.

1439102813|5.0|Although fictional, this book paints a starkly accurate image of Alzheimer's Disease, seen from the inside. It describes Alice, a Harvard professor, with an early-onset form of the disease that gradually wipes out her mind, her memories, and even her ability to recognize her family. This fiction bases itself heavily on actual fact: neuroscientist Genova checked her story carefully with practitioners who treat and with patients who experience the disease. Alice sums up her descent into nothingness, late in the book, by saying, \\"I miss me,\\" a poignant way to express her feeling of losing herself to the disease. As a mercy to the reader, Genova ends her story while Alice is still able to talk and function, sparing us the disease's fatal endpoint.<br /><br />Alice's disease affects more than just herself, however. It takes its toll on her husband and adult children, the ones who tend the needs that she can no longer meet for herself. It limits them, too, when they face the choice between career goals and caring for her. It affects at least one of those children directly - the one doomed to the same fate by inheriting Alice's lethal gene. It could even have affected Alice's grandchildren the same way, except that advanced fertility medicine lets doctors determine whether a fertilized egg carries that fate within it. And, in some way, the disease even mocks the competent, self-assured Alice that existed before. Although she tried to spare herself and her family from a long, slow Alzheimer's death, the disease tricks her out of even that last attempt at dignity.<br /><br />I found this book painful to read for many reasons, not just the tragedy that affects Alice and so many millions of others. My own first exposure to Alzheimer's came at age five or so. My grandmother, coincidentally named Alice, didn't know who I was. At that age, I had no way to understand her loss; it only scared and baffled me. Like Alice, I have also taught at the college level. I make my living, even define myself to myself, in terms of my mind. Seeing that erode by inches seems unbearable. And, as I read the earliest signs of Alice's disease, the little slips and moments of forgetfulness don't seem so very different from the normal mistakes of a busy mind - the kind I experience all the time. I felt like someone reading a horror story, suddenly wary of the normal sounds and shadows of a house's normal nighttime.<br /><br />Hard though it was, I'm glad I read this. It attaches a human face to this terrible disease. And, for care-givers as much as for the disease's direct sufferers, it lets them know that they're not alone. Although each family will face challenges of its own in dealing with Alzheimer's losses, each caregiver has nearly ten million others standing beside her. That number will only grow as the population ages, as the disease affects more of our seniors (including some reading the book today), and as their families step up to the heartbreaking task of caring for those afflicted.<br /><br />-- wiredweirdto myself, in terms of my mind.

The rest are just fillers. For a plus, it's a conservative rooted band guaranteed to aggravate socialists!
B001TK3XO0|5.0|I've had a hard time separating this novel from reality. From time to time i start wondering how Laila is doing. It gives Afghanistan a face and a story.  It shocks you, in a good way, to how things so awful go unnoticed and ignored. It shows you how no matter what culture or religion you're from; you still have the same feelings and sufferings. I can't wait for the next novel by Hosseini.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Holiday Inn is a timeless movie with lots of singing and dancing to match the very fine acting; and the way they cleaned up this print is astounding! The quality of the image is every bit as good as others say it is. The plot moves along at a good pace without ever feeling rushed; and there's time for some interesting character development. The script was wonderful and the choreography couldn't have been better.<br /><br />When the action starts, we quickly meet Jim Hardy (Bing Crosby) and Ted Hanover (Fred Astaire); Jim is a crooner and Ted can dance with the best of them! Jim has plans to wed their mutual show business partner Lila Dixon (Virginia Dale), but unbeknownst to Jim, Lila has other plans--to marry Ted and work with him as his dance partner! Ted steals Lila away but not for too long--Lila sets her eyes on a millionaire and she herself is off to lead a whole new life.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Jim retires from show business and tends farm in Connecticut. He develops a romantic interest in show biz hopeful Linda Mason (Marjorie Reynolds) who has genuine talent; and it isn't long before Jim opens up his farm as a type of inn that is open only on the fifteen holidays of the year--hence, it's called Holiday Inn. People show up for good times dining and dancing at Jim's Holiday Inn.<br /><br />Of course, other developments along the way make the story a bit more complicated even though you know the plot is not too detailed so that the musical numbers can stand out as they deserve to in this film. Jim, Ted, Linda and others have lots to deal with before the film is over! In addition, look for a solid performance by Louise Beavers as Mamie, Jim's maid and cook. It's also important to note that this was the first time the song \\"White Christmas\\" was performed; and it was clearly an instant success.<br /><br />In addition, the bonus features on this DVD are excellent. I'm very impressed. I particularly enjoyed the bonus entitled \\"A Couple of Song & Dance Men;\\" and \\"All Singing - All Dancing\\" is quite good, too. There's even an optional audio commentary with Ken Barnes and snippets of additional audio clips of Fred Astaire and Bing Crosby commenting on aspects of the film.<br /><br />Overall, Holiday Inn is a classic movie with lots of fine acting and numerous musical numbers that boast very high quality control all for our entertainment. I highly recommend this film for fans of the actors in it; and anyone who enjoys classic movies and classic movie musicals will not be disappointed!e good, too.

B002MW50KO|5.0|This poor little Cd has been lambasted to pieces. Why? I love it!<br /><br />Gravel-voiced Bob Dylan tosses off a few Christmas favorites with some supporting vocals and a sweet countryish feel (certainly on WINTER WONDERLAND). Oh so perfect for the holidays and a gem to any collection.<br /><br />And yeah, he does sound like some old rummy on a street corner; That's half of the joy of it. If Dylan's a bum warming himself over a garbage can fire,then those must be redeeming angels playing and singing behind him here. Tom Waits and Dylan have too much phelgm in their throats to be anything but wasted greatness, but they also bring heart. Bless ya, Bob! Nice work worthy of purchase!

1401322336|2.0|I bought this book because of all the excellent Amazon reviews. A lot of people have commented on the nice pictures, which is true, the pictures are very pretty. I also like Jaime's cooking style and commentary because it makes the food seem like it's going to be good. But when you try to make the food, even following the directions to a tee, it never TASTES very good, which uh, is the reason why you bought the book, right? Even as an only semi-experienced amateur cook, even I know what wouldn't taste good in a dish, yet the recipes require it. I've tried cutting the weird ingredients in half, and it still tastes bad. I've now made 5 recipes, and none of them have turned out as good as something from Cook's Illustrated or even [...]. Don't waste your money...
0143038095|4.0|I read this book a long time ago while I was still studying in high school. At that time, I pushed this book away thinking that it did not apply to me, that the stories are just made up by a fellow Chinese girl.<br /><br />When I moved more than 9000 miles across the world to marry my husband, I picked up this book again, probably because I felt nostalgic. It finally sunk in that I had left everything behind, my parents, my brother, my extended family, friends, job, et cetera. It was very difficult, especially for a young Chinese girl. Being so far away from a close-knit family was horrendous, especially in a country where everyone spoke differently, and I found myself clawing at my cultural roots in desperation.<br /><br />While re-reading the book, and keeping an open mind about the stories, I found that I saw a lot of myself, and a lot of my mother in the pages. One of the stories in particular, was the \\"piano player\\" story. I remember resenting my mother for \\"forcing\\" me to play the piano, or learn ballet, or do things I really didn't want to do (which was climb into a storm drain to catch fish, in an all-white school uniform). I remember rebelling against her, similar to how the daughter in the story did against her mother.<br /><br />It touched me on a personal level, and has helped me understand more about how my mother would react to certain things in my girlhood than I could as a high school girl, full of teenage angst.<br /><br />I've seen that some people think that the women in the book are monotone, that all the older women have the same \\"voice\\" and that all the girls are characterless, but I believe it's because readers like that do not understand the intricacies and certain obligations that come with being Chinese, because of your heritage. It is not just a simple matter of colour of skin; it goes so much more deeper than that, and only a Chinese girl who was brought up in a traditional Chinese family would truly understand what it means to be Chinese, as much as Amy Tan tries to describe it to us.<br /><br />Kudos to her for writing this book; it has certainly changed my life, and my outlook.scribe it to us.

0470477237|5.0|If you want to understand how social media can generate you more business, then Socialnomics by Erik Qualman is an absolute must read! The basis of the book is that the previous best form of advertising ever known \\"word of mouth\\" has now become \\"world of mouth\\" based on the way that the internet has connected the world. The emergence of social media within the internet world has accelerated this trend to unprecedented levels.<br /><br />In the old days large corporations and traditional media would try to control their message,whereas now regardless of your message (good or bad) the power of social media spreads that message freely.  Hence, smart companies will ensure that they generate the value in the market place. Companies looking to market in this new medium must be responsive to their customers or they risk losing market share.<br /><br />The internet and social media have transformed the marketing landscape because people now have a voice and they are free to express their opinions globally. Social media platforms like Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, YouTube and more, are revolutionizing how we interact with our friends.  The author \\"Erik Qualman\\" does an excellent job of highlighting the challenges and opportunities that various industries have had in adapting to this new social media environment.  The book shows the radically different approaches that companies have had as it relates to social media. This includes the varied views of the travel industry verses the music industry to include mainstream media.<br /><br />The good news for companies that understand this new medium is that the cost of submitting your message has gone down to nothing.  In most cases, you can market for free and the internet gives you leverage that traditional media just doesn't have.  The opportunity in this new social media world is that companies can devise methods by which to generate interest about their products. If this is done correctly your audience will even help you to market your brand, almost like the Tom Sawyer principle.<br /><br />Socialnomics is an excellent resource for those who are desirous of learning how they might capitalize on the power of social media.  If you need to understand the relevance of social media in marketing, this book puts everything into perspective!like the Tom Sawyer principle.

B001MW0J2O|2.0|I recently read a Harvard Business Review experiment where they took a random group of people and asked them to rate a song.  Then a second group were brought in and they could see how the other groups rated a song.  The results were the higher rated songs were also the ones the first group rated high.  Then the experiment added another test group and the people conducting the test switched the top songs to the bottom, switched the bottom songs to the top with the highest review scores and brought in another group for the experiment.  Guess what happened?  The final group also ranked the songs that were moved from the bottom to the top highest.  What's the point?  Animal Collective.  Pitchfork readers are like sheep.  Indie kids all think they are subversive and different but in reality are just sheep who follow in packs.  This album is so overrated.  We already had the Shins, Depeche Mode, New Order and finally thank god, The Flaming Lips - All in most of these kids' lifetime.  If you are young enough to have missed the first round of all this, it's understandable how this might seem fresh.  And for god sakes how many cheap Pet Sounds attempts do we need? Van Dyke Parks Song Cycle anyone?  Oh so original for the 100th attempt.  There are countless other groups making trite synth music awash in reverb with noises interspersed and layers upon layers of background voices.  The words are so weak.  There is nothing new or unique here.  It's truly sad that we are in an age where a Pitchfork reviews can make or break an album amongst the herd (and not those who have \\"heard\\").  Want a real music magazine?  Try The Big Takeover where writers and readers are passionate about music and prefer to actually listen to the music more than they spend time in a thesauruses trying to literate cute reviews.  Please people, use your own ears for christ's sake.  I would love an experiment where you put 50 hipsters in a room alone and gave them all the same album without any outside influence and have them rank it and write what they thought of it and then the resultant score would culminate into an actual review.  One I bet most hipsters would not undertake such an experiment without their friends in put and their beloved influential music blogs.    No why two stars?  Longevity of the band.  An attempt at being something different.  The band has put in their time.  The music does have some really nice parts.  Arrangements that at times do come together to evoke a mood.  \\"Bluish\\" does have a mood about it that escapes the rest of the album.  There are some moods approached.  But the pain of hearing another attempt at Holland or Pet Sounds just hurts.  This album doesn't touch the depth of an album like The Soft Bulletin.  Although I can see how it might be a good summer make out album.  There are enough major chord tricks to make your messenger bag toting tight jean wearing sheep kids think this album really might be as good as all the boring indie sites make it out to be.

Not for the music purest or audiophile, but this will sound better in your car or at a party. A great set especially for the price.
1878424319|4.0|In this book Don Miguel Ruiz proposed that since we were young we made \\"agreements\\" with ourselves. We agreed with information told to us by adults. One example in the book was of a child that was told that she had a bad voice. She then grew up to believe it and did not dare to sing. This is how we are, using his word, domesticated.      Now, we can change our domestication with new agreements that are more freeing. They are: (1) be impeccable with your word; (2) don't take anything personally; (3) don't make assumption; (4) always do your best.     Personally, I found the first agreement - be impeccable with your word - as the most interesting one to me. The other three agreements somewhat feel like a repeat of a common wisdom. I think if one has read many personal development books, they have seen all of these. Secondly, though I love the way he wrote that made me felt like I'm learning a mystical knowledge, I did not find this book as giving me practical guide as the title indicated.     Overall, I gave four stars to this book because though lack of depth, this is a beautiful book with beautiful prose.

Yes, the story line is in places predicable....synthetic boy meets alien girl, boy loves girl, boy loses girl, evil corporate geek threatens the world....that does not lessen the overall sense of wonder.It is a movie we have already planned on seeing again, this time at an imax theater...tickets were sold out so we settled for just 3d.  The audience was so spell bound no one left their seat or talked during the film, and everyone applauded at the end.  I haven't been in a theater that quiet for 20 years.  You don't have to like science fiction to b awed by the colors, imagination used in the creatures and scenery.  It is amazing.

0061807400|4.0|What a great read. If Shutter Island is any indication of Lehane's talent as a novelist, I intend to check out every one of his other books. He tells what appears to be a rather straightforward story of two US Marshals investigating the escape of a patient/inmate at a prison for the criminally insane. As the story progresses, the \\"facts\\" in the case don't seem to add up, and it slowly becomes apparent that nothing and no one on Shutter Island can be trusted. Lehane piles on the plot twists and the psychological complexity with such skill that you hardly even realize what he's up to until it smacks you right in the face. This is a clever, engrossing, and creepy page-turner that moves along swiftly--the literary equivalent of a harrowing and breathtaking rollercoaster ride. I have high hopes for the film version, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and directed by Martin Scorsese. The trailer looks terrific, but the film's opening date was pushed back from October 2009 to February 2010. I'm hoping that doesn't mean major problems with the film...
0385486804|5.0|Being a usually a \\"judgemental\\" personality, I thought I would end up hating Chris for being some dumb, reckless kid.  Instead, the thoughtful portrayal of this sad, hungry soul realy touched my heart and changed my mind.  While I felt he was unprepared for what lay ahead, you can't be anything but a little jealous of the freedom and carlessness of spirit he possessed to venture into the unknown, not just the wild territory of Alaska, but to the wild uncertainties of America itself.  Relying on total strangers at times for lifes essentials, he never lost focus of his ultimate goal-reaching Alaska.  Some of us are afraid to move to another city and start life anew, he went wherever the wind, and his feet carried him.       I feel that he set out with the truest of intentions, and fell short.  I also feel that he was just starting to realize that Happiness is in its truest form when shared with someone.  He didn't live long enough to come full circle with this thought and act on it, namely travel back to his family and make ammends.  He never reached the point where he could tell his Father \\"I know I've been a pain in the a**, and I'm sorry.  I need you guys.\\", but I like to think he would have.        Overall, this is a good read, and I was suprised at my emotion for him at the books end.  It wasn't pity, and it wasn't anger, it was more like a subtle awe at his inner strength and determination to tame something within himself.
B000UBMWG4|1.0|I purchased this Blu-Ray set on 10 December 2009 and this set still contains the wrong disc.  Instead of the correct disc 1: \\"the final cut\\" it contains a duplicate copy of disc 5: \\"the workprint\\" instead.  Keep in mind this disc 1 is still labeled \\"the final cut\\" despite its contents.  I would have assumed that after all this time Warner Brothers would have fixed it, but they haven't.  Amazon needs to get with it as well and at the very least include a note and the number to call with every shipment of this set.<br /><br />Fortunately, the \\"most helpful\\" one-star review here at Amazon contained the 800 number for the Warner Brothers hotline to replace the disc (1-800-553-6937), and after 2 minutes and 31 seconds on the phone, Warner Brothers is going to ship me a replacement (correct) \\"final cut\\" in about 2 weeks.

0385504225|2.0|If you thought this book, a cornocopia of interesting Washington/Masonic facts and  metaphysical philosophical concepts, would keep you hooked even if the writing was sub-par...how wrong you would be.  It quickly becomes apparent Brown sent a team of interns to go Washington and then crammed their research into a book, regardless of whether it added to plot of the story.  Did we need to know every street sign in DC? Did he have to try so hard to appear like he understands how simple technology (like google search engines!) works? I think not. This disappointed reader wonders whether Brown is going to keep pumping out books for the money, or, like his earlier books, will actually take the time to publish something of value.
B000056NX5|5.0|I am such a big fan of the 1973 version of Jesus Christ Superstar [[ASIN:B00028HBIO Jesus Christ Superstar (Special Edition)]]that I was afraid to even watch this one. I have watched the 73 version a minimum of 100 times. I'm not a religious person, but rather a fan of the modern musicals.     Well, as I'm typing this review I am about half way through this version. I must say can not compare the two. Not only are the sets and the period it is set in different but the actors have totally reinvented the film. Every word and note is the same in both versions they are two completely different films. The actors but a whole new emphasis on the way you feel.     Glen Carter IS NOT Ted Neely and I am glad for it. I can honestly say that liking one version will not take away from the other. In all the remakes of films I have seen over the years I am immensely impressed at these two films.  Now my biggest problem will be which one will I watch when I feel the mood to see this tale again next time.     One point of comparison though if I may....  1) the vocal performance of Ted Neely in Gethsemane cannot be matched but Glen Carter does a close job of it.    In the 73 version there was a controversy by casting a black man as Judas but now as it really was then race was not part of the casting but rather the talent was.    Well, after YEARS of putting off watching this film I am glad I finally did.

B000F8O35U|5.0|There is a feature within this DVD that allows you to see a short done by Disney. As an aspiring artist myself I can tell you that this Animated short is one of the purest things Disney or any other animation studio has ever done.    This one short alone is worth 2x the amount of the dvd-set.      P.s. Long live Ariel.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|While not the first good adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma, this will probably become my favorite version. I thought all the characters were particularly well-cast, the lines were great (since they took them from the book :^)), and the sets and filming were beautiful. I appreciated that they decided to film Emma as a mini-series rather than a movie, since it allowed them to expand on the different characters' storylines rather than giving them a passing nod like the previous 2 adaptations have. A true cameraderie comes through between Emma and Mr. Knightley, making their eventual getting-together entirely believable (though I wish they'd come up with a different line for Emma to say at that point). Also enjoyable was the developing of John Knightley and Isabella, Emma's sister--nice to see Emma in the context of her family, rather than just her dad. Mr. Elton was played by the man who played Edmund in BBC's recent \\"Mansfield Park.\\" I liked him as Edmund, but I loathed him as Mr. Elton--which is good! He's so smarmy and full of himself here! I could ramble on and on about how enjoyable this was, but will spare you that and simply say, watch this series! It's great! :^)
0307346617|4.0|Max Brooks goes back to the topic of zombies. This time to present a fictionalized account from survivors and those involved with the Zombie War aka World War Z. After the outbreak in China begins, it quickly grows out of control and spreads around the world this time, reaking of death. The story is not coverage of the war itself but rather the aftermath and reflections of personalities that came out of the WWZ. Brooks gained success with his [[ASIN:1400049628 The Zombie Survival Guide]] and went forth with a novel that reflectively implimented some of that advice. I can see a feasible sequel/prequel coming about the war itself while it is occurring. Some people may not like this story as it is about the aftermath. If you're into graphic novels, check out Brooks' [[ASIN:030740577X The Zombie Survival Guide: Recorded Attacks]].
B002SJIO4A|5.0|I just finished watching the dvd today, the date of it's release and it is on of the new films that lived up to the hype. It is definitely one of the best films this year and also one of the best in the sci fi category. To be honest, I did not think I was going to like it at first. The first part is shot in documentary style and pretty violent. But once it settles down and focuses on the main characters it when it really kicks into gear. T The special effects are good. But unlike so many films with good special effects, it is a human/alien interest story as well with well written characters too. The alien boy's relationship with his father was my favorite and something that we all can relate too in one way or the other.  I can not remember the last time I felt so good at the end of a movie, knowing I had seen something so entertaining. Highly recommended and definitely a must see.
0553381687|5.0|First published in 1996, A Game of Thrones, the first volume in A Song of Ice and Fire, has become one of the defining works of the fantasy genre, arguably the most defining work in the epic subgenre since The Lord of the Rings was published forty years earlier. Almost every epic fantasy written in the last decade has been written in its shadow, many newer authors cite it as a major influence and it has become a key touchstone of the genre.<br /><br />It has been ten years since I first read the book and six since my last reread, and I must admit to some concern that the book wouldn't perhaps stand up as well on this latest read-through. Would five years of seeing people arguing about Jon Snow's parentage on the Westeros.org message board leave me apathetic when reading the story again? Fortunately, it did not.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is well-named for it is constructed as a game with different factions and different sides, with the first book introducing us to two of those sides (the Starks and Lannisters). The meticulous construction of the plot, the intertwining of different conspiracies and schemes and the successful depiction of the 'intoxicatingly complex' politics of the realm (to quote another review) - with the reader invited to decide who is in the wrong and who is in the right - are several reasons for the book's success, but the main reason is the characters. Eddard Stark, proud and honourable and too honest for his own good; his wife Catelyn, steadfast, clever and intelligent but blinded by anger over her husband's bastard son; the Imp, Tyrion Lannister, blessed by birth into a great house but cursed with deformities and a raging anger against his distant father; Daenerys, a young girl whose life and destiny are in the hands of her ambitious brother and her new husband and who must learn what it means to be a Targaryen; and Jon Snow, a young man who must find his own place in the world when it becomes clear he cannot share in the honours of his father's house. Together with a veritable galaxy of strong supporting characters - King Robert, Littlefinger, Varys, Lord Renly, Roose Bolton and more - they define this story and this world.<br /><br />Prior to A Game of Thrones, with a few memorable exceptions, epic fantasy seemed to be defined by events and places and battles and the furniture of the setting, the writers often forgetting the lesson of Tolkien that these things are secondary and of no importance without protagonists to become invested in. This novel brought the characters back to the front and centre of the genre. Understanding the characters, who they are and what they want and what they are prepared to do to get it, is key to understanding the world of Westeros, its political landscape and the wider conflict that develops. The characters are treated as real people with all the flaws and problems that come with them, confounding some readers used to novels which never move beyond first impressions. For example, Catelyn Stark is an intelligent, strong and politically savvy figure, a reliable support to her husband and sons, but because the first time we meet her she lays into Jon Snow with some venom and hatred, these other qualities are sometimes overlooked.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones is also a fundamentally adult book. This is a harsh, cold and unsympathetic world where life is cheap, promises count for little, honour and chivalry only exist on the tourney field and sons and daughters are bought and sold in marriages solely to enhance the power and prestige of their houses. Based on the historical truths of the Wars of the Roses, the Hundred Years War and the surrounding medieval period, Martin doesn't skimp on the violence or sex, although it isn't really gratuitous either. Tyrion learns some important truths about himself on the battlefield, whilst Daenerys discovers how to use her sexuality to exercise her own power and influence over her new husband. And, something that some later epic fantasy writers seem to have forgotten to include, there are also plenty of rays of sunlight in the gloom to show us that for all its faults, Westeros and its people are indeed worthy of salvation.<br /><br />The book is certainly not without flaws. The rotating-POV structure can lead to frustration, as you are just settling into one character's storyline and are then wrenched halfway across the continent to another character and by the time you get back to the first one it's moved on by several weeks or months. The worldbuilding, although highly intriguing, also feels a little sketchy at this point (something Martin addresses in spades in the sequels and prequel novellas), although individual locations like the Red Keep, Winterfell and the Wall come to life quite nicely and there is a sense of a vast history lying behind events and locations. The book also feels like it moves a little too quickly at times, with sometimes weeks passing between chapters, armies covering hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye and so forth. On one level this is a good thing: if A Game of Thrones was told in the same level of detail as say A Storm of Swords or A Feast for Crows, it would be considerably longer. On another, some of the more subtle nuances of character and plot from the later volumes are skimmed over here, whilst the series' central theme of power is more hinted at than fully indulged (which has to wait until more factions and more players enter the game).<br /><br />These complaints are pretty minimal, however. A Game of Thrones (*****) is a seminal and important work of modern epic fantasy, arguably unmatched since its publication as the opening volume of a fantasy sequence (although Bakker's The Darkness That Comes Before has come close).to include, there are also plenty of rays of sunlight in the gloom to show us that for all its faults, Westeros and its people are indeed worthy of salvation.

0618680004|5.0|This book has changed my life. I will never see things exactly the same way again. And for this, I am extremely grateful. I was indoctrinated with Catholicism for the first 18 years of my life. I was always a skeptic but even as such, the thought of living life without believing in God was so paradigm-shattering that I couldn't push through to fully abandoning belief. Until now.    Dawkins has presented an articulate, well-researched, and highly illuminating study of the detrimental effect of believing in the supernatural has on our species. There is nothing to gain from religion and certainly much more to be lost. If we wish to advance as a species, we must abandon belief systems that require us to ignore truths as they present themselves to us.    Once you truly accept that there isn't some mystical and supernatural afterlife - that life is finite, one truly gains an appreciation for the days we have here on Earth. Millions worry about appeasing a nonexistent an eye in the sky throughout their lives so that they can gain entry to 'heaven' all the while tragically not realizing they are already here. This is it. Make the most of it.    Thank you, Richard Dawkins, for having the courage to speak the truth.
B000002MJC|5.0|Songs Of Faith And Devotion (in and towards the female sexuality) is my overall favorite album of Depeche Mode. Perhaps it contains not quite as many beautiful melodies as Music For The Masses but the music of Songs includes more layers of sound and its complex beauty ends up growing on me more. The progression of sound of Depeche Mode from let's say A Broken Frame (1982) all the way through their latest 2009 album is an art installation in itself. From the raw and simple synthesizer driven melodies to deafening elaborate textures of noise, we have had the taste of everything in between.<br /><br />The songs of Depeche Mode have dealt with the captivity of male spirit by its own desire for female nature for a very long time. That seems to be Martin's overall obsession lyric wise (although their latest album seems to be less dominated by the topic) most likely because the situation affects his personal life quite a bit (and Dave's as well). Martin Gore has dealt with his own conscience on many levels, and has helped many others to face the issue by the power of his songs. Again, most often his exposure reflects upon the areas of body love. His attitude towards the unknown was revealed in a very special way back in 1984 on Blasphemous Rumors, a truly beautiful song. Aside from that single incident the concept of Higher Power according to the lyrics of Depeche Mode had a lot to do with the desire for female warmth and gentleness. Then, in 1997 something else has happened. Martin Gore wrote a song called Insight in which we heard: 'wisdom of ages rush over me heighten my senses, enlighten me lead me on eternally' Only Martin Gore could confirm or reject my sense of his (or perhaps Dave Gahan's, because of the timing of his overdose accident) personal history, but my feeling is that the experience he is fully revealing to us 4 years following Insight on Shine and reconfirming 4 years after that on Suffer Well could have either been the answer to his cry for help carried by the spirit of Insight, or perhaps the spirit of that song is carrying the beginning of Martin's revelation. Search and you will find. Ask and it will be given to you. The laws of our spiritual world and its wisdom of ages are quite different from the ones we usually rely on. Being exposed to one single difference changes your life eternally. We may need some sign from the invisible world, not necessarily on the scale of the experience Martin shares with us. Once we understand our true reality the state of enlightenment is within our reach. My favorite songs by Depeche Mode are the following: When The Body Speaks, Somebody, Judas, Waiting For The Night, Precious, It Doesn't Matter two, Sister Of The Night, Walking In My Shoes, The Things You Said, Useless, Blasphemous Rumours, Sometimes, Shine, Insight, Freestate, Never Let Me Down Again.spirit of Insight, or perhaps the spirit of that song is carrying the beginning of Martin's revelation.

B001AVCFK6|5.0|STAR TREK Blu-Ray Movie 2009 was GREAT !  LOVED it when we saw it in the movie theatre.  Had to buy in on Blu-Ray as soon as it came out.

0385504225|2.0|I'm a big Brown fan. I can't put his books down until I've devoured  them...until this one. It was a bad sign when I couldn't read more than 10  chapters in one sitting w/o getting disgruntled, disturbed or plain bored. The  premise is the Freemasonry history and its connection to DC which should've  hooked me in. And although I learned a lot, it seemed like I had a long way to  go to learn what I did. The last 3 chapters, after the BIG REVEAL, was nothing  but Dan Brown realizing he still had research material that he hadn't used so he  had his characters just spouting of exposition after exposition. Painful.    As for the mystery. We learn that the Mason's have been protecting the Ancient  Mysteries which have been handed down from Ancient Egypt. All religions have  guarded the Ancient Mysteries. The Masons don't have a faith and they have  members from all religions. So it is made clear repeatedly that the Masons are  not a Christian Order. But they've constructed this pyramid that has the key to  finding the Ancient Mysteries to a great power source. The worthy who can  unlock the code of the pyramid and its capstone will have the power of a god.    Enter the most \\"awesome\\" of all Brown villains. He's bald and secretly tattooed  and has joined the Masons to get access to the highest branches to find the  secret. He doesn't get it so he kidnaps the High Master and throws Langdon into  the fray to help solve the mystery or else his friend dies. So there are codes  within codes, symbols within symbols, and at the end    S    P    O    I    L    E    R    S    you realize the villain is the High Master's long-dead son who was offered the  answer to the Ancient Mysteries and turned it down. He's so altered now by  steroids, drugs, tattoos and dark Arts that even his father and aunt never  recognize him. Okay...so a great deal of irony there. And I guessed his identity the minute he refused to give his name.  Now for the Ancient  Mysteries. What were the Mason's hiding in D.C.? What is the power source?  What will make the worthy have the power of a god?  Wait for it....it's the Bible. Yup, the Freemasons apparently have been guarding this pyramid since the age of Ra to protect what is buried in a land that had yet to be discovered, in a city that had yet to be planned, at the base of building that had yet to be built, hiding a book that had yet to be drafted while all the while proclaiming that Freemasonry is not a Christian Order. It.Made.No.Sense. The Lost Symbol should be re-titled as The Lost Reader.
B001FB4VXU|2.0|I like this show, I think it's funny. I know I'm gonna be crucified for saying this, but here we go: The two-stars rating is due to one of the most obnoxious, unreleting, unforgiving laugh track I ever saw in a sitcom. It's simple unbearable, it borders on aggressive. The guy says \\"Hello\\", and there comes the laugh track, loud and and right through your head, like a hammer. Heck, the show is funny, I don't know why the producers think they should use the laugh track this way. I repeat: it's one of the worst laugh tracks ever in a sitcom.
B0029358GM|5.0|I was a big fan of Wilco during the Summer Teeth era. I soured on them after that. But this album is light, sweet and uplifting. I like almost all of the songs, no pretentiousness here, just honest song making.

0743277708|5.0|This book is for people who like adventure stories. I first read it in high school and I still read it from time to time. You will fall in love with the characters. You will be transported into another world, a world filled with danger, myths and legends, a bit of humor, and excitement. If you loved books like \\"The Hobbit\\" and \\"A Wrinkle In Time\\", you will love this book too.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Up! is a profound movie.  Yes, it's animated and geared towards young children.  But the themes of disappointment, tragedy, loss and unfulfilled dreams resonate with adults.  Children will be amused by the clever humor and interaction between people, dogs and exotic birds.      The little boy, Russell, is a super cute character, a plump, cheerful innocent who aches for adult approval, especially since his bum father split from his Mom for some lady named \\"Phyliss\\".  His Wilderness Explorer motif is perfect.  I love that huge, ultra prepared backpack!  And Russell's Asian ethnicity reflects our diverse nation.    A strong anti-corporate theme runs through the film as faceless, black eyeglass wearing, dark suited zombies manipulate widower Carl Frederickson out of his home to allow hi rise development.    The animation is superbly rendered and colored but not synthetic or artificially perfect.    You will \\"feel\\" during this movie.      This is a great film that an entire family will enjoy.  The 3D theater release was superb but home theater technology is nowhere near big screen 3D yet.  Hence, no 3D version.    This movies does not need SFX to stand on its own merits.  Up! will lift your spirits.  \\"Adventure is out there!\\"

Julia and her cohorts are honest about how much trouble (or not) each recipe is and they give great technique tips, not just recipes.<br /><br />In short, don't be seduced by other cookbooks with food \\"money shots\\", you know, the gorgeous full-page color images meant to arouse your appetite. So often those glossy pics are making up for mediocre recipes. Go for these: time-tested recipes and techniques as well as great background information and down-to-earth culinary advice.
0385504225|2.0|No big plot spoiler here for those of you who haven't read it (why do people DO that here in Amazon reviews???) so you can read on and not miss any thrills. I'm going to reference a couple specifics which give you the tone of the whole book - the reader is expected to go along with any of Dan's plot devices, no matter how amazingly absurd.     The Unecessarily Pitch-Dark Pod 5: Early on we here the the gigantic outer area leading to the research room can't be lit because an electric power grid would disturb their delicate experiments. However there's plenty of power in the room where said experiments go on, thanks to a hydrogen power cell. I assume this power is used in bulbs of some sort, as well as powering lots of equipment. Power gird. And why can't a hydrogen cell be used to create low lighting out in the pod, unless Dan is setting us up for a dramatic chase-through-the-dark scene?    So having survived the chase through The Unecessarily Pitch-Dark Pod 5, Catherine gets to her car. Now we know she's lost her coat because she has no door key-card so, um, how's she gonna drive?...   \\"Her keys were where she always left them, in the center console\\"  WHAT???????  Yep, she's part of a zillion dollar research project so this is a $50K+ car and she leaves it UNLOCKED with the KEYS IN IT.  Nice little escape device, Dan - I mean your escape, not hers.    Two small examples of the absurdities in this very weak followup to Da Vinci. Enter at your own risk, it's mildly entertaining so long as you don't mind sloppy pop fiction.

B000002I2M|5.0|The Doors had some great songs and some good albums leading up to LA Women, but nothing that could ever be called a complete masterpiece album, or one of the greatest rock and roll albums ever.    Every aspect of what these four guys brought to music is improved here. Kriegers guitar tones are better, Manzareck's organ fills are better, Densmore's jazz touches are better and Jim Morrisons Melodies (if some what crippled by alcahol abuse) are better (or at least far more uinique to him).    No doubt about it, songs like unknown soldier, light my fire, five to one, Road house blues and many, many more were great rock and roll songs, but the albums, let's face it, had alot of fillers and a few complete duds (pretty much all of \\"soft parade\\" suct). With LA women you have the Doors only complete, fully realized album and in my opinion one of rocks ten greatest albums, bar none.    LA Women is essientally a blues album with some jazz mixed in for good measure. To think that they would finally find there stride in simply getting back to basics is very interesting, since most bands did much the opposite. I think the Doors after years of in fighting and self congratulations were sick of making 60's acid rock. It's as if they finally came to terms in unison that they were essentially blues men with a poetic streak. Oh thank heavens for realizations that result in timeless music like this.    In terms of lyrics, musical composition and direction this album blows away their previous efforts in long strides.    Arguably the 2 coolest songs in rock history, \\"the cars hiss by my window\\" and \\"Riders on the Storm\\" are the albums biggest highlights, but they have some stiff competition. \\"Texas radio and the big beat,\\" with it's 10 ton bass line (from the band with no bass player), is filled with almost visual inducing poetry from Morrison And \\"changeling,\\" \\"the crawling king snake\\" and \\"Been down so long\\" are bare bones, rut gut blues at their most abrasive and enthralling. The radiofriendly numbers here, the title track and \\"love her madly,\\" are rock classics and well deserving of thier iconic place in the doors catologue.    But like I said, no fillers, every single track is fully fleshed out, dynamic and muscular. Sorry Doors nuts out there, but LA women makes everything else they did seem sophmoric by comparison, this is where it's at.     If you own one Doors LP, or 1 rock album period, from that era, it's got to be \\"Mr. Mojo Risuns,\\" haunting lady from LA.
B0026P3G12|1.0|I don't know why Susan became more talked about singer than Linda Eder?  Tere are thousands of singers like her, but she is the one that created an unusual story about her life.  If she would not come a second on British Got talent and just sing in the bar, no one would even pay attention.
B000055Y0X|5.0|It has both the elements of a good drama/thriller and of good humor.<br /><br />The movie is an excellent sample of poking fun at the philosophy of MAD, uses stereotypes in a comedic fashion but, still is political thriller that really makes you anxious to know what will happen in the end.<br /><br />If you're looking for slapstick comedy or the in your face kind such as \\"Airplane!\\" (which is an amazing movie in its own right), you should keep looking as this isn't for you.<br /><br />If you enjoy political thrillers and the film noir type, then this movie will give you a tongue in cheek version.
B001GKJ2DY|5.0|Anyone who has a shred of romance in their soul, likes good music, and likes Meryl Streep Has got to love this movie.  It takes advantage of a cinematic setting and does things the onstage musical could not.  If you don't like this you need to get de-Grinched.
B002Q9MZHE|5.0|I love this film. The singers are fantastic, the sets are wonderful, and the filming is terrific.  I'm even in love with the lipstick! Thank you Anna and Rolando .  This is exactly what we need to attract young people to the glories of opera!
B000P0J09C|5.0|Although this film has a bit of independent movie flavor, it still ranks as one of the best.  Showing both the humorous and distasteful side of the Vietnam conflict I highly recommend it for those who enjoy dramatic and suspenseful themes.  It is an altogether dark film, with flashes of hope here and there, and ends with the message that the soldier can be many things yet at the end of the day just wants to be alive.  This is not a movie for young people, as it contains scenes of very graphic violence, but this is the realism of war that makes it great.  It well captures the individual personalities that represent the men who fought in this conflict.
B002SJIO5E|5.0|I never got a chance to see this in theaters, but I knew from the moment I saw the first trailer on line that this movie was going to be something special.  Needless to say I purchased the Blu Ray on release day after work and watched it first thing when I got home.    Saying this movie was amazing considering the 30 million dollar budget is really unfair.  This movie is amazing period.  I'd put this movie up against any big budget blockbuster any day of the week.  They took 30 mil and made it look like 150.  blown away.    There are a lot of complaints that this was shot in \\"documentary style\\" I call it Cloverfield style, but this is really not the case.  yes the first 20-30 minutes is shot as a documentary, but there isn't much more than that.  This film is phenomenal.  I was hooked right from the very beginning.  It is a completely original spin on a common sci-fi theme of metamorphosis, and I don't think I've ever seen it done better.      I knew the movie was going to be fairly gory, but HOLY COW in my wildest imagination I couldn't have expected the gore fest in this movie.  This movie is not for the squeemish.  I'm still just completely blown away by the level of realism in this film.    The characters are all very well acted and completely believable.  It's hard to muster much sympathy for the human characters as they really are the bad guys in this movie, but the main character Wikus has such depth by the end of the film and redeems himself so beautifully and heroically.  The end is touching, heart-warming, and sad all at the same time.    The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the lame story MNU uses to frame Wikus, but that is something so minor it really doesn't take much suspension of disbelief to disregard it.    Everything about this movie is outstanding and it is far and away the best movie I've seen from 2009
B002P5XXR0|4.0|There are a few things one could hold against the score to Avatar. One could remark on the self-plagiarism that, while not unique to James Horner, saturates Horner's work. One could speak to the cheesiness of the score itself, the almost giddy feeling of goofiness you feel listening to the themes. Overall, you might even say Horner is just getting lazy, and hasn't even bothered to create anything new.    I used to say those things, but now I'm giving Horner a break. I've had the score to Avatar playing on just about every device I own that plays music, from home, to the car, to work, and it gets better the more I listen to it.    Yes, Horner cribs almost three decades worth of his own work to create this thematic frankenstein, but it works. It's good! Every theme he uses is familiar, but it fits the movie perfectly. It's a big helping of auditory comfort food. You know the music, and if you're a Horner fan, you love the themes, and you won't care that you've heard them a hundred times already.    Yes, the themes are \\"Titanic\\" cheesy. They're designed to provoke that swelling feeling of emotion in your chest while you watch the film, and in that respect they're perfect. And they're recognizable. It took me twice listening to catch them, but the Na'vi, the military, Jake and Neytiri all have distinct themes that are almost extensions of their characters, and in the end are absolutely beautiful, necessary additions to the story. The way Horner pieced this score together, no matter what it's made of, is what makes it so amazing.    When listening to this CD, you can tell the soundtrack is split into two parts. Jake's exploration of Pandora takes up the first half with beautiful, ethereal music accentuating the visuals, while the second half slides into an epic war-torn score that supercharges the destruction on the screen. It's hard to suggest what could possibly be the \\"best parts\\" of the score, but the way the first half plays, it's definitely the whole, and not the sum of the parts. Tracks 3 through 7 work best as a seamless accompaniment to Jake's introduction to the world and the Na'vi people. The score breaks up after track 7 into pieces that work, and then pieces that blow your ears off. \\"The Destruction of Hometree\\" is heartbreaking, and the epic ending track \\"War\\" is just incredible. That's the track that will get the most repeat play. Watching the film later I did notice some themes missing from the CD that were in the film but the score doesn't suffer from the absence.     The score to Avatar may work best with the film than without, but on its own it still packs quite a punch. Horner may not have the re-inventive talents that other composers do, but he knows what music works and he knows how to conduct an orchestra. I was skeptical on the first listen, but I kept listening and it was worth it.

I bought this movie along with the latest Chessmaster software and now they can't get enough chess!  They can relate to the main character since they are in the same age range, and the real Josh even provides video instruction in Chessmaster.  As a bonus, I really enjoyed the movie myself.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle is a remarkable Artist with a dynamic voice. She demonstrates excellent control with a real heart and humble spirit. I hope that she actively pursues a career as a vocalist. She has so much talent! God bless her. I would recommend that people purchase this CD. They surely won't be the slightest disappointed!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's first album was truly 'awesome', can't wait for the next album to come out!! We loved the variety of songs on her album the most. We will certainly purchase her next cd too!
B000ICLRIE|1.0|This is one of the greatest movies ever made, unfortunately, after getting rid of our dvd copy and buying it on blu-ray, we discovered that the blu-ray version only contains the movie and has none of the special features from the dvd release.  We will be re-buying it on dvd.
B002KVSJ64|4.0|How can I kill myself? Let me count the ways. After the great 'We are not alone' and 'Phobia', I found this album good, but relentlessly depressing.<br />It drives into your brain and dwells in your subconscious. It did for me anyway. It is a great album and it does rock. Its just emotionally rough.<br />I'm almost afraid to listen to it again. U OK Ben?

B000O178BY|1.0|A huge NIN fan and honestly dumbfounded by all the rave reviews here. This album is average. It was devised/recorded on a laptop on tour and sounds like it.    This is an insult to NIN fans, because given time as with previous albums this could have been the brilliantly realised concept album that warranted all the hype and buildup. But instead the songs are rushed and then overladen with noise, as with many other reviewers I find only a few tracks have replay value. Of course they are catchy Trent songs but have barely played this album 5 times in 2 years.    As with anything when the focus is not on the primary goal ie the music.. the 'Year Zero project' including a remix album, an alternate reality game, and a potential television or film project.. then the primary goal suffers. And instead of working in a studio with guitars worked on the road.. coz it was fun.. maybe for him but not for me.    This had potential after the relatively shallow but poppy With Teeth, with the subject matter and music given time to focus and develop it properly instead of just layering noise could have been another superb album. Just listened to Fragile again the other day and was blown away by the detail.    I read that during concerts he told people to steal this album because of the ridiculous pricing, I think (maybe sub-consciously) he was also saying that he didn't feel he had put in the effort he did with all previous albums that loyal NIN fans were expecting and deserve. An album rushed together on tour for fun maybe should have been given away for free.
B00005K3O4|3.0|this movie is a typical D movie, very bad, but that is what makes it so good. no high dollar effects, just plain simple camera tricks.

B001KVZ6FW|3.0|Upon arrival of this DVD, I discovered that the plastic devices at the center of the interior of the DVD case (the ones that hold the disc in place) were broken. As a result, the DVD slid around a great deal causing it to be somewhat scratched. I do not know whether or not this was the case upon shipment, but it most definitely was the case upon arrival.
0060254920|5.0|This book first came out when I was a child and was a favorite of my younger siblings.  Later in life it appeared again and was a favorite of my children.  With the release of the movie I searched for it to share with my grandchildren and, of course, it is now one of their favorite books
B00004RF83|5.0|This is one of my once a year movies.  I watch this and a few others once every year because they are that good.  The finest performance Kirk Douglas ever gave, and Lancaster, in real life an avid political liberal, portrays a fanatic military officer planning treason.  Buy it, watch it and when your kids are old enough to understand it, have them watch it.  The best scene? The confrontation at the pentagon hallway between Lancaster and Douglas near the end of the movie.
B000000OQF|5.0|I was sitting around with my husband a few weeks ago having a drink.  A Guns 'n Roses song came on and we got into a discussion about which song from Appetite for Destruction was the best.  I said, \\"I've lost my copy of Appetite at least three times; I should just go on Amazon and order another one.\\"  So I did.  For around $10, I had a new copy in my hand in less than a week.  Speed of service, great.  Quality, great.  Love it!
B002QGUFWE|5.0|Lady Gaga is simply a outstanding artist. Her music is in a league of its own, along with her videos. Bad Romance should be the 2009 song of the year. Will be patiently waiting for future hits by the new queen!
1423119509|5.0|The outer box had slight/minor damages, as was described in the original description.  The Books were in ABSOLUTELY PERFECT CONDITION.  I highly recommend the seller for the professional manner and straightforward description of the product.  The savings in the purchase for the very minor damage to a box that would be recycled anyway was AMAZING  ~  The books are a good read for all, I am an adult and read them also and enjoyed them all.  I would think that approx. ages of 8 to adult would enjoy these,  Thank you again ! ! !
B001PO53IO|5.0|Didn't think I was going to like the series, but the creators have done a fantastic job in both storytelling and artistry.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This CD does justice to Susan's Boyle's voice and life . . . and the renewed feeling of hope that she represents to all.  Go get 'em, Susan, just waiting to hear more!!  Gave two of these CD's as Xmas gifts as well and the recipients are sure to share my enthusiasm!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|Science fiction in the tradition of Ray Bradbury's Martian Chronicles.  This  movie is more of a morality allegory than hard sci-fi.  There isn't much of an explanation about the alien's home or their culture, it's more about their experience living side by side with humanity. Definitely worth watching.
B001R60ESE|5.0|I'd seen this performance on PBS and decided to order two DVD's for Christmas gifts.  UNFORTUNATELY, I found out too late that a Blu-Ray player is necessary to play it.  I'm surprised you don't sell a DVD that plays on a regular DVD player, or at least explain that Blu-Ray doesn't work on a regular DVD player.
B000002ITM|4.0|A Slower, more-mature offering from one of metal's heavyweights. Testament has stood the test of of time, and in my book is one of the better of the \\"thrash\\" bands of that era. Approaching 20 years since the release of this album, it presents itself as being just as crisp and fresh as the time it was released. Arguably their best, but definitely one of my favorite from this excellent metal act.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|I'm shocked to see the good/great reviews on this. Shows how sick American minds are. This is a gross, stupid and bad acting movie. I turned this off after 30 mins.
0385532458|5.0|I have read everyone of John Grisham's books and have especially enjoyed the few where he got away from the legal thrillers.  This is one of his best.  I love short stories anyway and John Grisham has the gift.  They are extremely well written
B001AQT11M|5.0|I ordered two video's - Pete's Dragon and Snow White and received them sooner than I thought.  Can't beat Amazon for fast delivery, that's for sure.  And they always have the item I want.  I'm an Amazon fan forever.  Five stars without question.
0446679089|4.0|Like some other reviewers, of the DeMille novels I've read, this is the one I liked best. This is a book where you can truly say that the main character is as entertaining as the plot, and that's a bit rare. One rule DeMille sort of breaks is revealing the villain well before the final page, but, in this case, it seems to work. I did not feel like tossing the book aside as soon as I identified the antagonist. Not sure if I agree that the book should have been 100 pages briefer. An expert editor could definitely have cut here and there, but I didn't think it was 100 pages too long.<br />I don't necessarily recommend everything DeMille writes in glowing terms, but this was very good.
B001P5HI4A|2.0|Yentl dvd only worked on one of the discs; already sent it as a gift.
B002RXS1OK|5.0|Without a doubt, this Dracula is the most courtly, cultured and seductive of them all. After Langella's run as Broadway's Dracula, he brought to the screen a deliciously sophisticated vampire.  Kate Nelligan is marvelous.  This telling of this tale is less gory, more love story.
B0029LHW68|5.0|This album is a unique bridge between 30 Seconds to Mars first 2 albums.  It has a massive sound with all the vocals, synths and unpresidented uniqueness on each song.  The song L490 just takes you by surprise.  A couple of the songs have you dancing to them and for this band that is truely different. I was not sure what to expect given the first 2 albums are so different from each other.  This band has managed to deliver to me an album that I enjoy listening to and find myself singing to. I would highly recommend you give it a try because I know you are going to like it.
0545123267|3.0|Shiver has gotten a lot of praise since its release and I can understand why, in some respects at least. Stiefvater introduces us to Grace, the everyday, average shy girl with a strange obsession with wolves and Sam, one of the wolves in question. Grace has had this obsession and need for the wolves in her life since she was a little girl. Sam, the yellow-eyed wolf/man has been watching Grace for as long as she can remember. When their worlds collide, a romance spirals out from it and many difficulties follow.<br /><br />The werewolf mythology that Stiefvater develops is interesting, but the story is more about the romance and I'm not a huge romance person. The wolf story had me hooked from the beginning though and I would have loved to know more about that aspect of it. Grace's and Sam's alternating POV's is refreshing and I found myself reading more to get to know them better. I do have to say that there were more than a few parts that I didn't enjoy though.<br /><br />Grace's obsession with the wolves is integral to the story, but her apparent love for the wolves, not Sam the person, but being in love with a wolf prior to knowing it/he was a person, is just weird to me. It made me view Grace in a skewed way. I can understand her obsession, but her being in love just didn't make sense to me. There was also some language that I absolutely could not stand. Grace is 17 and Sam is 18 and I don't need them to be dropping f-bombs left and right, but saying `poopy'!? No. Realistically, a 17 or 18 year old would not say poopy and it just made me laugh. Sam's constant lyrical, poetic breakthroughs were annoying and some scenes were way too sappy for my liking.<br /><br />The overall story and the rest of the writing allowed me to get past these most of these issues and still enjoy the book to a degree. Steifvater certainly can write well and put you into that Minnesota atmosphere. The entire time I was reading it I felt cold. The book is cold, but in such a good way. I do wish that the minor characters had a somewhat larger role because I was completely drawn to Isabel, but I did enjoy what little of them we get to see. Unfortunately, I rarely felt completely engrossed and devoted to the love story aspect, but the wolves kept me reading. Grace and Sam were well-developed and even though the ending felt rushed, I still recommend reading the book. I'm sure many people will be unable to put the book down, even though I don't feel quite the same way.<br /><br />I have to say that the Rilke excerpts were incredible and the last one was absolutely heartbreaking.acters had a somewhat larger role because I was completely drawn to Isabel, but I did enjoy what little of them we get to see.

B002EA4IO8|5.0|The Boy in the Striped Pajamas presents a vision of Germany, under Hitler's reign, through the eyes of an innocent and naïve 9 year old. The language is written in a way that younger readers will understand and grasp onto, but not so much that it is strictly aimed towards younger readers. The book's topic is anything but childish. Nazis, war, and the mistreatment of Jewish people are touched upon, but rarely outwardly addressed.<br /><br />Bruno, a precocious and adventurous 9 year old, meets Shmuel, a 9 year old Jew in the concentration camp, on the other side of the fence at Auschwitz. What follows is a touching tale of friendship, love, and the barriers that young children overlook or don't see at all.<br /><br />The following is written on the back cover of the book and I believe it sums it all up very well:<br /><br />\\"If you start to read this book, you will go on a journey with a nine-year-old boy named Bruno. (Though this isn't a book for nine-year-olds.) And sooner or later you will arrive with Bruno at a fence.<br /><br />Fences like this exist all over the world.<br />We hope you never have to encounter one.\\"<br /><br />One fence changes Bruno's life forever and this story can easily change yours. It is touching, heartbreaking, and knowing that things like this actually occurred is sickening.<br /><br />Years ago I had the opportunity to see an exhibit at a museum in England that focused on the Jewish Holocaust victims and survivors. Outside of the museum was a piece of the Berlin Wall. I remember that day and the feelings that all of those images evoked within me. Reading The Boy in the Striped Pajamas was a lot like that day and it's not something I'll easily forget.
B001J6NZGU|5.0|I just sat and watched this film for the first time with my wife who is enjoying her first day of her Christmas break.  We were both blown away by the great story lines and the quality of the acting.  The casting is right on, and each individual performance is excellent.  A brief scene in which Candace Bergen, a mother tells her daughter how it felt to be betrayed by an unfaithful husband was, in my opinion, worthy of an Academy Award best supporting nomination. I've always enjoyed her comedy, but this was a fine dramatic performance.  I can see that many have panned this film, and I cannot understand why.  It's a keeper.
0385737947|4.0|The Maze Runner is a sci-fi/dystopian novel at its best. It starts off with Thomas, a boy of about 16, waking up in a metal box with a bunch of teen boys, some older, some younger, staring at him. Thomas comes to learn that he has arrived in the Glade and he is now part of a small, self-contained community of boys. Each boy has his own job and title and for the past two years, the boys have been working to solve the puzzle of the Maze.<br /><br />Like most of the boys, Thomas is scared upon his arrival, but unlike everyone else, Thomas has a feeling of familiarity with the Glade. When a girl arrives the day after Thomas, it's clear that everything is changing and it seems like Thomas may play a part in that change.<br /><br />It took me some time to really get into The Maze Runner, but once I did, I was completely hooked. James Dashner is so descriptive and has created such an elaborate story that it is hard not to enjoy. The mystery of the Maze had me so intrigued that I needed to know more. The Gladers,  the Maze, the Grievers, it's all so mysterious and unknown that I found myself reading more and more, in an attempt to solve the mystery.<br /><br />The story is incredibly well-crafted with likable characters and twists and turns galore. There were times when I was nearly screaming because I didn't want the characters to do something and other times I was on the edge of my seat gnawing on my fingernails in anticipation.<br /><br />One word that can perfectly describe this book is intense. The novel is intense in all respects. It can scare you death, have you laughing, and it even moved me to tears. The ending was entirely unexpected and the last 150 pages or so completely blew me away. The Maze Runner is pure genius and I'm now anxiously awaiting the second book in the series.
B000HEWEJO|4.0|This movie is a classic. There's nothing to not like here. The characters are great and the ending is perfect.
0375842209|5.0|Death, our narrator, is a conscientious worker, and we didn't know until reading this book that it was kind.  Kind, thoughtful, and extremely tired.  The characters construct themselves in our minds as if from smoke and sky into tendons, hair, bone, and life's fragile breath.  We don't fall in love with them while reading.  It's as though we always knew and loved them.      Each day we close the book once more, we suddenly notice the skies over us.  Why didn't we ever before notice all the colors of the sky?  Why has no other author painted the skies for us like this, ever, throughout human history?    I am a child of a Holocaust survivor.  I've been there, in life, in history, in heavily accented stories, in countless books of fiction and truth.  And yet this book brought me to a different Hitler's Germany, one that was fresh, equally ugly, but brand new to me.    I read a lot of good books.  There are many good books, and I enjoy them.  This one moved me like a disease into a state of synesthesia, beyond my senses into my emotions.  All my emotions fused, became one, and the secrets of life became known to me like they will the day I eventually die.      You might think, after reading this review, that you won't want to handle reading this book, but you will.  You will enjoy it very much.
0307474275|5.0|this book is great, because it find its ways to show truth. Truth like it is found eg in [[ASIN:1936060264 Jesus The Book]] or [[ASIN:0892819111 The Gospel of Mary Magdalene]].

B000002AH9|5.0|The very first instant I ever heard the voice of Billie Holiday was on YOU'VE CHANGED from the album LADY IN SATIN. I was completely unprepared. Never had listened to Jazz. Never, for an instant, had I suspected that a singer singing a song could create in me what I was experiencing as I listened to this voice. It seemed to me that with the onset of the sound of her voice I entered a realm of experience that until that very moment I never knew existed. I'd been missing something without knowing what it was; was lonely for something or because of something, again, without knowing what it was. And then there it was, the sound of this voice and what it was expressing, and suddenly, I was transported into the pulsating heartbreaking land of .... INTIMACY .... VULNERABILITY .... and that mysterious, infinitely complex thing called .... LOVE. I happened to be watching an actress perform a monologue on-stage in a theatre when this took place. In it, the actress turned on a record player before she began to speak, and this music began. And from the instant it did everything but this voice and what it was singing about, instantly vanished. It was as though up to that very moment I'd been living in a fog, and with the beginning of Billie Holiday singing YOU'VE CHANGED - the fog lifted. For the first time I saw that there was more to life, more to emotions, more to pain than I'd ever had the courage to open myself up to - and mostly, more to the life I was living than I'd ever imagined there was. This album, LADY IN SATIN, is, from beginning to end - a work of genius. Billie Holiday is the singer. Ray Ellis is the arranger and conductor of The Ray Ellis Orchestra. There are thirteen songs on the album, picked by Ms. Holiday, some of them suggested (also) by her attorney, Earle Zaidins. They couldn't be more perfect for what she needed to express at this moment in her life. And she knew it. I wonder if she also knew she had only seventeen  months to live after finishing this album? Can't help but wonder about that .... ? Some people feel she did her best work as a singer earlier in her career. And that, when she made this album she was played out .... worn out .... destroyed by the life she'd lived. I don't feel that way. This is the album in which her gifts as a vocal artist are purified, hallowed .... HOLY. There is nothing between her heart, her vulnerability, and that of the listener. I dare you to listen to this album and not feel. Dare you to listen and NOT care about what it is to be alive .... to be human .... to own & be aware of feelings. I defy your heart to be exposed to this album and NOT be penetrated by this .... LADY IN SATIN.bum? Can't help but wonder about that .... ?

B000002A3T|5.0|I read a few of the one-star reviews for this CD and I just can't believe anybody would give this one star.  My guess is that these are a bunch of Roger Waters fanatics who are pushing 60 and are harkening back to the days when they used to smoke a dube in the 70's and listen to classic psychadelic Floyd and try to figure out what it meant. I liked Floyd back in the day (late 70's and early 80's) and I thought their music was cool.  But Floyd didn't need Roger Waters and this CD, their last, proves it.  I listened to this on  a tape that I made from a CD from the library back when it first came out.  I bought it last year at a used book store on a CD and started to listen to it again a couple of weeks ago.  This album is just great.  I saw others calling it \\"pop\\" but it's not pop.  It's more mainstream for Floyd but it's far from \\"pop\\" music.  There are elements here that sound like old Floyd and yet a more mature, tighter sound.  The recording is great, all of the songs are great (especially Keep Talking, What Do You Want From Me, High Hopes, Coming Back to Life and Lost For Words)  Gilmour's electric guitar is great as always and is unmistakably David Gilmour.  He has has some great acoustic work and rips the solo on High Hopes on a lap-steel guitar.  This album shows a seasoned band looking back on their lives and giving some honest reflection about life. True,it doesn't sound like Floyd circa 1977, it sounds like a band that has evolved musically but still maintains elements of the sound that made them famous.     If you liked a Momentary Lapse of Reason at all you will love this work.  I don't care what anybody says: this is Pink Floyd at it's best, with or without Roger Waters.

B000B5XOSO|5.0|Few things are as difficult in movie Show-biz, as launching a film that demands a sequel, and then producing a sequel feature that is as good or even better than the original, and here, with BATMAN RETURNS, Director Tim Burton pulls it off spectacularly.    Here, in this review I'm recommending the two-disc Special Edition, though I have the show on a DVD tape, only because this movie is one of the very best examples of the comic book hero genre there is, and has never been surpassed.  Whatever form you find it in, treasure and enjoy it.    Beginning at the bottom in a list of superlatives, with overall design and set, viewers will find that this is the best expression of that historical Deco or Moderne style prevalent in the late '30s, when the Batman figure debuted.  The buildings express the Neo-Nazi worker hero iconography of Rockefeller Center, as you see it even today in architectural sculpture over the doors and in the open spaces -- as well as in the famous lobby ceiling murals.  Its a take-off from the Worlds Fair of '33 and the murals and illustrations of Jon Vassos.  And Burton's design team nails it, for though it is in color, it feels nightmare black and white, which is the way people dreampt, back then.  The vehicles of the heroes, The Batmobile as well as Penguin's Killer Rubber Ducky are like the toys of the period.  The period costumes of all the characters are excellent and hotter, even, than those from older movies and strips.    CHRISTOPHER WALKEN:  He plays not the principal villain, but an unsavory one, with a brilliant sociopathic timing that cannot be adequately described.  In fact, if one were to review all the many villains large and small that Walken has created on screen, one would have to say these freaks and misfits are his professional specialties, and maybe you'd think creating them is easy to do.  Not so.  Myself, I remember the first time I saw Walken play, in a revival of Tennessee Williams' SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH in New York City, atthe Harkness.  He played Chance Wayne against Irene Worth's Ariadne del Lago, and the effect was absolutely unconventional and sensational!  Originally, the play opened with Paul Newman as the hustler-gigolo, playing against Geraldine Paige as the faded movie queen in the Mississippi Riviera hotel.  Young and hugely talented as she was, Paige played it like her version of Gloria Swanson or Pola Negri, with exagerated make-up.  Newman played it in white silk pyjamas, unbutoned and flashing that famous washboard belly.  It was fabulous!  Women went nuts!  It was priceless and worth far more than your seat cost.  But the flaw in the production was that anybody taking one look at Newman would realize there was no reason on god's green earth why he shouldn't be a movie star, and the play depended on his beig a failed wannabe.  But in the revival, Worth played the Princess like an American actress (which she was, though expatriate) with English upper-crust manners over the soul of a gutter opportunist.  Perfect!  Walken played Chance Wayne like a young Elvis with a greasy pompadour and a Tupelo Mississippi accent, complete with uncouth, redneck mannerisms.  It was a triumph of the actor's art.  Here, the role is nothing like that, but Walken brings the same unique intelligence and sensitivity to this role, and if you watch his performance whenever hes's on screen, you'll see how extremely good he is at what he does.  Always fresh.    MICHAEL KEATON:  He is phenomenal, not because he's super-handsome, or has a magnificent body or an arielist's agility, but because he has enough of what's required for the role -- that is, a manly persona -- and one thing extra: generosity and poise.  Bruce Wane's ambivalence, sexual frustration and guilt he can and does play, but what's so good about it is that he allows his role to be the fulcrum or balance of the show, allowing his co-stars Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito to function to their advantage.  Secure in his character, he never upstages them.  That that's the perfect expression of Bruce's persona: He is a violent nocturnalist, but always a gentleman.    MICHELLE PFEIFFER:  This is one of the most beautiful women ever to appear on the screen, and she can and does out-act just about everybody in the Biz, and has for years.  Here, her take on Catwoman is so rich, so rare and unusual, she puts all preceding sisters to shame, from Lee Meriwether to Eartha Kitt, to Julie Newmar; not only for sexual desirability and believability, but for pure psychotic nymphomania.  And, she does it with a look that's perfect for the period, with a head topped by a cluster of blonde curls, and wearing a slinky black dress.  Madonna used it in Dick Tracy.  Dietrich used it in Pittsburg.  But, on top of all that, it is her transformation from frowsy, cringing secretarial doormat to snarling pyromaniac in stiched black vinyl that takes the cake.  It is a performance searing in its twisted, pathetic truth.    And now, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to present the one, the only, the superlative DANNY De VITO:  This is an actor who's been around the block for a long time.  He's given many performances on film, and most of them have been good to exceptional, but he's never had the opportunity to reach for the brass ring of screen monsterdom, and here, in BATMAN RETURNS, Tim Burton gives him the opportunity.  And, I must warn you, whether or not you have seen De Vito play it, with PENGUIN or Oswald Cobblepot, Danny De Vito achieves a quality of work equal to that of Conrad Veidt, Charles Laughton or even Lon Cheney, Sr.  The peaks and valleys of his frenzies, his manias and perverse lusts, his outbreaks of mindless violent malice, are a sight to behold, simultaneously hilarious and hideous; both pathetic and loathsome.  You might think, 'overacting,' but no; its pure Method.  Watching BATMAN RETURNS yet again I believe that Burton created this film for De Vito.  As good as the other actors in the cast are, and theyare excellent, it is impossible to imagine any actor playing this role even remotely as well as De Vito does.   It makes you think, if the man could sing, what a RIGOLETTO he would be!    And that brings us down to what there is about the BATMAN opera that makes them  unique.  More than anything else, this is a set of ensemble pieces like a Hell's Kitchen series of American comedia del'Arte morality plays.  The vitality of the show derives from the rigid confines of its convention.  Sure, ambitious directors, often foreigners, attempt to pull and stretch the animated figures, to stuff them with fadistic pseudo-psychological theories of their own, but they don't work.  The BATMAN shows sprang into life as action fantasies for American pre-teen boys during the years of the Second World War and are thrilling not because they are psychologically plausible -- they're not -- but because they transcend reality the way the marionettes of Palermo do when they re-enact the adventures of Frankish knights struggling against the Saracens before the walls of Jerusalem.    At any rate, take my advice and give yourself the opportunity to watch the great Danny De Vito play.  He is as fascinating as Milton's Satan.
6305252572|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best cop flicks ever.  It combines fantastic performances by Nolte and Murphy together with lots of excellent action, a solid and engaging storyline, and some incredible humor.  This film made Eddie Murphy a box office sensation and also propelled Nolte's career into the big time.<br /><br />The storyline is simple.  Nick Nolte is a tough San Francisco detective known to be a little too quick on the trigger.  When one of his fellow cops gets shot by a convict on the run, Nolte goes after him.  He quickly discovers that one of the convict's ex-partners, (Murphy) is incarcerated, and he gets him sprung to help track down the convict.  At first there is hostility, but gradually the two manage a tenuous bond of mutual respect.  Lots of first-rate action punctuate the story.  As if that were not enough, this film features a scene by Murphy (the \\"cowboy bar scene\\") that is one of the funniest scenes in any flick ever.  (This one scene both makes the movie and made Murphy a first-rank star.)<br /><br />There is not a dull moment in this film.  From the very first scenes it grabs the viewer's attention and never lets go. The supporting cast is just about as good as Nolte and Murphy.  Highly recommended.  RJB.
0345495004|5.0|Usually takes me 50 pages or so to get \\"hooked\\" on a book, but Loving Frank grabbed me from the start.  Well written historical fiction vividly portrays Frank Lloyd Wright's relationship with his lover.  She was a motivating character in his life until her tragic end.  Good reading!!
0399247459|5.0|This is my 4 and [...] favorite book.  We have a little game, everytime we read about what the caterpillar ate \\"he ate 2 strawberries but he was still...\\" the boys yell \\"HUNGRY!\\"  Or near the end of the story when we read about how the caterpillar wasn't little anymore, he was a...\\"BIG FAT CATERPILLAR\\" the boys yell again.  It will be one of those mommy memories that will last until I'm all old and grey!  My [...] especially loves this story and would read it over and over and over again in one day if I let him.<br /><br />We purchased this book for my [...] niece this Christmas, and believe she will love it as much as my boys have.  This particular version of the book is all board book, which is perfect for a great book like this which promises to be a favorite and will get lots of wear and tear.<br /><br />On an educational note, I like how this book teaches young kids to count in a subtle way, as well as teaching them labels for different fruits and foods.  This book is also a simply put book which teaches them about the metamorphosis of caterpillars and butterflies!
B0026P3G12|1.0|SuBo is the most over-hyped singer of all time and this album  proves it. She really is an average singer who might make a living out of chorus work in stage musicals, as long as she is kept in the back row. If she was as good as people seem to believe then she would have made it in music long ago. Her appeal has been that someone fat, ugly and given to outbursts of rather bizaare behaviour could actually sing in tune. There is nothing in this album that makes me want to sit down and listen to it again. If you want to give yourself or someone you love a real treat, then grab a copy of Faryl Smith's new album \\"Wonderland\\". Now there is a real rising star whose albums will still be selling in the stores long after SuBo's have been dumped in the bargain bins. If you prefer to support US talent then the gorgeous Linda Eder will give you a lot more than SuBo, and I'm a Brit suggesting this.
B00168OIOE|5.0|Most movies may leave you wondering if it was worth the money to upgrade your setup to Bluray, but Pixar movies will prove just how much of a difference there is.  This movie is beautifully rendered with crisp details (so many features of the monsters' skins and furs that I had never noticed before), and the sound may not be mixed 7-channel but it is encoded in DTS Master which provides phenomenal clarity and fidelity (fitting for a movie that won several awards for sound and music).  In my wife's words, \\"It's better than when we saw it at the movies.\\"  Similar to \\"Up,\\" this title comes in Disney's new Blu++ format where you get the Blu-ray movie and special features, a DVD copy of the movie and a digital file copy for use with your PC/Mac or favorite portable media player.  It's my opinion that this is the smartest thing Disney has ever done.  Having the DVD copy gives parents and children an option when traveling (plenty of vehicles with DVD players in them) or spending time at a different location where a Blu-ray player is not available (we have grandparents living on a farm in the middle of nowhere and friends who haven't upgraded yet).  The digital file is great as well.  Right now I use this to turn my iPhone into my own personal in flight entertainment system, but in the not too distant future I can see providing my daughter with an iPod of her very own.  Disney says all their movies will be like this going forward, and I wish they would go ahead and re-release all the existing Pixar Blu-ray catalog in the new format.  Would love to be sporting a legal copy of \\"Cars\\" and \\"Bug's Life\\" on the iPhone.
1416583408|5.0|This book is not just about dogs.  Author Horowitz challenges us to look at our surroundings through the eyes (and nose and ears) of our pet.  It is a serious work, the science well documented. (There are 30 pages of notes!)  But it is written with the wit and warmth of \\"Marley and Me\\".  Having read it, I have a fuller appreciation of the 12 wonderful years I spent with my beloved mixed-Lab mutt, Osker, and I learned something of myself as well.  For all dog lovers: DON'T MISS THIS ONE.\\"
B0026P3G12|5.0|most addicting and amazing cd I have heard in years. Can't turn it off.  Every song is different and the arrangements are amazing.
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|This CD is simply beautiful. The music is simple, delicate, and just lovely. This is the only CD that affords me comfort on those nights where I can't sleep because my head is pounding. It's also wonderful to listen to while working or feeling in a contemplative mood. The work the composers did on this album is truly appreciated.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|For me its hard to pick a favorite Alicia Keys album. Not because each album is great but because all of them are different. \\"Songs In A Minor\\" was an introduction to who she is. \\"Diary of Alicia Keys\\" gave us more of her personal side. \\"As I Am\\" was a statement album. With her latest \\"The Element of Freedom\\", Ms. Keys continues her climb to superstardom.<br /><br />The joy of this album occurs in the first 6 songs. Alicia Keys opens with \\"Love Is Blind\\" which has a very seductive beat.  She follows that up with her first single \\"Dosent Mean Anything\\".\\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\" is a good mid-tempo track. This is followed by two ballads \\"Wait Til' You See My Smile\\" & \\"That's How Strong My Love Is\\". After that the album loses some of its flavor with \\"Un-Thinkable, Love Is My Disease & Like The Sea\\". It drops even lower by time you get to \\"This Bed\\". And it hits rock bottom by the time you get to the highly anticipated Beyonce duet,\\"Put It In A Love Song\\". Even through all the ups and downs, the saving grace of this album is \\"Empire State Of Mind (Part II)\\". With just her and a piano for most of the song, she took one hot hook and made it a whole song.<br /><br />Alicia Keys is a major player in the R & B game. She went from being that piano playing, light-skinned girl with the braids to one of the most successful artist of this generation. She brings something new everytime she drops an album. Her talent is so different from Beyonce & Keyshia Cole. This dosent make her better than them just on another playing field. And now \\"Element of Freedom\\" is Alicia's most musical album to date. She experiments with so many different sounds we are not use to hearing. Her voice is as powerful as ever, choosing to rely more on vocals than instruments to carry the album. This is not a perfect album, but it is another good listen by a person who was born to make music.
0060899220|5.0|P.G. Wodehouse and Keith Richards have merged their sperm and implanted it into Julia Child's egg, giving the world Anthony Bourdain.  Don't read Kitchen Confidential on the subway. Like the best Bertie-and-Jeeves concoctions, Bourdain's memoir of his life as an over-educated journeyman pirate chef will have you bursting into such loud, sobbing laughter so often that your fellow passengers will be on their cell phones to the men in the white coats asking that you be carted off to protective custody.   The thing about Anthony Bourdain, though, is that he's far more than a prankster. That's what makes Kitchen Confidential so much more than \\"light summer reading.\\"  As is actually pretty obvious with Keith Richards, the charming bad-boy persona that Bourdain cultivates harbors a keen intelligence, professional passion of the highest order, a compassionate heart, and the wisdom of a man who's seen and done just about everything and lived to tell about it.   Kitchen Confidential is full of funny anecdotes about Bourdain's wayward life, falling in love with food as a child on family holidays in France, attending Vassar, and eventually ending up in culinary school and working in a series of B-movie cooking jobs.   Bourdain has traveled through the American Food Revolution. When he was coming up, Julia Child had started her little insurgency on American public television, but the nation's restaurants and supermarkets by and large lagged behind. In 1975, I remember my junior high home economics teacher telling our class that the \\"best\\" (or at least most expensive) restaurant in Seattle was using Bacos artificial allegedly-bacon-like bits in its salads, and my father reporting that his restauranteur golf buddies confessed to using margarine instead of butter to reduce food costs. Stay-at-home mothers everywhere were whipping up Hamburger Helper, or if feeling adventurous, turning to Peg Bracken's \\"I Hate to Cook Book\\" for tips on using canned cream of mushroom soup to turn anyordinary item--chicken, steak, carrots, ice cream--into a \\"gourmet\\" dish. All ends well when Bourdain lands at Brasserie les Halles, cooking his beloved French classics. In those dark years before (I hate to say it since I can see where Bourdain comes from when he calls her Pol Pot in a muumuu) Alice Waters changed the way high-end American restaurants approached food, no wonder he took comfort in powders and needles. Things, as Bourdain happily acknowledges, have changed, with \\"chef\\" a respected profession and American diners considerably more sophisticated in their tastes and expectations.   Where Bourdain digs deeper, he's even better. He tells a funny, heartbreaking tale of a gay couple who are good home cooks and decide they can run a restaurant because Lauren Bacall loves their meat loaf. They open a beautiful little jewel box of a place, and lose their shirts. Nobody, not even their dear friend Lauren Bacall, wants to eat the same dish at the same restaurant every night. The restaurant business is not for the faint of heart, the shallow of pocket book, or the inexperienced.  The things Bourdain shares with Julia Child are a passion for well prepared food and the desire and ability to proselytize about it in a highly opinionated but extremely engaging way (though I doubt Mrs. Child would approve of his language). He treasures adventurous diners. He treasures great chefs, among whom he is not conceited enough to count himself--and is wise enough to laugh at himself for becoming one of the celebrity chefs for whom he has such profound contempt. He treasures the Latin American immigrants who do the vast majority of American restaurant cooking while some white guy hogs the spotlight. He treasures his own opportunities to travel and try absolutely everything. He treasures what's best in people of all cultures--their capacity for hospitality and generosity. He hates people who impose artificial limits on their diets. He hates people who preach from a position of affluence to the poor about what they should eat. He doesn't like doing pastry. He hates whatever that stuff is that comes out of a garlic press.   Reading some of the negative reviews, I can't believe those people read the same book, but as Bourdain would no doubt agree, each to his own taste. This is a profane sort of book, with lots of swearing and a fair bit of intoxication, but it's hard to imagine the humor working nearly so well otherwise. It's true he can get a bit long-winded, and the effort at maintaining the bad boy facade shows strain from time to time. Still, the number of books out there that make you laugh this hard are few. The number of books out there that teach you this much are few. Five stars.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|If you like Christmas movies and haven't seen this one, you are missing out.  Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!
B001OQCV2E|4.0|While not quite a great achievement, I do think this is the best Disaster movie I've seen so far.  Please be note that I like disaster movies for the disasters, premise, and action, big arks for mankind, yadda yadda yadda.  Most definitely, definitely, NOT characters or profound messages.  As and added bonus, you get an end of the world premise.  While the ending is not quite the perfect disaster ending (if I could make my own disaster movie, I would have an in depth 2 hour non stop slideshow of the world getting destroyed), I mean, who cares about humanity anyway?  But even if there is, that's not really a movie anyway, just the fantasy of my poor sad mind (just kidding, I like people sometimes, I'm just neurotic.  Who isn't?).  Besides, having the master of disaster Roland Emmerich on board and the decision to cram everything in makes it a contender for my favorite disaster movie ever.  It's got everything you want from this movie, delivered Emmerich style.  Its not perfect, but it's still a fun piece of work that certainly doesn't deserve worst movie of the week and worst DVD release from the Razzies (UPDATE: Transformers wins three Razzies including worst picture.  Here's to the next ten viewings anyway!).<br /><br />Roland Emmerich was once on my list of directors who inspire dislike, but now I think people sometimes need to get off his (and Bay's) jock.  While he made that piece of garbage Godzilla (and Bay made Pearl Harbor), I'm starting to think both Bay and Emmerich just have haters who mindless bash him (I think both have their share of abominations and mediocre blockbusters, though).  Granted, both directors get criticism, but even I admit that I almost just wanted to hop on the Bay hating bandwagon like everyone else.  I thought I would never love movies like this, and I still don't like most of the Jerry Bruckheimer vehicles and blockbusters, which I have seen (Top Gun, Pirates of the Carribean, Gone in 60 seconds).  But both directors proved me wrong with movies like Transformers, The Island, even ID4, and the \\"mother of all disaster movies\\" (according to Roger Ebert, but that could be bad based on your opinion of the world's most famous film critic), 2012.<br /><br />LIke the title says, the movie is based, loosly on the self described prophecies of 2012.  At the same time, Roland Emmerich's OWN science (according to him, he takes the science of something and makes his own) is in the movie.  This time, it's something about neutrons or something.  Whatever?  The truth is, I think the science is kind of cool.  While it's not that accurate, it does have people really ________ up the earth's core because of some scientific meddling.  I don't care really, but the science hasn't been attacked as much as the Day After Tomorrow, which makes the premise a bit more forgiving.  Thats what makes the plot work more, is that it wasn't near the inaccuracy that Day AFter Tomorrow had in mind.  Is it Scientifically Inaccurate?  Probably.  But I won't be seeing much complaints for the scientific community as Armageddon and Day after TOmorrow had, so the premise is fine.  Besides, something like the end of the world allows for less than the Day after Tomorrow ever had.  That's my only argument as to why this movie is more believable.  After all, suspension of Disbelief is fine, but suspension of logic and science is way less forgiving in my opinion.  It features more of the first, and a forgivable amount of the last two.  Which makes the whole movie enjoyable.<br /><br />Characters and dialogue are a bit of a weakness as usual for an Emmerich film, as its not that bad but not that great either.  While the cast in this doesn't create a plethora of memorable characters that will be on the same boat as the characters from Terminator 2, Star Wars, (were talking big blockbusters here), Alien, etc. I think it's one of his better casts, especially compared to Godzilla featuring a less than stellar cast.  Here, its not so bad.  Many of these actors were not well known to me beforehand, but it features of a mix of not annoying no-names and some actors who are well known and not annoying (at least for me).  Having the kick @$$ John Cusack on board helps a lot, as he is much cooler than Jeff Goldblum, Matthew Broderick, and Dennis Quiad combined (at least in my opinion).  Woody Harrelson gives a by the books performance, but I found that it didn't really matter much anyway when he adds an element to the premise.  After all, it would be interesting to know about the theories before it happens.  Most of the other characters are generic but likeable enough to be attractive cardboard cutouts.  IF not, they serve the plot at least.  The other memorable character is Adrian, probably the only character that doesn't have as much cardboard tendencies.  Though I don't think I'll remember him like I do when it comes to Sam Witwicky.<br /><br />As for the dialogue, it's not that cheesy or bad as people make it out to be, though still cliche, some of the lines are fun, but forgiving for the most part (they work fine).  Well, at least until those speeches come along.  I don't care if it's the end of the world, besides the presidential speech to everybody, every two minute dialogue speech between two or more characters is beyond annoying, particullary the emotional scenes where they confess their love towards each other.  I don't have a total aversion to sentimental material (Saving Private Ryan is watchable without one hint of snickering from me) but it's just so annoying here.  Cliched, sappy, trite, maudlin, and BORING, they really need to be cut out.  The emotional scenes need to be rewritten, because they are my main complaints about the movie.  Every time they are on screen, I skip it or lapse out.<br /><br />And the other weakness is the family aspect.  Sorry Cusack, I root for you in the end, but (this is personal preference, got it?) I don't care about your family life.  Lucky me though, they don't spend that much time with developing it.  Thanks god this movie is two and half hours long (not counting credits).  Thanks to the chapter skip that lets me skip many of the lame speeches and family scenes (not really thanks to dialogue for the family scenes, just a lack of care.  Emmerich did not make me care).  Everything else is filled with the reaction towards the end of the world, which is what it should be doing after all.  I want this one to run and not just give me disaster after disaster.  Which it does by the way.<br /><br />Ah yes, the movie's most virtuous moments.  At it's best, the movie is a glorious end of the world story with intriguing reactions that make the scenario seem alive, and great set pieces galore ranging from short to roughly 8 minutes.  The Disaster sequences are jaw dropping thrill rides.  The most well known sequence is the LA sequence, and it's a ________ amazing sequence, pitting you literally in the brink of, well, driving a limo on the streets of California while the whole state is crumpling and sinking into the ocean. This movie has been noted by many people for succeeding by being the ultimate disaster movie, and this one has so much disaster crammed into it.  Earthquakes, tsunamis, the earth cracking, meterors, volcanos, and flooding all make it's way into the chaos, and the results make for roughly the best disaster sequences I've seen.  Unlike Bay, who uses a very frentic, cutting style who almost never leaves the camera steady, Emmerich is different because he is never chaotic with the camera.  All the chaos IS the action, not the camera itself along with the action on screen.  And it kicks @$$!<br /><br />So I'm going to have to say this is the best Disaster movie I've seen, thanks to the fact it crams everything in, features Emmerich at the helm, and has the technology and CGI to make a great vision of the end of the world.  As far as I'm concerned, it may get dethroned if Stephen Sommers outdoes it with the remake of When World'sCollide (a very similar premise and features multiple disasters), an action director known for non stop action and movies like the Mummy, and GI Joe: Rise of the Cobra.  But until it does, this is my favorite disaster movie.  Those who like disaster movies for the disaster aspect will find a lot to like here.  If not, then well, you can just go away.nks god this movie is two and half hours long (not counting credits).

B00009NHC5|5.0|I discovered that the person who wrote Hitchcock's Dial D for Murder also wrote this story. You can tell because this story takes place in an apartment. I enjoyed this film very much. It is a blind woman who has to deal with three dangerous criminals who are after a doll filled with drugs. Every scene keeps you to the edge of the seat, and its last fifteen minutes or so, are even more enthralling.
0618918248|5.0|I've read the hebrew translation of the \\"God Delusion\\" and instantly became a fan of Richard Dawkins. The writing is excellent ,humorous, convincing and educational, though I must admit that the very last few chapters were a bit boring to me. I was raised as a secular jew in Israel , so I didn't need a lot of convincing , still as a child I had to study the bible from 1st grade and I don't rememeber anyone mentioning it's mostly fiction (and not the interesting kind), so I used to ponder about the existence of god, thinking that he might be monitoring me if he exists, and once again I wasn't even raised religious so I don't want to think about the brainwashing religious children have to go through and the paranoya they must feel. That's why I can totally relate to Dawkins' objection to raising children to a certain faith or religion, though I doubt that deeply religious people will suddenly raise their children as secular atheists or even read this book. We should start the change from our secular society. Ironically, most of the secular people around me believe (or just say they do) in god and have some special respect towards religion. It's probably a combination of tradition and ignorance about religion and other reasons Dawkins had mentioned. It's funny (or sad) and ironic , because even today religion fail to give good answers or make people do helpful things for our society (not even mentioning all the really bad things). It's time to stop giving religion the respect it doesn't deserve and start asking questions, and get it out of matters of state and education. If you want to believe, believe in the privacy of your own mind, home, church, synagogue or whatever.
B002MW50KO|1.0|It is difficult to understand why Dylan elected to records these songs.  I have been a fan of Dylan for many years and am glad to recognize that he is unchallengably one of the greatest, and arguably the greatest song writer of our time.  But why these Christimas songs?  Most of the songs are unremarkable saccharine dittys.  Those who actually like (this) kind of music are extremely unlikely to be Dylan fans; Dylan fans are for the most part likely to be (as I am) merely bewildered by these selections.  I don't believe Dylan intended some sort of sly irony or subtle parody in creating this record.  The only possible explanation I can summon is that Dylan must have intended to come up with something wholly unexpected and atypical--if that is the case, then he has succeeded in evoking novelty if nothing else.
0060531053|5.0|This book was an early gift from my brother and I have not been able to put it down.  It really is an amazing illustrated guide to everything you need to know and do when starting to home brew.  I had only two batches under my belt when I picked this up and the things I have already learned so much.  What is most valuable is he really gives unbiased opinions on options you have (types of sanitizers, how to sanitize, to rack to secondary or not, etc).  A lot of guys on message boards are biased and only want you to see their way or point of view.  This lets you make those decisions for yourself.    Just an awesome book.  If you are even thinking about home brewing dont go on without getting this first.
B002MW50KO|5.0|When I 1st heard about this album, I thought it was a joke.  But if there is any irony here, it is in the context and the contrast to our so-called modern life because there is absolutely none in the performances.    This is the sound of our country before big box stores, on-line flame-fests, sub-prime mortgages, and chemical home run kings.  It sounds like a record your parents or grandparents, now long gone, would put in the stack on the turntable on a Christmas afternoon of tinsel and crumbled wrapping paper.    If your heart is open, you will find tears and smiles in equal measures here.    Dylan has obviously shown greater genius elsewhere but this may be the album you will return to more than any others.  If life his shown you enough for you to know that it is beautiful, but cruelly short, just think how this album will make you feel, and what a gift that will be, 10, 15, 20 years from now
6301978587|5.0|One of the best movies of all time. It hits the mark when it portrays the life of the Jewish people.
B000001ESF|4.0|I have been a Rush fan since 'All The World's A Stage', their breakthrough live album back in '76-77.  That album was basically the 2112 tour.  Sure, they've matured over the years, 35 to be exact.  As for 'nerdy drummers'?  If they play as well as Neil Peart, I should say we need more nerdy drummers in this world!  Very much recommended for a taste of Rush's early, and better, works.  Prog-Rock On, guys!
B002ECJZ76|5.0|The cover claimed this would be the kind of Christmas movie that Walt Disney would have produced, so of course I had my doubts.  But I'm happy to say that such glowing praise was entirely deserved.<br /><br />What you see here is a telling of the story of Santa Claus, from his childhood as an orphan, trying to find his place in the world, to the Santa we all watch for each Christmas season.<br /><br />It is very well-acted, with dubbing in English done so well that I barely noticed it had been dubbed from the original Finnish.  The fact that the movie was made by Finnish filmakers is a clue to how breathtakingly beautiful the scenery is.  You almost feel the chill of the snow-covered villages and Santa's frosty reindeer.  The bonus section of the DVD contains comments by actors and the filmkers that talk of problems they experienced such as temperatures below 30 degrees Celsius and spooked reindeer.<br /><br />Please get this to share with friends and family--it is everything it aspires to be.  I'll be enjoying it every Christmas, and I think you will enjoy it too.
B000K1P66W|4.0|The Book was received in better condition than expected, however, it took longer to arrive than expected as well.
B001152TL6|5.0|ok, one of my favorite movies... spare the plot details.  basiclly THIS is the version to get... the focus features, universal release... the other one (with the blue tint vcover) is the canadian versian.. it is pan and scan... i bought it before, when it was the only option... this one is the way to go... only thing, there are no special features, and no booklet... inland empire has a little insert for lynch coffe...lol, and special features, as does the wild at heart, (i think its a reissue, with a cardboard case) and the second print of blue velvet... hope this helps some,.....another great film/(based off a comic) very similar, is called the maxx, there was a bootleg dvd t hat was made, because there is no dvd release, and the vhs goes for over a hundo.  GREAT STUFF... check it out if you havent already, ... i dont think thatll ever be profesionally released, but still great to have... thoese bootlegs are even hard to find now...<br /><br />\\"theres a man, in back of this place.... hes the one whos doing it!!\\"<br /><br />-matt
B002MRRRAA|5.0|One of the things that struck me eventually, was the fact that here were just three lone wolfs and the sound they managed to make was amazing! Most of the bands I can think of are at least 4, most are 5 person bands. And along came Nirvana with three....and played awesomely ! Not having had the opportunity to ever see the band live, this recording is absolutely fabulous to have. I TRULY HOPE THE NIRVANA CAMP PUTS OUT ONE OF THE IN UTERO CONCERTS at some point because I would surely buy it as well. I assume eventually they will & they should. Contrary to what some people know of Cobain's views, he was a paradox when it came to his success in that he wanted commercial validation, and the money from it, as much as the next guy, but certainly shunned the notoriety associated with it.    At the time of this concert he was at a particularly difficult time in his life concerning his family - his daughter was born just 2 weeks prior and the child was removed from their care because of an article appearing in Vanity Fair painting the couple as unfit parents. I read about the incident in two sources and was struck with an idea of the terrible horror I would feel if someone had taken my child from me at any time, let alone shortly after birth. Irregardless of whether there was enough evidence pointing to the possibility of child endangerment due to drug use, I believe the state agency handling the affair should have considered (and had more compassion) a more humane way of handling the whole matter.    So if anyone was wondering why Cobain looked the way he did in the video (actually not as bad as you would think given the circumstances) yet I could see the strain in the man's face during the performance. He was also in the throes of kicking his unfortunate heroine habit - but still managed to pull out an amazing performance just to prove he wasn't DOA.  The relationship between Novoselic, Grohl & Cobain was also very strained at the time.  To me, this makes this performance all the more stunning in that it amazes me Cobain was able to perform as well as he did, though it was said of him that when it came to the business of Nirvana, Kurt was always on top when he wanted to be.    I am so sorry for his family, bandmates and friends that he did not want to continue what he had started. It seems apparent from written sources that insofar as Cobain was concerned, his own music would have progressed beyond the confines of the music genre he was in because that was what he had expressed an interest in doing. I wish exceedingly he had given himself the opportunity to do so. To Nirvana, one of my favorites, a great performance indeed & I'm very happy it was preserved for a later time.
B0002XEDQM|2.0|Well recorded, but Ray was quite a bit past his prime and his voice is almost painful to listen to.
0596005903|4.0|This books gives you hands on experience with LDD. All that you need is a linux box and latest 2.6 linux kernel with little or no real experience with kernel development. Also I like pointers to linux source code, which gives you chance to browse linux source code without feeling overwhelmed.
0446691437|4.0|The epic battle between resistance and creativity is the topic of this short but powerful book.  Witty, provocative and honest encouragement are given to step out of chosen distractions into a daily life of one's true purpose.  Art doesn't need to wait on inspiration.  The wait is for the artist to come out of hiding amongst the mundane and do what is necessary continually to bring forth work.  This book was recommended to me by another artist who has springboarded into a productive career as a result of the simple ideas presented in this book. I now recommend it to you.
B002QXT7XK|4.0|A very nice preview of the show. It does not represent the show as much as it could, but it doesn't matter cause it's the show you are interested in anyways correct?
0805091742|5.0|I work in a hospital as an intensive care nurse.  We have been working on a multitude of projects to improve patient safety and outcomes.  And in the midst of all the technology and knowledge and training, it is the simple thing--a checklist.  Having a husband who is a private pilot and works for the FAA, I have heard about checklists for years.  This book shows how pilots use checklists to avert disaster and save lives.  It explains how the people who build complex buildings use checklists to plan the construction but also communicate and correct the changes and errors.  And it gives a multitude of examples in medicine to show how checklists work and what happens when they aren't used.  It is a fascinating, quick and easy read.  And it will have you thinking very differently about checklists and safety, whether in the air, a building or a hospital.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|The video is amazing, it takes us to places that most of us will never visit and you believe that are part of the landscape.  The narration is excellent.  It exceeded my expectations.
B000MM1F5A|4.0|I saw this DVD while having lunch in Sitra, Portugal and found it delightful. I ordered it after I returned to the US as a way to relive my vist to Portugal. A better keepsake than a piece of tile.
1579126278|5.0|This is definitely one of my favorite Agatha Christie novels, on the level of Murder on the Orient Express and Death on the Nile.  There's no exotic locale for this novel, but there is Christie's trademark use of red herrings.  There are definitely lots of red herrings, with the usual characters who all have secrets they refuse to divulge, a murder in a closed room, and of course Hercule Poirot.  The ending was definitely very shocking, even though I had guessed who the murderer was about 2/3 of the way through the book.  It left me with chills down my spine and was definitely one that had me thinking about the story for days.  I have to say that modern mystery writers have nothing on Christie.  I use to love reading Mary Higgins Clark's books, and after reading Christie's novel I just cannot bring myself to read Clark and James Patterson's books again.  Agatha Christie is definitely without peers in her ingenious plots and her crisp, yet suspenseful style of writing.  Read this book--you will enjoy it.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I am a 61 year-old man, a child of the 60s.  Nonetheless, I love this CD enough to bother writing this, my first ever Amazon review.    Taylor Swift has an adequate singing voice, but nothing special.  What is very special, however, is the clarity, simplicity, honesty and accuracy of her songwriting.  And although it took me awhile to realize it, the backup musicians on this CD are also very good.    Taylor was only 19 (or was it 18?) when these songs were written.  Her life experience was limited, and so is the scope of what she writes about.  There are one or two too many references to kissing in the rain (it must have been some kiss).  Nonetheless, she sticks to what she knows, and she portrays it very very well.    Last night I surveyed this CD, putting the songs into categories of (1) excellent, (2) very good, (3) OK and (4) not good.  Here's my take:  4 excellent, 8 very good, 1 OK.  I am a tough grader, and I would have to go way back to find another record this good.  Being a bit of a country fan, I would think of Garth Brooks or Rodney Crowell.  Beyond that, maybe a Joni Mitchell or Beatles album.  (Joni was an even bigger talent in my mind -- more poetic, better voice).      Taylor Swift is fresh, genuine, spunky, sincere and a very talented writer.  Do yourself a favor and buy this CD, if you haven't already.
0307454541|5.0|I read this novel thinking that it would be a tame thriller but i was completely wrong. I hope you have a strong stomach. This novel is filled with twists and turns as well as complex characters that are slowly revealed to the reader. Everyone truly does have a secret in this novel. Enjoy!
B002GY9F9K|4.0|If you are a purist for Mr Goodkind's books, don't watch it. Otherwise, for what it is, a good series.  Although \\"Legend of the Seeker\\" roughly follows the \\"Sword of Truth\\" series of books. The plot line deviates from several important points. The charactors, Richard, Kahlan, and Zed are almost as likeable as Terry writes them. However it is impossible to develop those charactors over a couple hours versus 600-700 pages. The actors do a superb job however (well, except for Zed, who is a little over-the-top). Acceptable special effects and fighting choreography, help make this a fun and pleasant series. After my son watched along side of me, he is now reading the series of books. Most importantly however, I will be purchasing Season Two when available.
B001F290E4|5.0|This is , by far, Seal's best album.......I first heard it on a South African Airways flt. to J'burg.....listened to it almost the 17 hour flight!!!
0810970686|5.0|My son loves to read but I have never seen him so focused reading the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series. He absolutely loves the stories, the humors, and the languages. He said he will read them all over again after he finishes the five he had right now.
0393327655|5.0|End of Faith is a refreshingly clear and lucid look at the problems caused by religions that have supernatural beliefs - from middle eastern religions to new age magical thinking. In the chapter \\"Experiments in Consciousness\\" Harris unfolds a deep grock of the old subject object dichotomy and writes about his first person enlightening experiences of meditation. His science is poetry to me!

B002DW92SE|5.0|For years I have told anyone who will listen that Nick Hornby and Michael Chabon are the two best writers working today.  How I waited three months to buy and read this book is beyond me. However it was worth the wait.    In typical Hornby fashion, music and lost souls drive this latest story.  Hornby can pace run of the mill events into a compelling narrative like nobody else.  Just enough quirks in the characters to draw you in, but not so many as to strain credibility or drive you away.    Simply put, I loved this book.
6301066642|4.0|I've always liked this movie, as it is fun and upbeat.  My main purpose for buying it, though, is that it's one of the few places where you can see Johnnie Ray singing.  I absolutely love his voice and am a big fan of his.  Wish he was still around making new music.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Like any nature show, scenes that are both breathtaking and traumatizing can be seen simultaneously.  This show takes that and kicks it up several notches! With 4 years to research and plan, and filmed entirely in HD, the Life crew took amazing risks and were rewarded with footage that soars above all other nature shows.  In some cases, the Life crew captured actions and moments that had never been seen or heard of before. The narration by David Attenborough is perfect.  I'm not looking forward to the US version with a different narrator.. as with all things BBC, their version is far superior.  The show does lean heavily on evolution at times so creationists will have to ignore those statements as the show overall is worth your time and money.  (I skipped episode 6 on Insects, because, well I hate them, and the other shows were so incredible I didn't think I could handle that one.  I'll watch it eventually!)    If you love nature shows, this one is a can't miss.  If you don't love nature shows, watch this one anyway!
B002MBAJ4M|5.0|BY A THREAD is Government Mule's latest CD, and it's excellent. It features a guest spot from ZZ Top guitarist Billy Gibbons on the opener, \\"Broke Down On The Brazos\\", as well as some more smoldering guitar work and vocals from singer-guitarist Warren Haynes. The Cream influence seems streamlined here into more of a Montrose/Mountain-type sound and style; whether this was a conscious effort on the band's part is unclear, since they've always tried to evolve since their formation in 1995. This CD is a must-own for any fan of power-trio rock, Southern rock, and/or jam-band rock.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is a great insight to the beginnings of some of the blues greats. The music is terrific, although more of it would have been better. To see some of these artist perform for possibly the last time, and to hear in their own words how they got started is a rare treat. Wish I had more of this type of album.
0810983915|5.0|I didn't get to read the book, as it was a present for my nephew, but he thinks it is as fantastic as it can be and wants to communicate to the world how much he enjoyed it, and all the others in the series I have bought for him.   Even though he is only seven years old, he would like to take this opportunity to express how angry he is that the World Bankers, who are using our money, after we bailed them out, with our hard-earned taxes, because they misused the money of ours they were supposed to look after in the first place, and now want to pay themselves more of our money as fat bonuses, for continuing to do their job badly and mismanage our money, so that they stay in business to mis-manage our money in the future! And they still refuse to help re-float our economy with responsible lending, and continue to charge us unfairly for their poor service!!!!!!!!!!!
B000006FVE|4.0|Seven Days In May is one of my favorite films.  I found the VHS tape purchased through Amazon to be of excellent, almost new condition.  The price was right and delivery was on time without problems.  If a similar need arises in the future, I would very likely purchase using Amazon.  \\"Seven Days In May,\\" (1964,) is a politcal thriller about an attempted military takeover of the US Government.  It is somewhat dated, but very entertaining nevertheless.  Burt Lancaster and Kirk Douglas, who often worked together are at their very best.                      Roy C Thomas
B002SJIO5E|5.0|This movie was fantastic. My mother, who is not a fan of science fiction at all, thought that is a great movie. If you can make a person that hates sci fi movies love a movie like this then you get my 5 star review
0060254920|5.0|I was very pleased with the quality of the book.  Thick paper, vivid colors.  It's a classic children's book and I'm glad to see it wasn't printed as cheaply as many children's books are today.
0439023491|3.0|I was excited to read this follow-up to the fantastic \\"Hunger Games,\\" but, alas, this book is a little disjointed and awkward, with an annoying cliffhanger ending. Hopefully the next book will make up for this mistep.
B00168OIOE|5.0|You really can not go wrong with any Disney/Pixar film.  They are all so much fun and can make kids and adults both smile with delight. And the best part is, you can still loan this out to a friend that does not have a blu-ray player.  Good thinking, Disney!
B001U887RO|5.0|Love these - they are warm and easy to wash.  Buy them one size larger if you wear thick socks.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I visited Florence, Italy this year which is the home of Pinocchio.  I bought 2 wooden marionettes for my great grandchildren who live in New York.  When I got back home I researched Amazon.com.  I found the original Pinocchio movie with Mel Blanc and purchased it for the children.<br /><br />The children just loved it and can't wait until I visit them to watch the movie with them.  I am anxious to see the movie, because I was a little girl when Pinocchio was so popular.
0385504225|2.0|Oh My God.  Can you say tedious?  I just finished listening to the audio book, yes all 17 1/2 hours of it, and I felt like throwing myself out the nearest window and hoping I would impale myself on an obelisk aka pyramid.  Holy Christ can this guy blow wind.  This should have been a 9 hour book MAX, but it drones on and on and on and on.  I wouldn't listen to this again at gunpoint!      I wonder how many times the words: mystical, mythological, symbol, ancient wisdom, etc appear.  After listening to this I had to do some self-Electroshock Therapy.  I'm now listening to the best of Yma Sumac!  Haha.
B001JRB16U|5.0|Mary Poppins is a treat for the whole family.<br /><br />We have 2 little kids and they love it.<br /><br />The songs are timeless and the themes are just as relevant now as when it was made.<br /><br />The special edition is great.
B002PMV9FG|1.0|I Love the book... hate this movie... poor story, poor everything... The Battle of Hogwarts, one of the most important and epic events in the Harry Potter story, where is in the movie?, nobody knows. And this is just an example...
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|Great edition of the movie! Included everything I wanted to see in theatres. It was longer but I got everything I wanted out of it. If you read the comics you will not be disappointed by this edition of Watchmen. Plenty of extras to keep you entertained.
0783233477|5.0|I found the whole movie very entertaining and also fascinating.  I didn't think it was too long at all.  I don't know where they get this material but some of these writers and directors are incredible.  This is one of the few movies I will buy, wish they had it on blu ray but HD will do.
B001I9O9L8|1.0|I should have paid more attention to the reviews before purchasing this Blu-ray. My synopsis is as follows:    Cons: The disc plays directly from insertion and does not offer a main/start up menu. Horrible video quality which would be barely suitable for VHS, in fact it appears as though this version was created from VHS. As another reviewer wrote, this is from Sting's (very) early and yes an even more pretentious stage in his career. Audio quality is equally horrible.     Pros: I like Sting and I have a fancy, new expensive Sting coaster. I have learned to never buy blu-ray on impulse, without first reading reviews.
B001UREJWM|4.0|If you've enjoyed the work of these 4 guys as individuals or in their respective bands you should like this disk. If you haven't then you won't. Their past styles can be heard all throughout the record.    Highlights are \\"Bible Black\\", \\"Breaking Into Heaven\\", \\"Double The Pain\\" and \\"The Turn Of The Screw\\". I don't care for the intro on \\"Follow The Tears\\" but after that it's a good song.    The title and chorus of the weakest song, \\"Eating The Cannibals\\" is almost laughable and the song sounds like they were doing an Iron Maiden impression, a bad Iron Maiden impression.    \\"Neverwhere\\" sounds like a nod to Judas Priest, intentional or not.    Ronnie's typical but comforting familiar lyrical content is present. \\"Rock And Roll Angel\\" and \\"Neverwhere\\" remind us to believe. \\"Breaking Into Heaven\\", and to some point with \\"The Turn Of The Screw\\" and \\"Follow The Tears\\", Ronnie weaves again what could be construed as political views and statements, you decide.    This is good ole' classic metal at it best.
0195067142|5.0|I read several book about \\"the war\\"; this gave me a different feeling. I read about the Italian Partisans resistance, about concentrations camps, the Russian Campaign, etc. Eugenie Sledge campaigns in Peleliu and Okinawa surpass reality itself.<br />His simple and factual narrative makes you present in the combat and still removed from comprehending. At the same time.<br />Eugene Sledge classic is written in simple unassuming language.<br />The stories are tangible, real, and honest. The un-interfering and corroborating footnotes make the book also reliable as a reference.<br /> The reader must be aware of the back-to-back brutalities, told with simple, unsophisticated, direct language. His genuine innocence is guilt-free. Every \\"unbelievable\\" story is followed by another \\"unbelievable\\" just as intense. Eugene Sledge uncomplicated and gifted writing will easily transports you into the reality of \\"the war\\".
0061719544|5.0|I just recently discovered Craig Ferguson when I stayed up too late one night.  Now I TIVO him every night.  I laugh out loud at least 5 times during every show.  Craig is very up front about his past and the book really adds a dimension to the personality I see on TV.

B001IF252M|5.0|It worked right away.  I reorganized my desk to have the iMac and Sony CRT side by side.  The hook-up was plug and go and I was running in less than 5 minutes. My iMac is a 2009 24\\" model.
0312330537|5.0|I read this book on the recommendation of a friend, who has aboslutely disparate reading preferences. I've read all of Ayn Rand, loved Peter Benchley as a kid, and went through my existential stage, reading Sartre, Camus, Kierkegaard & Nietzsche. I prefer non-fiction these days, 1776 and others around the Revolutionary war being my latest love. So with her love of Harry Potter, I immediately recoiled at her recomendation... but not having a book at the time and quite a bit of travel upcoming, I gave it a shot, and I continue to thank her for it. This book is great. The story is fantastic and artfully written. I'm sure some will pan him for the writing style, but those people should not take themselves so seriously. The book is an absolute joy to read, and impossible to put down. The story is at times heartwarming and heartwrenching, and entertaining throughout. GET THE BOOK! You will definitely not regret it.
B000SXOI66|1.0|I have this great 4-5 star album on vinyl pressed by Mobile Fidelity and the sound quality is simply fantastic!   The sound mix on this MP3 makes my ears bleed.   I paid $1.99 for this today \\"on sale\\" but the MP3 wasn't worth two cents.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Best CD from John Mayer yet! Have always been a fan, but this CD is really, really great!
0780619587|5.0|Since I live in Europe, I was not aware that the dvd that are purchased in the USA are only for widescreen.    So we are not able to watch this dvd on our TV.    Is there a solution?    kind regards,    Rita
B00005JM02|5.0|Nemo is a classic. The imagery is stunning and the lines are memorable. My 2 1/2 year old can watch this all day and I never get tired of it, either. I laugh continuously at the great script and I always discover something new in it. There are different bonus features on both DVDs and they are definitely worth watching as well. Very cute explanations of the reef, etc, bonus cartoons, and virtual aquariums. Awesome movie to keep forever.
0307346617|5.0|A friend from work had this book on his desk and said I should read it.<br /><br />Zombies! No thanks!<br /><br />I've avoided all of the \\"Twilight\\" books and the other undead/monster books. He pitched it by saying it was fictional (of course!) but modeled after the very real work of Studs Terkel, [[ASIN:1565843436 The Good War: An Oral History of World War II]].  For those that don't know, Terkel interviewed hundreds of people about World War II and arranged their interviews into a narrative of sorts that told the history of the war.<br /><br />Well, that wasn't much of a selling point either because I never really got into Studs Terkel very much so this was strike two. But, I took it home and started reading.<br /><br />The first 20-30 pages are boring but they do set up the rest of the book by introducing the concept of zombies, how they came to be, what they are capable of and what stops them. Once we get to the Battle of Yonkers this book hits its stride and really hums along.<br /><br />There are recurring characters but the four that struck me the most were the Japanese gardner and the computer geek, the Chinese submarine and the dog handler. The dog handler struck me as the most \\"human\\" story of the bunch because of the unabashed affection and bond between dog and handler. I was actually moved to tears about this fictional story about a man and his dachshund/beagle mix - partially because I had one and he described its fiesty, independent, love to fight personality to a tee, and partially because they survived.<br /><br />Well, there it is - I went from reluctant reader to nearly crying about what I was reading. That's why I'm giving it 5 stars.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle is truly a joy to listen to. She has an incredible voice, if you want a very soothing music cd, this fits the bill. I would have prefered she save \\"Silent Night\\" for a Christmas cd (hint, hint: Would LOVE a Christmas cd, Susan, if you're listening!) and the only complaint I had is that on \\"How Great Thou Art\\", only the chorus is sung, and repeatedly. The song has several verses, and they were ignored in favor of just singing the chorus. This was the only disappointment I had with the cd.
B000PC0SPU|5.0|This is a great book. Simple language, simple point of view, fresh thoughts on matters of our daily lives and the importance of dimensions some people (like me) often forget.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|As a big fan of the original series, I wasn't sure how I'd react to the new movie. I loved it. Especially liked the Spock / Uhura connection, and the fact that in this universe, James T. Kirk doesn't ALWAYS get the girl. Simon Pegg was just a joy as Scotty, and all the characters were well cast. I wish the cadet that had worries about the transporter would have been Bones, though, that would have tied in so nicely with the old series. Still, all in all, a great new beginning, looking forward to the sequel!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This reboot of the Star Trek movie series is wonderful.  I think I saw it 5 times already.  Amazon's price for this BluRay version can't be beat!
B00168OIOE|5.0|Wow!<br />If you love this movie, the Blu-ray version will add an entirely new layer of incredible to this movie.<br /><br />You'll plotz
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|I often take my 6-year old granddaughter to movies.  This is the first one that I was as totally captivated as she was.  I loved Ed Asner as the old man.  I remember him from the Mary Tyler Moore show and he was perfect in this part.  Ashley liked the dog and loves seeing villains defeated.  So naturally this makes a great Christmas present for her and it will be kept at my house so we can watch it together. ;-)
B00164GDD2|4.0|I love this movie and I guess this is the best it's ever gonna look, the picture quality is a little grainy on some scenes but that is understandable. Looks better than the Superman - The Movie 1978 [Blu-ray transfer] Blu ray can either really bring new life to old titles or expose all the picture quality problem from an old movie. The special features are great, Dan Aykroyd is one smart dude!  One thing about the shipping, the face of the ghost on the special Blu Ray packaging was cracked probably from shipping mishandling. The plastic packaging and the disc itself was unharmed. I recommend this!
B0026P3G12|5.0|This Album was as good and even better than I had expected. It has been my best purchase on CD's in years!! I now want more of her. Her voice is absolutely amazing and she sings effortlessly. What a wonderful talented gifted person Susan Boyle is and I look forward to many more CD's by her.
B000K4X5XA|3.0|Not a huge fan of this transfer, blu ray really exposes the problems with picture quality in a 1978 film release. all in all it's never looked better,defects and all.the extended and new scenes are cool the special features are ok but nothing you haven't seen before (in previous dvd releases of this) the movie is a blast of course. Hands down the best Superman movie ever made and on my top 5 greatest superhero movies ever. Shipping was fast and the item arrived in perfect condition. Good job Amazon!

B0019LY5IM|4.0|I am, like many others, hooked on this series and was really psyched to get this set when it came out. I'd never seen any of the episodes before, and I found the story in season 5 to be interesting enough. However, I found that the sound was screwy. I have a young child who sleeps close to where I watch movies and I have to turn the tv way down so she won't wake up. Sometimes, this works. But mostly, I find that I have to fiddle with the volume on my remote constantly. It is such a pain in the rear to have to constantly dial down and up to keep up with the impossibly quiet moments and the crazy-loud moments. sheesh.    The packaging is different this season than the previous four. Gone is the plastic slipcover and pamphlet inserts, and in place is a sleek case with the episode list written on the back. So much neater and less wasteful.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|Wow! I've only seen this on worn prints or broadcast TV and knew it was great. But this really opens the movie up for me. One of the most entertaining films has gotten the treatment it deserves. Now if they can do the same for Vertigo, I'll be ecstatic.
0201721481|2.0|One of the more ill-organized programming text I have come across so far in 10 years. Poor examples,very few complete codes in the text and confusing explanations. Concepts are presented throughout the text,amazingly this book shall serve neither an experienced programmer or a beginner to C++. Why did Lippman name it a primer??<br /><br />To convince yourself, flip through the pages that deal with the implementation of a vector and string class and you will recognize why this text deserves, at certain places, a \\"1\\" star rating.<br /><br />Some codes even crash your system...certainly not an ideal text to begin C++ and possibly even flirting with the \\"horrible\\", if you are new to programming.
0316010669|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell, adored by the masses and mocked by the academy, has set out to explore human cognition and decision making in his book \\"Blink,\\" despite the fact that he is a historian by training and a journalist by trade. The premise of this book is that we humans have two speeds when it comes to decision making: \\"really fast\\" and \\"regular.\\" We are all familiar with regular- pause and think, employ logic, maybe even write stuff down on paper, and eventually come to a rational conclusion. Really fast, or as Gladwell calls it, blinking or 'thin-slicing', happens in much shorter times, ranging from milliseconds to know if a tennis serve will go awry, to mere minutes to know if a marriage will survive the next 20 years. The ability to accurately use the faster method is discussed by Gladwell, who provides several very entertaining and well-written stories detailing the split-second decisions that can be made, such as telling that a piece of art is a fake by just a quick glimpse, rather than expensive and lengthy laboratory tests. There is also a dark side to this method of decision-making, and in several very entertaining and well-written stories, Gladwell shows how white men turn into evil misogynistic racists when making split-second decisions. Take it or leave it, but Gladwell is an extremely talented and engaging storyteller. There is a lot of redundancy within and across chapters, and I estimate the book could be maybe 100 pages lighter.<br /><br />The individual stories lack scientific rigor, and the book lacks an overall conclusion (what is given is just another story). Yes yes, this book is classified as \\"popular science,\\" but that does not excuse the fact that no attempt is made to construct a cogent and complete argument, including acknowledging competing ideas. The burden of proof is on he who makes the claim- while Gladwell may think he is being \\"deeply intellectual\\" and forcing the message of his book upon the readers by not having a solid conclusion, thus forcing us to blink for ourselves, instead he left the roof off of the house he just built, and I'm clearly not alone in this opinion. Another thing noticeably lacking is advice on how to do the fast thinking for yourself- Gladwell never explicitly says it, but the key it seems, is to study your field for years and years- and by then, you will have built in your brain the equivalent of muscle memory for thought processes, and you will be able to trust your gut a lot more....go figure.<br /><br />I'm ambivalent about recommending this one. This is possibly the worst place to start if you want to learn in depth the science of human thought and decision making, but it is a wonderful place to start if you know nothing on the topic and would like to get a feel for what it is all about. Either way, if you read \\"Blink\\" for entertainment value, you won't be too disappointed (though as I said, the stories do drag on a bit).us forcing us to blink for ourselves, instead he left the roof off of the house he just built, and I'm clearly not alone in this opinion.

0143144766|4.0|My husband and I (who remember the seventies all too well) brought the audio version (12 disks!) along for a road trip of 2400 miles. It was a great choice, and Ron McLarty was a good companion as narrator. Some books make better audio \\"reads\\" than others, I find, but this was well matched to the journey. If not as literary as some of Pynchon's other novels, it is a stem-winding mystery of sorts. Of course, with Pynchon, it's more about what happens along the way, and I'm delighted to see that Amazon has a play list of all those long-forgotten songs.
0618918248|1.0|The whole discussion is flawed by the underlying conviction that rationality is a perfect or the best tool we have to fathom 'reality'. It's not. An excerpt from \\"The Ratio Illusion\\":    \\"For centuries people have tried to prove the existence of God by logical arguments. Using the same instrument - logic - atheistic fun­da­mentalists of today use a line of argu­ments which with religious ardency tries to prove that a holy principle can not exist. This discussion extended from theological and philoso­phical circles into science, where both pensive proponents of the belief that not everything can be explained by collisions of atoms, and rigorous mate­rialists exist.  This discussion is not always scientifically austere. For in­stan­ce, from the weakest parts of the old testimony a fretful little God is constructed - other parts of the bible or other religions are ignored - in order to grind up this God by eloquent lines of glibby arguments (e.g. Dawkins' book). The so-called many-world hypothesis of the big bang, which is used to explain the infinite small chance of the genesis of our universe, in fact is not a scientific theory but pure belief: it is not pos­sible to test the many-world concept nor can this model deliver any prediction - both necessary ingre­dients of any scientific theory.   The alternative hypothesis for the genesis of our universe, an act of creation, is becoming to be considered by a mino­rity of scien­tists who are flabbergasted by the unex­plai­nable precise adjust­ment of all known basic constants of nature including the charge of the electron, the gravi­ta­tional constant, the Planck constant, the cosmolo­gical con­stant, the strong and weak force, and many others.   Yet both groups, deniers and proponents of a holy principle beyond matter, in their assiduousness overlook the mystics. Human beings of both genders and immense saintliness called mystics, over all centuries and cultures, agree in their core teaching without knowing of each other. This is strange and has to be explained by anybody participating in the discussion on genesis and human fate.   Mystics teach us that they acquired the stalwart conviction that a non-personal holy numinous exists, not restricted by space and time, not describable by words other than nega­tions; that the insight into the numinous cannot be reached by sense perception nor logical deduction but only through intuitive, given insight; that the veracity of this insight ex­ceeds sense perceptions by far such that the products of our senses feel unreal compared to the sharp reality of the numinous; that this numinous collects all truth, beauty and goodness we can live to see; that the presence of the numi­nous can be felt anytime within and everywhere in nature; that our deepest core, our soul, is connected with the numi­nous in an unfathomable way but we ignore this con­nec­tion; that the purpose of our lives is to remove the igno­rance; that our allegedly most potent instrument for sear­ching, our ratio, just has to be layed off to start the search because it is not quite active search that is required but passive 'let-find'; that the greatest barrier in finding our­selves is selfishness in all its forms. \\"
B002VECMAY|5.0|George Clooney is NOT a great actor.  Seriously, can you picture him pulling of  Shakespeare or something like the character Daniel Plainview in THERE WILL BE BLOOD?  That's not in him...and based on the roles he selects, is not of interest to him either.  However, George Clooney IS a movie star...and I mean that in the best way.  Like Cary Grant before him, he simply oozes charm, easy, charisma and a self-deprecating sense of humor.  But what makes him so particularly invaluable is that much of the time, his \\"star power\\" makes his on-screen interactions with everyone contain loads of chemistry.  Think about how he and Jennifer Lopez sizzled in OUT OF SIGHT (has she every had similar charisma with any of her co-stars since?).  Or how he was able to make Tilda Swinton seems vaguely passionate in BURN AFTER READING (or how their very different chemistry elevated her to Oscar status in  MICHAEL CLAYTON).  He commands the screen, yet has enough generosity in his performance to elevate others.  An \\"actor\\" like Daniel Day Lewis or Meryl Streep elevates others because they know they need to bring their A-games just to keep up.  Clooney makes actors seem more normal and down-to-earth, and by the same token, charming and vivacious.    It's this quality that makes UP IN THE AIR so successful.  Clooney plays Ryan Bingham, a gun-for-hire whose job is to fly around the country to different companies and fire people.  People he doesn't know and will never see again.  He does it for bosses who are to afraid to do it themselves.  He does it with an offhand charm that shields him totally from the deep emotions of the folks he's letting go.  He disarms and defuses their anger.  He's a master at what he does, and his world-traveling ways apparently perfectly suit his desire to have few real connections with people.  He is a nice guy who is nonetheless totally self-centered...which is what makes him perfect at his work.  He lacks real empathy for others, but to him, it's not  weaknessbut a desirable trait he actively cultivates.  He's trying to become only the 7th traveler to rack up 10 million miles.  He has all the \\"executive\\" level loyalty programs from hotels, car rental agencies, etc.  He never has to stand in line to check in for anything.  His home base is in Omaha, but he's only there 42 days out of the year (and his apartment is the dreariest living space he has...it is very utilitarian).      One day, his comfortable world is rocked a bit, because his firm has hired a go-getter grad student (Anna Kendrick), who has this great idea about firing people via teleconference.  It's more efficient.  Clooney, of course, is appalled...not just because such an endeavor is incredibly impersonal, but because it threatens HIS way of life.  He takes Kendrick on the road with him to show  her the ins-and-outs of firing...hoping, of course, to make her see the error of her ways.  She's a young, very tightly wound young lady...super smart and witty, but also insecure.    Their travels are punctuated by occasional Clooney's occasional liaisons with a fellow world traveler (Vera Farmiga), an age appropriate \\"hook up\\" for Clooney that becomes more and more serious.    The movie is exploring two themes.  It has the tone of a satirical romantic comedy (will Clooney shed his cocooned ways  to embrace a relationship with this woman who is so clearly well-matched for him?).  It also explores the current condition of our economy.  We see lots of people being fired, including REAL people who've been let go.  They are integrated into scenes with Clooney, expressing their recollections of their reactions to their own layoffs.  It's an effective device in some ways, but it also makes the \\"acted\\" sequences, with folks like the marvelous JK Simmons and Zach Galifinakis seem a bit hollow.  Their scenes are scripted and played somewhat for laughs...and seem petty in comparison to the real pain we see.  Ultimately, for me, this commentary, critique or  satire of the current economy (not sure exactly WHICH director Jason Reitman was aiming for) falls short.  There are moments of genuine anguish, which I appreciate...but the statement seems to be:  times are tough and it is scary to be fired.  Not exactly sure if this is revelatory!    On the other hand, I enjoyed every moment of the \\"journey\\" Clooney, Farmiga & Kendricks take.  While there are many moments that on the surface sound as though they'd be very conventional, predictable rom-com clichés...nothing in the film feels forced or wrong.  The three actors have chemistry and charm to burn and they all sizzle on screen.  We just really like spending time in their company.  Farmiga gives her best performance, because she has never seemed to be more easy-going or sexy.  Her character grows from convincingly charmed by Clooney (their first meeting could have been a coy, overly-clever patch of unbelievable dialogue, but is instead executed with convincing panache...they instantly achieve the chemistry that Clive Owen and Julia Roberts only dreamed of in DUPLICITY) to a mature fondness and affection.  Clooney's charm has made it easy for Farmiga to just relax and be \\"herself.\\"  The interactions between Clooney and Kendricks are hilarious and charming as well.  She is able to disarm him in small ways, and he is able to crack her exterior some.  While Clooney dislikes her idea intensely, he never really takes it out on her personally.  Kendricks, even when her character is at her most uptight, is grounded and down to earth and doesn't try to  hard.  The two actors, one a veteran and the other quite new to the screen, interact like they've worked together for  years, and again, I must attribute much of that to Clooney.  He is a master of disarming and charming.    UP IN THE AIR has received lots of Oscar buzz, and I predict many nominations.  The acting is stellar and the script, even with the aforementioned problems, is intelligent, witty and unpredictable even when events are predictable.  I'm a little less effusive about director Reitman...however, I give  him credit for making films with super smart and charming actors and letting them tear into scripts that give adult audiences something to revel in (THANK YOU FOR SMOKING is a brilliant satire and JUNO was simply a high-energy showcase for some truly fine actors).  However, while Reitman excels in writing and in spot-on casting...his visual sense is a bit lacking.  Each location in UP IN THE AIR, whether Omaha, Wisconsin, Las Vegas or Florida feels exactly the same.  The entire movie feels like its taking place in winter...but a winter that has the same lighting in South Florida as in North Wisconsin.  It becomes a bit oppressive, and if it's meant to show that Clooney's life is just one long string of generic, dreary locales...there was no reason for that.  It is competently edited, but nothing special.  Minor quibbles.    So in the end, while I'm not as in love with UP IN THE AIR as, say, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly who named it best of the year...it is a highly entertaining, well-written movie that almost perfectly spotlights all the strengths of George Clooney, the movie star.  Absolutely a movie worth seeing.

B002T9H2LA|2.0|First off, I am not a QT fan. To much un-needed blood and gore in his flicks. I am not a prude, I can hang with Luc Besson's Nikita and Reno as the Cleaner. But I have problems with un-necessary violence in a story. I liked the What If/ Alternate timeline of this movie, and the ending was very satisfying, but I didn't go for Pitts \\"cracker\\" image. As if only some redneck southern dude would want to go over there and kill Nazis. 9/11 should let us all be aware of how intense the urge to kill is. We are all capable of wanting to do it,but why does Aldo have such a hatred? He was more intense that most of the Jews that he recruited. The scaping was stupid by the way, And bringing Apache's in for a guy from Tenn. was real silly. Apaches are around Arizona,and New Mexico. Even Bowie in his day was hanging out in Texas and was more likely to have run into Cherokee's or Kiowa's or such. Luckily he didn't think of the ones who were known to eat parts of the men they killed for their power,else we might have had even gorier scenes to view. Yuck.. I do appreciate what he was trying to do, but the brutality was just to over the top for my taste. I still cringe at violent scenes, I do not consider them as everyday sights, and am horrified at their portrayal, and the fact that so many people are so blase at the sights of blood and mutilation just helps to explain the calm at which most people take sights of real blood and carnage. We wonder why those who choose to kill other people are so calm and usually unrepentant. I think it shows when we glorify Movies like this.
B001TOVZYQ|5.0|What a great movie.  Any martial arts or kung fu fan will need this film in his library.  Highly recommended.  Amazon is a great company to shop with.  Fast shipping and great prices.
1401323820|3.0|Well, the book was okay, but the TV show is better.  It is impossible to read the book without seeing the TV characters.  Who is the author?  They show the actor on the jacket.  Was the book a collaboration of the TV writers?  Somehow I feel like we have been \\"had\\".  Looks like the intention is for the TV show to hype the book, which was just another script.

0393316041|3.0|Feynman is of course one of the greatest physicists and pop science writers of all time, one of the originators of the genre.  This book starts by recounting much of his childhood and early years through anecdotes (3-4 pages long usually, some funny, some not so much) about his relationship to science, starting with his initiation, to the ways he found to make money through it, and so on.  The book continues on with many of these short stories, including his period in the Manhattan Project.<br /><br />Through written in short anecdotes that make it easily readable, I believe this is not Feynman's most interesting book.  I would highly recommend \\"The Pleasure of Finding Things Out\\" as a much more thought provoking book.  In it, Feynman not only tells stories, but also searches for meaning in life and physics and takes the reader along.  In this title, it seems he only recounts stories, trying to be funny but never making the reader reflect deeply.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|I rented this movie because I'm a big sci-fi fan. The special effects are okay, but in no way carry this movie.<br />The main character is almost Monty Phythonish and the whole \\"documentary style\\" is unbelievable to the point of being laughable at times.<br />What's worse is that the whole premise of the movie is ridiculos and it never explains anything about why the aliens came or arrived here, or anything else about them even though they apparently understand English better than the employees at your local McDonalds and we understand them perfectly. I guess Dan Rather wasn't avaiable to do a sit down interview with them.<br />This movie had as much forethought about plot development as a Don Knotts movie.<br />My advice; rent or buy something else; this is 112 minutes of my life I'll never get back!

B002SJIO4A|3.0|\\"District 9\\" is a classic example of a mixed bag: plenty of pluses and plenty of minuses.  On the plus side, it is extremely skillfully made: never dull, often suspenseful, loaded with action and memorable characters.      On the minus side, it is very heavy-handed on a thematic level: If you're even remotely aware of South Africa's history, it will be obvious to you from the very beginning that the storyline is an allegory about apartheid, with the space aliens serving as metaphors for native South Africans.  I can't stand movies that seek to EDUCATE me about subjects I'm already familiar with, even in the realm of science fiction (which is one of the reasons to avoid \\"Avatar\\").  The history-lesson element can serve as an additional and valuable aspect of the viewing experience, but it shouldn't be heavy-handed, front-and-center, and blatantly DISTRACTING.  As a result, I find the second half of the movie to be much more compelling than the first half (the polar opposite of most \\"professional\\" movie critics' reviews, written by people who believe that movies should be sociology lessons first and foremost).    One more thing: Avoid \\"District 9\\" if you are sick and tired of the reality-TV/pseudo-documentary style.  That style dominates the first half of the film and is painfully irritating.

Of course, for Susan Boyle fans, the \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" and \\"I Am Who I Was Born To Be\\" will really touch you.   I am sure lots of people bought this CD out of curiosity or support - I think they will be delighted with the quality of talent and fine production they find here.  Outstanding job, Susan!

This movie not only made me take notice of the beautiful Antonio Banderas, but it captures the craziness of being on tour with a superstar who was/is on top of her game.  Who can say whether this was the \\"true\\" Madonna?  Who cares?  It's fun, entertaining, and a must have for every Madonna fan.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|Even if you already have the Advent Children DVD, this is DEFINITELY worth buying! Technical aspect wise, this is easily the most gorgeous blu-ray I've ever watched to date! I thought Pixar's WALL-E was amazing... this is just WOW! And it's not like the characters were rendered so real that it looks alive.  No, not like that. It's that the layers are so clean that this movie actually looked 3D on my LCD. Easily the best picture quality I've seen with any blu-ray! And sound processing on the original DVD was very impressive with a 5.1 setup. Audio wise, TrueDolby HD on AC Complete was awesome! Smooth transitions panning all around, excellent processing, and the music was actually changed throughout some parts and replaced with more tracks that match the original Final Fantasy VII.    It was a much much more complete version of the movie compared to the original release of FF7: Advent Children. And the ending with Sephiroth was awesome!    Story wise, for any FF fan, it's a must.  Technical aspect wise, this is definitely reference material!

A collection of superb musicians in their own right, they came together to form a band that set new standards in music, and the quality is not lost in their live concerts. There are many of your favourites here, so it well worth listening to, evenif it is just to hear how it sounds outside the studio. You won't be disappointed! This album is absolutely essential to complete your 'YES' collection.

B002AOWXO0|4.0|Exactly. I got this at the same time as She and Him which I would also place in my surprise top 20 of 2009. This brief album grows on you. Pete Yorn is, typically, excellent. The wonderful Scarlett has a much better go at music than her Tom Waits cover album. Don't get me wrong, I love it but this album shows she really can turn a good song into something quite special. Well worth the great price if you think this appeals. And if you haven't got Volume 1 She and Him yet...get it!
1594488843|2.0|This book contains good coverage of a set of now-widely-held ideas about how to reward and motivate employees in semi-structured jobs.<br /><br />Unfortunately, many of the the anecdotes and examples distracted me because they seemed inaccurate, shallow, or both. The operating system framework in the first chapter is enough to make any computer scientist put down the book immediately. Even if you get past that, though, the corporate examples are either trite observations (where did Encarta go wrong? how does 20% time work at Google) or a rehash with no additional insight of early Drucker-era behavioral studies like the candle, box, and tacks experiment. There may have been a lot of work that went into this book, vetting his examples from companies by interviewing people who worked on the projects, participate in 20% time, went through the Zappos orientation, or any of the number examples. Or the book could have been written based on articles on Yahoo and MSN. It's impossible to tell because there is neither anecdotal nor measured data associated with them!<br /><br />Overall, the guidance isn't bad. But you can pick up a wide variety of other books that say the same thing but have some data backing up the statements to help you understand whether they are or aren't appropriate for your team.

1594202249|4.0|Set largely in and around Los Angeles in 1969 and 1970, and told in the form of a psychedelic (as opposed to noir) detective story, plot is far from the point of Thomas Pynchon's novel, \\"Inherent Vice.\\"  The plot is disjointed, but then so were the times during which the story unfolds.  Rather, the novel presents a pastiche of a post-Altamont and Manson-obsessed slice of America, when the hippie culture was quickly self-destructing, shortly to be eclipsed by Watergate, disco and polyester.  Pynchon does a superb job capturing and conveying that milieu through a wide array of distinctive characters who pop in and out of the story, each presenting through their respective mannerisms in speech, conduct, dress and philosophy a unique perspective on the unkept promises of the so-called Age of Aquarius.  The book's title is a legal term referring to a thing that has inextricably in its very nature a covert flaw that renders the thing's deterioration inevitable.  In this novel, the thing in question is the heyday of the American hippie.  As Pynchon was there to witness the fall, his work provides a meaningful vista of a particularly American time and place not so very long ago.
B002FOQXZK|2.0|This album has to be one of the biggest letdowns of the year. I have never listened to an album from beginning to end and been so disappointed. I like \\"soundtrack to my life\\" but generally this album is lacking a lot of substance.  I like the fact that he is different from other \\"rappers\\" but in doing this there is an expectation of tackling important issues in your songs.  In some of his songs he mentions things but never actually talks about them.  So when listening to the whole album you realize that it equates to 15 tracks about nothing.
0385504225|1.0|I've read all of the other Dan Brown books and knew what I was getting into. He writes action fluff with bland characters. The two previous books relating to religion were interesting because they make you set aside whatever assumptions you have about the Catholic church and Christianity and think.    This book is a train wreck and yes, I can explain why.    It's pretty obvious even in the beginning that Mr. Brown spent an enormous amount of time doing research on settings and masonic history and culture. The problem is that Mr. Brown didn't spend anywhere near as much time and effort on a workable story. He took all of his research and jammed into a wholly unbelievable, boring, and creepily stupid story.    Frankly, I couldn't even finish the book. I got to the last 20 pages and just said to myself, \\"Forget it. This is just dumb. I can't have my brain abused like this anymore.\\"    So seriously...I know you may have liked the other books. So I recommend borrowing it from a friend or a library. I'm sure there will be piles of cheap copies at book fairs too. If you only spend a buck, hey, it's good for getting your outdoor fireplace started.    It's not worth the time or effort to read it and it is certainly not worth paying for.

B001GQO50I|1.0|What a shame that the remaining Doors are so greedy as to refuse to come to an agreement with Mr. Peter Abram, who both recorded and owns the master tapes.  Mr. Abram is a highly ethical individual.  I have had the privilege of both seeing the original tapes, and hearing the original recording in Mr. Abram's house. HUGE difference in the sound quality from this CD. Mr. Abram did an incredible job of recording The Doors, especially given the recording equipment available at that time at the Matrix. The only reason I purchased the CD was out of curiosity.  I already knew it wasn't a first generation recording.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I bought this for my daughter, a big fan of Twilight books, movies, etc.  She loves the music.  I like it too, but not as much as she does.
B000067QMD|3.0|I bought these disks to use with my Avent bottles for storing breast milk and later homemade baby food. I've been using them for about two months now, and had to order more. I have had no problems washing my other Advent products in the dishwasher on the delicate setting, but these sealing disks warped after several washes and stained a light orange after one. I have ordered more and will have to hand wash them.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Way better then the regular six axis, also adds a little weight to it so it doesn't feel so cheap. Great controller at a great price.
630218021X|5.0|The critics overlooked this gem. Sometimes surrealistic, more often straightforwardly biographical, the acting was superb and the essence of Tchaikovsky's life and music carefully revealed.
0330485385|5.0|I really liked \\"The Lovely Bones.\\" It is most definitely a difficult subject to write about, but I thought that Sebold did a great job with it. I think what made this book really great for me was how it was written. From the moment you start reading you feel involved with the story. You feel like you're with Susie trying to point her family in the right direction. The book was a really great story about moving on from tragedy, it was dealt with in a realistic manner. The family doesn't just grive all day, nor do they move on immediately. Rather they pretend that they are dealing with it until finally their family implodes from the grief and the unanswered questions. As far as the reviews that it's trippy and jumps around a lot without explanation, I get it. But at the same time I also understand how it works from the story's point of view. Overall I thought this was an excellent book and would recommend it.
1423101472|5.0|This book was a good finish to this series.  Overall I thought the entire series and this book tied together and was a fun way to revisit the mythology that I had studied in school years ago.  I would recommend this for young readers as well as old who are looking for a fun adventure.

B001QXE0OC|5.0|Purchased this for a tween as a present, but listened myself first.     Not a bad CD to listen to in the car.    Plenty of good tracks for background tapping to.     She has a great unique sounding voice, which is good, as some of the songs are very generic pop.  Best song by far is \\"I Wont Appologise\\".    Overall a good buy.
B002RSDW80|5.0|I just adored this movie.  The acting was soooo good, I could almost smell the food they were cooking.  Amy Adams was perfect for the part and Meryl Streep couldn't be better.  I've loved most all Meryl Streep films anyway, but this one will be right at the top of my list. I really enjoy \\"feel good\\" movies, so much better than flying human like cartoons, spy movies and fast cars, so this one really made me feel good.  I do watch and enjoy some of the chefs on Food TV, though I must say some of them are awful.  In this film, I felt like I was right there in Julia's and Julie's kitchens and wished I could sit down to dinner.   The comments made about the politics in the film, were obviously made in ignorance or by right wing Repub. who were not adults during the early 50's.  Those of us who lived during that era can't help remembering how frightening and wicked Sen. McCarthy was.  In a speech delivered in Green Bay, Eisenhower declared that he disagreed with McCarthy's methods. Today the term McCarthyism is used more generally to describe demagogic, reckless, and unsubstantiated accusations, as well as public attacks on the character or patriotism of political opponents. I'm glad they included it. Her husband was a part of the film and helped with the book while he was in the government at that time and after he retired.  Julia had also been part of the government during the war years.  It was right to include it. Perhaps those critical of the inclusion of the politics would have preferred merely a cooking film, but you can see those on TV all day long and most have not written a book that changed the way Americans eat.

1594133379|4.0|This is a very well written book to help everyone understand better what a stroke victim feels and how they want to be treated both physically and emotionally.There is quite a bit of medical information that is hard for the ordinary reader to understand but its worth struggling through.  I think everyone working in hospitals, care centers, nursing homes and families of stroke victims should read this.
0786868724|5.0|Have A Little Faith by Mitch Albom  THE ENTERTAINMENT CRITIC BOOK REVIEW, BY JAMES MYERS  [...]    HAVE A LITTLE FAITH: A TRUE STORY   By Mitch Albom  Published by: Hyperion  Publication Date: September, 2009  Price: $23.99  254 Pages  ISBN-13: 978-0-7868-6872-8  Four Star Rating ****    \\"Will you do my eulogy?\\"  I don't understand, I said.  \\"My eulogy?\\"  The old man asked again.  \\"When I'm gone.\\"  His eyes blinked from behind his glasses.  His neatly trimmed beard was grey, and he stood slightly stooped.  \\"Are you dying?\\" I asked.  \\"Not yet.\\" He said, grinning.  Then why-  \\"Because I think you would be a good choice.  And I think when the time comes, you will know what to say.\\"  Picture the most pious man you know.  Your priest.  Your pastor.  You rabbi.  Your imam.  Now picture him tapping you on the shoulder and asking you to say good-bye to the world on his behalf.  Picture the man who sends people off to heaven, asking you for his send-off to heaven.  \\"So?\\"  he said.  Would you be comfortable with that?\\"    ________    \\"In the beginning, there was another question.  \\"Will you save me Jesus?\\"  The man was holding a shotgun.  He hid behind trash cans in front of a Brooklyn row house.  It was late at night.  His wife and baby daughter were crying.  He watched for cars coming down his block, certain the next set of headlights would be his killers.  \\"Will you save me, Jesus?  He asked, trembling.  \\"If I promise to give myself to you, will you save me tonight?\\"  Picture the most pious man you know.  Your priest.  Your pastor.  You rabbi.  Your imam.  Now picture him in dirty clothes, a shotgun in his hand, begging for salvation from behind a set of trash cans.  Picture the man who sends people off to heaven, begging not to be sent to hell.  \\"Please, Lord, \\"he whispered. \\"If I promise. . .\\"'  Have a Little Faith, pp. 1-2.         Mitch Albom writes emotionally powerful little books that always leave you wanting to read more.  A sportswriter from Detroit, Michigan, hisheart tugging books are a surprise to those of us who have read his cold, calculating sports articles or seen his razor sharp analysis of sporting events on ESPN.  The author of For One More Day, The Five People You Meet in Heaven, Fab Five and Bo, he is best known for his masterpiece in human studies and the philosophy of death with his book, Tuesdays With Morrie.  Tuesdays is thought to be his best work; well it was until this recent best selling true story was published, Have a Little Faith.  By far and away this is the most fascinating prose that Albom has penned; a pure page turning joy from the first page to the last page.  He covers the stories of two uniquely religious men; Albert Lewis, his old Jewish Rabbi and Henry Covington, a Detroit Evangelist, who is a convict gone good.  The two story lines are separate but as Albom points out there are parallels in the nature of belief and the sacrifices these men make in serving their flocks.    Lewis is a Rabbi that is a master performer on Sundays; a man who can deliver a message with gusto; a happy, well-adjusted man who while Albom was a child, was the dominant figure in his synagogue. He has requested that Mitch write his eulogy and in return the two agree that meetings and discussions will be necessary.  Albom's meetings turn into masterful insights into the psyche of a deeply spiritual, singing, well-adjusted man who has moved seamlessly into the background of his group without loosing his kind and gentle nature.  Beyond a writing assignment, a friendship develops, and fortunately for us as readers a deep vision into the soul of a man who at one time was asked to leave the seminary, but became a visionary due to his ability to communicate and make a difference.  This affectionate tale of his unique ability to communicate, accept, and by his father like faith, overcome obstacles, and ultimately reinforce the faith of his congregation is a moving, inspirational tale.  Albom's book is a true tribute to man whoas Albom says makes you feel like you are \\"in love with hope.\\" Albom's ability to probe the human condition and find answers like with Morrie are razor-sharp here: \\"I laughed and he laughed, and he bounced his palms on his thighs and our noise filled the house.  And I think, at that moment, we could have been anywhere, anybody, any culture, any faith- a teacher and a student exploring what life is all about and delighting in the discovery.\\"      A book about Lewis alone would have cemented Albom's reputation as a great psychological writer; a book that contrasts religious leaders and emphasizes the tremendous faith they have in their interactions with others makes Little Faith a truly remarkable book.  Covington, on the other hand took a radically different path to becoming a religious leader.  A drug dealer and substance abuser, his initial conversion came while he was in prison.  His prayers to be `saved' are answered on several occasions in this book before it finally takes.  His conversion is a sufficiently interesting saga in itself; his ministry is the stuff that Albom turns into magic.  He runs a church in downtown Detroit, called the I Am My Brother's Keeper Ministry.  His flock is a group of homeless people and his church is an old dilapidated building, with no heat or lights and a huge whole in the roof.  Nonetheless, Henry continues to minister to his group of converts.  Albom does what any good investigative reporter does; he checks this guy and his group out.  Persuaded that they are legit, he begins to write about Henry and his group, the old church and the hole in the roof, the blue tarp covering the hole.  Albom's writing leads to donations and the book makes a point of telling us the effect that this has on this group of people.  This seems to be an outgrowth of Albom's experience with his beloved Reb, the gift of teaching and motivating people to act and do the right thing.    This is a great book and a natural Christmas gift.  Albom's continual exploration into the human condition and the positive results he gets are a testament to his first rate skills as a writer.  If this book does not move you, check your pulse; you may be dead. I love Mitch's books.  Better pick up two at the store:  one to give as a gift, and one for you.  Whoever you buy this book for is not going to lend it back to you to read.        [...]
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|Soo many good songs on this.  Dont like much country sounding music, but she has somewhat crossed a gap between music types and made one for herself.    Too many good songs to pick a favourite.   But High marks for  The Best Day,  Fifteen, and The way i loved you.  All seem quite personal.    Gota say the platinum edition has the DVD disc, with the \\"Thug Story\\" clip from youtube.   Great mock vid with TPain.  Very funny.    Definate Buy for the collection.  Cant recommend it enough....

B002LK3DUQ|5.0|WHAT A DELIGHTFUL MOVIE! ONE FOR THE ENTIRE FAMILY TO ENJOY! DISNEY HAS DONE IT AGAIN! I LOVE THESE DISNEY AND PIXAR FILMS THEY ARE BRILLIANT! ENJOY UP! IT IS A MUST HAVE!
B002LE8EFQ|5.0|I have read most of the reviews here that are rated less than 4 stars, only about 17.5%. Among these, most of the comments are about some of the choices made by the producers. I am over 60 and can remember the old days when all we had was a bass dial and a treble dial to adjust the tone of our music. Today, with an equalizer provided with most sound software and amplifiers, you can almost reproduce a song or CD to your own liking. I set my equalizer to hear Susan Boyle's voice strong and clear.    The second most frequent comment is a desire for some quick tempo selections on the CD. My favorite music has always been from the rock and roll period of the 1960's and 1970's, so I appreciate quick tempo music. Sometimes, I want to hear music that makes me want to jump up and dance, even though I am a wheelchair bound veteran.    But, whatever musical sounds we let in our ears; melodies, harmonies, voices and instruments, all have an effect in our minds. Certain sounds are very pleasurable to each of us individually. For me, the power and clarity in Susan Boyle's voice and her personal delivery transcends tempo. It's an astonishing sound.    There are irresistible and amazing aspects to Susan Boyle's CD. Of all the sounds collaborating to make music on her CD, her voice is the greatest instrument by an incredible margin. That pleasing sound in her singing voice has been instantly recognized by millions of people from all ages and backgrounds, all around the world.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|When I heard about this animated tv series was coming out, I was expecting that it was not going to live up to the Star Wars movies.  When I decided to give them a shot, I ordered the entire first season from Amazon at a decent price. I was surprised to see how much action these short episodes have and how interesting they are! They are great! Now I can't wait for the next season to come out! Give them a shot you might just like them.
B002LK3DUQ|5.0|I got this movie as a cccChristmas gift for my granddaughter. I used 2 daay free shipping, and received it 2 days later. Can't do better than that!
067182449X|5.0|My mother gave me this book for my 11th birthday.  I remember being very moved by this young girl's story of living in hiding from the Nazis.  My granddaughter is now 11 and I wanted her to experience Anne Frank's story of courage and hope in the worst of circumstances.
B000J103WK|5.0|This DVD is awesome. I watched it at my brother-in-law's house and I had to have it. The Eagles rock in this DVD. You will not be disappointed!!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|The movie starts slow, and for me, I wasn't expecting the sort of documentary spin of it, and honestly was a bit put out by it... and it does have its irratating moments where you just want the character(s) to do the right thing, and they don't. They show the traits in humans: selfish-ness, greed, hatred, carelessness, shallowness, etc that I wish we didn't have... so a few times I got mad at the movie for having the main character show his weakness at an important moment.     While the main character wasn't the most lovable, I can understand his point of view, and why he went to extremes trying to get his perfect life back with his beautiful home, beautiful wife, friends, family and successful job. He had everything we as people grow up wanting. With the accident that changed it all, he was even more desperate to get his life back above even other's and their lives. Even others that showed him kindness. Thats irksome.      It also had some grisly images of butchered animals, and other bloody carnage...     But all in all, I really enjoyed the movie and at the end liked it a lot (especially as finally the movie gave me hope in humanity and people) ... it was different, it wasn't overly glorified... i felt the main character was a little stiff at the beginning, but towards the end did a great job acting. I really liked the lead alien and his personality, his quiet struggle to save himself, his son, and his people.     Worth the watch, just have to get past the first 30 minutes..

B00006J3WH|5.0|I searched all over for this soundtrack and I was so excited when I finally found it. Not only does it have the music from Whedon's Buffy musical but it has the music from the episodes \\"Restless\\" and \\"Hush\\"!
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is a quirky movie, set about seven hundred years in the future. Humans have become fat pigs who have robots do everything for them. This movie is actually quite insightful, and it almost gives a warning to everyone who watches it to not waste your life. Of course the little robot Wall-e has to come and save the day. There are a few punchlines and physical comedy as with the previous Pixar movies, but not as many. There is not a lot of \\"dialogue\\", so to speak, at the beginning, because Wall-e is the only halfway \\"living\\" thing left on earth. I won't spoil the story for you, but I will just say if you like Monsters, Inc. you will probably like this.
B002UXRH10|5.0|Some songs are quite depressing but then it makes you relate to what a young girl is going through.  My favorite are the fast songs and the tough girl image songs.  Rihanna is finally liberated and able to say and do what she feels on this albulm without playing the part her label and producers want her to. I enjoy the REAL Riri and love this cd!
B000BMSTW8|4.0|The music on this CD/DVD is Spectacular!  Michael is very funny in his commentary.  The CD/DVD case is definitely defective.  The CD/DVD fall out, because the circle thing doesn't hold the CD/DVD  in place.  That doesn't take away from the Great music.
B000Q7ZND6|4.0|i like the movie excellent quality video an audio. I like the latin spanish audio.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|The remastered music is much better than the original cds. The new cds are worth the price in my estimation.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|The original King Kong is one of the all-time masterpieces of cinema.  It would be on my list of the best 5 movies of all time.  It took special effects into a whole new galaxy in 1933 and raised the bar for all subsequent movies.  Many of the special effect concepts in the movie have been copied over and over by less original and less creative film makers.  The black and white format fits the tone of the movie well.  It would not have the same impact in color.  The acting is good, and Fay Wray's performance is exceptional.  I like to see this movie about every two years.  All subsequent versions of King Kong were disastrous insults to the original version.  It brings a tear to my eye when I see Gone With the Wind and watch that big timber gate from Kong's Island burned to the ground to mimic Atlanta burning in the Civil War.  That gate should have been left standing forever.  It was the cinematic counterpart of a national monument.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|If you go into this movie with realistic expectations you should not be dissappointed.  The plot is pretty simple and very easy to follow.  The actors are very good, Angela Jolie shows in this movie that she likes taking on roles that give her chance to do something besides be eye-candy.  Morgan Freeman plays a role you don't see him play very often, and the supporting cast is good(Common is excellent).<br /><br />The action is great, the idea of curving a bullet is cool.<br /><br />BUT<br /><br />I couldn't help but think through the whole movie, \\"this kind of movie has been done so many times, I'm bored with it.\\"  You can take the F/X from this movie and you won't see anything that hasn't been done and in some cases done better in the last several years.  I guess I'm saying all this is, is recycled action movie, which if that's what you're looking for you'll like.  BUT if you're searching for something that you won't forget any time soon pass on this movie.
B001U7FWM8|5.0|As a long time Grizzly Bear fan, I never saw it coming, but Grizzly Bear is rock and roll.  What started out as self-recorded super-personal musings in Edward Droste's bedroom (Horn of Plenty) is still that, but much more too.  Veckatimest takes you on a journey through a myriad of emotions--from frenzied lust to introspection to sarcasm and genuine love.      There are very few things I love more than listening to Southern Point at the highest volume in my car.  The nervous anticipation of the guitar throughout the beginning of the song that releases most completely around the 3:41 point is, to me, the essence of adolescent ecstasy.  It's a perfect point of entry for the uber-poppy Two Weeks--it's got a backbeat you can't lose it!    The album dips into All We Ask and Fine For Now, both melancholic, but differently so.  All We Ask seems almost melodramatic at times, but isn't self-indulgent as much as the perfect indulgence for a little solo-self-introspection.  It's also one of the first times on the album we hear Grizzly Bear's new penchant for balancing lead vocals between Droste and Rossen verse to verse--a new habit on Veckatimest that I think is one of the greatest markers of the band's maturation and evolution.  Yellow House was so full of a wall of sound that it almost sounded afraid--with all the strong vocalists in the band why sing all at the same time, all the time?  Lucky for us Veck gives the boys a chance to solo a little, which only makes their beautiful harmonies all the sweeter--as in the intro to Fine For Now--which is indescribable except for its adultness, or wisdom, which is expressed through wistful lyrics and a sort of a dreamy soundscape punctuated by grating guitar strumming and tempo changes.    As pleasurable as it is for me to ruminate on the album song by song I don't think it the most effective.  A few last thoughts: don't miss Ready, Able--anticipatory in the vein of Southern Point but with a different resolution.  While You Wait ForThe Others is an instant classic in the cannon of tell-off songs.  If you want to get far-out listen to I Live With You (the triumph vis a vis recording/engineering on Veck) and finally, I said genuine love didn't I?  Foreground, the perfect conclusion to the experience.      Prediction: Grizzly Bear will bring us this generation's White Album next.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Really enjoy listening to Susan Boyle's I Dreamed a Dream Album.  Looking forward to more albums from Susan.    Her voice is outstanding and definetly worth listening to
B002I9Z89Y|5.0|After buying the seasons 1-3 on dvd a lot of the extra content is very much the same however the big time winner for the bluray release is the \\"tastefuly\\" done special effects (thank god no star wars jabba mistakes) and also you can elect watch every episode with the original effects for any purests fans.    The next best thing is the wonder video transfer done , its probably the best overall transfer I've ever seen and a true benchmark for bluray technology. Another huge positive mark is the DTS-HDMA 7.1 soundtrack , crystel clear and wonderful however due to series being recorded in mono its nearly all coming out the center channel.    In final this the best season of star trek shown in the best format for one of the most classical series in TV history, if you even remotely are a fan pick this up without question.
B00004WKII|1.0|I really do not like the idea behind this box. I wasted my money, don't you..
B002PQ7JQK|4.0|Received this item today (ordered it yesterday... thanks Amazon Prime!) and it is quite amazing!  Watch any episode, and you can see the amount of work that went into restoring these!  Kudos to CBS and Paramount.  The price for the 3 season set was actually LESS (on 12/22/2009) than purchasing each season individually by almost 15 dollars. Great value at the current price of about $170
B0018RWMNM|4.0|This review is for the Blue Ray transfer.  In general the picture quality is passible to good comparing to a DVD.  It is certainly not up to the Blue Ray standard.  The problem is with the evening scenes.  The picture quality is poor and full of snowy artifacts all over the screen worse than a poor quality DVD. It can be distracting at times.  Fortunately most of the evening scenes are short.  It is a disappointment.  However; I would still buy the disc for the movie.  It is a great captivating mini-series.  The movie deserves a 5 star rating.  The 3 1/2 - 4 star rating is for the disk.
B001HN69AO|5.0|What hurdles has Terry Gilliam had to hop during his long and remarkable career? One has but to watch \\"Lost in La Mancha\\" to catch a glimpse. Then Heath Ledger croaks while this one is well into production. Not to worry, a crew of notables headed up by the thrilling Johnny Depp make a brilliant patchwork quilt of the role Heath was initially to play solo. Certainly would've been a shame to lose the last performance of such a talent on the cutting room floor.<br /><br />Having supposedly been \\"released\\" on Christmas day of '09, I was all primed and ready to rush out and catch this one at the theater, however, I can find no showtimes for it anywhere in the U.S. much less my own area. You can't possibly tell me that this film couldn't make money! Sheesh, market it as \\"The Last Performance of Heath Ledger\\" or \\"A Johnny Depp Film\\" if you must, there ARE plenty of people out there longing to have more cinematic options than all that glitzy, chintz mediocrity they continuously flood the theater complexes with. Alas, Dr. Parnassus seems to have met the same fate of many recent films which attempt to supercede the limitations of standard mainstream fare-- the money brokers/film distributors won't release them to the \\"general public\\"! Well, I for one, feel more than a bit cheated, much as I was when I couldn't find any listings for the much-heralded film, \\"The Road\\" starring Viggio Mortensen that was supposedly \\"released Thanksgiving Day. It's not as if such a film couldn't make money, all you'd have to do is market it as a film featuring blood-thirsty cannibals in a post-apocalyptic setting and people would come out in droves, am I right? I mean, how many people came out to see 2012 just on the premise that it would show the destruction of this modern-day, nightmare world?<br /><br /> So what are the REAL motives for keeping such films locked away from our prying eyes? Anyone with keener insight into the methods and rationale employed in this matter, feel free to leave me a comment.<br /><br /> I have heard rumors that Gilliam is now ready to once again embark on his Quiote epic. Could this really be true? I will keep my fingers and toes crossed.have heard rumors that Gilliam is now ready to once again embark on his Quiote epic. Could this really be true?

B002VPE1AM|5.0|James Cameron has possibly given movies a new life where 2D movies just do not compare to a 3D visual sensory extravaganza. Going to a theater once again feels worthwhile. This movie is possibly the closest you could get to experiencing what life could possibly be on another planet. I was constantly amazed at the little details like a shrinking plant, a lizard with a parachute thing, bio-connection with other lifeforms and so many other little things within the movie.    The story was not too unique and from a sci-fi perspective, there are better stories out there (Enders Game for example). But what this movie has done is to create a benchmark for a new genre of 3D computer generated movies. The benchmark being both in detail and production quality.    This is possibly the first time I have seen a movie where despite a lukewarm story, I still was 100% focused on the movie and left the theater with the feeling of having experienced a new civilization. It took me some time to digest all that I saw within this movie and I may do another trek to the theater to look at the finer details in the forests once more.    There is a strong eco-friendly and anti-war message throughout the movie with the good and bad guys clearly defined. This one is a monumental work and definitely worth watching.
B0011UBDTK|5.0|I purchased this set and when I received it, I found that all the discs skipped and there were even whole episodes that wouldn't play.  The set was supposed to be new, so this was frustrating.  As soon as I contacted the seller, they responded immediately and told me they'd be happy to replace the product.  So, I sent it back.  Within about two weeks, they processed my return and sent me a new set.  They also refunded me what I paid to ship it back, which is something no one does.  This seller was quick to resolve errors and was concerned with my satisfaction.  I would definitely purchase from this seller again.
B001GJ3VYG|5.0|Dido's safe trip home is solid departure from her earlier two albums.  Safe Trip Home's tracks are simple yet masterful.  She uses her voice and very few instruments on each track which results in an incredible sound.  Highly recommended.

B0011Z32KI|5.0|\\"It's Time\\" is my third Michael Buble CD and I will eventually buy all of them.  He is the most exciting male singer in years.  He's unbelievably sexy in his interpretations.  I got turned on to him by Glenn Beck, who suggested buying his latest \\"Crazy Love.\\"  Since I am such a fan of Beck's I took his suggestion and am very happy I did.  He's been on Glenn Beck's show a couple of times and he comes across as a very likable guy.

B002QB1910|5.0|I have to say I have been a fan of Rihanna for a few years now and I am so proud of her. This is her best album thus far in her short career. I love all the songs. I can listen to every single song without skipping any. I am proud that she co-wrote 9 of the 13 songs and was also an executive producer on this album. I can see why it has gotten all those really good reviews from musical critics. I highly recommend this album.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|If you enjoyed \\"Dances With Wolves\\" (sans Tatonka) and you appreciate the best computer generated special effects available today, then you'll love \\"Avatar.\\"  It really is fun.<br /><br />I won't take any points off for the story.  It's a good one, but it's a common one which goes something like this:  Explorers from far away arrive in a new world and the explorers want something.  However, there is a problem in the form of an indigenous population.  One very special individual among the explorers who is both brave and open-minded is chosen to make contact with the natives.  He meets a female member of the tribe and her fatherwho happens to be the chief directs her to learn as much as she can from the stranger.  The explorer and the girl fall in love as they learn from one another.  In the meantime, the rest of the explorers get impatient.  They want what they came for so they initiate a fight.  At first, the interlopers seem like they'll destroy the natives without a problem.  Then, that one brave man does the right thing and turns back his own, albeit misguided, small-minded people.  In the end, he decides to stay behind with his woman.<br /><br />Sound familiar?  It is.  The first part of the story is Disney's \\"Pocahontas\\" or more recently, \\"The New World\\" which featured Q'Orianka Kilcher.  The second part of the story is \\"Dances With Wolves.\\"  That's okay, because those are good stories and I really didn't mind seeing them again.  In this case, the natives are computer generated images; the role of John Smith/John Dunbar is played by Sam Worthington as Jake Sully.  Pocahontas/Stands With Fist is the voice of Zoe Soldana (who I really like) as Neytiri.  The protagonist, the leader of the explorers is Stephen Lang who plays Marine Colonel Miles Quaritch.  Sigourney Weaver even has a role as the hard-nosed but understanding scientist.  Weaver adds to an \\"Alien\\" feel to the project.  Instead of North America, the new world is actually a new world.  It's called Pandora.  Instead of Indians, the native people are called the Na'vi.  The difference between the older versions and \\"Avatar,\\" aside from the actors, is the special effects which are extraordinary.<br /><br />Think of the film that has the best special effects you've seen.  Was it one of the recent \\"Star Wars\\" films?  \\"Up?\\"  \\"Walking With Dinosaurs?\\"  Whatever it is, \\"Avatar\\" is at least half again as good as that.  The images of the Na'vi are extremely realistic.  The fauna are dinosauresqe and relatively credible in terms of anthropology and evolution.  (I wouldn't be surprised if scientists in those fields were enlisted for consults.)  The landscapes are breathtaking.<br /><br />The effects will not disappoint.<br /><br />Getting back to the story, like \\"Pocahontas\\" and \\"Dances With Wolves,\\" there is an underlying political message which I believe most movie-goers won't mind.  Some may.  It comes down to the European Caucasian imperialists are ruining the planet; there is a reference made by Worthington's character, Jake Sully, that the humans had already destroyed their planet and would do the same thing on Pandora if the Na'vi did not repel them.  Fine.  So, for reactionary viewer, you may have to bite your tongue a little.  Frankly, get over it if only to enjoy the film.  It's ground-breaking.Indians, the native people are called the Na'vi.

B000JQUKKU|5.0|As Scrooge says as he wakes Christmas morning and walks through the streets-- WON-DER-FUL! This is my feeling on A Christmas Carol. This was my first experience with Dickens and after reading this-- sure won't be my last. I was expecting a stuffy old novel and got blind-sided by a brilliant work of fiction. I have to thank Amazon for these freebies on kindle, probably would have never got around to reading it. To all you out there who are familiar with the classic tale from movies will be pleasantly surprised to find it WAY better to read. I look forward to more Dickens in the future!
B0028RXXE8|5.0|If you thought drive-by shootings and gang warfare in our poor neighborhoods were restricted to our time, you should view the episodes of what happened in \\"the good old days\\" in the Aventine section of ancient Rome. Those street \\"killings\\" were elevated in vocabulary to \\"assassination\\" as Julius Caesar's peers stabbed him 27 times, not in that underclass neighborhood, but on the very floor of the senate.  Finally, the public has a production which shows much of what I learned in my Greek/Latin and ancient history classes.  The political infighting and international intrigues of our time have their origins in our basically Roman culture (with a Judeo-Christian undertone).  The men, women AND even the children (the elder Vorena) concoct schemes to their advantage; how else could a person survive?<br /><br />I enjoyed the entire series, especially the standout buddy duo of Vorenus and Pullo (Kevin McKidd and Ray Stevenson).  I'm certain many of us have good friends who serve as a guide to clarity or act out behavior we are reluctant to express.  With opposite personalities of straight man/clown, sacred/profane, stoic/earthy, rigid/common sense, they provided the necessary relief to some of the sordid happenings.<br /><br />The set is well packaged as if reading a single book containing the discs of both seasons.  In addition to the pictures, cast lists and commentaries, the interactive CD-Roms are invaluable for more information for the inquisitive and ancient history enthusiasts like myself.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I had been doing my own workouts 4-5 times per week before I purchased Jillian Michaels' 30 Day Shred at the recommendation of a fellow sorority sister (who is also getting married soon!). I also have been a fan of Billy Blanks' Tae Bo workouts, but I had reached a plateau and was no longer seeing any changes.    Immediately after the first 2 days of Level 1 workouts, I felt sore all over... in a good way. I found it hard to stay motivated with my previous workouts, but so far I'm 20 days into the 30 Day Shred and just finished my 2nd day of Level 3.    The 20 minute workouts are easy to do every day... you can do them in the morning or the afternoon. The great thing about the workout is that it's built around someone with a busy schedule.    After a week and a half, I saw toning in areas that Tae Bo never touched... and the best thing is that I dropped a pant size. I am excited to see what happens when I finish the 30 Day Shred challenge. :)    *** You do need some hand weights (I am working with 3 lb hand weights) and a mat if you're working on a hard surface.

B000E41MS6|4.0|After over ten years of being off the air, Doctor Who returned to BBC TV and to the rest of the world's TVs.  Doctor Who first came on the air in 1963!  The new series starting with Christopher Eccleston as the time and space traveling \\"Doctor,\\" and Billie Piper as \\"Rose Tyler,\\" is labeled as \\"The Complete First Series,\\" but here we are refering to the New Series not the Original Series.  The Doctor's oldest enemy the Daleks return.  \\"Captain Jack Harkness\\" (John Barrowman) appears in several episodes before having his own spin-off program, Torchwood.  \\"Rose\\" becomes over two \\"Doctors\\" one of the best companions ever.  The new series, now in its fourth complete seasons is darker, more dramatic, and less campy, yet can still be humorous.  The special effects are better and on par with feature films.  After the flashy and outrageous clothing of the Doctor as played by Tom Baker, Peter Davidson, and Colin Baker, Eccleston is more Earth bound looking.  It is funny, but I seriously think Eccleston looks like a submarine captain.  This \\"first\\" season was a great restart to the overall Doctor Who world, but the stories get deeper and better with each new season.  In the UK Doctor Who is probably more popular than Star Trek was in the US.  Doctor Who may be seen in the US on the \\"cable channel\\" BBC America.  An internet search will yield tons of information about Doctor Who.
B002KSPKRS|3.0|The X41 by far has the best sound out of any wireless headset.  The only problem I have is that the headphone microphone jack that connects to the controller is poorly manufactured and causes the wire to fall out/ disconnect easliy.  It really is annoying at times and is the only shortfall of this otherwise perfect controller.
B001KVZ6FW|2.0|I can't believe people actually liked it. The first 10 minutes of the movie will make your kids get up and go somewhere else to do something more entertaining like watching grass grow. The rest of the movie slowly gets better, and by the halfway mark to the end its a decent movie. If your kids make it past the 10 minutes they may enjoy the movie. Don't ever expect them to watch it twice however. I sure know I won't.

Were we really all that vain and all that vapid? Was our rhythm so challenged, our sex so silly, our highs so exaggerated?) But back to the engaging mystery. Let's return to the park. . .to the corpse. . .No, the film makers say, let's drop that for the nearby spectacle of a group of white-faced mimes watching a pretend game of tennis between two of their troupe. Oh, what a silly shame.

Although aimed at the \\"young adult\\" audience, the lessons extracted from this book are applicable to anyone.

B0017HMF6W|4.0|If you are reading this you already know North by Northwest is a great film and have likely seen it many times. If that is not the case, I envy you since you are in for a first-time treat. If you have a blu ray player stop reading this and just buy it!! Most people reading this are looking for information on how good it looks on blu-ray so I'll skip the plot synopsis and further accolades for the movie itself.<br /><br />The transfer is far better than any I have seen for this movie. I have seen it before on Laserdisc (both the old diamond stylus and the \\"modern\\" Laserdisc from the 1990s) as well as DVD and I always felt that the colors were muddy / degraded on those versions. The blu-ray is well worth owning and provides a level of detail I had never before seen. It is possible to read signs in places like the airport and train station, the detail is that good. The colors seem much less muted though they do not rival a modern film or even the eye-popping color seen in 1960s vintage film/TV shows like The Prisoner and Star Trek which I also own and highly recommend. Another reviewer noted this film was done in Metrocolor (which I am not familiar with but which is likely why colors not so bold). There are a few spots in the film, one reaction take of Martin Landau's character, for example, which seem to be of much lower quality - but it is clear this is a problem with source material and not an issue with the transfer.<br /><br />Overall, I feel this is a great buy for anyone who knows and loves this movie - and come to think of it I don't think I know anyone who has seen it who is not a fan! I am pleased it is so reasonably priced (it is thankfully NOT an $80 box set with a miniature plastic Mount Rushmore, notepad with \\"Think Thin\\" printed on every page or other nonsense, as another reviewer or poster noted)

B002UJIY7A|2.0|For years I've been an enthusiastic  fan of both Mila Jovovich (FIFTH ELEMENT and RESIDENT EVIL) and Timothy Olyphant (HITMAN and the DEADWOOD series on HBO), but this film is a clunker. Before you spend any money buying it, I would suggest that you view a rental copy first. Better still, if you can watch it for free during a plane flight, so much the better. I seriously doubt you would ever want to watch it a second time.<br /><br />Basically, if you like cheesy serial-killer movies with lots of violence, then you'll love this. If you don't, you won't.<br /><br />People who are hidebound by logical consistency and do not appreciate plot holes might also want to find something else to spend their money on, because this film not only misleads viewers as to who the serial killers are--it outright deceives them with false information.<br /><br />Otherwise, within the narrow limits of the genre, the \\"acting\\" is adequate, the stunts are well performed, and the scenery is very nice.

B002T9H2LA|4.0|The title of this film should be your first clue that it is not quite in focus with reality as most of us know it. (Who spells \\"bastards\\" as \\"basterds\\"?)<br /><br />What we have here is a rather clever tongue-in-cheek \\"What if--\\" fantasy: What if a group of Jewish GIs led by Brad Pitt went into German-Occupied France and began scalping Nazis--and THEN had a chance to end WWII far earlier than in reality by killing off the Nazi high command, including Hitler?<br /><br />For the most part the acting is first-rate and the script is right on target in relation to the main premise. In my own view, a couple of scenes dragged out a bit too long and a few bits of violence were cheesy and/or unnecessary, but many people have different tastes from mine--notice that other reviewers have rated this film from five stars all the way down to one star.<br /><br />I found the ending (which is very graphic and violent) totally appropriate and fully justified in terms of what we are shown in earlier scenes, and I have recommended this film to both my family and my friends.

I'm here to say I don't have children, but I adore PIXAR Studios Animations.. they're a true work of art.. and that's coming from a meat-space pictorial illustrator. Anyone taking the time to view the Director's Comments would appreciate how much thought, and how much of themselves the artists & writers put into this, and every other PIXAR Movie.   For children being shielded from dealing with what to expect when their Grandparents shuffle off their mortal coil, there's always plenty of Barney the BIG Purple Dinosaur still lurking around out there.

B002VPE1AM|3.0|My family and I went and saw the Avatar movie this past weekend. I have to say, Avatar certainly lived up to its $400 million budget! I was impressed by the computer graphics, which were definitely innovative. The acting was good, and I liked the storyline.<br /><br />Avatar is about a planet called Pandora. In the year 2154, Americans have established a base on Pandora and are mining a special resource. Marines are used on the base for protection purposes, because the native populations are unwelcoming. Scientists are also on the base, attempting to research the planet. Their research is done using avatars, a human/native hybrid that is made using the DNA of a specific researcher. This allows a researcher to form a link with the avatar that is made from their DNA through a mental link. The research team, with the help of a Marine, worked to befriend the local population. Unfortunately for the researchers and locals, Americans possess an unquenchable thirst for expansion.<br /><br />The acting in the movie was great. Sam Worthington played a Marine, and did a great job with his role. He has a certain attitude, which you can hear in his narration, which lends to his tough-guy persona. The other actors played their parts well, although I can't say anyone's acting was a stand-out performance. The costumes were great, although they too, were nothing stellar. The avatars were a combination of the actors and computer animation, and looked cool. You can definitely tell they are animated, but the animation blends perfectly with the scenes so the visual effects are fantastic!<br /><br />Unfortunately, regardless of all the flashy graphics and the enjoyable plot, I found the movie borderline offensive! It's been a very long time since I saw a movie which was so blatantly racist. Normally when I watch a movie, I just watch it for enjoyment and don't bother analyzing the story. Unfortunately, my brain seems to have been on that evening, because from early on in the film, all I could do was think about how racist the film was. When we walked out of the theatre, the first thing my dad mentioned was how racist/stereotypical the movie was! The locals on Pandora were portrayed as very primitive. They worn loin cloths, war paint, and headdresses. They whooped their war cries, and had no stronger weapons than bows and arrows while the U.S. Marines laughed at their pitiful weaponry.<br /><br />I suppose my issue with this movie was that I don't understand why Americans feel the need to portray native populations as primitive. Yes, we do have a lot of technology and an awesome military, however that doesn't mean we're entitled to portray ourselves as culturally superior! I grasp that they didn't want to stick to the stereotypical alien that is technologically advanced, however it was almost like we were laughing at primitive cultures. I was not a fan.<br /><br />That being said, it's an enjoyable movie so long as you are watching it at face value and not really paying attention to subtext... which I know is how most people watch movies. So go ahead and go see the movie and make your own judgment as to whether you like it or not!

B0026P3G12|5.0|Susan Boyle's CD is just wonderful. I love the entire Susan Boyle story, what she represents to us all, that we all have hope in life and can fullfill our dreams. The selection of songs is lovey, her voice beautiful and her comments on the songs are wonderful. I hope she does a CD of just Christmas Songs for us in the future. She deserves all the sucess she is getting in life, she is a down to earth, kind person who made us all smile.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|This is I think my favorite tv show of all time. It's got amazing family elements, cool effects, and more scary stuff than you can shake a stick at. But it's more than surface horror, there's also deeply running brotherhood and character developments that make it so much more than your cookie cutter spook tv show. If you want something fresh, exciting and a variety that you won't find in other shows, you'll want to add this to your collection. I do advise getting seasons 1&2 also though, so you won't be lost plot wise.
B002XTBE8I|5.0|...damn, this song, the beat, the heat, the lyrics are crazy. Dr. Dre & Eminem did magic on this one! This song alone justifies a second purchase, even though the other new songs are solid too. Can't wait for Relapse 2.

As a midseason replacement it's also a safe start, if you're wondering if you should give it a try, the price won't break the bank. Can't go wrong with this one.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|In my opinion this game ranks up with the board game Risk!  Trading and somewhat alliances built, all while expanding your own empire.  We have frequent game nights at our house and this is one that we play frequently enough we had to go out and purchase a set of our own.  LOVE IT!  My only recommendation is if you purchase a builder or additional set to build off of your set, make sure its compatible.  Example, if your set is cardboard made but the builder set is plastic they will not combine.  Read closely!
B00092ZL80|5.0|Note: This review is for the Earth, Wind & Fire set only (got Disc 1 from Netflix).<br /><br />If you like Earth, Wind & Fire, you'll love this DVD.  This very special band innovated a unique sound which fuses funk, soul, jazz, pop, and more.  They sounded great back in the day, and they sound great on this DVD -- and still fresh.  The DVD sound quality is excellent, the musicianship and singing are superb and tight, and they perform with sincere and infectious enthusiasm.  Suffice it to say that if music is at all capable of connecting us with the divine, this performance offers that transcendent joy.<br /><br />Very highly recommended for any Earth, Wind & Fire fan.

B001SGEUNI|5.0|I found out about Hailstorm reading Revolver magazine.  After listening to their music online I ordered their CD and haven't stopped listening to it since I got it.  The vocals are amazing and the guitar work in the songs is very solid. Check out their videos on Youtube.  Lzzy is able to hit and sustain notes better than some of the best hard rock singers out there and do it live without multiple studio takes.  I am heavily into Metal/Punk/Rock, I play guitar myself, and I really like their fusion of a vintage pop metal style with a more modern grunge / heavy sound.  The guitar leads are simple and to the point, well composed overall.  It's interesting to listen to a band that tunes down with the rhythm guitar tuned lower than the lead guitar by a minor third.
B0029LHW68|3.0|.........the Killers new album! What happened to the sonic sounds of the last 2 albums? Where are the guitars? This album is ok but WTF really?!?!
0452289963|5.0|I am considered a mature person of some years but ,again, I still find amazing   growth through a book like this. It has explained so many concepts to me,especially the whole idea of the\\"devil\\" and the idea that we live NOW.not  yesterday or tomorrow.
B002QEXN2K|1.0|ZZZZzzzzzz....what?  Oh, sorry....I was listening to John Mayer's new album, \\"Battle Studies\\", and I must have dozed off.  I enjoyed \\"Heavier Things\\" and \\"Continuum\\", but this was nothing more than a remash of his former songs as well as some rip-off-riffs of other artists.  The third track, \\"Half of My Heart\\" is apropos, since this album was a half-hearted effort.  Skip it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This album features a wide range of songs that beautifully capture the singing talent of Susan Boyle. I am very pleased with this album and play it often, enjoying the clear highs and lows of Susan's vocal ability. I would highly recommend this CD for the pure enjoyment and variety it provides.
0439023483|5.0|This was an amazing story!  The author has a wonderful way of holding you captivated the whole way through.  It makes you want to read, read, read.  The characters are so endearing, and grab your heart.  A great story for young and old alike!
B002T9H2LA|3.0|I really had great expectations for this film but somehow it never grabbed me like I hoped it would.   I am a big fan of WW2 films.   Perhaps it's me as I have never cared much for films that 'spoof' like this and yet try to be serious.  Kudos to the actors as they did their job well.   Brad Pitt was the least effective of the group.    I would get more thrills/fun watching The Dirty Dozen again.  Where is 'a' Lee Marvin when you need him.
0439023491|5.0|What a wonderful author.  Gripping story that holds you all the way through!  Only 1 problem...waiting until the next book is released!!!
B001EYU1VO|5.0|It was a Christmas gift and they loved it.  Works great and easy to use.  Takes a little while in setting up controls but either than that works great.
B000UR9T7I|4.0|Spider-man 3 is a good movie story wise.  I thought all the acting was pretty good and there certainly is humor.  I think this film captures some of the issues Peter Parker had in the comics balancing his personal life and his super hero alter ego.  The blu-ray looks very good.  The sound however, is just slightly anemic.
0783116934|5.0|I have seen this film 3 times and would watch it again if I share with another
B002JIEYLM|3.0|After Sabatage which was an ok album, I'm sure that everyone wanted to like this album.  There is only one stand out track being Dirty Women, which is a more marginal hit, They try to switch more to rock and roll, I guess that it was selling more at the time, and you can claim that all the members were far removed from their hard living past.  The playing on all the songs is still good on this album, but just because it doesn't ever offend your ears, tracks end before you ever notice that they started, most of the album never gets to that next gear, and by the time it gets there its over.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|This movie is wonderful for viewers of any age.  It's a touching, wonderful story about a lonely old widower who goes on a last adventurer in memory of his deceased wife.  A young Wilderness Explorer accidentally winds up coming along for the ride, and the pair battle through many unexpected surprises in the South American jungle.  Of course, many others can review this movie better than I can, but I can tell you how it makes me feel.    The first 20 minutes make me cry every time, they are wonderfully poignant scenes of joy and sorrow that I can't get enough of.  Many moments make me laugh, and cringe, and feel hopeful.  Many moments make me smile, and cry some more!  There is plenty of detail, and it's worth watching again and again.  This has become my favorite movie of all time, and I intend to watch it many, many more times.  Every time I watch it I find more details I had missed, that makes it feel like my first time watching the movie.  Also, I think it gets better every time I see it!
B002JIEYLC|4.0|I don't mean to criticize this album too much, as it is the last of the really classic Sabbath albums, but the first of the not amazing albums.  There will be fans of the album as with all the ozzie albums, and there will be those that claim there were no truly great songs, not to say that there weren't some really goods ones, but I will agree there is no focal point song, just some really good ones accompanied by some not so good ones.  Sabbath claim the title of the album came from the record company mingling too much in their efforts, but i personally think that it had a lot more to do with their constant drug use and over preduction of material at that point in their career.  If they had only taken a break to get cleaned up like in modern time, I can't imagine just how different the current musical landscape would be.  Hole in the Sky and Symptoms of the Universe are the closest to stand out tracks.  Still not a bad album, nothing truly cringe worthy.  Also weird to think that about this time Sabbath was touring with Van Halen before they made it big and I can't imagine the talks that Iommi and Eddie had.  Not a complete bust, but not as good as their ealier work.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I haven't been this excited about a new album since Barbara Striesand's first release.  I was totally taken by Susan Boyle's voice on the snippets I saw on TV.  What a let down to hear this recording.  It was almost like the producers didn't trust her to carry the sound and instead overpowered her voice with instrumentals. The choice of songs selected was questionable also.  I hope there will be another recording released soon that will display the full range of Susan's fine gift.
B000002KB8|5.0|Its really hard to review this album when so much has already has already been said.  This was the first recording controact that the band was able to get after \\"touring\\" in the most liberal since of the word for over a year, getting marginal attention.  You can claim that the accident that caused Tony Iomi to lose his fingertips causing him to lower his guitar, or the hard lives that the members lead, the sarcastic apporach that lead them to believe that they needed a gimmick that just happened to coincide with their tallents, but this is the birth of heavy metal.  It wasn't until their next album that the more consitant metal album would really be forged, so a lot of new age metal fans have complained that this album doesn't seem hard enough, as there is still a lot of rythem and blues left over from their previous act, but it is still very well done.  The two stand out tracks are the title Black Sabbath, which is legitimately creepy, that begins with the devils triangle and was inspired by a real life seeing of a spirit.  You can say that with all the hippie stuff that was going around in the late sixties and early seventies that they were a call back to reality of the harder things in life as well as a darker spiritual side to confront the moral conseravatives that came before.  I know that a lot of people found the original cover art of the girl in the woods to be really kreepy.  It does conjure up some Manson images that does really say what it needs to.  Not sure if metal would have existed without later efforts, but the ground work is all here.  I suggest getting a new remaster.  Because of their lack of experience in a studio some of the older versions of this album suffer in sound quality, but the remaster brings a lot back.

B002JIEYKS|2.0|Everyone knew that sabbath was ending.  They put this out to try and stop it from happening.  Hold the jokes that never say die is the opposite of what was achieved.  People claim that the title track is the stand out but I actually thought the second track had at least some energy.  One of sabbath's worst in the history of the band, to include Born Again, and Seventh Star.  Not one really good track.
B000EHQTZO|5.0|It is not a stretch to say that every imaginative film since KING KONG owes everything to this breakthrough film.  Not in the least.  This is the first film of this type to have a huge impact -- not just with movie goers of the time but future generations -- in inspiring countless generations.  An incredible retelling of BEAUTY AND THE BEAST with it's poetic last lines, \\"It was beauty that killed the beast.\\"  It -- despite progression by leaps and bounds in special visual effects -- remains a monumental achievement, one that Willis O'Brien would never achieve again.  Yet he did inspire so many generations of young people who saw the incredible wonder and dream of doing it themselves: Ray Harryhausen, Jim Danforth, David Allen, Jim Apeaperle (?), Roger Dickens, Ken Ralston, Doug Trumbill and too many others to name.  With stop motion O'Brien was able to give Kong life and emotion.  If you love fantastic films this has to be a cornerstone of any library.  Remastered to probably better than viewers saw it on the silver screen of the time and with insighful commentary by Harryhausen and Ralston, you have to love this movie.  It has been loving remastered for future generations.  Peter Jackson launched a HUGE remake that has some true moments but nothing can ever exceed the original.  Kong battling a T-Rex is still exciting.
6305428050|5.0|This is a great comedy. It is about the hardships (adventures) a teenaged girl encounters when she drives with the three minors she's babysitting to downtown Chicago to pick up her best friend at the train station. The fast paced adventures or situations they run into keep the plot alive at all times. Really funny.    On the technical side, the DVD is a disaster. Although it is advertized with an aspect ratio of 1.85 it will not trigger (flag) modern TVs into the appropiate aspect ratio. I had to struggle with my 2009 50\\" plasma Samsung to get a semi-decent viewing aspect ratio. Circles appeared as ovals. Inspecting the DVD control files I found that the material is identified as 4:3. Also, resolution is below par.    It's a pity that such a good comedy wasn't treated better by the studio.
B000EHSVOG|4.0|Before Roland Emmerich there was Irwin Allen.  THE TOWERING INFERNO is the height of the 1970's disaster films.  Boasting the star power of Paul Newman, Steve McQueen, Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Fred Astaire, Jennifer Jones, Robert Vaughn, Richard Chamberlain and more.  The world's tallest building catches fire amid the fiestivaties celebrating its opening.  Long, but heavy on action.  Extras include featurettes on the production.
B002SJIO54|5.0|I didn't expect anything from this film and came out loving it. Those idiots who only gave it 1 star sound like they are taking it too seriously, don't forget it is fantasy not reality and only a film. It was enjoyable, original and not scared to poke fun at itself. Black people in south africa were treated axactly like the prawns and I think thats the message the director is trying to portray. CLASSIC!!!!!!!!
0793518326|2.0|This book has everything you would want within it.    The problem is the font is so small there is no way it can actually be used.   No kidding.
B0027REDK2|4.0|Personally, I found that the mastering on this new release is a bit shrill, with way too many highs that leave the songs sounding not only flat, but tinny at the same time with no dynamic range. Luckily, I have an old school system with an actual graphic equalizer, so i can manipulate the sound quality. But if you have a modern system that gives you 'predetermined' equalizer settings, you may have an issue finding the right setting. My only other complaint about this release is the final track on disc 2. The carnival mix of My Own Way is kind of ruined by the fact that they've tacked a spoken holiday greeting by Simon LeBon onto the end of the track! So guess what--if you want to put this mix on your ipod and don't have any editing software, you'll have to listen to that spoken greeting every time you play the song. So glad I have this mix on another CD...
B000TSIK14|5.0|Yes,there are ballads. Not your typical scorps ballads. This is a NEW scorps with shades of old sprinkled in. And I love it!     I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR HOUR II SINCE '07!!! Guy's,what's up?!! This one deserves a follow up!

B000MRAAJM|3.0|Just received the product and to my surprise the video format is 1080i instead of 1080p as shown on the website ....zoom in on the back of the box picture. I am returning it with disappointment. BTW, I have seen the 1080p version and the experience is just outstanding. If you can get the 1080p and have a full 1080p TV with Blu Ray....this is a \\"must watch\\" for the family.
0802130208|5.0|This has to be one of the craziest books I've ever read.  It is So Funny!!!    The Catcher in the Rye and Running With Scissors are the only other books that are in a league with this one.    Pure genius!!!!
B0026P3G12|3.0|Ms. Susan Boyle has one of THE VOICES of the century and some moron of a producer has put together an album where the orchestra is totally overshadowing her voice. Very disappointing. The selection of the music is below all the criticism, taking from Ms. Boyle away the opportunity to forward to the listeners this God given gift of hers: to sing divinely, and to do it loud, like she did for the first time when millions of viewers were astonished seeing her on the British talent competition.  Merry Christmas Ms.Boyle and God bless You ( and sue the record company! )  Marcus M. Keerberg
B000JJS8TM|3.0|This is a remarkable production - using existing \\"Beatles performed\\" music in a very creative set of mixes that seem a perfect match to a Cirque du Soleil show.  The multi-channel sound quality is excellent and many of the songs are really eye-openers for an old Beatles fan (literally - I graduated high school in 1965).  But the Cirque aspect is, for me, also the drawback and so the album missed \\"my mark\\".  There were bits and pieces of songs that I wanted to hear full-length, and a bit too much of the later work or instumental (re)mixes for my taste.  I previewed the album and if I had heard the whole thing it would still be in my collection - I just wish there were more \\"songs\\" and a bit less \\"music\\".  For anyone who likes the Beatles - it's a worthwhile investment, just don't expect to sing along...
1416955070|1.0|I'm trying to plod through all three books, having puchased the set based on author recommendations on the box, but it's a struggle. If the problem were only the uncomfortable language useage I might forgive the author, but inconsistent plot devices ruin the immersion.<br /><br />Here's one example. At the beginning Clary's friend Simon is unable to see shadowhunters. Since Clary, IS a born shadowhunter this leaves the reader with a \\"Huh?\\" moment. Later Simon CAN see the shadowhunters, supposedly because he now BELIEVES. (If you believe in Tinkerbelle clap your hands?) Later when it's necessary for nonbelievers to see the shadowhunters we're told that they're only invisible when wearing a glamour. Uh sure. The basics of what a shadowhunter is and what one can do is poorly thought out and constantly changes as the author decides to add something without going back and rewriting.<br /><br />The books read like a lengthy college assignment cranked out to meet a deadline. As others have commented there's nothing original here and what there is was poorly done. Read it only if there's nothing else on your bookshelf. For those new to urban fantasy and needing a book, pass this series up and search for genre pioneers like Jim Butcher or Laurel K Hamilton.
0762412992|5.0|I was pleased to receive this book so fast - and the description was very accurate.  it was a special christmas gift - and she was thrilled with it.  thank you so much
B0026P3G12|2.0|I was so disappointed.  Her songs were ho-hum.  One song sounded like the next song.  Lacking would be my best 1-word description
0316044938|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading \\"The Lovely Bones\\" by Alice Sebold but after doing so I must say I left the book somewhat disappointed. It's not to say that the book wasn't any good, because it was very interesting at some parts and even a little enlightening; however I think there were parts of the book where the author went into too much monotonous babble over trivial things not solely related to the story concept and lost sight of what really grabbed the reader to begin with. My biggest complaint was the end the book which in my opinion lacked any feeling; the message at the end that the whole book was building up to seemed rushed or merely thrown in your face at the last minute. In the end this book could hardly be called suspenseful as it had been described. It had a good (interesting) beginning then teetered out to a pretty disappointing ending.
B0026P3G12|5.0|As most were, I was impressed by Susan's performance initially and looked forward positively to her debut CD.  Upon receiving the CD, I began to listen to \\"Wild Horses\\" and was literally stunned by her skill and passion to the point where my heart was lifted joyously!  How powerful!  The following selections were equally as pleasing.  The simplicity of the accompanyment only added to the quality of her music and espression.<br /><br />I look forward to whatever Ms. Boyle presents in the future.  She has a fan for life!  Thank you.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I love Susan Boyle.  Her voice is great.  Her chosen songs were great too!

0307266303|5.0|This book is a great read for runners, those who are thinking about taking up running, and those who wonder why people even bother running! This book not only divulges remarkable facts about the evolution of the sport, but also tells a phenomenal, adventurous story.  Although its non-fiction, it's also great for those who love fiction.
B002QEXN2K|1.0|All I can say is...YUK!!!  No creativity or imagination involved in this album at all!
B002ZJGN96|4.0|As others have said, I do hear elements of others scores within this one.  Most recognizable to me is the use of Titanic sequences.  Which isn't surprising because most composers tend to use detectable elements between all of their works.  However, it is still enjoyable and it works very well within the movie and remains beautiful with repeated listening.
B0008ENHT4|5.0|Steve McQueen is as always Mr. Supercool as a S.F.P.D. detective. Without the chase this movie would have never made it to the big time. As great as McQueen is in it, he was the only actor who was awake during the filming.
B000AGTPUU|4.0|Christmas makes saps of us all, and if Hollywood knows how to do anything it's how to make a few nickels from our sappery - how else can you explain Playboy bunny Jenny McCarthy having not one but two holiday movies playing on The Family Channel (!) this year?    So it was only a matter of time before America's most beloved movie star, Tom Hanks, found his way into America's most beloved holiday.  Re-teaming with Robert Zemeckis (they previously worked together on two little independent films you might have seen, \\"Forrest Gump\\" and \\"Cast Away\\"), Hanks gets to play five different roles thanks to motion-capture technology and Zemeckis's desire to push digital filmmaking to new frontiers.  It's a bit of a distraction for the adults who keep trying to find Tom Hanks in the various digital characters, but since it's Tom Hanks we don't care too much (we also don't care that his train conductor's Chicago accent ebbs and flows like the tide).     But \\"The Polar Express\\" is a kids movie and should be judged accordingly.  On that level, \\"TPE\\" is a near-triumph.  Our hero, an unnamed boy of around 10-12 years old, is doubting Santa on Christmas Eve.  He is old enough to spot the chinks in Santa's armor he is in danger of Not Believing In Santa.  Then, as he searches for slumber on Christmas Eve, a huge old-fashioned locomotive pulls up in front of his house, somewhat shocking because there are no train tracks.  He reluctantly climbs aboard and is off on an adventure of a lifetime, rocketing down the tracks towards the North Pole along with several other kids in various stages of Christmas skepticism.      Visually, \\"TPE\\" is a stunner, whether it's capturing the beauty of a winter countryside, churning your stomach as the train shoots down a 179-degree grade at Glacier Gulch, or meandering through Santa's charming red-brick home town at the North Pole.  This is animation that's one step away from reality, in a good way.    Sure, there are some glitches.  A quick song-and-dancenumber serves as a reminder (along with Richard Gere's performance in \\"Chicago\\") that not all movie stars are ready for musicals.  The Josh Groban ballad \\"Believe\\" gets a little tired, and the appearance of Steven Tyler from Aerosmith as an elf to sing \\"Rockin' on Top of the World\\" reeks of a blatant attempt to increase soundtrack sales.      All things considered, while \\"TPE\\" is not going to knock either the Grinch (cartoon version) or \\"A Christmas Story\\" from their perches  as the top Christmas movies, it's a proud addition to the family DVD library - a welcome excuse to ignore the latest holiday pseudo-entertainment from secondary \\"talents\\" like Ms. McCarthy.
B000UJ48SQ|3.0|I was expecting some kind of British stiff upper lip period piece with quirky characters and lovable uncles and such. Instead, we get a lushly filmed drama of a man with whom we originally sympathize, but later begin to detest.  A bit too long for my taste, with a few confusing or ambiguous scenes.  I would recommend this film only if you have a few hours to spare and if you appreciate the intricacies of fine drama.
B0026P3G12|4.0|I thought this was a good album to be her first. There are a variety of songs in different genres which gives you the opportunity to see her range. I thought she sounded good on all of them, with some being more outstanding than others because of the feeling that came through. You judge. If you're a Susan fan, it's well worth buying.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I had heard good things about Star Trek but to say it blew me out of the water is an understatement. I loved the original series and was nervous how they would handle it but they did magnificently. I was hoping Shatner would make an appearance but that's a very tiny blemish on an otherwise perfect movie. If you haven't seen this, do so now. Very much worth your time.
0140282033|5.0|I got this book because I love the movie so much... I was somewhat surprised that the book was a bit different from the movie; nevertheless, I really enjoyed reading \\"Chocolat.\\" Other than the fact that Raynaud and the \\"Bible groupies\\" got on my nerves for acting high and mighty and for their prejudiced views against Vianne w/o actually getting to know her, I found most characters are really charming and endearing, esp. Armande. Joanne Harris's writing kept me engaged throughout the whole book. I've just started reading the sequel, \\"The Girl with No Shadow.\\" I hope this book is as enjoyable as \\"Chocolat.\\"

B00001NTXN|5.0|This game is so quick to play that you can take a 15 minute break from whatever you are doing, play a round with you kid(s) and go back to your task easily.

0786838655|5.0|Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be doomed forever, never live a happy life, and to know that you probably won't make it to your 16th birthday? Well that is what life is like for Percy Jackson, the main character in the Lighting Thief. The gods, goddesses, and the Titans have always been at war with each other, and this book will explain more. In the Lighting Thief Rick Riordan gives a great blend of ancient myth, modern experiences, and makes the reader believe the events could really happen.   In the story Percy Jackson starts off thinking he is a regular kid. But when him and his class go on a field trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he finds his teacher, Mrs. Dobbs ready to slash him into a million pieces. He thinks he is hallucinating. But when he gets home from school his mom takes him to a cabin on the beach. Weird things happen their  and as he is racing for his life to reach a camp at the top of a hill everything starts to take a turn for the better... or worse. For Percy's whole life he has always wondered who his father was, and where he came from. He finds out he is son of Poseidon, king of the sea. He is sent out on a quest to the underworld to get Zeus's lighting   bolt. On his journey he gets trapped in the St. Louise Arch, trying to kill a lion shaped monster, and a women with snakes as her hair. Percy ends up blowing a whole in the Arch and jumping through into the Mississippi River. This is just 1 of many challenges to fulfill is guest and destiny.   The audience for the Lighting Thief could be 8-14 because their can be a lot of battles that they must fight. Also this book could be for people who like thrilling and mythical novels. The author keeps the same audience throughout because there is always a battle being fought and a question that must have an answer. The genre is mythical fiction. The book is like Harry Potter because they both have mythical creatures and  kids having unusual powers. That is the audience and genre.The book \\"the Lighting Thief\\" can be compared to the TV show \\"Charmed.\\" I think this because in the show 3 sisters have certain powers, and they fight if monsters and kill them. Also because almost all the monsters in the show are mythical creatures that I have read about in the book. They are different because the main characters in the show are witches and in the novel Percy is a half-blood.    The thing in the Lighting Thief that I liked the most was how Rick Riordan makes you believe that the fantasies could actually happen. He puts the scenes in places that it could happen like the St. Louise, Arch or in a California hotel. In my opinion I think the biggest weakness was that it was hard to get into the book. I thought the beginning was kind of boring and I was thinking about quitting the book. But by the second chapter I could not put the book down. Every time the story answered one question it brought up a new one to be answered later in the story.   In conclusion I think this book taught me a lot about history and what they believed. Also it put me on the edge. I always get excited to start the next book in the series. I do  recommend this book for others.
B0026P3G12|2.0|I was highly disappointed with this CD.  I expected to be WOWed - like Simon Cowell was when Susan Boyle began singing \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" on American Idol.  This CD leaves me cold.  There are only a couple of songs where she is allowed to show the depths of range that her voice is capable of.  As I was listening to the CD for the first time I kept waiting for the WOW part.  It's not there.  I pre-ordered the CD based on the performances I had heard on TV; I wish I had waited to hear the exerpts from the CD before ordering.
0006716776|5.0|\\"At some point when they're growing up, most kid's dream of finding a world different than their own,\\" well in Cs Lewis classic children's tale, the Chronicles of Narnia that is exactly what happens. So do you want to read a great adventurous book? If you do then The Chronicles of Narnia is the right book for you. There are four kids [peter (oldest), Susan, Edmond, and Lucy (youngest)] who have to leave their home in London because there are air raids. So they have to get on a train and go to a place far away from their home. They go to a house in the country where a professor lives and the professor has a house keeper. When the kid's get there the house keeper makes many rules for them and the most important rule that the house keeper made sure they heard was \\"don't bother the professor!\\" While they were playing one day they find a magical wardrobe that leads to a mystery land called Narnia, while in Narnia siblings have to learn to trust and believe in them selves and in others in order to get through Narnia. Ultimately Edmond is tricked by the white witch and leaves his brother and sisters. They must rescue him, but how can three kids defeat a powerful and mystical witch?   The Chronicles of Narnia is a book for everyone. It has a great adventure and once you start reading it you're hooked. The whole book is basically a rising action as each page gets better. It also has some action and a little magic. It has a lot of different creatures. With a very creative story, this book is fiction and fantasy.   The Chronicles of Narnia is really similar to the movie version of The Chronicles of Narnia. The book just has a lot more description than the movie. For example: in the book they tell the setting everywhere and when they get to the beavers house they describe everything and in the movie they just show the house while they are walking into it. They both make a good picture in your mind. They both have the same characters.   There are no weaknesses and nothing I didn't like about the Lion, Witch, and the Wardrobe. The book makes you wonder what is going to happen next, example there is never a slow boring part. The book is always moving and it feels like you are moving with it or in it. It is great all the way to the end. In conclusion this book will blow your mind. A never ending adventure that takes you with it. Full of action waiting to happen, when you pick it up and start reading it you won't want to put it down. Even if you don't like to read you will not regret reading it.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|This is my second pair of turtle beaches. The first were the x1 which did the job, but the x41 gives me more freedom and use. in the evening I use them to play COD and at night to watch TV. The sound is so much crisper. It dose simulate surround sound, but your ears may miss lead you to looking in the wrong place at times. All in all it is a grate thing to have. It is truly the next level for gaming.
B000H5TVKI|5.0|Can't comment on movie since it speaks for itself. Blue Ray quality is excellent. Surprised me.
1573300403|5.0|This DVD contains the big MJ statue, marching scenes, and fans screaming. That I can do without but I love the classical music in those parts. It has Motown 25's Billie Jean, Beat It, Liberian Girl, Smooth Criminal, 1995 MTV Awards Billie Jean and Dangerous, Thriller, Scream, Childhood, You Are Not Alone, Earth Song,They Don't Care about Us (Brazil), Stranger in Moscow, Blood on the Dance Floor (Refugee Camp Mix), and Brace Yourself ( Marching scenes). This DVD is my favorite of the short film DVDs that I have.  I plan to donate my MJ books to the local library after I've read them. It is a way to get out that he was innocent and that his kind of entertainment talent only happens once. I am a new fan; post MJ's death. To keep his legacy alive we need to spread the word. I'd like to see a book dedicated soley to MJ's humanitarian deeds. He was such a loving and caring person.
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|Need a HD version!!!! I sometimes see the PBS show on HD and it drives me nuts watching this DVD. Yuck but I just have to suffer a bit.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|I really like this DVD because the quality is good and there is nothing better than watching MJ in a live performance. That's why he was the ultimate entertainer. I know tours really took it out of him and is what probably lead to his death but his live performances was what separated him from other entertainers. It's where his real genius lies.  This DVD includes, Jam, Wanna Be Startin somethin,Human nature, Smooth Criminal, I just Can't Stop Loving You, She's Out of My Life, Jackson 5 Medley (I Want You Back, The Love You Save, I'll Be there), Thriller Billie Jean, Working Day and Night, Beat It, will You Be There, Black or White, Heal The World, and Man in the Mirror.

0307716988|5.0|What I like about this book is that the photos and the passages are all chosen by MJ. So much written about him is other people's interpitation of his life. Did you know that he wanted this book to be a coffee table size; with more photos?  Well he got his wish with his Opus. Too bad he isn't alive to see it. I got his Opus but have not read it yet but did look at the photos and WOW it's impressive. I'm sure the Opus is what MJ had in mind when Moonwalk was published. I plan to donate my MJ books to the local library after I've read them.  It is a way to get out that he was innocent and that his kind of entertainment talent only happens once. I am a new fan; post MJ's death. To keep his legacy alive we need to spread the word. I'd like to see a book dedicated soley to MJ's humanitarian deeds. He was such a loving and caring person.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This was my first Dan Brown read.  I decided not to start with The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons.  I jumped right into the Symbol. After the first chapter I could not put the book down.  I live near Washington, DC and have worked at Signature Flight Support thus when hearing both mentioned I was smiling all over.  The book does get a little wordy and preachy about symbols.  The lecture stuff with students lost me.  But overall the references to the Ancient Mysteries, The Masons, and the twists of the final 5 chapters were good enough for me.  I guess the Noetic Science stuff and the puzzle of symbols were the downside.  The upside was the action, secrets of Washington, DC, the twists and turns, the involvement of the CIA and the shocking ending were pluses for me.  Like many of our esteemed reviewers pointed out if I had read the afore mentioned first books of Mr. Brown the Symbol would be a let down. Next stop will be Angels and Demons.  Then the main event \\"The Da Vinci Code.
074356619X|2.0|So maybe if I had read the reviews I would not have bought the CD set.  I didnt know it was a self help thing, I was hoping for a fun story. I listened to it but I dont think I learned anything from it; guess you needed to really want to hear it.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I had no problems with this order. It arrived on time and was properly packaged to insure good quality.
B002T09LDQ|5.0|I can't believe nobody has reviewed this thing yet.  Here we have 15 songs of pure unadulterated brilliance--think of a happier version of Arcade Fire, or a more accessible Flaming Lips.  I promise you won't find a better indie rock album from 2009.  A total winner.
B000E1ZBFY|5.0|This movie gave me so much knowledge about our past pope, and gave me even more respect than I already had for him (which is a lot since he was a pope and everything). But I feel like it is important for us to see how strong his faith is, and to learn about his personal life, because there is a lot to him before he even took the papal honor.
B002XTBE8I|5.0|I bought the new 2 CD set because of 'Elevator' which shows Eminem back in top form.    Many reviewers have already described the first disc, but the 7 new songs on this album more than justify fans to purchase this new CD set.
B001EN71CW|5.0|I love having the entire series on three discs, but it makes me sad when I get to the end and realize there are no more episodes, no more seasons.
1906694176|5.0|A wonderful new writer,sorry he left us so young! Stay with this first one and you'll cry for more...couldn't wait to read the 2nd in the series, already bought the 3rd in UK. Much characterization which can take more time to digest-but worth it! The intrigue and suspense is well-achieved as you progress, and then you can't put it down. With intro of Lisbeth, Steig has crafted a totally, new character for today's world. And you have the \\"good\\" in Mikel fighting \\"evil\\" with both Lisbeth's and his own enemies. Predict trilogy will have a cult following that only grows!
B002VXWBXI|5.0|For anyone that loves Twilight, this is a must see! It brings the characters to life and goes in depth to describe their lives in detail, something I wish Twilight had done in there movie. Very satisfying story line. Thriller,and a bit scary will keep you on the edge of your seat. Be warned it is addicting to watch, you won't be able to stop!
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Best 2010 Picture and one of the best movies in history, whether the Academy likes it or not!!!  The ceremony of the Oscars was obviously partialized to give the awards to \\"The Hurt Locker\\" which is an excellent movie great directing but totally forgettable.  When I saw it, I found it to be a good war related movie.  The end was shockingly empty and depressive, I got the message... but that was it.  I left the theater and 2 days later was it totally forgotten, why because acting and directing well is not enough to make a good epic movie... there were some holes that needed to be covered (see my comments for the \\"Hurt Locker\\")  I can not say the same thing about AVATAR, I saw this movie last year and I still have it in my mind pounding in my heart and for the millions of people who have carefully watched,  understood and appreciated AVATAR I can assure that they will have it in their minds and hearts not just because of the Na'vis, Pandora Creatures, the Outrageous Cinematography, or the Outstanding Visual Effects & Technology used... they will have AVATAR dearly close to them because of the message is sending to the world, we're killing our planet and all that lives in it including ourselves, we invent and make wars to own what is not ours no matter what... the global warming is a fact NOW and a big problem for the human kind, people is dying every day because of its consequences and nobody cares, because of ignorance, greed or pure evil.  It is our turn now to take action to stop this massacre that our Governments or industrial s pursue in order to take, own, control, and steal from others their goods.   Some say that AVATAR was full of clichés... a cliché is a convenient word used to diminish an action that supposedly has been used too frequently that eventually loses its meaning.  Well it is the life of our planet we are talking about here and there will never be enough clichés to call the attention to this matter.  Pandora was used as a representation of ourplanet in they way it was intended to be rich for all of us to share, peaceful and spiritually pleasant; but Pandora was destroyed the same way we do in real life, just next to my door I can see devastation and nobody cares.  When a truth is slapped in your face some people use very conveniently the word cliché.   \\"The Academy\\" tried to diminish AVATAR success by ignoring it in the Oscars.   Well despite the obvious, hilarious and ridiculous attitude of the Academy past Sunday I have to say that see if James Cameron cares, he's has done his part already, and he's got the BIG $$$,$$$,$$$,$$$.$$ (billions in his bank) and not the ones that were awarded.    James Cameron:  The Academy needed for personal/political/social reasons to give the awards to: a woman period... someone that has not been awarded period... some even said that it was something you said in the 1998 ceremony.  Well whatever excuse I've heard or read in the news just don't mind them and keep the good work, because you're excellent and perfect in what you do and you do it flawlessly.
B001KVZ6FW|1.0|I have three deaf children in the house, and I am outraged that this movie came without English Subtitles, I thought something was wrong with my DVD till another person told me the same, what a wonderful movie and yet my kids could not watch it, how dare they.
0739367676|5.0|With the holidays coming my time is limited for burying my nose in a book, so I decided to give this audio version a try.  Since I already read the book some time ago, this was another venue to hear the story that I was already familiar with.  I have no complaints.  It's a great way to pass a long ride to work in the AM and home in the PM.  I am a Twilight fan ,  so this was a great way to get into MORE of the story.  Amazon comes thru as usual...thanks!!
0385342020|5.0|Having been a huge fan of SK's since the infamous Shopaholic books, I had to read this one. Well, it's great. I am so glad the author went this way and really expanded her creativity. If you're interested in a great, quick read--for a plane ride, etc.--this is a must have!
B00164KYV4|5.0|I must confess I love chick flicks and I really love romantic comedies.  SHHHH..And I am a guy don't tell.  I sat down and watched this movie and I must say these are some real situations.  Someplace and somewhere you have been in these situations on both sides.  It's funny but it is very serious at times.  I laughed at the blunt, sometimes cruel behavior of men in this movie.  Yes I have done some of these things.  And I laughed at the behaviors of the women who just can't get it right.  Gigi was a little bit overboard though but I know people exist like that.  The one thing that stuck out in this movie was Scarlett Johansson's character.  I meet women like this every day.  I work with a ton of them.  She had a perfectly good guy, who adored her, standing right in front of her and she totally overlooked him.  I hear the same women complaining that they can't find a good guy meanwhile I know what they did.  It's a shame.  Sometimes people can't get out of their own way.  Good realistic romantic comedy.  It's not one of those clown funny movies with stupid antics and situations.  It's reality.  And that's what's funny about this movie.<br /><br />Oh, women can be cruel as well.  They don't touch on that in this movie but it does happen.<br /><br />If you like Romance with some humor, try this movie.  It took me awhile to watch but I was not disappointed.
B00001QEE6|5.0|This movie was a gift.  The person that got it has watched it twice all eady.  sHe likes it.
B001GCUO16|4.0|Overall the movie was quite a thriller.  Although quite a few of the digital enhancements were quite noticeable, the movie itself was good.  It fills in the information of who he was before he joined the XMEN and even before he lost his memory.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I just loved her CD and have followed her story from day one and what a story!     I love her voice and wish her the best and hope for more albums.
B001AQR3E4|5.0|This movie tells the story of vampires from a vampires point of view.  Moving through the ages without aging and never dying.  Lonely and cold.  Also tells the story of the vampire Lestat- who is names in many other vampire movies... namely Queen of the Damned. This is a must for the vampire fan to have in their collection.
B002MW50KO|1.0|Awful - sounds like he's croaking though the broken end of a Coke bottle!<br />Why did he do it, he must be worth a billion bucks by now?<br />Guess there are limits to genius after all.
B002K0WBYG|5.0|I am a big Sandra Bullock fan.  The role she took in this movie just adds to her allure.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|I'm reviewing the Black and White movie only.    It perfectly represents what the movie is and what it should be.  No excessive DNR, no blown out whites, just a perfectly balanced presentation with good film grain throughout.    It looks exactly the way it should, and that merits 5 stars in my book.
0061537969|5.0|I loved this book.  I read the first 100 pages the first night and finished it the next night.  Just couldn't put it down.  It's a very \\"easy\\" read and I appreciated that.  I love dogs but watching car racing would be torture.  Didn't matter because the car racing part was still interesting and full of some valuable lessons.  This book really made me think about things in different ways, it contains good advice about how we all might better live our lives.  It's touching, believable, made me laugh, made me cry.  I think the best guage in deciding if a book is good is by how it makes you feel and I felt the heights of many emotions.  I don't quite understand the bad reviews.  Most of them didn't even read it all so I guess that would be part of the problem.  This is one of my favorite books.
B002NVTBOU|5.0|This is the most recent album of Concha Buika. Her voice is amazing and very distinctive. A flamenco voice with a jazzy trail, the combination is great. On top of that Chucho Valdez with his talent!!!
B001BTG3OQ|5.0|I've been using my new SB-900 with a Nikon D3S and have great results.  I previously used an SB-800 and liked that unit very much.  I had not heard anything about the thermal cutoff until reading a couple of reviews on Amazon, so I gave my unit a test.  I could not duplicate any cutoff problem.  I use it as delivered and did not turn off any thermal protection.  I fired it multiple times and it recycled very quickly and never hesitated.  The recycle time is faster than my SB-800 with the extra battery add-on.
0446613444|4.0|Connelly has been a popular writer of detective stories for awhile now, still cranking them out in several character series, but he seems to be coasting lately, not always investing sufficient time in his plots or in the bits of \\"business\\" that add verisimilitude to the story. It's a common hazard for a successful popular author. But the earlier stories, including this second one in the Harry Bosch series, are gold. Bosch, ex-tunnel rat in Vietnam and now an LAPD homicide detective, has been yanked from Parker Center and shuffled off to the Hollywood Division as punishment for his actions in the previous case. He's trying to close a couple of cases for the end-of-year statistics and gets caught up in the apparent suicide of a narcotics sergeant in a crappy motel room. Or maybe it's really a homicide. And then that death ties into one of his other cases, and then another one. And then he discovers yet another cop is involved. And it all ends up requiring Harry to make a journey down to Mexicali, where he finds himself in yet another kind of operation. Everything in the plot happens gradually and convincingly, dragging the reader along through the underside of Los Angeles and the barrios of Baja. Connelly has the atmosphere and the lingo down pat and we get into Harry's head and learn more about his background as the story progresses. It's absorbing and absolutely realistic. And there's a terrific twist ending that I admit I didn't see coming --  though the clues are there, in retrospect. If Connelly still wrote them this way he'd have the market sewed up.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|We saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out and could hardly wait till it would be available on DVD.  There is so much action that this movie is exciting to watch again and again.  Every time we watch it again we catch something new.  Great action movie.
0788861948|5.0|Nice season! This item is great, I have it since last year and no problems yet.
B0002OERI0|1.0|I guess after having the displeasure of hearing this the message is:  You'd have to be an American idiot like the members of Green Day to like this.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I've been a fan of Nathan Fillion for many years from Buffy, Firefly and Serenity, so I had to check out Castle. I first saw it on network TV, and am very happy to be able to review favorite episodes on DVD. My only regret is that it wasn't released on Blu-ray. Nathan plays Rick Castle, a playboy writer who gets involved with the police when a copycat killer's targets mimic some of the murders in his books. I'll let you read the general synopsis for more details so I don't give too much away. One of the best parts of this show is the great relationship between Rick and his daughter, Alexis (Molly Quinn). Finally, a portrayal of a normal, happy, intelligent teenager on a TV program! There are many other interesting characters, including a couple guest roles by Buffy alumni. Nathan is witty, campy and dashing as ever in this well-written show. If you're following him on Twitter, you know that there are some Firefly/Serenity references in this show, along with Nathan's trademark \\"Feed the Birds\\", (FTB), and \\"Bam, said the lady\\".
B002NPUCRQ|5.0|This is Tylor's best album yet.  Her best song is/was \\"Crazier\\" but is not on this album.  She seems less of a \\"Tween Boy Crazy\\" girl here and having turned 20 last Sunday (12/13) its about time.  This album is very well done and her best yet.  The included DVD is also very well done, but attempting to pluck Tween heart strings, I suppose to help gain popularity.  Taylor is an adult now and hopefully not trying to relive the past with her latest fling.  Taylor has a beautiful voice that sets her well and is great for listening.  She is also a super performer.
0385504225|2.0|I will admit that I enjoyed the premise of this novel and even enjoyed the writing up until a certain point.  However, the ancient treasure hunting that we hoped for took a backseat to scientific discovery.  From that point on, book became a bit too outlandish and the build up for the massive discovery gave way to a seriously disappointing ending. I had hoped for a Da Vinci Code/National Treasure hybrid, but was left very disappointed.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I bought these dvds being aware they could not be working in the European system. On the contrary I can perfectly watch them, both on the dvd reader, which is set only for zone 2, and on the pc.  As  I read in some reviews I confirm the two movies are included. The oversea shipping was also very quick!
B001NFNFNA|5.0|After seeing this movie I was struck most by two things: Angelina Jolie is a great actress and it's a terrible tragedy what happened to the woman whom she portrays in this movie. I don't know what percentage of the movie is accurate, but the fact it is based on a true story is disturbing. While there are some moments of hope, much of the movie tends to be gut-wrenching. If you like really good dramas which give a realistic depiction of a person's hardships and struggles, give this movie a try. By the end I really felt for the mother at the center of the story.    It wasn't bad enough that Christine Collins (the single mother portrayed by Jolie) had her only son Walter abducted, the police went and made things ten times worse. The corrupt Los Angeles police department in the 1920s already had a bad reputation so some officials did anything they thought might prevent further embarrassment. They claimed to have found Walter and reunited him with his mother; however, as soon as Christine saw the boy, she said it wasn't her son. The police chief coerced her into taking the boy home and ignored her continued pleas for help with finding her real son. The chief insisted the boy was Walter despite physical evidence to the contrary. When Christine, with the help of a local minister (played by John Malkovich), starts to make trouble for the police, the chief has her put away in an asylum, declaring her crazy. Only after the uncovering of a serial killer and a gruesome crime scene are the police forced to confront the issue again. Even with the discovery, many questions remain.    Hearing the screenplay was written by J. Michael Straczynski, whose sci-fi series \\"Babylon 5\\" is among my favorites, I was curious how his dramatic work would be and found it was impressive. His writing did justice to the story, evoking sympathy and keeping you guessing throughout. Clint Eastwood is a wonderful director and had a quality cast to work with that also included Amy Ryan as a prostitute who was another victim of the police department. The highlight though is Jolie who gives a truly heartfelt performance. After seeing this, one can easily make an argument she deserved an Oscar.
B000MRAAJM|1.0|Ordered the Blu-ray \\"Planet Earth: The Complete BBC Series\\" on November 30, 2009. GoHasting said they shipped it on 12/01/09. I did NOT receive it. You are not allowed to contact the company except by email. They don't respond! They already have your money. They don't send your order. You're basically screwed. When I inquired with Amazon Customer Service they said that I should have NEVER orderd from GoHastings because they have a BAD TRACK RECORD. How was I to know that? They said any company under 97% should NOT be trusted. Buyer beware. Don't get ripped off like I did. I have not had any problems ordering direct from Amazon so if you want to have a Merry Christmas then don't do business with GoHastings.

B0000714BP|5.0|This is a totally different type of role for both Patrick Swayze and Wesley Snipes. It shows the drag queen backstage and that there is much more to them than what you see on the surface.  It also depicts an acceptance in a small town that may not be real but certainly should be.  This is definitely one I will watch over and over.
B00125WAWS|5.0|This movie is an excellent depiction of some of the atrocities that occurred in the south during the last century.

B0002HYHSW|5.0|We purchased 3 Haba games for our 4 year old daughter this Christmas: This one, Animal Upon Animal, and Socken Zochen.     Something that really makes this game stand apart from the others is that it leaves adults and kids on a pretty level playing field. Hands down, the best feature of this game is its accessibility to very young children, without the detriment of having to dumb down the play to allow them to win. My youngest - 23 months - can even join in on the fun. She does tend to 'lose' most times, being a bit more clumsy (sometimes intentionally) with the pieces, but since winning and losing are moot concepts at her age, she's hardly heartbroken over this matter, and often delights in seeing the pieces collapse. Other times, a game where we include her can actually go on for a good bit, depending on her mood.    The game consists of the wooden ring, 27 6\\" long sticks in vary widths: 9 large width blue sticks, 9 medium width red sticks, and 9 thin yellow sticks, and a die with two sides yellow, two sides blue, two sides red. The gameplay is simple. Grab all the sticks together, slide the wooden ring around the center of the bundle, give it a twist, and stand it up. This procedure is not easily manageable by a young child, and must be done by an adult. It's also worth mentioning that the game must be played on a cloth or carpeted surface as the sticks are liable to slide on a slick surface like a table with as small a movement as the roll of  the die.     The game begins by rolling the die, pulling out the corresponding piece, and taking turns back and forth this way until the structure collapses. A caveat to this rule is if you roll a color that would surely topple the whole thing you can forfeit your turn, returning a piece of the same color and point value to the box. If all the pieces of the color you roll are already drawn, you may chose any color.     At the end of the game, assuming you make it to the end, which is the point that 3 sticks are left standing and all others have been drawn, you tally the score for each player based on the worth of the sticks. Blue are 3, red are 2, and yellow are 1.    This game reminds me of a combination of advanced pick-up sticks, and booby trap (or hens and chicks as some might know it) because of the multi-colored pieces and the corresponding difficulty in removing large pieces versus small.    It's a great concept. Easy to play, difficult to master. Because the balance of skill isn't skewed toward the adult, I don't feel I have to pace myself to give my daughter a fair chance. Because the integrity of the stack is reliant on all moves played, once it becomes unstable it's anyone's guess who will topple it. I bring the pile crashing down as often as the kids do. Which of course, makes this a great deal more fun to play than many preschool-aged games for mom and dad.    All told, I think this is a fantastic little game. And, of course, I love that is made in Germany, not China.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|Gotta watch it!!    ITs a movie that will amke you laugh, cry, make you sad and or happy.  It will take you through all emotional levels.  Old FLick but quality history.    Based on the true events of a French Prisoner.    Dustin hoffman was Brilliant!!  and Steve McQueen!!    Good one
B002LFPAUC|5.0|In addition to the new commentary and special features included in this set (mentioned in other reviews), I also wanted to note that I found the DVD remastering is somewhat better than that in the [[ASIN:B00005LC1H Fawlty Towers - The Complete Series]] set, which I also owned and watched several times.  And if you're still watching FT on VHS, you really must upgrade!  The colors and sharpness look like a live broadcast.<br /><br />There are 6 episodes on each of 2 discs, and each of these include 2 alternate commentaries to choose from (each series' director or Cleese), in addition to the normal mono audio track.  A third disc contains interviews and a couple of other features which are well-documented in other reviews or in the item description here on Amazon.  I was glad to see the extended interviews, as the 'Complete' set seemed to have less interview content from the other actors than this 'Remastered' set.  The top menu animations and artwork are also inspired -- BBC did a good job of this, and I wish other DVD labels would invest a little more in their products this way.  The beginning of each disc does have a couple of long leaders of information which you have to \\"next chapter\\" through if you don't want to see it, because the \\"menu\\" button will not otherwise take you to the menu until you've been forced to watch it.<br /><br />If you already have the previous 'Complete Series' set mentioned above and are wondering if it's worth upgrading, I think real Fawlty fans have to, just for the extra special feature content alone.  If you ware just looking a good DVD version of the 12 episodes, either version would probably suffice, although this latest version currently seems to be less expensive when purchased new.  I cannot help wondering if BBC did this remaster to also prepare for a blu-ray version one day (or some such HD standard), but for the $26 Amazon price when I ordered, it just didn't seem worth waiting for any potential HD release.<br /><br />Oh, and did I mention this is probably (arguably) the best television sitcom ever devised?ably (arguably) the best television sitcom ever devised?
B000VBIGD6|5.0|National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation . . . what can I say? It's a comedy classic! It's yet another film that you can enjoy during the holiday season. It's also the best National Lampoon motion picture that features the Griswolds. It has a cleverly written script, interesting characters, and the true definition of family gatherings (well, maybe not ENTIRELY true, but true nonetheless). But I think the best part of this film is the humor. There are so many sight gags and witty dialogue that anyone can remember off the top of their heads. The most memorable scenes include bringing the humongous Christmas tree into the house, the dry turkey, the squirrel, the awkward talk with a female salesperson, and of course, \\"s****er was full!\\". While it may not be one of my all-time favorite films, it's still one of the greatest Christmas films of all time. You can watch it along with It's A Wonderful Life, A Christmas Story, Miracle on 34th Street, Elf, Home Alone, A Charlie Brown Christmas, Scrooge, Scrooged, A Garfield Christmas, How The Grinch Stole Christmas, etc etc etc etc etc etc etc.<br /><br />Grade: A

B001AVCFJM|5.0|Sure, the video arrived with incredible speed from Amazon.  AND having seen the movie originally in theaters, I now have my own personal copy of James T. Kirk as a juvenile delinquent!  The actors played true to the characters that WE, first generation Trekkers, came to love.  A movie like this makes a strong case for reviving the series for TV.  MY only problem with this DVD package, is that I'm not sure about the Digital Copy Disc.  Not sure if it's supposed to burn a copy of the movie to my hardrive, or just the \\"background info\\" like games, actor info, etc. For me, there wasn't enough info about THAT disc, but that COULD be my own technological ignorance.   ANYWAY, the movie was fantastic, the ordering process and shipping incredible.  Another satisfied customer of Amazon.com!
B0026P3G12|5.0|Excellent CD, beautiful music, terrific voice.  Just wish I could have seen her as she was singing.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I knew the cd would be good but I could not believe how wonderful it truley was when my wife and I heard it the first time.  Ms. Boyle has such a clear voice and crafts the songs with grace.  I was especially pleased to see the range of songs that she sang.  This is a must cd for everyone accept maybe Lambert fans.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|I was completely blown away by this movie when I saw at the theatre earlier this year. First time director Duncan Jones has crafted a masterful sci-fi classic in the same league with Blade Runner, 2001, Solaris, Alien and Silent Running. Yes, it's that good. What's more amazing is that he did this on a $5 million dollar budget but you would never know that by how it looks. The lunar landscape is amazing! Sam Rockwell gives one of his finest performances in this film and the story is engrossing. How I rank my favorite movies is if they move me in some way and also would it be something I would want to watch again. For this film it is yes to both. Every movie I saw this year I kept saying to myself is it better than Moon and I keep answering no. This was my favorite movie of 2009 and I hope (although it won't) that it is recognized by the Academy.

B000VD5I94|2.0|I'm not going to comment on the movie itself because I'm assuming if you bought the Blu-ray you are already a fan.    If I had paid more than $9.99 for this disk I would be upset. The picture quality is no better than my old VHS tape. I have other movies that are just as old or older that have been transferred to Blu-ray with much better success. Buy the Blu-ray version because you like the movie itself, not because you want to see a more eye popping picture.
B000P12LWY|4.0|I love the Tudors - the real ones. But these are pretty darn good too. Oh, sure, the show is just hysterically historically inaccurate - from the events to the people to some of the costumes. And obviously Henry did not look like that - but by golly he should have. He was supposed to be extremely attractive in his youth, as is Mr. Rhys Meyers - and that's accuracy enough for me in that department.( I'm waiting to see how he does in the obese,limping \\"Elvis,What Happened\\" portion of the Henry saga though.) And while the costumes are sometimes off by about sixty years or more, they are gorgeous with a capital Gorge and do express the lavishness of the court costume of the time. As for the history, well it certainly goes completely awry at times - however, the Tudor period courtier relationships and the world politics and religious reformation were hugely complicated so perhaps the writers are just trying to make it fit into an hour a week. And while Mr. Rhys Meyers may not look like the real Henry, he does a pretty good job of capturing his appeal, his self-centeredness, his heir-conditioning trouble, and his sincere belief that each wife is \\"the one\\" for about five minutes. I think this screen version of Anne Boleyn is probably fairly accurate as to character and motivation, and I think Natalie Dormer eats up the scenery in the part. I hate to see her go. So, anyway, if you're searching for a documentary, keep looking. If, however, you're looking for sumptuous costumes, attractive characters, interesting stories, and a little old-fashioned Tudorporn - dive right in,baby, the water is fine!
0470477237|5.0|Social media is changing the way we do business. Consumers, not the companies now hold the power.  Erik's book is an entertaining and informative read on social media tools, why you need them and how to apply them to your business.<br /><br />What I particularly liked about this book:<br /><br />--Key point summary at the end of each chapter.<br />The summary makes it easy to quickly reference topics covered.  It also helps to reinforce what you just read.<br /><br />--Concrete examples of companies that stuck to the old ways and companies that tried the new ways.<br />The Scrabulous vs. Scrabble exchange is a classic case of what happens when a company tries to completely control the marketing message.  The Agarwalla brothers created Scrabulous, an online version of Scrabble, At its peak, Scrabulous had over 500,000 daily Facebook users. Hasbro, the creator of Scrabble, sent a cease and desist letter to the brothers.  Hasbro created their own online version, but their version only had 2,000 Facebook users.  Erik challenges the reader to think about what might have happened if Hasbro collaborated with the Agarwalla brothers instead of fighting them.<br /><br />--Examples that dispel common myths about social media.<br />My favorite example is Erik's debunking of the myth that \\"social media is a waste of time.\\"  When you're waiting in line somewhere, what better way to spend your time than communicating with your social network, asking questions about products, getting status updates, etc.<br /><br />--Discussion of search engine results and how they could be made even better.  Erik talks about the difficulty of a company alerting consumers to a specific sale event via search.  There is no easy way to update the web with the latest pricing information.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to everyone wanting to better understand social media and how it impacts business.
B001EO748M|4.0|Wow! Ms. Dormer acted circles around everyone in this season, but then she had the best material too. Still, great job! I really hate to see her go. And the writers actually did clean up their act a little this season as far as accuracy goes. A lot less sex this season, but then treason trials, miscarriages, heretic burnings and royal beheadings don't really add up to effective foreplay - or at least not in Texas. (I've never been to England.) But much more actual history than previously and a lot more character development. All in all, a great season, with an extremely moving final episode.

B002VPE1AM|2.0|This thing will no doubt win those special effects, cinematography, etc. awards, but please, its a B movie plot and dialog that you might expect to see on the Scifi channel, in fact the dialog is almost unbearable at times.  Sigourney Weaver's character was terrible, nothing like her parts in Alien.  The only part of the movie that I thought was effective was the battle scene at the end, but you have to wade through 2 hours of crap before you get to that part.      Something odd about the 10ft blue people, are we to believe that all the males and females in a tropical forest setting could be runway model perfect?  All the males are thin and muscled and all the females are thin and small breasted(old and young).      Something odd about the costumes to, I have seen enough documentaries about indigenous tribes in tropical settings and the women don't typically wear anything covering their breasts, and I never really saw any thongs on them either.  You would expect that a creature with a tail would be more animal like and not have the modesty these creatures showed.  Even shooting for PG-13 they could have had a little more realism here and there.      There was a blatant ripoff of Eragon(winged flying thing that gets chosen for life).  The only thing that would have saved this mess is to have toned out the bad language(which added nothing to the movie anyway) and made it a PG rated kids movie.  All in all, 2 hours 40 minutes and $10 wasted.

B000NJVWUA|5.0|Ammonia Avenue is one of the best, most listenable albums of the 1980s. While the thematic approach is less evident than on other albums by Alan Parsons, there is not a single weak song. Particular highlights are Don't Answer Me, Prime Time and Ammonia Avenue. Don't Answer Me is one of the most tuneful songs that Alan Parsons and Eric Woolfson ever wrote.     The remastered sound is exceptionally good. This is due both to technical expertise and the involvement of Alan Parsons himself. While some older albums actually sound less good when stripped of the fuzz, the works of the Alan Parsons Project gain in crispness and clarity due to their instrumentation and electronic sounds. I would not buy this CD for the bonus tracks, though they are interesting and varied. I particularly liked the Shadows inspired version of You Don't Believe.
B0026OE2O8|3.0|If you are the type of person that doesn't like to be lectured, avoid this video.   While the photography was quite good, the non-stop enviro-badgering had me turning off  the T.V. half way through. I learned that we should protect the environment from the  type of people that would waste precious natural resources making this show....   Update, watched it again and it's not as bad the second time. Very good panoramic shots.  I guess I'm still bothered that there were parts of the narration that warned about overpopulation.  Yes, it's a problem but exactly what can I do about it? I suppose that lectures about issues beyond my control  really are annoying.

0805091742|5.0|Amazon's December Book of the Month summary describes the author's mission of revolutionizing the \\"to-do list...without programmatic steps or tables to help reshuffle daily tasks.\\"  One may infer from this recap that this is a how-to-self-improvement book for making one more productive, more efficient and less stressed - this couldn't be farther from the core message of this book.    The author's key message is that the volume and complexity of knowledge today has exceeded any single individual's ability to manage it consistently without error despite material advances in technology, boatloads of more training and super-specialization of functions and responsibilities.  Yet, despite demonstrating that checklists produce results, there is resistance to their use because of the (1) Master of Universe mentality (Rock Star; Fighter Pilot; Hero), (2) our jobs are too complex to reduce to a checklist, (3) checklists are too rigid and don't force us to look up and see and think ahead of what's in front of us.  Yet, in a complex environment, he states that experts are up against 2 difficulties - the fallibility of human memory when it comes to mundane, routine matters that are easily overlooked under the strain of more pressing events and secondly, people can lull themselves into skipping steps even when they remember them - after all certain steps don't always matter...until one day they do.  Gawande makes a persuasive case in his book as to why you should develop and implement a process checklist for critical processes/decisions.    * Whether you are from the medical field or not, you will benefit from the inspiring thinking and insights.      * This book is game changing - a call-to-action for generating better results despite the pull to run with intuition or gut instinct.  If you are implementing via intuition rather than a systematic process, this book's message will force you to pause in your tracks to seek a more disciplined approach.    * The author uses a wide range of industries to make his case using an engaging blend of anecdotes, storytelling and research - from healthcare to aviation (US Airways 1549 landing in Hudson River) - - to high-end award winning restaurants - - to building massive office skyscrapers and shopping centers - -to setting up a Van Halen rock concert - - to FEMA's response to Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans - - to money managers making investment selections.    * Can be read in 1-2 sittings.  Page Turner.  Fully engaging and riveting until the last page is turned.    * Author's determination, authenticity, inspired thinking, modesty and willingness to disclose personal mistakes makes this an inspirational book.  Both brilliantly written and a pleasure to read.    My favorite excerpts:    \\"Despite showing (hospital) staff members of the benefits of using the checklist, 20% resisted stating that it was not easy to use, it took too long and felt it had not improved the safety of care.  Yet, when asked an additional question - would you want the checklist to be used if you were having an operation - a full 93% said yes.\\"    \\"In a world in which success now requires large enterprises, teams of clinicians, high-risk technologies, and knowledge that outstrips any one person's abilities, individual autonomy hardly seems the ideal we should aim for. ..what is needed, however is discipline...discipline is hard - harder than trustworthiness and skill and perhaps even than selflessness.  We are by nature flawed and inconstant creatures.  We can't even keep from snacking between meals.  We are built for novelty and excitement, not for careful attention to detail.  Discipline is something we have to work at.\\"    \\"We don't study routine failures...when we look closely, we recognize the same balls being dropped over and over, even by those of great ability and determination.  We know the patterns.  We see the costs.  It's time to try something else.  Try a checklist.\\"    \\"We're obsessed in medicine with having great components, the best drugs, the best devices, the best specialists - but pay little attention to how to make them fit together well\\"\\"    \\"It somehow feels beneath us to use a checklist, an embarrassment.  It runs counter to deeply held beliefs about how the truly great among us - those we aspire to be - handle situations of high stakes and complexity.  The truly great are daring.  They improvise.  They do not have protocols and checklists.  Maybe our idea of heroism needs updating.\\"

B001UV4XUG|2.0|Although it is commendable that 500 Days does not rely on action such as explosions, crashes, and chases, the movie is completely reliant on the quality of the screenplay which falters in critical aspects. Your first clue as to the script deficiencies is the voice over. Although the voice over is not constant, it is irritating whenever it occurs and red flags holes in the script. Although the idea of skipping randomly between dates in the relationship between the 2 main characters is clever in principle, it is overused and gets monotonous as the movie drones on. About halfway through, you get fidgety and start looking at your watch. Perhaps the most critical failure is the 180 degree shift in Summer's character by the end of the movie. The first 90% of the movie gives a detailed character study of a woman who is independent and doesn't believe in quaint concepts like love at first sight which is refreshing if not perfectly written. The final part of the movie totally undermines the first 90% which so painstakingly created Summer's character. To cap off the disappointment with Summer, the male lead just happens to find a new perfect love of his life named Autumn just as the movie ends. It is far too pat and indicates that the writers (or studio) simply chickened out and wanted a totally unconvincing happy ending. You feel cheated and duped at the end which is never a good thing after investing more than 90 minutes.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|This has pretty much everything I would want in a live DVD.  Excellent material, outstanding musicianship, terrific editing of the filmed material.    Usually bands that assemble recordings by playing and singing in short bursts and then combining them have trouble bringing what they do to the stage.  Dream Theater is an exception to this.   Are the songs the same as on the recording? NO  Are they still stunningly well done? YES    They are tight, superb players, and vocally excellent.  I have now watched this concert over 10 times and am still finding it riveting and seeing new examples of their greatness.    My personal favorite is the Instrumedley.  12 minutes of solo and ensemble instrumental parts from DT and various side projects.    Visually arresting and superbly played.  I'm pretty much out of hyperbole so go get it, NOW!!
B0019LY5IM|3.0|What has happened to the Blu-Ray releases of Lost? When Season 3 first came out on Blu-Ray it came in a great box. Inside the box was the actual plastic case that held the discs. Inside of the case was a insert that told the name of the episodes and which disc they were on. As a matter of fact every release of Lost either on DVD or Blu-Ray has had the inserts in them. Well guess what Season 5 has. It has 2 inserts of which both are advertisements. Why not have a insert with the episode listings? I paid $60 for this and it is just a bare bones version. The show is great. But this regular Blu-Ray version sucks.
B002P5XXR0|4.0|I've been a fan of James Horner since he wrote the score for [[ASIN:B000001P0Q Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan]]. I think \\"For the Love of a Princess\\" from [[ASIN:B00135EUPC Braveheart]] is probably the most beautiful love theme I've ever heard, and that includes the classics. The problem for a lot of people is that Horner borrows from both himself and the classics, so you'll probably hear shades of [[ASIN:B0000029YC Titanic]] and other film scores that he's done previously in this CD. It doesn't bother me, and if it doesn't bother you, I recommend this score just for general good listening.<br /><br />Thematically it's not a good standout collection, but I have my personal favorite tracks. I particularly enjoy \\"Pure Spirits Of The Forest,\\" \\"The Bioluminescence Of The Night,\\" and \\"Becoming One Of 'The People' / Becoming One With Neytiri.\\" \\"Shutting Down Grace's Lab\\" has a little too much Middle Eastern-style wailing for my taste, and in my opinion they're just trying too hard with \\"I See You\\" to create another smash hit like \\"My Heart Will Go On.\\" Frankly I would have axed \\"I See You\\" completely, and have not put it on any of my playlists. \\"The Destruction Of Hometree\\" was overly dramatic in the context of the film and contributed to the cliched story for me, but on its own is an OK track.<br /><br />This is a nice score to play in the background while you're doing something else, but most won't be awe-inspired, and may find Horner's repetition from previous works irritating. I like listening to it to inspire my own fantasy writing since it does have a generic quality to it. Hence, four stars from me, but your mileage may vary. Take advantage of the preview tracks, or go see the film and pay attention to the music to decide if this is right for you. This one is going to be very subjective for a lot of people and I definitely recommend trying before buying.

B001FB4W0W|5.0|I bought this as a gift [[ASIN:B001FB4W0W True Blood: The Complete First Season (HBO Series)]] for my 17 yr. old vampire/werewolf addicted daughter.  The dvds arrived before the delivery date in perfect condition.  Thank you so much wholesale deals.  I will definately be doing business with you again very soon.

B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Classics are made to watch again and again and the best is in Blu-ray. This is a MUST for Disney lovers. I can't wait for more Disney classics to be available in Blu-ray.
0385504225|2.0|We're on a Road to Nowhere . . . come on inside.  Taking that ride to nowhere . . . we'll take that ride.  Yep, this book was a Road to Nowhere.  Absolutely absurd.  A totally empty and disappointing ending to a supposed \\"thriller.\\"  It took me a month of on-again, off-again reading to make it through the first half of the book.  Finally I committed to plowing through the rest and seat-belted myself to the couch until I finished it. Thus the second star.   Ugh.  Just typing this review is heightening my frustration over this book.  So regardless of the depth of redunculous thought I could share about the one-dimensional characters, silly plot, empty premises and repetitive literary devices, I think I'll just stop now.
B002MBAJ4M|5.0|Warren is still making me make faces when he plays his guitar.  It doesn't get any better than that. This is classic mule music!!  If your a mule fan you'll know what that means.
1933308087|5.0|This book is packed full of quilt blocks!  The pages are so soft you want to keep reading.  I received this as a gift and this is something I will treasure-what a great book.  Every quilt library should have this book on the shelf.
B002SJIO54|1.0|This was the dumbest lamest movie I have ever seen.<br />It was shot in the way of a documentary. It reminded me allot of another stupid movie The Blair Witch.<br />The best parts of the movie were shown in the trailers so watch them.
B002R68U7K|4.0|Although it was well wrapped as a precaution, the box was scratched in on of its corners.
1577314808|5.0|If the answer is \\"yes\\", and if you're willing invest $10 in the cost of the book, but most importantly, some personal time and energy into understanding and practicing the teachings of the book, then read on.    Perhaps you're questioning the usefulness of a book such as this one.  My way of looking at it is that this book offers a solution to a problem --- the problem of you being overwhelmed by your mind.  Do you find yourself often being overtaken by your thoughts and emotions?  Do you find yourself trying to regain control by repressing those thoughts and feelings, only to be overtaken by them time and time again?  Perhaps you don't have this problem, or perhaps you don't think it's a problem at all.  If that's the case, this book is useless to you, for the first step towards finding a solution is recognition that you have a problem.      I have this problem.  I have what I can describe as an overactive mind.  I cannot seem to stop myself from thinking.  For years I prided myself on being able to think a step ahead of everyone, I've learned to be an expert planner and could anticipate problems before other people.  However, my mind has also become a source of great stress and anxiety.  I'm mostly a calm person, on the outside that is, but on the inside, I was dealing with a maelstrom of thoughts and emotions.  As Mr. Tolle correctly points out, our addiction to thinking is a \\"disease\\".  I thought I knew how to manage it, I thought I was doing my best, I thought it was impossible to do more.  That was until I picked up this book.    Without summarizing the book, which is hard to do, since the content itself is conceptual, here are some of the key truthes that I've derived from it:    - Happiness is possible: And you can attain it by practicing some of the techniques described in the book (and no, it's not money, not sex, not drugs, in fact you will see that you already have it).  - It's possible to control your thoughts and emotions.  - Repression is NOT control.What I also like a lot about this book is the author's suggestive and humble tone.  Mr. Tolle does not try to talk down on you as some higher being, whether, he pays a great deal of respect to human intelligence and individuality.  He's very reassuring in his words, letting you know again and again that you're your own master, that you're capable of enlightenment, and although he can show you the path, you must be the one to walk it.    If the book and the techniques do not seem to work well at first, or you get stuck along the way, have patience.  I have to continually tell myself this.  We as a race of species have learned to burden ourselves with thoughts and emotions for a long time, and it will TAKE a long time to undo some of the damages and contraints, before we can learn to free ourselves from our minds, but I have caught a glimpse of that happiness, that peace, and there is no going back for me.    Good luck all!
B002OEBMN4|4.0|The title track is gonna go down as a mosh pit classic. Overall, a great Slayer album. Personally, I'm a sucker for their old stuff like Reign, Hell Awaits, Show no Mercy, but this one is not shabby at all. Most of the tunes are fast, heavy, catchy-- the one tune that sounded more like from their Seasons in the Abyss days was \\"Playing with Dolls,\\" which I actually dig even though I didn't care for Seasons.<br /><br />The sound seems to have a bit too much treble, imo,  but is not overly distracting. Most of the songs are so good and in-you-face I can just imagine myself at a Slayer concert letting it all loose... great metal album.
0385532458|2.0|We chose this book for our book club because we've liked the other Grisham books we've read.  I was looking forward to this but I wish I hadn't wasted my time.  There was not 1 character in any of the stories that I liked.  VERY disappointed.
B0026P3G12|5.0|An absolute wonderful voice.  If an Angel has a voice, then this must be what it would sound like.
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|I have never listened to A-ha music before until I went on a New Zealand 747 in November.  I listened to their music program and found this great CD.  All I can say is that this is one of the best CD's I have ever heard.  I love all the songs on the CD.  Not too many CD's that can match up to that.
B00000G3PA|4.0|I'm glad someone had this movie!  I wanted to find a copy for my mom (and another for myself) for Christmas, but no one had it but Amazon.  Thanks!
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|Fantastic film in concept and execution.  Wonderfully acted.  More than one scene hit very close to home.  Just a question for those of you who have the blu-ray copy of this... What is with the conversations with Joe and Zooey feature?  Is it supposed to be very small and crammed into the corner of the screen?  I have a 46\\" screen and this feature was about 14\\" x 8\\" or something and crammed into the upper left corner.  Anybody else have this problem?
B0026P3G12|4.0|I'm very impressed with Susan's debut album.  I like the eclectic mix of genres that were chosen.  Susan has a great range and it shows in the pieces.  I was disappointed with a few of the arrangements, though.  For example, How Great Thou Art has more than just the refrain, it's a whole hymn- that's what makes it a great piece to do.  I did like the Madonna ballad- the lyrics are something I can relate to and the melody is as haunting as Susan's voice on the track.<br /><br />I can't wait to hear what Susan does next- hopefully another album with David Foster as producer?  Nothing against Simon, but I think David would do better with this genre.
B001KVZ6G6|1.0|I did not like this movie.  The beginning of the movie is very depressing, with hints toward the depressing factors all throughout the movie.  This made it very difficult to enjoy the movie.  Everyone that I've talked too that has seen the movie say the same thing.  The beginning is very sad, and so is the rest of the movie.  People who say it's uplifting obviously weren't really paying attention to what was happening on the screen in front of them.  The parts of the movie that were supposed to be funny really weren't funny enough to dispell the sadness of the movie.  Also the plot wasn't all that good.  Out of all the disney movies I've seen, this has to have possibly the worst overall story out of all of them.    If you have had mixed reports and feel like at least watching the movie to see if you like it, I would recommend renting the movie to see if you like it or not, although it is a very depressing movie.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Heard her on Tv and fell in love with her voice. The CD is beautiful.
B001UV4XUQ|5.0|Great Movie. It's not the kind of movie where you know what's going to happen. Well you know what's going to happen because they tell you, but you don't know how it's going to happen! Zooey Deschanel is adorable!
B0000DIJO2|5.0|I found this to be an excellent collection of songs with the same clear distinctive voices I have known to enjoy. This gives you the total concert experience. Only wish it was longer.Overall well put together.
B001RL4K1Q|4.0|\\"Trainspotting\\"(1996) is directed by Danny Boyle (Sunshine, Slumdog Millionaire). The film follows the lives of various friends who are all trapped in the world of drugs abuse. The film is hilariously conceived with the friends showing the degrees to which they are willing to go in order to support their addictions. Hallucinations abound with Mark (Ewan McGregor) diving into toilets for his stash, or seeing babies crawling on ceilings. Even though the film is generally very upbeat, and frenetic, there is always lurking around the corner the dark side of these individuals' lives.<br /><br />This particular blu-ray is a bit disappointing, if only because it is barebones. There are zero special features, and the film has not been remastered. Even though the blu-ray image quality is sharper than the DVD there really isn't a big improvement over the DVD version in this case.
1401323820|5.0|When I heard this book was being published I have to admit I was more than a little leery of it.  Tie-ins to TV shows and movies have been a disappointment in the past.  But I was pleasantly surprised by this book.  The plot moved quickly and you can definitely hear Richard Castle's voice coming through the characters.  I hope they continue to publish these books as Castle writes more of them on the show.
