B003NRYMZQ|5.0|I am a fan of British television and I enjoyed the show.  The humor was light and it had great characters.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|I like it. It gets more challenging as you go along.  The only thing I don't like is that there is no interaction with friends.
B001XUJMZK|5.0|Totally immerses me in the era and drama of the characters and events.  A true hero story in a world that needs them, even if only in a movie.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I love being able to easily access my Yahoo mail. It is so convenient for me rather than having to pull up Yahoo and go through hoops.  Love it.
B00AG297GK|5.0|The Dictator is a hilarious riff on Middle Eastern culture, misogyny, and ridiculousness.  If you like Sacha Baron Cohen's work, you will enjoy this crude yet entertaining film.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This is a very good app. Most things don't take a lot of time, so it's good for people who are a bit impatient. Aura is easy to earn and the quests aren't outrageous. This is a really awesome game. Also, it doesn't eat up battery, like a lot of games do. It's better than a lot of free apps I've seen. The gameplay can be a bit slow at times but it's worth it.
1616550414|5.0|Bought this for my husband as a Birthday present, and he loved it. This was very difficult to get a hold of, but I managed to get a copy :) This would be a great idea for art lovers and Zelda lovers as a &#34;complete your collection&#34; piece, and was a no-brainer for me to buy. The book has lovely artwork and sketches, but also includes interesting facts and uncovers a few little mysteries you may want to know about in the &#34;history of Zelda,&#34; if you are interested in behind the scenes happenings. Enjoy!
B004ELSDZK|2.0|The alien language and voice are too stupid for words. I hated this game even with the sound off it was still stupid
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|This game is not the one I thought it was but it's still a very good game. Lots of fun.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I have read the series. I love it. I really enjoyed the characters. And their struggles. Very creative. good read
B002ZG994U|5.0|This movie is very excellent, combining war/conspiracy themes with excellent elements of humor. I never saw any of the series on which this movie is based, but the movie itself is definitely one that I don't cease to enjoy. Definitely recommended.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Well worth purchasing. Tons of fun and challenging. I finished the game and wanted more levels. Hopefully more to come. A great job by this developer. Beautiful levels and well thought out.
B00003CXWV|5.0|Johnny Depp is phenomenal in this hard true story of the transformation of a young man trying to make easy money by selling marijuana, into a hardened criminal mixed up in the Colombian cocaine trade. There are several great actors in this movie and it really illustrates the story of the introduction of cocaine into the United States. Definitely a must-see.
B005OMOKN2|5.0|I needed a spare battery for our trip to France and Spain.  It fit neatly into the camera bag I bought with my new Nikon J1 camera.  It worked out great to change out the battery in just a couple of minutes while out seeing the sights in Barcelona.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I just loved this book. It was a smorgasbord of things.  It had humor, romance, great character personalities and I loved the ending. Though I cannot wait for the next book!  I loved how the story was told by Drew and that he was speaking right to you.  It was just perfect.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  Do the one click thing and get it today!
B009AMANH4|5.0|I loved this movie when I saw it in the theater.  Nothing quite like it.  I am a retired history teacher and simply had to buy this blue-ray combo pack to have in my personal collection.
B00571F26Y|5.0|The information in this book is well worth the money.<br /><br />If you are trying to lose 20 to 40 extra pounds buy this book and absorb the information.<br /><br />I found this book by accident and have recommended it to all my family members. Unfortuneately they have not followed the advice in the book. So...they remain fat. I've lost about 20 lbs in a few short months making small dietary changes. Additionally, my joints are no longer sore in the morning, and I actually feel about 20 years younger.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This is the greatest folk/rock singer since Dylan.  See the movie Searching for Sugar Man. His voice is hauntingly beautiful.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|How don't know how they do it, but I get drawn in to each episode like a kid to candy!!
0393343405|5.0|Best book for encapsulating the advent of the 'Modern&#34; world.  It is a great detective story and an excellent example of one scholar's persistence and enthusiasm for discovery.  I have recommended it to many, many people
B008133MDK|5.0|Best show on TV - watch these episodes over and over and can't get enough of Benedict Cumberbatch!  He's awesome!
B009NY43NY|2.0|Two star rating because she actually finished the series instead of leaving us hanging.  Two stars because there is a final book when I guess Charlaine Harris has made her money and now would rather enjoy it instead of writing a book, which we can all agree is very hard work.  Two stars because she wrote a book she had no interest in because she had made a commitment.<br /><br />The book is over priced for the quality of writing and story-telling that is contained in the pages.  The writing is half-hearted.  The story line is a mashed up mess.  And the whole bit of bringing back everyone who is still alive that has ever been in Sookie's fan base, regardless of how little the character adds to the story, is pretty lame.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any spoilers (never have understood how people can think that re-writing every detail in a book and giving everything away is a review), but I would suggest ... borrow a copy from someone dumb like me that bought a copy without reading a review, wait for a copy to show up at your library, or at the very least, wait for paperback.  Actually, I'd suggest, go back to one of the last books you really enjoyed in this series, re-read it, and stop there.<br /><br />And an honest rating would probably be one star.  But Charlaine Harris doesn't care what I think, or what you think, or even about these characters any more.  She's laughing all the way to the bank that we were dumb enough to keep buying these books.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I like it and it's so funny when he breaks his neck, but I have to start over, but you get better and better as you go
B007HACDLK|4.0|This was an exciting read.  I had a hard time putting it down.  I love Mitch Rapp!  I can hardly wait in between releases.  Give us more Mitch!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Well yeah it's so much fun! It's not exactly as fun as the one on the Xbox or the others, but it's way better than survival craft
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a page turner.  I kept pulling for the guy and she just kept switching the game! Highly recommend!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 8yo has this on her ipod and loves it. I added it on my Kindle Fire so that I could play it with my 5yo. She looks forward to taking care of our horde every day. My only complaint is that getting gems is too tough. The links earn them don't seem to work and you can't trade coins for them.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|This 'restored' version of the film looked as good as I remember the original looking in the theater!  Sharp, clear images and outstanding sound quality made me feel like I was watching it in the theater all over again.  I held off buying this title because I wanted to be certain I was going to get as good a version as possible and this version does not disappoint.  The music is still echoing in my head over two weeks after watching it!  I would highly recommend this version of Lawrence of Arabia to anyone seeking an excellent, high-quality version of this classic movie!!!
1423113497|4.0|I got this as a gift for my niece and she couldn't wait to open them.  We opened gifts on Christmas eve  and she had to open and start them that night before she went to bed.<br /><br />Of course I can't speak for the content but the tween loved the series.  I wish that it had all of the Percy Jackson books 4 and 5.  I had to purchase those separately.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|This video player has played every file I've thrown at it, several adjustable settings and good picture quality. Would highly recommend over anything else.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|There was nothing I didn't like about this movie, except a bare breast (brief).  If you want your family to appreciate each other more...watch this movie.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|My grandkids really like this game it's very entertaining for them! Keeps them very occupied while driving in the car.
B001NA6096|5.0|If you like your movies peppered with pyrotechnics, car chases, sex, violence and other sensory stimuli, you will hate this movie. But if you want to escape to a pleasant, sweet and romantic evening in Vienna, and feel what it's like to fall in love again, this is your flick.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game is awesome.....it reminds me of Chuzzle with a touch of Temple Run and old school retro fun...loved it!  Hope there's a part 2 or continuation soon.......
0937381888|5.0|It's complete or have everything I need to know to my brew beer at the first time.<br />Thank you very much. sir
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game has the most beautiful graphics!  Everyone can play this game. I know you'll love it too! It's like the &#34;R&#34; cube idea...but so much more!  Give it a try!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This app is great, but the smaller the screen is, the better it is. If you get this game on a device that is bigger than a kindle, it will be difficult. I highly recommend this for iPods or phones.
B008Y212PI|5.0|I have every one of these games!  This is my favorite though.  The graphics are lovely, and the challenge is always there for you too!  The more squares you want, the more of a challenge it is!<br /><br />When are there going to be more of these?
B009NY43NY|4.0|I have always enjoyed the maturity of the style - Charlaine Harris was an accomplished author before starting the the Sookie series. Some of the more recent popular series on Amazon seem to be more fan fiction than real novels, but in all of Ms Harris' work, the words don't get in the way of the story.<br /><br />This is typical Sookie Stackhouse, and I still appreciate that.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The OLD version was a great deal better than this one. This latest version - sticks. It's not a good change.<br />WEATHER CHANNEL!  Give us BACK OUR OLD VERSION!  Honestly!  Why do they keep \\"up-dating\\" something that works so well.  Download this, and then unload it!
B009NY43NY|4.0|They are silly books, but engrossing, and I enjoyed them all to varying degrees. This is the final Sookie Stackhouse book, so I had to read it since I've read all of the others.  It predictably delivers.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best version of the BIBLE that I've seen to date.  It's easy to move from place to place, make notes, highlight and so on. You can pick what version you want...like I have the NIV version.  There is an easy format. Be blessed!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Kept me wanting to read more. Wish I would have read it before seeing the movie though because I knew what the outcome would be
B00881VLCE|4.0|This has many cute puzzles.  I only wish the pieces in the tray on the right of the screen, were bigger!  I enjoy puzzles of all kinds, and this one is a challenge too!  The puzzles are not so hard, that you couldn't finish one while waiting for appointments, or watching an old movie.  Hey!  Pop some corn and enjoy this puzzle game!
B00CBQOEA8|5.0|Some where in my clutter house I own two copies of this CD.. well The remixes and the original disk.<br />This is a feel good cd with lots of music, that calms a busy day for me. This Cd she had many ballads which were reminiscent of  Mariah's first 3CD's.  I enjoyed the vocals on every song and that she re-sang for the remix tracks as well.<br /><br />Now, I say not a comeback because MIMI never went anywhere. 1. After the movie &#34;Glitter&#34; s and the sound track Which got a bad rap for being part of the movie. The &#34;Glitter Cd&#34; was strong and powerful with great songs done from the 80's with Mariah's twist. She has not left or taken 10 plus years to recover from her past issues. Mariah is an artist who has gained the freedom to play with her sound, she has earned that right from her 1st set after music box she has grown.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|HBO has a great tradition of television programs, and Game of Thrones fits well into this tradition. HBO is great.
B007TNQ7EY|2.0|I love this app but my evil sister cancelled my progress. I know Don't want to play because I'm to lay to start all over. I was wondering if you can make me go back to a level 8 __ and the last mission for chapter 3 which is the tank mission. Also can  you please make it if you cancel the game you still can keep your progress when you download it back. Please
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Starts off slow but you find yourself attached midway through. Sweet and sincere story that leaves you wanting romance and changes the way you view flowers from now on.
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book from the beginning to start, probably one of the best books I've ever read. I kind of wish I had just taken it from the library though, I read it in one night and have heard others say the same.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I loved this movie; found it a bit slow in the beginning but got caught up in it soon and was disappointed when it ended!  Looking forward to the next part!
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Ever since I got this kit I've been using it on all kinds of projects. Gameboys, Cameras, etc. I love it.
B00CIP57Z8|5.0|Really good movie thanks to the participation of Ohad Knoller whose is capable of expressing multifaceted emotions with his eyes. A little sad also because despite the possibly happy ending he really never let go of the past and his new love interest has no idea of the baggage he's bringing into their budding relationship.
B004GXHOGK|5.0|This fox has been made with excellent attention to detail. He is somewhat bendable rubber plastic. His eyes twinkle and he stands on a flat surface with all the feet touching.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great way to end a very long running series. After a few slow booms in the middle, this series seemed to get better and better towards the end. Brandon Sanderson did a great job wrapping this story up, for which I am very thankful as i've been reading this series for the last 21 years. I felt good about the way it ended.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like how the My Horse-app allows the user to have a nice realistic 3D pet horse of their own to care for but, often needs to be checked on at least twice a day, usually takes quite a bit of virtual money, & horse jumping tournament play to(accumulate/get)enough virtual money to properly care for your virtual 3D horse ;) So do you think your up for the challenge?
B00CWVFPGO|1.0|I have long been a Schwarzenegger fan.  I love his flicks and the huge personalities he inserts into them.  They always have lots of self-deprecating humor to counterbalance the bullets and blood.  But this outing is not up to par.  Clearly, Arnold has lost a step, but he concedes too much of his superhuman prowess.  Who needs an Arnold as a mere mortal?  The story is more than predictable, and the action seems contrived.  Co-stars do the best they can, but the script is pretty bad; familiar and overdone in all the most important places.  I don't mind suspending reality... but this?
B00A8ECU24|4.0|I think the MY LITTLE PONY-app game is a nice game to play even though it takes a very long time to progress throughout the game, it's free to play but, it contains in-game items that can be bought for real money though & I don't recommend getting carried away with that in-game feature or you could end up with financial trouble due to overuse of that function okay?
B000W4HIXQ|5.0|Bruce Willis is at it again! One of the better sequels in the series! Plenty of action<br />and excitement! You won't want to miss this one!
B000U6BT40|5.0|This was the best show. Not just on SciFi. The characters were great. They made you laugh,made you sad. You realy cared about them. They would come up with off the wall to get themselves in trouble. When the show was cancelled I was bummed for a while. Glad to see it is on Amazon Prime. I still have it programmed into my DVR hoping they will have another Christmas show or something. If you have never seen it, give it a shot.
B003O97W5K|5.0|Good stuff. Well made horror film from Steven Spielberg! Buy it, watch it, then, check your closets!<br />Be prepared to cover your eyes!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I can imagine life without this app.  I store all my important notes in one place and can the search and organize all my info
B008LSAP30|5.0|I never drink wine! I just watch great films from yesteryear! This is one of them!<br />Keep listening to the children of the night, and purchase this Blu-ray!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Great book. I had no idea that such a great scientific mind existed. Everyone should know about this great man's contribution to our evolution. Outstanding and motivational..
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My daughter has this game and I love playing it. So I purchased it for myself. I find it to be relaxing.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Even the artwork for the xs in the ads are cute and textured to match the graphics in the game. The sounds the pudding guys make is making me laugh too.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Highly recommended. By far the best fantasy books I've read so far. Fart is a funny word, don't ya think?
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Every week 6 new stages to be tackled whilst competing against your friends via facebook. Gives Angry Bird addicts a new fix!
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|It is a really fun and easy game. Easy to get the big money and all together a good game. But it does not really differ its self from any other kind of casual game.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|My Webroot antivirus for Kindle says that this is a threat.  &#34;Android.Ads.Plankton.B&#34;  I have removed it from my Kindle. .
B006YC74E8|1.0|I've downloaded this app twice and I'm still disappointed. It can't do anything on editing my photos.  It's confusing and from other 1 star reviews you can see that others had difficulties like their kindle freezing and I read how someone edited a photo and they didn't find where it saved to, or any option to save it to. It's a waste of time and space. Do not get it. On my old iPod I had an app called picstich, and it worked so good on editing and colleging pictures together in cool frames. I would recommend that but it's unavailable for KFHD.<br /><br />P.S. I would sooo give this a zero star rating, but I can't.
1475143389|5.0|By far one of the best fitness books. It gives you step by step instruction for the beginner as well advanced lifters
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|excellent game no lagging features or graphic problems i enjoy it because it is similar to a racing game but kind of different. i would recommend this game to many friends.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What can I say that anyone else hasn't said? I love this series and have enjoyed every minute. Every character is interesting, the acting superb, the setting fabulous, and the script compelling.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|The best relation app and l tried them all. This is the best by far.<br />l never slept this.good before!!!
B00499NHLC|5.0|I love this show!  I can not wait for season three!  Benedict Cumberbatch is wonderfully odd and riveting and Martin Freeman is fantastic.  Writing is smart and show is fast paced.  I would recommend it to anyone who loves a great mystery and twists and turns!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|If you're looking for a game to play for free this one is it.  Really good graphics and challenging enough to make it better than most free games.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game always have I'm just so happy that kindle finally got it. I played it before but now I can always have it.
B000I3UAJ0|2.0|The story line is slow and the special effects do not weather the years well. but, it is still nice to see our old friends again!
B008602KQI|4.0|Very accurate with the books! Hope the second and third are as good. A must watch for book fans! Enjoy
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've found SwiftKey to be much more accurate than the default swipe keyboard on my device, a Galaxy S3. Recommended!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great radar maps, best weather predictions.  Love the 36 hour and 10 day forecasts, and choice of city/zip code preferences.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|Having read Le Carre since Spy Who Came In From the Cold, this is his best work for many years. Good characters with complexity but not enough tangential references to require extensive flipping back to remind who's who. Very entertaining.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show. The plot line is so unpredictable. I feel like I have gone on a journey with all of the characters!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I have read all the Old Man's War novels before I obtain a copy of Redshirts.  While I am a really big fan of Star Trek (I grew up on the Classic Series in the 1960's), for some reason that must be age related, I did not connect the Redshirts on the original TV program to what was happening in the novel until half way through.  Yet I can say that I laughed so hard at parts that my side ached when it all started to come together.  I still chuckle at certain quotes.  As for the codas at the end, the third one was worth the price of the entire book.  Just as I would rate Old Man's War a five star novel, so I must do the same here.  Yet I will admit that some may not like the storyline or the way it is written.  The reviews reflect an interesting split.  I personally take that as a sign of a very good author who produced a product that can actually cause people to argue over just how funny the storyline is or how serious they should take the codas.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Think they overplayed some of the parts of the movie and also the sexual overtones were a bit much.  Think the movie was trying too hard.  Did like the  actors though did a good job with what they had.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|A pleasant inspirational video of how the heart can come out on top even when you feel you are at your worst and that there is no hope for the future due to a bad life before.  Also how honesty can be the best policy w/love no matter how bad it might seem.  You can still come out on top with the truest of hearts. :)<br />Great movie if you like Love and overcoming hardships in a hard life due to past bad choices.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book was sad in that the main characters were a bit unbalanced and sad.  I don't know who I was most upset with the wife who planned it all or the husband who seemed to be out to lunch.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|If you are into keeping up with multiple story lines and love being shown how the past, present, and future affect each other.  Also believe in Karma then you may love this movie.  I know I did with the adventures and the great acting with the actors in this film.  It may be long but well worth the watch in my book.  It is one I would concider buying. :)
B009NY43NY|1.0|I kept waiting for this book to get good and it never did! The ending seemed thrown together and was not at all at the level of the other Sookie books.  I waited MONTHS for this book to come out and was totally disapointed!!!
B00C5ZNUCS|5.0|Great album by a great band. Refreshing and enjoyably different from much of the metal today. I look forward to hopefully many more from them.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|You'll love this if you don't mind being against the birds that are in angry birds. Overall great game. A must buy, especially since it's free.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The author truly made me feel like I was there!! In some parts I even while reading this story- never before has that happened to me! I'm in love with Christian Grey!!!
B007EECSFA|2.0|Haven't finished it yet.  I put it down a few time to read something else.  Not exactly a page turner.  It's an easy enough read and will finish it eventually.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love it!! It was so intriguing had a marathon weekend to watch all 3 seasons!!!  Even my husband watched it with me!
B009NY43NY|3.0|The final installment of the Southern Vampire Mysteries is a must read for Sookie fans.  Dead Ever After wouldn't be enjoyed without having first read the preceeding novels in the series.  However, it does wrap up most of the loose ends in Bon Temps.  I gave Dead Ever After 3 stars, as the story felt overly rushed.  There is also more swearing in this book than other Harris books, if foul language is a concern.  Of course, if you've read all the other Stackhouse novels, you're still bound to enjoy the last adventure.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|This series is by far the best scifi series of all time, born from the creative genius that is Joss Whedon.  The characters are believable and complex, plots have just the right mix of comedy and drama.  The acting, writing, and directing make this series all together the best.
1616550414|5.0|A must book for any zelda lover in the world, the doujin at the back is ok, can't say it's good but ok
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Thought provoking!  Action-packed!  Balance of good vs evil.  Some good values demonstrated.  I would recommend it to others.  Won't disappoint!
1451627297|5.0|This book is right up there with The Stand and The Green Mile. Stephen King fans will be very pleased.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This game is so much fun. But some of the items are really expensive with the coins you earn. The horse looks realistic too.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|My husband and boys are really into dub-step and we all love the strings! This is a fun twist on the violin.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|My friends love it too! It is the best game around & I love the fact that I can play it on my Kindel Fire.
B003VW54QO|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. I watched it after I heard a DJ talking about it being great. He was right.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|fun game I started playing it as soon as I got it it was really fun and addicting its a great game and will give you a challenge
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Fun to to how the birds react differently in space.  I love trying to make the birds destroy the pigs.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a very addicting game.<br />I love it because it is teaching me things about horses I didn't know.<br />I think it is fun.<br />it is sourt of like hanging out with real horses<br />I lkkethat you can earn up and get more horses and horse tack.
B009IF82SK|5.0|I love it!!!!!! This is the funniest show on TV. You really care for all of the characters and their situations, and you can't wait to see what happens next.
B008OOYALE|3.0|Play several games daily and this one is harder to advance in due to excessive egg hatching time, need friends to expand and lots of cash to clear space.
B008NA3I30|3.0|Did we really need another movie about one of life's best known lessons?:  We have to know and love ourselves before we are satisfied with another person.  Really? Gosh!  What an original plot for a movie!<br /><br />Acting was excellent, time was wasted, I moved on.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I LOVED this book. My favorite of Follett's so far! I was already invested in the characters/families from Fall of Giants, so it was easy to be swept up with this second book in the trilogy.  Couldn't put this one down. You won't be disappointed.
0345529057|5.0|This is a great set of books,  Nice weight and feel.  Price is very reasonable and the books themselves are incredible.  I would recommend this product.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I love this game it is so fun for all ages.I have on locked four levels.I love this game.to much fun.!!!!!!!!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This app is by far the best i have ever seen. I play everyday and lose hours . So much fun, and the always update and add new things!!!
B00457X8BC|2.0|Improbable plotting and outdated event structure for current tastes. Readable, but, it comes across as Mankell's unsuccessful  effort to imitate a Le Carre spy yarn from the same period (late 80's/early 90's).
1469946939|4.0|INSIGHTFUL, EXTREMELY SO! But from a '&#34; Reformed &#34; perspective singularly lacking in emphases on the GOSPEL OF FREE GRACE! EXPLAINING that a sinner who is born again, has no more control over his (2nd birth) than he did over his physical one initially!  SAVING FAITH&#34; IS A GIFT OF GOD . Heb,10:39  ..While CHRIST'S UNDESERVED albeit &#34; substitutionary death& faith in such, is the &#34;SINE QUA NON&#34; FOR EVERY TRUE BELIEVER, ID.EST. A CHRISTIAN!
B006M7JCC2|3.0|I did not think this book had the clarity of  other near death experience storys. I keep feeling like I didn't quite understand how she was dying of cancer and then she was getting better. I had just finished reading &#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; by Eben Alexander, MD which was, for me, far more compelling.
B000FC21PA|5.0|it answers questions that most of us ask at some time in our life.  read it during my 20s and now at 70s...found Siddhartha very meaningful at both stages of my life.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I was just looking for a nice scary game and I found slender man. I started with a  ufriend on hard as soon I came in he took my soul. And I craped my pants and I screamed
B0015DROBO|3.0|The beginning story line was really slow. I had a hard time following the story lines with all the different character names. But once the story picked up it was an awesome read. I could barely put it down. I can't wait to read the next one.
034580404X|2.0|couldn't even get through half the first book--and I am no prude.  I have only not finished 2 books in my lifetime. and this is one of them.
B0087ZG7PW|5.0|Played well, written well, mastered. You get goose bumps in and out with this one. Hitchcock at his betters. Maybe should not be seen alone the first time. Honest.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|Animation being more impressive all the time, Tangled showing how much more.  The cast (voiced) nailed their roles and again, an ageless movie made.  Grandma, parent, and child watched together and eac felt something good within.
B0007TKNII|1.0|Emmy Rossum - I love you. I really do. You completely kick butt on Shameless, keep it up!<br />Gerard Butler - I love you too. Really. I've gone to see movies specifically because you were in them before.<br />Both of you - For the love of God and all that is holy and pure, please stop singing.
B00000IQC8|5.0|OK, I noticed a lot of the negative reviewers saw Mallrats before even viewing Clerks.<br />Let's get some things straight:<br />Considering that Kevin Smith funded Clerks all on his own (using his credit cards) and filming at the Convenience Store he worked at, makes Kevin Smith and the movie \\"Clerks\\" ingenious in its own right.<br />The dialogue (although raunchy, and hilarious I might add) is truthful and honest.  Come on, anyone in the retail industry would love to spit water in a customer's face, or \\"lash out\\" at the common customer. \\"Cute cat, what's its name?\\" \\"Annoying customer.\\"  Priceless stuff.<br />Fast forward to Mallrats (which, don't get me wrong, I also enjoyed).<br />Mallrats was funded by Miramax and provided (I believe) a $3M budget and it bombed at the box office.  It wasn't until release on video that this movie began making money.<br />So what does this tell us?  That Kevin Smith kept it simplistic with clever writing, used friends as actors and made a fortune with \\"Clerks\\". And I respect him enormously for what he accomplished with this film.<br />Sure, not everyone will get it, but that's what makes this film a class in itself.<br />A must see!
B0058BI896|4.0|I love this show, but I can understand why some people don't. It's cheesy in a lot of ways, and I can understand why some would find the characters grating and annoying, particularly Sheldon (He annoys me sometimes too, and he's my favorite character), but if you like geeky humor and sit coms, I think this will be fun for you.
B001AOKA3W|2.0|I'm a little late in seeing this movie, but for what it is...is not a total waste of time.<br />What I found interesting was the genuine fear the characters filming the \\"creature\\" had presented.<br />Filming the movie in this way (\\"documentary style\\") saved the writers from having to explain what exactly the creature is, where it came from, what it wants, etc. and therefore just was able to write a movie of endless chaos.<br />No explanations, no ending, just there.<br />With the same filming style along the lines of \\"The Blair Witch Project\\", this one falls short to Blair Witch.  At least we learn the story of the Blair Witch. In Cloverfield, we are left in the dark on what the heck is going on.<br />Like I said, the movie is ok, but nothing that draws you in completely.<br />Make your own assessment.<br />Thank you.
B00117W1HQ|5.0|Holy crap they hooked me from the first 5 minutes of episode 1, very suspenseful, I liked the writing, and the main leads are very emotive and sympathetic (also, not bad to look at). Highly recommend.
B00881PTRC|5.0|This app makes Hangman so much fun.  It's very entertaining.  When the game crashes it automatically saves everything, so I don't mind when it crashes once in a while.  The comedy value of the little guy being hanged is hilarious and what makes this game better than any other hangman game I've played.
B009NY43NY|1.0|First of all, I have read all the books in this series and really expected Harris to finish it out better than she did.  What's with the open ending?  No epilogue or anything to give us closure?  Harris may say she wanted readers to have their own interpretation on what happens but it's her job as a writer to tell us what happens.  Anyway, giving it one star just for the ending alone although I didn't think the book as a whole was great regardless.
B009OYTAL8|5.0|The show has great twist and turns lets hope the writers keep up the good work with out falling the rabbit hole.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I can't believe this program was on TV for so many years without watching it.  Once we gave it a try we watched the first 3 seasons in rapid succession, then purchased Season 4 which we are watching now.  It is an awesome series with the legal drama different in each one, but the back story of the characters continuing throughout.
B009NY43NY|5.0|finally sookie ended up right where she belonged and with whom she belonged , glad the final pages to her in that direction , great series overall and way better than the serial
0385474547|5.0|the story is a simple one: achebe shows a pre-european-contact culture that was at times brutal, but possessed a strong, demanding tradition and laws that served the culture well.  enter european missionaries and ... things fall apart.  i liked achebe's direct, simple, almost parable-like writing style, which fit the story well. i followed this book with adam rochschild's &#34;king leopold's ghost,&#34; which is a non-fictional account of the incredibly horrible effects of the belgian ivory and rubber trade on the congo tribes during the waning years of the nineteenth century. i'm currently re-reading conrad's &#34;heart of darkness,&#34; a fictional &#34;snippet&#34; that is set also in the congo during the ivory extraction phase of the belgian rape of the congo.  this triptych has been personally enlightening and has helped me place some of the apparent chaos of sub-saharan africa in an historical perspective.
B00B19DW0E|3.0|The whole premise of this movie is not believable and it gets no better from there. However, I enjoyed watching it to see what the writers thought that Manhattan would be like as a prison and what social structures would form.

B009NY43NY|3.0|Not much to say, I was so disappointed.  I was crazy about this series. Even though I figured early on where Sookie was going, I agree with other reviewers.  It seems CF threw away the other characters. It seemed so offhand.
B0033UDEX4|5.0|I found this on my Kindle Fire under Amazon Prime a few days ago, and decided to give it a try. I am HOOKED!  It has it all, good writing, great characters and lots of fun weird things.  And for those who like the G-PG Ratings, this is definitely in that category. I am into Season 2 so far, and everything stays in the Family Friendly range and keeps the Comedy, Drama and Sci-Fi intact.  Enjoy the show!
B003W9JELC|5.0|My daughter who is 7 LOVED this movie!  It was a great family one to watch and had nothing that I had to FF through :)

I'm never listening music without amplifiers. 4 months of using E6 dialy and I had loved it every minute. Using this DAC with CX300-II and Galaxy S3 is a wonderful experience.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|loved it - although for some reason it kept stopping.  don't know if this is my computer or some fault with streaming
B00BXKKNFS|3.0|Blocks some ads but not all. Blocks most ads on direct feed news sites but doesn't seem to block ads on weather sites, and music or movie sites. Also, if using Google as your search engine more ads seem to come through. Possibly due to Google recently unblocking ads and allowing them to come through when using their services. Would like to see it really block all ads with ability to unblock only the ones I want to see.

B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I use this charger in my car every day. Most chargers take forever to charge my iPhone because they supply 0.5A. Anker's car charger charges my iPhone quickly even while I use power hungry GPS apps. The device is well built and feels like it will last a very long time. I am very pleased with this purchase!
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I have been having this product for now 8 month and I have to say it does the job of tracking your running workouts.<br />so comments about this is that if the wheel gets wet with sweat or water, the watch becomes unresponsive, so you have to lock the bezel so the screen does not go crazy if sweat drop on the watch while you are running.<br /><br />I will recommend after you first receive the watch you reset the GPS, so you will have a more accurate measuring of Km ran. I just realized this after 8 month. I was facing around a 400 meters +/- of distance difference on a measured circuit and after I reset the GPS I start getting the right numbers.<br />You can do that following this: https://support.garmin.com/support/searchSupport/case.faces?caseId={0e6ccd20-8f07-11e1-5188-000000000000}
1451648537|5.0|I picked this book up to read while traveling recently to Egypt.  I figured that having a good book to read would give me an excuse not to talk to any sand bums and leather jerks that I ran into along the way.<br /><br />I had no idea that Jobs was such a dbag.  On the other hand, maybe he needed to be a dbag.  Our entire society is run by morons.  Morons in business.  Morons in politics.  Morons in the media.  Have you watched any movies lately?  I suspect many of the morons are Hollywood producers.<br /><br />Why do big businesses fail?  Because they are run by dolts.  They lose their initial momentum and succumb to bureaucracy.  Seems to me that most businesses succeed in spite of their leadership, not because of it.  Never underestimate the ability of \\"smart\\" people to be stupid.<br /><br />Jobs story is a stellar example.  He leaves Apple and what happens?  Tyranny of the retarded.  He comes back and things turn around.<br /><br />I wonder - what would have happened if Jobs went the traditional route today and got an IT degree and then went to work for a large computer or other sort of tech company?  How would he do?  Would leadership recognize his potential?  Hell no.  I'd bet both my balls that he would wind up in a forced ranking system and that his immediate supervisor would rank him low because his attitude.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This was a page turner!  I started this less than a week ago and just couldn't put it down. Can't wait to read Inferno.
B007REV4T8|1.0|I can't believe I actually bought this before renting it.  My mistake.  Well... at least I can make up for wasting my money by writing a scathing review.<br /><br />Before I begin the brilliant analysis, a word.  Yes, I know this is a movie.  Yes, I know that Bond films take some liberty with reality.  Yes, I realize that Bond films tend to include many of the same elements.  Yes, I get all that.<br /><br />However, COME THE HECK ON!  Just because some Bond films in the past took some creative license with reason doesn't mean that every new Bond film has a blank check to go throw common sense to the wind.<br /><br />That being said, here we go:<br /><br />1.  When Bond smashes the back end of the train with the back hoe, why doesn't the train stop?  If the back of a passenger car gets torn off, wouldn't the conductor stop the train?<br /><br />2.  Bond gets shot off the top of the train and plummets hundreds of feet into a river.  He goes over a waterfall and appears dead.  Well, the next thing we know he is hanging out in a beach hut with a woman, obviously healed from his injuries.  Ahhh.... Ok... how did he get there?  How did he heal?  How long was he there?  What the heck happened?<br /><br />3.  The bad guy is trying to kill M, right?  So when he blows up part of the MI6 building, why doesn't he do it when she is there?  Why doesn't he wait until she is in the office?  What possible reason does he have to blow up her office while she isn't there?<br /><br />4. In Shanghai, Bond tracks down the sniper guy, gets in a struggle, and the sniper guy falls from the open window to his death.  Bond then looks at the sniper's equipment and finds a casino token inside the window cutting kit.  Uhhhh...ok... why was the token in the window cutting kit?  It wasn't just in there either... it looked like there was a special round spot for it.  How many window cutting kits do you know of that include special spots for casino tokens?  Also, is that where you would leave your assassination payment casino token?  How about back in a safe somewhere?  How about in your pocket?  Why would you have a special spot in your window cutting kit for it?<br /><br />5.  The dumbest thing about this movie in the entire plot surrounding how the bad guy plans to kill M.  Apparently, the whole scheme is that he allows himself to get captured... so he can escape... so he can track her down in London and kill her.  Yeah - except it makes zero sense.<br /><br />First of all, as mentioned above, the guy could have just killed her by blowing her office up.  Done.<br /><br />Well that didn't happen, so he gets captured and put into a holding cell that looks like a prison for Magneto out of the X-Men.  However, unbeknownst to MI6, bad guy has some sort of intrusive virus on his computer that will infect the network once they try to analyze his computer.  What does this nefarious virus do?  It opens doors (ie, so he can escape).  Ok... so this is stupid on so many levels it is hard to summarize.  Just a few thoughts:  If the bad guy was so smart, why didn't he put a bigger, badder virus on the computer?  Why just something to open doors?  And how did he know how MI6 would hold him?  What if they had used an old fashioned metal bars cell?  After all, they are going old school and hiding in an underground bunker, right?  Wouldn't it make sense to put him in an old-style cell too?  And are we supposed to believe that the bad guy's entire plan revolved around getting out of his cage after the computer virus infected the network given the fact that he had no way of knowing where he would be kept and how he would be kept?  Also, did he know that there would be a convenient escape hole located in the floor right next to his cell?<br /><br />You see, the whole idea that he planned this in advance is ludicrous.<br /><br />Then we get in the underground where Bond shoots at bad guy while he is climbing a ladder.  Lucky for bad guy he planted explosives in the ceiling... right under the tube so a subway train comes crashing through the roof.  Huh?  Did bad guy know in advance that this is the escape path he would take?  Did he know Bond would catch him at just this spot?  Did he have a train schedule so he knew just the right time to blow the whole so a train would crash through?  Again - completely stupid.<br /><br />Bad guy also has operatives helping him.  A couple guys give him some sort of police outfit to wear that looks just like other police guys in the subway station.  Yeah - because this was all figured out in advance because bad guy knew exactly where he would be held, the type of cell, the fact that it would be next to an escape whole in the floor, and that he would have to go through a tube station on the way out.  Right.<br /><br />Want to get even dumber?  Here it goes.  This whole scheme depends on him knowing exactly where M is, right?  The escape route, the pick-up cars, the uniforms, everything.  It is all set up to get him to where she was testifying.  Ok, so let's skip back.  Bad guy wanted to be captured in order to execute this plot.  Therefore, this was thought out well in advance.  Did M have this appointment on her calendar while this was being planned?<br /><br />You see... the entire scheme is senseless.  Since bad guy couldn't predict where and how he would be held, and where M was (or would be), there is no way he could have planned the escape route and coordinated the package exchange with the uniform and the pick-up car.  No way.<br /><br />6.  Well, it gets worse.  What is Bond's big plan to protect M?  Take her up to his family home (Skyfall) in Scotland.  Who does he take with him for additional protection?  No one.  The only other person they have to help is some old groundkeeper who apparently lives up there and takes care of the place... but Bond wasn't expecting him to be there.  So Bond's whole plan is to drive up there with her and fight it out by himself.  That's it.  No extra guards even though this is MI6.  No extra weapons.  No extra help of any kind... not even a sneaky attack helicopter hiding over a hill.  Nothing.  This is the plan.  Brilliant.<br /><br />So the bad guys come and get killed by a bunch of traps and some trickery.  Ok fine.  But then why does Bond fire at the helicopter when it shows up with more bad guys?  Huh?  Why would the crew of the chopper assume that the first wave had lost?  Wouldn't they just land and back-up the first team?  By firing on the chopper, Bond just lets them know that the first team failed and that they are still alive.  Again, completely stupid.<br /><br />And how does the groundskeeper turn into such a moron after the escape through the tunnel.  They are smart enough to trap the house, but then they escape and the first thing he does is start waving a flashlight all over the place?  Are you kidding me?  Then, of course, bad guy see the flashlight and is like, \\"Ah ha\\" there they are... and off he goes a  chasing them.<br /><br />I could write a lot more and get into a heck of a lot more detail, but I have to draw the line on the main points.  I've said it before and I'm saying it again... doesn't anyone in these production meetings step up and say, \\"uuuhhh... that doesn't make any sense...\\"  At the most basic level with this film... if someone destroys half a passenger car on a train, that train is going to stop.  Period. What, no one could figure out that the train lost several cars and the back end of a passenger car was ripped open?  And on a more detailed level, no one asked about bad guys plot to get captured and mentioned that the entire string of events was ridiculous?
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|5 different, very interesting stories, but very confusing jumping back and forth. Was waiting for an explanation of how these stories are related (besides their vague reasoning that one good deed leads to another, past, present and future)
B0083SBMBM|1.0|Just when I'd thought I couldn't watch anything dumber, I found this gem.<br /><br />The positive reviews for this film have shaken my faith in humanity.  At the time of this review, there are only a bit over 100 1 star reviews, and it appears most of those are negative due to technical issues... many are not based on the actual film<br /><br />Well... let's start with utterly worthless superheroes: The Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Captain America.<br /><br />The Black Widow - what good is she?  She does what?  We see an alien army coming out of a space portal and the best she can do is stand there with a couple pistols?  She is worthless.<br /><br />Hawkeye - just one step above The Black Widow.  The guy's superpower is what?  He is a good shot with a bow?  And he attempts to stop an alien invasion by shooting arrows at them?  He is worthless.<br /><br />Captain America - I guess he is a really good guy with a shield or something?  Heaven forbid the guy ever pick up a gun... can't have that I guess.  In order to make him seem useful, the Captain sort of takes a leadership role and gives out orders to the other Avengers.  Just one step less worthless than Hawkeye.<br /><br />Ok... on to the others...<br /><br />The Hulk - Uhhhh... someone explain to me why he can't control himself when he attacks The Black Widow but he is in perfect control during the alien invasion?  How does that work?  Also, wasn't there some suggestion that Loki wanted to get at the Hulk for some reason?  Was that ever explained?<br /><br />Thor - I guess being a demi-god qualifies as having some powers.  Of course, it also makes you wonder why The Black Widow and Hawkeye are so special.  Anyway - so why can't Thor break out of the prison container Loki traps him in?  Because it might fall?  That's the big trick?  Don't try to break out or it will fall?<br /><br />Iron Man - probably the only sensible superhero in the group.  You can explain his character and his powers.<br /><br />Question - the secret flying aircraft carrier engages a cloaking device when it takes off out of the water.  What happens to it?  Do they turn it off again right away?  The next time we see the ship it isn't working.  What's the deal?  Oh... and what exactly is the ship needed for in the first place?  The S.H.I.E.L.D. agency needed to recruit the superheroes to work for them, right?  So doesn't that imply that they really don't have any power themselves?  If they did, they wouldn't need to recruit superheroes.  Soooooo... what the heck do they need a giant, flying aircraft carrier for?<br /><br />Question - When Loki's henchmen come to rescue him off of the carrier, why do they blow up an engine first?  Wouldn't they try to sneak in quietly and get him out?  Was it supposed to be a distraction?  If so, why didn't anyone on the carrier send some extra guards to Loki's room?  Dumb.<br /><br />Question - where did Hawkeye get that usb plug arrow he uses to shoot into the computer and turn all of the carrier engines off?  For that matter, why turn all of the engines off in the first place... they are trying to get Loki, not kill themselves.<br /><br />Question - since Hawkeye's arrow accessed the computer and shut the engines down, how is it that Iron Man is able to get them started again?  He is working on the single engine that Hawkeye shot out with the explosive arrow.  So - why is it possible to get that engine started.... and all the other engines started, when the computer apparently shut them down?  Makes no sense.<br /><br />Question - Loki is so impressive why?  The dude is the most pathetic evil villain I've ever seen.<br /><br />Question - if the shield around the energy beam creating the space portal can't be penetrated, why not just knock out the floor around it... or a floor or two off of the building?  The energy generator is on the roof of the building... so knock out the floors beneath it.  It isn't hovering there.  Just knock it off.  What's the big deal?<br /><br />Question - what exactly is the relationship between Loki and the alien invaders?  What does each hope to gain and why?  What... are they just invading for the heck of it?  Does Loki want to rule Earth because he got kicked out of his home world?  How is that going to fly?  Does he think no one else will notice and that Thor and the others won't come after him regardless?  Does he think that the aliens will back him up?  They don't seem all that great if half of them can be beaten by a woman with two pistols, a guy with a bow, and another guy with a shield.<br /><br />Finally, can anyone think of a dumber plot?  Just imagine the production meeting where everyone is sitting around trying to come up with ideas for an Avengers movie.  I can see it now... someone at the end of the table says, \\"Wait a minute!  I've got it!  How about The Avengers have to save the world from an evil norse god who is trying to conquer the Earth with an army of aliens!\\"<br /><br />Again... as I say in almost every movie review I write... didn't a single person stand up and say, \\"Hmmmm... you know what?  That is freaking stupid!\\"  Not a single person?
B000003CM9|5.0|Great record. Duane Altman is unequaled in pure soulful guitar work. His tone is unique and beautiful with plenty of punch. Many songs have an almost atmospheric quality. A must have for any blues/rock collection. I still have my well worn vynl version of this record.

B001XUNQ4S|3.0|I used to absolutely love the original Star Trek movies when I was young. STIII was included. However, watching it again for the first time in 20 years and I find that it does not hold up like STII. Oh well.
B000IDEQTK|3.0|I liked the scenery and I always like Helen Hunt but the young Scarlett Johansson was a bit annoying.  Maybe this could have used a bit of Wilde's farce.

B00CL68NOG|2.0|I'm not sure if I didn't like this movie because the studio fooled me or if the film was actually that bad.  I love both of these actors so I couldn't figure out why I hated the film so much...oh yeah, maybe it's because the studio felt they had to trick me into thinking I was going to watch a comedy and it turns out to be a depressing &#34;Terms of Endearment&#34; type of film.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Original idea, like the concepts. What would you do in his place? Better than the grandkids said, sure they were not able to keep up with the ideas.
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|I don't think this was well written at all , but OK.  Acting is obviously great, it has a very good cast.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|Funny , not sure how there was not protests about this movie. Very racial and controversial. Be prepared to be shocked
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Funny, witty--a true feel-good movie.  Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson are superb in their adversarial relationship, and the supporting cast was terrific.  Kudos to the casting department.  Truly one of my favorite movies.
B004TN7QPG|4.0|Moon+ Reader is, IMO, the best eBook reader available for Android for many reasons, most of which are covered extensively in other reviews seen here. It would receive a 5 star rating from me, but there is one big issue with the paid / pro version that can't be ignored:<br /><br />The PDF support is laughable at best. PDF support is the main reason I switched from the Free to the Pro version and it is terrible. The free versions of other reader apps offer much better PDF viewing. Rather than the text being formatted to wrap on the screen in a readable eBook manner, it is simply displayed however the file was formatted when it was published. A PDF designed to be printed to 8.5X11\\" paper is displayed as a zoomed-out rectangular image that must be zoomed-in for the text to be read. You then have to drag the image to bring text into view as you read a line and when you go to the next line you have to drag it all the way back over. Then you have to figure out what line you're on. It is a cumbersome process.<br /><br />There is a built in feature to, sort of, fix this. In the PDF options menu you can enable the \\"Text Reflow\\" button. Pressing the Text Reflow button formats the text to a more traditional eBook style that wraps to fill. Unfortunately it fails to display any images that were present in the document, and it renders all the text the same font size making headings and titles indistinguishable from body text. Additionally, scrolling is the only way to proceed through the \\"Reflowed\\" text. Page turning is disabled.<br /><br />I scoured the options menu for a way to fix it, but found nothing. I contacted the developer via email. They responded promptly and told me there may be updates to the Text Reflow function in the future. Until then, I recommend just sticking with the free version unless the ads really bother you or you need Text to Speech (TTS). The PDF functionality is not worth $5.<br /><br />P.S.<br /><br />If you are a foreign language learner, this is a must have app. When used with GoldenDict and Touch Translator you can breeze through reading material stopping only momentarily to look-up words you don't know.

0553801473|1.0|I will begin by saying that the one word NO ONE would use to describe me is prude.  I'm not sure what is going on with Martin and his writing but this was a long and tedious piece of work.  I get the impression that when he runs in to a dead end with and idea, he resorts to sex acts, genitalia, animal cruelty and torture.  There was too much of all of this in Dance with Dragons and none of it helped the story in any way.  The only part of the book I even remotely enjoyed was the continuation of Aria's story line.  I also get the impression that Martin has no idea where he's going so he just writes whatever sick and depraved thing he can come up with to fill pages and to get his editor and publisher off his back.  I can say that I am no longer interested in this story.  A Song of Fire and Ice started off as a fantasy masterpiece but has ended up nothing more than blood and torture porn.  If I had one piece of constructive advice for Mr. Martin, I'd suggest he'd get a really good therapist to exercise whatever demons are torturing his depraved soul.

B00005JLEU|4.0|Spirited Away<br />Disney/Miyazaki<br /><br />Plot:<br />Moving away from everyone and everything you've ever known is bad enough, but when your parents decide to stop and check out an abandoned ruin in the middle of nowhere and you have that feeling that something really bad just might happen, you know you're in for a long day...<br /><br />This is the dilemma that 10-year old Chihiro faces as she drives to her new home, and things go from bad to worse when her parents stumble across an abandoned bathhouse and amusement park and begin consuming some tempting foods placed so precisely on the counter of a stall...<br /><br />As night falls, Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs and she finds the streets crawling with dark specters. What's worse, the way out of the area has completely disappeared, with miles of water separating her from land like an island.<br /><br />Under the guidance of a young boy, Haku, who claims to have known her since she was very small, Chihiro is instructed to enter the bathhouse and demand work of the arachnid-like boiler man named Kamaji if she ever hopes to save her parents and escape the island.<br /><br />But getting a job at the spirit bathhouse proves to be the easiest task that Chihiro must fulfill. Saving her parents will require her to deal with the most bizarre of guests, face the slander of her fellow workers, grow from a spoiled child to a responsible young woman, and discover the motivations of Haku, who appears to be bound and brainwashed to the malicious manager of the bathhouse, Yubaba...<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />I'll just confess it now: I didn't expect to like this movie, but the truth is, I did end up enjoying way more than I ever thought I would.<br /><br />Spirited Away is reminiscent of Lewis Carol's Alice in Wonderland with its unexplained happenings and weird, often frightening, circumstances, and deserves more than one watch in order to catch everything. It certainly has some bizarre moments that don't seem to make sense, but you have to understand that Spirited Away is meant to be just that--fantastical, weird, and mythology-oriented. If you try to understand this film in terms of logic, instead of focusing on the circumstances involved, you'll miss a lot of the enjoyment.<br /><br />The cast of characters is very original, often in the wackiest sense of the word. From the multi-armed Kamaji (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Eggman's grandfather, Gerald) to the giant-headed Yubaba, this film has a lot to offer in terms of unique characters. Chihiro is a very dynamic character in that you don't exactly respect her spoiled ways, but understand her realistic fears, at the beginning of the film; by the end of the film, Chihiro is tackling dangerous situations and even putting her life on the line to save her friends. She's a heroine that impresses and appeals to the audience.<br /><br />If the weirdness doesn't turn you off too much, you'll find a very immersive and original story about a young girl's maturing to adulthood, a love story with a unique spin, and a world reminiscent of Alice and Wonderland... only with a Japanese, Miyazaki twist.<br /><br />Artistry is off-the-charts, with a beautiful blend of breath-taking backgrounds, animations, and action/peril moments. Once again, Miyazaki does not disappoint visually! Humor is, as always, present and clever. I laughed heartily.<br /><br />The cool stuff:<br />Artistry is incredible<br />Original plot<br />Interesting and dynamic heroine<br />Unique supporting characters<br />Good humor<br />Beautiful musical score<br /><br />The \\"meh\\" stuff:<br />Centers on the weird and unusual<br />Some drawn-out scenes<br />A few points that were entertaining, but not entirely necessary<br /><br />Final Verdict:<br />As I said before, I didn't expect to enjoy Spirited Away, but I really found that I enjoyed it more than I thought, even the parts that were too weird for me to grasp. The humor kept me laughing contentedly, and the connection of Chihiro and the guardian-like Haku, coupled with each advancing episode in Chihiro's quest to save her parents, kept me interested to know how it would all end...<br /><br />As for the end itself, well... I won't spoil it for you, but it was, in its own way, unique and open-ended--a satisfactory ending for such a bizarre film.<br /><br />If you don't like anime, then you may want to let Spirited Away go, but if you enjoy this type of animation, it's certainly a must-see if, for no other reason, than just to say you've seen it.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|I came across Thomas' music on YouTube.  After I listened to a couple of the songs on this album, I just knew that I had to own it.  I love it! The female vocalists are wonderful, the music sends shivers down your spine, and leaves you breathless, wanting more.  Throughout the album, my jaw was on the floor.  Bergersen's music is different from other soundtracks/trailer music I've heard. Definitely worth the money I paid for it.  Highly recommend.
B006QS07IK|4.0|Frankenstein<br />Author: Mary Shelley<br /><br />Plot:<br />Victor Frankenstein became interested in the studies of life and theories of long-dead scientists at a young age, and his passions to achieve the miraculous drive him to dedicate his life to the pursuit of his goals. Leaving his home and family in Geneva, he sets out for the University of Ingolstadt in Germany, where the encouragement of professors and a wealth of nourishing teaching lead Victor to discover the formula for life itself...<br /><br />This is what he's always dreamed of--achieving the impossible through science--but the pursuit of his goals takes a turn for the worse. After countless nights of constructing his own human creature from morgue remains, Victor brings his creation to life, realizing too late that he has released a hideous monster into the world.<br /><br />The creature seems to shadow his every step. Stealthier than a man, faster than conceivable, and able to survive burning heats and colds and inhabit the uninhabitable, Frankenstein's monster begins to wreak havoc among his creator's family, threatening them with death and promising to cause Victor utmost agony unless he complies with a certain request...<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />I try to read at least one classic a month and this one jumped off of the shelf at me so I took it home for a few days. I'd never read, or heard, the story of Frankenstein as told by the book. What I had heard was what a lot of you people reading this have--Dr. Frankenstein is a wicked madman, Igor pulls the lever, the creature is brought to life with a lightening bolt and is a potentially nice and misunderstood guy, et cetra.<br /><br />It turns out that Victor Frankenstein is a pretty sane person (aside from his mental after-turmoil), Igor doesn't exist (period), there is no lightening bolt (at all), and Frankenstein is mostly portrayed as a demonical monster after the lives of innocent victims.<br /><br />Where this book really excels is its originality. The reason Frankenstein became a classic is because it proposed novel plot concepts concerning human creation and \\"playing God\\" in science; even today its messages are frighteningly applicable, with all the talk about cloning, etc. going around...<br /><br />Characters are interesting, although Victor isn't as admirable as some classic heroes, as he spends a majority of the book either whining or hiding or regretting his actions in misery. Given what he goes through, however, this is very understandable. The only other character that really comes to the forefront is the monster himself, who has both a sinister and a polite, deceptive side, making him a fearsome antagonist. Most of the other characters don't have a large role in the plot, and the main focus is on the protagonist and his fiend. All-in-all, you do feel the characters' emotions and you do find them dimensional; however, they still lack the depth, and the writing lacks the emotion, of a novel like The Hunchback of Notre Dame.<br /><br />As with all classics, there seems to be a lot of unnecessary wordiness and \\"tacked on\\" descriptions that fill pages that you'd rather see filled with actual plot; however, Frankenstein isn't nearly as wordy as a novel like The Hunchback of Notre Dame. I found a lot of potential in this book because of its originality and even its terror; but the moments that I thought were superbly written (in particular the creature's being brought to life) were too few and far between and usually only lasted a few paragraphs. Contrast these moments with pages full of superfluous information and you get a plot that could have been expanded, and even bettered, by a more practical and gripping pace.<br /><br />So, where does a classic like Frankenstein fall flat? There are times when Shelley proves that she can write suspense, but she just doesn't use it enough to make this novel truly deserving of the title \\"classic horror.\\" In places where perfect terror has the potential of occurring, Victor doesn't always react in a way that makes the reader feel the \\"fear of the moment.\\" Branching from that thought are cases of very unrealistic reactions; for example, after Victor brings the monster to life and is terrified by it, he runs to his living quarters (which are fairly close by) and lets the monster run free without warning anyone about him. That may seem a bit understandable, but Victor makes no attempt to put distance between himself and the beast and even manages to fall asleep that night. I don't know about you, but *personally* I wouldn't be sleeping...<br /><br />The cool stuff:<br />It's a classic<br />Interesting, original plot<br />Interesting conflict and suspense<br />Interesting characters<br />Lots of interesting!<br />Very applicable messages for today's society<br />Lots of depth and symbolism<br /><br />The \\"meh\\" stuff:<br />Unrealistic reactions<br />Lack of suspense when it could have been effective<br />Decent amount of \\"filler\\" descriptions/wordiness that could have been condensed(?)<br /><br />Final Verdict:<br />Worth the read? It's a classic, so it's worth the read if, for no other reason, just to say that you've read it. However, it's also an intriguing story focused on a then-original concept that has continued to inspire novels, films, video games, and you-name-it. All-in-all, Frankenstein makes for an interesting and entertaining read, with a few, note-worthy flaws to mark its pages.<br /><br />...But if it's a happy-ever-after story that you want, you might want to look elsewhere.

B0085Z8F4A|2.0|I had really high hopes for this movie. Ridley Scott is one of my favorite directors and Alien one of my all time favorite films. The trailers also looked like he might have nailed it. Unfortunately, he actually missed the mark quite widely, and this goes down as my least favorite of all his films. The plot lurches clumsily from one idea to the next, with a cast of bland characters that fail to hold it all together - and whose actions are (to be polite) quite confusing at times. You are left with the feeling that there were just too many big ideas during the production meetings, and Mr. Scott spent so much time trying to make them all fit together that he forgot how to actually direct a movie. I understand the movie had a patchy history of writers too, which clearly shows. One of the many strange decisions for me was the casting of Guy Pearce - could they not have found a real old guy for that role? Did they choose him just because he was in that viral Ted video playing a younger version? Baffling.<br /><br />The film isn't a complete disaster. Michael Fassbender deservedly got all the plaudits for his fantastic performance. There are some nice set pieces here and there, and the visuals are great as well.<br /><br />On the whole though, very disappointing. I hold out hope that (despite what he says) Ridley Scott might take this one back to the edit room and transform it - much like he did with Blade Runner.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind<br />Disney/Miyazaki<br /><br />Plot:<br />A million years ago, a world-wide conflict, known as the \\"Seven Days of Fire\\" engulfed the human race, leaving behind only a remnant of what was once a flourishing planet and prosperous people. The survivors of the war grouped into isolated colonies where they struggled to overcome barren wastelands, ever-encroaching poisonous forests, and the dangerous, forest-dwelling Ohmu--creatures that resemble gargantuan pillbugs.<br /><br />Nausicaa is the princess in the Valley of the Wind, one of the isolated colonies fortunate enough to survive the ancient war. Seemingly gifted with a soothing, enchanting presence, she has the ability to tame the anger of everything from a rampaging Ohmu, to a hostile fox-squirrel. Her talents even seem to affect the other humans around her...<br /><br />But Nausicaa is different than the others, even then. She longs for peace--a peace that will allow the humans, the forests, and the Ohmu to live together in harmony. While many in her colony share this vision, neighboring civilizations have other plans...<br /><br />When an attack from the local Torumekian Empire results in the death and destruction of her homeland, Nausicaa bends to the will of Princess Kushana and willingly gives herself as a hostage in order to preserve her people. Torumekia has plans to obliterate the forests and its creatures in order to reclaim the planet for mankind, and Nausicaa can do little but put up silent resistance and make plans to stop her...<br /><br />As Nausicaa's adventure continues, she discovers that the conflict encompasses far more than Torumekia. Other nations have become involved as well, and something seems to be stirring the Ohmu into a warlike rage...<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />Nausicaa is certainly one of those lesser-known Miyazaki films, especially when compared to a movie like My Friend Totoro or the award-winning Spirited Away. While there's a reason for that,Nausicaa also has a lot to offer with its story and characters, which are at the heart of the film.<br /><br />Having just come away from Howl's Moving Castle, I found that I had to adjust to the animation of Nausicaa, which was certainly more traditional and less vibrant than a partially CG film like Spirited Away. The voice quality is muddy at times, and dialogue consists of many \\"talk-to-myself-to-clear-this-up-for-the-viewer\\" moments, as well as some pretty cheesy stuff. Music is mostly off throughout the film, either because it just doesn't fit the moment or the track just lacks the right instruments to bring the scene home.<br /><br />As may have been revealed by the plot description, the movie has a certain focus on \\"environmentalism\\" and finding the \\"special bond\\" between man and nature. Since the setting appears to be an entirely fictional planet, the message is easier to ignore and never really gets too preachy, which I was thankful for. If viewed simply as an engaging plot about a girl with a compassionate heart, the environmentalism stuff kinda diminishes.<br /><br />And... Nausicaa needs a darker pair of pants. They're the exact same color as her skin, which leads to some very deceptive moments...<br /><br />Moving on.<br /><br />But the reason I truly found Nausicaa worth watching was the characters and the plot. The heroine is truly admirable; she's tough, but gentle; firm, but kind; relentless, but courageous; and even in the face of severe pain and loss she never stops following what she believes in. Nausicaa isn't so outstanding as to be \\"inhuman,\\" but she isn't a weak or flawless character either.<br /><br />Of course, the supporting cast is quite alive as well--lending humor, wisdom, originality, or simply backup, to the plot. It's really a shame you don't get to know them better. Alas, screentime (like bombs) must be used wisely.<br /><br />Along with these excellent characters is an original and engaging plot about man VS man, nature, beast, and self. While it's a bit difficult to get into at first; and there's a plethora of names, cultures, and concepts to get familiar with; those who are able to grasp the basic structure of the story will find something to love. Creativity certainly isn't lacking here, as is expected of Miyazaki, and the atmospheres, creatures, and characters all offer something different.<br /><br />The cool stuff:<br />Original, interesting plotline<br />Creativity runs throughout the story<br />Humor is a nice touch<br />Characters are unique and likeable<br />Heroine is strong and relatable<br />Satisfactory, powerful ending<br /><br />The \\"meh\\" stuff:<br />Dialogue often resorts to characters self-explaining concepts/thoughts/etc.; sometimes cheesy or unnatural<br />Animation is a bit sketchy, although the film is around 25 years old...<br />Music is often inappropriate for the moment or just awkward in general<br />Scenes can be of questionable reality (i.e.--small, single-man fighter plane taking out three enormous battleships?)<br />Theme of environmentalism is present but bearable<br />...Nausicaa needs different pants O_o<br /><br />Final Verdict:<br />I totally loved the characters in Nausicaa, especially the name-sake of the movie. If you love anime, and you're looking for a deep, original plotline, you'll probably want to give Nausicaa a watch or two (two or more if you really want to nail all those names and plot devices). As is typical of Miyazaki, there is a running vein of environmentalism, but if you can stomach it, or look past it and focus on the compassion and courage of the lead characters and the originality of the plot, you'll probably still enjoy the story.<br /><br />Nausicaa isn't without some prominent faults, but you can certainly see the potential it could have if things like cheesy dialogue, misplaced soundtrack, and awkward moments were removed. If you love Miyazaki, it goes without saying that you should certainly see Nausicaa at least once. If anime isn't your thing, then you may still find the story and characters immersive, or you may not enjoy it at all.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I just loved seeing this movie after my kids forced me to read the book.  Can't wait for the next one.
1442444053|5.0|Watership Down<br />Author: Richard Adams<br /><br />Plot:<br />Living in the safety of his rabbit warren, Fiver is a runt with the gift of a seer. After receiving a vision of a field covered in blood, Fiver prophesies that the warren and its rabbits will all be destroyed if they don't flee immediately. Together, with his older brother Hazel, an ex-Owsla (military commander) named Bigwig, and several other members of the old warren, Fiver guides his friends through danger, death, and terror in order to find a high green hill where they can begin life anew.<br /><br />If avoiding man and predator isn't difficult enough, the rabbits also encounter subtler enemies--others like them who have made fatal agreements with man, trading the lives of their rabbits for the food and shelter of humans. And then there's General Woundwort, a Hitler-minded giant of a rabbit who governs his warren with an iron paw and chooses to wage war with Hazel and Fiver, should they refuse to join him...<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />I'd had my eye on Watership Down for quite some time and at last gave in and picked it up one long day at the library. I expected it to be enjoyable, but long and draggy.<br /><br />Boy, was I wrong. I fell in love with this book.<br /><br />My love for Redwall probably has something to do with how quickly I grew attached to Watership Down, but, regardless, I thoroughly enjoyed it. Filled with rich history, including some very entertaining stories about the rabbit hero El-ahrairah (who is much like Odysseus in Greek mythology), Watership Down creates something fresh and original. The rabbits have their own culture, language, and world, and each character is bright and colorful and alive.<br /><br />Richard Adams has said many times that his book was never intended to be allegorical, but there are several parallels to mythology, Christianity, and even corrupt political systems like Nazism. If you love animals, you'll enjoy the story because of the rabbits. If you loveoriginality, you'll enjoy the story because it's probably the only brilliant story ever written about just rabbits. If you love depth and allegory, the symbolism will appeal to you. If you just like a good, gripping novel filled with original characters and a thrilling climax, well... you get the picture.<br /><br />The novel does have a few downsides. Complex names/words will prove a challenge to follow at first, and at times side-stories pop up when you'd rather just read about Hazel and Fiver's adventure. By the end of the novel, both of these are appreciated, however. There's a bit of a \\"man is the source of all nature's problems\\" overtone, but only for a few chapters. One spiteful bird character has quite a mouth and swears every handful of lines, but given the entirety of the book, it isn't an enormous problem.<br /><br />The cool stuff:<br />Brilliant characters<br />Well-crafted symbolism<br />Exciting plot<br />Balanced pace<br />Grand climax and ending<br />Rich with an original history based on the rabbits<br />Has some educational value, as you learn quite a bit about rabbit life<br /><br />The \\"meh\\" stuff:<br />Complex/original names/words may prove difficult to follow at first<br />Side stories seem to take away from the main action, until viewed in hindsight<br />Mini-theme of \\"man is the source of nature's problems\\"<br />Handful of swear words<br /><br />Final Verdict:<br />I really can't say everything I want to here. I totally recommend Watership Down. It's easily become one of my all-time favorite classics and is going to find a permanent place on my bookshelf (as soon as I can buy a copy). If you loved Redwall, and you're looking for a classic, give this one a read. You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />If you're still wondering if a \\"bunny rabbit adventure\\" is worth your time, think again. There's a lot to love in this tale of destruction, exile, friendship, mythology, allegory, characters, and action.<br /><br />...Don't let all that fur throwyou off.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I am taking a class on leadership and have been assigned many books to read. Out of all of them, this was the most interesting. A good book I would recommend to anyone.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Best game I ever played since I got my amazon account. And I haven't been able to find  a good game on the amazon App Store
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Enjoyed this book so much! The characters are genuine and the story keeps your interest! I highly recommend this one!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is so fun because u can play Facebook friends buy upgrades and buy characters I like so much Awesome
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I found myself thinking so many &#34;What ifs.&#34;  What if this were me?  Would I survive? Would I be brave?  It's a great story about the will to live and the desire to be in control of that living.
B0063IH60K|5.0|solitaire is one of my favorite games to play, when i'm board or waiting for some one i take out my kindle and start to play
034580404X|5.0|Did  not want these  books  to  end  ...  all though  I dont  read  books over and  over  , I have made an  exception  to that  rule with  these  books
B004MC8CA2|1.0|i didn't like how this bible was set up. it didn't make any since to me plus i had to have my wifi on just to read it.
B008OM0EDO|2.0|Tries to be funny, its not that funny.  It has a depth attempt at the end (Spoiler ALERT) when he gives his little speech<br />at the UN or whatever... which makes you wonder about our current state of things in America. Other than that... not<br />memorable.  Just &#34;meh&#34;
B005HSL626|5.0|when i got fruit ninja i wanted to find out what every one liked about it. i do have to say that this is a very fun game to play to pass time.
B0039TD826|5.0|Not a wasted musical moment. It's longer, louder, and more carefully constructed than any other studio album they recorded. This was their peak.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|This is an amazing ap it works like a charm. plus it helps me with my math home work, and bills
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Out of this world entertainment. This trilogy in Blu-Ray really knocked us out.  A must for every classic movie collection.  Add Amazon's usual super service and we were doubly pleased.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Really cool gameplay style. Also, it has lasers and explosions that seal the deal. A must get for superhero fans!
B005LAIIKI|5.0|Throughly enjoyable and as usual Amazon does not disappoint.  Everything came as agreed.  That's why Amazon.Com is the best choice!
B002WJI66C|5.0|I love the Boos from Mario, my favorite enemy in the games, and after the new Luigi's Mansion game I had to buy one for my own. He's small, but not too small, and precious. His tongue is sewn to his underside, so it stays sticking out, and there's actually a hole in the mouth that you can oddly fit your finger into.<br /><br />Still, he's adorable, he's soft, and worth the price!
B009NY43NY|4.0|Just a little predictable.  But a good end to the series.  I just wish the story would have been a bit longer.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Entertaining and fun for the jinn in us all !!!  The  beauty of the forest and Flowers is a relaxing change from the daily hustle &amp; bustle of the city. A Pleasurable game to play.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game was hard but fun I love games like that my whole family has played this game and they ALL liked it. P.S. we have 7person family. Hope you have as much fun as we did. Have fun.
B00CWVFPGO|5.0|a lot of action, the car there  driving in movie is great. a lot of funny scenes .Arnold Schwarzenegger is getting old but still moves well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome!<br /><br />I really liked the way u can interact with people and it actually gives you a feel for the way you take care of a horse.
B003VS0CXS|5.0|The Blue Ray version is simply stunning to watch.  I love this movie and now so does my nearly four year old daughter.  The sing-alongs in the Extras was a nice addition and a great hit with the whole family.  Highly recommended
B001N9ESQ4|3.0|I was kinda dissapointed on this,  instea, i  saw it because there is the tihird one in  the cinema and im about to see it. ***late post. i saw the third one. its amazing.
B000VLE3GA|4.0|It's a good album and has a lot of the songs you want to hear when you think &#34;Led Zeppelin&#34;.
B001NA6096|5.0|I really enjoy it. im about to see the next one. This is my first time that i saw ever.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I found IROM MAN 3 to be innovative as was the first IRON MAN. It is thoroughly engaging and thought provoking. I wasn't sure what to expect. In a way it goes back to basics literally. Man alone, out of his element or is he? Robert Downey Jr. has really defined the cinematic Tony Stark. He definitely has a great screen presence and a notion to continually think out of the box given many moments of over the top flamboyance. Yet, in the end Downey's Tony Stark is just a man. The story tests both the man and the viewer. Many events seemingly or wholly unrelated occur and what is the man to do? What is he about, what metal is he made of? That is what I found very interesting and unique about IROM MAN 3. I think it is a very good film.
B002UOMGVU|4.0|The movie itself needs no introduction, but I'll give it a brief one anyway. It's the classic tale of how Henry Hill always wanted to be a gangster. Through his trials and tribulations, he lived and died (figuratively) by his own sword. It's one of those movies that is not only a classic, but should have won the 1990 Best Picture Oscar.<br />That being said, this review is strictly for the 2010 Blu-ray release.<br />Although it's billed as a '20th Anniversary\\", it looks nothing more than a cash grab. The BD disc is the exact same as the 2007 release. The DVD, which is a documentary on the gangster film in general, has been featured in more compilations than you can shake a stick at. At least the Digibook packaging is something new to the table, and provides some basic info on not only the production but the personnel (actors, director, etc.) as well. It's a good read if you're waiting for the disc load, which quite frankly, takes up no time at all.<br />I truly only recommend this if you, like me, didn't own Goodfellas before. I paid my $25 entry fee for this product, and have no regrets. If you own the original Blu-ray of Goodfellas though, you can safely pass this by.
B00AEBB8BU|5.0|THREE DAYS OF THE CONDOR is a complex suspenseful political thriller directed by Sydney Pollack. A shroud of relentless paranoia permeates the entire film from beginning to end. It is set primarily in New York City and Washington DC and this adds to the drama in a very credible way. Robert Redford is a CIA research reader. He reads books and all forms of written material essentially looking for ideas that his branch may find useful. He reads everything and reports anything pertinent with his team he is stationed with. Things go very wrong and he soon finds that he is a man on the run and he is a target. Why? That is what he has to find out and turn his situation around if he can. Besides Robert Redford, the cast includes Faye Dunaway, Cliff Robertson, John Houseman, Patrick Gorman and Max von Sydow. Redford's character is full of energy and once he directs that energy for his very survival, he becomes a very formidable player in the world of covert affairs. Interestingly, Max von Sydow has such a subtle yet incredibly powerful screen presence.  On screen he effortlessly puts Robert Redford's energy and daring aside with such ease that you will be amazed. Max von Sydow's performance is brilliant and he steals every frame of this film that he is in. And on another note, Sydney Pollack once more proves he was on of the cinema's best directors.
B0063IH60K|5.0|never thought id enjoy solitaire this much. its a nice challenge when I just need to sit and vegetate doing something inconsequential after a busy day at work.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Grate story and tens actions. Like it very much. recommend to see people who like Suits and any solve problems puzzles movie
B005DEVGFG|5.0|Great starter set for dream theater fans. Had a lot of mp3's in past but always wanted the full qualty files. Sound quality is great. Price, very reasonable.
B001O8D47S|5.0|I loved this. first, you should know this is a chick flick, with ONLY WOMEN in it! I can see by the reviews that the guys did not like this movie at all. However, I enjoyed it because it dealt with issues that I actually might think about: divorce, losing a dream job, ups and downs with my women friends. What a relief to see a movie that wasn't obsessed with getting the dream guy and living happily ever after. If you are into those issues, you'll like this movie. It's funny, it slaps on the happy ending, but it's also covers topics that are real and isn't focused only on The Man (although a husband having an affair is certainly a central theme). The cast is amazing and I loved the interactions between the women. Enjoy!<br /><br />I should add, that despite all those topics, it is certainly a comedy.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I really enjoy reading his books. Once I start reading, I have to finish. The Five People You Meet In Heaven was the first book I read, and was immediately hooked on his writing style. Love, love, love his books...can't wait for the next one!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Love it! Great game-play, Different sharks, Awesome, really really good, boats with fishermen, jellyfish, beaches with people, and A GREAT WHITE SHARK!!!!
B00BPWDMP2|5.0|It was a Mother's Day present for my wife.  We saw them in concert and she could not wait to get their next album.  She was so surprised and did not know they had a new one out yet.  Great shipping and also the MP3 download ability.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Picked this up a few months ago after seeing my boys play it. I consider it an easy way to waste away some time that requires just a little digit dexterity. I do like that you dont have to spend money to enjoy the game.
0316044695|5.0|This was a great story.  I enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.  I was never yerning to hurry up and get to the action in this book.  But when it did get to the action, I couldn't put the book down.  The part with them rolling down the hill over and over again and then to be dealing with the locals protecting him was insane.  Great story, from a great warrior.
B00CHILW64|5.0|Great movie. I watched it on my Kindle Fire. Very happy with the ease of use and overall quality, really enjoyed it.
B00CP2Z5TC|5.0|No complaints about this album.  Great songs and the price is low for amazon. You wont regret buying the album.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|There were realistic and no doubt accurate torture scenes. Same with the taking of Osama. The lady who was responsible for finding Osama has my deep appreciation. This is the kind of movie I will watch again and again in times ahead. It showed how hard it was to find Osama. It stays completely away from the president's non-involvement. It stays focused on the actual important points of how finding and killing Osama was done. Very impressive. I feel better informed and much more emotionally attached to the brave and hard working people who pulled it off.
B00BP4X7TG|5.0|This was one of the best movies we have seen recently. That it is based on a true story only makes it better.  Not your usual Hollywood fare.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|My six year old has so much fun with it; when I can't play &#34;real&#34; cards with him, this is a great alternative
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  It's full of moral decisions...how would I react...what would I do in their place?  Looking forward to the sequel.
B003O86FMW|5.0|My favorite book ever! I read this one in about one day. I recommend it to anyone who loved the first one
B004SUDQE0|3.0|It's a decent way to just pass a few hours when nothing else is on.<br />H. Grant is out preformed by the Meaney.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It's just like Mario  it is really fun. I would recommend this game for people who play Mario.I will let you decide
B000SCHC0Q|4.0|I loved the Kite Runner and was slow to get around to reading A Thousand Splendid Suns. I personal felt the break between the two main character's stories in the beginning of the book disconnected.  When they come together again much later the book was off to the races and I couldn't put it down. Worthy read. I'm attendign a book signing for Khaled Hosseini's new book in June - looking forward to reading the new book!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Enjoyed this classic spider solitary game. Like that it has a varietyof play modes. Never get tired o<br />Of playing.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I will miss Sookie but this book provided the perfect, though perhaps predictable ending.  No one was left out.  But Bon Temps will never be the same.
B005723JSQ|4.0|This was my second book by this author and I can't wait to read more of her novels ! I can totally relate t  her characters! You have to read this book!
B00CSYRHG6|5.0|Another amazing studio ghibli movie. The story is fairly simple but still interesting and the characters are easy to care about and make the movie a great watch. Could easily watch this again and again.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz is a very addictive game. Tons of fun! I really enjoy collecting the items in the rooms and the slots are cool too. You also get free stuff every day.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|THIS ONE IS FUN AN RELAXING IT IS WELL WORTH THE CHANCE TO TRY IT, NO PROBLEMS THAT ANY OTHERS.  THANKS YOU FOR THE FUN!!
B00A8M7H42|5.0|I just got mine in the mail yesterday, much faster than I anticipated!  This is the fourth New 52 figure I have purchased and I must say I am in total love with it already!  I uploaded a few pictures, hope they come out okay.  I own Green Lantern, Flash, Superman and now Batman.  I love them all, but this may be my favorite... although The Flash one is pretty darn nifty.  Like the others, the magnetic feet and baseboard was a stroke of brilliance!<br /><br />I can't stress how detailed these figures are.  The level of craftsmanship used to make these couldn't be higher.  From the buttons on the utility belt to the perfectly sculpted cowel, it's flawless execution.  These are pretty much for adults to display and not action figures for kids to play with.
B00CRW2066|5.0|This is a great album I love the national already and this album did not disappoint.  This is as good as some of the earlier albums if not better.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I'm a voracious reader and I must say this is one of the best books I've read in ages.  It will definitely go on the keeper shelf right next to Lord of Scoundrels and A Week to be Wicked.  I'm not familiar with this author but she'll have to go some to top this effort.  Drew was unapologetically wicked, witty and just plain fun.  No woman in her right mind would want him for a boyfriend but having him in her life would never be dull.  Ms. Chase, get busy because I can't wait to see what you come up with next.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|The gameplay is fun and puzzling without being frustrating. The graphics are wonderful and smooth, and the puddings are creative and fun. I have a hard time finding games that I enjoy but this game has made the list!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|The only issue that I have with the BK2 blade (And it's more a recommendation than an issue) would be that the handle could be some more rugged for a better grip. Other than that this is a great blade regardless of the ridiculous price. Great deal!
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I thought this series was a trilogy, but am thrilled to find that there are two Moore coming.  Hurry up, Jeffrey Archer!
B009NY43NY|2.0|First off, I am a HUGE fan of the series, up until 3 books ago.  Id say dont waste your time and read it, but you have to finish off the series.  This book lacked so much compared to the previous books.  It is NOT what I expected to happen at all.  My friends and I are extremely disappointed with where Charlaine Harris ended the series.
B005XLN97M|2.0|The material was very cheap quality! my grandaughter is three and every time she played wih it pieces would fall out.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Extremely user friendly and functional.  I use in conjunction with Evernote to take notes while at church.  Find, Copy, and paste scripture quickly and easily.  Download your favorite version and read off line and take advantage of the reading plans.  There is an audio option with several of the translations as well, and I find myself listening to my daily Bible &#34;reading&#34; in the morning as I am getting dressed.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|This game is like grand theft auto it is a open world and a very good game I give this game a five out of five stars.
B0018M6J90|5.0|I love this movie i seen it on t.v many time and couldn't find it on dvd until now it came super fast in the mail and i watch it over and over again.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|it is a fun game I love the online part and the fact I go up against people I just wish it loaded faster
B000W4HJ44|5.0|I cant believe i found this edition i didnt even know it was one but so happy to get it. i was here in less than a week and been watching it ever since.
159463176X|5.0|This book is amazing. I have been searching for a book that I will remember for the rest of my life and I have finally found it. I bought this book because I bought a kindle and I wanted a book and I am glad I choose this one. You are not going to regret reading this book. You are going to laugh, cry and  think how fortunate we are while you read this book.
B008LZHA3G|3.0|It's getting harder and harder to listen to Dylan's songs be cause his singing voice is almost all gone.  The lyrics are still great.  I find myself wondering if he could hire someone to sing for him.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|Pollan swims in passion in all orders of cooking. Begins with the traditional BBQ in North Carolina and goes through technical, historical and the anthropological aspects of each technique. Must read for cooks, both professional and wanna bees
0618154248|3.0|We bought this box-set for my son as an airplane surprise. He loved the small size and box for the books. My husband and I were disappointed that the stories are shortened versions. Save your money and buy a big story collection instead.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Rooms are so much fun! Increasing in difficulty. You won't be disappointed. Worth the price. I'll be getting it for the kids on the iPad as well!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I like to read easy romance novels on the bus to work and before bed at night. I like books that keep me entertained and wanting more. This is a quick and fun read. The plot is far-fetched but oh well. Not a page turner but I finished it in a couple days nonetheless.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I have this game for the i-pod and really enjoy it.<br />So when I saw it for the kindle I jumped at the<br />chance to download it. The game worked for a<br />little while then started acting weird (characters<br />glitching and doing erradic moves). I deleted the<br />game and downloaded for another try. And got the<br />exact same results. So the game looks like the<br />real deal, but does not deliver. I'd save space on<br />the kindle for something more worthwhile!
1476715904|5.0|Absolutely blew my mind<br />Stop whatever you are doing and buy this NOW! You won't regret it.<br /><br />Then when you are done reading this, you must read \\"point of retreat\\"<br /><br />Seriously. DO. IT. NOW.
B00AKKTDJY|3.0|This game is fun but has advertising that you need to close after every level and on the menu.  There was also some slowdown on my Samsung S3.
B0091WD4ZQ|3.0|I was expecting a dialogue driven movie, and that's exactly what I got.  I just did not think the dialogue was very well written or intriguing.  It's worth watching, but not worth watching more than once.
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I love her musical delivery.  She could make reading a telephone book entertaining and exciting.  She is able to draw the listener into her mood.
B005T87QCI|2.0|I got it and buyt something and then uninstall it and got again and it was not there bad never buy something and uninstall
B008H7HE9S|5.0|A great CD by a great group.  And then of course, there is the  fantastic Adam Levine.  Not sorry I bought this one!
B008EEZ64Y|2.0|Okay so the book was slow and just was to predictable. I always just wanted to fall asleep while reading it. It was basically about a boy in a all perfect society with a lot of secrets. I wouldn't waste a dime on this
B001NLL93W|4.0|City of Glas is one if the best books in The Mortal Instraments. It was action drama (of corse with Isabelle) and tension!! This is a must read book in a must read seriers!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really great app you travel and jump on subways it is super duper cool and it gives you these tips were they tell you how to do better and as you go on it gets harder and harder
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love it.  I come from England and it reminds me of those times.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in those times
B00CH87HF4|4.0|It is a fun rpg and like the factors you can work with others to get through parts of the game. Only thing is it either costs you money to be able to advance or you need to stay at a lower level of the game to build your character.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|This is so much better than that pitiful little magnetic USB cord made for very small people that comes with the earpiece.<br />It plugs into a regular USB cable, gets the earpiece safely stowed and contained, and fits well into a pocket or a briefcase.  Wish it came standard with the Legend - but glad I saw it on the internet.  (And I have already lost the pitiful little OEM USB cable.)<br />Bumped the review up to 5 stars.  This is a neat gadget, and I'm using it daily.
1469265559|4.0|Sound quality was great - especially for people who are extremely hard of hearing.  And I'm a Harry Bosch fan.
B000HL0EEE|5.0|Really good viewing on amazon.com.  I really like Star Trek Enterprise, even though not a whole lot of people do.
0937381888|5.0|When I first ordered this I hadnt even brewed my first batch of beer. After brewing all extract beer for a little over a year now and currently building my all grain system I would say this book is a great buy. Lots of knowledge to be found in these pages.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|The Lord of the Rings 3 DVDs seemed to end at a logical stopping point in the series. The Hobbit seemed to end as if - Well we have two hours worth of film so stop here! When I get the next DVD I will have to view some of the ending of the first one to know where we are at in the story. Other than that it was a great story.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Shows you a lot of the history you dont learn in the typical school history book. Daniel Day-Lewis did a great job in this movie.
B000002L61|5.0|Such great music from the golden eighties and it came to me only after eleven days which isn't to bad. The package wasn't damaged and was sealed brand new and i'm listing to it right now sastified.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|When I bought this I was not expecting much and infact bought it on a whim, but I am glad I did. I was not expecting the show to be as good as it was and ended up buying the 2nd season as well.
B00000HZH7|5.0|This cd came rather quick, a think a week was all it took, and it was in perfect condition. The cd plays just fine and all the songs are a milestone in the early sounds of death metal.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|The first time I watched this I was laughing so hard I was crying and that never happens to me. It was the funniest thing I think I have ever watched. Although I am the type that once I see a comedy movie I can almost never watch it again. I always see the jokes coming. This movie was able to make me laugh again but not like the first time. I would say rent, dont buy, but you should see it.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Left with lots of things unresolved! I'll probably buy the next one to have everything answered. I hope it does. Read it and let us know your opinion.
B000JO9JHW|5.0|I am a big fan of this show and would recommend it to anyone. It's a show that really draws you in.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|Why are there no instructions with games?  Does whoever think them up think the player is on the same wave length?
B0008ENHT4|5.0|THIS IS PROBABLY THE BEST CAR CHASE EVER FILMED. I'VE WATCHED THIS NUMEROUS TIMES AND I SEE SOMETHING NEW ALMOST EVERY TIME I WATCH IT. FOR A BABY-BOOMER CAR NUT THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE COOLEST FILMS EVER WITH ONE OF THE COOLEST HOLLYWOOD STARS. IF YOU KNOW STEVE McQEEN'S HISTORY YOU KNOW HE MADE SOME HISTORIC FILMS - ON ANY SUNDAY, AND LEMANS ARE TWO MUST HAVES FOR ANY GEARHEAD. BULLITT MAKES ME RECALL THOSE FUN TIMES IN THE SIXTIES WHEN LIFE WAS A LOT MORE CAREFREE. ONE OF THE BEST PARTS WAS LISTENING TO THE COMMENTARY OF THE DIRECTOR WHILE THE FILM ROLLED. A CLASSIC CLASSIC FILM FOR A TRULY BARGAIN PRICE!!!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show just gets better and better. The writing is superb, the acting is excellent, and you really get caught up in the action and the lives of the characters. You watch episode after episode because you really want to know what happens next to your favorite characters....and there's something here for everyone. Not for the younger viewer, though....a bit too much language and gore.<br /><br />I'm madly in love with Daryl Dixon and I dont care who knows it!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I loved every minute of it. a great new show I can enjoy with out haveing to watch crap TV!
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I've never been much of a fan of zombie movies, but I've watched this show faithfully now. While there's certainly zombies (walkers) IN the show, that's not really what the show is ABOUT. This is an excellent character-driven ensemble show that'll knock your socks off. The story lines are interesting, the acting is fabulous and the action is intense. And keep that in mind if you have younger viewers at home...there's quite a bit of language and gore. If you're the type who enjoys the improbable, escapist type of show, then you're just gonna love this.<br />Oh...and I'm madly in love with Daryl Dixon and I dont care who knows it.
B000NA2BEU|5.0|Great service. I would use it again for buying any product. I can find anythig I can imagine that I couldnt find anywhere else
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Archer is obviously trying to stretch out this chronicle of the Cliftons.  I thought the story moved too slowly and even for a serial, the ending was much too abrupt.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|I've been hooked on the show for a while now. Reading the book explains everything a lot better. Way more detail. Excellent read
B004TTHLBE|5.0|I had never read anything of Neil Gaiman's until this book.  This book is a classic and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it.  After reading American Gods, I promptly bought two more of his books.  Excellent storyteller.
B003WUYRGI|4.0|Great for your everyday use. Increases your vocab ten fold and its the best thing for your kids. Thank you
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|A very exciting movie, I wanted the tiger to turn friendly but this movie shows the reality of how a wild animal truly is and we need to accept it and treat all wild animals with the respect they deserve and hopefully mankind won't destroy will stop destroying them.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game makes me wonder what it would be like to be a leafman in that game and if it was a real thing that was really happening I would love to be one of the people who don't fight .
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|I had no intentions of taking my daughters to see Wreck-it Ralph...the previews just didn't interest any of us.  We rented it online via Amazon.com this weekend, however and were quite pleasantly surprised.  I found the plot refreshingly different than your typical princess-in-distress (or robots saving the galaxy) family film.  And we all got a quite a few laughs from it.  I would definitely recommend it.
B00AFROVQC|3.0|A good read, but perhaps for a younger reader than myself.  The characters are interesting, and this first book has me looking to the next.
0307389839|4.0|This memoir combines both running and writing; two subjects that I'm definitely interested in.  And Murakami is apparently a well known author, although this is the first I've read of his works.  And I can see why, it was interesting and well written.<br /><br />Murakami was running a jazz bar and in college when he first got the notion to run.  And it stuck.  And then he decided to sell the jazz bar and take up writing.  And that stuck too.  From then on it was a passion that would spread over decades for him, although lagging at times when he developed other interests.  And running is weaved with writing for him so that both have a place in his life.  Although triathlons are taking hold now as well.<br /><br />This is a translated work, but I think it was done very well.  Murakami has a nice approachable voice to his writing and while he doesn't really describe anyone but himself in this book (it is a memoir after all), the few that he does are approached kindly and with positive attributes highlighted.  For himself, he does show all his strengths and weaknesses.  He isn't shy about sharing his success in writing, but nor is he shy about showing his less than stellar run times and goals that he didn't make.  It shows him as a very balanced person.<br /><br />The running is what really interested me in this book.  In fact, Murakami does such a good job of describing running and its effects on the mind and body that it made me feel rather guilty that I haven't been running lately, but blamed it on moving and work and other things in my life.  In fact, if I hadn't already packed my running clothes, I probably would be out there right now the book inspired me so much.  And I liked the way he tied it in with writing.  This book was actually written in short little pieces and then combined together, but the transition was easy and you'd never know it started out that way if he hadn't of told you.  And it was a quick read so it never had a chance to get boring either.  I did think that maybe this book would offer some tips on how to cure my short attention span while running, but Murakami just says that most runners don't always want to run and you can feel that way sometimes.  It apparently is more natural for him and while he does admit that he thinks about all sorts of things when he runs, he is never very precise because he says his thoughts are never very precise.  Not feeling that way when I run, it is hard to relate in a way.<br /><br />But regardless, that fault lies with me, not him.  And this was a very good book to read, although maybe a bit limited in audience.  I don't really see non-runners getting into this book, but that's ok.  For those of us who want to run, it's there for inspiration.<br /><br />What I Talk About When I Talk About Running<br />Copyright 2008<br />174 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

B001E1BNWI|4.0|Love the album. The packaging of the 5 LP box set is great. I'm really glad to have it in my collection. However, the vinyl edition isn't THAT much better than the CD. You'd hope a vinyl edition of an album would kick the crap out of the CD....but not on this one. Some tracks sound much better than others on vinyl. I'm happy with my purchase, and the vinyl edition IS better, but not by a large margin when compared to the CD.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|What else can I say other than this movie is great! I had to have this in order to complete my trilogy.
B008NNNF7G|4.0|I have yet to hear a song by these guys I dont like. This isnt quite as good as the last cd but its worth the but all the same
B008602KQI|4.0|They did a good job overall, there were some missing elements from the book and it was a little less dark<br />. Its based on a novel for teens so a little light weight but I had a good time watching it with my son.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|This game is so awesome!  Everyone in my family loves it so much.  I highly recommend this.  You will enjoy
1118109791|5.0|Awesome...<br /><br />Passed the 1st time with this
B00CWV8TIU|5.0|A satisfying mystery from start to finish. Jude Law is just such such a chameleon as an actor!  Zeta-jones was a surprise. Watch it twice,
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Before buying this I used to use Cooler masters products due to lack of availability in india. Nothing against CM products though.<br />I always used to see in forums that this was the default standard recommended product and i never understood why until i bought and tested this myself.<br />I used it on my laptop and PC (stock thermal paste in both) and in both lowered the idle and full load temps by atleast 6-7 degrees !!<br />Now my laptop runs quieter and doesn't scream so often.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|Cute, easy to figure out, but at least to me, not as addictive as everyone seems to report.  My first experience with AB, and ok, but not something I must do all the time.<br /><br />Rich
0784011710|4.0|Dark movie, great acting for both protagonists.  Sadness pervades movie.  No hope, just struggle with the past. At least that's the way I saw it, but big Meryl Streep fan.
0062082353|5.0|It's well explained how and what he did for his country.  And then think that he was shot when he was home again.
B000VX1CF8|5.0|These are great shoes.  The best boat shoe or casual walking, going out shoe I've owned.  Worth the extra money.
B0058SNIC6|4.0|The shoe fit a bit larger than expected, but it was a good comfortable shoe.  I needed a half size smaller which they don't carry.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Fine series.  Brings that parts of history alive.  Also stimulates discussion on what the Vikings meant to the history of Europe.
B0063IH60K|3.0|too many ads but it's one of the better solitaire apps out there.  video ads are annoying but you can skip them easily.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Although Daniel Craig isn't my favorite Bond, this movie is well worth watching. Strong script, good acting, and excellent action make for an enjoyable 2hr 24min film.<br /><br />My favorite part is the blast from the past in the last quarter of the movie... No spoilers here, but you'll know it when you see it!<br /><br />Great way to spend an evening!<br /><br />Highly recommended...
B00466HN6S|5.0|Wow! i am surprised, after watching this movie on cable! I decided to buy it. My kids love this movie! They want to watch it again and again! I would buy it again!
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|It's a good game, guns are cool and good action with a lot of playing time, you should give this game a try
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Can not let go of the book once I start. Love how stories weaves around the different generations. Very touching!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|As is usual, this story has tension, a bit of humor, twists and turns galore that lead one on an interesting chase.  I have enjoyed Preston's writing in the past and this maitains his tradition of excellence.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|What a great story.  Nicholas Sparks has written another wonderful, warm, and exciting story.  I have to admit that I suspected how the story would end but that was okay.  It still left me satisfied with a smile on my lips.....
B004IPPINW|5.0|Unique style of writing and a gripping, relatable story of individuals struggling to cope with their past and present identities in these current troubling times
B00C2C637I|5.0|Brings me back to the days when nothing mattered but today because tomorrow was a millennia away - and to those perfect autumn days when the color of the sky and the air has that orange glow that disintegrates into a crisp autumn night smelling of both change and stillness- and of the perfect friendship of two boys.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook helps you keep in touch with friends that otherwise would be literally impossible to stay in touch with. The games are also challenging and very addicting.
B00C7JAAH0|3.0|I anxiously anticipated this new effort and I have to admit to some disappointment.  Through at least two listenings there are only a few songs that pull you in.  It is still a good effort but I had hoped for more.
0061980269|5.0|I'd rate it a five by yesterday's standards, but today's books are no longer written or judged the same way. I like it, but I like Athol Dickinson's River Rising better, said to be Louisiana's To Kill a Mockingbird. I did like the ending of this novel and the way the one least expected came to the rescue of the kids.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This is a very good story. At first I had trouble getting interested but soon that was behind me and I was having trouble putting the book down.  The characters are fun to get to know. I also liked the interspersed chapters of one of the main character's past. They were hard to read but really added to the story. I highly recommend this book. You will enjoy it!
B00CW665VI|5.0|THIS BOOK IS UTTERLY BRILLIANT!  The way that it is written I feel like I personally know Drew. His arrogance, his charm, his sinful badness and hilarious wit. He has an uncanny insight to both the male and female species. This book will suck you in from the very first page.<br /><br />I love to use the highlight feature on my kindle so that I can re-read my fave bits but with this book that was impossible. I would have to highlight the whole bloody thing! It is that good!<br /><br />It is not your typical love story and yet it still feels realistic. Told completely from Drew's POV you cannot help but fall in love with him. Getting in his head is definitely a trip you can never forget! I laughed out loud reading this one and I also felt his heartbreak, it brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />I have never read anything quite like it. The writing style is unique, just amazing! I cannot stop gushing about it and will def be re-reading this book again and again. I cannot recommend it enough.<br /><br />So Drew learns about the one thing he never wanted in his life? This is one book you cannot live your life without reading!! Get on it! WOW! Just WOW!!!
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|It starts out pretty intense but mellows out and is a good education for people who don't know much about mental illness.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Very hot and exciting! Loved it!  Reading about drew falling in love was great! Can't wait for another book by Emma Chase :)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The writers are fantastic.  The actors really do their job well.  I'm grateful that this is available.  Big surprise at the end.
141970642X|3.0|I DID NOT GO THROUGH OR READ  IT BUT MY SON DIDN'T ENJOY THE STORY AND SOME OF THE PICTURE ILLUSTRATIONS
B00CL68NOG|4.0|It is a great story that is so typical for the modern woman.  Yea for getting the word out that we can still be respected and live a good life.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This app is amazing. I absolutely love it. I prefer it over textfree and textplus, not to mention you can have it on just about any device.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I was able to sharpen all of the knives in my collection, including a few with serrated blades, without issue and was very satisfied with the results.
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|Really like this CD.  Lots of good music from a great star as far as I'm concerned.  Could listen all day.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I received a copy of Orphan Train by Christina Baker Kline in exchange for an honest review.<br /><br />I have been finding myself really enjoying stories that switch from past to present tense, and I'm glad my shelves are filling with them! I loved going back and learning about Vivian's life in the early 1900's, though of course I was also quite sad. She didn't have a lucky situation when she was on the orphan train, and was bounced through a handful of families until she finally landed somewhere where she felt safe. While I still enjoyed Molly's story and was entertained at how her life was similar to Vivian's, it was really the older woman that took the cake for me. It was breathtaking at times to read how she survived not only the journey to America, becoming an orphan, traveling in the train with dozens of other orphaned children, but then finally the struggles she had with the families who took her in. The ending was so wonderful because readers get so much closure, not just for Vivian, but for other supporting characters as well. This is such a touching read, and a new favorite of mine for the year.
B00006LLNV|5.0|The Best All Time Movie, and the best CD ever!  I absolutely love every single song, and can listen to it over and over again.
B009NY43NY|4.0|After reading the ending to this series, without spoilers, I will say it was a fitting end. I am now rereading the entire series, and I see that the end was more or less told at the beginning! I am looking forward to the final book in the Autumn giving us more of Harris' behind the scenes information. This series is NOT a waste of time.
B005WKKI96|5.0|Really like this CD.  Lots of good music from a great star as far as I'm concerned.  Could listen all day.
B001FB55I0|4.0|...it is still interesting. It's a decent film set in the future where an adult John Connor is fighting the Skynet robots while looking for a young Kyle Reese. Much of the action is predictable and it does feature Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his classic role as The Terminator. This is no Oscar-caliber film, but still worth watching, if you are a fan of the franchise.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|Simply put, I'm sucked into the Reacher series. This one was a good read. I enjoyed the team dynamic as well as typical Reacher bravado.
B004CRR9G0|5.0|Despite being nearly 30 years old, this movie still rates as one the greatest animated movies in history. This movie is derived from an epic manga that was also created, inked and written by Hayao Miyazaki. This movie has some deep political and social overtones, including environmentalist factors. Yet, the movie is still easy to watch and enjoyable.
B0040QYROA|5.0|Metropolis (Fritz Lang, 1927)<br /><br />What is there to say about the magical Metropolis that has not already been said? Not a damn thing, most likely, which is going to do something very rare: shut me up. I'm just going to point you to everything from Roger Ebert's Great Films entry on the 2010 restoration, which adds almost half an hour of footage long believed to be lost (it was found in Buenos Aires in 2008; it had been cut from the original by German censors, who found it objectionable--not terribly surprising in interbellum Germany), or Jonathan Rosenbaum's 2002 review from the Chicago Reader or Thomas Elsaesser's book-length deconstruction of the film and for my part, I'm going to simply implore you to watch the silly thing, in its full, restored glory, and if you are at all a fan of fantasy, science fiction, or horror film, marvel at how incredibly influential this movie has been--you will recognize the source of dozens, maybe even hundreds, of things you've seen in movies since then. [note: sorry to those not reading this at Popcorn for Breakfast, who aren't getting all the links above.]<br /><br />Note when I say \\"restored\\" that I don't mean the new footage is as pristine as it was in 1927. Far from it--the footage recovered in Argentina was not handled all that well (in fact, there was over an hour cut from the film; half of it was not salvageable from the Argentinian print, and what happens in those bits is supplied to us via intertitles), and the difference between the bits included here from the 2001 remaster, which look very good indeed, and the bits from the 2010 restoration is palpable. And it doesn't matter one bloody bit, ghosts of hairs and scratches on the celluloid and dust motes abound and it's still riveting stuff, the kind of movie you can watch in the 2010s and still understand that when people went to the movies in the 1920s, some of them thought they were seeing actual honest-to-filmstock magic happening. And perhaps they were. One of the all-time greats. **** ½he all-time greats. **** ½
B008SGMPVU|5.0|I am SO glad this movie became available in Blu-ray. The last time I saw it was on a rental VHS about 24 years ago. It's directed by John Carpenter (Escape from New York, They Live), so you know it's not going to be anything ordinary. Take nearly every pre-Star Wars Sci-Fi convention you can think of and flip it upside down and you will have some idea of what to expect from this classic film. The Blu-ray transfer is fantastic. Well worth the price I paid for it.
193700788X|5.0|I am sad that this is the last Sookie  book but I understand that the author has to move on.  I really enjoyed reading this last one and am glad that all of the questions were answered to wrap this up in a neat bow.  Thank you Charlaine Harris for 13 wonderful books!
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Robert Downey, Jr gives a great performance as the mythical detective Sherlock Holmes. Jude Law also gives a great turn as Dr. Watson. This a movie which MUST be viewed in HD, so the Blu-ray is the only version to have.

B001V7UXG2|2.0|DO NOT BUY FROM Warp Speed Sales<br /><br />The content is, of course, nothing short of wonderful.<br /><br />My low score and great displeasure has to do with the fact that all of the little tabs, the ones which hold the discs in-place inside of their boxes, were broken and all of the discs were rattling around inside the boxes, against each other (they come two discs to a box) and with the broken off plastic tabs also loose inside, rubbing against and scratching the discs. Return or exchange is not possible and I can only blame the seller for this item being mishandled by them and poorly packed for shipment.<br /><br />TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE!!!!! LOUSY JOB, Warp Speed Sales
B009CF3MEK|4.0|loved it. saw it after watching the new one with Leonardo Dicaprio<br />which I could get captions on the movies

B001FB4W0W|5.0|Just discovered this show a couple of months ago when my friend loaned me the first season on DVD. What a great show! Now I am completely obsessed and have seen all 5 seasons over and over. The first season is still my favorite. I love the slower pace of this first season, a pace that, to me, mirrors the south where the story takes place. The budding romance between Sookie, the main character, and Bill, her vampire boyfriend, is magical! No surprise the the two actors were actually falling in love in real life as their characters were also falling in love. Their chemistry pretty much jumps off the screen and smacks you in the face it's so real and palpable. The scene in the second episode where Bill says to her &#34;I can smell the sunlight on your skin&#34; is probably the hottest thing I've ever seen on TV. And props to actor Stephen Moyer (Bill) in that scene, as he goes from lust to wonderment to sadness and then longing, all within about 30 seconds and all done without any more words. LOVE LOVE LOVE this show!!!!!!
B004J4WNL2|4.0|I like how this book uses psychology to back up everything. I never knew how much of an introvert I actually am. However, I should have realized it by the fact that I bought the book.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|I LOVE Jeffrey Archer but I was disappointed with this 3rd book of the series.  I got bored with the political viewpoint.  By the time I got to the middle I couldn't believe that I just put it down....

B00BF11STU|4.0|The hunting down of Osama Bin Ladin a very interesting story indeed!  The movie reveals how close we came to missing the opportunity.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Wool is a well-written story with well developed characters & plot twists that will keep you going.  None of the twists are outlandish, however, once they're discovered they just propel you deeper & deeper into the silo.  Can't wait to read more from this author.
B007L6VR12|5.0|As two 12-year-olds calmly discuss the pros and cons of getting married, beside them a Khaki Scout drops from a two-story platform onto a trampoline, proceeding to turn somersaults as the earnest conversation progresses.  And that, ladies and gents, aptly demonstrates the highly nuanced, charming quirkiness of Wes Anderson's MOONRISE KINGDOM. Until seeing this film I was unaware of this director, but count me in as a fan now.  Anderson can make a film that not only is entertaining, charming, and downright funny--he can create images and sets and combos of colors that are as mesmerizing as they are haunting.<br /><br />MOONRISE KINGDOM is the story of two tweeners--an orphaned boy (Jared Gilman) who deserts his Khaki Scout troop, and a troubled girl (Kara Hayward) who runs away from home to join him in the wilderness of a New England island in the late summer, as a massive storm approaches.  The pair develops a budding camaraderie and romance (all tastefully done, I might add), and a firm determination to elude the considerable search that's been launched to find them.  Gilman and (especially) Hayward have considerable talent; I look forward to following their acting careers.<br /><br />Yet MOONRISE KINGDOM is peaked by its stellar ensemble cast, including Edward Norton as a gung-ho Scout Master, Bruce Willis as the island's lone policeman guiding the search, Bill Murray and Frances McDormand as the girl's frightened (yet dysfunctional) parents, Tilda Swinton as a stark, bureaucratic Social Services worker, and Harvey Keitel as a take-no-prisoners Scout Commander.  Special kudos to Bob Balaban, playing the story's deadpanned narrator that constantly had me in stitches.  In fact, if you don't have a grin on your mug from start to finish of the delightfully nuanced MOONRISE KINGDOM, then maybe you just need to lighten up.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.

B000YMHOUS|5.0|&#34;Pleasantville&#34; is a beautiful film that, to me, focuses on what happens when we break out of what is the &#34;norm&#34; and embrace our true passions.  Shot mostly in black & white, color is only added as people &#34;wake up&#34;!  My sixth graders were reading &#34;The Giver&#34; by Lois Lowry about a dystopian society (long before &#34;Hunger Games&#34;!) and this movie illustrates it beautifully.  Because of the rating and a couple of suggestive scenes I could not show the whole film to them but oh, did it make an impression.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|I think it is better than Sonic Boom from 2009.  It is certainly better than Unmasked or The Elder.  However compared to Revenge, Destroyer, Love Gun, Creatures of the Night, and Rock N Roll Over this album is not even close to that league.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app! Easy to use and I like the size which makes it easy to see without my reading glasses!
B00BXVKKPA|4.0|Very good album here.  In line with the previous 2 Airbourne records.  They remind me of AC/DC of 2013.  If you liked the 2 previous records you will like this one.

B008O5POWC|5.0|This album took a lot of criticism when it was released; however, it has withstood the test of time.  In Fleetwood Mac's 2013 tour, they performed many songs off the album, which sounded great.  Definitely recommended!

0345803485|4.0|The first book was the best, the second wasn't too bad, and the last one was rushed in my opinion.  The best thing about the third book was the very end when you read how they met from his point of view.  Oh my goodness, it was really hot!  My fiance couldn't stand me getting worked up over an imaginary character, but he did enjoy the end results!
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|I like this game wish you had more options under the free play, longer time to play less of trying to get you to buy the game.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really don't play it, but my daughter loves it. She picked the game up from her grandmother. Challenging game for her.
B005LAII80|1.0|This movie is good if you are 12 years old!  I'm a big fan of action movies, but Sly, Arnold, Bruce Willis or Van Damme would never make such a piece of junk. Jason Statham has some great and not so great films, but I doubt he would get involved in such silliness. I would rate it as a negative 4.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|Its a great book to read and follow for any woman starting a career, to mid career or senior level. The downside is that cultural obstacles that influence a woman's choices & priorities at work or home are not mentioned and the book doesnt help much with that agenda.
B0079XPUOW|3.0|I thought the story itself was well done, but it wasn't a Star Trek story and lacked the polish it would have had, as such.
B009X01GJ2|5.0|Not a computer savoy person but set it up and is very user friendly. Nice size screen and cannot believe what it can do.
B008BU75IQ|3.0|Not as good as the other two books in the series.<br /><br />Plot was very thin.  I was left hanging again at the end so there may be another book coming.
0810970686|5.0|Funny stuff!  My son, who isn't a huge reader zips through these books.  I have already bought him the next one in the series.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|My kids (yes, I know there are so not so great words in this movie), but my kids know the difference between right and wrong and know not to repeat those words.  The music is great and fun...and they love all the characters.  We have watched this several time since purchasing!!!
B006BGZJJ4|3.0|Cables are pretty much the same from my perspective.  Would be nice to have one universal one that fits other things.  Couldn't tell from the description whether or not it came equipped when I bought the Kindle Keyboard.
6300216802|5.0|I was very impressed with the way the pkg looked upon arrival and the fact it came so promptly. Id definitely order from this person again. Very happy with my product as well.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|I have waited for 3 days for this to show up on my Fire.  I am still waiting.  So I can not say if this is a good app or not.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I enjoyed this book the whole way through, it has become one of my favorites. I recommend it to anyone who has a love for dogs, and everyone who loves a fantastic book.
0470901071|4.0|An instructor and friend referred me to this book and so far I'm glad for it. I'm looking to take my CCNA exam at the end of the summer and try and work through a section every day or so. For me it was easy to follow and help cover things I didn't feel comfortable with after leaving class. If you are looking to take the CCNA test, i would offer the same advice and tell you to invest in this book as a study guide.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Just like the first two of the millennium series, the girl who kicked the hornet's nest keeps you captivated in twisted, freaky Sweden.
B00AECDDYY|4.0|An enjoyable take on tower defense.  Fun to play.  It is reasonably challenging and graphics are pleasing to the eye on my Galaxy S3.
B00873GRU4|5.0|Interesting world that Howey has constructed here - and a nicely paced exploration of human nature in such an environment. There were a few twists early on that had me reading way past my bedtime, all concluded with a semi-satisfying ending. I couldn't help but think that this would be good material for a film.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I started watching the show before I read the book. I have faces to go with names. I can't put it down.
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|Love bradley and Jennifer, but NOT in this movie.  20 min of ending was best part, however 2 of 3 of us made it to 1:37 min and ditched the last 20 min...toooooo boring.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|One of the best shows on tv. It is by far my favorite program. I would recommend this to everyone.
B00009TB5G|5.0|I love this special extended edition pack! I've gotten so many compliments on the box. The special features themselves aren't that great, but I'm just happy to get to watch the extended version of the movie. Love it!!
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app's not easy to use--if and when it works. It crashed so much I gave up on it and got Playtube, which works Much better.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|This was a great deal! Not only can I enjoy The Hobbit as a DVD, but I can now watch it anywhere on my computer or phone.
B00C8985DU|5.0|Years in waiting for this live album to be re-released. Pricey but worth the investment. One of the best live albums ever.
193700788X|4.0|I'm not sure why most were so unhappy with the ending? Did anyone honestly think she would end up with anyone else? If you are waiting to read the reviews before purchasing don't let the low score scare you away. It could have been terrible considering how slow and frustrating the last two books were. I think Charlaine Harris did do the characters justice and let Sookies have the best ending possible.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|It is suspenseful and somewhat funny, you can almost believe in the creatures, and the characters are engaging! I'll keep watching to see what happens!
B002984AJI|5.0|great white vinyl! I loved that from the beginning! If you are a collector dont hesitate at all! you ll like it!
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|It is astonishing what the human body and spirit can endure. Shin's story of survival is incredible. I've always been fascinated with the country hidden behind the veil and this novel provides a saddening glimpse into one of the most secret places in the world.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are incredibly talented and the fact that they have come up through the indie ranks and continue to be independent makes their story even more impressive. I can hardly wait to see what the future looks like for these guys!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Chilling but with the ring of truth. Even to-day, too little is made of the fears that were part of everyday life in USSR.<br />I highly recommend this book.
B008602KQI|5.0|THANKS AMAZON PRIME! I enjoyed this movie on my kindle fire, what i loved more that with Amazon Prime they have new release free of charge.
B003WE9TU8|4.0|Didn't think it was possible for a serious book in the zombie genre, but Brooks sort of manages it.<br />The format - a series of witness accounts - can be a little tedious at times, but ultimately it's a very good, clever idea tolerably well executed. If you can see yourself reading one proper zombie book in your life then I guess this is your best bet.
0679809015|5.0|My Grand Daughter loves this book.  She has played with the prior book until it was totally destroyed.  I purchased her a new one and she seems to love this book.  I also purchased one for the United Way Summer Reading Program.  This is a very intertaining book for young toddlers.  It has doors you open with barn yard animals
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|LOVE LOVE.LOVE IT FOR MY.KINDLE.HD PLEASE MAKE A NEW ONE W NEW BOXE HIDDEN TREASURES AND STORY LINE SO I CAN ENJOY IT ALLLLLL OVER AGAIN. I RECOMMEND IT GAME TO SOOOOOO MANY FOLKS. Gives us mom's a chances to return fro. Toodler land!
B001X0ZKM4|5.0|Great followup to the original!!  Love the Penquin and Catwomn.....Meeeeow!!!  Keaton is again wonderful in reprising his role as Batman!!!!
B006GECE9Y|1.0|The Appstore says it is not compatible with my Kindle Fire HD,and it will not install.But everyone here says it works amazing with the Kindle.Am I doing something wrong?
B000GWE44U|5.0|A classic by all rights, Nicholson is great in this one.  Cannot wait to watch this again on Blu Ray!!!!  :)
B00992CF6W|5.0|I know it is a lot pf money but it is worth it. Even if your a parent this will keep your kid busy and I mean really busy. I love to play this but sometimes i cannot stop.  I reccomend this game. I love how you can build anything. Minecraft is amazing!<br />~ j&euro; \  \ @
034580404X|5.0|Too bad it wasn't me that had the fantastic idea to write the story!  Will there ever be another series, as  in when the kids grown up?!
B003MS7V8G|3.0|It was a okay story.  Reminded me of the LWFC book, in that the food had some &#34;magical&#34; aspects.  The music was really good, probably the best aspect of the movie.  You'll probably like it if you're a huge Penelope Cruz fan.
B002U3CCKQ|4.0|I couldnt give it a 5 because some of it was so disturbing I nearly didnt finish it. However I do think she is a very good writer and I have enjoyed all of her books I have read so far.
B009NY43NY|2.0|Even though I had a feeling this was the direction was going take after finishing the previous book, I was hoping it was just a misdirection.  Alas no.  I felt who she ended up with was taking the easy way out.  For several books ( must of the series in fact) it's been set up as a rivalry between Bill and Eric..  Not to mention ots been billed as the Southern Vampire series  The others were just blips on the radar through out.<br />Harris says people's disappointment is due to the fact it didn't end how they wanted.  I did have my favorite, but either of those 2 would have made sense and I could have accepted it. (I didn't like the fact she killed of Claudine, but that didn't make me dislike the series.)  That she ended up with Sam seems to come out of nowhere to me.  Sure they had a flirtation,but never seemed serious and was never developed.  And it was almost presented as he was the logical choice because he was &#34;next in line&#34; and not because of developing feelings.  Eric is practically nonexistent in this story after being a central character in the last several books and Bill has suddenly gotten over his love like one gets over a cold.  This story felt very forced to me, with out a lot humor that was apparent through out the rest of the series.<br />I didn't want to read the reviews before reading the book so I could make my own decision, but now I wish I had, so I could have gotten this from the library instead of spending the money on.  So very disappointing having vested so much in these characters over the years.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|Great Movie Bella was so beautiful I really am tired of people talking junk about Kristin she's a great actress and she is human and will make mistakes just like everyone of us. Just because she is a star it doesn't give people the right to judge every little flaw they can find. Be strong Kristin you have a lot of fans who love you for you.
B004CURZFC|5.0|Great story. The animation is top quality. A wonderful story for the whole family. I unreservedly recommend this movie for those interested in family entertainment!
B000QXDED6|3.0|Good but not really my favorite. But I will anything Garade Butler stars in.  I loved him in PS I love You and Law abiding Citizen he can play any part and do it great. I love all his movies!
B005LAIHPY|5.0|WOW! What an action flick! This story starts somewhat quirkily but I think the opening episode is illustrative of the main character's abundant flaws and strengths. This one will keep you on the edge of your seat from about 20 minutes in to the end.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Well I like  everyone else I wasn't happy with the last book.  Many things changed from the other books like Sookie not being able read supernaturals thoughts. And Eric just caved and left Sookie for money and power of corse he really didn't have a lot of choice but sure didn't fight hard for Sookie or for Pam. But loved the story lots of books don't end the way I want. I'm not the author. Still loved everyone and own every book in collection. Keep going Charlene you still have a lot loyal followers.
B009K916ZK|5.0|Works like a charm (as do ALL Apple products) and was delivered extremely quickly! If you need such an adapter, this one will work for you.
B00B4804KS|5.0|As we all know, this is one of the greatest movies made! It was way beyond its time when it released and to this day it still competes with the CGI and effects of brand new movies. The 3D on this is among the best I've seen. It looks like it was just filmed yesterday. If you own a 3D theater then this is a must own for your collection!
B001O4XWJM|5.0|This is a VERY dark movie. Quite violent and probably does portray a side of the raw West that was less than savory. The acting by Ed Harris, Viggo Mortensen, Jeremy Irons and especially Renee Zellweger was top-notch. Very believable and was true to the language of the time.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|I totally love it. Its definitely worth the price that I paid for it. Something that is inexpensive and elegant at the same time.
B008FSCNTK|4.0|Not sure what the negative reviews are all about.<br />Diana Krall takes a nice departure here, but not too far.  This is where the blues and soul elements come in.  The production on this record couldn't be more perfect. The album takes a journey you need to be on.  Just listen to it and if you don't understand, listen again, and again.  It will sink in.  It's certainly different and I feel the necessary next step for her.  I'm sure we will get another standards record from her soon enough.  Just buckle up and get Glad...This one is worth it.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|Love this app!!!!!!!So if you love pets you will love this app its awesome!!:)So GET IT!!!!I bet you will love it!!
B003P2WO5E|5.0|One of my favorite books ever.  I can only hope the next books in the series are as well done, which I'm sure they will be as I have yet to read anything by Brandon that I don't like...
B003DS9ECQ|5.0|The movie was awesome no wrong things with it just fun and entertaning. Funky Pony likes it. Awesome love it.
B00BWJARHO|1.0|They added stuff that wasn't in the book and changed stuff that was in the book.  Gandalf's character wasn't portrayed correctly, they white washed his guile with Bilbo.  The Goblin King was illustrated like a bad children's cartoon.  And they think they are going to string me along for another three movies of this?  NOPE.  That would be like six hours of my life I could never get back added on to the three I already lost.  HATED IT.
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|Great game. Controls are a little touchy but cant ask for much more. If your lookingnfor an fps look no further.
B005I6EU48|5.0|I love the way this kindle cover looks, the visual pun is endlessly amusing to me. I'm happiest about the fact that this cover also fits the kindle 3 keyboard. The product is advertised for the kindle fire, but the dimensions just happen to work out for the kindle 3 keyboard as well. The bottom right corner elastic strap sometimes gets in the way of the power button, but it's easy enough to move around. That's pretty much the only minor issue I have with the product, otherwise, I love it. There's a large interior pocket in the inside front cover where I keep a microfiber cloth to keep the screen clean.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|This movie was full of action, adventure, twists and laughs. It was one of the best movies I have seen in a long time. It is the perfect movie in this series of movies. I recommend it to everyone.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I am so glad that a friend recommended this book. I couldn't put it down, and have now bought the rest of the series on my Kindle.
B005LAIIJY|4.0|I enjoyed this movie but should be rated PG18. The acting is well done great ending to the movie but a little over the top.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I have never been so happy to be finished with a series before. The last couple Sookie books have been painful to read and this one was no exception. It took a couple tries before I could finally force myself to just get it over with. I have never been a huge Harris fan but I liked her well enough that I've read her other stuff too. I don't know what went wrong with this series but it went from a series that I really liked to being a train wreck that I couldn't look away from. These books have turned to crap, its like Harris stopped giving a damn about any of the characters.<br />*Spoiler* With that being said, I am in no way surprised that Sookie ends up with Sam. I saw this coming a while ago so I was not holding out for her to end up with Eric. I don't like the way Eric's story ended but he's a bad ass vamp and Sookie was kind of lame anyways. Eric is better off without her. Sookie was not very nice to her friends in this book either. She seemed rude and ungrateful that they were all kind enough to stop everything they were doing and rush to help her. Oh, she said thank you enough times but she was not very sincere about it. She was no heroine in this book, she was more like a whining damsel in distress that didn't appreciate being saved. I don't know what Harris will write next but I for one am not looking forward to it.
B000SEJHRA|5.0|David makes me look at life a little differently and he makes me laugh! Gotta love a man who can make you laugh.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Very confusing, hard to follow,  I never understood what the movie was about and I finally gave up on it!
B0056BMK6K|4.0|This book cleared up the &#34;where the heck do I start?&#34; question that was stopping me from starting. Fun and quick read too.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|For a no-brain read, it's not too bad. James knows how to keep you reading. But their relationship is infuriating, I would have dumped him ages ago--he's far too controlling. No women should aim to have a relationship like this, and it's a pity James is putting that out into the media. In book one, the sex scenes were new and exciting...but a hundred pages into book two and you realize that they're really all the same.
B009R659L8|5.0|Loved this book!  So many twists and turns, it kept me guessing until the very last chapter.  Mary Higgins Clark at her Best!
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book was just as captivating as the last. I don't want to wait a year for the next one. I love America's free will and independence and it reminds me of my own. I would highly advise reading this book.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|I truly enjoyed this movie a great deal. Realistic depiction of a serious mental illness that affects so many individuals and their families. The acting in this movie is superb, especially the performance given by Jennifer Lawrence. She is beautiful and talented. Very well directed and written. A movie I could watch over and over again. I now own this movie...
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|First, let me say that in spite of a vast age difference I am in love with Jennifer Lawrence.  Smitten.  That having been said, in my opinion, all of the Oscar hoopla over this film was a result the Academy's effort to bring a mainstream, date night film into the mix. Seeking a younger demographic. Best picture candidate it is not.  Seems contrived, unimaginative and the dialogue is full of filler.  Jennifer, however, at least makes the film watchable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My daughter loves the challenge of getting all the coins!  She has even gotten her father hooked on this game!  She has it on every phone/tablet that we allow her to use!
B004TMPJP6|5.0|I've used Wunderlist for over a year now, and it has always proved to be a very useful tool in organizing tasks.<br /><br />When you are able to have the same set of lists/tasks shared across all your devices it's very convenient to manage tasks.  I frequently use the Desktop version to add/modify lists, and then use all my portable devices accordingly.  The Fire version is usually used around the house whereas my phone for work tasks mainly.<br /><br />Wunderlist has been a very worthwhile investment of my time.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|My daughter loves playing this game.  She tells all of her friends that they need to get it for their Kindle Fire.  She has also downloaded it on her dad's phone and her grandma's phone! :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Reading this book is like being caught in a cornfield maze. Every time you think  you've figured it out, the maze gets deeper with no end in sight until the very last page.  I read it in two days... now I need some sleep!!
B00CWVFZ8W|1.0|This is the kind of movie that has decent previews but that is it...the cast is not bad except for the main characters who take up 90% of the movie. This movie is BORING, doesn't really have a great plot, and the ending is what I would call anti climatic. I haven’t read the book, but I hear if you did the movie is EVEN WORSE.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|All the people who played a role in the movie were awesome. The true story was displayed well in the movie.
B0092AAVR6|2.0|I first read this book decades ago and thoroughly enjoyed it.  This has always been one of my all-time favorite books.  I've reread my copy so many times that the book is literally falling apart.  Unfortunately, this copy of the book isn't quite right.  There are duplicate pages, some pages have the first or first two letters of words cut off along the entire left side of the page and some pages have the endings of words cut off on the entire right side--as if the page had not been centered correctly while being photocopied.  Some of the printed lines are wavy as if the page had been moved during photocopying.  There a few blank spaces in words where letters should be.  There are even a couple of typos that the original editor should have caught.
B0094K1QR8|1.0|Don't waste you  time.  I started the movie and could not watch it. Then turned it off.  It was terrible.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids loved this movie.  It was a clean movie too so I did not have to worry about then watching it and seeing or hearing something not appropriate.  Not horrible to watch as an adult either.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game is chock full of fun and has no shortage of available quests which can be a problem in some games. I can't wait to see the movie after playing the game.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|This game made me want to watch the movie badly. It is a very fun game! Time just flies when I play it, making it a good travel game. Well worth the download space!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This game is clean fun that is great for all ages. Young children can play with ease and the sound track is soft and relaxing. Graphics are authentic to the movie and any Nemo fan will love it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|The app is a fun game, yet it is kind of hard to get started out. Some of the goals are a little out of a beginner's league unless you just leave things sit for a couple days. Other than that the app is pretty fun and was at least worth trying out and I would recommend it if you're bored and looking for something to do.
1481879103|5.0|Not a typical ghost story is right...It is a unique, fresh, funny ghost story... and so heartwarming in the end!<br /><br />This clever story is told more from the ghost's point of view. May Trump is a stubborn 75 year old woman that has just discovered that she is dead and she can be heard by the living. May had me laughing from the first chapter; she is a colorful, genuine character. Her talking back to the people on 'the gossip shows' on television reminded me of my own Grandmother. May's only soft spot is for Mr. Kibbles her dead cat until she is drawn to help a recently deceased ghost and the ghost's living daughter. May, Penny, Gary and Chloe team up with an equally entertaining group ladies that dabble in the supernatural. The story is full of humor as May and the others try to figure out how to accomplish their goals. I love the cauliflower on the mannequin and May's matter of fact reactions to these odd situations.<br /><br />The author really brings this story to life with all rich characters and realist interactions. Peter John did an excellent job of making the characters believable, even lovable. George is written just how I would expect him to sound having died so long ago. May's time period in the other realm captivated my attention as well. Then the plot thickens and just when I thought I could predict the direction of the story it went another way! I was thoroughly entertained throughout this book and anxious to know what was going to happen to May in the end. I almost cried during the last chapter; I had a big smile on my face too. The ending is perfect and I had no clue that it was going to happen. This is a brilliant story and I highly recommend it to anyone that loves a great ghost story.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|I absolutely loved this novel. If you're a casual fan, or a lifelong fan like me, you have to read it!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I got this book not really knowing what to expect.  It was one of the cheapest ebooks and it was highly rated so I thought I'd try it out.<br /><br />The story is well written in everyway.  By the time you get to the 4th book you are reading feverishly trying to find out what happens.  It all builds at an appropriate tempo.<br /><br />This series would make a great movie or series of movies.  I really hope that is in the works.<br /><br />Read Shift after this if you want to find out how they ended up in the silo in the first place.
B003H4I4JU|4.0|The story is good, this is beyond doubt. Same as the writing, really good, makes the characters &#34;pop up.&#34;<br /><br />What was less good, tho, was the main character: A bit too messiah-like, a bit too preachy, But not in an overt way. Hard to explain. Let's put it in this way: What kept me awake reading this book was the tension through it all, and what eventually made me fall asleep, was Ender and his.. ways.<br /><br />I don't think I'll read further, since I get the idea that this is the kind of sagas that will never end, even after it jumps the shark.<br /><br />Personally I think the first book was fantastic and was great as a story by itself, and didn't need sequels/prequels.
B00005JNTX|5.0|I had a great experience. My DVD arrived on the date they said it would and it was also like new as it was listed.
B00687PWQG|5.0|Watched episode 1. Will definitely be continuing the series! Paul Giamatti and Laura Linney are fantastic in their roles. Abigail Adams finally gets some props!
0425269205|5.0|This is a gorgeous linen bound signed copy of Charlaine Harris' Dead Ever After.  It comes in a nice case and is worth every penny.  Love it!!
B009NY43NY|3.0|Didn't love it, but felt committed to finish the series. The series has been progressively declinging, but I was a huge fan of the first few books.
B007L5KT76|5.0|Excellent,  was fun to watch on my big scrren tv, have ordered seveal more since this great experience<br />Thanks  for a great experience
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|What more can I say?  Great movie- wouldn't let my kids watch it but that said- not as much violence as Kill Bill.  Tarantino is great at pulling out superb performances from excellent actors and this flick is no exception.
B000FC146C|5.0|An elderly lady told me about it watched the series on TV so I had to buy the book. It highlights strengths and weaknesses and shows how true love plays out.  I would definitely recommend it to friends.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|What a great story. It was so exciting that we never got a chance to sit back.  More is not better.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is a ton of fun! It allows you to still earn money even when your not playing which is a huge improvement from some of the other games.
B001ANYDAO|2.0|Coincidentally, I read the chapter about the relative ages of hockey players while I was watching the Chicago Blackhawk beat the Detroit Red Wings in game 7 of the western finals. I thought \\"wow this is an amazing insight!\\" However, after a quick check of the birth dates for the players I found Malcolm's conclusion to be bunk. Contrary to the book, there is an almost even distribution of birth months for the team members I checked multiple years and countries of origin just to be sure that I hadn't discovered another \\"Outlier\\". After this discovery,I have to call into question all that I have read from him. Maybe the book should be renamed to \\"Outliars!\\"
B002Y0TGOU|5.0|watched the new release this weekend at the thearter, but did not like it.  Had to come home and watch the 2009 release to demonstrate to kids that STAR TREK is good
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Great vocals.  Watched it twice while we had it rented.  Could have done without some of the language, but the music made up for it.
B00CWVGBEO|3.0|not bad Arnold was back in movies which is good. It was the best story or acting but good to see Arnold back.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|I rented it just to watch Josh, anything he's in is great. I loved the movie and Julianne did a great job as well.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|I thought it was a good game for a mystery. I recommend buying the full version because you can't get too far in the game without it.
B0096HK46S|4.0|An 80's  cult classic that is held up well over time. This movie brought me back to high school and reminded me to stop and enjoy the movies.
B005HJU7HA|5.0|What ever is a foot, Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson can uncover the answers, bringing the rightly person to justice. I enjoyed reading these in my youth, and they did not fail me in this reading. Recommending this book is a  Very pleasing task for me, as it would be a very good addition for young or old
B00CDT41RY|4.0|This is everything you should expect from a Tarantino film.  Witty, engaging dialogue, over-the-top violence, hilarity, and moments that will make you feel uncomfortable.<br />Christopher Waltz steals the show in my opinion.<br /><br />Strongly recommend.
B007HJ96NO|5.0|\\"Cinema Paradiso\\" is a film that, if you pay attention, warns its audience about two things: maintaining a healthy and balanced life and how love is transformative. While watching this film, the audience comes to understand who Salvatore is, what he becomes, and how a man named Alfredo is responsible. Life Alfredo, Salvatore is passionate about films. However, Alfredo sees Salvatore's potential, and leads him down the path to become a successful filmmaker. However, Salvatore's profession is not without complications, as he is a man who, as the film evolves, is shown to be missing the presence of love in his life. This film is more than telling a narrative about a little boy's love of movies, or about the father-figure who nurtures it. This film ultimately shows how one must ensure that love must be present both in one's personal and professional life. Life is more than just an imitation of the actions seen on the big screen. Although we can learn from the many messages movies attempt to promote, life must be experienced. This is the lesson that Salvatore finally comes to realize at the end of this moving, honest, and nostalgic piece of cinema history.

In the end the story has proven to the doctor that science sometimes does not conform to the beliefs of ordinary people. The Almighty has His own way of showing us that beliefs are true and challenging to our surprise and understanding.
B00C8985DU|4.0|I normally don't spring for these \\"super deluxe\\" edition sets. They tend to be way over-priced, and the format applied to albums not necessarily deserving of the treatment.<br /><br />Wings Over America is different. When the album was recorded and released, Wings were at their commercial peak; the album's release came during a part of the 1970s when a number of great live albums were released (most notably Frampton Comes Alive! and, though probably not heard much beyond AOR radio, Little Feat's Waiting for Columbus); and its triple-LP configuration meant fans were getting an entire show when they bought the album. It was also notable for its inclusion of Beatles songs, which McCartney had become notorious for refusing to perform as a solo artist.<br /><br />The CD editions that have been available to date (the original Columbia reissue, and the subsequent EMI edition) have been huge disappointments, with their bare-bones packaging and dull sound. Sadly, Wings Over America was overlooked when McCartney's back catalog was remastered in 1993.<br /><br />The newly released editions make up for this in a big way. Warmth has been restored to the low end, while the high end now actually has some identifiable detail. As with the 2009 Beatles remasters, a little bit of compression has been applied, but not so much as to overpower the listener with loudness. You can actually turn the volume up without committing the sonic equivalent of shock and awe on your eardrums.<br /><br />But the real star of the deluxe edition is the packaging. Four discs (3 CDs, 1 DVD) and four books in a sturdy slipcover. The book in which the discs are stored is by itself a veritable treasure trove. Photos, reproductions of backstage passes and concert tickets, notes, lyrics--even a reproduction of the tour program. And I haven't had a chance to fully explore the goodies, so I know there are things I haven't discovered yet.<br /><br />There's also a card included with a code that can be used to download high-resolution 96 kHz/24-bit WAV files of the music on the 3 CDs--no limiting applied. That gets you as close as you can get to the original masters without actually being one of the people involved in producing this remastered edition.<br /><br />If you can afford the extra cost, this deluxe set is well worth the money. It almost makes up for the crappy sound of the CD editions we've been stuck with up till now.<br /><br />Addendum (5/30/13): The third disc, Live at the Cow Palace, is kind of redundant. On the plus side: The performances are a bit rougher (no studio overdubs, presumably), and there's a little bit of stage chatter included--something notably lacking from the album proper, and actually quite refreshing. It's the song selection that lets down the side. \\"Picasso's Last Words\\" is a nice song, but doesn't necessarily merit inclusion a second time, and fully half the songs on the disc are from the acoustic set. It's likely that there wasn't any material available not already covered by the original album (I haven't read the essays yet, so I don't know if this is addressed or not), but one would think that a more exciting track listing could have been chosen--or even additional tracks included, seeing as how the disc is a short 28 minutes in length. I think an opportunity was missed here.nload high-resolution 96 kHz/24-bit WAV files of the music on the 3 CDs--no limiting applied.

B006Y5EDRG|3.0|I loved the first episodes of this series that takes you behind the scenes of creating a Broadway musical. It has high production values across the board as you would expect from such a star studded crew both behind and in front of the camera. Most of the musical numbers were memorable and Katharine McPhee really shines. However, the writers chose to turn Smash into a soap opera in later episodes which I found very disappointing.
B00BNXOMHA|5.0|When I purchased this set I expected a little bit more like a short story to go along with the entire saga all in all I still like the purchase!!!!!!

B003QTUQGU|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this movie. old tyme favorite brought anew. always something new to notice in this masterpiece of color, scenes and characters.
B004SIPA4G|5.0|I am a big fan of graphic novels, so to see one made into a live action film was unreal. This Blu-ray has a nice amount of material to kick back and watch, and even has an interactive game, which while kind of cheesy was also cool. Since this is a review about the product and not the movie, i'll say that as a package, it's typical fare for a blu-ray disc. But the content is pretty good and interesting. Definitely worth the money.
B0023SDPS6|5.0|After becoming hooked on the TV show, I really was eager to start reading the Craig Johnson series of books.  Walt Longmire is the guy you want protecting your county and Mr. Johnson gives him such a depth and quality that you really wish you could vote for him as your sheriff.  The character development and relationships between Walt, his friends, deputies and acquaintances is outstanding.  Spending a little time out West, Mr. Johnson paints a beautiful picture of this vast, complex yet inviting part of our country.  Everyone needs a friend like Henry.  Everyone wants a co-worker like Vic and everyone deserves an old guard like Walt.  Mr. Johnson has delivered them all.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|A little bit slow in the beginning but not a bad movie, the ending was a little unexpected but perhaps expected at the same time for a Nicholas Sparks movie. I don't think the man in your life will enjoy it too much but it's good for a girls night in!
B00000F214|5.0|It is one of those movies that is an instant classic. it never gets old and you can watch it over and over and over again. its completely plot driven but the acting is terrific and the performance by Kevin Spacey is the best you will ever see. A must have for any crime lover. Can't say enough good about it. Who is Keyser Soze? What a memorable villain. If you haven't seen this buy it and find out how great is truly is.

B004ZMWUCU|3.0|This novel's ending, much like a high-budget Hollywood movie, was blatantly predictable. And the last chapter felt rushed. Also, the author uses grammatical terminology that the average reader would not know.
B004ELSDZK|4.0|This is a really fun and addictive game. Not a lot of instructions - but you catch on. Music and the &#34;narrative' mini totem character gives the game a eerie vibe to it. There's 100 levels so it's definitely a challenging game. it's going to take a long time to finish!.

B00CDSVZHY|1.0|The movie is characterized by gratuitous violence, nudity and profanity.  It's disturbing that American viewers endorse such qualities in the pursuit of ever more graphic sensationalism.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I love love love ellen but this book was a bit disappointing. I read it in about 6 hours and I'm no speed reader. Was hoping for something smart , with more substance and to actually learn something about ellen. This book was like watching one of her brief monologues before her show which I like, but I would've preferred to watch that than pay for the book. Still a huge fan.
B007X70NVO|5.0|My almost 2 year old son is totally obssessed with this movie. My husband and I love motorcycles. My husband used to ride at the track and all. So we truly enjoy learning about the life of a motorcycle rider. I felt sad to find out that Simoncelli passed, but I am able to enjoy his smile in this movie.
B008602KQI|4.0|This was a really good movie.  very graphic though.  do not watch if you are sensitive and have a weak stomach.  But other then that is was really good.
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|We loved the movie, Lincoln.  It was interesting to learn a little more history about our great nation.  I am not sure that I had never heard some of the history or had just forgotten it over the years.

0307593312|5.0|I liked the story and I thought it was pretty original, it tends to drag sometimes but at the end is a very good read and you kind of miss it when you are done. Specially because I read the 3 parts one after the other....

I can't wait until they return.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I can hardly put it down! I have been staying up late reading it, and passing out before I want to! A must read can't wait to read the next one & see the movie!
B009NY43NY|1.0|Really disappointed with the way this series ended.  I read all the books in the past six months and I loved all of them until now.  Wasn't sure if it was just me until I saw that almost everyone felt the same way.  As I approached the last 50 pages I kept hoping something would happen but alas, nothing to salvage the story occurred.  The ending was truly DEAD EVER AFTER!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|I have to admit it took me about half the book to get into it, but the 2nd half made up for any real or perceived lag in the beginning. Sheryl Sandberg issues a strong and important challenge to women (and to men) not just to realize their human right to make choices, but to give themselves permission to aspire in workplace leadership; not to hide gender differences or be hindered by them, but to embrace them and blaze new trails. Women have traditionally been left behind in workplace leadership, but in today's world women are often behind because they have accepted outdated social norms, because they hesitate to apply for top positions, because they fear the demands will be harmful to their families. Or they have been overlooked because those doing the hiring are mostly men. With women in more of the top positions, other women would be able to get their start. Sandberg challenges both men and women to reexamine traditional gender roles in the workplace and in the home, consciously working to erase whatever gender expectations hold them back. This is a book worth reading, likely a life-changing book, especially for young college/career-minded women 18-40. Highly recommended as a graduation gift (or any other occasion) for any woman choosing a career path, planning to marry or begin a family, or already trying to balance family and career. A good book to discuss with young men too.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|So Dredd ended up being a lot cooler than I thought it was going to be. The usage of slo-mo and effects were simply captivating to watch. I found myself getting grossed out by the brutal killings in the movie and also got a real kick out of the semi-realistic yet still sci-fi world.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Karl Urban as Dredd and finally, for once. There was a strong female protagonist by the name of Anderson! She wasn't a damsel in distress, she got herself out of a nasty situation and knew when to slap a guy down who was getting too cocky. The team up between these two was really fun to watch and I would absolutely LOVE to see a sequel of this movie.<br /><br />Now, a lot of people compare this movie to The Raid and say that Raid is superior. Well, i saw both movies and I feel that people are comparing apples to oranges. Sure the basic premise is the same and there's not much story, but a lot of Dredd's focus was on Anderson coming out of the rookie role. The Raid wasn't about rookies, but about a cop trying to find his brother and a bunch of political back dealings that lead up to the assault.<br /><br />Either way I enjoyed both movies and hope the filmmakers will consider making another one.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|We have watched this movie at least 30 times with our grandchildren.  Each time the smallest will begin to ask questions and now all of us join in and explain what happened to the daddy (in simple terms of course), what greediness does to someone, and how important communication is.  It often gives the adults more to think about than the children.  We love this movie.  The music is fun and we all join in the songs.
B005LJITS0|2.0|This movie is... meh for lack of a better word. It really wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it certainly wasn't good, which is what I was expecting.<br /><br />As someone who does NOT follow the Green Lantern comics, I thought the movie was &#34;accessible&#34; but that's not necessarily a good thing. I just wasn't sold on Ryan Reynolds being the Green Lantern, nothing the hero did really 'qualified' him to be a ring bearer. In fact, probably the most interesting character was Sinestro and he's only in a few scenes. There were also a few plot inconsistencies which were very blatant.  For instance...<br /><br />Why does Hal Jordan fly back to the lantern homeworld, to ask them to fight for Earth, get rejected, and then say fine let me be the one to fight for Earth by myself. Instead of wasting time flying back he should have went to fight Parallax and be done with it.<br /><br />Also, the over use of CG was ridiculous, to the point that I got annoyed everytime Hal put on the green mask. It looked so damn fake, everything about it looked awful. The CG for the homeworld was pretty and some of the lantern stuff was cool, but holy crap, the suits looked terrible. This was an instance where the movie should have used more practical effects than CG effects.<br /><br />Overall, don't watch this movie, you will leave feeling unchanged and indifferent.
B000062V9C|5.0|I purchased this, not noticing that the seller had stated &#34;Region 2&#34;, so it would not play on my DVD player in Illinois in the USA.  The seller was GREAT about accepting it as a return.  I have seen the movie before so I knew I loved the movie.  This seller was extremely understanding and helpful and I would use them again without hesitation.
B005WQ4RP6|3.0|Cape Fear was definitely an interesting movie to watch, but it has not aged well over time at all. For starters, a lot of this movie uses zooms pans and other crazy camera tricks. For me, the effects were just too much and over done. It was almost as if every scene transition was going to have a dramatic zoom onto the actors face before cutting to another shot.<br /><br />Essentially the over use of camera effects made the film very campy despite having an interesting premise and a fascinating antagonist. I kind of wish they went into more detail about Cady's past and felt that Cady lost focus once it was time to break into the house. He went from a convict manipulating the law system against his enemy to a demented serial killer spouting the words of God. I understand he was crazy since the beginning, but I just didn't see at what point he decided, &#34;Okay, well that was fun. Now to kill everybody!&#34;<br /><br />The acting was great and the characters were interesting, but this is not a movie I would watch again.

B00BKUO3I4|5.0|Finally, Jon Anderson's last record with Yes is now on vinyl. A classic Yes album from start to finish, though many may disagree with me. You get 2 purple vinyl in a gatefold sleeve, and the same liner notes as the cd. The album is spread out across 3 sides, and the vinyl sounds awesome. I own the DVD-A & the 1st pressing CD, and I have to say, the vinyl exceeded all my expectations. Yes fans will love this import LP.

B004S3MB2U|5.0|If you need an all around calculator for multiple types of math and don't want to spend $100's buying different physical calculators to tote around. This $9.99 app for your Android device is the ticket!<br />It's easy to use and has decent instructions for using it.<br />I would recommend this calculator app to students or professionals who only want to carry around one device.<br />The only downside is it doesn't do physical graphs, but for me wasn't a deal breaker.<br />The DRM could be a problem if you don't have a wifi or 3/4G network connection. The app will not work. So far I haven't encountered this problem, but I've never been in the middle of nowhere trying to use this app...

B00000IGGA|5.0|I have been a tom Eaits fan for many years, and when I heard he had a very recent one (considering everything else of his is decades and decades old, this is a big thing!) so I origionally bought it when it first came out; this purchase is a replacement for the first one that has been lost in transitions.  I'm not knocking any of Tom's old stuff by the way, I love everything he's ever done!( I will be ordering all of his old stuff too, as time goes by, to replace them Also.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Was able to find the best channel in my area. Works as advertised, lots of interesting info and the price is right.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It was very exiting and I could not shut it down. I really liked the ending where the last two were going to eat the berries so there would be no winner. I  would recommend this to anyone.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I have enjoyed this whole series to the point that I have impatiently waited for the release of the next book so I could disappear once again! A well-written series that you can completely disappear into after a long, hard day! I highly recommend as a must read!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|We love this movie!  It is adorable - great for kids and subtle humor for teens and adults (all clean of course!).  Couldn't find it in stores anywhere and would have been willing to pay (it is my 18-year old's favorite movie).  Instead I found it on Amazon for under $10 including shipping, and we had it in two days!  Have already watched it several times...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I like this show very much and am excited for the next season to come out. It's an interesting look into not only the lives of the upper class at the time, but also the poor.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This game is really really fun. The graphics are really amazing, and the story line is great. The only problem i found is that you get to a point where it wont let you play any more unless you pay for the game. So that really sucks, but the game is worth paying for.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is pretty fun to play...after a whole bunch of people kept asking me to try i was like \\"what the heck\\" and gave it a shot. (^_^)
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Only a handful of books have made me gasp, shriek, and shout out loud. This is one of them. A captivating, intriguing, wonderful, incredibly well written novel/mystery. I highly recommend this to anyone who has read The Forgotten Garden or The Thirteenth Tale.
B004I8WD6E|1.0|I tried this case I just plain hate it! This thing is ridiculous to try and put on the phone! I thought I was gonna break the phone or mess the buttons up installing it. I definitely DO NOT recommend this case!!!
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|Like other movies in the LOTR family of stories, the movie doesn't follow the books closely, but the movies are good just the same.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I always loved angry birds, and when this came out I dwnloaded it instantly! I can't put this down, its a fun app and its also on facebook! :-)
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Enjoyed every episode of this series, The cast is great. The only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is Alicia's brother - not that he isn't a good actor. He is. I just don't see that he contributes anything to the show. They could cut his role from every episode and nothing would be missed, He adds nothing and I don't understand why he was added to the story line. It's as if they didn't have enough material and needed filler.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|The game is so much fun if you think it sucks balls and the world of a wimpy kid in your fave<br />Disneyworld the cheat sheet music vide the gun cheats for a wimpy kid in
B003L4Q3W6|5.0|I have watched all of this series on tv, but this and the other two that had Julian Richings in the role of Death, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse, I had to watch again.  This guy brings something special to the role and the show, which is one of the most enjoyable because of the writing, and the nuances and banter between the actors.  Worth it's weight in gold.  I will have to buy the various seasons to watch in the future.  A pleasant way to spend an hour despite the demons, vampires, brain eaters, etc.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Free, easy-to-use calculator with basic functions.  I especially like the large keys and use it to tally household and other  expenses.  I would recommend it to anyone who prefers larger numbers and just needs the basic functions.
B00C061I3K|1.0|I can't express the heartbreak I felt while listening to the Random Access Memories album. I guess the closest thing I can compare it to is the same shock and surprise and nagging let down I felt when Metallica changed directions and released the softer Load album circa 1996 after the spectacular and rich metal history in albums like the Black Album and Ride the Lightning. This Daft Punk release is similar - it is a drastic change in artistic direction - and much like Metallica, this new direction is a lot softer and watered down compared to the past. If you enjoyed Daft Punk's energetic songs like One More Time, or frenetic songs like Technologic, this album is not for you.<br />I'm not indicting Daft Punk for changing paths, evolving, or growing. That's their privilege. Maybe its more a reflection me, the listener. I just didn't want a new Daft Punk. I just wanted more of the old Daft Punk. I guess its a lot like buying a carton of what you expect is vanilla ice cream, but you open it and find strawberry. For some people that's fine because they like strawberry. I don't. I don't like Get Lucky. And that's the best song on this album.
B00AWQEKIK|5.0|I am going through this set slowly and enjoying every song in quality time.  If you are a Stills fan, you will absolutely love the CD sized book that is included.  I heard a Graham Nash interview, in which he talked about how much he wanted to please Stephen with this box set, so I knew it was done with love and respect.
B007XGJK4G|4.0|Some good stuff about bob I had not known and it interviewed some interesting characters.  Some good early wailers performances.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Pacing is very good for this genre of game. The JP franchise tie-ins are fun and reasonably on-character. Fun and addictive app, especially for Jurassic Park fans.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is not only one for the kids but you as an adult . I believe any person in the hole entire world wouldn't be hurt to try it for free . It just gets better and better. It's a win win folks a win win!
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My problem with this app is it continues to freeze/crash on the Kindle Fire. Love playing but hats having to sr<br />start over losing all my coins &amp; stats. Fix this it's very annoyingly!
B004K00NMG|1.0|they are selling it for 4 dollars for a reason. the movie is awful. i give it one star for a pretty good soundtrack (as if amazon allows us to rate any lower)
B000TERDJS|5.0|I bought this CD on recommendation from my dad. I find the music perfect for ignoring. Don't get me wrong, it is beautiful, but Brian Eno designed this to be background music and for that purpose it really shines. I can listen to it while reading to drown out the background noise.
B007UQRW62|3.0|This review is not necessarily about the Blu-ray version of Singin' in the Rain as much as how Warner Home Video is treating these old MGM classic musicals. (Louis B. Mayer has to be rolling in his grave at the thought of the Warner Bros. label on the packaging of old MGM films on the Archives label. But then, MGM labels UA films as their own, too.) As the owner of the 2-disc set of Singin' in the Rain that was released some ten years ago, I was looking forward to the Blu-ray edition. Thus I bought the 60th Aniversary Collector's Edition for all of the extras on the DVD. The umbrella and the large box are cumbersome, the booklet is not really informative, and the large box does not easily fit in a video collection or with  books. How I wish that Warner Home Video would release these special editions as neatly and succcinctly as they did with Meet Me In St. Louis and Whatever Happened to Baby Jane; the small book format with the discs inserted does not take up too much room in a libray but is still showy enough for other buyers to feel that they are getting extras. In an age when young people are ditching the whole big packaging thing for more room, why not join them in distributing these classic moves with style and a more convenient size? And...although it does not belong here...please do not treat another classic as you did with Easter Parade! If ever a film deserved the small book showcase this film is one. Meanwhile, just for the record, Singin' in the Rain looks and sounds great! And I love the video extras (although I question some of Debbie Reynold's narration in the documentary film; years ago she wrote what an awful experience it was to work with Kelly; now she practiaclly worships the tap shoes he danced on. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate that Debbie appreciates being in such a classic and  can revise her feelings for Kelly. But let's not sugar coat an experience just to sell these silly large Blu-ray sets.)
B004FOA84A|4.0|Stopped to soon, would ahve liked a much much longer game!  I enjoyed playing it though!  How about Grisly Manor II?
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MOVIE.  It is easy to see why it won an Academy Award for Best Picture.  Alan Arkin is hilarious!!!!!!!!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|Loved the book. Interesting and likable characters. Ending really brought the story together. Made me smile at the end! Loved it.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I highly recommend this album.  It is easy to see why Michael has become the crooner he is.  I am and will always be a fan of his!.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game gets addictive. Good graphics......looks like the movie. Objectives are not too difficult. I enjoy it very much. easy to play.
B001U0HBPG|5.0|I throroughly enjoyed this movie.  This movie shows the versatility of Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett and I recommend it!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Wanted to read about mental illness and book was suggested to me. The style of writing with all the cursing is really the reason for the three stars otherwise otherwise a good read
B000001AJO|5.0|What can one say about this musical genius?  His artistry has and always will continue to inspire generations to come!
B0091QSNEE|5.0|Ahh, the very snazzy restaurant w/its ability to teach small folks how to cook a variety of dishes. (Our toddler/preschooler has been introduced to mincing, using a blender, mixing ingredients in a big pot.) It's great.  Adorable art and music, as with all the Dr.P games. Small file size for the amount of content. I strongly recommend any of the Dr.Panda games for younger folks. Very engaging with an educational, intuitive aspect.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read about this book on a discussion here on Amazon and immediately checked it out and I am sooooo happy I picked it up... this is a modern day love story about 2 really smart people with one of those \\"palpable\\" attractions you just can't miss. But what makes it really interesting is that it's told from the male POV - it feels like, throughout the book, he is narrating the story to his best friend, but then he gives women really interesting insights into the male psyche! I devoured the book in a couple of hours - it is funny, sexy and really smartly written. I'll sure be on the lookout for more from the author. Definitely worth your time!
B00BP29SAA|5.0|The Dr.Panda game series is absolutely delightful for young children. (Toddlers/preschoolers) although I've seen older children take a turn at it, because the premise of each game is engaging and fascinating.<br /><br />One of the things that amaze me about these games, and began to note about it lacking in others, is the fantastic optimization. The space these games tend to take up are a few hundred kilobytes - whereas many games do not seem as well-optimized. The amount of art, music, and cute vox sound effects in these games compared to others puts some apps to shame! :)<br /><br />Dr.P's Supermarket took a little bit more time for the small person to understand, mini-game wise, mostly in where the location of them are. Some things have sparkly-glows, and some objects rattle about to attract attention(the shopping cart game). Some of these things seemed to take a bit for her to discover.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|My 7 year old son loves it.  He loves the graphics and action.  Can hardly put it down.  I sometimes have to threaten to put the parent time limits on the kindle...
B008DM4OTA|5.0|Dr.Panda games are fantastic entertainment for toddlers/preschoolers and also a teaching tool for various aspects of life. Largely intuitive, a helicopter brings the patients that are allowed into the hospital by tapping on the elevator doors. This game has a lot of cute, fun surprises if the child taps about the rooms. (Beds change to suit their patients: girls, boys, babies; the fan can be switched on by tapping on it, the windows can open to allow the patients some fresh air; flowers in patients rooms can be watered; and there's a puzzle-like case of doctor tools to pack.) This game teaches kids what bein' a doctor is all about! They get to take temperatures, put salve on rashes, add ice packs to bumpies - to have a happy, healthy patient!<br /><br />This really helped take the edge off \\"going to the doctor\\" in our house. Normalized a lot of aspects, giving the child an understanding that the doctor is really here to help.
B009NPA3MS|4.0|I didn't know Phillip Phillips was a reality star I just heard his music online and I loved it. .
B00AMSLRAC|5.0|Just when it couldn't get any cuter (Dr.Panda games), we discovered the adorable garden app. Teaches small folks how to help customers that come to the little farm-shop! Beginning by mowing the lawn or weeding a chunk of ground, planting seeds, watering the plants either with cute, teeny storm clouds you tap or water w/a hose, making sure bugs don't bother the plants. When you get your fabulous crops, you can give them to your waiting customer.<br /><br />We have all the Dr.Panda games. This one is just as adorable and fun for toddlers/preschoolers as all the others. Fantastic optimization (few hundred kilobytes instead of 35 megs or so.) Oh yes.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Excellent package for the price! If you love star wars you should get this set! Go for it right now!
B003P9VZ0W|5.0|My daughter loves these stickers. They are big enough for her room and easy to remove for a 3 yr old.
B008Q0CO0U|5.0|Action packed, great story and you get very involved with the characters. It keeps you guessing throughout the film and young and old alike enjoyed it!
034580404X|5.0|I chose this rating because it has been a long time since I read something that held my attention even though it is fictional.  Christian is my type of man except for what I consider to be the dark side of love making.  He is a caregiver, considerate, handsome, intelligent, has plenty of swag, ambition, is educated and rich.  Ana is a perfect match for Christian.  She discovered what his needs are set out to satisfy them yet did not sacrifice who she is or allow him to bully her.  Christian needed a mate that is strong who gave him tough love when needed.  Ana made Christian think about his actions toward women and that is how he found true love for himself as well as Ana.
B00BMTX5XM|5.0|I highly suggest this album if you are a fan of Ben Howard's music. I heard them for the first time on youtube with the single &#34;Still&#34; and their song &#34;Daughter - &#34;Perth&#34; (Bon Iver) v &#34;Ready For The Floor&#34; (Hot Chip)&#34;. Great stuff.
B004QL7K8E|2.0|Man did I feel old watching this train wreck of a film. A completely senseless barrage of quick cuts, boobs and stupidly. We've all been there before. Parents are out of town, time to call the crew and PARTY!! Right? I'm no exception to that one, but there is something seriously wrong with our society and the younger generation today. Completely amoral, without any self worth or character. The only thing these morons respect is money no matter how it is acquired. What's scarier is one of these A Holes will be running this country some day...hopefully I'll be long gone by then!<br /><br />I know, I know its only a movie, but it's a far too real reflection of our society for it to be funny to me, it's just sad and depressing. I give it two stars because I watched it all the way through and it was good enough for me to actually write about it.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great movie! Lots of blood and guts. Super funny. I am not one to watch a movie twice, but I would definitely see this again.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I absolutely love this series! Can't believe it has come to an end!! I'm going to miss Sookie and the gang. Also I really liked how Charline ended the book.
B00BHXUC8E|2.0|This has to  be on of Whitesnakes worst DVD and CDS I have ever bought or for that matter have ever liked.The production and mastering of the DVD and CDS is not even close to what I have grown to love about Whitesnakes music over the years.I have been following David sence Deep Purple days.Im 57 years old and play music myself.I would call myself on of the greatest Whitesnake fans out there,I have every thing they have done no Imports.Something is wrong here.I am not saying it's David,Doug or Reb.Wheres Tommy and  Marco.The First thing I notice was to much bass.Over powered Doug and Reb.Davids vocals were much different than the forevermore CD.Even Davids vocal lets say were a little under the weather.I have Great RESPECT for David,always will have.If I did not I would not have spent $$$$$$$$$$$$ on his work.Lets just say I was BUMMED.I will not return it I have to much respect for thier efforts.It will fine a home in my collection just like all of his work.To David Coverdale and Doug and Reb and rest of band members,GREAT EEFORTS on this prodject.My love for Whitesnake will never die.With Respect John Smith.RE.2011 Whitesnake Made In Japan Deluxe Edition.2CD/DVD.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|I think that this game is very educational and should have everyone play this because it is that awesome and fun.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I saw Iron Man 3 in theaters about 2 or 3 weeks ago and i loved it! It kept me in my seat almost the whole time except to get a refill of pop. Anyway, loved the movie and with the way it ended seems that they might havc a 4th one out in the future.. well at least i hope! Also i don't understand why it doesn't have a five star rating by now!!
0399165274|5.0|The Preacher is a frightening terrorist, someone with a command of English and the ability to influence others. His purpose is make radicals out of his followers, radicals willing to assassinate powerful Western leaders. The Preacher, though, has picked on the wrong man. For now he is hunted by the best hunter in TOSA, Technical Operations Support Activity. This agency's sole task is is to eliminate America's worst enemies who have been put on The Hit List.<br /><br />Once again, Frederick Forsyth combines intense research with inside information and a cunning plot. The writing is top-notch. There may be one or two coincidences in the book, but this one is his best book in years. If you like thrillers, read this one.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|This is a solid zombie movie.  Good effects, decent storyline with a twist and just decent acting.  My son and I liked this movie.  We have watched many zombie movies together and this one was just a solid effort.  Definitely worth the watch.  I wont go into to what its about because of the other 100 reviews.  Just say that if you like zombies or just a decent story, this one might fit the bill.
B006M4F67A|3.0|It stalls to much. If it wouldn't stall it would be a great game.  The way it is now, is very frustrating.  I love to play it, but sometimes I don't play it because of the stalls.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Curiosity lead me to read the story of Tesla. I had no idea he had invented so many things well ahead of his time. It also pointed out the greed and selfishness of so many turn of the century business men. I was entertained and informed. It was a great read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This was a hard book to put down!  It is a Great Saga, that keeps you wondering what could possibly happen next.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I've tried roughly half a dozen earbuds and headphones over the years in search of a set that works well for jogging and running. The toughest thing for me has been finding a pair that stays in my ears.<br /><br />This is the first pair I have found that actually stays in place over a long run without requiring re-adjustment. While the sound and build quality may not be as good as some higher-end models that cost several times the price, so far this seems to be an excellent value -- exactly what I was looking for.<br /><br />PROS<br />-Great price<br />-Lightweight<br />-Build quality seems average to good<br />-Stays in place over long runs<br /><br />CONS<br />-Sound quality decent -- bass a bit lacking
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|The kids enjoy all of the challenges they must meet in this fun game, and that it has lots of levels.
B000AP04L0|5.0|This is a classic movie about life in a cubicle and the desire to break out of it. I've been meaning to buy it for a while. My wife had never seen it so I finally broke down and got it. It arrived in perfect condition and works great. No complaints at all other than I always laugh until my sides hurt when I watch it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good book - but fairly predictable to the genre of book.  Overall I liked it and found it to be entertaining.
B00821OX98|5.0|Reading reviews of this show, it seems like it gets a lot of crap it doesn't deserve. The characters are deep and the show doesn't skimp on the action - it's rare to see a work that provides such excitement alongside powerful characters with a strong meaningful undertone like this show does. I have yet to hear a negative opinion that I could at least agree to disagree with. Constantly fresh and innovative. Just barely into season 2 and I'm already counting the days till season 3, and really hoping for a season 4. I've seen it compared to (new) Battlestar Galactica and Stargate Universe - but I think that's not accurate. While all three shows share a deep character-driven plot, BG (which I loved even though Glen Larson, the creator of BG wasn't even involved) tended to be a little self-absorbed in that it's subtext seemed to be intended as some kind of life-lesson, and SGU often sacrificed the action that its setting made possible in favor of more character drama. I'd give both those shows 4 stars out of 5, but FS balances all of it's aspects and presents multiple sides to its subtext and lets the audience interpret as they will. It also has the advantage of a more relatable setting, which dilutes the intellectualism less than the \\"lost in space\\" setting of BG and SGU. Further, while BG and SGU almost shoved their religious content down viewers' throats, the religious element in FS is totally manageable but not underplayed: it's written in as an aspect of some of the characters and not a key part of the universe. It's not central to the story but it's still enough to talk about. Best yet, it doesn't give all the answers to its mysteries right away but also doesn't make you wait for a thousand episodes to solve a mystery (another difference between it and BG/SGU).<br /><br />5 stars. Utterly fantastic.
B004ISVH7U|5.0|I enjoyed the film a lot. i have watched it many times with friends. It represents the time as few other documentaries have for me.
030726999X|5.0|If you haven't read all three of the Larsson books, you've missed out on an interesting adventure.  He died too soon.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Recommended by a friend. Bought on Amazon. Love the series. I can't wait for the last book to come out.
B009NY43NY|5.0|I THINK IT WAS A GREAT ENDING TO SERIES WOULD  OF LOVED THAT THE TV SERIES WOULD OF FOLLOWED BOOK MORE
159562015X|5.0|The book was very easy to read. It assist in the development of identifying individual strengths and building on it. Great tool for leadership development.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I loved this book! It was so fun with an engaging and tense story of a believable &#34;issue&#34; in the near(ish) future! After a steady first few days I reached about half way and then literally couldn't put it down until I'd finished it! Try to hunt it down, kindle loan or try the audiobook! Otherwise sit tight and enjoy it when it comes back next year!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|it was in one sense, exactly what you hope for and expect from Tina Fey: funny and biting, but not unkind.  At the same time, I was surprised by her insights about the differences in how differently men and women are treated in various circumstances.  Not that I didn't expect Tina to be intelligent and thoughtful about this, but it was a nice surprise to have more depth than I was expecting in the book.  It was also really interesting to read about Tina's and Amy Poehler's friendship, and the relationship she has with Lorne Michaels.  I definitely recommend it.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like it - I knew nothing about mah jong and I'm getting hooked! I have zero patience for games but like this one and think its good for my brain:) the sound effects are cute too...
0792839749|4.0|I purchased this for my family (one of my husband's favorites from his childhood) and I look forward to sharing it with my students at school.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I love this item! It makes keeping up with it much easier! My son likes something to hold on to also!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Not as good as his other books.  Too many story lines.  I wished the book would just stay with the brother and sister. I found myself wanting to know more about Pari and her brother. I did enjoy the story of the uncle. This book reads more as a bunch of short stories rather then a novel. It is worth the read. I did enjoy reading it. It just didn't live up to my expectations.
B000JQUHLM|4.0|Pollyanna is one of my favorite literary characters. This book keeps the memory alive. It was an entertaining  read and the price was right
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|So I JUST GOT The Great White And Its At like Level 5 And I Love It But I'm Gonna Need Like 75k Coins For The Megalodon And The Baby's Are Kind Of Expensive But I LOVE THE GAME And I Cant Find An Enemy Great White To Save My Life!!!!There More Rare Than The Kempty Bass!So Can You Lower The Baby's And Make Great Whites More Easy To Find Like Make Extra Space And Make It Like Al The Way At The Right And Whatever.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I love love these books. I'm jumping right into the 4th book. This book ends with just enough information to make you want to dive right into the next.
B008Y79IUE|3.0|the movie it's kind of slow and it's really trippy. i loved t except maybe for the end.<br />it's sad  but i could see a lot crude reality in it.
B004UID2LC|4.0|Nice to have just so I don't have to look up youtube on the internet every time I go to look for a video. You can also download the videos to your android device if wanted then you'll have them permanently.
B003730LRY|5.0|i LOVE this move and all the adamas movies. they are super funny and<br />remind me of my childhood a lot
B007PTJOV0|4.0|If you like mario brothers this is a lot like it only with a leprechaun. I thought it was worth it =D
B00CDFWJIG|1.0|the title does not reflect the movie. Story not put together properly. Downright ridiculous. I need a refund if possible.
B002V6RB1C|5.0|A movie that doesn't lose its flavor after all the years since it was made. A lot of familiar faces appear, Unfortunately many are now gone.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is good for when your bored and want to have some fun like on long car rides or when at work.
B009R659L8|5.0|It went by too fast!  As usual Mary Higgins Clark delivers a great mystery with wonderful characters & storyline.  The suspense builds all the way through to the good ending.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is an awesome calculator!! Brirf and easy to use with clear button.  I really love it! The best calculator I have ever used.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|The game is faster here than in my pc. It's fun and can be connected to your facebook account and play against friends and all.
B008YU0AOE|3.0|It's great for simple multiplication and simple division but you can't use the blue buttons remember this is coming from a 11 year old fourth grader with great spelling and reading abilities but seriously this is great for simple math problems just try not to rush to typing math problems because it shows you a ad for the full version every time you go into the ap
B003UESJ9M|5.0|My mother and I love this movie...we watch it over and over and never get tired of it. My favorite song in the movie is coming home.I cry everytime.
1878424505|5.0|This book was easy to comprehend--Information was divided into four segment that made it easy to understand each one of the concepts.  I will be able to benefit from information in each one of the 4 Agreements.
B002ZG976U|5.0|I have always been a huge Cher fan and this movie is no different. I bought it for my mom and go over to watch it with her all the time..
B001NVIZ3E|5.0|I used to watch this as a kid and I showed it to my kids last week and they loved it.  Plenty of sword fighting and jumping out of trees to amuse my six and four year old.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|We bought it not knowing really what it was about and it was fantastic!!  Tottally suprised and again we have to watch it per our 4 year old at least once a day
B009NY43NY|3.0|I have read every single book of the Sookie Stackhouse series and this final book wasn't as exciting as many of them but it brought a neat and tidy closure to Sookie and all her Louisiana buddies. Now, I feel I can leave the characters and move on. Since the HBO show has not followed the books at all, I will be stunned if the the True Blood series ends the same way.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Great move, really held your interest. Great acting this is a must see one. Nice to see a move with pout a lot of sex.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and looks great on blu ray....if you are a fan of action movies this needs to be in your collection
B00BETX5PS|3.0|I think I have seen all the 007 moves. This one had good action but it just did not keep my intrest. The the actors seem like to me that the pushed the old thing to much.
B005LLX582|3.0|I may have to watch the movie again. I'm not sure I understood it completely, although the acting is good.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This book definitely was interesting. However, it did not seem to match experiences of people who had actually died and then were brought back to life. It was perplexing to me the experience that the author had. But then again, having never experienced anything like this, who am I to say that it didn't really happen. I am glad, however, that this NDE brought him into a relationship with God.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I like it. I play it everyday. Big perk is that it's free. It entertains you for a while while you play it.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Worth all the money you pay for the game is great buy it playing online and campaign pleasssssssssse get it
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Big fan of the show and of the Tenth Doctor so when I saw this I thought that is cool. It is very detailed and makes the right sound and lights up but it is kinda cheap feeling. The pen attachments don't work well, easily fall off if bumped but that doesn't bother me much. For the quality it is a little expensive.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|This has been more challenging than the previous Angry Bird games I have downloaded.  A little frustrating at times, but I still have fun with the game.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Another very good Mitch Rapp story. The story flows well and contains good detail. Rapp makes a great hero, he's real enough but also enough of a superman to keep the story going. i recommend all the Mitch Rapp stories.
B00821OX98|4.0|The story starts strong and the pace is fairly even, introducing new elements throughout season 1. The writers do gloss over a lot of the shifts people have made to survive in the new world. The characters mention how things used to be from time to time and are well aware things have changed, but they all seem far too comfortable.
B004132HZS|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She loves this series! I even enjoy it. Anything Benidict Cumberbatch does is great!
B00CRW2066|4.0|There are only three songs that I could do without, but overall it's the same National you know and love.The tunes are tight and the lyrics are just so, also.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It was alright.<br />Not a very long game, but the graphics were alright. Was worth the price. I guess I could recommend it.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Cheryl does a great job with her story, makes me want to hike the PCT. My Mom recommended this book to me, she wouldn't leave me alone until I read it, glad I did.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|An extraordinary piece of literature. I couldn't put it down to save my life! Vivid detail and historical recollection put you in the streets of Paris. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. Everyone should read this book at least once in their lifetime to appreciate human life.
B00C81AVNU|4.0|I'm buying this CD just for the song \\"Soul of a Man\\" which almost got a standing ovation in the performance I saw.  The audience clapped long enough to stall the show just a bit.  If only it had a bonus video on it of Stark Sands performing it, stomping his foot.  It gave me chills.  Wish I had a whole cd of songs as soulful as that one.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I chose this rating because this book is amazing there are so many unexpected turns in this book its unpredictable. This book left me wanting more and I think that's what a great author should do. I wold recommend this to people who like mythology and suspense. I definitely enjoyed this book.
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|A bit repetitive but very fun none the less. AWSOM E GRAPHICALLY just wish. It was easier to get the armies or release.  Paid version with more maps and levels
B007ZYJT1U|2.0|good storyline but wat roo much cussing etc did not enhance the show at all.  characters were very well played
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|one actress, multiple characters portrayed well....and the plot thickens, complexity deepens almost have to keep a chart!  Love this series...love BBC
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I really like my sharpener. It is easy to use and fits in my pocket when I want to take it with me. I also like how I can sharpen serrated edges with it.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Wow, was this a great book. I read it in two day because I couldn't put it down. The characters were so believable.
B000PEX1IE|5.0|I love watching this movie. Just watched it with my kids and they loved it. They need more movies like this.
B000FA5TTW|5.0|I love this story. I like that I turned the movie off and determined to know the characters. At 22 I lost my wife in a car wreck. I've tried to be a normal husband and father, but keep a secret place where she is welcome to be with us. You captured that place.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I am so glad I read The Misremembered Man.  Made me laugh and made me cry. Made me angry and made me happy. Not many books touch every emotion but this one did. It may sound simple but Christina McKenna writes beautifully; flawlessly. I even had to read some to my husband such as the befitting wintery, gloomy day of Lydia's mother's funeral because both she and God were sad. Then when Lydia sat  in the room observing her dead mother's unfinished knitting, her half read book, and the circled TV channel she would have watched-so touching. And then to learn at the end of the book that the life little Jamie lived in the orphanage was based on real practices- appalling. I will buy other books from this talented writer.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I really like this cd, i bought this cd here before it was available in the store near me so all my friends wanted to ride with me wanting to trade different cds for mine.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Unquestionable, this is one of the best books that I have ever read.  The author describes how we can all enrich our lives with his instructions on how to increase our spiritual strength to endure and benefit from the trials of life.<br /><br />Mark  Hoover
0307744434|2.0|This story had a lot of potential. It sound like a great page turner. It starts good and begins to slow down. I had a difficult time finishing the book. I was very disappointed with the ending. I don't recommend it.
0061922315|4.0|I enjoyed this book, because it points out the pitfalls of marrying just for love. When children are involved,, cultural differences do make a difference.. This couple was able tp overvome the differences in the end. That doesn't always happen.
B00CDXOXB4|5.0|Suspense and romance all in one! You won't see the twist until the very end. I will definitely be watching this again.
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|Ok, the movie is great, no question.  I saw it on Pay per view, and enjoyed it thoroughly.  So thoroughly that I ordered a copy.  Got the two Disc Special Edition (DVD plus ultra violet digital copy).  Thought they would come on separate disks  Apparently not.  This is my SECOND copy (Amazon's great return policy!).  Neither copy loads on my standard dVD player, or it it does load (eventually), it still won't play.  This is very annoying to only get through the DVD splash screen and into the main menu.  I'm chalking it up to the cost of learning....I can't afford to buy a new DVD player right now.  This one is a Sony, the one in the living room is a Panasonic, and it works on neither of them.  So I'll return it.  With luck, they will issue the extended version without hooking the Ultra Violet Digit copy on it.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Even though Oprah endorsed this book, I still liked it a lot! It's a great &#34;self discovery&#34; story and rebirth.....
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Reacher is my hero.  Wish he were real and I could meet him.  All the books are good.  This one not the best one so it got a four but if this were the first one I had read it would be a 5.
B00CDFWJIG|3.0|I thought the story line was interesting; I have not read the books.  I enjoyed most of the characters, but I did not like the actor that played Ethan. I thought he was rather effeminate and almost goofy; I don't know if he was like this in the book. Hence, I did not feel the chemistry between the two characters at all.  I enjoyed the special effects and the \\"adult\\" characters.  I guess what bothers me the most about movies like this is the complete lack of reaction/fear to the supernatural.  The character of Ethan seems too accepting of the supernatural at first. I am still debating whether or not I want to read the series.
B00BIVN82M|4.0|It's always good to hear Michael.I would like to hear same new songs writen by him, if possible,<br />maybe the next cd will have all new songs
B000HL0EEE|4.0|Several of these episodes are really good, while others are at least interesting. Like many of my friends, I was excited that there was a new Star Trek series on when Enterprise first aired, and I liked the concept. In comparison to later seasons, the characters and dynamics are still being sorted out, and there's lots of world-building going on. If you've seen it, but it's been a while, or you just want to see a few episodes, my favorites are The Andorian Incident, Shadows of P'Jem (we see the Andorians--the blue aliens with two antennae from the original series), Fusion (which again refers back to some of the hippie themes from the original series), and Fallen Hero. Acquisition earns an honorable mention, since it's the first time humans meet Ferengi, as does Broken Bow, the pilot episode, which starts off with a rescue mission of sorts, returning a wounded Klingon home.<br />I was not a fan of the time war involving the Suliban and other races, a story arc that is first introduced partway through the season. For me, it was a few good ideas that didn't gel, and it was far too dark with the US looking to go to war when these stories were broadcast. Some of my friends (all Star Trek fans) just didn't care for the series in general, while the rest didn't care for the whole time war storyline. The show's characters and other stories take off in the second season, and I really think that it would have gone several more seasons, if not for the unfortunate time war story arc(s).
B000088E6D|3.0|keep up good work of not letting the old songs die, they are always nice to hear them I always like to hear them
B0081BU42O|5.0|I've been a fan of Iain M Banks for years. My favorite Culture novel is Use of Weapons, a dark character exploration, but all of the novels are interesting. His latest will unfortunately be his next to last. I recently read that the author has been diagnosed with cancer, and he intends to withdraw from public appearances, marry his long-time companion, and spend his remaining time with friends and family. He does not plan to seek radical treatment. His publisher has responded by moving up the publication date of his final novel, in the hopes that Mr. Banks will live to see its release.<br /><br />With that in mind, the novel is almost secondary, as I read it. It's bittersweet, knowing that this will be one of the last new works of his that I'll read. The characters are interesting. The Ship Minds are off doing tricky things with and to alien races, all against the backdrop of a companion race attempting to Sublime, or move on to a 'higher plane'. Turns out the Gzilt, the alien race who is moving on, has had an interesting, almost predetermined, history, but it seems that there are riddles and bombshells galore, as it is suggested that an elder, patron race who helped the Gzilt may or may not have helped them at all. Since the Gzilt were involved in the early formation of the Culture, and almost became one of the major races to join the Culture at its inception, the Culture naturally has a strong interest in seeing their long-term allies off. And then the hidden Gzilt political factions go to war...<br /><br />Read the Kindle preview, if you aren't sure about it, but Banks effortlessly creates and tosses away more interesting civilizations in a chapter than many lesser authors create in an entire novel. This is Banks at or very near the top of his game, and if you liked his other Culture novels, you will certainly enjoy this one, too.
B009NY43NY|1.0|As a Sookie fan who has read the series and enjoyed it, I was very disappointed with the last book for the series.  Felt like the author was just teying to wrap things up and didn't stay true to the characters.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|I don't have time for reviews, surely surely surely you can figure its popularity by the people that purchase it.
B000KB8DB2|5.0|I am very glad I finally have these DVD's and the book.  I have wanted them for years.  These DVD's are very good, because Lanzman interviewed people, who were there when the things happened so many years ago.  It is also great to see the places those things happened in too.
B007N0REX6|2.0|I just get right into the guitar work that Slash gives us in this work.  I keep buying his disks and keep getting disappointed and have finally figured out why, Slash needs a lead singer.  Disappointed again.
B00BDAP66E|1.0|Still trying to figure this app out. Don't bother wasting your time with this loser. There are better apps out there.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|Michael Buble's voice blows me away every time I listen to him.  He is a consummate performer!  His concerts are superb.  I highly recommend this CD.  I hope he will soon give us a Spanish Language CD.  His accent is excelent.
B002Y5FKUE|5.0|Diego-Florez and Dessay are two of the most wonderful singers to listen to and watch. They have the most beautiful bel canto voices as well as brilliant acting skills and they are very good together. I also enjoyed seeing Jennifer Black in a supporting role. She is also very talented and did a good job singing and portraying her character.<br />At first I wasn't sure about the rehearsal hall set but I soon realized it added another layer of depth to a simple far fetched story.<br />With the very talented cast as well as the gorgeous music of Bellini, one can not miss with this lovely opera.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|it is a lovely game with brilliant graphics, it is reminds you of good old games of this genre. the best part is that its a no nonsense game with a very simple gameplay and ideal for those quick sessions when you only have a few minutes. i will highly recommed this game.
0345525558|5.0|This is one of those books that you just have to keep reading and can't put down.  Loved it and have already passed it on to my sister who also loves it !  The &#34;language&#34; is something I didn't know and just loved all the meanings.  Would recommend to all....real good summer reading.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|this reads like a world war 2 history where snippets are taken from the soldiers. I read this so quickly I need to read it again. I don't know how they will make the movie, but I'm spending some money on it.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|Timeless...the stories and the humor are top notch, while teaching how different folks can get along.  This is the definitive series for Sci-fi buffs.
B00CL50LEC|5.0|I think this was a very life changing and just an over all good movie.  Very Well put together and it really does change you after you get done watching it.  I really did have a nice warm loving feeling afterwards.  I really hope that there will be a 2 but if not definitely  one that you would want to watch a few times.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Although I felt the start of the book dragged a bit, I still couldn't put it down as I wanted to know the outcome of the quell. Looking forward to the last book.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Highly recommended! I really enjoy playing this game...It keeps you coming back for more...Do yourself a favor and check it out. You won't be disappointed...
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|This movie started out sort of slow for my taste but the story built from there. It is always a let down at the end so that you have to see the next one but overall it was entertaining.
B009LMTDL0|2.0|While Sheryl had some interesting thoughts, I did not care for the way this book was written.  Referencing random articles as authoritative evidence of sexism was thin and off-putting.  But her advice on negotiating was the worst.  Smile at all times?  Start off with \\"since women are normally paid less . . .\\"???  Absolutely not.  I respect her professional success, but disagree with much of her advice.  The only real nugget I took away, and the reason for two stars, is to apply for challenging positions/assignments.  I don't ever want anyone - male or female - to sell themselves short when they are capable of much more.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|i love a good romance novel just as much as the next girl but i do not think this book represents a healthy relationship. the writing is so so and i have not attempted to read the newest edited verison of it mainly because i just cannot support the disfunction. neither one of the main charactors really make you like them. sure the guy is good looking and she is good looking but it seems like maybe that is all they have going for them and there is not much substance behind the veneer. i hope that young women do not take this as an example of how to be in a relationship because it seems, to me at least, that at any moment it could turn into physical abuse, it already qualifies as verbal and emotional abuse.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|Great ap to have on the Kindle.  Love the large print and soooo many functions!<br />I don't need to keep my old pocket calculator on the table next to my favorite chair anymore.
B004UID2LC|1.0|It limited him to certain featured videos and did not let him search for the ones he wanted. The browser on his Kindle Fire HD was acting up, so he thought this would be a nice add like the youtube button on his ipod touch.
B00846WWVM|1.0|It is for the very young user.  There is no challenge for an adult.  It has been deleted from my device.
B00BNWWUDY|3.0|The story seemed rather farfetched and really not believable.  Obvious it was about a certain anti-anxiety drug now on the market.
B0089LOG02|5.0|Orphan Train is a very good book.<br /> I liked the subject of the story. The people in the story were believable. I also liked the time line.
B00AIBZM40|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this scary movie  but the ending was sad.  The move engaged our imagination and attention from beginning to end.
B0010SKSTO|4.0|A lot of this I already recognized prior to reading the book;however, I really enjoyed the &#34;whys&#34; behind the actions.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|The movie special effects were great as well as the acting.  The story was very special for discontented family members.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|My wife and I saw this in the theater with trepidation that it wouldn't measure up to the &#34;buzz&#34; it was getting.  But when the credits finally finished and the lights came up - we pulled our jaws off the floor and staggered out with tears of joy running down our cheeks.  Aside from the trickery of having a dozen lead actors each play five or more parts - this film strikes deep into the reason for our existence; how everyone truly is connected across time and reality.  A science fiction action movie with a soul, who knew?  10/10
B00A81NFAS|4.0|The movie was very well acted.  I guess the subject of the movie mental illness makes me uncomfortable and doesn't always have a happy ending.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|This book is soooo cumbersome...and I gifted the 1st 3 to people.<br />Star Wars was great...The Empire Strikes Back was awesome and then it just got stupid....<br />Kinda how I feel about this series....
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A kaleidoscope of writing that plays on Shakespearean motifs in a Pynchonesque world. Here a nation is created out of thin air, taken out of the shadows of a Hermit Kingdom, into into a real world of true love and sacrifice.  The writing is pitch perfect and perfect in tone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is amazing my daughter loves it I'm just having trouble sharing this one lol...but I recommend this to everyone..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This fast paced game allows players to buy and select characters to interact with subway stations in different countries. The game is just flat out awesome.
B008602KQI|4.0|I thought this movie was entertaining, not too teenie bopper romantic ala Twilight and quite disturbing when you consider the content and how our nation currently stands. The gov control of the people after the war in the Hunger Games is eerily similar to our current administration. In fact I wouldn't be surprised if the review gets flagged just for mentioning the similarities. Anyway an entertaining movie, not too scary for 10 or older and a little romance. Happy Hunger Games. May the odds be forever in your favor.
B001NLL93W|5.0|The first book was decent. It did make me want to at least read the next book so I could find out what happens to Clary and Jace. The second book got me reeled in... it didn't just make me want to read the next book, it made me want to read the whole series. But this book, City of Glass, the 3rd book, has made a fan out of me. There were parts when I was mad, sad, cheering for them to kick butt, and hoping for Valentine's demise. Great read, can't wait for the 4th.
B000EBD9TY|5.0|This is a movie to own and keep and watch at least once a year.  Acting is superb throughout.  It made Brando a Star and no wonder.  A mind-bogglingly Superb Vivien Leigh paired with an out-of-this-world young Marlon Brando.  Stunning piece of work from director Elia Kazan.
B00992CF6W|5.0|The game can't be beaten no way no how, it's impossible to make a game more popular than this game plus if u give feed back it vibrates when killing a block.
B00BC0JGCA|5.0|Good album!!!! I don't need to say anymore, but I need 20+ words..... You are now thinking about a purple elephant eating apples.
B0076L9W9Q|5.0|Wow.  Hot rocker chick and slamming rock music.  Also has some softer ballad type songs.  If you are into heavy rock...this album is for you.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This movie makes me laugh every time I watch it.  All of the baby drama and comedy is funny, fresh, and very well done.
B009AMANH4|5.0|Lincolns life from Jan. 1865 to his assassination. Including the passing of the 13 amendment to the  Constitution, that outlawed Slavery unless as punishment of a crime. Lincoln
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Hard to put down should have read much sooner.  Have recommended to all my friends!  Wicked ideas but somehow believable.
B00AIBZLVY|5.0|Yhis one is really scary! I sat on the edge of my chair all thru the movie. You don't want to miss this one. Mama is about a little girl that ends up possessed by a demon after buying a box at a yard sale.
B002KYHZLQ|5.0|I anticipate reading all of the series now.  I'm looking forward to seeing what happens next due to this book.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie will touch your heart.  The feelings that come through this film are unimaginable. A must see and a must have. On top of it is a real story. How I wish we could be as faithful as Hachi.<br />Thank you Amazon
B008TMA1LY|5.0|very fun entertainment game for all age i try it Once and can't stop playing, my 6yr old daughter asks for her game back all the time lol
B000O1799U|5.0|Diferent, refreshing and in someway realistic. Great film. I recommend it. The music is wonderful. Very enjoyable. You won't be sorry if you buy it.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|A great movie especially for one who wants a new start. All the cast is great, all interesting and flawed people who want to forget their pasts and start over. The hotel the movie is set in, is run down, but full of charm and it adds to the exotic setting of India. I especially liked Dame Judi Dench. She handles her life set backs with dignity and grace and does succeed in getting that second chance to be happy again. Loved the scenery and flavor of India. A great, feel good movie.
B000IDEORY|5.0|A oldie but a goodie gotta love Patrick Swazie.This is such a great movie that shows how it was in those times.Jennifer GRAY PLAYS HER PART SO WELL.
B009D8RJR2|5.0|A fantastic journey through the court system with a sexy lawyer and his team. I read the book very quickly, it was suspensful, fast  paced and kept me wanting to find out if our sexy lawyer won his case. The ending is great, didn't really suspect the novel to end as it did, which makes the story much more enjoyable. Michael Connelly has a dry with and his style of writing is superb.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|From all the episodes i have seen thus far, I love it. Grounded in as much realism as they can get from a comic book show. Can't wait to finIsh the season.
1586487981|5.0|This is a very readable, accessible book, and is a great primer for anyone looking to delve into development economics.  Love it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another masterful story written by Michael Connelly. In this one, Bosch is assigned a cold case of a foreign reporter who he briefly started to work on during the L.A riots. Due to better technology and computers analyzing old cases the gun used on Anneke gets linked to other gang banger deaths. Bosch follows up on some leads and starts to gain traction on this could case. Trouble is that he is close to retirement and higher ups don't want traction on a case involving a wire woman from the riot times rather than black or Latino deaths. Political pressure comes to bear on Bosch as he follows the leads to the 20 year old homicide. As many know, everyone matters to Bosch.<br /><br />Connelly is a brilliant writer. I can only assume that when Bosch is put out to pasture the reigns will be picked up by the daughter. Other writers I like are John Sandford, Kathy Reich's, and John Burdetts Bangkok series. Tired of seeing rave reviews and then reading something finding it to be less than stellar. By giving you some authors I like you can decide if  my review is what you would like.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|This series is a must have.  It was great to watch it when it was on TV and is great to own and be able to watch it anytime.  The value for the entire series plus the movies is worth it for the joy of having a great series to watch with the whole family.
B008476HBM|3.0|In today's culture of egocentrism, I wanted to learn more about a culture in which often the prime concern was for others.  A book one wades through, rather than devours.  Worth the wading, however.
B00915G6WQ|5.0|No matter what season you watch... Dexter is always a great series to watch.. Worth every penny to buy the seasons to watch over again...
B001GKJ2FM|3.0|I had a wide screen version of this musical (the one with Amanda Seyfried alone on the cover) before, and was very happy with it.  This full screen dvd seems to give me distorted pictures and not as sharp either.  Keeping it, but maybe better to buy a wide screen and use zoom to get rid of top & bottom black bars if you want good quality pictures.
034580404X|5.0|Great series to read... Best price you will find around... Checked a bunch of local store to comparison shop before deciding to buy online.. Worth every penny...
B00AAQWMB4|4.0|This game is really fun - it took me a while to figure it out - I had to read the directions a few times.  It is very fun and hard.  I've played it about 10 times or so and I've never won.
B00C81AVNU|5.0|I can't stop listening!!! SOOOOOOO  GOOOOOOODDDD, get this cd now, and go see the show on broadway Billy Porter Cyndi Lauper and more xo
B00915G6WQ|5.0|Really glad I received this in May instead of the usual July or August. Am a huge Dexter fan and he never disappoints!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I will all ways treasure this book.it's my favorite book. You should totally read it or you'll be missing out the fun.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a beautifully written, extremely well acted, and all around wonderful. The premise of a post apocalyptic world is a little out there, but the execution in this TV show is very realistic. I maintain that if, on a day were you found yourself with nothing better to do, you watched the entire series, you would not understand why there were no space ships outside your house and why people were not switching between speaking English and Chinese. This realism translates into slower as far as action goes, but overall it is rather addictive. The only thing I can complain about is that it isn't ten seasons long, and anyone familiar with Joss Whedon will love it. Anyone that likes westerns and space movies will love it.
B000055Y0X|5.0|One of the best movies, period. Although Kubrick had to con George C. Scott into his over-the-top acting, this movie will stand at a pinnacle for both of their careers.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|If a person couldn't go to sleep late at night and needed something to 'get them going' or they were having trouble with their sex life, then it might be OK.
B0090SI3ZW|5.0|The Dvd was intact, and in perfect condition. I would suggest for a gift, or just for yourself. Definite score!!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I watched this in my HD TV using my Blue Ray and the resolution wasn't as good as I expected. Probably was the connection to Internet, but I streamed others movies before and they looked better. It's a shame you don't include CC also. Sometimes I use it to understand better the dialogs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is amazing. Highly recommended if you like temple run and it is better than temple run so much fun.
B00A0L7PE8|2.0|Very bad music. It does not fit the standards on Prince's catalogue. It shouldn't have been released in the first place. The main song is bad, but the remixes are even worse! Not recommendable, even for a Prince freak like me.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a must- read for all ages im addicted and im 10 yrs old!! . I LOVE IT!
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|I am really enjoying this game.<br />The touch controls are great, but I cannot get used to the tilt controls.
1616550414|5.0|I'm a big Legend of Zelda Fan. As such I have my own Legend of Zelda site that I own and I like to provide people with official information from Nintendo about the Legend of Zelda series.<br /><br />The first third of the book goes into detail on the latest Legend of Zelda title, Skyward Sword, and it's characters, like Link, Zelda, Groose, and Demon Lord Ghirahim. It also goes into detail about how they made the characters, as well as how the final boss came to be and why they designed him the way they did.<br /><br />The second third of the book actually goes into detail about the Timeline Theory and how it splits after Ocarina of Time. If you're confused on how things are placed, this book tells you where each LOZ game is and why they are connected. They also tell you tidbits about the games that you didn't know. Like did you honestly realize how powerful Rauru, the Sage of Light, is?<br /><br />The last third of the book shows artwork from the past Legend of Zelda games. There's a lot of artwork more so for the recent games like The Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, Spirit Tracks, etc. Not only that, there is also a short 32 or so page manga that is a prequel to Skyward Sword (it's not canon... No Zelda Manga is canon).<br /><br />Overall, it's REALLY good investment for hardcore Zelda fans who really appreciate the series.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was late coming to the Downton Abbey scene.  What is this Downtown craze I wondered? And oddly, it wasn't until I watch Iron Man 3 and they referenced it in the movie that I decided to check it out.<br /><br />I watched the first episode and was hooked.  Thank goodness for Amazon Prime having all the seasons! Netflix only has season 1!<br /><br />If you ever watched The West Wing, you may understand how this show works.  You need to watch all of them, you can't blink or get up for a snack or help kids with HW, or even play Candy Crush while watching. There are always several story lines happening at once in each episode and you get a little on each.  Everything all the characters say and do is that important to the story, their character development or a deeper feel for the period.  You'll find people you love and others you love to hate and then when you think you know them like the back of your hand they can do something to surprise you.<br /><br />I loved the scenes, the costumes, the daily rituals and habits, the setting, the house, the visitors, everything.  I actually can't think of a single think I didn't love except how some things turned out.  The only other thing that was a little odd was the passing of time.  As you watch the show, it doesn't seem like years go by between episodes or seasons, but they reference it so you are expected to buy into that.  No one looks older or different so if I had to come up with a criticism that would be it.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy it even half as much as I did!
B00A7YZ1KI|4.0|Charlaine Harris really did try to dot all the i's and cross all the t's, and if she hadn't let herself introduce yet another supernatural system plus a rather hurriedly introduced character(Karin, Eric's other child)she would have succeeded well, although not magnificently.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|Fantastic! Wish you could make the later ones free, also. Watching maybe 5 and then finding the balance to cost $5.99 & up left us feeling a bit disheartened. Can rent it cheaper; however this series is fantastic!
B000007ODX|5.0|I love listening to Chopin's Nocturnes and have been searching for the best rendition for years. Over the years, I've listened to and purchased many quality versions of these Nocturnes (Pollini, Yundi, Moravec, Rubinstein, Ohlsson, Ashkenazy, Arrau, Pires, et al.) They are all very enjoyable, but there is something special about these recordings by Barenboim - flawless, smooth and very soothing.  I enjoy Barenboim's recording the most, followed by Pollini and then Yundi.
B0094MFITS|5.0|Fantastic! Wish you could make the later ones free, also. Watching maybe 5 and then finding the balance to cost $5.99 & up left us feeling a bit disheartened. Can rent it cheaper; however this series is fantastic!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|once you buy mighty eagle, and get rid of the annoying ads its pretty good to play, not happy that the pic got changed to a completely different app, which was deleted and i had to reload and lost all my progress
B000FBJF3M|4.0|The was a lot of adventure in an interesting historical fiction setting. It was a page turner and overall I enjoyed to book. My major problem was that the ending seemed hard to believe.
B004SJ3AXI|3.0|hate the fact that i havent yet found out how to PAY to get rid of the ads. hopefully ill work it out soon, pay up then get on with the game

B00AZMFK3K|2.0|This movie was terrible.  This is nothing more than the Transformers version of Star Trek.  Heavy on fluff, and light on substance.  JJ  Abrams is a hack who's limited bag of tricks is always evident.  He couldn't even come up with a new plot for the movie.  No, he gives us a copy of Star Trek 2.  He also manages to copy quite a few things from the last movie as well.  Kirk sleeping with an alien, more Spock tantrums, Uhura chasing after boyfriend Spock, Kirk and Pike drinking in a bar, old Spock giving advice, another scene of people flying around in the bullet shaped space suits, etc.  Oh, and the movie also sports a dozen more lens flares.  That never gets old, JJ.  Then of course you have his copying of scenes from Star Trek II.  What's a matter, JJ, can't come up with your own stuff?  Some of the things that Abarms does in these movies defy logic.  The guy hates transporters.  He looks for every possible way to avoid their use.  Why?  Who knows.  He's a freaking weirdo.  I was laughing when I saw the Klingons dropping from tethers from their ships.  LOL.  Yeah, that made a lot of sense in the 23rd century.  However, then he introduces us to long range beaming.  Huh?  Why would we need ships to get around if you can do that?  Didn't think this through very well did we?  That's okay, just insert another explosion.  Oh, well.  Another point I want to make is the characters.  Aside from Kirk being the worst captain in history, he also has very little chemistry with Spock.  Zach Quinto is a great actor and does a convincing Spock, but the relationship between the two falls flatter than a tortilla.  It's the poor writing that does them in.  How can these two possibly become this close of friends with that attitude that Kirk shows?  I wasn't buying it at all.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Well Charlaine tied up the loose ends with the vampires but it was too tidy. The plot was weak and boring compared to her earlier works. The last few books I only read to finish out the series. Once you read so many you at least want to finish it up. I didn't care for who she ended up with either. Usually there would be some kind of spark there to begin with. I didn't feel it. So I think the book was just okay. I imagine all the sales were made for people like me who just wanted to finish the series. Oh well.
B00CS65JS2|5.0|Daft Punk's latest release is not what you would expect from the French duo. Just as Human After All pushed the group in a new direction with its rock influence, Random Access Memories strays from the norm and pioneers a collision of old school with the magic touch of the robots themselves. If you were expecting something like the hits of old you'll leave disappointed.<br /><br />Disco and jazz are the dominant themes here with tracks such as Fragments of Time. The wonderful guitar work of Nile Rogers makes the smash hit Get Lucky a true winner and a catchy tune that would make any discotech DJ smile. The epic adventure that is Giorgio by Moroder will take you on a trip through time as the man who influenced Daft Punk's music tells of his rough journey to being a musician and creating something truly revolutionary.<br />The robots may be trying to tell us they have a pulse and a human side is present, but tracks like Doin' it Right and Contact keep are a reminder of the Daft Punk we all know and love.<br /><br />This album is not a true successor to previous work; instead it is something new and revolutionary. Instead of continuing to work on the sound Daft Punk created and made world famous they instead choose to abandon it in search of something the fans may not have wanted, but something the world deserves to hear.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It disintegrating and fun but also shows you how to take care of your own horse.In a way it is very educating.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|this isn't one of those match-three games you get bored with after playing only one or two times. the goal is to help the forest sprites rebuild the Tree of Life. you do this by completing different match-three scenes to build up the needed supplies. in each scene you need to match a certain amount of three different items (although there are about five or six different items mixed on each board. you also need to match as many coins as possible to build up enough to buy a bonus when they are needed (like a hammer to knock out an item in one cell or lightning for a whole column). although there are some cells in some puzzles you can only get rid of by using a bonus (in every puzzle each cell must be cleared at least once) there was never a puzzle that could not be finished. the puzzles progressively get harder but like I just said none are so hard that you cannot complete it. in all this is a very fun and relaxing game.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I got this app on my kindle and I got 0 bugs it's helpful and all the the videos go to the personal videos section so of ever hot reed do this app the videos will still be there.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Challenging and fun.  It is fun to build things, escape the different monsters, and play it with other friends.  Great!!!!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|Love this game.  It really challenges you! A lot different than Angry Birds. I think I like it better cause it makes you think more.
B000R8YC18|1.0|this movie sucks. i thought this was going to be compelling but it wasnt at all. it was quite dull and unwatchable. i turned it off five minutes into the flim
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|I don't really hate it.  I just don't like playing games online with other people. When I found out that it was that type of game I unloaded it.  But it would probably be fun for those who like to play with other people online.
B003GMJ9WO|5.0|There are many fine points made in this film with it's original and it's extended cut, not to mention all of the goodies on the side. Very much a classic blockbuster film. I hope that any Superman fan will get this and enjoy it as much as I have.
B009LGO88E|5.0|It was awesome! It worked really well for the 3DS XL for Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate. Me and my friend is having a blast in underwater fights and in G rank!
B004HW7JHE|5.0|I can't say enough good about this show. Everyone can identify with at least one character from the show and it makes you wish you lived in that era. If you were lucky enough to have done so, then good for you. The show definitely sucks you in!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|It's hard to neatly categorize Oblivion. Obviously it's a sci-fi movie, with amazing visuals of spectacular flying machines and a ruined Earth. But it's also a strong drama, and a  tender love story. The one problem I had was it takes a while slowly building up to the movie's surprise-you know something's coming but it takes it's time. I'm not a huge fan of Tom Cruise, but his acting was great.
B00A7YZ1KI|1.0|An extremely disappointing end to one of my favourite series. I actually wish that I stopped reading after the last book!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Enjoyed it very much.  Will be getting into season 3 soon.  Was going to start season 3 last night but couldn't remember my pin (it was in my computer downstairs).  I would recommend this series.
0316044938|4.0|This is one of my favorite books. This little girl's story hooks you from the beginning & leaves you breathless by the end. You won't be sorry you read it! I highly recommend it.
B00CW665VI|5.0|OMG! everyone should read this …even guys! This book is written in the male perspective and its absolutely positively hilarious!!! I couldn’t put it down. Its sarcastic as hell….and just refreshing when everything out there is more of the same. Great job Emma Chase!
B000FC0P9E|1.0|Don't waste your time on this one. I kept waiting for something...ANYTHING, to happen. It never does. I felt jilted for purchasing it (although it was second-hand & didn't cost much) & for the time I spent reading it. This is not his best work, that's for sure!
1400160782|5.0|Good quality recording from this tried-and-true provider.  Excellent voice talent and a pleasure to listen to, really captured the essential qualities of Jane Austen's characters.
B00CS65JS2|1.0|This isn't really Daft Punk in the EDM sense, this is an attempt at revival disco.  Problem is, Daft Punk's strength is not live disco.  The album has a few shiny spots, but otherwise is unremarkable and some vocals are very weak.  Not their best work.
B0064MGU98|5.0|This show is very well written and has a super cast, both known and unknown.  The parallel story arcs are strongs and keep you coming back for the next episode.
B0058BI864|5.0|The Big Bang Theory is such a fun and hilarious show to watch...My husband and I watch an episode or 2 each day...great stress relief!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|As a fan of good legal drama, this has been among the best I've ever seen. The series brilliantly weaves the wife's personal struggles at home with her unfaithful husband and children with her attempts to put her own life in order by returning to work as an attorney after her husband loses his elected position to to a sexual scandal. I have seen all of Boston Legal and Damage, and this is as good as these. Among the best TV available.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|read it, read it again, read it and look up the characters, read it with wiki references.  One of the best books I've gotten into in years.
193700788X|3.0|This book is so unlike her other books, that I suspect Harris was ordered to write a novel RIGHT NOW, based on a list of criteria writtten by a committee. I don't think this is the book she wanted to write. I think it's mediocre, but I don't think it's her fault. To be honest, this doesn't even read like the rest of the books. Parts of it read true, but most of it reads like someone else wrote it in Harris' name. It would not surprise me to find out she didn't write it.<br />You can get details in other reviews.<br />Short version: Things are finalized up with Sam, Eric, and Arlene; but in an unbelievable, short-changed manner.<br />We greet several characters from Sookie's past, but in a forced manner. It isn't a satisfying ending to the series, but at least it wraps things up (albeit in a loose and leaky package).
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Somewhat interesting, but extensive medical back-up to justify the religious insight seemed cheap. The coma experience not explained well enough.
B0052CK5PQ|5.0|Should be a school textbook. So much goodness. Humorous and deep. Highly recommend to anyone who wants an introduction to women.
B000HSKUBE|2.0|was not interested in this particular series wanted the current one with kevin spacey and company in it. ! oh well will have to try again another time
0385349947|5.0|This author did a great job of bringing up & addressing &#34;second order&#34; gender discrimination.  I'm at least 10 years older than the author and the barriers I encountered in my professional life were often more blatent than what Ms. Sandberg describes.  Things that happened to me are now not politically correct (I'm happy to say!), however discrimination has taken different forms, which Ms. Sandberg does a good job of identifying.  She has some great advice and raises some topics that need to be addressed in today's world for everyone.<br /><br />I have shared this book with 2 other people.  It's an important one for today's times.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Excellent Game, good Graphics.  I will recommend this to all my friends who like to play game on their smarphone.
B0083DJUMA|5.0|This book is grreat for understanding the changes that are occuring.  It is similar to 1970s and PC with Jobs and Gates starting out.
B008BU75IQ|2.0|Loved. the entire Clifton Chronicles.  Kept you wanting more.  Eagerly awaited last book in series. Sorry to have it end.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I completely fell in love with Travis & Abby!!! I loved that this story was not so much about sex like all of the Fifty Shades knockoff' s that are out right now. I was just so sad when it was over bc I did not want the story to end! I was so happy to find out about Walking Disaster, the story told from Travis' s point of view! Reading that let me enjoy it all over again!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|This will be an excellent addition to my classroom library for Dr. Seuss week.  Arrived on time and was everything it was described to be.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I had a hard time putting this one down. I highly recommend this book - it's not the &#34;scary&#34; Stephen King, it's the fantastic story telling Stephen King. This one would be great to read on a vacation.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This will be an excellent addition to my classroom library for Dr. Seuss week.  Arrived on time and was everything it was described to be.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|Food, Inc. was done properly. Exposing the Conspiracy and unrighteous behavior of Corporate America, The United States Goverment, and mammon. The complete abandonment of good sense and morals, overtaken and strong armed by Greed, bullying, and the pursuit of Dominance over one of our most precious resources- the American Farmer. Although, some things were not mentioned, the United States Government is still paying farmers not to grow food, when there is so much starvation in this earth. And do not let me get started on this Mosanto seed fiasco. Down the road, genetically engineered anything will prove to be a curse. Man always corrupts when he tries to play God. Back in the late fifties, all of our grown crops were good. There was no such thing as organic. Milk only had 3 days code for instance. Then some shrewd mind got to thinking, &#34;lets pull all the good stuff off the shelves, and all the good ingredients out of the food, hide it for awhile, start pumping the consumer with a bunch of fluff, put it in a nice package, cut the weight down, raise the prices twice a year, make a handsome profit, then re-introduce the good stuff back into the mainstream, call it organic  and charge triple for that!&#34;  I applaud those Independant Farmers who have told Big Brother, that they refuse to bow to Baal.
B0091W4PRC|5.0|Can't think of a better uplifting movie of charity.  Good for kids to teach many life lessons and how to be a Christian.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a suspenseful book. The first few chapters took me a little to get into but once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. My first impressions changed quickly and I couldn't believe what was happening next. The last page of the book had one of my favorite few lines that I still go back to read. If you haven't read this yet, you need to make it your next read!
0316228532|1.0|Most boring book I've read in a long time. The foul language was no redeemer. I think J.K. should stick to Children's/young adult books.<br />I'm a huge fan of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter Series. I own the complete set. But I'm disappointed in both the story line and definitely the foul language. Yes, I guess we all know how kids talk these days. And the socialite hypocrisy is nothing new either. But invite that sort of scum into my living room? I don't think so. The only reason I read the book to the end was my search for what is supposed to mark her as 'a story teller like no other'. Not in this book, as far as I could determine.<br /><br />And 'texting' etc. in the EARLY FOURTIES? Give me a break!
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|I tried this game, but I think it's too strange for me.  I deleted it the same day I added it.  Oh well.
B0052UYJDC|4.0|This book helped me look at the things in my home in a different way. Some suggestions didn't quite work for me but many did. I found some thoughts and information repeated a lot throughout the book but that could be helpful for some to remember the main points. I did a lot of highlighting and will likely review them again.
B0066WJLU6|3.0|most features I liked until my phone was overheated to the point it wouldnit shut off or function for 15 -20 minutes and today it is a tempramental, unpredictable ( shuts off whatever it want ) This is a Motorolla Razor, feb, 2013 build expensive flaslike
B00571F26Y|4.0|Illuminating! Could this all be true? Brought to my attention by my health conscious son who also is concerned  about my health. Will work with this and report back.
B009NY43NY|5.0|These books are never disappointing, definitely another hit for Charlaine Harris. I'm very sad that this is the last one to be written but I must say it had a sweet ending that I didn't expect, I thought for sure Sookie would end up with Eric . I recommend these books to everyone I know :)
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved it and am looking forward to reading more novels by E L James.  Also, can't wait to see the movie.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Definitely a great read for peace in your heart. Interesting and satisfying. Easy to follow and uplifting indeed. Would definitely recommend
0802473156|5.0|my husband and i enjoyed reading this book together. we now have a greater understanding of each-other's emotional needs. very informative and highly recommended!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book. I can't even describe it. It had me in tears for days. It's amazing and everyone should read it.
B000002OZY|5.0|Well, If there was ever a Concert to witness. It has to be a 1969-71 WHO Concert for sure.<br />Aside that...The Tommy Album was the Break-away Hard Rock sound of the ERA.<br />All before the Later Greats...<br />Of course WHO's NEXT is an exceptional follow-up and has the most famous songs...<br />Quadrophenia [ 1979 ] is ever as good as TOMMY.<br />These CD versions may not have the snap crackle pop of the records...but plenty LOUD
B00CWVFPGO|4.0|A lot better than I expected.  A nail biter. Keep us on the edge of our seats. A must see!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|This game is what I default to when I can't find wifi on my Kindle and am bored of the other games I have.<br />I mean, it's solitaire.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The \\"My Alarm Clock\\" is a great addition to my apps.  Works very well and is reliable and easy to use.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|The movie is nice and lengthy, like it should be! It has the classic cliffhanger ending that the LotR had!<br />I would suggest it to all my friends, even if they don't like the LotR!<br />Although my copy came in the worst packaging I have ever recieved, the product was in tip-top shape. Except for the fact that it was shrink wrapped, not &#34;new&#34;.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|doesn't work.!  don't bother downloading.  wont play videos all you hear is sound then it freezes. uninstalling! 1 star for sure
0596009208|5.0|I am a web developer that uses VB.NET and ASP.NET at work. Unlike the book I read while learning VB, this book conditions the reader to become familiar with object oriented techniques along with teaching java. Many of the concepts and tips translate easily to any programming language. I'm about half way through and I am completely satisfied with this book. The tone and delivery of all the lessons are incredibly easy to understand and helpful. Compared to other books, I am learning better and faster with this book. I would absolutely recommend it to anyone who wants to learn programming.
B0087EACJK|4.0|This is a really fun puzzle game, it takes a couple tries to beat some of the higher up levels. Even though the game play is simple it is very addictive and can keep you entertained for a good long while. I think this game may be a bit better on a larger screen so if you have a tablet this game would be great for you
B000RGUNHW|5.0|Great blu ray 100% recomended, its remastered versión on DVD the great tour Joshua tree in 1997 great sound. Documentary with great versions this live versión. Bad, Sunday Bloody Sunday, MLK, With or without you and others.
B00BF123WG|5.0|Had that &#34;Homeland&#34; quality to it.  Very suspenseful and appeared to be realistic.  Much better than what I thought when it was first released.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|This topic could have been played off as too campy, too sad, too too but the blend of humor and believability was balanced enough to make it an enjoyable easy to watch film.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This games makes you search out clues and you need to think about what and where they belong, to be able to find another clue
B00004L8JI|5.0|I accidentally ordered a zone 2 or district 2 when I only watch zone 1.  The company was very helpful to resolve this problem for me.
B00B2166BS|5.0|Frees up the micro usb port to be used for other things. Connects easily, charge time has been reduced by about 15-20%.
B00015YVD6|5.0|I love this movie! It takes me back to good times at the local theater as a child.  This movie came to me undamaged and quickly after order confirmation was complete.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|The movie moves from one side of Japan to the other in a way that makes everything cohesive. I was so glad it ended the way it did.
B00CL66FEQ|1.0|Thought it might be funny terrible. No, just terrible terrible. It's nothing but horrible dialog between the two. That's it, horrible dialog between Seth rogen and Barbra Streisand.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|The Thirteenth Tale is filled with old world charm. The characters are well thought out, and the story line is unique. I loved this book and can't wait to read the authors next work. I have recommended the book to all of my women friends.
B004UPAN6W|4.0|This is a fun action packed movie. I enjoyed it as a distraction on Memorial day. Just good plain fun.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I ordered this for my Kindle so it arrived instantly.  It is really a good book too!!  It's still on the NY Times Best Seller List!
B004ZMWUCU|1.0|Slow and uninspiring.  The character development was lacking and I never felt connected to the story.  I would not recommend this book.
B0037EPYLG|5.0|YMMV, but these are my favorites from Eric Clapton. I read his autobiography a couple of years back after seeing a special exhibit for him at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, OH. He is an excellent musician who overcame numerous challenges in his life. I am glad that this collection was available.
B00005JNS0|5.0|This DVD is in excellent condition and my sons favorite movie. The movie has a great story line even my husband continues to watch it.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|We recently watched Reacher. We = my husband and a good friend. They (hubby & friend) are both fans of the Reacher books by Lee Child. They both agreed that Tom Cruise did not exactly match the picture they had in their head of what the character should look like but they did like, overall, how Cruise portrayed the character.<br />I, on the other hand, have not read the books and enjoyed the movie. There were a few unexpected twists and turns and I don't usually like action movies. All in all, I would recommend Reacher.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Love the series! Hope that the rest of the series completes what has already happened and makes the series worth while till the end.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My boy loves this he completed his collection of angry bird games he usually plays this on my phone I love have this on my kindle to free up my phone
B00139XTG4|5.0|This is precisely the bold and innovative approach to randomness that both the financial industry and it's regulators need to learn. Taleb's argument's are both simple and powerful, and the implications are far greater than anyone realizes.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|great movie.  watched again with my grandkids.  good humor, easy to follow, top notch actors. gave insight into the whole issue of understanding those who are different.
B003SNJZ3Y|4.0|This is definitely the most comprehensive review of 2oth century hedge funds I have found. Starting from the beginning of the 20th century and going all the way up to the end the author leads us on a tour of the colorful personalities and egos that have left such a profound impact on our financial markets.
B00BUADSMQ|2.0|A big disappointment. Yes, it stars Bruce Willis, but he doesn't seem like the John McClane of the previous films. Before, he was an everyman grunt cop with family issues who is thrown into mayhem. This \\"McClane\\" is not like that. It could be any of the other generic characters Willis has played over the years.<br /><br />If you like to see lots of stuff blown up and destroyed, and characters surviving impossible crashes and falls with hardly a scratch, then this movie is for you. If you want a Die Hard movie that resembles the others, this is not it.
1439110123|5.0|Don't be afraid of the 900 plus pages, this book reads like a good spy novel. Both the breadth and depth with which Mr. Yergin covers the growth of the oil industry is spell-binding and highly relevant to the geo-politics of today. Anyone, who wants to begin to understand how the global markets work needs to start with this book.
B0019ZMN5A|5.0|Any cd with a bunch of naked dudes jumping a fence is worth listening to. In fact, I've purchased quite a few albums now based solely on the quantity and/or quality of naked people in the album artwork. This one was definitely a good choice. Sometimes, I find I become more taken by the artwork than the actual music (LOL!). In fact, I can't even understand a single word this guy says on the entire album.. I guess I just trust that his lyrics mean something good, and powerful, and positive. But I love nudes. I'm not addicted or anything, I just love me some good nudes. Ya feel me?<br /><br />Great album. It'll really tickle your fancy.
B000NMW6M0|3.0|It is hard to understand the connection among these stories.<br />Even though the actors and actress have good performance in this drama.
B00BY9GQHM|5.0|Great game! I didn't get bored with it like I do with some games. I would even play it again which I very rarely do.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|It this a real good show hope they have more coming cause in books it the best bottom line and the two acting bothers make it they so good together
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|If you like SiFi then this series is a must see. Great special effects and awesome storylines. I just loved it
B00CL50KDY|5.0|Absolutely one of the cutest and most creative movies to come out for quite a while in Hollywood. Though the plot line is a modern day Romeo and Juliet one will find surprising twists and turns and end up with a cute lovely little movie. Time well spent.
B002DEZXOE|5.0|An excellent historical reference, I couldn't have been there, this was the next best option for me. I have seen this movie twice now and I expect to see it many more times in the future.
B007HO392S|5.0|Excelant. I am not familiar with any of her other albums but this album had a lot of great songs in it.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We love the interaction of the help with the upper class. Also the period and the setting in the english countryside.
B00004Y6NW|3.0|I was not familiar with the album in its entirety. It had some good material. In My opinion it was not as good as some of there later material.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|has always been one of my favorite outer space shows, and being able to watch it on my kindle is the greatest.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|this game was really good i had to have some help from my friends to complete it but in the end i was surprised to find out that the preacher was the one who did it
B008Z9YGEE|3.0|Futuristic,appeared to be a low budget film..not alot of props,very simple sets,story line was entertaining enough to watch till end..
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This  was a great book. The adventures really lived up to my expectations and there were a few twists. But, u have to follow along or u might get lost and loose interest in this book. By  otherwise this is a fantastic book and would recommend it to anyone that likes mystery, supernatural, and some intertwined conflicts with the characters.<br />Definitely worth buying.
B005D63ICI|5.0|Dexter is AWESOME!!  Love this show!! It is my favorite. Michael Hall is great as Dexter.  Funny, suspenseful, sad...all emotions wrapped up in one.
B00CB4ET0K|4.0|It's a really good game and its fun,but prices are high lower it.Please lower the prices In the next update.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This is a great movie.  Starts out a little confusing, but the story comes together perfectly.  The ending is predictable, but you want it to happen that way so bad that you are happy when you find out that it does end they way you want it to.  I never saw a preview so I had no idea Robert DeNiro is in it.  He plays the stubborn superstitious father perfectly and is pretty funny as well.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I have this for my phone and when I saw I could get this for my kindle I was so happy, my life would not be organized with out it.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I liked this movie.  Tom Cruise is always a favorite so I'll watch anything with him in it. Can't wait to see what he's in next
B009NY43NY|5.0|The latest (and last) Sookie Stackhouse novel resolves many themes and characters in a satisfying manner. I will miss these novels, but hope Ms. Harris begins a new series as interesting and unique as her others.
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|This is a funny movie, but not as funny as I expected it to be.  This is still a pretty good movie and I would watch it again.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Nice game...good graphics.  I like that in addition to building your city, you also get to take place in battles.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|I'm a guy and I'll admit that this movie was pretty funny.  I was actually laughing out loud at a few parts
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was looking forward to this book forever because I am a huge fan of Sookie. But this book was a let down and the worst book of the entire series.good thing the series is over because if not, I certainly would hate to have to read another one written like this.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|This was such a great continuation.  I was bummed that Matt Damen wasn't in it, but this was still an excellent movie
B00280LYIC|5.0|This is the first book of Rick Riordan's first young adult series: Percy Jackson and the Olympians. Like all of the books in this series, Riordan's characters are lovingly human, despite their half god status.  They gain wisdom as we do: through experiences that aid them overtly through the book to understand, to have compassion from referencing their own pain, and to accept redemption as the natural of course of life. Throughout the series, various characters reach turning points, choose isolating personal power or fellowship and self-examination.  Vastly entertaining, with loads of humor, the messages sneak easily into the Reader's mind without the tedium of preaching. A great read and a great beginning for a masterful series.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|This is a great movie for the family.  It's a fun spin on all the monster myths.  I would watch it again with my kids
B00BGIC4I6|2.0|Although the film had a good premise it was marred by the lack of acting talent as regards to the children cast in the roles.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|These new James Bond movies are absolutely amazing.  They keep you at the edge of your seat and are just put together well.
B00082IJ08|5.0|If you love Gorillaz this is a great album.  I play it all the time and my grandson loves it as well and he's 8 years old.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|I can't Wait for the next one to come out.  I loved Lord of the Rings so this type of movie is right up my alley
B0055SWM08|4.0|Would give it five stars if there was a way to look up the behavior of the less frequently appearing objects.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|This was so different from the original that they should have just called it something else and you would never have known it was a knock off.  The original Judge Dredd was with Sylvester Stallone and obviously had a large budget.  This Movie looked like a low budget remake with a completely different take.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Will freeze or even crash if played for long enough.  The method used to rescramble tiles rarely results in a layout that can be solved without further rescrambling until there are six to eight tile remaining.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|What a great story.  I've only watched this movie once, but I need to watch it again.  This is the type of movie where every person has a different opinion of what the meaning is.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|This is fun.  I'm no artist at all but this is fun to play with our daughter who lives many miles away.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|This movie was much better than I thought it was going to be.  They did a good job of making you believe that Abraham Lincoln had a secret life
B00785P2QC|5.0|GREAT GAME. A lot of fun and very addicting. Can not stop playing. Entirely way too much fun to put down my life kindle fire HD.
B00CW665VI|4.0|3.5-4 Stars<br />This one was a little bit of a rough start for me. I normally love, love love the male POV in stories, I love that we can have insight into their inter workings. With that said though, I had a hard time liking Drew's voice. For me he came off so arrogant, as well as confident. I get why he was arrogant being doted over and made a little prince as a child. It still just annoyed me! His perspective on women or most women,was a little harsh basically only good for one thing and that would be sex. However as the story progresses, I get use to Drew's voice and enjoy watching him humbled by Katherine. It was fun to watch them fight, banter, tell each other no way and make up. In the end it was a hilarious, eye rolling, LOL, sweet, enjoyable read.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Really like the witty writing and realistic legal setting.  Character development is top notch; intellectuals along with plenty of quirky traits to keep plots fresh and entertaining.  Finally - a return to well-crafted programming and a break from empty reality shows!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Though it was too light and chick flicky to actually hit on real issues, it made a modest attempt all to be finished off with some hilarious comedic relief.
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved this book. It was funny and sweet. Reminded me alot of Wallbanger. Drew and Kate were both smart, witty, sexy and funny. It was even emotional. Drew is hilarious. Tells like it is, too funny. Kate holds her own. She's tough. Very, very enjoyable. Can't wait for book 2!!!!!!!!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Awesome time killer.  You can't exactly make the city exactly how you want it but it's still fun.  The only drawback is having to do stuff like this to earn one of the currencies if you want to keep it free to play.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|I never watched it during its original run.  Apparently not many other people did either, since it was cancelled after a single season.  It is a bit sad that these characters did not get a chance to grow beyond an awesome Season 1 and a dissappointing movie.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|This show is amazing! I am really happy the Lost series is free with prime membership. Starting season 3 right away
B00170M2OY|5.0|Robin Williams and Dustin Hoffman are thoroughly entertaining in this classic. I had forgotten how nice and feel good fun the story was. I'd bring my kids to see it in a second .
1476734941|5.0|Author's explanation of why intermittent fasting is not a weird way of eating made sense to me.  It's tough, but the results are dramatic.
B005LAIIJY|2.0|I have to start with this because of the number of responses I am seeing to reviews that are along the lines of \\"well, obviously you've never seen a QT movie or you'd know better.\\" So let me state, right off the bat, I have seen QT movies - a lot of them. I have even liked them back when he actually made GOOD movies. Yes, he likes his blood spatter, dramatic effects and his cameo. I'm cool with all of that. I am cool with the violence, I am cool with the language. I've never really understood the current-day freak out over \\"that\\" word anyways. I have to say \\"that word\\" since Amazon won't even let me quote it without censoring. But I digress.<br />What I DIDN'T like about this movie was the reverse-racism, self-hating, PC, illogical, sexist, nonsensical b**ls*** that this movie portrayed. How did I hate it? Let me count the ways:<br />1. Kelly Washington maybe advertised as a main character but she's complete fluff. She pops up occasionally to be Django's imaginary wife, wave at him and vanish. And then, when she is there, she cries, faints and needs rescuing a lot.<br />2. While I don't mind violence in general, and I get the QT was trying to give us a sense of the horrors of black slavery, he botched. Badly. I don't care how much money you have. If you shell out the equivalent of the price of a new car it doesn't start on the third day, you DON'T take a sledge hammer to it. Not a very PC thought I know, but since the scene with the dogs was done entirely to give us the \\"white man bad\\" take, they least they could have done was made it believable instead of just gross. Sadly, buying his winning fighter a beer was probably more accurate in that scene. Where are the fields and the lousy living conditions that were the ACTUAL issues with slavery? Where is the heat, the exhaustion and the overseers making those marks that Django wears? True, these are less flashy than Mandingo fighting but much more insidious issues in the time period.<br />3. For that matter, if \\"white man bad\\" than why do they seem to do very little to their black \\"slaves\\" other than say ni... oops, I mean, \\"that word\\" a lot? Aside from the flashback people and actual slavers who die nasty deaths anyways the whites don't seem very bad - just not very bright. Otherwise blacks curse at their \\"masters\\" a lot, giggle and flirt and well, DON'T act oppressed. Except the crying, waiting for rescue Kelly Washington anyways. Hell, on the way back from the funeral they are all linking elbows despite color differences!<br />4. White hating: Calvin Candie who is the BIG bad guy mainly takes sass from his \\"slaves,\\" has the audacity to get pissed off that guests in his house were looking to screw him (think \\"screw\\" will get censored?\\") and then gets shot for insisting on being treated courteously. Stephen is portrayed as a horrible man for being loyal and for being filled with grief when the young man he has raised since infancy is shot in front of him. Miss Laura is blown out a doorway, apparently for the sole reason that she's white - or maybe because she's related to Candie. Django, on the other hand, is given the moral freedom to kill anyone he wants to, whether they are law abiding or not, innocent or not, as long as they're white. At least Schultz - as the token \\"okay\\" white guy - had a moral code as a bounty hunter though Django seems to have learned all the wrong lessons from him.<br />5. If one more person refers to this as \\"history\\" I may scream.<br /><br />I'm sure there's more, but I'm getting writer's cramp at this point. Short form, the movie started out good and got real bad, real fast. And no, being directed by Tarantino does not excuse or make up for that.y do they seem to do very little to their black \\"slaves\\" other than say ni... oops, I mean, \\"that word\\" a lot?

B008B1BL4E|5.0|My husband purchased this book as the 1st book he put on his kindle.  He enjoyed the book & enjoyed using the kindle as well.
B00CS7ZIHI|4.0|Love this album, huge fan and I think they did a great job. If you like Thirty Seconds to Mars then you really cant go wrong with this album.
0194001024|4.0|I like it because beside explaining English word, it gives sentence how to use the same word and make easy to understand the appropriate meaning.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Love, love, love this...it has a cheat where there are no bombs and you can play for long periods of time perfecting your swipe!
B00C4GRGQY|5.0|I definitely think lighting is the key to a great photograph and Neil van Niekerk has done a fabulous job with this book. Its easy reading and easy to follow. The photos are very well done and eye catching. Good job Neil!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My kiddo can't get enough! While he's only 6, I'm amazed at his ability to think his way through this grand adventure!
B00005RHGL|5.0|I love this movie.Kurt Russell and Val Kilmer were just great.They played their characters to perfection.There was not one thing that I did not like about this movie.
B000001DZQ|5.0|What more is there to say ,one of the best guitarists of all time ,that many did not know . Could have toured with the Stones ,chose to stay home with family,most great played the. Fender Telecaster. Jeff Beck dedicated<br />The classic because we ended as lovers to Roy after his untimely death.BTW his death under very suspicious circumstances,for the record.  This Album has a lot of great blues rock and roll.his mastery if the Telecaster<br />Is  a great showcase from so e country twang to get down guitar work an d several songs he rewrites his own twist of rock and roll classics and does an Excellent job !!  If you Don't know him  he was one of the master of the Telecaster<br />Overlooked  because he chose it to be that way .one of the best guitarist of all time !!  Roy RIP.
B009AMANBA|2.0|I was disapointed with this movie.It was not what I expected it to be.The politicians sitting around talking politics was not interesting nor entertaining.Sorry,this one was a total flop to me.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|I've really enjoyed this album. I bought it when it was first released and it still doesn't disappoint. There is something for everyone and each song is different. Even the songs that haven't been released as singles are great... It's worth it to have in your collection and enjoy.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Ive been playing this game for 10 minutes and I already love it. Would recommend for everyone 2 thumbs up!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this on my kindle fire.  I download documents from website into the program and able to save them....its great!
B000002H4C|4.0|Replaced my vinyl and this soundtrack is much better than the movie.<br />Sammy Hagar song alone is worth it. But you have some good bands like BOC, Black Sabbath (Dio),<br />Nazareth, Trust, Stevie Nicks, Journey, Grand Funk Railroad.
B00CE004XM|5.0|i also have the 1st cd beth hart and joe banamassa did together and this cd is just as good of not better than there 1st. both cd's are great knock your sox off r&b. i hope they tour in the us someday.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I acknowledge that Ms.Harris had wanted to end the series earlier.  Had she done so, the story in this book probably would have been more interesting.  But she didn't, and it isn't and I still bought the book.<br /><br />If you did not give up after the last couple of books, you should finish the series off.  However, if you did give up earlier, there's no compelling reason to read this.
B000SEI230|5.0|This book is s great find! It will make you feel like being the best possible person you can become. Be ready to be moved & feel loved by God.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|Soundgarden is back and better than ever. Hard-rockin' release - not a bad song on it, but the first 6 are killer. They still have the ability to weave a tapestry of metal and classic rock vibes that appeals to a very broad audience. I got the CD with the bonus tracks and it helped me to appreciate just how well this release is produced. Listening to the raw tracks and demos highlights the efforts that go into the final cut.
B001ANYDAO|4.0|The author did a good job of illustrating that no one is a success in life in and of themselves.  Success requires a supportive social network from parents to the proverbial lucky breaks - getting into the right schools, being born in the right era or even year, having access to rare resources, etc.  The author effecitvely makes the case that success isn't ever due solely to innate ability but a combination of ability, support, timing and opportunities.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  I watched it as part of my Amazon Prime.  Very good quality viewing it via internet.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I have watched many seasons of Dr. Who from the very beginning.  It only gets better each year.  The stories and the special effects.
B0020M99LC|5.0|For all those who thought Daniel Craig was going to be a bland Bond he sure proved them wrong.  I found this movie thoroughly entertaining.  It was filled with lots of fast paced action and great scenes of thrills, stunts and romance.
B002DD67XG|5.0|Sometimes when you are in the mood for some mellow rock, this is a perfect album (disc just does not seem right).
B003FL4O9E|4.0|i just recently introduced my kids to Ninja turtles, they love it, I love it, the Hd quality is pretty good.
B001RHPJBU|5.0|I have not heard his songs in years.  Enjoyed hearing these and will have to find some of his Genesis work to round out my collection.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone looking for  sappy love story with an amazing plot and realistic characters. This book is inspiring and absolutely exceptional! A MUST read.
B006ZZAMWK|4.0|My kids love this.  It is not so bad.  I had the partridge family when I was their age. Word.
B00821OX98|2.0|concept was good but ...it has too much bad drama and I will not continue to watch...the aliens were cool
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Funny movie, especially if you are or have an overbearing yet loving mother!  Kept waiting for Streisand to break out in song!
B007A4SDCG|2.0|This book was highly recommended by my friends because I am a painter. I came to it with high hopes but was disappointed. There is a kernel of truth to the its major theme, which is about overcoming procrastination, but overall it is reductionist and trite and never elaborates beyond the obvious. Spurious social and medical claims flow without footnote and all manner of negative things are attributed to the sinister entity known as Resistance. Overcoming this obstacle offers a panacea for what-ails-ye creatively, a hallmark of self-help schlock. The author is self deprecating and comes across as candidly honest but the staccato style reads like the ravings of a street preacher. It's not completely without merit, but I would say save your money.
B005OYKIJ0|5.0|a great addition to the series. i just wish they had not messed up the order of the events through out the series.
B005DC68NI|5.0|After researching self-publishing on the internet, I stumbled across David's blog. I liked what he had to say so much that I instantly purchased this ebook.<br /><br />I wasn't disappointed! Actually, I couldn't put it down. In fact, I was up until 2am the first night I started reading it. Inside you'll discover tons of information. David's writing is very balanced, as are his opinions about the publishing industry. This was also a well produced product - nicely edited, clear and concise. It was a real pleasure to read.<br /><br />If you are on the fence about deciding wether to self publish or not, I would highly recommend you check it out. You won't be disappointed.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|This book is not the type I usually read but its notoriety got to me and I had to at least have a taste of what it was all about.  While I would not rave about it, it was entertaining and kept my interest.  I would certainly read the next book.
