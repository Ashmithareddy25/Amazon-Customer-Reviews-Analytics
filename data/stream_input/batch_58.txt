B000002J09|5.0|I bought this album just because &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; is on it, not caring if I hated every other song on the album because that song is so good that it's worth the money alone.  Well I was pleased to hear that  there are other wonderful songs on this album as well.  As real contender  for greatest album of all time...well almost!
B00001ZTMY|5.0|I only had to listen to 3 songs(&quot;La Lettre&quot;, &quot;Les Miens&quot;, &quot;Manifeste&quot; to convince me to get that album. Influenced by the oriental culture(Martial Arts...), Shuriken delivers a  bomb with his first solo album. This album proves that he's as excellent in  solo as with IAM. Personally between &quot;L'Ecole du Micro  d'Argent&quot;(IAM,1997) and &quot;Ou Je Vis&quot; it's hard for me to tell  which one is the best Rap album(US, Canada &amp; France) I've ever heard. I  think any rap/hip-hop fan would appreciate this album. It's a BOMB!
B000002BE9|4.0|The only real problem I have with this CD is that it can be seen as somewhat misleading.  Many people (including myself) purchased this album after hearing &quot;Criminal&quot; on the radio, tv..whatever.  However the  rest of the album is not the same sound as that song.  The rest of the  songs are a lot slower and more soulful.  It certainly is a very impressive  album but I can see how some people would be frustrated and left to feel  mislead.
0679746048|5.0|My older brother gave me this book as a Christmas present. I absolutly LOVED this book! I didn't think I'd enjoy it as much as I did. It was wonderfully written. I was absorbed in this book. I loved it. I recommend  it to everyone.
067144901X|5.0|Buy this book, and the first time you hear your child sing &quot;la la la&quot; after you say &quot;Three singing pigs say...,&quot; you'll know you got your money's worth.
0684872153|4.0|Yes this is a great story--but nowhere have I seen any review which dares to say--&quot;The McCourts where failures as parents ,an alcholic and his codependent wife who stood by immersed in their false irish pride and  delusions they would have been prosecuted for child endangerment ,if not  manslaughter . This book practically affirms every biased , bigoted ,racist  stereotype of their neer do well drunked irish .Yes the child sees his  parents through nostalgic eyes of love---but the truth remains -his father  was a selfish drunken bum---and if his mother had one once of common sense  she would have thrown him out ---The book becomes a homage to the stupidity  of the parents,thier relatives. the Catholic Church  ,and Ireland. I  couldnt stand this depressing tale of child abuse but pressed on --hoping  somehow his mother would do something to save these children---. What  ultimately saved Frank? A luxky break--he was born in the U.S.A and was  ultimately  use his U. S. citzenship to bail out of the isle of misery.I'm   an Irish-American and can say this book has sickened me forever of the  tales of the &quot;Emerald Isle&quot; and its inhabitants--
B00001YXH5|5.0|Having watched two previous productions on video(Nouvelle experience, Saltimbanco), I can honestly say that Quidam has to be the most visually  and artistically stunning of the three.<br />Unlike the first two, annoying  camera angles and effects are kept to a bare minimum, except for the German  Wheel act. Also, the quality of the tape itself (image and sound) is  superior and comes in nice clamshell packaging. <br />I will not bother   decribing the acts when much will be lost in the translation anyway and the  wonder and magic can only really be appreiciated visually in a show or on  video. However, I will say this. These current group of performers touring  Europe having got to be the finest I have seen. There is really no  substitute for perfection and this is the one of the more impressive  aspects of this show. While other shows have employed the use of safety  devices ( don't get me wrong, I'm all for safety), this troup has the  confidence and competence to execute  their amazing stunts mostly without  the use of any saftey apparatus. Maybe the degree of difficulty might be a  factor, but being propelled upwards in the air and ending up in a handstand  position on top of a 3 man human pyramid is just incredible.<br />More  impressive is the way all the acts are choreographed to the haunting and  mesmerizing music composed by Benoit Jutras. From the majestic opening, to  the cheeky skipping rope act and the acrobates in Banquine, the acts are  performed to the music beat for beat. I very often wonder whether the acts  are choreographed to the music, or the music is composed to fit in with the  acts. Or maybe a combination of the two perhaps? Anyway, no matter how it  was done, it's just pure magic.<br />I really haven't got a bone to pick about  Quidam even after having watched it about twenty times. I guess this is one  advantage of owning the video, you can watch it over and over and over  again...
B00000JQFL|5.0|This my friends....is truly the best &quot;live&quot; production album put out during that time frame...the explosiveness of the band can be heard on each and every song.  Listening to it after seein them in concert would  give you that rush just like you had at the show.  If you are a true Earth,  Wind, and Fire fan, then you will agree that there has never been another  album put out with that kind of power.  Even though they put another  &quot;live in Tokoyo&quot; album out later on, it was good, but i don't  think it can reach the same level as &quot;Gratitude&quot;.  On that album,  each and every musician was tuned and in time with each other which gives  me (a musician) a great respect for them, and although it was produced  &quot;live&quot; for the most part, you can actually hear the same notes  played part by part as you would if you were listening to the original  cuts.....they have proven themselves time and time again as musicians you  can look up to....their music is sometimes imitated but it could never be  duplicated....kudos to the &quot;fire&quot;....they are and will always be  the &quot;greatest band ever put together period&quot;...and i have no  problem telling others this..end of discussion
B000002UYZ|4.0|Ah, the &quot;Red&quot; album. Hear the Beatles in all of their pop glory before the seeds of discontent (and lots of really bad mind altering drugs) turned them into Lords of Acid.This album is a blistering testement to  powerpop at its best. All the hits are here. You can't throw a stone at  this album without bouncing a rock off the melon of John,Paul,George or  even (eech) Ringo singing one of their fab hits.This record has sold so  many copies, it'll keep Ringo in nasal decongestives for life! A must have  for fans.
B00000DR5I|5.0|25 years since I first heard it, Tangerine Dream's \\"Rubycon\\" still has the power to send shivers down my spine!  Their second album for Virgin records, and consisting of just a single 35-minute work  (split in the middle for the  old vinyl  side-change, of course) this is perhaps the most symphonic of Tangerine  Dream's works. It is certainly,  even now, the most  beautiful and the most elegantly structured, as well as the most mystical,  with its soaring,  contemplative mellotron choirs,  lush tam-tam rolls and hypnotic pulse-laden textures.<br />(For a full review  of this disc, see its entry on the amazon.co.uk site.)
B000002UZ1|5.0|The &quot;Blue&quot; album (1967-1970) picks up where the &quot;Red&quot; album (1962-1966) leaves off (ain't that funkin' amazing!) and we find the Fabs out of their powerpop faze and well into their drug induced  experimental stage. This record has all the classics from  &quot;Pepper&quot; right thru to &quot;Let It Be&quot; (which was accually  originally titled &quot;Let It Be Over&quot;...John's suggestion I  think)This album is the perfect companion piece to the 1962-1966  &quot;Red&quot; album (duh!) and is a true testiment to what a little  indulgence and a lot of drugs can do. (DISCLAIMER: BIG, BAD, BOB DOES NOT  CONDONE DRUG USE....EXCEPT FOR THE BEATLES)
B00000DR5D|5.0|By 1975, when this album was recorded, Tangerine Dream had equipped themselves with an impressive array of (largely) custom kit, making them capable of producing sounds  that no-one else at  the time could come even close to emulating. Almost 25 years down the road,  the music  obviously isn't such a novelty any more,  but it remains every bit as vibrant-and unique-as it ever was. And this  album shows just how comfortable-and brilliant-these  three guys were when working together in front of an audience.  The music-making here appears to be so effortless and is truly  captivating, even now. Bw warned, though, that this disc is only 38 minutes  long!<br />(For a full review of this disc, see its entry on the amazon.co.uk  site.)
B000002UB3|4.0|Though this album was released before the Beatles swan song &quot;Let It Be&quot;, it was accually recorded after the Let It Be sessions, and is accually the Beatles last album. Who cares you ask? Well, you better, you  moron! How'd ya like it if I jumped outta your fancy computer monitor and  punched ya in your fool head!Sorry....ol' Bobs med ran out the other  day....GET THESE SPIDERS OUTTA MY HEAD...NUMBER NINE,NUMBER NINE,NUMBER  NINE......buck buck buck, I'm a CHICKEN,I'M A CHICKEN. Sorry. Anyho, Buy  Abbey Road. It's a classic. Some say it's better than Sqt. Pepper. Me and  the rest of us chickens disagree but it's a must have.
B00000JCOV|1.0|i will stick with the old HARDCORE slipknot.the  band that was on REVELATION RECORDS. this cd just didn't do a thing for me.
B000002UAX|4.0|What a great album! Highpoints: &quot;Sexy Sadie&quot;,&quot;Happiness is a Warm Gun&quot; and &quot;Piggies&quot;. Low point: this album drove Charles Manson (Marilyn Mansons dad, I think) to multiple homicide!Again, a  great album and a must have!Unless of course you're pre-disposed to  multiple homicide...you probobly should leave this one alone . Forget about  those Marilyn Manson albums also.
B00003XB8K|4.0|This is a great CD!  The intro is the best of the four albums, very dramatic.  Modern Crusader is the best song on the album. The only reason I gave it 4 stars, instead of 5, is because I was looking foward to more  Gregorian Chant. This is definatly going to be one of the more listened to  CDs in my collection.
B000002UAI|3.0|This late 1964 release finds the Beatle rather war weary after a year of touring. The album consists primarily of their old nightclub act.It may not be their best, but hey, lets face it... these guys could pass gass for 48  minutes on an album and it would be better that 97% of the music out today.
B000002UAO|5.0|The left (Commies) twisted their later work into a manifesto for free sex/drugs/health care/peace. (Idiots.) The right reacted to their early work because of the pop phenomenon they created. (A bit much, but  understandable.) Rubber Soul is, therefore, the perfect album for those who  declare themselves &quot;independent.&quot;  Not in a political sense,  either...the truth is, the vast majority of baby boomers who listened to  this album were taken by the melodies and harmonies.  Which was always the  true hallmark of the Fabs.  Even today...look at the musical notes that  comprise the duet John and Paul sing on &quot;I'm Looking Through  You.&quot;  NOBODY tries that, even today, because they know that the  voices drive it...and say what you will -- Lennon and McCartney could  really, really sing together.  This is one of my 10 Desert Island Discs,  without a doubt.  Name a song on this album that's less than hummable?
0684874350|5.0|Mr. McCourts story is astonishing and powerful. The honesty in his voice draws you in and the his tale won't let you go. This is a story that will stay with me always; the images are forever ingrained in my mind. I suggest  everyone read it and learn from it. Angela's Ashes will walk you through  life in anothers shoes.
6304071906|2.0|Michael Cimino's &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot; and &quot;Thunderbolt and Lightfoot&quot; were both very great films, both succeeded in getting their point across. Unforunatelly, &quot;Heaven's Gate&quot; had no point to get  across in the first place! The scenery? Beautiful! The cinematography?  Beautiful! The characters? Hollow! The Plot? What plot? Cimino fell off the  bandwagon. The ending was terrible too, that is for anyone who knew  anything about the actual incident. In history: around two people were  killed. In hollywood: It was a hell of a lot more than 2 people. The Deer  Hunter is one of my favorite films, Cimino had talent when it came to that,  but I don't know what he was thinking when he did this. I just have to  speak for any Cimino fans that think this film will be a great, step back  and keep that great appreciation you have for Cimino because this could  destroy it! (I myself had to go back and watch &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;  quite a few times to get the appreciation back)

B000002UJQ|5.0|Thom Yorke sounds sick. Sick of the society we live in that is. A bleak, unpromising society so full of technology, mass transportation, pollution, and anxiety that there is little room for anything else, At least this is  the picture Radiohead present to us with their third album, &quot;OK  Computer&quot;.<br />Listening to &quot;Paranoid Android&quot; we get a  disturbing sense of what it is like to live in this nightmare world.  Recorded in three parts this track is a perfect showcase for the album's  complex and multi-layered sound.<br />In &quot;Let Down&quot; everyday  existence is reduced to its most banal form: 'Starting and then  stopping/Taking off and landing/The emptiest of feelings'. Things don't  seem to get any better by the time we get to &quot;No Surprises&quot; as  Yorke sings of 'A job that slowly kills you', and of 'Bruises that won't  heal'. &quot;Exit Music&quot;, one of the album's slower tracks is an  exquisite, moving tale of young love and freedom.<br />&quot;OK Computer&quot;  is more about escape than about resignation. It is about finding a place to  belong, preferably away from the technological nightmare that surrounds us.  In &quot;Subterranean Homesick Alien&quot; Yorke hopes that aliens will:  'Take me on board their beautiful ship, show me the world as I'd love to  see it.'<br />Dark, brooding, and constantly full of surprises, &quot;OK  Computer&quot; is a tense record that pushes rock music's boundaries in all  directions. The sound of the future is here and Radiohead have kindly  captured it in all its unpleasantness for us. Thank you Radiohead.
B000006045|5.0|I listened to this album once when I first bought it, liked the song with Fraser vocals in it, but was overall put off by the album - I then shelved the CD for over a year.  I pulled it back out and started listening again  at work (where I'm distracted by other tasks and less likely to yank the CD  if it doesn't please me right away) and now I can't stop listening.  This  music has grown on me to the point where I've shelved the Tricky,  Portishead, and Morcheeba to just listen to this exclusively (ok, it hasn't  displaced the AIR CD yet.)  An amazing album (er, CD) when you give it a  good listen.  If it gets even a hiccup from a scratch I'm buying a new one  instantly.
6303972810|5.0|Willow mesmerizes!  This beautiful film is a delight for the whole family; my three nelwyns loved it.  I highly recommend a re-issue of this film...rarely does one partake in such a visual feast!  Willow is far more  ambitious than other favorites in this genre;  if you enjoyed films like  Legend, Labyrinth, or Dark Crystal..this is a must see!
B00000J7J4|4.0|I've been a Santana fan since the Woodstock album and Evil Ways. I didn't like this too much at first. But just lately, I've taken a real shine to it. It's not often that Santana's music has had to grow on me but that's  the case here. Even Santana's guitar playing sounds better the more I  listen to it.<br />I was just content before to be happy that Santana has  found big-time success again - even if I wasn't happy with this CD. Now I'm  happy for me too.
B00000JY1X|5.0|There is no genre in his music, like the author Clive Barker creates worlds without frontiers, Merritt creates his music as love would have him do.  He is powerless at times to his romantic view of timeless and  fictional (maybe some a little personal) relationships. The music of the  Magnetic Fields moves through boundaries, breaks down borders... it will  move you too (if you let it).  Ahh.. Love.. the eternal sea... ebbing and  flowing...
1561004847|1.0|People who order this cassette should be wary! In order to &quot;save space,&quot; the publisher, Brilliance Company, has recorded the tape twice  on each side, requiring special equipment in order to descramble it when listening to it on a Walkman-type casset player. The equipment goes under  the name of &quot;Bookcassette Adapter,&quot; and there is no indication  how to get hold of one. If you want to hear it on a standard tape deck,  make sure your deck is stereo with a balance control knob. Otherwise you  have the dubious pleasure of hearing two tracks of reading simultaneously.  Best to simply choose another version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice.&quot;
B000002HAF|5.0|I introduced myself to the Pixies when I was 17. No one I knew had the CD and I can't remember if I had heard any tracks beforehand.  To me, this album sums up the eagerness of a new indie band that blew up all over the college radio scene when it was released.  Surfer Rosa IS a must have for  your long-term collection.  Yeah, yeah.. everybody says Nirvana this and  Nirvana that.  I liked Nirvana before I heard the Pixies, but I LOVE the  Pixies. The album sounds like a roller-coaster  musical journey into the  pop music scene.  With all songs being fictional stories, you don't get  bogged down with the weight of the material.  You can hum to it, bob your  head to it, sing with it, rejoice in it's eclectic movements and shifts  from track to eclipsing track...I think most of these songs on Surfer Rosa  don't fade out at the end with the band still playing.. instead some  abruptly end, then pick up almost immediately with a new song. All at the  same time though, you feel like... happy. &quot;Riding high on the River  Euphrates&quot;...
0871137380|5.0|It has been many years since I picked up a book, began reading it and did not want to let it out of my hands or my sight.  Mark Bowden takes you to the streets of Somalia and into the hearts and minds of our elite soldiers,  the Rangers and Delta Force members, as well as into the confusion felt by  those living in a cultural civil war.  Bowden extensively deals with the  military operation and touches on the political misgivings that often place  our young hero's in harms way.  My only regret about the book was that I  finished it.  I could have continued to read this book until the day I die.
B00000JY1X|5.0|A local college radio station in Atlanta started playing 69LS by the Magnetic Fields about four months ago.  I heard &quot;I Can't Touch You Anymore&quot; first off the 3rd disc, and immediately thought of New Order  and The Cure (with a very deep baritone singer-a.k.a Stephin Merritt). The  song was so simplistic in it's beauty... &quot;Who is this guy?&quot; I had  heard &quot;All My Little Words&quot;, and that ukelele...  in a nutshell,  BUY IT. Whether you're like me and was skeptical about &quot;69&quot; songs  and giving any credence to this &quot;overachiever&quot;, as I used to call  him... I was a blasphemer. This box set, YES all 3 CD's, is a testament  that there are still poets/musicians who feel and aren't in it to make a  quick buck like so many out there today. I will be checking out more of  Stephin's work.. his ebb and flow of the tides of Love.
0767802772|5.0|Please convince the film distributor to release a soundtrack.  I rarely ever buy soundtracks, but the moment I saw this film, I rushed out to get the CD and found out it didn't exist!  Help!
0446310786|4.0|Harper Lee's &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; is a great book that ties in childhood curiousity with harsh reality. For the first half of the book the narrarator Scout and her older brother Jem surround their lives with  the mysterious Boo Radley. Boo is commonly known by the people of the  community as an antisocial untouchable. The kids of maycomb have never seen  Boo, so they make it their duty to seek him and introduce him to their  world. However, the trial of a crippled black man shifts the excitement  from the hibernating Boo, to the most controversial trial Maycomb has ever  witnessed. Tom Robinson a poor black man was accused of raping Mayella  Ewell who carries the poor reputation of her family. Tom becomes a victim  of the unbalanced justice scale of early twentieth century Alabama. The  trial glorifies the word of a crooked white person over the honesty of Tom  Robinson. Atticus, Jem and Scout's father, who is constantly trying to set  a good example for his children, is infuriated with the decision. This  trial deeply effects the kids' lives by introducing the horror of an  unequal society at a young age. As the book comes to a close an awkward  situation ties both parts of the story together. This book is a classic for  its insight on children and its social commentary.
6304698798|4.0|Wiley ol' Clint never loses! A fun movie to watch. You can't help but feel sorry for (Ugly) Tuco when he has a fight with his brother and lies to Blondie about it. Here's what my wife and I had fun doing with this DVD: go  to the famous bridge-blowing scene and watch in slow motion. You can see  lots of debris hitting the camera and the actors- one large piece hits a  sandbag next to Clint (or stunt double) that would surely have been fatal  if taken in the head. Whew, I suspect this was a little more  &quot;real&quot; than planned. Not my favorite Clint Eastwood western, but  a classic nonetheless.
B000031WD9|5.0|AMERICAN PIE IS THE EPITOME OF THE LIVES OF FOUR YOUNG MEN TRYING FOR THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE OF LOSING THEIR VIRGINITIES.WITH THEM ALL GOING TO EXTREME ENDS IN TRYING TO GET TO THEIR END GOAL, IT IS AN EXTREMELY  HALARIOUS JOURNEY.SIT BACK RELAX BOYS AND REMEMBER THE GOOD OLD DAYS.FOR  THE GALS NOW WE KNOW WHAT IT LIKE GROWING UP A BOY ,TRYING TO BECOME A MAN
6304696566|4.0|I don't know why the Frenchman was so critical of this DVD. The movie is, after all, 44 years old. The picture is awesome (when compared to anything on VHS) and the scenery is unequaled in any movie. I prefer Clint Eastwood  in my westerns, but still consider myself enough of a Duke fan to recommend  you put this one on your short list of westerns.
0679746048|5.0|SO SO SO great!   The book is so wonderful, the movie wasn't nearly as good as the book, and I thought the movie was so great!   It was so moving, so touching and I learned so much from her experience.  It reminded me a  lot of myself, even though I have never been commited to a mental  institution, I saw myself in Susanna.  SUCH A GREAT BOOK!
0767836286|4.0|Every once in a while there's a flick that'll defy the &quot;laws&quot; of Hollywood, and this is one of them. I won't make the reference as to what, you'll just have to see for yourself. This frighteningly real movie is  enough to make the talkers in the theater shut up and listen for a change.  Tim Robbins character, with those deceivingly innocent-boyish looks and  grins is simply a modern-day monster planning a hell of a devilish scheme.  From the moment this film begins, with the youngster in the middle of a  nice neighborhood road, you'll wonder if Jeff Bridges is simply dreaming.  One wishes it was all dream. Excellent twists, damn good writing, and very  well directed. Intense, crafty, and supenseful, you'll never look at your  newly moved-in next door neighbors the same way again.
B000000OSO|5.0|When  I was in USA I saw this album it is an great album it have the best song &quot;CRAZY&quot; and this what I can say about this nice album......thanx
0684867621|2.0|I didn't really like this book. King uses his same old mastery of mental pictures to make the book vivid... but in my opinion, it really wasn't a very good story to begin with.
0440133688|5.0|To the lay-readers who find the book's images and points of view both horrifying and repulsive, I would say only this:  As a street paramedic I fully empathize with any experienced doctor, nurse, P.A., or other medical  practitioner, who happens to be a little &quot;crispy around the  edges.&quot;  Medicine at any level of practice is often a mental  beat-down, frequently unrewarding, and always tough.  The  &quot;gallows-humor&quot; that HOG depicts so graphically is a  defense-mechanism for a lot of health-care workers.  Myself included.  You  either succumb to its temptation, or you burn out.  And in that case,  you're no good to anyone, least of all your patients.  If you read the book  from a perspective outside the medical profession, please keep an open mind  and you will love the book as much as we who are &quot;in the know&quot;  do.  And if that doesn't work, you could always try walking a mile in our  shoes...
B000002GFU|5.0|You've probably heard the songs &quot;Hard Headed Woman,&quot; &quot;Wild World&quot; and &quot;Father and Son&quot; and if you like these songs, be prepared for even more inside this awesome CD.  Cat Steven's music is  best-defined as folk music, but Yusuf (that's his name now) has a gift for  creating much deeper emotions from his music.  I thought maybe it was just  me, but I know a lot of other people who feel deeply moved by his works.   Although it has been a while, I remember listening to Cat Stevens  underwater onboard a dreary U.S. Navy submarine. It was the only thing that  kept me sane.  Although two other Cat Stevens CDs (Teaser and the Firecat  and Footsteps in the Dark) are about as good as &quot;Tea for the  Tillerman,&quot; this CD stands out as my favorite.  If you come to love  Cat Stevens as much as I do, I highly recommend watching &quot;Harold and  Maude,&quot; a perfect blend of Cat Stevens music to a great movie.<br />To  differentiate the truly great CDs, I have only given 15 CDs a 5-star  rating.  Click on my name above to see them.  Maybe your musical taste is  similar to mine and I can lead you to other awesome music.
B000031XCR|2.0|The song, &quot;All the Way&quot; sounds like Celine just recorded herself singing along to a Frank Sinatra song.  What a travesty!  I know Frank recorded some awful duets on his &quot;Duets&quot; album while he was still  alive, but does his memory have to be trampled on by stunts like this now  that he's gone too?  Celine, please take that time off you've been  promising to do...and don't rush back!
6302968119|3.0|Alright, this is a good movie.  It's not the best of its kind, but it is entertaining and has some great scenes (you can read the other reviews to see what I'm talking about).  But what I liked best about the movie was the  various bones it throws to film buffs!  Clarence (Slater's character), is  truly an action film buff!  The film has Patricia Arquette watching the  amazing final scene of &quot;A Better Tomorrow 2&quot;!  And Clarence is a  big fan of the &quot;Street Fighter&quot; series!  See how many movies you  can identify in this movie!  I actually liked this aspect of the flick the  best!
B000001Y42|1.0|Having a brain isn't one of the requirements for listening to Limp Bizkit.  They can't even spell &quot;biscuit&quot; right.  I guess they make ignorance trendy?  Moral Decay should be the name of this album.  With such  trax as &quot;Nookie&quot;, the future of rock and roll is evidently a  wasteland of smut.  &quot;I did it all for the Nookie&quot;.  Read that  quote again and notice how lame it looks written.  If u were to write all  of Limp Biscuits lyrics on paper, it would look a deranged ignaramus wrote  them.  &quot;He did it all for the Nookie&quot;......Axl Rose?  Kill Fred  Durst.  Please get some real rock and roll on tha table!  In five years,  Fred Durst, Eminem and Kid Rock will all be balding white men.  Thank  goodness, the world will be rid of such complete garbage as this.   Hopefully we won't have to wait that long though.  This album is rank.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I just received the CD today from Amazon.com and I have already listened to it three times!  It is great, but then I think everything Enigma releases is great. This CD is true Enigma!  I highly recommend buying it,  especially if you are a die hard Enigma fan, as myself.
0684872153|5.0|This is a great book about a man who escaped brutal poverty. Irish folks need to chill out though. No one said all Irish people are like the ones in this book. No need to get all mad about it.
B000009ED0|5.0|I absolutely loved this CD!  I would not recommend it for really young people though.  My favorites are &quot;Fist of Rage,&quot;  &quot;I am the Bullgod,&quot;  &quot;Only God Knows Why,&quot; &quot;Wasting Time,&quot;  and &quot;I Got One For Ya.&quot;  Of course, I still love the singles that  were realeased too, but those can get old.

0875428940|1.0|A previous reviewer felt that some detractors of this deck are put off by its pagan perspective.  I don't believe that is the case for most of us; in fact it is the watered-down quality that irritates so much.  You feel that  the wiccan beliefs, or the tarot, are not being portrayed with mature power  and passion.  The images are a cross between the Sunday comics section  (Prince Valiant-type heroes and busty beauties) and a Jehovah's Witness  leaflet, with joy and wholesome love glistening in every eye. The people  are relentlessly white and blonde. It is a very unsophisticated palette,  but apparantly it appeals to many.  For me, there are vast, uncharted  existential realms that are not even touched upon by these images, and I  find the art shallow and annoyingly hard to take.  I couldn't even handle  the book that uses this deck for illustrations, even though it is  supposedly a fine work on the tarot.  To each his own...

0062502182|5.0|I first picked up this book seven years ago, and its message still has an impact on my everyday life. Those who are unfamiliar with Coelho's work should really choose this as a stepping stone.  This story is written in a  very simplistic manner, however don't let that fool you into believing that  this is a &quot;children's&quot; novel. The metaphors and themes are very  well thought-out in expressing fate, life, and one's journey to fulfilling  a dream. This is a very spiritual/inspirational piece of work. The section  of the novel that impacted me the most is the concept that every little  coincidental experience, within one's life,  leads and guides us to our  true destiny.
055321277X|4.0|Jekyll and Hyde is a mind twisting suspense thriller.  Throughout almost every moment of the book I was waiting to see what happened next.  Although the book is very exciting it can also be hard to read at times.  The book  was written by Robert Louis Stevenson in 1886.  Some of the language is  written in a proper old english style.  Some people might read this book  because it is short.  The truth is that sometimes it takes a while to  finish because of the difficult context.  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde is about  a kind and friendly doctor named Henry Jekyll.  He concocts some sort of  potion which he tests on himself.  Something horrible has happened.  He is  Henry Jekyll by day, of course, but by night he transforms into the  malevolent Mr. Hyde.  Mr. Hyde is a bent-over, repulsive looking man.  He  represents Jekyll's evil side which Jekyll cannot control.  At night Hyde  kills numerous amounts of people and is never caught.  Everyone is puzzled  as to why Hyde suddenly dissappears without a trace.  At the same time  Jekyll sits in his labratory all day trying to figure out a way to stop  this transformation from occuring.  He is always at war with his other  self.  he is no longer the friendly doctor everyone has come to know and  love.  He no longer enjoys hiss life and he will not speak with anybody.   Jekyll's good friend Mr. Utterson is confused about the doctors strange  behavior lately.  He tries to see Jekyll, but he will not let anybody  inside.  He and the doctor's butler, Poole, are starting to get frightened  by what they come to see.  If you want to know what happenss to Dr. Jekyll  read this book!

B000002I2I|4.0|The Doors cranked out a collection of honkey-tonk and bluesy barroom songs in 1970 that rank among the band's finest ever. Divided by two sided -- Hard Rock Cafe and Morrisson Hotel -- the mood is usually upbeat, while rambling poetry more or less takes a back seat to fairly straightforward lyrics. From the get-go, \\"Roadhouse Blues\\" is a good-time Doors tune, full of festivity and lusty inclinations. \\"Waiting for the Sun\\" has a lonely mysteriousness to it, which sums up many of the Doors great songs. Ray Manzarek's lively piano work stands out on \\"You Make Me  Real,\\" a lively stomp, as well as \\"Peace Frog,\\" an instantly and shamelessly catchy sing-along. \\"Blue Sunday\\" is a tranquil, slowed-down piece (the first of the album), and highlights Morrisson's rich baritone nicely. The two best songs on \\"Morrison Hotel\\" arrive halfway through in the form of \\"Ship of Fools\\" and \\"Land-Ho!,\\" two upbeat songs that must have been fantastic when played live by The Doors. Morrisson's voice sounds seductive on both \\"Queen  of the Highway\\" and \\"Indian Summer,\\" a tune written for his longtime girlfriend, Pam, and played to great effect in [[ASIN:B000IHY9UW The Doors (15-Year Anniversary Edition)]] movie from 1991. \\"Maggie M'Gill\\" ends the album on a  honkey-tonk vibe, closing out an album known for its beefed-up sound and  classic-rock mettle. A definite must-have for Doors fans.
6303674984|4.0|Having read most of the reviews on this movie I was a little surprised to read the dissapointment of some, regarding particular historical content or interpretation (or lack thereof of both)in this movie.  However what I did  find most encouraging was the interest this movie has re-kindled in  American history and for all americans should be compulsory viewing.<br />This  movie is tremendous entertainment with most (not all) the main characters  represented and told as faithfully as possible within the restrictions of  &quot;movie making&quot;.  It could never (and should never)be interpreted  as documentary or narrative in style and criticism of inclusion or  exclusion of units, commanders or areas of the battlefield is unfair.<br />It  does not dwell on the political reasons for the conflict (although they are  touched on) rather it's emphasis is on humanising the conflict through  portrayal of the characters on both sides as &quot;real&quot; people  complete with emotional frailties during this bloodiest of battles on  American soil.    <br />The cast perform well and one can't help admiring the  soldierly conduct of the men they are representing from both sides.  Jeff  Daniels cry &quot;Bayonets!&quot; had the look and sound of the resolve and  desperation that must surely have been working on Chamberlains mind in 1863  on Little Round Top.  For me too the tears of Pickett after the charge are  as real, the sense of despair and loss becomes a tangible thing.  Simply  wonderful..<br />I enjoy it each time I see it and highly recommend it to war  movie buffs, American History teachers and their students.<br />(Also of value  are the vignettes recreating some of the better known civil war art of  period (such as death of Gen.Reynolds).
B000001E21|4.0|Though Def Leppard missed the mark by a wide range with the abysmal [[ASIN:B000001DV2 Adrenalize]] from 1992, the band bounced back  impressively with a collection of &#34;odds 'n' sods&#34; B-side tunes that were either totally revamped or unfinished and completed for this album. Leppard seemed to effortlessly and quietly release this batch of songs in 1993, and the result was another classic record by the band.<br /><br />The spectacular leadoff track, &#34;Desert Song,&#34; is in a class by itself, darkly toned and written during the [[ASIN:B000001FKY Hysteria]] sessions yet nothing like the songs on that album. Whenever these guys release a new album fans always wonder if it will sound like their old stuff. Well, &#34;Retro Active&#34; has several songs that DO sound like vintage &#34;[[ASIN:B000001F2V Pyromania]]&#34;-era Leppard. &#34;Fractured Love,&#34; &#34;She's Too Tough,&#34; &#34;Ring of Fire,&#34; and &#34;I Wanna be Your Hero&#34; feature Joe Elliott at his screaming best; dark, moody, and shadowy vibes; and tuneful, larger-than-life choruses that are classic and rocking Def Leppard.<br /><br />Likely trying to shake free of its gimmicky &#34;let's get rocked&#34; vibe from &#34;Adrenalize,&#34; the improved Def Leppard sobered up its vision and began to experiment. Prior to this record, Elliott was never heard crooning in his gruff voice on acoustic-only tracks. On &#34;Retro Active&#34; he does just that on a few well-written, heartfelt ballads played in a few different ways on separate tracks. The CD also features two lively covers, Sweet's &#34;Action&#34; and Mick Ronson's &#34;Only After Dark.&#34; &#34;Ride Into the Sun,&#34; the first song by Leppard ever put to vinyl, firmly displays the band's heavy roots, as does &#34;Ring of Fire.&#34; A real musical digression occurs on the quirky and frightening Irish-sounding jig &#34;From the Inside,&#34; where heroin plays the lead character. Def Leppard is often at the top of its game when writing and playing a more despairing brand of songs; &#34;From the Inside&#34; is a great example of that.<br /><br />Overall, &#34;Retro Active&#34; has a spunky mix of varied tunes. It's a genuine release by a band that thankfully attempted to reach out for broader horizons with an ever-changing, stepped-up sound.despairing brand of songs; &#34;From the Inside&#34; is a great example of that.

B000000FG8|5.0|Operation Ivy's c.d is wonderful. I picked it up after hearing my friend's brother's album. It was marvelous. Political and social are words you can use to describe the lyrics. The sound on the album is very original. So,  all I can say is get this c.d to realise the issues of the early nineties.
B000001FKY|5.0|Back in 1987, Kurt Loder, then a reviewer for Rolling Stone magazine, wrote that every track on \\"Hysteria\\" \\"sparkles and burns.\\" He went on to say that \\"Hysteria\\" sounds \\"terrific,\\" and was well worth the wait. How right he was. It's a little hard to believe now, but Def Leppard was once a very relevant and sought after band. Though the Leps fell deep into obscurity by the mid-1980s, much of what the band did musically was waited on in breathless anticipation, once everyone got his act together.<br /><br />Loder was right on target with his assessment of this album. Mutt Lange's production does indeed conjure a sparkling effect like Loder mentioned, which upped the ante in terms of what metal music could potentially sound like. \\"Hysteria\\" is a mixture of hard metal and crafty, excellent pop. Several of the songs didn't grab me right away when I first heard the album, even songs on the hit-heavy \\"first side,\\" and in some ways, \\"Hysteria\\" still comes off as a rather odd but unique album, mostly due to the strange voices and sounds that Lange deftly mixed into some of the songs. Every tune on the first side eventually made its way into homes everywhere as singles and videos, catapulting Def Leppard into astronomical fame worldwide. The \\"second side\\" of the CD is just as good, culminating to the free-spiritied \\"Run Riot,\\" a song I wish the band would include in its live performances. Start to finish, this is an unbelievable album -- no wonder it sold so well.<br /><br />The music industry has changed drastically since 1987, but Leppard's \\"Hysteria\\" still holds a prominent place in rock 'n' roll lore. In fact, the album has more than retained its uniqueness and stands by  itself in terms of sound and production. Play it for your grandkids!
B000002UAR|3.0|The first half is great, but then it hits some definite duds.  The weird and unattractive cover art doesn't help much either.  But you simply can't pass up the wonderfully cheery &quot;Good Day Sunshine&quot; and  &quot;Yellow Submarine,&quot; or the ghostlike beauty of &quot;Here, There  and Everywhere&quot;, or the hard-edged coldness that makes &quot;Eleanor  Rigby&quot; and &quot;I'm Still Sleeping&quot; so poisonous!  Too bad the  rest of the songs pretty much stink.  Altogether &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; is  a better album but this one has better individual songs.
B000000WJ2|5.0|100% Keith Richards. Travel the wasteland, feel the riffs, and hold on tight, because this album is not for the meek. This is the best Keith Richards solo album, but it places strong demands on its listeners. Only  those who are ready for the strongest, purest Keef riffs need to buy this  album. Those who come from a weak gene-pool need not apply.
B000002UAO|5.0|This was the thankful beginning of new, more thoughtful group.

B000002LCU|4.0|I found this CD on a used rack. By luck I guess, seeing how it's out of print now. It's a good album, with mostly acoustic songs. My faves are &quot;That's What It Takes,&quot; &quot;Devil's Radio,&quot; &quot;Fish On  The Sand,&quot; (cool riff!) &quot;When We Was Fab,&quot; and &quot;Wreck  Of The Hesperus.&quot; &quot;Cloud Nine&quot; and &quot;This Is Love&quot;  are okay. &quot;Got My Mind Set On You&quot; is pretty repetitive. Overall,  this is enjoyable, but hard to find now.
B000002UAF|3.0|Let's face the music (no pun intended): the early Beatles sucked.  All of their songs sound the same and they are irritatingly repetitive.  But what can I say, I still love them!

B000002UYZ|5.0|First of all, The Beatles rock, and therefore, anything by them is awesome.  I love this cd.  i just got it yesterday and it's just powerpacked with feel good music.  I prefer the later Beatles, just because  the music is more rock and roll, and totally awesome.  I laughed when i  read that some people were mad because it was a double album, and it didn't  have to be.  I laughed because i have many Led Zeppelin cds and one in  particular, The Song Remains the Same, has 2 cds and 9 songs total.  so  don't complain.  I reccomend this to any level of fans, beginners or older  fans.

0792140923|5.0|If you try to analyze the movie Forrest Gump,(is it a drama?  is it a comedy?  Is a statement about history, mental retardation, what?), it's almost impossible to do!  It's best to just sit back and let yourself be  entertained by this unique, wonderfully moving, yet at the same time,  incredibly funny film!  Tom Hanks plays his part so well, you really do  believe he IS Forrest, Forrest Gump.  As a matter of fact,it's really hard  to imagine ANY ONE else playing that role!  The visuals in this movie are  fantastic, as is the supporting cast; (Sally Field and Gary Sinise, just to  name a few).  Mixed in with in an interesting journey through the events  that make up Baby-Boomer generation history, Forrest Gump is a movie about  friendship, love,and loyalty.  But most importantly, it is a movie about a  man who, though mildly retarded, has a heart of gold and who manages to  make a huge impact on everyone around him - including anyone who watches  the film!  And now, in the words of Forrest Gump,himself, &quot;that's all  I have to say about that!&quot;
B00000J7J7|5.0|Finally there's a piano solo album in my collection that can match Keith Jarret's `Facing You' (1971). It's Brad Mehldau's `Eligiac Cycle'. Haven't heard such a great piano solo album in years. `Eligiac Cycle' -released in  1999- was a revelation to me. This guy's playing takes your breath away. On  `Elegiac Cycle' Mehldau plays improvisations inspired by the theme of  `loss'. His playing is daring and adventurous, and because he has a perfect  sense of structure as well, he never gets lost and keeps everything in  perfect balance. And on top of this, his playing is deeply moving. In  Mehldau's playing we can discern a lot of influences from the realms of  classical and jazz music. I hear a lot of Bill Evans and Keith Jarrett,  but, much more important, I hear foremost a pianist with a distinct style  of his own. His classical training seems to contribute to this distinctness  of his playing. On `Elegiac Cycle' I hear the influence of Bach's  contrapunt, especially in `Memory Tricks'. I hear a bit of Debussy in  `Rückblick', and each and every time it's a big sensation to hear the  opening and ending-segment of `Trailer Park Ghost', which sounds in my ears  as the perfect blending of the enraged energy of Schubert's `Der Strom' and  the odd-mystical melodic intervals in the middle section of Scriabin's  piano-piece `Poème vers la flamme'. Brad Mehldau's `Elegiac Cycle' is my  favourite album of 1999, and most certainly one of my all time favourite  albums. It's a masterpiece, and nobody with a serious interest in good and  enriching contemporary piano music can afford to miss this album. <br />Pieter  de Rooij. Amsterdam, january 22nd - 2000.
B000002U82|5.0|I recently had the pleasure,quite by accident,to have watched a replay of PULSE-Pink Floyd in Concert,where the entire Dark Side of the Moon epic was played in concert.Some things like the sun coming up in the morning,are a  constant in this universe and as familiar as your family is to you,so is  the excellence of this Alan Parson engineered epic in sound and imagery  ,.audio though it may be.Smack bang in the middle of the glam rock era when  substance lasted as long as the next fad,out pops this timeless gem.From  the opening strains to the last haunting sound effect this recording  deserves to be right up there in the top ten of any poll.I personally  believe that since first hearing it in 1973, the title track is still my  favourite,but as it is really a total piece, to divide it up track by track  is a futile exercise.Never has a concept album come together so completely  and with such imagery and imagination.  Either click it in or insert it in  the deck  late at night, turn off the lights, whack on the headphones and  escape into the world of the Floyd.They never quite captured the same  again,it is a magical experience.

B00000DGUG|5.0|When i bought this album, i bought along with it The Globe Sessions by Sheryl Crow. These two artists, Alanis the Queen of 'Alternative Rock' and Sheryl the 'greatest female rock'n'roll artist of our time' as well as the  'greatest live act for our era', both stripped themselves to their core and  gave their all, and having both these albums focusing on examination of  self, i probably had an easier time of getting to know and love both albums  than other teenyboppers who only liked Alanis for her angst and Sheryl for  her sort-of pop. but enough of sheryl, this review's about alanis.  I  pretty much loved every track on this album. Supposed Former Infatuation  Junkie is proof that lyris can make a song, even though the music is superb  anyway. Having 17 tracks (18 for us aussies who also got a very kewl demo  version of 'Uninvited' included) meant that there was plenty of room for  diversity. Although musically this album is quite different to Jagged  Little Pill, it has its similarities, and lyrically is simply a toned-down  version of Pill. Of course it is impossible almost to repeat a 30-million  sale record, and the fan base can't be kept in mind forever.  This is a  growth for Alanis, who had grown first from the teenybopper that made  'Alanis' to the angry young woman in Pill to the 'at-peace' artist who  created Supposed. When u grow as an artist, u tend to lose the genre-based  fans. No wonder all the 13 and 14 year bopper girls from california and  miami can't stand Supposed. and i'm glad that i don't have to share the  title of 'alanis fan' with them much longer. Songs like Front-Row (which i  listened to over and over for a time, always finding something more to like  in this complex and brilliant track) would not be possible if alanis tried  to keep her angst and hence wide fan base. i personally think that Supposed  can be related to by just as many, if not more, humans, if they bother to  take a geezer at the lyrics. Without further comparison to Pill, Supposed  is a brilliant album, with something for everyone, but think every song is  great. the album is rich with meaning, and talks to me powerfully, even  though alanis, methinks, wrote this for herself. my favourites atm are  probably Front Row, Joining You, Baba, and Thank U. get this album now, and  also get her MTV Unplugged album.
B000002LEE|5.0|I felt compelled to write this review after reading the one by the last fellow who said he would rather listen to &quot;fingernails on a chalkboard&quot; than listen to Nothing's Shocking.  I certainly don't  disagree with him; Jane's Addiction is not and will never be for everybody,  but I just wanted to offer some contrasting insight into this record for  those who might seek the benefit of another opinion.<br />Nothing's Shocking  came into my life in 1992, a year after the band broke up.  I was 17.  Up  until that point, I had never heard a band so successfully meld influences  from so many different genres into such an instantly recognizable sound.   From the lush, narcotic soundscapes of &quot;Up the Beach&quot;, to the  grandeur of &quot;Ocean Size&quot;, to the earth-rattling tribalism of  &quot;Mountain Song&quot;, this album draws from all walks of life without  a hint of judgment, all the while steeped in mystique.  This is the album's  best quality; it asks more questions than it answers, constantly  juxtaposing seemingly unrelated themes in an effort to make the listener  question his or her own ideas.  Mystical romances coincide with hedonistic  impulses.  Sexual ambiguity looms about, lending a constant sense of  confusion to the lyrical motives.  Dreams, thoughts, drug addiction, and  biographical accounts of serial killers, are discussed with equal  attention.<br />Musically, this album is about as innovative as it gets.   Guitarist Dave Navarro borrows equally from American hard rock and English  shoe-gazer psychedelia; underneath, bassist Eric Avery provides a sensual,  melodic throb; drummer Stephen Perkins simply has no equal.<br />And yes,  Perry Farrell can't sing.  He has even admitted this onstage.  But without  his voice, this band and the countless others that followed would never  exist.  He is without question the defining member, a psycho-sexual banshee  whose vision provided the basis for so much greatness.  His inimitable  croon is absolutely mesmerizing, belting forth some of the most brilliant  lines in rock's most instantly recognizable voice.  It's all there for  those who are willing and able to understand.<br />Although I have moved past  this phase in my life, I still remember Nothing's Shocking as the album  that, for me, made it all possible.  All young, open-minded people who  appreciate intelligent music owe it to themselves to give this album a  chance.  It is not for everyone.  But if it is for you, you will never  forget it.

There  are many great songs on this album, but the are quite a few that aren't so  great also.  Also this album doesn't have as great of a flow as Dark Side  of the Moon.  For new fans I'd recommend the more accesible Dark Side of  the Moon first.

Instead of assigned, 12 year old Jonas is &quot;selected&quot;. This means  he is givven the job of the Receiver. He receives memories of color, war,  animals, and love. Jonas is determined to share these things with the  community, but how? Jonas and the Giver, the only other person in the  community who can see color, hear music, and who gives Jonas the memories,  devise a plan which could save or destroy the community. The Giver is a  really great book, but I only recommend it for kids 11 years old and up,  because it's really upsetting at times. All in all, a terrific book.
B0000060NH|5.0|this disc is a classic and is very underrated.the textures that combine Soul&amp;Jazz are incredible.this disc has so much going for it.a very strong concept.for me as brillant as What's going on.the power in his voice  for Trouble Man and the rich arrangements have Genius all over it.a must  have essential.
0805017445|5.0|Our son got this book before he was 6 months old. It was by far his favorite and he loved it when we made all the noises of the animals as we read it to him.  Now he is anxious to share the book with his baby brother.  We also add this book to the baby gifts we give to our friends who are new  parents!  (Polar Bear, Polar Bear is a good book also, but Brown Bear will  always be his favorite toddler book.)
B000002KXV|5.0|where do i start? the genius of Fagen&amp;Becker is well done on this great disc.I.G.Y,Green flower street,new frontier,ruby baby the title cut with the great Val Simpson from the dynamic duo Ashford&amp;Simpson.the  vocals,words,music have a strong soulful feel all over them.Donald Fagen  created a master piece with this release.
B000002B5L|5.0|This cd is great!  Not one bad song on here!  I like this cd much better than the tranzlator crew!
B000002P86|2.0|i only like the tracks with Bonnie raitt,Dr.John&amp;Willie Nelson.the problem with this disc is what was wrong with those lame Frank Sinatra discs no real chemistry.nowadays for what ever reason it's fashionable  putting many acts on one disc as opposed to sinking or swimming unto your  ownself.now B.B King needs no help he is a Legend and a musical Genius.but  this is not a great tribute for the man.the cards on this deck aren't aces.
0553269631|5.0|I am a freshman in HS, and MY dad read this book to me there years ago, I loved it at the time and i just recently read it again and got even more out of it. For all of you adults who think that teenagers are incapable of  reading this book are wrong, but all of the hs students who wrote in to  trash this book are also wrong! If you really think that it deserves 0  stars then you must not have understood it.
B00000F1D3|1.0|call this singing? sounds more like a dog getting attacked by a cat.the music is weak 3rd rate disco.how does she still have hits with such a flat voice? you have to be tone deaf to respect that so-called singing  voice.it's always been bad.she&amp;Jennifer Lopez are in the same boat.both  should stick to acting.
B00000K19E|5.0|The Wachowski Brothers did a terrific job in making a film about such a topic not usually discussed: the realness of reality. The special effects are mind boggling, including a new technique known as  &quot;Bullet-Time&quot;. Invented for the Matrix specifically by a genius  of a man by the name of Mr. Gaeta. A movie that will have you thinking all  week about the realness of your spouse, your job, your car, the food you  eat, and your friends. A must see for deep-thinkers.
B000002MIY|3.0|i always look foreward to anything associated with Steely Dan.and when Donald Fagen drop this disc i was excited.but after listening to it i came away only digging Snowbound&amp;Tomorrow's girl.the music was very steely  dan and the arrangements as well as the vocals but the feeling wasn't felt  all thru this disc. Nightfly is a better disc.still i can't wait for the  new disc by Steely Dan.
B00000D9TK|5.0|I don't speak any French but Celine's angelic voice prevents you from not liking the CD. No matter what language she sings/speaks in, it's good enough for me.<br />My favorite tracks on this album are On ne change pas and  Dans un autre monde. Both are fantastic!
B000002L99|4.0|after the 1984 album which i liked alot i heard they were gonna replace diamond Dave with Sammy Hagar.i wasn't to cool with it but after hearing this disc i changed my mind.he fit perfectly on why can't this be  love&amp;especially on dreams.the downside is that this was the last good  record by them in the Hagar era.after right now they became one big sound  bite piece.but this was good in 86 and still sounds good.Eddie is tight on  axe&amp;boards.
0440234743|5.0|I read this book in an incredible 2.5 hours. A really good read. John grisham, I observe, is becoming much more subtle in his storylines, more towards the Literature side than to Thriller and Mystery. He has a strong  command of the language and this story never fails you if you want to  improve your English. This story is not only easy-to-read, but it is  inspirational and religious at the same time. 5 stars is the least you can  give!
0385484518|4.0|A truly touching tale, life is special; dont waste it
0553278355|5.0|Although this partially auto-biographical book written by Sylvia Plath is most commonly discussed in feminist groups and psychology classes, its a book for the likes of anyone who's ever felt a bit out of touch with  reality.  Plath was an excellent poet, and an extremely good author.  The  fact that this is her only novel is quite disappointing.  This book is  easier read than almost any other I've ever picked up.  Its a better  written Catcher In The Rye.  One that doesn't so much focus on the whining  and complaining about life, but more of the spiral of feeling insane and  like an outsider. Don't get me wrong.  In no way is this a take-off of  Catcher In The Rye.  It is as unique as any book that you could get your  hands on.  That's what makes it so brilliant.  Also, I think anyone who  reads this book should try their very hardest to read Plath's poetry along  with it.  It will make you understand her world on a bit more of an  artistic level.  Basically, I can't stress enough how important this novel  is to American Literature.  Someday, this book will be in as high of regard  with the literary greats as Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre and Shakespeare's  MacBeth.
B00000AOUD|5.0|I've been listening to &quot;Thick&quot; almost every day for months, and it just keeps getting better.  It is the only rock album I've ever been tempted to call a masterpiece.  Tull is still around (albeit with a very  different lineup), but nothing they've done recently can match the raw  energy and genius of their work from the early '70s.  This album represents  the high point of that era.<br />Even if you already own an older version of  the CD, it's worth getting this new one for the bonus tracks.  The live  performance of &quot;Thick&quot; is truly inspired, although it inevitably  skips over some of the best parts of the original epic song.  The interview  at the end of the disc is full of amusing anecdotes and thick British  accents.  Plus, the liner notes contain some additional fake news articles.
B000031WYP|5.0|Mascagni's &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot; has been recorded multitudes of times over the last fifty years ---- and to my ears, this 1965 effort is the best recorded performance of all of them.  Herbert von Karajan has  fashioned a reading of this much-heard opera that makes you feel that you  are hearing it for the very first time.  Orchestral color and  &quot;verismo&quot; atmosphere abounds here as in no other &quot;Cav&quot;  recording, and there are instruments in the orchestra that seem much more  prominent than we are used to hearing in this particular opera ----- and  the orchestral crescendos are more powerful than I have ever encountered  them.  Carlo Bergonzi, perhaps not the most creative and innovative artist,  sings a Turridu with flow, beauty, and taste.  Fiorenza Cossotto -----  probably the greatest Italian mezzo since Gulietta Simionato and Fedora  Barbieri ---sings a smoldering and compelling Santuzza with a voice ideally  suited to the violent emotions of the role.  Giangiacomo Guelfi is a  vocally solid and strong Alfio.  Plainly, with von Karajan at the helm, and  with the caliber of these great artists, &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana&quot;  comes across on this recording with all of the violence and passion which  Mascagni certainly must have intended.     This one's a real winner -----  and it's companion performance of &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, also conducted by  von Karajan and starring Carlo Bergonzi as Canio  ------- is every bit as  great.Buy them both!
0684852756|5.0|Intimacy is the first book I have read three times and I still find new and interesting thoughts.  For a newly-married, young female reading it for the first time, it was horrifyingly truthful.  But on repeated readings, I  am grateful to Mr. Kureishi for putting such direct and simple words to  otherwise complex feelings.
B000001Y42|5.0|This cd is truly amazing. After buying Significant Other I had to go and buy this cd.  Boy, this one was worth every cent.  What are the best songs you ask?  THE WHOLE CD!

B0000060NA|5.0|I just purchased this masterpiece on October 15,1999 and needless to say I am just blown away by the songs on this album. I was only 10 years old when &quot;Songs&quot; came out so I am just now being aquainted with this work  of art. Everything on this CD is wonderful particularly &quot;Summer  Soft&quot; which I just heard for the first time on the day that I  purchased this CD. Of course &quot;As&quot; is a classic as well as  &quot;Knocks me off my feet&quot;. It amazes me that someone can write  music this beautiful and sing so brilliantly. I feel blessed to have the  music of Stevie Wonder  in my life.
B00000DHRZ|5.0|The songs on this CD are great!  I really loved playing it because it get's your pulse pumping.  This was the first hard rock/alternative/punk CD that I got and I got hooked.  Since then, I've bought more Offspring, Green  Day and Nirvana.  All in all, a great CD!
6305609691|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite films, so it was a great experience watching it on DVD. The picture quality was excellent for such an old film, and listening to those helicopters dominate the room was loads  of fun. A very creepy, thought provoking movie that sticks with you long  after the closing credits. A must watch for anyone who cares about movies,  especially films from the golden age of cinema, which for me are the 70's.  Filmmakers felt they had the freedom to do whatever they wanted to then,  and movies like this were the result.
B000009ED0|1.0|Gimme a break. Carson Daly may tell you this album is &quot;dope&quot; and &quot;phat&quot;, but anyone who appreciates music will not like this album. Look at me, I'm Kid Rock! I come from a trailer park, I travel  around with a midget (thats cool right?), I' a misogynistic  attention-seeker!  &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot; anyone would ever buy  this album.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|Just a great movie.  I feel this is one of Meg Ryan's best works.  If you've been to Paris and France, you'll love it.  if you haven't, you'll definitely want to go.  It captures the whole spirit of French living with  entertainment at it's best.  I re-watch it at least 8 times per year.
B000000OAN|1.0|I'm sorry, but &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; has got to rank among the stupidest songs ever.  It's pretentious, silly, and just plan makes no sense.  It has everything to do with over the top self indulgence and  nothing to do with the spirit of rock and roll.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is a great cd.  This band is explosive.  They can both be funny and serious.  Their publicity onmtv has nothing to do with their success
B000020617|4.0|I like the way the songs sound on this album with their mix of alternative, pop, and rock. STACKED ACTORS and BREAKOUT start the album off well, but most of the songs lack their own unique sound which i think would  have made it better. I like the Foo's new pop-infused sound, which shows  the most in GENERATOR and LEARN TO FLY.
6304331851|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with this movie from the very first song! Guenivere (Redgrave) is very convincing, as are Aurthur (Harris) and Lancelot. Harris is amazing as Authur. One feels all of his pain, his  hopes, his confusion. King Pellinore, Aurthers good friend, is a welcome  comady relief. My favorite line? &quot;How can you get a fair decision from  people so impartial?&quot; from Pellinore. The songs are generally very  lively, although there are a few beautiful love songs. The costumes and  scenery were amazing! (Keep an eye out for the guys with lots of dark  eyeshadow, and remember, everyone in the movie has blue eyes.) The first  time I saw this movie it climbed the list to one of my favorites. Camelot  is a true classic, a must-have for broadway lovers, a must-see for anyone  who has ever dreamed an impossible dream!
B000001ESJ|5.0|I just actually listened to &quot;different stages&quot;cd with a &quot;Xanadu&quot; and a Farewel to kings&quot; on it.It made me cherish tis album once again.I have been a Rush fan since 1982,and this is one of  their best albums.The title track begins with a melodious synthesize piece  then turns to a hard rock intro.It is absolutely brilliant.The melodious  intro holds more weight today than it did for me back in '82 when i  listened to this.I think &quot;Xanadu'&quot; is arguaby one of the 10 best  rock songs of all time(i mean all bands also)&gt;It has everything.Great  instrumental music,crankin bass guitar,melodic hard rock guitar,melodious  synthesizers and intelligent lyrics.The combination and interplay of  Geddy's bass and keyboards and Alex's guitar and neils drums and lyrics are  probably reush's best song ever and the essence of their music.In addition  &quot;cinderella man has much of the same qualites though a shorter  song,The album cover kicks but but buy this for &quot;xanadu&quot;and tell  me it it is not one of the best rock songs ever.

6302869390|5.0|I bought this album and saw the movie in 1971 when I was 11 years old. I've been in search of the video for years. The performances and musical selections are top rate.  Harrison chose his musicians well.  The  selections performed by Ravi Shankar are transcendent with their haunting  melodies and intricate rhythms.  My album may be dusty from the years but  the music is timeless.  WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE RE-RELEASE THE VIDEO?
1573226521|5.0|wow, my life was plain ,dull and unexciting, then i went and picked up a copy of the beach.   next thing i know i was standing in the muggy heat of thailand adventure awaiting me and boy did i get it!  Alex garland has  written in my eyes a deffinitive youth travel book which excites,shocks and  enthrails with every turn of the page. so im now off to book my ticket to  thailand  see you there!
B000002OX7|5.0|As Pete Townshend once pointed out, Rock & Roll is about promise. But unfortunately, it has delivered only more promises, few solutions. And the cover of 'Who's Next' just about sums it up: Wishing for change and the  promise of a better world is not enough. It is as futile as... You must DO, not just wish. Townshend wrote and Roger Daltrey passionately sings about a  'teenage wasteland', as if predicting the stereotypical GENERATION X'ers and 'EMOs' more than 20 years ahead of time. This album had its' origins in a film  script by Townshend called 'Lifehouse', about a distopic world where  pollution, crime and war makes it difficult to travel or participate in  events. So; do it all from the safety of your home with the help of  technology. Sound familiar!  And this was written in 1971... Townshend  shelved the full 'Lifehouse' concept and instead kept just the main songs  with their spirit of anger, promise and hope intact. Roger Daltrey is the  most insightful interpreter of Townshend's lyrical and musical genius, and  here his voice is at its' most powerful and resonate. Keith Moon's unique drumming underpins and accents every vocal and every intricate Jon  Entwistle bassline. And Townshend creates guitar power chord mortar for every musical brick and tile here. The end result is a solid structure that  will weather the changes of popular music to join the classical music of  this 21st Century. 'Who's Next' is, perversely, one of the most celebrated  AND underrated albums in rock history. And that means there are many who  have heard its' message and there's many more who need to. Rock on (with  brains), man!
0312853238|5.0|This book isa very entertaining novel.  The last in the series makes no sense, but I connected with this novel in a great way.  I reccommend this novel to everybody with an open mind, and an adventorous heart
6303073107|5.0|This is actually the sam eplot except seen through the eyes of four people. Here's the basic short story. A man is found dead in the forest, and his wife has been raped. That's the short story. Execept then Kurosawa  takes that story and formats it into four versions of the story. this is  the kinda thing that happens in court alot. I think it's awesome. It's one  of Japan's greatest masterpieces. It's also Kurosawa's best film. If you  like Japanese films and Kurosawa click buy now!  Oh, and about the DVD, I  think it should be released TODAY!
B000002MG1|5.0|This album is so good, whether you are a fan or not. Its soft and melodic. Buy it!
B000001EMW|1.0|Yes, it was a good idea.  No, it doesn't really work. Although at times (more poignant passages), the disc is at least okay,...at other times it's painful and falsely accuses early metal of sucking. With the release of  &quot;S&amp;M&quot;, this disc should quickly fade into a trivia question.
B000035Z2L|5.0|Okay, yes this was rather raunchy. And yes, it could be seen as offensive by some, especially those who are shy about sex, but it is also very realistic. It's been 7 years since I was a senior in high school, but I  know what people did. I know what they thought about and were curious  about. The only slight drawback is that it didn't deal with the  consequences of sex, but i think the real point is to find what is really  important in high school, friendship, love, and knowing you were happy with  what you did. This is very funny too, espeally the strip tease and the band  girl (and I was a band girl but I swear I never acted like that and I never  went to band camp!)
1573226521|5.0|If you have not read this this, where have you been.  This book is a treat to read, it is amazing.  The ultimate story of experience and wisdom.  A mans sole journey into paradise.  No money, no worries.  Heaven.  Read this  book quick!  before the film comes out.
B00003003R|4.0|Maybe it doesn't have some songs that you expect. But it is a good one if you like Guns N' Roses!
B00000J7J4|5.0|Santana was the first album I bought and have followed his music ever since.  Supernatural brings back memories of his first three albums and every song has a different hook.  It is hard for me to believe that anyone  who likes Santana's work would be disappointed in it.
B000002JSH|5.0|Straight Shooter was a great second album.  Songs like GOOD LOVIN' GONE BAD, FEEL LIKE MAKIN'LOVE, SHOOTING STAR, and WILDFIRE WOMAN sound even better on this remastered version.  Paul Rodgers is rock's best vocalist  and former Mott guitarist Mick Ralphs sound is instantly recognizable.
B000023VR6|4.0|Great record, cool to hear Dre again, and glad for it.  Some of these tracks rock, but I want to Know, WHERE THE HELL IS RBX!  RBX is the backbone of Dres whole deal, what the fxxx man?  Exibit is ok, but RBX  would have bumped the lyrical level of the record thru the roof.  After he  showed on Aftermath (eastcoast, westcoast killers) I fully expected him to  be all over this new one.  Plus, com on, the DOC was the man, he was  responsible for the Chronic's success, I know Dre gives him props, but why  didnt he appear on this record?  Oh well, RBX and DOC should hook up  with I dunno, battlecat or somebody.
B000006MV8|5.0|I wrote a review of this album under the name Matthew Lindsey and was pleased to see others found my review helpful.  I listened to this disc again today(have the vinyl version sealed in a plastic sleeve).  I will  never get tired of this album and recommend this classic to all lovers of  70's rock.  It is definitely a classic.
B000009ED0|4.0|The first four songs are all good, as well as the last three songs. The middle is a mix of good and bad songs. Best song on the CD is Devil Without a Cause, with the worst song being Only God Knows Why. 10 of the 14 songs  on the CD are good. There's a hidden track of a remix on I am the Bullgod.
0385484518|5.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is a guidebook for how to live our lives.  Anyone who has ever had a close relationship with a teacher, relative, or friend or wanted to have one, can relate to this book.  It is an easy read with  tearful, jovial, and humorous moments.  Read it now!
6305603847|5.0|This video is so creative beyond belief. Unless you've seen it already I would highly recommend to anyone who is or isn't a Pink Floyd fan. If you are not a fan, you soon will be.
B000002L1L|4.0|After the disastrous Joe Lynn Turner experiment on  &quot;Slaves And Masters&quot; Deep Purple came roaring back on &quot;The Battle Rages On.&quot;  While Joe Lynn Turner is an excellent singer, he doesn't fit the  Deep Purple style nearly as well as Ian Gillan.  On TBRO Deep Purple  returns to the style of &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; with great success.  A much harder edge prevails throughout the album, but the band sticks to  their roots, getting a bit bluesy at times (a good thing), but mainly  sticking to straight-ahead rock.  Standout tracks include &quot;Nasty Piece  of Work,&quot; the bluesy &quot;Ramshackle Man,&quot; and the blistering  title track.  Ritchie Blackmore's guitar is much more prevalent than on the  previous 2 albums, and the production is crisp and clean.  A must-have for  any Purple fan.
B000002USN|1.0|This LP should never have been released, and the fact that it was is a travesty and should be an embarrassment to all those who care about the legacy of Sinatra's music. I once saw a film clip from the 1950s of Frank  singing with Elvis, and in spite of all the differences between them, they  sounded pretty good together, as they were simply messing about and having  fun on stage; the effortlessness of their performances showed.<br />But here,  it sounds like Frank and the other singers weren't even in the same room  together; it also sounds like the singers were trying way too hard to get  it right, and couldn't forget the fact that their voices would be spliced  together with that of their musical hero. And as far as the choice of  singers go, please. I mean, Julio Iglesias? What an unworthy choice of a  duet partner; or at least, he would be, were this a set of real duets. But  it is not, it is exploitation. Everyone who participated in this travesty  should be deeply ashamed of themselves for having sold their little karaoke  moments of glory to the  gullible public.<br />In the meantime, if you are  considering buying this (or Duets II, in which poor Frank sounds very  sickly), why not do a bit of homework and buy one of Frank's many  masterpieces instead, all of which are still available.
B00002NDB1|4.0|After the commercial disaster of &quot;The X Factor&quot; Iron Maiden come back with a much more &quot;traditional&quot; album.  While not as strong as &quot;Piece Of Mind&quot; or &quot;Powerslave,&quot; &quot;Virtual  XI&quot; is a solid piece of British Metal all the same.  &quot;Futureal&quot; is reminiscent of &quot;Aces High&quot; and &quot;The  Clansman&quot; is classic Maiden.  &quot;The Angel and the Gambler&quot; is  their take on mid-70's Who, but is more than a bit repetitive, and a bit  too long (but still a catchy song).  &quot;Lightning Strikes Twice,&quot;  and &quot;When Two Worlds Collide&quot; are solid songs, as is &quot;The  Educated Fool.&quot;  While nothing on this album is quite as good as what  they did in their mid-80's heyday, &quot;Virtual XI&quot; shows Iron Maiden  working to recapture the magic that seemed to come so easily in the past.  Definitely worth listening to.
0446525537|5.0|My mom bought this book for me as a Christmas present.  She had read Message in a Bottle, and loved it.  So I was expecting a good book.  But this book exceeded my expectations.  It was excellent.  Maybe I enjoyed it  so much because I am almost 17 myself, and I can identify to being that  age, even though it was set in the 1950's. But it was just one of those  books that you can't put down.  And I loved the ending.  It is very  ambiguous, and I know which ending I would love to believe and which one I  am leaning towards, but still... it's sketchy because of the details.  And  I really haven't decided which one I completely support yet.  Still, I  would suggest this book to anyone, especially those who may be a little  down on themselves.  This book leaves you thinking, as well as truly making  you thankful for what you have.
B000002J6H|4.0|I'm astonished by the comments of the amazon.com reviewer. Stills is the most accomplished musician in CSNY:  He played every instrument except the drums on the debut record and almost all on Deja Vu.  While all the guys in  CSNY have their strengths, Stills is the one with cache with serious  players.  Incidentally, it's Stills, not Clapton playing the solo in the  middle of &quot;Go Back Home.&quot;  (Clapton plays the coda).  Listen to  Stills handle the Hammond B-3 on the jam with Hendrix.  It's a shame this  guy never lived up to his talent, but when this album was released he was  at the top of his game.
B000002BYA|5.0|being a fan of blues and rock, i found this cd a year or so back and bought it,and it hardly ever quits playing in my cd player, the show from the topto the bottom was electric, the music has hot, and srv was at his  best on this night.  He has horns in some of the songs, but most are just  srv and double trouble.  the fans were LOUD in this cd, makes you feel like  you were there. i recommend this highly
B000000OU0|5.0|This album is a wonderful introduction to one of the all time great bands for those who are not already familiar with their music.  It covers all the bases of the Eagles easy listening sound.  <br />The acoustic version of Hotel  California with the impressive guitar skills of Joe Walsh and Don Felder is  worth the price of the album alone.  BUY IT!
B0000042MY|5.0|A magnificent score by Trevor Jones.  It is the greatest soundtrack I own and is better than The Mission's soundtrack by Morricone imho.  Not one track disappoints.  Hell, it might be the best cd I own as well.  Grab this  one and see the movie as well!  WOOPEE!
B000002HRE|5.0|This is by far Metallica's most underrated album!  So what if it lacks a lot of the aggression that their older albums had. The 4 members of Metallica are all in their late 30's, 3 of them are married, &amp; Lars and  James have kids!  They've matured, It happens. They can't stay 22 forever.  Now that I've done my venting, I'll talk about the music. Even though it's  not as heavy as any of the 80's albums, it's still raw &amp; powerful.  James Hetfield has matured into a VERY impressive lyricist. The other 3  members have grown as musicians as well. Kirk is playing better now than he  did 15 years ago. The songs also deserve alot of merit.  &quot;Slither&quot;, &quot;Carpe Diem Baby&quot;, &amp; &quot;Where the  Wild Things Are&quot; are great bluesy rock tunes!  &quot;Low Man's  Lyric&quot;, as mellow as it is, is an amazing ballad!  Even Though  &quot;The Unforgiven II&quot; isn't nearly as good as the original, it's  still a great song. Overall, It's still a great Metallica album!
B00000JZC4|5.0|This cd is great, it is a mix of heavy and soft tunes. I bought the cd after &quot;Welcome to the Fold&quot; came out on the radio, it is the heaviest song on the album. I really like every song on the cd. My  favorites are &quot;Welcome to the Fold&quot;, &quot;Take a picture&quot;,  and &quot;Cancer&quot;. I recommend Staind, Sevenduist, NIN, and  Silverchair if you like Filter.
B000002KGT|5.0|The answer would have to be yes. While 'Tusk' is my favourite Mac album, 'Rumours' redefined pop excellence and drama. Made during a time when the interpersonal relationships of the band were in complete disarray - the music is a dialogue of sagas. Ironic considering some band members weren't speaking to each other and yet had to perform on songs that were being directed at them.  <br />In this environment of emotional turmoil and drug inducement - Fleetwood Mac created a timeless masterpiece that became imbedded in popular culture. The music is superbly crafted whether it be the sublime harmonies of Stevie, Lindsey, and Christine; the rhythm section of Mick and John; or the atmospheric qualities of 'The Chain' or 'Gold Dust Woman'.   <br />Its for these reasons that 'Rumours' continues to chart in the UK Top 40 and still ranks highly in Amazon sales. If you have a DVD player, I would suggest that you purchase the DVD Audio version of this album. Not only does it contain 'Silver Springs' but the sound quality is superb. Also, Mac fans should also have the 'The Chain' 4 CD boxed set which contains lots of alternate versions of songs. Whatever you choose to do, 'Rumours' will always remain a quintessential item in any good pop collection.
B00001QGPR|2.0|Bowie will revive, providing he will use drugs again. I'm saying this because he is going for another all time low. (The first was in the 80's) Reason? A real bowie album 'grows' on you. The more you listen, the better  it gets. But here it is the other way round. At first the album seemed  reasonably nice, but after the fifth time I couldn't bare it anymore. By  the way the new videoclips are extremely boring and the guitarist Reeves  Gabrels must be sacked.
6305622825|3.0|I had never been so confused about a movie before in my life before I saw this one. You keep on wondering who is on who's side and when. And the thieves are the good guys. And...well, basically, this is not my kind of  movie. ciao.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I think all of Fionas personal tragedies come to light here as is common of her. This CD is wonderful and the more you play it, the more it grows on you. Even the overplayed Fast as you Can - I never get sick of it! The  arrangement on that song is genius. Every song on this CD is wonderful and  I guarantee it will be one of your favorites. If it is not then you are a  teeny bopper and have no idea what good quality music is BUY IT NOW !  Oh,  by the way, I am reading Clive Cusslers 'Atlantis Found' - Awesome !  check it out in books.
6305428522|5.0|Robert Redford does it again in this much lauded film that is flawlessly executed with pathos and suspense, and, incidentally, one of the top picks of 1994.  &quot;Quiz Show&quot; is the absorbing, engrossing story of  tirumphs and downfalls (of both tv showbiz and personalities).  The cast is  quite remarkable--John Turturro is brilliant and sympathetically strikes a  cord with us, Rob Morrow is nothing short of powerful, and Ralph Fiennes is  stiffly and guiltily confused as one who has to live up to the incredible  reputation of his father (played by Paul Scofield, who's absolutely  terrific).  There's some awesome directing that requires a second viewing  (including where Fiennes is rubbing his sweaty cheeck with a cold bottle of  milk, as if to cool his shame).  The script is also extremely witty and  literate; in other words, brilliant and remarkable.  The cinematography is  very effective and observant (the game show owners says to Ralph Fiennes,  &quot;It's okay, there's only the three of us,&quot; and the camera looks  at Fiennes, towering over him ominously).  &quot;Quiz Show&quot; is a  masterpiece, a thriller with brains, a drama with heart.  Don't miss this.
0671449028|5.0|My fussy baby required that I sing to her to calm her in her first months of life.  After reading and re-reading this (and other) books, The Going to Bed Book replaced singing.  The rhythmic rhyme was very soothing to my young daughter.  Everyone in my family could recite it.
B00003XB8K|4.0|After 3 years of waiting, Enigma 4 finally starts a new story. With the last album Le Roi Est Mort ending a Trilogy, The Screen begins a new journey into what Enigma is about: being mystical and beautiful. Although  this album requires some getting used to, once one is in the zone,each tune  sounds like a ticket to a strange and mysterious world. &quot;Push The  Limits&quot; starts the album off with a bang and the haunting  &quot;Gravity Of love&quot; with vocals from Olive set the stage for a  classic album. The &quot;Smell Of Desire&quot; works as a combination of  elements from all 3 albums so far and &quot;Modern Crusader&quot; lifts the  energies. The album is by far the most instrumental so to date and also the  most different, which is good to see. Enigma have never been boring, they  are bad at it. The strong theme of the album is made powerful by Carl Orffs  Carmina Burana sampled several times. The theme of the album: listen, feel,  learn and understand, the album is meant to be felt rather than spelled  out. SO what if a song is called &quot;Silence Must Be Heard&quot; or  Traces(Light &amp; Weight), look a little deeper, maybe you'll know what  Enigma mean!
0871137380|5.0|Every year the United States spends hundreds of billions of dollars on defense, money that is spent to ensure that books like &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; never have to be written. This book tells about the Battle of  Mogadishu, a battle that degenerated into a fight for survival for a small  group of American soldiers sent on a fools errand. All the advantages our  military typically enjoys-- overwhelming firepower, technological  supremacy, superior training and leadership-- were made moot by thousands  of Somalis carrying easily obtained automatic weapons and RPG's. <br />The  descriptions of the battle are terrifying and almost beyond comprehension.  In one scene, an American soldier sees a man shooting a rifle at him  through the legs of a woman sitting in front of him. Small children sat on  the shooter's back, giving him added protection. At first the Americans  only fire at Somalis carrying guns, but as the situation deteriorates and  casualties mount, anything that moves is fair game. It is difficult hearing  American soldiers admit that they killed women and children, and Bowden  does an excellent job showing how, under the circumstances, this was the  only &quot;sane&quot; course of action. Surrounded, under constant fire,  and faced with an enemy using unarmed civilians as guides, scouts, and  shields, the only chance the American soldiers had was to shoot at everyone  and everything. Confusion reigned and the most powerful military force in  the world was unable to help their comrades in need. <br />If I recall  correctly 18 U.S. soldiers were killed and 73 wounded. An estimated 500  Somalis were killed and perhaps twice that many wounded. These appalling  losses came as the result of an operation that was pointless from the start  and poorly thought out and executed. This book shows that, for all our  firepower and advanced technology, a small group of irregular fighters can  inflict unacceptable casualties on American forces. Automatic rifles are  easier to buy than Levis and U.S. soldiers are not immune from bullets. The  battle of Mogadishu no doubt affected the decision not to use ground forces  in Kosovo, and will probably be a deterrent from using ground forces in the  years to come. The question as the 21st century dawns is, can the American  public accept casualties in ground combat? Will there be any lessons  learned from the terrible fighting in Somalia, and will that lesson be  &quot;keep the soldiers out of the firing line&quot;? I hope that the U.S.  military learns more from the suffering of the soldiers in &quot;Black Hawk  Down&quot; than future despots and warlords looking to skirmish with the  U.S. Army.
0375707972|4.0|It could be the type of book one would expect out of a middle-aged, German judge, full of the law and still haunted by the guilt of his parents' generation in Nazi times. But author Bernhard Schlink adds a sensual layer  infused with another breed of guillt. While there is a subtle eroticism in  the early chapters, this gives way to the sights, smells, memories and  fixations of trying to deal with relationships and responsibilities. As the  narrator moves from his adolescence to middles age, Hannah glides through  his life, first as lover, then as mystery, later as obsession, and finally  as heart breaker. Hannah is at times everything good and everything evil as  her secret is revealed. Her deeds and insensitivies as a prison guard, her  quirky tenderness, her efforts to cover and uncover her past -- these are  the tidal waves beneath the surface of this engaging small volume. In the  end, her secret both revealed and overcome, there is no relief from the  mystery that surrounds her driving motivation. The title of the book, The  Reader, takes on various meanings, but everyone in the book who is a reader  is doomed in his or her own way. And by the end of the journey, one can  only ask, &quot;Why?&quot; That question, especially to a German of the  present generation, is the troubling reaction to atrocities large and small  of the mid-20th century.

0425129586|5.0|This was an excellent book.  This was also the first Agatha Christie book I've ever read.  The characters and use of symbolism made the story even better.  The ending was very surprising!  This is a book that you must  read.
B000002MTR|4.0|One hot minute is one of the best Red Hot albums. This Cd is so much different from BSSM, but the Red Hot chili Peppers sure made the right choise of hiring Dave Navarro. Dave Navarro brought some variety in the  rhcp music, using simple chords so Flea could show his great bass  abilities(listen to Coffee Shop! ). This album has some great songs; like  Aeroplane, My Friends, Warped(good heavy song), Terjerker and Coffee Shop.  Like every other album, this cd has also some bad songs, and this is why I  gave the CD four stars instead of two.<br />I'm not saying that this Cd is  better than Blood Sugar Sex magic, but is worth buying it just to listen to  a different kind of Red Hot chili Peppers.
B00002MZ2T|4.0|If you liked Savage Garden's debut cd, then you will definetly enjoy this one. I loved their debut cd for it's catchy songs, beautiful ballads, and unique sound. Their second album has the same elements from the catchy  Animal Song, and Affirmation, and the beautiful ballads I Knew I Loved You,  and I Don't Know You Anymore. The only reason I give this cd four stars is  that it sounds just like the first one, but I still loved it and continue  to listen to it over and over again just like I did with the first one.
6304994540|5.0|This movie could be the funniest movie ever made. But, then again, the Monty Python movies are also very funny. But, this movie is not only hilarious, but unlike other comedies, this movie has a good story, too.  John Goodman is really great in this movie. And all the other characters  are so funny and interesting at the same time. I'm usually not the biggest  fan of using cuss words to make a scene funny, but Goodman's use of them  are just hilarious. A smart and just downright beautiful comedy.

B00000I9MK|5.0|Tigermilk's haunting pop lyrics and beautiful melodies will stay with you for days.  Since buying this album I have listened to it at least once a day, having given up on the current state of popular music and especially  popular radio.  I especially love the integration of horns, violins, and  piano on Tigermilk, which make this album too complex to categorize as  simply pop or alternative.  There truly is no below-average cut on the  entire album - each song is worth savoring and enjoying for its beauty.  I  particularly like &quot;The State that I Am In&quot; and &quot;She's Losing  It.&quot;  Enjoy!
B000002UB3|5.0|Other than Michael Jordans last shot, is there a better finish in world history?  I find it interesting that people critize some individual Beatle tracks from certain records, as if they  represent the whole album  (Maxwells Silver Hammer, When Im Sixty Four, Yellow Submarine to name a  few). Even the &quot;worst&quot; Beatle records have at least four of five  absolute masterpieces on them. &quot;Let it Be&quot; has been, by many,  considered their weakest album. Weak? Hmmm, lets see, &quot;Let it  Be&quot;,<br />&quot;Long and Winding Road&quot;, &quot;Get Back&quot;,  &quot;Dont Let Me Down&quot;, &quot;Across the Universe&quot;. Now lets  examine the Stones best, &quot;Let it Bleed&quot;...sorry, can't think of  one. Its does manage to make my ears bleed. &quot;Abbey Road&quot; however,  does not have a weak moment. From &quot;Come Together&quot; to &quot;Her  Majesty&quot;, the album flows more freely than wine, and is a proper  swansong from the most amazing group of individuals to  assemble musically  in history. The Stones have &quot;Bridges to Babylon&quot; or maybe  &quot;Minutes to Maalox&quot;
0671510991|4.0|Dr. Kissinger seems to know a lot about history, being a smart and intellectual man with the brainpower to write a 1,000 page book.  I am reading this book for my Global History class in school, and I think it is  a great &quot;outside source,&quot; as compared to the school textbooks.   Kissinger's Diplomacy makes a great tool to use, as with the textbook,  which reinforces knowledge of history.  As we go, chapter by chapter, in  each the text and Diplomacy, we see how each interprets their ideas, and  some of Kissinger's own interpretations. Using Diplomacy, I have seen that  I better understand history, from two separate points of view.  The only  problem I have had with the book is that I found it hard to understand and  interpret some of Kissinger's quotes and ideas.  The book, I think is meant  to be read in a higher level of schooling, such as college, but not in high  school.  I probably wouldn't have read it if it wasn't for my Global  History teacher, but I can't complain because I got my &quot;A+&quot; out  of it.   Way to go, Dr. K!

6304083769|5.0|This is on par with &quot;Akira&quot;. Okay maybe a close second, but real close. For those of you who had a hard time understanding &quot;The Matrix&quot; you should leave, read a book, rent &quot;Dark City&quot; and  then try this movie. For those of us who understood the movie clearly, this  is a masterpiece. A little short, &quot;Akira&quot; was much longer, but  flawless unless you're picky like a MF'er. Amazing doesn't cover it... more  like perfect. This is a movie for smart audiences who actually think for  themselves and if you're like me, you seem to dispise a lot of things  mainstream 'cause they force opinions and decide what's cool for you,  you'll love this movie. Don't worry if you don't &quot;get it&quot; the  first time, it does get you thinking. This is a movie that doesn't stop  halfway through the film to explain itself to you, you learn along the way.  It's like a river, you jump in and go with the flow. This in no way is  'long and boring' like some other viewer said it's only 82 minutes long.  For a short film to be this complex shows the genius of it. It's a  challenging and intricate masterpiece. Science Fiction done right.

B00000JMOF|4.0|The strength of &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is found mainly in Boris Karloff's superb performance. He is not the golem-like creature portrayed in later versions but rather a tortured thing cruelly brought to life.  Karloff perfectly conveys an unearthly awareness that would be in keeping  with a life force created through artificial means.           Some film  literature states that Leslie Howard and Bette Davis were considered for  the roles of Dr. Frankenstein and Elizabeth respectively.                                      The restored version, showing, among other things, the  Monster tossing little Maria into the lake, conveys the misguided innocence  of the fatal act. U.S. censors cut that part of the  scene, but such a cut  gave the scene a ghastly connotation in not knowing what was done to little  Maria. Dwight Frye is superb as the demented Fritz. His torturing of the  Monster, in extended scenes recently restored, as well as the moment when  Drs. Frankenstein and Waldman are allerted to his fate, are gruesomely  chilling. The obvious studio set at the graveyard lends to an excellent  macabre atmosphere. &quot;Frankenstein&quot; is a fine film and well worth  seeing especially for Karloff's terrific performance.
B000002B30|5.0|This is an album no true rock fan can be without. All the songs on this album were written by the one and only Bruce Springsteen, the most talented and original songwriter of our time. Mr. Springsteen I thank you for a  great album. So go out and buy this album you won't regret it with songs  like &quot;Born To Run,&quot; &quot;Thunder Road,&quot; &quot;Hungry  Heart,&quot; &quot;Brilliant Disguise,&quot; &quot;Secret Garden,&quot;  &quot;Murder Incorporated,&quot; and all the others that I would like to  list, but there are just so many. Mr. Springsteen keep doing what you've  been doing for so long, and thank you again.
B00000JCB2|5.0|First of all, Limp Bizkit is not a punk band.  It is hardcore, that is why they are a hardcore band.  Second of all they RULE, oh and they ain't white rap. Sure the CD is kind of boring after you listen to it for three months  straight, but isn't every thing like that?  Signifcant Other was a sweet  album and if you like Nookie, you will pretty much like the whole CD.
B000007VRQ|2.0|If you are not a Genesis fan, but want to hear the first album, get this one.  It is the only CD of &quot;From Genesis To Revelation&quot; (there are millions of reissues of &quot;From Genesis To Revelation&quot;) with  six bonus tracks, rather than four.  The bonuses are &quot;The Silent  Sun&quot; (NOT &quot;Silent Sun&quot;, there are two different versions),  &quot;That's Me&quot;, &quot;Winter's Tale, &quot;One-Eyed Hound&quot;,  &quot;Image Blown Out&quot; and &quot;She's So Beautiful&quot;.  The last  two mentioned are the 2 previously unreleased tracks.  They are good, but  it sounds as if Pete is singing them with a lisp!  But that's OK.  The  remaining tracks on the album are a very unique type of music.
B0000025D0|5.0|Probably the greatest Springsteen album. Too bad Bruce didn't include some songs like Hearts Of Stone, that were included on multi-package Tracks, but the ten songs on that record live up to its first  title - American Madness. It's a record full of dark, hopeless sounds that  deep inside contain the rich profile of Springsteen's America at the time.  Highly recommended!
0679746048|5.0|Any one giving this book a negative review due to literary content or any other superficial agenda has missed the point of the book.  These hospitals exist, unskilled programmers often run them, and highly intelligent capable  people especially women frequently get misdiagnosed and misplaced into  these institutions.  Some women make it out whole and others buy into an  idea that they are in fact crazy.  I'm not a writer and am not interested  in how well written this book may or may not be. I'm thankful for the story  Susanna Kaysen shared.  Although at times we may be self indulgent or even  find flaws, how we choose to live with, define or pass them off does not  make one crazy just because it doesn't fit into someone elses self serving  agenda.
0783222955|5.0|Alan Pakula, Robert Mulligan and Horton Foote have made an absolutely terrific movie of one of the greatest books in contemporary fiction.  The three years covered in the book are compressed into one year in the movie,  and almost everything of importance is kept in the film version.<br /><br />Shooting the movie in black and white was inspired.  It symbolizes the stark reality of black vs. white that is at the core of the novel. The acting is extraordinary across the board.  Of Gregory Peck, so much has been said that further praise is redundant; suffice to say that after Peck's performance, no one else will ever be able to play Atticus Finch.  The children are wonderful, so real that they hardly seem to be acting at all.  Mary Badham is absolutely perfect as Scout.  Phillip Alford is excellent as Jem, and John Megna is fine as Dill.  The lesser actors live up to the lead roles.  I especially liked Collin Wilcox as Mayella Ewell; James Anderson brings out all the ugliness and cowardice in Bob Ewell, and Alice Ghostley is a funny and wacky Stephanie Crawford.<br /><br />The three characters who didn't live up to their counterparts in the book were Miss Maudie, Calpurnia, and Tom Robinson.  Ms. Maudie is a very intriguing character in the novel, a ditzy, wise, funny woman of bedrock integrity; in the movie, she comes across as just another next door neighbor.  Calpurnia's part was far too small in the movie; in the book she plays a major role in the family, almost like a surrogate parent.  Estelle Evans is a fine actress and deserved a bigger role to give her talent more scope.  And Tom Robinson is almost too saintly to be believed in the film version, over-acted by Brock Peters.  But Robert Duvall in a non-speaking movie debut is just right as Boo Radley, and Scout's recognition of her formerly scary neighbor, with her tentative smile followed by 'Hey Boo', is one of the most affecting moments in the picture.<br /><br />I still remember when Peck won the Oscar for best actor; in his acceptance speech, his first words were 'Thank you, Harper  Lee.'  The movie 'To Kill A Mockingbird' is a labor of love of bringing a timeless classic to the screen, and Harper Lee must have been very gratified at the results.<br /><br />Judy Lindcceptance speech, his first words were 'Thank you, Harper  Lee.'

B00000IBRX|4.0|Before entiring the movie theater to see What Dreams May Come, I purchased the book, so that I could read all the details of this experience.  I'm glad I did, see my book review.  The movie is daring, breathtaking,  believable, heartwarming, real but most of all soul searching.  To love and  be loved for all eternity, to believe that love can transcend to the next  life makes one want to live and love the moment.  The art of loving is not  magical, not easy but worth the risk, death does not take love away, death  magnifies love.
6304258984|4.0|I really loathe Director Michael Bay's MTV directing style (&quot;Armageddon&quot; was one of the worst movies I've seen), but I think &quot;The Rock&quot; is a terrific action movie. Not quite on the level of  &quot;Face/Off&quot; (one of the absolute best action flicks I've seen),  but still not bad. <br />The plot? Renegade Marines led by Ed Harris, angry  that the government has denied compensation for the families of Marines  killed in black operations, capture Alcatraz and decided to hold the city  hostage with missiles armed with VX poison gas. Cage, Connery and a SEAL  team try to penetrate the prison and defeat Harris' troops.<br />&quot;The  Rock&quot; is a real triumph of a good story and great acting. Nicholas  Cage, Sean Connery and Ed Harris are all great in their roles. Connery in  particular has what it takes to be a star. I particularly enjoyed the scene  where he taunts Harris into showing his true colors by quoting Oscar Wilde.  Cage, Connery and Harris save the movie from the director.<br />And Bay is a  lousy director- his cut of the Humvee sequence gives you a throbing  headache, and his over-directs his actors. Fortunately this is a script  even he couldn't mess up.<br />See this movie for Cage, for Harris and most of  all for Connery. Don't see this for the directing.

0792839846|5.0|Casablanca gives us the many facets of love.  To quote from C.S. Lewis The Four Loves [[ASIN:0156329301 The Four Loves]] (Affection, Friendship, Romantic, Divine) \\"To love at all is to be vulnerable.  Love anything and your heart will certainly be wrung  and possibly be broken.\\"  Casablanca gives us the full human drama of  living and loving.  Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman are superb.  Bogart  is cool and reserved but surprisingly becomes fully human and redeeming.  Ingrid is a lovely, poised, intelligent woman who knows the truth and  believes her choice will make a difference for human kind. A love triangle  that has many twists.
630512762X|5.0|Fans of Hong Kong actor star John Woo were disappointed by his U.S. debut, the tepid &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;. They should have far fewer bad things to say about his 1997 action film &quot;Face/Off&quot;, one of the best  action films this reviewer has ever seen.<br />The plot of  &quot;Face/Off&quot; is, to say the least, rather original- FBI agent Sean  Archer (John Travolta) undergoes an operation to switch faces and  identities with international terrorist Castor Troy. The two immerse  themselves in the other's identity and go to war. The action scenes are  exciting, if a little bloody (&quot;Face/Off&quot; must feature the highest  on-screen bodycount in movie history). Woo's skills as a director are  considerable, but the real fun with &quot;Face/Off&quot; is watching the  acting duel between Nicholas Cage and John Travolta. The two essentially  switch roles halfway through, but the ironies are even better than that!  Each actor is pretending to pretend to be the other, and Cage and Travolta  are fantastic at it.<br />Action fans will be positively giddy watching Woo's  elaborately choreographed shootouts (though the harbor boat chase was a  little over the top for my taste). Unlike most action flicks,  &quot;Face/Off&quot; features some outstanding acting. Cage, Travolta and  their supporting cast (Joan Allen pulls off a tough part as Travolta's  wife) are all terrific and deserve real praise. &quot;Face/Off&quot; won't  disappoint.

630420065X|4.0|I saw &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; the movie and walked out conflicted. On one hand it was a terrifically exciting film, on the other it was confusing as all and seemed to lack the critical elements that made  &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; the television show such a success during  the 1960s.<br />Brian De Palma is an exceptionally talented director quite  skilled at using the camera to give the viewer a deeper window into the  story (check out his use of camera angles in the restaurant sequence), and  Tom Cruise is a surprisingly talented actor who really carries the movie by  himself. Fans of actor Ving Rhames will be happy to know he has a number of  good scenes. <br />Fans of the old show had a gripe about the movie's focus on  Tom Cruise. After all the &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; television show  was all about the team- each team member used their talents to catch the  bad guy in the nick of time each week. &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; the  movie was about a man, Ethan Hunt, clearing his name. The spirit of the  show was not there, which in my estimation hurt the movie.<br />The movie's  complex labyrinth of doublecrosses and triplecrosses is rather confusing.  I'll wager half of all moviegoers hadn't a clue what the plot was really  about.<br />Otherwise &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot; is a great movie. The  music is excellent, the action sequences are clever and much more complex  than in the usual, garden variety action flick.

The  film requires no introduction, save to say that  Grant spreads a touch of  magic in a wonderful and enchanting story. Remakes have been attempted, but  none can equal this.

6302281415|5.0|I am such a fan of this film, each song brings you right to Berlin. The twists of this film are surprising, and you want another cabaret song the minute you finish it.  The scenes with Joel Gray spice up the film, with  naughty thrills. My favorite movie by far, acting well done, singing  incrediable, dancing sassy, everything you need for a memorable musical

6304539258|4.0|When I first saw Star Wars, I was but 6 years old.  The nightmares would follow for 12 more years.  When I saw Star Wars again, I was 18 years old and more prepared for it.  Now that I see it again, I kind of like it.  Of  course its directed by George Lucas.  It might have been better if John  Hughes were directing.  In fact, Star Wars is almost like Home Alone.   George Hammil was a blond kid left all alone, Maculy Culkin was a blond kid  left alone.  Coincidence?  I think not.  Anyway, the aliens, special  effects, and what-not are pretty state of the art seeing as how it was made  in 1977.  I also take it you saw Episode 1.  (Which only insulted this  movie even further.)  So all-in-all this is a good movie you should  definitly purchase.  If you want inside infor for Episode 2, it's George  Lucas sitting in a directors chair laughing into the camera for 2 hours.  I  think that'll win an Oscar, don't you?
B000002GA8|2.0|This is all pointless nonsense that is saved solely by Wakeman's occasional display of his renowned virtuosity .

Forget this one !
6302824613|5.0|I LOVE 007. I started out as a wee child reading Ian Fleming. YES almost the only similarity between this film and the book is the title. But WHO CARES ? It is 60's hip styleish and very funny in spots. The cast is to die for. EVERYONE is in this. The theme song is the kind of music that makes you crank it up and drive at speeds in excess of 100 mph. The look of Love will make you play mouth trumpet and want a round bed. I am lucky enough to have this on VHS but I would be first in line for a DVD. But why does Terence Cooper get the main acting credit ? Who the hell is he anyway ? I never have seen him in anything else. He had a minor part. My cat Eddy could have done a better job as 007.
0679746048|1.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book - espcially since the movie previews looked good.  Boy, was I disappointed.  It was too short and never really had a chance to develop any meaningful story line.  It started  off interesting when she gets admitted and talks about some of the people  at the mental hospital, but then the plot just stands still for the rest of  the story.  The book ends SO abruptly that you actually find yourself  looking back three or four pages thinking maybe you skipped a chapter or  two by accident.  The author had the perfect opportunity to write an  interesting and insightful story about her past experience in a mental  hospital.  Instead, she rushed through it and you really don't have time to  care about any of the characters.

0792151712|1.0|Impressions: Razzle Dazzle special effects, at least they look good by 1997 standards... Unfortunate foreshadowing: We know Rose can't drown, though we wish she would, because she is allegedly telling the  story...Unneccessary scenes: Rose's fiance shooting up the boat, any scene  with Leonardo in it, the steamy orgasm in the car, any scene with the old  lady, on and on...Most satisfying moment: a frozen Di Caprio sinking  beneath the waves...Redeeming social value: The nude sketching scene pushed  my honey over the edge...so all was not lost. Otherwise this thing should  have sunk like a rock.
B00001ODHF|5.0|I have seen this movie about a thousand times and spend way too much time talking about it to people that are only interested in current news. The one thing that I have noticed is that many people say that this is a bad  horror movie. For anyone that has seen the Evil Dead trilogy, you should  recognize that THIS IS NOT A HORROR MOVIE! It is the most entertaining  movie (along with the Holy Grail) ever made. I don't think Raimi had any  intentions of scaring people, he wanted to produce the movie as eye candy.  He was trying to do something different that does not fit any one genre of  style, and succeeded. Do not watch this movie with any expectations: except  to experience a wonderful 90 minutes of eye candy and great one- liners.
6305313687|5.0|First things first, this movie is not a joke.  The content is incredibly serious, and the scenes that are shown within reflect this.  <br />Edward Norton plays the role of Derek Vineyard, a misled youth with a mind to  persuade, who falls into the white supremacy scene.  Derek learns the  racial hatred from his father who was killed in the line of duty, while  fighting a fire at a Compton drug den.  Derek's intense hate coupled with  Norton's almost terrifyingly real performance, helps the audience see that  there is some basis in the rhetoric that is presented in racism.  I was  scared at how convinved I was of Norton's performance, and deep thought is  requied to try and overcome his sway.<br />The plot is so gripping, you can  feel the emotion around you while you watch scene after scene filled with  nothing but hate.  Norton truly deserved the nomination he got for the  role, and I was surprised to see that he didn't get it.  <br />All in all, I  don't want to spoil the plot in the review, you really need to see a movie  of this calibre by going in cold.  I would recommend this movie to anybody  who hasn't seen it, and all I can do is hope that everyone enjoyed it as  much as I did.  It is a moving tale.

B00003XB8K|3.0|After listening to this CD a couple of times, I feel empty. The annoying sample at the introduction has been intermixed throughout the CD, distracting the listener from the songs.  Everytime I hear it, I think of  an old Rave song with the same sample ripped off. I was expecting them to  break new ground with the CD, unfortunately other artists have evolved from  Enigmas work, why can they? I dont think Euro-Pop is an evolution.
0790729628|5.0|Words fail me. I finally made time to sit down and watch this film. I wasn't disappointed, and you won't be, either. If you liked the theatrical release (like I did), you'll love the director's cut. Without Harrison  Ford's voice over, you have to pay even closer attention to what is going  on onscreen. It's well worth the extra effort. Even if you ignore the plot,  the visuals alone make it well worth your time.
630542845X|1.0|As a Christian, I find this movie to be a religious statement in the wrong direction. It has you by the heartstrings much of the time, but feeds you a Beatle's &quot;everything is one&quot; world view over and over. If your  life goal is to &quot;explode&quot; into the universe and be absorbed  by  the impersonal energy around you, then Powder is the film for you. To the  objective soul Powder fizzles!
0784011214|5.0|ARTISAN Entertainment's release of RAMBO: First Blood Part II should be the standard by which all DVD's are judged - excellent picture (with the exception of a few minor lines in a couple of scenes), great sound, plus a  veritable plethora of special features. For starters, RAMBO comes in a  \\"keep case,\\" not one of those junky \\"snap cases\\" you get from Warner Bros.  The cover photo is printed right on the disc, a feature Disney is now  bragging about as if they invented the idea. The disc itself contains the  digitally mastered widescreen version of the film; a very interesting  commentary track with director George Cosmatos; vocally enhanced motion  menus; theatrical trailer; production notes; cast and crew info; a fun  trivia game; and to top it all off, the documentary, \\"An American Hero's  Journey!\\" What more could you ask for? As any good American knows, RAMBO is  the classic sequel to First Blood, and stars Sylvester Stallone as John  Rambo, Richard Crenna as Colonel Trautman, and Charles Napier as the  nefarious CIA Special Operations officer, Murdock. This time, the intrepid  \\"one man army\\" is sent on a mission to search for POW's in Vietnam. But  Murdock orders him not to engage the enemy, just take pictures. Of course,  Rambo is not satisfied to stop at photography; he means to bring his fellow  soldiers home -- at all costs. Abandoned by Murdock's men, Rambo fights a  war with both the Vietcong and the Russians all by himself - and very  effectively I might add! The ultimate action thriller, \\"RAMBO: First Blood  Part II\\" is a film no DVD collection should be without. A+<br />Note that  Rambo: First Blood Part II is rated R for lots of violence, gunplay, and  really COOL explosions!
B00002MZ2C|4.0|&quot;Rage Against The Machine&quot; is propably the most important crossover album in the 90's. It was allso the album that brought straight avant-garden into the hard rock music. With their third album  &quot;RATM&quot; continues offering blastin riffs, funky beats and  aggressive choruses. Tom Morello proves (again), that he was the greatest  guitarrist of the 90's, and Zach De La Rocha gives Fred Durst a free lesson  how to vocalize crossover. but compared to the debut &quot;BOLA&quot; seems  a little boring, because few songs sound quite much each others. Still,  blasters such as &quot;Guerilla Radio&quot;, &quot;Sleep Now In The  Fire&quot;, &quot;Testify&quot; and &quot;Calm Like A Bomb&quot; prove why  RATM is concidered to be as one of the most important bands of the last  decade. Actually it is the end of the album that brings the boredom into  the record. last song sound little too much like each other. Maybe this was  a little too long album, maybe not, but it just doesn't quite equal with  the level of the debut. But one thing is sure: RATM continues revelling the  weak ponts of our society. SO TESTIFY !
B00001ODHF|4.0|Before there was Austin Powers, there was...Ash of the Evil Dead Trilogy.  In this installment, Ash has evolved from a frightened survivor to a smooth-talking fighter from the 20th century stuck in the Middle Ages. This  movie more or less picks up where the second one left off, with Ash trying  to defeat the &quot;Deadites&quot; with the help of a small village of  people.  As with other sequels, this one does stray a little from the  original movie, plus it is not so much a horror film as it is a silly  comedy.  Still though, it does have it moments.  Ash's puns have gotten  decidedly funnier, but the film itself is not the best of the Evil Dead  trilogy. It tries too hard to be an action-comedy, and it does not pay as  much homage to its predecessors. Obviously, the budget in this film was a  lot bigger than in the first two, but part of what made the first two so  good was the fact that they managed to have a good horror flick without a  boatload of dollars. Yes, they were cheaply made, but it didn't matter.  In  this one, it seems like the budget becomes a burden.  I think they should  have stuck to the formula that made the other two so good and not worried  so much about pleasing everyone else.  All in all, a good film, but could  have been much better.
0679746048|5.0|I'M 13 YEARS OLD AND I WATCHED THIS WITH MY SISTER AND MY DAD I THOUGHT THE MOVIE WAS GREAT!  AFTER I TOLD MY MOM HOW MUCH I LOVED IT SHE GOT ME THE BOOK, THE BOOK WAS EVEN BETTER I FELT LIKE I WAS IN THE STORY LIKE I  WAS SUSANNA KAYSEN. MY OPINION IS IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE THE MOVIE OR THE BOOK  YOUR CRAZY.
6302038308|5.0|I rented all 3 Evil Dead movies one night, and I have to say that I enjoyed this one the best out of the three. This one basically cuts out a lot of what happened in the first Evil Dead movie; some of the characters are deleted, and it takes a few minutes to realize what is going on. Still  though, this one has more of a comedic spin than the first one. Ash and his  girlfriend travel to a cabin in the middle of nowhere to spend a few days,  and accidentally end up unleashing the evil spirits that surround the  woods.  Then when help finally arrives, the trouble starts all over again, and Ash finds himself in a climactic battle with the ultimate incarnation of evil, before being sucked into a timehole and landing right in the Middle Ages. Make sense?  Of course not! But who cares!  With Bruce Campbell's brilliant  heroic/comedic performance, mixed in with the obviously-over-the-top gore  and humor, this film is simply brilliant from beginning to end, the best of  the three Evil Dead movies.  Get it!
078401213X|5.0|A truly unique, brilliant effort. Beats the heck out of other films with budgets in the tens of millions of dollars, and this one only cost $60K!<br />Recommended for math / science / engineering type intellects.
B00002Z88D|5.0|I think this CD is fantastic. Off course I'm not very objective, because I'm a great fan of Metallica. I know a lot of people, who aren't fans at all, but are positive surprised by this production. It's very funny that  James Hetfield really has to sing this time.....
6302719631|1.0|I am an avid reader and love most of the books written by Jane Austen.  This version of Northanger Abbey was very disappointing.  Having been moved to tears by other excellent movie adaptations of Jane Austen stories  (Persuasion w/Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root, Sense &amp; Sensibility w/Emma  Thompson and Kate Winslet, Emma w/Gwyneth Paltrow); This rendition of  Northanger Abbey left me diappointed, confused, and mad at myself for  wasting money to rent the video.  <br />The acting left much to be desired.   It seemed awkward and stilted.  I absolutely hated the actor's portrayal of  Catherine.  She was the most irritating of all.  Her attempts at  &quot;wide-eyed innocence&quot; came across as &quot;space-out  stupidity.&quot;  The cuts between fantasy/dream sequences and reality were  reminiscent of B-movies.  This was a total waste of time and money.  Until  someone makes a decent movie adaptation of Northanger Abbey, please just  read the book.
B000002UY5|5.0|Blind Melon may have gotten national acclaim for the hit &quot;No Rain&quot; found on this CD, but were thrown into the 'one hit wonder' bin shortly after. AND THAT JUST ISN'T FAIR! B.M. was an amazing band that  played tunes which could almost take you back to the 60's in an instant.  &quot;Paper Scratcher&quot; is easily as good a song as &quot;No  Rain&quot;, while &quot;Tones of Home&quot;, &quot;Change&quot;, and  &quot;Sleepyhouse&quot; help to define this album as 'excellent' and even  'essential'. It's too bad that this band is no longer around to kick out  the psychedlic jams, but Hoon and company DID leave three wonderful albums  in their stead--and this is the best of them.
0440178002|5.0|I had heard from friends that James Clavell was an excellent writer.  After finishing 'Shogun' I can certainly say I agree. The story itself never got dull during the 1100-odd pages.  There were many interesting  characters in the book, Blackthorne certainly being the key.  I liked  seeing how he at first resisted, then grudgingly accepted, then finally  adapted the Japanese culture as his own (the baths and the non-meat diet,  for example).  The social characteristics of 1600's Japan were captured  perfectly and were fascinating (seppuku, for example). The TV series was  before my time so I've never seen it.  It's hard for me to imagine any TV  program or movie doing justice to a story like this.
B000008FNB|5.0|All the classic tracks are here but regular buyers of boxed sets will be dissappointed by the lack of info. There is a booklet with lots of nice photos but no information about the origins of the songs, the history of  the band etc.. Oh and why did they include 'Not That Funny' as one of the  tracks..it really is awful.. The rest is 5 star stuff though. It reminds  you of how great this band is..
B000008GS2|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic album. Every song on it, is sheer excellence in its own way. Particular favourites of mine are &quot;Sunrise&quot; - a dreamy tune, &quot;Nothing Too Serious&quot; - a  wild rock sort of track, &quot;The Kingdom&quot; - close your eyes and  enjoy the music. Great! Also, &quot;The Girl in the Moon&quot;. I cannot  stress how excellent this album is - every house should have one!
B000002UAR|5.0|Imagine the shock those teenagers must have felt when the needle of their record players started to reverberate with the pulsating drum and bass lines of &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;. I imagine a few of them were  still listening to &quot;She Loves You&quot; and &quot; I Wanna Hold Your  Hand&quot; at that time. There are so many wonderfully creative moments on  this record, its hard to believe any band could have so many great songs on  one album. Paul McCartney's &quot;For No One&quot;, &quot;Eleanor  Rigby&quot;, and &quot;Here There and Everywhere&quot; are monumental  achievements for a guy who wrote &quot;The Night Before&quot; less than a  year earlier. Harrison's &quot;Taxman&quot; with its Hendrix-Like solo by  Paul(A full year before anyone would know who Hendrix was) is a classic  rock song that stands up to any Cream or Stones tunes of that era . Has  there been a single Stones (famous for their twin guitar duo's) song that  comes close to the guitar creativity, or modality that oozes from &quot;  And Your Bird Can Sing&quot; ? Did'nt think so. Make fun of &quot;Yellow  Submarine&quot; if you'd like, but how many bands were or are capable of  making that type of song, and it being a valid &quot;hit&quot;, in the  middle of all this ground-breaking material? Backward guitar solos charted  out, vocals through Leslie speakers, Drum and Bass forefront in the mix,  all first, all Beatles. Its impact is still felt  today, in all records.  Lennon had few moments on this record, but as in the Beatles next release,  he had it most glorious. &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; is a true Beatle  original, as un-catchy a song (No chorus, middle-eight, hook) as you'll  ever find. You will not ever find a more influential song than that one.  Strains of its innovations are found even in Oasis, Pumkin, Nirvana, and  Pearl Jam records to this day. Not to mention the artist of that time.  True, the Beach Boys &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (which I listened to on the way  here)preceeded this record, but not enough to have a full  influencial<br />impact as it did on &quot;Pepper&quot;, and it is a  tremendous, and groundbreaking record. But Revolver shines now, as it did  then, more brightly than the rest.
0792838637|5.0|I'm no die-hard fan of James Bond, but I thoroughly enjoyed and still enjoy watching the DVD Special Edition of Tomorrow Never Dies (TND).  I'll refer to characters in my description.  I thought that Mr. Stamper was a  pretty mean, cool and formula looking tough guy (see some Jackie Chan  films, you'll see a resemblance).  I couldn't wait to see Elliot Carver go.  Bond's female counterpart, Colonel Wai Lin was the best I've seen for a  while (partial to the eastern style of attack).  The motorcycle scene was  the best!  Also, I liked Sheryl Crow's song; she may be yesterday's top  entertainer, but I still thought it fit in well.  Finally, Pierce Brosnan  showed compassion that is needed in Bond.  One more thing, it's worth the  money to get a home theater (big screen, stereo, dvd, etc) when watching a  movie like this one.  VHS doesn't cut it.
6305311463|1.0|Ok... Where can I start?..... How about WHY? Why is there a critereon edition of this film?  Did Michael Bay pay somebody to give it the criterion edition?  I thought that was for special films... Ones that we  may remember ten minutes after we have seen it!  The film itself is full of  (no offense) all American smultz, I can stomache the first half of the  film.. then I have to go and watch Appolo13 to remind myself that good  space films are still made. Quality of the DVD is good, but then I've seen  DVDs with ten times worse quality, and enjoyed them more. I think Aerosmith  should write a new song, titled..'' You're not going to miss a thing'' and  play it to people who have decided not to buy this DVD!  Saying that, the  DVD makes a good drinks coaster in my lounge, and a great frisby for the  kids in the park.
B00002Z83J|5.0|This is the mother's milk of blues rock, and &quot;Moonchild&quot; is a better song than anything ever recorded by Rory's more famous contempraries.  This album is the finest example of a talent that was taken  too soon away.  You won't be disappointed!
0425129586|5.0|At the school library, I was short of time so I pulled the first book I saw off the shelf.  Little did I know that this would become my most favorite book ever!

6302902010|4.0|came here looking for the tv version which i, too, remember seeing as a child.  have the CD of this rendition of the opera.  it is gorgeous. my daughter is doing a paper on &quot;porgy and bess&quot; and i'll have her  sign on, too, but DID YOU KNOW: -the opera IS the original work -is based  on a real murder, made into a book and then a play -other  composers/lyricists were originally contacted, but were let go when their  work veered towards a muscial rather than opera -lastly, and READ THIS IF  YOU'RE A TRUE FAN:  the Dallas Black Dance Theatre created a dance version  of the opera (no dialog) for the Gershwin anniversary year.  scored with  MILES DAVIS' incredible jazz arrangements of gershwin's tunes (get this CD,  too!  he has compressed gershwin essentials into lean and smooth sounds)  and supplemented with original piano music to complete the soundtrack.  IT  IS AWESOME!   you should see Bess's RED DRESS (it gets its own credit in  the program).  sets take you right to catfish row.  went on world tour to  sold-out houses from jun 98 to jun 99 when i saw it on return to Dallas.   will be performed again next year....BE THERE! i so wish she could see the  other version for her research!  i continue to search and wait....
B00003XB8K|2.0|Well, after loving E1, not caring so much about E2 but absolutely being blown away by E3 I can only say that E4 comes up rather short.  It opens great, with wonderful layers of varying instruments and melody - Gravity of  Love being a stand out.  All the stuff which made E3 so enjoyable. Big soft  beats with lots of varying patterns. And then comes Modern Crusaders. Oh  my. What a dated piece of music that is. I was saddened to hear how the  album was turning out because it started so beautifully.  Next up came the  tracks with the guitar, now while it's ok to begin with it very quickly  turns into plain old guitar masturbation - rapid soloing without any real  melody.  Sorry it just wasn't working. Another reason the album was feeling  a bit dated. In fact listening to the music behind the guitar I can only  wonder why it was put there when any other hoard of instruments could have  been used. Oh and why use 'o fortuna' ? I mean, at least use something that  not many people have heard of before. A complete turn off. All was not lost  though as I finally made it to Between Mind &amp; Heart, which was bloody  good stuff. If only the whole album had taken the approach of this track.  Enigma 3 is still my choice as the all-time classic.
B00000DFRS|5.0|&quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot; is certainly Whitney Houston's best album ever. Whitney delivers a striking performance and not one song dissapoints - It has a special place in my collection. This is one of the best CD's of  the '90's and I highly recommend it to any music lover and I look forward  with great anticipation to Whitney's next album.
B00000J7J4|2.0|When I heard Santana I was really expecting a good cd, but I was very disappointed with this.<br />The collaborations seemed to be so commercial and superficial it isn't funny. Like he wanted to make some money fast.<br />If  you know Santana, you would know that he is a very good musician, but this  album does him no justice. I wouldn't invest the money in this. It's just  not worth it. Sure it sells, but so do BackStreet Boys. I wonder who are  the type of people buying this music and thinking it's so wonderful. I feel  sorry for them. Invest your money in a past Santana cd instead, you'll be  infinitely more satisfied.
B00001ZWBQ|5.0|Forget what you might think of disco. These guys are much more than that--they will win you over with a wide range of hits that you forgot were among your favorites. They pump out hits for almost two hours and the DTS  sound is awsome. If you like music, you'll love this DVD.
0790729725|3.0|When you compare a movie like the Matrix and Goodfellas, Goodfellas wins tenfold.  However, when you compare the same movies on a DVD, they are again night and day, only in the favor of The Matrix.      It disturbs me  that Scorsese, a huge advocate for film preservation dosen't care more  about the quality of his own pictures.  C'mon Marty!  You did it in Taxi  Driver!  A huge amount of sales would go up if he and Pillegi spoke on the  thing.  In addition, there is disc flipping involved? . On Casino, you  didn't even have to flip.  And, that DVD was more than 3 hours long!  If  this is the fault of Warner Bothers, then those idiots should respect the  fact that this is one of the best films in film history!
0553275569|4.0|Some pee in their space suits, others catch some zee's, a few might think about home and family.  Such is the earthy fare of space heroes, suited up, strapped down, ready to be zootered into orbit.  Such are the revelations  in Tom Wolfe's classic best seller on the early years of the U.S. space  program.<br />We love the stories of Wolfe's titillating disrobing of  Astronaut's egos, enemas, and Konakai cookies.  There's also the mocking  irreverence as technology goes bust.  Remember the unmanned Redstone rocket  fiasco at Cape Carnaveral in 1960.  The great beast on the launch pad,  embers stirring ..5..4..3..2..then..pop.  In a little fizzle the escape  tower launches leaving behind a rocket, the assembled dignitaries and other  stunned guests.  Most of whom look on bemused, confused, and silent as the  one act play takes its course.  Oh yes, and then there is all that fun with  the &quot;no see 'im bugs&quot;, Pete Conrad's jalapeno &quot;gift&quot;,  Chuck Yeager's drawl, Edwards, Panchos, and the Chief Designer, Builder of  the Integral!<br />Let's stay with the Builder of the Integral for a moment.  Mr Wolfe writes that just as the Americans were about to seek some space  triumph the Russian Chief Designer would spoil the show, putting  satellites, dogs and men of the Red Sickle in space before the U.S.  Does  the Chief Designer's spirit live on?  Can we question Mr Wolfe's treatment  of his subject, spoiling the the &quot;electrifying best seller&quot;?  Is  Tom guilty of a few porkies here and there, a touch too much  creativity...hmm?  More informed readers are perhaps best placed to judge,  but an example throws a questioning shadow.<br />Tom makes much of the  competitive instincts of the original seven Mercury astronauts with John  Glenn, &quot;the Deacon&quot;, the &quot;apple-pie&quot; hero, coming in  for extra special treatment.  Tom writes of Glenn's over-the-top  performance at the 1959 Dolly Madison press conference that announced the  Original Seven to the world.  When they were asked how many of them  expected to return safely to earth, Wolfe records that Glenn, &quot;one  couldn't help noticing&quot;, had both hands up in the air.  The others, he  suggested, could barely raise one.  What perhaps has gone unnoticed is a  photograph of the event (one appears in Time-Life's &quot;Life in  Space&quot; book) that shows Wally Schirra, too, had both hands up!  This  is hardly an earth shattering revelation but suggests Mr Wolfe has a case  to answer for over-exuberance.  How many of Tom's other tales suffer the  same fate?<br />The book, we should not forget, is a great read.  Just how  many wrong stunts go into the &quot;The Right Stuff&quot; is something we  should ponder.
B00002Z88D|2.0|I have been a Metallica Fan from the beginning. I stuck with them through thier genre changes. From 'Fast Thrash', to 'Slow Metal', to 'Hard Metal', Metallica have remained the MASTERS! So when a band as high up as Metallica  are, why mix your hard, head banging, riffs, with poncy slow violins and  chellos. The legendary loud sounds of 'Enter Sandman' and others are  drowned by the slow harmony of the orchastra. It doesn't sound good. It's  softened the hard element which we all no and love of Metallica. Advice  boys.....Don't ever do it again!

B000002U6E|5.0|This is (without a doubt) the best ENIGMA album ever released, though I haven't listened to the new one yet, this still is the best. Being the 2nd it allowed MC to lead on what the people wanted, and make things better,  that the people didn't like in the previous album. THE CROSS OF CHANGES is  #1 by far. To start off this album SLIVER the #1 movie ever made had  producer Robert Evans go to MC and request a song written especially for  the movie. So we now have CARLY'S SONG my #1 favorite song in the whole  entire world. Re-Titled as THE AGE OF LONELINESS on this CD the cut on the  soundtrack is better. But still AOL is the best song on this CD. If anyone  has the CARLY'S SONG CD SINGLE with SHARON STONE on the cover (and is  willing to sell it) PLEASE GET A HOLD OF ME! I have been trying to find it  for a long time! Please Please E-mail me!
B00000DFRS|3.0|While I am a Whitney Houston fan, I was not as pleased with this release as compaired to some of her others. My Love Is Your Love sounds like a completely different song from what is aired on the radio. The same is true  of It's Not Right But It's Okay. The album is marginal.
6303184499|5.0|SLIVER is without a doubt the best movie ever made. With faced paced sex-violence-action- and suspence, SLIVER is the best EROTIC THRILLER ever made.

Also buy the soundtrack with my fav.  song on it -- CARLY'S SONG written especially for this movie performed by  ENIGMA.

0792835719|5.0|The DVD version of &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; does extreme justice to this incredible movie which is one of the best science-fiction films ever made, and my personal favorite.  It captures the film's original brilliance  with crystal-clear sound and picture and offers a variety of options which  prove the greatness of the DVD format. Offering both Widescreen AND Pan  &amp; Scan (which extremelly diminishes the beautiful cinematography) as  well as both English and French versions [NOTE: watching the French version  with English subtitles can increase the viewer's feelings of superiority  and overall pretentiousness.] This DVD truly is the reason the format was  created.
0446604844|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  Despite other reviewers' concerns about a lack of realism and poor characters, I thought the plot and characters were engaging and worth spending time with.  There were points when too many  story threads with lots of detail overlapped, but Sidney was a gutsy female  protagonist who carried me through to the next moment of clarity.  It was  worth finishing, and I would recommend it as a vacation read, although it's  not as polished as many other fictional thrillers.
B000022TSF|5.0|This is the best Polanski movie I have seen, although I like most of his other works. But the first time I saw this movie, I was so awed by Polanki's masterpiece. The whole movie was based on the subject of water,  as with everything else in the movie. If you watch the movie carefully, you  will find that this movie has a lot of subtle meanings relating to the  Bible,and as typically Polanski, Evil wins in the end. Don't just see this  moive as a LA Confidential...it has far more deeper meanings, something you  have to sense for yourself.
006097625X|5.0|If you are interested in any aspect of comics at all, this is the first book you should have on your shelf.  Scott McCloud guides you through the history and theory of comics art with wit and wisdom, all captured in an  easily accessible comic.  More than a simple funny book, this book will  change your opinions on comics, whether you have never picked one up  before, or you are a long-time comics professional.  This book could be  used as curriculum for a college course, despite (or maybe because of) the  whimsical artwork.  The art draws you in and makes the information easy to  accept and understand (in fact, McCloud gives examples of why the comics  artform makes it easy to read and identify with).  McCloud takes this  subject matter seriously, and after reading, you probably will too.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona has done it again!  I can not take &quot;When the Pawn&quot; out of my CD player. I love every song and they all have this funny way of making you smile.

B000006E17|3.0|This movie was banned in my home country for many years, for good reason,and having seen this movie I have developed a new appreciation of censorship.<br />The alternate title should warn you, 120 days of Sodom, and  believe me, thats not just a name!<br />Anyway, the story is set in WWII, in  Northern Italy, Salo is apparently a town there and it may have been the  new capital of the rump Italian Fascist state that formed after the death  of Mussolini. The plot is quite simple, the four new leaders of the state  decided to have a &quot;rest-cure&quot; before they started the busy work  of governing the state.In order to do this they kidnapped a number of young  teengers of both sexes and with a number of old prostitutes begin to  recreate the marquis de sades book.<br />The actual movie is beautifully done  which adds to the horror, as the intense acts of sexual cruelty become  real......it is no wonder that half the audience walked out of the theatre  half way through...<br />I must add though, that this movie is not a  pornographic movie, the director, before his untimely death at the hands of  an enraged christian soon after he made this moviee had embarked on a  so-calleed &quot;trilogy of life&quot;. I had the good luck to see another  of his movies in this triolgy and it was brilliant.<br />However i would not  reccomend watching this movie unless you have a staunch constitution and no  children.
0792153189|4.0|I liked this film.  It was not your average disaster movie in that it tries to have a more human slant than its predecessors.  Okay, so it fell down a few times, being a bit sugar sweet with the teenage marriage and the  daughter who reconciles with her father just before the killer tidal wave  hits.  However the special effects were good, the acting was not too bad  either, and there were one or two toughing moments that were fairly  realistic and not overly sugary.  I agree it is no Armageddon, but then did  it ever want to be like Armageddon?  I doubt it.  Both are distinct and  enjoyable films that just as watchable as each other for different reasons.  So if you want a fairly intelligent disaster movie, that tries its best to  be interesting and entertaining in the same breath, then watch Deep Impact.  It's not bad and it does have its moments.
B000002J23|5.0|That's right, this is an album with only one brief guitar solo (on &quot;Run Through the Light&quot;).  Yet, it is one of the most solid rock albums I've ever heard.  I love all six tracks.  It's amazing how well this  one-time Yes lineup wrote and recorded their music.  Geoff Downes gives the  album a more up-to-date (well, 80's) sound with his synthesizers...but with  genuine melodic feel, and wonderfully gels with Howe and Squire's guitars.   Alan White, whom I never cared much for, must have enjoyed playing the  drums and various percussion on Drama - quite aggressive!  The singing is  as good as with Jon Anderson...granted Trevor has a different feel, perhaps  less emotional than Jon, but he's perfect for Drama.  Steve Howe's guitar  sound is multi-faceted and strong yet with a touch of restraint for the  good of the songs.  Squire's bass knocks the wind out of you!  The lyrics?   Well, I can't quite follow them all, but I don't see how ANY die-hard Yes  fan can possibly criticize them for that!
0783226063|4.0|The DVD version of Dune is the bomb.  I only wish that the Japanese extended version was available on DVD as it would fill in the gaps in the story, but despite this I still love the film and would recommend it to  anyone.  It is a complicated film that has to be watched several times to  be understood.  However, with the fantastic special effects (especially  those worms!) excellent acting from a superb cast (look out for Patrick  Stewart as Gurney Halleck) and Sting at his grotesque best as the sadistic  Feyd, Dune is well worth watching every time.  Don't just rent this film,  buy it, you will want to play it again and again, it's almost addictive as  the spice Melange!
B000002U84|5.0|'Rio' is a fantastic album that true duranies have to love! 'Rio' has some wonderful classic songs that we all know, such as 'Save a Prayer', 'Hungry like the wolf' and of course 'Rio'! But the reason I really love this album  is because it has really great obscure songs that you dont hear much  anymore like, 'Last chance on the stairway' and 'My own Way' which happen  to be my favorites! No matter how many times you listen to this alubm, you  can't get tired of it, it's not possible!
B00000K3UU|5.0|Great idea for the movie: A young man who can't take care of himself, has to take care of a 6-years-old boy (beautifully played by twins). Guest appearances by Rob Schneider and Steve Buchemi, really make a contribution  to the movie. Adam, as usual, does a great job making fun of a girl  throughout the movie! Not many extra features, but a great movie  anyway.<br />You can find other reviews by me to other releases by Adam  Sandler.
B00000I8UD|3.0|Things are looking up for ex-Japan front man. The former European son is now a husband and a father living in America, and he sounds happy.<br />His previous solo album, 1987's \\"Secrets Of The Beehive\\"  masterfully demonstrated Sylvian's sense of forlorn melancholy. \\"Dead  Bees On A Cake\\" in contrast, being an album borne out of love and a sense of belonging, reflects his new found happiness. Sylvian's senses are  fully open to the world around him and he delights in sharing the wonder of it all with us. It is unfortunate then, listening to this album, that  things do not seem as wonderful to us as they obviously do to him. Despite this however, \\"Dead Bees On A Cake\\" is a very sensual and spiritual, if somewhat self-indulgent album.<br />There is an ample mix of styles here, from blues and jazz to Indian. But in all the excitement, it seems that Sylvian has forgotten to remain focused. Instead of a cohesive collection of songs what we have here is more an uneven compilation of mini-projects.<br />Standout tracks include the nine minute opener \\"I Surrender\\", \\"Dobro #I\\", \\"Midnight Sun\\", \\"Krishna Blue\\",  and \\"Darkest Dreaming\\". Tracks such as \\"Alphabet  Angel\\", \\"Pollen Path\\", and \\"All Of My Mother's Names\\" would have made acceptable b-sides but as album tracks they just sound extraneous. Also Wife Ingrid Chavez's  talkie parts add nothing to the songs and her fluffy tones quickly become irritating.<br />It is encouraging to his fans that Sylvian is still willing to experiment and change, but with \\"Dead Bees On A Cake\\"  many would be forgiven to think that he has lost his way. Instead of being  the masterpiece it could have been, what we have here is the somewhat disappointing sound of artistic development gone awry. Shame.
6305627401|5.0|If you don't like musicals - Don't buy this one! It's great, but not like in the show itself... I personally loved it, and have been watching it over and over again since I have it. All my friends are complaining about me  humming the themes all the time. 2 thumbs up!
B000000WA2|4.0|I found this album an improvement over PARKLIFE, which in itself was pretty good.  The arrangements are fuller, busier, but never intrusive.  There are more pop hooks scattered about - you'll probably be singing one  of these songs in the shower the next morning.  And the lyrics are  generally well done.  In fact, the only problem I had with the album as a  whole was the lack of lyrical diversity - way too many tracks are stabs at  the upper/upper-middle classes.  Still, some of those are top notch songs.   Shame on alternative radio for not making &quot;Country House&quot; the hit  it should be.  Other favorites are &quot;Yuko &amp; Hiro&quot;,  &quot;Charmless Man&quot;, &quot;Stereotypes&quot; and  &quot;Universal&quot;.  Some tracks (&quot;He Thought of Cars&quot;) are  quite odd, but they rarely sound deliberately so (odd-for-oddness-sake).   The extra track (&quot;Lot 14&quot;?) is harmless fun.  Pick it up and  stick it to the man.

B00000IBRI|4.0|PHENOMENA<br /><br />(Italy - 1984)<br /><br />Aspect ratio: 1.66:1<br />Theatrical soundtrack: Dolby Stereo<br /><br />Originally edited for US consumption and released under the title CREEPERS, the full-length version of Dario Argento's masterwork reveals the method in his madness. Whereas the edited version was a fast-moving collage of half-baked themes which evoked nothing of any significance, PHENOMENA reinstates the crazy-quilt pacing, whereby dream-like passages surrender abruptly to episodes of screaming hysteria, all of which is essential to any appreciation of the film's dark ambitions.<br /><br />Romano Albani's sumptuous cinematography transforms the breathtaking Swiss locations into a fairy-tale landscape where monstrous eruptions of violence disturb the illusion of tranquility, and Jennifer Connelly drifts through the narrative  in a state of near-hypnotic grace, allowing herself to become ensnared by the machinations of a deformed killer and his/her equally psychotic 'guardian'. True, the longer version is bogged down at times by lengthy dialogue scenes which hold up the plot, and the involvement of Donald  Pleasence's chimp is no less misguided than before (its final act of retribution crosses the line into absurdity), but the set-pieces are magnificently realised, and the final 20 minutes are as hair-raising as  anything in Argento's ouevre.
0446910201|5.0|Rubin Carter was tremendously courageous and strong hearted.  What I really admired about him was he turned all of the negative energy he had stored internally and used it positively.  Through his story, it just shows  that no matter what, if you are determined to do something and go somewhere  in life nothing can stop you.  Rubin Carter is trully a heroine of all  mankind!
0783235666|5.0|I have to give The Birds two thumbs WAY WAY up.  I didnt think I'd like the movie at first, but as I started watching, I became more interested and the suspense kept my going thoughout the entire movie. I recommend that you  watch The Birds.  If you are into Drama and Suspense, you absolutely NEED  to see this movie!
0800193334|5.0|This is one of the only movies I've ever seen that is &quot;mild&quot; enough for a child but funny, and involving, enough for a teen and/or adult. It is based on the book of the same name by Roald Dahl, and, like  the book is charming and funny, if not a bit &quot;off the wall&quot;. This  is definately not a realistic look of the world, but the over-done approach  is so well executed that it doesn't really matter. The emotions are wild in  this movie, but fit the scenes, and the characters range the gamut, and are  all &quot;lovable&quot; in their own right.<br />Kid actress Mara Wilson  (Matilda Wormwood) is a gem and shines in her own right. This movie is  *almost* worth buying, just to see her recite her lines and make those  awfully cute faces. However, if you want a more realistic, equally charming  vision of childhood, I'd recommend &quot;Radio Flyer&quot;, &quot;Jack the  Bear&quot;, or &quot;House of Cards&quot;. If you want something purely  light and fluffy, but funny, this is for you.
1573225517|5.0|I read this book two years ago.  It has stuck with me and I find I often recommend it as an alternative to the dysfunctional female genre.  The funniest bit of writing I've read in a long time can be found in the first  thirty pages, but I enjoyed the whole book.
6303421563|4.0|Wildly original. Those should be the catchwords for this movie.<br />&quot;The Professional&quot; is first and foremost and action-packed hit, but it contains angst and emotion, too. The story is  about how 12-year-old Mathilda tries to take revenge after the shooting  death of her family. Mathilda doesn't really mourn the murder of her  abusive Dad or catty Mom and step-sister, but she does, however, grieve the  loss of her little four-year-old brother who, in her own words, &quot;never  used to cry, just cuddled&quot;. (Mathilda escapes death because she is out  grocery shooping when the murders occur).<br />Mathilda teams up with Leon,  her next-door-neighbor, who also happens to be a proffesional hit man, and  trains to be a pre-teen mercenary.<br />This is a great movie. The scenes are  well-sequenced and shot, and the character portrayed by the young Natalie  Portman (Anywhere but here, Star Wars: Phantom Menace) is exceptional, if  understated.<br />This movie wasn't as 'big' as thought it would be, but that  doesn't have to stop *you* from watching it! If you do, I'm fairly certain  you'll enjoy yourself.
6305119961|5.0|This is one great movie.  It will keep you on The Edge of your seat.  The tension between the 2 main characters is the driving force of the movie.  The acting is supurb.  The Bear scenes are excellent also.  A good movie to  watch over and over again!
6305074364|4.0|Misery is one of those movies that is based on a novel, and, because of this, never really measure &quot;up&quot;, partially, because the viewer has already read the book (or, at least that was the scenario in my case)  and is expecting a motion-picture version of the book. Like Stanley  Kubrick's version of the Stephen King novel, &quot;The Shining&quot;,  Misery is a good movie but the general &quot;feel&quot; of it, is that it  wasn't created with the book in mind. The characters don't have the same  &quot;feel&quot; as the written characters in this movie, but some aspects  of the film are actually better.<br />For instance, Kathy Bates performance as  the estranged fan of #1 Bestselling novelist, Paul Sheldon, was absolutely  stunning. Never have I been so attracted, and repulsed, by the same  character. The &quot;split-personality&quot; aspect of her character is  spookily realistic, as anyone who has studied various mental illnesses will  know. In fact, her deranged-one-moment, sweet-as-pie-the-next personality  is definately the scariest thing in the movie, and not so much the  atrocities she commits. <br />James Caan does an excellent job of not only  portraying a wounded man, but also of portraying a man living under  brutally truamatic conditions. (Note: the anticlimax of this movie was  great, too. &quot;Paul&quot; seemed genuinely affected by craziness he had  been put through)<br />If you are looking for a good way to spend a sluggish  evening, you might want to consider seeing &quot;Misery&quot;. Considering  the story-line, the &quot;blood and injuries&quot; aspect of the film is  definately not overdone. I enjoyed that... it was refreshing, the lack of  constant blood, the slowly building suspense... You won't be bored, that's  for sure.
B0000399WI|5.0|I'd heard for a while that this was a good movie.  The fact that the word &quot;long&quot; was often used to describe it kept me from viewing it since its release in 1994.  I finally sat down and popped the DVD in this  morning.  <br />Wow.  This is an incredible film.  I was incredibly moved by  the soul of this film.  The story is so human and has so many themes that  made me reflect on my life.  I bawled during and after viewing the film.   The performances are excellent.  And the director has crafted a riveting  film.  There are times you really wander &quot;What the heck is going to  happen next?&quot;, which is quite amazing for a &quot;prison&quot;  film.<br />Lastly, I found that SHAWSHANK did not manipulate me or over  exaggerate the bad guys as most American films are guilty of.  This is a  smart film that tells a soulful story.  There are great twists and turns  that the main characters go through.  And the truths at the heart of this  film are expressed simply and with care.<br />The DVD presentation is very  good.  I love behind the scenes featurettes and alternate channel  commentary, which are not present on this disc. That is a shame.  However,  the quality of the film is enough.  That speaks for itself.
6305252521|5.0|I believe this movie is the greatest and most original movie I've ever seen and I don't know why it wasn't at least nominated for any oscars except for ed harris (best supporting actor). I don't look at movies as  deep as some people, however. I don't look at movies through the eyes of a  critic either. All I know is what I like and what I don't; and this movie I  absolutely love! Jim Carrey gives a pretty good performance but it's  everyone else along with him that pull the whole movie together. With Peter  Weir directing, this movie turns into a work of art; A masterpiece; An  unfortunately underrated masterpiece.
6305531374|3.0|Okay, alright, that's not the first and original Halloween, the director isn't John Carpenter, is Steve Miner, ok, ok. But, god, what the hell, it's Michael Myers and Laurie Strode, together for a last revenge after long  twenty years !  Jamie Lee Curtis still made a wonderful job, as a very  beautiful and intelligent Laurie Strode and Michael Myers still very cruel  ( not scary ). And there's the ultimate scene where mother meets daughter :  Janet Leigh, Marion Crane from Psycho with Jamie Lee Curtis from the  original Halloween. Can you handle that ?  And after all, Janet says :  &quot;Let me be a little maternal for a moment...&quot;
0688170528|5.0|I was fortunate to be loaned The Pact by a friend who had purchased the book and not yet read it.  She gave me only a few days to read it but this is all I needed.  The Pact would have to be the best book I have ever read.   I could not put it down and felt I was involved in all the characters  lives.   It was not only a love story but was full of so much.  Having  three children of my own it really makes me wonder if I  know what is going  on in their minds - it certainly provides a lot of thought.  I will  definately be purchasing all of Jodi Picoult's books and would highly  recommend to everyone.
0140013997|5.0|In all my life I've never read a book as wonderful as this. This book is enchanting, hilarious, and all around spectacular. I would recommend this book to any animal-lover with a good sence of humor! (Gerald Durrel  certainly has a talent for writing.)
B00001ZWTT|1.0|I thought the movie was very disappointing.  I think the miscasting of Will Smith as Jim West was one of the major factors in the failure of this movie.  It was the hood meets the KKK in the reconstructionist south that  had an odd effect on the tone of the movie.  I really liked Will Smith in  many of his other movies but this was a bit of a reach.  Do we suspend  history for the sake of political correctness?  Let's do a remake of the  Clint Eastwood Westerns, oh and who should we cast as Joe? Oh I know, Will  Smith.<br />Other than that the movie was ok, a bit silly but good for a laugh  or two.  If I'm forced to watch it on a long flight over the Pacific Ocean  I may consider jumping.
B0000203YT|1.0|I must say this story line could have been quite  good. The acting was wonderful, but what absolutely ruined the movie was the number of sex scenes. It seemed as though that was the whole movie. They seemed to appear  every five minutes. My friend and I had to turn the movie off. It's too bad  for movies like this one that could have great potential and then to be  ruined like this.

B00000I41J|5.0|I am a jazz music fan in South Korea. I have much of jazz album in my CD rack. Among these collections, I have this title(Something Else) with 3 kinds of issues.

The reason  why I bought this title 3 times is that I feel the fist song of this album  &quot;Autumn Leaves&quot; is the best play among the hundreds of same  songs.   It is really hard to believe that this song was recorded in the  1950's. It is elegance, balanced, moderate improvisation  itself.<br />Especially, this RVG series are limited edition. So, If you want  to listen the miles and cannonball's beautiful play, you'd better buy this  RVG series. I checked with my system(KT 88 tube amp, spendor 3/5a speaker,  mid class CD player). It is better than previous issues.

B000002V1D|4.0|&quot;Ordinary World&quot; is a fabulous song. Period. The album cruises along at a high altitude until about track 9 or so, when the songwriting ran out of steam. Either they should put out shorter albums, or Simon needs  an honest critic.
0767811038|1.0|There are two basic schools of thought on Starship Troopers (the film): those who saw it for the special effects (5 stars) and those who came for the story (-5 stars). In a nutshell, these are the most oft-recurring  scenes (in that order): man getting shot in the head; people making love;  people getting eaten by giant insects; people destroyed by interstellar  asteroids; people getting shot by insect excrement out of orbit(those bugs  have awfully good aim); more dead people; people whose brains are sucked  out by a &quot;Brain Bug&quot; (actually referred to as such in the film).  The book focused on the flaws of a perfect Nazi-type society and by the end  the reader almost begins hating the humans and appreciating the bugs. The  film was about gore.
067144901X|5.0|My daughter loves this book!  We can read it 30 times a day and it never gets old.
B000031WD9|4.0|This movie really took me back to my teenage days (which wasn't too long aga). It was hilarius as the four friends make the pact to get laid by the senior prom. This film showed how rumors could really boost your rep, and  how bad it felt when you saw some nerdy dude get a piece before you. Jim is  kind of the focus of the friends who will do anything for that first piece,  or something that feels like it. Non stop laughter from a cast of unknowns.  This is really a hit. Only disappointment was my expectations from buying  the unrated version. There is very little difference between the two  versions and definitely no reason to tag this movie &quot;unrated&quot;. I  think it is just a marketing ploy to sell more movies and I'm sure it has  worked, I fell for it. I give the original version 5 stars, and this  unrated version 4 stars because of the unfulfilled expectations. The few  changes could have easily been placed on a deleted scene file and all sold  on one dvd.`
6301543408|5.0|As a continuing chapter in the Star Trek films,V bites the dust.But I gave my friend a dubbed tape called THE WORST OF CLASSIC TREK(Saving the best for last&quot;SPOCK'S BRAIN).It was the most hilarious thing.It was bad  enough with the basement DIY effects,but the plot made them very sub par.As  for Star Trek V the plot was ridiculous,Nimbus III reminded me of those bad  post-apocolyptic straight-to-video flicks,&amp;poor De Kelley looked like  he couldn't keep up with his younger co-stars(though his presence is always  a godsent in TREK).But if was intended or not it has an Ed Wood-esque  appeal,its humorous without even trying.Though the scene where Spock &amp;  Bones expieriencing their past pain is effective in bringing some sense of  drama in this farce.In a world where one of the most popular Trek episodes  is one of the worst (SPOCK'S BRAIN),V should be seen as one of the many bad  chapters in a great tapestry of stories.attn Trekkers: the contents on the  Worst of Classic Trek:The Alternative Factor/ Catspaw/ Patterns of Force/  And The Children Shall Lead/Plato's Stepchildren/Let That Be Your Last  Battlefield/Whom Gods Destroy/The Way To Eden/The Savage Curtain/&amp;last  but not least Spock's Brain.
B00002MZ2T|4.0|A pity that I did not find any song that stood out from the rest. They are all very listenable, but when compared to their first release, &quot;Affirmation&quot; ends up proving just how superb the first album  was, and how difficult it must have been for Savage Garden to come up with  an effort of similar impact. But nonetheless, their effort is noted and  felt.
0792839129|1.0|A dull, sophmoric musical about a turn of the century inventor-mechanic who turns a racing car into a flying and floating machine.  While on the beach, he fantasizes about himself, his ladyfriend (the daughter of a  candy-making tycoon), and two children named Jeremy and Jemima (who in the  world would name their daughter Jemima?) flying off to a fantasy land where  an evil king and queen keep children as prisoners.  The acting and the  story (loosely based on the one by the late British writer Ian Fleming) are  lousy.  The musical numbers are anything but memorable; especially the  number &quot;Chu-chi face&quot; performed by the king and queen.  This rank  imitation of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; is anything but entertaining and  should definitely not be shown to young children.
3895084581|5.0|I loved this book.  It is one of the best books my Mom has ever read to me.  I want her to read it again to me.  Thank you.  (I am seven but we read it when I was 5)
B00000IPAX|1.0|I'd have to say that blink 182 sucks now. Their older stuff was much better. Their first release was probably the best.I HATE PEOPLE WHO CALL THEM PUNK NOW. THEY AREN'T PUNK AT ALL. THE BAND EVEN CALLS THEMSELVES  PUNK. THAT IS SO ANNOYING. This cd and band is horrible. After this cd and  selling out, I lost my interest in the band. They were much better AND MORE  PUNK with the old drummer. This band used to be good and now are just for  teenybopper girls and homosexual boys. For some of the other reviews, blink  182 isn't the only band that writes their own music and plays their own  instruments. If you want real punk, try Bad Religion (The best punk band  ever), Pennywise, NOFX, MXPX, Good Riddance, Descendents (which blink 182  does NOT sound like), and any other REAL punk band. BLINK 182 IS NOTHING  BUT A JOKE!
B000002U84|5.0|RIO contains some of THE best moments of the 80s.  It's funny how such a remarkable and time-tested CD got relatively mediocre reviews when released, yet ALL of the songs and/or &quot;excessive&quot; videos which  the band got nailed for showed up on countless &quot;Top ____&quot; lists  for the millennium. Straightforward, uncomplicated pop, but has its  experimental moments too.  Try it, RIO will make you feel like it's always  summer or early fall. Best songs: &quot;Hungry Like The Wolf,&quot; all of  side B.
B000021Y74|5.0|Wouldn't it be great to be able to depend on American filmmakers to come up with something like this even once in a while? Combining mind-blowing originality with twists and turns that take your breath away, Tom Tykwer  has written and directed a tornado of a film that will haunt you for a long  time after you experience RUN LOLA RUN. Utilizing an ingenious three-part  harmonic idea, he introduces us to the characters and then turns us loose  to experience the unfolding drama as Lola must attempt to save her  boyfriend from certain doom unless she can come up with a LOT of money in  twenty minutes. But you already know that. What you DON'T know is how  thoroughly this film will blow you away! Try focusing on anything but the  brilliance of this effort as the credits roll by when it's over. Truly  original and completely inventive, RUN LOLA RUN is a classic!
B00000DQSV|5.0|...and leaves the teeny-boppers behind. Simon's at the top of his game with most of the songs here; excellent lyrics, seamless production---Nile Rogers is such a god. &quot;Skin Trade&quot; is one of the best songs the  group has ever made, and sadly, marks the beginning of their downfall from  the American charts. Beautiful package design too.
B000000JO3|5.0|One of the best punk albums ever made. This is an album that everyone, no matter what kind of music they like, should have at least heard. I don't care if you're straight edge or not, if you like punk and hardcore, then  you must own this album. This is the real deal.<br />Every song on this album  is excellent, from 45 second classic &quot;Straight Edge&quot; to the great  &quot;Cashing In&quot;. The album starts off with the shorter, sometimes  more intense songs and has the slower, but still just as potent, songs  later in the album.<br />To close: if you don't have this, go buy it right  now. If you have it, rock on.
B000031WD9|4.0|I watched this movie at the theather and I recently bought the Unrated Versiond (DVD) there wasn't much difference between the two versions (barely noticeable) but I recommend this movie a lot, it is very funny if  you take away the gross stuff, kind of romantic and you will surely enjoy  it (Don't watch it with Parents, Grandmas and friends of the opposite sex,  kind of awkward) and watch it with a cold glass of beer. (hehehe) I really  recommend this movie to bye, it will always get a laugh at of you!
B000002C1X|5.0|&quot;The Wall&quot; is a tale of how the trying and difficult experiences which accumulate over the life cycle, eventually converge in the mind, resulting in a battle for the preservation of ones sanity and the search  for new meaning. Though in this story the battle is waged in the mind of  the proverbial rock musician, it is a dilemma which we all must face at  some point in our lives and must overcome in order to maintain  psychological well being. <br />This theme is addressed beautifully in the  boundless depth of Roger Waters' soulful, heartfelt lyrics. The superb  musical accompaniment which compliments this ballad, makes &quot;The  Wall&quot; the pinnacle of Pink Floyd's achievment. The album marks the  full realization of the direction the band was moving in since its  inception. Gilmour's masterful guitar work exhibits a melodious  gracefulness which helps to usher in the emotional tone of each song. And  the cadence of Mason's flowing percussion is hypnotic. Not to mention the  other musical contributions as well. <br />The somber mood of this album is  sometimes critisized by those who miss the point. Its purpose is not to  uplift, but rather to induce thought, which proves to be a challenge for  most people. The motifs dealt with concern certain aspects of existence  which, though may yeild to despondency, are no less important in the realm  of human experience. Anyone up to the challenge &quot;The Wall&quot; sets  forth will be rewarded immensley.
0689815816|5.0|...to read this book over and over and over.  It's a mini-study of what appeals to toddlers (and adults!)  with its strong beat, a cyclical form, noises to make (&quot;Swishy-Swashy!&quot;)and an energetic plot.  No  matter how sleep-deprived you are, or how tired you may be from chasing  your little one/s, the book is so inviting you will find yourself giving a  highly dramatic reading (&quot;Tiptoe, tiptoe, tiptoe....WHAT'S  THAT?&quot;).  My 18-month-old daughter is wild about this book.  She knows  every silly noise and shrieks with delight each time we turn to the page  with the bear.  The text is wonderful, the illustrations are even better,  and the appeal will last for years.  Enjoy it.
0679722610|4.0|Not only great Hammett, but also great Kurosawa and great Sergio Leone. Red Harvest is the story that   inspired &quot;Yojimbo&quot; and &quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, and  more recently  &quot;The Last Man  Standing,&quot; starring Bruce Willis. Read Red Harvest and then view the  films.
0671027344|4.0|This book was great!  I couldn't put it down,  and I don't enjoy reading that much.  It's composed of these letters that are written by this freshman named Charlie to an anonimous person whom he admires for the simple fact that he/she wouldn't sleep with that person even if she/he  could have.  It's practically his diary.  It talks about his problems and  how he works them out.  I really recommend you read this book. Oh Yeah!  there's a surprise ending.
0440224764|5.0|I would recommend John Grisham's THE PARTNER to young adults (ages 12 and above) and all adults interested in law and adventure.  Most readers will find it difficult to put this book down.  The reason for my high rating is  based on three key factors.  First, I thought the book had an exciting and  unpredictable plot with some creative twists.  Second, you truly felt as if  you were there because the characters, Patrick Lanigan and Sandy McDermott,  for example, seemed real and believable with their own unique  personalities. The last key reason for its appeal was the interesting  description of how the legal process really works.  I found the  ending disappointing, however, in both content and story line.  However,  even with its ending, Grisham's THE PARTNER is sure to be a book and a  story to remember.  It will remain one of my favorite John Grisham  books. Readers will learn a great deal about life and the legal system.  In  terms of the legal system, my own knowledge of law expanded, particularly  regarding the procedures, charges, legal information, resources, and the  court system.  The main life lesson I think the book offered was that one  event, small or large, could affect someone's life entirely and send a  person's course in a completely different direction.  After reading  this great book, I encourage other Grisham books like THE CLIENT and THE  RAINMAKER.
B000002J09|5.0|I really like Zeppelin, and i don't get why you other zep fans don't like Stairway to Heaven!  but, it's your opinion.  I really like Stairway to Heaven, Rock and Roll, Misty Mountain Hop, and When the Levee Breaks.  All  the other songs are awesome,too.  On VH1, did anyone notice that zep had 4  songs on the countdown?  i think that's pretty good.  this was my first zep  cd and i fell in love with it.  Oh, and it's ok to compare bands.  I've  always compared zep to The Who.  and the Later Beatles.  I like it how it's  always a given that Stairway to Heaven is always gonna be in the list of  top 5 rock and roll songs.  on the viewer's choice, stairway to heaven got  #1 which is more important than anything!  By the way, WHAT is a gearhead?
B000002L71|5.0|David Byrne (lead singer/writer for Talking Heads) will never win any awards for brilliant lyrics, deep emotional songs or, for that matter, lyrics that can be interpreted at all.  But it doesn't matter, every song  on this CD will have your adrenaline pumpin' and feet a tappin'.  David is  a master at creating these great songs.  For those of you who have heard  &quot;Burning Down the House&quot; (which should be just about everyone  except my dad), the rest of the songs are just as energetic.  For a CD just  about as good, I highly recommend &quot;Little Creatures.&quot;  <br />To  differentiate the truly great CDs, I have only given 15 CDs a 5-star  rating. This is one of them. Click on my name above to see the rest of  them.  Maybe your musical taste is similar to mine and I can lead you to  other awesome music.
B00002E23E|4.0|I saw this movie when it was released in the 70's and I was flying a bit like a kite that day.  When I saw last week I wished I was 20 again with that same good stuff floating in my veins.  Technically movie is a bit  flawed, but other than The Who there is/was no greater band.
B0000028SR|2.0|Bruce puts the E-street band on hold and releases A mediocre record.Unfortunately it contains some of the worst songs Bruce has ever released &quot;Real Man&quot;,&quot;Mans Job&quot;and All Or Nothing At  All&quot; are probably my least favorite Bruce songs.Also contains my good  friend(and all time #1 Bruce fan) Ed's least favorite live Bruce song&quot;  57 Channels&quot;
185984054X|5.0|Most people will automatically be repelled at the idea of a book exposing the hypocrises and agendas of Mother Teresa, a woman described by many as a modern-day saint.  Those who steer away will miss an excellent  investigative novel that explores not only the motives of Mother Teresa,  but the effect (or lack of) that she had on the world.<br /> Do not fear that  this book is simply a character assassination, either.  Hitchens does not  set out to slander or destroy Mother Teresa, and in fact even defends her  in some instances, stating his belief that she was not a spiteful or evil  woman, but simply did not do as much as good as she is thought to.  A must  read for anyone interested in the truth behind the legend.
6304765789|5.0|This movie is a great surprise of a movie.It starts off with a beautifully constructed intro of the character's childhood. Then shows him as a condemned adult. Then Sean Penn's superb character as Michael's brother is  introduced.The movie is visually mysterious but psychologically  thrilling.The movie's ending is so perfect that you feel as if you just had  your favorite desert.
0792152328|1.0|This movie missed the whole point and I think the reason it was popular was because of Leonardo DiCaprio for the girls and the female nudity for the guys.  so of course this movie, with it's &quot;cute&quot; actor and  naked actress, would do well.  my advice to you - DON'T GET THIS  MOVIE!
B0000065M3|5.0|Mary-Tyler Moore played an excellent role in this fab fun movie.  One of Elvis' best films.
B000000WCA|5.0|The Spice girls' first attempts at stardom start right here, with the album spice. It is a delightful look into the spunky attitudes of five normal girls. The girls expand their horizons with R&amp;B tunes, pop tunes, and slow tunes for the heart. It is truely a wonderful album and I  reccomend it whole-heartedly
B0000065M3|5.0|Mary-Tyler Moore played an excellent role in this fab fun movie.  One of Elvis' best films.
B000002ADT|5.0|This album is all that and then some. Miles Davis has put out a lot of great stuff, but this is by far his greatest. Put this album on and listen to the talent assembled for your listening pleasure. Coltrane is incredible  as are the rest and Miles wails. This is a great album to sit back and have  a martini with. It is smooth, mellow and rivetting. If you are to buy one  jazz album, make this the one!
B000002L61|4.0|Believe it or not, Ronnie started his first rock'n'roll band in 1957 when he was about 12.In 1983 he recorded his first solo venture'Holy Diver'which is considered by many to this day to be his best album ever,while 'The Last  in Line'released the following year was seen as a mere continuation of the  same formula.Wrong!In many ways,in all ways,this is another  destination;slower and a tad less heavy than his first album,the magic is  still there-not very radio friendly,at least by today's standards,which is  commendable-this record features one of the best songs of the genre,the  epic'Egypt(The Chains Are On)'.Get it!
B000002UCN|2.0|One thing that took points off of this album was that half of it are Beatle tracks. I have pretty much every Beatle album, so they don't do anything for me. And another problem, some of his biggest hits are  repetitive. (&quot;My Sweet Lord&quot; and &quot;Give Me Love&quot;)  &quot;You&quot; has to be his worst song here. It's overproduced (by  Spector, go figure), but is kinda funny anyways. &quot;Dark Horse&quot; and  &quot;What Is Life&quot; are the best ones here. I am hoping they'll  rerelease &quot;Best Of Dark Horse 1976-89&quot; sometime, at least all  solo George Harrison songs are there.
0440234743|3.0|This was an enjoyable book, and had it been written by someone else, would probably be considered top notch. But when compared to other Grisham books like &quot;The Firm&quot;, &quot;The Chamber&quot;, or &quot;The Pelican  Brief&quot;, this book was a slight disappointment. The characters lacked  the depth normally defined in a Grisham book, and there just wasn't as much  suspense and intrigue as we've come to expect from John Grisham.
B000002BYD|5.0|Of the many seattle grunge bands that entered into the rock mainstream in the early 90's, Pearl Jam is without a doubt the most talented, innovative, and energetic band to have come out of seattle during that time.  with the  release of their fifth studio album &quot;YIELD&quot;, Pearl Jam presents  us with what I believe is their best album they have recorded since their  second release &quot;VS.&quot;  Over the years, Pearl Jam has struggled  with all kinds of problems such as pressure from the media,and changes in  their line-up which affected the band's communication within the group.   And with &quot;YIELD&quot; Pearl Jam makes a successful effort to  communicate once again, with both the media and the numerous amounts of  loyal fans by providing a record full of extremely well crafted anthems.   From the unforgettable one of a kind vocal styles of singer/lyricist Eddie  Vedder, to the great guitar works by riff masters Stone Gossard and Mike  McCready, bring to life song like &quot;Do The Evolution&quot; and  &quot;Faithful&quot;.  Eddie Vedder's vocals are as vivrant as ever in the  Zeppelin sounding &quot;Given To Fly&quot;, and the riff-laiden &quot;In  Hiding&quot;.  &quot;YIELD&quot; is by far everything you can expect from a  great record, and Pearl Jam has proven that they have what it takes to make  a great record, even under the circumstances the face, as the best grunge  band of the 90's.
0671027344|5.0|From being in Middle school to graduating highschool, stephen chboskys book did nothing but amaze me.  I laughed i cried... i UNDERSTOOD what Charlie was going through.  I was introduced to it by a friend of mine, with him only using a sentence.  Its funny cause we all go through what  charlie goes through.. love... sex... drugs... if anything this is the one  book that anyone can relate to.  Since then i have read it aprox. 4 times  and am currently going on my 5th.  I recommend that anyone- any age read  this book, cause you too will laugh and cry and UNDERSTAND.
B00000JPHF|5.0|This is what horror is meant to be. No blood and gore, no bad launguage. I haven't seen this but I've heard it's truly a horror classic. Buy it!
0375707972|5.0|This book took my breath away. The author does an excellent job of describing scenes, feelings, and events.  The devotion, love and commitment that the main character has is unbelievable. This story of true love is  told from the male perspective, which makes this book even more unique. At  a young age he finds the love of his life and she remains in his heart even  when she is not in his life.  The events don't unfold as you may expect in  a love story.....which is what makes this book so unforgettable. It really  touched my soul.
B000002J09|5.0|I was watching VH1 on 1/21/00, and the fans picked Stairway to Heaven as #1 rock song of all time. All of the celebrities hated the song. Well it goes to show what celebrities are. The bottom line is this song has what  Jimmy Page wanted it to have, light and shade. Actually this song is his  most brilliant ever. It starts out as a English/Celtic folk ballad and ends  up being a hard rock anthem at the end before finishing on a electric  single guitar note fadeout by Page. Other great Zeppelin epics like Kashmir  are heavy throughout or have repeating choruses which still go according to  previous rock song templates. With STH, they broke the mold and created  something totally distinct. I like the bridge after Plant finishes singing:  &quot;There's still time to change the road you're on...&quot; It sounds  like a guitar orchestra. And then the rest of it just is flat out the most  epic guitar playing ever, even better then on Layla or Freebird. There is a  reason that this song is #1 and everyone except a few jerks seem to agree.  I predict that Led IV will surpass Eagles greatest Hits in 2 years in US  record sales and by 2005 will be the greatest selling album EVER. This  record will be listened to in 200 years. Timeless.
B00000J7RZ|4.0|You see, I love Jennifer Lopez and all of her original songs, but her C.D. is just full of remixes! My favourite song is De No Ames with Marc anthony, but the remix is absoulutely horrible. It's  good C.D. though, and buying  it would be worth while.
B000002TYX|3.0|I wanted to pop open champagne and celebrate when the Anthology releases came out, but I don't listen much to this first one anymore. Most of the first disc is of low sound or music quality, and disc2 is okay but not as  good as the released material. Finished verdict: Must have for Beatles fan,  but for anyone else I say pass.
0440234743|3.0|Since the last few Grisham books have been a disappointment to me, I am glad to report this one is pretty darn good.  Not quite as exciting as Runaway Jury, but an entertaining adventure into the heart of Brazil and  some nice characters - very human.  The reflective and spiritual references  were great!
6304539282|5.0|I love star wars!  Ever since I was 10, my close friends and I have bought every movie available, we all have the &quot;Episode 1-The Phantom Menace&quot; video game, ( two, PC, one, PS), and I have seen  E1 nine  times. I hope that everyone can enjoy George Lucas' series as much as I and  my friends have.
B00002R0MC|4.0|An excellent box set. I feel the songs were chosen with thought, but I can think of songs that didn't make it, as well as songs that it didn't need. 3 PERFECT cd's would have been better...For example, where is Buffalo Soldier  on this? And the original mix of Stir it Up is mediocre compared to the  popular one. Still, all in all, this is a great box set (probably the best  of Marley's) and worth every cent.
B000002H38|5.0|Ms. Baker came out with a BANG with her first c.d. rapture! With songs like Sweet Love and the title track it is a true find! Her strong and opened voice will have you feeling the soul and emotions of every song!  There's also songs like Mystery and Same Ol Lovin that will have your blood  cooking on warm!So pop Rapture in your c.d. players or sing it your special  person, because it will keep your blood pumping!

0451524985|4.0|Lady Chatterley's Lover was an excellent book.  Lawrence depicts many aspects of mankind that were, at the time, way down on the &quot;d.l.&quot;  Constance found herself in a marriage with a cripled man incapable of  fulfilling any of her needs, intellectual and sexual.  She was once  inthralled by his hopelessly romantic philosophies of life, but grew to  find them shallow and superficial.  Her pity for Clifford was what held the  two together for so long, but Constance, over time, tired of playing house  wife, and ventured to find her contentment elsewhere.  She didn't have to  travel far.  Constance found her happiness on her very own property through  her manservant, thus began the scandalous affair the world has been talking  about ever since.
B000005J56|5.0|On a cold, blustery day driving through the small country town where I live in Pennsylvania, I couldn't care less about the -10 below zero weather, because I'm listening to Buena Vista Social Club.<br />The music is  so romantic, yet so subtle and so vibrant all at the same time.  When  Ibrahim Ferrer sings &quot;Dos Gardenias,&quot; you just yearn to be the  recipient of those two gardenias, to be the one told by him, as in the  song, that he loves and adores you.  I felt so swayed by the mellowness of  the sound and the elegance of how he sings it.<br />I was swept up by one one  song after another in this highly artisitic CD, in which each of the  artists adds something to the total rendition, and, at the same time, takes  energy and inspiration from all the other artists.  It's really amazing how  the music all comes together in song after song.<br />I remember growing up in  NYC in the 1950's how we were all caught up in Latin rhythms, especially  from Cuba.  Then Came Castro and the subsequent blackout from there.<br />How  wonderful to welcome these great artists and their marvelous music back in  this wonderful CD after such a long time away.
B000002LFZ|4.0|This album contains many of the charted singles Fleetwood Mac had in its Rumours lineup incarnation, but there were several that may or may not have been singles that could be worthy of a Greatest Hits Volume II - &quot;The  Chain,&quot; &quot;Second Hand News,&quot; &quot;Gold Dust Woman,&quot;  &quot;Love in Store,&quot; &quot;Sisters of the Moon&quot; from the Mirage  video... <br />I remain mystified at some of the choices for the album, such  as &quot;As Long As You Follow&quot; for one of two new songs on the album,  and I'm puzzled about &quot;Seven Wonders&quot; missing the cut. But, there  are plenty of timeless classics on this album (&quot;Rhiannon,&quot;  &quot;Dreams&quot; -their only US #1),&quot;Go Your Own Way,&quot; and  ESPECIALLY &quot;Gypsy&quot;).
B000003S5H|4.0|A rarity - French guys who know how to groove. At least on most of the tracks. Strays into questionable JoniMitchell/cheese territory on a couple of tracks, but definitely worth having. Lots of tasty analogue synth, moog,  etc.
057361461X|5.0|here is a play that truly is a little miracle. the script is so honest and touching in a way that almost anyone can relate to. i just saw the production on broadway with jayne atkinson and woody harrelson and  absolutely adored it. the whole cast has done wonders with these simple  words that Nash has written. it was a delightful production and i urge  everyone to read the script even if you cannot see a live production. you  will love it!
B00002MZ4V|5.0|This is not merely a CD of John Williams work, this is the apex of film music.  These works did not simply underscore the films they were written for- they illuminated them. Speaking as someone who OWNS most of the  soundtrack in which excerpts are offered I can still say that this is the  definitive recording in my collection.  Pieces recorded on soundtracks  twice (Jurrasic Park theme for instance) are still fresh and lively.   Themes from Schindlers List and Saving Private Ryan are still heart  wrenching.  This compilation is testement to Williams' creative genius-  rivaled by no other film composer EVER.  Bravo
B00000K31V|3.0|I have seen all of Cronenbergs movies, including the ones he made on filmschool, and usually I really like them (except from Crash). I'm a bit ambivalent towards this one.<br />The concept is good, biological gaming  consoles that are plugged into the spine. But the direction is a bit dull,  the story doesn't get anywhere and event the usual gory-like special  effects that Cronenberg likes seems a bit badly done. The gamingconsoles  look too much like plastic for me. Only the teethshooting gun was a really  inovative idea.<br />The acting is adequate, nothing one is impressed by. The  ending is a bit too confusing to good and its hard to keep the interest up  for the whole time. I would recommend people to see Videodrome instead, or  perhaps a movie by another director, like Dark City. This one is not  interesting enough.
0440234743|4.0|This book like most of Grisham's work is tightly wound about law.  This book is very hard to put down.  It grabs you from the beginning and keeps your attention throughout.  The only reason I didn't score this book with 5  stars is because the ending isn't as good as I had hoped.  It finished  well, don't get me wrong.  I was just hoping it would end differently.   You'll see what I'm saying upon reading it.
0312117337|5.0|I have read many people's tarot cards with the Osho Zen tarot, and they never cease being amazed with the insight it gives into their present feelings.  If they start with doubts, the accuracy of Osho's wisdom soon  makes them take notice. It is a great way to introduce Zen concepts to  somebody who is interested in seeking truth.   If you have read Osho  before, these will be effortless to interpret.  If you haven't read Osho  before....brace yourself, you ain't comin' back.
B00002MZ2C|1.0|Some of their political views are good, some barbaric like aborting fetuses.  Shame on you guys!
B00000IGGA|5.0|With this extravaganza Tom returns to true form intermixing his growls and snarls with the pulsing ,throbbing rhythms that people delighted to on &quot;Bone Machine&quot; along with numbers harking way back to his raspy  ballads of &quot;Heartattack and Vine&quot;.  &quot;Big in Japan&quot; gets things rolling with a  continuation of styles started on &quot;Bone Machine&quot;. Next he rolls  into &quot;Lowside of the Road&quot; ,which has the feel of what he was  attempting  on a portion of &quot;The Black Rider&quot; ,but was never  quite successful with.From this point on he flip-flops between old style  grit ballads to his later grooving dervishes backed by bluesy style  guitar.&quot;Cold Water&quot; instills the laughing ache of a man down on  his luck into your heart and gives you a feel of Tom's indomitable pizazz  throughout his long career.  Tom Waits is a pioneering poet amongst the  best of them. The ultimate storyteller, he is forever humorous and  interesting in his skidrow way. His songs often remind me of Charles  Bukowski.This one's certainly worth having. Not a dull moment to be found.
B000002NIW|5.0|this will always have a place in my collection for tracks like my last summer (shove it) and be quiet and drive. so i think you should buy it NOW because it is good
B00002MZ2C|5.0|When I first listened to this CD, I was hugely disappointed by the change in style by rage, and how their political messages were hidden more. I had only liked a few random songs on it and thought that ratm had made a  horrible mistake.   But then I listened to it again and realized that I  kinda liked a part of Tom Morello's great guitar rifts in every song.   Every time I listened to it I grew more satisfied with it to the point of  Evil Empire seeming as if it was just a cat in heat (It had been my  favorite CD).  &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot; is the BEST CD EVER  CREATED and shall always rule over every guitar strum(except of course the  Star Spangled Banner by Jimmi Hendrix) and has the best lyrics (performed  and written by Zach De La Rocha) ever.<br /> Buy it NO MATTER what, even if  you are stupid enough to hate music!
B00000K31Q|4.0|I think this is a superb movie for all teenagers.  Ledger and Stiles are absolutely fabulous and the witty dialogue will make you keel over.  Great cast and a hillarious plot make this a lobster-cracking movie!
B0000026NC|5.0|Along with the video, this is the best of Pink Floyd, a must buy for fans.  Every song is amazing and Scotty Page the sax player doesn't just play the sax, he makes love to it!
B000002N25|5.0|I have been a Mark Knopfler fan since the first notes of Sultans of Swing came across the radio in 1978. I've seen him in concert several times and have purchased every piece of music he's ever touched, including all the  Dylan pieces and The Notting Hillbillies.  I even have the hard-to-get  video of him doing songs of this album.<br />Golden Heart is clearly one of  his finest!  It's a classic!   It's all there:  the guitar, the voice, the  tight back-up, the songs. Everything you like about Mark Knopfler is on  this CD.<br />The first time I heard it I was in tears...before Darling Pretty  was even two verses along.  And since that time, I have made a point to  listen to this collection almost daily. (I even allude to this CD in the  amazon.com interview for my books.)<br />Here is my opinion:  BUY THIS CD!    If you are a Knopfler fan, this collection has it all!
B000005ITX|5.0|This is easily the American Sgt. Pepper,with all due respect to Pet Sounds.This is one of those cases where the original vinyl probably does sound better than the cd.Somebody really should do a remastering of this  lovely (sorry) album. There are many truly bad psychedelic records out  there,Forever Changes is one of the truly greats.Lyrics that are  inscrutable,guitars that slash and chime,and horn arrangements inspired by  (I swear) Herb Alpert's Tijuana Brass. Oh yeah,you gotta love a song that  starts out with our man Arthur cheerfully singing &quot;Oh the snot has  caked against my pants...it has turned into crystal...there's a bluebird  sitting on a branch...I think I'll take my pistol...&quot; Well you know  the rest.
B000002UBB|1.0|In the middle 1970's when this album was first released, it was all the rage. I could not understand why. As I listen to the tracks some 25 years later, my view hasn't changed. This is music for the masses: unremarkable  4-chord rock and roll with cliche' lyrics
6305428298|5.0|How did the Academy Awards miss this rich film?  Little Voice is yet another one of those quiet British gems with incredible performances and stunning writing.  Jane Horrocks is spellbinding as Laura &quot;L V&quot;  Hoff, who, since the death of her father, has been in a world of her own,  where the only way she can truly communicate is through impeccable  impersonations of the female singers on her father's old records.  With the  help of LV's mother (the impressive Brenda Blethyn), agent Ray Say, played  by Michael Caine, tries to turn her daughter's talent into showbiz fame and  fortune.  Don't miss this incredible movie!
0964385619|5.0|I have become a Rich Dad, Poor Dad, and CashFlow Quadrant believer and evangelist. Quite frankly, I couldn't put down either book and have undertaken the task of moving to the right side of the quadrant at  lightspeed. I've also recommended both books to friends, and purchased  copies of Rich Dad, Poor Dad for my teenage children. After reading  Robert's books, it's like a light bulb went off. I now &quot;GET IT&quot;,  and am in the process of trying to help others do the same. Thanks Robert  and Sharon for some lifechanging insights that go beyond the &quot;what to  do&quot; by simply and succinctly explaining &quot;how to do&quot; and  &quot;why to do&quot;.
B00000IPAX|4.0|I'd give this CD 4 out of 5 for having some awesome songs, writing their own songs, and playing their own instruments.  I would also give them 4 out of 5 because they're much better than Korn, Limp Bizkit.
6304428928|5.0|After viewing this film numerous times, I finally decided I must own a copy. If you're curious to know a bit about the real person who inspired the original story and screenplay, look for the book &quot;The Real Rain  Man: Kim Peek&quot; by his father, Fran Peek... available here at Amazon.  Kim is a savant with far more amazing abilities than were portrayed in the  film and who is not actually autistic but has a rare brain abnormality  called Agenesis of the Corpus Callosum, which my 3 year old daughter also  has. Dustin Hoffman met with Kim to prepare for his role in this fabulous  film.
6303022901|1.0|Obviously, Wang hasn't seen enough Chinese movies to know how poor the stereotyping is happening here. It's so sad I'd die in shame if this is how Chinese people in general are. Even my mother tell more honest story than  this. The part about life in China was SO BAD.<br />If you really want to know  Chinese people and Chinese parents, try &quot;To Live&quot; from Zhang  Yimou.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is the second best album from Peppers yet.  Blood Sugar Sex Magik is the must have album.  Californication gets better each time you listen to it and you cant get enough of it!
B000000W8C|4.0|For me, this album came out of nowhere.  After the 2nd rate Stone Roses schtick of &quot;A Storm In Heaven&quot;, this follow up did not hold much promise.  But, after constantly reading myriad proclamations of greatness  from the British music press (as they are known to do), I decided to give  this record a try.  About 30 seconds into opener &quot;A New Decade&quot;,  when the guitars epicly crash in over a bombastic drumbeat, I knew things  would be different this time around.  The album doesn't always ascend to  the big rock holy grail (a la U2), but at least it tries on virtually every  song and succeeds more often than not. The great improvement over the  previous record is the sound, direct and upfront, hitting you in your ear,  soul and gut.  This improvement can largely be traced to Owen Morris's  crisp, sonically enriched production- a vast improvement over John Leckie's  murky, muted work on &quot;Heaven&quot;.<br />Not quite as consistent as  &quot;Urban Hymns&quot;, but &quot;Soul&quot; very often hits higher highs.   An aspiring masterpiece that almost hits its mark.
B00000K0EA|4.0|For some, this film is the ultimate Bond film.  For others, it is amongst the worst.  For me, it was a decent film.  It wasn't anything special, really.  Amongst the great action sequences is a weak plot and  underwhelming villains and henchmen.  The whole time, I was thinking  &quot;how the hell could this plan work?&quot;
B000002UA5|5.0|What can I say. This is a true Pink Floyd album, and my personal favorite. The live CD is simply amazing. The version of A Saucerful of Secrets is the most epic PF song of all time. Atom Heart Mother comes in second, and  Echoes in third. The live disc gets 5 stars. The studio disc was hard to  swallow. However, repeated listens merits a phenomenal work by the band  (even if they didn't help each other to write the songs). The only song I  have to complain about it Grantchester Meadows. It doesn't fit that well.  Needs to be more abstract, more daring, more Pink Floyd. The studio disc  gets 5 stars. This is the best Pink Floyd album. I'm not a  &quot;stoner&quot; or &quot;druggie&quot; or whatever you want to call the  foolish people that think music is so much better on drugs. Buy this album.  Don't do drugs. You won't regret it.
B00000K19E|2.0|Along with Face/Off this is one over rated pilesof Hollywood garbage,instead of watching this painfull excuse of a movie rent out Dark City for basically the same plot premise but with alot more thought .
B000002C1X|2.0|Yes, Roger Waters wrote some good lyrics for the album. Yes, some of Dave Gilmour's guitar solos are fabulous. Yet, when The Wall is compared to earlier Pink Floyd works, some key Pink Floyd parts are missing: Inventive  and immersive music. The Wall is Pink Floyd's first rock album. All of the  works before that possibly had some rock feel, yet the music was simply  more creative and groundbreaking. Take, for instance, Atom Heart Mother.  The title suite is creative and amazing, and the other songs are great and  not completely rock-ish. Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast is original and well  constructed. That album is a Pink Floyd album. Animals is the final Pink  Floyd album. It has hints of the Pink Floyd sound still left. The Wall is  just a rock double CD. Sure, the songs flow together and the album has a  circular form. Come on. That was done before and much better with Dark Side  of the Moon. There are good lyrics, but definitely not the best. The Wall  has its high points, but ultimately, its just a standard rock album.
0800185269|5.0|David Lean and Peter O'Toole combined to produce one of the greatest character studies in cinema history. O'Toole captures the tortured mind of T.E. Lawrence, a man conflicted by personal ambition and a romantic image  of the Arab cause. While the historical accuracy of English involvement in  Arabian politics may be questioned, the depiction of one of history's most  complex characters is beyond reproach. Lawrence is at once a reflective  scholar, a reluctant warrior, and driven messiah. He is a man consumed by  personal drive, ego, and arrogance in the vortex of war.<br />The production  values of the movie are impeccable. The acting and direction are  outstanding; yet they pale before the cinematography and musical score. The  music and visual images blend together to portray the haunting beauty of a  vast, harsh, and unforgiving desert upon which this epic unfolds. This  movie is without peer, a masterpiece for the ages!
B000002H2H|5.0|i found this to be metallicas best album by far, especially because of the songs fade to black and the call of ktulu, fade to black revolves around kurt hammets great guitar, and hetfields singing the best of all metallicas  lyrics ,the call of ktulu is nearly nine minutes long ,but nine minutes  extremely well spent ,this song has layers, starting very soft and slowly  getting faster and finally at the end going back to the original soft  melody, besides these two great songs, songs like ride the lightning and  for whom the bell towls are also great.
B00000I14Z|5.0|when you hear goodbye pork pie hat,jelly roll etc.. on this album you have to be speechless.this man has so much quality in his work.i enjoy listening to this disc.nothing but genius.rich texture in the arrangements.Mr.Mingus  is one of the baddest cats the Jazz world ever knew.and for that matter the  music world at large period.
B000031XCR|5.0|Celine has done it again. What a talented singer she is!  Her voice is like an angel; and I for sure anxiously await her return to music after a must needed rest!  You never disappoint me Celine!
B00002MZ12|1.0|without the studio polish she sounds flat and the words are just there without any merit.how she blew up in the first place is over my head in the first place.she was more catchy doing the Paula Abdul thing.she should  stick to something lite and stay in the studio.
B00000J7S8|4.0|I heard Diana sing here at the Puerto Rican Heinken Jazz Fest two years ago for the first time. After that performance I became an avid fan. Diana Krall's when I look in your eyes, is such a wonderful CD, each song is so  masterly performed, with such sensuality like &quot;When I Look In Your  Eyes&quot;, &quot;Lets Face The Music and Dance&quot; and the bonus track  is such a gift, &quot;Why Should I Care&quot;, If you are a person who is  currently heart broken this song will finish you off. Buy this CD you will  love it, it is a must have for collectors.
B000002P5W|5.0|this album is a classic of styles&amp;ranges.Jimi Hendrix once again shows off the depth of his great talent.songs such as if 6 was 9,spanish castle magic,She's so fine and the beautiful little wing.music as well done as  this has no Labels.the rich tones of his playing still blow my mind.he was  ahead of his time.
B000001C6M|5.0|This is the best Slayer album ever.  Sure 'Reign in Blood' a great album but doesn't come close to 'Show No Mercy'.  This album sort of sounds like early Metallica but better!(in my opinion)  A personal favorite is  'Crionics'.  The guitar at near the end of the song is magnifiscent!  This  is truely the best thrash metal ablum of the 80's and Slayer is the one of  the greatest thrash metal groups today!
B0000024YL|5.0|these are essential songs.they are timeless songs as well.Mrs.Robinson,Bridge over trouble water,Cecilia etcc..Simon &amp;Garfunkel are one of the most important duos ever.
B00003XB8K|3.0|Enigma 4 begins with a tribute to the most celebrated work of contemporary classical pop culture... O Fortuna from the opera [[ASIN:B000003CSM Carl Orff: Carmina Burana]].  It's heard everywhere in films like Excalibur and The Doors, to the underground techno-rave band Apotheosis who was the first to \\"innaugurate\\" the dance culture remixing and sampling of the pop opera -  so much so, in fact, that their techno remix of O Fortuna was incidentally pulled from dance compilation albums over copyright infringements.  It seemed only natural that label-backed Enigma would inevitably do its take on it, having formulated its signature style on choral sampling and Gregorian chant layered over hip-hop break beats in  three previous successful albums.  \\"The Gate\\" opens with the  familiar \\"Voice of Enigma\\" whose narrative has evolved from  meditation and relaxation technics to scientific astrological computations  about the solar system and prepare you for a transcendent cosmic journey and crossfades magnificently into a primal sample lifted from O Fortuna  whose familiar chorus will strike a subconscious, primordial nerve and send  a shudder down your spine.  The Orf motif is reworked interestingly throughout several tracks thereafter, composing the memorable melody of  \\"The Gravity of Love\\" and \\"Modern Crusaders,\\" but the motif dissipates quickly, replaced  by Enigma's insistent melodic joy and upbeat ambient splendor that clashes  against the epic choral statements set precedent by the opening track.  I  found myself reaching for Enigma 2: The Cross of Changes and inserting it  into my CD player to redeem the O Fortuna theme with a reprise of Enigma's  best choral composition to date; The Eyes of Truth.  What could have been  Enigma's most interesting thematic album fizzles into lackluster sleepy  time ambience for the insomnially challenged.  The Screen Behind The Mirror as a whole comes across as something of an epilogue to their 3 previous albums.  One only wonders how much longer the chemistry of choral break-beat mixing and ambient techno can sustain its cultural appeal before becoming as redundant and passe as the synth-generated, eighties-sounding  electronic beats themselves.much longer the chemistry of choral break-beat mixing and ambient techno can sustain its cultural appeal before becoming as redundant and passe as the synth-generated, eighties-sounding  electronic beats themselves.
B000000OF6|4.0|this is all you really need by Queen.they were Hit&amp;miss on there albums and this compilation puts everything into perspective.the first song Bohemian Rhapsody is everything that is Queen good &amp;cleaver on many  levels  taking bits&amp;pieces here and there full of themselves and yet  interesting enough to make you listen.they always had that right hook or  beat that got your attention.but this is all you will ever need from this  group.
B0000025RI|5.0|I really can't believe Mr Michael Jackson has a new album out. Boy!, its going to feel like 1979,1982,1987 and 1991 allover again. Its fantastic! <br />Alwaleed
B0000296SI|4.0|This CD is awesome. I listen to it alot especially The Party Song.But the CD is so short (35 Minutes).
6305657939|5.0|Great movie.  Keeps you on the edge of your chair.  We had to watch it twice to get all the details.  Wonderful adventure.  Two thumbs up!
1853260002|5.0|This is my favourite book of all time. Not only are the characters perfectly sculpted into lifelike images (both charming and deceitful), but the romance is original, heart warming and honest. Darcy is not only  dashing, but mysterious and compelling. Elizabeth is simply charming and  delightfully strong willed. The supporting characters are simply wonderful;  the mother's sillyness to Wickham's deceitfullness, Miss Bingley's almost  comical bitterness to the absurb notion that Darcy could ever marry Lady  Catherine's pitiful daughter. It all comes together to make the most  wonderful book of love, social commentary and humour. I read this in one  weekend-I couldn't put it down. If you have never read a  &quot;classic&quot; and love romance read this. It'll charm your socks  off!
B00000IAU3|5.0|I am extremely happy to actually see a new artist with substance.  Someone with thoughtful lyrics and a soothing beautiful voice.  Let me just tell you every song on this album is worth your money.  How many albums can you  say that about?  I have also introduced all of my friends to this album and  they love me for it.  I am looking forward to seeing her live real soon.   BRAVO to this artist.
B000002J09|5.0|Led Zeppelin almost single handedly saved Rock and Roll.  The Beatles break up was a done deal when this album was put out.  With out Jimmy Page's screaming guitar and John Bonham's pounding drums we would have been  stuck with ABBA forever.<br />The Beatles cut ties with conventional music  with their albums such as (#2 all-time on my list), &quot;The White  Album.&quot;  They went their own way - did their own thing.  Led Zeppelin  followed in their footsteps.  In their own right, Zeppelin gave birth to:   Pearl Jam, Metallica, Nirvana.<br />They are the second greates band with the  greatest album.  Long live &quot;Runes.&quot;
6305075468|5.0|We are lucky to see &quot;Nosferatu&quot;; All copies were to be destroyed in 1923. &quot;Nosferatu&quot; was the product of plagerism, and an unlawful and (at the time) uncredited movie version of Bram Stoker's  &quot;Dracula&quot;. Stoker's widow sued the movie producers, they went out  of business and the court ordered all copies of the film to be destroyed.  Fortunately for us, copies were moused away and it is from these reels that  we can see, what is considered the first horror film.<br />Nosferatu's  horrific reputation is unchanged today; The sight of the vampire (Max  Schreck) is every bit as grotesque now as it's ever been. The story is  familiar Dracula, however the genesis of German film expressionism is  clearly engrained; Nosferatu was one of a handful of films that changed the  industry and made people think in ways that were never explored  before.<br />The music score of this DVD is wonderful pipe-organ music  composed from many early-19th century compositions. It's crafting  completely compliments the story and adds not only tonal accuracy, but also  a believable thread that brings us closer to the time of the film's  creation.<br />But the unexpected hit of this DVD is the audio commentary  track from Lokke Heiss, and expert on German films. Heiss's commentary is  absolutely compelling and points out many similarities that the average  viewer wouldn't easily pick out. In fact, I would recommend watching the  movie with the organ score, and immediately watching it with the commentary  so &quot;see&quot; all the parts you may have initially missed.<br />The DVD  transfer is about as good as you can get, understanding that it all came  from smuggled copies. The film is also 're-tinted', a film technique that  provides different exposure colors to express changes is daytime or  location.<br />I highly recommend this DVD to all silent fans, and anyone who  wants to see a peice of history, as well as get an excellent historical and  documentary analysis.
B0000029GA|5.0|Illmatic is one of the best hiphop albums released. Hits such as The World is Yours, One Love, and the rest of the album gives us memories of the old nas.
0425170349|5.0|Truly, Rainbow Six was a joy to read.  It gives incredible insight into the world of counter terrorism, along with the thrill and excitement of seeing the units, clad in body armor rush into the heat of battle.  Rarely  do I ever read books of such length, however, I wish it was longer.  It was  sad to see the words THE END.
B00003W8NM|5.0|How do I begin to review the book that has now defined my life?  I first thank Chuck for writting this amazing novel.  For taking us off the repeditive path of human existance and giving us another view of our  monotony.  We sell ourselves every day to images, attitudes, and worst of  all our posessions.  This movie is incredible from opening to credits.  The  one last thing I must include is that every time I have been to the theater  to see Fight Club, the hipocritical audiance has laughed and very obviously  loved the honest humor in the begining of the film.(especially the fight  with the priest)  However as soon as the movie reaches climax the brutal  truth behind the movie is revealed and it leaves the audiance naked and not  laughing.  The simple realization that this movie is making fun of everone  in the audiance. This is pure Genius.  This movie might not be considered  at the Oscars, but not because it is bad.  It is because we all know how  much truth it holds and that particular academy is too fake to give credit  where it is due.  GO SEE THIS MOVIE..with an open mind.  It is not about  fighing like the commercials and half brained humas think.  Look deeper and  see the self realization we all need.  STOP buying brand label clothes and  expensive furiture.  Make a list of everything you have ever wanted to do  and everything you are scared to death of and do everything on both lists.   Once you truely understand fear, you will never fear anything again.   Everything you love dies.  Dealing with death is the core to all our  doughts, self hate, lonliness.  Live life how you want.  Just do it for  you!  This book is an opening to paradise as you see it!
0374250332|5.0|In the early '80s, I was to graduate from school and got interested in flying for the US Navy.  My mother sent a copy of T. Wolfe's book hoping to sway my dangerous intent and take a 'real' job.  WRONG.  About 9 months  later I was soloing over Corpus Christi Bay and on my way to flying Navy  jets.<br />Wolfe has written an epic that spans from the early days of  flight test through the beginning of the US manned space program. It will  increase the heart rate of aviators, aviation buffs and armchair  pilots/astornauts.  I highly recommend that anyone remotely interested in  aviation/space read this book.  While it may not be accurate to the  smallest detail, the overall scope and feel for a era gone by can never be  or has ever been captured in the history books.<br />Regarding Gus Grissom,  new facts are coming to light that  will clear his reputation.  Wolfe does  hammer Gus in the book about what was known at the time Wolfe wrote  &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;.  However, all the research and reading that I  have done,  Gus was probably the smartest engineer and best test pilot of  the M-7 astronauts .  He had a reputation of being a real nuts and bolts  engineer and a hard nose pilot.  He could handle any situation while flying  experitmental aircraft or on the ground discussing craft/engine design with  NASA's engineers.  If any one has ever seen the old NASA films of the  Apollo program, when Gus is doing the radio tests on that fateful day, he  really gives the engineers hell from the capsule  owing to poor  communication on the radios &quot;Jesus Christ, we can't talk between three  building, how the hell are we going to talk on the moon.&quot;  Classic  Gus.  Ironically, when Apollo One caught fire moments later, the hatch was  redesigned not to repeat the same incident that happened to Gus in Liberty  Bell 7 - and Gus, Chaffee and White paid the ultimate price.<br />Read this  book.  It is one of the best books I have ever read and was a real  inspiration during my Navy days and beyond.<br />Bondo
0425107469|4.0|Dean Koontz has the magic ability to take a concept that sounds totally unrealistic, and write it in a  way that it sounds like it could actually happen. He managed to do that with this book, making a super-intelligent  dog and a perfectly-designed warrior with emotional rage issues entirely  believable. The only not entirely enjoyable part of this novel is the  hitman that sucks energy from his victims, who is portrayed badly. I  reccomend this book to people who enjoy other books by Koontz, especially  Mr. Murder. Creature and Guardian, both by John Saul, are also very similar  and just as good stories.
B000031XCR|5.0|If you are just getting started on Celine Dion, this is the best CD to get. . . .it has her oldies but goodies, and also some new hits.  I like &quot;That's the Way it Is,&quot; but my favorite has become &quot;Then You  Look at Me&quot;.  Don't be thrown off by the opening instrumentals. . .the  song is beautiful. . .it's a good wedding song.  You'll also want to check  out her final song on the album, &quot;Live.&quot;  It almost sounds like  it's from a musical.  You're definitely not wasting your money with this  CD.
0393307050|5.0|I have read a lot of novels in a lot of different genres (mostly classics, mysteries and thrillers) but this is one of the most entertaining novels I have ever read.  The characters are interesting and three-dimensional, the  action is exciting and realistic and, as if that wasn't enough, the book is  very humorous at times.  I don't profess to be an expert on what life was  like in the Royal Navy two hundred years ago, but it all sure seems very  realistic.  It is true that this is not the most profound of books (I  wouldn't put him in the same catagory as Dostoevesky, Balzac or Falkner)  but it sure was entertaining.  I will admit that it does start a little  slow, but if you stick with it you will be richly rewarded.  Also, if you  don't understand sailing terminology, it is helpful to learn some of it.  I  found a great web site that defines just about any sailing term you want to  know.  Anyway, I loved this book and I am going to read more of this  series.
B00005K3NR|5.0|...as Mrs. Snell would say, in regard to the many five-stars for this movie. And why not? It's simply the best high school movie ever made, besides being a horror classic, and there are so many classic moments among the character interactions that it's almost besides the point that this is one of the scariest films ever made (although dePalma stole the great closing bit with the hand from John Boorman's \\"deliverance,\\" and the split-screen effect doesn't really work for the prom sequence). One of the things I love about the movie is that you're never really sure, even by the end, how far the conspiracy went: why do Tommy and Sue keep signalling to each other and smirking in the scene with Betty Buckley if they're really on Carrie's side? Finally, it's got some of the best gallows humor ever: from Carrie's telekinetic pushing adie of her mother before the prom (as she nervously, sadly explains why she's going to go no matter what her mother thinks), to the beginning sequence with the principal who keeps calling her \\"Cassie,\\" to the great push-up sequence with the girls in the gym class. Watch it over and over again--it's worth it.

B000003TA4|5.0|In the 80s, alternative music had, basically, three mediums to which fans could turn -- college radio, underground music clubs, and word of mouth.  MTV was preoccupied with spinning mousse-abuse new metal bands, and lighter  fare, and alternative was relegated to its midnight program, '120  Minutes...' that is, until this particular band just COULDN'T be ignored.   The 90s *really* began with a scream -- and musical, visual and social  orders shifted seemingly overnight -- with the worldwide exposure of  Nirvana's &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; from this disc.   Lyricist/vocalist/guitarist Kurt Cobain proved he understood and could  represent his generation's mood just as deftly as Lennon/McCartney had  tapped into their own.  &quot;Here we are, now entertain us,&quot; Cobain  wryly challenged, on behalf of (and in mocking disgust with) disaffected  youth, and the media scrambled to make sense of it all (and then to  capitalize on terms like grunge, slacker, and Generation X, until even  those in the genre got tired of the spin... some, like Cobain, with  disasterous results.)  &quot;Nevermind&quot; ranks among the most powerful,  harrowing and compelling rock recordings ever made.  Cobain explores  frustration, boredom, and narcissism in an often gallows humor fashion, and  time taken to explore the lyrics will reveal a poet at work.  The  alternative artists of the 80s and early 90s, whose best chances for  exposure were to create their own labels and handle their own marketing --  prior to Nirvana having been snapped up from Sub Pop, by Geffen, thus  opening up the alternative market to radio and MTV -- are the forefathers  of today's net-savy up-and-comings. Any musician or listener interested in  the progression of popular music owes it to themselves to pay much  attention to this disc; it's one of those rare and true watersheds of rock  &amp; roll.  For those who are curious, but still hesitant because you  believe Cobain's angst is all this band is about, don't be fooled:  all  three musicians understood the value of a good hook, and there's more  melody going on, here, than initially meets the ear.  The bass lines of  Chris Novoselic provide real counterpoint to the guitar and vocals, and the  exciting powerhouse drumming of Dave Grohl (now of Foo Fighter fame) is  tightly controlled, every kick, slam and roll adding a third voice to the  mix.  Parents, teachers, or local leaders experiencing teen problems in the  home or community will want to listen closely:  &quot;Nevermind&quot; was  released in 1991, and Cobain's messages about the effects of  disillusionment, on youth, are reflected in the headlines of today.  You'll  be enlightened as you discover what's still on some young minds, and why.
B00001QEE5|5.0|Old Disney...when Walt was alive set a precedent that was distroyed by many films until Lion King.
B00000J8EK|5.0|What do you do when everyone tries to sound like you? What no one would expect, that's what. The Chemical Brothers' third album &quot;Surrender&quot; recaptures the same vibe they found mining old-school  hip hop on the &quot;Loops of Fury&quot; EP, only this time they find it in  mid-1908s house. And, midway through the disc, you'll find some of the most  adventurous psychedelic electro-pop ever assembled--even a collaboration  with Mazzy Star's Hope Sandoval that'll leave you feeling buzzed all day  long.<br />With the Chems forsaking their trademark block-rockin' beats for  the traditional 4/4 of the dance floor, it shouldn't come as that much of a  surprise to anyone who bought DJs Tom Rowlands and Ed Simon's mix album  &quot;Brothers Gonna Work It Out&quot;--this is just the boys going back to  their roots here. Only, instead of simple club-ready retreads, they lay  down some impressive sonics that simultaneously seem dated and futuristic,  familiar yet not too accessible. Even the blatant Beatlemania of &quot;Let  Forever Be,&quot; with Oasis's Noel Gallagher, is forgivable since it's  such a wonderful reminder of what these three did when they attacked us  with that trippy ditty &quot;Setting Sun&quot; two years ago.<br />The Chems  fancy themselves as album-making artists, not merely single-pressing DJs.  At the expense of underground credibility, what the Chems have done here is  bold and enticing. Track after track unfolds almost delicately, without the  industrial onslaught of &quot;Exit Planet Dust&quot; or the heavy funk of  the gold-selling &quot;Dig Your Own Hole.&quot; The bottom line is, any  Chem album is going to be bliss, but this time they've created something  that absolutely commands repeated listenings to fully appreciate--that's  not a chore, but a gift that keeps on giving.<br />Alas, one small complaint:  &quot;Out of Control,&quot; a collab with New Order's Bernard Sumner, is  the only cut that's out of place here--it sounds a lot like one of New  Order's weaker cuts, &quot;Fine Time.&quot; Since this session was released  as a single anyway, it would've been a wiser marketing and arranging move  to keep it off the album--since it's lumped in with other, more  mature-sounding tracks, the song just comes off as dull. Still, a small  price to pay for such otherwise crafty and creative, pop-based musicmaking.
B000002A3T|2.0|I have all of PF's official releases, lots of individual solo works, and plenty of imports......The Division Bell is not Pink Floyd....I have the impression that this album is three dudes and a hoard of studio men/record execs attempting to sound like what they think \\"Pink Floyd\\" is  supposed to sound like.....it is unfortunately musically bland at best, and  the lyrics without Roger are mostly lightweight cheese.  Gilmour's guitar  is still true, and some of the instrumental passages are ok, but it is a  shame that this albumm bears the name of the band that has released so many  classics in their time....Formulaic Drivel....I ended up giving it away;  sad, eh?.
B000001ESP|5.0|How is this possible? How can a mere three men write and perform such an incredible display of sheer technical skill combined with exceptionally clever lyrical ability? This is the epitome of musicianship, the greatest  album ever in the history of mankind. Peart's intelligent, original lyrics  sung in Geddy's deliciously unique voice spew forth, soon to melt into an  awe-inspiring solo from Lifeson. The sheer difficulty and complexity of the  music combined with mind-numbing speed is amazing. It may not be the most  difficult, fast, or complex music ever recorded, but it's pretty damn  close. Not even Rush can top this, and if they do, my head will explode  from sheer delight.

0780622553|5.0|Not a movie fan, but this definitely is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Great special effects, awesome soundtrack, great unique story line, very suspensful.<BR> People are comparing this movie with Blade Runner or  Matrix, etc... Hey, they're all Sci-Fi movies, what do you think?<BR> This  is picture of the year! Should have been nominated for Best Picture.
0887307280|2.0|Gerber makes a few very insightful points in this book, especially early on. However, as he progresses they become fewer and more obscure. He gradually deteriorates into a new age/zen rhapsody and becomes increasingly  unclear, inconsistent, and wrong. Even some of his more lucid points  require hard swallowing or careful synthesis. He then closes with a poorly  veiled plug for hiring his e-institute to fill in the blanks, which have  mushroomed by then.
0385472951|5.0|I love the book, but I hate end ending.  It's not that it's written poorly.  It's just disappointing.  I wanted him to fly off into the sunset with his huge bank account in hand and his lover in the other.  But I guess  we don't always get what we want, do we?

6305263248|3.0|People are chasing and shooting each other. Why exactly? Something to do with a box that the Irish and the Russions want.

B00000JCB2|5.0|Ah yeah LIMP BIZKIT when I first heard it , it totaly blow me away how they could mix rap with rock and still keep it strong and if U don't like rap Limp Bizkit will make you like it .There is one fact to accnoledge if  you like the rock of this album you should deffinatly get there first  3$bill ya'all album cause it is more hard rock than this one . Limp is  definatly NOT for pop fans for this my friend but for the strong minded OH  and by the way for all the other reviewers that say how fred can't write  don't blame it all on fred cause the hole band makes the songs and fred can  write very cool lyricts .
0440211727|4.0|Wow. This was the first Grisham book I have read and I loved it. I had seen the movie when it came out and liked it, but now it pales in comparison. Admittedly, the character of Ellen Roark could have had more  depth, but I have few complaints about this book. THe protagonist was not a  wimpy, touch-feely hero, he had some serious quirks in his nature. His  arrogance and haughtiness made him a much more believable character. I have  read other books by Grisham but this one was the best.

0385421982|5.0|It's a great book, just a little impropable.  I mean, anythings possible, but what are the chances of two supreme court justices being murdered for such a reason.  And Darby being able to guess why.  She'd have to be in on  it to be able to know that conspiracy.
0812551508|5.0|I was required to read this book for my senior Humanities class recently.  The instant that I began reading this book I became totally enthralled. I would go well beyond the assigned chapter yearning to know what would  happen next.  The characters are very well developed and you are able to  feel what Victor and the monster feel.Readers should keep in mind that this  book was written in the 1800's. So, if you're looking for chainsaw  slashing, blood, and gore, look elsewhere. But, if you're looking for a  classic novel of intelligence, love, alienation, and desperation-this is  the book for you!
B00002MZ2T|2.0|People, people, please! Are your lives so on edge that you can be so uncritically accepting of this musical version of prozac? Sure these guys have okay singing voices, but that's about it. The lyrics here are more or  less at the Hallmark card level of profundity, the melodies are unoriginal,  and the production is slick, glossy, and bothersome. All in all, this is  nothing more than an occasionally pretty bundle of schlock.
0786220023|5.0|This book is essential reading for everyone thinking of moving to America or for those who have already moved here from Overseas (especially from England).  It provides an accurate but hilarious view on how outsiders see  America and what you should expect to meet when you live here.
B000002NJS|5.0|Madonna always satisfies her fans' need for great music.  This album is definitely her best work (though all of her previous albums are incredible too).  &quot;Frozen,&quot; &quot;Power of Goodbye,&quot; &amp;  &quot;Skin&quot; are some of my favorite songs on the cd. A+
038542471X|5.0|I love Grisham's books.  I don't think he's written a disappointing one, yet, unlike most authors.  Great story with an even better ending. Bravo...
B00000IO4J|4.0|I found that while this movie did have a typical plot for a horror movie, they did a great job at keeping everything a secret.  If you're looking for a good horror flick (with way too much cussing), this is for you.  You do  learn the plan the kids make early on, and of course it's the only way that  the movie could end.  However, I was surprised to discover who the queen  that the kids had to defeat was.  I must say that I enjoyed it though.
B000001ESN|5.0|With Permanent Waves, Rush finally reached the perfect balance between self-indulgence and accessbility in their music. The past two albums, A Farewell To Kings and Hemispheres, while both outstanding works and leaps  forward for the band commercially, gave us brief glimpses of the balance in  the shorter pieces (&quot;Closer To The Heart&quot;, &quot;Cinderella  Man&quot;, &quot;Circumstances&quot;, &quot;The Trees&quot;), yet the  longer pieces (&quot;Xanadu&quot;, &quot;Cygnus X-1&quot;,  &quot;Hemispheres {Cygnus X-1, Part II}&quot;, and the instrumental  &quot;La Villa Strangiato&quot;) were often too indulgent and bloated, thus  slightly dragging down the albums as a result.       Here, for the first  time, Rush proved they could write complex songs with tight melodies  (&quot;The Spirit of Radio&quot;, &quot;Freewill&quot;, &quot;Entre  Nous&quot;), keep them within five minutes, yet still indulge when the  occasion permitted (check out the middle section of &quot;Freewill&quot;  for a great example), plus keep the longer pieces (the 7 minute  &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; and the 9 minute &quot;Natural Science&quot;)  from straying too far into individual over-indulgence during the  instrumental passages.  On &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot;, during the two long  instrumental breaks (before and after the final verse during the song's  midpoint), you can really hear how Lee, Lifeson, and Peart, while each  performing complex parts in the music, play with each other as opposed to  over the other, thus keeping the melody tight and making each of their  personal embellishments work that much more effectively. And &quot;Natural  Science&quot; also works just as well, for it is essentially three short  songs written as one, with the lyrics linked to a central theme (the  environment and our place in it), which keeps the overall piece from  becoming too ponderous.     This is an excellent beginning purchase, for it  represents Rush at the beginning of the strongest phase oftheir career,  proved by the overwhelming success of Moving Pictures, and, to a slightly  lesser degree, Signals.  These three albums are the essential pieces,  though I would also recommend Grace Under Pressure, while it is a  transtional record (and very underrated by many Rush fans), is still strong  melodically and is well worth checking out.
0767819594|5.0|This movie is awesome.  The way that Kathryn and Sebastian use each other.  Then when Sebastian falls in love Kathryn taunts him about it.  And then when Sebastian is killed and Annette makes copies of His Cruel intentions  journal and gives it out the day of his funeral it is revenge.  Aneete sees  her in the bathroom and acts like she doen't know who she is and then bam  she's taken down by annette and cecile.  I have seen it 10 times.
B000002VMH|5.0|This album means so much to me on so many levels I won't begin to mention them all here.  Suffice it to say Annie Lennox is both auto-biographical and universal with every sentiment on this record.  The songs are all  hummable, some even danceable, but mostly they evoke SOMETHING on every  listen.  If you have ANY doubts, cast them aside.  This is a brialliant  record.
0440234743|4.0|It's a good book, but he's done a lot better.  I like the main characters transformation.  The first chapter is very funny, but it definately goes down hill from there.  But, at least the money-grubbing, gold-digging  family get what they deserve.
B000002G0P|5.0|See those five stars up there? They're not around just `coz I'm an Extreme fan - this album is DEFINITELY one of the best the rock world has produced. You don't LISTEN to this album, you EXPERIENCE it. No other band has ever  been this varied - from orchestra music (orchestrated by the one and only  Nuno Bettencourt) through soul-searching ballads (with, surprisingly for an  extremely funky rock band, spiritual themes) to absolutely EXCELLENT  out-n-out rock. Extreme's music is so ferquently called &quot;funk  rock&quot;, and they're compared to the Red Hot Chili Peppers - hehe, they  couldn't be more different. I don't think you could possibly classify  Extreme's music - it reaches out to everyone, with AMAZING (though  understated) guitar, Gary Cherone's prehensile (?) voice, and the overall  ambeicne that only Extreme provides. WHAT an album. All I can say is...Wow!
B00000DGUG|4.0|At first I din't like this album, I gave it a listen but then I found that all it seemed to be was depressing song after depressing song. Then after a few listens, I realised how wrong I was. This is a great album, Alanis  Morissette has one of the best voices in rock - no one sounds like her. The  songs are strong, and they vary. Some of them being quiet, sad songs,  others being loud and full of emotion. There is a mixture. It's a lot  deeper than Jagged Little Pill, with fewer songs that could be singles. In  my opinion it's better. Instant standout tracks are Thank U, Front Row, UR,  Joining You (my personal favourite). Later other tracks such as Can't Not,  One, Would Not Come, I was Hoping begin to standout. The music is  excellenty written. The lyrics become a little too intellectual at times,  but mostly they are deep and enjoyable. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone  that hates Jagged Little Pill, but if you liked it,then get this. Also fans  of Sheryl Crow, Jewel, PJ Harvery with definitely appreciate this album
6305524866|5.0|Four Weddings and a Funeral is charming, romantic, cute, funny, touching and superb. I have never seen a better movie, Hugh Grant gave a magnificent performance, as did the rest of the talented cast. This movie is  light-hearted, and one everyone can understand and love, if I could give  this movie ten stars I would gladly do so. You have to see this film.
B000000NN1|5.0|I first was exposed to Vangelis at the age of 4, when the series, Cosmos, first aired. I remember being entranced by not only the show, but the story told thru the music, Later, at the age of 7, my father gave me the tape to  listen to, for I could not sleep... I found myself drawn into a fantastic  journey of sound and song, from the madness of Hell to the heights of  Heavan. In my mind, as I closed my eyes, I was thrown into images and  stories beyond my comprehension at the time. Now, I am much older, but I  still shiver with the power and the pain of this music everytime I hear it.  I still get goosebumps when I listen to So Clear. I encourage you to buy  this CD, to feel the pleasure and the pain and the subtelties of not only  great music, but also the nuances of the human spirit
0688156819|5.0|I saw this book at the mall and absolutley had to have it! I begged my mom to get it for me, and like she promised, she did! I was so excited that I could barely rip the plastic off of the cover! I immediatly forgot about  the rest of my presents and ran up to my room to read it! I was so happy! I  loved it the moment I opened it!I never doubted that it would be good  though.(I couldn't look at it in the store because it was wrapped in  plastic.) If you are a fan of Tim Burton, or are just discovering him, this  is a GREAT book. I would definatly recommend it!
0871137380|5.0|Outstanding! I couldnt put it down and have tried to get everyone I know to read it. This is a book about soldiers, ordinary Americans, who to me this country does not give their just due.  This book is an intense account  of the human struggle against seemingly insurmountable odds.  This a book  about REAL American heros (instead of the celebrity heroes that are created  on TV and the media, ie. who describe Micheal Jordan as a courageous hero  because he played a basketball game when he had the flu!)The story of the  American soldiers in this book will make you proud to be an American.  The  US politician actions during this time will make you ashamed to be an  American.  Pride, anger and maybe even vengeance is what you will feel  after reading this book.  I only wish it could have ended with the  Americans pulling out of Mogadishu and then 48 hours of nonstop B-52  bombing strikes on the entire city.  For me, the book shows that this  society didnt deserved to be saved.

B00000K19E|4.0|Yes, there are some parts of the story that don't make sense (if they just need a body for the energy it produces, what's wrong with dogs or cows?)  But to hell with that, it's still a very, very fun ride, and I'll watch it  many times. As to technical problems; it appears that the problems are with  the players.  This disc is one of the few to exercise this many features in  the DVD standard, and some players (particularly older ones) can't handle  it.  My advise?  Buy this disc and see if your player can handle it, and if  it can't, get the maker to fix it; this would be a &quot;quality of  workmanship&quot; error, since the disc DOES MEET THE DVD SPEC.  Worth the  price just to make sure your player is up to snuff.  (FWIW, I think any new  player can handle it).
0026009102|5.0|Excellent draft on Objectivism. A modern day BIBLE for people who believe in themselves and have a mission in life.

B000023VR6|5.0|This cd is one of the few cd's i can i actually listen to straight through and love almost every song.  It is truly a piece of art.  It sounds west coast and classic dre. If you pick up any cd this is the one to get first.  I guarantee you'll be getting your moneys worth.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I purchased MCMXCad and listened to it daily for two years.  I purchased The Cross of Changes and listened to it for a week.  I purchased LReMVlR and listened to it for a month.  While my MCMXC disc is too scratched to  play and my other two gather dust in the other room, I anticipate that this  album will be on hand for a good long time to come.<br />At last, Cretu has  another album that rivals his MCMXC; Finally, another album with the  enthralling complexity and flowing power.  I applaud his creative ability  and courage for the two intervening disasters, but dearly hope that he will  stick with the format to which he's returned.<br />This album is absolutely  wonderful.  The use of Carmina Burana - just the best parts - is of course  perfect, and it blends well with the modern  sounds within which it's  layered.<br />A treat for the ears, and well worth the long wait.  I'm glad to  see Cretu returning to the gorgeous and very successful format of the  Enigma I know and love.

B00000K19E|5.0|The MATRIX synthesizes works classical, biblical, and contemporary into a whole that is much more than the sum of its parts. It is derivative of many works, both cinematic and literary, including a theme from  &quot;Terminator&quot; and &quot;Colossus, the Forbin Project,&quot; with a  twist on the &quot;Star Trek&quot; holodeck, thrown together with Blade  Runner, the Bible, several works of Shakespeare, William Gibson's cyberpunk  style, Nietzsche, Buddha, Star Wars, Men In Black, and, visually and and  with a hint of humor, &quot;Bill and Ted's Excellent  Adventure.&quot;<br />Excellent gunfights, high tech slamming, and kick  boxing. Why isn't there a car chase?<br />All of these elements lead to  enjoyment for the viewer, albeit in a philosophically confused state. Most  importantly, however, the movie calls into question the nature of reality  for those who normally never question the meaning of their  existence.<br />There is one fundamental flaw in the movie, however, which  anyone familiar with thermodynamics will readily perceive. I leave it as an  exercise to the student.
B00003XB8K|5.0|As always Enigma has done it again. Sounds like no other. I can wake up to it or go to sleep to it or just relax on a lazy after noon. I can even play it with friends or family as backoud music while conversing and it always  creates thought.
B000001ELL|4.0|Disco was huge at the time and KISS would explore the genre with &quot;I was made...&quot; and &quot;Sure know something&quot;.  These are both cool songs.  Ace Frehley's version of the Stones' &quot;2000 man&quot; is also a  highlight.  This album always gets a bad rap and many say that it marks the  official &quot;selling out&quot; of KISS.  That term is always funny to me,  when used with celebrities.  Its like fans think that their favorite  celebrites are these honest, perfect, &quot;not in it for the money&quot;  decent folks.  KISS makes great music and have an inventive style, who  cares what business deals or creative choices they make.  The only down  fall of this record is that Peter Criss has all but left the group at this  point, only playing on &quot;Dirty Livin'&quot;.  The rest of the record  has Anton Fig on drums.  If you can stand a little disco and deal with the  fact that one of the members hardly performed on this record, buy it.  Most  importantly, hear it for yourself.
6305095442|3.0|Evil Dead 2: Dead by Dawn is played for laughs, so anybody expecting scares should steer back.  But if it's dark humor you're looking for, this could be a film you might enjoy.<br />For anybody whose seen The Evil Dead,  this film is basically a remake of that film, only even more outrageous  with a bigger budget.  If you've seen the first film, you'll recall that  Ash (Bruce Campbell) was the only survivor of the massacre in the cabin  after the evil dead was awoken from the chants uttered from the  Necronomicon.  He has to board himself up inside the cabin, hold off any  demons plus his dead girlfriend with a shotgun and chainsaw.  Eventually he  receives help from some visitors and they must all battle the spirits in  the woods.<br />At a short 85 minutes it's reasonable to expect this movie to  move at a fast pace, and for the first half of the movie it does.  There's  plenty of hilarious situations in those 45 minutes such as when Ash is  attacked by the head of his girlfriend and when his own hand is possessed  by a demonic force.  This isn't particularly scary but it's fun to watch.   However, the second half of the movie doesn't live up to the great set up.   When the four visitors arrive, the movie then turns into a by the numbers  routine where the body count starts to rise and any sort of humor is almost  absent by then.  In the last fifteen minutes it seemed the movie was  redeeming itself, and for a while it did.  The scene with Ash going down  the basement to look for the pages of the Necronomicon with a witch  somewhere down there is thrilling to watch.  However, the last five minutes  are utterly bad, but to be fair I'll cut the filmmakers some slack since  the end did set up for the superior Army of Darkness.<br />Some have stated  the special effects and the direction are the reason to watch Evil Dead 2,  but that's not so.  Most will agree with me that Bruce Campbell is the real  reason to watch this film.  He truly has a lot of fun with his roleand his  fun is infectious, at least up to a point.  Talk about luck for Sam Raimi.   He and Campbell were friends in college and they were looking to just make  a quick buck with The Evil Dead.  Little did each know they would be  revered and Campbell would be considered a great actor by legions of fans.   It's too bad his name isn't that well known because he's just as good with  physical comedy as Jim Carrey.
B000006FNX|4.0|I can't understand why this is classified as a   unofficial Bond movie , there is no such thing as a bad James Bond movie . I loved this one as much as the others , i grew up watching Bond movies and of course every boy  wanted to be 007 , it was our way of escaping the drum of normal life and  fueled our imagination , I watch a bond movie every now and then and still  get the same thrill out it  . This is the only James Bond movie that i do  not own and would love to see it rereleased to give the people that dont  own it a chance to bye it
B000021Y77|5.0|A great film.  Lola is a cool, the action is riveting, the music is great, the acting is wonderful and the filming is clever.  The DVD is particularly good because there is a great music video featuring Franka Potente and  commentary by Franka and Tom Tykwer, the director.  Also, only on the DVD  can you watch the film with letter box.  The last shot of the movie just  doesn't work with pan and scan. Enjoy!
0805054375|5.0|what you must understand is that the world painted in fight club is exactly like the one you and i live in right now.  if you admit it or not is the question only you can answer.  fight club takes us into our own  soul.  it shows us how ugly we have become.  and how beautiful we could be,  if only we let ourselves be that now.  what a mirror confesses only to the  viewer.  if you want to see it, you will come to see that it is so much  more than skin deep.  we live in a world that spins on lap top computers  and power bars.  dont be fooled unless you like playing the fool. this book  is not a book as much is it is everything you never wrote down in your  journal if only you kept a journal.  this book is that part of your mind.   the part you like to pretend doesn't exist.
630157401X|5.0|Raiders of the Lost Ark was a spectacular ride full of eye-popping stunts and breathtaking action sequences.  The second Indiana Jones film, The Temple of Doom, was a disappointment.  It was a decent movie, not bad by  any means whatsoever, but it couldn't hold a candle to its predecessor.  It  seemed the Indiana Jones chronicles were only going to go downhill from  there.  Boy, was I wrong.  I watched The Last Crusade in theaters back in  1989 and it was every bit as fun and enjoyable as Raiders of the Lost Ark,  even an improvement in some ways.  There's considerably more character  development in this film and the special effects have gotten better with  enhanced technology.  <br />The storyline reverts back to the formula that  made Indiana Jones so great.  This time, Jones (Harrison Ford) has  discovered that his father, Henry (Sean Connery), has disappeared on an  expedition for the Holy Grail.  Indiana takes his place and, with the help  of Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliot), Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), searches for  his father and the Holy Grail and must battle Nazis on the same  quest.<br />The Last Crusade is action galore as its a non-stop and fun thrill  ride.  The stunts and action scenes are amazing, as usual.  <br />The  performances are as good as ever.  Harrison Ford IS Indiana Jones and  Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies do good jobs with their role.  The real  standout in this film, though, is Sean Connery as Jones' father.<br />The Last  Crusade is an excellent crowd pleaser, so watch it with an audience.  To  sum it up, this and Raiders of the Lost Ark are the best action films of  all time.
B00000JGOJ|2.0|I really enjoyed this movie when I saw it in the theater, but the DVD is terrible.  There is bad pixelation throughout - to the point where it just becomes unbearable to watch.  Stick to the VHS.
B000023VR6|5.0|Dre never went away so he never made a great comback. This CD is bumpin' yo!   You need to go buy this. It's just as good as his first, if not better.
B00000ADG2|5.0|lauryn hill can be described in one simple word.  AMAZING.  it is in her voice or in the way you can feel her soul connect with your own.  in every song she sings in every word that seems to have come from your own heart.   she does it all.  she somehow crept into my inner thoughts of love and pain  and life and put it into words beyond poetry.  to say she is inspired is to  say the universe is a big place.  i dont know how many nights i've fallen  asleep to her cd.  or how many times i've stayed up because i was listening  to her cd.
B000001Y2U|3.0|I understand him, but I'm a Christian and I don't share his point of view.<br />About the CD, the Beautiful People and Reznor are the only good things on that record. That means, if you want REAL Metal, get  Demanufacture or Obsolete from Fear Factory or Master Of Puppets by  Metallica.
B00000K2SD|1.0|I hate this movie, I don't care what people say. The acting is so horrible, I felt like I was watching public access. The special effects were used a little too much. This movie lacks in quality the way all the  other special effects filled movies do. Like twister and speed, this movie  is horrible, beginning to end. I cannot explain how bad this movie is, so,  if you really know what a good movie is, do not get this one, you will be  disappointed.
B00000FCBC|5.0|I've had this cd for about eight months now and I'm still not bored with it, this has some really sick songs on it, my favourites are: &quot;The Wait,&quot; &quot;Blitzkrieg,&quot; and &quot;Mercyful Fate.&quot; I must  say that some of the songs on the first cd aren't typical Metallica, but  the second cd is a metal masterpiece, almost all the songs are great. This  cd is wrth far more than it costs.  Metallica hasn't gone soft they've just  changed.
B000007T1M|5.0|This debut album by System of a Down is the most powerfully hard album to come out in years.  With such a unique and original style, no one can even come close to their integrity. The guitar licks on the album are so  incredibly fast yet retain complete versatility and display awesome talent.   Backed up by the no-holds-barred attitude of their singer this band is the  buggest new influence on the neo-metal scene. As a bass player myself, I  really enjoy the techniques employed by the band's bass section.  At some  points the bass brings undertones of impending doom and at others a sense  of a wild circus.                                      These basslines are  furthermore backed up by a drummer who holds tons of ingenuity.  New fills  and rolls accompany every break or change and at such a fast pace, this is  a remarkable feat. Overall, every song on the album is an absolute  masterpiece.  I have enjoyed these guys since very soon after their debut  and am glad they are now enjoying so much success.  I hope the next album  hits soon.
0425170055|2.0|There is not much to say about this book, other than it is essentially boring and poorly constructed. The writing itself is of a decent standard, but the way in which the story progresses is mediocre at best. The reader  essentially knows the outcome of the novel by a quarter of the way in.  There is no intrigue, no hidden plots or intricacies within the storyline,  and that means that the whole read is devoid of interesting substance.  Anyone who calls it 'fantastic' or something similar has clearly not read  many books in his/her lifetime, and thus is unable to appreciate a really  good novel. Tom Clancy also seems to take delight in boring his readers at  times - so much irrelevant writing is contained within his novels (this is  not SO apparent in R6, i admit), that you feel as if the book could be cut  in half and still not detract from the readers' experience. I found myself  banging my head against the wall at times whilst reading The Sum of All  Fears, the level of boredom being unbelievable at times - in it Clancy took  delight in explaining things similar to the molecular stucture of gum tree  leaves, the exact tint of Bock's hair when in a certain light, the amount  of polish of his shoes, the life story of his hat and how it came to come  on his head. So much of the content of his books is not needed that it does  indeed become hilarious after a while and u find the Sum of All Fears  turning into a comedy. Of course, R6 isn't quite so bad, but u nevertheless  find yourself desperately wanting to do something else after 100 pages of  pure boredom and then 10 pages of interest.  I was also disappointed with  the 'villains' within the novel - Brightling was an amateur, and Popov,  despite all his training, did his best to act an idiot towards the end of  the novel - how bloody long could it have taken to deduce what was going on  with the Project? Previously in the novel he stated that Brightling was  devising something &quot;greater than mass murder&quot;- in fact he states  this several times in the first half of R6- and later, when in the Project  building, he deduces, after MUCH detailed thought (which Clancy kindly, and   laboriously, runs us through) that maybe the Horizon Corporation is  planning to buy out the surrounding countryside. Well done, you genious  ex-KGB spook - oh yeah, but of course this would be too expensive even for  the HC, so Popov drops that idea and continues wondering, continually  thinking &quot;what could it possibly be?&quot;. Plus, after realising that  the authorities were onto his 'Serov' ID, he loosely throws his passport  and credit cards into a trashcan! (which makes Popov look like an idiot),  which is then by chance ripped open by accident by a garbageman (which  makes Clancy, the author, look like an idiot). The only reason why i am  giving this book 2 stars is because it contained some good content on how  anti-terrorist forces deal with terrorists, and the majority of the action  sequences were reasonably good.
B000002KBH|5.0|The Dead really did some great work on this album. I listen to it over and over and it never gets old. I am still trying to memorize the lyrics but I guess its difficult because they are so profound I cannot fathom what  Garcia, Weir and the boys were singing about. Like all Dead albums it has  great riffs that repeat and repeat endlessly so I can easily remember what  they are going to play as a song goes on. It epitomizes the 60's and  reminds me of the times I followed them on tour for months. Once, Jerry  forgot the words to 'Truckin' and I yelled them out and he remembered. That  was great.
6302779278|5.0|I thought this movie was incredible.  It was written very well and had good actors in it. I thought that Costner and Houston were great together. They were made for the roles. I thought that it had a good variation of  action, romance, suspense, and a little comedy.  It is one of my favorite  movies. I love the soundtrack too. The only thing I was disapointed with  was the ending. I thought it was a little sad. I was hoping for a different  ending but I guess then it wouldn't work out for the music. But I thought  it was a great movie for everyone.
0385474547|5.0|Okonkwo in Things fall Apart represented the struggle of Black Race. He more than any one fought against the incurssion of white race into Africa in his village . This book is more than a fiction. It is a must to  all  Black race and particularly to African Americans who were misled to believe  that they were sold slavery by their African Brothers.<br />Okonkwo did what  in true life others like King Pepple of Bonny, Jaja Of Opobo and Overaime  of Benin all in present day Nigeria did and lost their lives in their  struggle against the white man's incusion into Africa.<br />Things Fall Apart  remains the best novel from Africa. I have read this book more than 15  times yet I keep learning something new each time. <br />Just as other books  are being used in Schools in America Things fall Apart should be used to  assist African Americans in their search for proper identity in America.    Thank you Chinua Achebe for a job well done.
0451452739|5.0|I am a 10th grader and I was assigned to choose a book for a book report. I heard of 2001 and I decided to try it. The book was so symbolistic and so amazing that I re-read it twice. Just the plot of the story is amazing.  Imagine, an alien life far more advanced than ours, and they helped to  create US. I reccomend this book for anyone who loves science fiction, and  mostly anyone who doesn't.
B00000K19E|5.0|I don't need a 1000 words to review this film. Kick back and enjoy a cool high tech thriller. This is not one of those high and mighty make you think about everything movie. Enjoy it for what it is, IT IS A REALLY COOL  HIGH-TECH ACTION THRILLER. Now go watch the movie.
B000002UB3|2.0|The Beatles are famous not for making great music, but for being popular (there IS a difference).  They may have made some great songs, even on this album (Here Comes the Sun and Come Together) but their filler was less than  bearable.  Rock and roll was all about the evolution of blues to a faster  beat.  I hear little blues in the Beatles' songs, in fact most of it  (especially Sgt. Pepper's) was experimental and a type of music that never  caught on.  If one wants some good rock and roll, try the Rolling Stones or  Jimi Hendrix, who made the best blues rock and roll ever.  Abbey Road has  some timeless classics, and it is an injustice to say that the Beatles were  not a good band, but they were popular, which in some people's minds made  them great, which they were not.
0399143904|5.0|I totally oppose the views of those who think this book is a waste of paper or time.  On the contrary, this book has characters with real personalities and interactions.  Its plot is intriguing - I couldn't put it  down, even when I tried.  I often stayed up for hours at night reading.   Clancy does a great job of describing what goes on inside of a terrorist's  head, as well as what goes on in a counter terrorism team's mind.  There is  plenty of suspensful action.  Sure, I do admit that this book is rather  large, but it is not a waste of paper!  It is the best book I have ever  read.<br />The book starts with an attempted terrorist takeover of a jumbo  jet.  Luckily John CLark, former CIA and his collegues are on board,  travelling to the Hereford military base outside of London to set up a  multinational counter terrorism team.  They apprehend the terrorists using  their brains, tricking the terrorists into letting themselves be captured.   Later, Rainbow stops other terrorist incidents that will eventually lead up  to a very scary and very real possibility.  I do not wish to divulge to  much information or I would spoil the book for others.<br />I recommend this  book to everyone.  Thank you for your time.  I hope you found this helpful.
6304057709|5.0|Ang Lee has done a magnificent job of bringing Jane Austen's &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; to the screen.  The acting, directing and screenplay are terrific.  Emma Thompson is wonderful as Elinor Dashwood and Greg Wise  is excellent as the heartbreaker Willoughby.  I've always had a problem  with the character of Marianne; she is so ridiculous that you just want to  slap some sense into her; but Kate Winslet's memorable performance actually  makes her more sympathetic than she appears in the book.  With all the  great acting by the lead and supporting cast, the picture is stolen by Hugh  Grant, who is absolute perfection as the bumbling Edward Ferrars.  The  movie more than does justice to the book; Jane Austen would be proud.
B00000JGHS|5.0|This film is quite interesting, and actually not as bad as many people make out. There's the odd laugh here and there, Ving Rhames does his usual solid support and Burt Reynolds is enjoyably sleazy as a perverted  congressman. What makes the movie is the beautiful and very sexy Moore, who  may not be able to act very well, but boy is she hot. Seeing her strip is  worth the price of the DVD alone, but beyond the gorgeous Demi there's an  entertaining almost-satire to be had - but who needs that when you've got  an (almost) naked Demi. It may be the cinematic equivalent of a night out  at a strip joint, but what a night out...put this in your collection just  to see one of the sexiest women alive show just why she's so goddamn hot.  You'll need to cool down after this one...five stars just for the lovely  Demi.
068484267X|5.0|I have listened to tales of Irish poverty from the father of a friend of mine, but until I read Angela's Ashes the vividness of just how deep that poverty was never jumped out at me. I couldn't put the book down, and I  can't help but think about the father of my closest friend, who survived  the same type of childhood. It's absolutely amazing, and Frank McCourt  writes it so well it just gets stuck in your hea.
0451160916|3.0|It was good, but somewhat boring(it took about 3 months to finish it. I guess I ruined it by seeing the movie first. I'm glad I finished it though, I think it end better than the movie(Kubrick's I refer to)
0435905252|2.0|An interesting look into tribal life.  From what I learned here, I feel that for once, the missionaries were on the mark in trying to elevate this hopeless crew of superstitious, murderous, misogynists. Good riddance to  their culture.  (not that ours is much better of course).
0451151224|5.0|I read this book over the summer and after trying numerous other King books, this is my favorite. Strangely, I seem to enjoy the ones written under the pseudonym Bachman more than others. Maybe because they are more  to the point and the alternate name allowed King more freedom,  phycologically and legally. It is not considered horror, but it is scary.  Read it, it's short.
B00000JZC4|4.0|As many other reviewers, I purchased this CD on the basis of the first song released for radio air play.  &quot;Take a Picture&quot;  At the first listen, not being much for hard rock or metal, I was disappointed.  But  after the second or third listen, I really found myself getting into the  songs.  The lyrical content is impacting and truthful while the beat is  infectous.  I find myself singing &quot;Welcome to the Fold&quot; and  &quot;The Best Things&quot; throughout the day.  It has become the CD that  gets me through the work day!   So, go ahead, &quot;Take a Picture&quot;  you'll enjoy it.
B0000025SB|5.0|I'm going to set some things straight about this album.  Richard Wright was ousted before The Wall was completed because of out-of-control cocaine use and Nick Mason was ousted by both Waters and Gilmour because his  drumming was becoming very poor (I imagine this was also a drug problem).   Anyways, with that out of the way, this album is incredible.  Waters is  Pink Floyd.  I hear more Floyd on his records than any on Lapse of Reason  or Division (although DB is a great album).  Every track is worth listening  to.  It is incredibly emotional, and the music that Gilmour does contribute  to is great.  Give this album a few spins, and you will get into it.  In my  opinion, the last Pink Floyd album, and one of their five best.
B000007ODY|1.0|I find it astounding that people still admire Karajan's recording legacy.  Granted he was capable of some great work, like the 1962 Eroica, but overall he is vastly overrated.  The perfect example of his cynical,  detatched, and hollow approach to great music is nowhere more evident than  the performances of symphonies 3 and 4 in this set -- they are simply  dreadful.  The virtuosity of the Berlin Philharmonic prevents any debacles,  but the rushed, bland, and sometimes evil quality of the interpretaions are  what remain.  At times Karajan will slow things down, but his strings sound  bloated as if they were playing in molasses. I can see wanting variety in  Brahms (for example, Walter vs. Toscanini, or Solti vs. Sanderling), but  exactly what purpose do these crudely contrived performances serve?  Just  as an experiment, listen to Walter's 3rd and Kleiber's 4th (or even the  overlooked recording by Munch with the BSO) right after hearing the Karajan  ones.  See, and hear, the difference for yourself. The Sanderling and Solti  sets are both budget price, and Walter's recordings are mid-price, but the  investment will pay back in dividends far into the future.  The Karajan set  is really no more of a bargain than cold-cut ends at the corner deli.
0553213105|5.0|It doesn't get much better than Pride &amp; Prejudice, people! A smart, witty, and sarcastic heroine like Elizabeth Bennet, a man like *drool* Mr. Darcy...and the burning question: can they overcome their first impressions  of each other? My absolute favorite book!
B0000399WI|5.0|The movie was as wonderful as the novel (Rita Hayworth and the Shawshank Redemption).  Whitmore was excellent and the Warden (his name escapes me) was superb.  An incredible job all around... definitely a movie to add to  any collection!
B000002GB4|5.0|This album is an  excellent hard rock album. I bought this on 8-track in the 70's after hearing Lady Jennifer and Sweet Madmoiselle on the radio. I was blown away when I listened to it. Every song was rock at it's finest.  This was Tommy Shaw's first album with Styx and was a big improvement.  Crystal Ball and Ballerina are excellent hard rock tunes. After hearing  this album I knew they were on the brink of superstardom which occurred  with their next album The Grand Illusion.
B00001ZTE5|4.0|I never forgot the time I first saw Eat To The Beat in the racks at the record shop. The album had just been released and was $5.99. When I came across the album and saw Frank Infante on the front cover, I said,  &quot;Man, that dude looks like Frankenstein.&quot; I bought it on the spot  and was blown away when I played it. This album is hard to catergorize, but  it is definitely Deborah Harry at her sexiest and the band at its peak. The  tracks are as varied as Debbie's moods, implementing elements of reggae  (Die Young Stay Pretty), girl power-pop (Slow Motion, Union City Blue),  punk,(Living In the Real World, Accidents Never Happen), classic rock (The  Hardest Part), and even a lullaby, which was oddly out of place here (or on  any album, for that matter). At any rate, this is the best Blondie album by  far. It is the only album that encapsulates the maniacal ferocity with  which Blondie ripped through its set at CBGB's in their early days.
0140187863|5.0|The way that Lawrence depicts love in this novel is fascinating. I never had a graspe on the true meaning of love until I read this novel.  By reading the detailed love trials between Lady Chatterly and Mellors, one  can truely discover the beauty of lovemaking. This piece of work shows  Lawrences gifted personality. The majority of Lady Chatterly's Lover deals  with sex or &quot;love&quot; and not at any time during the novel did I  feel the least bit offended. Reading D.H Lawrence's Lady Chatterly's Lover  is great emotional and educational experience!
B000000WFF|1.0|...and others can get 15 months. Who really cares, because no matter how much there is of it, it always lasts!<br /> Remember the time when you would go in a record store and there would be a zillion copies of the SG's  albums? I recently went to a local Tower Records and saw a faded copy (the  only one in the store) behind a Osmond Brother's CD. When I tried to lift  it out, it was stuck. With a tug-o-war pull it came out and there was a  huge dust mark on the bottom. Literally. This goes back to the bleak 97-98  year, when teeny boppers everywhere were buying this album like slushies  because their friends also had it.  Not for music, for the trend. This is  sad. Money is hard to come by, people are starving and homeless each day,  and somehow, a young person's allowance had to go to a talentless, annoying  feminist pop group over some homeless man in the street who was victim of  Vietnam, and just wants to eat and see his family again.<br /> Sometimes life  can make no sense, but when you promote a huge money-burning gimmick and  people moronically buy into it, it says that there is something seriously  wrong with society.
0440213525|3.0|John Grisham's books are perfect for reading on extended airplane trips or in other situations where all one desires is a readable &quot;page-turner&quot; to help while away the hours.  The particular novel  is formulaic from start to finish, complete with shallow, stereotyped  characters (including a boy protagonist who apparently is eleven going on  thirty in terms of his outlook and behavior). The &quot;bad guys&quot; are  unrelentingly bad, while the &quot;good guys&quot; are practically saints.   Perfect, eh? <br />Grisham is a master of the &quot;easy read,&quot; and the  book is excellent in terms of its basic function, which is to entertain.   Great literature it isn't, however, so don't begin this novel with  unrealistic expectations in this regard.
B00003XB8K|5.0|oh, it's fantastic; the folks at enigma sample the carmina burana, and despite its popularity in action movies, it still works somehow; the music is sensual and eclectic, connected only by carmina, beat, and intention--to  make you feel sexy all over
0790729636|4.0|This is a good DVD to pop in the player to show off your system to your friends. Being a ham radio operator &amp; sometime storm chaser, this movie makes chase teams look like a bunch of clowns yelling into their CB radios.   The groups I have been associated with are a lot more professional.  Not  particularly accurate as far as tornado behavior is concerned.  How many  people can run in a field &amp; escape an F5 twister (ha)?  But the special  effects are really good &amp; the soundtrack is awesome.  Still worth the  buy for the laughs.

B00000K3UR|5.0|Adam Sandler truly shines in this movie as a reluctant father who learns to grow up only when faced with the responsibility that comes with taking care of a kid. This movie stands out in comparison to Sandler's previous  movies (i.e. The Waterboy, Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore)in that, while he  is still as funny as ever, Sandler portrays a character that many people  can identify with. The reluctance with which he faces his adult life is not  uncommon in todays world. His attitude goes from immature to adult within  the course of the movie, and shows that it isn't a bad thing to grow up.  True, the courtroom scene at the end is more than slightly corny, but it  serves to show the extent of the change in Sandler's attitude. Overall, Big  Daddy is a joy to watch and an inspiration to everyone.
0380973464|4.0|The best thing about this book is the writing style; multiple sub-plots spanning different countries and times are still kept tight and focused by the detailed primary characters. <br />While the book was a genuine pleasure  to read, (descriptions of the phillipines was nailed dead on, while the  'tech' writing for the most part displayed a decent understanding of Unix.)  <br />Unfortunately with a novel so complex, details tend to go awry; prime  example being the character of Enoch Root who seems to have been subjected  to serious editing - at one point (during WW II) this character is supposed  to have died while possibly leaving a son (of a different name) behind.  Later on in the novel, the same? or another character of the same name and  profession pops up in modern time with no clear explanation.  <br />Additionally some characters such as Bischoff the U-boat captain are  simple dropped into limbo - the reader having no clue what happens to them.  <br />Finally the conclusion in my opinion was a bit weak leaving more  questions than it answered. Its to the Authors credit however that the  novel was so engrossing that I am intent on nitpicking over these issues.
B000023VR6|5.0|This cd is the best I have heard in a long time. It has really good songs featuring some big time rap stars like Snoop Dogg and Eminem. When I first heard this album i only knew &quot;Still D.R.E.&quot; But i let the cd run,  and i was so suprised and amazed on how good it is. This is definitley  Dr.Dre's greatest album, if not his greatest accomplishment. I would  reccommend the cd to anyone who loved Chronic, or any of Snoop Dog's  albums. If you were to have only one cd throughout this whole year,  definitley go with Chronic 2001. I love it and listen to it all the time. I  hope you do the same. I think this cd is money well spent.

B000023VR6|5.0|This cd is the best I have heard in a long time. It has really good songs featuring some big time rap stars like Snoop Dogg and Eminem. When I first heard this album i only knew &quot;Still D.R.E.&quot; But i let the cd run,  and i was so suprised and amazed on how good it is. This is definitley  Dr.Dre's greatest album, if not his greatest accomplishment. I would  reccommend the cd to anyone who loved Chronic, or any of Snoop Dog's  albums. If you were to have only one cd throughout this whole year,  definitley go with Chronic 2001. I love it and listen to it all the time. I  hope you do the same. I think this cd is money well spent. Chronic 2001  BAYBEE!

630241380X|5.0|We bought this video as soon as it originally came out (after 1st watching the original tv miniseries) &amp; had to replace our first copy because we wore it out.  The relationship between Jones &amp; Duvall make it what it  is: THE BEST, period.
0440213525|5.0|In The Client, Mark Sway goes into the woods to teach his brother, Ricky, how to smoke.  In the middle of the lesson, a black car pulls up with a lawyer named Jerome, who is trying to commit suicide.  Jerome is trying to kill himself by breathing in the carbon monoxide from his car.  Mark tries  to save Jerome, but his attempts fail and Jerome catches him.  After Jerome  catches Mark, he puts Mark in the car too.  Jerome begins to talk about  going to la-la land, but then he reveals the location of the dead body of  senator Boyd Boyette, who his client from the Mafia murdered.  The FBI  knows that Mark knows where the body is, and they'll do almost anything to  find out where the body is hidden.  The Mafia also knows that Mark knows  where the body is, and they'll do anything to stop him from telling the  FBI.  Mark's lawyer, Reggie, can help him choose what to do, but only Mark  can make the final decision.  This is a great book about making choices.   Mark could tell the FBI what they need to know and risk being killed by the  Mafia.  Mark could also choose to stay silent, but then he'll have to stay  in 'jail' until he decides to talk.  WE all have to make decisions in life,  but almost none of us will probably ever have to make one as hard as  Marks's.
B000005ALN|5.0|I am collecting all of George's CD's and I wanted to get this one today because I had heard such great reviews on it. The reviews are all true. It is an excellent addition to anyone's collection of CDs. Love you George!
6303379214|5.0|Both Robert Downey Jr. and Marissa Tomei are so adorable in this charming comedy.  I truly enjoyed it and hope that one day, they will make another film together.   This is the type of film you can watch when you're in the  mood for a romantic comedy that can take you away to Italy.
B000000WCA|5.0|The Spice Girls album, SPICE, is an album you can never get tired of. Forget all the other &quot;wannabe&quot; groups out there like S Club 7 and Nobody's Angel, the Spice Girls are only the best there is. All their songs  are brilliant , full of life, and make you wanna get up and dance. This  album isn't only for those who like the Spice Girls, but for those who like  to dance !
6300216802|2.0|A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...<br />The STAR WARS phenomena took off in 1977. At that time, STAR TREK: PHASE II was in early design for the television return of the Starship Enterprise. Welp, STAR WARS was the  biggest movie of all time at that time, and the powers at Paramount  Pictures decided that STAR TREK would be a movie.<br />What no one remembered  was what WAS STAR TREK? In the 1960s, STAR TREK was the voyages of the  Starship Enterprise. It was the expanding of the human knowledge and  wisdom, and it was a mirror on our society. STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE  is none of this.<br />We're treated to so many beauty shots of the newly  re-fitted Enterprise, that there are actually whole passages where you can  go buy popcorn and not miss anything. STAR TREK in the 60s was also  action-adventure. This movie is sssssslllllllloooooowwwwwwww, about 45  minutes too long. Luckily, there are more STAR TREK incarnations to watch  that are much better.
B00000IOSU|5.0|I first heard Sarah Mclachlan only about 4 years back. However on my first hearing, I fell in love with her songs. When Mirrorball was realeased, I immediately bought it, expecting the same magic from her 'Surfacing' album.  Sure enough I wasn't dissapointed. This cd has some of her best songs from  her previous albums. They are all live performances recorded during her  successful Lilith Fair tour. Some listeners may however find the live album  irratating if they want to listen to the music alone. However if you're a  big fan, then the fans screaming won't bother you at all!In fact you'd wish  you were there at her concert singing &quot;ice cream&quot; with her and  her fans together!   This album is a stellar wether listening to it in a  car, at home,at work, with friends, at bed. I recommend this album to old  and new fans of Sarah Mclachlan. This is one of the most  &quot;non-dissapointing&quot; albums .  Some older fans may find some of  their older favorites not included (like Vox),and it may be a bit of a let  down. However instead of buying lots of other albums, buy this since it is  packed with others all in one album!Her angelic voice belts out favorites  like 'building a mystery,' 'adia,' 'i will remember you,' 'fumbling towards  ecstasy,'etc.Buy it cause it has lots of her hits (old and new) packed in  one!
6300213803|3.0|Movie sequels don't often do better than the original. But WRATH OF KHAN is a faster-paced action-adventure movie. Ricardo Montalban reprises his role of Khan, a 20th Century genetically-altered superman who moved to the 23rd Century via cryogenics. Khan failed to take over the Earth and is now trying to take over the galaxy.<br />Enter also David Marcus, the bastard child of Kirk. (You know this had to happen with Kirk sleeping around the way he did in the series) There's a lot of father/son tension that doesn't work here.<br />No, what makes this movie work are all the space battles. They really are exciting, but...That's not STAR TREK! STAR TREK was not about hardware and special effects. Strike Two to Paramount for still not realizing what the franchise really is.
6305627347|5.0|When I heard that the South Park Movie was coming out, I wasn't very intrigued to go see it. Although it got some o.k. reviews, I decided to wait it out. Recently it came to video, and I saw it. This movie shockingly  has a pretty good story to go along with it. The story hardly gets away  from the plot which is that the kids go see a Terrance and Phillip movie  with foul language and it then becomes part of their language. It is a good  movie, but even though it has the use of many bad words, it is used only to  help the plot. The movie is a funny one that all people should watch.
6300214400|1.0|God, this movie is painful to watch! This is a major disappointment. Picking up where the previous film ended, THE SEARCH FOR SPOCK is plotless,  slow, boring, and, in general, a complete waste of film, money, time, and  popcorn.<br />Even the reincarnation of Spock at the end can't save this  cinematic death-trap. I'd rather date a Klingon than watch this.
6303022901|1.0|OK, I can't speak for all you chick-flick lovin' people out there, but if you're anything like me, this movie sucks.  It is impossible to keep up with eight story lines, most of which are very boring, and the whole movie  is really depressing.
B00000ILDF|3.0|In a way, it's an improvement. We kill off the pointless people from the second film, and we have several really talented actors. Unfortunately, we can't tell them apart. I've never managed to identify Paul McGann.  The cinematography is downright bad. This picture is less fun than the others, but it's trying for something better, and once it gets rolling, it kicks. It just takes a damn long time to get there. I love the way the FOX theme slides into dissonance...
6304011431|5.0|I rented this movie 3 years ago and found it wonderful. I am male, 50 years old, married with children, and in the midst of a mid-life awakening. This movies spoke to me, but if one is not in a 'heart place' then it may  not speak to you. I credit the director and actors for going out on a limb  and reaching for something rich and healthy in life.<br />Considering the age  of this movie (1995) I was surprised at all the recent reviews, some in the  last few weeks, most all in the last year. A pleasant surprise.
B00000ILDE|3.0|The best part of the Alien series is how easy they are to write about. Each film is totally different from the earlier films, and yet they have the same basic concept. For many, this is the greatest...but I can't work out why. The thing has many serious problems. Such as that irritating and shrill child. She's better than the cat, but why can't they have found one who wasn't annoying? Once again, we have no cast. A few fairly amusing people, and I do like Bishop, but I have to say I was shocked when Michael Biehn survived because I had never noticed that he was there previously.  And Paul Reiser needed a really violent, cool death. His death is a cop-out. James Cameron also provides us his typically great dialogue, such as &quot;Get away from her, you *****!&quot; COME ON! Oh, well. This was the most fun of the original trilogy. I do wish the cinematographer had experimented with colors other than blue and red, which get quite tiresome at this length, but that's a minor quibble. (It was his first film; he has become much better, and this all may have been Cameron's fault anyway).
B00000JCOV|5.0|Basically I bought this cd because of the cover.  I had never heard of them but those guys looked freaky so I got it.  I'm glad I did.  This is the heaviest album I have ever heard.  1 through 15, every song is complete  chaos.  The drums and percussion definitely are the key.  Slipknot's drums  have a little bit of that Sepultura tribal sound and the blazing Slayer  double bass.  But its all multiplied.  The sound is just crushing.  Ignore  everyone that tells you that Slipknot sounds like Korn.  I don't understand  this at all.  Its not the vocals.  Corey has one of the darkest, angriest  voices you will ever hear.  Its not the guitars or bass either.  Just  because a group downtunes everything doesn't mean they turn into Korn.   Seriously, you haven't heard anything with a combination of melody,  darkness, and all out thrash like Slipknot.  Gives me chills every time I  listen to it, which is almost every day.  Its really hard to compare them  to other bands.  But if I had to, I would say their music is a combination  of Slayer, Static-X, and Chaos-AD era Sepultura.  Add to that the growling  vocals with a little bit of rap style, and the fastest drums on earth.  You  have to get your hands on this.  You won't be sorry.
B000002KLP|5.0|The is the absolute best of all of Prince's classic albums. And we know that he has many classic albums. For me, only Sign of the Times comes close to this. Brilliant, from beginning to end. If you are a Prince fan and you  do not own this album, you should be shot.
B000001EHS|5.0|This was the second Def Leppard cd that I had ever got. So, as you can probably tell, I have just recently started listening to them.  When I got this cd, I feel in love with it right away.  I never realized that some of  these songs were Def Leppard songs!   When I listen to music I can tell you  any song, just not the artist.  Now that I got into Def Leppard, it's  different.  There are so many great songs on this cd. &quot;Pour Some Sugar  on Me&quot;, &quot;Two Steps Behind&quot;, &quot;Love Bites&quot;,  &quot;Hysteria&quot;, just to name a few.  If you remotely like Def  Leppard, or just fun rock and roll, get this album!
6305627401|5.0|I've read all of the reviews posted above, and don't understand why people were shocked by the language. SouthPark isn't about potty humor at all, it's a constant commentary on society. The people who didn't like it didn't  comment at all about the gruesome deaths- only about the foul language. If  the title didn't warn them about what they were going to see, then it's  their own fault. I don't have anything against people who didn't like this  new classic, but I also don't go rent movies that I know won't appeal to me  and then gripe about what they are about. This movie isn't about two guys  trying to see what they can get away with, it's a political statement about  the current state of society. When you understand what Matt and Trey are  saying, the whole concept of South Park clicks and you can find the humor  on the intellectual (as opposed to the Jr. High) level. If you want  mindless entertainment, go watch a &quot;serious&quot; PG rated movie. If  you want to see a brilliant statement that gives you some hysterical relief  from the current state of society, go get this movie. Personally, I believe  that the best way to defeat what's wrong with our society is to laugh at  the stupidity of what Matt and Trey expose about our society in this  movie.<br />Thanks for reading this. :) Enjoy the movie, I do. p.s. -  The DVD  should have had more extra features, but that's not the fault of the movie.
B00003652R|5.0|For the uninitiated, Marillion is the best and longest lasting neo-prog group to come out of the 80's revival of that genre. Misplaced Childhood is in my opinion their finest hour. A continuous, conceptual piece of music  constructed in the model of Jethro Tull's Thick as a Brick and Passion Play  records, with nods to the genius of Pink Floyd's Roger Waters and classic  Gabriel era Genesis. Challenging music and deep introspective lyrics. This  even contains the groups closest aproximation to a U.S. hit single in the  extraordinary Kayleigh. Indescribably essential.
B000003BE4|5.0|This album will go down in history for giving the Stones their first big hit &quot;Satisfaction&quot;.  As many of you know, Keith Richards didn't like it all at 1st!  Besides that, there's &quot;The Last Time&quot;,  &quot;Play with Fire&quot; (one of the Stones' 1st experimental tracks),  and the classic blues &quot;The Spider and the Fly&quot;.  While there are  plenty of covers &quot;Hitch Hike&quot;, &quot;That's How Strong My Love  Is&quot;, and &quot;Good Times&quot;, most of the stronger tracks are  written by Mick and Keith or &quot;Nanker Phelge&quot;, a pseudonym for  co-credit between Mick, Keith, Bill, Brian, and Charlie (like &quot;The  Under Assistant...&quot;, &quot;Fire&quot;, and a fun jam &quot;I'm All  Right&quot;).  All right already, listen for yourself and you're sure to  get some satisfaction of your own!
B000002J23|5.0|Unforgivably overlooked by the general public, this a great Yes record nonetheless. Sure, Anderson and Wakeman are not around for this, but does it really matter? Horn and Downes shine and give Yes a shot in the arm  after the painfully lackluster &quot;Tormato&quot;. Some of Squire's best  bass work is here on Tempus Fugit and Machine Messiah. And what about Steve  Howe ? Great heavy guitar! If you missed this the first time around, give  it another chance.
B000002LGQ|5.0|I love every song on this album except the Prince duet, &quot;Love Song&quot; which had no reason to be here. Other than that all of the songs are worthy of top ten fame. My favorites are &quot;Spanish Eyes&quot; and  &quot;Keep It Together&quot;. But when you hear lyrics like &quot;Pink  Elephants And Lemonade&quot; in a great song like &quot;Dear Jessie&quot;,  you know the girl has talent to sing. This CD is now 11 years old and  sounds just as good now as it did then. Highly Recommended as one of  Madonna's Best Albums.
B000031WD9|5.0|When i first saw American Pie i thought it was going to be a movie like &quot;Angus&quot;, I liked angus but American Pie, shows just how sex crazy Teenagers can be!
B000002LND|5.0|This album, now ten years old, is still a great listen. Even though Madonna is the queen of shock, she still has a lot of God given talent to write and sing songs. This collection shows that. I've read reviews that  say she didn't put all of her hits onto this album, but how could she? She  has had too many great songs for one CD and she was smart to put the best  ones on it making it cheaper to buy as a single disc.<br />Lots of the songs  here are remade from the original and I think they are all better than the  originals except &quot;Into The Groove&quot;, which was better as the  original. Two new songs found a home including &quot;Justify My Love&quot;  and &quot;Rescue Me&quot;, both being good songs. &quot;Justify My  Love&quot;, was the song that brought Madonna into her &quot;Sex&quot; era  of the early 90's. The song was good but had some contraversial lyrics and  the video was banned from MTV because of some nudity. Overall though this  album is an excellent value and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to  her Madonna of the 1980s.
0800141709|5.0|Kubrick and his cast of lunatics truly out-did themselves with this crazy film. I recieved this  video for Christmas from my fiance. We watched it as a joke on New Year's Day 2000. George C. Scott delievers one of the  greatest performances of his career with his insane General. The only other  Kubrick film that beats this one is A Clockwork Orange. To the true movie  fan, it does not get any better than Kubrick.
B0000027I6|5.0|I just bought this record today and am only on my second listen thus far.  Needless to say to other fans of Mr. Waters, the full impact of this music/poetry is only beginning to touch base with me.  He is quite the  accomplished lyricist and this album is one of the many showcases of that  talent.  Highly recommended!
B00002MZ2T|5.0|I highly recomnd this CD. It has the hit songs &quot;I Knew I Loved You&quot; and &quot;The Animal Song&quot;. It's fantastic!
0446310786|5.0|I first read this book in grade 10 English class I found it to be a realistic and ideal book to be read and talked about to teenagers, it faces them with the facts and realism of racism and discrimination towards people  that still continues today I feel this is a great book to be read and  talked about in class and should be for as long as racism and  discrimination is out there.
B000002OX5|5.0|I became a Who fan in early 1967 when I first heard &quot;Happy Jack&quot; and rushed out and bought the album.  But nothing on that album prepared me for The Who Sell Out, which came out later that year.  The whole premise of  the album is that it is presented as if it were a British pirate radio  station program complete with fake commercials connecting the songs.  In  fact, some of the commercials become full-fledged songs, such as the two  minute-plus &quot;Odorono.&quot;<br />What makes this recording especially  refreshing is that while it seemed as if the entire pop culture was taking  itself much too seriously during the Summer of Love, The Who were willing  to inject a bit of whimsy into the proceedings. In the process they  produced some of their most enduring songs:  the acoustic charm of  &quot;Mary Anne with the Shaky Hands,&quot;  the tongue-in-cheek  &quot;Tattoo,&quot; the lovely &quot;Our Love Was&quot; with its razor  sharp electric guitar break coupled with Townsend's beautiful acoustic  playing and Entwistle's French horn accents, and then there's the ultimate  Who single &quot;I Can See for Miles.&quot;  [It would be the first and  only time The Who would reach the top ten in America!]<br />Other standout  tracks include &quot;Relax,&quot; &quot;Sunrise&quot; and  &quot;Rael,&quot; which was a mini-opera along the lines of &quot;A Quick  One While He's Away.&quot;  Since much of the material was more subdued  than earlier songs like &quot;My Generation&quot; or &quot;I'm a Boy&quot;  little of this album other than &quot;I Can See for Miles&quot; found its  way into the band's live shows.  That is not, however, meant to diminish  the power of these songs.<br />Like the other remastered Who albums in this  series, there is an abundance of bonus tracks. In addition to several  previously unreleased commercials, there's the Entwistle-penned  &quot;Someone's Coming&quot; (sung by Roger Daltry!),  the instrumental  guitar workout &quot;Hall of the Mountain King&quot; (based on Grieg's  &quot;Peer Gynt Suite&quot;) and an alternate version of &quot;Mary Anne  with the Shaky Hands&quot; featuring Al Kooper on organ.  Several other  bonus tracks first appeared on The Who's Thirty Years of Maximum R&amp;B.  I have a minor quarrel with this duplication, but it is nice to hear these  bonus tracks in conjunction with the original album.  Plus, if you didn't  spring for the TYOMR&amp;B box set, these are all truly bonus tracks.

B00002Z88D|1.0|For the second time, Metallica fails to create good new material knowing all the Metallica fools will lap up this rehash of overused old, bad material. I hate Hero Of The Day, no matter what. I think this is their  cover up for zilch writing talent. Not really a dissappointment, I think  this is more bizarre than weird...
B00000JZIQ|5.0|Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway outshine Russo and Brosnan.  The sexual tension in the original is fantastic compared to Russo walking around half naked and dumb!  Watch the original......it's worth it!
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica's albums have all provided a wide range of flavors for a wide variety of listeners.  &quot;Old-school&quot; Metallica provided huge amounts of glorious thrash metal. Ride the Lightning represents some of the  best of this fast-paced, manic guitar work.  Kirk's guitar work is  intricate and so fast you can only imagine the speed at which his fingers  are moving.  Cliff's bass work on For Whom the Bell Tolls is impressive,  and James' growling lyrics are properly sung for the style, and extremely  well written.  The band explores a variety of ideas in their writing, and  fits them to some brilliantly styled melodies.  Their first attempts at a  slower melody, Fade to Black, are extremely successful at putting a  beautiful melody together with the heavy distortion of the electric guitar.   OVERALL:  A MUST HAVE FOR ALL HEAVY METAL FANS!
B00001ZULV|5.0|This is the kind of music I was raised on as a child, and for some reason, despite today's hip-hop music, this is the stuff I like. All the songs are pretty much great, with my favorite being &quot;Land of Confusion&quot;.  I  also liked &quot;Invisible Touch&quot;, and &quot;Turn it on Again&quot;.  The &quot;Carpet Crawlers 1999&quot; is good too.  This is a must-get for  any fan of rock or Genesis.
0553296981|5.0|I am just a mere speck on a human tapestry moved and saddened by the Diary of Anne Frank.  It's just a book you say.  Tell that to the millions who have read the diary.  Tell that to those who have seen the stage play, the  movies, the documentaries, and the World Wide Web pages.  Tell that to the  Japanese schoolgirl who said her heart danced in the Secret Annex.  Tell  that to me who, for almost three decades, has pondered the riddle of  emotion that Anne's diary calls forth.  A code I have never been able to  crack.<br />Anne started writing her diary, the same age I began reading it.  I was just thirteen and had chosen the diary as part of a year eight  reading course.  I still have my relic, a Pan edition version of the  publisher's 30th printing of the diary in 1974.  It bears markings of many  readings: starched yellow pages, corners bent, a dusty old library smell  reflecting its ancient mid-seventies origin.  I don't know why I chose her  story.  I had never heard of Anne Frank, never heard of her diary, never  heard of 263 Prinsengracht, the Frank family-hiding place - Anne's  &quot;Secret Annex&quot; - in war weary Amsterdam.  But for whatever  reason, not long after the moon left its dust on Armstrong, Anne Frank left  her mark on me.<br />I went to Amsterdam once where all I could think about  was Anne.  As I made my way to 263 Prinsengracht, I half expected to see  her, a blurry pink blush peddling past on her bicycle, or skating over some  canal's wintry surface.  And then standing outside The Shrine, what would  this wedge of a structure tell me about Anne.  Would I feel its  ghosts...smell the fear of Jews in hiding...see Anne's frosted breadth on a  window ... hear Anne singing, talking, whispering fear...writing her most  sacred thoughts... her love for Peter...the fondness for her father...the  problems with her mother... her dreams for a post-War world ...would Anne hear  me coming...hello Anne are you there...<br />For some Anne might be the patron  saint of teenagers.  But she is no saint.  She is one of us and that is her  magic.  In a dedication to Anne, the Mayor of Amsterdam once said that Anne  Frank was not an abstract symbol for the millions who died during World War  II.  She was more than a symbol, she was reality itself.  For the millions  affected by the diary, Anne's voice somehow provides meaning and  understanding in a cruel, violent and incomprehensible world.  Anne taught  us that tolerance, freedom and respect for human dignity count for more,  than insane and corrupt ideologies.<br />When world leaders talk war and  peace, they should remember there are many Anne's.  Someplace there will be  this island of human emotions: laughter, gaiety, innocence, love, fear,  forgiveness.  She tells us that the individual's quest for happiness means  more than any depraved collective dream.  Anne knew this when she said the  best remedy for unhappiness was to go somewhere quiet where one could be  alone with the heavens, nature and God.  As long as happiness existed, she  said, there would &quot;always be comfort for every sorrow&quot;.  Anne  showed us how to live when there is an inferno at our doorstep.  For this  reason, her book should be read by all.  For this reason, her diary's  message will be eternal.  If we have broken the code, it will be for one  reason.  We will always need Anne.tron  saint of teenagers.  But she is no saint.  She is one of us and that is her  magic.

B000002MG1|5.0|Automatic For The People is a bittersweet record that will never leave your CD collection once it's yours. A sweetly beautiful collection of songs about life, death and perhaps even beyond, I can't recommend this album  enough. It's one of the few CD's I own that can take me to the point of  tears (but not quite).<br />The songs on this record are not as cynical or  politically-inspired as previous R.E.M. releases. The group have changed  hats adeptly here and have gone for strings and melodies to accompany the  melancholic lyrics.<br />I forewarn you: this is an album no written review  can do justice. The best review you'll ever stumble upon is the actual CD.  It speaks for itself quite well.<br />Simply beautiful.
6303168507|5.0|Brilliant, provocative, gut-wrenchingly moving, this film could do to cinematography what Shakespeare did to the English language - shake it, define it, refine it.  How Spielberg's classic could not have been one of  Time magazine's films of the century is beyond me.  Forget Spielberg the  man, focus on the film. Yep, black and white has been done before but never  has it been done on such a tapestry, not just as a medium but as a method  for conveying meaning.  Remember the little girl in the pink dress,  Keneally's &quot;meandering full stop&quot; at the end of the column of  Jews.  Doubters be damned!  How could anyone not be moved to their core  when the little pink dress is revealed at its final tragic destination?   Forget not that that first the book, then the film, then Spielberg's  Survivors of the Shoah project have added nobility to a fetid sore.  Forget  not, then cry, cry, cry.
B00001R3GI|5.0|This is the best album by the greatest band in the world.  It takes a few listens, but you'll soon realize that is a classic from start to finish.  There aren't as many big hits here as on Sticky Fingers, but overall this  album is much better.  From the first two blistering tracks &quot;Rocks  Off&quot; and &quot;Rip This Joint&quot;, this is the Stones at their best.   Other highlights include &quot;Happy&quot;, &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot;,  &quot;Shine A Light&quot;, and &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot;.  However, this  is an album that seems much better when played from start to finish.  It is  a bluesy effort with a few straightforward rockers in between.  It almost  makes songs like &quot;Happy&quot; sound better against the backdrop of the  more blues-influenced numbers.  The horn sections on &quot;Rocks Off&quot;  and &quot;Happy&quot; and the saxophone solos on &quot;Rip This Joint&quot;  and &quot;Casino Boogie&quot; are pure rock and roll.  Any fan of great  rock should buy Exile On Main Street.  This is a great album.
0792151712|5.0|This movie did for kids' bath times what Dracula did for dentistry.  Both created inexpressible interest in occupations of limited pull for children.  If inertia sets in, no problem, &quot;let's play Titanic in the bath  kids&quot; loosens the toughest treacle.  And beat this.  Our family has  watched the video of the great ship sinking 10 times and sinking, er,  counting since we brought the thing a year ago.  Forget the Dow Jones.   Forget the Oscars.  Our family index - a much more reliable barometer -  tells the world this movie was a hit.  Yes, we can be picky.  Jack's  dialogue sounds a bit corny, some of the special effects seem - well - just  effects and not especially special.  But when it comes to nerve tingling  kissing, painting, panting, sinking scenes and Picasso-hating crooks,  Titanic is hard to beat.  Oh, and the music isn't that bad either.  We  should never forget the horror and tragedy of that April night but, at  least, we have a Titanic film worthy of its legacy.  We are ready for the  sequel Mr Cameron.  Will it be &quot;Raise the....&quot;
0767903811|5.0|Bill Bryson's knack with words makes this book a laugh a minute.  His sarcasm and cynicism, combined with his wit and charm help provide a new prospective.  I would recommend it to anyone!
B00002E233|4.0|I read a reviewer say that the special effects were awful.  I wondered if he watched this movie or Alligator!  This movie has it all.  Some scary parts, some funny parts, and a whole lot of action.  And not to mention the  SPECIAL EFFECTS.  There is also a good score by Trevor Rabin.  Not on the  level of Jaws(but nothing will ever be) but still worth it.  Watch it and  you will be thoroughly entertained!
6305428220|2.0|A tepid moderatley fulfilling, guilty pleasure is all this very if-y Sci-fi/Horror film can be classified as. GUILTY PLEASURE! That may be good enough fo some but not for me. Now i admit the first time i saw this movie  i liked it, but then i watched it again and i couldnt believe that such a  high profile cast could do such an idiodic film. With fine special effects  and fine acting, the fineness ends there and ridiculesness begins. A teen  interpretation of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS is an insult to such a  classic horror film. Kevin Williamson tried to go a different direction  with his writing, and he did-going down, anyone?
0380002930|5.0|This book is a great fantasy. Rabbits can really talk, and have their own community. It is sorta hard to understand, but its an interesting book!
0876852649|5.0|Charles Bukowski served as an inspiration when I was a existentialist teenager. His searing wit and semi-autobiographical style endears any reader to his cause. For those spoiled surburan yuppies this book will  serve as a eye opener to how many people survive. This book will remain in  my memory for many years to come. I find myself frequently referring to it  at time and its familiarity always brings a measure of comfort in those  dark and dreary days.
B000000W5L|5.0|Although -- just to set the record straight -- it is not blemished by one weak track, those who complain about Exile's &quot;inconsistency&quot; miss the point entirely.  Intentionally or not, this is an organic work of art  that expands and breathes as it builds its relentless and overwhelming  momentum from track to track.  Songs like &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot;,  &quot;Torn and Frayed&quot;, &quot;Ventilator Blues&quot; and &quot;I Just  Want to See His Face&quot; are half tongue-in-cheek, half sincere tributes  to the musical forms that provided the foundations for all of the Stones'  music.  At the same time, they are brilliantly written and executed songs  absolutely capable of standing on their own, and whose varied paces and  styles contribute to the flow of the album.  It is these very shifts in  pace and style and tone that are substantially responsible for Exile's  greatness.  Over the course of 18 tracks the album is always changing  levels, keeping you on your toes, susceptible to surprise.<br />By this time,  the Stones were masters of the form. They had assimilated and transcended  their influences so that the music that they made was at the same time  distinctly their own, but also a part of a continuum that included blues,  boogie, country, r and b, you name it.  Exile on Main Street is where  everything came together and the Stones were able to demonstrate their  mastery so effortlessly.  It was the culmination of everything that they  had done for the previous ten years and neither they nor anyone else would  again equal it.
0156528207|5.0|To write a book like this Saint-Exupery had to of lived to gain such an understanding of life. It was one of his last books and written with such clarity. I recommend it to anyone who is going through any sad times - it  will remind you of what is important in life - and put everything in  perspective. I have bought so many copies and believe everybody should read  it. It was recommended to me by James Dean (not personally - in the film of  his life story!) - Once read, never forgotten.
0440539811|5.0|I think this book wins the award as the most reviewed book at Amazon. That in itself should speak volumes. The book is a dogma bashing rollercoaster ride and it is easy to see why the many dogma-dependent are so easily ruffled in the feather department: Alergies. Seriously, if you are not  prone to asking questions, if thinking is a turn-off, this book is  liable to stick in your craw or not stick altogether, as the case may be.  It has a way of deconstructing its readers and their most cherished  assumptions. This book is just one of many written by the amazing Robert  Anton Wilson and I heartily recommend them all. Peace.
B000001DZM|5.0|There's a variety of interesting things on this disc, a couple of pop classics by White Plains and R.B. Greeves, a couple of &quot;lounge&quot; classics by Trudy Richards and Lena Horne. The version of &quot;Billy Don't  Be A Hero&quot; is actually the original version by Paper Lace, but not the  hit version by Bo Donaldson &amp; the Heywoods that everyone is familiar  with. And you get a nice mixture of dance remixes by Alicia Bridges, Gloria  Gaynor, and Peaches and Herb. Overall this is a good time disc, very  enjoyable.
079284209X|5.0|A very fine actor Robert de Niro a man with a talent beyond the reach of imagination,one of the best director of the century  John Frankenhimer,a movie not to be missed it is a must see, they should make more of this  movies others are waist of time and money
B000003AEB|5.0|This cd is really cool!  You can't be disappointed by bying this cd even though it is 7 years old now! &quot;Murder was the case&quot;, &quot;Lodi Dodi&quot; and of course &quot;Whats my name&quot; are my favorites. I bet  Puffy liked the cd too, 'case he couldn't help samplin' &quot;Lodi  Dodi&quot;, and making the hit &quot;Hypnotize&quot; for B.I.G. HEHE!
B000002BE9|5.0|Oh my word!  I absolutely love this!  She reminds me of Sade.  Shadowboxer and Sullen Girl are my favorites.  &quot;I've been swinging around...&quot; I play this cd at work constantly and everyone loves it. No  all the songs aren't like criminal, but they are all fantastic!
0780622553|5.0|This movie is definitely one of the best science-fiction movies out.  To call it the same thing as the Matrix is thinking with a simple mind.  To call it hollywood trash is just spiteful.  With that out of the way, on to  the movie.  The movie is quite dark, and that will probably turn off a lot  of people who aren't into the dark sci-fi style, but this movie does dark  sci-fi very well.  It doesn't follow a generic formula, and the acting is  very good (despite many people's problems with Sutherland's job).  The  movie's use of grotesque images and special effects is skillfully done and  never becomes tacky, which a lot of movies tend to suffer from.  The end  scene may be a bit hoky, but that doesn't mean it's bad.  Perhaps a sign of  how good a movie this is is the triviality of people's complaints about it,  even while they give it 5 stars.   Bottom line though, if you're not a  sci-fi fan, don't get it because it's not the type of movie for you.  If  you are, you will appreciate this movie for its uniqueness and great  execution.
B00000ILE6|5.0|Aliens is definitely one of the best SF/Horror movies ever made.  But ten years ago I made a copy of the TV version, and have watched it ever since instead of the original because of three crucial scenes added in the TV  version that the Special Edition finally includes.  The scene that explains  and shows Ripley's loss of her daughter works for me, strengthening her  maternal ties to Newt.  The two scenes with the sentry robots, along with  just being cool, are crucial in explaining how the creatures were kept away  long enough to allow Ripley to fall asleep with Newt.  Ripley getting Newt  into bed, and the scene when they both wake up are two of the best in the  movie; what the heck am I saying, every scene is great!  But these now work  better.  The added footage showing the colony before it is destroyed I  would have preferred being left out.  Still, I love this version.  With a  movie of this caliber, fans like myself appreciate anything new we hadn't  seen before.  Aliens fans should definitely see this edition!  And even  with the colony scene included, I would recommend this version over the  original for first-time viewers.
B000002TYK|4.0|This is a great Retro-Nirvana release. Many of the songs, such as I'll Stick Around. It has more quiet songs, like Big Me.  This is not wonderful, but deserves better critisism. It has everything Dave went through with  Nirvana packed into twelve awesome songs. A must have for anyone even  partial to grunge, punk, metal, or alternative music.
6302548195|5.0|This documentary is inspiring.  I've been working out for 4 years and rented it two years ago because a buddy of mine recommended it to me, so I rented it.  I need to buy a copy of this movie, if anyone knows where I can  buy &quot;Pumping Iron&quot; let me know.  E-mail me at JPomp68837@aol.com
B00000AFGM|4.0|Alright..Where do I begin..?  First off..The album is very good.  It was a change..Okay..a BIG change from Anti-Christ Superstar.  Manson went from Hardcore Goth-Rock to Glam nearly overnite.  Anyway..I think most of you  &quot;Manson fans&quot; or &quot;Non-Manson fans&quot; are missing the  point of the album.  The album was his transition from being emotionally  numb..to emotionally open and comfortable with himself.(Thank you Rose  McGawen)  The album showed his progress from feeling like nothing to being  happy that hes in love.  He does things b/c he can not b/c no one else will  do them.  Thats it..Plain and simple.  He does it b/c he can..And My  Gods..He does it well.
0782008372|1.0|This DVD is of such poor quality, I can't believe it was released. Pitiful video and audio.<br />DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!
B000003TAW|5.0|This, Weezer's first albumn is in my opinion, the greatest album ever.  Former lead singer of The Cars, Rik Ocasek proves to be the perfect match, as he incorporates the same guitar structure that gave the cars their sound  into this album to give it its post grunge college rock feel.  While most  songs are written by lead singer Rivers Cuomo, I liked the ones in which he  collaborated with drummer Pat Wilson, such as &quot;Say It Aint So&quot;  the best.  This Album is worth every penny. It never gets old. I listen to  it everyday.
B00000K19E|5.0|I was blown away by the special effects and intricate storyline. This is a film which is truely worth watching and keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is one of the best films of the 90s and I advise all to watch it even  those who are sceptical. I am not a fan of science fiction but I could  watch this film again and again!
6301963717|5.0|As it's chilly performances and aloof style put the audience at a distance, it's hard to see the first time through what a brilliant film this picture is; but repeated veiwings have only cemented my  opinion--Miller's Crossing is the finest American film since Raging Bull.   <br />I think the key to my love for Miller's, though, is realizing what what  I believe the dream-hat meant (I'm sure this will be obvious to some,  especially those that have watched a number of times, but I just want to  throw this out there for folks that have seen it, but don't know what all  the hubbub is about--because certainly, that's how I felt when I first saw  it).  <br />Whether people wear hats or not in the film seems to represent  whether they are acting out of passion-from the heart, that is, or out of  mind--thinking logically, or unemotionally.<br />Tom's conflict in the film is  entirely between his head and his heart(Verna).  He loses his hat to Verna  in a poker game, and he goes back to her apartment to get it--and it is  left on the sill while they fool around.  And Tom says about his dream:  &quot;There's nothing more foolish than a man chasing his hat.&quot;  Ultimately, Tom chooses mind over heart in the end--or does he?  The final  shot shows him methodically putting his hat on so low that we can't even  see his eyes, so he seems to make the cold choice of pure logic--but then,  as he looks after Leo leaving (Leo, who has been hatless throughout, pure  emotion, has now learned something--and he is wearing a yarmulke), the  camera sneaks in under the brim of Tom's hat to see his eyes.  It is rare  for a movie to understand its character's so well.  Wonderful filmmaking
B000002JKA|5.0|I'm probably overheating my CD player, given how many times I hear this CD. It's got some great tunes in it, my favorites being &quot;Caught in a web&quot; (I'm addicted to that one!), &quot;Voices&quot;,  &quot;Scarred&quot; and &quot;Space-Dye Vest&quot;. This is a great CD. I  just can't get enough of these truly mind-blowing musicians.  Congratulations to all, and keep the good music coming!
B00002Z88D|3.0|What is that? I'm sorry to say, but this one is a BIG disappointment to a &quot;TRUE&quot;Metallica fan....3 stars go out to Michael Kamen (who is the mastermind behind this project)..Mind you, the Metallica side was  already written.Theorchestra had to blend in (or keep up), with the band  playing an otherwise 'regular' show. A &quot;new&quot; fan would really  like it's &quot;Bob Rock&quot;-influenced sound. It sounds just as  commercial as the top 40 hits of the black album. If you are 25 or younger,  you will LOVE it! ....If you are a fan from the  &quot;Lightning/Puppets&quot; days, don't waste your time.....
0684872153|5.0|The only negative thing I can find to say about this book is that I have no idea, after reading it, where the title comes from. After that there is nothing but good. McCourt injects pathos in potentially miserable  situaions, and humor where there is grimness. His style is unique because,  given the subject matter, the reader expects a ponderous tome but here,  instead, is a comic jaunt into despair. And it is this 'jaunty' quality  which allows the reader to read on despite the misery, despite the anger at  the father, the desire to shake the mother and to slap a few relatives  along the way. At the end one can only hand it to the victims of poverty  who survive to write with such wit and humor. Thank you Mr. McCourt for  sharing, and for giving the reader moments of laughter when a person in  that situation must certainly find nothing to laugh about.  A potentially  depressing book rendered delightful. Certainly a MUST READ.
B000001ELR|5.0|Kiss is my favorite band, so I always listen to sound samples on the Internet from different albums to see which ones to get. When I heard Creatures Of The Night, I liked it a lot. This is the most heavy-metal-like  Kiss album I have ever heard. There is not a single song on here that I  don't like. I highly recommend it if you like Kiss. <br />P.S. Love Gun is  good too.
B000000993|5.0|This CD is one everyone should have. All the songs on it are great and the best ones are Prison Sex and Disgustipated. This CD might freak some people out. It always makes me think of people with no limbs or deformed puppets.  They go good with their music videos too. Pick this one up now if your  don't already own it.
0679746048|4.0|Me, I liked the &quot;smart-ness&quot; of the book. I liked how the character picked apart things ... detailed them .. even at the boring parts.<br />Descriptions were full and possibly over flowing with imagery. And  maybe I'm slightly batty myself, but its hard not to picture some of the  settings, people, etc.<br />What I didn't really like were the interaction (or  lack thereof) between some of the other characters mentioned and the main  character. While I know its commone to in passing mention one person, and  then go on about things ... but the way the people seemed to be described  from the main characters view point, you'd think there would be a whole lot  more interaction ... even if they were confined to the walls of an  instituion .. or ice cream palor.<br />I figure, after you finished reading  the book, chunk for chunk, random character after another, descriptive  paragraph(s) one and two; You're either relating and thinking, or you're  cursing the author. It's definetly the type of book thats &quot;to each his  own.&quot;
0920668372|5.0|This book gives us a view of the beginning to the end of life, and causes  us to really contemplate our values.
B00000K2SC|5.0|out of ALL the many movies i have seen throughout my life, this is THE best. from the suberbly choreographed kung fu scenes, to the in depth  biblical referenced storyline, it is the best movie i have seen, i've seen  it at least 10 times and know theres people out there whove probably seen  it 3 times that at least.not much more else to say except that it still is  not perfect, (the phone dropping and door bouncing-through-flames special  effect) but for anyone who has not seen this movie, i command you to go  RIGHT NOW and watch it! enough said
0446525537|5.0|I read this excpecting it to be just another book with the trite boy meets girl story line. Boy was i surprised.  once i opened it i could not put it down and read it all in one night.  As promised, i laughed throughout the  book and eventually had tears streaming down my face! i could not stop  crying for hours afterward! i raved so much about this magnificent work  that my entire family read it within a week after!
0679746048|5.0|I bought this book and wanted to read it before going to see the movie.  I didn't know the complete details, such as the writer of girl, was in Mclean Hospital in Belmont, MA.  I didn't know the whole story, and now I do.  It  was like reading someone's diary..  but better.  Keysen's experience  sounded similar as I have family members' who have been in psychiatric  hospitals.  I think they would benefit from reading this book. It was also  interesting to see the point of view as the events were happening. I also  think Keysen is an amazingly talented writer, and I look forward to reading  her other books.
0393307050|5.0|Would recommend this set of books to anyone.  This first novel takes about 100 pages to get into - the amount of sea jargon to absorb might be daunting - but if you get this far then you are home free.<br />The books have  everything: excellent character development, thoughtful prose, interesting  settings geographically and historically, very gripping plots.  I like best  that the author assumes that his reader is capable of getting it without  hitting the reader over the head.<br />These books are true treasures.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I got a recording of this album from a friend of mine for Christmas.  It's a TERRIFIC album, so filled with life that you feel amazed at how easy life has been for you, compared to those songs.

B000002UJQ|5.0|The American mainstream of the 1990s was so congested with poor repetitive rock acts that I was shocked upon discovering this album. I admit, I am new to Radiohead's music; Pablo Honey having been a bad introduction to the  band. OK Computer was everything that I was beginning to miss in rock  music. The sound is huge and driving; each song taking a life of its own.  Thom Yorke broods over it all with a melancholy majesty of a more haunting  brand than his norm. The record tosses off gimmick and decoration...it's  honest. It's powerful. It's what music should be. I am eagerly awaiting  their next efort.
6302878756|5.0|Thiis movie blew my mind. Stallone and Russel at it again, but together!  Who COULDN'T love a movie that pairs that sassy carpenter from &quot;Overboard&quot; and the macho man of &quot;Rambo&quot;?  I give this  movie a place in my Hall of Fame! These gentlemen have distinguished  themselves.    Period.
6302902010|3.0|I want to add my comment about the 1959 version with Dandridge and Poitier ... I saw it at a theater in Munich, Germany in 1960 and loved it.  I will never forget that experience.   I've been looking for the video for years  and couldn't understand why it hasn't been out until I read Michael Evans'  review.<br />I would love to obtain a copy of this if that is possible.   If  anyone knows about this, please email me.
6304145438|5.0|A wonderful feel for family life.  This is must watching every year, especially at Christmas.  The love of man and wife, children, parents and community excel in this film about George Bailey (portrayed wonderfully by James Stewart) who gives up his long life dream of leaving this small town.  He accepts rather grudgingly at first taking over the family based savings and loans.  He marries Mary (played by Donna Reed) and they go through the ups and downs of raising a family.  Despair sets in and George is forced to choose between living or dying.  Clarence an angel who has to earn his wings,is sent to rescue George from despair.  The spirit of family, friends and community is all intertwined to create a wonderful portrait of life and the American dream.
B0000060NA|4.0|Like many double albums,it should've been a single .Theres no denying the brilliance of Sir Duke,I Wish,Isn't She Lovely(though it could've been edited some)and Love's in Need..,but many songs meander too long.When you  first hear SITKOL,you automatically give it up for Stevie.But repeated  listens only show how tedious many songs are(Joy inside My Tears,Ordinary  Pain,Black Man).Granted it's worth owning for the aforementioned songs as  well as the brilliant yet ignored Summer Soft,but you'll find yourself  programming around alot of tracks and i'm sure that won't ever be the case  with Innervisions
B0000214F0|4.0|I have seen this movie 20 years ago on the big screen and I still remember it vividly. It is very graphic but true to history. I think this is a great movie but you do need a strong stomach. Some scenes are quite disturbing  and violent. I always intended to buy this movie but the reviews of the  quality are holding me back somewhat.

044100590X|5.0|Most science fiction is about contemporary humans in futuristic situations. Dune is a rare look at how humans and human institutions might change over time, and that is why it is considered so visionary. Herbert  has deliberately suppressed technology here to leave himself free to  address the future of humanity, rather than the future of humanity's tools.  Dune is also a massive, fascinating story set in one of the richest  universes ever created for science fiction. However, people who don't like  the book are right to point out that it is long, sometimes overblown, and  Herbert is given to having his characters give utterance to endless,  repetitive soliloquies. It's not everyone's cup of tea. But if you can  stick with it and get past the awkward passages, you will be well rewarded.
B00002MZ2T|5.0|Today, many hit artists around the world have achieved their success because of the various songs that they have used from other writers, not themselves.  Savage Garden, I believe, show they have a real talent in  their industry because they not only sing but also write their no.1 hit  songs.<br />They have achieved a no.1 hit once again on this album, which  shows that they are not '1 HIT WONDERS'  like many who attempt at writing  most of their own songs.  This album is a true reflection of their  understanding of the business they are in and their love of music and  appreciation of their talent.
6300248569|5.0|Follows book except for end.  Wish this could be made into DVD.  Have worn out tape format.
B00002Z88D|5.0|SORRY TO ALL THOSE MORONS THAT SAY HAVING THE GREATEST ROCK BAND EVER PLAY WITH A SYMPHANY IS STUPID, BECAUSE IT WAS THE GREATEST MOST IMAGINATIVE THING ANYONE COULD HAVE THOUGHT OF. HAVING THE ORCHESTRA IN THE BACKROUND  GIVES METALLICA A WHOLE NEW, YET STILL ORRIGINAL OLD METALLICA SOUND. EACH  SONG KICKS, THE TWO CDS RULE, SO JUST BUY IT!
052594527X|4.0|Girl with a Pearl Earring deserves the praise it has garnered. Chevalier writes with precision, creativity, and intelligence, and her prose can only be described as lyrical. It's a slim volume and easily read, which I found  a slight disappointment. Given the complexity of Griet and Vermeer--and of  the novel's situation--I expected more complexity from the plot. Griet's  situation seemed to resolve too easily. Nonetheless, Girl with a Pearl  Earring is well worth reading--and rereading. Griet is a fabulous  character, and Chevalier has done a magnificent job bringing her to life.
B000000W5L|5.0|This is simply the finest album ever recorded. The Stones show there rock n roll roots here. Each song has its own feel. Plenty of blues and gospel, and some rock. Sweet Virginia and Let it Loose are two beautiful slow  songs. The Stones transform Robert Johnson's &quot;Stop Breaking Down&quot;  into a blues rocker. Soul Survivor ends this album and leaves you yearning  for more. I can't say enough good things about this album, Its the best.  (Also check out 'Let it Bleed')
6305657947|1.0|I think most people like this movie because it's BEAUTIFUL.Yes, male and female models dressed in gorgeous outfits (sometimes naked) drive outrageously expensive cars, they live in urban luxury or take a break at the Jamaican villa (owned by one of them), talk about true llove, art and  megabucks. It's all VERY, VERY BEAUTIFUL! Anyone wants to be in their shoes  for a couple of hours. <br />But what does it have to do with the moviemaking  in the levels from Kent cigarette commercials and up? The movie too  artificial to resemble the real life and to pass for a caper it's lacking  that twinkle, the tongue in a cheek quality of the genre's  masterpieces.<br />It seems that most commercially successful James Bond wants  to be taken seriously. It's known that Mr. Brosnan is of a rather humble  origin - there is nothing wrong with that, I am not a British Lord myself -  but that explains a lot. <br />What we see is a mega-budget home movie of the  leading actor who is also a producer.
B00002Z88D|2.0|This has got to be their worst effort to date. This CD is nothing like their Binge and Purge album, even their new songs lack the Metallica feel they seem to be losing more and more every album. Very disappointing!
0790729628|4.0|blade runner was ahead of it's time. with stunning visuals and a attention to the sets and to lighting, to really make this an enjoyable film to watch. it is not packed full of action, but it is not meant to be. there is  alot of thinking that the viewer does about the content of this film. it  has a feel of what i consider true sci-fi rather than space-opera. the  acting is overall superb by all involved and there are alot of cleve little  twists and ideas throughout. i definetly recommend giveing it a watch. my  only commplaints are the sound on my dvd version are pro-logic not digital  and there is a total absence of extra features. however the film itself is  brillant.
B000002H2H|5.0|This is without a doubt their best album. Many outstanding tracks, a most for any Metallica fan.
0679746048|2.0|I was very dissapointed with the lack of depth.The subject material was fascinating knowing that it really did occur, but it could have been a much more interesting read. I was left with a desire to know more about what  happened to each character.
0767802519|4.0|The Professional is a great movie to watch I like it.Luc Besson is a great director,he put action  friendship,love altogether in this movie.         Jean Reno is a good french actor play (LEON) help Matilda to take down the  D.E.A. Natalie Portman(MATILDA) she a awesome actress she smart and bad I  like her in this movie.I gave this movie four star instead of five because  there four scenes been cut I was little disappointed BUT!  its still a  great movie to enjoyed.
B0000027I6|2.0|Once again, I fell victim to glowing reviews and purchased a CD without listening to it.  What are you people talking about?  This album is not good. Waters' voice is shot and I resent being beaten over the head with  his social commentary.  A little more lyrical subtlety would have suited  me.<br />Musically, I was nearly lulled to sleep several times before even  reaching the fifth track. Plain and simple, John Lennon needed Paul  McCartney, Roger Waters needs David Gilmour.  And vice versa on those, by  the way.<br />I respect Waters as an artist, and usually revere him as a  lyricist, but he missed the mark CLEARLY on this CD.<br />Overly long,  funeral-paced, and not lacking for obvious social cliches, Amused To Death  dies a slow one.<br />And what the heck is he thanking FLEA for in the  acknowledgements anyway?
6304578482|4.0|Lisa Kudrow and Mira Sorvino were perfect to play thoose parts...This movie is really funny, and what makes it even better is that it has all kinds of 80's music in it to make fun of.  Their are occasional slow parts  but the speed of the movie always comes right back up with a funny line  from Romy or Michelle..Their stupidity and ditzy way of like is something  that makes you love the two charicters. Who would of ever imagined going to  your high school reunion and making up a story to make your peers belive  your successful.
068484267X|5.0|A vivid, sad and real story. When you're about to cry, you start to laugh to the little details caught by a 9 year old boy's eyes. It's the story of life, success and sincere love.
0920668372|5.0|My teacher read this to our 8th grade lit. class.  She cried through the  book and I wondered why as an 8th grader she was crying from reading a  childrens book???  Now that I am grown and a mother of 3 children, I now  understand!!!!! Something incredible happened to me---I turned into a  mother and now I love this book.  Always makes me tear up!  My kids love  it!!!
0782008372|1.0|This is one of my all time favourite films. How disapointed was I that the picture quality is so poor - my humble VHS copy is better. What a waste of money
B000031WD8|3.0|Only three stars for the &quot;drink the beer&quot; scene, the &quot;internet/bedroom&quot; scene, and the &quot;school bathroom&quot; scene. The rest I wanted to like, but the flick went into typical high  school hijinks then meandered like the lost exchange student on campus. The  choir competiton was just too sappy, I don't care if it's supposed to be  part of the story, those characters and their lines sounded like grammar  school-play material. Eugene Levy's great as the dad. Get it for a couple  hilarious laughs, but not a great flick as a whole.
0451169514|5.0|I bought this book after the first time I'd seen the movie, back in its ABC showing in 1990. I didn't actually bother to read this one until recently; I dreaded doing so because anyone who has seen the page number  knows this book is no lightweight.<br />Boy, I really should have started  sooner. This book is great! It made a King fan out of me, and I went on to  read three more of his books. The Stand may be longer and may have more  characters. The Shining may be scarier. The Tommyknockers may have been  more to-the-point. This, though... was a masterpiece! I couldn't get enough  of the seven main characters: Bill, Eddie, Ben, Stan, Richie, Bev, and  Mike. If King had to make this book three times as long, I wouldn't have  minded a bit, provided that extra space was devoted to the kids. Like in  the movie, the kids made this book worth a read. I didn't find the adults  to be as entertaining, although they were certainly interesting in their  own right.<br />I'll admit that this book had its flaws (Bev's little menage  with the others; an ending that pales in comparison to the rest of the  book; I didn't like that only five of the seven were part of the final  confrontation, and then one died; sporadic typos; an unnecessarily long  biography of Patty Uris), but I'd never dock the book any stars for that  stuff. It's definitely the perfect part of any Stephen King fan's  library!<br />As far as the movie that followed this book, it was good for  getting a mental picture of the children (all of whom were impressively  well-acted, especially Brandis, Green--the two who went on to become more  famous--Heller, and Taylor--neither of whom got so lucky; Faizel, Crane,  and Perkins were exceptional too), but it was generally far inferior to the  book.
B00003XB8K|5.0|now look I know that some people think that this stuff is boring but it really isn't it's a beautiful peace of work,This cd kicks if your new to his music I suggest that you get this one it's close to the best album at  least so I think. The cd that I like is his second enigma cd The cross of  changes it's very cool but if you don't have this cd get it let me suggest  numbers 3,5,9 those are the best on the cd I think so get the cd and go  home very very happy.
0192834711|5.0|The Moonstone is one of those books that, while the first in a particular genre, still holds fast over time. Masterfully written, its themes are  surprisingly contemporary more often than not--the use of opiates to delve  into the unconscious, the moral arguments about stealing relics from  imperial colonies.  The twists and turns are stunning, but they're used to  a greater aim: to map the contours of human interaction.  The intro in this  edition is particularly well written as well.
068484267X|5.0|I just finished the book not more than 3 hours ago.  I am deffinately not a reader, but decided to start on one of my Christmas presents anyways. I am so impressed and inspired by this book, surely the greatest that I have  ever read.  When I got done with it was the first time in 3 days that I  have put it down.  I can't wait to run to the bookstore and continue the  story with 'Tis.
B000001F3C|5.0|This is perhaps one of the top 10 rock albums of all time
B000031XCR|4.0|I really want this album because I love Celine Dion's music. 'That's the way it Is' is an awesome song, but where are her earlier songs?  This album also needs those songs. Oh, people who do and don't like Celine, please  e-mail me. ;-)
B00000253N|5.0|Blood On The Tracks is the closest any man has gotten to capturing true human emotions.  Everything else pales in comparison.  A mere sigh from Dylan on this album is enough to consider him a genius.  We are all truly  in his debt for giving us this gift.  In the music you see yourself, who  you were, are, and will be.  Every face that has passed in front of your  eyes is there in vibrant colors. The friends you've made, the love you've  lost.  It will nurse any emotional wound.  The music pours like blood from  a broken heart.  This album could stand against any piece of music ever  recorded. What Beethoven, Bach, and Mozart did in a 45min symphony, Bob  does in a single line.  What Shakespeare accomplished in  his great works,  Dylan surpasses with one breath into his harmonica.  This is the nucleus of  humanity.  This isn't  Dylan the rock star, this is Bob, a friend who has  shared and suffered the same tragedies in life that you have.  If you  cannot relate to this album, you simply haven't lived or loved.
0792837533|3.0|Considering the villagers had only had 'the miracle' going for two days (in their eyes), they seem mighty scared of strangers and set in their ways. Not a very believable premise, but a pleasant diversion of a movie.
B000002IGP|5.0|RATT entered the public consciousness with a bang via \\"Out of the Cellar,\\" beginning with the ultra-cool tune \\"Wanted Man,\\" perhaps one of the best \\"heavy metal\\" songs to come out of the 1980s. When my friend told me back in 1984 that the hit \\"Round and Round\\" was \\"the worst song on the album,\\" he may not have been too far off the mark. And that's saying a lot, because \\"Round and Round\\" is an awesome tune that even my dad liked back then; and it's one of the few RATT songs that still receives ample radio airplay today. My least favorite tune on this record is, ironically, the other single that was released for radio and MTV, \\"Back for More.\\" And even that song is pretty cool.<br /><br />Similar to Def Leppard, RATT specialized in tight production (thanks to producer Beau Hill) and huge choruses that were arena-ready and impossible not to sing along with. RATT's \\"Out of the Cellar\\" began a great streak of 10-song records by the band that were a fine marriage of pop and seriously groovin' heavy metal. Case in point, \\"In Your Direction,\\" written by lead singer Stephen Pearcy, contains an almost dance-ish vibe that was a noticeable notch above much of the `80s fluff that surrounded it at the time. And there was always something about the singer's half-rasp, half-growl that seemed pretty cool to me. Still does, in fact.<br /><br />\\"Side 2\\" begins with Pearcy and Juan Croucier's machine-like \\"Lack of Communication,\\" an impressive attempt at social consciousness, perhaps RATT's only such endeavor. (\\"Too many problems the world can't solve/Too many people, no one wants to be involved!\\") Whereas \\"Lack of Communication\\" speaks of social isolation in a world gone awry, most of \\"Out of the Cellar\\" is comprised of the mundane issues that typical heavy metal dudes in their 20s would sing about: women, an out-of-control lifestyle and being present at the \\"scene of the crime.\\"<br /><br />Though future RATT records would also rock hard and be considered worthy by the band's fans, there were elements of this special CD that set it apart: It was a bit rawer, darker, edgier, less sex-obsessed and less generic than future efforts. Additionally, every song is a catchy gem, basically pop music with large-than-life guitars and a raspy, confident lead singer who never seemed like too nice of a guy.<br /><br />Just to fully give \\"Out of the Cellar\\" its proper merit, the closing song, \\"Scene of the Crime,\\" features a guitar intro that reminds me a lot of the famous intro to \\"Sweet Child o' Mine\\" -- the Guns n' Roses classic that was released three years later.e were elements of this special CD that set it apart: It was a bit rawer, darker, edgier, less sex-obsessed and less generic than future efforts.

6304546386|5.0|I can't add anything to the other excellent review of this fabulous film. I just wanted to say I laugh at some of the scenes for the wrong reasons and I blame Daffy Duck! Cartoons DO have a bad influence. A buck and a  quarter staff hahaha
B00001OH7J|5.0|One of the unsung discs of the late Rory Gallagher's canon. The energy and intensity bristle and leap from the speakers. Rory had stripped the band down and recorded as a trio, which only benefitted the songs and  performance. &quot;The Mississippi Sheiks&quot; contains transcendant slide  guitar and references to great blues artists  like Peg Leg Howell and Bo  Carter.  DO YOUR SELF A FAVOR ...BUY THIS! We miss you , Rory!
B00000J6AG|5.0|The songs on this CD are more like 'songs' than your average techno.  The songs have many layers, vocals, and lots of melody.  There is none of the usual long periods of beats with no change.  You have probably heard the  songs Porcelain and Body Rock making their way into commercials.  That is  because they are excellent.  This is the only album of 1999 where the  majority of songs are good.  In a year with almost no good new music, Play  is an incredible suprise.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I love Limp Bizkit!  They are a great group. They show a lot of appreciation for their fans. Fred Durst can REALLY express himself with music. This is a great cd.
0517082454|5.0|Edgar Allan Poe sure does something with writting and reality that all of us would like to do.  He is able to write all autobiographies, but substatute it with something that you wouldn't even imangine that he is  talking about himself.  He has to be the author that suffered the most his  whole life.  But now after his death, we learn to appreciate his life, and  his place when he was here on earth.  He is the best author that ever lived  until this very day.
0451196716|5.0|If asked what my favorite Stephen King novel is I automatically answer &quot;It.&quot; But in order to include the other King work that I consider  my favorite, I always say that &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is my favorite  novella of SK's. True enough.<br />I first read &quot;The Long Walk&quot; as  part of &quot;The Bachman Books&quot; and it impressed me even then. I  recently picked up a copy of the novella in a single volume; I was thrilled  to discover this version.<br />I tend to re-read many of SK's works over and  over and &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is definitely one I never tire of.<br />I  seem to get something new out of the story every time I read it.<br />The main  characters are very real. My favorite is McVries. And their fates are  heart-wrenching.<br />You all know the story of the Long Walk by now. Several  reviewers have tried to instill some sort of deep significance and  underlying meaning into the tale (the day-to-day &quot;rat-race&quot; that  is the work place; sending our boys to Vietnam; the march to the Nazi death  camps). And although I can honestly see some of each scenario in the story,  I really don't think King is using this novella as a metaphor for anything.  Which is not to say that King isn't &quot;deep&quot; within his literature.  I just think he leaves the &quot;politics&quot; of writing to others and  concentrates on STORY-telling.<br />Remember what writer Bill Denbrough said  in &quot;IT:&quot; &quot;Why can't a story, just be a story?&quot;<br />Enough  said.<br />As for the ending, it did not disappoint me the first time I read  it nor does it now. But I will admit that I've had to do a lot of thinking  about the last couple of pages to form an opinion of what I believe  happens.<br />The dark figure whom Garrity runs towards at the end can only be  the Grim Reaper himself. Death appears to be waiting for Ray at the end of  his agonizing Long Walk.<br />They say that hell is repetition. I only hope  that heaven is Garrity's final destination; and that his last journey will  allow Ray Garrity to finally 'sit down in the middle of the road.'
B00000J7J4|4.0|Music is about creativity and CHANGE.  C'mon.  Give the guy a break.  Santana wants to (break out of his OLD music-mold) and give his old listeners a wake up call! I liked it.  I'm a musician of 35 years and  recommend it to others with an &quot;ear&quot;.
B000005DQR|4.0|This is a true album, the tracks fitting together like pieces of a puzzle.  It's one of those albums that you can just fall into.  The Jazz influences are very apparent.  I think my favorite track is &quot;Midnight in a  Perfect World,&quot; the drums and vocals are in such contrast yet they fit  together really well.  A very chill album.
B00000J7RZ|5.0|I am a true believer of giving an artist a chance! It took me a long time before I finally broke down and bought the Jennifer Lopez CD because I wanted to hear more songs and see more videos before I put my money out.  But this CD is Great!  I know that everyone focuses on the rumors of the  world but you've got to admit that this girl has talent!  Jennifer's songs  are on cue and the videos are really nice to look at!  I would recommend  this CD to my closes friends (actually I let a few friends listen to her CD  and two of them bought their own copies)!  For those of you who says that  Mariah is better than Jennifer you should look twice!  The only reason  Mariah is in so many videos is because she puts out music CD like cats have  babies.  And if you'll ever notice shes always in a vdieos with black  R&amp;B and Rap artists but you don't ever see her in public with them.  Also, from her last few CDs you can tell that she is getting greedy by  finishing her CDs too quickly!  Mariah's first CD was the best one for me.  Since then I have'nt wasted my money on any Mariah!<br />JENNIFER IS THE  BOMBBBBB DIGGITYYY!  GIVE HER THE PROPS SHE DESERVES!  IT'S NOT EASY IN THE  MUSIC WORLD AND SHE HAS MADE IT!<br />I DO THINK SHE SHOULD SLOW HER  RELATIONSHIP DOWN WITH PUFFY BECAUSE HE DESTROYS HER IMAGE ANYMORE THAN HE  HAS ALREADY!<br />GOOD LUCK JENNIFER!  I LIKETHE NEW YORK HIP HOP STYLE MUSIC  YOU WRITE AND THE VIDEOS AGAIN ARE FLY!<br />PEACE,
B00000IL1K|5.0|This is just one of the most refreshing and upbeat albums.  Sarah has done it again, she nevers seizes to amaze me on how she can mix two uniquely opposite types of music such as Pop and Opera and always turn out a  wonderful album.  I have to say I love the Title track with an almost Monk  type Chant yet then it becomes Pop, or when she sings Nessun Dorma (1 of  only 3 women to ever attempt singing it).  I cannot praise this album  enough, In fact I saw her in the Eden Concert twice because you just can't  get any better than Sarah.  This album will get you through the best and  worst of times, I listen everyday during my 3 hour commutes.  You can't get  better than this album, well until her next comes out.
B00000JGOH|5.0|Shakespeare in Love is quite simply an immense masterpiece at every level. It is easily the greatest film I have ever seen, and quite likely the greatest film ever made. I left the theatre in a state of amazement and  utter rapture. I wanted to paint, to write, to love, to cry, to scream out  loud, to hug everyone I saw. What a tremendous effect this movie has had on  me! Shakespeare In Love is to cinema what Beethoven's Ninth Symphony is to  music and Michaelangelo's  &quot;Creation&quot; is to painting.
0782008372|3.0|THE MOVIE: Who listens to critics? Ignore the bad reviews written at the time of the theatrical release (1985). The plot is original and suspenseful. The action is well-executed and never overdone. The camerawork  is incredible, as are the scene transitions. Sean Connery and Clancy Brown  really bring it home, acting-wise.<br />THE DISC (DVD): Get the tape. You're  just wasting your money by getting this movie on DVD. The picture is  grainy; 30-year-old movies have been remastered better than this one. The  sound separation is mediocre, and the editing is terrible: expect to turn  up your stereo twice as loud for dialogue, then half as loud for action  scenes. Compared to the DVD, the tape is 99% as good at 66% of the price.  For these reasons, I took a star away from my review of this DVD.
6303022901|5.0|This movie is truly one of the most extraordinary movies I've ever had the pleasure of watching.  This movie deals with the love and struggle between the mothers and their daughters.  One doesn't necessarily have to be an Asian to relate to this movie, anyone can relate to this movie.  I can't  believe the Academy Awards ditched this magnificent piece of art.  This  movie should have been nominated in every single category in the Oscars and  won all of them.
B000006YYW|5.0|This is my favourite album since it was first released in 1983-84. It is really the state of the art material from the Brother Gibb. Whenever i have run out of idea which album to play, i always put this on and it always  turn my mood on.
B00000K19E|5.0|I've enjoyed intelligent sci fi films, such as Blade Runner and RoboCop (the first), and this movie definately fights its way to the top of my list.  I am in my forties, a woman, and I still loved it.  The story line  helps you overlook the flaws in some of the &quot;logic,&quot; but the  special effects are superb.  Give it a try, even if you are wary of special  effects laded sci fi movies.

B000003CMB|5.0|this is the greatest rock album i have ever heard. period. this band was unreal. duane was the greatest guitar soloist ever, and behind his power was a band that played every note tight, clear, and with conviction.  this  band loved to play, and oh man, this album is magical.
B000005IU2|5.0|far and away the best stooges album, this one's dark, dirty, and primal. raw power isn't bad, but this one sounds like the band playing armaggedon, while power sounds like the best bar band on the planet. if you're a fan of  punk, this is where you must begin
B000002ADT|5.0|I will spare all the b.s. and get straight to the point.  if i had the choice of taking one album with me to my grave, kind of blue would be it.  it's become one of the most indespensible parts of my life. read the liner  notes and you would realize that i had this in common with duane allman,  who is probably listening to it right now up there somewhere. i hope i've  made my point.
0792842073|5.0|I thought this was a great movie when I had seen it in the theaters when it first came out but after having seen it again on video I have to say this movie now replaces Goodfellas as my favorite movie of all time.  Susan  Sarandon was an easy choice for best actress and Sean Penn should have won  best actor - he is as good as there is in this type of role.  The entire  supporting cast was brilliant as well, so much so that you'll sometimes  forget you're actually watching a movie and not a documentary.  Beautiful  Louisiana scenery.  Great, perfectly fitting music by Bruce Springsteen.  Superbly scripted.  This movie can make you laugh and cry at the same time.    It was also nice that a major motion picture finally portrayed a  religious figure (a nun) in a positive light.  I cannot even think of a  single flaw this movie had.  If I had to write this movie myself , I don't  know if I would change a thing.
6305078564|5.0|Others here have said all there is to say about the content but we were very disappointed with the picture quality, given the sumptious nature of the production. Amazingly, a P&amp;P DVD is not available in the UK and I  ordered this version hoping to use it as a DVD showcase gift to my wife.  Our TV is NTSC-compatible, with region 1 films looking great. However, the  PAL/NTSC transfer is so poor that our VHS tapes look better! A shame when  the production is almost as much a visual treat as it is a literary one.
B000002HRE|4.0|But only AS good!<br />Tracks like Low Man's Lyric continue in the change of attitued which was dominant in Load whereas Fuel and Unforgiven II (favorite on the album) show the band still clinging to their roots. If you  were not a fan of Load (as many of you clearly were not) then there isn't  much point in buying this. However, if, like me, you accepted the pace  change and appreciated the aforementioned album then this should be ideal!
0385334206|4.0|This is a comedy classic.  Quick read that you'll read again, because it is so funny.  Vonnegut the &quot;Creator&quot; makes light of everything and everybody.
6305426651|5.0|I'm a very big foreign movies fan. My personal favorites are Bergman,Fellini,Truffaut,and Kurosawa. The idea that many people HATE foreign movies based on the fact that they are FOREIGN and therefore have  to read subtitles is,to be perfectly frank..dumb! I don't mean to sound  dogmatic in any way,but it is. This is a great movie and the fact that  people haven't seen it because it's foreign is dumb. Having said that  another thing that bothers me is that there are people who look at this  movie in the wrong point of view. There're saying that Benigni should not  of taken upon this subject in the attitude in which he did. ALL WRONG!  This movie doesn't make a mockery of WW2. On the contrary! The movie does  in fact show the harsh realities that happened during the war! The ending  of the film demonstrates that. I don't want to give it away. I'm trying to  get people to buy or at least rent it. A great piece of film making. To be  prefectly honest I didn't think a movie like this could be made in today's  day and age. It's a very simple story and very entertaining. WATCH IT AND  SEE!
B00002E23H|4.0|Interesting computer graphics and likable characters, but, except for who gets to survive, the plot is pretty average horror. I'd watch it, but I will not keep it.
0440180295|3.0|It's a book that consists out of flashbacks. That makes it hard to read. The main character barely survives the war and looks quite silly. You can't sympathise with his feelings, concerning for instance the Dresden bombing  and his inprisoning, because he doesn't seem to have any.
B00000K19E|5.0|Interesting plot twists, eye-popping special effects, delicious fights, attractive costumes and Kianu Reeves... What else to ask from a movie? One to own.
068484267X|5.0|It is a very well written novel about a young boy growing up in a rather weird household. He writes very lightly about, in my opion, disasters happening to him and his family. Alcoholisme, unwanted pregnancies and the  death of of some of his siblings.

B00000IL67|5.0|This is a must have for any diehard alice fan. Going all the way back to the mid 60's to today all the classics are represented. Possibly the best box set ever released. Many classics including  &quot;Eighteen&quot;,&quot;School's Out&quot;,&quot;Poison&quot;,as well as  lost classics like the 1980 hit &quot;Clones, (Were All). A must get for  any fan buy it today!
B00000295Y|5.0|I was at the record store and I had my doubts about this Cd, but I bought it and and was impressed by there good beats and lyrics about guns and puffing on J's. My favorite track is &quot;Hits from the Bong&quot;. It's  mad funny and mad fresh.
0780622650|4.0|Obviously, the majority of reviewers have never watched the television series or have neglected to recollect the nature of the series. As a much younger viewer, the one thing that stands out about watching Lost in Space  on Sunday mornings was the inherent &quot;quirkiness&quot; of the show. The  robots slinky arms and the cheap planet sets only added to the show's  appeal. Although the yellow monkey was absolutely out of place in the  movie, young Penny and Will were frequently keeping alien pets in the  series. In short, I was able to overlook the films flaws, accept them as  remaining consistent with the quirky television series, and enjoy the  experience. The picture and sound quality of the DVD were good and Gary  Oldman's performance outstanding.  craze
B000009ED0|2.0|I expected more out of &quot;Devil without a cause&quot;. The only good songs on the Cd is the ones that have made it big. It has nothing to do with the obseinities on this album. I happen to be one of the most biggest  Insane Clown Posse fans you'll ever meet. Throught this cd his extremly  large ego as well as his low talent shows as clear as glass. Id like to see  Joe C go solo for he is the only one with the real talent next to Kid Rock.
B00000J7J4|2.0|I was in a department store today, and I heard a cut from this cd.I guess they thought it was good elevator music too.
B000003CKH|5.0|I like very much this song,this is the best song that I ever hear, but I really want to get the lyrics, would there anybody can help me to get I'll be survive's lyric....?
0060926317|1.0|This book which purports to be &quot;true&quot; and only published as fiction to &quot;protect the identities of the Real People&quot; is total hogwash.<br />Full of New Age psychobabble, borrowing myths from all over the  world and mainly the North American continent -- this woman would have us  believe that her account of going &quot;walkabout&quot; with a bunch of  Australian aborigines is true. It is not. It has been resoundly denounced  by every Aborigine nation in Australia. Yet it continues to sell to the  gullible.<br />This book belongs in the same category as the Celestine  Prophecy and the Conversations with God series -- interesting fantasies  which should not be taken too seriously.
6304712936|5.0|I like to know if this dvd is in Spanish too
6300275213|5.0|I really liked this video because it had great pictures of the sea. It also had me laughing throughout the whole movie. It had good themes and a good script. I recommend it to anyone!
B00003XACV|5.0|At last Dreamworks has decided to release this, one of the year's finest scores.<br />This stunning score has many of Newman's trademark touches, especially in the piano solos, but it's the instrumentation that makes this  album unique.  With the inspired use of tablas, vibes and less conventional  string intruments, this sounds unlike any Hollywood movie score.  If you've  not seen the film, it would be hard to believe how this would work for a  satire of suburban life, but it compliments the film beautifully.  It's  Thomas Newman's best score since The Shawshank Redemption.  Highly  recommended.
B000001FI7|5.0|probably the most underrated album in the US. if you liked &quot;sour times (nobody loves me)&quot;, guess what? that isn't the best track of of the album..  this album would be about an 8-stars if i could give it.
0783221487|4.0|It is close to the book, even though it's somewhat compressed version. I like the acting, too. However, special effects are not so special. They often look very artificial, cut-and-paste type... Maybe next remake will  take care of that.
0440234743|5.0|This was a great read! Couldn't put it down. I read it on my lunch hour, at stop lights, in waiting rooms. I was truly sorry when I reached the last page. Nate was an interesting, likeable, character.  Can't wait to read  Grisham's next book
B00001OH1S|4.0|Like a few other reviewers, I agree this cd is too short!   Great tunes for driving - particulary Sinnerman!  If you get one soundtrack CD this year, make it this one!  Enjoy!
B00002E23E|5.0|I've not seen a video of a live performance with such raw energy and talent since watching Led Zep performing in the movie &quot;The Song Remains The same&quot;.  Jimmy Page really tapps into &quot;the Cosmic  Energy&quot; as Robert Plant refers to it.  Some music can really stir the  soul and Zeppelin's music really hits the spot.  It takes certain  frequencies to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and cause one to  feel good; like Hendrix and Pink Floyd they were the masters.  Cosidering  it was 1976 when I first viewed &quot;The Song&quot;,Iwould have to say  that it was ahead of its time especially with the &quot;Dazed and  Confused&quot; clip.
0156711427|4.0|There are times, I'll admit, when Forster's novel seems a bit dry, a bit lacking in character (and character development), and a bit prolix. Nevertheless, some of the prose is absolutely stunning, and the end of the  book (in my opinion) is one of the most beautiful achievements in any  novel. A book I would highly recommend.
B000002E5J|5.0|The first album I bought by Shakira was the Donde estan los ladrones? album. I got the album constantly coming up in my recommendations list, I clicked the link, listened to some of the samples and I decided to give it a shot. As you can see in my review there I was amazed by the quality of  the songs and the recording. Donde estan los ladrones? shows the multi  talented artist Shakira at her best and I loved the album from the first  note till its last. Over the last three weeks this album has been in my  CD-player, constantly playing in the 'repeat' and 'random' mode and every  moment I discover new things, new emotions in the songs I hadn't noticed  before. If you like good music you can buy the Donde estan los ladrones?  album safely, satisfaction guaranteed. So what about the Pies Descalzos  album? Well, it was Shakira's debut album but it's of the same quality as  Donde estan los ladrones? Although it seems a little like she is developing  her own style of recording (experimenting with sounds and settings and  figuring out how everything fits together best) the album contains  excellent songs, good lyrics and great compositions. So I've got a small  luxuary problem: which of both albums will stay in my CD-player for the  next weeks for I only have one CD-player?
0316152196|4.0|The intrigue and actions of the primary characters throughout the book kept my interest and became a great, quick read.  Disappointed with the  ending. Seemed out of character with the overall tone of the story.
0446604844|4.0|The first 100 pages made me cringe because of the bad style. Can't believe he got this past the editors. But after I got used to that, I started enjoying the multiple twists and relentless pace. It's a good, albeit not  very believable story. The characters, mainly Sidney, Lee and the killer, I  forgot his name, are about the same: Well drawn, but you wouldn't exactly  expect them to be out there in the real world!
0684852756|5.0|Not exactly the happiest book I've ever read but certainly one of the best examples of dealing with separation. The chronicle of the slow demise of Jay's love for his lover cuts deeply into the heart strings because anyone  who has been in a long term relationship can recognise and understand  exactly what he is thinking. Torn between the nedd to find personal  fulfillment or duty he opts for the personal fulfillment whilst many of us  though wanting that, spend our lives on the duty side because we cannot  bear the emotional strength it would take to leave He loves his sons dearly  and is a good father but cannot stay because he can no longer bear to be  shackled to a relationship with his partner in which he feels there is no  longer even tolerance let alone love. It is a situation which he feels is  robbing him of his very self and he opts to leave without a warning. The  slow realisation that he maybe never loved her and never felt passion for  her has left him exhausted and with an unbearable guilt and sadness that so  much time has been wasted. Despite this he still manages to throw a selfish  streak into it by admitting his passion for other women etc which does at  least make you see him as not completely without fault. All in all it is an  overwhelming book which pulls on your very emotional core just because it  is so bitingly real. A must read for anyone who has gone through a break up  without really understanding the reason why their partner left.

B000003CKH|4.0|&quot;The Distance&quot; is the BOMB!  I would have gave this cd five stars if the hole cd is more like &quot;The Distance&quot; I find my self singing it everywhere on the computer, at school, at night, in my head,  when I'm doing nothing, homework, and even in the shower!
B000000I0I|5.0|Of Oldfield's early period of composition, this is the standout piece. Keep in mind the youth of the composer, who, at 17 composed Hergest Ridge and at 18 Tubular Bells (They were released in reverse order)now started to  achieve a mature style with Ommadawn.    The composition is built around  four themes in the manner of a classical symphony. The third section with  bagpipe solo by the Chieftains' Paddy Maloney is worth the price of the  album alone. If you have never heard this man's work, I would urge you to  start with this cd.   Oldfield, IMHO went through a major transition  following the release of this album and only occasionally produced anything  approaching its brilliance thereafter.
B000003TAL|5.0|Daydream Nation proves that avant-garde guitar noise can be a thing of sheer beauty. Every song on this album is perfect. Highlights include &quot;Teen Age Riot&quot;, &quot;Silver Rocket&quot;, &quot;Eric's  Trip&quot; and &quot;Total Trash&quot;. A must for fans of Nirvana, Beck  etc.
B00000163G|5.0|2Pac is by far my favorite rap artist, he has a great voice,beats,and themes. This album was one of his best and the first double disc in rap. I belive that 2pac is still alive and will come back one day. 2PAC 4 LIFE

B000003TAW|5.0|i've had this album since the month it came out. the summer after 6th grade in '94. and i still listen to the thing all the time!  a total classic (in my collection. should be in yours too!) with songs that never  even made it on the radio. they deserve much more airtime in boston. please  buy this album if you're considering. it is completely worth your money.  these guys derve a grammy or something worth putting on the mantle to show  off. absolutely brilliant-                   rivers, i love you.
B0000214F0|5.0|This is one the best movies that have ever been made.World famous actors and actresses, brilliant director, talented photographer, genius costume designer and unique script have made \\"Caligula\\" my favorite movie  for the years. No matter what the tasteless critics say, it is not about  porn,it is all about the true history of Ancient Rome. Those explicit  sexual scenes were not only required but perfectly added in order to  show the sharpness and beauty of this classic masterpiece.
B000002NIW|5.0|Madonna signed these guys? It only proves she's hot and smart! This whole band has got some serious talent. Everything on this rules. My favorite song is &quot;Be Quiet and Drive(far away)&quot; 'cause it's just too beautiful. &quot;My Own Summer(shove it)&quot; is the best song you can  have to open this album, and the video for it just rules. I also love  &quot;Headup&quot; and &quot;Lotion&quot; but it's hard to set apart the  best 'cause they all rule.
B0000025D0|4.0|Maybe this isn't as uplifting as Born To Run but there's still plenty of emotion throughout this record.  Many of the songs deal with the blood, sweat, and pain.  And not everyone will like that.  However, you don't get  anywhere in this life without sweating for what you want.  You have  to.....PROVE IT ALL NIGHT to get beyond the DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN.  Otherwise you will just be RACING IN THE STREETS OF FIRE  and be marooned  in the BADLANDS  of hell.  Bruce's message is ever so strong here and that  alone should make it a worthy purchase.  Plus Prove It All Night is one  great song.
0446525537|5.0|A Walk to Remember is one of the best books I have read in a long time.  It is such a touching love story.  I don't think I have ever laughed and cried so hard all during the same story.  I could feel Landon's love for  Jamie and his grief at the thought of losing her.  However, he transforms  that grief into unending love.  I would definately recommend this book to  everyone!
B00000255F|5.0|Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run is what catapulted him into the mainstream.  A triumph in itself, it also is responsible for his longevity.  Each Song is a masterpiece.  But if you know the Boss, you know  &quot;Thunder Road&quot;, you know &quot;Born to Run&quot; and you should  know &quot;Jungleland&quot; and &quot;Backstreets&quot;.  &quot;Jungleland&quot; itself is the most epic rock song this side of the  Atlantic, the strings the piano, the scratchy Springsteen voice mesh so  perfectly and hurl you into the desperate world of rock, roll and  ultimately chaos.  But the important thing is, you feel it.  And  &quot;Meeting Across the River&quot; you don't know what he's doing, you  don't know where you are, but you feel the gravity of the situation with  only a few short lines, and man, is it heavy.  You are eddie.  You just  know what needs to be done.  This song could have a novel written around  it, but it doesn't need it.  &quot;She's the One&quot; like only a few Boss  songs, i didn't like it at first, and it grew on me, and now i love it.  Every song on this album is worth hearing, and the album itself is a self  contained musical novel, the type you don't want to put down and, once  you're done, you want to read again.  And the E Street Band is there every  step of the way. Roy Bittan is easily the most integral of the boys, but  they all add a depth that is almost orchestral.  This album belongs in any  rock n roll lover's collection.  This album belongs in any music lover's  collection.
0062502182|5.0|Some times there comes a book along that changes your life. The Alchemist is a book like that. Through the narrative of a young man we listen to the wisdom of the author. Paolo Coelho himself has been a student of alchemy  for years. What he shares with us through the learning process of one of  the charcters in the book is stunning. He reveals a love for life, a  willingness for suffering and an ability to be alive every second of this  life. This book is a work of art, and it will outlive all of us!
B00002MZ2T|4.0|I have to say that this is a GOOD CD! The last one was excellent, too. On the last one, Darren sounded a lot like Micheal Jackson, on this one, he didn't. There were a lot of fast songs on the first CD, on Affirmation,  there were slow songs, a couple fast ones, and semi slow songs.  &quot;Affirmation&quot; was really cool, great lyrics. &quot;Chained to  you&quot; was really happening. You should by this CD. Nice songs, Darren  has a cool voice.
B0000024ZT|4.0|This debut release is a real winner.  It seems to have somewhat less of instrumental layering than on future releases but it still is loaded with quality songs.  The production is a little muddy in spots and The Angel and  Mary Queen Of Arkansas are not top quality Bruce songs.  But the other  seven are truly heaven.  So buy casue you won't cry.
B000002LND|5.0|I don't care what anyone says, Madonna is the best singer of all time! Yes, I do mean ALL TIME.  Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, Cher, and all the other divas may be good in their own right, but none of them  have the charisma and power that Madonna does.  This hits collection is a  must have for any music lover.  This chronicles her 1980's music  wonderfully.  I only wish that the song &quot;Who's that Girl?&quot; was  also included. I can't wait until Madonna's next greatest hits album is  released. She has come a long way since the 1980's.
B00001W9G0|4.0|Sublime.  Barbra is brilliant, even when acting with a beautiful blank slate like Redford.  Like any doomed-romance movie, this one will make you weep buckets before all is said and done.  Need a good cry?  Get this  today.
B000002513|5.0|The one problem with this record......there isn't enough of it.  Seven songs that display Bruce's great story-telling ability from the good old days of New Jersey.  Each song seems to be loaded with many special  instrumental touches with New York City Serendade being so badly  overlooked. So my advice to all of you is to Shuffle on down to E Street  and pick this one up.
B00003XB8K|5.0|This is one of those cd's that I can't put away. When I heard Enigma had a new cd, my heart skiped a beat and immediatly purchased it. Wow! Another incredible mix of sounds, rythems and melodies that leave me breathless, At  the same time, delivering an uplifting positive message. Please do yourself  a good deed buy getting it and enjoying the benifits from it.
0808520695|4.0|I picked up this book because I hadn't read Vonnegut since high school. The best way I can think of to describe reading this is to compare it to train-hopping, destination unknown. It's a bit quirky, but definitely most  entertaining and illustrates man's inability to control technology. I found  the beginning slightly slow, but the story picks up momentum. By the end,  you're flipping the pages faster and faster trying to figure out where  you're going to land.
6303921248|5.0|Dear me! Captivating experience! Beautiful book, beautiful landscape, beautiful English, beautiful characterization... The best performance both by Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth I've ever seen. A must see for every  romantic alive on the planet.
068484267X|5.0|I was fortunate to run into Frank McCourt (literally!) as he was walking out of a store in downtown Santa Cruz. I didn't have the courage to tell him how much I liked Angela's Ashes, so I will praise his wonderful book  here.<br />McCourt's portrayal of an Irish Catholic boyhood in the slums of  Limerick is lovely without being precious, and heartrending without  descending into  melodrama.  Scenes such as Angela singing a tune with her  old sweetheart, or the McCourt's Christmas dinner (which is a bit like the  Cratchits, only more Dickensian) are presented in a style which seems both  rough and elegant, like the warp and weft of a thick fabric. The misery of   the McCourt's poverty, the betrayal of Frank's alcoholic father, and the  resigned nature of Frank's mother are rendered with poignance and simple  grace, without descending into cliche.<br />I hope that this book continues to  sell well over the next few years.  Thank you, Mr. McCourt, and I'm sorry I  couldn't tell you all this when I bumped into you in person!
B00000J2KV|5.0|First, I would like to correct some mistakes read on these reviews : Lolita was shot before Strangelove, not after ! It is as masterful as Kubrick other movies. Sue Lyon is perfect in the role, and Nabokov has not  been put apart by Kubrick. He wrote the screenplay, Kubrick filmed it (the  way he wanted, it's his film), and it is to be said that Nabokov liked the  film (unlike Stephen King who hated Shining). The character of Peter  Sellers will be an unforgettable memory for all viewers, and I believe he's  even funnier and brillant that in Strangelove. Besides, unlike 2001 (with  compression problems, impossible to watch!), Lolita is the best master and  image quality of the Kubrick DVD Collection. I would give a big A for the  image which is simply perfect. This DVD could easily be selected as a  Criterion edition. Buy it, you won't regret it. it's full of wit,  subversive, humor, slapstick (in the hotel room), disguise, perversity,  immorality and brillant acting (Shelley Winter is so perfect that we all  want to kill her !). A MUST !
0679736646|5.0|I noticed a previous review at this site, bemoaning the &quot;anti-climactic&quot; final page of this novel.  the reviewer then proceeded to sing the praises of Isaac Asimov.  Perhaps he should have  proceeded directly to an Asimov page and stayed where he seemed happiest.   Enough on that.    What the final page of this book does effectively do is  deny the reader any sense of finality.  there is no comfort in finishing  this tale, as the tale has no definite end.  The reader - especially one  new to the work of PKD - should prepare for one of the most original and  testing meditations on tangibility.  The book's conclusion is not, I feel,  the intended climax.  The book is more than a linear narrative.  Linearity  in fact is deliberately confused.  The intention of writers such as PKD -  and this work is perhaps his best example of this intention - was to use  science fiction as a philosophical instrument, to challenge what we think  we know - actually, what we are led to believe - about ourselves and our  place in the universe.  For the discerning sci-fi reader who wishes to  engage some weighty philosphy, Ubik is essential.     By the way, did  anyone think that The Matrix was something revolutionary?
0312853238|5.0|Do you like action? Well I do, and when I read this book I was wondering what would happen from page to page. There were things you wouldn't expect. I felt almost like I was Ender. I can't wait to read Ender's Shadow..
B000002H97|5.0|My brother has this cd and as soon as I litened to it I thought it was one of the best cd's my brother had I'm into heavymetal my self well you have to buy this cd it will be worth your money Peace OUt
6302517036|4.0|Fright Night is definately a good horror/comedy film with great special effects. Chris Sarandon (Childs Play) is a suave vampire who is persued by his neighbour who suspects he is a creature of the night. Roddy McDowell as  Peter Vincent, Vampire killer is extremly entertaining and makes the film  what it is.
B00000IQV7|5.0|This movie is a must see it is funny!  It has some sad parts. It gives you a whole new outlook on how humour helps you feel good. This is based on a true story. Please watch the end cridits to tell you what is happing now  with the real Patch Adams. If you get a chance don't miss the bounus  materials on the dvd version.
B000005ZFN|5.0|This disc, Jethro Tull's most difficult and progressive work, is a Top 40 listener's nightmare. The density of it is comparable to Captain Beefheart's Trout Mask Replica or Frank Zappa's Uncle Meat. Many Tull fans  prefer to overlook this album that follows Thick As A Brick, and dash  directly to Warchild, a great album for sure, but one that is not nearly as  challenging as A Passion Play. The fact that Passion topped the US charts  shows how much clout Tull had in the early 70's, but music critics were  less than impressed and Tull has remained a critical dartboard ever since.  The album starts out with the progressive rock cliche of heartbeats then  becomes something completely original. The opening section is along the  basic framework of &quot;Tiger Toon&quot; from Nightcap, but this version  buzzes with electricty. The sound is bizarre (it resembles what  extra-terrestrial folk music must sound like) but is quite catchy! Then  things quiet down to what is Tull's most eerie music; Ian sings with a  pleading tone, sounding more like a mournful sage than a wildman-minstrel.  John Evan's contribution to this album is essential. His piano playing has  never sounded lovelier, and his use of the synthesizer is much more  restrained and tasteful than later Tull keyboard players (Peter Vettesse  hops to mind). After this interlude, things pick up as Ian dispenses lyrics  that seem to be full of biblical allusions, but I haven't any real idea  what's he getting at. Still, the lyrics are ripe with insightful tidbits  and interesting poetry, and Ian's vocals are excellent! After a long,  interesting instrumental passage, Tull heads into &quot;Critique  Oblique&quot;, with threatening vocals from Ian, and meandering riffs that  exit in a blur of sound. Then follows &quot;Forest Dance&quot;, which could  easily be a soundtrack for a pagan ritual, then &quot;The Story Of The Hare  Who Lost His Spectacles&quot;, which sounds like Monty Python on drugs. I  think it's funny, but I know lots of Tull fans think it's pointless. Next,  a reprise of &quot;Forest Dance&quot; then to &quot;The Foot Of Our  Stairs&quot;, which is just beautiful! Pure as the truth, tight at both  ends! Again, IA's vocals are something, then the band injects an  instrumental section that features Ian's best sax playing on record, and  awesome guitar from Martin Barre! The gloomy &quot;Overseer Overture&quot;  is very different from most of their work; the synthesizer is extremely  effective as it blips on the barren landscape, while drummer Barrie Barlow  defines what a drummer should be: adding interesting percussion parts that  aren't pointless but essential. More excellent sax from Mr. Anderson that  sounds almost Eastern. &quot;Flight From Lucifer&quot; starts out with  Gothic organ, becomes almost bouncy (by Tull standards), then changes into  what sounds like a manic electric Scots jig. Then a breather with lovely  &quot;10.08 To Paddington&quot; which takes off its mask to reveal itself  as &quot;Magus Perde&quot;, passion play writer. The band rocks out with  one of their greatest performances, the odd jig resumes, and Ian's vocals  are yet again wonderful. The piano returns briefly as the album ends as if  descending into a bottomless pit. I hope my ineffectual description of this  great work doesn't put fellow Tull fans off, but I'm only trying to convey  what a unique disc this is. Certainly one of the greatest in rock history.

0800137884|5.0|This is one hell of a good horror film. Very dark and sinister and the effects are brilliant. Gary Oldman is brilliant as the count and Anthony Hopkins (good as ever) plays Van Helsing. I'm not a fan of the old horror  films, but this is an excellent remake!

B00003CWHS|5.0|This is absolutely hilarious. It's not a hum drum horror film, it's a very comical horror. This is the 3rd EVIL DEAD film and it's very different and enjoyable. Watch out for a copy of FANGORIA horror magazine and a zombie  character played by Bill Mosely (texas chainsaw massacre 2)
B00000295Y|5.0|I listened to this Cd for countless months with my friends back in 1993. I was completely hooked the grooves were cool as was the rappin' These guys deserve more acknowledgement. Their isn't a bad tune here at all. Im not a  rap fan but if u had to get just 2 rap cd's make it this and Ice Cube's The  Predator. Favs include I wanna Get High,Insane in the Brain,Lick A Shot,as  well as the classic Hits From The Bong.

0792839234|4.0|One brilliant, sci-fi, fantasy horror film. The Tall Man is a brilliant character, he's so cold and empty, Angus Scrimm plays the role brilliantly. This is the first of what has now become a cult series. The 3 sequels are  also brilliant.
B00000JCOV|4.0|This album is about as close to the edge as you can get, every song sounds like it is going to be their last. From the menacing intro, followed by the pounding riffs and rhytmns of (sic) you just know that this album is going  to get better and better. In fact, it's the album that just keeps on  giving, just when you think &quot;it can't get any heavier can it?&quot; ,  it just does. The entire album sounds like a ball of energy, with singer  Corey about to explode any minute, so why not stick it in your death-deck  and lite the touch paper. I DO NOT reccommend that you buy this album, I  COMMAND YOU to purchase it immediately, do not waste any more time, the  (sic) world of Slipknot awaits
630245333X|4.0|Directed by Chuck Russell (Nightmare on elm st 3) this remake of a B-movie is definately worth a look. I saw the trailer to it and instantly wanted it in my horror collection. The effects are great, plenty of gore and an  ending which opens doors to a sequel...
B000002UWL|5.0|This album is the best pet shop boys cd, period.  Before this album, my favorite was &quot;Introspective&quot;, but I must say the writing and music on this cd surpass most of their previous and later material.  A must  have!
6302649943|5.0|A brilliant horror film that scared me when I first saw it. Pennywise (Tim Curry) is one mean guy as a ghostly clown. I recommend this to horror fans, and it should be in your horror collection if it isn't now.
B00000016O|5.0|DCC deserves tremendous credit. Don Henley had expressed several years ago his dissatisfaction with the sound of the Eagles' catalog. Wisely, the two albums DCC chose to remaster is the Greatest Hits (now the biggest selling  album) and this one!<br />What hits your ears immediately is the bass. The  songs have a bottom to them that was lost when issued in the mid 80's.  There is also tremendous clarity in the high end as well. The superior  sound makes this CD worth the extra cost!<br />The CD duplicates the orginal  album, complete with gatefold sleeve, fold out poster, and inner jacket.  <br />Oh, and let me correct an error in describing an uncollected b-side that  would make a contender for an expanded Eagles singles anthology when I  reviewed the Eagles Greatest Hits gold disc. I had said that Get You In The  Mood (the b-side of Take It Easy) was written by Henley-Frey. In fact, the  song was only written by Frey. See, I told you my info on the song was  sketchy!
6304509154|5.0|This is a wonderful piece of horror film directed by Tobe Hooper (Texas chainsaw massacre, Salems Lot) and produced by Steven Spielberg (E.T, Jurrasic Park) A beautiful range of special effects and Tangina Barrons  (The little lady with the little girl voice) is a wonderful asset to the  film. Followed by 2 sequels, this is the best but if your epileptic, beware  one scene near the end where there is a load of flashing light.
6300263673|5.0|hello i think this movie is the bomb dig because i am a huge sheruis fan---manwoman forever!   rock on lol byebye sheruis
6304500483|2.0|They could not leave it could they, one good turn deserves another so they thought, well they were wrong.<br />This is pretty much the same only worse. The picture quality is bad, it's like a dull light green. I only liked 2  things, hence the 2 stars. Iggy Pop. The motorbikes.
6305633177|1.0|I have read the reviews of this DVD submitted by other fans of Metallica and believe an honest account may save some money for someone. I too am a fan, not only of the band but also the DVD format. This recording may well  be 'raw' and 'gutsy' but I found it disappointing. It does no justice to  the band or the format. The picture quality is very poor throughout and the  sound is terrible.   Sorry but it's only fair that people are aware of what  to expect. Save your money for a more recent Metallica production. I wish I  did!
0790731479|5.0|One of my all time favourite movies, even as a kid I loved it, it's a classic horror/comedy that is very entertaining. I heard rumours of  a sequel. The cartoon was a major dissapointment but then I suppose it's  aimed at kids. I used to have a few of the figures as well, hang on, I  still have.
B000001Y5J|5.0|Pure anger.... the only way to describe this cd.  but that is what makes it so great. if his record company hadnt been hastling him, it would have never come out.  so with his anger he created something good.  goes to show  that there is a plus to every minus. its one of my favorite NIN cds ever.
6304509170|2.0|The only thing I liked about SCANNERS is the scene where a mans head blows up. It is without a doubt one of the most realistic head blowing up scenes ever. I laughed.<br />This is still, a very slow, dull movie and the only  cronenberg film I like is THE FLY
0393307050|5.0|I first read Master and Commander shortly after it was published in the early seventies.  I found it to be extremely interesting and have since read all twenty volumes of the Aubrey/Maturin chronicle.  These books are  not really novels, but studies of the lives and progress of two men during  the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries.  While the main  emphasis is on the British Royal Navy during the period of the Napoleonic  Wars, the continuing story also gives an in-depth look at the society and  culture of the period.  The series is not for everyone, but rather for  those of us who love a rousing yarn of the sea.  I thought I was pretty  well up on sea-faring terms but I found that O'Brian came up with a number  I had never heard of.  So, if you don't like detailed ship terminology, the  series is probably not for you.
6305609691|4.0|I read heart of darkness before i actually saw this movie, at first, i hated the book.  The only reason I read it was because I had to write a 1500 word essay about &quot;the horror, the horror&quot;. you know what?  now that i think of it I really enjoyed the book, its contents are as deep  you want them to be.<br />the sentence 'the horror the horror' gives place to  many interpretations that can go on for as long as anyone reads the story.  Not only can Kurtz' words have different meanings but Kurtz himself can be  thought of as either the true center of the story, or as just a secondary  character, an imaginary fabrication of Marlow's mind.   The indistinctness  and complexity of Conrad's writing, coupled with his ability to mask and  distract the reader make finding out and understanding the true meaning of  his sentences a rather deceitful process.  The true intended meanings are  lying way down beneath the surface. <br />  Kurtz had nothing to bring him  back to civilization, life in the jungle managed to drift him further away  into savagery to a point of no return.  His death served him as the  determinant factor with which he realizes what he had turned into after all  the years of tormenting, killing and degrading the natives to the point  where human life was worthless.  Not only for him, but for all the people  he was able to convince and  confuse to the extent of being worshiped, it  was really impossible to think about them going back to civilization.   Although he could never return to civilization, he, at least, had the  chance to take conscience of what he had done throughout his life.<br />back  to apocalipsis now.... this film portrays the book in a way in which very  few have done before, never a film was capable of showing emotions in the  way A.N does. if you like the book, watch the movie, if you liked the  movie, read the book.
6303149200|4.0|This is a rather unusual film, set in the eerie, yet beautiful midsts of a remote Scottish island. The storyline is captivating and the ending is somewhat shocking although not unexpected. I feel that to some people this  may give rise to ignorant prejudices against 'alternative' religions,  especially Wiccans and other pagan groupings, but however horrific and  seemingly unjust the ending is, the story is based on the fact that in  ancient times many cultures did employ a human sacrifice to appease the  gods and they believed that it worked. The basic question that the film is  asking is; &quot;Is morality a Judeo-Christian invention, or does it exist  above and beyond religion?&quot;. Overall a well made film that makes you  think. And the folky, melancholic music is wonderful.
0393317552|4.0|This book is a must if you've ever wondered why societies have interacted the way they have, with the outcomes we read of in history.  This from-the-ground-up discussion of cultural history should be required  reading for anyone considering the field, as well as anyone wishing  enlightenment about how it all came to be the way it is.  Not a treatise on  racism, but an argument for why many of the early beliefs in racial  inequalities based on continent of origin are flat wrong.  I'll read it  again to make sure I've got it all straight in my own mind.
0553573403|5.0|This book's effectiveness comes from the depth of its characters and the pitiless handling of their fates. In an interview Martin stated he was inspired by Tad William's &quot;Memory, Sorrow and Thorn&quot; trilogy, a  favourite of mine which succeeds for similar reasons and led me to begin  reading Martin's series. Martin has stated there will be six volumes in his  series, and for the first time since Williams I believe each will prove  worth the wait.
6305205620|5.0|As far as DVDs go, this one leads the pack with menus, angles, bonus footage, design, and extras.  The producers and directors of this 2 disc set have done a first rate job.  This is a must for any Metallica fan and  music video collection.
B000001EXB|5.0|Adult music from the grand master of the grand piano. Slower than usual, but not lacking quality. Captain Fantastic in his 50s.
6302973724|5.0|Depeche Mode are -hands down- one of the best live bands of the past 20 years. Forget all of the preconceived &quot;synth-pop&quot; notions, and watch this video to see what rock and roll could have been. DM's most  recent tour may have been outstanding and filled with nostalgia, but  nothing can ever really top Devotional.
B000001EG6|5.0|Attention Athens (see below review). Your ideas are silly, your writing simplistic, and your taste is digressing. This EJ cd is sometimes powerful, sometimes dark, sometimes beautiful... but always interesting. Let me make  this clear - your review is not.
0446604844|5.0|Set against an advanced technological backdrop the story quickly unfolds to let the reader know that the real control belongs to those with the most money. So much money they can control people in positions of power like  puppets on a string.  Greed is the focal point of total control.  There are  those who will do anything because of it, which ulitmately leads to their  demise.  Contrasting these, are the &quot;innocent&quot; ones caught in a  web of intrigue trying to put the many pieces of the puzzle together(this  is a recurring theme found in The Winner, while not as dark a plot as Total  Control, it is a suspenseful novel not to be missed)  As one person said in  Total Control (Sawyer, I think) &quot;Money is the root of all evil, or  rather the lack of it.&quot;  This story leads us into the innermost  recesses of the characters minds where we can see the motivation behind  their actions, actions which lead to a downward spiral or soaring success.   At times Total Control is touching and tragic, but always chilling and  gripping.  Read Total Control, it is a fast paced cleverly written story,  one you won't soon forget.
B000001EGA|5.0|Kids. Quit reviewing things you don't understand - like good music (see a couple of the reviews below). Instead buy more Ricky Martin, Spice Girls or Garth Brooks. Your ears aren't used to impressive musical craftsmanship and  could become damaged. Seriously - this is a great cd and features one of my  favorite songs &quot;Someone Saved My Live Tonight&quot; This cd was number  one upon the day it was released and for good reason.
0449227545|1.0|I should have read these reviews before buying the book. Ken Follett's writing has been generally very good but this book's author needs to go back to Basic Writing I in highschool! Use the $$ I wasted on this book Ken  and take a good writing course.
B00001OH7U|5.0|I've always loved the open and free sense of creativity and expression in this album. In a  literal sense it's an odd album ( like many of Bowies albums ) but he manages to pull it of in  a way that is tremendous and  magnificent.<br />Beautiful work from an extremely creative and dynamic  person.
B000002JSR|4.0|Funny how this record splits even LedZep-fans into groups. Yes, it is a compilation. And yes, as a teenager who loves the fourth album you won't feel anything while listening to it. But once your musical interests  expand, even into funk and dance music, and you just can't listen to  'Stairway...' anymore, a song like 'We're gonna groove' will suddenly kick.  As that title implies, this is LedZeps groove-album. After all, Bonham was  their drummer, he wouldn't have wanted a melancholic and silent record. Buy  it!
0451196716|5.0|Slowing down is one thing that this novella does not do.  The pace of the action, and the development of the characters, and the true compassion you  start to feel for the poor &quot;walkers&quot; all draw further and further  into the web that Stephen King weaves.<br />The Long Walk was orginally  published in paperback as part of a compilation known as &quot;The Bachman  Books.&quot;  The Bachman books contained three other short stories, one of  which is no longer published anywhere due to recent controversy over  shootings in high schools.<br />The long walk is about a competition in which  100 people walk at a pace of 4 miles per hour, until there is one man  standing.  If a walker slwoed past 4 miles per hour, he received a warning.   Three strikes, and you were shot on the spot. <br />The ending of the book is  so powerful, I still begin to think about it whenever I watch a marathon on  TV, or watch people on the treadmill at the gym.<br />This book is a work of  absolute wonder, and is more than worthy of all the praise that I could  possibly give to it.
0060925000|5.0|Ostensibly a novel about a mother's search to find a suitable husband for her youngest daughter in 1950's India, in reality this is a book as huge and complex as India itself. The historical facts about life after  Partition are fascinating, and so much more interesting when read as part  of a novel than they ever would be as a textbook. The characters, with all  their flaws, are generally sympathetic, and the book is vividly written.  This book has it all - drama, humour, pathos, history, religion and an  insight into a world that most in the West would never experience. A highly  recommended book for those times that you want to escape deep into another  world but still want to keep your mind active.
0767819594|5.0|If you're looking for a movie with drama, humor, romance, excitement, good acting, a nice plot, a lovely &quot;Bitchy&quot; Sarah Michelle Gellar and a great soundtrack, this is the one for you :CRUEL INTENTIONS.<br />Cruel  Intentions is a great movie with some great (new) actors like &quot;Sarah  Michelle Gellar(Kathryn,with a totally other role as in I KNOW WHAT YOU  DID.., SIMPLY IRRESSISTABLE or BUFFY THE..), Ryan Phillippe (Sebastian),  Selma Blair (Cecile) and Reese Witherspoon (Annette).<br />You must see it  yourself, so add it to your video/dvd collection.
0060977493|5.0|This is a book which I have now read many times, each time finding something new to enjoy and ponder. Roy is that most rare of writers, a woman who can turn prose into pure poetry. I found myself reading over the  same paragraph three or four times, savouring the text in the same way that  you try to make your favourite dessert last longer by eating it slowly. I  finished the book and wanted to read it over again - it haunted my mind for  weeks. A book to buy and treasure.
B00000IAU3|5.0|From the moment I put my headphones on to listen to this cd, I realized it was perfect. Imaginative and deeply thoughtful lyrics to be accompanied by complex and rythmic instrumental background allow one to feel her music. I  can never get enough of Dido's moving pieces. I hope she continues to  release new music. It's excellent- my fav. cd.
6301174240|5.0|This video was really great.  Of course it has wonderful dance moves since it is featuring Michael Jackson.  I thought it was a really cool sci-fi movie with a twist!
B000021Y77|5.0|Run Lola Run isn't well served on a small TV screen and its energy is diminished when experienced at home, but this is a truly excellent DVD edition.<br />A small criticism is in the chapter-selection screens.  Though  the division of the film is quite logical, the layout of the pages is quite  bad.  I also couldn't figure out how to turn off the commentary track after  turning it on, forcing me to take out the disc and restart the machine to  restore the original audio.<br />But now to the legions of good points.  The  commentaries by Tom Tykwer and Franka Potente are righteously involving,  both director and star eloquent and affectionate about the film.  (It's  especially amusing to note that they seem reluctant to acknowledge that  they are dating.)  The  technical details Tykwer offers are great for a  deeper understand of the execution, and their anecdotes are fun, well  phrased, and exciting.  Thumbs up to the commentary tracks.  There are also  biographies on each, subtitle options, and the picture quality is good  though, again, if you missed this in the theatres, you didn't quite get the  full impact of this movie.<br />Run Lola Run was an enjoyable experience for  me at the theatre and, much to my surprise, has grown on me since.   Potente's lead performance is Oscar-worthy, emotional at just the right  moments and comic and spunky at others.  Moritz Bleibtreu is wonderful as  the bumbling Manny, and the script is a great innovation.  The music-video  stylings sometimes detract from the story, but as a whole, it's like a  whole new way of seeing the world and, technical innovations aside, the  movie is fun, comedically superb, and involving on a human level, a rarity  for such a technically oriented film.
6305696071|5.0|I thought that &quot;Pretty Woman&quot; was a fantastic movie about love.    When two worlds come together unexpectidly and fall in love, when one of them has just fallin out of love.  Neither of the two never really experienced true love.  Edward Louis's dull, lonley world changes when  Vivian Ward, a hooker, gives him directions to his hotel.  One thing leeds  to another, and he pays her $3000 to spend the week with him in his  penthouse suite in Beverley Hills.    To Vivian, this is a dream world  come true.  But it ends up being like home, as they fall in love.  The  both of them change worlds for each other, for the best.  Edward is no  longer a lonley, hard man anymore, and Vivian isn't a street walking hooker  anymore.  They help each other find love.  I recomend this romantic  comedey for anyone who likes to fall in love.  The two perform amazinly  together, its almost like a fairy tale.
6303566448|5.0|This movie was referred in American Beauty as a representation of forbidden pleasures, dark sexuality and thumbing one's nose at conformity. While I'm willing to bet half of the audience of that movie wouldn't know what The Re-Animator is, it remains a cult classic that deserves a proper reissue and re-emergence into public consciousness.<br />Director Stuart Gordon's background was in theatre, which accounts for the unusually adept acting in this film -- Bruce Abbott as bright young med student Kane; oddball Jeffrey Combs (last seen in I Still Know What You Did Last Summer) as madcap genius Herbert West; Barbara Crampton as Megan, Kane's innocent girlfriend who gets dragged into the maelstrom of gore, nefarious plots and strange happenings that is this movie's arc.<br />Most horror directors today should bow their heads to Gordon's dramatic sense -- the story is urged forward with an inevitability, a sense of purpose that eludes nearly all of the entries in the plot-obsessed horror entries in the post-Scream boom. The Re-Animator, like so many other greats (the Night of the Living Dead series, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), realizes that horror is different from whodunit (Scream created that dreaded prototype so that most horror flicks nowadays are guess-the-killer types, bad marriages between mystery and slasher). One look and you know who the bad guy is in The Re-Animator...and you'll keep watching. Dr. Carl Hill, played with great relish by David Gale, is one of the most memorable horror villains of all time thanks to some very human motivations (ambition, greed, sexual frustration) and an overwhelming weirdness that suits the atmosphere of the film perfectly. And the visuals? \\"Outrageous\\" only begins to describe them -- one writer described the SFX approach here as being \\"splashing blood on every visible surface\\". But because the dramatic sequences work beautifully, the gory effects take a back seat, where they belong in a truly good film.<br />Some sequences may make your stomach turn (unless, of course, you've already sampled Dawn of the Dead or Maniac). But give it a shot and The Re-Animator will yield strange pleasures not found anywhere else -- not in the slew of Lovecraft adaptations that followed it; not in the wasteland of '90s horror; not even in Romero, Carpenter, Hooper or Craven. The Re-Animator is a true original, and worthy of classic status.
B00000637V|5.0|I thought Marilyn Manson could only get this dark, but after listening to BERLIN, Lou Reed was doing this long before Manson was born. TRANSFORMER may have been a landmark, but it was too polished and mainstream, so it was  only natural that the very versatile Reed go in the other direction. With  the help of Bob Ezrin, who produced Kiss, Pink Floyd, and Alice Cooper, Lou  Reed has created in BERLIN one of the darkest albums ever committed to  tape. Don't listen to this album alone at night!
B00000IMCW|3.0|Elite's reissue of Dawn of the Dead on VHS a couple of years ago is, to me, the definitive version of this movie -- tight, horrific, and organic, with a macabre rhythm all its own.  On this DVD edition, the film lost  nearly 10 minutes, resulting in a more jarring sense of editing and overall  a less effective cut than the 138-minute one.<br />This is one DVD that could  have used more bonus material, for example from the George A. Romero  documentary, behind-the-scenes footage (if such footage exists), outtakes,  and so on.  Comments have already been made about the Monroeville Mall  commercial and they are more or less correct -- amusing, but too short.   The &quot;alternate scenes from Zombi&quot; are even worse -- there are  only two scenes, and that's pretty scant.  Firstly they aren't as  indicative of Dario Argento's hand in Zombi as they should be:  Argento  reputedly used more of the Goblin score, and neither of these scenes is  heavily scored; Argento veers towards imagery, but these scenes are  dramatic, shot in loose basic coverage; Argento crafted the Zombi cut for  European audiences, and neither of the extra scenes shows any difference in  the European sensibility.  The biggest gripe is that they simply didn't  include enough of the different scenes.<br />There are no cast bios, no  articles, no interviews, and there's only one theatrical trailer which,  though well done, pales in comparison to the endlessly fascinating European  trailers (some German, some English) included in the earlier VHS reissue  from Elite.<br />I'm disappointed in the release and hope to see a more  complete one of the complete 138-minute cut in the future on DVD.
B0000047G6|5.0|This CD is really some smokin' playing by Jimmy.  It's highly recommended.  The big band backup of Oliver Nelson, with whom Jimmy collaborated on for a good number of recordings really adds to the BASHIN'.  It's real powerful  stuff all the way through.
B000003TA4|5.0|This album has to be up there with the all-time best albums ever. And the reason for that was Kurt Cobain-he was the musical genius. This album's so good it's addicting-literally. If you're hesitant about getting it-DONT BE.  You'll love it.
6304467540|5.0|I am a huge film aficionado and only just recently did I get the opportunity to watch the three Godfather films. I must say that all three floored me. Perhaps I was able to love the third film simply because I had  not heard much from other people about any of the films, so going into it I  was not affected by other opinions. I feel blessed that I was able to watch  this excellent trilogy much like one goes in reading a great novel. The  Godfather Part III may not be an equal to the first two, but it undeniably  completes the story of Michael Corleone, and it does so splendidly. This  saga is a must for anyone who loves movies.
B0000035E7|5.0|This was the 1st Nirvana almbum and I wouldnt exactly compare it with 'Nevermind' but it's not supposed to be. It's just fun grunge..exactly what Nirvana was and still is all about.
B0000042H4|4.0|Having listened to both the Solti &quot;Ring&quot; and Bohm's, all I can say is that they are both great pieces of performance, although each is of a different genre. Bohm I find more involving, Solti more dramatic. There  are no perfect performances. Much of the criticism that seems to aimed at  Solti is aimed at Solti the man, rather than the conductor.
0964385619|5.0|Mr Kiyosaki goes a long way to explaining why we have more money while sailing around the world on our yacht (not working) than we did with combined salaries of over $150K/year as employees!<br />We started out 6 years  ago with enough money to live for 2 years and now have enough that we may  never work again.  All by doing what &quot;seemed right at the  time&quot;.<br />Getting here was largely luck and hard work, keeping  &quot;the good times rolling&quot; will take some knowledge about money as  he points out.<br />The book is not an ending, but a beginning.<br />I am logged  on right now specifically to buy a copy of this book for my son back home  in Phoenix AZ.<br />In reading the other reviews I notice several who totally  miss the point of the book.  This book is NOT about investment  &quot;tips&quot; or even about investing, rather it is about ways to train  YOURSELF to invest successfully!  This is done very well.
6305428050|5.0|I loved the movie as much as when I first saw it when it originaly was released however,I wish it had the movie trailer.  It played on my Pioneer but when I tried it on my KLH the captions turned on at the start of the  movie and movie menu wouldn't turn it off.  I was able to turn them off via  the remote but, the captions turned back on at the start of each chapter.
052594527X|5.0|This is a wonderful book - a great story.  I would  recommend looking at some of Vermeer's paintings before or while reading it to get a fuller sense of what Chevalier describes.<br />This is one of those books that stays  with you once you've finished it.
B000001IPL|5.0|Simply put, Smash is pure genius. The Offspring have put out great CDs, but (barring &quot;The Offspring&quot;, which i haven't heard yet) it is one of the best, if not THE best Offspring CDs around. I listened to  Americana first and worked my way back, and while i still think some of  Americana is OK, i like all the songs on this CD. Truly one of the best out  there. BUY THIS ALBUM YOU WILL NOT BE SORRY! Definately punk at its  best.<br />PS: If you have the dough buy &quot;ixnay on the hombre&quot; and  &quot;ignition&quot; also, they are really good too. Buy americana last, it  is the weakest of all the offspring albums. PPS: &quot;helpful&quot;  doesn't mean &quot;i agree&quot; so if you don't agree fine but don't take  my points away =)
0684874350|5.0|It is such a pleasure to read this book, I couldn't put it down, and yet didn't want it to end... Thanks to Frank for capturing in such child like verse the naive way of the young. It makes adult values seem so mundane.  Oh, to be a child again. I am now reading Tis, and find a slightly more  mature narrative - again appropriate to the character. One question Frank,  how autobriographical is it? Can such hardship really exist in our century?  If so, I congratulate you on finding your way out, and helping your family  too. Bravo, for capturing my (and many others) attention.
B000002BPS|5.0|Ixnay on the Hombre is the second offpsring CD i listened to (after americana) and i must say it beat americana by quite a margin. Unlike Americana, almost every song on this CD is great, and the beat almost never  slows down, unlike Americana, with its less-punk more-pop songs (AHEM  pretty fly AHEM). Ixnay is when the Offspring really started to change in  my opinion. There is more variety in this album in terms of flavor than  there was in the past couple of albums. This is still punky, but not as  &quot;punk&quot; as smash and ignition. But, despite that, this CD got me  hooked on the Offspring, and i am sure it will do the same for you. I had  to record this on my MD cuz i just can't live without &quot;The Meaning of  life&quot; for more than a couple of hours (okay so i exaggerate).  Addictive stuff, but you won't mind because you'll enjoy every bit of it.  Well worth the fifteen bucks.
B000002KIT|5.0|This is the best live CD of the 70's; not Frampton Comes Alive. Thin Lizzy sounds better live than they do in the studio. This album covers all their best tunes from the 70's. The sound quality makes you feel like your right  there in the third row. Phil Lynott plays a wicked bass and sings great on  every song. Brian Robertson's guitar playing is awesome. Brian Downey lays  down a solid beat on drums. Huey Lewis even makes an appearance on Baby  Drives Me Crazy playing the harmonica.
B00000INEX|5.0|My wife and I are parents of 6 1/2 month old twins. We have found Baby Bach and Baby Mozart to be wonderful in helping calm the kids down, and capturing their attention. They delight in the images, often giggling with  joy. We highly recommend them to all our friends and aquaintances who have  just had children!
B000002KFJ|5.0|It's so sad when you hear people disliking Sabbath and saying: - I hatethem, the'reall satanic. Seems to me that they still have to carry a some sort of burden as the premier dark group, although the only album they  had any occultic elements was their debut album. Propably pritty much for  the same reason the Sab-albums aren't respected as high as they  would  deserve ( I'm talkin about the six first ones). A explended example of the  greatness of the group is this album. Sabotage is one of the first  experimental metal albums, and propably their most ambitious. With songs  like Megalomania, Supertzar and The Writ, it was the main inspirer for The  Queens &quot; A Night In The Opera&quot;, which was released later same  year (1975). Still, Sabbath isn't all experimental, offering the high  Sabbath-quality songs like Hole In The Sky, The Thrill Of It All and the  merciless Symptom Of The Universe. If you want to heart the really  innovative side of Sabbath, this is the album. Definetly.
B00000DLV1|5.0|This is a great CD.  It is up to the quality of the other Portishead CDs.  Crowd noise is minimal. Even with an orchestra the songs are not dramatically different from the studio versions except that these live  versions are a little more mellow.<br />This CD a great introduction to  Portishead (I recommend getting this disc first) and if you are already a  fan you will enjoy these alternate recordings of old favorites.
B000003EUL|5.0|There are other great recordings of this concerto (e.g., Gilels with Jochum conducting), but this is one of the best concerto recordings Richter made. The sound (the recording dates from 1960) is excellent. The  Appassionata is nothing if not impassioned, but I would call attention to  the wonderful slow movement, a fine example of Richter's power to draw the  listener into a piece of music with rapt concentration and superb  fingerwork and voicing. After the hushed revery of the Andante, though,  hold on to your hat as Richter gallops to the finish!
B00000J6AG|5.0|Moby is a genius. In 1999, he did something no one else had ever done: mix some old R&amp;B (and I do mean old, we're talking about the 30's and 40's) with some modern day breakbeats. And the result is an organic synthetic  mesh of wonder. There are moments when I listen to this CD that I could  almost shed some tears (track #4 &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So  Bad&quot;), and others that want to send my body a-groovin'  (&quot;Bodyrock&quot;, for example). This CD is something new, original,  and it has a heart: something that a lot of music is missing these days.  One of the best albums ever made. Period. I'd offer you a money back  guarantee, but I don't think I can!
6305342776|5.0|I didn't see &quot;The Black Hole&quot; till 1995. I rented an almost warn-out Disney VHS copy from a local video store. It was a good film back when I saw it. Just last year I bought it on DVD, and the quality was much  better than the Disney VHS copy (and the DVD is in widescreen ... a plus  there). Now some people say this film stink, that it's just a sci-fi movie  rip-off. If you know the ending is really about, you'll say this is the  most screwed-up Disney film of all time and it's now one of my favorite  films of all time. But I can't tell you the details on this ending cause  people who haven't seen this film are looking at the page. If you have a  DVD Player, you should pick up this movie. It has a nice transfer, nice DD  5.1 sound, and some good extras. I recommend this film if your a big movie  buff or love Sci-Fi.
0783225970|4.0|In short, &quot;Scarface&quot; is a great film!  It is probably the single best gangstar movie ever made.  I wouldn't even think of looking at the original version with Paul Muni.  Who in the world can play Tony Montana  better than Al Pacino?  It's a question without an answer.  I would give  this 5 stars had Universal Studios put more effort into the picture quality  of this DVD.  The picture quality stinks!  The sound is good for Dolby  Surround, and I liked the extras.  However, either the tranfer was so poor  in quality that the DVD represents the images as best as it could, or  Universal sacrificed picture quality for the extras.  Who knows?  It's  watchable, but if you sit close enough, noisy video artifacts will show.   It's not as bad on other DVDs.  Oh well, it doesn't take away from the  quality of the film.  I watched this DVD, annoyed at the picture quality,  and I still enjoyed the movie.  I would recommend the DVD for the extras,  the sound, and the small size of the DVD, not for picture quality.
B00003XB8K|3.0|I have been a die-hard Enigma fan for the past five or six years. I have loved every album they've released, but I was let down when I listened to this one, and I made the mistake of buying without listening. Ruth-Ann from  Olive is a welcome addition to their sound, but Michael Cretu's  dog-whistle, Euro-pop voice is a terrible distraction. I've never heard  Enigma tunes this loud, or ANNOYING, for that matter. They've lost the  soothing, dream-like quality I've come to love and replaced it with  old-hash, nightclub music that is played and never payed attention to.  While there are pleasant tracks on this CD, it's not one where I can let it  play all the way through without it grating my nerves at some point. As for  a fellow reviewer on this page, I do agree with you that Cretu should keep  his mouth shut around the microphones and stick to producing. If you're not  one that's particularly prejudice and is ready for a change in Enigma,  purchase this CD. If not, consider this a fair warning for disappointment.
078062369X|5.0|Thank God that someone finally translated a Marvel Comic to the silver screen successfully. After The Punisher (where the hell was his chest emblem?)and Captain America (which I don't even have any words for), Blade  is a breath of fresh air. Yeah, okay, the acting wasn't oscar material and  the plot was a bit confusing at times (What happened to the Vampire God?),  but this movie was still awesome. Wesley Snipes was perfect as Blade and he  finally got a chance to really show off his martial arts skills. Definitely  worth the buy. And by the way, I see alot of people comparing this with  &quot;The Lost Boys&quot;. Wake up, people. That's like comparing  &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot; to &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. They are two  totally different movie styles. Take Blade for what it is.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|There were only three songs I liked on &quot;Tidal&quot;. All the rest sounded like cheap imitations of her idols. I really hate it when an artist can't develop their own style because they're so infatuated with what  people have already done. But &quot;When The Pawn&quot; is a breath of  fresh air from a very talented woman with a style that will be envied and  imitated for years to come. I like it when someone can write their own  songs and sing them like they mean it. This album is all that.
0449911357|5.0|I love Fannie Flagg's quiet sense of humor and the way she really brings her characters to life.  They are real people, not cardboard cut-outs.  It's wonderful to read a book that explores the themes of friendship and  love and doesn't depend on gratuitous violence to drive the plot.  Sad and  funny at the same time, this is a book that really touches the heart and  stays there.
1573226521|4.0|The beach makes one wonder if a place like author Alex Garland describes actually exists.It also makes a person qeustion how they would react in the circumstances Richard,the main character,was faced with.It certainly  defines the traveler versus tourist mentality.It is a book for someone  looking for a quick read to make them think alot,and possibly have some odd  dreams.(as I did)
0385421982|1.0|This was my first Grisham book and I hated it.  It began with a bang only to have Chapter Two issue nothing more than a whimper.  From there it was all downhill.  Grisham introduced far too many characters with nothing to  do but attempt to keep the suspense high--I needed a scorecard just to keep  track of who was who and there are a few I never figured out.  Finally, I  gave up trying..it wasn't worth the effort.  The characters were cliches  and too unbelievable for words.  When we finally do find out the contents  of the infamous Pelican Brief, it's a supreme letdown.  My first reaction  was--that's IT?   Grisham should also get his facts straight.  He has the  beauteous (and stupid) Darby changing her hair color from black to pale  blonde to red.  If Grisham would have consulted his wife he might have  known that it is impossible--you can't lighten the dark colors!  Grisham's  writing also sounds belaboured, he tries to hard--in one sentence a  character says he would have continued talking if another hadn't showed him  his palms.  Showed him his palms!   It took me three months to figure that  one out.  People say Grisham's books are good so everyone else runs out to  buy a copy.  This being the case, why should Grisham even try?
B000002L9J|5.0|As soon as the drums started on the title track, I knew this album was going to be special.  Everyone, not just Smiths fans, should own this album.  Lyrically and musically, it is perfect.  And I don't find the  lyrics depressing at all.  If people would actually listen to them just as  lyrics in a song, they're actually really funny.  Sad, but funny.  I'm  Irish, and I think it's a distinct Irish trait to have a dark sense of  humor.  I just wish I could articulate it like this, and have ten of the  best songs ever written to sing it over.  This album is a classic, like  SGT. PEPPER or DARK SIDE OF THE MOON or RUMOURS.  Undeniable music.
B000003BDY|5.0|This is the Stones 2nd US release and this displays the band in the early stages of their classic raw Blues/R&amp;B sound. This one is loaded with great tunes like Time Is On My side, Congratulations, Empty Heart, Grown Up Wrong, Chuck Berry's Around And Around, Under The Boardwalk and their  classic instrumental tribute to the Chess Studios in Chicago 2120 South  Michigan Avenue. The covers are excellent and Mick and Keith's original  compositions are also exploding with sound and new direction. This is a  must and I highly recommend it. Original release date of vinyl is 1964.
0517122707|5.0|This book is hilarious - a must read!  The first time I read it, I couldn't help laughing out loud.  If you just need something that's fun to read, this book is it!
B00000K19E|5.0|This is one of the first DVDs I saw and I must say that this film is exceptionally remarkable when viewed on this media.  Ok, so some people have pointed out anamolies in the story line.  Honestly, when you see this  film, you may wonder about or debate these small points, but I think that  is part of the whole idea.  Not only do you enjoy the wonderful effects,  the storyline is intellectually stimulating as well, notwithstanding the  possible gaps in logic.  A great DVD to rent or own.
B00000JJQK|5.0|This is an album that lives up to all of the accolades you've heard for the past 34 years and even surpasses them.  &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; remains as breathtaking today as it was when it was first released.  Few albums  from the past half century approach this one in terms of musical invention  or production.  The beauty of these tracks, both instrumentally and  vocally, is downright stunning.  This is an album that remains moving and  powerful after countless listenings over several years.  Brian Wilson had  already written, produced and recorded some of the best American popular  music of his generation before entering the studio to create &quot;Pet  Sounds,&quot; but with this album he monumentally surpassed not only his  peers but himself.  If Wilson had never written a note other than the 13  songs contained in &quot;Pet Sounds,&quot; his place in the Rock and Roll  Hall of Fame would still have been well-deserved.
0784011613|5.0|Robert Downey, Jr. should have indeed won an Oscar for his stunningly brilliant performance in Chaplin.  No other actor could have ever portrayed Chaplin as Downey did.  If you want to see Downey at his best, I highly  recommend this contemporary classic.  This gifted actor deserves scripts  like Chaplin and would be in the calibur of the greats if society would  give him a chance to fully recover from his illness.  This video is a must  see.
B000002AS3|5.0|I was a little slow to hear of Oasis. In fact I wasn't even sure of who they were after I heard the ever poopular Wonderwall being played everywhere. Then a friend played this album for me, and it all made sense.  Oasis is a band with great sound, witty lyrics and a whole lotta attitude.  Don't listen to all the unfortunate backlash the band has recieved; they  are awsome --and they know it. After hearing Definitely Maybe I wanted to  hear their more recent work and I have since collected all their albums and  am greatly anticipating the arrival of Standing on the Shoulders of Giants.  Give this one a listen.
B00000K19E|5.0|Of course &quot;The Matrix&quot; was the greatest movie of 1999 and the special effects were awesome!  If you are thinking of buying this movie, I highly recommend the DVD version.  The effects are much more effective and  will pull you right out of your chair.  Of course, combine this with a good  sound system as well, and this is about as close as you can get to seeing  it in the theater.  If you don't have a DVD player, I recommend you buy one  just for this movie!
0805062971|5.0|While the actual film might've been too much for the masses to take, this book is even more so.  I wish I had read the book before the movie, because it was interesting to see how things had changed from paper to celluloid.   The screenwriter of the film, Jim Uhls, did a fine job adapting the story,  but because much of the material was terribly contorversial, it had to be  toned down. This book is terrific is you love scathing satire and terrific  and past-paced storytelling.  Palahniuk's way of telling the story is  mesmerizing.  It intrigued me to see how he broke up how the narrator  thought and how we reacted to situations.  This only helps to set up the  great story line and the terrific climax. In short, nothing in this book is  a cop-out or meant to be offensive.  It is simply a satire of how we live  our daily lives.  This novel is terrific from start to finish, and much  better than the movie, if you can believe that.
B000001IPL|5.0|Smash is great, what else can I say.  Although I like Ixnay on the Hombre a little more, this is a great album.  If I could have two CD's with me on a desserted island, this CD and Ixnay on the Hombre would be it.  Your life  will not be complete unless you buy this album.
0767821629|5.0|Just as in the US, the movie wasn't much of a success around here. In fact, I discovered it by accident, checking out the newest DVDs in the local video store. I decided to rent this movie out... and nothing could  ever prepare me for what I got! It would be a waste of my time and yours to  try and talk about the philosophical concepts in this movie, and the  questions it raises. The only other movie I've watched that was able to do  that for me was Bladerunner, hence the title for this review. Watching it,  you'll find many other similarities to Scott Ripley's masterpiece.<br />In  case you're wondering, The Thirteenth Floor is not a rip-off of any movie  (The Matrix was mentioned the most, I believe). They simply have similar  elements - the computer-generated reality being the most obvious one. But,  being realistic for a moment, how could the computer theme be avoided in a  good sci-fi movie of today?<br />All in all, the minor flaws this movie had  shouldn't prevent it from being one of the best sci-fi movies of the  nineties. Buy or rent it, and see for yourself.
B00000DHRZ|4.0|I am a long time Offspring fan, and I pretty much loved what I heard from Americana.  While we are now all sick of Pretty Fly, there are many other great songs.  Especially &quot;The Kid's Aren't Alright&quot; .  When you  pop this in the computer, there are also some other cool features, and you  can watch four of their older videos, (The meaning of life, All I want, I  choose, and Gone Away which is my personal favorite Offspring song). If you  buy this CD you won't be disappointed, but, The Offspring's Smash and Ixnay  on the Hombre are better, but not by a hell of a lot.
B00000BKDW|1.0|This band should be called IRON BUTTPLUG. This album pretty much sums up their talent (none) and their ability to sound like they have a CD of William Tell Overture stuck up their behinds. &quot;Hey, look at me , I'm  Steve Harris 'DUMDADADUMDADADUMDADADUMDADADUMDUM&quot;.
B000002BPS|5.0|I am going to get a lot of flak about this, but I believe Ixnay on the Hombre is the Offspring's best CD.  I love Smash, but this is just a little better.  The songs are great, especially Gone Away.  Take it from me, one  of the biggest fans of the Offspring on Earth, you will not be disappointed  with this.
B00001YXH6|5.0|This video was my introduction to the Cirque Du Soleil, and what an introduction it was! I don't have enough adjectives to describe the experience of watching the performances on this tape - amazing and  inspirational are two that come to mind. Unlike many on these pages, I did  not find the editing or camera work too distracting. I did have a sense,  however, that I was seeing only a portion of the show, but this was due to  the limitations of television. It seems that a Cirque Du Soleil performance  demands to be witnnessed live. I am eagerly awaiting my chance to do so  with their new touring show, &quot;Drallion&quot;. If you think you might  grow tired of watching one spectacular display of acrobatics, performance  art and theater after another, then don't bother with&quot;Quidam&quot;.
0790734060|5.0|This is a great movie. If I had never seen it, I would never have developed an interest in the music or the life of Mozart. This movie is by non means a biography of W. A. Mozart, but it does focus around his life.  Amadeus is a very wonderful and very entertaining film. It is a must see  for all.
0375707972|3.0|I liked the book.  I would not say it is a page turner, where you can't wait to see what happens on the next page.  Throughout the book I felt that the weather was grey and dismal--which can be pretty depressing after a  while.  I also found the story to be somewhat predictable after a while.   This is not a book that you can't put down and then go back to.  The book  doesn't seem to have its own momentum.  Interesting but not riviting.
B0000025GW|5.0|This is one of Dylan's most mature albums, both lyrically and musically.  I am not sure why one customer reviewer wonder &quot;where are his clear critcial views?&quot; They are HERE, and with force. Social/Religous  commentary springs forth in prophetic tone on &quot;When You Gonna Wake  Up&quot; (which is critical of religious hypocricy, disregard for the  elderly, doctors-pushing drugs, and on and on),  &quot;Slow Train,&quot;  and &quot;Gotta Serve Somebody.&quot; My favorite song is &quot;When He  Returns,&quot; a moving and profound ballad, with beautfiul imagery:  &quot;Surrender your crown on this bloodstained ground, take off your mask.  He sees your deeds, he knows your needs, even before you ask.&quot;  From  the slow to the grinding, this album is a powerful, moving, expression of  Christian music. So-called Dylan fans who can not get past the 1970's and  can not accept that Dylan has grown and matured and improved are really  missing out on something here.
0800139151|5.0|THE QUICK AND THE DEAD has to be one of the most heartwarming movie westerns of all time. It has SHARON STONE  as a gun slinging woman back to test the taste of vengeance. Gene Hackman co-stars with Leonardo Dicaprio.  This movie has some fine music scores and an excellent camera work out.
0684872153|3.0|Angela's Ashes has a lot going for it.  It describes an absolutely horrific childhood in Ireland during the 1930s/1940s.  I had no idea there was so much poverty in Ireland only a generation ago.  Very eye-opening.   The book is also very accessible (ie, easy to read).<br />But upon finishing  the novel I didn't quite understand what drove folks to survive through  such hardship, and why most seemed to be fatalist about their plight.   While I can understand that perhaps Frank McCourt, as a child, didn't have  much thought on the matter, surely later on in his teens (towards the end  of Angela's Ashes) developed firm opinions on his parents, his environment,  etc.  This would have made the book more thought-provoking and less of a  &quot;childhood from hell&quot; documentary.<br />Having said all this,  Angela's Ashes is a great achievement.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I just got it in the mail today and I'm contemplating whether I should superglue it into my cd player so that it's always there!  I can't even count how long I've been waiting for the fourth Enigma album! I have all of  them and I have to say that I like this one the most. It is the moodiest  and by far the most powerful of all!  Gravity of Love just sends a  shivering wave down my back!  Endless Quest is probably the trademark  soundscape of Enigma incorporating the amazing panflute sounds that have  become synonymous with Enigma. The cd opens like the other 3 which gives a  very satisfying unity. You can see this if you listen to all four of them  in sequence. Smell of Desire is probably the most mellow track which  borrows the female vocals from the first album's Mea Culpa. This is one of  those ambient, afterhours songs that is definitely destined to become an  Ibiza favourite!  After all,  the Enigma cd's were all recorded on the  island. This is definitely the music to live life with!  Don't even dare  to hesitate bying it!
0517122707|5.0|This book is the most amazing piece of fiction I have ever read. The characters have such depth. You will remember each and everyone of them. I didn't want the story to end! I was saddened to have gotten to the last  page. What, not another 400pages of pure entertainment? I will say, I found  little funny outside of Igatius' riotious ramblings. Instead, I found it to  be a tragic story.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Metallica have brought out one of the finest albums that has ever been seen in a long time. The combination of the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra and the talents of Metallica was bliss to listen to, injecting  life into old favorites such as 'Fuel' and 'Enter Sandman', along with some  new songs that we have not heard.....Brilliant.

6303921248|5.0|I loved it, my husband loved it, my parents loved it, my mother-in-law loved it, friends loved it... I don't know anyone who didn't love this mini-series.  It was captivating, enchanting, funny, romantic, and  thoroughly Jane Austen.
B000002TYK|5.0|I guess I'm a simpleton, b/c I actually like this MORE than 'The Colour and the Shape.'  As one (professional) reviewer put it, it really is as if Lennon and McCartney grew up in Seattle.  Not deep, just very listenable.
0375707972|5.0|It is often difficult for the modern American Reader to immerse themselves into the European world of symbol, myth and power.  Yet, if one is to fully  understand the power of this work that is exactly what must be  accomplished.  This is not a Romance, it is not a history, it is a metaphor  that presents the ongoing struggle of passion to transcend the dark side of  humanity and in so doing, bring some sense of redemption to those haunting  events of history that often overpower the humanity of us all.<br />   When I  first began reading this work I was taken aback by its abruptness and terse  presentation.  However, as the story began to unfold it became apparent  that the author was attempting to place his characters in a life setting  that incorporated the youthful passions of a generation in the process of  renewal and the shadow of youthful passions whose blind allegiance to  forces beyond anyone's control ultimately led to its corruption and  downfall.  Hannah is the epitome of the youthful passion suffering under  the weight of age and guilt.  Images such as Hannah working on the  Streetcar, a train that in reality goes nowhere, and her retreat to the  warmth of a bath secluded from the business of the world are worth  reflection.    The desire of Hannah to be read to is indicative of a  childlike curiosity stretched between the harsh reality of what was and  what yet may be.  How interesting the twist of fate that brings the end of  the relationship, Hannah's arrest, trial and imprisonment.  The irony is  that she keeps her silence, in fact all keep silence except those who  accuse her of brutality.  Intriguing is the picture.  The accusor, the  accused, the facts in contrast with the findings of the court and then, the  reality that the accused has taken upon herself a portion of the collective  guilt.    Read this book with a discerning eye and pay attention to the  weavings of a tale that reflects a modern tragedy in the making.  Fallen  powers, twistedpersonalities, character flaws and the desire for  redemption all make their presence known.
B000002UJQ|5.0|It's hard to add anything to an already overwhelmingly positive group of reviews, but I have to say two things: firstly, to somebody who has not heard OK Computer -- this is truly one of the very few pieces of music that  has power to affect your life. As simple as that. Ok Computer could become  one of your most prized possesions if you let it connect with you, which  isn't hard. Secondly, I just want to say that I recently saw &quot;American  Beauty&quot; and in many ways found it to be a potent cinematic companion  to OK Computer in the themes it touches upon and in the way it does. Watch  the film and listen to the album, the combination might just change the way  you view life.
0688002307|5.0|Some readers don't get what this book is about. The main point that I took from it is that I matter; That quality is a two way street defined by the interaction between subject and object. It is also a great read! THE most  important book I have read, and I try to read the classics. It also lead me  (15 years later) to read Lao Tzu's &quot;Tao Te Ching.&quot; <br />This is not  a book, it is a journey that can change your life...if you're ready for it.
0780622553|5.0|First off, everyone who says this movie is just like the Matrix forgets that Dark City came out before the Matrix.  The acting is much better in this movie.  Also, the commentary by Roger Ebert is extremely interesting.   Once you understand the genre of Dark City, then you can appreciate the  acting done by Kiefer Sutherland.  This is one of my all-time favorite  movies.  Buy this DVD!
0425129586|5.0|I certainly agree with all these fanatical reviews.  But I feel I must defend the play.  Yes, it's simpler, and more innocent, but it's not a cop-out.  The reviewer of Jan. 11, 1999 should note that Lombard and Vera  are NOT murderers in the play--they both wind up being innocent of their  charges, so it is not a matter of two murderers getting married.<br />Having  said that, the book is certainly wonderful, extremely detailed and of  course suspenseful.
185984054X|4.0|Bad Dog Toto...I mean Hutchins... Whether you agree with all of his conclusions, Hutchins' book is a necessary critique, not only of Mother Teresa but of the whole religous philosophy of using other people's  misfortune and pain to your own spiritual advantage. There are literally  thousands of other Christians, and other people of faith and conscience,  who work tirelessly and heroically not only for the poor, broken and  oppressed, but AGAINST the oppressor. As an example, you have only to look  at the remarkable work of the American Friends Service Committee to see  true selfless action in progress. Teresa's goal was her own sanctification  and union with Christ, quite sincerely, and she was willing to justify just  about anything and gloss over oceans of compromise to meet this goal.  Remember many many years back when Time magazine printed her photo on the  cover and Teresa consented to have it published, supposedly reluctantly,  only if  &quot;God will release one soul from Purgatory for each photo  printed&quot;...is it just me or is it the ultimate in hubris to believe  that my likeness will release souls from purgatory?  Will she be canonized  a saint? Probably; and probably by John Paul II who has shown his  willingness to rush through canonizations for political reasons even if  troubling questions surround the candidate, (i.e. such as Maximillian Kolbe  and the allegations that in Poland anti-semitic literature was published  under his auspices. Defenders of Kolbe allege that yes, his religous press  unfortunately did publish such garbage but Father Kolbe didn't agree with  it. So why did allow it to be published?) And how very different Teresa of  Calcutta is from the other Teresa's who preceded her: Teresa of Avila,  spiritual adventuress, who had no problem tweeking the noses of  hypocritical Princes and Prelates and Terese of Lisiuex, the Little Flower,  who struggled with her faith as a carmelite nun, often with unrelenting  anguish, quietly tryingto understand God and the contradictions of faith,  out of the limelight and who may have NEVER been canonized a saint were it  not for the sometimes shameless canonization campaign of her sister and the  Guerin family. In a world of human suffering and injustice we definitely  need people willing to work hard to make our planet a better place to live  and thousands of unsung saints are doing just that, every day, quietly,  away from the cameras and the covers of the world's papers.  We would do  well to listen to the contrary voices of those who would question the  motives of those we would canonize &quot;Saint&quot;. We may not like what  we hear, but that's what makes their voice so crucially important.
0590353403|4.0|I invite all you middle-aged Muggles reading this review to take a chance and read this book. I'm a grown-up (about twice over) and I loved this story, particularly the descriptions of the sport of Quidditch: Imagine  Soccer, but with the rules rewritten by the likes of Jim Carey and Adam  Sandler and you'll have some idea of how amusing this sport is. <br />In Harry  Potter's world, paintings become doors with the right password, men live in  wooden houses and raise fire breathing Dragons, chessmen advise you as to  their optimal deployment and eating a chocolate frog is a good thing!   <br />Listen, Rowling is right about the world being full of fearful Muggles  who have lost their sense of magic. Fortunately, after reading this book,  you won't be one of them. And, should your children, after reading this  book, turn a mouse into a snuffbox, I suggest, in true Hogwarts Tradition,  that you award points for originality, but gravely deduct for any whiskers  left upon it.
014028009X|2.0|Thought this book was very trite.  Bridget is the epitomy of the women today who are falling victim to the &quot;media view&quot; of what you should be like.  To begin each day evaluating your self worth by how much  you weigh, how many lottery tickets you purchased, etc.  Get over it!   Found it hard to get emotionally involved with the characters in this book.
6302914191|5.0|Twin Peaks is, in my opinion, the most enthralling piece of audio/visual media I have ever seen.  There will be a DVD release, but either way, everyone should see this amazing television series from the greatest  director of all time, David Lynch
3895082333|2.0|I found the book sentimental and boring.  The characters were unbelievable; one neurotic and one naive.  This book would be good for those who are vulnerable and easily swayed by the words of a woman who's  obviously never had true romance.
B000002LMM|5.0|There are no words to describe the quality of this album.  Even unbelievable would seem like an understatement.  Angelo Badalamenti is a genius, no question.  Also, he has the brains to hook up with Lynch, which  would automatically categorize anyone as great.   BUY THIS ALBUM BEFORE YOU  DIE!
0790732521|5.0|This movie was wonderful.  Not only is the acting superb but the story is excellent.
6302054982|5.0|This review only refers to the VHS version.  I have not experienced the DVD version, but it sounds rediculous.  This movie is unbelievable.  Scorcese does an amazing job, as does DeNiro, Liotta and Pesci.  This is  the best gangster movie ever made, hands down.  You need to go out and add  it to your movie collection (unless your movie collection consists of DVD,  then wait an hour before buying it) immediately.
0964385619|5.0|This book should be mandatory reading for every child in high school. It shows the difference in thought patterns and attitude that make all the difference between a j.o.b. (just over broke) and being financially  independent and living the life you want and deserve.
B00000K3UR|1.0|Big Daddy started out depicting Sonny (Adam Sandler) as your typical distastful bachelor brainless wonder searching for the good life with a beautiful girl by his side and ended with him having it all (the money, the  friends, the wife, the kids, the status) while still enjoying the pleasures  of singledom.  The plot was okay, but the language and the content was  disgusting.  You must have a strong stomach to watch this movie.  There was  no real comedy.  There were real issues brought to light, but no real  examination of them.  It was depressing and dull.
B00003Q438|1.0|The Abyss is a continuation of that on-going, pathetic, story in the American filmmaking industry commonly known to most people by its nickname- &quot;Hollywood&quot;... an assembly of very talented actors whose talents  are unfortunately wasted under the direction of an incompetent director-  this time it's James Cameron. Add in the $$million$$ dollar special effects  extravaganza to the immature script, cheesy &quot;feel-good&quot;  soundtrack, and cheesy dialogue leading up to the very cheesy ending, and  what we have here is an underwater tear-jerker epic in the making(no, it's  8 years too early for Titanic)....The Abyss. I would've given it  &quot;2&quot; stars, but they had to re-release the &quot;Director's  Cut&quot; version, which made it even worse. Therefore, I am compelled to  give it a rating of &quot;1&quot; (only because &quot;0&quot; is not  allowed here). To me, there are 2 types of &quot;Director's Cut&quot;. 1.  The addition of footage that was cut out, because it was considered too  explicit by the censors. 2. The addition of footage that was shot, but  wasn't included due to time constraints. The Abyss falls under neither  category, with the end product adding nothing more than very bad outtakes  of Ed Harris mumbling to himself in place of the aliens so that we know  their(the aliens) true intentions on earth. People watching the  &quot;Director's Cut&quot; for the first time who have already seen the  regular version won't be surprised at all by how the plot turns out in the  predictably weak &amp; all-too simple of a script. If James Cameron had any  brains at all, he would've anticipated that someday there would be a demand  for a &quot;Director's Cut&quot;, and brought the actors back into the  studio even after the film's release to shoot the necessary scenes to give  it more cohesion for a future release. Not slop in a bunch of mediocre  outtakes and say &quot;Ok, here's my masterpiece the way it was intended to  be seen. Blah, blah, blah...&quot;. If anything, The Abyss is eye candy to  dazzle 12-year olds and nothing more.
B000002AGN|5.0|Somewhere out there in outer space, there is a tone-deaf race of aliens who hate this stuff.   The rest of us punters should buy this album, immediately!  Yes, Take Five is overplayed, but who cares?  Some  obnoxiously catchy tunes are clever enough to deserve being listened to  over and over again.  Obey your tastes with this one.
0385484518|3.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who likes the Chicken Soup for the Soul series but I thought it was a little silly and sentimental.
B000002ADT|5.0|Every time I play Kind of Blue, I fall in love again with my wife, my kids, with God, with life itself.  I don't let a week go by without listening to it.  The remastered version at 20 bits is incredible; don't  bother with the 16 bit. I have them both, won't part with either, but only  play the 20 bit. The clarity brings out the rhythm section dramatically.   Miles, and jazz, at its best.
6305657939|5.0|I saw this in the theater and was very impressed.  It is a very mature movie; a nice change.  And it always kept you guessing.  I was glad to see a movie that wasn't like all the others.
B00000GAIW|5.0|This tremendous album, by one of the great bands of the 70s, I believe, is one of the greatest, sweetest-sounding, most thought-provoking albums of all time.  The title track, though crude and simple in the beginning,  flowers into a beautiful anthem of pure rock and roll.  Locomotive Breath  is a wonderful jam which showcases all of the band members' talents,  especially Ian Anderson's uncanny ability on the flute, an instrumental  which gives me goosebumps every time I hear it.  The entire album is about  a controversial topic, the hypocrisy of the Church.  Not only the music on  this album is intelligent, but the lyrics are as well.  I would recommend  this album to any rock and roll fan, it is fabulous.
B000002BSG|5.0|I've had this CD since it came out a good few years ago and have loved it since and the only reason i'm reviewing it is because of the stupid twats that gave it one star. i just dont know how it is possible to criticise  this, almost every song is great, in fact EVERY song is great and easy to  listen to, especially Jay-Kay thrashing his Lambourghini Diablo. What a  Guy!
1559408758|5.0|&quot;HELLO CLEVELAND!&quot;  This is a hilarious movie!  It's almost a knock off of the ROLLING STONES - but funny.  Improve and famous faces make this movie funny and enjoyable.  Very sarcastic and clever
B00003CXC7|5.0|Rear Window is perhaps one of the most commendable films in our history. It keeps you glued, eye-fixed, and in a tension that reaches a hight not attained by many films in the thriller category. It's one of the few classics that you can see over and over again. The camera work and the  script is admirable, you are literally sucked into the act. James Stewart  is marvellous in his performance and fits as an exact-size glove in his  role.
6304795254|1.0|...as my first review, mysteriously, never appeared in the roster. Onward: Michael Douglas = worse actor than a trained monkey; hearing Sean Penn say &quot;touche&quot; is plain torture; how Fincher went from this atrocity to  Fight Club, the best movie of 1999, is an enigma better left unexplored. On  the whole, a film so flat as to be two-dimensional; it has no redeeming  features, I assure you.
0425156842|5.0|The book is a must read for all who are slightly interested in where we come from, who we are, and how we think. It explains easily the philosophies of all the great thinkers through known history, and has the  reader wandering down philosophy's path.
B00000K31V|4.0|First of all, get the Canadian edition--as a previous reviewer stated, it has three separate audiocommentary tracks. It even has a documentary about the production designer, which seems to be an odd inclusion. Secondly, this  is as much religious criticism as it is science fiction, and if you like  both this film, although slow, is never boring. Finally, this is a film  wherein the viewer sees only intriguing pieces of the puzzle rather than  the whole picture. It is thought-provoking and rewards repeated viewings,  and certainly worth owning.
B00000K2SC|5.0|2476 reviews. I havent seen anywhere near this many on any other title yet. It kicks you-know-what pretty hard. If you haven't seen this movie are not allowed to rent or buy any other sci-fi flick until you do.
1558908358|4.0|Clu is the &quot;earthly&quot; (i.e. computer) embodiment of Flynn; Clu is crucified by the MCP Demiurge, and is &quot;resurrected&quot; as Flynn; after his baptism in the pure-source-of-power &quot;water,&quot; the bit  (dove) descends and he first utilizes his User-powers. After teaching the  programs love (he kisses Yori, the first kiss in the computer world), he  leaves the computer world forever. Awesome!
B00000I8BX|5.0|as a whole that is! Demanufacture may have two of Fear Factory's best songs Replica and Self Bias Resistor there are to many weak songs while Obsolete is a solid listen all the way through. There are some really good  songs here Shock, Edgecrusher, Descent, and Freedom or Fire are all filled  with driving riffs, pounding drums, and wide ranged vocals. Burton C. Bell  has a very good voice that has great range. He could be growling one moment  and melodic the next. All the songs are great and is enjoyable all the way  through.<br />This isn't a Death Metal album if that is what you are looking  for. Personally I don't think Fear Factory is a Death Metal band, more like  a Heavy Metal band. However, this is an awesome album that can shake the  very foundation of your house!
0486282112|4.0|it was good. i was glad i read it because it got rid of the stereotypes from the movie, like the monster being named Frankenstein.  The story line was very intriging in addition to thecreative narration style.  However in  terms of being able to relate to specific charaters, the book was very much  lacking.  This may however have to do with the time period Mary Shelley  wrote the book in, as a work of romantism it is very good.  I expected the  book to be heavily feminist but i found myself pleasntly surprised that it  wasn't overly feministic.  I didn't expec great things more the book and  didn't get anything spectacular.  I thought the introduction was the most  interectiong part, about how the story idea came from.  I would recommend  reading for about Mary Shelley to get a grater understanding of the novel.
B00000J6AG|5.0|Play, is without a doubt, my favourite release of 1999.  Moby has done it again. Took off from the last disc, I Like To Score, and went in a new direction.   True, some tracks have the electronica-meets-blues vibe, but  all of these tracks (Honey, Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad, Run On) are good  enough to stand on their own, rather than being grouped into &quot;one of  Moby's bluestechno songs&quot; category. But there is FAR more than these  songs on this disc.  Moby Does straight techno excellently (ie: bodyrock).   and addition to that there are songs like Porcelain, Everloving and South  Side that are so unbelievably gorgeous that you'll scarcely believe it.    Moby is all about change.  His past work, is excellent. Evey thing he does,  wether it be techno or straight guitar rock is usually superior to his  &quot;contemporaries&quot; in those generes.   Play is just another example  of this.
B000031WD9|5.0|I enjoyed the movie very much it really brought me back to my teenage years. I liked the end it really made a pretty good plot. the end of the movie was the perfect finale to a hilarious movie and I would reccomend  this to everyone and that is why I gave it five stars GREAT MOVIE!  PS:  dont watch this with friends of the opposit sex kind of weird!
0425170349|2.0|While action streamed readily from the novel, the overall architecture of the story was just a bit too stilted, too crude for my tastes. The narrator(s) seemed to think I, a reader, was unable to remember facts for he kept repeating them (\\"I opened the trunk -- the boot that is,\\" the novel told us in yet another way of describing the disparities between American English and English proper.). I was also lectured to about the \\"psychopathic profile of a terrorist\\" at least five times throughout the course of the story. We see that the narrator is not only condescending (or feeble) but fascist in style as well. He kept a choke hold on the plot even when the maintenance of it meant lapsing into fantasy (government agents behaving personally against the bad guys; both of whom appear to get stupider as the book wears on). And as the plot continued on in Nazi-like fashion, I began to question whether the characters and narrator were of sane mind. Don't misunderstand: about half of the novel read like any good pulp, but afterwards it seemed like the storyteller wanted to make sure that he touched on scenes A, B, C an D regardless of the ensuing incongruities. Informationally, the novel helped describe some pretty nifty concepts: modern weapons and suveillance systems, combat aircraft and tactics used by counter-intelligence organizations. I've heard that one of Clancy's earlier novels came close to describing events that took place early in the eighties. Unfortunately for us, Clancy's \\"Rainbow Six\\" illustrates that he continues to move further from detailed realism and toward a type of story that is both unlikely and mediocre.
B00000637V|5.0|To listen to Lou Reed's most poignant piece of art yet, you must be prepared to feel extreme emotional pain.  But there really is no choice in the matter.  There are sometimes that you must suffer for art. Just as  Schindler's List was not one of those movies you want to see, but must see,  Berlin is an album no person should skip.  Every person with an ounce of  care for other people should be required to listen to  this album.  Perhaps children should even be weened on this masterpiece, to  teach them about suffering and the need for compassion and humanitarianism.    If the lack of musical patronage was a crime, then this is one unsung  masterpiece that would soon inherit the respect it so richly deserves.
B00003XB8K|3.0|I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of Enigma's style of music -- however, if you are looking for something unique, groundbreaking, or more fulfilling than Michael Cretu's past 3 works, this is not the CD  for you. This 4th major Enigma album rehashes old music, old beats, and old  themes... the only twist is a harder edge, and some powerfully-hitting  choral samples, as well as the welcome introduction of a great new female  vocalist.  Good music as usual, but disappointing in its inferiority to  Enigma 3
B000005H4X|5.0|Art Blakey is an almost legendary jazz drummer, and this CD starts off with one of his classics: Moanin'.  I have heard several different versions of this song, and I think the two on this album are the best.  Also, the  subtle complexities of his &quot;Drum Thunder Suite&quot; give us a glimpse  into a level of apendage independance most drummers can only dream about.   A great and worthwhile CD if you like 50's style jazz.
B00002R0MC|5.0|I've plowed through countless used-CD stores for a couple of years trying to find the discontinued first issue of this box set. You don't need to! The set has everything from the early ska-stages to disco-marley. The  acoustic medley on disc 2 (playing for J. Cash) redefines Marley. Although   Marley's lack of range on &quot;I'ma hurting inside&quot; made me hurt  inside. Buy it!
6302250269|5.0|THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME AND I LOVE TO WATCH IT WITH MY BEST FRIEND. IT MAKES YOU CRAVE THE OPEN ROAD...AND THE ADVENTURE OF LIFE. THIS MOVIE HAS SUCH GOOD ACTING AND ONE OF THE BEST SCRIPTS EVER. KICK BACK WITH A TINY  TRAVEL BOTTLE OF WILD TURKEY AND ENJOY! (watch the movie and you'll know  what i mean.) :0)
0800141326|3.0|This movie is okay. I can't stand Maria Pittilo though. She was an actress with potential, but she decided to run through the film with her knees tied together. I think that it was the director's fault though. The director is  the one who makes the cast work like a running machine.<br />Anyway, I think  this movie was probably the best the first time I saw it. All the suprises  were still fresh, and Maria Pittilo and Matthew Broderick's acting didn't  seem so bad.<br />The special effects were eccelent, especially considering  the fact that they weren't done by a major special effects company like  ILM, or Digital Domain.<br />I think that there were some good points to the  acting, like Hank Azeria and Jean Reno. The action scenes are fun, and  loud. And I LOVE Godzilla's new look. Shorter, faster, and more menacing. I  think what dullened the film was this: too high of a budget. When you've  got 80,000,000 dollars to spend, you will make mistakes. The Mummy only had  a budget of 40,000,000, and it is sooo great. I think if the creators were  more careful, they could have done much better with this film.
0767809246|5.0|I KNOW EVERY LINE. NO, I'M NOT A NERD...I'VE JUST SEEN THIS MOVIE MORE TIMES THAN I CAN COUNT. THE ACTING IS AMAZING, AND THE STORY IS SO TOUCHING. BUT IT'S NEVER GOOEY. IT'S ALWAYS RAW AND REAL. GREAT MUSIC,  BEAUTIFUL SCENERY, FABULOUS ACTING, FAULTLESS DIRECTION, AND ALL AROUND A  HIGHLY ENJOYABLE FILM. THIS IS ONE MOVIE YOU CAN WATCH OVER AND OVER, AND  IT'S GREAT TO WATCH WITH A GROUP OF YOUR BEST FRIENDS. I RECOMMEND THIS  FILM VERY HIGHLY!
B00002Z88D|5.0|S&amp;M is proof that metallica has matured from their head banging days back in the 80's.  they now have the money and creativity to try new and different things with their music.  this is an album that can't be ignored  by curious music listeners, highlights include the new orchestrated Master  of Puppets, For whom the bell tolls, Nothing else matters, and the new  tracks, minus human and no leaf clover.  orchestra and metallica, the  future of a band that wont stop trying new things and with plenty of energy  left to accomplish anything they encounter.
B00000J7JO|5.0|One the most beatiful album from R.H.C.P. and simply the best album for 1999. The sound of the band is perfect: rock together with great ballades. Welcome back Red Hot Chili Peppers !
B00001ZWTT|4.0|this is a silly movie but it is meant to be. not one thing in this movie is meant to be taken seriously. if you look at it as a serious movie then i am sure many will hate it. but if you see it just for some laughs and the  effects then it can be watchable and fun. if you are a will smith fan you  will more than likly enjoy it. i never saw the tv series from the 60's so i  didn't have anything to base it against.
B000002H2H|5.0|I now own every Metallica album, and this is the best!  I wrote that for Master of Puppets, but this just mops the floor with it.  First of all, &quot;For Whom the Bell Tolls&quot; has always been they're best, and then  I heard &quot;Ktulu&quot;, &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, and  &quot;Escape&quot;  All awsome!   I don't like &quot;Ride the  Lightning&quot;, but the beginning in my opinion, is the best guitar part  ever.  Cliff was still with them then, and oh my gosh were they  INCREDIBLE!   Buy this album fast!   I also recommend &quot;Master of  Puppets&quot;, The &quot;Black&quot; Album, and the newest,  &quot;S&amp;M&quot;.  I also reccomend Megadeth's &quot;Countdown to  Extinction&quot; and &quot;Risk&quot;.  Metallica and Megadeth still and  will always rule metal.  They are both my favorite bands.  I'm trying to  get all the Megadeth albums.  They both RULE!
630529142X|3.0|this movie is just for fun. there are no wild plots, nor amazing acting or special effects. just a few laughs along the way. which is really what the film was made for.
0688170528|5.0|This book was recommended to me last fall.  I didn't get around to purchasing it until we had a snowstorm last week.  WHAT WAS I WAITING FOR?  I read this remarkable 400 page novel in 1 day. <br />Picoult paints a very  real set of characters throughout her book.  The circumstances drag you  into the heart of conflict.  At times, it seemed as though I was within the  skin of these characters.  The suspense is amazing, and I found myself  contemplating what would happen next.<br />This is an excellent read.  Not  only is it exciting, but it also takes the time to delve into the curious  relationship of two teenagers, their families, and the friendship of adult  women.<br />This novel left me with a new perspective.  Things are NOT always  as they seem...and love can be quite harmful. I recommend this to  EVERYONE...especially teenagers and their parents.
B00000K19E|5.0|what can i say, this movie is truely great. the story had me guessing the action is fast and fluid, the effects are great. fishburne was amazing and even keanu reeves could'nt ruin it. this one i have watched many times  since buying it and i recommend it whole heartily.
B000002H2H|5.0|This album is great and contains such classics like &quot;fade to black&quot; and &quot;for whom the bell tolls&quot; go get.
B00002E233|1.0|i am so glad i missed this at the cinema. the movies idea is a good one, finding a solution to mental deseases. but it soon loses the plot. the sfx are really bad and that is a shame as it could have been the movies saving  grace. but so often it looks cgi, the sharks rarely move like real ones.  many of the situations are unbelievable each one trying to top the next.  really there is nothing new here. it is in many ways a jurassic park idea.  i recommend renting it before buying. then you can make your own mind about  the film.
B000002BE9|1.0|Although I won't say that she's trying to be Tori Amos, no one could acheive that, she definetely is not doing anything so impressive. Her lyrics sound even more self-obsessed than Tori's. It's like she's trying to  be philosophical, but it's not quite working. I feel the same anger and  guilt she does, but I want a singer who demands and includes me at the same  time, whereas Fiona Apple just seems to be venting her anger towards me. I  want you to understand my pain and make me feel better, not to feel guilty  for your pain! If she got some singing lessons, actually played the piano  (does she just say she plays the piano, 'cause I've never seen her do so),  and didn't try to solve her problems with rage but with understanding, she  would be a much better artist. I respect her though for trying. Good luck  Fiona in discovering you might actually have more talent than you show.
B00001PE4D|4.0|i really didn't think i was going to like this movie and in the end i did. the sets are impressive the acting is very clear and all the characters held my interest. the story rarely seemed to drag. it was something more  than i expected and done in an exciting and tasteful way. definetly worth a  watch.
B000002C1X|5.0|I dont even like this type of music.. I like Techno.. But this album is amazing... It's almost ambient... I wish I had it on Vinyl so much !  It contains so much emotion! Its more a work of art then an album.. Each song  seems carefully arranged to give the right effect...ohh its great
6305137293|4.0|THIS IS SUCH A GOOD SEQUEL.PROBABLY THE BEST SEQUEL OF ALL TIME.I JUST WISH NICK CASTLE WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SHAPE AGAIN,AND OF COURSE HAD JOHN CARPENTER BE THE DIRECTOR.IF THOSE TWO THINGS WOULD BE THIS WOULD HAVE FOR  SURE GOT 5 STARS.I LOVE THIS MOVIE,BUY IT NOW!
0517122707|5.0|My father,after a visit to New Orleans, gave me this book about 16 years ago.Probably the best gift he ever gave me.I have continued to read it over the years.It grabbed me the first time and has never realeased its  grip on me. It has altered the way I look at the world. It taught me to  revel in life's absurdities and not to be frightened by them.This book  proves that political correctness sanitizes the world in ways that strip us  of our intellect.  When people who share the common experience of having  read this book meet,it never fails to ignite,at the very least,a spirited  conversation if not outright friendship. I do not recommend this book to  people...I simply present it to them.I keep a supply on hand and find great  pleasure in being the catalyst for those who take up the challenge and  embark on this magnificently unique and hilarious journey. <br />I lay down a  gauntlet...Read it and LAUGH! <br />Warning: Hazardous if read in public.May  cause uncontrollable fits of hysteria.
B0000039LE|5.0|AND EVERY TIME I WATCH IT IT GETS BETTER!I'VE BEEN SUCH A LOYAL FAN TO HALLOWEEN SINCE I WAS 5. JOHN CARPENTER IS THE GREATEST DIR. OF ALL TIME! HE MADE THE THING,THEY LIVE,DARK STAR,IN THE MOUTH OF MADNESS,CHRISTINE,BIG  TROUBLE IN LITTLE CHINA,VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED,AND SO MANY MORE  GREATS.HALLOWEEN IS THE BEST MOVIE OF ALL TIME.YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH THIS  CLASSIC,AND IF YOU DONT LIKE IT THEN YOU NEED A VISIT FROM THE SHAPE  HIMSELF,I COULD GO ON AND ON FOR HOURS TALKING ABOUT THIS MOVIE BUT I DOUBT  ANYONE IS READING THIS ANYWAY,BYE!
B00002R0MC|5.0|I bought this album when it was first released in 1992. I was truly amazed at it then. Due to some unfortunate circumstances, my original discs were damaged. I have been looking everywhere for a replacement for the last 3  years. This is an incredible collection. Listen especially to the acoustic  medley in Vol. 2. I also love the first 4 songs in Vol. 1. It really gives  a retrospective into Marley's ska roots. Duppy Conquerer and Redemption  Song are also exquisite. I am thanking my lucky stars that I have found  this collection again. Enjoy.
6301562925|4.0|WHEN DID THE MYERS HOUSE BECOME SOME MANSION?I LIKED THE MOVIE ALOT,BUT THERE WAS SOME DUMB PARTS I'LL SAY.IT JUST WAS'NT A GREAT HALLOWEEN MOVIE IT WAS A GOOD HALLOWEEN MOVIE,AND IM GLAD MIKEY GETS KILLED(SORRY IF I  RUINED IT FOR YOU)!
B000040OBS|4.0|Suicide were the first punk band that didn't have guitars, drums and bass in its setup. This box set contains their groundbreaking debut album and two live performances at different locations. Their self-titled debut is  still one of the most acclaimed and innovative records in the history of  electronic music. Alan Vega's manic vocals with their unpredictable whoops,  hollers, and shouts mix perfectly with roaring Moog synthesizers and  machine-generated, up-tempo beats. But it's not sheer confrontation and  threat. In fact, this record is very listenable and comes up with lots of  good melodies. I'd rather describe it as tension-filled and bittersweet.  The first part of the live section offers another bunch of classic songs  like &quot;Mr Ray&quot;, &quot;96 tears&quot;, and &quot;Harlem&quot;. The  Brussels performance is nearly unlistenable, there's too much background  noise and other distortion. All in all, this is a very good and  recommendable album.
B00000JCB2|1.0|When I listen to music,I like it to make me really feel something. Well this made me feel something all right. It sort of scared me because if this is the best music that anyone can offer then I think music is officially  approaching oblivion. The music stinks so bad that you can literally smell  how putrid it is. The same can be said of the lyrics. If it's real music  you're looking for, I suggest you try Nirvana,Hole,or L7. As for Limp  Bizkit I suggest you stear clear of this pure junk.
B000002C2E|5.0|Well over 2 years after I bought it, TOOM is still about the only studio album I listen too.  And that is a true testiment to the album and to Dylan.  I have everything he's ever done and countless bootlegs, and this  recording is up at the top. Both in its brilliant instrumentation and Bob's  uncharacteristically direct lyrics, TOOM is a distinct and unique triumph  in the ordinarily ordinary modern pop arena.  So if you like smokey  electric blues and a voice that'll cut right through your soul....then  click on the button and pick this one up.  I can promise it'll never leave  your stereo.
0679731725|5.0|This novel is a real miracle of literature. I am impressed by marvelous beauty and purity of its language (such uncommon example in modern  literature inundated with slang and obscenities)which allow to compare it  with the high literary classic. Nurtured in Russian literature I wish to  liken Kazuo Ishiguro to Russian writer Anton Chekhov: concise style, exact  descriptions, unsurpassed mastery of explicit psychological characteristics  of characters (especially if a protagonist makes every attempt to suppress  any manifestation of his inner emotions), - all this is similar for both  authors. Surface simplicity of the story disguises intricateness of its  internal composition and concealed psychological motives making books of  both writers  difficult for screen adaptation.<br />Professionalism and fate  of an individual in swiftly changing world are the main themes of the  novel, extremely important for modern society where business becomes new  god. Professionalism gives possibility to live repletely but only innermost  moral fortitude gives possibility to survive psychically and even  spiritually intact. Mr Stevens, the novel's narrator, is a perfect  professional, a 'great butler'. His personal ethic shrunk to a size of  official duties so that love and death are powerless before them. But world  has crucially changed and Mr Stevens is trying to adjust himself to a new  world, to a new employer, to change not only his behavior but style of  thinking in order to please his new master, for this is the demand of his  profession. It is important for every human being not to repudiate the old  world as the worst one (trying to neglect its positive features), not to  accept 'the new brave world' as the best one (for he/she will discern its  negative sides later) but to preserve his/her soul for sound estimation of  what is going on.<br />The last meeting of the heroes - Mr Stevens and former  Miss Keaton - sheds new light on the story making Miss Keaton not a victimof Mr Stevens' blind, unperceptive heart but a genuine heroine of the  novel, a person who does not permit her high-leveled professionalism to  prevail over main human feelings, who has moral mettle to follow accepted  decision. The final deed of Miss Keaton is not a vergeance of previously  rejected love but a correct ethical choice of strong disposition. Conniving  at uncontrolled feelings (especially sexual desire) puts individuals on the  verge of life and death, creates pain and destruction around and within  them (Anna Karenina in famous Tolstoy's novel, characters of Ondaatje's  'The English Patient'); sound moral choice in hard circumstances and  endurance of its results afterwads is the only fit possibility (Tatyana in  Pushkin's 'Onegin') - this is the conclusion of great literature, wherein  the novel of Kazuo Ishiguro can be rightly included.
B000002AQQ|5.0|I love old music from the 50's and 60's, I grew up on them.  And this CD set has some of the best that there is.  Granted, the price is a little steep, but it is 2 CD's of great music, and it's something that I know I'll  love when all of the teenage fads my friends are investing their money in  are gone.  With tunes like, &quot;Respect&quot;, &quot;Fortunate Son&quot;,  &quot;Mrs. Robinson&quot;(one of the best songs ever, in my opinion),  &quot;For what it's worth&quot;, the list goes on.  This is a great CD that  everyone should own.

B00000J7J4|4.0|I'd never really heard of Santana before this album came out, I mean, he was a little before my time, but my best friend had the CD and I heard &quot;Smooth&quot; (This was before it became the radio favorite that is is  now, and I'm sure everyone is so sick of it they never want to hear it  again) and I loved it, I thought it was such a good song, so i bought the  CD and found out that there are SO many good songs on this album.   &quot;Put your Lights On&quot;, &quot;Maria Maria&quot;, and my personal  favorite, &quot;Love of my Life&quot; are all amazing songs.  I never would  have guesses that this album would be one of my favorite of the year, but  it is.  Santana is nothing short of a master on the guitar, and he mixed  his talent with popular artists of today to come up with something pretty  incredible.

6302779278|5.0|There's a lot more thinking involved than you'd think- mostly because half of the cast wants to kill Whitney's character-  but they never can with SUPER Kevin around! <br />Honestly, it's a little predictable, but a GREAT  romantic thriller.  Although I wish there was a little more romance and a  little less thrilling..  Whitney Houston is charming and captivating and  Kevin is- well heck!  He doesn't need to be anything other than Kevin ;0)
B000002MIY|5.0|The first song I heard off of this was &quot;Tomorrow's Girls&quot; and it was good, but not the best.  I bought the disc anyway, because I like Fagen's music.  I did a listen-through and I came upon Teahouse on the  Tracks, and I knew this record was a winner.  Fagen and Becker work  together to create a solid feel, a Steely Dan record in all but name.  The  use top-notch studio musicians, including some alumni from the Blues  Brothers Band, Alan Rubin and Lou Marini.  Other tracks worthy of note are  Countermoon, Trans-Island Skyway, and Florida Room.  It's a solid purchase,  one you won't regret if you like a seamless integration of jazz and pop,  coupled with a healthy dose of talent.
6305546789|5.0|The atmosphere that this film creates is fantastic. The performances are great, I mean this is how teenagers act.  And when a film doesn't have to show blood and guts and still gets you spooked and creates a character that  is a part of our culture, over 20 years later is a major accomplishment.
0792110188|5.0|This is my favorite John Wayne movie...hands down. The music is cool, the acting is good, the plot is terrific, and John Wayne is at his toughest! Robert Mitchum is a great costar as the drunken sheriff J.P. Harra. Once he  sobers up, he's the fastest and toughest gun in the West (besides Cole  Thornton (Wayne), of course!) When Harra hits Bart Jason (the bad guy) in  the face with his rifle, it makes your own jaw hurt. Ouch! He'll feel that  in the morning! There are plenty of funny parts in this movie too. I LOVE  the part where \\"Mississippi\\" is giving his \\"sobering up\\" concoction to  Mitchum. That is really funny! This movie is definitely worth your money!  So, grab your best pony, 6 shooter, and saddle pal, and gallop along with  the Duke in one of the greatest Westerns ever made!
0385484518|5.0|No matter if you're 8 or 80, I think this book contains important lessons on life for everybody. It's a sweet and real story, that will probably touch everybody's heart, and we all can learn from it: life is fragile. I also liked the handy size of this hardcover version as it fits into my  purse and I can carry it with me all the time. Another book that I highly  recommend, because it discusses the key issues in life fervently, is  Dietmar Scherf's &quot;I Love Me: Avoiding and Overcoming Depression&quot;  also available.
6305350205|5.0|This is absoulutely one of the best Trek films you'll ever see.  What really boggles me is how many people have labeled this film a very terrible one.  While the film does not give the eye candy that some people may  crave, it gives Trek fans everything else that they could want.<br />For  example, the plot of the film, while a bit far-fetched, still holds true to  the ideals Star Trek has to offer.  Sybok, a emotional vulcan has taken  upon himself to find God.  But he needs a Starship to reach him, so he  kidnaps three civilians of Nimbus III and sends a message to the worlds  each civilians are from.  From Starfleet comes Jame T. Kirk and the  Starship Enterprise to save the day.  There you have it, the basic  plotline.  What I like about this setup is that it rids Trek of the  constant plots centering around the destruction of a planet and focuses on  the exploration of not only space, but of the human mind and its pain. It  also questions life itself.  i.e. Is it really just a dream? The end result  is it is a much more deep plot than that of Insurrection. <br />Character  development is also a plus in this film.  Just about all the characters  changed in some way throughout the course of it.  Much attention was given  to the relationship of friendship and family that Kirk, Spock, and Mccoy  share and we see Sybok go through the change of being much more complex  than first impressions show.<br />All and all Trek and non-Trek fans should  enjoy this Movie despite it's less than great special effects.  My advice  is to sit back, enjoy and not nitpick.  Movies are just movies, they are  not life.  If you need to escape the reality of life for a few hours, I  highly recommend you experience this installment in the enjoyable Trek  series.
0790740443|3.0|This movie was okay. It was nothing new or special. The movie starts at 1996 and goes to 2046. This movie is kind of weird. The story revolves around a solider program where humans are selcted and taught to kill over a  17 year program. Kurt Russell plays a 40 year-old solider who has fought  inmany of Earth's wars. He is thought to be killed and takin' to a trash  disposal planet. There he awakens and meets a group of rebels living on the  planet. They take him in where the solider gets in touch with himself and  starts becoming human. But a team of better soliders comes to the planet to  kill of the peolple on the planet. Russell helps these peolple fight them  off and takes them to Earth. The plot may sound cool but this movie isn't  at all special. It is alright. Kurt Russell is good but barely ever talks.  If you like sci-fi you'll enjoy it. If your picky about certain movies,  stay away.

B000002C1X|3.0|Some of the songs on THE WALL are brillant, songs like comfortamly numb and mother, goodbye blue sky and the happiest days of our lives and hey you are all increable pieces of music, destained to take their places with  masterpieces like Zeppelins stairway to heaven and bowies WARSZAWA. But the  problem is with waters, he lyrics are to pointed, the more dream like and  melodic darkside of the moon lyrics were dreamy expanisve pieces that  adresses problems with enough amibiguty as so there point were not lost due  to mass missinterpartation , and anyone could take away there own meaning  from them. Here the lyrics are more obsssed with mental illness but are not  evocative enough to bring the listner close enough to fell the despiration  of the main charater &quot;Pink&quot;. What made darkside so inteasting was  how waters never gavewa clear picture of who the album was affecting,  making any listener able to make the album their own .Musicaly the album  falls short of the emotional power of strugling aganist unseen force. The  froces talked about In darkside had some much presence becaues if ther  hidding in the shadows, what he did know scared us becuaes it could be  anything. In THE WALL waters names his tormentors, his mother, teacher, and  woman in genral, here he lose the impact by saying more than implying.  Darkside was truly a powerful pices becaues of it strugle aganist falling  apart, the up and down battle of trying to surive. THE WALl falls flat  becaues it shows a charater going down without a fight, mabey if waters had  an evoactive wail that showed true despiration, the uneasy fact that he  falling into an abyss, the album could have been truly power. What made  Nine Inch Nails the downward spiral power despite it short comming was  reznor truly disturbing singing which gave the album power. Had waters used  this, it might have saved the wall. The otehr main problem is with gilmour,  who changed his truly evoactive solos to fit waters lyrical vison.But not  all is lost, the sound track to the film alctualy works a lot better due to  the images suppiled by the music, it possible that listening to the wall is  only half the experince
0440224764|2.0|What can I say?  This book had absolutely no drama, no surprises, and it was so bad that I didn't even finish the last 50 pages, because I didn't care how it ended.  Time and time again, a plan was made by the bed ridden  lawyer, and then it was followed through exactly that way.  The characters  were also drab, making a very boring tale.  I can't believe I read so much  of this book.  Maybe because the words were big and their were just a few  lines per page, making you read a page in about ten seconds.  I don't know  if I'll ever read another of Mr. Grisham's books again.
B000002C1W|3.0|Technically this is a brilliant album.Nobody can really doubt the musical abilities of Gilmour and Co.Even the artwork is excellent;however one would have a hard time calling this a landmark album-seems more like a Gilmour  solo venture.The absence of Roger Waters is evident:let's face it,he was  the force and the vision behind Pink Floyd.Last great and true Pink Floyd  venture?If your answer is'The Final Cut'(1983),you are correct.
B0000013G9|4.0|this disc is solid.good song-writting&amp;production.a musical vibe of Babyface&amp;prince.waterfalls,red light special,creep etc..this is there best by far&amp;away.
B000002KMY|4.0|A small correction to the Emap review:the drummer here was Vinnie Appice,and not Carmine.Vinnie also appeared on two other Black Sabbath albums(1982's'Live Evil'and 1992's'Dehumanizer'and on most of Dio's solo  outings).Returning to the album:another great release from the then  resurrected Sabbath.Arguably a tad below'Heaven and Hell',but still solid.
0553573411|5.0|this book is a very rare thing it is a sequel witch is still as good as the original, fitz is now a teenager he is recovering from a sickness caused to him by his uncle Regal who's treachery nearly killed him but that  is not the end of it, he is returning to Buck from the mountain Kindomn...  this is all i will tell, i recommend this book to any who are willing to  open there mind and reach out and feel for the characters to bond with  them, as i have done the book is more enjoyed that way, read this book it  is worth it and there is always time for a good book such as this...
B0000027I6|4.0|An absolutely brilliant album from Roger Waters and the true follow up to Pink Floyd's 'The Final Cut'(1983),this is were the debate has shifted.Jeff Beck,far from trying to be a David Gilmour stand-in ,shines brightly with  innovative guitar work.Flawless and intelligent,this record demands the  inescapable conclusion that when Waters left the band,he took the Pink out  of Floyd.
1567407757|5.0|This book is the best book I have ever read.... If life could be learned as the old saying the young man learns from the old man as the old man learns from the young man , This is so very true. He was an exceptionaly  angelic person. I truley was inpired as all who should read this book  (love), the unconditional truth....
B000002A3T|3.0|Sounding more like a band effort than their previous 1987 offering,'The Division Bell'can be a satisfactory listening experience only if one pretends everithing is fine.But this is not the case here:again,the lyrical  themes are forced and repetitive,with no clear concern behind them[cf.'The  Dark Side of the Moon'(1973)or any following album up to 1983].On the  bright side,brilliant studio work and excellent album artwork.
B000002MM8|5.0|Dead Can Dance is the kind of music that I categorize with Enigma...you can play the CD and let your mind wander. You can imagine yourself taking part in the music.<br />Tracks like &quot;The Ubiquitous Mr. Lovegrove&quot;,  with the languid, tribal-style beats nearly compel one to be mellow.   &quot;The Carnival is Over&quot; and &quot;Ariadne&quot; I consider one  track because of &quot;Carnival&quot;'s seamless flow into  &quot;Ariadne&quot;.  <br />This CD is a musical journey into another  world...if you're looking for something different, eclectic, unusual, try  &quot;Into The Labyrinth&quot;.
6304057709|5.0|The story of the strong though opposite Dashwood sisters resonates strongly with women of all generations. Strangely, I appreciated this movie even more after reading the incredible book because of how wonderfully the  characters are brought to life. Winslet and Thompson are perfect in their  respective roles, showing the faults of being entirely sensible (Elinor)  and overly emotional (Marianne). These female characters are some of the  strongest ever written and I am grateful to the cast and Ang Lee for  bringing them to film in an age where women are increasingly portrayed as  objects.
B00003XB8K|5.0|I'm a newcomer to Enigma, other than hearing their first &quot;hit&quot; back in the early 90's. Seeing them show up on various &quot;Mood Reflections&quot;-type compilations on TV alongside John Tesh and Yanni  forced me to stay away from them until I happened upon this new CD. Moody,  mid-tempo and seductive from beginning to end, this is no &quot;muzak&quot;  stuff this time around, and the heavy dance beats and monkish chanting of  Enigma's past efforts have mostly been put out to pasture. Probably the  best CD I've heard so far this year (next to the new Sneaker Pimps). If you  want an album to sink into on a dark night, where beautiful melodies and  slinky, understated dance rhythms swirl around you for 43 minutes, then  this is it. Excellent!
B000021Y77|5.0|Completely absorbing and hypnotising; this is the single best movie I have ever seen.
B000001DTM|5.0|I love this album. It was the first one I bought by U2 and it is my favorite. The only album I think that is better all time by any band is The Fragile by Nine Inch Nails but this is a close second. I think this album  is great because there is so many styles in it. There is dance, funk, pop,  and rock all combined into it. I definitly think this is a worthwhile album  to buy.
0784010188|5.0|The first Terminator - sent through time to destroy Sarah Connor - has failed. But the nightmare future portrayed in T1 remains to haunt the present. 10 years after the events in T1 a cyborg built of a mimetic poly -  alloy (liquid metal) is sent back through time to destroy the child John  Connor. <br />A reprogrammed T-800 is also sent back, with a neat twist in  plot to spice things up. Some stunning action scenes mark the battles  between the two near - indestructible opponents, but this is not all there  is to the movie. Indeed Robert Patrick's T-1000 character drops out  completely for a third of the movie, a time in which the director draws the  attention of the audience to some of the larger issues through dreams and  revelations between the characters. The themes concerning fate, technology,  and what it is to be &quot;alive&quot; are certainly near as big as themes  can get. <br />The T-800, which to some viewers has apparently appeared  warm/fuzzy is in fact no such thing, and there are many scenes - many! -  where the sheer coldness of its nature and single minded pursuit of its  goal to protect its target are exposed for the simple programming that they  are. There is no &quot;love&quot; or dedication in the human sense,  although the cyborg learns new persepctives through its travels,  culminating in a surprisingly emotional scene at the close. <br />As often  mentioned, the snake-like, liquid metal adversary is a masterpiece both of  acting and special effects, and ushered in a new era in computer graphics.  Although not as dark as the predecessor, this film was certainly prettier,  and explored a wide range both of film styles and themes. <br />Very cool.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Amazing. That's the most suitable word that describes this masterpiece. The only two albums that I think are better are The Fragile by NIN and Achtung Baby by U2. I loved this cd from the very first listen and  everytime I listen to it seems to get better.<br />I think anyone who loves  music will appreciate this album. The first time you here this album is  should be through headphones.
B000000183|5.0|I have never heard a finer Sonny Rollins record than this one. On S:t Thomas he plays one of the very finest jazz solos of all times. He has great support by his sidemen, most notably the great Max Roach, who plays  the finest, most imaginative, drum solo I have ever heard. The rest of the  record is also first class. If you dont have this record, then you know  what to do.
0440219078|5.0|I absolutely loved this book! i haven't read anything by Lois Lowry since i was a pre-teen and i am so glad to have revisited her! This is a phenominal story of a boy's journey and growth. In a community based on sameness he has the courage to break free and make a difference, although  he has to abandon everything he has ever known. it's amazing, it appealed  to my science-fiction side as well as the side that loves a good,  interesting story about humanity.  The book isn't a lesson, it's a  journey... almost like the memories the protagonist receives. This is must  read, contemporary classic, if there is such a catagory!  Enjoy. (PS- does  anyone know if there is a sequel?)
0385484518|4.0|Tuesdays With Morrie is a wonderful book. A dying man had a chance to share the voice of his soul, and millions can benefit from it. Morrie's views on death, relationships, and the world will make you reconsider your  entire life.

0385484518|5.0|When we get caught up in our busy work lives, we neglect the fundamental aspects of love, compassion and giving that should always been in the forefront of our thoughts.  Morrie teaches how to always keep these  thoughts where they belong leading to a more meaningful and enjoyable life.
B00000I14Z|5.0|Every tune on this album, one of the few which the composer recorded for Columbia in the early 60s, is a classic, from the opening exhuberant chaos of &quot;Better Get It Your Soul&quot; to the mourful &quot;Goodbye Pork  Pie Hat&quot; to the bitingly satrical &quot;Fables of Faubus,&quot; a  subtle polemic directed against Gov. Orval E. Faubus, the infamous opponent  of integration.  Mingus's compositional skills and power as a bandleader  really shine here, and performances by both the bassist and his slew of  talented artists like Jimmy Knepper. Dannie richmond, Don Butterfield et  al. make this record into one of Mingus's best.  For those unfamiliar with  Mingus's work, this is a great place to start, but is also a must-have for  the dedicated fan.
B00000IWVS|5.0|This recording captures the very young yet already technically astounding Martha Argerich playing her signature composer. You will not find a better Chopin interpreter alive - only Maurizio Pollini comes close - and in this  CD she is at her energetic best. The Deutsche Grammophon &quot;Debut  Recording&quot; looks pale by comparison. Both the sound and the  performance here are better. Great rendition of the Sonata.
B000031XCR|5.0|This album is a must-have for any music fan.  Although Celine gets knocked by a lot of critics (that's why they're called critics, after all), these songs demonstrate beyond a reasonable doubt that she is the Barbra  Streisand of her generation.  She makes you laugh, she makes you cry, she  makes you smile-- I don't know what else one could want from a CD.  All I'm  saying is give her a chance, listen with an open mind and an open heart.
B000002G85|5.0|Clapton's solo debut album is some of the best music of his 70's career. This album includes many EC classics which later became staples of his live performances. Get this one along with Layla and Slowhand for the best of  Clapton in the 70's.
B00000JPH5|4.0|This movie takes you by the hand and leads you out of the world of reality and into the Goblin King's dark and devious world where anything can and does happen. Mystical characters, twists at every turn and a path fraught with magical trickery and some danger. The Labyrinth is a magical mystery tour that can be enjoyed by old and young alike.
0930289331|5.0|This is, quite simply, the best Batman story ever told.  Miller, the definitive Batman writer, has crafted a story even better than his Dark Knight Returns.  Mazzucchelli turns in one of the most realistic and  beautiful renditions of Batman ever.  The coloring firmly grounds this  series in reality.  If you can only own one Batman story, this one must be  it.  I wish there was a rating better than 5 stars that I could give this  story.
6300214028|5.0|The film is realy good but the amazing thing is the way Beatty deals with the subject of the reds. I have never seen a american movie that manages to present the situation in both USA and Russia during the first world war in  a realistic way. Beatty actually managed to overcome the dogmatism of the  (unfortunatelly) conservative American society and show that it's excactlty  this dogmatism that is responsible for what's been going on in Russia as  well as in the USA for the last 70-80 years.

This text is superb, nearly flawless and I recomend it to anyone.  I feel the plot was consistent in keeping me intrigued and excited. I can't  find words to describe how brilliantly thought up the characters of Mark  Sway and Reggie Love are, apart from stunning. Marks somewhat laid back and  tough attitude is suprising yet we see evidence that prooves he is still a  child. Reggie is fantastic...cool, calm and collected she brought a real  feel of warmth and intelligence in to the text. Even though Momma Love  plays just a small part in the novel, her character was also deeply  touching, her warm lasagne and other food was mouth-watering for me as a  reader. Grisham is fantastic and I will most certainly read more of his  novels. Brilliant!
1878424114|4.0|I had this book for a year before I actually read it.  I was at first turned off by Deepaks New Agey speak, but then I started really enjoying it.  I especially liked the chapter on decision making.  I am guilty of  making a lot of decisions based on my ego (going after the job I think I  SHOULD have, but don't necessarily want) and this book has helped me to pay  more attentions to the decisions I'm making.  We make our own decisions, we  sometimes put ourselves in situations that we can tell are going to be bad  from a mile away, and then we have noone to blame but ourselves.  So it  pays off to act more deliberately and THINK about what we're doing.  That's  what I got out of the book, and it was worth it.  It's also kind of a nice  little book to read, savor, slow down, at the end of the day with and see  how far off or on track you are in life!  I don't consider myself  particularly spiritual but it's nice to have someone advocate taking the  time to slow down and think about what you're doing.
B00000J7JO|5.0|This is my 1st Pepper's album and hope it's not my last. I bought this on recommendation from my friend and it's fantastic! Around the World is great, so is Scar Tissue and Purple Stain is fun too. Parallel Universe is  cool, but my favourite song is DEFINATELY OtherSide. A wicked song with a  cool video, Anthony's vocals are fab. Well done, RHCP, you've found a new  fan in me!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|The Battle of Los Angeles is calm as a bomb, however calm that may be. Undoubtedly, one of the best albums of '99, Rage Against the Machine have extended both musically and lyrically from their previous two albums. I  went to go see a Rage concert at Allstate Arena. They are the best live  band I have ever seen. They possess a raw sound and bombastic energy unlike  any other. During the drumroll where de la Rocha explodes back into  screaming &quot;Testify&quot;, I happened to be standing in a higher part  of the arena. When it exploded into the chorus, I could just see the ocean  of people bathed in this bright white light jumping up and down with Zach  leaping around like a caged demon a stage. It is a sight that will forever  remain in my mind. Buy The Battle of Los Angeles. It is to Rage as  &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; was to Public Enemy.  Other rap/metal  bands should be ashamed.  Forget Limp Bizkit...this is the stuff rage is  made of.
B00001U0DP|3.0|Let's talk about the quality of the DVD itself - very good on most aspects of sound and picture quality. This was one of the first movies I played on my Dolby Digital sound system and was quite impressed with the technical  quality of this DVD which unfortunately is not always the case with  'foreign' language productions. The English dubbing is best avoided and  should only be used if you tire of reading the subtitles. <br />As to the  movie itself, cannot say much that has not already been said - after all  232 reviews at the time of writing! All I will add is Benigni is a genius  for coming up with a very visually pleasant concoction (the lights, shadows  and colors in the movie are excellent) of everything that is politically  correct, fashionable, maudlin, and marketable - and making it palatable to  a xenophobic Hollywood generation. Arezzo and Tuscany, a little boy to melt  your heart, romance and rain and steam rising from cobblestone streets, Jim  Carrey-isque like capers and WW II atrocities are just some of the  ingredients in the mixture. Nothing ever really jells or flows. A little  emotional tickle results with the little boy tugging at your heartstrings.  The scenes in the internment camp are sometimes so ludicrous, improbable  and so wild, you have the gas chamber sequences to remind you `Hey! We are  dealing with a serious situation here!' <br />The backdrop of the Holocaust is  an intriguing choice.  I personally prefer serious treatment of such  sensitive topics - where comedy finds expression, if any, in the fortitude  and wisdom of the characters experiencing the pain. A powerful script and a  strong acting performance should convey these transient and conflicting  emotions - w/o using painful visual inserts (almost as afterthoughts) from  the Holocaust. The script is undecided between comedy and severity and  Benigni as an actor fails to convey the duality of the fabricated  existence.  Benigni instead holds the audience hostage - with a poorattempt at comedy spread on a canvas of the Holocaust and making us feel a  mixed bag of emotions. Him being shot is a poor attempt at salvaging what  is obviously a very predictable ending.  I expected him to pop up from  behind the bushes with that silly grin on his face. <br />In conclusion, it  was an intriguing and novel attempt at recording a time and place in  history - and that is where lies the value of this movie.
B00000ILT0|5.0|this album helped kill glam rock by setting an impossibly high standard 4 others 2 follow. the songwriting is beyond great, the concept, while not a direct linear tie 2 a ziggy stardust, works better in a general outside  sense, and it will blow your speakers out. an interesting blend of music  which has no precedent. and it's too bad that the complete version is not  the version released just a couple of months ago; the true ziggy cd is  available only on import. the first of many guises 2 come.
0446525537|1.0|Having read The Notebook and Message in a Bottle, I was expecting Sparks to deliver another novel that would be equally captivating in storyline.  A Walk to Remember was a big disappoint for me, in the sense that it ended so  abruptly.  The opening of the story was intriguing, but the last 30 pages  seemed like an attempt to just quickly end the story.  For that reason, it  has left a taste of disappointment in my mouth.....
0679746048|4.0|Wow!  Often a tough one to read. Very descriptive and intense. Similar in style and intensity to a male memoir I just read: PERAMBULATIONS by C.S. BACK. Give that one a try if you liked this book!

IT HAS A POSITIVE MEANING TO IT.  GREAT SONG TO GET  UP AND DANCE TO. ALSO SING ALONG WITH.   THIS GREATEST HITS ALBUM IS BETTER  THEN HER LET'S TALK ABOUT LOVE CD. CELINE WENT OUT ON TOP.

6304509154|5.0|I first remember watching this movie when I was about 3 or 4, it came out when I was 1.....but ever since I've seen it, it's been my favorite movie of all time! I've watched it literally thousands of times. I could watch it  every day of my life and I would never get sick of it. It's so freaky to  put urself in the family's position, and think of what it might be like to  be in their situation! It's like no other horror movie. If ur thinking  about buying this movie and have never seen it before, don't worrying about  getting nothing for ur $$. it's well worth it and I can garuntee u'll love  it. There is not 1 person I know that doesn't like this movie. IT'S THE  BEST!
B00003XB8K|5.0|What a fun recording! If you already enjoy Enigma, then you won't be disappointed.  If you're not sure, this may sway you.  Along the lines of their earlier eclectic albums, Screen Behind the Mirror offers more of the  same flavor and strong moving pulse.  Overtones of Orff's Carmina Burana  float and sometimes break through the recognizable Enigma fare in an  unusual haunt.  Overall it's a great CD-I've listened to it five times  within 24 hours of receiving it and it still leaves me wanting more.  Good  job!
0553573411|5.0|This book is definitely the greatest book within the Farseer Trilogy - the first was too short, and the third became a bit far-fetched and strange at the end. This book really is brilliant and it DOES keep you turning the  pages - you find yourself really sympathising with Fitz and every thing he  suffers you suffer too - this may sound stupid, but it is true, and it is  all too rare in writing these days. The first-person perspective makes the  story-telling extremely personal, and especially at the end of this book  and the beginning of the next is the use of first-person perspective  brilliant. I cannot stress how great this book really is - it is an  unbelievable read, and although not Shakespeare, it is certainly a lot of  fun. Much deeper than Eddings and more captivating than Raymond E. Feist or  Tolkien, get this book now.
B000002IAZ|5.0|Buffalo Springfield, another one of those short lived talent mergers which brings the question to mind...what if? Although they were only together for 18 months they gave us three great albums. Everyone involved became a  talent in their own right, I think situations like this were meant to be,  getting a chance to hear the foundation and then eventually being fotunate  enough to experience the finished products in other super groups. For the  money and for what it's worth, this is a great CD from a great group of  musicians.
6303332609|4.0|I have't seen this movie in years but it is awesome!  It's so cheesy, but the klowns look awesome, they're so creepy looking! And the best part about the movie is that MR BUNGLE did all the background music.....Mr Bungle is  awesome, they have the most weird, creepy, circus music anyone could've  eveer written 8)
6304414145|3.0|Ransom really shows vivid scenes about how the kidnappers treat their victims.  I'll never forget the scene where Brawley Nolte, who plays Sean Mullen,is tied to the bed and gagged, and his parents must watch the  horrific image on their laptop.  The person who I felt the most sympathetic  towards in the movie was not Tom Mullen or his wife Kate (Mel Gibson and  Rene Russo).  It was Sean Mullen.  Good job, Brawley.
B00002Z88D|5.0|i would of never thought metallica with a symphony,what a great idea the song's sound so cool like it was meant to be.this 2 cd set is a must get. metallica is a trully talented band,no matter what anyone say's i'll  alway's know this.well if u don't add this double cd to your collection u r  simply missing out on grand music.one thing is for sure these guy's have a  gift &amp; it is music that is for sure.it show's in this cd set.happy  listening.
B000001FDI|5.0|When the LP was first released I ran out and bought it, when the CD was released I ran out and bought it. &quot;Can't Find My Way Home&quot; will forever stick in my mind, &quot;Well All Right&quot; should've gotten more  commercial exposure than it did. Overall a genuine piece of musical  history, and we the music buying public were lucky to have this compilation  of talents, even for a short period of time.
B000002LEU|5.0|This popular retrospective of Joy Division still sounds great even 20 years after the band's tragic ending.  Along with Wire, Gang of Four, Throbbing Gristle, Cab Voltaire, PIL and others, Joy Division helped forge  the noir underbelly of punk.  Many bands still capture their sound today,  even after the genre became cliche in the late eighties.  Even after scores  of lifetime listens, the songs 'Digital', 'She Lost Control, 'Leaders of  Men', and 'Love will Tear Us Apart' still get my heart racing.  Once I  heard their big hit 'Love will Tear Us Apart' in a taxicab in Mexico City.   Did it sound out of context in the gritty, carbon-hazed capital?  If you've  heard this; you know the answer.

B000000XB9|5.0|Just like the title states, 20 great songs. The first LP I purchased by CCR was &quot;Cosmos Factory&quot; back when it was first released, then eventually I picked up on the rest. This is a tremendous compilation of  their hits, but it is only 20 of them, I haven't gotten volume two yet but  judging by this disc I know I won't be disappointed when I do. Do yourself  a big favor, if you love CCR get your hands on this disc.
0385484518|5.0|This book held such a powerful impact on my own father.  His father, my grandfather, our family mentor was dying when my father read this book and suggested it to me.  That may not mean much to some people, but if anyone  knew that my father was the type of man who did not show a lot of emotion  on the exterior and worked constantly, they would understand.  I did read  this book upon his suggestion after the passing of my grandfather, and I  could not put it down.  It is people like Morrie that give  to the true  meaning of life.  I think that Mitch Albom did many people a favor by  writing this book.  It's his hard efforts and conversations with Morrie  that will continue to make people slow down and savor the relationships  they have with the mentors they have been blessed with in their lives.
B000000OA6|5.0|what can you expect of the best band in the world? ..well, if you never listened queen before you will love it...song like these are the days of our lifes or innuendo. only can be done by queen..and for those that love  queen like me, you will love it...please brian, roger, john, keep the show  must go on!  god save the queen!
B000002KBH|5.0|Whenever somebody asks for an intro to the Grateful Dead, this is one CD I lend.  It captures Hunter and Garcia at the peak of their songwriting.  Musically, it's the most accessible Dead album.<br />Garcia once said that  recording a studio album was like building a ship in a bottle, while  playing a show was like going out to sea in a rowboat.  American Beauty is  an exquisite ship-in-a-bottle.

0553210246|5.0|The story twists and turns and Hardy takes the reader on a journey exploring the hopes and shattered dreams of the book's central characters.<br />This is a masterpiece.<br />I, like many reviewers above, had  to study this text aged 16 for school exams.  At the time, I remeber  thinking that the long winded descriptions of the countryside irritated me.  Perhaps now, aged 28, I would appreciate this book more. I feel that those  who criticise it are entitled to do so - but the criticisms (if genuine)  ought to be more constructive than those above - which are just bitter and  inmature!<br />As a story, this is first class and a must. Read it and savour  it.
B0000009TJ|5.0|It's a cross between Bob Marley and Spike Jones. I'd rather hear it than Load [sic] Zepplin's pretentious noise any day. The big guitar solo near the end is played by the entire horn section in unison. You won't believe  it.
B000002TQV|5.0|I bought this album on the merits of &quot;Just&quot; and &quot;High and Dry&quot; - I thought I was taking a chance, but boy, did it pay off!  Those two songs and their videos were innovative and intriguing, but I  wasn't at all ready for the balance of the record to be so strong. Thom  Yorke's lyrics are almost never happy, but they are endlessly interesting,  and always (satisfyingly) just shy of satisfying.  His vocals are  captivating in their power and sincerity.  Jonny Greenwood's guitar rounds  out the reasons why &quot;The Bends&quot; is one of the freshest, sharpest  and, at times, most poignant rock records of them all.
B00002Z88D|2.0|Answer:  You got this album.  <br />I have been into heavy metal for about 18 years.  I have been into classical music for about 4 years.  When you mix them you basically have &quot;The Thing That Should Not Be&quot;.  <br />Metallica should have never mixed the classics from &quot;Ride the  Lightning&quot;, &quot;Masters of Puppets&quot;, etc. with an orchestra.   This creates an ugly mesh, where you hear the thunder of a guitar followed  by the gentleness of a violin.  <br />They should have wrote the entire album  based on new music, like &quot;No Leaf Clover&quot; (the reason for the two  stars and not just one).  <br />I know that the Moody Blues were able to mix  their hits with orchestra, but their music was more mellow and it blended  well.  Old Metallica songs border with what was called in the '80s thrash  metal.  <br />What happens with this album is that with many of the songs the  electric guitars overpower the orchestra.  It sounds as if it is more of a  competition, than a composition.

0375707972|2.0|I do not regularly get Oprah book club books - not to sound snotty, but what appeals to the masses in the literary sense does not usually speak to  me.  However, encouraged by my enuthusiasm for Wally Lamb and Jane  Hamilton, I read on. Ugh.  First the Pilot's Wife (atrocious) and then  this?   Oprah, come on.  Character driven books with no plot I can deal  with.  Plot driven books with no character are harder to deal with but  still carry SOME redeeming value.  Books which meander and look deep within  them for some sort of introspection which does not exist and then  ultimately do not lead you anywhere (and don't even throw you the bone of  having brilliant, delicate or delicious passages to revel in) is out of the  question. Certainly not as contrived as the Pilot's Wife - and since it  only takes about 2 hours to read, not as big a waste of time - but  certainly not worthy of effusive praise, either.
6303213650|5.0|I am sorry to say that this is my favourite film of all time - sorry, because it is a hard thing for someone who has such a various taste in books and music to have an absolute favourite in another medium...but this  little work of art is precisely that, with superb acting by Tim Robbins,  Jennifer Jason Leigh and Paul Newman, plus an excellent supporting cast. I  suppose I should worship the Coen brothers, whom I praise non-stop when  Fargo or the Big Lebowski are mentioned (the latter with a bit more  restraint).<br />But this film...it is different from anything else I have  seen. Although set in the 40's/50's, it does not really seem to have any  location in time or geography - just some American city, some foolish  genius, and some misguided corporate individuals. Kind of Monty Python  mixed with Shawshank Redemption, the Sting and Some Like It Hot mixed in  for good measure. If that means anything - enjoy!
6300182282|5.0|I have always been an Alan Alda fan (ever since MASH).When I first saw this movie, 16 years ago, I was impressed by the way it was set up: over a longer period of time. Also the emotions, portrayed (by both actors) were  so believable and the part where Alan Alda struggles to tell Ellen Bursteyn  about his son being killed, just about ripped my heart out. I do not  condone adultery, but this play/movie has the class that seems to come  natural for Alan Alda. This is the first video that I have bought for  myself - it is worth owning!
014028009X|5.0|I could not put this down and kept saying to myself: &quot;I am soooo Bridget!&quot;.  Then I settled down, got attached and am even thinking about getting a puppy - so now I delve into every once in a while to remind  me about &quot;single life&quot;!  Seriously, though, this is a funny,  quick, lighthearted and ultimately friendly read.  Readers will either want  to hug Bridget or strangle Bridget.  Either way, you'll have an opinion and  have a rollicking good time forming it!
0060977493|3.0|It is impossible to be objective about a novel, especially one such as this - a highly personal experience. The experience is in the dialogue between the writer and the reader, and Roy, communicating (for most of the  novel) through the vulnerable experiences and private jokes of children,  reaches into your most personal areas (wherever they may be), and then  channels into them her ideas and tales. For this reason, it is a  (rewardingly) difficult novel, both in the content and style. It is also,  for this reason, a very different experience for many people - more so than  most novels.<br />The consensus is, apparently, that this is an excellent  novel; I bought it because it was a popular book. But I did not  particularly enjoy it. I understand what she is trying to say. I do not in  any way claim to know WHY, though she seems to me a painfully and  beautifully constructed personality, with many things to say to a world  that wishes to listen. That is great, and I can see why this novel is so  inspirational to people - it offers, not a truth, but a vision of a world  that has beauty and ugliness in equal measure...usually in the same  place.<br />Yet I struggled because...well, simply because it did not provoke  me. It did not elicit much of an emotional response, and I began to find  the style annoying after a while. That is, I believe, no one's fault. Then  again, I think that Roy has the potential to write another novel which I  would like - so though it is nothing to do with her, it is perhaps  something to do with the novel...I sincerely doubt that the  &quot;style&quot; here is her &quot;style&quot;, and am sure she is pretty  darn flexible.<br />Reviews that complain about inaccessibility might well be  coming from the same place as I am - but I hope that I did not miss the  point, so much as did not see why the point needed to be got. The dialogue  was not instructive, not inspirational for me...it was almost, if at times  thrilling and moving, often quite boring and frustrating. If that seems to  be a sign of a lazy reader, fine. But James Joyce's Portrait of a Young  Artist is another novel where poetry and prose have no definable  boundary...and THAT...well - that is not an inspiration so much as a  life-experience.<br />I look forward to Roy's next  novel.<br />mrovich1@hotmail.comte boring and frustrating.

B00000DHRZ|5.0|Since the very first Offspring album Self Titled that was released in 1989 the Offspring has shaped the punk rock music industry. Americana which was mostly took from my terms as a statement of what is wrong with America.  From the first track which has a sort of Voice Mail sound to it and then  the kicking in of Dexter and NooDlEs guitars as well as Greg K's bass and  Ron's drums on &quot;Have You Ever?&quot; you know that this is going to be  one to keep 4 Ever. The album spawned 4 singles and looks as if MTV  teenyboppers who can't keep the BOY BANDS off the air have finally made it  to where no real talent such as The Ofspring can't be displayed. For a band  that has been rolling for 16 years the following still continues to ever  grow.<br />If you like Americana buy em all...theres not a throw away in the  bunch! Also check out the Americana home video!
B000003S0I|5.0|Simply, one of the top prog records of all time.  Hard to get into at first, but every listen penetrates your soul until you get fully addicted to one of the most gifted and original rocK groups of all time.  Specially  interesting to guitarrists, bassists and drummers. This line up can hardly  be any better in creativity and chops. Also recommended: Red, Starless and  Bible Black, and Discipline studio Cd's.  There is also a recent wonderful  live compilation called Cirkus.

Without their voices sounding so good I doubt they would have had much impact, no matter how creative they were. Interestingly, in  Sgt.

6304078145|4.0|When I first rented this movie, I really had no idea what it was about. Again, I had rented it for the sake of my favorite actress, Lili Taylor. (see my &quot;Household Saints&quot; review..) I watched it, and thought,  &quot;Well, this isn't TOO bad!&quot; And really, it was fine. Some of the  segments were funny, and there were some parts I could've lived without.  This movie was equipped with a good cast, and had it's funny moments... but  it wasn't really all that good. Of course, Lili Taylor did a great job, and  so did the rest. It was *okay*

If you are appreciative of great cinematography you  must own a copy of this film.  For me, only John Ford's &quot;The  Searchers&quot; is as visually powerful.  The battle scenes are justifiably  legendary and possess that innate Japanese sense of poetry that permeates  just about everything else Kurasowa has done.
6304071906|5.0|I was on location at Two Medicine Lake (Glacer National Park)Montana in June 1979 while on vacation there during the filming. After the film was released I saw it the first week in NYC .It was so long there was an  intermission midway in the film. But it was interesting enough that the  almost four hours went by without being bored.<br />  A few years later I seen  the two hour version and I think it would have gotten better reviews by  movie critics because of a different ending.<br /> Cimino also filmed  Thunderbolt and Lightfoot with Clint Eastwood in Montana . I have  pre-ordered the DVD version of Heavens Gate and it will be interesting to  see how it is edited.
0312853238|5.0|I've now bought Ender's Game 5 times, since I first read it years ago.  Other copies have been permanently borrowed or lost in moves.  I will always ensure I have a copy in my library.<br />The story is timeless and  pulls the reader in, as a young boy is taught and trained, in the name of  Earth's defence and survival, to win at all cost and destroy an enemy;  known as the 'Buggers'.<br />Ender is separated from his family at an early  age and brought to a battle school, located in a space station.  <br />His  skills as a thinking warrior, who doesn't just win against an enemy, but  destroys the enemy during an initial confrontation, is recognized by the  International Fleet, and is cultavated through both battle games and  personal isolation purposely caused by the instructors.  <br />Ender grows as  a warrior and leader, but is internally conflicted as the pressures from  the battle school weigh heavy on his psyche.  He is a boy, expected to act  as Julius Ceaser, Napoleaon and Alexander The Great.  He loves and respects  life, but knows he is expected to cause total genocide on earth's current  enemy; the Buggers.
B000002X4T|5.0|Yeah, so maybe the JA's politics are dated; So are the Clash's, so are Ted Nugent's and in 20 years, Ani DiFranco's will be, too. It happens! What isn't dated is the music, especially the two songs by Grace Slick.  &quot;Eskimo Blue Day&quot; and &quot;Hey Frederick&quot; are the Airplane  at their most majestic and Slick at her most primal, with bassist Jack  Casady especially standing out like a stone leviathan. Elsewhere, Jorma  Kaukaunen's take on the traditional &quot;Good Shepard&quot; foreshadows  his later Hot Tuna and solo work, Marty Balin briefly surfaces from his  dissaffection with the band to help propel  &quot;Turn My Life Down&quot;  along and drummer Spencer Dryden probably has the best summation of how the  wind was blowing for Sixties rock in his &quot;Song For All Seasons.&quot;  If you let the political rants of a bygone era prevent you from listening  to this vibrant, strong album, hey, your loss!
0440211727|2.0|The story does a good job of highlighting racial relation in the American Deep South, but that is about the only thing it does. Rather slow, it certainly did not hold my interest for very long. The best thing I can say  about it was that the characters were more believable, not as cliched and  certainly less hateful than in subsequent Grisham books.
B00000JGEI|5.0|This is simply a brilliant sci-fi/action epic. Schwarzenegger is brilliant, Linda Hamilton plays a good part, Edward Furlong did an impressive performance and Robert Patrick was simply a cool headed villian.  Better than the first, this film has my full blessing.
B00000I8BX|1.0|This album is mindless. It has no focus, no point, and most importantly no talent. The lead singer is capable of carrying a tune, but rarely does. Screaming the ENTIRE time does not make for very engaging listening. Also,  the music itself is incredibly repetitive. Half the songs sound just like  the one before. Yes this album is very heavy, but no it is not good just  for that reason. I could make a heavy metal album by screeching away on a  guitar even though I have no talent at it, but it wouldn't be a good album.  This cd is devoid of any solos, due to the fact that they're probably  incapable of it. My point in all this is, AVOID THIS ALBUM. The only reason  anyone's even heard of these guys is cause of the Korn Family Values tour.  Oh yeah and maybe because of the bland Cars remake that's on the credit  card commercials......
B000022TSV|5.0|The music is wonderful and it looks just GREAT. No opera was ever filmed better than this. When I saw the movie originally in London, I had to  make a 400 mile round trip and it was worth all those hours and then some.
B00002MZ2C|3.0|THIS CD WASNT AS GOOD AS THE PREVIOUS RAGE AGAINST THE MACHINES BUT IT'S ALRIGHT. EVIL EMPIRE IS THE BEST RAGE THAN THEIR SELF TITLED ALBUM IS THE SECOND BEST AND THIS IS THEIR WORST. THE BEST SONGS ON THIS ARE: TESTIFY,  GUERILLA RADIO, CALM LIKE A BOMB, AND WAR WITHIN A BREATH. IF YOUR LOOKING  FOR QUALITY RAGE BUY EVIL EMPIRE!
B000031WD9|5.0|I received the unrated version of American Pie as a gift from my cousin.  Just by looking at the back of the DVD case, I was expecting almost a 'director's cut' of the film.  After watching the movie a few times now, I  can't really say that the Unrated version is any better than the generic  version which was seen in theaters.  About the only changes that I myself  noticed were the position of Jason Biggs as he umm...has fun with the pie.   The other noticeable inclusion is the explicit pictures in the 'Sex Bible',  other than that, I didn't see any huge changes.  That doesn't mean the  Unrated version is a total failure though, the rated and unrated versions  are roughly the same price, so one might as well get this over the  original.  Additonally, the movie itself is a blast to watch, especially  with a group of friends.  It does a decent job of portraying the high  school life, although it does exaggerate some characters (which benefited  the movie) like Stifler and the entire band people.  If there were any  other notes about the movie, one could say that it defines the 90's  teenager.  Acting performances are above average and one shouldn't be  disappointed by any of the actors...especially Biggs, whose portrayal of a  typical teen is dead on.  If I had one comment about the presentation of  the DVD itself, it seems somewhat cheesy.  The interface, although  including many different features seems clunky and unpolished.  Other than  that minor gripe, go pick this up, you should be well satisfied by this  brilliantly funny movie.
0451191935|4.0|These are 4 books that range in quality from moderately good to great. I heard SK (or RB) wrote running man in two days. It was so action - packed, it took me about as long to read it. That's gotta be my favorite(and if you  saw that Swarzeneggar movie and think you know the story, you're wrong, the  book is totallydifferent). Its also got some good ideas about class  distinctions between rich and poor and is good Sci - Fi, futuristic tale.  - - - - - &quot;The Long Walk&quot; is really good too, disturbing also.  &quot;Rage&quot; and &quot;Roadwork&quot; are OK, luckily they end before  they get too boring.
B0000399WI|5.0|This film is truly amazing.  It really shows the ability of the human spirit.  Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman are flawlessly cast together as true friends and depict real kindred spirits.<br />The movie is full of rich  detail and sound in every scene, it's guaranteed to encompass your  attention.  Very few movies have a plot as deep, emotional, and  thought-provoking as The Shawshank Redemption.  I recommend this film to  any movie buff who can &quot;truly understand&quot; a film's true  meaning.<br />The DVD portrayal is excellent.  With sharp picture quality and  intense sound, especially on a Dolby Digital 5.1 system, this movie is a  definate &quot;must have&quot; for any movie lover.
6305657939|5.0|If you like films chalked full of steamy romance amd intrigue this film is for you! The story follows a wealthy business man/amateur art thief(Brosnan) who has nothing better to do than tackle his latest  challange, whether it be a painting worth 100,000,000 dollars, or a sexy  female bounty hunter (Russo) determined to get her man.  The best part of  the film is its twists, which are guarenteed to give you an ending you  won't be expecting! Can a woman trust a theif?  It isn't an Academy Award  Winner, but for entertainment it is a spicy must see!
B00000IPAX|5.0|Blink 182's enema of the state is their best yet others like budda, casheire cat, and dude ranch were all great albums but this is the best one. This CD(which already has 2 big hits) could have 12 hits. My favorites  are &quot;Dysentary Gary&quot; and &quot;Anthem&quot;. But really I like  them all. So please go out there and buy the new Blink 182 CD.
0684800713|1.0|The book, The Sun Also Rises is not the best book ever written nor is worth reading unless you can handle boring drunks talking about one mans inabillity to &quot;get it up&quot;
B000002AP1|5.0|Iggy and the Stooges's third album is a work of art.  Each song is a masterpiece, especially the war-themed &quot;Search and Destroy&quot;. Raw Power is still raw and fresh today and I would recommend  this album as a  must to everyone.
B00002EPJH|4.0|Beautiful standards and ballads performed with warmth and feeling,but all at such a s-l-o-w tempo as to be positively funereal.Great to unwind to,but stuck in low gear.There's little fire here.but it's a nice,easy listen.
B000001ES9|3.0|Before Neil Peart entered the Rush scene this album was released. It's not as good as all the other early Rush music, but it still has got some really solid songs. The only thing absent is Neil's excellent drumming and Neil's  beautiful song writing. The guitar and bass are amazing on this Cd. The  drumming isn't bad, but Neil is much better.
B000002UAU|5.0|Without a doubt one of the best albums ever made.  When you think it was written over 30 years, that just makes it more astonishing.  The Beatles completely redefined music as the world knew it, and did so with incredible  creativity and musical genious.  As a band, their talent is  unparalled.<br />The songs on Sgt. Pepper's are mostly experimental and pop;  if you're looking for gritty Rock 'n Roll, try Exile On Main Street by The  Stones.  <br />The album starts of with the title cut, which has has a fresh  and energetic sound.  With a Little Help From My Friends continues in the  same fashion.  <br />Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds is a really cool song, but  the one on the cd isn't as as good as other ones I've heard.  Make no  mistake, the sounds is flawless, but the first time I ever heard this song  was on vinyl and compared to that, this version is inferior.  The  distortion on John's voice seems weaker, and detracts from the weird  atmosphere so perfectly created by the song. <br />Paul then has a couple more  good songs with Getting Better, and Fixing A Hole.  It's kind of senseless  to go on.  All the songs are excellent and if you don't have this album  yet, you're missing out.
B000001ESF|5.0|Before hearing this Cd, I hated Rush. 2112 changed my views on them completly. Not only is 2112 (the song) good, but all the other songs are also really good. My all time favorite Rush song is Something for Nothing,  which has some beautiful guitar work. Even if you don't like Geddy Lee's  singing, you will love this masterpiece.
B00001W9G0|3.0|Watching this film again after 10 years reminded me of why I hadn't seen it in so long: the story is not that good.  I never understood why they broke up, until I saw the additional footage provided in this DVD.  While  it's great that the additional footage is available, I don't understand why  they buried it in the documentary.  They should have included the extra  scenes in their entirety and made them accesible via the menu.<br />The best  part of this movie:  Streisand's brilliant performance.  As for Redford, I  seem to have trouble reading him in a number of scenes.<br />In short, if you  like Streisand, you must have this.
B00000JCB2|5.0|I LOVED this CD!  it rules so much! you have to go buy it now if oyu like real rock muzak!
B00002Z88D|4.0|Don't let anyone tell you that Metallica has lost it.  This CD Kicks *ss!  Front to back, this Metallica infused with orchestra is incredible.  It is so different from what you normally hear in rock music, you will be amazed.   Obviously, the lack of a whole lot of fresh material is a little  disappointing, but the sound itself is fresh.  The incredible power of  S&amp;M makes up for it.  They've taken some of their best songs and  transformed them into something new.  Even though I have every Metallica  CD, I can listen to S&amp;M over and over.  The symphany adds a richness to  the music and doesn't compromise the metal in the least.  In other words,  it's not just a rehash.  The only song I don't think turned out so well was  &quot;Nothing Else Matters,&quot; but other than that they did a great job.   The plucking of the stringed instruments in &quot;The Thing that Should  Not Be&quot; makes the song even creepier than it was originally, and  because it was a live performance the songs are filled with a kind of  energy you can only get from a concert.  And if you've ever seen Metallica  live, you'll know what I'm talking about.
B00000J7SO|5.0|yes! very good, thisa! very good! i love thisa america, good, very good you find opportunity land job land of opportuneitgy. yes yummy yum yum buy thisa layaye
088708026X|5.0|My daughter's Kindergarten teacher recommended this book because it seems the kids really take to it. My daughter, who is 4, said it's a really, really funny book. I personally love the large format of the hardback  edition, because the foldout ladder after all has to be very big, to reach  the moon.
B000031XCR|4.0|Actually i want to give this cd album for 3 and a half stars but i think i rather put 4 stars. This album was not really bad and i loved it. I do not really enjoy 2 songs out of 16 songs. Especially 'The First Time I Ever Saw  Your Face' and 'Live'. I loved all of the songs indeed. The song 'All The  Way' that was written on 1955 and renewed is not really bad. I will give  the 'All The Way' song 2 stars indeed.     You're not gonna regret to  purchase or hear this album. Get it and sit down relax hearing it...enjoy~!
6300182770|5.0|Granted this movie is definately not everyones cup of tea.But for those into wierdness like yours truly this movie really fits the  bill.James Woods and Debra Harry(remember when it used to be Debbie Harry?) gave a  screen performance as lovers that makes one wonder if maybe something  wasn't also going on backstage. Even if there wasn't it makes for wonderful  fantasy thoughts!I will admit that as a male fasinated with Debra Harry  this movie is a perfect vehicle for alot of my fantasies about her.But  getting back to the movie,it has alot of fine actors and although the plot  may seem a little silly the special effects for back then(check out the  really old VCR player in James Woods place if you didn't bother to see when  this movie was made) were really pretty well done for such a low budget  film.Of course there is lots of gore for all of us horror film fans-does  this suprise any hardcore Cronenberg fans out there?Anyway i have one copy  already that is very old and is starting to show the effects of watching  over and over and over again so i am ordering this re-release.Remember, if  you scare or gross out easily watch this movie with a friend or at the  least the lights on!<br />since the original review criterion has put out a double dvd version which i purchased. it has several more extras in it approved by david cronenberg including \\"forging the flesh\\" a documentary featurette,the complete footage of \\"samurai Dreams\\",david cronenberg made his own short soft porn movie for \\"videodrome\\" and the extra's dvd shows you that movie in its entirety(just for those that were disappointed in the shorter version in the film).the dvd and sound quality is much better,it is just another dvd put out by the criterion collection that i though was worth the purchase price.
0684872153|2.0|Although McCourt is a gifted writer, and I did enjoy many sections of the book, I found it too depressing with few redeeming qualities. As a Catholic growing up in the 1950's, I could identify with the numerous occasions of sin he portrayed.  However, the ending was flat - and unrealistic.  It  seemed as if Mr. McCourt got bored with all the misery and body fluids and  just wanted it over.  The title has no relevance to anything in the book -  &quot;Angela's Ashes&quot; appears to refer to his Mother, whom he left  alive and well in Ireland and not deceased.  I shall be more cautious about  running out to buy any of Oprah's Book Club Selections.
B000005ILF|5.0|This was actually the first cd I bought of his, and it still gets play even in my busy dorm at college.  This album begins and ends with &quot;Mercury Falling,&quot; which I found to be quite  intriguing.<br />Sometimes Sting stretches belief, as with songs like &quot;I  Hung My Head,&quot; which lives up to its name quite well, but this album  is fantastic.  &quot;La Belle Dame Sans Regrets&quot; almost makes me want  to learn French so I can understand the lyrics.  &quot;I'm So Happy I Can't  Stop Crying&quot; is one of my favorite songs ever, and &quot;Let Your Soul  Be Your Pilot&quot; and &quot;You Still Touch Me&quot; are outstanding as  well, as is &quot;The Hounds of Winter&quot; and &quot;I Was Brought To My  Senses.&quot;<br />If you like mellow music to enjoy during a snowy day or a  rainy day or you are feeling down, this album is great.  Commiserate with  me and all of the other sad and melancholy souls who seek solace in his  well-crafted verses of heartache and sorrow.  It's well worth it.
6305426651|5.0|La Vita e Bella, once an arthouse release, and now a mainstream success due to the many acadamy awards of last year, is the most IMPORTANT film I have ever seen. To view it in its dubbed-into-english version is an sinsult  to all involved, so ensure you get the subtitled italian original. a film  that starts out as a light comedy with enchanting lines ensured to become a  classic ('bongiorno principessa!') and gradually grows darker and deeper  until its deeply moving, tragic and yet stikingly beautiful conclusion. it  is honestly the only film that ever changed me, made me want to be a better  person. as trite as it sounds, it is honest. breathtaking. perfect.  amusing. tragic. bella. i adored it. if you can't afford it, at least rent  it. you will be changed.
0375707972|1.0|This book has large type and is very short, and yet I almost did not take the time to finish it.  It is as satisfying as Bridges of Madison County, another Oprah book, which is to say, not very satisfying.  The main  character falls in and out of relationships with extremely scanty character  or plot development.  This becomes quite evident from the beginning when  the 15 year old boy and &quot;woman twice his age&quot; fall into bed  together, without exchanging hardly a word. You would feel just as  connected to a stranger who tells you his or her life story in 3 minutes or  less.  I never learned enough to care about any of the characters, and only  finished the book because it is short.
B000001G16|5.0|Richie Sambora's first solo effort is excellent!Songs like &quot;Stranger in this town&quot; and &quot;Ballad of Youth&quot; show Richie's guitar talents along with great vocals. Not only is this filled with great music,  the words are beautiful and songs like &quot;One light Burning&quot; catch  your ear and heart!  This CD along with his second solo effort insipred  me..thank-you Richie!
6302597544|5.0|Well, what can you say ?  This is an absolute belter of a performance which really captures the experience of being there. I'm surprised I've not worn the video out by now as I've had it since it came out in about 1991.  FANTASTIC and all fans of great stadium in your face rock should buy it  immediately.
B000002KIT|5.0|If you want the best LIVE, DOWN &amp; DIRTY album of all time, it's a toss-up: this one by Lizzy or &quot;Get Yer Ya-Ya's Out.&quot; But why choose? I'll take three copies of each!
6304298285|5.0|It is one of the few movies that I can watch over and over and never get tired of. Robin Willams does an excellent job of being a kid in an adult body.  In response to the reviewer that referred to this movie as offensive  to the children who actually have this disease - get a life!  This movie  shows not only the fun he had but also the challenge of fitting in and the  desire to be just a &quot;normal star&quot;.  If anything, this movie shows  children with this disease, their possibilities and not their limitations.  To the offended reviewer, watch the movie again not only with your eyes but  with your heart.
0517201658|5.0|This novel is one of tragedy, romance, and the undaunting human spirit.  It is a richly woven tale somewhat reminiscint of 'A Tree Grows In Brooklyn'.  Set in the Australian outback, it follows the Cleary family  through drought, flood and death, focusing mainly on the lone daughter,  Meggie.  Meggie falls in love with a Catholic priest, who in turn must  reject her or risk breaking his vows.  It is a must-read for anyone  interested in Australia, for it offers a behind-the-scenes look at the true  Outback life from the 1920's right up through the 60's.  I loved this book.

0425129586|5.0|Another great by Agatha Christie!  Now I can understand why she is considered to be one of the literary greats of the 20th century.  This book is a perfect mix of sadness, intrigue, and mystery.  Once again Christie's  wild twists and turns captivates the audience.  Never a dull moment in this  book!
0385486804|3.0|I read this book and was totally fascinated. This book to me, is an allegory for the fallenness of the world. I do not believe the author ever intended this conclusion. However, one cannot read this from a Christian  perspective and not feel pity for this talented man who never really found  what he was looking for. No matter how great his resignation at the end, I  feel Chris' fervor was misplaced and his potential unused. What a tragedy.
B000002C1W|4.0|I've read some of the reviews on Floyd albums without Roger and most of them say that they aren't worth buying.  They say David's lyrics aren't good and the music doesn't sound like the old &quot;Pink Floyd&quot;.  If a  band can last this long, the music is probably going to change, and without  David Gilmour this band wouldn't have been the same.  He's been making most  of the Floyd music since the beginning.  And I think his lyrics are great.   On the Turning Away and Learning to Fly have great lyrics on this cd.   Don't take this the wrong way, I love Roger Waters and I still wish he was  a part of The Floyd, but all you so called Floyd fans who put down David  Gilmour ask yourself, what would pink floyd be without David Gilmour.
0140434259|3.0|I have had the pleasure now of having read a great deal of Austen's works. She had a knack for depicting human nature in a very skillful and entertaining manner. My one regret in my reading of Austen is that I  started with this book. This book is skillfully written, with lush  language. My problem is that the ending is so surreal and sudden. I do  recommend this book; but not for beginners. If you are only starting with  Austen, read Persuasion or Emma first.
0385495315|5.0|I received this book as a Christmas present, and had nearly finished it before the sun set Chirstmas Day.  Though I have only completed two of the ciphers Mr. Singh includes in the competition he sponsors, deciphering the  codes helped me understand better the mindsets of those he describes, and  the analyses he forwards.
6304539258|5.0|I have loved this movie since I was a small child, and even though I have grown older and times have changed, I still love this movie. It is the ultimate fairy tale retelling, with bad vs. good-- and characters you can  really care about (unlike most of today's action movies--has anyone seen  Godzilla? ). I also have to give major credit to this movie for being one  of the first to include a really strong, positive role model for girls in  an action movie. Princess Leia was one of the first female characters who  didn't just sit there and let everyone else rescue her. You go girl! I  enjoyed the extra scenes in the special edition, especially the one between  Luke and Biggs at the end. It really made me realize those weren't just  pilots they lost in the final battle, they were friends. A[...] I  liked that. This is an amazing movie, and if your kids haven't seen it,  then you're not raising them right! No, I'm just kidding! :-) May the force  be with you!
B000002LBH|5.0|This album was my first intro to The Smiths..  I'll admit it took some getting used to at first, but after a few listens you will be enchanted by the brilliant lyrics, morrissey's haunting vocals, and the great musicians in this group.  Also this album demonstrates how creative and spread out The Smiths are.  If you give the smiths a chance you will love them.
6305426651|2.0|This movie was alright, but it is by no means as good as everyone says it is. I didn't think it was funny at all, and it was unrealistic. I mean, in the real holocaust, little kids knew they were in an awful place. There is  no way that one of them would thought it was just a &quot;game&quot;. The  movie made the holocaust seem like nothing. I mean, if a Nazi was gonna  shoot a prisoner, he would just do it, he wouldn't take the guy to a  deserted corner to do it, like they did with this movie. If you wanna see a  funny movie, watch Ferris Bueller's Day Off. If you wanna see a REALLY good  movie, go see The Godfather, Lawrence of Arabia, Spartucus, To Kill a  Mockingbird, Shadow of Dought, Ran(or any other film by Akira Kurosawa or  whatever his name was)etc., etc.
0451160916|3.0|Although the concept was good, the content just didn't seem to do it justice.  There were times that when I was reading, I just wanted to fall asleep.  However, I did always wonder what was going to happen next.

0449227545|5.0|This is my first novel I have read of Follett and is absolutely THE best thriller I have ever read. The plot is absolutely flawless, there is no filler, something happens in every chapter that advances the plot.  The  characters are so real. I can't believe some of these reviews, these people  obviously don't like thrillers... let them read the so called NOVELs that  Grisham is putting out now... he forgot how to write a thriller...
044022165X|5.0|Grisham is just awesome at getting his audience to root for the protaganist ... Patrick from The Partner, Darby from Pelican Brief, Mitch McDere from The Firm: these are the characters whom I've played novel after  novel, ducking into malls, avoiding tails by the FBI or the Mafia, battling  grueling trials and struggling to pass the bar ... these guys add adventure  and realistic obstacles to an otherwise boring and banal reality, pre-  professional school! And now Rudy Baylor! This kid introduces the element  of revenge for a society against him, and plays it off beautifully with the  hint that we can make it even without the proverbial lucky break!<br />The  book is awesome! It winds itself up for the pitch with the introduction of  a world packed with competition and lack of sympathy for those crushed  under the heel of capitalism, i.e. said graduate of Memphis State Law  School, our friend Rudy! Then he meets the people who will be the unknowing  stepping stone out of hardship, and into a pot of respect so profound it'll  disorient the young rookie! He plays hard, and we're right there with him  as his whoops the menacing opposition, and moves to win a deadly game of  &quot;who's better?&quot; It'll keep you on the edge of your seat, I  guarantee it! John Grisham has lit the fuse of another terrific legal  dynamite! Awesome!
B000009EUM|5.0|I used to listen to this over and over back in the 80's, and then didn't have a copy for a good 10 years.  After recently purchasing one, it all came back...this album is awesome!  It makes you feel things...eerie,  moving, and wonderful things.  I remember running to this album every  single day; it raised my consciousness to another level.  If you liked  &quot;Take On Me&quot; then you need to experience this, their best, and  classic album.
0090006801|5.0|This is the 2nd Donald Burgett book I have read &amp; this one is the best.  Burgett just tells the story as he lived the invasion of Normandy and the fighting in the French hedgerows.  I have never been in a war  (thankfully), but his book really helped me understand how people felt in  battle.  I really recommend it - cannot wait for his book on Arnhem.
B000001FQI|5.0|I just love this CD,from &quot;Women in Chains,&quot; to &quot;Famous last Words.&quot; This record is like one song,you must play the whole CD.When the record begings with Phil Collins on Drums,and Oleta Adams trading  vocals with Roland Orzabal on &quot;Women in Chains,&quot; the adventure  starts. &quot;Badmann's Song,&quot; is my favorite. Everything in Music is  on this song.From Jazz to Soul to hard rock,and just when you think its  over with,and the Piano starts jamming,it starts all over again to a  Masterpiece ending. &quot;Sowing the Seeds of Love,&quot; is so much like a  Beatles song,you can almost hear John Lennon and Paul McCartney,even Yoko  Ono's bird calling is on this song. Sometimes it sounds like its going  backwards like the Beatles songs would have. &quot;Advice for the Young at  Heart,&quot; is wonderfull,and the only song Curt Smith is featured. There  must have been alot of fighting between the two Musicians when this record  was made,because they broke up after its release. Oleta Adams is all over  this CD,but poor Curt is hardly in here. I did see &quot;Tears for  Fears,&quot; in concert when this tape came out. They were great,and Oleta  Adams started the show solo playing the Piano,and singing one of her songs.  The last song on the CD,&quot;Famous Last Words,&quot;about the end of the  world will break you heart. Every song here is a winner.If I was only to  have 5 records,this would be one of them.
044022165X|4.0|This novel is impressive for its realistic depiction of the law school experience.  Although the plot does not devote much attention to Rudy Baylor's struggle financially and socially through law school, it  nevertheless, strikes a familiar chord with anyone who has been a law  student.  Many of ones classmates are arrogant and it seems that for some  it is who they know as opposed to what they know that is more important to  career advancement.  <br />As for the novel in general, it is remarkably  accurate in its description of civil procedure (the various steps of  advancing a legal action) and the legal arguments and strategies used by  Baylor and the insurance company's counsel.<br />Another aspect of the plot  that kicks the teeth out of the conventional view of the practice of law is  the fact that many firms pay their associates on a &quot;eat what you  kill&quot; basis, which is the firm gives the junior lawyer a percentage on  all legal fees generated by clients the junior lawyer manages to bring in  the door of the firm.  If you are a young lawyer this can be a very  daunting task where age and maturity are sought by clients and youthfulness  is ironically not attractive.  Under this arrangement, a lawyer who cannot  bring in clients may starve.  There are a lot Bruiser Stones out  there.<br />Grisham is an experienced trial lawyer and the depth of his  knowledge shines through in this work of fiction.<br />A must read for anyone  who enjoys legal thrillers which do not romanticize the legal profession.

B00000DFRS|5.0|I tend to like Whitney's songs better than her albums.  Her latest effort is a r&amp;b classic!  From begining to end the albums delivers.  Unlike any album she's previously recorded this album is more beat driven than  vocaly driven (as is most r&amp;b).  From a vocal stand point this is  probably Whitney's weakest recording, but her voice isn't the center piece  on this collection, it's more like another instrument vibbin' with Rodney  Jerkin beats.  It's not Right but it's ok is a nice preview of what the  album has to offer.  This is definatelly an album that gets better with  each listen it seems that r&amp;b is a nice fit for Whitney, too bad this  type of music doesn't really showcase her amazing voice.  Pop music is  better at doing that.  It's possible that die-hard fans will be left  longing for the big power ballad we come to expect from Whitney, to them I  say just enjoy what's in front of you- it's a groove thang!
B00000IWVS|5.0|This is truly an amazing recording.  The passion and beauty come across in a way I've never heard in a recording before.  Words, essentially, fail me.  Buy this CD, if it's the only classical CD you buy all year.

B00000HZFP|4.0|I saw this show at Jane Street NYC four days ago and it is still with me.  Very engaging show.  Matt McGrath was extremely good and I was amazed at how very hooky and fantastic the songs were.  They stand up alone very  well.  Hedwig must tour.  I can't afford to haul all my friends to NYC to  see this.
B00000K19E|2.0|I love science fiction movies, and I think the matrix is one of the greatest movies in this genre. However, I was dissapointed when I buyed the DVD version and discovered the horizontal top and bottom black bars  displayed on the screen actually hide parts of the picture that are  viewable in the standard version (you can watch scenes displayed in  standard format on the DVD's special features). I conclude that DVD  technology is great, but not exploited in full.
B0000039PW|5.0|To put it plain and simple this album put one of the greatest hip hop lyricist ever on the map. Anyone who is a true hip hop head has this album in the house or the car, few CD's measure up to this one, and even fewer  ever will. Some people claim 2Pac was the best, and some claim Biggie, and  because they had beef with each other because of some &quot;he say, she say  sh*#, so people feel like they have to choose 1 or the other. Don't forget  they used to be down with each other, so I say both are 2 of the dopest,  realest and hardest rhyme sayers of all time, and not many could touch them  lyrically.      -Gwhiz
6305609721|4.0|A funny thing happened on the way home. We blew up our starship, swiped a Klingon Bird of Prey, and reincarnated my buddy. Man, am I in dutch with my  boss.<br />This is Kirk's dilemma at the beginning of THE VOYAGE HOME, but it  gets a hell of a lot better. The crew of the late great starship Enterprise  decide to go home and face the consequences of their actions. Lucky them,  that the **** hits the fan on Earth before they arrive.<br />It turns out that  we stupid humans killed off all the whales in the early 21st Century. The  whales had been talking to this big probe in space all these years (without  the use of technology, mind you!) and when the whales were silenced, the  probe headed for Earth.<br />My guess is this probe doesn't have warp speed,  because it took almost 300 years to arrive. That's a nice thing to do for a  pen pal. The probe, not in Earth's orbit, is vaporizing the oceans, looking  for whales.<br />It's a real good thing Spock got brought back to life, or no  one would have figured out that if you go back in time and kidnap a whale  from the 20th Century, and bring it forward in time, it could tell this  probe to get lost.<br />Okay, big leap of faith,. If I were the whale, I'd  tell the probe to kill off all the nasty humans, but that's just me.  Anyway, the time travel thing works. Scotty tries to use a MacIntosh, and  Checkov gets caught stealing photons from the nuclear vessels (someone  should have told him that sunlight is photons).<br />This is arguably the best  of the STAR TREK movies, which unfortunately isn't saying much, but if you  HAVE to watch a Trek flick, watch this one.
B000002U6E|5.0|this album rocks! i just bought thier 4th album, Screen Behind The Mirror and i loved that as well, but this album is the best by far! i love enigma! Tracks #2, #4 rule! #2 has great &quot;dramatic&quot; effects while #4  downright rocks and just soooooo sexy! it also has #7, &quot;Age of  Loneliness&quot; which is in the movie Sliver ( a very sexy seductive  song!) it is a must for enigma fans! what are you waiting for? go get it!
B000001OAA|5.0|All i can say about this alblum is that it is an excellent combination of vocal, keyboard, and style. I would reccomend Garbage to anyone who enjoys any of there music played on the radio, The alblums are all good music.
B00003XB8K|4.0|What did you expect but the best? Enigma/Micheal Cretu does it like no one can! The sounds are absolutely creative and stunning..diff. mood mixings...like the other 3 albums. If you are an Enigma fan, you will have  to buy this CD or you are missing out!
B00000J7J4|5.0|Don't listen to the other reviewers.<br />I've always liked Santana, I own his previous 'Best of' collection, but I wouldn't have blinked if the had simply labeled this album 'The Best of Santana', it is that  good.<br />Santana's trademark wailing guitars come through in every track,  even in tracks that aren't obviously trademark Santana, such as the tracks  featuring Everlast and Lauryn Hill, the latin flavour comes through and  combines with each artist's unique talents to create gems of  collaborations.<br />Every single track in this album is brilliant, from the  catchy spanish 'Primavera' (my fav), to the epic jam session with the two  guitar legends, Clapton and Santana, in track 13, 'The Calling'.<br />All in  all, this is one of the rare albums that actually worth the ridiculous  price they charge for CDs, buy it, love it, cherish it.
0688062334|5.0|Diana Wynne Jones is my absolute, undyingly favorite author! Howl's Moving Castle is the first book I ever read by her, and it changed my whole perspective on fantasy. Howl's Moving Castle remains my favorite book, though it is closely followed by A Tale Of Time City and Aunt  Maria.EVERYBODY, READ ALL OF HER BOOKS! EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM ARE  FANTASTIC! I MEAN IT! READ ALL OF THEM!
B000002UYZ|5.0|I am not much for greatest hits compilations.  I would much rather buy all the individual albums as they were originally released--call me a completist. However, I have realized my collection is sadly short of the  Beatles classic and timeless music. I need help. Which original album  included the song &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;? It is one of my fave songs  and I don't want to buy this album to get it if I don't have to--Thanks!
B00000JCB2|5.0|This album is awesome, lyrics express the way I and probably many other feel. Songs are catching and they don't bore at all not even after 2 months. It's not woman-friendly, but who cares! Anyone can interpret this  for himself..either you love them, you hate them, you love to hate them!   Absolutely a five star winner to me!
B000000WJZ|5.0|This is the best smashing pumpkins album by far. Mellon Collie, Gish and Pisces.. are all excellent, and Adore is a bit average, but this is absolutely ESSENTIAL. I've owned it for about 4 years now and it STILL  impresses me every time i listen to it. It's up there with other greats  from the 90s such as Ten and Vs by Pearl Jam, RATM's debut and Adrenaline  by the Deftones. <br />If you miss out on listening to this album, then you  simply haven't lived.
B000002UKS|5.0|I borrowed this CD four months ago from a friend to help get over my ex and I'm permanently attached to it.  She'll have to get herself another copy because this is one album you can't do without.<br />Stand out tracks are  Hey, Johnny Park!, My Hero, and Up In Arms.  But these are just three  exceptional songs in an album full of stand-out tracks.<br />Don't get me  wrong, I'm not saying this is Dave Grohl's requiem or anything.  But in The  Colour and The Shape, Grohl has proven that though his resume will always  say 'ex-most popular band in grunge ever' first, there is life after  Nirvana. <br />I love this album.  Please listen to it.
0671027344|5.0|I've spent a day reading all of the reviews, and support all of them, even the ones that say it wasn't good. This book isn't for everyone, that I admit, but being 16, I know that this book does and will appeal to many  high schoolers and a few adults. The people that did give it a bad review  are usually the people that can't relate to the book and the plot to well  from their expirences in high school, but those that can relate, even the  slightest bit are the ones that will definitly like it. The book is well  written and shows that every teen is different and that they should not be  grouped together and all thought of as one. This book may not be for  everyone, but I liked it and think that it does deserve five stars.
0062502182|5.0|As with any deliberate text there seems to be a purpose to this book.  The process you go through to discover the purpose is the reason.  This is the type of book you will tell your friends about.  The type of book you'll  think about in years to come.  Very powerful and incredibly clever, without  you immediately realising it. You might think, &quot;oh another  `change-your-life' style book!&quot; but the simple clarity of this book  will really make you see things differently.  If you've read &quot;The  Little Prince&quot;, read this.  If not, read both!
B000000WCV|5.0|the method of making music that daft punk uses is truly like no other group in history.  the best song on this cd is Teachers but Around the World is also very good
0792156684|5.0|When you think of TITANIC you probably think  just another story about the sinking of a ship.Not this time TITANIC is one of the saddist love stories I have ever seen.It was so entertaining I saw it 9 times.It truly deserved  all 11 Oscars including best picture.I give this movie 5 stars for great  special effects and for a good story line.
B00000JZC4|5.0|Got their CD last week, awsome. Good songs throughout the album. Good hard beats with good lyrics, songs like &quot;Welcome to the fold&quot; and &quot;The best things&quot;. Not only was filter's CD awsome and one of the  best in its catagory, but in concert, they are amazing. Saw their concert  last Saturday and i was amazed by their perfomance. They were great and  hope that Richard Patrick will keep up the good work.
B000001ZSF|5.0|In the very beginning, I bought my first CD by Mr. Jarre. 'Twas a live recording from his concert in Hong Kong 1994. I must say the music was indeed of me likin', particularly to mention the magnificent Chronologie  themes!<br />I found, however, myself more than a bit disturbed by that bloody  applausing at every turn, not to mention the speaks in Chinese.  &quot;Arrgghh!&quot; would be the proper description of me reaction,  mayhaps.<br />Thus I gathered what little monetary possessions I had set aside  during the course of years and purchased the studio-made version. Now I am  a happy fella indeed, thanks to Mr. Jarre!
0553573403|5.0|There are those who find Robert Jordan's writing less than stellar. I don't count myself among their ranks. What Jordan's books do well (rather, more than well) is tell an evocative story that draws us into another  world.<br />George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire does the same. His  characters (and there are many) are drawn in deep relief, even the best is  a deeply flawed (and hence, fundamentally human) individual. The story arc  concerns an island  kingdom, with thousands of years of feudal history. The  book teems with clansmen, leigelords, vassals, and slaves - alliances are  formed and shattered.<br />Ultimately, if you are looking for a good read,  you could do far, far worse.
0876855575|5.0|This is so far my favorite Bukowski book. It brings in Henry Chinaski, a character Bukowski uses in many stories. A must read, but with an open mind.
6304595247|5.0|At school for our final year we had to do Wuthering Heights.  Most of the class seemed to hate the style of language and had no interest in getting through the book.  At the time my personal life was exactly like Cathy  &amp; Heathcliff's, so the book of course appealled to me so much that I  read it four times!  I LOVED IT!  The romanticism in it is wild and free.   It is a book which shaped my idea of love.  And when I finally came across  the third and final movie of Wuthering Heights with two of my absolute  favourite actors...Ralph Fiennes (whom I think is so tender and beautiful)  and Juliette Binoche (who is so sultry and beautiful with so much depth), I  watched it at least five times.  The reason I loved it was the fact that  the director had obviously captured the mood so well that I felt as if I  was in the book again.  The part that really stands out for me is when they  are standing at Pennistone Crag and Heathcliff is explaining his love for  Cathy referring to the skies.  On the one side the sky was beautiful and  bright and Cathy was so happy because that would be their future, but when  Heathcliff's face changes as he sees the sky on the other side, it is grey  and stormy and they both realise that their fate is sealed.  Cathy becomes  a little &quot;Miss Priss&quot; and is wooed by money and splendour as she  cannot pull Heathcliff out of his rut which Hindley had put him into.   Another part that sticks out is when he is sitting in the kitchen with a  calendar and telling Cathy how many times she has spent with Linton and not  with him.  I felt so sorry for him..he was trying to tell Cathy that he  misses her and needs her.  She is too &quot;shallow&quot; on the surface of  things and just treats it as nothing.  Although I believe that in her heart  she is fighting the fact that she adores Heathcliff, but cannot have him  because of his position.  The absolute best part would have to be when she  is in the kitchen speaking to Ellen about her lovefor Heathcliff vs her  love for Linton.  The most eloquent words about Linton being the foliage in  the woods while Heathcliff is the rocks thereunder.  &quot;I am  Heathcliff&quot; is the epitomy of how I felt about the book, the movie and  the whole spirit of the story!  I became so involved in their lives that I  felt one with them.  I miss that feeling and wish I could read it all over  again anew.
B00004BZ16|5.0|Yep,  Own about 300 discs.  Jazz is by far my favorite genre, and my collection contains many discs in Jazz, Funk, Rock, Blues, and Gospel.  The disc that spins the most, by far, is Sandinista! - no question.  Second  would probably be Bille Holiday or Frank Sinatra.<br />Buy this disc.  Love  this disc.  The only band that mattered brings us the only disc that  matters.
6303109950|4.0|There have been several movies centered on the famous &quot;Gunfight at the OK Corral.&quot;  I have seen at least six over the years.  Tombstone is probably the best of them other than John Ford's classic &quot;My  Darling Clementine,&quot; which remains in a class of its own.<br />The  central roles in any OK Corral movie are always Wyatt Earp and Doc  Holliday.  Val Kilmer's performance as Doc Holliday is the finest I have  ever seen on screen.  Kurt Russell plays Wyatt Earp.  His performance will  never erase memories of Henry Fonda, but it is solid.  Russell captures  some of the moral ambiguity of the real Wyatt Earp. <br />The supporting cast  is very good, led by a magnificent performance by Sam Elliott as Virgil  Earp.  Also noteworthy are Powers Boothe and Michael Biehn as the Earp's  foes, Curly Bill and Johnny Ringo, and Dana Delany as Josie Marcus, Wyatt's  love interest.  Western buffs will also want to watch for veteran Dobie  Carey in a small role. <br />Tombstone is also a visually beautiful  movie--some of the cinematography is spectacular.<br />The one weak part of  the film is the final segment (about the last 20 minutes or so), which  degenerates into a montage of gunfight scenes where it is nearly impossible  to keep track of what is going on or who's just killed who.  But overall,  Tombstone is a very fine Western.
B00000K0DU|4.0|OK - Everyone's heard about this one, claimed by many to be Fulci's grimmest hour etc. However, upon actually viewing it, I was very suprised to find a film that, whilst certainly containing much sadistic violence and  gore, is well-made and quite realistic. Fucli's idea of merging the lines  between a horror and thriller film have paid dividends in this movie.<br />It  is intense, sometimes not easy to watch and the last victim is litterally  slashed to ribbons (including eyes). However, the plot does make sense, it  has reasonable acting and the re-mastered release available now, is simply  top-notch.<br />If you want a ride into hell and back, then let Lucio Fulci  take you deep into the nightmarish world of a downtrodden New York, with a  vicious serial killer on the loose.<br />One of the only films I've seen that  virtually deserves its reputation as a shocking, sadistic and quite  disturbing movie.<br />You have be warned!
B000002U82|5.0|Dark Side of the Moon is nothing short of a masterpiece.. each song compliments the other so greatly in my mind it is one complete song spanning an hours worth of well spent time... If there is any album that  every person must own it is this one...
B000002G1Y|5.0|Hiatt is a master songwriter.  What wonderful lyrics, from Something Wild, to Buffalo River Home. Absolutely fabulous.
B000002H6C|5.0|After getting interested in Metallica when i was 9.. I got a hold of the and justice for all cassette and since then i feel i am one of the biggest metallica fans of them all. this metal thrashing head banging masterpiece  is by far their best and in my opinoin the greatest cd of all time.. number  2 trailing behind being Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon... anyone who is  remotely interested in Metallica will love this cd.. and although people  give it a bad rap for being poorly mixed.. it is much better than the  overproduction given to them by bob rock.. This is a must have for any  metal fan... the one true album that speaks to me.. with songs such as one  and blackened.. but a symphonic song where the bands true talent all mix  together in the beautiful song To Live Is To Die.. as a dedication to Cliff  Burton who wrote the lyrics.. This cd is an awesome cd and anyone who  thinks otherwise may have serious brain damage..
B000000OS2|5.0|This album is very different in style from the other Tesla albums.  Several of the tracks on this album are covers of classic blues/rock songs and the accoustical treatment by Tesla really brings out the qualities in  these tracks that make them classics. This is not the Hard Rock
B00000IPAX|5.0|Blink 182 hasn't sold out.  If they did, then almost every band has.  Blink is a rare band that still makes the music for the fans and think they are the best like Limp Bizkit or Korn does.  I'm not saying Limp or Korn  are bad, but if Blink sold out, they sold out too.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|Fiona Apple's new cd in one word, AMAZING! I love it! &quot;Limp&quot; is one of my favorite songs! If you buy any cd this year, buy this one!
B000000993|4.0|When I first heard of all the hype surrounding Tool, it was at the height of grunge, so i just lumped 'em in with the rest of that ilk.  was I ever wrong!  when  finally gave them a chance listen around '96 I was amazed.   They evoke a blend of prog-rock, goth, industrial and punk.  I swear I can  hear Bauhaus, Jane's Addiction, Sabbath, Rush, Floyd and Black Flag in  every element of their sound.  &quot;Prison Sex&quot; and &quot;Sober&quot;  are the most accesible tracks, but when you dig deeper, the songs are all  rewarding.  &quot;Undertow&quot; and track 5 are my favourites.  The  drummer is definetly the best going in rock right now; jazzy, progressive,  complex and super-tight.  Their guitarist also comes up with great, heavy  riffs and lines.  And Maynard has the best howl since Ozzy, except when he  sings low, he tends to mumble thereby obscuring great lyrics: My only  complaint.  On the whole, one of the best albums of the 90's.  here's  hoping they break free from that $25 million lawsuit and produce some great  stuff for the new millenium.
052594527X|5.0|Girl With a Pearl Earring was not only gripping and moving, it was distrubing and provoking.  I couldn't put it down.  It was sad, yet Griet is so elegant.  The character, Griet, is complex.  She is young, yet know the way of world and of things. At times she seems very adult, and others,  such a child.  <br />Why I liked this book, I don't know.  It's not my kinds  of genre.  After reading it, I found it was a bit dark.  The beginning was  like any other book.  I think I will always think about the book and it's  plot.<br />I encourage you to read it!
B000002HJA|5.0|I beg to differ with most Kyuss fans on this one, in that this album rivals Sky Valley as a desert island pick. While Sky Valley is amazing, it sticks to one mood and one style, which are admittedly incredible, but only one facet of this band's great sound. This album is Kyuss at their most diverse and eclectic. Josh Homme introduces an Arabic-style guitar sound here on &quot;El Rodeo&quot; and &quot;One-Inch Man&quot;, while &quot;Catamaran&quot; and &quot;Phototropic&quot; show a softer musical side, with some nice guitar work. Homme has to be the most underrated guitar player around. &quot;Size Queen&quot; shows them expanding within their sound. It's hard to describe this track. Kinda funky, with a slow, reggae-type tempo, but with a much too choppy riff to describe as reggae.  Like I said, indescribable.  There's some classic Kyuss rumbling bass on &quot;Hurricane&quot; and &quot;Gloria Lewis&quot; and the jam called &quot;Spaceship Landing&quot; is a fitting end. The song breaks off into 4 different parts that intertwine well, never deviating from it's dynamic, but revealing a band that wasn't afraid of using excess jamming to their utmost advantage.   All in all, the band was much tighter on this album, drifting from the loose jammy style of Sky Valley. Both albums rule for different reasons. Most bands don't even have ONE classic album that you can recommend, Kyuss has TWO. Their breakup is a mixed blessing, producing some great offspring in Unida, Slo-Burn and Queens of the Stone Age. You can see how the Queens sound developed from this album; it was like a guide to where Homme was headed. KYUSS, like The Stooges, will be recognized as a truly great band 20 years from now, when it's too late. Consider yourself lucky if you knew them while they were around.
0060925000|5.0|What spurred me on on this read, was the surfacing of emotions which many of us share but has never actually been put onto paper, and so exquisitely so. I'm awfully happy the indian perspective on the indians has been shown, and so pleasurably at that.  I, myself, have never lived in the indian  subcontinent living in the UK all my life, but this book really hit home. I  can relate to Lata in some ways and to Malati aswell, if not in more ways.   Mrs Rupa Mehra is a classic character and though she annoyed me at first  (as the mother obsessed in hitching her daughter off asap, it hit too close  to home!).  But she grew on me.  Kabir is definitely a typical occurence,  the 'forbidden' being especially common in the West. I hate Haresh, even if  I am supposed to, and I lost sympathy for Lata when she chose him over  Kabir and Amit.  But I'm sure I'll get over it. I first thought she was  weak, in taking the easy way out which kept most parties happy, but maybe  she was strong in choosing the loud Haresh over the dashing Kabir, or the  intelligent poet; she looked to her future and chose the path which would  give her most happiness- a strength which I still need to discover in  myself.  My mother has not read the book, but I'm sure she will approve of  it! Mr. Seth, thank for such a truly fab read, and if I may use a cliche,  &quot;Why, you're Tolstoy reborn!&quot;
B000009CEM|5.0|Having heard a few tracks from this album and liking them alot i went out and brought it. I had resnobly high expectations of this album and i wasnt dissapointed. Obsolete is a masterfully constructed tale of a not to  distnat future where machines created by man are threating to make man  obsolete and free speech and democracy are thing of the past. Each track  tells part of the overall story which centers around the Edgecrusher and  his fight for freedom. There are some great tracks on this album and Fear  Factory show that they are multi dimensional by playing in various tempos  and speeds something which many metal bands out there today seem to have  trouble doing.  Burton's soulfull voice comes out in the more placids  tracks and builds some great atmosphere while in the harder songs he  screams with the best of them. Showing again the ability of this band. My  favourite track would probably be Edgecrusher but the whole albums great  other highlights would probably be Decent, Securitron, Ressurection and  Timelessness. Great stuff. Thanks guys for a great album. Rock on.
0316743003|4.0|Even if the authors did get a fact or two wrong (the Lockheed F-104 Starfighter was NOT America's first supersonic jet, as the book erroneously states about 3 times. The F-86 and F-100 were both supersonic and preceded  the F-104), and even though Leo Janos' touch was perhaps a bit too evident  here and there (darned near everybody in the book talks in the vernacular  of Chuck Yeager -- or was that Janos all along? -- with perhaps a few too  many &quot;goddams&quot; thrown in for effect) the book is a great read.  <br />It abruptly yanks the alluring veil of secrecy off of the Skunk Works  and shows you the basic, raw underbelly of what it took to design, build,  fly and sell the most advanced aircraft the world has yet  seen.<br />Unfortunately, as a definitive document on the Skunk Works'  achievements and historical implications of their aircraft, the book is but  a tease.  The story of the amazing SR-71 alone is worthy of a book-length  treatment.  But as a preface, &quot;Skunk Works&quot; is a great lead-in to  other relevant books such as:<br />&quot;Operation Overflight&quot;, by  Francis Gary Powers with Curt Gentry; &quot;Mayday: Eisenhower, Khrushchev,  and the U-2 Affair&quot;, by Michael R. Beschloss; &quot;Sled Driver:  Flying the World's Fastest Jet&quot;, by Brian Shul (SR-71 pilot)
B00000K2SC|5.0|This movie is too good to put in words.  The special effects were great, but not the best reason to see this movie.  The story is smartly written and acted out.  Keanu Reeves, I know, is not the best actor in the world,  but I think he did good as Neo.  I actually went to see this in the theater  for the special effects, whick my friends say were the best, but I left  thinking only about the actual story.  I thank my Grandma for buying me  this for Christmas.  Since then I must have watched it ten times!
B00000I2LR|5.0|If you have the original version, throw it away and buy this one.  the original rocks like no other CD this decade... except of course for the import.  Every song in this CD is a perfect mix of inteligent lyrics  floating above a turbulent river of music.  it is perfect guys and girls.   get it.
