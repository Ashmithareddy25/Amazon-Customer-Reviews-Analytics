1594746036|3|My 11-year-old and 13-year-old granddaughters both recommended this book, and since I expect them to read the books I suggest to them, I always read the books they recommend to me. The cover is outstandingly full of promise for a creepy read, featuring an old-fashioned black and white photo of a little girl apparently levitating. Unfortunately, the book never does deliver.<br /><br />The expected thrills and chills never really materialize. Sure there's a kind of monster who makes two brief appearances, and we have a chase through a bog, but it's never very exciting or suspenseful. In addition, I felt that the author never really pinpoints one target audience. The central character is a teenager, and a teen romance is included, but otherwise the book reads as if it is written for the tween set, more in line with the Goosebumps series.<br /><br />This is a book with a gimmick -- the text is interspersed with vintage photos picturing the supposed characters. The photos are truly fascinating, but it often seems that characters are inserted into the plot just because the author happened to find a quirky photo.<br /><br />Still, my granddaughters liked it so perhaps I am too harsh in my judgments or reviewing the book from too adult a viewpoint. The concept of including the photos is interesting, and, as I said, the cover is dynamite.
B00IOVH8AW|5|What can I say???  This song is upbeat and just makes me feel HAPPY!!
B00B52F278|4|A good ending to this series. A lot of the fighting is the same as the past seasons as well as the overdone sex scences. Spartucus is on the run from a new Roman leader and Julisus Ceasar. Spartucus was still able to play a good cat and mouse game. Thought Ceasar should have done a lot more to show why he was able to lead Rome but this is still a Spartucus story. If you liked the other seasons you should enjoy this finale.
B00FPM4IRO|5|Love it,typically not my genre but the way the game is set up, I was instantly hooked. Very fun
B008XG1X18|5|I am addicted to pinterest. I have tried so many recipes a bunch of great ideas for the kids to make crafts or special holiday treats. I tell everyone they should have this app. Where was pinterest when i was planning my wedding......
B005BRS8Z6|5|Simple, poetic, wise, insightful, practical, applicable. I'm getting copies for our three sons. I doubt anyone can read this and not be in some way transformed.
B004GJDQT8|4|I love amazon but they don't always have what I'm looking for.
B00J8CG6KE|4|It speaks brutally about one experience that may or not be the typical in that industry.  I am sure that they are a group of traders that are not a bunch of idiots behaving like babies.  The movie is good, really good. DiCaprio is the best one there for sure.  I will suggest not bring young teenagers to the movie at all.. Maybe after they are 16 I guess...
0613181050|5|Never thought I would use the words \\"Romance\\" \\"Suspense\\" \\"Thriller\\" and the History of Mathematics in the same sentence. Great book and worth reading. It is a gripping account of the events leading to the solving of one of the greatest puzzles in Mathematics.
B00006JJ1O|5|As a native of Russia, I thought t.A.T.u was going to be a band with no talent, who want to show the world that they are proud to be lesbian. But after my English friend gave me this cd in English, it has grown on me alot. So what if they don't write their own songs? Britney Spears doesn't, but that doesn't stop people from liking her. So judging them by not writing their own songs is narrow-minded.
B00VFTAXUC|3|This movie was okay. You may need to watch a couple times to make sense of it. The story was perplexing and many times it was just confusing. At the same time, compelling food for thought and quite imaginative and deeply heart wrenching.
0062315005|5|Life changing!!!
B00IF8Q0YE|4|The steelbook case for The Evil Dead on bluray is very nice. The only bonus feature on the bluray is a commentary with Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Robert Topert (but it is a very informative commentary going through what it took to make the movie). You can watch in either 1.85:1 or 1.33:1.
B007QXWV1U|4|Good
0449227421|1|My very favorite line is &quot;You're saying I'm a clone&quot;, not to mention &quot;the notion of doctors experimenting on patients without permission was just the kind of  thing to make her mad&quot;. Duh!  I have always been an avid reader of Ken Follett's works, but I think he has been cloned, using the Multiplicity concept of over cloning. This book is the thriller attempt of the final clone.  Did Follett get major endorsements for this book?  We were  bombarded with commercials for cars,  clothing and  Doc Marten boots.  Why would a writer use real places and then throw in ficticious  landmarks  like the Richmond-Williamsburg airport?  This kind of constant movement from the real to the invented is very distracting from the plot.  The main character, Jeannie Ferrami, is without a doubt one of the best arguments against feminism that I have ever read.  She is completely unlikable and unsympathetic.  Her life history is inconsistent and her arrogance is unbelievable in this day and age.  I am greatly surprised that the flight attendants' union has not filed a class action suit against Follett for malice.  He uses the term &quot;stewardess&quot;  repeatedly and refers to that job as a waste of education and a classic case of failure.  This happens not just once but many times. Jeannie thoroughly believes that anyone who does not  go into the history books with a major scientific discovery is less than worthwhile.<br />This cannot be the Follett who wrote &quot;Eye of the Needle&quot;, please God!  I, like  another of the reviewers,  have a policy about finishing what I read.  This book was a strong test, but I just couldn't stop believing that at the end, he would say &quot;April Fool&quot;.  I would rather be tricked than believe that one of my favorite writers is  using a software program to put together a novel
B006PHD0RW|5|this game is so fun to play and i hope everyone else likes it to if i were you rate it a 5out of 5 and if you dont well thats your fault.
B0098460O4|5|This album is everything that I I had hoped for. It is totally professional and classy. Everyone should buy it.

0312935080|5|So far this has been my favorite Harry Bosch novel to date and I like them all immensely. In this novel not only do you get your usual police work that you come to expect from this series but you also get some courtroom drama as Harry is on trial for violating a killers civil rights.  Michael Connelly is really developing the Harry Bosch character expertly and I find the books impossible to put down.  I like these books so much that I really dread the day that catch up with the series or Michael Connelly decides to end it.  In the meantime if you are looking for a well written engrossing police procedural, check out the Harry Bosch series.
B0031KC8OC|5|Loved the show
B009EEFTMC|5|Absolutely love it.  Completely addictive.  Glad I found this game and downloaded it.  Gives me another excuse to use my new tablet.

B0063IH60K|4|This is a good, easy to play game and Heaven knows the price is right!  Graphics are nice and clear, and it responds well on my Kindle.
B00EGJE4G2|5|Entertaining writing style balances out a depressing but fully convincing narrative of where life on earth has been and where it's headed. Very well done science lesson that was a page turner.
B00FAPF5U0|4|This is a great strategy game that makes me think of how to get the best points out of my move! It's challenging and addictive! Love the colors, just wish I could hit a jackpot on the daily booster!
B0071XO8RA|5|A co-worker told me about Wool and, since it was only $5.95, I bought it and downloaded it to my iPad. I'm glad I did because this is a great book. The author does such an amazing job describing life in the silo that you feel as though you are there. And, really, that is the best part of the book...the descriptive language. The story then becomes a mystery. Who are these people? How did they end up in a silo? Are they the only people left in the world or are there others? The characters are well developed, the story catches you and won't let go, and you keep reading to find out what happens. In short, you will not be disappointed with this book. I downloaded Wool 6 and can't wait to start it. Congrats to the author on a fantastic book!
B00HLTD49C|4|Good but not great.
B000XUBFE2|4|I became intrigued by Liesel`s appetite for words and I was warmed by the father/daughter relationship. I have always been interested in the Holocaust but this book offered the different viewpoint of the sympathetic German. Very, very good book. I hope the movie does the book justice.

B0002TX4QQ|5|I'm not a parent, but I know enough about parents  (having had two of my own) to be enjoying this novel and its comforting and confirming notion that, whether a child turns out to be a serial killer or a carpet salesman, a pedophile or a filmmaker, the parents of said child will be supremely disappointed. As Woody Allen once said of his mother (or words to this effect) \\"She still thinks I should have become an accountant - to have a back-up profession.\\"  Add to the mix a narcissistic, globe-trotting mother who has been nudged into parenthood against her better judgment, and you get Kevin - although which came first, the chick(hater) or the egg(hater) is just one of the many tantalizing mysteries in this first-rate book.  I'm still reading (actually, listening to) it on CD, and it's making me think of my own relationship with my mother, who was cold, brittle and critical, but who, for whatever biological/sociological reasons caused me to become a writer and artist.  I've been accused, on occasion of those careers, of being a serial killer myself.  \\"You'll kill your parents!\\" I have been cautioned, by well-meaning family critics, when I turned out unflattering autobiographical poetry and prose.  Look what happened to Truman Capote when he \\"assassinated\\" several friends in \\"Answered Prayers.\\"  So - the point is - well, as Eva insinuates - there almost is no point.  It's all pointless to conjecture.  Did he do it because Eva was a cold, \\"diffident\\" mother? (After all, that was the word she used to describe her initial reaction to her newborn - and as Kevin was delivered into her arms post birth, no less, which surely gave the baby a chill.)  Or was he simply an evil, calculating psychopath from day one - a bad seed?  I'm still listening, so there may be a denoument ahead.  In any case, I'm loving this novel, which trounces the concept of \\"saintly motherhood.\\"  Some women have that lovin' feeling, but I am certain that many, many more than anyone cares to acknowledge - have not.  Remember \\"My Mother, Myself?\\"  This book is a brutal, fictional - but true - reminder that Mommydom's not all it's cracked up to be.

B00005JOSS|4|It's hard to say anything about the plot of this movie, that you can't have already gotten from a trailer, without giving away the ending. Sandra Bullock plays Kate Forster, a young doctor just starting her career, having moved to the city after living in a glass house built over a lake in the country. When she moves, she leaves a note for the next resident of the house explaining a few small details and asking him to forward her mail. Alex Wyler, played by Keanu Reeves, is a youngish architect building cookie-cutter condos. He's the son of a famous, if not family-oriented, architect and their relationship makes for an interesting sub-plot. Alex moves into the house and by way of letters exchanged via the same mailbox, he and Kate realize they are two people living two years apart. The long-distance romance that ensues is expected, and at some points in the movie the producers spare the viewer from having to listen to Alex read Kate's letters in monotone and instead put the two side-by-side where they carry on a conversation as if they were actually in the same room.  <br /> <br />In The Lake House, Bullock delivers a solid, if less-than-stellar performance. No one is going to remember her for this movie, though they might remember Reeves, if only because it was something different for him. There is one very touching scene where she realy connects with the audience and I think many  will relate to her \\"bird in the hand\\" situation surrounding a past love interest.   <br /> <br />Reeves, ah Keanu...the recipient of many a criticism. I personally feel that Keanu isn't so much a bad actor, as he is a poor emoter. Once you accept that this is the way he is as a real person, I think it's easier to accept his acting style. Regardless, it's good to see Keanu doing something that doesn't involve a highwire and kung-fu. I think anti-Keanu viewers will be pleasantly surprised. <br /> <br />I only give this 4 stars instead of five because it tended to bog down in a few places.Overall though, it was a good movie, even for a date-night. <br /> <br />
B009UX2YAC|5|I love dis game<br />😊
B007VUA7VO|5|I love this app.  It lets you see how low your battery is and even alerts you to plug in your charger when too low.  I really depend on this app a lot.  My wife and grandson also have it on their Kindles.  If you need to check on how much battery power you have, this is the app for you.
B004XN3FHA|1|Here is the direct quote from the Fenix web site Support page:    \\"2) Dealers will be responsible for customers. Customers should contact the dealers or distributors from whom they bought Fenix lights for warranty support with Fenixlight Limited's 'Warranty Card' and either a trade invoice or receipt. Fenix will provide our authorized dealers with the technology and parts to service our lights.\\"    Outdoor Gear doesn't do that, and seems to be in violation of the above Fenix dealer policy.    I submitted a return request via Amazon (with an explanation of the defect in a three-month old flashlight), who forwarded it to Outdoor Gear.    It took Outdoor Gear about 90 seconds to close / deny my request.  Apparently, they are happy to take your money, but not to fulfill their dealership role.    I notice that, as of today, Amazon is not sourcing this product through Outdoor Gear.  Good!  Buy from more reputable dealers -- maybe it will pay off in the end.    And make sure to ask the seller if they SUPPORT the product, as required, before you buy.    EDIT / UPDATE - 11/09/14: Just to be clear: it is a very good light. The problem I had was the batteries died.  Since I use the more expensive and powerful lithium batteries, and it was just a few months, I didn't think of this.     TIP: It turns out that, if you're going to store this flashlight for long periods, turn on the light and then unscrew the base a few turns until it goes out.  This completely disconnects the batteries.  I read elsewhere that this light draws a slight current while unused.  The irony? The current is a battery-monitoring function!
0812982622|5|This novel is not for the faint of heart.  It contains graphic, horrible descriptions of kidnapping and of life in North Korea.  It is intense.  I am really interested in North Korea and I was a little bit skeptical that someone could write a fictional novel about it that managed to capture the essence of the society, but Johnson did a great job.  If you like this novel, you should check out some of the fantastic non-fiction books about North Korea, particularly &#34;Nothing to Envy&#34; or &#34;Escape From Camp 14.&#34;  They read like novels in their own right, but are all too true.
B004W2UBYW|5|Having grown up in the era when personal computing was just beginning, this biography does a fantastic job of capturing all the facets of what was going on. The author does a great job of capturing the brilliance that was Steve Jobs but doesn't hide any of the flaws. Even if you're not an IT geek you'll enjoy this book as it really tells a story that's worth reading as it captures a time that will be far more then a footnote in history.
B00EDY5KTA|5|AWESOME

B00D2K40WY|5|My daughter spends hours on this app and she loves it!  The cost for the full version is a little steep but the free version does the trick for a couple hours.
B000FBFN1U|5|Up to now, it's known this is the best book in the series.<br /><br />Rich with betrayal, epic scenes, hidden magic, growing dragons and bloodbaths, this is what the worlds of Westeros and Esos are made for!
B00D5O7BPU|4|Okay, there really isn't much to this -- but it is very realistic and surprisingly gives a feel for firing some of these weapons.<br />It might be more fun if there was a purpose, but, eh. Fun to play with.
0345347951|5|I borrowed  &quot;Childhood's End&quot; from my boyfriend for the simple reason that I had just finished a book and was looking for something new to read. I had heard from several people that this was an excellent book, and 50 pages into the story, I was about to put the book down for the night. It's a good thing that I didn't ...about 4 hours later I read the last page and was moved to tears! This book raises so many questions about science, society, and humanity in general that it will be with me for a very long time...without going into the plot (it should be evident from other reviews), I will say that the characters are excellent and well-developed in a relatively short number of pages and the pacing of the story is very good (moderate enough for details and character build-up, but not so moderate that it induces boredom). This book gives nothing away about the ending and it's a definite &quot;page turner&quot;...In my opinion, no review can really do this book justice, as its main strength lies in the feelings it evokes in the reader: You have to read it to experience it!
B00003CWL5|5|This beautiful movie dealing with some of the world's most twisted subjects shows you can be a beautiful teen, a lovable teen, an obessed mom, a depressed father or a hot young man, and love can still find it's way to  you. The best movie I've seen since Gone with the Wind
B000068PQ0|5|The sticker on the cover of the CD I bought reads:    \\"The greatest album released in Uncut's lifetime...\\" 5 1/2 out of 5 stars - Uncut (UK)  \\"An artisitic triumph\\" - Spin (US)  \\"The band's most delicate and sophisticated work yet...\\" 5 stars - The Times (UK)  \\"Yoshimi...sets yet another benchmark\\" 9/10 - NME  \\"Their second masterpiece\\" 4 out of 5 stars - Q Magazine  \\"...a serious headtrip\\" 4 out of 5 stars - Rolling Stone.    I wasn't familiar with the Flaming Lips' music. Frankly, their name turned me off. But I heard the song \\"Do You Realise?\\" on VH1 and decided to investigate. I ended up taking a chance on this album and found that it is clearly the best CD I've listened to this century, but I find that I can't define it. The closest thing to a definition would be - imagine Neil Young singing for Pink Floyd! It affected me in the same way as it did Ian Aldis - it definately grows on the listener. The first time through I thought it was strange. The third and fourth times through Koshimi just blew me away. Now I can see why it received the reviews above.    What is it so good?     Is it the sense of theatre that is missing in todays music? The first half of this concept album is based on the fight by a young girl - Yoshimi, a \\"blackbelt in karate\\", against an invading force of evil robots, apparently similar to either Asimov's \\"I Robot\\" or even Wells' \\"War of the Worlds\\".     Or is it the brilliant production and conception which combines beautiful melodies with subtle electronic notes and blips? Or is it the genuiness of the singer's heartfelt mid-western twang? Track one, \\"Flight Test\\", is a catchy acoustic song that harkens back to Cat Stevens' \\"Father and Son\\", both in melody and lyrical content. Here we discover the danger through the singer's reluctance to challenge the robots \\"'cause I'm a man not a boy and there are things you can't avoid, you have to face them when you're not prepared to face them\\". On the second track, he contemplates the psychologicaldifferences between humans and his captors. His hopes now rest on the planet's saviour Yoshimi (another acoustic track). She goes on to battle the robots on the instrumental track 4; probably the most frenzied this album gets, with some electronic sound effects reminscient of Pink Floyd's \\"On the Run\\".     The second half of the album is not as clear conceptually. Is the singer reflecting on his life during or after the battle? Or is he contemplating future life while the battle progresses? I'm not sure, but the songs are increadibly moving. For instance, the lyrics on track 6 \\"Ego Tripping at the Gates of Hell\\" read \\"I was wanting you to love me, but your love never came...I was waiting on a moment, but the moment never came\\". On track 9 \\"Do you Realise?\\" he asks \\"Do you realise that you have the most beautiful face? Do you realise we're floating in space?\\" This is truly an amazing album.     Even though I can hear elements of a few great bands; including, post 'OK Computer' Radiohead, early 70's Pink Floyd and David Bowie's Ziggy Stardust, this is a unique album from a very, very good band. I am shocked at the outstanding quality of the whole production and the ability of the songwriters. I thoroughly recommend that if you collect rock masterpieces, you need to proudly sit \\"Yoshimi\\" on your top shelf.
B00BEPVAV8|3|Beach Buggy Blitz is your typical racing game that features multiple characters and cars to choose (which you earn via coin collecting).  The graphics are pretty good when you factor the audience which this game caters to.  The only drawback would be that you play the same track but with different features on the track.  All in all, this is a fun game to play if you want to kill some time but don't expect to get hooked on the game.
0440244412|5|This is the last book and as gripping as the first ones. You never know what new twists and turns are going to happen. Loved the whole story line.
B004EPYZQ2|5|I had already seen the movie before and the family enjoyed it so I decided to buy it. Received the movie very quickly with no problems.
B00IG2DOKM|5|I am really enjoying this game. You do not need to purchase anything with this. The only downside is you need internet access.
B0083GQ2A0|5|Great actoin movie

B00QW8TYWO|5|This app is great! Who doesn't want to see a whale get run over by a train😄
B00008RH3L|5|If you haven't seen this film, you've missed one of the best gangster flicks of all time !  The story-line has more twists and turns than a roller-coaster and some of the best scenes and dialouge you'll find.  Outstanding performances by Gabriel Byrne (Tom), Albert Finney (Leo), Marcia Gay Harden & John Tuturro.  If you can figure out where this one's going to end more than 15 minutes before the actual ending, I'll eat my hat !!! This is one of those movies you'll be talking about with your friends for days afterward (and repeating lines from the movie too).  One of my favorite movies of the last 20 years (1990).

B00DUGCLY4|5|I'm going to be honest and say that I only did this review for 15 coins, however I do love the game. Although I would say my feelings about this app are quite bipolar. One moment I'm throwing my device against the wall because I can't figure out the puzzle (I found out that I could have looked up a cheat instead of what I did) and the next moment I'm sitting there with it for hours at night when I should go to bed because I have practice and school in the morning. So just go ahead and take my advice and buy the game.

B000JCQCW4|5|I thought the acting was superb but the movie is disturbing in nature. It made me think for a while after watching it.
B00000J2KR|5|Some people may complain about the slower pacing of &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;. They are missing the point : this film is not about moving from plot point A to plot point B in the most efficient way possible - you want that, go see a Ron Bass movie. <br />&quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, unlike many movies which trip all over themselves to twist the audiences expectations, does take it's time; but it is for the journey that we must embark. Every character, every set, every line of dialogue, every frame has been touched by a craftman unequaled in his lifetime. From the highly detailed production design to the flowery, and at times, comical dialogue Kubrick has created a true vision of life in aristocratic Europe. <br />But instead of celebrating the chivalry and heroism of the period Kubrick peels away the layers of legend to reveal the true nature of kings and generals. He satirically castigating royalty and soldiers alike as petty and decadant rogues, who pay lip service to honor while stealing all they can to support their lifestyle (or &quot;the manner with which they'd become accustomed&quot;). And Barry, being from humble roots, is all too eager to play the game in exchange for a place at the table.   <br />The film is both a literary and visual masterpiece. The former is likely due to the abilities of W.M. Thacker who wrote the book upon which the movie was based. Only a novel could be so rich in detail while mantaining it's overall theme. The latter, is all Kubrick - always a visual genius, the man invented a new lens system so he could film the whole thing with natural light. Amazing. At certain points in the movie, you will be wondering if that river or meadow in the background is a matte painting or if, in fact, a place that scenic does indeed exist.<br />I've seen the movie three or four times, I watch key scenes over and over again. To me, it's one of the funniest movies ever made. The fact that Kubrick made it also makes it one of the best.

1419802356|4|This movie is not going to be for everyone.  Most movies are not for everyone.  This movie was quirky but in a funny way.<br /><br />That being said they are presenting a very powerful and serious movie.  The humor just makes it easier to power through it.<br /><br />Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. will thank you.
B000JMKTLO|4|Not a light read but difficult to put down once you get started.  Can be quite disturbing but it's like an accident, you crave to see more. Mrs.Flynn captures you.
B005TBN3EU|1|I loved the Hangover movie. The first movie was so hilarious! It made me laugh until the end of the movie. The Hanover part II came out- I was so excited to watch it. Then I was disappointed with the movie... it did not make me laugh at all. I felt that there were many parts in the movie where people had to suffer pain. I did not find it funny at all. Do not buy it. It would save you a lot of money- trust me.

B00AA0TJO8|3|I purchased this game for my sons, ages 6 and 9.  We all thought drawing your own stick figure to use in-game was a ton of fun.  My boys would constantly re-draw their figures and laugh at all the new creations.<br /><br />I did not play the game, but watched a bit of the gameplay.  It looked to be pretty entertaining, it is a puzzle-type game of interacting with the game environment.  It looked to be fun to play, but both my kids quickly tired of the game and I don't think they have played it after that first day.  This is out of character, they rarely lose interest in a  game so quickly.<br /><br />The game is cleverly done, and worth the few bucks to buy.  The gameplay itself seems a little easy.  It does foster creativity, which is always a plus.
B00ENBTI8C|5|These are the most comfortable scrubs on the market. I love them, and don't wear anything else. Wash and dry like brand new every time.
B005IQZB14|4|I like books that grab your attention as soon as you start reading and this book does that.  But then it lost my full attention a little and then gained it back.  The author is very descriptive and made me feel a part of the story.  So overall I would recommend this book.
B00D37UQ1K|5|This is an excellent movie; quite different from the Twilight series of books and movies associated with this author.  I found the story intriguing.  Underlying the basic setting of the story (aliens which inhabit human bodies) is a love story between the two primary characters.  The story is told nicely and kept my interest throughout.<br /><br />And as always, the transaction to purchase the digital video via Amazon was flawless, and the quality of the digital streaming is absolutely superb.
B003G4W49C|4|\\"Ender's Game\\" is a book that I've had on my wish list for a long time. I'm glad I finally bought it, but I'm sad it took me so long to give the book a try! It is a coming of age sci-fi adventure for a young prodigy named Andrew, whose nickname is Ender. The story follows Ender as he grows from an awkward boy to a hardened battle leader.<br /><br />The story bounces between Ender's viewpoint and that of his minders who shape his rapid growth and learning so he will be able to fight against a devastating alien race known as the Buggers. While the name of the enemy sounds a bit childish, the story telling is far from that as it explores what it is like to be an outcast because of one's extraordinary skills and abilities.<br /><br />In addition to Ender's story, there is some politic intrigue as we learn about Ender's two siblings, who also possesses knowledge and drive well beyond their years. This part of the story was underplayed, but I think it is likely to come to the forefront in later novels.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book, and I'm looking forward to exploring other books in the Ender series.
B007J4T2G8|1|Shame on whoever was hired as Editor, you've failed miserably. Fifty Shades is so poorly written it somehow detracts the reader from it's main purpose, sex. Even though we're unable to complete one full chapter without a very detailed romping session, I found it to be a thankful diversion from the one dimensional, fickle, and, quiet frankly, pathetic characters. Between Ana's inability to control her hormonally driven emotional outbursts and Grey's inexplicable craving for normality after claiming a devout taste for violence, this piece falls exceedingly short of gratifying
B00G5G7K7O|5|We've already seen this movie in theaters twice. It is a fantastic story about sisterhood, true love, compassion for others, and learning to love yourself. It will make you smile and it will make you cry. As the mother of two girls, this is THE BEST Disney princess movie yet...PLUS we have our first Disney Queen. Elsa is crowned Queen in the movie. My daughter is running around saying &#34;I'm a QUEEN&#34; rather than being a princess. Love it.
B007XKEY6Q|3|This game is fun but there are a lot of cons. For instance I won the weekly challenge twice and it didn't give me the prize both times. But overall this is a good game.
B00009ATIX|3|Previous reviewers have said about all that needs to be said about the content of the film. Clearly there is a difference of opinion, a sharp difference. While no Sci-Fi buff, I have enjoyed many in the long line of such films that began with the experimental French film at the turn of the century (19th to 20th). However, Solaris is a film in which the science fiction aspects are quite irrelevant. They are used only as a backdrop to a man-woman story that could have been put into any setting with slight adjustment.The story itself might have benefited from a supername on the marque; but, through no fault of George Clooney, his presence does not salvage the lackadaisical script and direction. The actress playing his wife, Natascha McElhone, certainly makes one believe she would be missed, the others were simply playing roles with little definition or opportunity for an actor to shine.
B00DPM7TIG|5|I struggled so to read this book over several months. Novels about war times are not my first choice but it had been so highly recommended that I felt compelled to continue my effort. And I'm so glad that I did. The authors style of writing and superb character development engaged me in a haunting way. Some of his passages were so beautifully written that I found myself rereading them -- pure enjoyment.

B000000OF6|5|The 1991 death of Freddie Mercury and the inclusion of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" in the film \\"Wayne's World\\" ignited a renewed interest in Queen.  Known for their over-the-top arrangements and Mercury's undeniable stage presence, Queen was one of the most popular international acts ever.  \\"Queen Greatest Hits 1&2\\" is the definitive collection of the group's material.  These guys dabbled with rock (\\"We Will Rock You\\"), pretentious pop (\\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\"), Chic-inspired r&b (\\"Another One Bites the Dust\\"), compelling, sap-free love songs (\\"You're My Best Friend\\"), rockabilly (\\"Crazy Little Things Called Love\\"), and even synth pop (\\"Radio Ga Ga\\").  Few groups could claim a body of work so varied as Queen, and all the hits are compiled on these two discs.  Other favorites of mine are \\"I Want to Break Free,\\" the soaring, tear-jerking \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\" and \\"The Show Must Go On,\\" which had to be written as a hint of Mercury's eventual passing.  My only gripe is that this set excludes the synth-heavy \\"Body Language,\\" which I personally liked.  Queen isn't one of my all-time favorite groups, but only a fool would deny their indelible mark on pop music.

B00NEQRNVG|3|I'm not sure what that more is yet cause I just got done but I waited a very long time for this book and was hoping for something more. More questions answered maybe? More sex in detail maybe? I'm not sure again but what I am sure about is that I liked not knowing what he was always thinking.....I liked him being more of a mystery. I liked when the story was told from Eva point of view. It gave you that possibility of making him anyway you wanted or kept you guessing what he was thinking. I will still eagerly be waiting for book 5 but not with as much anticipation. Still a great series, that I would recommend.
B000O14VAU|4|Entertaining take on the vampire mythology.  The movie is more of an action/adventure as opposed to horror, but it does have it's fair share of blood and gore.
0060278234|5|This book was good, starting enough after Sabriel left off to be less of a continuance of that story. Unfortunately, this story ends right as the plot begins to take off.  I really enjoyed the descriptions of the characters, though, and there is definitely a twist.  Also, Nix brings charter magic more into the story than he did in Sabriel, so that was exciting.  The book isn't boring, though it becomes frustrating at times because of the slowness or the fact that you want to read more about Lirael.  I couldn't put it down, but I desperately wanted to start reading the sequel to it, so if you're one of those people who get into a story and won't rest until the story is done, wait until Nix writes the next one, because this story has no real ending, just a \\"Sorry folks, but that's all we have for today\\" type thing.  And that was the most frustrating of all.
B00HZ48QUA|3|Ordered it on Febr. 5, very funny and entertaining movie. Unfortunately, although CC was activated, it showed up in a newspaper size print, that could not even be read with your nose on the TV screen.  Also half way it started buffering badly for about 20 minutes, got better towards the end.<br /><br />Today, after some computer research, I discovered that it is possible to edit the close captions to a larger size on the amazon website!  I had not come across that in the past,  it does work, so disregard my previous  remarks.
B00CKOYVG8|5|Always liked it
1881273873|5|I have always told my kids that people are different and understanding how people receive, understand and communicate is key to successful relationships.....it's also helpful recognizing what your love languages are as well.  :)  This book takes the emphasis off of couples and helps the single person look at people just as people and not as mates.

B00005JKHP|5|On the surface, the plot to 1979's \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" isn't very interesting -- A colossal, mysterious space cloud called V'ger travels across the galaxy and threatens Earth; the origins of V'ger are revealed at the end. In truth, \\"The Motion Picture\\" addresses many of the deepest questions of life -- Is this all there is? Why are we here? Does love exist since it cannot be proved via pure logic? Who is the Creator? The core message is the intrinsic need to seek one's Creator and reconcile in order to attain a (necessary) higher level of consciousness. Those that hate the film and found it boring simply failed to penetrate beyond the surface.<br /><br />Like the Star Trek episodes \\"The Corbomite Maneuver\\" (#3) and \\"Metamorphosis\\" (#31), \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\" is a mature, cerebral sci-fi story with very little action. Most kids and young adults won't like it or grasp it. It's depth is evidenced by the emotional wallop experienced when Spock grasps Kirk's hand in Sickbay, truly revealing emotion despite his conflicting desire to attain a consciousness of pure logic, or later when Spock weeps for V'ger and comments on its personal dilemma, which perfectly coincides with Spock's own search for fulfillment: \\"As I was when I came aboard, so is V'ger now -- empty, incomplete and searching. Logic and knowledge are not enough... Each of us at sometime in our lives turns to someone -- a father, a brother, a God -- and asks, 'Why am I here?' 'What was I meant to be?' V'ger hopes to touch its creator to find its answers.\\"<br /><br />Another powerful sequence is a crewman's self-sacrificial fusion with V'ger so that it may evolve to the next level of awareness (seemingly self-sacrificial, that is).<br /><br />The fact that the film inspires such profound contemplation and emotion proves that it's not just a bad film that apologists try to make excuses for as critics claim, e.g. \\"It's deep and awe-inspiring; you just don't understand it.\\" I'm not making excuses; it's simply the truth. If you are unable to accept this perhaps it's because YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH. (lol).<br /><br />My conclusion on the film runs parallel to Roger Ebert's comments: \\"My inclination, as I slid down in my seat and the stereo sound surrounded me, was to relax and let the movie give me a good time. I did and it did.\\" In other words, just accept the film as is, and you WILL be entertained -- but put on a pot of coffee (you're gonna need it, HA, HA!), kick back and relish the movie magic.<br /><br />Let me add that \\"The Motion Picture\\" was one of the most expensive films of its time, but it did well at the box office and thus made a decent profit -- a testimony to how hungry the public was for Star Trek after ten long years (since the cancellation of the original TV series in '69). In fact, aside from \\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home,\\" ST:TMP is still the most profitable of all the Star Trek feature films (Making FOUR TIMES its expense worldwide); it therefore can't very well be the cinematic turd that many critics claim. Also, consider the fact that ST:TMP made more at the box office than the acclaimed films \\"Alien\\" and \\"Apocalypse Now,\\" both released the same year (1979).<br /><br />I should add that, although this film is an \\"Grade A\\" picture as far as epic, awe-inspiring pieces of cinematic art go, I understand why some would grade it lower. In such cases I suggest making the necessary psychological adjustments and watching it again as it is more along the lines of \\"The Cage\\" (#1) than \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" (#35). If this doesn't work, stick with more lightweight fare like \\"Zathura\\" or even \\"Star Wars\\" (giggle). Just joking.<br /><br />The viewer will note that \\"The Motion Picture\\" is truly the sole Star Trek film that aspires to and attains a level of cinematic awe along the lines of \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" Actually, \\"The Motion Picture\\" is LEAGUES better IMHO. \\"2001\\" lacks characters whom the viewer truly cares about; it's also cold and overly artsy, with way too many unnecessarily boring sequences (but, don't get me wrong, if \\"2001\\" trips your trigger, that's great). \\"The Motion Picture,\\" by contrast, has heart. Not to mention an interesting story that delves into the deepest of all universal questions.<br /><br />Say what you will, but \\"The Motion Picture\\" towers alone, utterly unique in the feature film series -- a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH., don't get me wrong, if \\"2001\\" trips your trigger, that's great). \\"The Motion Picture,\\" by contrast, has heart. Not to mention an interesting story that delves into the deepest of all universal questions.

B00BESM14U|5|Excellent, excellent flick.  Great writing (follows the book for the most part), superb acting, well directed.  This movie captures the joy, freedom, angst, and pain that is high school.  On par with the Breakfast Club for what that movie did for the generation.
034580404X|5|I purchased this item as a set and have just begun reading.  I'm not very far into the first book; however, I know it's going<br />to be 'good company' during these winter nights.  The price was great and I was able to use points earned from previous purchases.
B004QX07G4|5|This book is silly. If you're expecting any amount of substance or depth, walk away. It's just completely silly fun. It's random and ridiculous and delightful. Exactly what I was looking for.

B000FC10MU|5|A must read for fantasy lovers. The author has a way with characters that I love.
0553208845|5|I first read this book when I was 16 for my IB English 3 class. I had some contemplation background before I read Siddhartha. To this day, Siddhartha is my favorite work - powerful and soul-stirring.  I will not bother to tell the plot since there are 300+ other reviews. I still remeber the book vividly and from time to time read it again and again.<br /><br />  Nevertheless, I must warn readers; this work has a unique flavor.  Many people missed the boat when reading Siddhartha, including my entire class. To confirm my feelings about Siddhartha, one day during school I privately confronted my teacher about Siddhartha. She was so happy that I understood and she sensed it, saying to me \\"Isn't it such a wonderful thing to know for the rest of your life?\\" Indeed.<br /><br />  What disheartens me, however, is that some reviewers praise Siddhartha for the wrong reasons.  On a positive note, those who rebuke Siddhartha only prove part of its meaning.<br /><br />If you find that Siddhartha brings you a feeling of enlightenment, I would recommend reading about Plato's beauty theory and Aristole's contemplation as true happiness claim in Nicomachaen Ethics.<br /><br />  Despite my awareness, I believe everyone should try to read this work and attempt to understand it, even if it takes years.<br /><br />Hate, love, passion, desire, sorrow...<br /><br />This life, this existence...all so beautiful...

0385501560|3|It's not that Chuck Palahniuk is overated. He deserves some, if not all the attention that he's been getting for being a truly inventive and amusing author. The problem seems to be that his books are never quite capable of pulling off a genuine interest and concern for the misled and troubled characters. Palahniuk's skewed view of the world his books take place in adds enormously to their cynical humor and biting sarcasm, but effectively keeps us from viewing the characters as basically good people, or even as true humans. This problem kept me from ever really enjoying the truly original ideas and complicated subplots.<br />In Choke, Victor Mancini is a sex-aholic who supports himmself and his hospitalized mother by going to resteraunts and pretending to choke on a piece of food until someone 'rescues' him. His theory is that once a person saves your life, they feel responsible for it forever. As in all of Palahniuk's books, multiple plot lines that seem unrelated pop up constantly, revealing facts about Victor's childhood with his sociopahtic mother, his day job at a colonial reenactment village, his best friend and fellow sex-addict, and a doctor at his mother's hospital. These all tie in to the ending, which was personally a let down to me considering some of the other great endings his books have had.<br />Choke has all the outward makings of a good book, but it lacks emotional depth and human interest, which prove vital in the end.

B00GH4RKYM|5|No one will ever be Superman to me but Christopher Reeves.  This one is a very close rival for sexiness!
B00A6CCF0K|5|I actually liked this book better than The Shining!  Although I would suggest reading The Shining first.  Doctor Sleep explains things, but they just make more sense if you have already read The Shining.  I also thought the ending of Doctor Sleep was better.  Sometimes the endings of Stephen King novels leave me a little flat.  This was a very good ending.  I give this book high marks and suggest it highly.

B008Y720JU|3|I don't recall what year this movie was released. Today it seems that all the movies have an agenda and some are more subtle than others. I'm not positive what the agenda is for this movie. It is not a movie that I would purchase to own and I would not watch it again free via Amazon Prime because it was not the feel good type of movie that you enjoy each time you see it. If I had not seen the movie I wouldn't have missed anything. It's basic and predictable from start to stop. The actors did a decent job portraying their characters but there were no Emmy/Oscar moments at all. They could have taught the audience something about the fly fishing experience or the salmon but instead what they did say about the subject was missing anything that made you glad you know that fact. Wait what did they say about salmon now?  Maybe that info was cut. There were no light hearted moments that made you chuckle or relate to the characters. The parts that were meant to be funny were not.  It was ordinary drivel and killed some time.

078322611X|5|I first saw this film with my father when it first arrived in theaters.  My father loved sports and expected me to do the same, however, I ended up loving the cinema.  We always looked for ways to spend time together and with this film we were able to meet somewhere in the middle.  He got to see a movie supposedly about \\"sports\\" and I got to see a movie period.  I was 12 years old.<BR>  I really enjoyed the film, although it wasn't until about a year ago that I fully understood and appreciated it's true impact.  I am now 27 years old and married.  I lost my father in March of 2003.  I watched this film recently with my wife and was stunned...moved to tears.  <BR>  I don't think (in my personal opinion) there is a more appropriate and heartfelt take on the father and son dynamic.  The acting is dead on and the musical score sould be placed in a museum of American art.<BR>  I hold a new place in my heart for this film and all that were involved with bringing this little slice of Americana to life.  What I wouldn't give to be able to play one last game of catch with my father.

B0089IGUP4|5|Another excellent CD from The Gaslight Anthem!  This one has all the power and energy of their earlier work, and expands on their growing musicianship.  Every song is good.  The first two songs, \\"45\\" and \\"Handwritten\\" are excellent.  If you're a fan, pick this one up ASAP. If you don't know them, pick this one up and you'll soon be looking for all their music.

I took off a point because the game is pretty unstable. It takes a very long time to load up, and if I pause to do something else with my phone, it won't let me resume where I left off. I have to quit and restart the game. The gameplay itself made it worth it. Great faotd.
1781162646|5|A perfect summer book. Short, engrossing, & satisfying. A young man who works for a summer theme park. An old murder, a sometime ghost, a psychic boy, and a broken heart. This book is like a scooby-doo mystery: you see it coming but you don't care because you love the characters, you love the mystery. Stephen King in high form. I will definitely be checking out more Hard Case Crime fiction. HCCF is a publishing press that nostalgically looks back at 30s, 40s, & 50s style hard-boiled mysteries. Short books that pack a punch. Definitely what I was needing.
B002MQYOFW|5|My son pushed me to read this book, he devoured all three and then saved up for the movie.We have a rule in our house, read the book first then you can watch the movie, but I had been putting it off because I felt the book's where geared more toward teens , and they were. But wow ! It has been one of the most creative books I've read in a long while, with lots of twists and turns .I highly recommend this whole set.
B007J4T2G8|2|I am having a hard time staying interested in this book. Just not my cup of tea. Too predictable for me.
B004J4WKUQ|4|Like reading a who's who of 80's pop culture all crammed into a pair of Chuck Taylor All-Stars. Enjoy it while it lasts.
B000HIVIOW|5|This is still the quintessential Christmas story, young and old will appreciate it. Excellent drawings by Raymond Briggs
B00I6JOBTI|5|What a creative movie!  Another film that adults can watch with kids without hating life!
B00H4M3GXK|4|Nicely done.
B006MW3UZW|5|the second season was even better than the first now that I know the characters. just love the show!!
B00AQ3K8IU|5|This was an awesome book! I loved reading it very touching story and heartbreaking at the same time. All I can say is amazing
B00NQKWAIQ|1|I ordered the CD/DVD but only received the DVD.
B006C5FWH8|5|It's been quite a while since Amazon posted a FAotD game that I had any interest in. I've always enjoyed FRP and military style games, so this one fits the bill. I also like turn based games in an era where every dev seems to think RTS is the only option.<br /><br />Templar Assault has several elements I like: turn based (as mentioned), the ability for individual troops to progress, the ability to tailor troops to particular situations, and the ability to employ sensible small until tactics.<br /><br />The only drawback as I see it is that the graphics are very simplistic. I know it's supposed to be retro, but a lot of early game development faced the limits of the hardware. Blocky graphics weren't a style decision, they were an accommodation to low resolution and limited colors. It would be nice to see this game in a more Diablo-like overhead slanted 3D, rather than something that looks like cardstock game pieces.<br /><br />However, that's a minor complaint, and you'll enjoy the game either way if the style of its content suits your interest.<br /><br />Recommended.
B000M5NRLC|4|Funny odd take on the original
B007D2XSW0|4|Good app.  Would be nice if it would post to facebook or twitter.  I am logged in bur says I am not.  Other than that I like it.
B00BLCHZC2|5|good stuff
B006R8GK2Q|5|I have come to love the hidden object games. couldn't stop long enough to leave a review until I had to take a bathroom break! love the hint option although I &quot;try&quot; not to use it.
6305882592|5|Classic  The pathos,the wisdom,so very human and so very noir funny.
B009KS4XRO|1|Not for me.
B004V9MU86|5|A very dark story, gripping and written from a very unusual point of view to say the least. Great book .
B009UX2YAC|5|It very fun and sometimes easy.
B002N1AERI|5|This album takes my breath away.  This is easily their magnum opus.  This album is so rich and amazingly complex, yet it never loses the melody.  There is nothing that I could say in this review that has not been said in other ones on this site.  I just hope that Epica did not blow their creative load on this album, because the album after this was quite a disappointment coming off the heels of such a magnificent masterpiece.  Nevertheless, no matter if the band goes creatively downhill or not, this will always be here as a testament to their incredible, bombastic talent.
B0028R3NCU|4|Very fast, no problems except the string broke off of the keyring part after about a week. Dont know why.
B009UNGYHG|5|Great case -  very compact and fits in coat pocket or purse.  Holds good charge.  Easy to determine amount of charge.
B003EY62II|5|This is a good cheesy movie, one that points out the importance of friendship and forgiveness. My 5 year old has watched it a good 30 times since purchase 3 weeks ago. and I still love Scooby-Doo myself, so it's one of those rare movies we can enjoy together.
0446608955|4|A very touching remembrance of life at seventeen, told by fifty-seven- year-old Landon Carter. Son of a senator away from his family most of Landon's life, Landon lives in the shadow of his family wealth he knows was acquired by his grandfather at the expense of many of the citizens in his home town. <br />Landon is painfully aware that his own minister, Hegbert as he refers to him, was one of the people his grandfather duped during a time when Hegbert worked with Landon's grandfather. Although Landon believes Hegbert preaches &quot;at him&quot; in every &quot;fire and brimstone&quot; sermon he gives, Landon &quot;unwillingly&quot; becomes associated with his daughter, perceived as a strange, religious girl Landon describes as plain, ordinary, and the kind of young person every adult admires. <br />Through his participation in the Christmas play, written by Hegbert, Landon begins to see this girl, who is not like anyone he knows, from a different perspective. And, in the end, we understand how Landon's life changed forever when he was seventeen. <br />I've enjoyed getting to know Nicholas Sparks as an author, who has portrayed feelings of youth we can remember and thoughts about the past that only come with age and experience.
B0094BB4TW|5|All I have to say is that I luv my Facebook.,,,this app works properly and never gives me any trouble...Im happy!
B0027Z2T8C|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this flick! The various scenes will having you laughing loudly. Be warned that the movie has English sub-titles, so be prepared to get you speed-reading skills warmed up and ready.
B001R6AW18|5|Always loved this. My Dad and I always watched when The Million Dollar Movie showed it. On TV mid sixty' 60s. My Dad and I were dysfunctional but this, Mighty Joe Young, and The Godzilla movies we both connected. The final line was beautifully delivered.'Twas beauty that killed the beast&#34;
B0027MJU00|4|Well written.  Subject matter very dark at times, which is the point, but more than I wanted.
B00DCRE8TW|5|Amazing Music!!
B00AEBBA68|4|If It Would Be Less Cheaper, It Would Be Perfect! Love The Movie. Disc Comes With Some Extra Features In High Quality. Would Recommend It To Everybody!
B00EMXBDMA|5|A fast read that does  a great job of making the Martian landscape feel real.
0802130208|2|What a slog it is trying to get through this book. I'm nearly there (I've read 3 or 4 other books since starting this)... the reason for my stubbornness in finishing it is that it came so highly recommended by friends, and the mostly rave reviews it's got here. Ignatius Reilly, the main character is interesting enough (that's why I gave it 2 instead of 1 star) but that has a lot to do with the fact that the rest of the cast and plot is so boring, I find myself flicking on the pages to see how far I have to go before the story gets back to Ignatius again. I keep thinking \\"OK, the side splitting stuff must be coming up soon\\"...there are humourous passages here and there but nothing to merit the accolades it has received here nor winning the Pulitzer Prize. I'm at a loss to explain its popularity.
B00IIUATDM|3|An entertaining jaunt through a hypermasculine world, though it never quite reaches the level of being critical of that world. The film seems to settle for merely acknowledging and celebrating, rather than critiquing. And through it all the audience is left to question if it all isn't just the ramblings of a delusional, egotistical mind. Great acting throughout, particularly from DiCaprio.
B0009KA7BS|4|Okay,    There are clearly a large number of Keanue anti-fans out there. That said, I actually liked this movie. Not as much as the first Matrix, but more than the second & third!    The storyline and the effects were good, and the supporting actors/actresses were great -- notably, Weisz, Gabriel, and Lucifer. I thought the final conflict involving Reeves, Weisz, Gabriel & Lucifer was top-notch. The resolution was also very creative. I agree there were a few \\"rough edges,\\" but if you can suppress your inner-critic for a couple of hours, you can enjoy this film.
B008602KQI|5|The movie is amazing and can't wait for the sequels!  I can't believe the acting coming out of such young kids!
1476746583|5|Super happy with the fast shipping and quality of the book.  I ordered this as a gift, and the recipient was extremely pleased to receive it.  Can't wait to read this myself.  Thanks very much!
B00OH75ATS|5|Loved it
B005S9EJ14|5|Great film. I really enjoyed this film and recommend it to everyone.  The actors are great and the setting is beautiful.  It is a little gem and a great comedic British drama.
B00NJT3A5Q|5|I love these guys.
B000002IJL|5|Great Sound Track with Awesome Music!
B00006F83Y|5|One of the best things to happen to Rock since Black Sabbath. Riffing, melodic, double entendres aplenty. I can't stand the moniker 'stoner rock,' but whatever it is, I like it!
1607747308|5|Awesome book!  We are moving and it really helped me get rid of a ton of stuff - and feel great about doing so.  I have read other de-cluttering and organization books and articles, but this one is truly life changing!
B004V6BQ3O|5|Works great with my Nikon set up. No complaints.
B005GFPZYK|5|Riveting and awe-inspiring!!  One of the best war stories I have ever read...up there with \\"Lone Survivor\\" and \\"Unbroken.\\"  Neil DeAbreu
0525953728|5|I could not put this book down! The writer made me feel I was there.....well almost. I will read this book again and I know I will find that I missed some tidbits of data. If you want to know, what I believe, to be the truth about the mission from someone who was there, then you have to get this book. The author seemed genuine and that he cared about how he was presenting the facts. It was easy to follow and the pictures in it helped me visualize the story.....I kept referring back to the charts and drawings. GREAT book!
B00D6SBOWG|5|Thus is a great game. A game the whole family will enjoy. Thank you for whoever thought of it.  The comintary for it is awesome.
B00008K78M|5|This is a wonderful video of Laura's 2001 concert in Assago, Milano, Italy.  She is in top form here, performing almost all of her best songs.  The duet of \\"Tra te e il mare\\" with singer/songwriter Biagio Antonacci is truly memorable.    The video and audio production are very good.  The video is 16:9 but is letterbox format, not anamorphic, despite what the cover says.  This doesn't detract too much, but I was hoping to see it enhanced on my widescreen TV.    This is highly recommended for any Laura Pausini fan.
B00000J2PH|5|love this
B00L9B7IKE|5|A must read.  Could not put this book down.  No surprise that it is on the best seller's list and will be on the big screen.
B00SCSVL9G|5|Excellent, Movie was good. Book is much better.
0756407125|5|After listening to the first orthe Kingkiller books on tape, I decided to read the second one. Both books are amazing and I highly recommend them. As for the vendor, I had prompt shipping which enabled me to keep the story going without missing a beat. I really like this book and damn I wish the last one was out already. If I had one negative thing to say it is that the main character is pretty shamelessly lame in the real-time aspect. I suppose the reader is supposed to feel sorry for him, but I only feel that he is retarded.
B0027BOL4G|5|I echo the sentiments of most of the other reviewers.    This film was INTENSE.    I have felt like crap from the age 25 onward and now I understand why.    I will never eat meat again.  I will eat more fruits and veggies.  I will buy local every chance I get.    Wow.
B002GHIPYI|3|They aight. But my Marshall headphones were raw. I think it's cuz the other ones were that good kush doe.
B00ARAO720|4|Is this a 'smart' movie?  No.  It's clever at times, but I doubt you're going to tax any brain cells.  However, this is an extremely 'fun' movie.  If you're expecting the Joseph Gordon-Levitt from Brick, Inception, Looper, or The Dark Knight Rises, you might be disappointed.  If you're expecting the Joseph Gordon-Levitt from GI Joe, you might be pleasantly surprised. Really, this movie is a PG-13 Crank mixed with a contemporary Gleaming the Cube for urban cyclists. If that description sounds like something you'd want to watch, I think you'll have a good time with this movie.  If that just sounds terrible to you, you're a boring person who needs to loosen up and have some fun.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character development in this movie begins and ends with &#34;I like to ride a bicycle fast and recklessly.&#34; Some movies would try to tack on more levels of character development here, but Premium Rush only gives a quick nod to the fact that he has a life beyond his bike.  But he is extremely charming while riding said bike. Michael Shannon is the perfect dirty cop.  Again, you don't need much character development here, he's channeling every dirty cop you've seen in another movie. And he's the perfect actor for it; he just has that creepy vibe you might recognize from his time on Boardwalk Empire, it's like the off-putting delivery of Willem Dafoe in Boondock Saints mixed with the poor impulse control of Gary Oldman in Leon/The Professional.  And there's some other people who like to ride bikes, or give people on bikes stuff, or chase people on bikes.  Really, the only other person you'll likely remember after the movie is over is Aasif Mandvi AKA that guy from The Daily Show (and Jericho, remember that show?).<br /><br />This is a chase movie, with wackiness and bike culture aplenty. And a plot point that either requires a previous understanding of hawala or a willingness to just overlook the need to understand it, as the movie is moving too quickly to stop and really explain that.  If you want to watch Joseph Gordon-Levitt be charming, ride a bike, and thwart Michael Shannon with his traffic predicting brain powers, this is the perfect movie for you.  If you're the kind of person who gets hung up on films needing a 'plot' and 'character development', you might want to sit this one out.  But you really should try and join us in the first group--sometimes you just need to turn off your brain to have a fun time.op and really explain that.

B00005JLXE|3|I liked the story and animation in the movie.  But hated the crew.  I'm sick of Marvel and there bad casting jobs.  Pick somebody off the street that looks like daredevil or the king pin, not somebody that doesn't suit the role.  Marvel has so much money and talent and they waste it on a bad cast.(exception, X-men and blade).  Get a director that really knows the story and the characters and then pick the cast.  The acting in the movie isn't too bad but they don't fit the profile.  That's why I'm rating it out of 3.  If I ever got in the movie business, I would direct good comic movies instead of the crap they're making.
B005LAII44|5|Great gift
B00DXLO0D6|3|THIS IS NOT A MOVIE.
B0000C7PQK|5|I haven't been one to really appreciate the words of others when<BR>they praise music because usually it's such a matter of personal<BR>taste but in this case I have to make a special exception. This<BR>is kick ass music that is just not able to be passed up! It<BR>screams for you to listen to it more. Even more so it is just<BR>this feeling of having no reason to listen but listening anyway,<BR>that enables us to feel what he is saying. This feeling requires<BR>no effort from the listener, just a few listens to get the gist<BR>of what Michel Cretu was trying to express.

B002LVUG3C|4|A very good special edition reissue, while I don't consider this album essential for Bowie fans, it is a historically important snapshot of David Bowie at the tail end of the 60s. The reality is, while Bowie kept at the singles market throughout the 60s, he was probably too out of sync with the sensibilities of the 60s to belong to that era. He began to find his voice with this album, but he would also have a ways to go before he truly arrived. First off, the title track is a truly great piece, not only a great song, but a great record as well. The team of Producer Gus Dudgeon, and arranger Paul Buckmaster delivered such an impeccable record, that Elton John and Taupin would soon snatch them up for John's series of classic albums. Rick Wakeman's eerie Mellotron blends almost perfectly with Buckmaster's arrangement. Producer Tony Visconti takes over for the rest of the proceedings, \\"Unwashed and Somewhat Slightly Dazed\\" evolves into a good up-tempo rocker, with some hot harmonica soloing and an horn ensemble. The fun little filler known as \\"Don't Sit Down\\" is tagged on the end of \\"Unwashed\\" as all one track, and this differs from the Ryko reissue from the early 90s.    \\"Letter To Hermione\\" is a plaintive ballad about the breakup of his girlfriend. \\"The Cygnet Committee\\" is one of the more interesting tracks, as it's theme would be explored again with \\"Savoir Machine\\" off of the next album TMWSTW, as well as some thematic aspects of Ziggy Stardust,  A messianic figure exploiting his followers, while his followers exploit him in kind. The song also seems to also be a scathing lament of the fallen ideals of utopian hippies, i.e. the outcome of Altamont, the career opportunism of Woodstock, etc... The electric Harpsichord work of Rick Wakemen is outstanding on this track and tends to get overlooked. \\"Janine\\" is probably the most accessible track, and for my tastes, the least interesting, and the track I tend to feel seems like filler. While not essential, I like \\"An Occasional Dream\\", while it seems a little dated, the Flute and recorder ensemble works well, and harkens to Bowie's Anthony Newley influence. The Newley influence creeps through on \\"The Wild Eyed Boy From Freecloud\\", I initially assumed that Paul Buckmaster was involved in the arrangement, being that it was the B side to \\"Space Oddity\\", and Buckmaster could be heard on Bowie's Demo, but to my surprise Tony Visconti was responsible for this epic, over the top orchestral arrangement.    \\"God Knows I'm Good\\" is a narrative about a shoplifting incident that manages to comment on rationalist thinking. \\"Memory of a Free Festival\\" is an odd closer, with Bowie's plaintive vocal and pump organ, that again seems to be a sympathetic lament on the idealism of the late 60s. The closing \\"Sun Machine\\" segment seems to reference \\"Hey Jude\\", as there's a horn ensemble buried in the mix to reinforce that impression. While there's a certain degree of studio polish on the album, there's also a kind of looseness present we would never see again from Bowie.     Peter Mew's work on the digital remaster is outstanding, with some added presence, and clarity when needed. The second disc is generous with it's selections, while a number of these tracks appeared on the Ryko issues, or the Sound and Vision box set. These versions of \\"Space Oddity\\" and \\"Occasional Dream\\" are demos featuring his brief partnership with John Hutchinson, This version of \\"Freecloud\\" had already been heard on the 'Sound and Vision' collection. \\"Let Me Sleep Beside You, Unwashed\\", and \\"Janine\\" are recordings from the BBC Radio D.T.L show, and rather good. Two mixes of \\"London, Bye, Ta, Ta\\" are included, although the track had already appeared on the 'Sound and Vision' set. A Stereo mix of  1970's \\"The Prettiest Star\\" with Marc Bolan is included.     A Stereo mix of \\"Conversation Piece\\" is featured, whereas the Ryko addition featured a Mono mix, this track is interesting from the standpoint of showing a confessional self reflective side to Bowie's writing that normally isn't seen. The electric re-take of \\"Memory of a Free Festival\\" is included, featuring the first time Mick Ronson appears, as well as a layer of moog synths, this was the other bonus featured on the Ryko 1990s issue, this version of \\"Memory\\" hints at the hard rock glam direction Bowie would soon take. A longer version of \\"Memory\\", from the original album, with a longer fade out is also included. Also included is an alternative mix of \\"Freecloud\\" where the vocal is brought more forward, and the orchestration less emphasized. The Italian mix of \\"Space Oddity (Ragazzo Solo, Ragazza Sola)\\", features an interesting mix of the backing tracks for Gus Dudgeon's production and brings this collection full circle.    The packaging, while missing lyrics, includes a great set of liner notes from Kevin Cann, as well as a timeline of Bowie's career during this period. As well as unreleased photos, sketches, and art work. The packaging certainly offers value for your dollar, but seems geared towards completists, or the very curious. Hopefully this will lead the way towards generous reissues of \\"The Man Who Sold The World\\" and \\"Hunky Dory\\". Recommended.
B008U7ZPHS|3|I've read all the books of this series, and either I am getting too old or the story is getting too immature for me. Slightly disappointed, but if you've read the rest of the series, you're sure to read this too.
B00DPM7TIG|5|One of the best book I have read.  I am a bit of a WW11 buff so I really enjoyed the French and German point of view.  I have recommended it to my friends.
B0042MEQVG|5|In great condition! I bought it as a gift for Christmas and is absolutely perfect for my aunt, considering it's new :)
B00DR0PDNE|5|This is a fantastic product. I got one and then I got another. And if I get the opportunity I will buy a third. Simple and easy to use.
B007HACDLK|3|A typically good Vince Flynn book.  His Mitch Rapp character is a little over the top but I still enjoyed the story.  I always enjoy Vince's books.  I am going to miss him.
B00BVYNSLC|5|great first season....strong supporting cast......a twist in every episode
B001PPLIEG|5|I will continue to do service with them. Fast service. There wasn't any delays. I highly recommend them to everyone.
B00ECU34ZM|4|I enjoyed it. I don't care what professional reviewers say, I liked it.<br />Awesome special effects, and I did like the theme
B00004W50T|5|I first heard this recording in the late 60s -- it spoke to me strongly then, and speaks just as strongly almost 40 years later.  I can't say that about many records made in those times.  I'm not nostalgic, I'm not a guy that sits around and listens to old Beatles and Rolling Stones albums... but I still love to listen to music from Big Pink on occasion, it just plain holds up over time. As a musician myself, I would disagree with some of the reviewers that this music is \\"simple\\".  It most certainly is not... the songs and performances are quirky and complicated, and so is the production.  The sound is a bit muddy compared to their later albums which were no doubt higher-budget affairs. (This record was made in a house, not a studio!) To me, Music From Big Pink was never really topped by the group, although it was equaled by the second album \\"The Band\\".   <br /> <br />I find it difficult to criticise Music From Big Pink in a conventional way. To me, the term \\"Americana\\" doesn't really cover it. There are elements of R & B, blues, country, hillbilly, and gospel but I can't think of any other record that blends influences and genres into a very special sound the way this one does.  Music From Big Pink has a mysterious and moody quality to it that is unique in pop music. It is not a familiar recorded sound at all, neither now nor when it was first released, and if you are new to this group, give this record time to grow on you -- I think you will be rewarded. It is a snapshot of an group that was just full of talent.  If you have never heard it before, tor the best impact I would stop the CD before the additional tracks play, they are interesting but I think they would dilute the experience for the first-time listener.  <br /> <br />If you like the Band I highly recommend the documentary DVD \\"Classic Albums - The Band\\" that gives some fascinating insight into the recording of the Band's first two albums.
B006OCM0G0|5|great game, lots of fun! only down part is having to buy gems. &ccedil;ant wait to expand and build up my restaurant even more.
B0002JP4L4|5|I'm not giving this movie 5 stars because of the movie.  Let's face it, it's 'Footloose' for heavens sake.  BUT it is one of those really great/crappy all in 1 80's movies that we've come to know and love.  And if can't watch this and come away comepletely loving Kevin Bacon, then there's something wrong with you ;)    All in all, DVD features are geat, movie is restored well. Great purchase, very well done!
1476727651|5|IMO, King has had a LOT of duds in his career - so many that I'd nearly given up on ever getting anything along the lines of Carrie, The Shining, or The Stand again.<br /><br />He did it with this book.  Such a great sequel to The Shining.  Was a wonderful read end-to-end.<br /><br />Ever since &#34;It&#34; King seems to love to include at least minimal allusion to either kids involved sexually or outright pedophilia - it's SUPER creepy (and not in the &#34;ooh that's a creepy novel&#34; way) and I TOTALLY don't get it.  There was a brief hint here again (Holleran reliving his youth), and it was completely unnecessary for the storyline.<br /><br />The book closes with a very open door to additional novels about &#34;the shine&#34; - I can't help but wonder (hope) that he has that planned....
B0051UP5NQ|4|Using [[ASIN:B0052P6DQI Toshiba Thrive 10.1-Inch 16 GB Android Tablet AT105-T1016]], entering review with Dolphin HD.<br /><br />While I would have preferred an application integrated with ANY cloud, this will do nicely.

For Thrive owners, that is storage/sdcard-disk0/Documents (you will need to set up the Documents folder on the SD card first, the application will create a folder in the sdcard-disk0 folder for you).<br /><br />I can now upload my monthly budget and expense worksheet, shopping lists, documents I'm working on - and not be tied to my oversized laptop.  There is a persistent process, looks like it is related to verifying if this is a legit copy (MS hello).<br /><br />For this complaining about permissions, these are to access your external storage, and to integrate your Google account.  After authorizing the application for access to Goggle Docs, you are good to go (watch that storage size folks) :-  1 star dock for having to do external work not documented (figured out on own), and persistent process (really not needed in a tablet).<br /><br />Happy Android Tabbing.

B00BAXFAJC|2|The Luminaries is overwritten and poorly planned. There is simply not enough substance to sustain a brief novel, let alone a protracted one.<br /><br />The characters are numerous but poorly conceived and bludgeoning us with exposition about their character faults and arrogance does not make them any more compelling. The men are written poorly but that pales in comparison to the disservice that our author does the women who are drawn haphazardly with complete indifference. Speaking of indifference that was my attitude toward every character and the 'mysteries' contained within.<br /><br />I am astonished that this novel won the Man Booker Prize. While I don't always love the selections this is the first prize winner I have read that I wish I had skipped. The quality of writing does not warrant the honor.<br /><br />If you are like me and feel obligated to finish every novel you start then leave this one on the shelf. If you are halfway through and wondering if it will get better, it does not.
B00GO8DIV0|5|Just awesome music.  I love José Gonzales and Junip.  Who doesn't love David Bowie. The soundtrack fits well with an inspirational movie.
B00004Y6NM|5|Fans call this cd Hodge Podge Bodge because Bodge is all over the place with different styles!<br />Now you know...
B008Y6U5AM|5|enjoyed
B000H7J9RQ|1|This is NOT for the US.  It is for other regions other than the United States even though it says on the back it is.<br /><br /> Amazon was wonderful as usual for returning my money back and sending me a return label (free of charge).<br /><br /> The DVD said it was NEW but I wonder why the packaging claims United States but the DVD was NOT....
B00003CXDZ|1|This looks like one of those movies that people either love or hate.  I won't say I hated it, but I sure didn't love it.  It's too busy, frantic and noisy.  The story is pretty thin and predictable.  The characters are mostly caricatures.  Some of the musical numbers were quite entertaining but overall, I felt that this was aimed at the viewer with a short attention span and a high tolerance for visual pyrotechnics.
B005IQZB14|5|Wow!  I wish I had read this book a couple of years ago when I first heard about it.  I loved reading about her journey to find herself and in the hike.  Now I'm ready to go on a hike!
B000JMLFLW|5|Nothing short of excellent. This book appears on most top 100 books of all times lists. It can be found on the internet in several eBook formats for free (including on the Adobe Digital Library format). A compelling story and a must read.
B001MW0J2O|5|it's both and more. it gets better each time i hear it. this is the best album i have heard since person pitch.    thank you animal collective for making me truly care about new music again for the first time in years.    melodies are extremely strong and catchy. great song writing. harmonies are occasionally breathtaking. album flow is perfect. built on a bed of vintage synth tones and drum sounds that sound classic but never stale.     this may be a challenging record for people who are used to stale, boring music but it is really not that difficult. in fact it is a great POP album. this album caught me on the first listen but that is probably because i was so ensconced it that i entered a hypnagogic state. i think this album could catch anyone though. if you want to get a friend into animal collective just keep playing it around them and not telling them. eventually it will catch them and they will ask what it is.
B00005JMCN|4|An enjoyable movie based on fact. A not so well bred horse steals the hearts of Depression hit America by simply winning.<BR>The only doubt I have is that Phar Lap also had a similar life in Australasia and a movie made about that horse was a huge hit twenty years ago.<BR>A well presented DVD surprisingly filled with alot of information on the movie and the horse Seabiscuit.
B0089EHWQE|5|I thoroughly enjoyed this romp through the fast flying pages and ended with a cleanzing cry. It was a wonderful boy-girl novel with a twist at the end but a great depiction of people changing people through actions of TLC.
B0054JZC6E|3|It's a fairly good game app given the variety of games. However some games seem ill-calibrated (if even a word) and are difficult considering how fast I'm used to playing games like fruit ninja and such. Still good, worth a try.
B00TFOKK0W|4|Solid album.
B00BEIYMZ6|5|Loved it
B004FRX0MY|5|Good
B00EE3FVSU|5|Fantastic plot, excellent acting, beautifully shot and tangible atmosphere. Perfect viewing if you're a Brit living abroad and missing home!
B008I34Y6W|5|Very briefly, some perspective is in order here. Sgt. Pepper was the Beatles' One Size Fits All. Dark Side Of The Moon was Pink Floyd's One Size Fits All. The truth is, this is the masterpiece against which all others must be measured. Roger Waters pointed out that Meddle was the album where Pink Floyd &#34;sharpened their chisels&#34; and were then ready to make Dark Side Of The Moon. I think The Mother's albums similarly prepared Frank to make One Size Fits All. That's all I'm going to say. I hope you will first go out and spend at least $30k on an audio system. Then go get yourself a copy of One Size Fits All.
B000002A3T|5|This is the best post-Roger Waters Pink Floyd production to date.  With Gilmour at the helm, this album adds some classic songs to the Floyd repertoire.<br />&quot;Poles Apart&quot; is perhaps the most memorable song on the CD.  It combines the lyrical touch of Gilmour's guitar with the typical melancholy timbre of his voice.  &quot;Keep Talking&quot; features a cameo appearance of none other than the [computer] voice of Stephen Hawking;  the Lucasian professor of mathematics @ Cambridge university.  &quot;High Hopes&quot;  portrays the bitter falling out (understatement) between Gilmour and Waters.  The fans of the Floyd who have kept up on the politics of the Floyd will appreciate this one.<br />For aficionados of the Floyd, I am sure I need not give any urging to buy this album, as all of you already have it in your collection.  For the rest of the people who may be either unfamiliar with the band, or only have a peripheral interest in them, this is a can't miss buy.
B003HARV3Y|5|This was a gift and  it was well received and loved. Prompt delivery. So much fun seeing the delight when it was given.
B002NZK5TG|5|I was young when I first saw this movie. All I remembered about Little Shop Of Horrors is the big plant wanting to eat people. I remember it was a funny and very enjoyable movie. I didn't seen it again till many years later. I bought this movie at Walmart for a cheap price. I popped it in asap and totally forgot it was a musical. I am not a fan of musical movies.... but LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS MOVIE. The songs are easy to remember. So it is fun to sing along!!!! This is a MUST SEE movie!!!!
B0000048CX|5|A lovely cd.  I find myself reaching for it often.  This is my first and only Yo La Tengo cd but I plan to purchase many more now.  I just hope they're all as pleasing as this one.
B006ID6NDQ|5|This is an amazing book and it is so well written. I read it so quickly, I couldn't put it down. I have read many first-hand accounts by victims of the Nazi regime and this is a truly impressive story. It is obviously very unlike most survivor stories but I appreciated Edith's honesty throughout the book. This is a very worthwhile read.
B000W25ASS|5|I love the Police.  One of their best albums in my opinion, only behind Ghost in the Machine, Zenyatta Mondatta and Synchronicity.
B00003CXI1|5|I am a 37 year old pastor and had never read any of the books. I knew there was a following of rabid fans, but hadn't gotten around to them yet myself. I LOVED this film. It perfectly captured the feel, wonder, magic and life of Harry Potter. It made me feel like a kid again. Too many kid's movies are dark, or have a hint of sex or profanity thrown in. This one was kid friendly. And the extreme right-winger's (who haven't seen it) are the only ones complaining of the the dangers of this movie. (Remember how bad the force in Star Wars was supposed to be?) It is chock-full of innocent fun. I could watch it again and again.
B000FC1HBY|3|Enjoyed the book.  Definitely took some interesting twists.  You cannot predict some of the turn of events.  Ready for the next.
B003O86FMW|5|I am on the 3rd book and am really enjoying this series. I recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good book without all the foul language. The story line has some gory ideals, but it really draws you in to what a post-world could be like.
B00C8S9W0G|5|Absolutely fantastic!!! As always, fast and furious... Yet touching and sincere! Great ending-
B0006IUDXA|4|a great buy, lacking 1 star because there was no extra features on the dvd, and the video and audio quality looked like it hasn't been touched from when i saw it 15-or-so years ago. however, it is macgyver and a trip down memory lane just doesn't get any better than this.
B000AMJDHY|5|I can't describe how amazing this is! Just you need this. It is Panic!'s best album. I love this. Get it!
B003VANOFY|4|Excelente headset
B00V4JJPKM|1|Monotonous music. Ridiculous plot
B0089LOG02|4|I enjoyed the book because I learned about history.  The author was talented by mixing new and old to tell her story.
B006BQI1V2|2|The makers of Sarah's Key have attempted to weld a grim, powerful Vichy story with a present-day NYC love story.  They failed.<br /><br />In place of what should have been two separate movies we have this.  A compelling and well-acted WWII story intersperses (as is the directing fashion of the day) with flash-forwards depicting the decades-later collateral fall-out on the family and the ones who came after.  My gripes are with the unexplained motivations of key characters: Why did Sarah kill herself 20 years later? Hadn't she come to the states to begin anew? What about the poor truck driver? And on and on.<br /><br />Then we have Thomas's character and her marital discord. It really stretches credulity to cast her as a new mother, doesn't it? What?!? At least she has stopped her trademark excuses for acting: eye-rolling and making funny faces. Then, toward the end, Quinn appears with his jarring, mumbling screen presence, grinding the movie to a complete halt. He actually apologizes to viewers for his poundage!<br /><br />All this sad, fateful suffering to bring these two witless lugs together! What a movie.
B000ATQYT2|5|This has to be my all time favorite Christmas movie.  We watch it every year as a family.  It's so well done and probably the best Muppet production ever.  Each of the different Muppets fit each character perfectly. It's as good as the book and better!
B009UX2YAC|3|It's a good game great way to pass the time. Can get very frustrating but quite addicting to. I like it because you can earn coins to unlock different characters
B009329Y30|4|Not a new formula as far as plots go, but some interesting twists and turns in getting there. Worth your time!
B0000009S3|5|If you already like Zappa, you must have this CD and if you want to start exploring Zappa this is a perfect starting point
B003LQ3YXU|5|&#34;Who&#34; doesn't?!!
B008JGSM6G|5|great fun for my brain and my kids! we have found it challenging but not irritating and have shared with others.
B0034G4P7Q|1|This movie does not deserve the hype it is getting.    Having now watched the movie and discussed it with many of its fans and read the favorable reviews, it appears the appeal of this movie is a) that it's \\"smart\\" and b) that it reveals the grand irony that the founder of the world's most popular social network is in fact a total jerk.     I was not impressed with the movie on an intellectual level. The movie is essentially about the creators of Facebook, and not about the nature of facebook per se, its hidden privacy controversies and the fact of that such a shallow and virtually useless site is so popular in our soulless times. These to me are intellectual issues worth making various movies about, yet interestingly enough they are issues fans of the movie are quite oblivious of. Instead we get a movie about the creation of facebook and the petty controversies over intellectual rights (among the creators) for the site. Mr Zuckerberg as portrayed in this film is indeed a rather interesting persona himself, yet this socially inept, backstabbing cyber genius smacks too much of an antihero, that bad guy you like. Is it any wonder that in a time filled with so many egotistical, narcissistic facebook and twitter bloggers that this movie has been heralded as best film of the year and Zuckerberg as 2010 Person of the Year? That to me is just depressing.     Visually, the movie has nothing to offer. It's just 100% of the time people in rooms arguing. What they argue about (the intellectual rights to facebook among the creators) is only very vaguely interesting. Director, actors and composer do everything in their power to make said talking appear profound by talking super fast in noise-filled clubs, but it didn't help (in fact it made it more difficult to follow). The ending/resolution is abrupt and highly anticlimatic.     In short, this movie lets facebook users feel like they've learned a great deal about the site without compromising their own role in the site. Peoplewho watch the film come out saying whatever they like about Zuckerberg, but in the end they'll go home to their computers, mindlessly refreshing their facebook walls, posting status updates that no one really cares about, and adding complete strangers with whom they have nothing in common to their \\"friends\\" list, without once questioning why they feel compelled to do so. Nor, moreover, will they come out any more enlightened as to the dangerous role Facebook has played in undermining our privacy. The movie aims the lens at the wrong people (the creators rather than the users), leaving us with little more than a movie about annoying people making money.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Excellent, easy read. Definitely worth it.
0515153656|4|Not bad - I enjoyed the read and will likely get other Reacher books but for now I'm going back to Steven King for a great read.
B00IIUATDM|1|Stupid movie.
B0013D8LOU|5|I saw the original production of Sweeney Todd - well the first national company (the production that was filmed at the end the LA run at the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion with Angela Lansbury and George Hearn) and fell in love with the grissly show.  It had style and flair and could not wait until the right director came along and filmed it.    Ten years ago when I heard that Tim Burton was interested in doing a movie of it, I knew he was the only director that could pull it off.  When Johnny Depp was announced as the lead, I first thought he was too young but then realized he was probably the correct age for the role.  Then I heard about the trimming of the show.  But I decided to wait and see the results.    The final verdict is this film was one of the best films of 2007.  Tim Burton did a masterful job of directing this difficult film.  While I did not agree with all the cuts, the only real complaint I had is the cut of the Prologue - The Ballad of Sweeney Todd.  This could have been put over the opening credits.  But this is a minor quibble. (By the way Burton should have won the Oscar for Direction)    Johnny Depp proved that he was up to the role of the Demon Barber.  He took the role and ran with it.  He created a three dimensional character who you sympathize with even though he does terrible things.  (Depp also should have won the Oscar for this performance.)    The only problem in casting was Helena Bonham Carter, she either hit musical sequences perfectly (A Little Priest) or totally missed it (The Worst Pies in London).  She is a great actress but just did not have the musical background for the role.  Mrs. Lovett is one of the most difficult roles in musical theatre.  She is a real monster.  She doesn't have the sympathetic backstory that Benjamin Barker has and it takes a very skilled actress (like Tony winner Angela Lansbury) to pull it off and Carter just came up short.    In the supporting roles, Timothy Spall was perfectly sleazy as Beedle Bamford, Alan Rickman was incredibly slimey as Judge Turpin and newcomer Ed Sanders was beautifly naive as the innocent helper Toby.  Sasha Baron Cohen has a too brief but crucial appearance as Signor Perelli, a former protoge of Barker and Todd's first vicitim.  Laura Michelle Kelly portrays the Beggar woman - in a role drastically cut down from the stage version.  Jamie Campbell Bower and Jayne Wisener portray the star crossed lovers Anthony and Joanna.    And for those that want to better understand film making technique, this is a film that is technically flawless.  This is a film in which the most important element is the lack of color, from the production design and costumes to the cinematography.  The choice of the exclusion of color created the bleak period that it takes place.    While I would have liked a more complete version, this is a great bare bones production. For those that want a more complete production, the Angela Lansbury - George Hearn TV production filmed at the Dorothy Chandler Pavillion is available.    Once again, if you want to see a great musical, a grizzly comedy or have a bloody good time, this is the film!!!!
B008MEM24S|4|almost as good as where's my water. more variety than than wheres my water. get it, you will like it.
B009ZQC7MY|5|I've watched Season 1 and Season 2 on-line at Amazon.com.  I can't wait until season three starts.  I will be watching this one too.
B008JGSM6G|5|Entertaining while not time consuming.  Provides short term entertainment while waiting for doctor's appointment, a cab, bus or airplane...etc. etc
B000QCQ8Y4|5|Fast paced Jack Reacher tale.  Some old characters brought back to lend intrigue.  Perfect read.
B004MC8CA2|1|I used to love this app but since the last update it crashes every time I try to access my plans. Please fix!  I have tried everything and nothing fixes it
0385349947|5|Lean In is an excellent book in pointing out the many barriers there are for women to achieve leadership commensurate with their abilities and that some of the barriers are self-created by women due to lack of confidence in their own abilities or fear of being perceived as too aggressive. The book gives some good motivation for women to overcome some of those barriers.<br /><br />Chapter 10 is titled: Let's start talking about it. I agree that one of the first tasks is to make more women aware of the behaviors that are holding them back, so they can take proactive steps. However, success will also require men to be aware of the barriers, so they can spot certain behaviors and adjust accordingly. I think most men believe they treat women equally to men even if the actual results show a bias. A male stereotype is: \\"If you want me to do something, tell me to do it. I don't pick up on hints.\\" Men should read this book, so they become more aware of the issues.<br /><br />The book discusses all the barriers in a men vs. women context. However, there are also many very able men who don't sit at the table, don't speak up in meetings, want to be liked and don't have self confidence that they can be a successful leader. The recommendations in the book applies equally to them.
B00M2OZLQK|5|A great album. Sounds new 40 years later. Great job on remastering.
B000068FY1|4|Great early Jayhawks album. Great songs! Must have.
B0027MJU00|4|A little slow at the start but picks up towards the end. Just love Flynn's writing style and this book does not dissapoint.
0553282980|4|I think it's in a way a good book because it's not so hard to understand and not a too simple text either. You can discuss its message!<BR>It was fun to read the novel, but it's not a literary work of art.
B00006J3WH|5|This CD is awesome for an avid Buffy fan like myself.  I am most appreciative that not only did they put out the music, they also included the lyrics in CD case.  For someone like me, who goes crazy if she can't understand what someone is singing, this was a major plus.<br />Also, the added tracks were great...I loved Hush as an episode and the music is what made it so great.  <br />Overall, I am very pleased that they put this on CD and have already listened to it numerous times.
0020444907|5|This amazing book takes you on a journey to a fantasy world of animated excitement. It is an excellent read for young ones as well as adults. There's plenty of epic adventure, with a storyline of no dull moments. The detailed narration was so vivid; it was as if I was living through the characters experience all of the action in real life.     I loved the characters, the storyline and adventures. There were also funny scenes that any audience can appreciate. This was a very good book.
B00910Y1OQ|5|Very fun little time killer and bug free on the kindle fire.  Limited permissions are needed, good graphics, good music, and fun gameplay.  Looking forward to more games from Playrix.
B00008G9JO|5|<br />Quite simply one of Tull's best.   <br /> <br />Granted, it leans a bit toward the \\"acoustic\\" side of Tull, but it has all the good trademarks of the best Jethro Tull music: Ian Anderson's characteristic flute, Martin Barre's virtuosic and streamlined electric guitar, syncopated rhythms with complex arrangements, insightful lyrics, and (especially on this album) that \\"earthy\\" feel. <br /> <br />My only complaint would be that Ian Anderson's voice has a bit of that flat and robotic feel that it does on the middle-era albums, less raw than the early ones and less free and relaxed than on recent releases. <br /> <br />I first heard the album when my mother bought it because of the horses on the cover; but perhaps a band rooted in rural living and named after the inventor of the seed drill (which contributed to the 18th-century agricultural revolution by making planting seeds more efficient) would do best with such rural themes anyway!   <br /> <br />Heavy Horses is also a nice companion to the more outdoorsy \\"Songs from the Wood.\\"  I see them as a pair, although I don't know if they were intended or created that way.  <br /> <br />
B000067J1H|5|I am not a huge Brad Pitt fan ... he seems to play the same characters over and over ... while his early stuff is good, very little stands out in his later career other than this!  Fight Club.  He and Edward Norton (who is fabulous) made this weird, far out in left field, playing mind tricks on you movie come to life!<br /><br />I usually don't like weirdo, off the wall movies like this but fell in love with this the first time I saw it... I could not tell which end was up or what was going on half the time until everything explained itself at the end of the movie.  What a surprise ending!!!!<br /><br />The only word that thoroughly describes this movie is \\"WOW\\".
B009CPJHY4|4|Nothing really fantastic about it but it did have its moments of interesting and smiles. A bunch of older folks decide they want to get away from their problems and build something of a new life. They do indeed find their life changing.
B0087JTAKW|3|This book was interesting. I love Mitch Albom's books but this one kind of disappointed me. It made you think ans had a good point but it was really hard to get through. I think the beginning par of Doe's story bored me, but the way he tied it all together was good. Liked the end but took me a long time to get to it. I usually read his books in a day. This one sat around for a while because I just couldn't get into it for so long.
B008K6HN8I|3|Have not had the reason to use it yet. But, I assume it is as good as all the other products I get thru Amazon.
B009C7ZQM4|1|This product iis ok
B00IX9UTLU|5|I could not put this book down.  I am ready for July to get here so we can read Hundson's point of view.
B00IU0M85C|3|Okay but the plot moves from interesting towards absurdity quickly.  Acting is better than the material.
B00FKF0F3C|5|I loved listening to this book.  Even though I lived through these times it was fascinating to learn more about those times.  Even though I finished the book I am listening to it again.
B00BAXFACO|4|In typical Connelly form, well written with a surprise ending. I love reading Michael Connelly books-haven't read a BAD one yet!
0871359448|5|I wish that Jim Starlin had the oppertunity to illustrate this one.  It brings all his former characters together. Warlock, Thanos,Pip the Troll.  George Perez brings a new perspective to his characters.<br />This one has it all. The destruction of the universe as we know it. It doesn't get any better than this!  Lady Death returns for a shock ending that should have stuck. If Marvel didn't revive Thanos, it would have been have a fitting end to the deadly character.  He exists at the end of the story.....but there is a twist I won't tell you about.
B000002I6V|5|This album is truly astonishing for one reason and one reason only.  It is a quality of work that Graham Nash never equalled before or after this release. <br /> <br />This is one of the four solo albums produced by the individual parts of CSNY on the heels of the release of Deja Vu, and with the exception of Neil Young's spectacular After The Goldrush it might be the best of them. <br /> <br />Rich with CSNY harmonies and the clear backing vocals and instrumentals of Crosby, Young and Garcia this is a standout release that showed Nash could indeed make it on his own, with a little help from his friends. <br /> <br />What is amazing that he was never again able to harness this level of creativity or originality again in his solo work.  But this appears to be the hallmark of Nash.  He had other pursuits to follow, including art, photography and Joni Mitchell. <br /> <br />Buy this album for a glimpse at what could have been a truly remarkable songwriting career if he had been able to repeat the magic heard here.
B00EEL0LGY|5|Love the game.  It's so much fun.  And it is something that an older person can play.  I can't figure out most of the games in today's world, but the developer made this one hard enough to have fun with it, but easy enough for anyone to play.  Excellent game.
B00KG41CZC|5|Diabolical!!!
B00DVKOYBM|4|You have to play this game for your self. If you like playing pool you will like playing is game.
B00992CF6W|5|Even though I don't know much about this game but it is still a great game I love it it takes awhile to do stuff for me but I'm getting the hang of it.
B0091REZMW|3|The game is just ok. Enough interest to waste some of your time, not enough to waste a whole day.
B007J4T2G8|5|This is an amazing book, that truly touches the heart. The passion and romance mixed with the sheer lust make it so you can't stop reading it!
B00B8WXG9G|5|I love Paul Anka music since a was 10 years old,when I live in Peru.All my classmate and whole school listened his songs Diana,Adan y Eva,Crazy Love ,you are my destiny and so on;All are fabulous.Now in this new CD Paul change  a litlle the original melodies but in a perfect way so is a deligth to our ears and feelings .Thank you Paul for this present  We love you.
B005OCHOZS|5|Ryan<br />Hard to put this book down. Full of inspiration, tips, and stories that have you on the edge of your seat.
B00ID4I6LA|1|I rented and watched &#34;Ender's Game&#34; this weekend and the shortest verdict I can give is &#34;barf-worthy&#34;.<br /><br />Just like with Peter Jackson's crappy rendition of &#34;The Fellowship of the Ring&#34;, I approached &#34;Ender's Game&#34; with low expectations and it still didn't manage to clear the bar.<br /><br />It's not just that the movie sucks compared to the book. I was prepared to forgive it any trespasses against the literary work it was supposed to be based on. The problem is that the movie can't even stand on its own legs. Like so many Hollywood adaptations of books with cult following, this one also turned out to be overhyped, badly directed pile of CGI and wooden acting.<br /><br />The greatest sin of &#34;Ender's Game&#34; is that it consistently fails to show instead of telling. Over and over, we are told how special Ender is, how smart and how empathic, how he's the only hope of the humanity, but there's only one scene, near the beginning, that even tries to provide us with any evidence.<br /><br />Adding insult to injury, Gavin Hood does his best to destroy whatever life and spirit Orson Scott Card breathed into his characters. Even though every kid in the book is supposed to be smarter than average, the movie portrays most of the boys as dumb bullies, whereas the girls are mostly cosmetic. The most egregious examples are Peter Wiggin, who is portrayed as an archetypical jock with an extra helping of psychopathic tendencies; Valentine Wiggin, who is there only to play damsel in distress in order to motivate Ender to get back to being a soldier; and Petra Arkanian, whose primary role is to create some vague sexual tension between her and Ender. In a textbook example of Hollywood's casual sexism, Petra's participation in battles has been dumbed down to teaching Ender the rudiments of shooting -- after which he miraculously becomes the equivalent of a Matrix character in his very first battle -- and shooting the Little Doctor super-weapon in the final battle after everyone else on the team has done the hard work.<br /><br />This is nowhere near the comprehensive list of the movie's flaws: I actually found myself making the &#34;Everything Wrong With Ender's Game&#34; video, in true Cinema Sins style, in my head, as I struggled to keep watching.<br /><br />All in all, it doesn't matter whether you've read the book or not: you can skip the movie &#34;Ender's Game&#34; and your life will be better for it. There are countless better ways to spend two hours of your life.
B00DVKOYBM|3|Game is OK. Physics is usually OK.
B00B5HQKNI|2|I fell asleep watching this movie, it wasn't what I had expected it to be. Not a memorable event at all. I guess not many movies are these days......
0307719774|5|I've ordered several of these to give as a gift and have one for myself. It's a great and fun way to keep track of what's going on in your life at different times and to reflect on how you have changed or stayed the same.
B002JIEYLC|1|I was debating whether I should purchase this version as an imported CD or the main one listed on Amazon.  Then I noticed that this one had one bonus song, a live version of Sweet Leaf.  I made the decision to purchase this version to get the bonus song.  Well, this CD does not contain a live version of Sweet Leaf or any version of that song at all.  I feel ripped off.  I am not giving this a 1 star review to criticize Black Sabbath in any way.  I just want people to know that if they are considering this import CD vs. the regular CD, they will not receive any bonus songs.  This is false advertising.
B00KHD5FK0|5|In my opinion this has been the best Marvel movie to date.  Full of action and a great story that blended a lot from previous movies. The 3D I have always felt looks better on the TV than in the movies and this one was impressive.
B00EJOCAYW|5|Bought this before it sold out and went up in price. I tried getting one last year for xmas gift and they were sold out. The only ones available where from third party sellers at a ridiculous price. Learned from last year and bought it early just in case. My nephew is a huge Minecraft fan and I know he will love this.
B00AA0TJO8|5|Downloaded this morning. This is a really fun game. I think this may be the one that stays on my Kindle Fire for awhile. And it was free. It is worth the money though. Good job dev. I find no complaints yet except I can't seem to save my place without restarting the level. Not a big deal, just makes me spend more time playing!
B001FB4W0M|5|Season four starts out with Dean breaking out of hell and the ramifications of what was caused while he was in.<br /><br />on Brother with demon blood in him the other with angels on his shouler. the fight comes down to not heaven and hell but brother on brother. when the fight comes down to the end of the season, once again, all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />the show is GREAT. i am glad i go hooked on it and hope this goes on a lot longer. if you are reading this and haven't seen an episode, you MUST start with season one or none of this make sense.<br /><br />there is pleanty of gore and evil, along with some very dark humor. deffinately a must see
B007GCY8FS|3|The book was a little long because of to much not needed details, but in true lee child and jack reacher style still a good read!

3848003686|5|Great Stuff
0316322407|5|This book is beautifully written, very personal and from the heart.  The young author is also able to convey the history with its injustices of her land to give context to the present situation there.  I believe this is an important book and hope high school students, young adults, and anyone who cares about justice will read it.
B00DURGZHW|5|Great movie
B003I55BIA|5|Let me tell you, I am not one to swoon so easliy, but this book screwed with my emotions, and I loved every second of it.
B0055B7K7A|5|Great family movie!
B00OH74BXY|5|lOVED IT !
B004RJMUJO|4|I love the game and loaded it on my Kindle.  But, there have been updates to it and they don't just come through, like they do on my phone.  So, that is the only big disappointment.  Otherwise, just spent three days sitting in a hospital with a sick child, and it got played a lot!  I'm improving!!
B005GFPZYK|5|Wow what a great way to experience a true patriots story,  I am so glad I took the time to read this
B00FEMJF6O|4|That being said, it is interesting and a good time waster.  I would recommend game to others.  Easier to make gold.
0804148937|2|Awful and predictable. Grisham did a bad job with this one...
B007THA4FI|1|Really disappointing. No. we did not expect &#34;Harry Potter&#34; but found the work dull and uninteresting. On the other had we do like her Cormoran Strike books
B00IKZX1ZI|1|THIS GAME IS WORSE THAN THE ANNOYING MUSIC IN THE MOVIE.
B00A3NQNUU|4|At least it isn't greedy. We'll see after a few more levels. The visitors are cute as they run around.
B0060MYM7O|5|The 2nd season was great would highly recommend can't wait for Third season to come out very exciting what a great value.
1401324649|4|If you are expecting a plausible story line don't bother reading this book. If, however, you are looking for a quirky, ironic, humorous, improbable, adventure story about a one hundred year old man this is it.<br /><br />The prose is a combination of uncomplicated, easy and straightforward as is fitting for the heart of the story because the hero, Allan Karlsson, explosive expert, is nothing if not straightforward and uncomplicated.<br /><br />Allan Karlsson climbs out the window of his old age home just as a celebration for his 100th birthday is about to begin. Allan is simply not ready to give in to any silly senior nonsense.<br /><br />Allan embarks on an adventure most of which comes about purely by accident with more than a touch of coincidence. During the course of his present adventure we come to learn of Allan's incredible past adventures as well. Some of which may seem absurd to the reader, but you will maybe ask yourself `why not?'<br /><br />If you look deeply you will find a moral to this story - a very simple moral as Allan suggests: \\"Whatever will be, will be.\\" And that is how Allan came to climb out the window at age one hundred and embark on an amazing adventure.

B003L77GGA|5|The final season... but credit must be given to the show for wrapping up many loose ends this season and also for laying the groundwork for Clark to continue to grow up and become the Superman we know.  Lots of extra/bonus material too.  One can only hope that this cast will reunite for some Smallville/Superman/Superfriends movies down the road.
B00DUGCLY4|4|great but sometimes it gets very confusing. I get stuck sometimes and I just cant figure it out. I did this review for free coins.
B00J2VSS0C|3|Visit places multiple times, which gives you practice and the opportunity to maximize rewards.  Wish more direction and explanation was given regarding rewards, artifacts, etc.

B009G41CG2|3|Fun to play
0790749998|5|This is my favorite movie of all time!!!! It has great actors, stunts and story. I highly reccomend this movie to anyone that likes action and kung fu movies. Jet Li rules in this movie and so does Aaliyah!!!!!
B000001Y2U|4|Every so often, a person who challenges the foundations we have built our lives upon strolls into the spotlight.  One of these characters is Marilyn Manson.  The album Antichrist Superstar is not only gritty pulse-pounding metal, but it is an album made to show society a reflection of themselves.  Okay, first of all, I'm sick of all these people writing reviews and commenting on Manson's life and perspective, which happen to be totally wrong.  Go read \\"The Long Hard Road Out Of Hell\\", his autobiography.  It is an amazing book which will put these ignorant rumors to rest.  Second of all, if you are pissed off because Manson is a Satanist or because his music is about torture, drugs, and transformation, you are obviously blind to the society you are living in. Manson has amazing philisophical and religious perspective and everybody should respect and appreciate that instead of slamming him for rumors such as he removed his ribs to perform oral sex on himself.  Even if you dislike the music, buy this album as brain food.
B000002A46|5|Wonderful music to work by.....or play by:)<br />I really likie Mariah Carey and have several of her CD's.<br />Worth the money
B00024I2Z4|5|I love the DVD Mulan that I purchased on Amazon.com.  I was pleased that the movie was shipped to me in a timely manner, and the that it arrived at my door in excellent condition.  Thank you for the great merchandise!  I highly recommend this seller.  I know that I will definitely make another purchase in the future.
B00BMT9SQA|2|Don't waste your time watching this on Instant- this movie was shot in 2.35 but is cropped to 16x9 here- yep, it's the HD equivalent of pan and scan that we remember so well from VHS tapes.
B00JQ8TQ1G|5|Loved this one it kept me playing for hours.  I haven't played one like this for a long time and hope I can find more.
B002VECM6S|4|A feel good sports movie. Not totally authentic, but I love the quirky characters and the cameos by actual college coaches. I will watch it several times a year!
B006LSZECO|5|Crazy twisted book. Must read.
B000FL7CAK|4|The last two episodes of the season were severely scratched and skipped so much that I bought the last episode to make sure I did not miss anything.
B005FITIMS|5|Certainly Pedro Almodovar is like no other movie maker on earth. I swear that you can pick his films out of a movie lineup. There is usually the sexual overlay, sometimes more obvious than at other times. Some of the women characters look as if they may not have been born women. On the other hand, some of the women are frightening beautiful (Elena Anaya as Vera is this film). And even in Almodor's most serious films, there is an element of comedy. (As in this movie, only a mother can identify her masked son by seeing his naked butt!)<br /><br />We can all rejoice to see that Antonio Banderas, whom I believe Almodovar may have discovered, is aging well. His understated ice-cold portrayal of a scientist set on revenge-- which is always best if rendered up cold-- is quite wonderful.<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"The Skin I Live In\\" is one of those movies that you cannot describe in detail or you will do a tremendous disservice to anyone wanting to see it. If you like Senor Almodovar, however, or if you want to see a film not like anything else you'll see this year, then you should quietly slip into your local theatre. You are in for both a visual treat and a plot that will keep you wide awake!
B00AREIAI8|5|A wonderful game overall. The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is fun and interesting
B007IXWL2C|4|If you're not into all the copy & paste sex scenes or the Sub/Dom thing, just skip to this 3rd of the Fifty Shades Trilogy. You'll have some catching up to do but it'll be fine anyway.

074356619X|3|This is an excellent prodcut for the money. I listen to it in the car while I am driving to work. It's a bit complex and confusing but I highly recommend it if you are looking for a good CD for positive motivation
B00LY9I7F6|5|Pretty good collection of short stories featured in this book. Some much more intriguing and interesting than some, but none were boring and dull. All had their own special something. Very enjoyable read. Highly recommended.
B000UJCALI|5|Hands down, this movie was simply a masterpiece.  Shelly and Jack did it.  What else is there to say?  ???
0553582038|2|Needs editing.  Dragged on.  Were it not for my enjoyment of the previous three books I would have put this book down.  The writer's style is still apparent, but his interest is not.[[ASIN:B004NDVLBC A Feast for Crows 1st (first) edition Text Only]]

B0060D2QR6|5|loved it. you should get it. if you like miley cyrus and liam hensworth then it is a good movie for you.
B00AB7HESI|5|Works great on the Samsung Galaxy Note 3! Occasionally, maybe once every fifteen times I play it, it will crash, other than that everything works fine. I was excited because Google Play doesn't have this in their app store, but Amazon does. I would highly recommend buying the additional add-on content too. Fun little game to play for hours or just seconds and way cheaper than the Nintendo version or buying it on Steam.
1478952733|5|Recently abandoned by his father, who moved out of the family home in Manhattan, Theo Decker, 13, and his beautiful mother are making it on their own in New York.  After Theo gets in a little trouble at school, he and his mother have an appointment at school to discuss his issues. With some time to spare before the appointment, the two stop off at the MET for a Dutch art exhibit.  Theo is not at an age where he appreciates fine art, but he does notice a pretty red-headed girl about his age and an elderly man who catches his attention. He is curious about the girl and the mysterious older man she is with.  So when his mom suggests they visit the gift shop, Theo declines to stay close to the young girl, and in an instant, his life is forever changed.<br /><br />After an explosion and the rubble which resulted,Theo is unable to get to the gift shop or locate his mother. He does find the now dying older man (Welty) who gives Theo a ring and tells him to take it to a place called, Hobart and Blackwell and to \\"ring the green bell\\", when he arrives.  Welty also tells him to take the small painting which had fallen to the ground after the explosion. The artwork is a priceless 17th century, one of a kind painting which depicts a little yellow pet finch that is chained at the ankle, \\"The Goldfinch.\\".<br /><br />Dazed in the aftermath, Theo now sees his life defined as \\"Before Mom and After Mom\\".  He is haunted by what has happened; he blames himself for his mother's death. Child protective services intervenes and Theo's journey to adulthood takes a most unconventional course.  From living with a wealthy school friend on Park Avenue, to being dragged off to Las Vegas by his loser, gambler father and his girlfriend Xandra, Theo's life is in chaos. The only comfort for him is, The Goldfinch painting, which he clings to like a security blanket.<br /><br />Theo has kept the painting hidden since the tragedy, for it reminds him of his mother.  But, what can a young man do with a priceless piece of art like The Goldfinch? For a number of years, he keeps it safe, and gazes at it occasionally in private, until years later when, a seedy friend from Theo's teen years in Las Vegas resurfaces in New York and has a plan.<br /><br />In The Goldfinch, the reader is transported on a spellbinding journey into the lives of The Barbours, the wealthy, Park Avenue family that took young Theo in. Hobie, the antique dealer and former business partner of the elderly man who died in the explosion, who gives Theo a place to live and work when he returns to NYC. There is also unpredictable Boris, who Theo befriends in Las Vegas after Theo's loser dad and girlfriend take him from NYC to live with them.  Both boys are left to fend for themselves, and except for the occasional left overs that Xandra brings home, their consumption seems to consist primarily of food they can steal or alcohol and drugs.<br /><br />Told from the first person looking back, The Goldfinch follows Theo from the ages of 13 to 27.  From New York to Las Vegas, back to New York and even on an international journey to Amsterdam.  The author creates a memorable cast of characters and imagery. The characters are so well drawn, the writing is fabulous and both colorful and suspenseful.  For me, it novel was, at times, an emotional journey. My heart went out to Theo, even when he made some poor choices along the way. I loved the way the novel drew me into the world of art, and although it can't be considered a happy story, it is a story that, for me, had a very satisfying conclusion.  So far it is probably one of the very best books I've read in 2013, even though it was well over 700 pages -- I never felt bored.<br /><br />Be sure to read this one.iceless piece of art like The Goldfinch?

B00FFHG6KQ|5|I have always loved NBA games, but this one, is the best Kindle game ever...and I mean this to. The graphics were AMAZING for a tablet game! The gameplay is awesome! Everything is just awesome! Can't wait for updates to come out. Worth the cash, the wait, and the pain of learning it! But enough  of me...get this game today!!!
B00DC7NNAC|5|This was the first time I had used the streaming video.  The initial set up was easy and the movie played just as expected.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend.....even for the tech challenged, it was easy!<br /><br />The movie was entertaining and beautifully filmed.
B00000JCB2|3|Limp Bizkit has been receiving a lot of recognition lately, and for no god damned reason.  Being on MTV almost every day when all their lyrics talk about is &quot;my girlfriend broke up with me... we rock! &quot; it's  hard for some die-hard rock fans to exactly take this band seriously.   Although the bad rap at Amazon.com they're constantly getting with some of  the reviews is not deserved, and I should tell you  why.<br />&quot;Re-Arranged,&quot; the best song on the entire album, is a  journey into the soul of love and heartbreak, and actually has some  meaningful lyrics (not present in &quot;Nookie&quot; or &quot;No  Sex&quot;).  It's one of the only reasons I bought the damn album.  I liked  &quot;Nookie&quot; at first, but soon became sick of it.  &quot;N 2 Gether  Now&quot; is just damn sickening, and if you ask me, this song has  absolutely no point at all except... well, no point at all.  The rest of  the songs are practically nameless except for &quot;Nobody Like You,&quot;  which should have replaced &quot;All in the Family&quot; on Korn's  &quot;Follow the Leader.&quot;  It's as simple as that.<br />I'd also like to  make a statement on &quot;A Lesson Learned,&quot; the albums closing  &quot;musical&quot; track.  If Limp Bizkit produces some more stuff like  that and &quot;Re-Arranged&quot; with some more meaningful lyrics that  expand over a larger horizon, then the third album is something to  definitely look forward to.
B005WUHAX8|3|The LifeProof case does everything it boasts. It's waterproof - I've taken it to the beach and the pool and have taken great underwater pictures. It's shockproof, I've dropped it from over 6 feet and my phone has miraculously been fine - with no chips to the case. It's sand/mud proof, I've gotten my phone dropped in a mud puddle and beach sand and both washed off - with Dawn soap at that. I work at the hospital and can spray my phone down with Lysol and keep it sanitized when necessary.<br /><br />BUT..... It just doesn't hold up as far as vigorous use. Now I'm not talking about dropping it and soaking it down everyday. I'm just talking about normal and everyday use without worrying about water damage/damage to the phone. I've had three so far. The first two only lasted about 4 months with different issues on each one. The first case I had managed to get a crack on the bottom flap by the charge port one morning when I pulled it off of the charger too quickly in a morning rush. The crack made it no longer waterproof. Something I used frequently. However, one call to LifeProof and bam, I received a new one. All they needed was the serial numbers located on both sides of the case. My second one lasted about the same length of time - only this time the inner layer that seals the phone was broken after only the second time opening the case. These cases are not designed to be opened very often. I opened it once to put the case on, the second opening broke the seal completely - I was at the apple store and needed the phone out of the case. Once again, LifeProof replaced it again so overall the customer service is great. The warranty on these cases is great, just be prepared to become LifeProof's customer service BFF because you will be contacting them alot if you plan on keeping the case on with heavy use.
B009UX2YAC|5|[[ASIN:B00CV8ILAK Subway Surfers]]Subway surfed is SO much better than temple run. This game is a great substitute for people like me who never liked temple run. It's very cartoonish- which makes it great for young children. That's all I have to say. I want to get back to playing Subway Suffers.
6302902010|3|In checking the info on P&amp;B, I noticed that it will be coming out soon on DVD only.  Why is it not coming out on VHS?  I have been wanting this film for many years and did not know why it was never in print.  I figured  it had something to do with the estate...guess I was right, according to  another reviewer's info.  I never saw the whole movie; I believe I saw part  of it on TV many years ago before it was pulled.  Would really like to see  it out again; I guess there is no soundtrack, either, for the same reason.   I do have a cassette of the operatic version.

B0064MPXFA|5|I love this show because it is just good drama. It isn't dark like Breaking bad or deep conspiracy plot like Scandal, or soap opera like Grey's or Desperate Housewives. I love these shoes, but sometimes they are too unrealistic for me. Good Wife is smart, deep, complex and serious, while remaining believable.

B0055D3EOG|5|The horror genre has a lot of paranormal type movies out right now. The movie Insidious takes a twist on the old haunted house stories and turns them on their ear. Instead of an old house that was once the sight of a grizzly horrifying series of occurrencs....it's the innocent young child that becomes haunted! It seems as if \\"I see Ghosts\\" is a family trait that can be handed down.  At first they don't understand that the boy has been literally frightened into an unresponsive state. But after the child falls deep into a comma that has no discernable cause, and no signs of awakening, the parents find out that the father was once plagued by this rare insight into the \\"Further\\" a place where the evil dead are stranded in limbo...forever, reliving their nightmarish deeds over and over in the darkness of the purgatory type place.<br />  The child is there.<br />  And he's stranded. And there are some really, really, nasty stuff in there with him.<br />  The only way to save the child is for the father to go in after his son. But first he has to have his childhood memories restored of His own battle with the dark legions. With  the help of a psychic team, (right out of poltergiest) they commence a battle that carries over into Insidious 2.<br />  My advice, rent them both together and watch them in sequence. Awesome flick! Together, it's the makings of a story that is truly frightening; a couple of nights of real nightmares for the viewer.
0545123275|5|I enjoyed Shiver so much! It's the YA paranormal romance book that comes through for you, unlike Twilight. The characters were realistic (plus, the teenagers seemed very normal and acted like regular high schoolers, except for Sam). The werewolves were definitely unique compared to wolves in other books and movies. The plotline was good, and it didn't include the typical fight/war scene or enemy that has become a little too common in most paranormal books.<br /><br />Grace has always been fascinated by the wolves that live in the woods behind her house. She hates when they disappear for the summer. When she was eleven, she was attacked by those wolves, and one of them saved her. Ever since then, the yellow-eyed wolf has always been \\"her\\" wolf, and seemed to always watch over her. But then the wolves attack Jack Culpeper, who is the typical rich, snobbish jerk at school. He died, but then his body disappeared. One day while Grace is out in the woods she hears him yell out, and then finds a new wolf in the pack. And as hunters try to kill off the wolves for killing Jack, Grace discovers Sam, naked and with a bullet in his neck from the hunters. She takes him to the ER, and it soon becomes apparent that he is her yellow-eyed wolf. The werewolves are wolves when it is cold and humans when it is warm, but each year they need more warmth to transform back into humans. Eventually they stop turning back, and this is probably Sam's final year to be human.<br /><br />The idea for the wolves being human when it is hot out was a great idea. Not only is it original, it also set the stage for one of the biggest conflicts in the story: Sam changing back into a wolf for life. He has to fight to stay human. There were a couple weird parts about changing, especially when another werewolf goes out into the cold and doesn't change. He seems to be even more sensitive to the cold than Sam, as he couldn't even open the front door from it being too cold. The wolves' minds are also different than the humans. They have some problems remembering stuff from their human lives, and vice versa. Their means of communications is sharing mental pictures. It sounds a bit like Twilight, I know, but there are limitations. No abstract ideas and no names. Instead, there are instincts that don't even allow Grace to get close to Sam.<br /><br />Grace was also bitten by the werewolves, but she has never transformed. It at first sounded like there was a quirk with her, almost like (again, Twilight, I'm sorry) Edward not being able to read Bella's mind. There's a possibility that it's not quite like that.<br /><br />The people seem mostly normal, for the most part. Grace's eccentric painter of a mother is always busy, and her father is always out. She has to fend for herself and manages to keep a guy in her house for days without them realizing. It's a little unrealistic, in my opinion, and also slightly overdone. Grace's friends are very normal together- they aren't always sure what to do, they have a couple fights between each other, and so on. Sometimes they are a little crazy and hyper. They need coffee. And so on. Sam and the pack are all a little different because of their different lifestyle. He grew up being homeschooled in the summer, when he was human, and most of his interactions were with other werewolves. Sam enjoys language and words because for a large part of his time, he can't use them, but he will make up little poems or song lyrics. I'm a bit of a poet myself, and unfortunately you can't just come up with good, rhyming lyrics off the top of your head like he seems to do. It takes a little bit of time to write the four lines with all of the right phrasing and sounds. One of the most minor details in the book that I didn't enjoy. Sam and Grace seem normal most of the time, but at times it becomes obvious that Grace is quiet and doesn't like a lot of people while Sam is almost a little too sensitive, bordering on emo or being a loner or something. I likethis quality about them- they seem relatable while still being themselves. The facts that the two of them have \\"known\\" each other for years and that Grace actually has friends and fits in somewhere are pluses in the book. There are just too many stories where the new girl meets the supernatural boy and they end up together.<br /><br />I enjoyed one part of the story where Sam is reading a bit of German poetry to Grace, because of how it sounds. While reading the translation, he breaks off and says that he doesn't like this translation. Because I know German, it was interesting because I know exactly what it meant. I feel like there would be a difference in how you take that scene and interpret it based on whether you know the language or not and if you understand the whole quote.<br /><br />I would have to say, try this book. If you liked Twilight, you'll enjoy this. If you didn't like Twilight because of the annoying characters, you'll enjoy this. If you thought the vampires were a little too tame in Twilight, you'll enjoy this. If you found Stephanie Meyer's lack of mentioning one specific topic that comes up in all too many YA and adult books childish and naive, you'll enjoy this (I'd say that this is on the same level as The Vampire Diaries TV series on that subject, so if you're ready for a book a little more mature than Twilight or have seen the series, you'll be fine). If you haven't read Twilight because you were told what a lousy book it was or didn't want to get caught up in the craze, you'll most likely enjoy this book.

B004A8ZWW4|5|It's Rock'Em Sock'Em Robots the movie! There isn't a merchandising partnership (who failed on that deal?!), but that's almost what this is. But that doesn't even begin to explain the greatness that is this movie. Fun story, cute kid, good acting-- this movie was an absolute blast. I bought it for my sister before she had seen it, I was so sure she'd love it-- and she did! Totally recommend!
630512762X|4|Highy suspenseful, original and thrilling, \\"Face/Off\\" is not just a play on words for its own storyline: its a grand-action masterpiece! Filled with high-speed thrills, explosions and guns, the pace never slows down, even when you don't hear the sound of gunfire pulsing in your ears. A stellar cast heads the way of this film, which adds to the emotion and heart behind it all, and under the direction of John Woo, famed for action and intensity, the movie is stylish as well as exciting. <br />Sean Archer, an FBI agent in Los Angeles, has a score to settle with terrorist Castor Troy that is personal as well as criminal. Upon catching Troy, Archer learns that there is an array of bombs hidden inside a building within the city, and only Troy and his imprisoned brother know the whereabouts of the devastating explosives. In an elaborate plan to determine the location of the bombs, Archer agrees to undergo a top secret operation in which his face will be surgically removed and replaced with that of Troy's making him look identical to the villian. Once inside the prison, his mission is complete, until Castor Troy pays him a visit with his face masking his true form. Archer, now trapped in the prison under the identity of Troy, must find a way out and bring the true criminal to justice before he harms his family and takes over his life completely. <br />This is one of those movies that you must pay strict attention to from the very beginning, or you will miss out on a lot of key elements, such as some of the turns that each character takes under their new identities. One of the best elements of the movie is that you will find you're not inclined to root for the actors as much as you root for the character of Archer himself; the fact that the two actors play both parts makes rooting for one of them difficult, for they each get a shot at playing the bad guy. <br />The story does have a strong premise behind it that is believable and contains a high level of suspense and action.The intensity begins with a high-octane chase at an airport, lots of explosions and gunfire, all mixed together in the story to create a fast-moving ride of thrilling suspense. The running time of the movie doesn't even seem a problem, because there is never really a dull moment throughout the movie; even the slow-paced scenes with the real Archer and his family have a significance that will play out in later scenes when the characters are switched. <br />The acting abilities of the two leads are specially showcased here, with each one getting to play different personalities and characters of different lifestyles and backgrounds. John Travolta is superb as the good-guy-turned-bad-guy, matching his performance in \\"Broken Arrow.\\" We believe that Travolta is an ideal family man in the beginning stages of the film, and his care-free style and wit come right out when his character changes, and Travolta pulls this off in a great fashion. Nicolas Cage takes on the role of bad-guy-turned-good-guy, and his sentiment and emotion when he takes on the role of Archer shine through the entire film that you almost wish he were the good guy from the very beginning. <br />The supporting cast for the film is also a terrific addition to the story, with powerful performances by Joan Allen, Dominique Swain, and Gina Gershon. Allen plays the wife of Sean Archer, who plays a key part in discovering the secret of the \\"husband's\\" identity. When she is required to become emotional and tense, Allen does a great job of conveying the emotions. Dominique Swain, while not having much on-screen time as the daughter of Archer, plays out the rebel teen angst with incredible ease. Gina Gershon is a great asset to the film, as the lone female bad girl with past ties to Castor Troy. <br />\\"Face/Off\\" is one of those movies where I found myself cheering in the end, while also crying when everything comes to an end. The mark of a good action movie is one that has a wallop of emotion behind it, and this one meets that mark. I found myself having fun while staying completely interested and enthralled throughout. Take my word for it: it never stops moving for a second, and it's fun!
B00999DFP0|1|This was not a legitimate DVD set. These poor quality DVD's could not even play on my Macbook. Even when I did manage to get them to play on my PC the quality of the video was not even that good. The picture was a little grainy and it also had a couple moments where it would have audio glitches. The covers of the Dvd set (btw there is not even one holder its 5 individual sleeves) were the only thing that actually looked like the original thing. The cases that housed the actual dvd's was extremely flimsy and cheap. The plastic was not even cut to properly to fit the exterior of the case, there was excess hanging off of the sides; and the covers inside the plastic looked like someone had printed them out on a home printer with extremely cheap printer paper. Overall, i am extremely dissatisfied with this purchase.<br /><br />P.s It took almost 2 months (1 and 2/3 months) to get this pile of disappointment
B000IYU9HW|5|From the first moments of watching this movie, I fell in love with the characters. They were both beautiful, smart and young. The chemistry between them was really wonderful too. The movie unfolds beautifully and just when you think you know how the movie is going to end, it surprises you with a tear jerk ending that left me crying for another five minutes after the movie ended. I highly recommend this movie. They don't make movies like this anymore.
0684872153|5|For some unknown reason, I resisted reading this book for a long time. It was only when I realized that a movie had been based on this book, that I decided to read it. (For a book is always superior to any movie ever  made)<br />I knew I was hooked when I read the first two paragraphs - I don't  know if it was the power of those paragraphs, the fact that Irish is my  heritage or the fact that I had occassion to talk to a friend of my  mother's who is originally from Ireland and came to this country 20 years  ago.<br />It is amazing to me that the circumstances in this book are so  relatively recent.<br />While many of the remembrances of Mr. McCourt are  terribly sad (I have relatives who lived through similar circumstances) - I  must say that I literally laughed out loud at a couple of things that he  recounted. This is what we do to survive - remember the funny things (and  sometimes recount them in an even funnier way).<br />This book also touches we  all have to deal with to one extent or another. Dysfunctional families  didn't start with the 1990's.<br />Above all, as an American, it made me  remember why everyone across the world for the last 200 years sought to  come to this country. I cannot imagine what it must have been like, and  indeed still is - to arrive in this country (with all of its promise) to  look up and see the Statue of Liberty and the shores of the United  States.<br />For anyone who thinks this must be a truly depressing book, try  it. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.
B00EHMFC78|4|Sadly, I figured out the ending about halfway through.  Still a really good book.  Two separate plot lines was awesome
B003LQ3YXU|4|In some ways I like Chris Eckelson's Doctor better than David Tennant's. Please don't get me wrong I like David Tennant's doctor but I would have liked to have seen this doctor grow over at least a couple of seasons. Still it was an excellent kick start to a series reboot
B009X2U1I2|4|Watching it now I did not like the cg, but it was great for it's time. This movie is underrated. I am sure if they rebooted the series now, it would do much better. Especially with today's cg effects. It is entertaining,but if you do not know the hero Spawn, I would recommend you rent it.

B001FB5634|4|For me, the ending left something to be desired, but the movie was still fantastic. I have not read the book, but I would like to pick it up at some point after watching this.  Subtly suspenseful with moments of real terror, this kept my heart racing!

B000002JSV|5|Lets make it clear to the reader who is not familiar with AC/DC: all Bon Scotts albuns with AC/DC are clssics of rockn roll, with their unique blending of Bons hilarious and original vocals and the straight ahead rocking guitar of the Young Brothers. Everything AC/DC released after Bon died is almost nothing compared with the albuns up to HIGHWAY TO HELL, with the exception of Back In Black. Their creativity began to wane immensely, altough they released a lot of solid albuns. ( I dont know why on Earth they chose a guy like Brian Johnson, who cant write good lyrics nor sing at all, to replace Bon. If they didnt want a copy of Bon, its easy to understand - they would never find it !! But to hire a guy who just cant sing, go figure ...) Well, back to The POWERAGE album. This is wonderful. After the opener ROCKN ROLL DAMNATION, we got the stuning &quot;DOWN PAYMENT BLUES&quot;. Everything sounds fresh, hard and spontaneous in this album ( the last one, for a long time, to feature brother George Young producing ). Amazing.
B007XKEY6Q|4|I love this game it was soliloquy fun until it ran out of words! it was the same words over and over again! please fix this!

B00FDPK2JQ|5|Every song is absolutely AMAZING!!!! These girls sing with so much skill and conviction. Their style remind me somewhat of the old &#34;Destiny's Child&#34; but they surpass them by miles with skill. Every one of these girls are super talented. I thoroughly enjoyed this CD and the empowering message for women. I can't wait to see them in concert. I no longer have to wait for Envogue to get back together again. I can put all my hope in Little Mix now. Just hope they will bring a concert to the US. Buy this CD. You will not be disappointed. Every single song is a hit.

B00640UICA|5|When I load a new app I test it myself before letting my children play with it. I was happy to see no advertisements, one of the first things I look for in an app for my 3 and 5 year old children. I like that once a level is complete and the next level is unlocked, one can go back and play the prior levels. I had planned to set up the app for my child to start from the first screen but my daughter asked if she could play with my phone one day and set herself into the app from several levels in and figured out how to play and how to finish the games tasks with no direction from myself or directions from the app. She enjoyed bringing smiles to the faces of the characters in the app as she helped them join hands. I love that the color of the character changes along with it's facial expression to tell you if it is still looking for a friend to hold it's hands. We love puzzle games and it is a welcome app that brings cheer with minimal stress. Great app!
B005LAIHZE|4|Yes vampires are old news but you never saw a former president slaying them! A little slow here and there but on the whole, very entertaining.

1400063515|3|Many other reviewers here at Amazon and elsewhere have done an admirable summarizing the key topics addressed by Taleb in his book on the \\"Black Swan\\" -- his metaphor for events that fundamentally could not be predicted by the mechanisms that humans (including scholars) use to understand past events and frame their expectations for the future.  Therefore, I won't spend additional time rehashing these topics.  Overall, I feel that Taleb makes some compelling points about the problems of experiential induction, \\"winner take all\\" effects, and probability models centered around the Gaussian or normal distribution.  He also provides some useful examples and thought experiments from everyday life that illustrate these problems effectively.      However, I feel that the main downfall of this book lies in Taleb's frequent but unfocused references to philosophical and literary figures and concepts that seem far too obscure to appeal to the average reader.  The author's choice to constantly fling these references at his readers, as if he's desperately seeking to demonstrate his intellectual pedigree, detracts from the clarity and thematic unity of the book and can be both dull and downright confusing for readers, as in the case where Taleb invents the story of a fictional French-Russian philosophe-author as evidence of the \\"Black Swan\\" effect with nary an explanation for how such a story provides greater value than a comparable example taken from real life (or even no example at all).  This meandering, half-philosophical half-practical style, combined with Taleb's sometimes-tiring and often unprofessional sarcasm and derision for those who have yet to see and apply the (admittedly valid) wisdom of his points about randomness, left me with scarcely enough patience to get through the entire book.  I felt that he could have communicated his ideas in equal detail but with greater impact (and less self-aggrandizement) in a book half or two-thirds this length.       In short, Taleb's main ideas are interesting and worth considering, but don't expect this book to give you a pithy pitch about the influence of randomness on the world.  The book is ultimately as much or more concerned with the philosophical implications of this randomness than it is with how you can protect yourself against randomness (or alternatively, leverage it to gain some benefit or advantage).  While that might not be a negative thing for a book about philosophy, I found it distracting and disappointing for a book in a more mass-market nonfiction genre.
B000051VWW|5|peaceful natural and very appreciated at a time when so much music is contrived and manufactured
B00IKZX1ZI|5|This game is fun for all ages, The more you get into the different levels it becomes a little bit harder. Every move must be calculated very carefully planned. You run out of moves, before you run out of ice cubes. I'm on level 44, most of my levels have three stars. I do have to go back and finish a few more levels to try and get the three stars. Great game!
B00005JLEU|5|I like a lot of the movies put out by Studio Ghibli and Disney. It's a very good movie about a little girl who learns not to be afraid.
B00FRQ32N4|4|I really enjoy this game. It is free to play, while there is in-game purchases, with a littlest patience you can do most things without real money.
0451196716|5|I am no fan of Stephen King. I don't hate his books, but I think this is the sixth book of his I've read, and the first one I've really enjoyed. I got 80% through [[ASIN:0451169530 The Stand: Expanded Edition: For the First Time Complete and Uncut (Signet)]] before putting it down in boredom. I tried twice to get through [[ASIN:0452284694 The Gunslinger (The Dark Tower, Book 1)]] and failed both times. I've never really understood his appeal and haven't had an interest in reading anything else by him, but when someone told me the premise of The Long Walk - I was so intrigued I had to try it out. After finishing it, I finally got a glimpse into some of the incredible story-telling that King is capable of.<br /><br />Written under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman, the premise of The Long Walk is that America is a different society than what we currently know. On the surface, every aspect of it seems the same with two exceptions. The first, is that there was some type of war or military/government event in the past (which King only alludes to), and second, the premier sporting event is a yearly event known as The Long Walk, in which 100 teenage boys are chosen to walk as long as they can until only one of them is left standing, which is a foregone occurrence since contestants are shot if they slow down too much. The obvious draw to this story is the event itself. Why would anyone choose to compete in it? Well, The Prize is the obvious answer - anything you could want for the rest of your life. But even so, the odds are so overwhelmingly against you it seems insane that anyone would compete. The majority of the book is an exercise in character development. King spends an exhaustive amount of time slowly developing the characters and providing insight into their motivations and backgrounds. The main character, Ray Garraty, is developed through his interactions with his fellow contestants. One of the most interesting concepts about the story, is that these are not professional athletes. These young boys have not spent the last four years training for the Long Walk. King makes no references to their being jocks or physically superior to other average teenage boys. Some of the boys do mention taking practice walks, but it is clear that most of them have never participated in anything like this until they start out that morning in Maine on April 30. The winner of the Long Walk is not gifted with superior physical endurance, but emotional and mental superiority.<br /><br />If King has any other novels like The Long Walk, I would definitely be interested in reading them. It is a very quick read and one that I honestly couldn't put down, as the intrigue never slows down for a minute. I also found that my mind was continually thinking while reading. King would detail a concept or rule of the long walk, such as the rule about outside people interfering with a contestant, and I would sit there and think about all of the different implications that could occur from such a rule. What if a contestant hired someone who had nothing to lose to run out and attach a competitor? Could contestants carry extra shoes with them? What about different ways they could use the bathroom while walking and now slow down? My mind was active the whole time I was reading it, and even after finishing it. I really love when a book challenges me creatively this way, and I'm not just engaged in \\"passive reading.\\" For anyone who wants an exciting and well-developed novel, I would definitely recommend picking up a copy of The Long Walk.thletes.

B00HB62MC0|5|(Quote)Ugly Love becomes you. Consumes you. Makes you hate it all. Makes you realize that all the beautiful parts aren't even worth it. Without the beautiful, you'll never risk feeling this. You'll never risk feeling the ugly. So you give it up. You give it all up. You never want to love again, no matter what kind it is, because no type of love will ever be worth living through the ugly love again.<br /><br />Every time I open a Colleen Hoover book, I expect to be touched, surprised, and many times ruined. It almost intimidates me and makes me afraid to start them since I know I am going to be overwhelmed in some way. This was no exception. The writing was perfection, lyrical, and poetic. The story sucked me in, had me totally invested, kept me wondering, and pulled out every emotion. Yes, she did it again....and in a totally different and unique way than anything she has written before.<br /><br />Tate Collins is starting a new life as she moves to San Francisco for school to advance her nursing career. She is going to stay with her brother, Corbin during the transition. Upon arrival, she literally cannot miss the presence of Miles Archer, who is passed out just outside of her brother's door. She soon sees that this man is harboring pain that he cannot hide while he is drunk. Not the best first impression. In the new light of day, Miles is quiet, guarded, and stoic. He is her brother's good friend and fellow pilot.<br /><br />(Quote)I have no idea what's going through his head. He never smiles. He never laughs. He doesn't flirt. His face appears as if he keeps a constant veil of armor between his expressions and the rest of the world.<br /><br />But as they are around each other more, an attraction begins to boil under the surface. And they both think they are strong enough to pursue the physical without complications. She is busy and career oriented. He has vowed to never fall in love again. There only two rules are: Don't ask about his past and never expect a future. Simple, right? Not so much.<br /><br />&#34;I just don't want to like you. I don't want to like anyone. I don't want to date anyone, I don't want to love anyone...&#34;<br /><br />Their chemistry is volatile, their passion consuming, they can't keep each other off their minds even during separations, and they even like being around each other. But Miles is going to fight anything more with everything he has. He never wants to be hurt again so has strong walls built around his heart.<br /><br />They are complicated not only by his past, fears and avoidance. But also by the fact they are keeping it a secret from her overprotective big brother that adds a forbidden aspect to the whole situation.<br /><br />They struggle, contradict themselves, hide their true feelings, and avoid reality just to have moments together. It's not supposed to be something real or more. He can't and won't let it be. His past demons have such a hold on him that he can't move on unless he can let go. But after six years of pain, guilt, loss, and heartbreak is that even possible?<br /><br />(Quote)It's as if the pieces of the guy he used to be bleed over the guy he's trying to be.<br /><br />Miles was such a complex character, he was really like two different people in his past and present. My heart ached for him. Like Tate, I could see him wanting to break free, but trapped and unable to do so. His non spoken communication held such weight and showed things he could not admit to himself or her. His body and heart gravitated towards her, but he felt the need to push away and protect them both. I hurt when he cried. And just the fact that such a strong male character cried and felt such desolation just ripped my heart out. I just wanted to soothe him. But every grin, smile, or small moment of happiness he exhibited began to heal it. And I wanted nothing else but to see him finally crack open, spill his secrets, purge his pain, and begin to move forward.<br /><br />&#34;If I was capable of loving someone... it would be you.&#34;<br /><br />Tate was a really strong female character. She knew she was continuously walking a dangerous line between enjoyment and heartbreak. She tried so hard to be what he needed while also not losing herself, but she had such a kind and giving heart that it was impossible not to fall for the broken boy. She stood by him at times he did not really deserve it, pushed him when she could, and accepted his flaws and ghosts.<br /><br />(Quote)I knew. She was either going to be the death of me...or she was going to be the one who finally brought me back to life. The only problem I had with that was the fact that I didn't want to be brought back to life. I was comfortable.<br /><br />There is a love story within the love story that was both beautiful and heartbreaking. It was a story of an optimistic loving young man who was gutted and vowed to never put himself in a position to love and lose again. It was painful, intriguing, and gut wrenching. Miles in the present was so closed off emotionally and mysterious, and it took a long time for us and Tate to learn his full story. And then there is the present love story of second chances, finding hope, healing, and learning to live again.<br /><br />&#34;...God gives us the ugliness so we don't take the beautiful things in life for granted.&#34;<br /><br />This book was written in such a beautiful, engaging way that it times it was literally poetic from the phrasing to the way the words were displayed on the page. It was told in Tate's point of view in the present and every other chapter in Mile's voice as we gradually learn about his past 6 years before. Miles in the present is such a broken man. But we also see a younger, sweeter, devoted, in love Miles at eighteen. So we see two love stories building past and present with men who seem totally different. And we know at some point they will converge and it will be something that changes everything. It builds up this layer of mystery ofwhat happened to turn him into this damaged, scared man. And then we finally get into Mile's head in the present for the last twenty percent of the book. I was so ready for that!<br /><br />This story sucked me in, held me captive, and I could not put it down. I stayed up way too late reading it then went to bed still thinking about it and had a book hangover for a couple of days after it.<br /><br />I enjoyed some of the side characters. Cap was one of the most unique, sweet and salty side characters I have ever read. I loved his wisdom, humor, and straight forwardness. I really liked her older brother, Corbin and his best friend, Ian. I would actually like to see them get their own stories. Young, personable, hot pilots? Sounds good.<br /><br />This was yet another amazing, poignant, heartfelt, hopeful read from Colleen Hover with complicated characters, an intriguing unique story line riddled with mysteries that packed a serious emotional impact. I felt so much of everything: pain, frustration, sadness, anger, devastation, fear, trepidation, tension, love, friendship, hope, forgiveness, and happiness all at various times. It broke me, put me back together, and made me believe in the beautiful things in life overcoming the ugly. She always manages to coin some phrases that hold such meaning and leave you in awe. The whole idea of ugly love itself is a theme that runs deep and makes perfect sense in the story. And there is another short phrase (that I do not want to quote here since it could be considered a spoiler perhaps) but it involves falling in love. Brilliant. And she gives us the most touching, breathtaking epilogue that left me both smiling and in tears at the same time. Despite the fact that I have loved every Colleen Hoover book that I have read, I have to say that this one surpassed it. I could not find fault with anything. It was perfection and worth more than 5 stars and becomes one of my very fave reads of 2014.
B001FB4W0M|5|I highly recommend season 4 of Supernatural.  My husband and I have seasons 1-3 on DVD.  The only thing my husband didn't like about the blu-ray vs. DVD is that there isn't a \\"play all\\" option.  You have to go back to the menu and select each episode that you want to see.  The quality is very good though. We watched the whole season in about a week, it was really good! I can't wait for season 5 to come out on DVD/Blu-ray.

B00004S3AN|5|Although I'm not what I consider to be a great fan of jazz, I have enjoyed Dave Brubeck's music for quite some time. For the last two and a half years or so, I have bought almost only high resolution music (DVD-A or SACD), and was determined to buy this disc soon. For a short while, several years ago, I owned the standard CD version of this album - until I donated it to my father-in-law. For anyone reading this reveiw, I can confirm that there is little comparison possible between the CD version of this album, and this SACD version. Please note; this is an SACD, and not an SACD hybrid. This means that a dedicated SACD player is required for playback, unlike the hybrid SACDs where at least the CD layer can be accessed with a standard CD player. If you have an SACD player, and a half-decent set of speakers, I can't imagine how anyone would fail to be impressed. The clarity of the recording, and it's 3-dimensionalism is amazing. It is really like having someone play in your living room. For those interested, this disc offers a stereo and a 5.1 audio option, and comes packaged in a \\"standard CD\\" jewel case - unlike many SACDs which come in so-called \\"Super Jewel Boxes\\". My universal disc player is set to default to multi-channel playback wherever possible on SACDs or DVD-A, and I have therefore not listened to this disc in stereo. The multi-channel mix though is very subtle, and most of the sound comes from the front speakers, leaving the rear speakers to help create a surround effect. This works perfectly well on this disc, and I coudn't imagine how it would work any other way.     If you like Dave Brubeck and have an HD audio player, go out an buy this album. If you don't yet own an HD audio player, go out and buy one! It's high time that the standard CD hurried up and died, and made way for music only on the hi-res formats such as SACD or DVD-A!
B008JJM88Q|1|this game was a lot of fun but then it got weird. When I wanted to stop it,  I couldn't get it to stop.  Then the music kept playing even when I had stopped the game.  I got nervous that it might be spyware so I tried to delete it from my phone.  I couldn't do it.  I finally had to go into my settings and get rid of it.  Buyer beware.....  Amazon,  you should not endorse this product.
B00006674X|4|I caught this movie on American Movie Classics when they were having an Elvis movie marathon. I have to say this is one and very few GOOD Elvis movies.<br />In this movie, he's not some struggling musician with 40-year old women helping him along. I think if he wasn't a puppet with the strings being held by a certain manager, he could've made more movies like this one.<br />True, he does sing a little, but it's a hobby for his character. I don't think I can say any more than what the other reviewers have said, but take my word for it, this is one and very few good Elvis movies.
B008UCJ7KO|5|Great book!!!
B00B1ME3DQ|5|I didn't know what to expect, but of course being a Clutch fan I was going to buy it regardless.  I am no music reviewer, but let me say that on first listen I was blown away at how great this album was.  Short, rockin, catchy tracks.  I listen to it all the time. Clutch still rules...
B004VQK9XW|5|I do not think this Sixx AM cd is better then the first, but, it is very close. This cd is really, really good. I like the concept of the cd. Nikki Sixx is a tremedous artist. These guys have magic together. If you you liked the first Sixx AM cd, you will like this one alot too. The last song on the cd, Skin, is an unbelievable song. Very emotional. The words are touching.

0688156819|5|A short review for a short book seems in order: here, Master of the Odd, Tim Burton, has created a small volume of poems in the style of childhood rhymes, depicting the bizarre and often tragic lives of various horribly or abnormally formed children.  You have a living voodoo doll, a robotic bastard child, a child born instead as a mummy, a half-oyster boy, and so on, all struggling through what could only be described as grotesque mockeries of human existence.  You sympathize with these individuals because the world so clearly does not, and feel badly for their seemingly inescapable suffering. <br /> <br />But the nasty, evil part of you enjoys it all the same. <br /> <br />Utterly unique and definitely worth a read.
6305127638|5|If this is the death rattle of the Trek franchise, then it deserves to be mourned, because Mr. Frakes pulled something rather special out of his hat with this one. From the moment the truly beautiful score starts up, this  film is polished, exciting, engrossing, and slick. <br />Special effects are a  tad patchy, but at their best rival anything short of 'The Matrix', with  CGI finally pulling Trek into blockbuster realm. Acting is solid, and is  raised to extraordinary heights during one scene between Picard and Lily in  the Captain's Ready Room, which is simply superlative drama. It may be the  best scripted- and acted- scene in Trek.<br />So the humour falls a little  flat at times, and the normal Trek mantra of thoughtfulness and  caring-sharing gets pushed to the rear. So what? This is a stylish, smooth  addition to a legendary genre, and is the 90s equivalent of The Wrath of  Khan. If only they could have kept it up . . .
0307352153|5|Susan Cain's book on introversion is, in my estimation, an indispensable resource on challenges introverts face in an extroverted world. The book is well researched and written. The five years it  Cain took to write is evident. I was surprised by the amount of research Quiet contained, and the extensive research serves as a testimony to a self-avowed introvert.<br /><br />Cain organized the book around  four main sections. Part One, the Extrovert Ideal, covers the cultural propensity toward extroversion. Part Two, Your Biology, Your Self! covers biological factors of introversion. Part Three, Do All Cultures have an Extrovert Ideal, explores other cultures and whether there are cultures that are more introverted. Part Four, How to Love, How To Work, gives guidance on how to live as an introvert in an extrovert's world.<br /><br />One of the main points Cain made was that introversion is not something to be cured or fixed. It is a temperament. She points out not only the contribution introverts have made, but how their temperament is essential to society. Introvert's quiet contributions have literally changed the world. Through many encouraging chapters she helps introverts to embrace their temperament, find their voice, and contribute. The book addresses how extroverted cultures create challenges that Introverts must understand and adapt to if they are going to reach their potential.<br /><br />The book was comprehensive, covering everything from biological factors to how to succeed in an extroverted world. She also addresses raising a child who may be an introvert. A wonderful take away was her suggestions on public speaking.<br /><br />The book is well researched, however, I wish the references to the endnotes were in the text. While not having references in the text, does make the book easier to read, it makes further research more difficult. Also, not having references in the text makes it difficult to know which statements had research and which ones didn't. That is my only critique however.<br /><br />This is an excellent book and resource for both introverts and extroverts. I recommend this book to those who know they are introverted because it gives suggestions and guidance on how to embrace one's introversion while living in an extroverted world. I recommend this book to those who work, or live, with introverts, and anyone who has to lead or manage people. Extroverted leaders and managers have much to gain through this book. By understanding more about the introverts, and their potential contributions, both introverts and extroverts will find their world enriched.
B006LSZECO|4|a really good book. an unsuall story, interesting plot, suspense, and very original ending. its definately a worth while read !
B0086DBE62|4|it was great! my fave character was the queen, also i love that actor. it was good because they built the movie around the basic snow white love story, but it had more character and more action. i also loved the 7 dwarfs!
B003L16FAE|5|Love it
B00A2IUHM6|5|Loved it in the theater, and love the unrated version even more.<br />A must see; especially for &#34;Family Guy&#34; fans.
B009Y2KGSQ|3|I'm a long time Aerosmith fan and was excited to know they were doing a new studio album, but this album was a disappointment.  The songs remind me of vintage 70s Aerosmith but the songs don't have the same energy that made their music awesome.
B0009R1T7M|4|The song Chicago is probably worth the purchase price of this album. <br />I was in Bali in September 2006 and a local girl I met listened to that song on my MP3 player and cried because it moved her so much. I can understand the sentiment.
0937381888|5|You will not regret this purchase.<br />I find myself looking at it several times a day.<br />It has answered every question I have came up with for home brewing.<br />Love it!
B0091XT8F0|5|Great songs, amazing dancing, funny, entertaining, silly and visually stunning! One of my all time favorites--one of nearly everybody's all time favorites!
B001PU8N0I|5|This is another great Dickens story. The DVD quality is excellent and the price was as cheap as you will find.
B001PJ3S3G|1|I am not going to go  track by track to waste anyones time describing what I thought (think) about The Empyrean other than to give one piece of advice - Do not waste your money on this!!!    This comes from a person who is a big fan of \\"stripped  down\\" music that does not sound like a polish turd due to the technology of Pro Tools.    I love music that sounds authentic and not adjusted.    I have tried to get into John's music time and time again, however it just sounds like a bunch of kids from Pittsburgh trying to write and record on a Tascam 4 track from 1989.    The album should also come with a suicide warning; or for that matter, razorblades.    If there was some type of money back guarantee, I would be first in line.
B0094BB4TW|2|though honestly I should probably give 'em thanks for weaning me off of FB. the newsfeed never shows in its entirety and usually I just get annoyed and give up.
1400063515|2|Mr. Taleb makes some interesting statements but I'm glad I didn't buy the book. What comes across in a most repetitively annoying way is an enormous axe to grind instead of an argument to make. \\"Only I know\\" seems to be what shouts from every page and after a while it masks the important contributions his book could have made if he sounded a little less like a know-it all adolescent.      Mr. Taleb seems to be caught up in other people's past evolutions. Another reviewer points out correctly that the Gaussian models have lasted so long simply because we lacked the computing power to develop more accurate models. Other models certainly exist now and we should play with them, but making blistering rebuttals against people whose contributions were limited by the physical and mental technology of the time seems to me like calling Edison an imbecile because he didn't go straight to the development of the MP3.     I'm not a computer whiz, mathematical modeler, or Nobel prize winner. I'm just a speculator who has made a living at being right in the markets for over 30 years, all of it the result of self education through observation. Maybe I would have made more money over the years by being more mathematical. But I've found that it isn't the mathematics of the market that is as important as the psychology....what people think of their models of the market. If people want to believe in Black Swans, Myron Scholes, or Ed Thorp I really don't care. What I make money on, what every speculator makes money on, is the fact that I know what model is predominant in the minds of most other traders regardless of any connection to any so called objective reality. What speculators make money off of isn't models but other people's belief in them. Which explains why despite waiting for the next unforseen event....which by definition can't be predicited...we mere mortals watch the EIA reports, and employment numbers, etc. because other people are making decisions based on them. Are they right? I don't know nor care...I only know that I ignore their beliefs at my peril.     Speculators understand that our knowledge of the markets is imperfect. We know that our failings aren't the result so much of failing to see answers but failing to forsee relevant questions.  We are all at some time blinded by our model/map of what is there...the quest for exact knowledge blinds us to systematic wisdom.  We all tend to over estimate what we know, or can know and so overestimate the permanence of our current trends or models upon which they are built. A speculator like me may not know the mathematics of dynamic hedging and how it should fit in with chaos therory but I know that my judgments of necessity must be \\"fuzzy\\" enough to allow for the possiblity of the \\"unplanned\\" model that is or maybe unfolding in the market. In this sense I agree with Mr. Taleb's apparent goal to expand and evolve new models. It's just that he could have done it with a little more grace and with a simple respect for the ideas upon which he will inevitably build his own models.
B003MXAQJW|5|Good representation of today's dysfunctional family.  Didn't pull any punches and covered the spectrum of extended family.  Convincing portrayals by these actors.

B0070Y46UY|5|Read it when first published, rereading now before going to see movie.  Still feels like a gut punch, but i had forgotten how elegant and visceral the prose, how spirituality infuses every corner of Pi's consciousness.  can't wait to see how the movie compares.
B006LSZECO|5|Full of twists and turns. A good read.
B000XUBC5E|5|This could be Coben's best work.  I have read 4 of his books and someone is missing in every book.  Great read but he needs to come up with a different subject.

B009DT98RK|5|I recently got a new TV and blu-ray player and this disc was a Christmas present.  Putting this disc in for the first time, I watched the entire FCA song line-up all the way through...there was no stopping this one! The major thing I want to say in this review is that the band Frampton has currently/on this disc is, IMO, as tight and rocking as the band he had on the original 1976 recording...Bob Mayo & John Siomos, R.I.P. - they were some big rock & roll shoes to fill but these guys carry on their tradition wonderfully.  If you're a fan of the original album (who isn't?), you need to get this Blu-Ray disc now, play it on a good system, crank it up and it's almost like you're there - awesome, great job guys!

B00B2V66VS|4|Overall, I really enjoy this game. The only complaint I have is that sometimes when trying to use the &quot;save me&quot; feature, it goes blank and starts the game over. It can be extremely frustrating. Especially when you've gone a great distance. Oh well, I can't complain...it was free! I still would recommend it to anyone.
B0089EHWQE|5|Holy .. I have not cried as much in a novel these days as I have in this one. This is probably one of the most perfect and original books out there. It is one of the cutest & heartbreaking books ever - I don't want to gush too much, but I loved this book from the first chapter. I had purchased it from my bookstore since it's a highly popular read. It is about Louisa who seems average, but her curvy body is emphasized a lot. Will is a man who is in a wheelchair. In the synopsis, it states he has shocking plans of his owns. I didn't want to think this, but the thought that automatically came into my mind was euthanasia.<br /><br />A paralyzed man with shocking plans ..  I have always been against suicide, and I don't like encouraging willful suicide, but when someone is paralyzed it makes me re-consider everything I believe in. It's easy to say one shouldn't commit suicide, but we aren't in their situation. I do still believe one should be stronger, but I don't like to judge. Of course, being in a wheelchair can teach you to be more humble, and giving - but it can be more depressing than anything.. Imagine being aware that you cannot move at all.. It makes me feel that people, including myself take things for granted such as, hugging a person, dancing, eating, and moving in general. It seems so little to us because we're used to getting it..<br /><br />I was a babble mess at the end of this novel, it depresses me but teaches me to be more grateful and enjoy life while I can.  It's an incredible novel. Louisa and Will are complete opposites, their romance was uplifting and inspiring. Will's choices weren't inspiration to me, they were signs of weaknesses, but the love they had between each other was amazing. It started off as Will disliking Louisa, because he did not want another caregiver. He was used to being independent before, and now he has completely given up on his life. Louisa tries to bring the little joys of the world back into his life. I loved both of their characters. I would have liked an alternate ending, but the ending it had was sufficient enough.<br /><br />This is one of THE best novels to be ever written, I would love to see a movie of this. This was a painful novel to read, prepare tissues for yourself!<br /><br /> This is a heartbreaking novel that helps you re-consider your evaluation of life and helps you appreciate all the little things in life. The writing is amazing, but the book itself is perfection. This is a classic novel that is powerful. A novel everyone should read, a perfect 5 out of 5 stars.have liked an alternate ending, but the ending it had was sufficient enough.

B000E6ESL2|3|Stay is a wonderful movie to watch, by which I mean, it is a wonderful movie to look at.  Cinematography is superb, the entire film seems distant and surreal, a feeling reinforced by the haunting, chilly blue/gray wash.  Art direction is equally inspired.  The architecture and interior design are eye-popping - this is certainly a well-endowed university/hospital!  Add to this the clever, (if not painfully and blatantly clever), camera moves where people, settings, and situations morph into one another - and you have a film that is eager to delight the eye.<br /><br />The problem is that this is the only part of you that is delighted.  I won't give away the gadget, such as it is, but I will say that the nature of the gadget necessitates a distance from the protagonists, all the key players are held at arm's length, even the tormented Henry.  Everyone we meet in Stay has gone through some sort of catastrophic event, and yet, we feel no sympathy at all.  This is because we never get to know them; all we're really aware of is the deliberate confusion.  The movie is staggeringly slow; it is rather like watching exotic and beautiful tropical fish swirling lazily in a tank - if one of them eats another  - who cares?<br /><br />Ryan Gosling is very good as Henry, but one wonders why he would reprise his role from the splendid film, United States Of Leland, so blatantly, seems risky.  A really terrific cast is given almost nothing to do, Naomi Watts, Elizabeth Reaser, Bob Hoskins, and Janeane Garofalo appear - and I use the word advisedly - give us the benefit of their recognizable faces, and disappear.  Ewan McGregor, a fine actor, makes the most of the limitations inherent in his role by giving a panicked performance worthy of a trapped Hitchcock hero.<br /><br />Director Marc Foster gave us the brilliant Monster's Ball, where character and stunning imagery propelled every frame.  His Finding Neverland had appeal, but certainly did not occupy the same rarified atmosphere.  In Stay, something very, very different is going on.  Character does not drive action, action, or lack thereof, drives character.<br /><br />Beautiful to watch, fairly interesting gizmo providing the big reveal, the \\"aha moment.\\"  Ultimately it reminded me of the old joke, \\"You've got a right to think your wife is being unfaithful if you move from New York to California and realize one day you have the same mailman.\\", very different is going on.

B00H9671YQ|4|A good movie about personal rivalries, but not a great movie about racing.  It could have used a little stronger dialogue and tighter editing.
006176759X|5|If you like the reality TV show The Hills then this book is for you.  L.A. Candy is written by Lauren Conrad who starred in the MTV hit, Laguna Beach and then had her own reality show called The Hills, which followed her in her exciting day to day life in LA.  If you have seen The Hills there are many parallels in the book.  Many of the characters in the book are similar to her friends and enemies on the show. Lauren Conrad keeps the reader entertained by creating new twists and drama in the book.  Also if you enjoy Gossip Girl, the show or the books you will like L.A. Candy.
0684833395|3|This book is difficult to review because it swings between funny anecdotes and horrific descriptions of war. There is also much extraneous material to slog through which makes it a long read. The tone is reminiscent of the television series M*A*S*H, or since Catch-22 came first, maybe it is the other way around. In any case it is an interesting book but a classic it is not. Stick with Tolstoy, Hemingway or Fitzgerald.
B004FOOQV6|5|Excellent for all types of measurements. I like the currency conversion. Easy to use. And doesn't take up much space.

B00013F35I|3|If you do not want to go through the trouble connected with returning the defective 2nd disc, try this first. I've got a Pioneer player and the trick works always, so chances are it might work with other brands too. <br />Check it out: 1. Wait until the background music ends (like 10 secs) 2. Keep 'Play' pressed until the player sort of 'reloads' the dvd (like 10 secs again)and activates the screensaver 3. Press 'Play'and now your player should load track 1 of the concert. 4. To view the bonus materials, just access them via the remote control's 'Search Mode':<br />Title 1: The Encores<BR>Title 2: 'The Night of the Living Boss'<BR>Title 3: FBI Warning<BR>Title 4: 'Drop The Needle and Play'<br />The only 'features' (if you can even call them that) you cannot access is the 'Setlist' and 'Other DVDS' - two totally unimportant features, anyway. You can set the Audio Options (Dolby/PCM) directely via the control's 'Audio' button.<br />I have found this to be a completely satisfying solution for myself which saves me the inconvenience of returning the defective disc, etc. Works for me. <br />I have not yet had time to watch the entire show but I treated myself to a few of the songs - I can only repeat what so many others have stated: the production quality of the concert is really a shame - it can't compete with the 'Live in NYC' dvd. The sound is much better on the NYC dvd, as is the direction, but I can easily live with that. It's a great show. And for the price? It's a good buy nonetheless.
B000O59A2K|5|Two great videos
0307730697|5|I loved the book. I deeply admire Adam Brown and all the seals. I was also very impressed with Kelly Brown and her undying support for Adam.
B004PR71JC|5|This is one of the best soundtracks ever.  You don´t even have to watch the movie to enjoy it since the rhythms speak for themselves (you expect Samba and Bossa Nova in a cd called Rio).  Kids loved the whole cd, specially REAL IN RIO, and HOT WINGS (I WANNA PARTY).  I personally recommend it without reservations.
B001LMRCP2|4|For $5, you can't beat this.  That is as much as a Starbucks latte.    The songs are a nice addition to the Coldplay repertoire.  Nothing incredibly new or amazing, but they have vocals on Life in Technicolor, which gives that beautiful arrangement new life.    yeah, buy it!
0385507755|1|I've read the book and now seen the allegations that James Frey's drug and alcohol memoir \\"A Million Little Pieces\\" is filled with lies and half-truths, and am besides myself that this fraud has taken place. Whatever happened to the editorial standards at Random House that they could release a book and not check the validity of the material first? And how could Oprah Winfrey and her producers not check the same before she goes on national TV and extols the values of the accounts. What a sham...and a shame!

B0049P1ZZQ|5|very good
B002KS1IJC|4|I really liked it. What makes it excellent is that there is nothing really bad in it. Some of the scenes are physically impossible but all movies are like that. Otherwise good attention to detail. Monster gory but again that is expected today. I simply didn't watch those parts and enjoyed the movie.

0783241542|5|The best movie in the world! Witty humor and sub-romantic qualities are put to life in this extremely enjoyable and highly entertaining raunch-fest! The stars and characters are a great ensemble as well!<BR>The story centers around the coming-of-age of James/Jim (Jason Biggs), who fantasizes about girls often and even has crazy occurances with pornography, but never once has had a girlfriend. After a party, (in which he and his buddies hope to get laid, but have no such luck), thrown by goofball, semi-friend, Steve Stifler (Seann William Scott), the guys find out that the biggest nerd in school, Sherman the \\"Sherminator\\" (Chris Owen) claims to have gotten laid with a chick he just met; so he (Jim), Chris \\"Oz\\" Ostreicher (Chris Klein), Kevin (Thomas Ian Nicholas), and Paul/\\"Finch\\" (Eddie Kaye Thomas) all vowed to get laid before they graduate....but not just love 'em and leave 'em, but with some emotional standards and loving to it! The objects of their affections are: Vicky (Tara Reid), Heather (Mena Suvari), Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth), and Jessica (Natasha Lyonne). The supporting cast includes Jennifer Coolidge as Stifler's Mom and Eugene Levy as Jim's Dad.<BR>I will detail this more at another time!

B00003CWL6|2|This movie was good but it rip off one of the best movies of the 90'es a film called Happiness. A brillent protray of the dark side of Suburbia. I will admit American Beauty had better photography but thats about it there are so many things the same with both movies. The only two difference is Happiness came out a year earler (thats why its riping it off) and Happiness is way more contreversail and is for adults only before you watch American Beauty watch Happiness than you decide.

B009POCG0Y|5|If you identify with any of these characters you need to draw a warm bath, get in, and make good use of a razor blade !  Great movie but disturbing !  McConaughey brings it to table !  I gain more respect for him with every movie he makes.  Be prepared - Gina Gershon like you have never seen her (and more of her than you dreamed).
B009ZQC7MY|5|Can't wait to watch Season 4!
B00HVJB4VM|4|Great storyteller. Wonderful book about a very dark part of the markets. Provides great insight and food for thought. Enjoyed especially after seeing IEX's Brad Katsuyama vs. BATS Global Markets president William O'Brien on high-speed trading and 'rigged' markets on CNBC.
B00092ZAO0|4|Donald the Big Mac is great, Heinz Zednik is obviously a genius, the Rhein-nymphs and lesser gods are all fine.  The only real flaw in the cast is Fritz Hubner as Fafner  (although Freija while buxom is not pretty).  But the ones I really watch it over and over again for are Helmut Pampusch as Mime, young Matti Salminen as Fasolt (one of his best performances available, rivalling his Hagen under Levine), and most of all Hermann Becht as Alberich.  The latter acts uniquely well, sings with power, and sounds incredibly ugly.  His body-language as he puts the curse on the ring is really something; he looks (and sounds) like someone who has just had an extremity hacked off or been stabbed through the eye--surprised and disoriented, trying to figure out how to interpret the pain, whether to change position or stay still.  His whole performance gets the pathetic-but-menacing thing very well--the only comparable portrayal of this kind of character I can think of right now is Byron James as Leon the replicant in BLADE RUNNER.  Even as he's gauging Harrison Ford's eyes out with his fingers, you feel sorry for him because he's so ugly.  OK, also Robert DiNiro as Lewis in JACKIE BROWN.<br /><br />Other very good acting includes Anna Reynolds' whole performance as Fricka and Loge's and Wotan's expressions of disgust as Mime and the crowd of silent Nibelungs cluster around them, pawing and grabbing their clothes.<br /><br />Sure the \\"industrial revolution\\" sets and costumes were controversial but they're tame compared to some of the goofery we see these days.  The only problem I have with it is that the giants' costumes are silly--the singers stand on platforms carried around by people underneath.  The giants are supposed to lumber, lurching from leg to leg.  It might have been ok if the director had made them walk more slowly.

B004SJ3BCI|5|Kids love playing this game on the new Kindle Fire HD!  They were use to it on a smartphone so the larger screen size is fantastic!  Thanks!
1452115567|5|I have been following Maddie for a while and was so excited to see the book published.  I am a photographer and have used some pictures for inspiration.  You can tell this dog has mad skills.  It is such a great story and the pictures always evoke a smile.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this book!!!
B00DPM7TIG|5|Be prepared to go over your allotted time to read.  Poetic, informative, and illuminating.  WWII from a German point of view.
B007IXWKUK|5|This is great reading and I just loved the characters.  It is a great love story, a little weird.  I just couldn't stop reading it..
B001GXF2YY|1|Buyer beware! This Kindle edition does not have Text-to-speech enabled.  I don't know why the text-to-speech was enabled in the first five.  its very disappointing
B003KR50IW|5|One of her best! Love it! She's our golden girl!
B004DI7HZ6|5|It's great fun - a fantasy blending science, history and romance into an easy-to-read story.  This was an entertaining book.
B009V5KI98|5|Terrific!
B00JOT3HQ2|5|I love geometry dash lite it's a challenge but still awesome and not impossible like other games. I showed to my friends now all of them have it.
B00FBR8130|5|This figure features the best articulation and likeness on a walking dead action figure to date. His face sculpt is damn near perfect and his articulation is the best on any figure yet. His detail is great and comes with his trusty crossbow and a very nice chopper. The chopper comes with a holster for the crossbow and daryl rides it beutifully.

B0009S2T0M|4|A man is mysteriously imprisoned during 15 years in a hotel room. And once he's released he will just have five days to find his captor and seek revenge.<br /><br />The plot is denser than ususal in this terrible existential drama that will involve victim and victimary.<br /><br />The movie in question was awarded with the Great Prize of Cannes in 2004. A well rounded script highly praised by Quentin Tarantino that knows this issue as just as few directors in the world.<br /><br />A cult movie since its immediate release.
B00C8S9W0G|5|Another outstanding, unforgettable book by Diana Gabladon. If you've read the other books in the series, you don't need to be told how wonderful they are.  Don't jump ahead though, read them one by one and enjoy the journey down the rabbit hole.  You'll never be the same.  And you might just get a hankering to travel to scotland.  :)
B00E8KLWB4|5|I would give this game a 5.  Very entertaining for everyone.  Even our teenagers  from 14 to 19 have enjoyed these games.
B00B5HQL50|4|it is good, and we enjoy the scene, the story is also well designed, however, it is sad that mama dead in the end...
B00ICSVNOY|5|It was amazing

0679745653|5|Perfect!
B0084AXZK0|5|The story about the stopping of time, or reversing time may be revolutionary and very provocative, what I like most about the Picture of Dorian Gray are the aphorisms. Read slowly, and you will discover many gems, and may retrieve double the fun.
140006922X|2|I just had trouble getting into this book.  Probably just me and not my kind of read, but interesting for those who enjoy t his kind of thing...
B004UJTG6Q|5|I thought it was a boring classic but I came to like it about a third through. You won't regret reading this.
B005CRQ4GU|5|Omg what can I sayin love this book that's all I can say<br />I love the funniest books and this is one of them
B006885FZI|4|A very good recount of the Pacific War but did not seem quite as compelling as Band of Brothers. Still an excellent show.
B00003CX5P|5|Besides the movie and the usual Star Wars saga, this DVD has TONS of extras that will appeal to anyone.  The deleted scenes have been reworked in the studio and look like they could, and should, belong in the movie!!  The 'making of' documentary was unbelievable!!  It really gives the Star Wars fan an inside look at how things fall together, or fall apart.  I gained a new appreciation of the movie after seeing the DVD.  It boggles the mind how Lucas worked from nothing to being able to build this incredibly realistic universe complete with intense sub-plots and stories.  I gotta say that I spent a good 3 hours just viewing a part of the special features and still have more to go.  AWESOME says it all.
B003F9G8B8|4|Tells the story of South Africa when Nelson Mandela entered offuce. awesome sports stort..great movie but I rented from amazon instant stream and it kept freezing.
B00006G8K0|5|Special Features? A Travesty!A letter to Warner from a film buff and a plea to Directors Martin Scorsese and John Carpenter.<br />Generally, I'm in total agreement with the many fine reviews listed here, and I need to add two important caveats... Firstly, where are the interviews, film stills, lobby posters, not to mention commentary tracks and possibly isolated music track?!?<br />Secondly, with such a fine print, why is the colour balance slightly off, especially noticeable in the red-orange bias of the colour of blood? (Warner got it right with their DVD release of The Curse of Frankenstein and their VHS release of Dracula; why not here?)<br />Lack of Special Features: Horror of Dracula is considered to be one of the finest examples of British filmmaking as opinioned by Phil Hardy (editor of the Aurum Film Encyclopedia) and other film historians. It is reported by Christopher Lee to have single-handedly saved Universal Pictures from bankruptcy in 1958. It has a great worldwide following of filmgoers including directors, John Carpenter and Martin Scorsese. <BR>The DVD of a film of this stature deserves a complete roster of special features! Warner, you own the exclusive rights to this classic (as told to me by a Hammer Films executive)... so where are they?!?<BR>Actor Christopher Lee (Saruman from &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot;) has many personal stories about this epoch making classic and I believe would jump at a chance to share them with film buffs worldwide in an in-depth DVD interview. (He did so with the DVD release of Hammer's lesser (relatively speaking) &quot;Hound of the Baskervilles&quot; on MGM DVD.) Lee's story of attending the New York premier of Dracula with fellow actor and good friend, the late Peter Cushing is fabulous and should be preserved on DVD for all to experience! Let's see and hear more touching anecdotes about the personal and professional relationship between two of the greatest acting duos in film history. (The conclusion of Lee's interview on the Baskervilles&quot; DVD is very moving wherein he shows us how much he misses his friend and colleague, Peter Cushing. I want to see more of the heart of this powerful actor in current DVD interviews! (and movies!!!) This actor is capable of playing more than just great villains! What better movie than the one that put him &quot;on the map&quot;!<BR>Composer James Bernard, who wrote the powerful and evocative music to Dracula would also have much to say about writing this classic score, and about the special demands of writing quickly for Hammer. This music was truly ahead of its time in taking seriously and respecting its subject matter!<BR>Screenwriter, Jimmy Sangster has much to say about his fascinating formative days at Hammer and has done so in his books, but I would like to see him do it in an in-depth interview on DVD! For example, film enthusiasts would love to see him tell his story about what he did with the original Dracula script! (Second guessing fame is ironic!)<BR>1958 is quite a ways off in time; sadly we will never have a current interview with Peter Cushing or director Terence Fisher on DVD... the point here is that time is of the essence with these talented people! Through Warner's apathetic approach to its release of this classic film, film buffs and film enthusiasts may never get to hear and see the insights and reminiscences of the original crew to this unique British masterpiece! This is living film history! Don't wait too long to correct this injustice to the world of film, Warner! You might not be able to...!!! I'm looking forward to the Special Edition of Horror of Dracula!!!!<br />A plea to filmmakers Martin Scorsese and John Carpenter... Please use your position to work with Warner to rectify an impending lost to the world film community!
B0092MKFIY|5|Builds on the songs from their Continued Silence EP.  Instantly likable.  The new songs \\"Amsterdam\\" and \\"Bleeding Out\\" are catchy but not corny.
B004EPZ03Y|4|This is a favorite for my family to watch & the blu-ray DVD combo is ideal. Price was great but shipment was just a little mysterios - but it got here in suitable time.
B004SBQAL0|4|I am Number Four struck me as a great little bit of a movie that seemed all the more familiar, especially when I watched it for the second time. Turns out, the producers of the film were the same ones who brought us Smallvlle seasons 1-8. So if you're a Smallville fan, you'll probably love this flick.<br /><br />There are a few cons. When viewed on anything other than an HDTV with BR player, the film is so darkly unlit as to make it aggravating to watch. The special features are not very heroic; there's a featurette of the actress playing Number 6. That's about it for the DVD. The BR does has quite a bit more, but given the weight of the project - a hopeful launching of a film franchise in and of itself - this movies extra features are pretty skimpy.<br /><br />The movie is fun, and the special effects are awesome if you are watching in HDTV and BR. I watched it a couple of times back-to-back, trying to notice details I missed before. There are two quotes that seriously make the movie worth watching by themselves. Something about XBox and another on Red Bull..... It's a decent enough movie that I am going to start reading the novels. Take that how you will.
B00AIUUXHC|3|Great For Shark week
B00CH26TL8|5|This game is easy to play, yet challenges my mind enough to keep me sharp. Great puzzle solving and it's fun!
B00CFNUMD0|5|Great show for young children and adults too. Niice clean funny show.  Would love to see more seasons on amazon.

B00KTDD69A|4|Just started playing this game, but I like it so far
B0094BB4TW|5|I was a little sceptical of this app at 1st.  A lot of the previous reviews were of people having problems with it.  But since it was free I thought I would give it a try.  It has worked great for me, no problems at all.
B0020BUWX2|5|Enjoyed the book very much. Looking forward to reading the next one. A must buy!!!!! Ready for the movie. Loved it
B004SIP6A4|5|What can I say about the movie. This is pure awesome entertainment. It is even better being on Blu-ray. Give us more like this. How about Newsies next.
B00001ODHL|5|This item came just as expected; theatrical cut, long-wanted director's cut, and everything.
B0054JZC6E|4|these games are good fun. the graphics aren't awesome but that doesn't prevent the fun. it is annoying to get frequent popups to get the next game though.
B005DD7H50|5|Limitless is a fascinatingly good movie about Eddie Mora's rise to power using a brain-stimulating drug called NZT. The first time he pops this drug, a whole new world opens up to him because his brain is operating at maximum power. Very cool to watch this happen. Even cooler is that there are others who know about NZT and some are using it themselves. What unfolds is a dangerous game of minds to see who comes out on top. Bradley Cooper gives a great performance and so does De Niro.
B0015DWJX2|4|Getting to know the characters and events through letters is an ingenious and fun way to tell a story. I now want to take a trip to the Channel Islands.

B005GFPZYK|5|This was such a great book. Really had a hard time putting it down. It is a very good read and would recommend it to any one who reads.
B004G600A4|5|I absolutely love this movie, along with my girls.<br />Great Adult humor and my girls know this movie word by word already!
1907563202|2|Well, I'm a beginner. While the ideas are certainly cute, they are not as easy to follow as the previous reviews would lead you to think. The directions to create the projects leave a lot to be desired. Let's face it, if you're a beginner you shouldn't need to go to a class on crochet to follow and make the pattern, especially when the title includes \\"Learn Crochet with these 35 adorable projects\\". I've started something in the book. Tuesday I will go to a veteran crocheter to better understand what the heck Nicki is saying so that I can finish the project for which I've already spent money on the purchase of lots of yarn!!!!.....I'm pissed off because it shouldn't be necessary based on the way the book markets itself.
B007IXWKUK|5|Love the second book too!! Simply amazing!!! Would definitely recommend to all my friends and co-workers too. A great late night read ;-)
B00M7URUUE|2|Noah lacked the ‘E’ in epic, nor was it thought provoking.  It was just a run of the mill action movie.
B0026NBZDU|5|Beautifully written and packed with delicious twists, I've been recommending this to everyone I know.
B002ZG99QS|3|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />In its time, the original 'Tron' was considered in the forefront of special effects cinema. Looking back today and comparing the original with 'Tron: Legacy', one is struck by the overwhelming primitive look of the original. I'm sure if the technology was available back in the early 80s, in terms of special effects, 'Tron: Legacy' is the movie that would have been made. It's not only an homage to the original, but a dazzling dream scape in its own right and the creative effects team should be praised highly for their efforts.<br /><br />That said, without a good story, all the special effects in the world cannot make a decent movie, great. It starts off rather nicely though with the focus on the effect of Kevin Flynn's disappearance on his young son, Sam. The film's scenarists were wise to create an internal arc in which Sam's main motivation is to reunite with his long lost father. We soon discover that Kevin's disappearance in the 80s has affected Sam in a most negative way as an adult. Despite being the controlling shareholder of his Dad's multinational company, ENCOM, Sam spends his time playing a practical jokes on the Board of Directors, such as breaking into company headquarters, hacking into the computer system and briefly posting a new software application on the internet.<br /><br />One notices that the ENCOM break-in scene is much too long as well as the meeting with Alan Bradley, his father's old friend, who informs Sam of a mysterious page (Alan still uses a pager) emanating from the old Flynn arcade which had been shut down for twenty years, Sam discovers his father's laboratory through a hidden passageway inside the arcade and after a few keyboard strokes, Sam is inadvertently transported inside the virtual world of the computer. What's interesting is that this computer world has no interface with today's cyberspace and reflects the computer landscape of the early 1980s.<br /><br />Once Sam is dropped into the virtual world, there are two sensational sequences with Sam battling the minions of CLU, his father's digital clone, who seeks to create a perfect world by subjugating everyone to his will. Sam's first battle involves gladiator-like combat where the combatants throw computer discs at one another and must jump from level to level on a chess-like grid. All the while, a huge crowd is enjoying the carnage. Sam is then brought before CLU, who has the face of the young Jeff Bridges, who appeared in the original Tron. CLU challenges Sam to a life cycle race (on digital motorcycles) and Sam is saved by Quorra, Kevin's assistant, who turns out to be last remaining ISO (Isomorphic Algorithm). The ISOs are sentient beings who somehow are found to contain DNA inside the virtual world. Quorra is played by the lovely Olivia Wilde (who reminds me of a young Kirstie Alley, playing 'Saavik' in the first Star Trek movie).<br /><br />The story slows down a bit when Sam finally reunites over the dinner table with his father who's morphed into a Zen-like Master. There's some dull chatter about each of them having gone to Cal Tech and then a better (and brief flashback) as Kevin explains how CLU wiped out the ISOs. Kevin also explains to Sam about the portal that was opened up when Sam arrived in the virtual world, how that's the only way out and it's going to close real soon. Kevin has this dumb idea that CLU can be defeated by opposing forces within the virtual world but Sam knows better--the only way to defeat CLU is delete the program from the outside and the only way to do that, is get to the portal and get out before it closes.<br /><br />You would think that all-knowing Quorra would then give Sam some good advice on how to get to the portal in the nick of time, but she recommends he look up Zuse, a sleazy David Bowie-like character who ends up betraying Sam, snatching his father's 'disc' (which CLU needs as it works as the master key to the Grid). Of course Dad shows upand saves Sam from CLU's clutches. There's a weak scene after that where Zuse bargains with CLU with no backup, gives up the disc, and is then easily murdered by CLU, when he blows up Zuse's nightclub. Meanwhile, Quorra has one of her arms blown off by CLU's henchmen and fortunately Kevin reprograms her so she can regenerate all her dead tissue.<br /><br />The final climax is a good one where virtual jet fighters are used in a race to the portal. Kevin uses his Zen-like powers to reprogram the original 'Tron' right before he kills Quorra and also uses Zen-like powers to prevent CLU from stopping Sam and Quorra successfully getting through the portal.<br /><br />I'm not sure how Quorra is able to survive outside the virtual world but as stated before, the actor who plays her, Olivia Wilde, is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />While Jeff Bridges does well playing his alter egos, the characters themselves aren't very complex. If you're looking for a story that will massage your brain, you won't find it here. But the special effects are dazzling and are enough to keep you entertained, despite the simplicity of the good versus evil storyline.weak scene after that where Zuse bargains with CLU with no backup, gives up the disc, and is then easily murdered by CLU, when he blows up Zuse's nightclub.

B005NPBT5M|4|There isn't much more to say about it. If you don't know about this album, then you probably won't want it:) Loved it in Highschool so I grabbed a copy when it was on sale. There are some really good songs on here, even if much of it is so overplayed that it has become a bit of a joke.
B006BXTOFC|5|If you like Brothers, you will like El Camino. Black Keys have delivered another awesome album.  Can you still call them albums??
B009G7ZYPY|4|It's a great CD, and Susan's voice is, as always, a joy to listen to, but she still hasn't found &#34;her&#34; song - I thought with Someone to Watch Over me she might have, but she never sang the whole song in one piece - and in this CD, they're not &#34;her&#34; songs - I'm hoping she'll find one she can claim as &#34;her&#34; own - she has such a remarkable voice and such a wonderful story.
B001QWBM62|5|Ok
B0025WX2YW|5|Excellent.amazing costumes and sets.
B002RI9TB4|5|This book has it all! One of my favourite books - love, history, politics - I didn't want it to finish!
B00DJFIMW6|2|Would like to like it but can't get it to work.
0399226907|5|Classic book, pages cut away so kids can see ALL the foods the caterpillar is eating. Great for showers and works for baby boys or girls.
B004GJDQT8|5|Love Amazon App
B0036RCVJM|3|I found this book rather tiresome and abandoned the reading halfway through.  Strangely I found the movie better - quite a revelation as I usually prefer the written story to the visual.
B008Y2FRFO|5|I love playing this game, it is very addicting. My son has even taking the kindle from me to play this one, we actually fight over it.  I love these type of machines at arcades !! :-)
1595141979|5|I loved this book.  took two days to read this one.  This series is first rate.  Can not wait to read more these books.  D.
B00CSR2J9I|4|I don't know what it is about the game that makes it so addictive. It's very simplistic compared to the RPG's I'm used to, but there's something about this game that makes me want to play for hours when I'm in the mood(which is only once or twice a week, I still love my old school RPG's)Definitely worth trying, especially cause it's free.
B000JJS8TM|4|A splendid trip through the Glass Onion. This release is for the die hard fans like myself. For the casual fan of The Fabs I wouldnt suggest this disc. Knowing the catalogue inside out is a must to fully appreciate the idea behind Love. The songs are not just remastered but remixed. They're all new takes on the old songs. <br /> <br />With that said, I started with track one and initially after hearing the first couple of songs I was not impressed with what was done at all. Then it began to gain momentum. They were smart,The Martins, by having the disc gain steam as it goes along. Afterwards I was in \\"Love\\". <br />  <br />Stand out tracks are Tomorrow Never Knows/Within You, a brilliant psychedelic marriage of words and song. Especially nice for those who werent keen on the Indian vibe the first time around. I never had a problem with it in the first place. Mr Kite!/She's So Heavy/Helter Skelter -- just listen to its brilliance. The acoustic While My Guitar Gently Weeps has a new string arrangement ... makes you feel \\"home and dry\\". I always preferred the demo version with the additional lyrics but this arrangement just adds so much to it. In Lady Madonna theres a bit of the Hey Bulldog riff thrown in. The songs always belonged together. Strawberry Fields Forever may just be the best of the lot ...just hear it for yourself. <br /> <br />And for those who appreciate 5.1 surround sound this is the first Beatles release in this format so thats a plus too. Im looking forward to the entire catalogue being updated on CD. Its been a long time since their CD releases in 1987/1988. Its time...'The Walrus said'.
B000AHJJDM|5|Good item, fair price.
B0085A9HXS|5|It is a great action packed flick that will entertain through multiple viewings. The plot is basic and simple so do not think that this is going to be a murder mystery. The subtitles and dubbing are the same so you won't miss out on the story from watching one or the other. There are plenty of &#34;ooh!&#34; moments and &#34;OMG that hurt!&#34; moments. All the fight scenes are spectacular and the movie overall is entertaining.
B002V6RB1C|5|Paul Newman in the type of role that used to be the defining heroic archetype to American males: the self-reliant, hard-headed individualist searching for truth and justice while battling the forces of evil. Themes of Christianity; rejection of bureaucratic soul-stifling rules; striving to do the best you can do; being broken and yet coming back to renew the fight once again... A very powerful movie. For those who still enjoy this type of inspirational story of individualism, check out &#34;Sometimes a Great Notion&#34;. For those of you who idolize gansta drug dealers, misogynistic rap stars, weak-wristed poetic losers, or hopeless romantic werewolves, your choices from the Hollywood studios are multiplying rapidly.<br /><br />Excellent casting and acting (George Kennedy won best supporting actor Oscar for his role). Musical score was outstanding.
B002Q5L024|5|This is one of my favorite movies. It is not only sweet and gentle, but also has a message. Wonderful for all members of the family.
0060977493|4|My book club chose this book as selection of the book and the reviews were generally favorable. Most of the members, including myself, were drawn to the tragic richness of the character devlopment and the wonderul use of  language. Although the abscence of a traditional plot line did throw me at  first, the brilliant energy and stamina involved in the writing more than  compensated. Sort reminded me of Faulkner teaming up with Dr. Seus.
0240815807|5|I recently finished reading this book, and found it to be thorough, well organized, and full of great tips.     Mike takes a logical approach, starting with getting your workspace in order, through getting your tracks cleaned up and organized, into a simple method for setting balances and eq'ing for maximum clarity, then getting into the art of making the song shine.    The section and method he suggests for referencing commercial mixes is worth the price of the book. Nothing will teach you faster than good referencing, though it can be hugely discouraging when you think your mix sounds great - until you put it up against a few commercial tracks! That's the only way to get to that level of mix quality, though!    This isn't a 'quick-fix, get your mix done in an hour' method, but it's how professional mixers get the quality you hear on those releases.     Mike has done home recordists and professionals alike a great service with this book. Buy it. Buy it now.
B00BIVN82M|5|Very nice
0790729628|4|This has got to be one of the best SciFi movies of all time.  But what makes it so good?!  My opinion is that Harrison Ford makes it so good.  He is 100% in character in Blade Runner as a tough but reluctant replicant hunter.<br />Another thing I like is the way you can almost feel sorry for the replicants.  They didn't have a choice in their fate and they seem to have a legitimate reason for the havoc they are creating.  The end of the fight scene between H. Ford and R. Hauer (when the replicant dies) always chokes me up.<br />I could go on for a long time on this one... but the bottom line is:<br />Blade Runner has set the mark by which all other SciFi films will be judged for a long time.
B002ZG98LO|5|I enjoyed this movie, a good sequel to the first Predator movie, unlike Predator 2.  And it had different plot twists while relating to the first movie.  Adrien Brody and company did a good job acting.  I recommend it for Predator fans.
B000002JBG|5|It's rare in this day and age that a movie and its accompanying soundtrack(s) goes great together.  Warner Sunset and Atlantic Records did an awesome job with the release, \\"Space Jam-Music From and Inspired by the Motion Picture\\", the soundtrack to the 1996 flick starring Warner Brothers' legendary icon, Bugs Bunny, and retired NBA superstar, Michael Jordan.    Featuring an array of international superstars and producers, the soundtrack was a definite platinum hit during the late 1990's.  What can I say?....every song is an anthem.  Songs like Quad City DJs' title track, \\"Space Jam\\", Salt-N-Pepa's \\"Upside Down (Round and Round)\\", '90's club diva, Robin S. with \\"Givin' U All That I Got\\" and D'Angelo's jazz-inspired, \\"I Found My Smile Again\\" helps to keep the party jumpin'!      Also, what a CD without its share of love ballad anthems from Monica (the Diane Warren-penned, \\"For You I Will\\"), R. Kelly, Changing Faces & Jay-Z (\\"All of My Days\\"), which also appeared on Changing Faces' sophomore release and All-4-One's \\"I Turn to You\\".    The \\"song remakes\\" are also shown here, with songs by Seal (the Steve Miller Band's, \\"Fly Like An Eagle\\"), the unusual pairings of the Spin Doctors and hip-hop legend, Biz Markie (KC & the Sunshine Band's, \\"That's the Way (I Like It\\") and late, great R&B superstar, Barry White, and comedian, Chris Rock, with their hilarious take on Cheech & Chong's classic, \\"Basketball Jones\\".    The real highlights, in my opinion, would be R. Kelly's #1 signature 1996 anthem, \\"I Believe I Can Fly\\", and the movie's bad guys entrance theme, the Trackmasters-produced, \\"Hit 'Em High (The Monstars Anthem)\\", featuring rap megastars, Flipmode Squad leader, Trevor \\"Busta Rhymes\\" Smith, Cypress Hill frontman, Louis \\"B-Real\\" Freese, Artis \\"Coolio\\" Ivey, Jr., James Todd Smith (aka LL Cool J) and Wu-Tang Clan member, Clifford \\"Method Man\\" Smith.    If you've seen this movie a billion times, you'll know that there were only 3 songs that weren't even used in the filmat all:  -Coolio and LV with the Curtis Mayfield-sampled, \\"The Winner\\"  (but it was played to coincide with movie's home video/DVD release)  -R. Kelly featuring Changing Faces & Jay-Z, \\"All of My Days\\"  (which was on Changing Faces's sophomore album)  -Bugs Bunny rapping with fellow Looney Tuner, Daffy Duck, on \\"Buggin'\\" (which was penned by none other than former Def Jam Records president, and Beyonce's husband, Shawn \\"Jay-Z\\" Carter\\")    In conclusion, if you only like the soundtrack and not the movie, or vice versa, you've got to admit that the pairing (movie & soundtracks) are great together.  Also, if you're into movie scores like I am, buy the Space Jam Motion Picture Score Album, composed & conducted by James Newton Howard.      Space Jam.  One of music's all-time soundtracks.
B000U0O9FM|5|Fight Club is one of my all-time favorite movies, and now I love the book, too. It deals with the nuances and intimacies that are only available in writing.
B00I2TV3NO|5|I liked it as much as the first film. I can't wait for the next installment of the series. Love big ed.
B007MNV5WU|3|This game is not as fun as the other angry birds games.  The space idea was just not exactly for me.
B000001G6W|5|The dissenting reviewers who find Karajan's Beethoven 9th to be too grand and over-polished are hinting at its only vulnerability.  This is an immense performance, huge in scale and overflowing with passion that isn't attached to a control valve.  What some reviewers find dissatisfactory is that Karajan always maintains such a tight grip that there is never a moment where the tension slags enough for us to even catch a quick breath.<br /><br />These complaints are valid, but aren't they better viewed as blessings?  In a masterpiece that represents the height of symphonic ingenuity, firm vision would seem desirable.  And while Karajan isn't flexible, the playing of the Berliners is anything but straightforward.  The feeling of raw Germanic force is thrilling, every minute of it.  And it's unfair to accuse Karajan of lacking sensitivity.  He finds icy beauty in the Adagio and in between some of the most whamming climaxes, he breathes a quick prayer.  The point is that his intensity never leaves, no matter the character he's employing.  It's true that the Wiener Singverein doesn't have nearly the same power as the orchestra in the finale, but I find that to be a minor detraction.<br /><br />In our day it is difficult to find interpreters who grasp the soul and strength of Beethoven.  Some listeners may choose to view Karajan as aloof and cold for his concentration.  I, on the other hand, think his gifts come as a welcome relief from the tepid Beethoven that is common fare today.
B00T3DNKIE|1|Some things should remain unseen. This book is one of them. This book will diminish the literary reputation of Ms. Lee. The them of understanding our parents are human is my only take away from a book that should not have seen the light of day. Just read \\" To Kill A Mockingbird\\"
B0000BWVCM|5|By far the best of the trilogy and it's everything a 2nd movie should be: it introduces new characters but not to a silly degree, it expands the world introduced in the 1st movie, and it explores the previous characters and their relationships with greater depth. It's also darker and grittier than the 1st which I love.
B0000024ZT|5|I don't care much for his sweaty leather hairy-man machismo, but I can always appreciate a lyric that turns my head in a knot. This, his debut album, has the best balance of poetry, rock and roll and persona. After this, he seemed to become a mumbling caricature of himself. Here, he's fresh, smart and audible. Greetings from Asbury Park is a must-have record for any collection of late 20th century American music.<br /><br />One other note: hopefully they will release an improved remastering of this excellent album. As of this date, the only CD available is over-compressed, congested, low-fi, reminiscent of the AM radios we had in our cars when it came out. (I have a better sound system now.) Enjoy!
B0000844I8|5|Arrived ontime and love this movie
B00BSBR9N6|4|Loved it! Funny and touching with great characters well drawn.
B00J6YBOFQ|4|Awesome book. Really learned a lot and I enjoyed the many company case studies. My only criticism is chapter 10- the part about consultants. I completely disagree with Peter for making Accenture an example of the opposite of a cult. Peter needs to better understand the consulting business model- how it works; why consulting firms are successful; why people choose to work there, etc. And, I do believe it is possible for a consulting firm, especially one as large as Accenture, to maintain some sort of culture.<br /><br />Other than my obvious annoyance with chapter 10, I really really liked this book. It is radical and eye opening and definitely a book everyone should read.

B000F3TBIO|5|I absolutely love the CD. I think it's great. It was delievered quickly and in good shape.
0061146668|5|I am still reading The Sleepwalkers. The scholarship displayed here is amazing. The writing is crisp and clear. Clark's interpretations are persuasive, objective  and frequently novel. Among the library of really fine books on the origins of The Great War this is among the best.
0307887448|5|Read the book.
B000QRIGLC|5|A triumphant story of one man's faith and courage over impossible odds and circumstances. Brings home the point of the sacrifices our troops make. A debt that can never be repaid!!

B0063IH60K|5|I have no problems with the game (kindle fire).  I like it when I want something to challenge myself. I recommend this game to everyone.
B000OPOAM0|3|I own this lenticular edition. The slip cover is very nice, I love it. But my copy only has these special features:  -Trailer  -DVD-Rom Script to Screen.  Is it normal for this edition?
B00ATDOVNK|4|This game was interesting. Lots of going back and forth though. I will give it 4 stars only because of the price being to high. Can't you please put some lower priced games, for those of us<br />elderly people on a very tight budget.
B00FVVR2ZO|3|It's a fun hidden object game but I agree that it needs some fixes. I can't seem to add any friends so when that gets fixed maybe it will be more fun.
B0091W6QZG|3|slow but good acting, interesting, leaves you hanging at the end.
B00881VLCE|5|I like to these puzzles
0930289455|4|I was expecting a graphic novel not a dinky little magazine. When I opened the package I felt ripped off. Basically the size is very disappointing. I'm new to the world of graphic novels, so, I'm used to getting a substantial book of sorts, which I've discovered is actually a series combined. Anyway - Decided to read it, and put it back up for resale.... After 30 minutes I put the appropriately named 'novel' right up beside my new collection including Year one and DKR. It manages to immerse you into the world of Gotham, quickly and efficiently. Then without compromise, and quite suddenly show you the true potential of The Joker.    It's a stretch to buy the hardcover in my opinion, unless you're diehard, but the softcover price was well worth the read. Not to mention, the Art is among the best I've seen in my short love affair of Graphic Novels.
B00LCT48YC|5|I love this album and the vinyl version is very high quality.  Great record start to finish.
B0001I561E|5|Finally was able to find this on DVD so my 13 year old could watch it.  Its her dads favorite Disney movie.  We got the video ahead of schedule.  Thank you
B0054JZC6E|5|if you are looking to kill time then this is your best bet. easy to play and requires no thinking.
B009UX2YAC|5|I have this on my ipod and on my kindle fire! That's how much I Luv Luv LUV this game
B000I5SY5U|3|I saw this a few days after seeing the stage production at the St. Louis. rep.  The story and songs were entirely different.  The  stage production was infinitely easier to understand and more substantive .
B00003W8NM|5|I loved this movie! From the opening credits right down to the supplementary footage included in the DVD, I was entranced. David Fincher  really does stay true to the spirit of the book - with the exception of the  ending (READ THE BOOK). The DVD has deleted scenes, director commentary on  just about everything, and tons of information on how the special effects  were created. <br />Also, Edward Norton gives a spectacular performance  opposite Helena Bonham Carter opposite Brad Pitt in this somewhat violent  ride through the life and times of Tyler Durden. <br />I didn't see this movie  in the theater due to the poor ratings and rumors of it's misogynist  portrayals of women, but how can you expect some ancient closed-minded  critic to understand this movie? <br />I don't want to give away too much, but  lets just say that nothing is what it seems. Nothing. <br />Sure, this movie's  not for everyone, but would you rather watch one of those post-menopausal,  coming of age, mid-life crisis movies? If so, go rent Steel Magnolias. If  you want a scathing attack on consumerism and a look at the perils of  conformity, then you need look no further.
B00G32OER4|5|I'm not easily pleased and an avid fan of paranormal/demonic books and films to recognize this is top notch.  Well written and crafted film. Fantastic acting, particularly on the part of the children, and unequivocally Terrifying. James Wan has shown Phenomenal talent - looking forward to more great stuff from him! Highly recommend this - its a classic.
B000TETD9Q|5|Beautiful!  Many of the songs brought me back to when I was younger.  Brian is amazing!  Mike still has it and the voices are harmonious heaven!
B000ZHF6UC|3|I liked Keannus charater, there was a lot in Diane s charater that was wellw ritten. Toward the end her character became unbelieveable and annoying. J. Nickolsons charater was abhorrent and it is difficutl to believe the ending. an easy enough rainy day arfternoon watch if you dont mind young women being used for sex and succussful older women turning into mushy cliques over a man.... The Doctor ( K Reeves ) character was dignified and aware and was the saving grace of this film.... oh and the pretty setting. I usually really like D. Keaton so I am not sure what happened. I realize of course that her character was trying to be vulnerable and not all controlling in love but the script became annoying...
B00FPOSDGY|1|Ok, so my &#34;review&#34; has to do more with price. 9.99 for a kindle book is crazy, especially when the Hardcover is only $1 more on prime. Seriously, I bought an e-reader because books were supposed to be less expensive. This is crazy. I'm not paying that for an ebook.
B00GLX0Z8C|5|A classy movie for this genre, where the characters encounter some relatively believable problems.  I laughed tons and really cared about the characters.  And imagine, no one had to have diarrhea in the street to get a laugh.
0525478817|5|John Green is such an amazing author. This was so beautifully written. At times it took my breath away. It made me laugh and cry. I could read this over and over.
B006P3HXZG|5|A Very funny film that looks better in 3D. Great vocal performances and Photo realistic scenes.<br />Totaly enjoyable for a family movie night.
B000UNYJXQ|4|This movie was one of the best ones I have seen in a long time.  It is a true account of our government and HEALTHCARE business today.  I know because I work for one and what he exposed is the TRUTH...  This movie made me cry and angry at the same time.  I'm still talking about it and it has been a few weeks since I watched it.  If you like documentaries and think we should have Universal HEALTHCARE then this is the movie for you.  I personally believe that EVERY American should watch it and not be deceived by the LIES from our government anymore..
B00FAPF5U0|5|So so glad it's now finally on kindle! My phone was too small to really enjoy the game. And also, I'm not using any data like on the phone
160774418X|5|Fabulous cookbook, as is Plenty by the same author.
B005XI94HY|5|good
0743289684|5|I could never let it out of my hand until I finished it. Even when I finished it, that's all I could talk about with my boyfriend, who is also crazy for good books. It's a masterpiece, and the woman is unbelievable! Praises for her! People like her are world-shakers!
B000000W5H|5|this is a great rockin album by our favorite boys I like goats head soup but if it didn't excist I think that this would make 5 amazing albums in a row everything here is good maybe it is only rock n roll this time but hell you have mick taylor's last stand here doing what he does best and rock n roll is great stuff so i'm lovin this one.
B006XBSAP2|5|My favorite cd of hers
B00BLCHZC2|2|Episode 1 held my attention...definitely a new and interesting history story...but the episodes following were just not what I expected.  Not enough history, too much gratuitous violence.  I mean, I know the Vikings supposedly raped, pillaged and plundered, but if that is ALL they did, you can put that in one show.
0060555661|5|One of the best books i've ever read. It helped me a lot in investing my savings and obtaining a decent return, without risk
B00HBQWGXK|2|Way too complex compared to other Reacher novels
B000JJS8TM|5|First things first, Love by the Beatles, features music that is all from the Beatles original recordings.  That said, the starting point for this CD is very strong.  If you can get past the fact that there are what amounts to remixes of many of the recordings.  I am a firm believer that any music by the Beatles is great music.  Love by the Beatles is no exception to that belief.  The sound hear is outstanding.  There are many of the classic Beatles songs hear, with some eerie renditions and some excellent.  There is an ethereal quality to Strawberry Fields and I am the Walrus sounds excellent.  This is a must have for Beatles fans.  I rate it a strong four stars.<br /><br />The Audio DVD that comes with this special version sounds so outstanding on surround sound, it elevates this 4 star CD to a 5 star must have.  The music sounds perfect.
0307120007|5|This is a classic from way back when and is always a success.
0679735909|5|Possession is a tour de force of modern literary writing and has much humor to recommend it as well. The poetry, crafted in two poetical styles and sensibilities, as if written by a male...and then a female, the rich victorian sentences and paragraphs, and the modern active prose that hangs the two stories together leave nothing to be desired. A perfect novel full of mystery and intrigue, passion, structured artifice, humor and humanity, wry fun and wit.
B00QW8TYWO|5|Good game it is super fun
B003YL4KS0|5|At 41, to finally learn how to get my curls perfect ...is such an absolute relief. This book is perfectly written with easy tips and tricks that have made me fall in love with my curls at last. Great for anyone who's been struggling with curls, grizzly and bad hair days!
B0076DEJMO|4|At times I found myself skimming quickly through paragraphs, if not pages, at a time because this novel belabors some details unnecessarily.  That being said, its still got all of the great cynicism, wit, and blue collar philosophy that I've loved in all of Abercrombie's stories.
B0000DZ3EN|5|We rented this movie for our daughter and she fell in love with it. Couldn't find it in any stores and was happy to find it for sale online. She had the biggest smile when she opened up this gift at her birthday party. She's already watched it 3 times since she got it yesterday! Great movie!
B00129H7VS|5|Great story of our brave men fighting in World War 11.  The commentary by the actual men in Easy Company is really special, brings the story alive.
0307405095|5|This cookbook is fabulous!  I've only made a few recipes from it, but every receipe that i have made from this book has been loved by everyone that's tried them!  I can't wait to try MORE recipes from this great cookbook.  I'm not a huge pie person, but with this cookbook, I hope to learn to love them!

B00QW8TYWO|5|This is a really fun game and cool characters too!!!!!!!
0316055433|1|I have read all the reviews and I do not get what the hype is. I thought this book dragged on and on. The author could have written this book in 200 pages.
B00957T6X6|5|This story is a masterpiece, in many many ways. I did not think the bound together digital version detracted from the reading experience at all. Highly recommend.
B004XJRQUQ|5|awesome movies must watch
B004GCPJDQ|1|I don't find the USB power source functional at all.  If the computer goes to sleep or shuts down, the charger loses power (naturally).  So, if I want to charge my mouse overnight (ie when not in use), I have to leave my computer on overnight.  That's not what I call eco-friendly, Mobee.  I have scheduled my computer to shut down only after 5 hours of inactivity, so that my mouse will get a 5 hour charge every night.  I've been testing this for over two weeks, and my mouse has been at 5% battery the entire time, constantly warning me that it's about to die.  Seems that I have to turn off the mouse and leave it on the charger with my computer powered on, not in sleep mode, for 24 hours to get a full charge.  Obnoxious!!
B007XLLNP0|1|In the title of the product it says LP vinyl..  and was sent a CD version. looked back at the ad and in small print in the comments it says cd version of vinyl
B00CWY76CC|5|Additive and challenging! I couldn't put it down. I can't wait for more rooms to come out. This game rocks!
B00D23GXB2|5|This collection of poems is a recommendation for romantic nights or just plain wanting something to start up some foreplay before you get it in. The author is tremendously skilled as his craft and has what is known as descriptive prowess. You will feel tempted. Many of the poems are picturesque. In one piece, the author's great ability to storytell shines through. Another notable thing about this collection of poetry is the intensity of the poetry. If you are both a poetry and erotica enthusiast, this is the title to get. If you don't have this yet, stop hesitating and GET IT ASAP!

B000OY8NII|5|Welcome to EUREKA, the weirdest town in America, and also the title to the Sci-Fi Channel's inventive, breath of fresh air television series. Here's the set-up: When U.S. Marshal Jack Carter (Colin Ferguson) transports his rebellious, runaway daughter Zoey (Jordan Hinson) home in his custody, an auto accident lands him and his charge in Eureka, a top-secret, rustic town populated by eccentrics and genius scientists. Carter immediately becomes aware of Eureka's uniqueness as embodied in its odd residents who are more than they seem: an auto mechanic who's also a space shuttle engineer, a beautiful innkeeper who doubles as a psychotherapist, children who give intricate directions and who write mathematical formulas on the sidewalk...Added to the peculiar sights he witnesses, Carter's interest is further piqued when his offers to help the local constabulary in a missing child case is summarily rebuffed.<br /><br />In due course, he does learn the secret of Eureka, of which origin dates back to Albert Einstein and Harry S. Truman, who, after World War 2 and the scare of the atomic bomb, decided to build the tiny town as a safe haven and a workplace for our nation's greatest thinkers. In the fifty years of Eureka's existence, its residents have been hugely responsible for most of today's technological advances. But, of course, not everything can be a bonafide success. Global warming, for example, has been touted as one side effect of one experimental goof in Eureka. Sworn to secrecy, Jack Carter proves to be instrumental in resolving a horrific scientific project gone awry, impressing the powers-that-be enough that he ends up as the new Sheriff of Eureka.<br /><br />The series is colorfully flavored with a host of idiosyncratic characters effectively brought to life by a good cast: Carter's mutinous daughter Zoey (Jordan Hinson); the beautiful, gung-ho ex-Army Ranger and current Deputy Sheriff Josefina \\"Jo\\" Lupo (Erica Cerra, with whom I think I'm in love); Department of Defense agent Allison Blake (Salli Richardson-Whitfield), who toils as the government liaison between Eureka and the Pentagon and who, by the way, looks muy caliente in her pink undies; Nathan Stark (Ed Quinn), the icy, controlling head researcher of Global Dynamics and also Allison's husband; the insightful and sexy psychotherapist Beverly Barlowe (Debrah Farentino), who has dark secrets of her own; genial guy and mechanical genius Henry Deacon (Joe Morton), who slums as a car mechanic; the unstable Aussie Jim Taggart (Matt Frewer), the self-styled  \\"biological containment specialist\\"; and young Douglas Fargo (Neil Grayston), the bespectacled, sycophant computer geek. By the way, solely from a red-blooded dude's perspective, it's always appreciated when three gorgeous females are featured regularly in the same show, and Richardson-Whitfield, Farentino, and Cerra contribute in lifting EUREKA to new heights of must-see-TV-ness.<br /><br />Colin Ferguson's performance as Sheriff Jack Carter provides the bridge and the grounding point of view for the audience. As the witty, perceptive, and sometimes lost-at-sea Sheriff, he hits all the right notes here. His normal guy reactions to the endless slew of strangeness surrounding him are believable and, at times, hilarious. There's some nice verbal sparring (read: sexual tension) between Carter and Allison, but I particularly relish the chemistry *snicker* between Carter and his fully automated, hermetically sealed, very vocal military bunker/smart house, S.A.R.A.H.<br /><br />As a television series, EUREKA proved to be the highest-rated show on the Sci-Fi Channel of 2006, beating out the equally excellent, revamped BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. This exuberant show is equal parts X-FILES, TWILIGHT ZONE, STAR TREK and NORTHERN EXPOSURE in its playful quirkiness and forays into the weird; not to mention, the whistly, whimsical theme tune puts you immediately in sync with the show's oddball frequency.<br /><br />These are some of thetried and true sci-fi themes that are touched on: ESP, cloning, cell regeneration, mind manipulation, death rays, super speed, AIs, and nanotechnology. The laudable special effects are there when needed but do not overwhelm the show; the episodes are engrossing, if a bit warped at times, and the season's main story arc, involving the super  secret Section 5 and something called the Artifact, promises to go somewhere. I'm so glad the Sci-Fi Channel decided to renew this series for a second season. So, if you want to catch a show where crazy quantum physics regularly run amok, where wild inventions surface on a daily basis which are, by the way, gadgety cool enough to make even James Bond swoon, and where cheerleaders spout theorems and school nerds run the school, and also where the world is constantly threatened by the scientific lab toys of Eureka's brilliant but erratic personalities...well, then, yes, get your geek on and give EUREKA: SEASON ONE a whirl.tried and true sci-fi themes that are touched on: ESP, cloning, cell regeneration, mind manipulation, death rays, super speed, AIs, and nanotechnology.

B00DR0PDNE|5|It Works! Netflix and Youtube!
B00GMOR7LS|2|Going in to this movie I knew that it wasn't going to be great after seeing the reviews from other websites. That being said I still was not prepared to watch a horror movie that had absolutely no scares in it. I was hoping that I would at least get a couple cheap scares but this movie didn't even deliver that. If you are thinking about renting or buying this movies please don't.
B0018QOIXU|4|I thought this album was very good. It was a breath of fresh air in a musical drought. Some of the lyrics really caught me by surprise and I was so impressed by the lyricism of the album overall. The album had a lazy, somber feel to it that I really liked. My favorite song was \\"Melt My Heart to Stone\\" and \\"Best for Last\\". Anyone that buys this album won't regret it! ;^)
B005GSZZ1A|4|You cannot stop reading. A Dark story that keeps your interest. This book really makes you want to do something to solve the problem in North Korea.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5|Make servers plz other than that one of my favorite games thx 505 games
B009A9EPLM|5|John William's score and soundtrack for LINCOLN is just brilliant. It is very rich and pure Americana. It stands right beside his scores for AMISTAD and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. This is a very lush and melodic score and very much heartfelt to the spirit of Mister Lincoln and his times. I highly recommend this one.
B0050CJNJ2|5|After reading other reviews I decided to order the US version, big mistake as I then had to pay custom charge!!!! for 2 CD's it cost another £12.18 be aware...... I am getting over it, great CD just love this band.
B001AJ09JW|3|I had heard over the last ten years that the opening scene in this movie is one to be remembered.<br />And it was.<br />Excellent opening.<br />We have a luxury liner where everyone on board is killed back in the early 60's.<br />The ship vanishes.<br />Fast forward to the early 2000's and we have a pilot who spots the ship and enlists a local salvage crew.<br />The acting was surprisingly good for a horror movie.<br />Pacing, direction, score were all very good.<br />The ballroom scene reminded me of The Shining.<br />The movie had great atmosphere.<br />But then we get to...the explanation.<br />Ruined it.<br />Stupid, corny and lame.<br />A cgi cheese fest that destroyed what could have been a great sea/ghost picture.<br />It had so much potential but the ending sunk this ghost ship to the bottom of a sea of other forgettable bargin bin horror clunkers.<br />I'll recommend a rental since it's Halloween time but otherwise don't bother. There's too many other classics of the genre out there to be enjoyed.
B00I4582YY|5|Nice heavy album with all the art on the sleeve. Love it. And getting a digital copy was a great added bonus.
B00IP1CO4Q|5|Very well thought of movie.  Gives you a better understanding of autism, how it affects families, and how it can be overcome.  The movie's message gives hope to many families dealing with autistic children.<br />Claire Danes acting is excellent, really enjoyed her portrayal of Temple Grandin.

0446677450|2|I read Robert Kiyosaki's book \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" many years ago after hearing a multitude of individuals who had recently finished his \\"How To\\" guide.  I thought that since so many people found his book to be helpful that there must be some sage advice contained within that could better help my own financial future like it did Mr. Kiyosaki.<br /><br />I didn't realize until after I was finished that THIS BOOK is what drives the author's financial success.<br /><br />The author provides some (I stress SOME) positive ways to look at money as a whole and focus energy in your life, but I found his methods to be unrealistic overall.  The author states over and over how he is so rich and so successful because he made his own paths, but he forgets to mention that a lot of luck and great timing came into play (like his timing of success as it relates to the sales of the velcro wallets).<br /><br />I don't doubt that the author believes in what he writes, but one of his earliest and most important pieces of \\"advice\\" is to not buy a home, instead recommending to rent for the long term.  Isn't this something that is learned in Finance 101?  I am sorry, but unless you have some amazing deal, you should always try to put your money into a home instead of just burning it away by putting it into rent payments month after month.  This is just one example of Mr. Kiyosaki's unrealistic approach to obtaining financial freedom.<br /><br />The impression that I got after reading \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" (and also after reading one of his numerous book sequels - I only read one of them) is that the author used his timing and luck to build up a bankroll to start his career.  With this early wealth, he then decided that he would jump on the self-help bandwagon and push his own ideas to try and sell to the masses.  Because of the nature of people to always be searching for a \\"quick fix\\" to everything in their lives, the author stumbled upon an even bigger way to achieve financial freedom, and the \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" empire was begun.<br /><br />Overall, I think that the author's \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" has some decent points to inspire you to try and make it on your own in this world as it relates to your financial freedom, but if you are looking to achieve that by reading this book, save your money and put it into something else (like buying a home).<br /><br />** NOT RECOMMENDEDdom, and the \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" empire was begun. <br /> <br />Overall, I think that the author's \\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" has some decent points to inspire you to try and make it on your own in this world as it relates to your financial freedom, but if you are looking to achieve that by reading this book, save your money and put it into something else (like buying a home). <br /> <br />** NOT RECOMMENDED
B007V2UGPE|5|Everybody needs to at least give this game a chance. The decide 4 yourself. I like this game alot............ And it looks awesome on my Galaxy Touch 2
B0063GORYU|4|Is a good game. Plays well and does not cause any issues. Do not have any issues with it. I would re-download of necessary.
B004DLPXAO|5|This is by far my favorite application for e-books.Combine this with the outstanding assortment of books from Amazon and you're on your way to reading heaven. There are frequent, non-obtrusive updates that make this application all the more appealing.
B00AMBK0X4|5|Who wouldnt want a talking teddy to grow up with and smoke weed with. Truly inspirational. Plus mila kunis always a good choice
B004KBSQBA|5|I can't say enough good things about this CD. This version also has some previously unreleased versions of a couple songs which was a great surprise.
B007SYWFRM|5|It's super dynamic and entretaining. Great and Scratz it's crazy and super fun. Also, the other villages are super cute.
B004HW7JMO|5|Gods of the Arena gives nice insight to some of our favorites from the main show. Gannicus and Oenomaus are two of my favorites, and each character gets some welcome attention in this short six episode prequel. Of course, it's nice to see the machinations and shenanigans of John Hannah and Lucy Lawless once again as well, as this collection shows their rise to power in the arena.<br /><br />If you like Starz's &#34;Spartacus&#34;, then this is a must-add.
B00FRVH3V6|5|Absolutely Loved it! How could you not love Greek mythology in a modern Era? So sad to see it end, But alas all good things must come to an end. I was a late comer to this series as my sister introduce me to the Percy Jackson series about 3 years ago. After devouring them she informed me there was this wonderful continuing series that enhanced the pervious books and brought more characters for the readers to love. So though I maybe in my early 20's and not a \\"Child\\" whom the audience is subscribed for, but as a person who loves Greek and Rome Literature and History I found that this series is truly amazing and perfect for all ages.<br /><br />This book was the culminating epic finale of the Heroes of Olympus series which Rick Riordan wrote perfectly. Ever character is shown (or mentioned) once more from the first series, as in the Percy Jackson Series, to help the readers feel all is complete. I am happy to report that Riordan did this in a very tasteful way and didn't just do it to make readers happy. When I say he did this tastefully the author crafted this concluding book very thoughtfully with the intent to give closure to his characters and subsequently his readers.<br /><br />In regards to that I must say that is perhaps why these books are so enthralling. Riordan crafts them not for money as some authors do, but for his audience which have grown up over the years just as the characters have grown up too. So in aging the characters and allowing each of them to battle metaphorical and real battles the readers find themselves captivated and relating in someways.<br /><br />Overall I'm sad this is the final book in this amazing series which truly had me devoting every word and hoping for everyone's HEA. Percy and Annebeth's relationship will still always be my favorite but I think Piper and Jason's is a close second now. Either way I highly recommend getting addicted to this whole series from Percy Jackson till the very end of The Heroes of Olympus.
0805076476|5|As we approach ten years since the original publication of Fight Club, we can look back and say that it is THE novel of the nineties.  The nineties were a decade when Americans (and most of the Western world) sat as comfortably as any group of people in the history of the world.  Major international conflict seemed gone with the end of the Cold War, crime at home was on a marked decline, and the stock market and economy were soaring.    Amidst all that comfort, Americans were able to look at themselves, at their place in it all.  All they found was emptiness.      Fight Club shows that emptiness taking form, where people without purpose band together like a cult, and go on a massive rampage of destruction and mayhem.     \\"We are the middle children of history, raised by television to believe that someday we'll be millionaires and movie stars and rock stars, but we won't.\\"
0452285186|5|Totally sick book and great fun for anyone looking for a five minute distraction from the day!
B002XTXG1G|3|This movie is an arthouse masterpiece. It has the color, feel, intensity and show of high performance art but as a movie it just somehow misses the mark. Don't get me wrong the acting, directing and photography are here in epic and stylish proportions but any sense of actual storyline is swallowed up by quick film edits and theater.<br />  Tom Hardy is amazing and takes the role of the real life BRONSON, Michael Peterson, into the top tier of acting talent. He's that good. Peterson/aka Charles Bronson is Britain's most violent prisoner, which the film easily demonstrates but I'd rather have seen more of the actual dark journey involved than quick snippets and high art.<br />  I actually think that I liked the extras and commentary on the DVD more than I liked the film.
B0041OJ0Y8|4|Its a new spin on hip hop.. good stuff.  The dj has some good beats.  I like ninja..its not supposed to be overly serious.
B00M7UTFW0|1|I somehow forced myself through this movie.  Worst movie I have seen in a while.  Not sure why such good actors agreed to these roles.

030726999X|4|To those of you who aren't up to speed with Larsson's trilogy, I am going to try my best to avoid giving things away, but it's not going to be easy.<br /><br />In the last book, The Girl Who Played With Fire, Lisbeth Salander-- portrayed as being worse than the Devil himself by media and police-- confronted her very real, very human, demons. In this book, she realizes that confronting them is not enough. She is going to have to destroy them. What goes against her grain is that she is forced to trust journalist Mikael Blomkvist, even to the point of letting him run large sections of the show.<br /><br />This book even more than the previous two relies on intricate plotting and the pieces fitting together exactly. This book, more than the other two, showed unevenness and sections that needed a much sterner hand at editing. Because the plot was intricate, Larsson spent pages explaining various government agencies, how they were set up, the people they reported to, and so on. These were the sections of the book that made my eyes glaze over.<br /><br />Another subplot involving Erika Berger, the former editor of Millennium magazine, although illustrating what many women have to deal with in male-dominated sections of the workforce, was really unnecessary and moved the focus away from the most fascinating characters: Salander and Blomkvist. Even Salander's trip to Gibraltar could have been shortened.<br /><br />Any time the action moved away from that two-character focus, the book began to drag, which is why I feel that it would have benefited from stricter pruning. But was I greatly disappointed in the book? No. I had to see the outcome of Lisbeth Salander's story. Was she going to succeed? How was she going to succeed?<br /><br />Larsson has given me a wonderful offbeat Dulcinea and her Don Quixote. I may always wonder what the books would have become if Larsson had been allowed to work on them himself, but the characters will always remain: a young woman who refused to accept that everyone else was more important than she, and the man who believed her.rtant than she, and the man who believed her.
B005T87QCI|5|hey for the people complaining that atom and zeus aint there........LOOK AT THE STORE CUZ THEY GOT ATOM AND ZEUS AND THREE OTHERS FOR 3.99 IF U BUY THEM IN THE PACK AND THEY EVEN GOT TWIN CITIES!!!!! I LOVE THIS GAME!!!
B000FBFN1U|4|Good book...I mean there isn't much I can add that other people haven't already said. I'm not normally into these fantasy type tales but I really dig these books and the TV show even more.
B00BEZTMFY|3|Thanks to amazon for quick and no hassle return and rep lament however the DVD materials used to make copies are defective. Both the first and second copies freezes and not worth keeping the DVD copies though I was able to watched it however so many scenes stops, freezes and then continue. I watched lots of DVD on the same DVD player I know it's the copies not my player is defective!! I hope amazon will still replace my copy. I love The Hobbit movie and I like to have my own DVD collection.
B001NZEHMS|5|This is the album that put the Beasties on the map and, along with Run DMC, revolutionized the genre.  Slinging rhymes in their unique staccato style and lyrical mastery, the Beastie Boys and [[ASIN:B0000024JN Licensed to Ill]] was Eminem for the for the 80s generation.
B005UDD1R6|1|I tried to get this app to stream to my Chromecast and could not get it to work.  Oh it also sucks battery life big time.
B003QSEYQY|5|Fun movie!
0470449748|5|This is exactly what I was looking for. It is a great tool to help me try and accomplish my goal
6305736650|5|Another great old classic had to add it to my collection. Winner of 3 academy awards including best picture. Include some of the great actors and actress and I am good to go. Loved the movie.
B000FA5STS|1|I actually gave it a 4 stars but I don't know if it registered!
B00EL8JCGU|5|This is a great movie. I'm not a zombie film fan but this film has a quality seldom seen in a horror film. I highly recommend this movie. The acting is believable and keeps to on the edge of your seat throughout.
B002RI90WM|4|If you love dogs and have a great sense that dogs have special minds, souls and feelings this book will reinforce your views. A really heart wrenching book that any dog lover can relate to.
B0063GORYU|5|Just awesome. Simple to play, lots of options. Hours of entertainment. Great addition to my library of games . I highly recommended this game.
B00000JCOV|5|I think this album is great. The percussionists sound cool. # 11 has a great beggining. All of the songs are good. The only problem is that i can't listen to it around parents, so i have to keep the volume low. Great  album, go get it.
B006GWO5NE|5|Great Product!
B0007Z4S4C|5|See...the little flying one beaming from the \\"world without fear\\" (The Enchanter).  The picture on the cover draws you right in!  All the complexities of the human soul fanning out and up...I'm intrigued... this recording must have something for me (on top of tickling the Zeppelin chromosome that got fired up in the early 70's with me).  My sweet & wonderful wife picked this up for me for Father's day knowing that I love stuff like this (a true gift, since she doesn't), but as a surprise - MAN, WAS I SURPRISED BY THIS!  I have the whole Zeppelin collection and a few other off-shoot albums of band members (including older Plant) that I've always loved, but I haven't heard the last few Plant albums for the most part.  Guess I've been missing out!  Mighty Rearranger takes you on quite a journey through politics, spirituality, introspection, nostalgia, wisdom and plain old \\"60's revolution\\" psychedelia blended with 70's rock power, world influences & modern musical innovation.  What a great collection of new original songs, and this band is really fun.  I've been into guitar & bass for almost 30 years and this appeals to that interest, but I have been into drumming lately too and this is really fun in that regard (in other words, fun to jam with).  Pick up an instrument and shake it up with Plant and Strange Sensation...\\"Mixing up a potion of laughter and love\\"...Well, smiles all around AND I LOVE IT (the whole thing)!  YOU ROCK!!  Not sure why all of the lyrics weren't included, but I love the surprise reprise bonus at the end.  54:21 minutes (don't know if that includes the fairly long extra song)
B00AHTYGRW|3|Yeah, so this movie is for all those who nev saw WTD. Let's create a faux movie to distract from the real political issue.  Change era, change crew, cast and give it 5 stars?  Nahhhhhh, I'd much rather reWatch The Kingdom.  Course that's just me, I like suspense, action and a moovie that intrigues.
B002VECM6S|5|a great movie which one can enjoy watching more than once--good price , so worth it and would recommend it for all
B00BSZZA3I|5|This case turned out to be much more than expected.  The flip case can be perfectly used as a stand for the phone on my desks as I use certain application and view photos or video on the phone.  The phone is protected by the case when I am carrying it around and is easily accessible.
B00DUGCLY4|5|This game is fun sometimes makes you feel silly cause the answer is so simple but its very addicting and could keep you playing forever
0812975219|1|I'll save you the trouble. Here's the deal: Play long shots, just not too many of them. The rest is probably the worst writing I've ever encountered.
B009FZHYKU|5|I'm not much for horror / gore but this character driven show is the exception.  I turn my  head through the really gory parts so I can watch the development of these complicated characters. Great show!
B00HCOSF3G|5|Great!
B00004SWBS|5|Great cd and some of Type O Negatives most memorable quality in one recording, whatever buy every TON recordade they're all great!
B00A2IUDO8|4|It was an entertaining and humorous movie that was very good.
B000066NW0|5|I just got Avril Lavignes, &quot;Let Go&quot; a couple days ago and i havent put it down since! her cd is something so new since for the past few years i have been surrounded by Britney Spears and all that other pop music and she takes a big leap from that. Her music is so different and great that it is my favorite CD! If you dont have it yet you better get it soon!
B00KZ6WRAA|1|disappointed....it crashed my kindle fire
B006PHD0RW|5|I think the best games for android are usually physics based. flinging birds, you making bridges, riding a motorcycle or a cart, all of them can be challenging and entertainment but all of them are the same exact game with a different variables. this game Bag It, is definitely challenging like tetris, the manages to be very fun and entertaining. as far is casual games go this one is up there with the best of them. on top of all sleeping very funny, there are weird challenges and different types of games. save the eggs, crash the melons, stack the bread, it's all good and fun. I would like to think the developers hidden variable studios for bringing such a quality games to the amazon market for free.
B00FAPF5U0|4|It's fun, I like this more than crush.
034580404X|5|Enjoyed reading these books!!
B0000636UN|5|I'm not the biggest Sheryl Crow fan in the world, but I have to admit this is one awesome album. It is one that you will sing along with on each song. It is by far the most entertaining release since her first album. The song &quot;Soak up the Sun&quot; is probably the most infectious song this year. &quot;Steve McQueen&quot; is also an excellent track that you can't get out of your head when you hear it. &quot;You're An Original&quot; is another song that would be perfect for radio. It's rare that an artist can be so creative and still come up with music that is so catchy and radio-friendly. This is a top notch release that is a &quot;must have.&quot;
B00HXYKYIE|4|I thoroughly enjoyed Leaving Time. Picolt's characters were masterfully developed.  They were intelligent, interesting and &#34;demensional&#34;. The elephants, however, took center stage!  Picoult does an excellent job of weaving educational information about elephants into the main story. I can't imagine anyone reading this book without developing a real appreciation or affinity for these great animals.  Leaving Time is a novel to keep and read again.
6304117302|5|Oh, yeah.  This is the best movie I have ever seen.  Daniel Day Lewis is awesome in it.  Who cares if it is 8 years old, you have to see it if you appreciate good movies!
1400052181|5|Through all my schooling and my searching through Black History, I had never heard of Henrietta Lacks. The medical terms will slow you down, but so far it is a fascinating book.<br />We should be teaching this is our schools.
B009SKPVO8|5|I have had this Case Logic Quick sling for about 7 months now and have already tested it on several trips. The shoulder pad is comfortable, able to carry the load of Canon 70D, battery grip and an 18-135mm lens, and the sling all-in-all is value for money at this price range as compared to the more expensive BlackRapid straps (Take note: I also have one of the cheaper BlackRapid sling -- Crosshot).<br /><br />The only drawback is the mounting attachment which as pointed out by some reviewers juts out too much, more than an inch, such that you have to unscrew it if it prevents you from putting the camera with the strap in your camera bag quickly. More over, the design of the mounting attachment is that it has to screwed which time and again will take up some time.<br />The solution to this problem was I replaced it with FOTOTECH Quick Release Trigger Snap hook Ring I got here from Amazon. Perfect. TheCase logic sling and the Fototech Snap Hook Ring is still way much cheaper than the BlackRapid Crosshot I have. Best Value combo in my opinion.
B00J8CGU64|2|The movie didn't have to be 3 hours long, the plot could have moved much faster and a better movie would've clocked at an hour and a half. Letting this movie run that long was overindulgent.
B008XG1X18|4|Love it
B00NEQRNVG|5|I want more!!!!
B004FRX0MY|5|Great app for downloading your favorite music.
B000K7UBTI|4|THE INVINCIBLE IRON MAN retcons the Iron Man mythos to a degree.  Given that Tony Stark was originally wounded in Vietnam in the 1960s and he would have been in his sixties, something had to be done.  So the creators brought the story into \\"now\\" and still maintained an Asian flavoring by setting Iron Man up against the Mandarin, one of Shellhead's oldest and coolest foes.<br /><br />Die-hard purists are going to be disappointed in some aspects of the film, but it delivers enough action and characterization to get the job done.  Strangely, though, we don't really get to know that much about Tony or his relationship with his dad, Howard Stark.  We don't even get to know anything about why he created the Iron Man armor when he plainly states in the movie that he's never invented weapons.  The Iron Man armor has been compared to a human-sized F16 fighter jet loaded to the gills with munitions and destructive power.  Not to mention all the other cool, on-board technology.<br /><br />The plot centers on Tony's efforts to help China raise a sunken city to engender goodwill that results in very profitable trade agreements.  However, the Jade Dragons -- a local group -- have attacked the dig site on a number of occasions to stop the city's recovery.  But Stark's technology is successful and the city returns to the surface.  Unfortunately, that return also heralds of the mystical forces that will ultimately resurrect the Mandarin.<br /><br />I'm not sure if pitting a technology-based hero against the supernatural was a good idea for a first Iron Man movie.  For the fans like me, it wouldn't have been that much of a reach bccause we'd all be familiar with the Mandarin (though I'm pretty sure the comics alluded to the fact that the Mandarin's rings were alien tech at one point and not mystical).  But newcomers might be expected to see a technology versus technology battle, and that's really lacking here.<br /><br />I didn't like the fact that S.H.I.E.L.D. was onstage mainly as the bad guys, or at least an opposing force, without any face time to put a more positive spin on them.  Nick Fury and his agents are some of my favorite characters.<br /><br />There was a lot to like about the straight-to-DVD presentation, though.  The use of CGI animation throughout the film was good, and so were the action sequences.  One of the other BIG pluses was that a LOT of the other Iron Man armor was shown.  The specialized deep-sea armor took center stage during one battle.  And many of the other suits were on display.<br /><br />Some of the scenes felt rushed, and plot development was thin.  The Mandarin was late in getting into the mix, though the four Elementals working on his behalf were there, and never quite came to fruition as a real threat.<br /><br />But the chance to see Iron Man onscreen in your living room is just too good to pass up.  Buy this one for comic geeks' night, or for the kids.  Then have a seat with your friends or your children, and get down to a night of superheroing Iron Man style.inly as the bad guys, or at least an opposing force, without any face time to put a more positive spin on them.

B008K9UZY4|5|Fun.
B0031KC8OM|5|Smart writing and compelling plots are the reasons why I give five stars. There aren't too many shows that keep me guessing, and I never guessed the murderer before it was revealed to me. Some of the individual episodes were more predictable, but the mystery of the overall arc of the season was amazing.
B003L77GRO|5|What can I say about Dexter!  I watched him the first season when we didn't have to pay for it, but then they went to Showtime.  Since then, I have had to buy the series.  I have not watched these yet, but I know I will love them!
B006885FZI|3|Enjoyed the story ... Would have liked to get to know some of the characters more.

0316017922|4|Falling into the category of books that I like to call \\"Why things are/happen,\\" Malcolm Gladwell lays out in Outliers a set of stories and studies about success, and it's antithesis failure, with a quick pace and interesting thesis--success is not necessarily the bastion of the smart or wealthy, but a combination of genius, culture, and timing.<br /><br />Although I had initially thought Outliers would be a \\"how you too can get rich and be successful,\\" I soon realized that while conclusions and policies suggestions might be gleaned from the chapters and stories, the book was more interesting for its pure explanation of seemingly inexplicable events.<br /><br />For example: why are hockey players more likely to be born in January, February or March than September, October or November? Why are Asians better at math than Americans? How can knowing ones birth in New York predict ones profession?<br /><br />Serious. And interesting. I could not put it down, and I found my mind stimulated from the first page to the last, and still I keep finding my mind returning to the ideas and possibilities it presents.
B004GHNIRK|4|This is the great and very interesting book to read.So for your great experience, pls. try it as soon. :-)
B008JFUPFI|5|I went with my mom and some friends to see this movie. we walked in after getting popcorn and drinks. we walked it and it was packed. we barely found a seat that we could sit together. there are some great actors and actresses in this movie. Some you will know from other movies and tv shows. I loved it. I was secpital because we wented the dark knight rises and it had high ratings and we didn't like it. so I was secpital about this movie but I am glad i went to see it. you will love it but it doesn't start out like the other super man movies and tv shows does. that is just a heads up.
B009FZHYKU|5|I really enjoy this series. I like the fact that you can get these shows the very next day after they air on AMC.
6304698755|5|The perfect vehicle for Cary Grant? His character is an angel who is charming, suave, witty, good with children and animals and invariably correct with his advice. Grant is the consummate professional. Oh, Loretta Young and David Niven aren't so bad either. It's best viewed in December and almost as good the other eleven months of the year. No disrespect to Denzel, but you can't beat the original.
B006G35EEC|5|This is a great movie!!! I grew up watching it as a little girl and finally got to share it with my daughters, who happen to be twins. They loved it!
B008K6HN8I|5|it works on my rooted phone! (xperia go)<br />and it works swift and simple!<br />you see what you are doing and where everything is.<br />old fashion style file manager . as it should be!

B00Y3IOI7G|5|Challenging game and for once, it was more than just one evening's fun! In fact, the Bonus game was longer than some games I've paid as much as $4.99 for. I certainly feel this game was worth the money (I paid $2.99). The puzzles were very challenging to me. I had some very minor technical issues because I finally gave up and skipped a couple of the puzzles, which caused a bump in the flow. However, if I backed out to the Main Menu and went back in to the game after a minute, all would be okay. Definitely recommend this one!
B008602KQI|5|Loved the movie.  This is the second DVD I ordered -- this one was for showing at my place of work.
B00005QZ7U|5|The movie was spectacular spectacular! Nicole Kidman is a Prostitute who falls in love and sings all about it with co-star Ewan McGregor. A musical romance with theatrical comedy. I gave this movie 5 stars because it made me laugh, it made me cry, it made want to watch it again and again. It's a great movie please see at least once for you're sakes.
B0064MT1SA|5|This is one of the best movies about an artist or in this case artists that I have ever seen. It is historically acute,visually stunning, intellectually stimulating all awhile you connect her life with her work. You see all these people very accurately, it will make you laugh, cry, hold your breath, be in awe, ETC!!! Treat yourself and own this movie, seeing it once will not satisfy your curiosity about the people in it. Since it is an Art movie, the Blu Ray is even more amazing than the regular CD, so I had to upgrade and am so glad I did!!!
B00HZVX1C6|5|Good music
B0042TV4IW|5|Just finished season 1 and I loved it! BBC has risen to the cream of the crop once again. Looking forward to watching the next seasons.

Because he was still healing from plastic sugery from a car accident.  The acting cheesy and I believe supposed to be that way by lucas.  But this was a truely fresh view.   I only bought this set on Blu Ray as I have episode 1, 2 and 3 already.  I highly reccoment this for fans and maybe a Christmas gift. All 3 movies being $39.99.  Besides Han shooting first In movie 4.  I see no real changes for the worse. Only better.  This In Blu Ray does get 5 stars easy. One of the best Blu Ray copies I've seen.  I never realized how big into the story the 2 droids were.   Lots to see for the first time. I highly reccomend if at all a fan.

B000066NW0|5|I don't really listen to the radio much, but one day I did stumble on &quot;Complicated&quot; playing the airwaves. After one listen I was like, &quot;Who is this?&quot; and after that I was like, &quot;How do I pronounce her name?&quot; Well, all mysteries aside I hurried to pick up Avril's whole cd the day it came out and after one listen I wasn't disappointed. I would rate the songs indivually as follows.<BR>1. &quot;Losing Grip&quot; A<BR>2. &quot;Complicated&quot; A+<BR>3. &quot;Sk8er boi&quot; A+ (this song is fun)<BR>4. &quot;I'm With You&quot; B+<BR>5. &quot;Mobile&quot; B<BR>6. &quot;Unwanted&quot; A<BR>7. &quot;Tomorrow&quot; A-<BR>8. &quot;Anything But Ordinary&quot; A+ (yeah, this is my theme song)<BR>9. &quot;Things I'll Never Say&quot; A-<BR>10. &quot;My World&quot; B-<BR>11. &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; A-<BR>12. &quot;Too Much To Ask&quot; B<BR>13. &quot;Naked&quot; B<br />All in all I love this girl's attitude and i look forward to her next cd.
B005USZML4|5|The storyline is excellent, but I felt that Mr. Grisham left his readers hanging!  i.e. Who was the body found floating in the river? Was it perhaps the husband of the wife who was murdered?  Very confusing...  Is Mr. Grisham planning a 4th book in the \\"Theo Boone\\" Series?  All three of the Boone series books were well-written, though, and each one's storyline was interesting to the serious reader.  I thoroughly enjoyed the quite factual legal proceedings. Young Theo is a very interesting potential criminal lawyer in years to come.

B001NP8PQW|4|This is a GREAT performance by The Cure. The BD itself has a decent to good picture quality and the sound is EXCELLENT.
B00004U5SC|5|&quot;Shane&quot; is one of the ten best movies I've ever seen, fourth after &quot;Forbidden Planet,&quot;  &quot;Superman:The Movie,&quot; and &quot;Captain Sinbad.&quot;   This movie's got something for everybody: a good fight for kids, romance for women, and the best duel ever for us guys!  The music is great--and if you listen carefully, you'll hear the beginning of the &quot;Batman&quot; theme near the end of the movie!--the photography is great, and everything else is great!   The promoters were right when they said, &quot;There will never be another western like &quot;Shane!&quot;   Come back, Shane!
B001437DMA|3|Sort of dissapointed with this one. Joe seemed board until the end of the CD. The last to songs are the best. His latest is way better! As of Dec 2012, This cd has grown on me. It's up to 4 good songs.

B00CX7TOTQ|3|The film trys to tell a story of morality and redemption around what is supposed to be an action flick.  The actors are of course good (although I can't quite buy Travolta as a Serb even though he tries hard) but I wasn't sure if the story was a condemnation of War or a celebration of the spirit of man trying to rise above his past bad acts.  Not as good as I'd hoped but ok.

B005K2KCPG|4|This is an interesting album.  In my opinion, a refined version of the previous album.  If you are purchasing this album to hear Sammy/Mike VH or Joe the technician in solo you won't find it.  This is a new band, a new concept by impassioned musicians.  Chickenfoot iii is a studio creation perfection unlike the prior album where the band comes together as a group rather than efforts of individual musicians.    Listened to without comparison of previous work by any musician, this album is outstanding.  Each musician has their own trademarks.  They are brought together seamlessly in this album.    I remember Sammy saying at a VH concert how hard it was to be screaming in concert all the time.  In this album, he sings without screaming and uses his loud voice for pushing parts of the lyrics.    A critic said none of the music 'sticks'.  A new music composer once said that young people like repetition in there music, it makes the music memorable - makes me think they are ADHD.  No massive repetition here - Sammy tells his stories in his lyrics.  Chickenfoot repetition comes from playing the album again and again.   A true reinvention of themselves...  enjoy.
B008JGSM6G|5|The logical sequence and &quot;flow&quot; to the game is a thinkers paradise. To see the patterns on the boards is a gratifying feeling. This is not another action knockoff, but a true test of perseverance and thought. The designers of this game are to be congratulated. Ten out of ten or more for my rating.
B001K3ENEA|5|AKG is a quality headphone manufacturer and doesn't, put something out that is bad. This K44 ain't bad. It's rather terrific and must be there for the low end market but the sound is first class. I am very happy with this item.
B00BMKDTNC|5|Thank you Mr. Jordan and Mr. Sanderson.  You have given me countless hours of swimming through my imagination and itno yours.
B005LAIHR2|2|Wow! I actually watched my youth destroyed tonight. Virtually every song I ever loved was butchered by a nasal Julianna Hough. Diego Boneta, a name I had never heard before tonight wasn't too bad. The scene with Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand singing, \\"Candle in the Wind\\" by REO Speedwagon was the final nail in my coffin. Although they were not half bad, it was disturbing. That song was an anthem of love for teen girls in the 80's. I don't think I will ever get that image out of my head. Tom Cruise's character Stacy Jaxx reminded me of what I think he would be like in real life, a total space cadet.<br /><br />I had not idea it was a musical when I got there. I now understand it was a musical, but is there such a thing as too much music in a musical? I had to laugh or I would have cried. I am not sure if this was supposed to be a tribute to the 80's or if it was meant to mock everything that was fun about the 80's. At least my son and I had a good laugh. I plan to buy the dvd for people in my life that I want to ruin their youth too. I expect it to sell for less than a dollar.

B0014VQGX4|3|First, let me tell you that I love Bruder prodcuts and the attention to detail.  However, I am somewhat disappointed in the fact that 2 of the 4 that I have recently purchased (all through Amazon), have broken parts within months of purchase.  This is with limited-to-normal use by one boy.  The first item was the Bruder JCB Midi CX Loader Backhoesold by Amazon.com which wsa delivered to me on March 31, 2014.  That item broke about 3.5 months when the front loader connector attaching it broke making re-attachmet impossible.  The second item, the Bruder CATERPILLAR Track-Type tractor was delivered to me on March 28, 2014 and also sold direct by Amazon.com.  That item broke in about 3 months when the smoke stack exhaust snapped off.  In April and May, also from Amazon, I purchased the Bruder Mack Granite Dump Truck  and the Bruder Mack Granite Cement Mixer both of which have held up quite well and are used more frequently by my son.  I have written to Bruder (July 26th) directly and are awaiting a response.  If resolved, I would give these items 5 stars, but due to the cost and the current state of disrepair of 50% of my purchases, I have to say only 3 stars (which is high considering 2 are broken, but they are that good!).

B000001G6W|5|This recording of the Ninth is widely celebrated and sometimes ranked as the best version Karajan offered (the Penguin, for example). I haven't heard all of his recordings of this symphony, but would agree that, in comparison with his 1963 version, this is much better. I also agree that it is one of the great Ninths. Karajan is never just routine in this recording, he always surprises you with great lush playing alternating with fast and biting tempos. The finale is particularly impressive: the playing is just tremendous. The lovely passages at the end of the third movement are hauntingly beautiful and the first two movements are exciting, whilst not sacrificing genuine feeling. This is all capped off by a very successful quartet of soloists. Jose van Dam really deserves highest praise and he never sounds strained. This part isn't easy to pull off, so he's work is notably impressive. Tomowa-Sintow is completely different to Janowitz, but sounds just as good. Baltsa has that distinctive voice to offer and Schreier's performance is satisfactory but nothing more. Overall, it ranks third for me in the list of Beethoven Ninth recordings: the Furtwangler 1951 performance at Bayreuth and Solti's 1972 version reach Olympian heights. But that doesn't take away from Karajan's achievement here, which definitely deserves five stars.

0316776963|5|Me Talk Pretty One Day is the 3rd book I've read by David Sedaris in short succession, and it's the best one thus far.  Like Holidays on Ice and Dress Your Family in Corduroy and Denim, it's filled with the Sedaris trademark self-deprecating humor.  But unlike the previous two books, it has much less of a dark-side.  The 28 stories are almost divided in two.  The first part of the book is dedicated to American living.  The second half deals with his trying to survive as an American living in France.<br /><br />The stories about France are the funniest of the bunch.  The French think Sedaris represents all Americans, and they're quick to scold him that American's are prudes (during the Clinton impeachment) or that their tariffs are too high (when the price of American products goes up).  The French are sometimes seen as aloof.  \\"The French have decided to ignore our self-proclaimed superiority, and this is translated as arrogance.  To my knowledge, they've never said that they're better than us; they've just never said that we're the best.\\"  Even more confusing is trying to figure out the French language.  All nouns are assigned a sex, and it's often something that defies logic.  \\"Hysteria, psychosis, torture, depression,\\" Niagara Falls, Georgia, Florida and New England are all feminine.<br /><br />\\"Murder, toothache, and Rollerblade,\\" sandwich, corn, string beans, the Grand Canyon, Montana, and Utah are all masculine.  Sedaris gives up trying to figure them out, and just orders things in two or more.  By using the plural, one uses the plural article rather than the article that reflects gender.  This gets a bit expensive when Sedaris starts ordering two appliances, chickens, etc.  It's also hard to store everything.<br /><br />One funny story has Sedaris taking an IQ test with Mensa.  He is crushed when he receives the results and discovers that he's not even close to being classified a genius.  Still, I think that Sedaris is a keen observer of life and a brilliant writer.  In the long run, I think those things are more important than IQ any day.nt writer.  In the long run, I think those things are more important than IQ any day.   <br />

B0087GF8ZG|5|I put one at the top and one at the bottom of a dark staircase.  They work everytime in the night making the stairs much safer.

B009NY43NY|1|First of all, I have read all the books in this series and really expected Harris to finish it out better than she did.  What's with the open ending?  No epilogue or anything to give us closure?  Harris may say she wanted readers to have their own interpretation on what happens but it's her job as a writer to tell us what happens.  Anyway, giving it one star just for the ending alone although I didn't think the book as a whole was great regardless.

B00003CXTG|5|I thought that this movie was great! I can't believe that so many people hated this movie! I thought that the acting and special effects were great! The cast was strong, and each actor portrayed their character wonderfully. The love story was the love triangle that everyone complains about, but it was classic and touching. For all of the people out there who only liked the 30 minute attack scene... did you really expect that the whole movie was going to be like that?? I personally think that Michael Bay did a great job recreating that devestating day and the events after it. This movie definately deserves 5 stars!!

I was tickled to read that he felt that the most extravagant purchase for him during his life was his purchase of a Parrish oil that he acquired from me.  He asked me to deliver it and hang it for him in his house.  I noticed that there was NO furniture in his home,except for a few utilitarian articles.  When I left, however, he had a magnificent Parrish oil hanging on his wall.  Alma Gilbert-Smith

B005RUUUAI|5|I discovered Walking Dead in the third season. I thought that it couldn't possibly be a show that I would like. Was I ever wrong! (I am a Downton Abbey, Jane Austen, Masterpiece Theater, Homeland, and The Good Wife type of fan.) This show is not just about blood and gore. It's more about people, relationships, hope, endurance, survival, and faith. I bought Season 1 and Season 2 to catch up and get all the back histories of the characters and situations. It's incredible. I watch it on my Kindle when I am working out at the gym, and it keeps me going for at least 45 minutes on the elliptical. The biggest problem is that I embarrass myself by gasping and covering my mouth involuntarily while at the gym. (It is scary!) I highly recommend this show, and it is great watching it on my Kindle.

I love the development of Christian and how he goes throguh all of the stages to get to the end.  I was happy with the way the triology ended.
B0000025H4|5|This was THE pivotal point in Priest's career. It took their earlier, cult material to the masses - and made them instant metal classics - through a sound that was much edgier, more powerful than the studio versions. No true metal fan would not have this in his/her collection. &quot;Victim of Changes&quot; sends chills down your spine with Halford showing off his skilled range in an epic form that runs the spectrum of dynamics - from soft to blazing. Not many metal tunes exhibited this sophistication - then or now. &quot;Green Manalishi&quot; and &quot;Diamonds and Rust&quot; are examples of how a band can cover 2 completely non-metal songs and turn them into quality interpretations rather than parodies. &quot;The Ripper&quot; - classic!, &quot;Sinner&quot; - deadly, &quot;Tyrant&quot; -awesome! This line-up also features the much more interesting Les Binks on drums (rather than Dave Holland on later albums). He provides some tasty cuts that give the band a very tight sound.    If you never bought early Priest albums - this is THE disc to get.

0307595579|5|A tragedy of epic proportions; we will never read additional work  from Larsson as he's now deceased! \\"Wow,\\" doesn't even begin to cover the exhaustively complex plot that leaves one breathless in anticipation for the next page.  Larsson had me from page one with an extremely complicated prose ( as first) which lays the groundwork for a story that simply cannot be easily solved or understood until the very end; a stunning, terribly potent read.<br /><br />Do not be put off by the first forty pages or so, the promise of an excellent book was always there but it is a \\"slow-burn,\\" which doesn't begin to realize it's potential until that time. The story needs this foundation so that it may be understood as things race along in the story's progression.<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander, a greatly demoralized girl who is a genius, becomes key in a story of insane human dysfunction, crime and [human] discipline as she unravels a mystery with not an ounce of confidence, relying on instincts of self-preservation and extreme intellect alone. She begins an unlikely alliance with Millennium Editor-and-Chief, Mikael Bloomkvist, and together, they are much more than apart. For the first time in her life, her asocial behavior is put to the test when she discovers there may be another human being worthy of her trust. A character portrait the likes of which I've never read.<br /><br />Bloomkvist is railroaded into a terrible position and must serve time for a crime whose validity is cast-in-shadow. Simultaneously, he is asked to use his extensive investigative abilities to find new clues to a very old disappearance. When it becomes apparent that there is much more than that, he involves Salander, which by her very being changes both their lives. Moral dilemma and professional ethics battle fiercely in the last third of the book when the two do not know which to be bound by.<br /><br />Although the characterization is excellent, it is the intense prose that grabs attention. Everyone is so vital in this book, even if they're \\"small\\", however, it is Lisbeth that enthralls. In absolute paradox she is as fragile as a poppy in a rainstorm but as fierce as a lion.<br /><br />This trilogy was submitted to be published shortly before Larsson succumbed to a fatal heart attack; what a literary talent and a heck of a mystery, don't miss this read!y're \\"small\\", however, it is Lisbeth that enthralls.

B001GZ6QEC|5|I can't believe the greatest superhero movie ever made only rates four stars as of this review on Amazon. This is primarily because of people who either love the film but dislike the DVD transfer, or find the film \\"overated\\".    Well friends, I'm here to tell you there's nothing overrated about THE DARK KNIGHT. It's not just the best superhero movie I've ever seen, but it's a truly great crime drama featuring gangsters, crooked cops and a murderous madman who calls himself The Joker!    THE DARK KNIGHT picks up where BATMAN BEGINS left off, with Batman and Detective Lt. James Gordon fighting the mob. They are joined by new District Attorney Harvey Dent, who relishes the opportunity to throw Gotham's new crime boss Sal Marone and his pals behind bars. The three are successful for a while. That is, until The Joker takes over.    And boy does he ever take over. He sends Gotham into chaos by challenging it's citizens into making dangerous, life and death decisions. And each major character in THE DARK KNIGHT faces their own difficult choices.     The Joker is an unpredictable sociopath who compares himself at one point to a dog chasing cars...but this dog's bite is even worse than his bark. And the late Heath Ledger truly is a revelation in the role. This isn't some actor merely having fun playing an over-the-top cartoon character. Ledger is unrecognizable in voice and appearance and his performance runs much deeper than your typical screen villain. He reminds me a of the great gangster villains from the past played by the likes of Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney, but much more twisted. In other words, the Joker I've always wanted to see.     Aaron Eckhart is perfect as the handsome, charming and earnest prosecuter Harvey Dent. His face born for campaign ads and his political future limitless. Yet there's more than one side to Dent, and Eckhart also brings that certain edge to Dent which lends just the right intensity. His may be the underrated performance in the film. His Dent not only has a story arc well known to fans of the comic, but he basically becomes the heart of the film. We find ourselves invested in his character, which makes this movie a tragedy as much as it is a thriller.    The rest of the main cast consists of mostly returning members: Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman are just as impressive as they were in BATMAN BEGINS. Much has been said of Bale's voice as Batman being too gravelly, but Bale has said he wanted Batman to be animalistic, which is good enough for me and besides, nobody would ever guess Batman is Bruce Wayne from the voice, that's for sure. Maggie Gyllenhaal steps in as Rachel Dawes and she comes across as a more mature version of the character than did Katie Holmes in BEGINS. She does a great job and, in at least one scene, breaks my heart.     THE DARK KNIGHT has plenty of action, with mercifully few CGI effects. And fight scenes you can actually see (especially on my Blu-ray). The music is rousing, tragic and scary...ideal for THIS film! The cinematography is both intense and breathtaking. The screenplay is clever, complex and almost novelistic, with dialogue that doesn't insult your intelligence. Speaking of which, just about every line from The Joker is a masterstroke. It's a multi-layered script with multi-layered characters...even though they originate from the pages of a comic book.     And this is definitely a multi-layered film thanks to Christopher Nolan's bold direction and his insistence on telling a good story. I thought his BATMAN BEGINS was excellent. This is brilliant. He pieced together a superhero story and turned it into a dark, disturbing, tragic, exciting masterpiece. It's one of those great Batman graphic novels come to cinematic life. Gloriously so!
B0051UP5NQ|3|This is great software, but recently the Google  Drive Remote file access is not working. This forces me to use a competitor's software. I did receive an e-mail quickly explaining that they were aware of the problem, but there is no fix as of yet. With this fixed, it's a 5 star program.
B003ZSJ212|1|I am very glad I haven't bought this box set, having seen them at a friend's I have to admit the production quality is much better than the very disappointing Special Edition DVDs but the change Lucas continues to make to a once beloved mythology, aside from destroying childhood memories also make the story telling worse. Please, please, please take Star Wars away from that meddling pillock.
B009JZSC9S|4|Love this show!  It's a perfect wind-down TV show for the weekdays. There is enough going on with the cast of characters to keep your interest, and the court battles address interesting aspects about current society and culture.

6305433909|1|This is dreadful. Sister Act was wonderful: original, funny, and heart-warming. Sister Act 2 is appalling in every way- the teenage characters are stereotypes, most of the jokes are bad cliches, and the storyline is like a fluffy, crappo version of Dangerous Minds. Worst of all, we don't get to see much of the characters we know and love from the first film- they are shunted to the background, and Whoopi Goldberg is expected to carry the whole feature- along with her idiotic, wooden, and unrealistic class of students of course. I also find Whoopi Goldberg's character's new preachiness unconvincing and hollow. In a nutshell? Thumbs down.
B0071PS7AC|5|Everything works great on my HTC Incredible running 2.3.4. If your bright enough to figure it out, you can either hit the menu button or the little arrow in the upper left hand corner of the screen to bring up the menu. From there you can choose a solo game or opponent, change your ball color &amp; weight &amp; it even has a help section that explains how to play the game.  It's basic. It's pretty fun. It's bowling. It also has pretty good graphics. Other than the fact that they could use the money won to buy new balls or something, it's a good game. Also there are no outlandish permissions &amp; it won't take up a lot of room on your device. Almost the perfect game.

B009NQKPUW|1|I love exploring other landscapes, other worlds, so I rented this movie. Ten seconds in to it, I realized that I had rented it before. I already paid for it again so I might as well watch, which I am doing while writing this review because the movie has nothing to sustain my interest. The more I watch, the more I remember how bad this movie is. It is full of cliches, not an original thought in the whole film. I am amazed that any actor in this film went on to better roles. I will be amazed if the directors ever make a better film. This is a new breed of film making, films so un-rememberable that you rent them twice.<br /><br />Below is a followup on my original review.<br /><br />My appologies to the Ridley Scott. He has directed movies that I consider to be the best of our time. I will never forget watcthing Alien in the theater. It remains the only movie that I could feel my heart pounding while watching. If I were a movie buff then I would definitely remember his name.<br /><br />When I saw Prometheus, I assumed Hollywood had thrown it together to capitalize on the SciFi market using a director merely capable in special effects. The dialog and concepts were so cliche that this movie borderlined on comedy. Maybe it was a serious attempt by Ridley Scott to explain the origins of Alien or maybe Mr. Scott simply loaned his name to the movie. Unfortunately, my original ill-informed comment about the directors going on to make a better movie might hold true. It must be nearly impossible for Ridley Scott to make better movies than he already has.
B00IDI8KLC|5|Excellent movie. It was. Great for kids and parents alike. It has a lot of adult cute humor with it too. Very few if any curse words. I would recommend this movie to anyone.
B0043ZDFEQ|4|Great
B00RUT3D5S|5|This may be the greatest studio double album ever recorded. Most double albums are a lofty challenge for any artist.<br />LZ pulls it off here. The new remastering is great and the cool booklet and jacket are neat too.<br />The bonus disk doesn't offer anything special. If you want the remastering and the other cool things mentioned, you can get this without the third bonus disk of alternate takes.
B001P5HI4A|5|Timeless!
B004MC8CA2|5|I love this bible app it is good if you are out a lot. You can read or it will read to you!
B002VPE1XY|4|The AmazonBasics case means what it says:  it is a well-fabricated, resilient basic case for your smaller digital cameras.  To be perfectly candid, we haven't quite found a digital camera that it fits perfectly; our oblong or asymmetrical Fujifilm FinePix XP10 and Canons can get in, but it is a challenge to get the flap snapped shut.  For this price you are getting a great carrying case, but just make sure you actually have a camera that matches it.
B000IFS0HM|5|This book is the memoir of a young boy who was born in the US during the Great Depression who moved back to Limerick with his parents and brothers at the age of 4. It's a story about starvation and death and loss. But, it's also a story full of humor and strong family ties and hope.    I admit it. I frequently eschew books that I perceive as being sad or brutal. This book was both, but I am sooo thankful I've finally read it. This book could easily have been emotionally exhausting to the point that people would have trouble finishing it. However, the author very skillfully gives the reader a bit of a cushion from the raw emotion of life in Limerick in the 30's and 40's by making the narrative voice a tough, laconic kid (his younger self.) Frankie talks about these terrible life events in a very matter-of-fact way. He just accepts these sorts of things as part of his life. He recounts it to us so firmly, it gives the reader the license to be sad without being overwhelmed by the horror of it. Being a champion book blubberer, I appreciated that.     This memoir was a Pullitzer Prize winner and it shows.
B006JPS1OM|5|great app. really makes you work at it. you definitely use your you must put on your thinking cap. good plot.

B00AA0TZTW|5|Another Gem from the Genius at Electric Lady Land studios. I love this album. It is like reconnecting with an old friend. Jimi has been with me since I was 16 years old and I am 60 now.Please I would love to see Jimi Live at Royal Albert Hall on DVD before I die, So Eddie please, I'm not getting any younger over hear.
B00005QDW5|5|Just to be clear: this is a great compilation. My quibble is that, though representative of Floyd's whole catalog -there are songs that should have or could have been included. Understanding that due to the limitations with CD's (this was released before MP3's), the band members probably had to make some hard choices. Regardless, this is still a good comp -maybe a little incomplete but overall well done. The only other quibble I have is that they connect the songs using sound effects and music so there is a continuous feel to the album. If you remember the musical intro to &#34;Comfortably Numb&#34; -there is now about a 30 odd second intro and so it goes with other songs. If you can deal with that, get this.
B00HERGNR6|5|It's a movie.  It's new.  It has Loki.  WOOHOO!<br />I only wish there were more outtakes but that isn't Amazon's fault.  It arrived quickly, perfectly, and I love it.<br />I also love the price guaranty.  A little bit was knocked off the price by release time.  I love Amazon for that.
B000SEGUDE|2|The story weaves back and forth through time, but the connections among the several stories are subtle and hard to follow--especially on Kindle when one cannot page back and forth easily to check. However, the worst part of the book for me was how fatalistic it is. Sigh.
0812550706|3|I read this book with high expectations, and honestly, I was underwhelmed.  It is so highly revered on so many sci-fi book lists and is a literary fan favorite, but I just don't see what the big fuss is about.  It is a good story, it's got a good pace and interesting characters, it even grapples with some heavy themes including war, childhood, xenophobia, propaganda and the loss of innocence, but I never once, while reading it, had the sense that this was a work on the level of other great works of fiction that I've read.  An enjoyable read, and I would recommend it, but it does not belong to a special class.
B00FKF0F3C|5|Fantastic finish for his triology. Ken Follett is one of the best authors and all his books are must read!
B006FE83UE|5|I liked the interview with Gregory Peck.  He was truly a gentleman.
B006O5XYWG|4|Decent, but not great.  Good audio and video quality.
B00G5G7EXY|4|I enjoyed this movie but it definitely doesn't live up to my expectations.  Since buying Pixar, Disney is kind of getting the idea again that if they make good movies, they will make more money.  Good for them.  In particular, Tangled is one of Disney's best movies in almost every respect.  Wonderful dialog, music, etc.  I was hoping (and people led me to believe) that this would follow in the same tradition.<br /><br />Unfortunately Frozen is dominated in every respect by Tangled.  But it's still an ok movie.  Instead of being a musical movie (plot that makes sense and several very memorable songs) it's much more like a broadway musical (plot that is garbage and lots of music woven in, none of which is really all that catchy).  The plot in this one is pretty thin and it would be easy to poke holes in it.  That's not the worst flaw in the world since it's pretty common in movies, especially those that intend to have children as a major part of the audience.<br /><br />My biggest beef with this movie is the characterization.  There isn't much.  You don't really empathize much with any of the characters and there isn't a ton of growth and development.  There's the handsome guy that turns out to be a bad guy, but he really isn't much of an antagonist and is only present in a few scenes.  Also he had no reason to be as bad as he was.  Really the only reason for his character to exist is that they needed some conflict so the one girl can show an unselfish loving act.  But there were other characters and situations that could have filled that role.  Instead I think Disney was just trying to teach the message that you shouldn't get married on a whim.  I guess it's not the worst message.  The &#34;main&#34; character who has the ice powers isn't that great a character.  She doesn't have that many redeeming qualities and besides learning to control her power she doesn't  grow much in the film.  The sled guy, this reindeer, and the snowman are all ok for comic relief, but they weren't developed very well either, I thought.  Pretty flat.<br /><br />People have made a big deal about the pro-homosexual undercurrent of the movie.  I think that mainly has to do with our political environment today, not the movie.  It's really subtle.  Mostly there's a strong sense in the movie that going off and doing your own thing regardless of whether it makes other people happy is the way to personal progress.  Not the best moral in the world, but it's passable (better than, say, Pocahontas, where the moral is that white men are evil but if they could just learn to be indians we would all be better off).  People have talked about this being a good sisterly love movie but it's actually pretty weak that way.  The sisters hardly know each other.  The one sister is always trying to be loyal but the ice sister is pretty much a jerk or a drama queen all the way through and never changes.  I wouldn't recommend it on those grounds.<br /><br />The music in this movie is what I would call passable.  If you liked the music in wicked, you will like this.  What you get is a few moments within songs that are great, but not whole songs that you will remember or find yourself singing later.  That was a big disappointment.  Simply put, the Andersen-Lopez team is no Alan Menken.  Not by a very long shot.  Nevertheless if you don't try and compare the music to the greater Disney works of the past, you will find that it is painless and even enjoyable.<br /><br />One major bone for me: the voice acting and singing of the ice princess.  Idina Menzel is famous for her role in Wicked and other things and the movie really wanted to capitalize on that, but her voice is clearly too old for the character she plays.  I find it difficult to watch movies where the character's voice clearly doesn't match her look and age.  I'm not the biggest Idina Menzel fan anyway, but if she had played a character that was 20 years older and more mature I wouldn't have had an issue with it.  On theother hand, Kristen Bell, who played the other sister, was brilliant at acting and singing.<br /><br />Overall I felt like the movie meandered.  It kind of seemed like it was heading to a coherent plot but then the big climax, which was a disappointing but also expected deux ex machina, comes and I sort of walked away feeling like it was an ok ride.<br /><br />I don't regret owning this.  If you haven't seen it already, go in with low expectations and you will end up happy.other hand, Kristen Bell, who played the other sister, was brilliant at acting and singing.<br /><br />Overall I felt like the movie meandered.

B000M3452Y|5|I think James Murphy has really tapped into the way it feels to be an aging hipster - which every hipster is. Being hip takes a lot of energy and every day you get less hip - just by getting a day older. His lyrics peer into this portal of social paranoia like J. Alfred Prufrock, obsessing \\"I grow old ... I grow old / I shall wear the bottoms of my trousers rolled. / Shall I part my hair behind? Do I dare to eat a peach? / I shall wear white flannel trousers, and walk upon the beach. But Murphy's beats herald that he is better than hip: He's at the top of his game.  <br /> <br />Hipness is constantly slipping from ones grasp - and for a lot of Gen-Xers they gave up the pursuit long ago to have a serious career or kids. Murphy never gave up to join \\"adulthood\\" - he lived in NYC for almost 20 years, gigging in every kind of band possible. He spent his 20s and 30s making music and trying to make it in the business, but failing. Many people would have taken a desk job and \\"gotten with reality,\\" but he was too hip for that, and it's paying off. Despite his recent success, he knows how it feels to be 35 and too cool to work 9-5, but disgusted by the trendy, silly vacuousness of 20-somethings. Many aging hipsters I know (myself not so much included) get bitter when they see the new crop of \\"hipsters,\\" and they go on and on and on about how much better it used to be: Sound of Silver's last track, \\"New York, I Love You But You're Bring Me Down\\" captures this sentiment perfectly. It is less bitter than LCD's first single, \\"Losing My Edge,\\" but Murphy is definitely bemoaning the loss of something hip and wonderful about New York that he now sees as gone. Or is it? Is it the aging hipster in him that is pointing fingers only because New York has changed and he hasn't? When he declares \\"Take me off your mailing list ,For kids that think it still exists,\\" he backs up the rub off by admitting \\"Maybe I'm wrong <br />/ And maybe you're right.\\" He is well aware of the fact that thoseyoung hipsters in Iowa or Portland or Birmingham, dreaming of idyllicly dirty NYC may still find what their looking for in the Big Apple - but maybe they won't. <br /> <br />Each song on the album has as much introspection - \\"New York, I Love You...\\" just happens to be the most lyrically well thought out and ballady. As a song, it's imperfect - Murphy just doesn't have a ballad-friendly voice (which is part of the appeal and irony of the song). I can imagine Weezer doing it real justice if they covered it. It is the anomaly on the album - the rest of the songs are all dancier. I think the rest of the songs are better, too, but if this song is the worst song on the album than I would say it's a near perfect album. <br /> <br />Definitely the best album as of April 5, 2007. If you have any taste whatsoever and are reading this stupid review, do yourself a favor and buy this album. Go see LCD live, while you're at it.

B00ABKGG0C|5|A great read! From start to finish I was hooked. My only disappointment came when I finished the book and found out the second book won't be coming out till Nov......
140525355X|5|My sons absolutely love this book series. I read it every night and they never get bored. I ordered this with the expectation it'll come 1month later from Germany but it arrived just before Christmas! Perfect. Thank you very much.
B005T87QCI|1|Who gives a crap about what characters are in the game? Everyone should be complaining about the crappy controls! I can see the buttons light up as if I'm pressing them but my bot does nothing. I don't care how fast you press the buttons you will never be able to put together combos like the AI. Thanks to all the fake 5 star reviews.
B00C1BV9Z6|5|Rented it for the 7 year old to watch and he loved it.
B0000YWKHC|1|This must be one of those films that people wasted their money watching and then wanting others to do the same. So they rated this boring movie high so others may want to see it and waste their money also. How sad. If people can really say they can identify with this movie, they must be really lonely and living a boring life. If wandering around a city looking out the window and looking bored is great acting, then this would be a great film.
044651652X|5|If you're a miserable cynic, you'll hate it. I am not a fiction reader. I am purely a lover of non-fiction. But a friend pleaded with me to read this book. When I finally broke down and picked up the book, I could not put it down. I finished it in about 5 hours. <br /> <br />People can say whatever they want about it being contrived romance, but this book puts you inside of what it feels like to be in a very intense romance that some (real) people really experience. I've been there, I know the anguish and intensity of the love this book describes. There really are people who love, speak and act this way.  <br /> <br />People who don't get this book are bitter and angry that they can not concieve of such intense loving and living. If you love to love, and love an incredible quick read, this book is for you.  <br /> <br />I wept for a good half hour when I finished this book despite myself. Enjoy! <br />-- A non-fiction loving, non-sap from New Jersey <br />

B00N6PCXME|3|&lt;b>The Buried Giant&lt;/b> by Kazuo Ishiguro<br />Pub 2015<br />3 Stars<br /><br />I was really excited about this book. Ishiguro hasn't released a new book in a number of years and this one has ties to Arthurian legend, so I was thinking it would be right up my alley. Unfortunately it just didn't work for me. On the surface, The Buried Giant tells the story of an elderly married couple who makes the decision to leave their home to find their son whom they've not seen in a number of years. However, it is clear from the beginning that there is more to it than that. A mist of forgetfulness lies over the whole land, preventing them and everyone else from accessing their memories, even of the recent past. As the story continues it morphs into something greater than just a trip to visit their son into a quest to dispel this fog and recover their lost past.<br /><br />This summary actually makes the book sound really intriguing, and it could have been. Yet it was lacking something. It felt like the same veil preventing Axl and Beatrice from their memories also prevented me from fully connecting with their story. The pacing of the story was quite slowe and even events that should have been exciting and instead made me feel tired and at times bored. As a result it took a long time to complete this book. If you are a fan of Ishiguro, I would recommend you read it, however for those who have not enjoyed his books in the past it is one I suggest you skip.
B00003CXBH|5|Bet I am one of the many film buffs who are awaiting the release of this fantastic film on DVD.<BR>The Mission is the Winner of the Palme D'Or and the Grand Prix De La Commission Superieure Technique at the Cannes Film Festival of 1986 (the year of its release). Its high time this movie is brought out on DVD.<BR>Guess this was one of the most gruelling roles Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons have ever played - climbing those cliffs and through the muck of the rain forests.<BR>Also a suggestion - IT WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA TO ALSO INCLUDE THE MUSIC TRACKS OF THIS FILM IN THE SPECIAL FEATURES SECTION OF THE DVD. Music Director Ennio Morricone would agree with me on this.<BR>Also since movie is based on a true story of the Guarani tribe, it would be enlightening if the special features could throw some light on the Gaurani tribe or the advent of the white man and Christianity in the rain forests of latin america.
B009EEOQIU|5|great version of cinderella!
B00A3NQNUU|5|Great game!! I am not a big fan of games on phones as they do not hold my attention and are constantly bothering you with notifications but this is a great game that you can play when you want and does not require a lot of attention.

B000SEIK2S|5|The best of the series, couldn't put it down!!
B00EMXBDMA|4|It appeared that the author researched everything about travel to and survival on Mars. Instead of writing a book outlining the hazards, he wove an engaging story that included what seemed like every possible disaster that could befall humans as they attempt to survive on Mars - along with possible solutions.
B009CPJHY4|5|Great
B007FEFLTO|5|I enjoyed Book One in spite of racing through it and feeling like it was a superficial read. He's just a great storyteller even if the characters were thin. But Book Two totally pulled me in. At first I thought it was going to simply be hard-core Nazi horrors, but the characters really came through against the backdrop of these frightening times.You know you've read a good book when you're genuinely sorry to reach the end...and I am. I guess my only complaint, and it's super minor, is that some of his assumptions about women--their sexuality and things like breast-feeding--seem to be written by...well, a man! For one thing, women don't immediately start producing milk upon a baby's delivery. He might as well get the details right. But this is a quibble. Can't wait for Book 3.
B00005QDW5|4|I was at first frustrated with the non-chronological order of the songs on ECHOES, in part because I just started my Pink Floyd collection.  BUT, this is indeed a Fascinating listen with the mixed up track order.  Hearing 'Keep Talking' fade into 'Sheep' is truly BREATHTAKING!  <BR>The song selection is flawed, but that might have been what the compilers wanted.  I don't remember 'Marooned' or 'Sorrow being big hits, BUT 'Marooned gives the first C.d. a nifty intermissionand Sorrow is a good closer for the first C.D.  The 'Pre-Dark side' material is well represented, except for 'Interstellar Overdrive,' but that can be overlooked.  Songs like 'Brain Damage,' 'Have a Cigar,' 'Run Like Hell,' and 'The Turning Away' SHOULDN&quot;T have been overlooked, though, and if you're just getting into Pink Floyd (like I am) you might be better served to start with 'Dark Side' and 'WYWH' and then move to this compilation.
078401213X|4|The two worst things you can do in a review are over-hype and give away the ending (especially for movies that build to the end) - here's looking at you 'The Aphasic Android' (other reviewers gave away the ending too). This movie is somewhat pretentious and suffers from some neo-classical art-house direction tricks; however these flaws fail to take much away from a truely intersting storyline. I guess this movie isn't for everyone - sort of the equivalent to listening to the Jesus and Mary Chain.
B000FC13Y0|4|My only complaint is that there are a lot of characters to keep track of and I had a hard time keeping the 'crones' straight.  Great story and imagery.
B00CTSDDVO|5|My family and friends liked it. The best price is available on this product on AMAZON.
B00BIVN82M|5|Its a wonderful album especially when wanting to relax and enjoy your day/evening.  Beautiful Voice and Beautiful Music to be heard.
B00DR0PDNE|5|Great tool, works wonderfully at streaming videos from my laptop to our TV. At times, the framerate can drop, but for the most part it works great! There is a delay between the laptop display and the projected image, so if you're using it as a live projector (for a presentation, for example), then you'll have to realize that there is about a 3 second delay.
B00IG2DOKM|5|An excellent limited-resources game.
B001Q9J4PG|4|Good premise although the timing is questionable. Clancey tells a good tale and Clark/Chavez are a good pair. Last job was a good one.
B00821OX98|4|It's good but it's been done before
B009UX2YAC|5|This is an amazing game but it is Mainly for older children between 7- whatever age but this game is very hard for younger people when my friends children that are 4 and 6 and found it really hard trying to figure it out
B00BHMETKC|4|I think this movie outlines how true clandestine operations work, not just james bond glitz and gadgets. Unquestioned loyalty, sacrifices, undaunted courage.  Movie has some laughs to counter the heaviness. It was a good flick to watch when you're feeling patriotic. Gives a me a new respect for out Northern brothers.

B000H305U0|5|I don't know about bringing it back, because I never lost it but this newest album is just good ol' prince pop. It will keep you dancing on the club floor and not feel guilty it's Justin T. Not every song is a hit, but there are plenty to groove to.
B00ESB75FA|5|I watched every episode except this last season on Netflix.  I was so hooked (I binge watched), that I HAD to buy the final season.  Worth every penny.  For ONCE a worthy ending to a series!!
B0050DIWFC|3|The father's insistence on his son's innocence seemed unrealistic, he acted in a way that made it seem like he still thought his boy was a little four year old. He used his legal background to make it  OK to interfere with the case, and much of the end was unclear.  Like &#34;Gone Girl,&#34; I was surprised at the popularity of the book -  I didn't enjoy reading this at all.

B001KVZ6F2|5|I ordered this movie and I received in two days later.  In excellent condition and the service was also excellent!!
B006CBSE86|4|Admittedly, Imaginaerum is not as good as Dark Passion Play, or even Once, but I really like a couple songs, Ghost River and Scaretale, even better than any on DPP. Both songs are different from anything Nightwish has done and are quite good. In addition the rest of the album is very listenable
B00005LK95|5|In the first \\"Short Circuit\\" film, Number Five was viewed as more of a prop than a character. While the story revolved around a robot coming to life, the story seemed to focus more on the reactions of the people it interacted with than the robot himself. In this film, Number Five (who has adopted the name \\"Johnny Five\\") is a main character. He is given more of a personality, a bigger sense of humor, but most importantly, he is given emotion. Johnny Five knows he is alive, but he struggles throughout the film trying to prove it to the rest of the world.<br />Humor is not the main goal in this film (although it does exist); the movie is more of a drama. You almost forget that the main character who gets depressed with the fact that no one will accept him is a robot.<br />While not as funny as the first one, what the film lacks in humor it makes up with feeling. You'll even cry as Johnny is confronted by a group of thugs (I won't spoil it for you). That's not to say that there aren't good jokes along the way (one in particular when Ben, who already struggles with English, is prompted by Johnny Five while attempting to woo a girl).<br />Another plus with this film is the presence of muliple plots. This gives the movie a faster pace than the original. Ben, J5's co-creator, is attempting to break into the toy business (with some help from con man Michael McKean); two thugs, using Ben's warehouse as a means of breaking into the vault across the street, are terrorizing the two would-be toy makers; and Ben is struggling to win the love of a girl who sees him as nothing more than just a toy maker. There is nothing to bog this film down, and in the end, all the plots come together nicely.<br />All in all, this is a GREAT movie!!!
B00475AYJQ|5|Love this series, it's fresh and enthralling with great characters.
B0094BB4TW|3|Too many non family adds which is too enticing for any audience.  Clean that up and I'll give it a 5 star.  I don't even use this product that much...if it wasn't for my wife setting this up for me I wouldn't even do it.  It's bad enough what the internet has done to our society and this supposedly family gathering site is really not what it claims to be.  Get it...Facebook not Sexbook.
B002MQYOFW|5|THIS WAS GREAT BOOK COULDN'T GET BETTER THAN THIS<br />HOPE THE SECOND IS TWICE AS GOOD. I LOVED IT SO MUCH!
B00024I2Z4|5|Based on a beloved Chinese legend, Mulan is a lovely, spirited, intelligent, outspoken, but less than graceful young girl growing up in ancient China. She has come of age, and it is time to be married off to a young man, but the village matchmaker does not believe it is possible. Speaking openly, even to men, and having poor serving skills, Mulan is simply not a proper young Chinese woman and will never bring her family honor. Her despair over dishonoring her family and her desire to freely embrace her true self must be cast aside, however, when the Emperor calls out for one male member of each Chinese family to join the army and help defend the land from the invading Huns. With her father too weak to last long in military service, Mulan is the only member of her family who is able to fight, but a woman joining the army is forbidden, and the penalty of deception is death! After she makes the dangerous decision to disguise herself as a man and fight in her father's place, Mulan's ancestors send a mighty dragon to bring her back before she causes her family further shame and embarrassment. But Mushu (Eddie Murphy), a much more miniscule dragon, takes his place and decides to help Mulan in her quest instead of bringing her home. In her guise as a male soldier, Mulan barely manages to keep her secret while training, marching, and fighting, but by the time her struggle is over, Mulan and those around her learn that she doesn't have to be a perfect bride or beauty to bring her family of honor.<br /><br />There's a lot of animosity towards the Disney animated features that have been released since \\"The Lion King.\\" Many have said that \\"The Lion King\\" was the last great film of the Disney Renaissance that supposedly started with \\"The Little Mermaid.\\" Not at all true. \\"Mulan\\" is a prime example. The story is powerful, emotional, and more real than anything Disney feature animation has tackled before, except maybe \\"Pocahontas.\\" The film envelopes you in ancient Chinese culture, the music is fantastic, and the characters are believable, endearing, and beautifully played by their respective voice talents. Eddie Murphy, of course, is the big name tagged to this feature, playing a role that he seemed to be reprising in Shrek (but he's much funnier here). Much of the rest of the cast list reads like a Who's Who of Asian-American actors, from Pat Morita to James Hong, with the beautiful Ming-Na Wen as Mulan herself. And, while there IS a clear villain, the ferociously looming and eventually realized threat of Shan Yu (Miguel Ferrer) and his army of Huns, the real conflict in this film is Mulan's struggle to discover herself and to prove her worth to her family, her people, and to herself.<br /><br />This 2-disc Special Edition does a nice job stepping things up from the previous Gold Collection release. Presented in anamorphic widescreen, Disc One features an informative audio commentary with directors and producer that gives you insight into the depths to which the filmmakers went to make \\"Mulan\\" culturally accurate. It also holds a Disneypedia Activity, a \\"Fun Facts\\" clip, and a nice collection of deleted scenes that include a cut song for Mushu. Disc One also has a collection of preview trailers for upcoming Disney releases, naturally, and a special \\"Mulan 2\\" sneak peak. There's also a \\"Music and More\\" section that provides us with 4 music videos. As expected, you get the 2 music videos from the previous release of Mulan: \\"Reflection,\\" in which the vocally stunning Christina Aguilera sings the lovely \\"be yourself\\" themed song while ironically dressed quite un-Christina-like, and \\"True to Your Heart,\\" where Nick Lachey leads \\"98 Degrees\\" through Chinatown as they stalk a hot girl and run into Stevie Wonder. Both make for some darn good tunes and interesting visuals. A 3rd video offering is the Mandarin version of \\"I'll Make a Man Out of You,\\" sung by Jackie Chan. This makes for interesting entertainment for us Chan fans. One wonders, though,ure, the music is fantastic, and the characters are believable, endearing, and beautifully played by their respective voice talents.

This makes for interesting entertainment for us Chan fans. One wonders, though, why Donnie Osmond didn't get a video for the American version. It's definitely one of the best moments in the film (though there are many great moments). And, the last video is, you guest it, Raven. This time, Raven sings \\"True To Your Heart\\" off the \\"Disneymania 2\\" CD. Now, I know we all get annoyed when Disney tries to pass a commercial off as legitimate art, but I have to admit that I think she sings pretty good. Problem is, why don't they make an effort to do a decent video? How many recording booth videos is Disney Channel going to make?  <br /> <br />Disc 2 of the \\"Mulan\\" 2-disc Special Edition carries over the \\"Music and More\\" section for one more video. This time, we get the Spanish version of \\"Reflection,\\" sung by an uncredited vocalist whom I am informed is named Lucero. It's pretty much the same thing as the Aguilera video, but in Spanish. Sadly, there is no big \\"Behind the Scenes\\" featurette on \\"Mulan,\\" which is too bad since I'm sure there was one made for the Disney Channel. They really should include those on their DVD releases. In fact, it seems that most of the \\"Backstage Disney\\" (as it is called) section extra features have been shot after the fact. We don't get to see the sort of footage we used to see in behind the scenes Disney stuff, with animators hard at work and voice actors in the recording studio. In fact, the voice cast is tragically absent from this set. Now that is a true shame. Not so much as an interview. However, there is still plenty to see and do, plus, many sections thankfully include the good ol' \\"Play All\\" button. We are offered first a section called \\"The Journey Begins,\\" which includes a look into a trip to China that the filmmakers took for inspiration and preparation, a wonderful recitation (set to artwork) of the poem the film used as a basis, and two early presentation reels. Second is the \\"Story Artists' Journey,\\" which holds a featurette of filmmakers reflecting back on the film along with storyboard to screen comparisons. Next is a favorite of mine, the \\"Design\\" section, where we get to see all those neat art galleries. I love to see all the cute artwork of Disney girls evolving into their final forms. *drool* This section also houses three featurettes on art design, character design, and color. Good stuff! The \\"Production\\" section offers progressive demonstrations, a featurette on \\"The Hun Charge\\" computer effects, and a featurette on crowd computer effects. The \\"Music\\" section simply holds a brief featurette that could have been longer, but as it is, makes point to mention one of Mulan's best attributes, only using songs that fit story purposes. The final bit of extras are in a section called \\"International Mulan.\\" There's a featurette on translating the film for the world audience, a multi-language reel, and a publicity art gallery.  <br /> <br />There are only two major blemishes to this lovely 2-disc DVD release. One is the aforementioned lack of voice cast presence among the extras. The other is the fact that there are no theatrical trailers for the film itself to be found. Even the previous Gold Collection release had a trailer. Other than that, this is an excellent release of a beautiful and touching new Disney Classic that should be in everyone's DVD library, particularly recommended for those sick of Princesses and looking for a very different type of \\"Disney Girl.\\" Myself, I'll take Mulan and the princesses too, ha! <br />
6304383177|5|The best of the screwball comedies.  Katharine Hepburn is gorgeous, the epitome of the beautiful young woman high on life and its possibilities.  Cary Grant is handsome even with his glasses on and just the perfect match for Kate as the too serious young man who starts to live when he meets her.  Wonderful supporting cast and funny dialogue that keeps you on your toes.  This movie makes you laugh out loud and feel very good after you've spent two hours with Baby and friends.
B0089LOG02|3|Nice read, not a hard book to read and not a long book.  A bit thought provoking that makes you appreciate your own upbringing.  I felt the end came a bit early in the journey, I felt there was more to tell.  But still worth reading.
B00E8KLWB4|3|Great hidden object game.  I play these all the time and its fun and enjoy this hidden object game a lot.  I recommend it to all ages.
B001P06GX4|5|Even my 6 yo daughter can understand how to play this game - makes you think ahead several moves and form strategies to block other players from putting down their pieces on the board. Highly recommend 6 years and up!
B003ZHQVJO|5|Excellent CD,excellent quality,excellent music,all tracks were great!! I highly recommend to everyone!! I thoroughly enjoy it and so will you.
B00F8GYC1Y|1|First why is this free app the FAOTD this app is free all the time. Id never get anything Angry Birds after seeing the Cart Racing app. That app showed us how greedy Rovio really is with the $50 cart upgrade. Thx Amazon for skipping out on a free app today.
B000YKFJ66|5|EXCELLENT MOVIE KEEPS YOU GUESSING
B008K6HN8I|5|Got it for my Kindle Fire 2nd Gen.  First file manager app, chose it because originally I wanted something to copy files from my PC to the Kindle over WiFi.  This does that by allowing the tablet/phone access shared folders over the LAN, just scan and it comes up.  Additionally whenever I needed something to find and manage files (videos, .apk files...) 'under the hood' of the Amazon interface I open this up.  Other things I've used it for is installing .apk's and backing up apps.  I'm sure I've only touched the surface of what this app can do!
B00011CZQU|5|I got this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend so I have not had a chance to look at it yet but it came promptly and I am sure it will be just as pictured.
B00IG2DOKM|1|This was a great game until it stopped connecting to the internet yesterday. I am on level 42, so I don't want to have to reinstall it and lose my progress, but it won't open without connecting to the internet.
B003XF1XOQ|4|The author almost exclusively uses first-person, stream of consciousness, present tense mode. She does a good job of creating a sense of urgency, however it becomes tiresome and somewhat anti-climatic as the same urgency is carried throughout the entire series. The story is compelling though and somehow manages to get you emotionally involved even though the supporting cast of characters seem somewhat underdeveloped and the main character, explained partially due to her purported age, shallow.<br /><br />Obviously aimed at younger readers, the vocabulary is simple and easy to read even at a quick pace. The subject matter however may be more difficult for the target audience to grasp, and even harder for them to develop the intended emotional response given the violence saturated state of contemporary entertainment.
B00BUCXVPI|5|Really enjoyed this thriller!
B000AADYRQ|5|I love this album just as i loved transatlanticism. by far my favorite band ever. favorite tracks: marching bands of manhattan, soul meets body, what sarah said. if youve been thinking about checking out death cab, do it. theyre awesome!
B003O86FMW|2|A teen/pre-teen soap opera. The first book was an interesting mix of future fiction and survival drama. I lost interest in the second at the lengthy description of makeup.
B0058YPL66|5|love it got it for my daughter for Christmas  she was so happy to get it  !!! well get season two when it comes out
0553582453|5|great reading!
B003L77GH4|5|If you're a fan of the show or like vampires pick up a copy.  Looking for a show in between something like TrueBlood & Twilight check this one out, won't disappoint.  Best thing about this show it's on basic tv so it's free to watch.
B009EAO38C|5|I don't have much to say... This CD is simply awesome!!!!! I can't stop listening to it! I'm glad I bought it! Check their channel on youtube... I'm sure you'll order the CD after that!
B001JI72AI|5|Great
B007BVOEPI|5|I'm on a tight budget so I have only watched four episodes of the series, plus the free mini-documentaries. I just finished reading the first five books, so I found it interesting to see the characters. The series was very well cast, but I especially liked Joffrey and Tyrion. I am planning on buying two episodes per month, so I will eventually get through it. I'm an American. Why must I endure delayed gratification?
B0044C5SCU|5|Overall, I enjoyed the series.  I actually made it in to a marathon of sorts.  There were a few dull shows but I enjoyed the series, all five seasons.
B00005JMEW|3|'Kill Bill' is a difficult film to review.  It has many elements simply copied from other, older genres (martial arts films, westerns), has music from 60's/70's TV shows, and buckets of surrealistic blood (gushing like fountains from amputated limbs/heads).  Inject Tarentino's bizarre sense of humor, and you have one oddball of a movie!<br />Tarentino's penchant for time frame manipulation (ala Pulp Fiction) can make things a little confusing for those not familiar with his approach, but it all comes together if one has patience.  His cinematography is simply superb, especially in the fight sequences, which are the real stars of the film.  The final battle in the Japanese bar is awesome, in spite of the extreme gore.  Tarentino has a way of making dismemberment a humorous event: witness the Lucy Liu 'Yakuza' meeting.<br />I'm not sure I like Tarentino's flippancy toward bloodletting-it's all a sort of cartoon to him.  When one thinks about the real blood being shed in Iraq and Afghanistan (which the US government goes to great lengths to PREVENT the American public from seeing), this stuff feels awfully petty.  Nevertheless, Quentin makes it all seem like no big deal, and creates a near-poetic way to present it to us.  Think about it: if you saw this amount of human devastation on CNN, how would you react?  We snicker because we know it's Tarentino, and 'It's Just a Movie'...
B00EPH8SBM|5|Good movie about how thinking outside the box can rejuvenate a business and make it successful no matter your race or orientation.
B00JH3S0AI|3|Wild show!! 😀😀
0792833279|5|one of the best
B00BD99JMW|3|Why did she have to kill Tris?! It seriously made me cry! It was so sad! I am so mad at her! Otherwise it was good.
B00A9ET4MC|5|Funny, honest, portrayal of &#34;blackness&#34; and race relations in America AND a compelling romance. I could not put it down, and will read everything she writes.
B00000G3CK|5|The film a new word in cinematography.  Absolutely wonderful filming techniques in combination with off-this-earth soundtrack create an unforgettable show.  The ending is slightly banal for such a film (and this  is the only downside)
B00E8KLWB4|4|Like the game, is different from Farmland and Frontier village but still has some similarities. Like the idea of a mystery.
067101756X|5|In my opinion, very informative.  I think his evidence supports modern advances that I think would've not been possible with normal technological advances of the time.
B00E8KLWB4|4|Addictive game for hidden picture fans.
B00004XOWN|5|LB is at their best with this album. I've got two (this one and Three dollar bill) and CSFAHDFW is by far the best. Skip Brittney Spears, N'Sync,DMX,Kid Rock, and PaPa Roach. Fred Durst is God.<br />P.S. Buy the edited version (my dad made me)
B00E8KLWB4|4|Fun little puzzles in a good variety without having to spend any cash. Good deal! Will continue to play this and look for other games by this company.
B008KP2VZY|5|I recently put a phone through the wash and realized there was no way to get any of my data off of it because there is no separate SD card. For my new phone I looked for a way to automatically back up some info, specifically my car gas mileage tracking data. This works great. My mileage program automatically creates a backup of the data every week and then after a relatively easy setup Foldersync uploads it to Dropbox (also works with Google drive and many other cloud storage services) without me having to do anything.
B005721W9O|4|This is a fun movie that spoofs previous SciFi TV shows - I had this movie on VCR, now I have it on DVD.  Also, having Tony Shalhoub is great (I miss seeing him each week on Monk).
B00000K19E|1|Another bad movie by Keanu Reeves.  I've been told that if I didn't like this movie it meant that I didn't get it.  Oh, I got it...bang, bang, shoot 'em up cheese fest.  The plot was thin, the violence was overdone, and the  effects were well the only salvagable part of the movie.  <br />Laurence  Fishburne is too good of an actor to have made such a mistake.  Even his  talent couldn't save this film.<br />I like sci-fi, I like dark, this movie  was simply trite.
B00H3GZMIE|5|Fantastic CD, its worth all the attention it received.... Best New Artist 2014
B009CPIR9K|1|How did these actors get through all of these scenes without busting up. Really, the story is so much in need.
B0064X7FVE|4|I like that I can get the weather real fast. I would like to get my town's weather but can't. I get the next town over. But it's still close enough.
B005NFJAT4|5|Best movie ever, A+.
B00005YXZH|5|I have been a fan of Wilco since their inception (prior to that I was a huge Uncle Tupelo fan).  When Wilco released their first album AM, I thought, there were some decent tracks but that it lacked a bit in the way of substance.  Their follow-up &quot;Being There&quot; was an absolute surprise, and really close to a masterpiece.  It was then I began to tune into Tweedy's genius and I was better able to appreciate his songs from the Tupelo days.  It was evident then that Tweedy was maturing as a song writer.  <BR>The album Yankee Hotel Foxtrot exhibits Jeff's willingness to push himself and his music, and more exciting was the fact that Wilco's original record label felt the album was not commerical enough, so the band bought the rights to the album and shopped it around looking for another label.  <BR>I have been listening to the album for a few months, and it is nothing like what Wilco has released before.  Tracks like &quot;I am trying to break your heart&quot;, &quot;Kamera&quot; and &quot;Radio Cure&quot; provide a nice cross-section of what you can expect.  &quot;Radio Cure&quot; is moody and dark and yet the chorus contains elements of hope.  Seeing it live put that track into a completely different light.  &quot;Kamera&quot; sounds a bit like pop, but the lyrics are deep.  <BR>All in all, Tweedy's song writing has never been better, he continues to put himself out there, but he is not as straight forward as he used to be, I find myself needing to dig a little deeper into the metaphors and similies. Ultimately, I think people will find that he still refuses to censor himself.
B00AREIAI8|5|my 8 year old daughter love this game - i have seeing her playing and I like it as well - love the fact you can take pictures of the horses and safe them - very nice
0345803485|5|A friend told me about the book I myself don't read so I was not to sure but ended up reading all three books in a week and loved them. Thanks to my friend I could not put the book down while on vacation by the pool I bet 50 people were reading the same book it's crazy but interesting!!!
1442426705|5|I'm not a huge fan of romances, but I really enjoyed this book.  It sounds like one of the main tropes of many romance stories, but it is written in a very clear voice of someone of that age.  Better yet, the story (for the most part) reminds me of confusion -- when every mistake you make seems earth shattering.<br /><br />The ending came very abrupt for me without resolution.  It turns out that is because there is a sequel.  The sequel is well written, but is not as good as this one.
014242417X|5|It's unfortunate that someone told me the ending beforehand. I must have issues because I still decided to read it anyway. I'm glad I did and I think a part of me is happy that I could slightly prepare myself. Slightly, it was still hard to read. I don't think I've ever laughed or cried so hard in one book. It was beautifully written, combined with a touching story that I could not put down.
B000HCO83Q|4|There may currently be a calm, but there is a storm coming.  The conflict between human and mutant is about to heat up.  The spark that will set things off is a new mutant who cancels other mutants.  He has been used to develop a cure to being a mutant.  It is being offered in a voluntary fashion but there are those who believe it will be forced on mutants and Magneto is their leader.  As an added spark, Jean Grey has been found alive. <br /> <br />The cure may be offered to volunteers but authorities have developed cure weapons to use against mutants.  The spark has been put to the tinder.  Magneto's Brotherhood wants to rise and eliminate the so-called cure so that it may not be used against unwilling mutants.  Jean Grey has risen as the most powerful of all mutants and she is on Magneto's side.  It is now time for he X-Men to take a stand and defend freedom, liberty, and the cause of mutants. <br /> <br />This is an interesting film.  Not only do characters die, but we see new sides to old ones.  Xavier reveals his dark side while Magneto shows his good side.  Jean rises as a force of pure fury.  New mutants become part of the story, some more so than others.  In the end we have the feeling of a trilogy ended but there are also new beginnings and plenty of possibilities for more movies.  Check it out.
B0013527I4|5|I've been waiting for this volume to come out. Some of my favorite episodes of the muppet show I havent seen in a long time are on this volume and I was so happy to see them restored and uncut on DVD!
B000001FLA|4|In the 1980's Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen was a guitar revolutionary with is neo-classical guitar playing and popularized the art of \\"shredding\\". I'm not Malmsteen's biggest fan and he was not the first guitarist who was influenced by classical music (Ritchie Blackmore was there before him) but I'll give him credit for his playing and his influences on some of the Power/Symphonic Metal bands. While his first solo album Rising Force showed his talents as a guitarist and featured a heavy dose of instrumentals his third album, 1986's Trilogy sees Yngwie going towards a more commercial direction and tends to sound more pop and radio friendly like much of the Glam bands of that era. Yet Yngwie still shreds, produces amazing solos and excellent guitars in general. This album marks another change for Yngwie as singer Mark Boals replaces departed singer Jeff Scott Sotto. Malmsteen would collaborate with many singers (Joe Lynn Turner, Doogie White, Tim \\"Ripper\\" Owens just to name a few) and everyone has their favorite but it's fair to say that Mark Boals had a good voice and was a competent singer.<br /><br />\\"You Don't Remember\\" opens the album with crunchy guitars and accompanying keyboards in the background. This song indicates a more radio friendly sound but is still a hard rocking song, even though it hints at commercialism it's still a good catchy song. \\"Liar\\" is much more aggressive and is more guitar oriented, a heavier track and one of the best on Trilogy. \\"Queen In Love\\" has been described as \\"cheesy\\" by other reviewers but I think it's a good 80's pop-flavored song that's undeniably catchy. What can I say?  I do enjoy some cheese now and then.  \\"Crying\\" to me is a personal highlight of Trilogy. It's really as if Yngwie is crying through his guitar, its powerful instrumental music. Yngwie shows his classical guitar skills and also demonstrates that he's not all about speed. \\"Fury\\" is one of the heavier tracks on Trilogy and it is also one of the songs on which Boals is most effective. \\"Fire\\" is suffers from having a bad, cheesy chorus that brings the song down when it had potential. \\"Dark Ages\\" is a good slow, heavy song with interesting lyrics and story. \\"Magic Mirror\\" sees Mark Boals going for the high notes  but it doesn't really go anywhere unfortunately. Album closer \\"Trilogy Suit Op: 5\\" is very much the equivalent classical music on guitar, it sounds incredible and it shows just how much of a virtuoso Malmsteen is. It's not surprising considering Malmsteen's love of classical music. This one is epic; it has many time changes and it's the Yngwie show. Of course he's backed up by solid music. This is for those who are into displays of over the top soloing and represents Malmsteen doing what he does best, those who aren't will find little of interest in this song.<br /><br />Overall Trilogy is not Yngwie Malmsteen's best or even his most popular album and while it goes in more of a commercial direction than his two previous effort Rising Star (1984) and Marching Out (1985). Yngwie is still true to himself and on Trilogy he's still an impressive guitarist. The songs are more mainstream and there were some radio tracks such as \\"You Don't Remember\\" and \\"Queen In Love\\" but he remains true to himself. I have a soft spot for Trilogy because while it's not my favorite Yngwie Malmsteen record it was my first. I remember thinking the cover with Yngwie fighting a dragon was a cool image.  Trilogy features some excellent guitar work, good new singer and a mix of catchy/heavy/instrumental songs. 3.5 stars/5.s most effective. \\"Fire\\" is suffers from having a bad, cheesy chorus that brings the song down when it had potential. \\"Dark Ages\\" is a good slow, heavy song with interesting lyrics and story. \\"Magic Mirror\\" sees Mark Boals going for the high notes  but it doesn't really go anywhere unfortunately.

B00J2PEZAU|5|This movie was everything I had hoped and dreamed it would be. So. many. wigs. Christian Bale at his fattest....I mean, finest.
B004G600A4|5|Teenagers will watch this. Love the Horse!
B00BBI9WD6|4|This book has one of my all time favourite 'girl power' moments. Honor Harrington is definitely not someone to be messed with.
B005K17RU0|4|It tells the weather which is what it's supposed to do.  I like that it can store a bunch of cities that I can easily flip through, I have some relatives hometowns in there and some dream destinations as well.  Let's see in San Diego right now its sunny and 72 :-)
B00005ATQ9|5|This great film has been marvelously restored and transferred to DVD, it's the best of the recent transfers from warner of Kubrick films, the wordt being The Shining, even that wasn't too bad but suffered from some artifacing problems.  not Barry Lyndon though the Transfer is Flawless :)
B000JO9JHW|5|Never wanted to see it and then we got rid of the channel. A friend told me to watch it and I caught like 10 minutes of the newest season premier and I just fell in love with Dexter

B009329ZF2|3|Not even close to the game. There is no way to touch on what the game was about so not to offend anyone or any country. But as far as the plot goes, and acting, special effects it was a very enjoyable action packed movie.<br />I'm looking forward to a sequel. It should be as enjoyable.
B005ZOBNOI|5|Amazing just amazing! Possibly the best book I have ever read in my whole entire life. I'm so amazed and in love!
B006LSZECO|4|A psychological drama, battle of wits, but fairly predictable.  From all the buzz, I expected more.  Helps to keep Ben Affleck in mind as you read.
B0009A40ES|4|The story of Patrick Bateman, the serial killer of Bret Easton Ellis 1991 novel, seen through the eyes of a woman director. Would this have been the same movie if it was done by a man? It probably wouldn't. And that's a good thing.<br /><br />There's black comedy, satire and gore in equal proportions. The way violence is shown to - or kept from - the viewer reminded me of \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" in the way that the camera slightly deviates from the target forcing us to imagine exactly what's happening right there. Andrezj Sekula cinematography struck me as particularly good as it perfectly resembles that 80s look and feel in a picture that's been released in 2000.<br /><br />And then there's a brilliant performance by Christian Bale, one of the best serial killer impersonations I've ever seen and Bale's best acting ever if it wasn't for stuff like \\"The Machinist\\" which would come later in his career. What's really difficult about doing a serial killer role is not exactly the killings but rather, and very much so in this case, the downward spiral of their mind. Bateman is a victim of the mid to late 80s lust in America, Wall Street in particular, like all of his colleagues. He's just gone a little bit overboard (this is obviously an understatement but you get my point). His insanity is in fact a by product of his lifestyle. There's this scene where Bateman, in a state of complete despair, admits all his crimes to his lawyer over the phone which is utterly brilliant and Bale nails it.<br /><br />The final stages of the film are kind of open, lending themselves to different interpretations and personally I prefer having to rethink the whole film under a different light after I've seen it.
B006LSZECO|5|A roller coaster of a book...starts slowly, picks up speed and then sends you reeling with twists and turns!!  Great whodunit!!
B002BE7JEI|3|Misery is an engaging story but drags during the middle of the movie.  Kathy Bates is excellent and James Caan is credible as the helpless victim.  There are some twists and turns that keep the plot interesting enough but it is rather dry in the scenes where Kathy Bates is absent.
B000003C2S|5|Chuck and co. have always put out highly involving albums, and this gem is no exception. Featuring the recording debut of metal superstar James Murphy on backup Rythym and Lead guitars. This features some dirty riffs. My  favorite is Low Life. Chuck Schuldiner was the guy who gave Death Metal its  name (from his Mantas demo called Death by Metal in 1983) and he is thusly  the furthest along within the scene in writing heavy, technical, and, yes,  catchy riffs. Hail the King, for his name is Chuck! I hope he fully  recovers from his recent surgery to remove a cancerous brain tumor. Our  thoughts are with ya Chuck!
B00BMR5HOO|5|I have tried so many weather apps on my kindle fire. I had nor found one I liked. I even paid for one thinking it would be what I was looking for. It was so complicated I took off Kindle. Then I seen this one I down loaded app. EXACTLEY what I was looking for.
B00000I9MK|5|If Belle and Sebastian were just serving up a 90's style of angst a la Morrissey etal, then this would be a good album but not great. But B &amp; S turn angst on its head and uncover the real heart of pop-optimism over cynicism, hopefulness over pessimism, life over death, basically. If you take &quot;I Don't Love Anyone&quot; at all seriously, you're entirely missing the point.
6305718954|4|I feel compelled to write this because after reading many of these reviews I am forced to ask the question &quot;how many of you so-called critics actually watched Stigmata?&quot;<br />I love this movie but I'm also realistic enough to admit its faults. The acting is great, I enjoy Gabriel Byrne and his understated performance, he did well with a script that is cumbersome at times.  The film is beautifully shot, and the techniques used give it a surreal quality, while the editing definitely could have been better (I kinda liked the deleted scene of Alameida's suicide).<BR>But to address some of the more foolish statements made...yes, some of the explanation process within the movie is a little simplistic but I hate to be the one to break this to you-not everyone is Catholic, not everyone went to catechism, I didn't but I was able to follow some of the dogma that is the foundation for the Catholic church.  When Frankie attempts to seduce Kiernan, it is because she is a) being influenced by Alameida, a devoutly religious man who suffered the stigmata and b) as it is explained, stigmatics suffer from demonic attacks and temptation because of their belief and faith.  Okay? <BR>I won't defend every aspect of the movie, because although I really like this movie, no movie is ever perfect and up to everyone's standards.  I think sometimes &quot;critics&quot; take things too seriously, look for every little mistake and if you're busy doing that then how can you possibly be watching (or 'gasp'actually enjoying) the movie?
B00FAX6XQC|4|Best hunter game I've found yet. I played it every day for over a year before it crashed. Now their tech support has left me hanging. What can I expect for the price of &#34;free?&#34; Speaking of, avoid spending real money on the gold credits by doing only the free credits activities and then only the ones you would use anyway. That way you don't feel so used if the app dies.
B006MW3UZW|5|This show kept me on the edge of my seat this season!  The costumes are great and the actors do a super job.  I really enjoy this show.
0062114042|5|The greatest front man in history....speaks up honestly and openly. I believe this is probably the best of any of the band member books to date. This is Really. the first Time any band member has descussed the thought process behind the Music of KISS. ...Paul also opens up about his own successes, failures, and fears....Really an eye opener.  Just a Great book.
B0058W74UY|1|It won't let me update the flash, it won't let me play videos on Facebook, it's pretty much a waste of a download.
B007IXWKUK|2|The sex scenes aren't that hot, started skipping them halfway through the second book. They're for submissives and younger gals. I do enjoy the storyline though.
B0061S0A64|2|I became bored with this app very quickly and uninstalled it.  A very cool concept, but did not keep me interested.
B007IXWL2C|4|There has been so much hype about the Fifty Shades Trilogy that I finally decided to try it out myself. I really didn't care for the price but I understand the reasons why!<br /><br />Now this story borders on the BDSM which makes people gasp but overall I found the Ana and Christian's story to be very enlightening.  Typically when we meet someone so messed up mentally we stay away and ward others that it isn't worth the time or effort to build a relationship. Ana thought differently and as the story continues in three parts I congratulate her on her willingness to fight for the man she loves.<br /><br />The conversations between Ana and Christian were funny and sad during their many email exchanges.<br /><br />Christian's was so afraid of anyone getting close to him that he became an ultimate control freak. The best part is that he knew something was wrong with him and sought out counseling.<br /><br />On the flip side of the story I felt Ana was too young to be in a relationship that serious but then again if she were older and had more experience she would have never worked on a relationship with Mr. Grey.<br /><br />I liked that this series is making people think and have discussion regardless if they liked it or not. All books should be written well enough to make you want to engage in dialogue with others giving your opinion.
B00C7TAF3Y|5|Incredibly creative and imaginative. Makes you think outside of the box while trying to get inside the box. Love it.
B00HYTT7BI|5|riveting...made my MSP - PHX flight enjoyable, despite the &#34;egg crate&#34; accommodations in &#34;steerage:...yaba daba do....now is the time for all good men to come to the.....
B0058VW36U|4|this game is a great game for children to play and it is very.addicting to play.....enjoy the game it is very awesome
B003F5NSTW|5|First I saw the movie. And I thought: \\"There must me more to it that I see here.\\" It was like I saw only fragments of what was really going on. So I was happy that there was a book where the movie was based on. And I read it almost without breathing. I think it is so wel written. The struggle with bringing up Kevin for the mother, the despair, never knowing what is right, what to do. And Kevin showing a whole other side to his father. The accidents that happen. I will not say too much because you really have to read it yourself. The devastating end. And the questions and mess and chaos his mother has to deal with after this. And after that I've watched the movie again. This time I could fill in the gaps. The book will always be dear to me.
B0089LOG02|1|Was my  book club selection.  Everyone loved it!
B007TBZ63Y|5|I think is an amazing book twist left and to always keep me guessing. I can't wait till house of Hades comes out.
B0082SU98U|5|Now this is a cute story.  Teenage girls would love it.  I'm no teenager and I loved it.  It's back to some wholesome reading which is rare these days.  Wonderful uplifting story about how a simple girl can melt the heart of even a hardcore mean person.
