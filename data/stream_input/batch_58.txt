B00167TYLM|5|Works great!
B00GM4WKJM|5|All I needed it to be and then some, this was the perfect fit for my Town & Country.
B009TA83CO|5|These are a very good fit for my Infiniti G37x.  The factory carpeted mat was starting to show some wear under my heel and these really really improved the appearance while providing some much needed coverage to keep dirt, mud, and sand from getting to the factory carpet underneath.
B000BUQODG|5|Quality product, and far cheaper than the maxx air brand units. I like that they also have a nice screen built in to the vents to prevent bugs and crud getting in.<br /><br />Install took about 10 minutes per vent (I did 3). Only took a drill, wrench and ratchet/socket. Instructions were straight forward. Hard to mess up how simple these are to put in.<br /><br />Update: 3 years later, they are still bright white, not cracked or warped at all. Other than the labels peeling off, they still look new!
B00E5P180M|5|Couldn't be more happy good price cut to fit but does a neck of a job
B00F56YCN0|5|Great product at a great price.
B00Y5N65R0|1|Do not bother with this product!  Poorly packaged for shipment, rolled in some cardboard, accessories taped to its side and then stuffed into a plastic mailer bag.  It is supplied without installation instructions.  The product description mentions a breather valve, there is no such valve.  Since were no installation instruction I had no idea what to do with the small filter assembly, it clearly cannot attach to the can itself.  Lastly and most importantly both ports terminate that the top of the can (same height) and the can is completely empty.  So airborne oil particles will simply flow in and then right back out, there is no baffling or other means inside the can to help precipitate the oil out of the incoming air stream.
B0078U814M|5|Perfect fit on my 1995 jeep grand cherokee limited!
B0010DLHDA|4|Doing ok but needs to prove itself with the test of time
B00LNLKSXE|3|Read the fine print this is not the COMPLETE bolt kit. Other than not being complete the screws work as intended although the blown diagram or &#34;instructions&#34; of where screws go is probably as vague as you can get.
B004RCSRXO|5|I looked at 4 different parts houses where I live, an ended up buying and returning it.  This was the perfect match and a better price.
B008MPMO3G|3|Pros & cons; First I never got the fog lights in my package. Second there were a few of the small LED lights that did not work.<br />The one and only thing that I like about the New halo headlights is that it makes my truck look newer.
B005NELVOM|5|very good and fast service would order again
B006P883DM|5|Simply awesome and on time!
B000BPZ824|4|I seem to have to run the mix a little leaner with this but I suppose that's a good thing. The smoke from it if it's too rich will make everything taste funny if your catching wiffs of it while trolling in the boat. Don't recall ever having that issue before. But once I went to 65:1 instead of 50:1 it's seems to be a non issue and runs right. A few tanks run through now without issue now.
B000CPCBF0|5|I changed the rear differential fluid using this in my Tacoma at 7K miles (2.5 years) and the factory lube came out very dark and the drain plug with the magnet was heavily coated with fine particles. I just changed it again at 40K miles (9.5 years) and the fluid came out clear and the magnet had a very small buildup of particles. I used Red Line gear oils in my last truck for 10 years and now in my current truck for 9.5 years. Neither has experienced any drive train issues.
B00F4MQJ5O|1|I am not happy with this product, I received the light with no end mounts or bolts to mount them. I've made several attempts to receive them, but no luck. I have not installed it yet. If I don't get the mounting brackets & bolts I am tempted to return it.
B007H2RR78|5|Fits perfectly. No leaks
B009WWSIO2|1|These gaskets are too hard! They don't seal! Never again! OEM or Hondata FTW!
B004ETCSL2|5|These are nice. I can move them around wherever I need them no problems with the batteries, they are doing exactly what I purchased them for. Well made. I am totally satisfied
B00SHTJ5D4|5|We use these numbers for HPDE (high performance driver education).  Our events run in all weather, and speeds can exceed 150 MPH in some cars.  These numbers are highly visible, they stick on well during the event, and they easily peel off after the event.  Great product.
B00KTHXN1M|4|Simple to program if you follow directions
B004C5CL1U|5|Great dress up for my truck wheels . I got two sets and one set for my Brand new Camero convertable , yeah .
B007489QYM|5|worked great, quick delivery
B00MQ334CA|5|Cart runs much better. Starts up better as well/
B00CR6NJNU|5|Perfect!
B00LLNWT36|4|Fit perfectly, though not 5-star quality.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Works perfectly!
B003ZWHMGU|5|Good product!!
B00LV3M1A2|3|A few of the lugnuts were not machined correctly. They did not screw on easily. When I had a tire shop change my tires, they had to go out and find the same style to replace the bad lugnuts. 36 out of 40 were good.
B00F5827DK|5|These work very well. I was using chunks of wood for my truck camper leveling feet. The wood worked just a good but as they became wet and sat on the ground  they would get a bit slimy and dirty. Plus the wood took up more space. These are a perfect  size and fit nice and neat in a smaller storage area.
B00HHR1UVM|5|Wired them up to my headlights on when I turn the headlights on the Kaman they've held up through car washes storms so far everything I'm very impressed for the price and the quality
B00FX40B16|5|These are great wipers. I have always loved the Bosch wipers. These wipers are simple to attach and do a great job keeping my windshield clear. You only really pay attention to the wiper when it's not doing it's job and these wipers never get my attention.
B00T6JNA9O|5|Great piece very well made and it fits the turns signals to work with the factory saddle bags I have for this bike
B0051D3MP6|5|oh
B0010ECUIA|2|The air flow direction is misprinted. I called the company, and simply ignore the direction. Thanks for review by cool guy.It help for me not to remove the plastic handle.
B00A8MZ7IA|5|I am so pleased that I decided to purchase these cloths as they are perfect for wiping & buffing off my favourite wax, (Collinite 845) to a high sheen. The density of the fibres are just right for removing a liquid wax & is tough enough to grip the wax first time so there's no need to keep going over and over to achieve the desired results. I have also used them with detailing & quick waxes and they do a superb job of getting my car shining again. I couldn't find them on sale here in the UK, so I was very pleased to find that they shipped these cloths over to the 51st state!! Import taxes were low as well so, all round,  I highly recommend these cloths to all the avid detailers out there, wherever you may be!
B00IVOZZ84|5|FIT PERFECT LOVE THIS
B00RW7W7G4|4|Good performance for the price. Very outer end of wiper blade does not conform to glass in rest position but does so during rest of sweep. No squeaks but a bit of shudder with minimal rain.
B001898V08|4|The rack bracket is great just make sure you replace the screws with stainless the ones they send with the rack bracket will rust after first rain.  As for cargo rack I used a metal harbor F hitch cargo rack and works amazing.
B00FESA9G8|5|I originally purchased these for my 2015 Subaru Outback. They looked so good I purchased a set for my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, too. WHen installing, the instructions say to heat the guards with a blow dryer or such. I simply let them sit on the dash while I was at work. By the end of the work day, they were warm and pliable. Went on both vehicles very easily. Be sure to clean behind your door handles first. I have had these on my vehicles for a couple months and through several washings and rain storms with no problems.
B00NFA5S90|5|fast delivery and excellent item
B000C7UMKO|5|'95 Mustang was idling very fast. This part was a perfect fit and works great. Got my low idle back!
B00UEC87QS|5|Looks great. Easy to install.
B00KXEMT3E|5|Fits the BMW i8 keys perfectly. Little pricey but it has a tight fit and helps protect key fob in you pockets.
B00F3FJMKG|5|Great product
B00T9D2YEE|5|These are awesome decals.  They went on just as stated.  Any Star Wars fan would love to have these. We bought these and the S. W. Family Car decals so we could mix and match.
B001MOZ1C0|5|About a third or so the cost of the Volvo part. The windows go up and down. What more do you want? We got an old car, don't want to sink money into pitly things like that
B00E4CQ2HA|2|The style and fit of these are great... Just like the original KD sunglasses. .BUT, the shade of purple in the glasses shouldn't even be called &#34;sunglasses &#34;. The shade is very light. The picture is very deceiving. Wearing these in the sun does not reduce the glare at all..very disappointed.. only 8 bucks, but I'm still returning them. I didn't buy them for a fashion show..I bought them to reduce the sunlight when I ride.
B0049ELS54|5|fast and awesome-thanks
B009S7I96I|4|Very high quality and it fit perfectly!
B002S3Y0SU|5|Just as described this trailer light was the perfect replacement for the right side tail, turn and<br />stop light. Great item, and great seller.
B00I3F38OY|5|Perfect for the price.  We lost the casings to the seatbelts and were not sure what to do.  This idea was more of a Hail Mary but works perfectly and especially for the price.
B005NBRYRS|5|Was happy with graphic
B001Y8XWAW|5|Excelent!
B000VU9D1G|4|Easy to install, works good, Should have one single power post to power all fuses.  Don't like having to run a separate power wire to each fuse or bridging to power all fuse holders.
B00AYA3Q0M|1|it didn't fit right in my truck
B00BUROANA|4|I was impressed with the speed this item was delivered. Item pulled 2.9 amps @ 125v = 362.5 Watts.  Fridge working OK
B000O5DZLM|5|Has worked perfectly since installation. Compact/discrete for black trucks.
B008M7IIIY|1|Do not use the locking pin! After one snow storm they rusted on and wouldn't come off. Had to break them just to get air in my tires
B003D5DMUE|3|the old part was flexible ribbed type , for 0% kinking problems, the replacement I recieved is straight, but heavier material, hope I won't kink in the future ...
B00LM56CIQ|3|cheap smelling....
B000GOHUVM|5|Shipped fast and about half price of the auto stores.  Has the oem plug  already on so no wiring just three screws and plug it in.  Awesome!
B00KNJUD0A|5|Excellent product and an excellent service. Cannot find fault
B00310R6MQ|5|Greatt!
B0006H9364|5|Husband had hip replacement, riser worked out perfectly. Just the perfect hight made it easy to use thanks to Thetford.
B00EKTJU26|5|just got these on my 300 very easy to install and look awesome
B00M2PAIDA|1|Part Did NOT fit my 2001 Subaru Legacy A/T 2.5L. Had to return part.

B00HQ2CLMU|5|Excellent
B00CBG30BW|5|Perfect fit!
B000COMX3Q|5|These are a perfect fit. You will get one for each wheel and spare. Excellent quality.
B001HBXZYY|5|Perfect product for my application. I now have a good target to aim at when I recovery my boat.
B00NAQOVF6|4|Used it on a cross-country driving trip. Once I figured out how to get it on (yes, I read the directions), it worked. I had no problem getting it to stay on even though I wear glasses.
B00GUBZYUY|5|Nice fit
B00UKXSIJC|1|Didn't look as i expected to once I put them on.
B007ISYHOC|2|exhaust pipe is to large in dia i will have to be welded on
B005N53AM2|5|Love it!!
B003O95MT8|5|Fits like a glove! I had a little trouble getting the bolts in without taking off the muffler. Just a little enginuity and it worked.
B00480J4UK|5|whiter than stock halogen for sure, it need couple days to set in but so far so good.  Looks good on my 2015 RAV4.
B00KQC9S5K|1|No did not meet my expcitation. The bearings snapring and s***er rod did not fit. Total waste of my money
B0048J01RG|5|Great product at a great price! I'm happy!
B00C7XTAFO|5|Quick Shipping, OEM Product. Thanks!
B00B9J21QW|5|Very good, makes hooking up to  camper so much easier!
B00NQ9I5WC|5|Exactly what we were looking for. Fits nicely in the front area.  Thank you very much
B00EVMT6A8|5|Does the job
B008OV46FW|1|The tool I received was not as pictured.  It was a very poor quality Chinese casting and was too sloppy on both the 10mm and 12mm sizes to risk rounding off the edges of the bolts and nuts I intended to use it on.  Definately misrepresented!
B006GJK978|4|Did the job. Took me a while to figure out how to get the the headless bolt out of the original. Instructions would have been nice. Also I painted mine black so it's not as obvious. All in all. Can't complain
B00ERXG4TM|5|This device is fantastic and easy to use.  The build quality is outstanding.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a friction throttle cruise control.
B000CIXMIC|5|Fit as expected. No problems.
B00GQFR1TQ|5|Picture quality is fabulous! Cords could be a bit longer, especially on the front piece for different vehicle placement.
B00P4XSR0S|1|For some reason it didn't fit on my cylinder heads. On the 125cc dirt bike
B00JODE8WA|5|Exactly what I was lookoing after for a very good price !
B00K326F5E|4|Great tool use it all the time a little bit heavy though and I don't like having to search for my allen wrench every time I want to change the link
B00CJ1X2W6|5|Fits perfect.
B00S3XS0FS|1|They are fading and discoloring less than 2 months old. These are my second pair, what a waste of money.
B000LW3HC0|3|Good so far, although, slightly on the large side.
B000CBWOG0|4|great
B000C5I4EC|5|Great product!! Works awesome
B006XH78VS|3|It was not painted or treated so after about a month or two it had already started to rust. Other than that, the joint is still good after 8months
B00AGPF1LM|5|Awesome! Follow the youtube demo and it is easy, just take your time. Took me about 40 min, saved me over $200
B00K4F0TBQ|2|Didn't fit in the fog light housing as they said it would. Not able to squeeze in the opening
B00CPL8PSG|5|great product
B003JJAUS6|2|Size ran small. Jacket has ugly hidden tassles on the side you can't see in picture. I would not have bought jack had I known.
B00WA4AMYS|1|it is not fitted for 2015 Prius plug in.
B005GL8I9S|5|A little too big but, it stays on!
B00Y2CJ5CQ|5|excellent for back up light..
B00S75E4VG|4|Got here fast and the truck has started every time since
B0013RIOPC|1|Broke opening the door the first time.  Seams ripped
B006YWYCVG|5|Exact replacement for my craftsman lt2000 riding lawn mower. Perfect fit.
B0081ZYPLG|5|WORKED GREAT
B00U16R5ZG|1|Awful awful
B00802GIW4|1|took the front bumper off of my 2015 Ford Fusion to install these just to find out they don't work at all when the car is on. This description doesn't say anything about mewing more parts and it does not work. Same thing for the fog lights.
B00UC42BBU|5|These mirrors fit perfectly, look great and are well built. Well worth the money.
B000J2JEB0|5|The package this came in was slightly different but it is this exact bulb set. They worked perfectly to replace the parking lights in my Highlander.
B007PG5ZN4|5|Love it !!!! Match up perfectly w color of my truck
B000S2SRXC|5|Cost effective...great product..Ty!!!  My Tahoe runs awesome now!!!
B00ZSF3ETQ|5|Terrific purchase!  4,444 mile x-country trip with my Subaru Forester.  Several rainstorms, extremely hot temperatures (topped off at 104 degrees) and everything inside was dry and in perfect shape from beginning to end.  (It IS waterproof, but also heat-proof!)  RoofBag was secure on top of car, fit perfectly between side rails, didn't budge an inch, and driver and passenger felt no difference at all while riding along.  It holds a lot, and it's so easy and compact to store away for the next trip. Recommending to all my friends: buy this RoofBag!
B00HZG1CRC|4|Nice product . ..just need better instructions  for install..or link for look on youtube..<br />Fast shipping
B000CO96JA|5|Perfect fit for the stock diff cover on the 8.25&#34; Chrysler rear axle in my '98 Jeep Cherokee. One less leak...for now.
B001A4EAV0|5|Simple to use and works as advertised. Use of this funnel allowed me to get rid of stubborn air pockets and corrected my overheating issue.
B00KKEKWDQ|1|Only recieved one, but didn't open package for 6 months, so shame on me.
B00486G6SW|5|It was a gift for a friend and she loved it. I didnt have any of the problems anyone else has complained about. Mine was on time unopened and smelled very good.
B000X46M14|5|Makes my '12 Versa HB look like a beast!
B00FMGO9FE|5|The Batman steering wheel cover is awesome.  It was easy to put on, yet is solidly in place.  Plus, you know, it is *Batman.*
B00SX5RSA4|2|There are no washers on the unit I received. The bolt is loose on the nut.
B000DEMJA2|5|Perfect replacement for my 2000 dodge ram
B00B2A2S0C|5|Excellent
B00JJBWMDO|5|Very Good Product
B00OABYBJG|4|There not as large in person as when viewing online.
B001MU28F2|5|Fits perfectly on our 2007 Ford Fusion!
B001DCEUUU|5|perfect fit ! works great !
B002PQOC8S|5|couldn't ask for better service in product and delivery
B000IHWEWM|5|Gift for my husband he loves it
B005C2AE6Q|5|Great product, using 2 of these to hang my kayak in my garage. Working perfect
B004T1YUIE|5|Worked better than factory
B00PJPHEBO|5|Works and cheap. What more do you want?
B00VAVSORY|4|Parts arrived on schedule, look to be OEM quality. Certainly improved my ride on the dirt road I drive on. So far so good. I am satisified.
B000JK6INE|5|This wax lasts and lasts. It goes on fairly easy but be careful to not let it dry too long or it becomes difficult to remove, if this happens use some spray wax to re-moisten it a little, then remove. The shine and durability are top notch. Included is a pic of my car's roof four months after I last waxed.
B009AXGCSC|4|I love the CPS VG200 but every once in a while, I would have to restart to get accurate readings.  Once restarted, I felt confident in the readings.  A must for accurate micron levels.
B00J5ZWJ4Q|1|This is not the idler pulley, this is the belt tensioner pulley. The idler pulley has grooves and rolls on the inside of the belt.
B00I2I104C|5|Great kit for the price. Fit my Jeep Wrangler Sports Unlimited '13 perfectly. It's easily installed. Significant improvement over the factory stock ones.
B00651CLCS|4|Reception is the same or better than the original. No antenna hitting the garage door or whipping all over going through a car wash.
B000EVGFTU|2|Failed after 2 weeks of use...I took it apart and the contacts were black and dirty
B010FJRFE4|5|Great. Great product and the seller is ok too. Very happy
B013Q7SDUW|5|Without this tool it would be almost impossible to locate leaks in the high pressure system. I was able to connect shop air to the ICP with these adapters and found a leak very quickly. This product saved me a lot of time and money!
B00VRPZHQ4|5|Will this fit on my acura rsx 02?
B00C0FMK9C|5|Not only an awesome product, but a service that is second to none. This sticker came from overseas, and was here within a week. I bought it for the design and look. The reflective nature of the sticker was an added feature. Because let's face it, we didn't buy this product because it was safety value. We bought it because it looks good and it reflects. I would recommend this to anybody, and I will also have you know did the customer service is the best I have had from a business that ship me products from Amazon so far. Thank you for this product. I will be ordering more.
B005BNZ9UM|5|Nice and big, no longer worry that the trailer might slip off the block of wood
B00G7G9LU6|5|It fit like a glove
B000NUT3NM|5|Looks, fits, and functions great
B00XI0UFZE|1|Men's extra large, is a woman's medium. How about some type of quality control. Would not recommend.
B004K2FSXI|5|Best compression tester I've owned yet. Worked well on my 2003 Ford Expedition 5.4 with long, recessed spark plugs.
B00CSX42WY|1|turned yellow after 3 weeks of being on the car. I mean I understand that it's so cheap because it a sticker emblem but I was hoping it would last at least a few months
B004HCM9H4|5|Great
B00BSAW3WY|5|Awesome price & product
B00407X7XG|5|This was an exact match for my 2006 Ford Fusion. I had a little rust spot on my trunk lid and needed to take care of it before it got worse. a little sandpaper (220, 400, 600, 800, and 1000 grit) primer, this paint, Dupli-Color clear coat, and an afternoon is all it took.
B0051P9PEQ|1|Didn't fit. Had to be modified. Not a gel battery as described. One cell was missing a cap. Poor quality.
B00EZK892C|2|I expected way better.  Not as described.
B00NTO8SZ8|4|Install was very easy and it looks great on my kia soul!
B000CMFSEE|5|Fit perfectly in my 1996 Mazda B3000, which is basically a rebadged Ford Ranger.  Great price too!
B00PRUWIO4|5|Looks great!
B00ON9SU9M|5|One of the favorite tools in our arsenal.<br /><br />This is so much better than the old clay bar world - it's faster, covers more area easier, and if you drop it, just wash it off and you are good to go.<br /><br />You'll be surprised how long it lasts. It gives you options that would be difficult before - after you wash and rinse your car, snowfoam it again for lubrication and use this to clay.
B000FCGUAM|5|good product
B00IPS3JC0|3|doesn't fit my honda fit
B000WPP97C|5|great!
B003YLKJZS|5|Fast delivery  exact part needed for moms 2001 Malibu
B0002SQYV4|3|I really think this is pretty much the same formula as the old school 2001 turtle wax stuff.<br />Next time I am going to just buy the best ounces per dollar as it seems all major brands are all pretty much the same.
B008D7POBC|5|Works perfectly especially when you are using it in conjunction with another product to keep your vehicle and all your property safe inside ur vehicle.
B00EZAAENE|1|Cheap don't buy..
B00T36SI0G|3|provider was great, product not so much.  Cheap quality
B000C2G5ZK|5|Fits
B0007LZK9I|5|works as advertised, nothing fancy
B00PBD0EPW|5|Love! Love! Love! Such good quality with easy installation and quick delivery. :)
B000FRLO9Y|5|Awesome charger I have had for several years and still works perfect.
B007JTVMLQ|5|Perfect. Using on CTX700.  The OEM Honda Tall Windshield on the CTX still causes helmet buffet. This total fixes and looks cool
B00RZ4Z3GK|5|Cheaper than buying them one at a time here local. Only used 2 so far but they have worked great.
B005SVXQS4|3|Only 3 stars at the moment, as I have not installed this item yet. I'll provide an updated review once I've installed it.
B003ZUMUD2|5|Perfect fit and product came on time.
B000IY2CN6|5|Great breaks
B00669POMI|4|Its very nice. I would give it a 5 if it was metal.
B0059ACZLI|4|I use this while camping as a &#34;rug&#34; in our tent. It works great because it is filled with foam to give a little cushion. The only issue I had with it was that the flap was bursting at the seams, exposing the stuffing after the first use.
B010EYQ60E|5|Go Trump 2016
B00NB808P0|5|Outstanding product, transaction, and shipping. Highly recommend.
B002VE3VHW|5|I love it when I finally received it.  It fit my lawnmower perfect and it's a great outdoor color.  It was quite a delay in my getting this order though.
B00G5RTYYK|5|👍👍
B000CQBFGU|4|fast delivery; good price
B00IO98BPA|5|Great valué , good quality , good price and good service
B000BROXRI|3|Sturdy enough to hold tie down straps. But nothing else.  Problem is the nylon was all sewn flat,  it has zero flex so when one pocket is full the rest are hard to get anything in.
B00RGQ1W7Q|5|Fits well and performed as advertised.
B0048YKWO8|3|Was a surprise that the wiring colors changed, but it came with the updated plug.  I had to guess which new color went with the old wiring.
B00EKOKQE2|5|Excellent purchase! Installed easily. I was very impressed with receiving the &#34;complete package&#34;. Installed the compressor assembly, plugged in the electrical and air lines, started the vehicle and away it went. Message on the DIC disappeared and the new compressor has been working properly ever since. Was quoted over $900.00 to have this done at the dealer.
B00XUX25S4|5|Love the item,  just wish it came with clips.
B00YXA6PNY|1|water got into my intake the first time it rained.<br />Not worth the money
B005JYX8YM|5|Fit my 2003 Toyota Solara perfectly!<br /><br />A bit tricky to install the old motor on the new regulator, but that's how they're designed. I would recommend researching how to install the motor before trying it yourself or you may have the spooled cable pop out and then you're going to have a heck of a time re-spooling it - believe me, I messed up the first time and had to have a friend re-spool it for me.<br /><br />Once I figured out how to put the window motor on, the rest was pretty straightforward.
B003S72W3U|2|Doesn't fit like it said it would, kinda flimsy
B0002MSY90|5|excellant
B00GIZZGLO|5|Fit perfectly and completed my repair. If I had to do it over again I would buy the slider with the arm assembly. It was a pain to get the rivet fastened.
B00X36RILW|5|Worked absolutely perfect. Good quality and cheaper than the local parts stores that would have to order it anyway. Would definitely purchase again.
B0001CMUV4|5|Great product  went on easy stopped rattle
B003ZJ2HMM|5|Delivered on time. Very well packed. And item was as described and very easy to install.
B008EFTSTC|3|Out of the set, I used one of the large &#34;Zombie Outbreak Response Team&#34; biohazard symbols on my car. The vinyl is passable and looks good on the back window, though I'd been hoping for a thicker quality. Not a bad decal set overall, but can't exactly recommend for outside use due to the thickness issue. On computers, notebooks, lockers, plastic cases/storage bins? Go for it.
B000K1DUWE|5|Used this socket on my 1996 F250 4x4 PSD with Dana 50 4600# front axle.  Fit perfectly.  There is some confusion whether to use this item, 7158, or the 7157 version, for my 1996 F250.  I took the advise of previous reviews and bought this one even though the range of vehicles listed with the 7158 *does not* include my '96 F250... but it did work.
B000E347PW|1|could not use
B00C3NA32C|5|Pretty
B0022SHR6I|4|greath the do a good job keepthe wind and dust out of your eyes wen you ride!!
B00LTESATO|4|Great upgrade from factory
B0066RCWC0|3|Parts seem decent, time will tell on durability.  I was frustrated with the fitment guide for these parts.  The add says they fit my 2000 A6 Quattro w/ a 4.2 v8 the fitment guide says it will fit.  Control Arm Bushing Or Kit, KIT - FRONT - w/o STEEL SUBFRAME.  I was confused by the w/o steel sub frame part as all the a6 cars have a steel sub frame!  I figured the add was a misunderstanding and they meant that it was for cars with aluminum uprights  not the cast steel uprights( or steering knuckle ) I was wrong.  The lower control arms do not work with the 4.2L aluminum uprights.  Please correct the fitment guide and use the proper wording.  as far as all my research has shown 4.2L cars all had aluminum uprights and steel sub frames.
B000LW3HC0|5|Husband likes.
B000K38E78|1|Over rated I have a 9.9 Mercury that weighs 84.00 and is it a shaky load for engine stand..
B0010E00T6|5|Easy installation that you can learn from a YouTube video. No hassle at all
B004RNSO2M|5|Very pleased with the fast shipping a+
B000ARPVOI|5|Good product. Have used before and do feel a difference in acceleration. Would reommend!.
B008TLOY90|5|nice for the price
B0048SGCCU|5|These pads worked better than the standard EBC pad and better than the stock pads on my Tiger 800.
B00E3ALEKI|5|it was exactly what i was looking for onlt thing is they came in seperate boxes and could have saves some shipping costs as the items were small enough to fit in one box.
B00KMCY5I4|5|Love it!
B002HXW2K4|5|AAAA++++
B00KC399SY|5|Good deal
B000IHJXHG|5|Great product. U. V light gets hot very quick.
B005G82C8E|5|Due to some early confusion, I was shipped the wrong size shades initially. Randi immediately shipped me the two different sized that it could be and a prepaid return label, trusting me to return the ones I didn't use.<br />I consider that going above and beyond to take care of a customer.<br />Once installed, they are fantastic. They sit down low behind the windshield wipers and you really don't even notice that they are there. When you stop it takes just a moment to pull them up and hook them in place. I have a radar detector up high on my windshield so the eye on the shade doesn't get all the way to the hook on the windshield so I just added a small stretchy black band to the eye and it works like a charm.<br />Everyone that gets in my car and sees me drop the sunshade asks where to get them, this is a product that sells itself.<br />It's a truly great idea.
B001GQ12PO|5|Great tag. Very well made and came right on time.
B000F5HU6W|5|This load tester arrived in perfect condition, it is very easy to use and worked well.  This will definitely allow me to determine the condition of my car batteries quickly and easily.
B00252ILH0|5|Very good no problems installing.
B0002SRCKG|5|Great product great experience
B00RW294MY|5|Beautiful
B00G0PQR74|5|This thermostat fit exactly in my Toyota celica 2001 gts. Make sure before purchase that your car use this type of thermostat because according to the manual must be another part number
B00062YX5U|5|Works flawlessly
B000R3SNJU|5|Excellent.
B00EDFPN1O|5|Excellent way to charge a classic cars dead battery and keep it topped off. Great purchase.
B002VVG04Q|5|easy install
B00C0C2A90|3|It's a good looking belt but it doesn't fit my car or my mothers.
B00BGTY6HC|4|Second hand but works perfectly - easy to programme.. Just the attachment for the key-ring missing so I had to bore a small hole through it instead.
B009DJM97Q|4|I give four stars only cause it fit tight as it should. The forming is a bit off. Over all working great.
B004I0H86C|4|worked fine good quality
B003KFQ2CM|3|It is OK and exactly as the 8.2 inch tall, 6 wide by 4 inches wide, (rectangle shape). All of which I missed while ordering. Great shipping, got here in two days but this is not a large funnel. Which was my mistake. Should be five stars but I have buyer's remorse.
B00Q2BCQAS|5|Exact replacement. Works perfectly, a bit brighter than a 1076 bulb that has a few hours on it, which is great. Used it to replace sconce lights in a 2000 Winnebago.
B00NBOSI0G|5|Got my ProGo a few days ago and I am really enjoying riding it around my neighborhood in Southern California. Its been pretty hot here lately and the scooter seems to be dealing with the heat just fine. I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for that last mile transportation.
B007KGHV1S|5|Works great for me. I have a solo seat with Chrome World International luggage rack with driver backrest and no passenger backrest so was looking for a lay-down type carrier. This fit the bill.
B000CO8VSC|5|I have a 01 F 250 and these pads work great.  Very little dust and no noise.  I don't know what brand was on there that these replaced but they have much better stopping power.
B007Y545MI|3|I was excited to find this shade, since it's gigantic enough to fit the windshield of my Ford Flex.  It does what it's supposed to--blocks the sun very efficiently.  Easy to install but I do have a major quibble--the foil backing gets SUPER HOT in the Texas sun, and it rolls up for storing and believe me when I say that it's incredibly difficult to roll up a hot, gigantic piece of insulated foil when you're behind the steering wheel.  If it was an accordion fold shade, I would have given it at least 4 stars.  However, I think the engineering of this piece needs to be re-thought.
B00EC2CG9U|3|Size is as advertised. I wanted the metal spirals to cover the bungee knots which it didn't. I ended up taping them down.
B000F3RYGA|4|I have used this a few times, it works well, key operates great.  This is more of a visual deterrent, It will keep the honest people honest but if someone really wants what you have they will have to tools to get around this.  Overall I am happy, and can breath a little easier that my investment is protected at least a little bit.
B0055PD1H4|5|AMAZING<br />brought new color to barely a year old car whose side blacks were starting to discolorate. I used it everywhere there was plastic on the outside. Everything including the front grill looks even better.<br />Another A+ product by meguiar..<br /><br />Dont forget this product effectively removes a small layer of plastic, dont use too often.
B000NU87PM|5|AAAA++++
B006U6NMI0|4|Great
B00R94YUPG|3|Okay, well here's the deal. The adhesive tape BAREKY sticks. If it gets hot and your car warms up they will come off. After about 3 weeks they completely lost their stickyness, so I bought super glue to attach it. I have a 2007 honda civic hybrid, initially the magnet was too low for the sensor. The two practically have to be touching for it to work. Luckily my boyfriend constructed a little block out of the material that was included so that the magnet would be leveled higher. However due to the fact that these do not stick at all , the passengers side magnet fell and is lost for good. They work ok, they are pretty and cool, but I'd suggest spend a little extra few bucks on a higher quality version. Perhaps an electrical one, that way you don't have to construct anything of your own or superglue your car for these to work.
B00E57HKBQ|5|Works good. Saved a lot of money rather than buying OEM!
B00GUTOB46|5|The first day I wore this neck brace, I had a really bad high speed crash.  I walked away without serious injury because of all the protective gear I was wearing, including this brace.  The next day I was a little sore, but nothing like I would have been had I not been wearing this!  After about a minute of wearing it, I don't even notice it's on.  It saved me from a lot of pain and recovery time.  I think it's well worth the money, I actually won't go DH'ing without it!!
B0043VTFP8|4|The after market window winder works as expected. It was easy to place (at least for my son).
B00VPEA7VW|1|This plate looks exactly as it appears. But do not use it on your car. Quality is awful.
B00OF8S74O|5|Jacket fits my husband really good. Made with good quality fabric.
B0007ZHA92|5|Eliminates my cars' blind-spots and easy to put on.
B00EAOI93W|5|Exactly what I expected.  A perfect fit.
B004IV58AY|4|VERY NICE THANKS GUYS !!
B0060HVCHW|5|Tired of the work-out that Turtle wax requires, I tried this Formula 1 liquid and am completely satisfied.  Can't believe the finish, how easy it goes on and off, and the ridiculous price.
B004809YBE|5|love the handle
B00SHF5Z64|5|I'm a girl with smaller hands but the shifter isn't to big and it looks awesome
B007THCA4G|5|Excellent
B001KSEKDE|5|Works great for 91 CRX DX
B00DX8DK1W|5|Works great
B00R6E0Y22|5|Love my Weathertech's.  I ordered them so I could put them in my new Fiesta ST the day I took delivery. They fit great. Only drawback is the backseat is 2 individual mats, rather than a single piece, with a part to go over the hump like the Husky's.
B00D94SVIC|5|PARTS ARE LIKE JEWELRY FOR HOTRODS. PERFECT FOR MY APPLICATION.  PURCHASE/SHIPPING WERE GREAT.<br />CANT WAIT TO GET MY ENGINE COMPLETED.
B00F9VNEWQ|5|Loves these wiper blades.
B003LNJWTI|4|Bright but doesn't light up a lot
B0018GSVG0|1|This has very little difference then my regular exhaust and i straight piped my vr6. Looks like im going with the straight pipe, buy this if you want to be a ricer:)
B001L9KI56|3|This helped some but started to slip as I used it more.  I use this and a throttle lock (Go Cruise) to give me hand positions on long rides.
B00NIOBC0C|4|Well on paper, it's a great idea. The idea is, you unscrew the tip off your stock plug and then you screw the plug into this socket. It's for people who are driving off road or camping. It secures the plug so it doesn't come out. Great on paper but maybe I got the bad egg... I ended up with 2 so I gave one to my room mate. He tried it out and on first trip, the ring that secures the outlet to the vehicle snapped off.  I contaced the seller (Hades Auto) and they told me to talk to ARB... It's such a cheap part that I might just sort it out with a bunch of gorilla glue. It makes me question if this is in fact an ARB product...
B000KJF100|5|item got here on time, a day early actually. it arrived in pristine condition. its not faded or anything. perfect to give my truck some nostalgia. very happy!
B00AGQYY0U|4|Looks good didn't affect function.
B00K889FCI|5|Miracle!
B00IN4HQIO|5|Good price and they work great.<br />Thank you!
B007KLXR52|5|fit with no problems
B009SHJH00|5|very good and fast service would order again
B007JEK37K|4|Had it installed a couple of weeks ago. It was correct for my car & works great. No more static.
B00BJCAPEE|4|Slick, but not ONR slick.
B00AKIVO5M|3|OVERPRICED AND LOOSELY FITTED... SO I'M QUITE SURE IT WOULD EASILY FALL OUT BEFORE LONG - OR THE FIRST TIME I USED A COMMERCIAL CAR WASH LIKE MANY PREVIOUS REVIEWERS HAVE SAID.<br /><br />I SIMPLY WRAPPED A RUBBER BAND AROUND THE SHAFT, MOISTENED IT A BIT TO SLIDE IN, AND THAT HAS CURED THE RATTLE-FIT AND RISK OF FALL-OUT.<br /><br />IF YOU HAVE THIS SIZE RECEIVER TUBE AND WANT A 3X5&#34; OVAL HITCH (AS I DID FOR MY OWN DESIGNS ON IT) THERE IS NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE BUT THIS SUPPLIER... AND PER THE PRICE, THEY SEEM TO KNOW IT
B007FQQURO|5|right parts. took me less than an hour to take out starter clean and replace. now she starts up fast the first time.
B001DAGGRW|4|The filter incorrectly showed this for my 2008 Ford Escape XLT, which has rear drum brakes with the parking brake cable.  This kit is for the smaller, separate parking brake only, which is not on my vehicle.. For rear drums, you need the H7355 kit instead.
B000BYD3WC|5|Installed w/ no issues. The overall quality seems solid. The plastic coating looks & feels durable. No complaints. If I have any issues I'll update this post.
B000N9XFUK|5|My Sea Ray was running a bit rough so I tossed in this new cap and rotor.. Made a difference and took 7 minutes..  Seemed to run better at high RPM's.
B00MQ5Z5F2|5|this is awesome. just went on a three week road trip and this saved us several times. Not only us it also helped out a random stranger in a target parking lot.
B000WZ4KBS|5|good product
B002SSBPQK|1|Sheded all over my Alcantara seats.. Worthless spend more time picking up the hairs all over the car...returning
B00XVDAADK|5|These car mats are very good in quality. I love that while they seem very thick and sturdy, they are not super heavy like other premium mats I have seen at the auto parts store. At first I thought they might be too big, but after receiving them I was happy to see they are the perfect size for my car. These car mats should fit a compact to mid-size car or truck. The mats include areas around the edges where you can cut to fit your car if needed. I also like that the two rear mats have the &#34;bridge&#34; in the center for best coverage. Most car mats don't have this (I have only seen this feature on truck mats before). They will likely be too small for a full size truck. Quality wise, these are comparable to the best quality mats you can get at an auto parts store. Disclaimer: I received a promotional discount of this item in exchange for an honest review.
B00OQP5ZL4|1|Saw the picture and thought to myself that it was pretty cool, had no idea the the picture you see is literally the on the send you. It's a s***ty printed copy of that image it has the lines from the truck it's on and white spots all around where I guess their printer is failing. They send it to you just like that printed out and then you have to make it into a sticker with these other two pieces of garbage that don't even work either. I gave it 1 star cause I had to, it doesn't even deserve that. I didn't even bother sending it back I just threw it in the trash cause that's what it is. Don't buy this it's complete crap.
B00D01N8WS|1|Very Bad model, not a good buy, you will regret spending your money.  Not as good as seen on picture, had to throw it away.
B0009IQZH0|5|Good stuff!
B005NXMFW0|5|Excellent Fit
B00SYQF00W|3|The magnet looks good, but it's kind of thin for a car magnet and within a few weeks I had to take it off because it was curling up and I was afraid it would fall off my car. I'm going to try in the winter and see if it was just the heat this summer that made it do that. I'm a little disappointed, I worked really hard to complete my first half marathon and as we do in the runner's world, I wanted to show off my accomplishment.
B00386POYA|5|very good and fast service would order again
B001P3035I|3|Purchased these with the Flexi Freeze Ice Vest (blue) I haven't had a chance to use these yet. Very simple to change out with the Velcro fastenings.
B000C5FTKY|1|This part failed after about 30 starter cycles.  Although it has a FORD PN on it,  Possibly it is a knock off and appears to be poor quality compared to the OE part.  I had replaced all my switches and sensors on my 99 F350 as preventative maintenance.  This part started smoking.  I think the unit stuck in the on position.  I removed it and installed the 16 year old Ford OE part back on the car.  Unfortunately, it looks like it have a very short warranty and thus is not eligible for return.
B00Q2NF28E|4|Nice shirt, the Large is like a medium but it's ok with me since I wanted a medium. The colors are very nice on it. Took some time to arrive since it was coming from far. Hope it will hold up to the washing! !
B00W31ZDV0|5|Excellent product. Great value for money. Highly recommended !!!!
B00L9J7MD4|4|It looks great on my MacBook Air, even though I didn't put it in that pattern
B00BODWPQ4|2|The plastic inside Burned in seconds
B00COYZGQS|5|East Install and looking Great on my 2015 Tundra
B00AO6EAW4|5|Awesome helmet. Husband loved it.
B001F7GJMK|5|Wonderful product. I just installed it and began instantly saving money due to fuel cost cut. Besides, it makes the vehicle to last longer (eg. catalytic converter extended life and so on).
B00L1RUUZQ|5|Worked great
B000F5LKNQ|5|Bought 2 years ago, and still working and looking great.
B005OD8KAU|5|Exactly what I needed and came very timely!
B0067MW32I|4|Perfect
B003Z9UV8Y|5|My second one. Love it!
B000JKNZ4E|4|The supplied screws were too short for a firm bite.  I'm apprehensive about driving with the possibility of these things blowing off my roof.  I'll be replacing the four outermost ones with slightly longer screws.  One year later they are still very firmly placed.  I was originally supplied with 1 1/2&#34; #10 screws.  What I really needed was 1 3/4&#34;.  I couldn't find them anywhere.  I ended up using some 1 1/2&#34; #12 screws, and a number of 2&#34; #10 screws.  I applied silicone to each.  So far I have no leaks, but I do fear that the holes I drilled will rust and I will get some leaks.  Another consideration that I hadn't thought of at the time was what was I drilling and running screws into?  Some vehicles have side curtain airbags placed up there, and there could be electrical too.  Fortunately I didn't hit anything.   This was a brand new Dodge Grand Caravan I put the rails on, and it really was scary as hell drilling 14 holes in a brand new roof.  I read above someone said 8 holes, but mine was 14, 7 on each side, 3 front and back, and 1 for the center post.  My next vehicle I'm going to do my best to find what I want without having to do something like this.  But I think the most important thing is, I did get my desired result.  I think they look great.  Vans and SUVs without roof rails just look unfinished to me.
B004CJ4IQC|5|Exactly what I wanted.
B00MIZT7OK|3|It's a great idea... But it's plastic.  I must have missed that in the description.  We just sent our daughter off to college and this is what she wanted to make her feel 'safe'.. It wasn't going to be very effective unless you're hitting someone in just the right spot..<br />So my husband took it to a welding shop and they made a new one for her out of metal...  In theory, this is great.. but with it being made out of plastic, then not so much...
B000VU7M4Q|5|Perfect!
B00V47TXU6|5|I put this cutie on my car and he looks perfect! Yay Totoro!
B00B9EZAJM|4|all items are great great job
B00GHT4A5O|1|You are correct. This does not fit the Ford explorer either.  Your OEM motor will not fit. it is off by 45 deg. The only motor that will fit is a dorman, so this is useless..  The OEM motor is parallel to the regulator frame.  If you look at the Dorman part that comes with the motor, you will see that it 45degs different that the OEM motor.
B000UOGREO|5|Good price
B00SDQPQUW|5|Awesome sticker came today on 8-21 . As posted. Cannot wait to put on trunk of motorcycle ! Thank You !
B00PYRS8J4|5|Worked great as a replacement on my camper bed
B0041TJRXC|5|Perfect Match
B001AX65QO|4|USED 2 ON MY 96 FORD F-150 XLT 4X4.IT DOESNT REPLACE THE EXPENSIVE STOCK HANGERS,BUT YOU CAN MAKE EM WORK OK.
B009LN5WVY|5|Fast shipping, great product! I would order again!
B004DRQ1FO|5|This was a great bargain since they came with the bulbs.
B000IZ0YR6|5|Great price and fit perfectly etc...
B004JNJPHI|5|Works great.<br />Thank you
B00J5KRUHM|3|Great trash basket but it doesn't stay open and collapses easily. I had to modify it with pieces of moulding I cut to size. It comes with dinky plastic sticks that attach to sleeves in the bottom but they don't work.  I keep it between the seats in the back so I can reach it from the front. My car doesn't have a hump in the center so it sits flat.
B004MEBENM|5|Great product....
B00F8K1L1Y|5|Thanks
B000BZ969U|4|Items were properly packaged and were high quality replacements.  Very satisfied!
B00GJ1H3PO|5|Exact fit tks.
B0049MTGLO|5|It was everything I expected, and more, easy to mount and as sturdy as it looks !
B00C6R1P6I|5|Great tool easy to use saved my but
B000K7HAJC|5|Great product.  Fit, finish, and performance is what you would expect Yoshimura.
B000GKB0EE|4|I purchased this as a gift and was hoping it would not be cheaply made. It isn't cheaply made at all, and I was impressed by the ring. The connector is what you would expect and may have to be replaced eventually but this keychain will last a long while. Excellent &#34;old school&#34; Mickey merchandise.
B00CLUVW1I|5|This big is nothing special but I believe it will get the job done.
B0007UQ2N2|5|Great price for a well made product.
B00KAT2WDE|5|Outstanding product. Looks very nice.
B0061QEPU8|5|Just got it and it looks great Go Bucks!
B001V3959W|4|Great Buy
B007OW62V8|5|Just as stated, genuine/original Toyota air filter. Very easy to replace.
B000DT7W2W|5|Fast Shipping, Sounds great!
B007Z35Y56|5|Washable, breathable, nice grip.
B0027G4P0G|3|As others have said, this doesn't fit correctly with the Pro 4x Luxury package due to the amplifier on the driver-side rear seat, but I knew that before purchasing. Otherwise it looks good and works well.
B000CPI6VI|5|It works!!!!!!
B0002SA0C8|4|Served it's purpose of keeping my jeep TJ sport dry in the rain. The only thing is that it fits precisely in the back cabin and I had to put additional velcro  because in case of windy rainy days water can get trough the sides.
B00U6YDUO8|3|Good for the price, one downfall about this product is that the plate does not stay up over 30 mph. Any bumps will cause the plate to flip back down
B000C9EMCQ|4|does the job
B00MGTS1WW|5|This is an excellent product, I installed it and traveled from Chicago to northern Ontario and back, more than 2000 miles, went through numerous heavy rains, bumpy road, up and down the hills, there is absolutely no problem with this product, stays dry inside not a single drop of water. Easy to install and very spacious, we have more than 200 lb of luggage/cooler/other stuff in the bag, goes really well with the Pro Series 63153 cargo carrier. I would recommend this product to anyone who needs it, no regret.
B0057B57EG|3|Fit and Worked but not same internal fittings as original Mirror. Was hoping to use Outside of Original Mirror with new insides of this Mirror, but redesigned and had to use complete mirror. And of course Mirror is Black and Car is Silver. Also Original mirror connections were Cast White Metal these insides are Plastic were it attaches to the vehicle.
B0023UPORY|4|good to use.
B005ZWM0R4|5|Works well for basic code reading and other diagnostics  Have used many times to figure out what the idiot light on the dash was on for.  Nice to have on Laptop as you can easily look up info about the code on line. cheaper then a separate hand held code reader.
B00JU65OP6|1|I donated it to a thrift shop right away.  Distorts your view/vision and made me worry as I drove.
B00L1RUUZQ|5|It fit my Scion XB and they did fast shipping I was very happy
B00EC0Z6BM|5|This was a perfect replacement for my passenger mirror which I accidentally shattered. Looks just like the original and it was easy to install! I'm very pleased.
B00M0ADAU0|5|Perfect size and conditions
B00JGBZHRA|5|Works great
B0010DZZSI|5|Good product from Fram. Help eliminate orders for cars A/C ducts. Have used before and will continue to use. Would recommend.
B008JPG2H8|5|Fast shipping and easy installation
B00H08JB9Q|5|these frames give my A3 a very polished finished look.
B004FG1HQQ|5|quick service and great product: arrived safe and sound: happy happy
B006O4HRHU|5|fit like a glove, shipping was fast...  I would highly recommend for future purchases
B003LFPY5M|5|Works great!! Repaired my TCC lockup problem in about 10 minutes.
B003U2MWC4|5|Looks great and fit the grill perfect
B00GRT3H12|5|Fits good and look great
B004OFK9PS|5|My favorite thing about this product is watching my friends struggle to fold it up. It works great and keeps the interior of my car significantly cooler than without it.
B00FH3YB5K|4|Works good.  the bottom pull cord needs to be kept tight.  Whole a lot .  Great place to put take out from fast food with out spilling
B004W7KS2C|5|Fits fine, works well
B002MQOXGW|5|Works great for my motorcycles -- Harley 1200 Sportster and a Yamaha 1300 tourer.
B007Y3BKNC|3|The blue lens on the light dims it a little too well to where it is a bit hard to tell that the switch is on.  Also the switch gets EXTREMELY hot to the touch after 20-30 minutes of being on.  I was surprised by the heat since this is suppose to be an LED, which usually means low heat.  I suspect like a few other users my switches are part of the batch that are not LED.  I will take one apart to confirm and update this down another star if that is the case.  Also there are no instructions included, so I used a meter to determine which terminal was supposed to go where.  Overall the switch does function correctly, which is mainly what I need it to do.  But I am concerned about the heat and possibly false advertising about it being LED.
B000UZD0AM|5|Very nice high quality
B00FKPJJNY|5|Lights were great and super bright for car interior. worked well and was not defective.
B000C94H5I|5|This fixed the engine light on my 1998 eclipse gs although the exhaust gas smell is still there but i only wanted to get rid of the engine light so it worked perfectly.
B0054JI9YG|5|Used it in my 94 Chevy k3500 four door dually the high low air switch works for my air locker in the rear axle couldn't be happier
B000WL9HI8|5|This is a replacement.  Original stopped sticking to the window after a few seasons.  Is fairly accurate. Love the large numbers rand F & C  scales.  Is rather pricey.
B00BCRMAR6|1|Doesn't fit seat of truck properly slides out of place all the time
B0000AY4YT|5|Used on the nose of a 5th wheel.  Extremely smooth & shiny.  Hoping that it repels sticky bugs from highway travel
B000GD5FMY|5|I can't think of one complaint. These fit my big head and fight the sun and bugs just fine. I'm pretty sure they aren't the answer if you ride without a windshield. Only goggles or a full face worked when that was my choice of bike. Otherwise they work fine and at this price I won't fuss if I lose or break a pair.

B00OHR9JYU|1|Sent front axles back because scared to use them because way<br />the rear axles turned out.
B004K9KETY|5|In addition to my personal vehicles I also use this for my fleet of golf course turf equipment and it cleans awesome with lots of suds. At one ounce per 5 gallons of water it is extremely economical.

B00A740VQM|3|Some bits fit sloppy

B00W4XDM88|5|I like it
B00KTIYXLU|5|I bought these for my 2002 Ford Explorer and they are so worth it. It beats paying the $150 bucks at a dealership for the same thing. Even comes with instructions on how to program them. Great buy!!

B00DD0ZPP4|5|Love it!
B004UBCKYY|5|Excellent
B0068C4KPK|5|Quieted down top end on my heritage with 64k miles. This oil with the Hiflofiltro oil seems to be a good pairing. Save a few bucks as well!
B0080B3GW0|5|OEM. Took 3 minutes to install on 2013 Explorer. Check inlet fuel warning and check engine light went away. Also cleaned the easy fuel enrty using the nozzle adapter and WD 40.
B005BNP7Z4|5|This is the most it dresses up my tow hitch so much and is functional as a brake lite to , totally awesome .
B0049CGIRO|5|Good product.  Had minor problem, Tyler at HubcapsPlus  handled expeditiously in a very courteous manner, product works just fine.  Product arrived 30 minutes before I actually needed it.  How's that for timing??????
B000KKLLFS|5|it fits in my car tire perfectly.
B0002KNVPE|5|Hey... it's rubber hose. And it got a customers truck up and running. And all at a great price. What's not to like. Think I'll buy some more in a different size.

B003E3PYOW|5|very pleased with product
B00EE3LRS8|5|Only used this a couple of times, but it's got one of everything. Seems like a great tool so far!
B002UC6P6E|5|Exactly  what it said it was
B0015S7XWY|5|Work great!  Perfect fit - Very strong - especially when they get warm !  Very Good !<br />Solved the weak braking issues with my Heavy Suburban 3/4 ton !
B005KU9FRY|5|Need I say more?
B001L5IJ0G|4|Appears to be a good replacement battery for Uninterruptible Power Supply, UPS.  Has been working OK since installed over a month ago.  Much cheaper than what looks like an identical battery from Batteries Plus.
B00ELBCSZY|5|Probably one of the best universal seat covers out there. Many years ago I was looking at used cars. All the leather seats had a lot of surface wear and tear for only 2-3 years of use. As I usually wear jeans, I have covered my seats since. This cover has a heavy duty material on the surface with a lighter stretch type cloth on the sides and back. The covers go on quick. I have separate headrests and the cover fits perfectly for a universal type. As I mentioned on my review of the Dickies rear bench cover, there is a heavy industrial scent. I compare it to a petroleum based pistachio. But for the money the covers work. I usually have computer cases and brief case on the passenger seat and now I don't have to worry about wear or damage. Plus when you get change from a drive-thru, the change stays on the passenger cover and doesn't disappear. There is a small dowel built into the seam that is meant to be placed thru the junction of bottom and upright seat components. It works and pulls the material rearward. There are no issues of the covers coming loose or getting out of position. For the money they protect my $3,000 leather seat upgrade. Plus being black, they blend in and don't really stand out screaming seat cover. Although some may like pink flamingo fabric covers.
B0097AHE0S|5|So I Thought this thing was kinda cheesy and would break right away, it proved me wrong and is going strong , great buy for the price
B00F8X1XBE|2|The emblems that go on the rims are nice but the hood and trunk emblems are not only the wrong size to fit the indentation where they should be placed but they are really low quality. I regret taking a chance and buying these rather than the ones from the dealer. I suggest you don't waste your money on these and get original ones.
B00ULNXCVK|5|durable and authentic
B000276B18|5|brand name , good protection
B0024E6QX0|4|Fit snugly in the vent holes and I can't feel any heat on the other side of them with the sun shining directly down. As long as they don't self-destruct or start emitting buckets of VOC's into the trailer for some reason I can't imagine any complaints I would have in the future.
B002X7VH1Y|5|Very nice polish. Cleans beautifully and the shine really is glossy. Did a beautiful job on the black granite with no smearing when I ran my fingers over it. Surface more resistant to water marks. I bought this product and Granite Gold cleaner to test them side by side, and the Gel-Gloss left a much better finish.
B008Y967GU|4|First, just got a recall for the hydraulic lifts, so make GMC replace this shaft too because it has the same crappy attachment fitting as the actuators. Of course I already replaced all 3 long before this recall finally arrived last week.<br />Fit just like it was supposed to. Easy to install without having to remove that rear panelling. I could reach bottom end by the gear & motor just from pulling tire jack acess cover open. Cost seemed a bit much though
B008PPNEK0|3|Wanted the purple bands, but they sent black...but, the quality of the product is the main factor, so very pleased..
B00TOVE2SW|4|Very useful to me. Perfect for my everyday use at work.
B00FJW14IQ|5|Very great product for the price. This gloves provides a lot of protection. Well made high quality gloves. Awesome ventilation while not sacrificing safety. Well thought of glove they put a lot into designing this glove. If you just starting out of well seasoned rider this glove is a great everyday riding glove.<br /><br />I LOVE IT. I would buy it again
B007KA7PP6|5|Carters little farter starter.
B00069CN2I|5|Cipa 80910 Chevrolet /gmc custom pair towing is what i need
B00T8HPF24|5|I got these to install in my 2005 Chevy Colorado, and they work perfectly.  The only problem that I had was when installing them, the positive and negative were backwards on the wiring for the truck so simply plugging them up wouldn't work since LEDs are polarity sensitive.  I had tried to take the plug apart to swap the wires, but the plugs Chevy used on my truck are extremely hard to disassemble, so in lieu of trying to take them apart and potentially busting them, I just installed them flipped around.  This works fine other than the fact that now the lock tab is backwards, so it will not lock.  To prevent them from coming loose though, I wrapped the plugs up with electrical tape and they have been working perfectly now for about 2 months now.  The kit comes with 2 All-in-One LED bulbs that simply plug right into your original wiring harness and then twist into the headlight fixture just like installing a regular incandescent or halogen bulb.  These are much easier than installing the HID Xenon bulbs, since there is no extra ballast to install, all of the required electronic parts are encased in the base of the bulb.  The kit also comes with 2 sets of color filters.  The bulbs themselves are about 5500K, and the filters are yellow and blue to change the temperature to either roughly 3500K or 6500K, respectively.  I am running them without the filters on and the light is nice and clear, making seeing street signs and objects on the side of the road a lot easier.  I have some Kensun HID Xenons installed in my wife's 2008 Honda Pilot, and they are brighter than the LEDs, but they also require a charge period so when switching between bright and regular lights it takes a few seconds to get to full brightness no matter how long you had them off, as with these LEDs they are at full brightness as soon as they come on.  The bulbs are packaged well, inside of a hard shell box lined with foam with cutouts for each bulb.  The instructions are included, if you need them, but if you have ever installed a regular headlight bulb, you can install these in the same amount of time.  I am planing on purchasing a set of the 9005 for my bright lights in the near future.  I will post some pictures of them running in a few days.if you have ever installed a regular headlight bulb, you can install these in the same amount of time.

B00ECQBRAK|5|How can I get these? It looks like they are not made anymore. My son's girlfriend has one, and I want to buy a few for my daughter and her friends.
B0044U4F08|3|Ve careful it can damage your plastic.<br />(Do not use on Stillen lips!!!)
B00RW1CF4Y|5|great price for a great product.  Easy to use and does the job!
B00EF3SAJQ|5|Great product for the price. Really was sturdy and held my J-hooks great. The rubber footies came off but it's not a big deal. Just there to keep from scratching the top of your car. Not a lot of movement anyway.
B000C57YMK|4|Perfect fit on 1998 explorer xlt
B00M78820I|5|I purchased 3 of these Sun Shades. They arrived quickly. These cover the entire windshield of each of my 3 cars. They are made of a quality material. They fold up easily into a compact case that I keep in the interior of my car. I received a discount for buying 3 of these at the same time. (see discount codes in the Amazon ad)
B00VB2OJLW|5|Was perfect it! my husband loved it!
B0064T4VTW|5|Delivered on time . No directions but I found out how on line.
B008Y8VEMI|5|Yes the seller did a good job .<br />Getting this high dollar part out to me .<br />It look just like the one on the truck.<br />and I got the air-bag light out on the dash.
B009OJ6TXU|4|Does a great job blocking out the elements.  Using the jaw piece takes pratice since you have to be wearing your helmet.  You can't take your helmet on and off with the product attached.
B00N2989V8|2|Drivers cover keeps slipping foreword and the color looked a lot better on the computer. I wouldn't purchase these again.
B001N0984A|1|Broke after very little use
B003XW5VZG|5|Worked really well, 1750 miles on bike without a problem. Would recommend this product!
B00VAVRAYM|5|Great product at a very good price. Excellent fit, went fight on the first time and clear instructions. Saved me about $125 dues to great pricing!! After installation my T-Bird rides like new again,thanks guys
B00192HPOC|5|They fit without any modification but I thought it needed more zip tries to hold them in place.
B00YWBVDWM|4|They are as described but one of them I had to retap one of the pegs and screws are easy to strip out, other than that they my my sled just right
B0046I3I8I|3|does not fit the tire size exactly
B005VPS2UE|3|Good looking light, easy install on my 08 F250, but have some silicone with for install.<br /> It doesn't sit flush on the cab and will leak if you don't seal it up.
B001NAQT7O|5|Fits like a glove and works great. Chrome finish adds to the look of the bike
B00JL6MWIW|5|great price
B00063UO7K|4|Works great
B00062YA58|5|Excellent product and excellent transaction,,, Thanks!!!
B00480J4KA|3|I'm seeing where my account was deducted  $105.93 on August 14th I can't recall purchasing  anything what is this for
B005O7P3Q0|5|In case you don't know, a &#34;MK4&#34; armrest lid is used in the 2007 VW New Beetle, which is what I installed this part in. It works great! Much stouter than the original part, which was badly designed. This remedies that. Very easy to install. Good work, AARodriguez!
B00V5OTZL0|1|Crap
B00QL0Z3Q4|5|Went on easy and looks great!
B00LD1FBJ0|5|I live in md put new cat in and passed emissions<br /><br />Had to modify where it comes into 1 pipe downstream bc my pipe on truck was bent from factory u clamp<br /><br />But it fit well and sounds good<br />Surprised how well it fit thank you<br /><br />We will see how long it lasts have 2 more years until next emissions
B00XZ9OVBC|5|Had no issues dealership programed no problem.
B008YB34FU|1|Needed to use these cables for the first time, went to clip the one on and it came apart spring and all. Put it back together then the other three came apart. These are absolutely junk.
B004W97DGY|5|Lights a great. Screw holes are a little off but so are the stock lights. Would recommend and buy from again!
B00480J4J6|5|Quality bulb at waaayyy less than the auto parts stores. Saved about $250 installing them myself in my wife's Prius. A Youtube video from Luscious Garage shows the simple process of removing fascia and such to gain easy access to nearly impossible headlight pods. It took me about an hour to change both bulbs.
B000VKOD9S|5|This product works well and is easy to install.  You Tube videos will show you the steps in installation.  If your car smells then you need a cabin filter.
B007YZ4EQU|5|I love it!!
B00029CYRG|5|My Rv sits in the California sun when I'm not camping and the the sun here is brutal on a finish. I have tried so may products so so results. I even tried rubbing compound and wax but stilled looked dull and it was a ton of work. I saw this on Amazon and all the good reviews so decided to try it thinking it will just be another so so broduct. Well I was blown away how well it worked. I had heavy oxidation on one side so I tackled that side first. I used a buffer to apply is and then take it off. My filon was like brand new, it shined like a new penny this stuff really works. I highly recommend this for any fiberglass.
B000N32110|4|As advertised.  Very useful in engine removal.
B006VFEJJQ|5|Great battery that fit my 2008 Prius well.  Just go to youtube for directions, it's easy enough, but it does take more time than usual, but to save $150, who wouldn't?
B00B2B97CS|5|I trust these on the circuit a whole lot more than my rubber OEM ones!
B00ZEHDEE8|5|Exactly what I was expecting<br />Arrived in good time
B00KZJQ2L2|5|It fits to Toyota Highlander and works great in Texas!
B00FDX6A6C|5|Easy to work with (using a large razor and a roller) and easy to install. I covered most of my inner and outer door skins when I replaced my speakers, as well as most of the floor of the trunk. The doors feel solid and don't rattle, even when the speakers are pushed hard. It seems like there is less exhaust and road noise from the back, but I can't really be sure. It smells kind of weird (like petroleum) and you probably shouldn't keep it lying around inside your house near your baby once you cut open the package. Definitely need to use a roller when you install to get the best bond.
B00KLBWAJM|5|Loud Nice Price
B00HZY6SBY|5|This is an aluminum tire valve cover that is well made and durable.  Will not split as it's vinyl counterparts do and is very reasonably priced.
B000BNZ7KY|1|I got two sets of mounting brackets that didn't fit and in the wrong shape. Wasted money, however, I reordered another set to get the correct brackets. It should state that when ordering that it indicates 1 pair instead of 1.
B00XWEHQA8|5|AMAZING!<br />You get what you pay for! In this case its excellence. Very bright compared to other reflective tapes I've purchased. Customtaylor tape also doesn't bubble up like other brands either (shown in added picture). Has a unique pattern design that sets it out from the rest, as well as a strong adhesive when applied with a heat gun. (likely still strong with out if you don't own one)<br /><br />This tape is fairly form shaping when applied carefully, creating cool and unique effects upon refraction.<br />I picked up both the sizable rim tape and the body strips.<br />There needs to be more quality reflective tape decals like these.
B007RYMT7O|5|I got this to replace a water pump that died on my house. I have a spring feeding some water tanks that gravity-flow into the house. We got running water from the gravity, but showering was very difficult. I installed this pump yesterday. It took about 3 hours to re-pressurize our lines, but now the shower feels even stronger than it did before! I got an AC-DC converter to make it work off of my standard wall plug. The pump just has red and black wires for power. I can hear it hum when it kicks on, but I can probably de-couple it from my porch so i don't hear the vibrations as much. So far, it's been great. Hope it lasts!
B00OL15D4C|5|I didnt problem with it, the perfect product for car.
B00DSVCC54|5|These were exactly as advertised and were delivered promptly. Installation was rather straightforward - I used the instructions included in the box in conjuction with a very helpful how-to article posted on acurazine.com. They look great and I couldn't be happier with the service and pricing from the seller.
B000N9KFRQ|4|Replace broken unit transome of our boat.  Fit exactly the replaced unit. Very happy with the part.
B00HQZNOQO|5|Fits perfectly in my '01 Passat GLS. I have all-black interior, but the armrest was fabric. The original armrest cover snapped out and this snapped right in (didn't even need a screwdriver). Matches the leather on the dash and shifter/console area as well. Looks much better, matches the leather just fine. The only thing is that it does take some doing to unlatch it once it's latched. I think the latch piece is slightly longer than the original, making it a little harder to open, but it's nothing that a little sanding won't fix.<br /><br />Great for the price, works like a charm.
B007Y5SP7E|5|Fits the qauge perfectly and does the jbo  -- I unintentally dropped gauge and no damage occurred..
B00B7ORHNG|4|Kind of expensive for what it is, but a good investment considering what I spent for the Elite-7 itself.  I don't understand why a sun cover isn't supplied with the Elite-7 in the first place.......or maybe, I do understand but don't like the reason....$$$$.
B000BRJOW2|5|This tank cover really does what we wanted it to! It covers the ugly tanks. It's easy to get on and off. It's nice and snug, no flopping. Easy access to tank even when it's on! If I HAVE to complain, it's only because it's soooo white, it makes the rest of the camper look dingy! :)
B00JA3BMDW|2|Supposed to have a laser pointing light - but it doesn't work.  Still read temp . Too cheaply made to waste more money to returning it!
B003L5WOT6|3|good product
B007LIA8JM|5|Exactly what I expected. It was a little hard to put on, but I think that's pretty standard.
B00T62RK1U|4|great
B0068MWZZW|5|Perfect fit for our Audi Q7.  This is the exact same filter the dealerships use and then charge you $100 for.  With a very small amount of mechanical knowledge and skill you can save yourself several hundred dollars a year by changing your own oil in your Audi.
B00WHCXQ5U|5|just what I wanted, was very happy with this purchase
B00E9I2ZIO|1|Order was late, I got two covers for the base of the seat rather than one for the base and one for the back. Disappointing to say the least.
B0052FRHAO|5|Excellent seller part fit perfect and good price as well.
B00G95K3G6|5|Such a great part an upgrade to your car makes not only a difference but a good performance as well.
B006LJBLHA|5|As described..
B00OABYBJG|4|They are funnels....seriously, how can a funnel not work?
B009DJP57W|5|Worked Great!!!
B000BZEIKW|5|Worked great!
B000IYXKBO|4|Best of a lot of bad choices.  AC Delco has evidently sold it's branding rights to other not GM quality manufacturers.  Not that the original GM pump was that good, it wasn't.  Still it is probably better than most of the Chinese pumps out there.
B000C9S70O|5|works great
B003NHEPEE|5|Good purchase. Does the job & was cheaper than anywhere else that I found.
B00BVL7YVK|5|Great price for this tool.  If you change wheelbearings every single day all day long, the tool may not hold up.  Use the tool in a proper manner and you're going to get many many uses out of it
B00DY68XMY|5|It has been a great investment thus far.
B00MJ44YH0|3|Doesn't fit around the mirror holder in the front, So it pulls off.
B000WKATCM|2|Bad smell that lingers.
B005KOZ25Y|1|Easily gets damage does not working anymore not a good item a waste of money
B00ZFKTJJI|4|pretty nice exhaust,nice sound.comes with two detachable silencers,very easy to take them off.<br />the only con is the inner side of tips seem to have some dust or rust on it as you can see from the pic,probable been in the warehouse for too long<br />I also uploaded a video on youtube so if any of you guys interested,you can have some info before your purchase.<br />the one star off is because the dust or rust(hopefully not)in the tip<br />everything else, sounds awesome,looks not bad.<br />btw,the brand is Godsnow,as shown on the tip
B000C847YU|5|Does what it should
B002WBRRHE|4|Haven't used it yet but seems to be made well
B0050LU2GQ|5|Very Handy!!!! Great way to save wear and tear on hangtag.
B0055DNT50|5|Husband likes tie downs on his pickup.  These are good quality and functional.  Installed on a new Ram truck.
B00F0DNJC8|5|Amazing!
B00W2ALCBW|5|Great size and easy to install.
B009DJRHYQ|5|Cheap price, quick service, excellent
B0007OWD18|5|Great etching primer.  First time I have ever used an etching primer and went on easy and seems to be durable.  Took the main coat of a flat black very well - although the flat black took several coats to completely cover the grey.  Used it on stainless steel after I had roughed up the surface with medium sandpaper.
B00AOTK5L6|5|Work great fits good and looks good used it twice already
B0050DCD9S|1|Screws that came with it are just two broke off in it while installing so i had to drill and tap
B001JT1IWU|5|durable
B004A2WNPY|5|Worked great , Much cheaper than anywhere else to purchase . Thank you
B00342XWVK|5|Works great, good price. Went in to my Lexus IS 350
B0002UNON8|2|Did not work on shallow scratch
B00CQCLDY2|5|The best hitch cover I have ever owned!
B0022XTDQA|5|Worked great .
B009F10S3Y|5|The spoiler for my car was 200 bucks and looked like crap but this stuff is actually pretty dope and looks awesome! I don't know why anyone had any issues
B005KOZ25Y|1|Screen went out within 3 weeks. Used it 5 times. Now a paperweight on my desk.
B001IH8Q0K|5|Nice package of three...my others rusted...good replacement
B00SLKPZHY|5|Good fit, good price.
B007XZK79Y|1|Didn't fit this product sucks witch theyed reimburse me !! Do not bye s***t product
B005T21LG6|5|great. Cigarette smell went away
B00ESNUJME|5|The install is kind of a pain (due to design of the bike) but once you get through it you will love it. Awesome design and they fit perfectly flush. The programmable features are also a huge plus too.
B00BLPPVRA|5|This is going to be one of my favorite riding jackets. Awesome fit
B0068EVKII|5|Great replacement speakers.  Installation couldn't be easier and the sound quality is far superior to stock. I have hearing problems and even with the treble turned up all the way on stock speakers I had a hard time understanding the news stations.  Not with these speakers.  The mid-range and treble is great and voices are crystal clear. Of course, rock'in out with the oldies is great too! I used to turn up the volume to 14 at highway speeds, now all I need is 10-12 so there is far less distortion.  A bit expensive, but if you use your radio a lot it is well worth the investment.
B00NEL6P56|4|easy to install
B00CPD5FQO|5|high quality tool at a fair price with an &#34;unconditional lifetime warranty&#34; from Carquest, whats not to love?
B00WFHXAW6|2|Got this and thought it was something that just pluged into the wasting harness but after getting it realized that you had to use theses wire clips that actually cut into the installation of the wire which I dislike because it causes problems later with your wiring and corrosion as well as weaking your wires.  So I wish they would of stated that in the description would of saved alot of time.
B004SS8UUM|5|Neat little keychain
B00D5CGFTU|5|Hi, I don't write reviews unless something is more than what I aspect for what I paid for. This starter is something better than the starter that came new on one of my simplicity tractors. It turned over the engine stronger than I could imagine possible.
B00042K39C|5|Best fog lights right price good quality
B004SG5566|5|Good quality product.
B00Y5GM7D8|5|Yes they give my car really agressive look
B00DOS0LQI|4|Short and sweet, I deducted one star for the packaging.  It would be nice if the packaging was designed for re-use.  It may be user error, but I have problems with it sticking and slight peeling after the initial use.  If someone responds and says that's typical or normal, I'll update.
B00CPL7D16|1|Advertising is for 2 lights, but you only get 1
B00JIEX722|5|Very bright and white LEDs! Easy install. Works great
B00FIX7KHA|1|It only work for a month. ....this product sucks......!!!!!!
B00065L2D8|5|good for the money!!!!!
B000XQ9MGE|1|I bought this 3 years ago. Used it once. Now it's completely dead.
B00FQ0ROZS|5|Bright little lights mounted them on the top of my back rack I ordered two sets 4 face to the front 4 face the rear of my truck and they are so bright. Couldn't be happier
B0018EVFL0|5|I really like the style and features.  The baggage appears to be well made.  It fit the luggage rack on my HD Ultra perfectly.  Good value for the features.
B003RX0X8G|5|Purchased this for my Mother replacement from the dealership was expensive, this option is so much better, customer service was also great. Will be back!
B009YRI64C|5|Great price
B008W3IU8G|5|Works flawlessly and the trailer pulls so much better
B0045WBVUM|5|good product at a great price
B00Y5H3O2K|1|The holes do not line up and the bolts are too large, see attached pics.<br /><br />It is a generic set of tow hooks, so only use if you have a generic car :)
B00IWQH64M|5|This kit cures the broken factory plastic piece...the way it should have come from the factory.
B000N9PG9I|5|Fit as anticipated, fixed the problem
B00P810UJ2|5|Received my sunshade within the days amazon promised. I was impressed!
B008376XG2|5|Perfect
B001OMKGNE|5|Exactly what I wanted!
B007ZSKWK8|4|fits but not perfect. I got it for half the price and within a few hours it was back to $80. There is a slight gap but it's nothing to cry about.
B0006MQJ2U|5|I bought this aaa road kit for my son as he is a new driver for Christmas. I love it, it has so much stuff in it and I could buy it all at once. it fits great in his trunk of his car so its not loose in the back seat flying around.  I would recommend this to parents with new drivers because it has a lot of the things you would buy for the car as an emergency kit plus more and its more affordable.
B00VNJ4RQK|1|Is NOT universal. Does not fit on my 2011 Jeep Liberty
B004AINWHG|5|Fits just like the original and is easy to install. The worst part is getting the old sensor out and cleaning the mounting hole/surfaces for the new sensor.
B00V56OYX2|5|very good quality
B009UKUURO|5|Works as advertised.  Random orbital feature helps to prevent damage to finishes.  Long cord should be standard.
B00HRSTJNW|5|Worked great. Very stylish and bright. It gives my blue Ridgeline a great look and I feel great knowing I will probably never have to replace these lights in my truck again. LEDs  are awesome!
B00080QGYG|2|It should have been stated that this item will not fit all jacks.  Any jack that does not have a clear opening after jack pad has been removed, will not work with this adapter.  Must be able to accept the &#34;pin base&#34; of the adapter.
B005Z8HAUK|5|Everything as described.
B00ONHT4D0|5|Fits perfectly in my Impala LS 2008
B000M5YYIW|3|Good assortment, good value
B00HZBABHY|5|Very nice. Colorful.
B007OXCJFA|4|it's okay!
B006A0DXXK|5|One of the best JDM stickers I've bought so far. It stuck on and never came off even through the crazy weather we get down in Florida!
B0000CBIK5|4|Great
B000EGAM0I|5|A friend told me about MotorKote. He had been trying it for months. I watched some videos on line and thought &#34;what the heck. Let's try it!&#34;. Anyway, I have 5 kids and 4 driving. Their cars have higher miles (100,000 plus) so I put it all of them. 2 oz per quart of oil, good for 4 oil changes. That's enough for 5 cars, 4 oil changes. That means you are paying less than about $1.50 per oil change. I had it in a 2003 intrepid my son was driving. The coolant bleeder valve cracked and he lost most of his coolant and all pressure. The car was driven for a couple days at the start (short trips) and almost ten miles when we realized what happened. I nearly scrapped the car, thinking the engine was probably wiped. Heads cracked... Block cracked... Etc. I decided to change the bleeder assy out since it was 40 bucks and take a chance that by some grace of God the MotorKote just might actually work. You can probably tell where this is going. I got it changed, added almost 2 gallons of coolant, (yes- 2 GALLONS) bled the air, and it fired right up! We have now put another 20,000 miles on the car since this all happened. Motorkote goes in all my cars now. Snake oil? Doubtful. Maybe it was all just a coincidence, but I'll take that chance for $1.50. Watch the videos on YouTube. You'll be amazed!
B00DC5TV0A|5|Just bought ramps for my lifted truck. I have KFX 700 quad. Wanted to wait until I actually used ramps, to leave helpful review. Ramps are super light and easy to setup and put away. Very solid and stable. Because my truck has metal rail on tailgate and is lifted, I had to hook tiedown straps up a bit higher closer to tailgate, because ramps slipped up, once straps tightened. Easy fix. Just used foam seal tape on underside of ramps where tailgate and ramp meet, for friction.
B004W4OREU|5|veey nice lights
B00EMOA988|5|Really liked the tubal cane decal , Jason Richmond tx look real good Thanks.
B00QIT8Y50|4|Was missing window for gear selector.
B000ALBZA8|3|not a spray wash just  touch up paint.
B0053NNG2I|5|This X-Grip was exactly what I was looking for to hold my Droid Turbo smartphone in my truck.  It uses the smaller &#34;Snap-Link&#34; ball system which works great.  It firmly holds my phone in place, no slipping or worry about it falling out.  The &#34;Snap-Link&#34; ball system holds the mount/smartphone vertically which is how I have it most of the time, but it's easy to rotate it to landscape orientation for when I want to use GPS/Navigation on my phone.  RAM offers this mount using their standard 1&#34; ball system, which has more arm/base/mounting options, but I wanted something a little more compact, this isn't quite as compact as I had hoped, but it'll work just fine for what I need.  With my phone, this mount does require both hands to load/unload my phone, but I don't have to worry about it falling out.  If you have a narrower device, you might be able to load/unload your device single handed.  Overall I am very happy with this product.
B00E9ANSGU|5|doesn't over heat on heave amp draw
B00P2D3VZG|4|I bought the USED version of these and it arrived in a package that had been opened. No surprise. I always test any bulbs I am about to use by checking their continuity with a Volt/Ohm meter. These particular LED bulbs DO NOT show continuity. I also found that they are sensitive to polarity. You CANNOT put them in either way. The right side requires the power (See picture). So, if it doesn't work one way, rotate 180 degrees and try it the other way. Once it is in, it is extremely hard to get out. DO NOT grab it by the bulb or it will come off. Use a pair of pliers and grab it by the base.
B00AKKGJD2|4|This net fits well and works well.
B0041TLKSM|5|Perfect
B00B1UYSEW|5|Fit my 2002 S10 perfectly. Also, fit my new 2004 S10 perfectly as well.
B00JY6BJA6|1|Not what I was expecting. Possibly my fault for not reading the description but I thought it would be more than than paper
B00BJK04Y2|4|Nice accessory, subtle upgrade.  Took a while to receive it.
B00AEC7C5A|4|Easy to install.  Looks good and is functional.  Could appear to be a bit more luxury, but I am satisfied.
B003LK2GNU|2|Way smaller than advertised (5&#34; NOT 9&#34;) - still waiting for reply from company.
B005D5T6C0|4|Very Bright Light<br />I am so impress by them. Will definitely buy again from them.
B0009V1WSE|5|Item as describe
B000GOG3HO|4|Seems to be working well in my 1999 Ford Taurus. Seems about the same power and sound level as the old original blower. Installed fine. I docked a star as there was no gasket or seal. Would have been nice if there was some sort of gasket included.
B0000AXPDU|1|The keys do not unlock the lock!
B001DICGI2|5|Works wonderful. Thank you for everything g
B006V6AUF2|5|Great visor clip for the price!  Just as good if not better than expensive brands.  I would definitely recommend.
B00KTIUG5C|5|Worked great. About 10 seconds to program. Looks just like oem.
B00CNEQZHS|5|Easy to install. Fit perfect. Works like a charm. AND delivered a day early.
B000JZN0CQ|1|I bought it because it claimed it fit my 2003 corolla. Filter is too wide for air box. It says right on the box, FORD filter, not toyota.
B004I0H86C|5|Fits perfectly and for those who are whining about installation there is a video on how to install it on youtube. It came in 3 days before the expected time so that's a BONUS.
B00CD2RH4U|5|good product
B004ZF4L2O|5|Best addition I have made to my 4 runner to date.  I recommend these lights to anyone wanting to get away from their stick bulbs. Plug and play!
B001534XCC|4|good deal
B001AVVY7G|5|fits honda cfr50 front sprocket stock is 14 tooth. This sprocket will make you gain top speed but lose low end torque.
B001KS2PYK|5|Fit perfect
B00HZX4OPM|3|Not as bright as Oracles. Plus, it doesn't seat well no matter how much i bend the tabs therefore causing it to flicker at times which is annoying. Product could be better. 2010 challenger srt8.
B005V9ORF4|4|They are great lights. The connector port didn't fit great so I had to modify it slightly. Great lights
B004RIUZ4M|3|The material is ok. Expected better quality from the description.
B0082OYG3I|5|aok
B00LIZALL4|5|Very bright lights, very simple to wire in. I wired them directly to the relay for my fog lights and they are brighter than my headlights. Like I said very bright and very white lol.
B0064IU5FW|5|This tuner works great and was delivered in just a few days from the purchase date. I purchased it for a F150 Ecoboost at a great price from Amazon. It made a HUGE difference in performance with the 93 octane tune.
B011Q18D14|5|instructions are easy, i got a manual in my package and it helps a lot. it will save me a ton of time and now i dont have to driVe over 20 miles to the nearest autozone and be stressed about breaking down or blowing up my truck on the way there. I drive a 97 nissan hardbody Xe 2wd 4cyl. It reads the codes perfectly and the manual has them listed with the description.
B000GVBMDC|5|good
B006GJOCFI|1|These do not fit a stock Jeep JK trackbar! Had to return them and spent the extra money in an adjustable HD trackbar instead
B004AE0DRC|5|They worked great for one week, then car was totaled!
B008SANL5A|5|Cool looking lanyard, still using it
B00826OVWW|3|A little wonky going together. Few minor adjustment so it will open and close propery
B00150P0OA|1|I bought all 4 scents, squash is the best. Did not like this one at all, reminds me of medicine.
B005CLQ3RQ|1|This is a very cheap replacement part. It broke within 2 years.  It had a very thin handle plastic that would bend up more on the right than the left, and it eventually broke completely.  I've replaced it with the PT Auto Warehouse TO-3951A-TG - Tailgate Handle (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BITR8WU?psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o00_s00) which is actually cheaper and feels like it is higher quality.  Time will tell.  Don't waste your time or money on this.
B009DJ2UA2|5|On a 96 paseo, have a quicker throttle response with this filter. 60% cheaper than k&n! A must buy for any engine.
B00SW80FF2|5|Great product, easy transaction. AAA!
B004PILLZG|1|Product didn't hold up to the heat. Came off engine cowling and made an absolute mess of my RV engine bay and components.
B00B8X1CXM|5|springs great, fit perfect and fast service
B00WHHAFPE|5|Hey guys how you doing this Tank it is nice it's really light weight The money you pay for it it's worth it I recommend to anybody who's looking for 5 gallon tank
B00KTIAREM|1|The programming instructions are very clear, and both appeared to pair to the truck OK along with the original remote.  After that, only the original worked, the two new ones did nothing.  Tried it again, same result.  Guess I can't expect knockoff stuff to work, you would think I would learn and stop wasting time shipping junk back to amazon for a refund.
B00LNJI1KI|4|was longer than stated in description but made it work
B00U0AA5FU|5|Perfect fit and arrived quickly.
B00QZHWDD4|5|Absolutely loved my patches! Quick turn around. Great but!!!!
B00199IGWU|4|Yea thanks worked out great!

B006V7TCAK|5|KC has always been a reliable brand for me and these were no different.
B00777S8LC|2|Oh My God!  What a product description!!  I think I became insane half way thru reading it.  Lol.
B00N2CQDU4|5|Absolutely loved them! They're so nice, stylish, & such a great price!
B004GEYHGY|5|The fit was good and looks exactly like the original. Came with bulbs too.
B001P2H4U6|5|Looks great and fits great on my 2008 Toyota Tundra. Initially, I thought I installed it crooked, but it turned out that my bumper is crooked.
B0056OFWVM|5|Very good for motorcycles. No strap flapping and scratching your bike.
B00JMQHUM4|5|Great
B00DI3DV6G|5|These are great for car trunks. They don't slide around. They are very well made and really help organize the trunk.
B00042KG3A|5|nufff said
B00JMUKIHO|3|I have mixed feelings about this antenna. On one hand it is incredibly easy to install, it took me less than 5 minutes on my Miata, but it is also not very good at picking up stations.<br /><br />The antenna itself is very sleek and modern. It also says Mazdaspeed on it, but I have doubts on how long that will hold up as the paint seems very cheap. Even if it were to wash off the antenna would still look sharp.<br /><br />After installing I lost about half the radio stations I had previously. The stations I lost were all over the band as well, high frequencies, low frequencies, and even mid range ones.<br /><br />One final comment, I bought two of these and they were different styles. The one I put on my car had a rounded top, but the one we put on my friend's car had a flat top.
B00030LM54|5|Good product to hitch trailer by yourself
B001V8U12M|4|Works great in my drill, wish it would work in my smaller cordless.  Maybe one day they will change the shaft to one similar to the bits that fit most guns....
B007Q1AE6Q|5|Nice fitting OE quality part.  It can be programmed to the PCM without a computer, do a Google search on how.
B001FC34JQ|5|Came as advertised
B00VAVU47M|4|everything went on good and rides much better
B007137D2W|5|Easy to install and affordable. Not made of cheap, brittle plastic like certain other products.
B00XXLZ2EM|5|I am loving these Zeroedge Detailing Towels by Autofiber. You get a pack of 5 in the set and they are 16&#34; 16&#34; each. These are great for dusting furniture, cleaning windows and glass, polishing and so much more. I have been using them for dusting and cleaning windows and I have to say, they do not leave any lint behind and my windows are not streaked afterwards. I just dampened the cloth a little bit and then washed the window.  They are real soft and you can actually fold them in 4 and use them all many times before needing to wash by using a different size. They wash up very well in the washer. Definitely loving these and would highly recommend!<br />**I received this product with a promotional discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. No compensation for a positive review was provided. All of my reviews are based 100% off of my experience with the product and I never guarantee a positive review.
B00KTJ664Q|5|good product!
B000Q753B8|5|This item was purchased as a gift for my father that travels between two homes hundreds of miles apart. Haven't heard any complaints so I'm assuming this product works great!  Not having to add ice is a major plus. Also not worrying about water leaking is why I decided to purchase this!  Happy father - great purchase!
B004W6IU32|4|These are good quality aftermarket. Almost fit as good as factory. Four stars because one of the tabs that locks the bulb socket in place was broken off when it arrived. Lenses are nice and clear
B00HJEGQQ2|1|Junk, Does not blink and wont stay in!!!!
B00EAG9VPA|1|CRAP! Ignore the 5 star rating. I've recently bought things based on 5 stars that turned out to be crap.<br />These have plastic threads that strip out even when just gently tightening by hand.
B003WZX7UA|4|These are good. They've worked every time so far. Just a little bit wobbly with a bit of side twist. But nothing major. I'd have liked them even more if they were a bit stiffer. But definitely worth the price. Probably going to buy another set for my home garage tool box.
B00H91DE3I|5|All is good!
B0063CU5CM|5|Installed on a 2014 Access Cab Tacoma with no problem.  I did not use the clear 3M tape because I was concerned about the tape doing something to the finish of the hood. Also, I wash my truck once in a while and I  figured I would just take that tape off in the first wash.  The Bugflector only touches the underside of the hood.  I preferred the metal screws and swapped out the 2 plastic screws for metal.  It has been on there for a while, catching bugs, no vibration and it looks good.  I would buy it again.
B0045YNLO4|5|Great Paint for my car grill. Couldn't find any locally so I bought from Amazon.
B001A6PTW2|4|Outstanding bards, sitting on one of my 1972 CZ vintage motocrosser.
B000BZN9H0|5|These wheel earring assemblies fit a 2001 Dakota 4wd no abs time sensor perfectly.  Runs smooth no noise at all.  Shipped via Amazon Prime.  Great vendor.
B000CFCV50|5|It fits on my 2000 Nissan altima.  Thanks
B000H0RDB2|5|excelente
B000LG5ZM6|5|Worked fine, recommended to 2 other people. Saved a lot of money....
B000C6ZY7G|5|Fit my Jeep 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo.
B000WP6QLK|5|Works perfectly.  Hopefully I won't have to review how they perform as sliders.
B000BQWLE6|3|to small
B006X98A7C|5|Perfect fit, arrived on time, and intact.
B00269X8PC|5|Fit peefect
B00QAMKNYK|5|what I needed
B002BG4WX2|5|Amazing product.  I lost my ac last summer.  Once the warm weather hit I turned on the ac, and it just blew hot air.  I had it recharged, and within a day it was back to hot air.  Took it back to same place, they recharged again, and put some dye in it to find the leak.  Same thing, hot air the next day, and they could not find the leak in the engine bay. That told them that it must be behind my dash, probably the evaporator, and the quote was 1200-1500 to fix.  I then took it to another shop for a second opinion as I was shocked at the expense quoted.  Same results, they evacced the system, recharged with dye, and nothing showing in engine bay, but no cold air next day.  At that point I gave up and drove all summer without ac.  This summer I did some research and found red angel.  I figured it was worth a shot, but did not get my hopes up as my leak was BAD.  To my amazement I followed instructions, added red angel with ac on high, then added coolant to the correct pressure, and here I am a month later with Ice cold ac!!!!!!  Saved me alot of money, and I am comfortable again.  If you have a costly ac leak behind dash, give it a try, this stuff works!!!!
B001TI5IIQ|4|Definitely improved my fogged over and cloudy headlights and I can see much better now on dark roadways.  The process was pretty easy and only took about 40 minutes total (even with my taking time to mask off the car around the lights).  The lenses are not perfect but they are pretty darn good now.  I can see better and the car looks less aged.  It was kind of hard to tell when to stop with the abrasive pads because it is hard to see the progress once you get a slurry on the lens but you can kind of feel the difference as the clouded portion is removed.  Some other systems that use a drill or power tool to do the polishing might work a little better and be easier, but it really isn't hard to do and  it is hard to go wrong for under $10.  Definitely worth a try if your headlights are clouded over.
B005IGRNPQ|5|Nice fit so far very pleased
B006SDHSTE|5|Perfect fit
B00FW1JP9O|5|Still working...brightest interior I've ever had, and provides light outside the vehicle around the base within 5 feet. Cool Mod...
B00D8DR0AO|5|good product
B007KA7PP6|4|Works as advertised.  Works better than those that the gears are made of hard plastic.  Would recommend as long as gears are metal.
B004B8GTQG|1|do not buy, this will solve the creaking rubber noise for about 3 weeks, then it will much worse. your would constantly sqeak and cream when this is dried. I did this to my Lexus just as a precaution. my god what a mistake I am not able to find anything to get this out. I am trying to apply grease as a last resort before I trade it in.
B00230QIYC|1|Not what shows in picture just a white peice of plastic nothing specail
B00C2M4HMG|5|I installed these on my 2015 GC Overland.  They look great.  Installation is straightforward.  The quality of the cross bar is excellent.
B000C39BUK|5|Excelente producto
B00EJFH6YA|5|Awesome light bar! Super bright and comes in real handy on the country roads I travel. I use them as the Hi-beams as often as possible, and for getting those last few strips of grass mowed!
B00SIDJO8K|3|This product was installed on a 2014 Toyota RAV4 with less than 7K miles.  On the positive side; the bulbs installed easily and provide great illumination as fog lights.  On the negative side, the seal is not water tight like the OEM bulbs, therefore, moisture has invaded both fog light housings. And, to ensure it wasn't an installation issue, I removed both bulbs, cleared the moisture and re-seated.  The result is that moisture continues to accumulate in both fog lamp housings.  I will be removing this product over the weekend and returning for a refund...or, not...as I just read that the Return Window closed on Aug 3.  I bought this product on June 30 and installed in mid-July. It has been very dry in NC over the summer to the point of water restrictions.  Only recently has it begun to rain and the issue with this product was exposed.  Oct 12, 2015: I upgraded to the current three (3) stars due to the fact that the SNGL Customer Service folks promptly contacted me to resolve the issue after I posted my review.  The final result was that they, SNGL, provided me a refund for their product which I consider an appropriate gesture.
B00KTJ7U3M|4|Very good and cheap
B003CEFJ2U|5|I installed them and the jack and haven't worried about it since.  Haven't needed the jack, thankfully, but it is very sturdy and hasn't come loose one bit.
B00VSQAQC2|5|My husband loves this as it has all ready paid for itself.  He was able to fix the check engine light without having to go to our repair shop.
B0082OU772|5|gift for a freind
B00843WHB0|5|Very good non skid. Have it on my tuna tower.
B004I1GL50|4|Good but it obviously needs pockets inside to hold a large wallet or large cell phone.
B00IO12YZQ|1|These lights are HORRIBLE.  Immediately, when I got them one of them almost fell apart while installing,  So I popped it back together and it was working, so I thought, eh, it works it will be OK.  Not so.  A day later one side stopped working, but once again. eh, they are still bright, as long as the rest work.  AND!!!!! Sure enough complete malfunction, when the DRLs come on, they light for 30 seconds then go very dim.  I tested the socket, its getting power, I put the other LED in the socket.  It was very functional. switched the other LED to a known working socket. Same thing occurred with same LED.  Well, I say that you get what your pay for, but in this case, don't pay for it.  They didn't last 3 weeks.  Do yourself a favor and spend a little bit more and get something that is quality.
B00U0UWQ2A|5|Perfect and incredibly deal for the cost!!
B000X5MW3K|5|I bought this kit for my 95 YJ.  It came with everything I needed to replace my old soft top hardware.  This kit also included everything I needed to replace the framework above the door and to the sides of the windshield.  I did have one of the button snaps above the door break, but honestly with a YJ this is just part of life.  I normally keep about 5 extra in the glove box.  Overall I'm pleased at the improvement this made on my jeep.  The 20 year old hardware was definately due for replacement.
B000FQ7C0A|3|The knobs do not come off of these and can't be switched out. One the of the end pulled off after installing. But the mechanism is a bit rusted. Still didn't expect it to break
B004ULZ56Y|2|I can't use them because they cover up too much of the license plate.
B00B2B4OE4|5|I had this life kit for over 6 months and let me say this! This lift kit is awesome! They come with every part you need to lift your jeep and they let me have extra bolts and nuts so if I lost that bolt or anything it comes in spares. This lift kit was so easy to install it took me all day but by reading there instructions and looking at the pic it couldn't be easier! When u get that lift kit on and you get in your driver seat you can notice that your pretty tall compare to the stock Jeep Cherokee. There's other parts that I recommend getting is a SYE ( Slip Yoke Eliminator ) with a brand new drive shaft in the rear. And you need to get Shackle Relocation because when u have you lift on your rear of your jeep will lean so it would be good to get those to so you jeep stands straight with the lift kit and it lifts your jeep in the rear. So those are the things I recommend with this lift kit! But anyways get this lift I highly recommend it!
B001GF5EQI|4|Fits my windshield perfectly, and does the job of keeping the car cool, especially since I have leather seats. It is a bit awkward to roll up and store, however. One little velcro tab is not enough to keep this rolled up. It refuses to stay closed, and so I'm resorted to using an elastic band to roll up and store it. Otherwise, it works great, and that's really what is most important for me.
B000C2S9BI|5|Perfect fit!
B00B32DD5S|5|great product installed just as said, no problem. On my 2015 chev. 2500hd. it said I would have drill frame to install around my 5th. wheel side brackets but I didn't have to, the U bolts fit over frame and brackets with no problem. I have curt 24000 5thwheel with the standard no drill mounting system.
B0065MWHSK|5|what i needed
B0013V6M7U|5|great
B00A7EQ7LK|5|AAAA++++
B00IX26X12|4|I had to bend them a little to make them fit. I wish they didn't sit so tall on the cab but other than that no complaints
B007TNCD1K|1|Excessive electrical noise through radio. Strobing lights at idle. Inconsistent charging output. JUNK.
B000CIOWCM|5|Fit my 1993 Jeep YJ perfectly. Great replacement and no issues so far.
B000EDOT8C|2|There is a clear repair in this cutting board - it's a circle 'plug' that doesn't match the rest of the wood grain. I called Camco and they tell me this is how they make repairs when putting them together. Why then isn't it sold as a factory second?  The rep told me I probably won't see that again if I order another one. But - it's a hassle that they sell the repaired products as new - means time and effort of a return for both Amazon and the customer. Lame, Camco. We'll see how the replacement is.
B00GKMWF5A|1|Item was bent and useless.  Thank for NOTHING, Amazon.
B000EW0KPY|4|does the job
B0015CGSGC|5|They fit and worked as described. I even replaced one that wasn't broken so they would all be the same.
B000GL19WG|5|Can't promise it works until I remove the spark plugs in the future. But was easy to apply and I can assume it works.
B001J7M4QG|5|We needed a Loud Air horn added to our Rescue Truck at the Fire Deoartment and we came across this one and got it, needless to say we are very pleased with it it's very very loud and clears read ice well
B011P30EMO|5|Great tool.  Paid for itself within 15 minutes out of the box.  Hesitated getting the newest version without reviews.  Glad I went for it.  Dynamic graphics on sensors is very helpful.
B00CZ5FH4C|1|Mismatched
B001EA0LJK|5|Great item
B009S7I96I|5|Product arrived promptly and appears to be a quality product. The fit was perfect.<br />Would definitely buy again. Significantly cheaper than the price I was quoted by my local RV dealer.
B00SAAW8Y8|5|Awesome thanks!
B0041WH74U|5|Look great! I have a silver truck, so they even look better. Twist Back up bulb in. Pull your bulb on top socket, plug these bad boys in, twist it in place and put bolts back in. On your way!
B004O844EM|5|There is no reason to spend $500 on a carrier. This one is fantastic.
B00DQU9Z3Y|4|Very good but cover was too big, but still protects car from sun. Maybe they need to Supply tie down cords!
B00KJ8JF18|5|Awesome. Love the color especially at night
B0002SRGW0|5|Coupled with the OTC 7249 'kit', this made changing out the ball joints in my Dana 30 a breeze.
B005GM9F6M|3|You get what you pay for with these. I bought these to replace my old ones and the driver side did not come with an area for pedal wear. The carpet quality is like that on the floors of the car. My old set where thicker and of a barber carpet material. These are thinner and has cut ends.
B00S1NT2SE|5|Great response. Just what I needed.
B00062YRNI|3|great pricing
B006QH6XQG|5|Great Battery good service would buy again
B002UCYRZU|3|I am sure it works great on clear plastics but I purchased this to fix my expensive sunglasses and it ruined them. It took the finish off and now they are trash. You live and learn. Disclaimer should be listed clearly
B00XHNBQPK|5|Good quality product. Have not used yet.<br />It looks good in the back of my car<br />and ready to use.
B009DK1QYM|3|Bought for a 2002 F150 Supercrew.  The fit was not exact, though pretty close.  I discovered that I had some dents in my bumper that prevent it from being a better fit.  That notwithstanding, the included hardware rusted over within 2 weeks and I am worried might not hold up as well as my stock unit (which was damaged by the previous owner of the truck and I replaced).  Only time will tell how well it holds up, but if I need to replace it in the future, I will probably buy a different one.
B000QZ6JF4|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B00A3NAAXQ|2|I thought the &#34;LIFE IS GOOD&#34; would be etched in the metal. Instead it's just a sticker on a metal frame. I could have done this. Not very happy. I will change my review if the thing last a year.
B00KCCT17O|2|very thin fuild.
B00UME0KPO|4|A touch more expensive than I wanted to pay, but does the job quite nicely on my 1996 Road King
B007JEJQP0|5|Nice product! The fit was perfect and the installation was easy. The Curt online video was a big help. I would recommend this to anyone.
B006GFU3RI|5|way better than what you'd pay at an actual shop. Be a badass on a budget
B002JC7AI2|5|PERFECT MATCH FIT LIKE A GLOVE , SHIPPING WAS QUICKER THAN EXPECTED.
B008QBTLDW|5|This is a must for &#34;vertically challenged&#34; (short) people. I use this to keep the shoulder belt off my neck. Just be careful when you undo the seat belt because this has a tendency to come off the seat belt and fall out of the car.
B00C5RB03W|5|Fit snugly to my camper bumper and keep wasps out.
B007Z8VG30|5|Very nice. Need to order another since I sold the car I put it on.
B00ANWH5NK|1|VERY CHEAP MADE !
B00XPL88NC|5|The gauge arrived promptly, was well packed and worked as advertised. The hose is a bit longer than I expected so it takes a little more glove compartment space than I expected, but that isn't a fault of the gauge just my reading the details. Even received a nice email from the company thanking me for the purchase. My other daughter just might get one too!
B00ZQ5M340|5|Awesome
B00M0CQD9S|5|We're  very very  Happy with the product our  2014 High Country feels  the same
B00063X38M|5|a great product. it will glue almost any thing. i keep a tube in stock and re-order when it gets low.
B00G620ZVU|5|The fog lights have not done me wrong yet. No moister in the Lights. Just to keep this from possible happening, I tightened down all the existing screws a bit.
B00GKRQ7DG|2|A lot smaller than expected definitely to small for a car decal
B00144D77E|5|Just what I wanted and was easy to install
B0044A20HS|5|Essential if you work on your old vw. Limited info online about certain aspects of these cars. Bentleys are superior to Chilton/Haynes and worth the money.
B00FDQPCR2|5|GOOD!
B00S58V56W|5|perfect fit
B00W2OSK7C|5|Fit perfectly and look great. Cargo mat showed up too, and very quickly at that.
B005R12D16|5|Excellent. Easy installation.
B00REJXGME|1|It took extra time to be delivered and had 2 holes in the cover. We couldn't just return it, we had to take pictures to be approved for a return or rebate. Who has time for all that?
B00AN8LY2M|5|Looks great. Helps with the wind shielding as its supposed to. Made my bike look much nicer as well.
B00CHFN0P8|5|Installed it on my 2006 Chrysler Town and Country Touring. First off, this fits both the 113 and 119 inch wheelbases, even though Amazon says it doesn't. The product is great, combined with the monroe self adjusting struts in the rear that are also commonly purchased, my vans handling has increased substantially. Much less body roll, more responsive, and the ride is even a bit better than before. This is how the van should have came from the factory, it was a great price and buy, I highly recomend
B001U6DMSK|3|Back top cover does not fit at all
B00KONM7OK|5|My poor keys are worn to the point I can not tell which button is which. Perfect fit and I love the color.
B001B80CX0|5|I actually bought mine new off Craigslist but these things are AWESOME.  I got a matching pair for left and right sides of the bed. Prior to install, I kept a large rolling case in the truck with all my tools, lubricants, grease, tools, etc (I run a tractor business) and these things solved the problem in a great way. They are no wider than the wheel well humps so it doesn't keep anything from sliding into the bed that wouldn't otherwise have.<br /><br />One thing - I had to move the rear cargo tiedown points in my Tundra so I relocated the tie down points just above the top of the Swing Case in a reinforced point on the bed.<br /><br />Highly recommended item!
B005NLQAHS|4|Works great but only does basic odb2 error msg codes and clearing code. Has diagnostics feature but limited using free app
B003VY1P4W|5|exceeded my expectations for a 350.00 seat
B00P9U2J64|5|Excellent product! Surprising difficult to juggle all the bolts during assembly, but once it's in place, it adds a lot to the looks of your bike.
B000FQ23JK|5|Have a 1988 Jeep YJ, The bolt holes line up Perfectly with the Body, The Bolts that are needed to attach it to the body are not included so make sure you save your old ones!<br />The Spring System is quite strong and it seems very well made. Does not stay down while filling fuel but no big deal there!<br />Perfect replacement part that is well made and fits like a glove!!
B000SBCHCA|1|Cable is wired backwards from end to end, that is, slot 1 comes up on pin 8, slot 2 comes up on pin 7, etc. Not worth postage to send back.
B00MBNOHW6|1|Wasn't the right size!
B00FP0LHA2|1|It is not a &#34;Belkin&#34; cable, it is just a cheap cable.
B007JJBVOY|5|Fit perfect and had all the right electrical connectios
B0042XI3D2|5|I got it so nice,  the don't have any in the country antigua
B000E2CVIS|5|Went on easy & will be as easy to take off
B0044AB7WM|5|part was in great condition when I received it.
B00PGH5SLS|5|This is exactly what I was looking for. The fob for my CX-5 fits perfectly.
B00HRHWHNW|5|Looks to be good quality.  This is a special need product that isn't used often.
B011P4DQBY|3|I have used 3 types of wax so far including this car wax spray and I'm not satisfied with the result I got from JoyRide car wax. I have used another spray wax which was far better than this one as the other spray does not need pre-wash and it automatically lift the stains & dusts, all I had to do was wipe it off and buff it gently for a glossy finish and also had a nice smell. JoyRide does not lift off the stains, neutral smell and also it needs a pre-wash I think. I know JoyRide does not promise all the above mentioned features but I honestly want to compare 2 products of same kind. It did not give a glossy finish on my dark blue nissan altima.  I got this product at a discounted price for my honest testing and review. It does justify for its discounted price but I would not buy this product on its original price as its way overpriced for its features. If you found my review helpful, please click the yes button below.
B00Z7KIZPA|2|The tension cord (string cinch under the center console) doesn't stay tight, loosens almost immediately, and allows items placed on the center console to slide back into the back seat.  There should be a more secure means of anchoring the &#34;purse pouch&#34; in place.  The string tension cord under the center console lid is useless.  The product is also a bit small to span the distance between bucket seats in a full size truck.
B000CQSQNU|5|worked good exactly what I needed.
B00ARYTBFY|3|Got these to put under the hood of aquarium, it's humid under there I realize, backing didn't stay stuck to it, it does say waterproof, also wires are kinda short
B00IT6O5F8|5|Much cheaper than the Chevy dealer wanted 89.65 installed takes 15 min to install watch u tube
B000HZT89C|4|Opening is odd but other than that it is a nice addition to my vehicle plus I like the tissue box!
B007FHHEVO|4|Seems to be a really good product and feels strong
B00TA5ECJQ|5|Change your lawnmower oil with no mess. Run the mower for 10 min to warm up the oil and suck the oil out in mins
B000BOALF4|1|Fell off first time through the car wash.
B0087NAWYQ|1|I had my unit for 1.5yrs. I tried to return it a week after purchasing.  Sena said I could not because it was used goods. It was considered non returnable because I installed it in my helmet using the provided stickers that were not reusable.<br /><br />Anyway, the reason I wanted to return it was because it was I not able to hear music when my bike reached speeds above 60mph (which is usually my entire ride).<br /><br />Now a year and a half later with minimal use the left speaker has went out. It's suppose to have a 2 year warranty so I'm going to check to see how Sena handles this. Hopefully I'll get a replacement so that I can sell this piece of crap for half of the asking price.
B00CL2H32I|5|Excellent product great quality
B007EZ37XQ|5|Shipped quickly. Works as promised.
B00OYEBRRS|5|Nice axel for the money!
B0039752R2|5|Sealed up some headlights I modified. Worked like a champ.
B000CNC3V4|5|fine
B0084UJHJI|5|WOW!!  Finally a great product at a great price.  A little trouble getting to rear wheels but that was more about me than the product.  Fit like a custom made glove.
B0049JC8XU|5|Great option to replace your catalytic converter at about 1/3 the cost of genuine Toyota parts. Fixed our check engine light issue and code P0430. Our van passed state inspection without issues. Very pleased.
B007UHPSCG|5|Keeps the so much cooler!
B0009LPJ0Q|3|still up in the air about the product
B00WY5L09O|5|Take the time to follow the directions and complete each step properly. Don't rush the job. You'll want to go to your local hardware store and pickup a can of UV protectant spray paint to spray over the headlights when you're done with the polishing to help prevent the lights from oxidation
B0101A0C38|5|We dont like Hillary.
B000WMCJPK|5|Works great, easy to install, good price
B00AIJY2ZM|5|Good quality
B000EQ6IF6|5|Great product and great price
B010MTN8K2|5|I just installed them and love them. Thank you for the helpful instructions. Made it quick and easy.
B0017ZGMIQ|5|Awesome product..works like a charm. Leaves your car shining and no mess!
B008EEYTRE|5|Everything fit good. oem parts.
B00CAY8LO6|3|Although this product does what it was designed to do (hide the servo connector) and looks good on my 2013 CVO Anniversary Road Glide, I feel it should be a little more rigid.  With just a slight increase in the thickness of the metal, it would be less prone to vibration.  My concern is the possibility of snapping this by accident while cleaning; it's that thin.
B00QVITORA|5|Exactly what we were looking for at a good price
B00UKHVML4|5|Just what I needed
B004Y4QZM0|2|These actually hurt the tips of my fingers I'm not sure if it's just how thick the ends are or what. I went ahead and purchased leather gloves.
B00RVL6A96|1|Does not work in the summer heat.
B00EDD86EM|5|this is as advertised worked perfectly
B00HQZAYC6|2|didn't really see any noticeable difference over my 4 yr old factory wipers.  smeared in all the same places on the window.
B00029WSYK|4|For the price they are good, the mirror backing is plastic and they do slip a little over bumps but hey, they were cheap! lol
B000F6F99G|4|works good
B004M28SWE|5|Looks good
B00XXOCFWQ|5|Sometimes, you are in a rush and you probably get an important text message and your fingers go all over the place. You are not even typing the correct word. Basically, it is all scribble & scrabble. You are like, the heck? That’s when you wish you had a stylus pen, one that is reliable, is able to be compatible with your phone and can help with those everyday needs such as text/internet usage. Hey, why not try Hikeren stylus pen for your everyday use on your phone, tablet and etc.? You are probably saying, why should I consider this stylus pen when my smartphone or tablet screen responds very well with my index finger? There are several benefits of using a stylus pen especially using the Hikeren stylus pen. Your phone/tablet screen will literally thank you because it cuts down on the fingerprint smudges making your phone/tablet look more attractive. Because touchscreens are very sensitive, they are more responsive to stylus pens than your own finger. It can be use at any time, any place. It fits easily in a pocket or even a purse but the best part of a Hikeren stylus pen, you can attach it to the device itself which makes it so much easier for people on the go. You know what is the best part of the Hikeren stylus pen is? This product doesn’t just come with one stylus pen: it comes with ten! Who would have thought to get ten stylus pens!!! You can definitely share with family and friends or just keep one at home, one at work and etc. Now, it gets to the point of time when it gets cold outside and you have to wear gloves because it gets too cold! Now all of a sudden, you get a text message and you are like, aww man, now I have to take off my gloves to text back. Nowadays, there’s gloves that are responsive to touchscreens but what if you didn’t have those gloves? Wait, you don’t have to worry about taking off those gloves, now you can get your stylus pen and text back. No more frozen fingers or scattered text message. The Hikeren stylus pen makes it an all-purpose tool for your smartphone/tablet. This pen has truly saved me from confusing texts/emails and since, I’m on the go, I like to keep my stylus with me. I truly recommend this product to people who are always on the go and need a pen to keep up with them.<br /><br />I enjoyed reviewing this product at a discounted price in exchange for my unbiased and honest opinion.purpose tool for your smartphone/tablet.

B000S0N2RK|5|I already own a B&W 5th wheel hitch, and was so impressed with the quality I ordered this item. All American made, and the best quality out there.
B0073WEZU4|5|Looks better than the standard whip antenna and was easy to install. Now I just have to make sure no one removes it from my vehicle since the only way to tighten is hand tight.
B00239WHLG|5|worked perfectly on my 2011 Toyota Tacoma, but only with the Toyota factory oil filters, it would not fit over a fram oil filter
B0060A7IIQ|5|The mirror works exactly as advertised. Everything shipped without any problems. I was able to apply the mirror easily. Although it felt secure, I attempted to move it around to make sure it didn't fall off. It has gone through a car wash as well. I'm happy and would purchase from this seller again.
B00BSEKOCQ|5|Working in both my older APC back UPS 1500's.
B009ATRKPA|3|Good cushioning but it really does make you sweat - a lot. Needs a thick terry towel on top
B00ZY2AE6E|5|These are wonderful. They give a lot of support and are small enough that I move mine from car to car.  We use them at home, work and in the cars. My kids even use them while doing their homework. Great product.
B008A3VP6M|5|works great
B001UC9IRI|5|Outstanding OEM product for fraction of price locally.  Better than other off brand and less expensive to boot.
B001G72SKQ|5|These were a HUGE improvement in my 2008 Jeep wrangler. Bolted right in, and lit up the way they should.
B004RZMCCI|5|These are good for the money and the clear centers are neat looking
B003SG431U|1|Very cheap material. The strap ripped upon installation.
B000IYNWFS|2|did not fit my 2000 honda accord coup 4cly even tho it said it would. i still give amazon thumbs up the return was fast
B00M0CBV9U|5|We used it on top of our Honda Accord for a 13 hour drive! We pack it according to directions and it worked perfectly!
B00HSTX274|5|Looks really great on car window.
B00JT5CSR0|5|Perfect fit. Good price.
B00E1D1D4Y|4|I work out of my car and this thing is the envy of my co-workers.  Only suggestion is to use hinges on platform.  I put two hinges on the far end to allow me to lift up to expose compartment, otherwise it cannot be accessed due to console.
B004Z76CDI|5|OEM and recommend by BMW. It's fairly cheap. Works well. What else is there to say? get it!
B00SWISMCA|5|Great idea for any fob. You can drop them so easily and this is the best protection for it. I would recommend this product and vendor to all my friends.
B00JHEG81A|5|Awesome product got it 4 days early which is even better! Very bright and simple set up even if you don't know anything about cars you can DIY. Definitatly makes you stand out!
B00D9C2CDO|4|It was a gift, and they really like it!
B00KJLL978|4|Work great
B00669H5T8|5|Great key chain order at once
B003K7BKJU|3|You have to supply your own gasket or o-ring to seal the container.
B00LCNXBNM|5|It is everything I expected for that price.
B00OBXIK2M|3|The blade does a great job.  Metal, tile, glass all come dry in one pass.  The handle?  The plastic handle is too rigid and not ergonomic.  The tool is constantly slipping out of my hand when I squeegee the shower.  Still think the product is a good performer, but it has design faults in the handle (materials and shape) that need to be addressed.
B0024ECCJW|5|Great dealfor the price.  Has been used for a week now and provides excellent service.
B008B8ORIY|5|it was what my customer wanted and the price was right
B0007N3JNU|5|So far, so good. Time will tell since I hope to get about 5 years out of this battery (previous one of a different brand lasted a bit less than 4), which is typical for a UPS. It was a perfect drop in replacement for my aging but still working Energizer UPS which supplies back-up power to a pair of video hard drive recorders.
B00AMN3JYE|5|Nice quality. Durable. Very nice. I would order them again.
B0007TJ7GW|5|Easy to put together and works great in the back of my 2015 Rav4.  We were fostering a Husky, and anyone who has travelled with one in the vehicle can probably attest to the fact that they will do anything they can to get to the front and be part of the driving action.  Two other pet barriers failed to the point I actually made one myself out of PVC for my truck, but I wanted a nicer looking option when we bought the new SUV.  This barrier worked great.  It stayed put and kept the husky in the cargo area.  She is now with her forever home, but we are keeping the barrier for future dogs in case they aren't fans of staying where I want them to.
B009EABHUY|4|Cool
B004JVBLQS|5|Does what it's supposed to
B00651BDZY|1|Would not fit my truck.Had to return
B001S874F2|5|Great product. Will purchase again.  Would recommend it to others.
B000GTXXUE|5|muy buen filtro
B003S6F3IC|5|This went in slick.  I found instructions on youtube and changed it out in about an hour.<br />Much cheaper on Amazon than other stores.  Here is an installation link.
B003554TB8|4|Very easy to use.  Only have used it for 1 400 mile trip so far.  Not sure how long it will last looks like the plastic may get some holes on the edges.  May be my fault though left it inside the hot van while not in use.  This is my first cargo carrier overall I am happy with it.
B001F15YC2|5|Excellent!
B000CPCC8G|5|Used in my 2014 Toyota Tundra sR5  Works Great
B0047DRMAM|1|Its a beautiful lighter however the red on the case is starting to fade and the screw that hold in the flint is stuck. I'll have to send it to zippo for repairs already.
B008JPUB02|5|Looks like OEM.  I wish they were made a little more durable (all of these torque strut mounts, not just this one).  I can't really complain I guess since the original lasted about 110K miles.  Some have suggested spraying polyurethane foam in the voids, but I didn't bother since that might mess up the functionality.
B000H94F6E|4|Does the job
B004K25IH4|2|I wondered why it's top in khaki diamond was priced less than the black Diamond top and it appears it might be because there are so few of them left. Phasing them out perhaps? Also it turns out it's  pretty rare to find a matching dust cover in khaki. The other thing is,  the straps that secure the top to the roll bars are poorly positioned so they run into the B-pillars...dumb! Worse is they are not symmetrical so the lateral edges just hang. It doesn't  make for a clean looking install. Finally,  there are 3 attachment points on one side and only 2 on the other. They provided that extra strap in the box but didn't sew it into the top.WTF???
B00HJB4ZZE|4|It fight great . It looked just like a millimeter  smaller  but it fight with a lil elbow  grease .  My motor  does not  jump  anymore
B00EKTIBKS|5|Easy to install and looks great.
B008427D88|5|No issues and no problems with the product!
B005JJ0D22|5|fit perfect has rubber standoff bushings to slow rust that killed ford part.As usual great Amazon price and fast prime shipping.
B008EEZ2WU|5|Nice OE quality part.  Don't use that cheap Chinese aftermarket pump when this is barely more.  I cannot understand why is Aisin not marketing their stuff more in the local auto parts stores?
B00GHT6COQ|5|Works well
B003ECULUU|1|Horrible and cheap.  Don't buy
B00HWI9QTE|5|Good looking and we'll built. Easy installation.
B0089IH530|2|it does not fit the vehicle it was ordered for! Had to return it for a full refund.
B004VDSSBA|4|Fits and looks great retention clips a little chintzy
B00HU3ENOY|1|I have ordered 3 of these. All three were not the same as the picture.
B002E39YBW|5|Fit and works perfectly on 09 nissan frontier
B00802FXXO|5|yup
B008S9CLGG|5|Everything was perfect
B00F42QOMM|5|Did not fit 2015 Hyundai Sonata! Connect is are different! Otherwise good service!
B00CFUBUV6|5|Very funny people enjoy it
B0009I2OIE|5|Thanks
B005G6J3EM|3|Came in an envelope and was slightly bent.  Nothing major, though, and since it's a Christmas gift there's plenty of time for it to flatten under a stack of books.  Just hope I don't forget where I put it.  It looks very nice, can't wait to see it on a car.
B006B214X8|5|Illest
B00UFERZKO|3|Great Product
B005DUM9FG|5|Great Grips!  --1996 Road King
B00NGOZ26E|5|It does fit perfectly
B00OBTI7X8|5|Great product fast delivery
B00F5MUB66|5|Exellent
B008I7Q4O8|5|very pleased with product
B00H554R98|4|Worked fine
B0081SAXRI|3|Wire hookup instructions would be nice. Other than that works perfectly.
B00P9R417M|5|Nice to have a place to store the helmet out of site. It's large enough to carry 2 grocery bags home.
B00C0YQXYQ|5|Awesome thanks a lot
B004PNNMVC|4|The reverse side from the maroon is a white cloth mesh.  Very nice for scrubbing.  However, the mesh is not attached to the maroon side except along the edges.  For that reason, the mesh side tends to slip against surfaces to which it is being applied. For that reason only, product gets 4 stars.  Nevertheless, I would buy another package.  Great price compared to stores.
B00C0SQ8KG|5|Works really well. Bright and reliable
B000Z0HVHA|5|Great!
B001ELTVRC|5|Great price.  Quick delivery.  Very pleased.
B0085H6J9G|3|Works as advertised seems less robust than original
B00MG2PP46|5|I love it.. very happy with it.
B000CHGJEM|5|Excellent.
B00EYTXHDA|5|I have one of these installed in my Perko brand white navigation/anchor light on my boat.  The LED bulb is much brighter than the incandescent 1004 bulb that it replaced, runs much cooler, and uses less than a third of the current (0.94A for the 1004 and 0.30A for this LED replacement).  I put the second one into the dry box just in case this one fails.<br /><br />Great choice if you want more visibility and lower drain on your boat's battery when anchored.
B00PV6SXPM|5|Very bright
B00A1XGR4E|5|OEM filters.  Best available. and price is great online at Amazon.
B00BITL00Q|5|Was perfect and great!!
B00LGVEU1M|5|The price was reasonable, the fit was good and installation was simple for 2 people, although 1 person could install as well. These fender flares were exactly what I was looking for and my old truck looks great.
B00ODPW6UK|5|Nice, good quality
B00SE3SINQ|5|whats to say, bright and they work and cheaper than auto parts stores...
B00Z6KLT2C|5|This little device saved me $ 300.00. Less than $ 10.00. I installed this in my old 1990 jeep in the fuel line coming from tank just before the filter because the check valve in the fuel pump was leaking back. Don't get in a hurry when you order this. It is shipped from China.I don't care where it was made. It works.
B008BDWLM8|5|Great. Very well packaged fast delivery. Thanks alot!
B00BX7GH1U|5|super comfortable & Bluetooth works great !
B00S3I03LC|5|They're awesome! And came with more than enough lights. I've started putting lights where there weren't lights before!
B00AZFZGMC|5|I give them 5 stars, but remember you get what ya pay for
B000IHK1VI|5|A good product and well worth the price.  Many others are fancier and made out of metal, but for my occasional use, it's great,
B00ACDP6YU|5|Good cheap tach/hourmeter, bought if for diagnostic purposes and did just fine for that, I do question it's longevity as you cannot replace the batteries, but hey, it's cheap, what do you want?
B00VMYDZNC|4|Its a good looking sticker for my truck.
B009EQBVV8|5|Nice and quiet, softer and smoother than stilock. The fit was perfect.
B00E1SRCLM|5|Great value for great parts. Would buy again
B00GVHQTN8|5|Works like it should made my flush mount lights point forward perfectly on my front bumper couldn't be happier
B00CUECAEI|4|It works
B0066TPVO4|4|Fits and functions like new!  will see how it holds.
B0042XORMI|5|Good deal, decent fuses.
B00QRHDIPY|3|Pretty much on the hokey side.
B000EQXOMQ|1|Sent the wrong side the first time so I reorded keeping the passenger side to replace that one anyway. The part came in the wrong side one again. I wasted my time and my mechanics time. He was not able to install 2 passenger side control arms on the same vehicle. He ended up drilling out the ball joint and using the existing arm and bolts to attach the ball joint to the arm.
B000RGXLG2|5|item as described
B004PGIJJY|5|Love it...dont forget to buy the bestop header bar....other brands  will not snap to it.  I love my bestop over the other brand my wife has on her jeep.... Requires Windshield Channel PN[51243-01];
B00T0VWM9W|3|Smaller than I anticipated.
B00904WS84|4|Is light and strong, it fit me real well the delivery was fast.
B00381BSKO|5|good for touch-ups
B00AAXKQME|3|This product is close, but not a direct fit for all stated engines.  Take a good look at your throttle and choke connections versus those on this product.
B000WEOTDS|5|Perfect fit for my 2005 Expedition
B00J7RB72M|1|flimsy terrible case! if I could I would return it for a refund
B00E5OUOCQ|1|The worst and cheapest sun shade I have ever seen. It was extremely flimsy and has tiny little holes in it. There is no way this keeps any bit of sun or heat out of your car. It I could give it 0 stars I would.
B004I3VY32|1|Had it on my vehicle for only two days when I noticed the yellow piece fell off and was lost.  Poorly designed.
B00VHSFG1M|5|Display looks great! Easy install and set up!
B0068MRJEO|5|Popped the old one out, and replaced it with this regulator.<br />I get 4 more mpg now! ... Hooray!
B00A2URZEW|5|These are awesome decals.  They went on just as stated.  Any Star Wars fan would love to have these. We bought these and the S. W. Scum snf Villainy Booster Pack Car decals so we could mix and match.
B001VYX3DU|5|Very nicely made fits great
B005GT6EZ0|5|Great product. No more turning the wheel back and forth to make sure the stern drives are aimed straight.
B006TMLTGM|4|I order Crome border and needed black but ok
B00651CLCS|1|Static. Before I installed this antenna I got reception after this antenna all I get is static. Wish it worked for me.
B00BU9Y3FS|1|This is NOT a Key retaining lock.  If you are looking for the key retaining feature, do not buy this lock.  A &#34;True&#34; key retaining lock does not release the key until the lock shackle is secure and this lock does not have that feature.  It appears to be a good lock but, definitely NOT key retaining.
B00O5UFNEO|5|Very nice cover. Fits my 2001 Road King perfectly with the windshield in place. Material and construction seem very good. Would buy again without hesitation.
B009X1XDZG|5|Perfect fit and Dana/Spicer quality for the Dana 30 front axle in my '98 Jeep Cherokee (XJ).
B005EM9OCE|5|Product was as advertised. Received on time
B0002SA22Q|3|A little disappointed by the design.  I would have expected more from Bestop.  The rail tilts back from the upper windshield frame.  This results in a less than secure fitment of the belt rail. I think that if the brackets were positioned and welded so that the rail sat more upright, (rolled towards the front of the vehicle) that it  would result in a more snug and secure anchoring of the belt rail.
B008CE0W5Y|4|The lights worked after I installed everything, the one knock I would give it is the wire was just barely long enough for my 21' trailer, couldn't find anything with longer wire.
B009UGWT8G|5|Bought as a present and recipient loved it
B009S7I9KE|5|Installed easily, fit perfectly and looks great.
B007VEOEKA|5|Exact fit and super fast shipping.  Bought this for my 2001 Ford Excursion, was expecting it to take a week to arrive and it showed up the next day!  Awesome service.  Installed this myself in under 30 minutes and it works perfectly.
B00CIB0GKI|2|I didn't get the sticker that was shown in the picture. Instead I got another Totoro sticker that had really wavy lines around it.
B000COMWKU|5|This product saved me much money, stress, and time.. I had replaced my rear suspension on my car, new structs but the older bushings were rusted shut. I realized I did not have any bushings to replace them with. I looked around, the prices were way too high or I won't get in time to finish the job. I had to cut the bolts off with a grinder, burnt, hack sawed, and chisel the old bushings out. I had to press these bad boys in with a makeshift tool, and they fit well.
B005UQQADU|5|These floor mats are great.  I have to admit, they do come a little oversized, but that is to make them more universally compatible for more cars.  If you purchase these and find that they are a little oversized, these mats, similar to most others at autozone and walmart, come with grooves and areas on the mats themselves to cut them to the exact measurements and size that you need in order for them to be a perfect fit for your car, like they were for mine.<br /><br />All I did was follow the pre grooved/pre cut areas, These were now a custom perfect fit.<br /><br />I especially like the unique back seat floor mats.  It's all one piece which makes it for easy removal to clean or pull out AND it will cover and protect the center part of the floor that slopes up.  Not many people see or think about this part of the floor in the back until something is spilled on it.  These mats are the answer for that.  These provided better coverage and protection than the OEM ones that came with my car.
B007TYF9DI|5|Perfect for my Windstar!
B000CMIYE0|5|Great quality and great look
B000BLMJN4|5|Received as expected.  Very quick delivery.
B00BW4OWRK|5|Purchased these for my 2013 Kia Optima EX and they fit perfectly!  Very easy to install, and they look great!<br /><br />*Note: If you own an SX, SXL, or Hybrid, these mudguards will not fit your vehicle!
B00XJAW6QY|5|No issues and no problems with the product!  My granddaughter Loves this stuff!
B008MCJR84|5|Fast delivered, easy to install.
B004X1UBUQ|5|These sunglasses are great!  My eyes tend to dry out on the bike but because these are padded they keep the air from getting in and my ride is now comfortable!
B00Y4G7YS2|5|My grandson loves his new gear
B0084UJKCC|5|Highly recommend
B00008RW9U|5|Good deal also like them a lot.
B00GI2IJTI|1|so.....NOT AT ALL WHAT IS DISPLAYED. check out my picture for proof.<br />for the price i wouldve said it was worth it.... but when a seller intentionally advertises a better product than what is givin, we get mad. its scandalous and just flat-out DIRTY.<br />keep in mind to avoid this seller in-case youre shopping around for more stickers(like me)
B003LR7Q9M|5|Only buy this if you ride your bike a lot.  Seat is very hard! First 100 miles seat is hard! 200 miles seat is better! And is getting better all the time. I use Brooks Proofide Saddle Dressing on it and it helps with the break in. I like the seat better the more miles I put on the bike. And it looks great!
B004EIAADG|5|Works fine so far for my limited use, providing 120V power to a couple of appliances in my car - other outlets including 12V and USB are also useful.  I like very much that you can use any standard extension cord for recharging.  For my uses it has been entirely silent.
B00W5MG8XY|5|Works perfectly.  Multifunction features are an extra bonus.
B00CPOBGD4|5|I loved,  Great quality .
B00D1S0JKO|1|arrived chipped and rusted...otherwise perfect for the job
B000M8RY0E|5|Great product, hard to find in stores where I live
B000AUQWMK|4|Not as good as coilovers. Using this with a set of Tokico D specs. Feels great. If you put it on the stock, it will lower the car to an acceptable height. Gets rid of the awful front gap on the RX8 and stiffens up the ride a bit. Feels better with the new shocks than the stock however. Just remember stock shocks are built for stock springs.
B00DR8YBPM|2|Very poor quality. Edges were ragged and very choppy. Several parts were misshapen such as the hatchet/meat cleaver, his left leg was misshapen. Very unprofessional and unauthentic looking. Got here a day early though so points for that. Overall would not recommend.
B00V7YLXMW|5|Great product!!
B008F9V9AI|5|Attached it on the boat, no more spills.
B00FS66GYA|4|perfect
B00ZM9LANA|5|This is a great little car organizer for the price! Its not overly big or bulky, fits nicely in my smaller car. As of right now I just have a few little first aid items in it, extra pacifier, wet ones, some tissues and a comb and other misc. baby items. I love that it comes with the trash bag, I usually just have a sack hanging and on a couple occasions I've had it rip open so its nice to have a holder. My niece is going to be pretty excited about the ipad holder, I thought that was a neat touch!  Disclaimer- I received a discount to leave my honest opinion!
B00AJPCSTW|5|Perfect and quick ship!!!
B0083KIWHW|1|Peice of Chinese S***, does not fit a Harley the Horn Cover & No instructions in any language
B00E6EBM80|5|Good stout switch. Requires at least 1 2/2 inch clearance behind it, though.
B000C7ZC4U|3|Quality seems solid, but this DOES NOT FIT 5/7L on a 91 Cadillac Brougham.  The check fit said it did.
B00LNIPAD0|5|Worked like a charm and delivered fast!  Would buy again.
B00Q8FUFN8|3|No instructions and the package was torn open and beaten up.
B000MSDKMA|1|Poorly designed. After 7 months use the bottom corner (Being thin and made of a brittle plastic) broke off. The battery simply stopped holding a charge. It should be made so if the flimsy corner does break off, it wouldn't affect the operation of this very expensive battery.
B004L03854|5|Just what I was looking for!
B00B9EXNTQ|5|Well made looks great fast shipping would buy again if need to
B009M1VO6C|4|met expectations, I recommend this seller
B00FJT6N4Y|5|Very fast delivery. Products were satisfactory in all respects. Installation was easy. The Monroe Quick-Strut is the only way to go, especially for a do-it-yourselfer.
B000E2CVI8|5|Bike is Happy. (08 CBR600rr) the smaller nozzle is perfect, easily unscrews with a wrench.
B000AA4RWM|5|Mounted easily on my camper.
B0057ZQJ12|3|It works as expected
B003YN9LD2|5|Works great
B000WJ0RK2|5|Great material
B00A448NYW|5|Can't wait to get them on my car
B009TAQVWS|5|Easy to set up! Great product!
B00NIXI5DK|3|Font was too small to read easily.
B003JLLPOW|5|More than I hoped. Great balance of capacity and not-too-bigness. Protectively stiff. Expands cleverly and a lot. Easy on, stays secure, easy off, walks away like a brief-case. (I would pay more.) (I'm using it on a modified 2000 Ducati Monster 900ie.)
B00KA3Z0X4|5|Bought this as a joke for my friends dodge. It mounted perfectly to a nv4500 and he likes it
B00M0CBV9U|5|Was pleasantly surprised on how well the bag performed for our road trip. We were able to carry a lot of extra stuff, which the soft bag accommodated. I followed the packing instructions offered by others and was pleased with how the Roofbag performed. I'm a safety nut, so I purchased an additional strap which gave me peace of mind.
B004L5T8V2|5|This horn is really loud. Hoping that it will outlast the Wollo's I have bought. Have 6 old Wollo's in my tool box. They last about six months each. I will follow up at a later date on how well this horn performs over time. The horn was very easy to install. The only disappointment was the cheap Velcro that had to be used to install the cap.
B00IESMAOO|5|Looks great will give it 5 stars.  Will be back later with another update if they don't hold up.  So if you don't see an update from me then they are good to purchase.
B00SSJNSVI|5|I love this bag - It has several compartments and is a convenient size.  One of the zippers broke soon after purchase, but there's two and the second one is fine.  I still gave it 5 stars because otherwise it's a great bag.
B000182ESW|5|Nice
B00CYLETLY|5|Love how it glitters when the sun hits it!
B00FM6UTIU|2|Well, against my better judgement I decided not to spend big money on Rigids and try out these Rough Country lights.  The moral of the story is simple; you get what you pay for.  Everybody saying how bright these are have never purchased KC day lighters or Rigid D2s before.  I'm running 2 pairs of these and I am very disappointed.  If it wasn't for the fact that my headlights are terrible on my hunting truck, I'd return both pairs and buy one pair of D2s or a 20&#34; bar.  Lucky for the seller dove season is 10 days away and I don't have time to swap them out.  There will be Rigid D2 XLs on my truck for Christmas and these Rough Country lights will be given away.  Quality isn't bad for the price, but they are nowhere near bright enough for desert trails in the middle of the night.  If these are 2200 lumens each I'll eat my hat.  I know what 8800 lumens of output should look like, this is nowhere near that.
B008HAUQNG|5|Cheap lights and good light quality. I installed them more than 9 months ago and they are still good. Definitely recommend this product.
B0061OR9V2|3|This did not work on my 2014 street glide. I had to return it and go to Harley for the correct part. It may work great but it not for me.
B008VQ23EQ|5|Thick and high quality.  I expect these to last many years.
B007Q8LV98|1|DOESNT FIT TO SIZE AND IT FELT SUPER UNCONFORTABLE
B00029WYEY|5|Works as advertized
B000FT2WBG|5|good product
B00QXLI7VO|5|Fit perfectly on my 2011 f350. I have no complaints what so ever. It even arrived earlier than the expected delivery date.
B00UESXQ8Q|5|VERY SATISFIED! Great pice! will recommend to everyone for off-road!
B000WK3MK8|5|just what I needed
B005BD49E4|5|Just installed these so I will try to update this if needed but WOW! What a difference these make! I've had 2 R6s - a low mileage 2007 and a high mileage (20k) 2010, both with mediocre braking as far as I was concerned. The high mileage bike had some warping of the previous rotors so I got these for a steal of a price and went with the basic Galfer pads as well. Installation was cake and Galfer includes very basic but important installation instructions suggesting you clamp the brake pads down onto the rotors BEFORE tightening the axle tube bolt, fork lock bolts, and caliper bolts in order to maximize alignment of the pads to rotors. I just took a quick ride and the bite of this new setup is incredible! Highly recommended. Did I mention they look about ten times better than stock? Very, very pleased with this product. This is my first Galfer purchase. UPDATE: still tons of bite and better feel a year later. Definitely a more worthwhile upgrade than an ECM box and a pipe.
B000CQDS1K|4|Except for the tie-down, it is well designed.
B00252A0M4|5|very good and fast service would order again
B00K8VQNGG|3|cute
