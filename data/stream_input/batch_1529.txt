B007SGM084|1.0|I consider this book to be \\"garbage\\".  I have never been more disappointed in a book before.  This is rated as a best seller.  I bought the trilogy bundle and I wish I could get a refund.  I read part of the first one, closed my kindle and decided enough of this. Please don't waste your money and time on this book.
B0058YPG1G|5.0|Fast and clean delivery of the 4th season of this wonderful series; quality of product of first class and great price.
034580404X|1.0|I am so disappointed I downloaded the whole trilogy. I wish I had not wasted my money as I will not be reading the last two. I did finish the first one thinking it might get better. It  didn't. There are so many other well-written books out there. Do not waste your precious reading time on these. How sad that this is what's at the top of the best seller list. If you want to read porn at least read good porn.

1401937519|5.0|Excellent book. This is an amazing story. I has taught me about what happens in the afterlife. The mear fact that we will not be judge in the afterlife is very conforting. I wish it was in Spanish so I could share it with a friend.
0307730697|5.0|I was so impressed with the life story of Adam Brown that I gave copies of the book to my sons, son-in-law, Marine nephew, and husband. It is a fast-paced read that appeals to both men and women. In it, we see Adam, warts and all, overcome his demons through God's grace to become a true man of valor. We see a warrior and yet a loving husband, father, son, and friend. We see a life impacted that went on to impact others. I highly recommend this book!

160788982X|1.0|I had never read a Nicholas Sparks novel before. I purchased this one at a school book fair to help fund book purchasing for the library.  When I started reading it, I thought it was okay, but the more I got into it, the more cliched I realized the plot and characters were.  The evil husband was just too much to believe.  No one could drink that much and actually track down his escaped wife who had run away from him because of awful physical abuse he committed against her, even if he was \\"a good detective,\\" as the author kept informing us that he was.  Then there's the perfect love-interest for the hiding, abused wife.  Way too perfect.  And way too unbelievable.  And the main character, herself, was also too perfect to be believable.  Formula writing at its worst.  The ending left me feeling that I had been cheated out the time it took me to plow through the novel, which I should have thrown across the room during the first few chapters when I pretty much knew how everything would turn out.  Except for the \\"surprise\\" ending that was just so silly that I wanted to tear the pages from the book, crumple them, and recycle them.  Not worth the paper they were printed on.<br /><br />I will never read another Nicholas Sparks novel.
B007MDB71O|4.0|A heck of a fun film that most people will never see. It's too bad Disney wimped out and didn't market it well or enough. It's also too bad the director or screen writer tried too hard to explain everything about Mars before the film even started.<br /><br />But once the first confusing 5 minutes or so are over, it's an amazingly good adventure movie. Lots of action, wonderful characters and creatures (in particular the Martian dog and any Thark, male or female) and a bunch of good action and CGI. The film is just plain beautiful to look at--dying planet or not, you're ready to go to Mars by the end of it. And the sky ships are just amazing--I could have watched those all day.<br /><br />If they'd skipped the humorous but unenecessary framing device of having Edgar Rice Burroughs in the film, and just gone right to Mars, it'd probably have done much better. It's too bad the filmmakers didn't have more confidence in the material and the story itself, to say nothing of the actual title, A Princess of Mars.<br /><br />I'm willing to bet the hordes of people who went to see Prometheus would have been much happier after seeing John Carter.
0307730697|5.0|I bought this book for my son to read, and he loved it. The story is heart rendering and I'm blown away by the courage and selflessness these men show. We all NEED to read their stories to remember what our freedom cost.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|I saw this movie in the Theater because I wanted to see all the action on the big screen. I was not disappointed. The movie makers did a fantastic job considering it took two years to make due the Seals<br />rotation schedule. I loved it so much I could not wait to get the DVD so I went on Amazon and pre-ordered it! As for the Seals who acted in it, they did a fantastic job. Their movements are fluid and solid in the action scenes much better than any actor in Hollywood could ever learn. Being around weapons the live fire scenes were awesome and the real deal. I love this movie because it is very real as to what Seals, Delta, Rangers and other Special OPS do mission wise.  I am very proud of them and their families. For they serve us in ways we will never know and are paid not as much as you would think. At the end of the movie is a Honor List of all the names of Seals we have lost. Many of them their stories are known. I urge you to read about these unique men. Their stories humble me, make me cry and laugh how the strangest things happen in battle. I am honored. Just think, these men lay down their live for us. Greater than he who layeth his life down for a friend.
B003IY49S4|5.0|A colleague in the office first showed me her set of Perfect jazz Collection: Volume 2, so I bought this from Amazon. It has to be the best $2 per CD I have ever spent on Jazz records. Because of my age I am having difficulties reading the text on the CD covers but this does not detract from the quality and the performance of all 25 soloists or groups/combos in the set. I even think the version of Kind of Blue in this set is better than the version I already have. Some reviewers have complained about the noise on some of the tracks - hey that is the way they were recorded! Do yourself a favour and order this collection from Amazon.

1609611543|5.0|This book has revolutionized my way of looking at food! We all already know that processed foods are bad for us, but this book really helped me understand WHY these foods are so terrible for our health. As an insulin resistant individual, sugar had already been eliminated from my diet before I read \\"Wheat Belly\\", but my health issues remained, and my extra twenty pounds wouldn't budge. I read this book eight weeks ago and immediately began following the guidelines. I had always, since childhood, eaten almost entirely whole grain foods, as opposed to white breads, processed cereals, etc. My mom raised us kids on homemade whole grain bread, even grinding the wheat herself. But, when I removed these \\"heart healthy whole grains\\" from my diet my blood sugar problems disappeared and my weight plummeted two to three pounds per week-eight weeks later I weigh twenty-one pounds less! No exercise at all. My energy and mental clarity have improved the whole time! I would recommend this book to anyone who would like to improve their health, whether they want to lose weight or not.

B000FCKGPC|1.0|I am so sorry I spent the time it took to read all five of the George R. R. Martin books in this series. I only continued because I was waiting for some sort of \\"justice\\" for the characters I had come to love. Instead, the author killed every single one in truly gruesome and heartbreaking ways, while leaving the bad people to go on. What I was left with was emotional upset and horrific mental images. This is one author I never want to meet - his mind and heart are truly frightening to me. I will never read another word by this author.

1442419814|4.0|When I first started the Uglies, I was interested but found that the story took awhile to get going.  There was no real punch-you-in-the-face shocker or world shattering discoveries for more then half of the book but I kept plugging along, realizing it takes time to set up a trilogy, hoping at least I would be able to have my tween daughter read it next. Well, let me assure you, I was rewarded for my efforts and dedication.  The last quarter of the book really takes off and sustains itself all the way through Pretties (Book 2) and  Specials (Book 3).  The writing is consistent throughout and I loved the moral and ethical issues addressed, as Tally Youngblood is torn between different realities and placed in situations that have no simple solution.  And now that I am finished with The Uglies Trilogy, I can see the importance of the long set-up in Book 1.  All of those thoughts, feeling, actions and justifications come into play, change and evolve with Tally's character as she is continually put through the ringer.

B000059590|2.0|Because this DVD was released in a different 'region', it would not play in any of my DVD players.  I have never experienced this problem before.  We had to play it on the computer and the sound was almost inaudible.  We had recently seen the play, and my son really wanted to see the movie version.  It was quite a disappointment.
B006NYQAJM|5.0|This is a great set with all the basics at a decent price. The actual set could be more durable, but otherwise it is a lot of fun. My two kids, 5 and 4, play with this set for at least an hour every single day.<br />Set comes with Batman, Robin, Joker, Riddler, and Harley Quinn. Also with the set is a \\"Dark Knight\\"-style Bat-Cycle that is EXTREMELY durable to the point where my boys see how hard they can slam it into the wall before breaking it and it hasn't lost one piece!<br />My only other complaint is the Lego pieces are very specific and I can't imagine using these pieces to build anything else. \\"Back in my day\\" you could get a set this size and use the pieces to build a bunch of different things - the boxes even had suggestions on the back of what else you could build.<br />Overall, The Funhouse Escape is a classic set and Lego did it justice.

B004Z8ZFAI|5.0|Love this edition of the movie, Rio, than the one-disc edition. Learned a lot about Rio De Janiero from the 2nd disc. Even the fun activities on the disc are fun(that's all I'm saying so that way I don't spoil it for everyone). Definitely recommend this version of the movie than the one-disc.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I read this book faster then the first one! The twist in this book surprised and made me sad for Katniss. But of course there would be a twist like that, Katniss lives in a time of sadistic power and control. The twists, turns, small happiness and great dissapointments of the characters lives keep me hooked. I've started the third book and cant wait to get to the end. I would recommend this book.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|She took me with her on your trip through the wilds and we were both lost and then found. I could hear her voice reverberate in my head as the pain and then truths were revealed.<br /><br />If you like books that are not mired in fantasy but take you on a journey through real life. Not sugar coated. Then this the book and journey for you.<br /><br />It takes guts to hike the PCT by yourself and guts to expose your faults, pain and mistakes. Cheryl does not lack guts. So strap on your backpack and put on your hiking boots and take the plunge. It is so worth it.
B003PIUBZS|2.0|I received the series as a gift. I could not watch more than the first episode. The blood and gore were just too much for me. The  gratuitous soft porn scenes I felt were unnecessary and the script and story line are fit for teenage fiction. I will have to re-gift the set to someone who maybe able to appreciate it.
B0011Z10PC|4.0|I have always wanted to have several of the songs by G.D. especially \\"On Holiday\\", which features sections that are unique to my ear such as an all-too-brief phrase of just voice with a huge bass, and the cheeky comment on American politics and war mongering titled 'the Representative from California..(sknitcchh)' God I Love it! I saw the video using the band in a big convertible and that's radical, that would be something I'd maybe want to buy.<br />  I very much appreciate the easy download service from Amazon and the free cloud space to stuff my music in when I want to. It took a while to download the software,actually longer than it took to add \\"American Idiot\\" to my PC, the whole thing including paying for it was a breeze and a good deal for me. Very little time, relatively and now that I have added the download software it'll take much less time for future purchases. Like everybody else, I like the pick and chose options.<br />  Perhaps the next favorite song I like is the \\"Me and My Shadow\\"-type song. It so perfectly images loneliness and the comfortable feeling of complete mastery of a shadow universe because no one is around. How easily that can be arranged,merely flake off every friend and anyone who cares about you. So the shadow 'me' does everything I do and nothing else, waiting on my decisions to act. God is me, or anyone in the shadow world.<br />  Good stuff. Okay there are a few pieces I'll need to warm up to, I don't like every song, nor even all of the music, but so many other fans have loved it complete and the quality is great (as great as my PC and speakers can put out, anyway) and very clear, every thing came through loud and clear and acceptable as far as I'm concerned.
0062183591|5.0|\\"If we're honest with ourselves, we know we're not honest with ourselves\\" - Kevin Nenstiel<br /><br />Dan Ariely, in his book The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty (How We Lie to Everyone--Especially Ourselves), shows how most of think ourselves as honest, but, in fact, we all cheat. Unethical behaviour is pervasive and none of us are immune. This pragmatic book is an outstanding example of how to apply social science in general and behavioural economics in particular, to daily life and invent new approaches to improve our results.<br /><br />Dan Ariely, the founder and director of the Center for Advanced Hindsight, is the authority about irrational behaviour and he is ideally positioned to write a book about the forces that make us cheat and about the best ways to control them. A brilliant behavioural economist, Ariely also shows how hard it is to see which forces are irrelevant and which are at work.<br /><br />First, contrary to popular belief, dishonesty is not a result of rational cost-benefit analysis. Even if we kick the doors wide open and send all the guards home, few people would plunder the entire treasury but most people will help themselves to some of it.<br /><br />Next, Ariely shows that dishonesty is pervasive, and, most importantly, we do not see it in ourselves.<br /><br />Third, Ariely shows that cheating is result of a balancing act between two forces, namely, the desire to benefit and the desire to think of ourselves as essentially good. So, we cheat, regardless of consequences and as long as we can still rationalize our cheating as essentially good behaviour. That's, for instance, how we miss the omnipresent conflicts of interest.<br /><br />Fourth, Ariely shows how dishonesty spreads virally. When we see people who essentially resemble us get away with dishonesty, we are more likely to cheat ourselves. On the other hand, if we see others resist dishonesty, our likelihood of virtuous behavior increases. Irrationally, we seek role models.<br /><br />Having made these fundamental discoveries, Ariely draws recommendations to curb dishonesty and then gives examples of their application in practice:<br /><br />1. Both the traditional liberal and the conservative solutions to curb dishonesty are ineffective. Rely neither on regulations nor on penalties to prevent dishonesty, because people ignore cost-benefit calculations.<br />2. Create conditions where dishonesty would become far more difficult to self-justify because it requires a more deliberate, more intentional activity,<br />3. Establish social norm of honesty, find and celebrate role models or honesty,<br />4. Create resetting events, periodic endpoints for dishonesty and opportunities for new beginnings, e.g., remind about moral code: even atheists cheat less after swearing on a Bible.<br /><br />Read this book and observe how it changes the way you think about your relationships and your work./>Having made these fundamental discoveries, Ariely draws recommendations to curb dishonesty and then gives examples of their application in practice:<br /><br />1.

B007SGM084|3.0|I started the 50 shades series after seeing so many friends/family read it and rave about it. I succumbed to the peer pressure and hype. I did read the reviews on Amazon before hand so I could be prepared for what I was delving into. Previous reviwers weren't kidding when they said it's Twilight fan fiction, it is exactly that. Ana and Bella could be twin sisters from the same low self esteem/self loathing camp,lol. That being said I think TONS of girls/women can relate to Ana's charcter because we've all not liked ourselves at some point in our lives, some more than others.The charcter of Christian though is every low self esteem womens fantasy and the author beats that dead horse until he's just a pile of dust. Heaven forbid we instill some self worth/respect into our future generations of females. Instead lets fantasize about how the ultimate solution is a rich, sexy, all in one savior who will worship us regardless of our faults. The logical adult woman with self esteem in me SMH in disgust at this part of the series.<br />  The sex, what can I say? The sex scenes can be pretty hot albeit a bit vanilla IMO. As someone who has practiced BDSM I feel like the author doesn't understand the lifestyle as much as she thinks she does. What Ana and Christian do throughout the series is BDSM but it is toned down and refined IMO. A true follower of the lifestyle or someone big into the scene is probably insulted by the authors assumptions and portrayals of certain aspects of Christians BDSM.<br />  As I get further and further into Ana and Christians relationship I can't help but feel like I'm in college again w/my first real b/f and all of our mistakes, freakouts, misinterpretations,etc..Reading about Ana & Christians relationship literally makes me happy Im a grown woman who's in a stable adult relationship without all of the drama and BS that Ana & Christian wade through daily. Blame his past and abuse if you will but a large part of their fighting is just two young people who know nothing about relationships. I see so many rookie mistakes its laughable.<br />  In the end this series is simply fluff, the cotton candy of the book world if you will. It won't satisfy your appetite for real plot lines and deep writing but it is fun fiction that you could enjoy once or twice a year when the mood strikes you. In fact the last time I read a book like this was the Twilight serries in 2010. Take this series with a grain of salt it's not meant to be an engrossing read.ple who know nothing about relationships.

B005H9B44A|5.0|The movie is great and the service thru Amazon is the best.  Any problems that may come up they handle very quickly .
B00005JMJG|4.0|Love is mysterious, awkward and odd but also happy, rewarding and exciting. I think anyone who has been in a relationship could learn a thing or two about the sci-fi oriented storyline this film presents.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the premise involves a man (Carrey) who is crippled emotionally after his relationship with his girlfriend (Winslet) ends; he isn't strong enough to work through the pain so he employs the services of a company who specializes in erasing parts of his mind that have anything to do with his ex-girlfriend. It proves to be a blessing in disguise and everything starts unraveling. Upon reflection of the sweet & tender moments he enjoyed, he changes his mind to have the memories erased and attempts desperately to stop the procedure, but the chain of events is already in motion.<br /><br />I won't give away anything else except to say the message the film captures is one of 'better to have loved and lost than not loved at all', but more to the point it romanticizes the idea that love cannot be exorcised from the head (no matter how many lobotomies you subscribe to) for love resides in the heart.<br /><br />Bottom line: The difference between thinking and feeling you love someone is explored through unconventional storytelling and clever narrative (some assembly required) and although there are hints of Jim Carrey's typical goofy quirks, it is played down substantially giving way to great chemistry between the 2 main characters.

B006RUJST6|5.0|I really loved this book! It was such an emotional ride and I loved all the ups and downs, twists and turns! Here is the story of two people who had to deal with some of the worst things life can throw at you and yet they fought hard and persevered! Lake and Will did it all not only for themselves but for their brothers, sacrificing so much for them.<br /><br />Colleen Hoover is such a talented and amazing writer! Her story telling is what made Layken and Will's love and pain feel so REAL to me, it was all happening and I felt it in my bones! To say that the book made me cry is putting it very lightly! We are talking ugly face sobbing! And I loved it all! Lake and Will's story is not all sadness and ugly crying, it was also happiness and love and laughter. What I took away from it all was inspiring!

0439023521|5.0|I started out reading the first page of the book & I was already hooked. I never read a lot of books because none of them really get me hooked right away. The Hunger Games was awesome! For me I actually enjoyed the second book the best. I did think that the last book started out a little slow but with the other two books I wasnt able to put them down so I knew it would pick up which it did. I only borrowed these books from a relative but I want to buy them so that way I can actually read them again! I am actually so amazed by them that I actually believe that any other books I may try to read may dissapoint me because I thought these books were so amazing!

0345803493|2.0|I found this second book at least readable and not debasing women as the 1st one did.  It arrived within a good time  f rame and in good condition. Neither  the 1st or 2nd edition prompted me to order the third and I cannot fathom why this trilogy<br />is getting such extensive press. I'm sure the explicit sex is the answer, but it is so bizzare it is discusting in parts

B007J4T2G8|1.0|As a disclaimer, I have to admit that I did not read the entire book. I downloaded the free two-chapter sample for my Kindle. I knew the premise of the book from my sister-in-law and some friends. Hey, I'm not opposed to getting my rocks off once in awhile, so I decided to look into it. I thought the sample chapters were a great idea since I wasn't really prepared to spend $10 on something that I might hate. While reading, I kept waiting for something compelling to \\"pull me in\\" like I had heard it would.<br /><br />I waited...and waited...and waited...and then reached the end of the sample.<br /><br />There was absolutely NOTHING that made me want to buy the full version. Not one little thing. The only thing I found even remotely intriguing was the amount of clichés and basic creative writing mistakes that were crammed into those two chapters. I haven't read writing that bad since...well...I honestly can't recall. I do a lot of reading, but I think I must've blocked anything even close to this from my memory.<br /><br />The only reason that I can fathom that this has become a \\"best-seller\\" is that it has become acceptable for the church-going SAHM set to read. Ladies, do yourselves a favor and just watch some porn. It's quicker, sets up the same unrealistic fantasies as the book, you can get it for free, and the dialogue is much less painful than reading this.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a great game. brings back so many memories.<br />it also has so many new option. I especially like how it keeps you busy. I wish the energy wouldn't waste so fast.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A bit explicit, but all in all a good read for those of you into love stories. If erotica bothers you, I wouldn't recommend it. If it doesn't, plan on reading all three.
B00785P2QC|5.0|it is fun to make industry's. and then sell stuff at the Mall and then you make. tons of money.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|With all the hype surrounded about the series I felt it was an okay read. The negativity that some have towards it is senseless. There are much worse x-rated series out there that these sites haven't banned. It is a great love story with erotica added into it. I read the series in a week. If you are into love stories then I would recommend to add this trilogy to your library. But beware the content is explicit.

B0067Q42BY|5.0|Very interesting storyline to follow. cool rewards for puzzle accomplishments. This isn't your tired version of Mahjong that fails to fully test you.
034580404X|5.0|The Trilogy came quickly and in excellent shape.  I love that the books are in paperback so it is easy to hold and travel with.  I love dealing with Amazon.com. Also the pre-sale price that I was charged came in at a lower price so Amazon gave me  a credit which I was very surprised at.  I am a happy camper.
B007SWZVBQ|3.0|I'm not sure why the cast seems so slighted on the Glee Graduation Album, but this leans very heavily on the \\"senior class\\" of McKinley High. It also pulls very hard on the pop spectrum, which leaves the usual mixture of classic songs, show tunes and current pop off this disc. For instance, Artie is totally absent. Santana and Brittany are merely background this time. No songs from the warblers or other groups, and no Sue cameos.<br /><br />Which blands the material out significantly. \\"The Graduation Album\\" is more like a K-Tel album than the usually well balanced Glee offerings, saved mainly by Matthew Morrison's excellent reading of Bob Dylan's \\"Forever Young\\" (made popular by Rod Stewart) and Lea Michelle doing a great take on Beyonce's \\"I Was Here.\\" Often, though, some of the songs sound like karaoke (\\"Glory Days\\" being the worst offender) or uninspired (a totally unnecessary \\"We Are The Champions\\"). Given a couple of highlights of the year's season not on disc (\\"Paradise By The Dashboard Light,\\" \\"Mean\\"), some of the overused artists (Madonna again?) could have easily been bumped. It makes me wonder if there will be another offering before the new season starts.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game I thought was going to be retarded and my friend told me it was so much fun and I was like yea right well I got it and.......<br />Know I love it it is so much fun and my favorite game on here is the sushi game in the first page it is si fun and easy thank you 101-in-1 games
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am so impressed with the Wool series! I am not a big sci-fi reader in general but have loved a few recommendations over the years (Moon is a Harsh Mistress, etc) and so did an online search for sci-fi and found this!<br />After finishing Wool 1 I  thought, \\"Oh, no! I don't want these stories to end that quickly!\\" It was gripping and drew me in to the characters.<br />Fortunately, the following stories got longer and longer.<br />By the end, I just didn't want it to end!! Very well written, very suspenseful, loved the characters and am hoping with all my heart that the author continues the series!!!
0802130208|5.0|Those with a good imagination and taste for the absurd will enjoy this book very much. Unlike authors that try to make you giggle with their cute prose, Toole paints riotous scenes of social mayhem along with really great colloquial speech that had me laughing like a madman at times (and at least chuckling every page).<br /><br />P.S. Anyone else think Zach Galifianakis would be pretty much perfect as Ignatius?
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I play this game religiously on my lunch break and as soon as I walk through the door every evening after work!! My four year old daughter is always asking me for mommy's kindle so she can play &quot;her frog game!&quot;

B005HV6Y5W|1.0|This is not a movie, but rather an \\"art film\\".  The sad thing is, it is not a very good one.  Don't waste your time.  I believe your time would be better spent stargazing,  walking along the beach, or taking a long hike.
B005LAIHYU|1.0|The new film, Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter, based on the book by the same name, is another \\"twist\\" on well-known individuals by \\"twisted\\" authors and filmmakers.<br /><br />The people who created the United States' government endowed American citizens with one of their most worthy rights, freedom of speech, making it possible for the nation's citizens to publicly criticize their leaders and issues without fear of dire consequences.  Generations later President Lincoln expertly sustained that precious privilege by holding together the country during its largest threat of dissolution.  Historians have named him the most influential American, and some historians believe Abraham Lincoln to be the greatest US president thus far.<br /><br />The only appropriate connection in this film besides awfully loosely touching on some of the events in Lincoln's life, is \\"vampirism.\\"  In folklore, just as vampires feed off of the blood of others, until 1865, slave owners financially fed off of the arduous efforts of an enslaved labor force.  As the film's title suggests, in this film, Lincoln hunts \\"bad\\" vampires.  However, people who initiate, further, and promote perverted works to be presented to the public that demean the superior exceptionalism of exceedingly noteworthy people are exploiting the very people who are responsible for the producers' freedom of creativity.<br /><br />Freedom requires responsibility.  For authors and filmmakers who want to indulge themselves in the present fad of providing a \\"twist\\" to longtime, established truths, there is an infinite number of fictional characters who can be invented for shock value instead of perversely distorting individuals of superior exceptionalism who have toiled for the good of others in order for these book and film producers to achieve their selfish, monetary gains at the expense of people who have earned respect for their generous, beneficial, and important efforts.  These producing \\"vampires\\" will most likely continueto produce these warped works as long as there is a sufficient number of patrons who will give them their money for this \\"twisted entertainment.\\"
0393088774|1.0|Never in my academic or professional life have I gotten DUMBER after reading a book. Paul Krugman lives in his little cubicle of a world and fantasizes of how he would fix this economy. He is a hypocrite and clearly one of the most culpable figures of why we are in this predicament.  The solutions that he offers in the book are complete nonsense and purely academic (all of them already tried). He has no idea the obstacles that small businesses face on a daily basis and does not see the consequences of throwing good money after bad (in his case, PHANTOM money after bad.) He tries to articulate arguments with weak examples by building straw mans. The fact that he is a Nobel Prize winning economist troubles me and makes me question the legitimacy people who actually awarded him. The guy needs to move to Venezuela, Cuba, or Greece and maybe he'll finally live in the world he seeks.
B003K16P50|2.0|Is there such a thing as a used ebook?  This product came with highlights already marked and seemed to have a different working process for such, unlike my other ebooks.  It was frustrating moving around in the book. Though the highlights were sometimes what I would have chosen, I prefer to put in my own highlights.<br />The book was OK but I think it makes for a better movie, which I hope to view sometime soon.
B002UPQ1P6|4.0|Twisted Sister what else is there to say ? Half of the songs are done in studio and the other half are done live.  Great live sound.  Some bands don't have that.  Greatest Hits CD's like this one are okay but some songs that aren't included in these collections you might prefer to listen so, so overall I generally don't buy best of CD's.  But TS is a great band.  I would recommend.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game is just outstanding and an amazing app to pass the time. It has missions, side mission, and free-roam in case you want to take a break from the action. I would recommend this app to anybody, even DC fans.
B000008JI1|3.0|With this CD I discovered something.  Original formula always works better.  With Ritchie Kotzen on guitar instead of C.C.Deville it was just a shade weaker.  The original line-up still tours together and I see them as often as I can, you just can't beat them.  While this CD did have a few really good songs, I just couldn't stand behind it.  Of course I have it to complete my collection, but listening to all Poison CD's then listening to this one, you can pick up that something is just off.  Great effort, but original is always better.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think it is a fun game for kids to play in their freetime! I am addicted to Temple Run
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This movie was very good.  Unfortunately however it is a reflection of how life really is.  The good looking guys/girls get everything while the less appealing people, represented in this film by the beast, really don't.  If only it were that easy in real life, but it isn't.  Still, it was great to watch the film and see the way the beast softened his heart and eventually let Belle go, but she came back.  I would recommend this film to anybody, even though it is animated.
B002HFP0QU|5.0|What made the Bee Gees such a long-lasting group was their ability to keep their music evolving.  Their classics from the '60's sound so different from their dance hits from the '70's, which sound so unique from the Bee Gees music of the '80's, '90's up to \\"This is Where I Come In.\\"  This collection is a wonderful trip down memory lane.  No matter how many times I listen to \\"You Should Be Dancing\\" or \\"Stayin' Alive,\\" or \\"Night Fever,\\" I just can't help but feel like dancing.  Their older songs like \\"Words\\" and \\"To Love Somebody\\" and \\"Massachusetts\\" are as great as ever.  The Bee Gees' later songs such as \\"You Win Again,\\" \\"One,\\" or \\"Alone\\" are excellent.  No wonder the Gibb Brothers are members of both the Rock and Roll and Songwriting Halls of Fame.<br />I hope it gives comfort to surviving Bee Gee Barry Gibb to know that his and Robin's and Maurice's music will never be forgotten.

B007FEZQF8|1.0|This is only for the Kindle version of the \\"Walking Dead\\", Despite the Amazon Kindle page for this Kindle book stating, \\"You don't need a Kindle to read this book, read it on your PC now\\", this ebook is available only for download on the Kindle Fire. Bummer - bought this to read on my PC, but that's a no-go, had to request a refund.  Would rather spend the extra $2.00 and buy the actual book anyway.

B005LAIHR2|4.0|I just love this movie! At this time, it is still playing in the theater and I've seen it three times. I'm an 80's kid so, I guess it really speaks to me, but, besides that, the movie just has this energy that pulsates off the screen.<br /><br />Like with all musicals, especially cheesy ones like this, there are some songs I like, and some I don't.<br /><br />But Tom Cruise is wonderful as Stacee Jaxx, the aging heavy metal rock star. I also think the Rolling Stone reporter he falls in love with is absoluetly stunning. I just love her Glenn Close, Fatal Attraction, hair! God, she's hot!<br /><br />Her duet, with Cruise ('I want to know what love is') is so campy, sexy and fun that it hurts! The first time I saw it, I thought it was okay, and rather corny, but the second time, it really grew on me. I got where the film makers were going. The third time, was definitely the charm! I love how the song builds, and their sexual excitement rises! ('Let's talk about...looove! I wanna feel it, too!Wanna feeeel it, toooo!') Yummy. And sort of naughty.<br /><br />Catherine Zeta Jone's 'Hit me with your best shot!' number, set in a church..(!).. to Michael Jackson-style dancing..(!?) is so 'over-the-top' that, after watching it, I had to ask myself, 'Did that just really freakin' happen?' This scene stayed with me way after leaving the theater, causing me to rush back, the next day, to watch it again. I'm not kidding.<br /><br />Jeeze! Holy cow, Batman! Not since 'Xanadu','Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club' 'Earth Girls are Easy' and, yes, 'From Justin to Kelly' has dancing and singing on the silver screen been so strange, and, well, sort of twisted. Almost at times, nightmarish. But, in a good way. Kinda.<br /><br />The scenes with Mary J.Blige singing in her club while strippers dance and twirl on poles behind her to ,'Shadows of the Night' and 'Anyway you want it' has to be seen to believe. It's like a sexed-up circus performance. Two more scenes that had me running back to see it again.<br /><br />The two young leads are so cute and sweet that you can almost smell the cotton candy. Maybe, taste it, too.<br /><br />I just loooove Drew's hair! Sooo thick and wavy like chocolate frosting. And his 'Juxebox Hero' song, in the record store with Sherri, is just way cool and spunky! Love the star-framed shades, boy!<br /><br />I also enjoyed their 'Waiting for a girl like you.' montage as they meet up for their first date behind the famous Hollywood sign. Oh, and Sherri spraying her 'big' hair with Aqua-Net while Drew sprays himself, down....there, with perfume, is pretty darn hot, in a cotton candy kind of way. Shades of 'Grease' come rolling like thunder during these scenes. (Summer Nights, Sandy, Hopelessly Devoted..)<br /><br />The only big gripe I have, aside from the annoying scenes with Stacee Jax's manager, (those scenes really drag down the film's mojo, in my opinion) is, after listening to the movie's soundtrack, I discovered that the 'Rock you like a Hurricane' number, with Jax and Sherri..(!?)..has apparently been cut out of the film! Why!? 'Hurricane' is one of my all time favorite rock songs from the 80's. The song is just so, angry, and...alive! Why remove it from the film but yet have it on the soundtrack? Last minute tampering, no doubt.<br /><br />By the way,is this the infamous scene where Sherri does a lap dance for Tom Cruise that was cut from the movie? And, if it was, where did it fit in with the rest of the story? Did Stacee come to the strip club where Sherri was working? Is it just a fantasy scene? Did it happen early on at The Bourbon Club?<br /><br />Just like Drew shouts in the movie...'I wanna Rock!' 'I wanna know!' What is up with this deleted scene and if it is, the 'Rock you like a Hurricane' number. Is it in the original broadway production? I guess I have to look it up, and do a little research. Unless, someone out there knows and can fill me in. Any feedback on this missing scene, or any others, would be helpful. Thanx....<br /><br />I read somewhere that it will be included on the director's DVD cut, and, well, that's just wrong. It smells like a gimmick to me. Just to make more money. 'Hey, if you want to see Sherri strip for Tom', you have to buy the DVD when it comes out. Boooo! That's pretty lame. Granted, I will be buying the DVD off Amazon when it comes out, it's just, watching the deleted scenes on TV, just isn't the same as watching it up on the big screen.<br /><br />Also, it is a little disappointing that they didn't play the song 'Oh, Sherri' in the movie. (briefly playing the intro while Drew was thinking about Sherri,just didn't cut it for me.) Steve Perry's 'Oh, Sherri' is a song you just don't hear much anymore these days on the radio. It would've been refreshing to hear Drew sing it to his girl, somewhere, sometime in the movie, even if it was just part of the song.<br /><br />Okay...I'm finished. For now. Until I start obsessing over the next poor movie that comes my way. And, I will. Being the movie freak that I am. Thanx for reading..........Kevin BriaN

I have read the 1st 5 books and so far all the books have been riveting and real page turners but my favorite has been The Concrete Blonde.  I found myself really cheering for Bosch and was literally at the end of my seat.  I would highly recommend this book but I recommend that you read the previous leading up to this one, otherwise you will not get the whole picture.

B005SJIP2S|5.0|This recording contains three of the musicians that are responsible for some of the best progressive rock ever recorded.  Chris, Steve and Alan shine, together with a fine keyboard player, a Wakeman( talk about legacy)and a lead singer that comes as close the original singer as you can get. Due to John Anderson and Rick Wakeman's health problems of them not being able to tour, the remaining musicians wanted to keep Yes's music and tradition alive. Yes used this latest incarnation of the band to play songs not played since the Drama tour with, Trevor Horn and Jeoff Downs.<br />Many groups play their live material with much more speed than the original recorded versions, perhaps due to the excitement of playing live, or some even wanting to fill their whole set in an allotted time period. Yes on this recording does play some songs at a slower tempo, which I find refreshing compared to many rushed performances by other groups and some recordings even by Yes. All versions of Yes to tour and for recording have been of the top Progressive caliber and this lineup gets a big thumbs up!

B007ZBWJXI|5.0|I've had a chance to see Asia live twice since they got the original members back together. It's quite a spectacle to watch four tremendous musicians do their thing on stage.<br /><br />Likewise, this CD shows off their talents quite well. They still deliver that full sound Asia is known for, with multi-layer tracking and powerful vocals from Wetton blending nicely. The CD is strong from the start with \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" alongside other standouts like \\"No Religion\\", \\"Bury Me In Willow\\", \\"Faithful\\" and \\"Face On The Bridge\\".<br /><br />I definitely put this well above their most recent studio efforts - \\"Phoenix\\" and \\"Omega\\", both of which I liked but I don't think were as consistently good as \\"XXX\\".<br /><br />Tough to compare, of course, to their multi-million selling debut from 30 years earlier. But this could very well be their best from the original members since that effort.<br /><br />Crank up the headphones and give it a listen - or several - and enjoy!

ISBN-978-1-4391-9281, HC 271 Pgs. in 10\\" x 7 ¾\\"\\" format that includes 12 Pg. Table of Contents and a 4 Pg. Index. Inveiglements include invaluable coloured illustrations by Dave McKean on every page.<br /><br />Author Dawkins, FRS and FRSL is a prolific author with 10 or more prior books. He is an ethnologist & evolutionary biologist holding a Chair on Public Understanding of Science at Oxford and an acknowledged agnostic/atheist. Writing easily read prose, this book \\"Magic of Reality\\" is aimed at explaining science, mystery, illusion, supernormal/natural and miracles to a younger mind-set to provoke challenging thinking by it's readers. His writer interaction prose yields a brisk understanding of his informational-educational materials, loaded with questions and being significantly crisp when evolution/science is discussed to yield a despicable barrage of dissent, harassment, and unkind (if not despicable) disagreements by clergy, religious zealots and a brand of writer hooligans who discovered Dawkins, the scientist and writer and admitted atheist, is not adept at open forum debate. If you disagree with Dawkins, that is one thing, but to take part in character assassination is a different ballgame. And, something I find personally grievous as the Creationist Movement is forcing the removal of both books and teaching of evolution from the classrooms in more states - I hesitate to say any more.<br /><br />\\"This current begins with the discussion of what is reality and covers in scientific terms the answers to who was the first person, why so many animals exist, then delves into the composition of matter, the reason for seasons, the sun, rainbows and concludes with a discussion of when everything started, the origin of life and matter ~ as currently understood ~ and concludes on why things happen, how change, fiction, hoax and miracles can be explained without resorting to \\"supernatural\\" forces, something he'd prefer we admit is yet to be explained.<br /><br />In this book emphasis is firmly placed on belief in the essential concept that evolution occurs during accumulation of \\"small changes\\" in conjunction with the importance of speciation (breed restrictions).<br /><br />Candidly, I believe that one professing to be knowledgeable in evolution should read \\"The Blind Watchmaker\\", but for the younger set of readers, illustrated \\"The Magic of Reality\\" is a wonderful starting point.

Well, folk-pop if you can call it that.<br />It had to grow on me a bit, but that happened very fast, and now I think it's one of the best songs ever penned - up there with Bittersweet Symphony, Yellow, Yesterday, Where the Streets have no Name and Streets of Philadelphia.<br />Definitely going to hunt this album down as the reviews indicate that the other songs are just as good.<br />This is what the world need for a bit now - positive music tinged with melancholy and regret but still happy and content.<br />Good stuff!!

B008FQ0S1W|3.0|When it has came down to George Michael, he musically and personally has had some setbacks the past few years. One of them is his split from his partner Kenny Goss after nearly 7 years together. The other is his battle with a very serious illness that halted his 2011-2012 Symphonica tour. While George did beat his odds from that, he still has a lot to prove musically all over again. Now fully independent, and not relying on any label to release his music. His latest single, White Light brings in George with the electronica elements of his music to a whole new generation. Surprisingly, the song isn't as good as some of his earlier tunes in dance like Outside or 2004's Amazing sounded. Hopefully, George can dust himself off, and maybe bring some new elements into his music for a new generation of fans.<br /><br />Song: C+
B00005Y2EL|5.0|I have always thought of this album as being the best Thin Lizzy has ever made! It is a wonderful record with a variety of themes, outstanding melodic rock and it holds you in its grasp from the beginning right up until the end. Phill's solo projects deserve the same attention. A truly great musician who died too soon!
0374275637|5.0|I learned a lot about the advantages to thinking slow in this book. I use to love my quick intuitive insights and now I enjoy my thoughtful responses. I also appreciated the discussion about the experiencing and remembering selves. I found Kahenman to be very personable and I appreciate his honesty sharing that although he understands the importance of thinking slowly that he still responds quickly. I also found his research examples to be very interesting. I think anyone in marketing, psychology and trading will find this book valuable.
0871404133|5.0|Social Conquest at once presents a groundbreaking scientific analysis of evolution and a strangely enigmatic rumination on our purpose and future on Earth. What you will discover in the text itself and also in the firestorm of reviews (Richard Dawkins in Prospect and in New York Review of Books to name a few) is that contemporary biologists are relegated to living in the shadow of Darwin, who we will still see as the greatest naturalist of the 20th and presumably the 21st centuries. In comparison to what Darwin eloquently and bravely exposed, Social Conquest and other works of Wilson (Dawkins as well for that matter) do not match the standards. Much of the battle between these two great scientific minds (Wilson and Dawkins) could be interpreted as their struggle to claim leadership of bio-evolutionary theory post-Darwin.<br /><br />I will briefly describe what I found to be the most profound ideas in Social Conquest, beginning with his theory of multi-level selection. Other reviewers have commented thoroughly on the extent to which ant behavior is analyzed in this current work. To say that it is a book about Ants, however, is sorely off track. Wilson shares his intimate knowledge of their behavior as an example of Group Selection, the real subject of the fiery scientific debate. Another advantage of using ants as an example is that their social structure is highly complex relative to almost any other species on the planet. Their rich organizational structure provides ample opportunities to anthropormorhpize!  However, to draw parallels from ant society to our own is not to say that humans evolved like ants, but to expose the forces that perhaps drove both species to invest more energy in a society rather than in individual survival.<br /><br />Secondly, we see Wilson's philosophical side emerge in his last hundred or so pages of the text. The discussions are a bit narrow and leave room to be explored further, but I do not see this as a negative. Remaining within hisbounds as a scientist, he provides many valuable insights into the genealogy of religion and the value of morality and honor. Raising mass consciousness to this level would surely be an superlative achievement. However, as Wilson knows all to well, humans want to preserve their status when they have it good, and will ignore their \\"group\\" instincts often to the peril of themselves and anyone else who they drag down. We are at a critical point in history. Mainstream \\"know how\\" and current attempts at \\"fixing the system\\" are ultimately wildly insufficient. What Wilson conveys is that we need fundamental change in order to ultimately embrace our existence as organisms. This step is fundamental to a healthier relationship with not only Mother Earth, but ourselves.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|This game is detailed, with beautiful graphics and challenging gameplay.  You must have an eye for detail and explore every crevice of every scene in order to figure out how to finish the game.  It does get tiring having to run all around the world - the map is helpful in this sense.  For all those who gave it one star because they couldn't figure out how to play it, well, it's touch screen and played like most every other game app - start with an easier game if you need to learn how to move through the world.<br /><br />I agree with another reviewer that the hints, which are nice to have, don't have a save mechanism, so every time you view the hint screen you have to scroll from the top and find your place.  The scenes aren't obvious, the game plays continuously with no breaks yet hints are categorized by \\"scene\\" based on completing certain tasks.  I would not have been able to finish the game without using several hints.<br /><br />Overall a good game, worth the price.  I do wish the ending was more exciting, but it is still a fun game.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a decent app that has lots of simple games to kill time with. you must unlock new games with pts u get by playing the games.
B004FOA84A|3.0|This game is quite simple and a quick play, it only took me about an hour to finish.  It was the first mystery/puzzle game I played on my Kindle Fire, and having now played more difficult versions, this one seems rather elementary.  But the graphics are good, the puzzles are straightforward, and it is easy to navigate.  I did have fun playing it, but it's not one you can play again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The three books of Fifty Shades were very entertaining and kept your interest.  Even though there was a lot of graphic sex the story line was what I liked.  Finding out what made Christian tick and how Anna helped him through all of his hangups kept the reader interested.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it. this game is so addictive.I cant put it down.I need help. lil fab game of year correspond help me
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I have played most of the beginner courses and a couple of the more advanced. So far, its been an awesome game. A ton of courses and lots of achievements to earn. I'll be playing this game for a long time to come. Not sure what it cost normally as I got it as FAOTD, but I'd easily say I'd pay $10 bucks or more. Its the best game I've played on a portable in a long time. Get it, you wont regret it.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|After the fiasco from a couple years ago starring Traci Lords as Dejah, I completely understand why they called it \\"John Carter\\", rather than \\"A Princess of Mars\\". I wouldn't want to chance any confusion either.<br /> The 3D graphics were amazing, and for those who complain it \\"wasn't realistic\\" I'd like to remind you, this is a FANTASY written in 1912. By definition, it is not realistic.<br /> As an ERB and scifi fan, I was totaly taken in and will watch this repeatedly(doubt I'll put in on my phone-that honor goes to Pink Floyd's The Wall). This was my wife's first exposure to ERB besides Tarzan, and the poc with Traci Lords, and she is now planning to load her kindle with everything she can find.<br /> I would recommend this to any and everyone
B007KUFDBY|5.0|I first saw this on dvd. I started crying because it wasn't on Blu-ray. It took a few years but my tears are now dry. Thanks to my Harman-Kardon amp and HSU speakers, my ears are now clear as well. I wish I could thank every crew member. I'd begin with the genius who brought back Edward Everett Horton and named the character Dr. Doppler. How does an in-joke get more clever than that? The nay-sayers can take a journey in the opposite direction; we don't need them. Bravo you eye and imagination filler! Bravo!
B004U52VPS|4.0|My little cousin is addicted, I mean, ADDICTED to Angry Birds. We had an Angry Bird birthday party, and that's all he played the entire time. I am all Angry Bird out. I mean, all that matters is that he enjoyed something that isn't digital. I felt like he was being a real kid, like I used to play with board games. Cool to see that connection with this. I'm sure his parents are happy too so now they can get back their phone for a few minutes. I mean I can't say if this is fun or not, but my cousin plays with it a lot so he must like it. Educational it teaches trajectory and could translate to something in geometry? I don't know. Its a fun toy, not a educational toy. Its high quality, and looks really good. I like it, and i'm sure he likes it too.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|I listened for the third time (so far) to Rush's newest album, \\"Clockwork Angels\\" and I've gotta say, this is by far one of the best pieces of work that they've done. I'd dare to go as far to call it a masterpiece! If they hung it up after this tour they could retire with their heads held high - this album is complex and just rocks and includes some very emotional lyrics. The last song on the album is called \\"The Garden\\" and if one were in a slightly vulnerable mood, it might induce tears. Some of the best songwriting ever. Period. Thank you guys for another gift of fantastic music! I only wish I could see you in concert without having to drive out of state! I've been fortunate enough to see Rush twice in concert, the last time at Summerfest in 2008. Fantastic show and I'm sure the CA tour is as well. Despite the reviews of \\"muddiness\\" I think it's more a case of giving it more listens so the layers can be experienced as one absorbs the entire work. Love the album and even my 14 year old son likes it! It's not the Rush of old but there are several nods to the past, not only musically but conceptually as well. If you don't have it yet, I highly recommend it!
B002YOKVU4|5.0|Lesson well learned: Paranoia rules!  After watching this movie, I will never do drugs again.  I won't even take an aspirin.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Works as advertised. Hourly is helpful, satellite info is great for seeing both what's overhead as well as seeing what 's coming.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The story was amazing.  The book was so well written I did not want to put it down, and just was captivated by the life the book took on.  I could not wait to find out what was going to happen next.  I have not had much time to read having two small children.  A friend recommend this book to me and I was hooked.  I read all three books in 5 days!  I can not wait to see what else E L James writes!
B007SGM084|1.0|I'm neutral in question as to whether the prices are too high - wish they were lower and yet I am still going to buy it since traveling with Kindle is so much easier than taking books.<br /><br />But - note!  The bundle @ $29.99 is more expensive that buying each of the three books seperately.  Not by much, but still, since bundling them is saving Amazon money in transaction costs, download costs, extra income from those who might have bought the first or second then not the third, etc, they should pass on some savings rather than jack up the price.<br /><br />If price was $25 or less I might buy bundle, but now I am going to only buy first book at $9.99 and see if I like it enough to buy second.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I don't usually writing reviews.  However, this author has written such a wonderful book.  It was a true joyride starting with page one.<br /><br />I grew up in this time period.  It brought back such fond memories.  Atari and Commodore were king of the hill.  We couldn't wait for the next game to come out.<br /><br />The plot of good vs. evil tied it all together for me.  Incredible romp through cyberspace.<br /><br />Thank you for putting it all together and allowing me to come along for the awesome joyride!

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I enjoyed the 1st book, was entertained by the 2nd, but sorely disappointed in the 3rd. It felt really rushed, and there were several times I was thinking , \\"Huh? What just happened?\\" And then when a minor character suddenly appears for no real reason and then dies I kept reading on feeling that surely Katniss was dreaming because none of it made any sense. I wasn't hoping for a fairytale ending, just an ending that didn't leave me angry and confused.
1849386684|5.0|A broad spectrum of songs that should address most music tastes. This book is an invaluable compliment to Justin's online beginners course.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a sweet game(s) you will have a lot of fun with it. i recomend this to everyone who likes games. haha
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it. lots variety and major fun. a must have! even for adults... hours of fun. I highly recommend this game
B005JFO6VK|3.0|pros:<br />1. sound proof foam: it is the reason i bought this case, it is supposed to be silent.<br /><br />2. decent price, I paid $55 after rebate<br /><br />cons:<br />1. poor cable management: if you are going to route the cables behind the panel, it will squeeze the foam.<br /><br />2. very poor air flow: the lower part of HDD cage is a disaster, it block half of the air flow, this is a very stupid design flaw. Should use screws to hold it, so the user has choice to use it or remove it to improve the air flow.<br /><br />3. Plastic foot should be replaced with robber foot, so it can reduce some vibration from fans.<br /><br />I will try to post a video to demonstrate its poor air flow and the stupid HDD cage at the bottom.<br /><br />other thoughts:<br />On the description, it says it can have up to 3 x 120mm fans, I don't understand this one. one 120mm fan pre-installed in rear, one 120mm fan pre-installed in front, where to install the 3rd 120mm fan? I am 99% sure there's no way to install 2 x 120mm fans in front because the vent is so small, and there isn't enough screw holes.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|awesome! awesome! awesome! I have fun with it. my kids have tons of fun with it. my 7 year old daughter plays with it all by herself for hours if I let her.
B000F9RB9Y|5.0|This movie is the best scifi movie ever! its got amazing special effects which would impress the effects of today, a 1984 classic must see film, Schwarzenegger at his best :) jim camerons best film ever with titanic a close second!!!! :) and has the fantastic original case on the blu ray edition.

B003Y5H5EW|5.0|Loved this movie. I'm a huge Underworld fan and this is by far my favorite in the series. LOVED IT!!!
B00785P2QC|5.0|I like this game a lot. it's very fun. the only thing I don't like is that you need invest points to buy practically everything. I also don't like how you have to expand your city whenever you run put of space.other than that,  I love this game and if you like city games, this is the game for you.
B0024FA9IM|2.0|Loved the cameo from the original cast<br />Like Gary Oldman's version of Dr Smith..a few good lines....not enough<br />Wont even discuss the actress playing Penny...UG....waste of time<br />The new Robot is a piece of junk...the rebuilted Robot...had some character.<br />The rest...Don ...John and Maureen.....not bad....could be better.<br />Lots of effects..CGI...lots of sets....but script is a little lame.<br />Irwin Allen....we miss your stuff.<br />Good for a view...every 5 years....
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|FINALLY got my Fire and knew I needed to protect it.  I looked at a bunch of covers and this one seemed to meet the need best.  It arrived a couple of days before the Fire and as soon as I hooked the two things up, I knew I made a good choice.  The cover is smooth, easy to use, protects the Fire perfectly but does not get in the way of using it.  High marks for this one.
B005SV9X22|5.0|If you dislike Lady Gaga, watch this. There is so much more to what you think of her. Even if she yells, and is hyped up, there is so much more to her world, than others. Truly a wonderful woman, truly holy.
0345803507|5.0|I ordered all 3 books at one time.  They were packaged nicely & arrrived in just 2 days.  I like that these paperbacks are a little larger so that you aren't struggling to keep the book open.  The story line speaks for it's self :)
B007V508CC|2.0|I've loved Maroon 5 since \\"Songs About Jane\\". . .I'm on my second copy of that album because I wore the first one out!<br /><br />\\"Overexposed\\" is a sad shadow of what this band used to be.  The main reason being it's boring.  Almost all the songs sound the same and they just sound tired, like they're phoning it in.<br /><br />I do like the first song on the album.  I'd also like \\"Payphone\\" if it weren't for the infernal rapping in the middle.  Why is that necessary?  Does Maroon 5 feel the need to prove they have 'street cred'?  It's out of place and unnecessarily profane.  (I take no issue with profanity, but this song is full of it in a way that's not so much \\"artistic license\\" as it is \\"Hey!  Look!  We're so cool!  Look at all the naughty words we use!\\")<br /><br />Unlike a lot of people, I do like the \\"Kiss\\" remake, but those three songs (and \\"Payphone\\" only sometimes) are the only ones I have listened to more than twice.<br /><br />Also, what in the world is the deal with the cover/insert art?  It's atrocious.  A veritable attack on the senses.<br /><br />Please, Maroon 5.  Get it together or stop making albums.
B005K17RU0|4.0|it helps me plan my day. I am constantly on the go and this lets me know what the weather is gonna be like I would recommand it to anyone.
B002S9DRA6|5.0|A thoughtfully chosen collection of the most popular Enigma songs to date + the remixes. Unfortunately for me I have all of the CDs so this was was just purchased to complete my collection (with the exception of \\"The lost ones\\" which is an excellent addition to my collection in its self).
B007SGM084|5.0|I began reading this because all my friends could not stop talking about it.  I am not a big fiction reader, but I bought the trilogy right before going on vacation figuring it would be some mindless reading for the beach.  The first 7 or 8 chapters are kind of slow, but the balance of the book is quite facinating.  Once on the beach, I could not put it down.  I finshed the entire trilogy in a matter of days.  All the \\"facinating\\" stuff aside, it is a good love story.  Some of my friends did not like the ending, but I did.  It put the entire story in perspective.<br /><br />Happy Reading.

B00509CRG6|5.0|Seth Godin has become a staple in my life/library.  I was recommended Linchpin from another person in my creative field (Motion Graphics/Media Arts) and I finally picked up the book.  I also bought the audiobook.  Then purchased other books he wrote.  Then purchased Linchpin for friends and passed them out.  Needless to say, I'm a fan. Pick up the book and read/re-read it.<br />(If you get hung up on the language, I did at times, just pull for the Concepts. They are perfect for moving forward.)
B007D2XSW0|4.0|It's no adobe but as a simple pic editor this app is solid and top notch. I highly recommend it.
0606259090|1.0|SPOILERS<br /><br />I bought this book because of all the hubbub. I really don't get what the appeal is. The plot is a very big pill to swallow.  A 23 year old woman made it through college with no computer and basically no knowledge of sex,then goes from total virgin to an orgasm machine overnight,at the hands of a gorgeous billionaire. If you can choke that down you can then be treated to some poorly written and relatively boring sex scenes.  I personally was disgusted by the concept of a 16 yo boy being sexually used by a woman old enough to be his mother. I was also irritated by the insinuation that being taken as this older woman's sub had helped him overcome his issues from being an abused and neglected child. The idea that the right pedophile could help cure some teenage mental health issues doesn't fly with me. I also could not get into  the erotica, the sex scenes were just not well written, and there was such a domestic-violencey tone to their relationship that any pleasure that could have been had just fell flat.  I was ready to throw the book accross the room when I read the ending. The main character convinces the guy to give her a whoopin ' then throws a giant fit and tells him what a sick perv he is. He never made a secret of  what he wanted so what the....I am guessing that this book simply rose to fame based on whatever loose connections it has to twilight. Wish I would have skipped this one.<br />ETA...from the comments on this book as a Twilight fanfic; the behavior of Christian would be out of character as Edward. While Christian desires to hurt Ana, and makes an effort to isolate her, Edward takes great pains to NOT hurt Bella, and encourages her to stay in school and have contact with her parents and friends ( Jacob being the exception.) I don't think I would have been impressed with this story as fan fiction either.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutely LOVE the Holy Bible by YouVersion.  It has various translations, reading plans, daily reminders, bookmarks, highlights and many more features to aid your bible reading and study.  Not only can you create study notes, you can also share your notes via text, email, facebook, and twitter.  This bible is very easy to read and very easy to navigate between books, chapters and verses.  It also has audio for those times when you can't stop to read.  It is a wonderful app for any android  because it removes the necessity of carrying books.  I highly recommend this app and I cannot say enough good things about it.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|chronicle, to me, was basically everything the trailor said it was...nothing more - nothing less.  it was an entertaining movie and i mean no disrespect by saying it was predictable and followed exactly in tandem the \\"how to write a screenplay\\" formula.  one immediately recognizes the protagonist, antagonist, plot layout, the inevitable climax, and story descention.  however, in this movie, it was not nescessarily a bad thing.  it was refreshing to see a good idea presented without trying to \\"tarentino\\" it up, so-to-speak. would i rent it again? sure - with another person who'd not previously seen it.  by myself?  most-likely not.  but then again, one never knows their own cravings until they do crave (i should copywrite that!).  but seriously, definitely worth the rent/stream.  fun movie.  enjoy...
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Best album since Moving Pictures - I've been a Rush fan since I was 10 with the 1976 release of 2112. I have to say that this album is my favorite since that seminal album in 1981 (Moving Pictures) and really the only one since that time that I listen to the entire album and honestly love every single track. It is a work of art. If you had told me this was some long lost piece originally recorded in that period of '75-82 I would not be surprised. But it is all new original material and I think 20 years from now people will be talking about this album as a classic too. It is hard to believe they created something so original, fresh and at the same time classic and timeless 30+ years after that epic album. But here it is. I was really moved by this album and each track deserves some mention:<br /><br />Caravan - \\"I can't stop thinking big\\"<br />Best opening track since Tom Sawyer, like that song it is a descriptive narrative of the world we are in lit by fire and driven by steamliners, paints a picture of our young hero with big dreams. Great riff. Drives forward relentlessly like the road it describes.<br /><br />BU2B -\\"I was brought up to believe...\\"<br />Title is an acronym for the line bove.....and the people in this world are taught to blindly follow and do as they are told. Starts slow with an intro and then rocks onward driving the narrative.<br /><br />Clockwork Angels - \\"You promise every treasure, to the foolish and the wise, Goddesses of mystery, spirits in disguise\\"<br />Best song on the album, Neil Peart at his best, musical and melodic interludes interspersed with a driving bass and drumline chorus, this will be a concert favorite. Gives a vivid picture of soaring over grandiose cities in a distant land.<br /><br />The Anarchist - \\"What I know, I've never shown; what I feel, I've always known\\"<br />The only less than stellar track on the album, still enjoyable though, a straightforward rocker. Takes a while to get to the lyrics. Maybe it will grow on mein time. The hero is fighting alone against the machine, refusing to believe that this is the way it has to be.<br /><br />Carnies - \\"Sometimes the angels punish us, by answering our prayers\\"<br />After a scene setting  carnival sound intro - an infectious rocker with a great chorus. Our hero joins the circus to get away, but is blamed for a criminal act and is cast out himself.<br /><br />Halo Effect - \\"Fool that I was, A goddess, with wings on her heels, All my illusions projected on her,  The ideal, that I wanted to see\\"<br />The most emotional and deep Rush song in recent memory. A sad song but very memorable, a great rock ballad.  He idealizes a beautiful goddess he sees and is crushed by a love lost and a cruel world.<br /><br />Seven Cities of Gold - \\"a man can lose himself in a country like this...\\"<br />Great opening bass line, screeching guitars and drums giving it rhythm leading into a soaring rocker. He is thinking about the past failures and the dreams he once had.<br /><br />The Wreckers -  \\"All I know is that sometimes you have to be wary\\"<br />A cautionary tale with a catchy riff, 2nd best song on the album, like no Rush song I can ever remember, at the same time it feels familiar but is totally unique. Beautiful imagery throughout, you can feel the ocean and salty air as our hero is aboard a ship in a storm facing possible doom.<br /><br />Headlong Flight - \\"I learned to fight, I learned to love, I learned to feel, How I wish that I could live it all again\\"<br />A reeling rocker with a real sense of urgency, sure to be a concert favorite with a driving beat and soaring vocals and guitar riffs. It's the end of the journey for the hero who has regrets and must leave behind youthful idealism for the realities of the world he is in.<br /><br />BU2B2 - \\"Life goes from bad to worse. I still choose to live\\"<br />An interlude at best, leading to the closing tracks...his optimism is gone, but he keeps going forward...<br /><br />Wish Them Well - \\"All that you can do is wish them well, Even though you're going through hell\\"<br />A catchy rocker, modern in feel, this could easily have been a Foo Fighters song. He has learned not to dwell on the negative or let it affect you, just move on...<br /><br />The Garden - \\"It is what it is\\"<br />A fitting closing number in which you step back and realize its ok to dream, time is not the enemy because it is what you do with the time you have that matters.  Starts slow and builds to a soaring crescendo, very melodic throughout.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this game is awesome and one time I glitched so I had unlimeted money and the gold coins with 200 marble thingys
B006RUJST6|2.0|I was looking for a quick read and that's what I got, but I almost gave up several times because the writing is SO poor. The characters and plot are over dramatized and unrealistic. I only kept reading to find out how it ended.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I skipped over this book many times thinking I wouldnt like it, Then one day I decided to give it a shot. I loved this story, I liked the charactors, and I couldnt put it down
1466401885|2.0|So this book drew me in because it was on the NY times bestsellers for my kindle. When I first started to read it, I really enjoyed it. I enjoyed Travis's and Abby's friendship, because it was quirky and obviously something was there. I wanted them to be together, but when it got to about half way in the book, my feelings changed about Travis. At first I loved him, but then he became weird. Okay, the nickname Pigeon was cute, even though some disagree. But the fact that he got her named tattoed on her and ALREADY HAD A RING READY blew my mind. When he first brought her home stuff, I thought it was cute. When I got to the second half of this book it became creepy. he was obsessed with owning her, and in the end she was okay with that. I don't understand them. I don't know how Travis was a fighter and a total ladies man, and then this regular girl comes around he's a total baby. I also think Abby should have died in the fire, and then there was a section from Travis's point of view. Actually, I wish There was a point of view from Travis throughout the entire thing, to try and help me understand that he wasn't just a controlling lunatic. I would have liked the ending better if it was an unrealistic happy ending. Something should have happened that made Travis change his ways, not get what he wanted witha girl he's co-dependent on.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|Handy little pocket tool but don't expect it to put a shaving edge on your blade as the honing blades aren't set at that angle. But it will definitely restore a good utility edge to your pocket folder or even a small belt knife. The pointy little rod sharpener is supposed to be for sharpening scallop-edged blades. I have yet to see one that actually works and this is no exception. However, that being said, it will put a reasonable edge to an axe when used in a file type motion and I use it as a mini marlin spike all the time to loosen up knarly knots. So it resides as a permanent resident in my right hand pocket along with the AK-47 clip folder.

1594203334|5.0|I loved this book, it was funny, and so very informative. Many of the suggestions for getting better and more cooperative behavior from children are fairly close to the way parents before the sixties raised children. My mother had the look. lol. It worked on all of us kids. The \\"look\\" is better than a thousand words. My dad had his own look, perplexed, and disappointed, also very effective. If you are looking for help on raising more polite, and well adjusted, children, this is the most sensible book to read. If there's anything to reincarnation, I want to come back as a French child that gets to eat the great food they serve at their schools. The menu for American schools is disgusting and very unhealthy, never mind unappealing looking. When I visited France, the food was fantastic.
B005FPT51K|2.0|I like having this camera very much. The software is iOS or browser based. The iOS app has improved dramatically over the past few months and is now very solid and responsive. The browser view is functional, but not great.<br /><br />The major downside of this camera for me is that it doesn't support IPv6, although that could probably be corrected with a firmware update.<br /><br />Update:<br /><br />When I first purchased this camera I was very pleased with it. We've now had it for almost two years now. Here's what I've learned while using it.<br /><br />* The app is very flakey. Through OS upgrades it had compatibility issues several times and sometimes took a month or more before an update was available that corrected the problem.<br />* The app is prone to crashing<br />* The app controls are difficult to use. Sometimes screen widgets don't respond, sometimes it takes several taps. Sometimes the control's state and visible state get reversed (it will be on when shown as off, and off when shown as on).<br />* The camera is no longer discoverable from the app. I don't know if this is a problem with the app or the camera. I can still use the web view but the app is now useless.<br />* The manufacturer has never provided a firmware update for the camera, so still no IPv6 support.<br /><br />If you have the ability, I highly recommend getting a Raspberry Pi with a camera connector board. It's cheaper, works better and lasts longer. If that's not your thing, I still discourage buying this camera. Look for a better brand, hopefully one that will last longer.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I couldn't put this book down! I read this and it's sequel in two days, and loved every minute of the ride. :)
B0050VFRVG|5.0|Percy is a young boy trying to find his way in the world while discovering his best friend is a satyr and his father is a god. When he discovers his true nature everything changes for Percy.  He embarks in a difficult quest to stop war and redeem himself after been wrongly accused of thievery.  The quest becomes a metamorphosis for Percy; he discovers a new inner force, new abilities and affinities, stronger friendships and finds a new kind of empowerment to change his life and his mother's. At the end of this hero's quest we find a different Percy. His experiences have changed him but also all those around him.<br /><br />This young adult fantasy draws from Greek mythology in an innovative way. It proofs an excellent choice for readers of all ages. Riordan made a great job creating this world of adventure for Percy. The book is surprising, entertaining and well written. We will see what else brings this hero's saga.<br /><br />About the book:<br />This paperback versions of this series are really affordable.  This version has a nice cover and the image makes you wonder about this kid, who he is and simply ask yourself: why is someone going to steal a lightning?  This series is wonderful and accessible to readers from middle school up.
B003L77G8I|1.0|The DVD was listed as \\"like new\\" but the DVD skips and it came in a strange case. The first disc in the case skipped terribly. The first episode played with a few skips, but the second and third episodes were not worth trying to watch. It skipped every 10 seconds. As for the case, it wasn't the orgiinal - it is made of cheaper material, the front cover was taped on, and it holds 8 DVDs, not 6. None of the DVDs fit neatly into the case.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|Yeah I have played this game time and time again. Too bad it seems to stop Downloading to my phone an error pops up. I thought my phone wasn't compatible or not enough memory but not the case. The download app keeps popping up for most games. Have it on my computer.
B00000613T|2.0|Mahler's ninth symphony is one of my favorite pieces of music. I have listened to many recordings, and this is not one that I find very likable. It's a shame, because the first, second, and third movements are all gripping and lush, but the Adagio (final movement) made me very disappointed. Make note, this review is focusing exclusively on the fourth movement.<br /><br />I like the movement to be taken very slowly, around 45 bpm, while Boulez's interpretation seems to be closer to or in excess of 55. You may say, \\"well, 10 bpm isn't much of a difference!\\" But, let me assure you, the difference is immediately noticeable. At the tempo it's taken, I feel the phrases don't speak very well, and the performance is significantly less dramatic, intense, and breathtaking than it could have been.<br /><br />What I actually found amusing, is during the glorious horn solo (you know the one), the principle horn player actually plays at about 45, and the orchestra accommodates as if planned (which it very well could be), but then the moment it is finished, the tempo jumps back up to 55-ish. I don't know if the musician was intentionally slowing the tempo (unlikely), or whether it was supposed to be that way, but it sounds bizarre to me.<br /><br />I do acknowledge, however, that because the reason for me finding the performance dissatisfying is purely a tempo issue, it is possible you may like it. My performance of choice is Riccardo Chailly and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra: [[ASIN:B0002VDYOQ Mahler: Symphony No. 9]]
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Downloads apps slowly and continuous errors towards end of downloads. What more can I say, some technical tweaking is definitely needed.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|This dvd set is awesome. Waiting for second season to come out very impatiently. Good story and one of my favorite animes now.
B007MDB71O|3.0|After reading the five John Carter books written by Edgar Rice Buroughs, I was not impressed at all with the movie.  It may have been technologically sound; but, it did not follow the books very much.  If they would have made this film in two or three movies it would have been much better.  Too much of the classic novel's material was deleted!  This was not even a \\"Reader's Digest\\"-type version...
0451457994|4.0|When I first saw the film version, I didn't like it, I thought it was slow, it didn't have enough character development in it, and I also thought the end was confusing, but it did have some things to offer. I certainly thought it had a good story and plot to tell, and I thought many of the concepts in it were good. So when I found out they made a film sequel \\"2010: The Year We Make Contact\\", I decided to give it a look, and I loved it. Unlike the first film, I did not think it was slow, and it was a lot clearer, and cleared up a lot of the mysteries left at the end of the first film. After watching \\"2010\\" I decided to give \\"2001\\" another try, and although I still think it's slow at times and it could have been better, I do like the first film now. Then I decided to read the novel, and I think the novel is even better than the film.<br /><br />There are some distinct differences between the film and the novel, most of them I think made the novel better. The man-apes at the beginning go though a lot more in the novel than in the film, there's more character development between them (although trying to do that in a film wouldn't have worked given that they are primitives that can't speak, but in the novel it works great), you actually see what the alien Monolith does to them, you see them gradually becoming more and more human after their encounter with the Monolith, and you see them confront the leopard that has been terrorizing them before they confront the rival man-ape tribe. There's more character development involving Dr. Floyd, Frank Poole, and Commander David Bowman. Our characters have more emotion in this novel rather than being almost completely emotionless as in the film. The novel is a lot clearer than the actual movie. It goes into more detail about the race who constructed the Monoliths. And I found the part where the computer Hal-9000 malfuntions and starts killing the crew more suspenseful than in the film. And instead of the Discovery spacecraft going only to Jupiter as in the film, it goes to Jupiter and Saturn, and it's Saturn where Bowman encounters the second Monolith, not Jupiter as in the film. The only thing I actually liked better in the film was the part were Hal overhears Bowman and Poole ploting against him. Hal's discovery of their intentions to disconnect him are played out differently in the novel.<br /><br />Like the film though there are some parts that seem slow which is why I'm giving the novel four stars instead of five, but overall, I thought the novel was much better and a lot more suspenseful than the film. I really enjoyed reading this and I think any other sci-fi fan will too.<br /><br />Highly recommended!only to Jupiter as in the film, it goes to Jupiter and Saturn, and it's Saturn where Bowman encounters the second Monolith, not Jupiter as in the film.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|With all the hype surrounding this trilogy I was expecting something amazing!! I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the writing and the story as a whole.<br />If<br />You've read the Twilight series you'll find multiple similarities.
0345529057|5.0|I really enjoy the series, but the price was what did it for me, I saved like 15 bucks with this deal. thanks Amazon you guys rule!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a overall quality game. The graphics are surprisingly stunning and the gameplay is smooth. I must say, the game is kinds scary because demon monkeys are chasing after you, so at points of the game I start freaking out from the suspense. But I just love that about this game. I definitely recommended this game for anyone and so far no problems on my Kindle have occurred. Great game!
B002T9H2MO|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie and think it's fantastic. I didn't know anything about it before I watched it and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I appreciate the homages to other films (Blade Runner, Alien, and 2001 among them) and think that this ranks certainly in the top ten sci-fi movies I've seen. And Sam Rockwell's performance is spectacular; the film is essentially his and his alone and he does a masterful job at negotiating the main character.<br /><br />This is a beautifully shot film, with a slow pace that builds up over time to create a stellar film.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I purchased this album for 99 cents on a whim. I liked the blue-grassy sound in the preview and thought why not. May be, hands down, the best buck I've ever spent. The music is as good as I hoped (I'm not necessarily a big bluegrass fan, but enjoy it when I hear it). However, the lyrics, poetically and playfully exposing the melody are really exceptional. Simply excellent. Can't stop listening. Highly recommended.
B0086700CM|3.0|its kind of fun at first but there is no end 2 it and u get bored fast at running from ugly monker creatures and the other players cost WAY 2 much!!! do not get this if u want 2 b kind of amused 4 15ms and then hats it D:(
B004I744AS|5.0|I found this to be an easy and informative dictionary.  Many of the dictionaries out here are very clumsy in use.  This book works fast and helps you along the way.  I highly recommend it.
030758836X|3.0|To be fair, overall this book was an enjoyable read.  My biggest grips are the mid novel \\" surprise twist\\" and the last quarter or so of the book.  With respect to the \\"surprise twist,\\" if the \\"twist\\" surprised you, you were not paying attention.  I saw it coming, maybe not all the details, but it was not surprising in the least. In fact, I thought it was obvious.  As for the last quarter of the book, I thought there were too many holes in the story.  I will not go into details, but the reader must suspend their disbelief in order to buy the resolution (and I am not talking about the ending).  There are just too many gaps, and the reader has to believe in the absurd, along with a character being extraordinarily lucky (not smart), to find the resolution believable. Then there is the ending.<br /><br />I actually did not mind the ending, but it is how Ms. Flynn gets there that let me down as a the reader.  I will read Ms. Flynn's next book because I liked her first two books, and this book had glimmers of greatness. Greatness not fully realized, but greatness nonetheless.<br /><br />As an aside, I thought a modified version of this story would make a good story arc for AMC's The Killing, if it comes back for a third season.
030758836X|2.0|Clearly I am in the minority on this one, and usually I am in sync with good reviews.  This book is my first exception to that - at 100 pages in I just wasn't hooked on the story.  The writing (while good) almost seemed too slick or too cute in areas and to me the main characters were all too much alike.  I didn't see a defined difference in the way they talked or how they thought.<br /><br />I wanted to like this book...really...but it turned out being the first one in years that I only managed to get halfway through before giving up out of boredom.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game I am 15 and still love it ha h's ha ha great for kids too!!!!!!!!! ha it is great
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|I was very surprised on how this movie turned out. I thought it was going to be horrible but i was 100% wrong. I overlooked this movie hundreds of times, It had funny parts good story.  acting was great and good story line, this movie is very creative and well but together from the action to horror. love it.
B006OB3K56|5.0|A well-acted and engrossing drama about addiction. In this case the addiction isn't alcohol or drugs but sex.<br />Sex never seemed more un-sexy.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|This was an excellent movie. I purchased it so I could watch it over and over. Every father needs to see this so they can be a role model for their kids. Teenage boys need to watch it as well!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of the best games ever. anyone who plays it will love it. get this app. you will never delete it. it is NOT going to be a waste of space.
1401225756|5.0|I've never been a comic book person before. In fact, I can't remember having read another one before this.  Someone sent me Gaiman's graduation speech, and I decided I had to check it out. I absolutely loved it!  I had a hard time putting it down, and I can't wait to get the next.
B003AVPV1O|4.0|It's a VGA splitter and it is what it is. The connections are nice and sturdily made and the wire is well insulated. I used it to split the signal between my 46'' 1080P Panasonic Plasma and my Samsung 24'' LCD monitor. Before I purchased this product I should have researched a little more. I had to lower the resolution on the computer to get a proper signal to my t.v. so both the t.v. and the monitor had a significant loss in picture quality and size. That is no fault of the cable. I'm now using it to split the signal between my LED and LCD monitors. I noticed a slight drop in brightness in both monitors and hence could only give this product a 4 star rating.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I must admit, I was not sure I wanted to read this novel at first, given its heavy subject matter, but now I am truly happy I did. Greens characters were so like able and realistic that I couldn't help but wish they were my actual friends. His skillful writing had me laughing, crying and just about everything in between. I would highly recommend this book to anyone and everyone. This story will stay with me for a long, long time. In my eyes it is literary perfection.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great Sim that builds on the original concept. waiting for energy keeps you from playing indefinitely. hope more updates keep coming.
0895260131|5.0|Have read other books on Islam by Robert Spencer.  This book did not disappoint.  Suggest reading this book and all others by Spencer and Bridget Gabriel, who grew up with \\"peaceful\\" Muslims transforming Lebanon to Islam.  Great detail and knowledge of a cancerous threat to America and the world.  One of the cardinal rules of warfare is \\"Know Thy Enemy\\".  Book provides detail and interesting comparsion between Islam and Christianity.  One commands to kill others so you can go to heaven.  The other belief commands to love thy neighbor so you can both go to heaven.  Guess which is which!!!  There are many threats to American values.  Islamization of Western world and america is right there at the top with Socialism/Progressivism/One Worlders/UN.  Political Correctness tells us that Islam is a peaceful religion; that only a very small percentage of Islams are radical, violent terrorists.  Compare to US military....only a very small percaentage actually pull triggers.  the vast percentage of any war machine are the support functions.  You don't see the \\"peaceful\\" Muslims denouncing the every day radical Islamic violence around the world.  Muslims in America are breeding at 8:1 compared to Anglo/Caucasion/Christians 1.7:1.  If the small percentage of violent Muslims remains constant, the raw number of violent terrorists among us will grow compounded at that birthrate.  Wish my investments could grow at that rate!!!!  Wherever the Muslim percentage of the population grows, the violence and intolerance grow in direct proportion.  Check  out Denmark, France, England, and the list goes on and on.  If you love America, Politiccal Correctness should mean defending and upholding the Constitution and Bill of Rights (as written; as timeless standards, values).....ALL else is TREASON!!!.  Great book, highly recommended.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I absolutely love this game. If you're an insomniac or just love picross like games this is a must have. It's definitely worth the price
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've won every game. Not very challenging. I do like being able to change the background and decks. Good job.
1612130283|1.0|So yeah, I'll admit it: I read \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" because I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, and I still don't get what the fuss is about. Because they put a semi-respectable cover on a really poorly written romance novel? Because \\"Twilight\\" fans entered puberty? If you are also curious, let me save you some time: the plot is really dumb, and the sexing gets like, super repetitive after a couple chapters. She totally never finds a bunch of dead bodies in his closet or anything. And they all live happily ever after.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|A bit pricey but this app packs a lot of challenge in its seemingly simple puzzles. And the developers continue to add new puzzles with each update. I definitely recommend this to those who enjoy crosswords and sudoku.
0062213423|5.0|So first of all I would like to say that I'm a massive One Direction fan. I finally got a chance to purchase this book, and it came exactly when it was said to! It came only just yesterday and I've already finished reading it once! It features all the boys talking about generally the same things, but from their different perspectives. The book also includes many glossy pictures! Truthfully, a lot of the stuff I already knew, being such a dedicated fan, but others I didn't. The boys make some jokes too that got me laughing while reading! I would say this is a worthwhile buy for any person who is even remotely a fan of One Direction. By the end of it, you'll probably love them as much as all the hardcore fans out there, if not you'll just massively respect them. This boys share a lot about their personal lives in Dare To Dream, and they make themselves really relatable too!
B007JRU2UK|1.0|This was a really boring, depressing and slow movie. I stopped watching close to the ending. Very depressing. A friend of mine was the husband of the couple he was friends with, which kept me watching as long as I did.
B0018RWMNM|5.0|I just bought this blu-ray  edition as I have the entire 4 disc collection and the DVD quality of Lonesome Dove, only the best movie ever, is not as good as the three newer ones. This blu-ray edition is way better quality of a picture than the DVD, very clear. Get a lot of popcorn, run time is 373 minutes
034580404X|4.0|A little embarrassed to admit that these books are addicting. A safe way to peek at a forbidden world. Can't wait for the movies!
B007FZ7R7W|3.0|When I'm cruising with my woman in my Lambo, I often regret that I don't hve any new jams to listen to as I smack her upside the head.  My prayers have been answered.  Thanks Chris Brown!  What do you tell a lady with 2 black eyes?  Nothing.  Fortune by Chris Brown already told her twice!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game.  I tried several solitaire apps and this one is the best. Great graphics and customization. I really enjoy it.
B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|In no way does this rating reflect the show or Amazon itself.<br />I bought the DVDs from Amazon through Great Alexander. When I received the DVDs the packaging was all bent up. I don't know if the packaging was like this already or if it occurred in the shipping process, (but the packaging on my other Doctor Who DVDs I have bought from Amazon before were in great condition when I received them). Upon further inspection, 5 of the 6 discs had major typos of the episode titles. The proof of purchase was also missing from the packaging. The video quality itself was perfect, but it turns out that in a fluke thing, I got a bootlegged copy of the series. Great Alexander customer service then contacted me and said they would send me a brand new copy of the series, which I received the next day. I am very impressed with the company's customer service. They fixed the problem quickly and efficiently and I am pleased with the results.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I don't normally read romance or erotica, however there was so much hoopla over this book I had to see what all the fuss was about for myself. That's all I can say was it was \\"ok\\". I will not be running out to read the second book. It basically  follow's the Twilght theme: the girl gets involved with a good-looking, dangerous \\"monster\\" and wants so bad for him to be the perfect man for her. I gave this four stars becasue the book is interesting, however it ended like a soap opera.
B007PVHBHC|5.0|This is a recording of extraordinary complexity, poetry and musicianship, yet one that maintains a intrinsic beauty that doesn't require any effort to enjoy. I don't think the energy on this can be compared to anything in her earlier years, nor should it be judged that way. While other punk icons of her time - Iggy Pop for example, are recording lame covers, Patti is still creating great works of art.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|this app is not good first of all you have to buy games with coins. the games r kind of stupid and they don't even tell u how to play the game so yea I wouldn't recommend downloading this app cuz all it does is waste space { :(
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This one is just the right fit for the Kindle Fire.<br />Saves the Fire from small bumps / scratches.<br />The elastic band is nice and gives the package a folio like feel, also helps to tug back the cover while reading.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|*****The maze runner is about a teenage boy Thomas who wakes up in a box with no memory and delivered to a glade with other teenagers....but they are surrounded by a maze! Yes a maze...how `bout that.  Although it is much more than what meets the eye.  The maze moves every night and the gates open at dawn and close at dusk.<br /><br />At first....I was wondering, \\"Why am I reading this\\"?  Well, the answer came in the middle of the book because there was nonstop suspense and cliffhangers at the end of chapters.  By \\"non-stop\\" mean that at the end of every chapter there is some sort of twist where you say, \\"WHAT!!\\" which makes you so sucked into the book that you keep continuing even though you told yourself five minutes ago, \\"I'll stop at that next chapter\\".  Who else does that....anyone....well maybe just me?  Anyways I actually ended up stopping in the middle of chapters to calm the \\"cliffhanger-anxiety\\".<br /><br />What intrigued me most however was how COMEPLETELY AWESOME the characters were......*cough* Minho*cough**cough*.  Then there's Ben......wOW.....what a chapter!  Disregarding that...Thomas the protagonist had those epic moments where you're like, \\"YES!\\" and so on.  Teresa was very creepy to me but you eventually warm up to her.  Teresa is a character who has very unexpected arrival and....not to spoil but an \\"attachment\\" to Thomas if you will.<br /><br />Anyway, THIS IS A MUST READ!!!<br /><br />Well done Dashner and I read your sequels with the same opinion.<br /><br />This has been my favorite book, and when I recommended it to my friends, I received a positive feedback.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Fun game that keeps you addicted. It is fun and challenging to try and achieve all the goals. Game is also great for younger kids to play.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|So, I read a lot of erotica - and, as an author myself of [[ASIN:B00865ZZ5Q XXX College Erotic Stories - Volume I]] I have to say these books are interesting reads.  Frankly, the sex scenes, while outside of the \\"mainstream\\" are not written with the explicitness of many other books in the genre.  So, I found myself initially amused by them, then a bit bored by them.  But, nonetheless, I found myself reading all three of these books in the span of about one week.
B005V20JKI|5.0|Kind of strange to have a Knight fighting bad guys to save muffins but it is highly entertaining and also fun for kids.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it and my kids love it. we usually play together! perfect for rainy days or car rides! even got my sister and sisterinlaw hooked. yea its a little like farmville, but I love it anyway!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Fun addicting game that allows you to use your mind. Kind of like visual sudoku. Lots of puzzles and new updates include more puzzles.
B0086700CM|3.0|The game gets really fast so its really hard! On the ipod I have a score of almost 3 million and on here its almost 350,000 but a fun and addicting entertainment!
1401937519|5.0|This little book is filled with so much truth. If you are at all tempted to learn more about what lies beyond this dimension and how this knowledge can help you live your life here and now then read this book. Truly inspirational without trying to convert the reader in any way. A remarkable story that gave me great comfort, hope and joy!
B008764ZQ4|5.0|First off, I know nothing about the movie or musical. I purchased this album with some MP3 credit that was soon to expire. I saw Catherine Zeta Jones on TV previewing her take of Hit Me With Your Best shot and was pretty impressed. I was also pretty excited to see some seasoned singers like Mary J Blige on the artist list as well as some surprises like Tom Cruise and Russell Brand so I decided to use my credit on this album while it's discounted.<br /><br />The album is pretty impressive if you remember who is singing. These are actors and actresses and not career singers so it's a fun listen when you realize who is singing. If you can't stand cover songs, stay away and buy the original versions. For the most part, the songs stay pretty true to the original. I wouldn't stay any of the songs are 'butchered' though the mashup of More than Words/Heaven was a bit strange to me. On top of the great songs and the great singing, you get TWENTY tracks!<br /><br />As someone who is, again, unfamiliar with the movie/musical, I'd recommend a listen... especially at it's current price of 2.99
B0027MJU00|5.0|I loved and hated this book like watching a train wreck in slow motion and screaming inside. SO much darker than I can handle and yet I couldn't stop reading. Psychologically dead on, and I say that as a therapist--Libby Day is one disturbed cookie, and so are her pals and her family.<br />Ugh! Don't think I'll ever read another Gillian Flynn...and don't think I'll ever forget this one.<br />She deserves 5 stars for that.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|There is a reason this game is ranked so high. It is fun. Easy to play and moves through to new course, as long a you can play well.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I picked up The Fault in our Stars by John Green because of several recommendations by various friends. This was the first of John Green's books I've ever read and it is now one of my favorite books of all time. Green not only told a story about the love between Hazel and Augustus, but also confronted bigger issues than I expected him to. This novel was so deep, elaborate, and vibrant, which I never expected it to be. I cried and laughed along with the characters. Though one of the big things in the novel is cancer, the story of Hazel and Augustus overpower it. The story simply becomes the love story between two young people who try to live their lives to the fullest while they still can. I love this book and cannot say enough praise about it.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I hadn't watched this in years and, to be honest, I was somewhat trepidatious about how it would hold up. As it turns out I should have known better; it's every bit the smart, emotive powerhouse I remembered, and miles better than most modern efforts in the same niche. One of the things I find most impressive about it is the respect it maintains for the original, where most sequels of this type (including T3 and Terminator Salvation) can't wait to distance and differentiate themselves from their lineage. Even though the first Terminator had aged quite a bit in the seven years between films, T2's sharp, daring script constantly cites events, characters and situations from its timeline like a religious zealot thumping the bible. It also builds directly upon the dark, challenging themes and premonitions of its predecessor, resulting in a towering, substantial world that seems so real I could almost touch it. Of course, I'd be silly not to mention the still-spectacular action scenes, which flawlessly build in size and scale until they reach a timely crescendo at the end of the third act. CGI was still in its infancy in the early '90s, but James Cameron's knack for its timely, appropriate application is already at veteran levels in T2. As a direct result, those infamous scenes with a transmorphing T-1000 remain striking and impressive, where other effects of the period now seem clunky and unrealistic. Not only is it one of the best sequels ever, it's among the very best of the batch in multiple genres, and Arnold has never been more at-home in a character. This is an old ride that's aged like wine.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really enjoyed the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy! I wasn't sure before reading the first book because I had heard many negative reviews. If you enjoy a love story/romance novel you would probably enjoy these books!
B007SGM084|5.0|This book series was absolutely AMAZING! Everything I could ever want in a book! I laughed, I cried, I got mad, I was amused and aroused! It was great!<br />My husband said he loved the books and never had to read a page lol
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I feel like I need more of this book! A awesome and easy read, I loved the fighting and the poker background I thought they added a nice twist to the book! I'd just recommend you to buy it!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'm not a terribly fussy reader.  I love a good trashy novel like no other.  The fact was, that this book is laughably bad.  It's just terrible.  Honestly...the first chapter is decent-ish as far as the writing goes, and then it goes so far downhill that you wonder if a kid wrote it.  Lip biting, inner goddess, Jeez, Oh my...GOOD GOD! This book is like a drinking game!!  I'm not into BDSM at all...but I've come across it before and knew what to expect so nothing really shocked or titilated me. The main character, Ana, is likeable enough...but I don't understand how anyone could possibly mistake this book for anything other than really BAD fan fiction, or for a romance??? There is NOTHING romantic about the relationship between these two characters!  Christian Gray isn't a guy to lust after...he's a guy to AVOID.  It's no wonder so many of my friends have deep seeded relationship problems, if THIS is the ideal guy!  I'm not even talking about his bedroom habits....he's just thoroughly repulsive unless being stalked and controlled is your thing. BUT...if you want to read a scene that's hilarious, might I recommend the scene where he asks her if she's on her period, she says yes....and THEN HE TAKES OUT HER TAMPON and proceeds to ride the red river!  SOOO SEXY AND HOT, AMIRITE?  I regret wasting my time reading this, and I think all my friends who recommended this to me are seriously sheltered and/or warped and/or freaks.
B008COD5OO|1.0|Thought this was gonna be funny based on previews . It was not. at all. period.  Turn on MTV springbreak and you will see the movie for free.
B008D563IC|5.0|This is what should be in the trilogy. I saw Band Camp, The Naked Mile... all those other spin offs. They were made to cash in on what was a GREAT movie, American Pie. Well this is the latest in the series and its hilarious. It also has some good plot lines that a lot of us can relate to, which makes it interesting to watch.

B004UUKD6W|5.0|If you are a fan of Queen and have never checked out this album, YOU MUST DO SO!!! Queen made their debut album, which merely introduced the world to a brand new sound.  Then, followed up with Queen II, totally mind blowing, heavy, different. The 3rd album that a band puts out usually is difference in making a long career for themselves or fading out and people saying \\"I really liked those first two albums, what happened?\\"...<br /><br />Well, Queen hit a home run with their 3rd.  They continued the eerie, weird, different, yet heavy sound of the first two and added in elements never heard before - see Tenement Funster, Flick of the Wrist... Brian May really opened things up on Queen II, but on this release - it seems like his guitar leads are non-stop.<br />Needless to say, they kept kickin butt for years to come.  God Save the Queen!!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|So I finally broke down and bought the book that absolutely everyone was talking about; I just had to see what the big deal was. I don't know which chapter I got to before I finally turned off my Kindle in disgust. I returned it for a refund this morning.<br /><br />I've read a lot of books (and I mean a lot), but this is by far the worst thing I've ever read. It reads like bad fan-fiction written by a 15 year old girl, who simply had a thesaurus on the desk and someone else's smut filled fan-fiction open on an internet page.  I got so tired of reading about Ana \\"biting her lip\\" and her \\"medulla oblongotta\\". I would really hope that there aren't girls like her in the world; girls who see their \\"inner goddess\\" doing the merengue or who would be so obsessed with a man like Grey. She has to be the most pathetic creature I have ever read about. Grey is simply a freak...he says that he doesn't do certain things, i.e. sleep with girls, introduce them to his mother, have vanilla \\"relations\\", yet he does every one of them within days of meeting this pathetic girl.  If his convictions were so strong, why in the world would he crumble like a cheap cookie? And I mean, come on...a gorgeous billionaire falling for a plain jane girl who can't put one foot in front of the other...oh wait...never mind I forgot this was completely ripped off from Twilight.<br /><br />My suggestion is, if you want to see what the big deal is, go down to the bookstore, pick up a copy, and flip through the first few chapters. If you aren't rolling your eyes and snorting in disgust, go ahead and buy it....more power to you. Better yet, go read some good smutty Twilight fan-fiction.  You get the same story, probably with better writing, and you save yourself $10-$20.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game, it's very fun and addictive.  Unfortunately I defeated it in a day,  and got all the accomplishments and beat it a second time within  the next week.  I bought this version after playing the trial computer version, figuring I would spend more time playing on the tablet.  I was hoping it would have the same features as the computer version, especially the endless survival mode and the Zen garden.  I am hoping these will come in an update, but honestly I would buy the whole thing again for these features.
B004GUSG4M|2.0|More of a teen book, silly use of the f word not needed but used for shock value.  Could guess the end before page 25.  Disappointing because it had a good beginning.  Felt the writing was very  amateurish.
B007PKOKTK|5.0|My granddaughters loved it, it was a modern day easter movie...they watched it several times.  They are 2 and 3 yrs old.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|My best friend insisted that I read this book, as it made everyone she knows \\"incredibly horny.\\" I'm afraid I can't say it did much for me. The characters, plot and writing were SO F'IN TERRIBLE that it was simply impossible to get turned on.<br /><br />The characters: The protagonist is a gorgeous college student who has never had sex... right. The love interest is a controlling billionaire, who turns the normally cool-headed protagonist into a total bumbling idiot. If you like identifying with totally vapid characters unlike anyone who exists in reality, then this book is perfect for you.<br /><br />The plot (WITH SPOILERS!): The protagonist interviews the love interest for her college newspaper, falls all over herself, and he's smitten. He asks her to be his submissive, both inside and outside the bedroom. She kinda agrees after he lures her in with normal sex, but then freaks out and decides she wants to be loved. He spanks her, she tells him to screw off. The end.<br /><br />The writing: To say this book is horribly written would be an understatement. It is repetitive and totally uninteresting. Every now and then the author throws in a GRE word for funsies. These can't make up for the fact that she refers to the protagonist's sex drive as her \\"inner goddess\\" and conscience as her \\"subconscious.\\"<br /><br />If you want to be turned on, I'd suggest downloading pornography. Even the worst pornography you'd find would have a more compelling story arc than this book. As a bonus, you won't have to weed through the protagonist's whiny inner dialogue.

B001EPYQO6|3.0|I've watched the theatrical release many times and I really enjoyed the movie and I was really excited that there was a director's cut of this movie but I was left with fixed feelings.<br /><br />On the one hand I think some of the added scenes added to the movie, but I was hoping for real organic additions to the movie, not just a added scenes here and there that didn't really deepen the complexities of the plot lines or psychology of the characters.  (I'm coming from the background of judging this movie by comparing it to the director's cut of Kingdom of Heaven which far exceeded the theatrical.)  Another major disappointment, and some may find this trivial, is the duel between Achilles and Hector.  This is by far one of the best duels I've seen in a movie, but in the director's cut they completely changed that musical score for the scene.  I was extremely disappointed by the change because in the theatrical release the music was absolutely perfect with the driving percussion lines, and the build up in the music's dynamics as the duel drew towards it's conclusion.  This was completely taken out of the director's cut and the duel lost much of its energy and power to me.<br /><br />Either way, the director's cut is alright but in the end I think I'll stick with the theatrical release.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|It was okay, but not quite what i was looking for, looking for more competition,  Do not recommend it, but price was cheap
B0031MA7RA|3.0|Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor's \\"My Stroke of Insight\\" chronicles her journey from the day of her stroke through her recovery. The book give her unique perspective as a brain scientist experiencing a stroke, going through the process of recovery, and reflecting on her new appreciation of right-brain thinking.<br /><br /> The chapters of the stroke and the slow deterioration of her mind are fascinating to read and paint a vivid picture (although I would argue her TED talk does a better job of it). There is, unfortunately, a large amount of repetition in explaining her stroke and philosophy, and it can be frustrating to read. I think much of this story could be reproduced with the same or better effect in a long article rather than a short book. It is also odd that she devotes two chapters to teaching her readers some basic neuroscience, but then fails to make use of that information in telling her story. It is especially disappointing given the repetition; the space to explain and go into detail was there and would have been appreciated.<br /><br /> Overall I feel like this book is a missed opportunity. Outside of the first few chapters I don't feel that the insight Dr. Taylor provides is in any real way related to her background as a neuroscientist. Her metaphysical perspective I'm sure will appeal to many, but I think she takes advantage of her position as an authority on neuroscience to present arguments which aren't really neuroscience.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|The beginning was a little slow for me.  By the middle of the book, I couldn't put it down!  It reminded me a little of the Fifty Shades series, but that's not necessarily bad.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is an absolute must have! It is extremely addictive and passes time if needed. I would definitely reccomend it!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|I had never heard of John Carter, but decided to go see it right before it left theaters after reading about it on a blog.  Wonderful film.  I was kicking myself for not seeing it earlier in its run in the theaters, because I would have loved to go see it a few more times.  That got me started reading the books, which are fantastic as well.<br />I now own it on Blu-Ray/DVD, and have watched it many times.<br />I highly recommend this film.<br />It has great action and depth to the world of Barsoom.  The characters really draw you in to want to know more about them and the world they live in.<br />Edgar Rice Burroughs truly had a wonderful imagination, and it is awesome to be able to see that portrayed on screen.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|Stinky, stinkyest....worst books ever,  I am sure.  Terrible writing, makes me want to disinfect my Kindle with Clorox.  Luckily Christian Grey and Ana are deleted from my Kindle now.  I just wish I could get a refund just for the purpose of apologizing for wasting my time and money and putting me through the 4 or 5 chapters that I happened to read.  So abusive!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I pretty much never say I dont like a book, but this one, nah I did not like it. The author was new to me and was a recommendation. I dont get how people rated it 5* either. And I am not kidding, for me the first half of Gone Girl was a PURE TORTURE to read. I stuck through it because I paid $12.99 and was not going to click \\"remove from device\\". Amy Dunn disappears on the day of her 5th wedding anniversary. Now a lot of uncovered evidence says her husband, Nick, is somehow involved. It takes forever and there was no body discovered. I think both Nick and Amy were idiots and the premise of the journal was awful. When we find out about the journal and the purpose it even pissed me off that is was phony. Did he kill her? Was she kidnapped? What happened to Amy? One thing is clear, Nick and Amy's marriage wasn't as perfect as everybody thought.<br /><br />The first part of the novel is all about the investigation into Amy's disappearance, slow unraveling of Nick's dirty secrets, reminiscing about the troubled history of Nick and Amy's marriage as told in Amy's journal. I strained and strained my brain trying to understand why she went to these lengths instead of just leaving him and the same for him. The wedding clue thing was just so out there I don't see that realistic anywhere with anyone.<br /> I wish it didn't take a lot of patience to finish and shake my finger at the reviews.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Anastasia Steele is a quirky, forlorn college student preparing for her next phase of life in the real world. She works at Clayton's Hardware, where she's acquired a vast amount of knowledge never to be used again.<br /><br />It's not until her roommate and close friend, Kate Kavanaugh becomes sick that her world shifts. With the interview of the century in her grasp, Kate is desperate for Ana to fulfill her mission with the elusive, Christian Grey, owner of Grey Holdings, Inc.<br /><br />Not one to let Kate down, Ana succumbs to her friend's request and does the interview with Grey, who seems to live in a world fit for him. Everything about the man is polar opposite of Ana's desires, except his stunning good looks and those gray eyes.<br /><br />Grey makes it known almost immediately that he's interested in Ana, who quips at the idea of being his current conquest. Yet, with Christian, there's a private price to pay. Little did Ana know just how much she'd be taught.<br /><br />In Fifty Shades of Grey, Book One, the author has provided an interesting view of one man's private fetishes ruled by his own terms. The fact that the latest lady in his grasp is pure, inexperienced and a touch aloof, does show promise of their pending relationship.<br /><br />After hearing all the hype about this series, E.L. James has uncovered a crafty way to get readers enthralled in the realms of suspense, erotica, BDSM and the key of hope. Although the read is a touch repetitive and very wordy, James did create a foundation for the next story in this series.<br /><br />It is my wish that the next installment has shown writing growth, otherwise it could make for a long, torturous read.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was so enthralled with this book that I had to read day and night until I could finish story. The author writes so vividly that it was like seeing a movie only in words. It may not be for everyone due to explicit scenes but great story line.<br />I have heard many people rave about the trilogy that I had to read it myself. I no sooner finished book 1 then had to order 2 and 3. Author really keeps you involved with his characters.
034580404X|5.0|A friend lent me book 1....it was like liquid crack! I was hooked! Could not put it down. Read it in less than 1 day. I usually dont buy books (I borrow from my local library) but this, I bought. Not one, but 3 trilogy copies (one for me [b/c I will definitely read it again] and two girlfriends)! Almost had a heart attack when I purchased it b/c it was on back order & I had to wait 2 weeks to receive them. Worth the wait. Makes a great gift for your friends. I will definitely pass this good read along to others! PS the writing is very elementary but a quick read and very captivating.
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|In this case you can judge the book (CD) by the cover. The artwork is hideous and I found the music to be the same.  I can usually find some songs on any release to appreciate - but not with this mess.  She does not \\"play\\" the piano...she POUNDS it!  And her singing is an off-tune, gravely voice that is sometimes incoherent.  I won't go into details about each song because it would do no good, and I might have to listen to the train-wreck again.  No, I threw this purchase in the trash.  But - that is just my opinion.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I have recently gotten into the Harry Potter series (I know, I know, it's like 10 years late but that's just how I roll :P) and was so excited to find the entire movie set. The packaging is top notch and keeps all the disks in place very well. All in all this is a great purchase!
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book left me with a bad, ichy feeling!  Such pungent characters Gillian creates!  This book ramped up nicely.  I actually liked the ending!!!  Thank you, Gillian!  Will be waiting for the next Flynn creation...
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This case is durable, so i can throw it in my purse during my commute and not worry about the screen getting scratched or the flap opening up. I like the sleeker design then some of the cases i have seen. the flap folds all the way around so it isnt in your way like a book cover. definitely happy with this case!
B000UR9T8C|5.0|I liked the movie in the theaters and I liked it on DVD.  However, I am confused.  I bought the DVD as a regular DVD not BluRay, yet because I thought I got BluRay I put it in my BluRay player and it plays great with great resolution and sound.  So I put it in my regular DVD player and it played.  The resolution wasn't as good but ok.  The package says it was mastered in High Definition.  Does that mean that that kind of disk is made to play on both?  If so, why pay more for BluRay?  Has any one else run into that situation?
B003UESJF6|4.0|I like this movie. It is humorous and fun.  The kids like it too.  Not sure it is a favorite, but one of the better kids flicks we've bought in awhile.  Worth watching - more than once!

B001HN6918|5.0|My kids have quite a collection of movies, as we travel a lot and there is a player in the car.  That said, Kung Fu Panda movies are our families favorites.  We love Jack Black, and the moral and spiritual undertones of these movies.  Kung Fu Panda 2 is, in my opinion, better than the first one.  That's saying a lot for me, because I LOVED the first one.  My four-year-old could watch this and the first Kung Fu Panda every day, if I would let him.  He loves the main character \\"Po\\".  It is extremely funny and very up-lifting.  Anybody who hasn't seen the Kung Fu Panda movies is seriously missing out on two great flicks.  All of us love this film and that includes, my husband and I, and four kids; ages 4 to 15.

1439153663|5.0|This book is extremely sad... don't go in hoping for a happy ending! That said, it's about slavery, so much as we'd like to re-imagine history I think the author actually resisted temptation and told a rich, realistic story and she should be commended for that. If anything, it probably IS rather optimistic compared to reality.<br /><br />The novel alternates between two narrators, one white and one black, both caught in an 'in between' status between traditional white and black roles in the South.<br /><br />The first is Lavinia, a white orphaned Irish indentured servant who comes to work for 'The Captain' after her parents die on the trans-Atlantic voyage. She is sent to live with some higher status slaves (Mamma Mae and Papa George and their children, who have both earned special status through their service to the family), and Belle in the kitchen house. Lavinia grows to love them, and they her, and as she grows into a beauty and begins to also build closer relationships with the plantation owning family, things get complicated. Lavinia's fatal flaw is her growing mistrust of her slave family the more she is influenced by the white owners.<br /><br />The second narrator is Belle, who is actually the illegitimate daughter of the Captain. The Captain cares about Belle and gives her special status and privilege among the slaves. He promises to give her freedom papers before retiring. The Captain never tells his wife the truth about who Belle is, however, and she is driven to madness in her jealousy, assuming Belle is his lover. This mis-belief has terrible repercussions for every single member of the family. Belle's fatal flaw is her trust that the Captain will always protect her.<br /><br />Although Belle is a blood relation to the Captain, her status dwindles throughout the book. Alternatively, Lavinia is able to transcend her lowly beginnings simply by virtue of being white and beautiful. Neither can ever really seize their opportunities for happiness, though, because they are unwilling to leave those they love who are enslaved. You'll grow attached to most of the characters, and feel their emotions (fear, anticipation, heartbreak, hope) fully. It's a well-written, well researched book that kept me enthralled to the end.cause they are unwilling to leave those they love who are enslaved.

B00110K62U|5.0|A lot of shows and movies can be watched streaming online these days. The reason I bought this DVD is for nostalgia reason. So I do care about the package and how well everything is made. The case for the DVD is nicely made with a small compartment between the two disc for a thin book. I would love to have a book with more info like cast, but it is a bonus for DVD anyway. As for the musical, the 10th anniversary is my favorite version for Les Miserables. Listen to it on my phone or pad very often.

B004XIZN5M|5.0|I am very impressed with this book.  I am getting back in shape and found its philosophy and approach to be highly informative and practical.

No hesitation in this download =D .

B0057R5XRG|5.0|I was born in 86 so this Jurassic park was apart of my childhood. I remember having the First Jurassic Park on VHS. watching it over and over.. Why? Because DINOSAURS are AWESOME that's why.. long story short... I have a Blu-Ray Player and saw this trilogy and decided to treat myself.<br /><br />The Quality is Amazing, Better than in the theaters. Even the first film is AMAZING. The scene at the beginning when they are dusting off sand from the dinosaur bones. The grains of sand or so Richly detailed you can make out individual grains clearly.<br /><br />There is a HUGE difference between a older movie put on a Blu-Ray disc and an older movie Re-mastered and put on a Blu-Ray disc. These films have been remastered and all look amazing. You can really tell the difference when looking in the special features and watching the original Cinematic Trailers It is like Night and day being able to see what they looked like originally on a TV.<br /><br />Either Way.. If your on the fence on if you want to get this set or not..Just get it.. Remember what happened to Tim when he was left hanging on the fence?

B007IXWKUK|5.0|There has been so much speculation surrounding these books. You're either going to love it or hate it. I suppose I can understand both arguments. On the one hand it centers around a dominent that was abused when he was younger. If you can get past what happened to him and see how it shaped who he's become you start to understand him. Ana is a nieve young women looking for love in her first relationship. I wasn't at all familiar with the dominent/sub lifestyle but it didn't disgust me like so many other readers either. Once you got past the dominent/sub part in the first book, you start to see how they both want to make changes in their lives to accomodate the other because they are falling in love.  The second book was my favorite of the series and it's where the characters really begin to grow.<br />The love story that develops in the second and third books really makes the trilogy. It's just a shame that some people are missing out because they can't get past the issues in the first book. It's definitly worth the read and I will read them all again.

That gets annoying after you hear it 50 times.  If you're looking for something better, I suggest Bared to You by Sylvia Day.  This is also a trilogy although only the first book has been released so far.  She's a better writer.

B004YM6JI2|5.0|This was the second season I have seen on tv and by the most interesting one yet I love how everything came down to just Sam and Dean dealing with an enemy they hardly understood and didn't know how to defeat for a while through out the season. Plus dealing with everyday supernatural beings to add on top of that. Can't wait to see what Sam and Dean deal with this next season coming out in September :)
B000IJ79WU|3.0|While I agree with some of the other reviewers citing the use of footage from Superman 1, there are some good things about Richard Donner's version of the film. It is less campy than the Lester version, and as another reviewer stated, it treats the audience like adults. It does not stoop to making Clark Kent clumsy in order to reveal his secret identity, rather, it focuses on Lois Lane's astuteness as a reporter and her ability to 'fill in the blanks', so to speak. There are no cheesy comments during the street fight, no cop-out in the fortress of solitude involving Superman's mother, and no campy scene of small-town America (complete with children with English accents). Donner's version of the film basically reduced the Kryptonian supervillains to one-dimensional caricatures. They are given more screen time here, more of a range of emotions, and you see what would have made them so dangerous in the first place (such as General Zod picking up a machine gun in the White House and using it, with a gleeful smile on his face the whole time). They are no longer treated like inept sociopaths, but like intelligent beings. Had the Salkinds showed some humility and kept Donner on the project, we would not have had to wait thirty years for this footage, not to mention being treated to more campy sequels. At any rate, this film does not stand well on its own, but does very well as an historical document.

B0070NSPCU|5.0|I had once again began to lose hope in the indie publishing field, having been disappointed with the last few indie books I've read. A few of them started with great promise, but left me quite disappointed in the end. But all hope was not lost, at least not since stumbling across Raven's Shadow by Anthony Ryan. I haven't been this excited about an indie book since Progeny by Ryan Kaelin ([ ... ] ). What is it with Ryans writing exceptional stories? Anyway ...on with the review.<br /><br />The story starts with our protagonist, Vaelin Al Sorna - known as a Brother of the 6th Order, the Sword of the Realm, Young Hawk, Darkblade, Beral Shak Ur, and Hope Killer, being led as a prisoner by Lord Verniers Alshe Someren, Imperial Chronicler, First of the Learned and honored servant to the Empire, to face a judgment by a country and people whom his Battle Lord father had almost decimated when he was but a small child. Already prejudiced against him for being the son of their most hated rival, Vaelin is also the killer of their beloved Hope, the successor to the Emperor's throne in their latest skirmish with King Janus and the Realm. As they travel across the sea to face a trial by conquest, Vaelin tells this chronicler the story of his life and how the most hated of villains he became.<br /><br />This prologue pulled me right into the story and piqued my interest to the point I just had to read on. That's one of the formula's I love best - have a despicable state of being and then go back and show me how one achieved such a state. It is the basic fundamental aspect of humanity - to understand how someone reaches a certain state in their life, either deplorable or exceptional, so we can better understand and see the path to that destruction or success and apply the principles to our own lives.<br /><br />The real story begins with Vaelin as a mere child dealing the death of his mother, along with losing that innocent childhood, as his Battle Lord father abandons him to the Brothers of the Sixth Order, a sect of the Faith that focuses primarily on the art of war. It is his time with the Sixth Order that we fall in love with Vaelin, and his other brothers, as they are transformed from weak, innocent boys, into a close-nit team of merciless assassins. We are carried right along with Vaelin as he develops his skills, face his trials, and nurtures the hate for the father that abandoned him. You can't help but root for him and his Order brothers as they transform from the fearful into the greatly feared. Anthony Ryan does an excellent job of sewing the reader so perfectly secure into all the emotion and action that has you completely solidified and connected with the protagonist.<br /><br />What is a great adventure without a little love to soften the hardness, - bring a little light into the darkness, than to have a splash of romance? I love the way the author didn't douse the reader in sappy syrup, but sprinkled just enough to allow the sweetness to be savored on top of the spice. My mind went into three different directions on this aspect of the story, but I'm very pleased with how it turned it out. I loved the twists and turns the story took, but can't express how much I loved how the author kept the priorities in line. This is usually where a writer plunges off an unseen cliff, especially with epic fantasies - they allow the romance to overcome and dominate the story, instead of balancing it. It's hard to do, because it's so easy to get carried away with emotion, but Anthony Ryan handled it very well. At least, I'm well pleased. I hate seeing a great super strong character lose all his strength and integrity for a woman. As a woman, I want a strong-willed man; not a limp-wristed, love sick puppy. A valiant warrior, who has strength to lead and fight, must also have strength of mind, yet time and time again you find these oxymorons posed as heroes, men who can stand against all the world, but can't say no to a woman??? Okay, time to moveaway from this particular rant and on with the review.<br /><br />There is another twist I absolutely LOVED in this story, but I don't want to say too much about it because it will give it away. Let's just say - I didn't see it coming, and it broke my heart - literally. THAT is hard to do. I've read and written so many stories that I'm rarely surprised, but in this - I was absolutely blown away. Not only was the foundation and story thread brilliantly laid, but exceptionally executed. Well done, Anthony! If I had any criticism of this entire story, it would be this: Put it through one more round of edits (especially where commas are concerned) and get this traditionally published so it can receive greater exposure.<br /><br />I don't know Mr. Ryan, but I've come to admire his work, just as I know you will too if you dare to delve into the adventure of Raven's Song.<br /><br />Till next time,<br />~ Author T.L. Gray<br />[ ... ]nd on with the review.    There is another twist I absolutely LOVED in this story, but I don't want to say too much about it because it will give it away.

034580404X|3.0|While there's no doubt that it's great to have all three of the 50 shades books together, it's dissapointing to receive such a flimsy \\"box\\" to house the paperbacks. While the print quaity is good and the finish and artwork pretty, the box itself is too light, and not robust enough to act as a protective storage place for the three books. I am happy to have the product, but next to previously purchased box sets, it lacks both the strength and protective qualities assumed upon purchase.

Very glad I did, enjoy the album (what fits on a CD at least) on my way to work every morning.
1400031001|5.0|William Boyd's novel is the autobiography of Logan Mountstuart, son of a British father and Uruguayan mother, who begins life seemingly under the most auspicious of stars. From a prosperous family, he spends his early years in South America and then in Birmingham, attending a fine public school and then Oxford and producing his first published work in his twenties.  He marries an Earl's daughter and has a son, and it all seems so effortless and pleasant.  But shadows arise.  He falls out of love with his wife and with another woman. His writing career bogs down into a series of jobs at journals which eventually go out of business. When he does write a book it's well reviewed but sells poorly.  Things revive a bit during World War II, when he is recruited by Ian Fleming to work for British Intelligence, but this leads to his capture and imprisonment.  When he returns to England after the war it is only to be faced with more tragedy. Logan goes on writing sporadically, develops a new career as an art dealer in New York, falls in love with another woman and marries her, and for a time all seems well.  Eventually troubles reemerge and Logan gradually but steadily goes down hill, growing poorer and poorer as the years go by.  When he finally dies at the age of 85 he is barely remembered and turns out to have destroyed his final novel before it was finished.<br /><br />This bare synopsis sounds mostly depressing, but there are many engaging and sometimes lighthearted moments in this tale. Logan meets and has dealings with a large number of famous (sometimes notorious) people, including the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. Facilitating the conceit that this is a real autobiography of an actual person are the footnotes and editorial inserts that identify the famous people with whom Logan is said to come into contact.  Logan's story in many ways parallels the story of Britain in the twentieth century, or at least of the type of British society into which he was born and moved during his early life.  Any Human Heart is a long read but an interesting one, and while the reader may justly feel that Logan was his own worst enemy and that he brought many of his troubles on himself, nevertheless he'll come away with a liking for the man.ring his early life.

B008EQIEWS|3.0|Is Liam Neesom the only actor who can play a god anymore and really make you think he could be?  He is the Charlton Heston of our generation...as far as the movie glad I didn't spend the money at the Cineplex, kind of tired of CGI heavy movies that don't have any character and plot development, did like the two torsoed monster things though.
0439023521|1.0|I read the Hunger Games after seeing the movie, and enjoyed it. The story was gripping and engaging, and somehow I managed to swallow the fact that the story is about children killing each other. I believe I was able to deal with this fact because this book ends well, hopeful, with a character you adore. But be warned, the following books are worse in every way. Not only does the plot darken and become completely devoid of hope, the writing gets thrown together and the characters hardly exist. If you are interested in this series, I would encourage you to read the most critical reviews of Mockingjay. Hopefully you will be spared from the unsatisfying, shattered feeling this trilogy leaves you. I say skip it. You'll be glad you did.

1439127700|5.0|The President's Club is a powerful read and extraordinary book.  Nancy Gibb and Michael Duffy truly collaborated on a remarkable study of this select group of individuals and created a great read and a worthwhile study for nearly every citizen who can read.  The book is so positive about each and every one of the 44 members without ignoring the problems and counterproductive maneuvers that were not worthy of club members.<br /><br />Each newly elected President of the United States has entered office and begun a transformation, usually some \\"kick in the pants\\" event happens on their first watch which changes everything - absolutely everything.  The club is there to protect the office, to get an overview of the country, and to understand, connect, and support each other.  No one else can understand what it is like to hold this office.<br /><br />The largest number of club members living at any one time was 7.  Nearly every President since Hoover came into office thinking that they did not need the previous fellows and thought their get acquainted sessions were just \\"good manners\\".<br /><br />But Truman could see that an individual needed people who had experienced the office and who were trustworthy to counsel them and talk through what needed to be accomplished and what route to take. Truman restored Hoover's good name and reputation after the name calling got so bad it reached a verbal lynching pitch.  Hoover went on to assist the next Presidents, and for 20 more years, with foreign policy efforts that have made a lasting impact on the world.<br /><br />Jimmy Carter should have been the Tea Party's Candidate, he had to live out his Christian Conservative Doctrine every waking minute and then he blundered through sharing everything with extreme honesty and the general public did not want to know.  What an amazing statesman he has become - still makes many blunders and lives within his beliefs. Everyone has needed his assistance.<br /><br />Nixon had to resign but intrying to restore his good name he used his incredible intelligence and powers of manipulation to make a huge impact on the thinking and wisdom of all the Presidents who came after.<br /><br />The only President I did not have better thoughts about was Reagan.  He was all \\"image\\" and got others to do the work for him so he could come off as the white hat.  I could not shake my feelings about him being slimy no matter how positive the authors presented his case.<br /><br />Bush #43  - well he is a good ol' boy but he doesn't seem to understand the common man and he could not get out of \\"the  party\\" mode of operations.  Even though the book was gracious and kind to his terms and experience - I am still embarrassed by him and his staff- so negative and cruel  and he  could not release  from this disgusting agenda  or being dependent and feeling entitled to huge amounts of money.<br /><br />I did find some saving moments by reading every word. The book is NOT about individual policies or actions, it IS about how the members worked with each other; the only ones who knew the experience.<br /><br />I love how Bush #41 was presented and my opinion of him was raised even higher than before.  He is still providing great support and humor to those who have followed his time in office.<br /><br />The book is just loaded with links to Presidential Libraries, pictures of events, and detailed references.  I had to stop linking to get through the book in time to write this post.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed by reading this book - I think each person will find some forgiveness in their expectations for a President and his choices and I think people will be better informed about who they choose for their next Commander in Chief.  Truly it should not be up to the parties and the folks with the most money.<br /><br />Did you know that former President's did not receive any post service compensation and that Truman lived in near poverty (and had to build his library) afterhe left office?  The President's club finally developed a stipend system for former Presidents before Truman died.<br /><br />This book elevated my thinking and inspired me to know more and support my country and our efforts. Have you read a book recently that inspired your thinking and elevated your spirits?
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|I attended Santana Concert 2011 @ Red Rocks, CO and was pleasently surprised by May-2012 release of his newest album.  The songs are new & fresh, with the same smooth quality we have come to expect over the past and Carlos Santana guitar is as exciting as ever with notes dripping like syrup.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love these kinds of games! It is like so many other village games I play. I would recommend this game to anyone with a Kindle Fire, I am not saying that any other device is bad, I am saying that the Kindle Fire has a bigger screen than a regular phone. (I believe that Apple doesn't have this app.) If they do, then I was wrong! c:
B006MVJ2L4|4.0|from FYE as fans were led to expect.  While yes, the disc is top-loaded with dance tracks, there are many similarities to his previous CD.  Better than I know Myself is the Whaddya Want from Me, Never Close our Eyes the If I Had You, Runnin the Sleepwalker, Nivana the Broken Open, and Underneath the Soaked of Trespassing.  And as much as I like them, I don't think the best songs on this album are as good as the best on FYE.  I also find the cd oddly emotionally remote despite all the hype that this album shows a more \\"personal\\" side of Lambert.  Sorry, but with the exception of Runnin, I'm not feeling it.  Still, when it comes to pop music Trespassing is heads over the rest of what's out there so to take a phrase that Lambert likes to use, \\"It's not that deep\\" and just enjoy.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is Soooooo much fun. im so glad it  came out for kindle fire:)  DO get. Highly entertaining. Can play for ever.
B004I2K4E8|4.0|I'm not a fan of the show-concert format, which is rather stiff compared to a regular performance.<br /><br />But that's the nature of the format, and this just about as good as it can get. The presentation is a bit bombastic with the full symphony orchestra and large chorus, but it's well done overall, with excellent performances from almost the entire cast. Special recognition goes to Alfie Boe, who is astounding as Jean Valjean.<br /><br />The major weak link, of course, is Nick Jonas, who is way out of his depth here in vocal and acting talent. This was clearly stunt casting for a role which would have been far better in the hands of any of the actors playing small supporting roles on that stage. I doubt seriously that Jonas' appearance made the slightest difference in attendance, and that makes it a wasted opportunity for such a grand production.<br /><br />I was also disappointed with Lea Salonga. Please hear me out. Salonga has a great set of pipes and gobs of talent for the musical stage, but she sings \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\" for the rafters, and while that is an admirable talent, I don't think it suits the song. It's a song of disillusionment and resignation, and to my ear it calls for a softer touch than Salonga gave it.<br /><br />Still, I recommend this disc for a performance which, on the whole, is polished and well executed, and for the added attraction of the post-show songs and presentations.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|Pros: it downloads easy and u can find friends easy. and its free. it is a lot of fun.<br /><br />Cons: needs an update... and it doesnt let me get new colors or bombs only takes my coins. pleeaaazz fix.<br /><br />Overall a really fun app and i am glad they have it for kindle fires.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I cannot understand the popularity of this book/trilogy.  It is primarily a manual on masochistic/sadistic sex and a \\"reality show\\" gone wrong.  There is a plot but.....the sex is much too graphic and the plot hard to find.  The only reason I finished the first book was to see if Ana was going to sign the contract.  I will ask someone who has the time to find out how the last book ends;-(
B003Y5H5F6|2.0|On the positive side the production quality was good, lots of action and Kate Beckinsale performance was impressive.  However, this movie is the worst in the franchise.  The plot was swallow and predictable.  Dialog was cliche.  And all the other actors were severely out classed by Beckinsale.  This movie focused on the action and effects scenes and the script was merely to connect those scenes.  The movie is fun to watch for the action and effects but nothing else.  This was just a poor attempt to milk the franchise for more money.

B000P7V45S|5.0|\\"A Trick of the Tail\\" is the band's 7th, and the first Genesis album to feature full-time singer Phil Collins following the departure of original lead singer and founding member, Peter Gabriel. The Genesis of the following decades was more commercial in both music and ideology. However, in the '70's they were a secret garden of lush, poetic progressive musicianship that helped teens like me escape from the disco and country-rock boredom that came to define the music of the '70's... Almost 40 years later, it is hard to believe this collection of torch songs (\\"Entangled\\"), mystical beasts (\\"Squonk\\"), legends of lore (\\"A Trick of the Tail\\"), remorse and regret (\\"Ripples\\") and some of their best progressive scores with flawless tempo changes (\\"Dance on the Volcano, Robbery Assault and Battery)... can continue to force the listeners eyes closed, becoming lost in a world of sound that the music of today cannot begin to understand. There is no filler on this album, each song being it's own little mind trip with themes of sadness, fantasy, and remorse. \\"Squonk\\" is noteworthy of it's attempt to sound as much like a Led Zeppelin song as they could muster (Phil Collins) and \\"Trick of the Tail\\" is as close to a Beatles song as they would ever get (\\"Getting Better\\"). The album artwork by Hipgnosis (recognized for the cover art of several Pink Floyd albums over the decade) is one of their most original. I consider this album one of Genesis' greatest \\"unknown\\" masterpieces, alongside \\"Duke\\" and \\"....and then there were three\\".
B007J4T2G8|5.0|So I do a TON of reading but I never really review books and I should be a better customer! This book was so H-O-T!!

I know there are a lot of EL James haters out there, but this woman is impressive! She admits this book was her mid-life crisis - LMAO!! Wish I could have a mid-life crisis like this. I enjoyed the simplicity of the writing- sometimes you just want to read a book that is clear and straightforward - this is perfect for the beach. The build up was really fantastic and when Ana and Christian finally got together - wow!! I read all 3 of these books in a week. Of course,there not Shakespeare, but who was expecting them to be? I loved them for what they were and now I am really looking forward to the films!

No. Did I want more Ana and Christian sex? Absolutely! Did I spend 2 hours sitting around with my girlfriends dissecting every detail? Absolutely. And you know what? In a few months time, when I want to \\"get away from it all\\" I'll probably pick up these books and read them again because they are just so damn entertaining and fun.

B0049J3QF4|5.0|Note: I saw this movie with XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Cars is another winner for Walt Disney Pictures and Pixar Animation Studios. Since the release of TOY STORY in 1995, they have not disappointed in any of their films (I've yet to see Cars 2, Ratatouille and Brave), except A Bug's Life, infusing their movies with not only top-notch talent, but also great stories with very strong positive messages about friendship and family. And of course, the animation is always stunning.<br /><br />Sadly, this would be Paul Newman's final movie before his death. The legendary actor starred in many films, including The Sting, Exodus, The Color Of Money (for which he won an Academy Award) and Road To Perdition. Good way for a terrific actor to make his final bow.<br /><br />Rated G.

This experience, and I say that, because it is far more than reading a book;  left me wanting more of this outstanding writer.  Every page was anticipated and turned anxiously, although I didn't want the book to end.  I am looking forward to reading her other books and can't wait until she writes the next.  Wow, I am blown away by her absolutely clear imaged thoughts and the reality that this could relate to anyone and one never knows what one is thinking.  My new favorite author.  Thank you Gillian.

0606259090|5.0|I have read the FIFTY SHADES trilogy twice now and am trying NOT to read it a third time.  No, this will not become part of the canon of great literature (in my opinion).  James, however, has created characters that matter to me.  And long after the last page, they have stayed with me.  That is a mark of effective writing.  I teach Englislh, so I claim a bit of authority on the subject.  Give the trilogy a try.  Each book gets better.

During his travels, he meets a beautiful Arabian woman named Fatima who explains to him that if he follows his heart, he shall find what it is he seeks.<br />Santiago then encounters a lone alchemist who tells about personal legends. He says that people only want to find the treasure of their personal legends but not the personal legend itself. He feels unsure about himself as he listens to the alchemist's teachings. The alchemist states \\"Those who don't understand their personal legends will fail to comprehend its teachings.\\" It also states that treasure is more worthy than gold.<br /><br />Comments: One of the chief complaints lodged against the book is that the story, praised for its fable-like simplicity, actually is a fable--a retelling of \\"The Ruined Man who Became Rich Again through a Dream\\" (Tale 14 from the collection of One Thousand and One Nights.  Coelho, however, does not credit this source text anywhere in the book or in the preface, passing the story as an original work of fiction. Also the life story of Takkeci Ibrahim Aga who is believed to live in Istanbul during 1500s, has the same plot.  Despite its international acceptance by critics, this book didn't enjoy the same reception in Brazil. It is believed that translators have improved the text, correcting the linguistic flaws of the original.s believed that translators have improved the text, correcting the linguistic flaws of the original.

B002RKSZKI|5.0|i started to read this book for school, and at first i was like, awww a boring classic. But after i started to read it, i got hooked. i really felt like i got to know the characters and overall i really liked it. I'm officially a Jane Austen fan!
B003Y5H542|5.0|Rango is an outstandingly good comedy animation with an informative and enjoyable comic satire of the cultural comment and politics of \\"the western\\".<br />The visuals and animation skills are without flaw.  The storyline and presentation is a joy from beginning to end.  Anyone who is not psychotic or egomaniacal will be most grateful to have \\"Rango\\" in the world.  You could only be delighted and grateful to see this animation.

I love that it's full-screen so the buttons are so easy to see at-a-glance, while multi-tasking. This is my go-to gadget whenever I have to figure my checkbook especially. I highly recommend it.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I am having a blast with this game.  So glad that I downloaded it.  Challenging levels, decent graphics.  The only negative thing I can say is that when you turn off the sound in the game it does not turn off.

1455518999|4.0|A super read but a few surprises.<br /><br />Amazing to me how the protagonist \\"Puller\\" seems to be a clone of \\"Reacher\\" in the Lee Childs novels.  Not just the character, ex MP tough-guy, but also the romance with the small town police officer.<br /><br />I thought, gee maybe I have read this before.<br /><br />Do these big authors steal characters and plots?
B000IZA9NK|4.0|Sky Captain? I did not know this movie even existed until a friend lent me his DVD. A toast to Kerry Conran and his VFX crew for creating a very enjoyable suspense and action packed thriller. I wanted to have my own DVD of this lengthy and hard to remember title but could hardly recall the name. (Thanks, amazon.com.)  I suppose some B-List trio of actors with a smidgin of acting ability could have substituted for the lineup of Academy award winner/nominee with billboard names. Jude Law as (Sky) Captain Joe Sullivan brings home the bacon, or the Vienna sausage. Angelina Jolie as the attractive commander of a fleet of aerial aircraft carriers shines as Captain Joe's female clone in a script that deserved more of her screen presence. As for Gwyneth Paltrow she struck me as one obnoxious \\"intrepid\\" reporter. Academy award recipient Ms. Paltrow's acting gets progressively worse throughout the movie.  Okay, she carries her irritating role to the point that I really found her annoying.  My four stars go to Conran, Jude Law and Angelina Jolie, Sky Captain's nearly indestructible P-40 fighter plane and airborne aircraft carriers and their flying machines.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fun book to read....not as raunchy as everyone said....but it is descriptive! There's a good story in all of them....loved it!
0743424425|5.0|This is not only my favorite Stephen King novel, its my favorite book, period. Hands down, bar none. I've read it 3 times & have just purchased the audio version so now its gonna be 4 times that i've taken that long car ride up into the Colorado Rockies & onto that twisting mountain road called Sidewinder Pass that'll lead me to the Overlook Hotel for another visit. And i never read a book more than once. At least not that i can remember. But this book is simply the best. I first read it when i was about 13 & at that point in time, nothing since i was about 6 or 7 yrs old had ever sacred me to the point of having to jump up outta my bed & run to turn the light off then pull the covers up over my head! But the lady in the bathtub chapter did exactly that to me! Scared the absolute crap outta me! And no lie, nothing ever scares me. I once saw years ago when Whoopie Goldberg had her own talk show where she would only have one single guest on for the whole entire hour and Shephen King was her guest. She asked him if he ever scared himself while writing any of his books and he said no, not really. The only time he did ever scare himself was when he was writing the lady in the bathtub scene for The Shining! Lol, i nearly popped when he said that and i loved him even more for it. Dam that is one scary scene and one scary book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Such a good book.. I fell in love with the two main characters and kept turning the pages to see what happens next!! I read the whole trilogy in five days and it's one of those books you just don't want to end... Sure there is sex like all the hype ... But there is more then that... Christian and Ana become people and you just get immersed in their lives and world!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|i use this app all the time (and Turbo Collage) they are seriously the two best apps EVER!!!!!!! I like this one because you can do pretty much anything to the photo --editing wise.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fantastic books.  Wonderfully executed, good clean narratives, and they don't drag at any point.  Even the twists at the end of each don't feel contrived, they simply break open an entire new path in the books' Universe to explore.  These were incredibly enjoyable and I would wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone.  I would also say that two things struck me about these books.<br /><br />First, thank god for Ebooks and self-publishing.  It is so refreshing to have cleared the path between the consumer and supplier when it comes to media.  Mr. Howey can charge six dollars for the entire series, the majority of it coming back to him essentially, because the parasitic publishing companies are cut out.  Mr. Howey should be commended for not only writing a truly great work of science fiction, but for also helping to sound the death knell of the modern publishing company.<br /><br />When it comes to media, there is nothing worse than the middleman.  So rarely is anything added by a publisher, and if rough edges exist then so be it, they add to the experience in the aggregate as different authors take chances that they wouldn't normally be allowed to take.  An editor with an author's best interests at heart is becoming a rarer and rarer commodity within today's publishing companies.  I have witnessed firsthand what is occurring at the larger publishing companies, and as revenues shrink authors and their art are sacrificed at the altar for the short term bottomline.<br /><br />The modern bloated publishing companies (with the concentration on marketing, supply, distribution, shelf space in the bookstore) are dead.  But they just don't know it yet or won't accept it.  Within the next ten years they will go the way of Blockbuster and all corporations like it.  Amazon cut their knees off and they never realized it.  And thank god.  Please continue what you are doing Mr. Howey, and to all other authors out there like you.  Allow yourself to profit from yourself.  It is your art, your product and your effort.  Well done.<br /><br />My second point is that I have truly never read a series that is begging more to be made into a television series.  HBO and AMC are the only two networks that come to mind with the resources and audacity to actually turn these stories into something to watch.  But honestly, the characters, the visuals, everything about these stories make me want to see them done in series format.  Not a single movie, that would be terrible, too crammed in and you would lose the atmosphere, the characters, the world that they live in.  A television series would be perfect for this.  Please, allow someone with half a brain to pick this up and make it something incredible.  And for god's sake don't put it on any of the three major networks.  Their programming is the definition of Lowest Common Denominator and everything that is wrong with appealing to the widest possible audience.<br /><br />Anyway, like I said, wonderful, fantastically done and anyone who enjoys science fiction should buy these books.

B0002VFXFE|5.0|Pros:  Works as advertised, really does drop temps compared to other thermal compounds.<br /><br />Cons:  None, *if* you follow the directions.<br /><br />The surfaces must be clean and free of fingerprints and any previous thermal grease.  \\"Pre-tint\\" the surfaces using the bare minimum of AS5 possible, and then use a *small* amount as directed, which will vary by the sort of CPU you have.  Don't spread it out yourself; let the heatsink do it.  Several times during the first week after install, bring down the computer and let everything cool to room temperature. After the first week you can leave it powered on all the time if you wish.<br /><br />Having fingerprints or leftover grease on the surfaces will stop AS5 from curing correctly, and you won't get good performance.
B001TH16DS|3.0|The episodes are not in broadcast order, which is pretty stupid.  The voices are too low in volume sometimes and are over powered by the music.  For a Blu-ray this is unacceptable.  Don't buy if you want it in order.
0345803485|2.0|I read this book because I had heard good things about it from my sister and a few other friends. I would have to say that the book is just alright. Their relationship is kind of exciting at first but honestly, it get's old pretty quick. I only read the first book and I don't think I could make it through reading the other two. I don't think that I can take much more of the \\"oh my sex\\", \\"don't bite your lip\\", \\"grey eyes\\" etc. PLUS, I don't know ANY man who could possibly \\"recover\\" that quickly...if you know what I mean. Most of the sexual episodes within the book had me laughing because of how fake and unrealistic they really are. Enjoy your adventure I guess. To each their own.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Fifty Shades of Grey opened the door to a seamier side of life with healing and redemption by book three.  Though it doesn't qualify as great literature, it does meet the test of, \\"I can't put it down!\\" Loading it on my Kindle, I went from book one to two and then book three seamlessly with Amazon.

0345803507|5.0|I read the E.L. James \\"Fifty Shades\\" trilogy in a matter of days.  I found the books a welcome relief from my daily stress and rush to get things done.  The characters were interesting, especially Christian, sad and funny.  In his case a true commentary on what happens to abused kids.  Ana was young, naive, but apparently a fast learner who obviously met her match or life partner.  Ms. James is to be congratulated on her timing for this fast read of what I feel turned out to be NOT a nasty set of books centered on S&M.

1603427244|5.0|I have to admit that I'm not very good at knitting. Mostly it's hats, bags and scarves in simple patterns and occasional lace patterns. Since I'm trying to become a better knitter to realize some of the ideas in my head, learning more ways to start and end projects is essential. Leslie Ann Bestor's Cast On Bind Off: 54 Step by Step Methods has helped with that goal.<br />This book is spiral bound to lie flat while you're working and printed in full color.<br /><br />There lots of types of cast ons and bind offs for different applications. The step by step instructions have photos as well as well written text.<br /><br />It starts with a quick start guide to help out people just beginning. Then it goes into the cast ons. Each cast on lists the characteristics of it, and possible applications.<br />Basic cast ons are the ones we may have started with, and are the foundation to many kinds of projects.<br />Stretchy cast ons are the ones you'll want to use where you need a good amount of stretch, top down socks, bottom up hats, and things like that.<br />Decorative cast ons are a lot of fun. There are two types, a lacy edge and a picot edge.<br />Circular cast ons are worked in small rounds for beginning things that are knitted out from a center like circular shawls, top down hats, and bowl shapes.<br />Double sided is my current favorite. Casting on stitches on 2 needles to knit bags and other things in the round that are joined from the beginning. I followed the instructions for Judy's Magic Cast On to start a sock type cozy for an iPod.<br />Multicolor use different color yarns for a very decorative beginning.<br />Provisional means you are working around a waste yarn, or in her tips, she suggests a circular knitting needle so you can knit off of it later to do a second side.<br />Tubular edge also starts with waste yarn, works well for ribbing and looks just fantastic.<br />The final cast on method is a perfect M&ouml;bius for scarves.<br /><br />Then the bind offs- how to finish projects. There are only 4 different types, but many styles in this section.<br />Basic includes shapes like sloped and gathered.<br />Stretchy has several kinds of elastic bind offs that can be used for areas you need to be able to stretch.<br />Decorative includes the edge I used for the iPod cozy, it's an I cord knit edge.

1600242405|5.0|Sometimes a little hard to listen to ... but get over it because the complete product is a gem.  A really personal and frank account - telling his story from the beginning.  Not always pretty ... but always entertaining. Musicians would love it as Keith describes in detail how to create certain sounds and riffs. I loved it just because it was Keith - not just a Rolling Stone and a musician - but a son, a father, a husband ... and a junkie, but basically in the end just another man. Well worth the listen.  What a life!

B0041VV03A|2.0|I saw this movie in theaters.. From the previews before it came out, it was advertised as a horror movie, they showed a few scary parts, etc.. The first bit of horror in this movie didn't happen until about 15 minutes until the movie was about to end. That right there was a turn off to me. I sat there watching it asking myself \\"When does the killing that the previews showed happen?\\"

0345803485|1.0|The characters have about as much personality as cottage cheese, and the sex scenes are about as erotic as a soiled napkin. I truly fear that the people who enjoy 50 Shades may be compelled to reproduce (or at least try to) after reading this book; each copy should come with a complimentary tubal ligation.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I am finding my self downlaoding this game for my 4 year old so. and I have been playing all the tome. its addicting. so fun.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it I can do all sorts of games it is very challenging great game I play it all the time
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is without a doubt one of if not THE best portable games I have ever played. The open world sandbox of New York is fantastic and the Web slinging alone is worth the hefty price. Takes a minute to get used to the controls but once you do there is tons of fun to be had. Addictive rpg elements and the black spiderman suit are nice bonuses. It seems spendy but it totally worth the 7 dollars.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app met all my expectations and then some. Choosing music to play as the alarm, randoming the songs if you want, and even volume ramp up. Then there is the adjusting snooze function. Love this app!
B00127RAJY|3.0|I just hate Jillian Micheals, that's the bottom line.  I don't watch the biggest loser but was intrigued with the 30 days challenge.  I tried to do the workout but finally got sick of Jillian Micheals voice.  Also the beginning part you cannot skip so you have to watch her tell you that you can lose weight and you can be great but you have to be responsible.  I got an Amy Dixon workout and the Wedding Workout and I like those instructors a lot better, Jillian just ruined it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. I remember playing this in computer class 20 yearsago. a much older version of course. so much fun. my 4 yr old daughter loves it as well. you can connect to facebook and twitter. works great on my kindle fire

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|This app is awesome, well worth $0.99! So far has worked flawlessly. I cannot say enough good things about it, I would highly recommend it to anyone who sideloads anything from their computer to their device, in my case Kindle Fire.<br /><br />I've been having issues connecting Kindle Fires (we are a 2 Fire family) with USB for file transfer from PC to KF, (a story for a different post) but this app makes it a mute issue. Connectivity is faster over WiFi than with USB anyway, pictures and songs take seconds and a 30 minute .mp4 video only takes a couple minutes at the most.<br /><br />I've read older reviews about security and inability to shut down app but it can be password protected and an exit button is provided, both are accessible in the menu.<br /><br />Edit 7/28/2012<br />Based on threads found on Amazon Kindle Fire forums, I am not the only one who has problems connecting via USB to a PC for sideloading. I cannot stress enough how much aggravation this app has saved me.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Loved the story line.  If you've ever watched the TV show Castle it was very easy to see all the characters.  Really enjoyed this book.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book takes you through every emotion known to man and I loved every single minute of it. There was a lot of laughing and crying and crying while laughing. The characters we're awesome and the way they interact with each other is hilarious. There is nothing bad I can say about this book, especially since there is a follow-up book, \\"Point of Retreat\\" I BUTTERFLYING LOVED THE ENTIRE JOURNEY!
B00899E5B4|5.0|I had no or low expectations for his first solo album in decades. Wow what a surprise! The best solo album from Joe. Period. Great songs. Great guitar work. Great production quality. As an old school rock guy, it is great to see Joe is at the top of his game this far down the road. I hope this is just the beginning of a resurgence of the Joe Walsh I know and love. Keep it up Joe!
1881273156|5.0|I have been seeing a therapist for a while. I suffer from depression and PTSD which have caused major problems in my marriage. My therapist recommended this book to me, so I checked it out at the local library. At first, I was apprehensive because it sounded a bit corny. However, as I read each chapter my mind changed. I felt as if the book was talking to me. A lot of the scenarios were exactly what I was going through. I think the book was short and sweet, straight to the point. I also think that it not only works for marriage, but also with relationship with others. I really enjoyed reading this book and I highly recommend it. It is a book you have to read with an optimistic attitude.
B007Q0K9TE|5.0|Excellent concert...many favorite pieces.  Was also special to hear the premiere of Sir Anthony Hopkins' composition \\"And The Waltz Goes On\\".  Much energy from the whole production..keeps one humming all day long!
0606259090|1.0|I truly don't understand the power that this book has over all these women that read it.  Disturbingly bad writing, poorly developed characters, and erotica so bad that it feels like a teenage wrote it.<br /><br />This horrible book - this new rage of \\"mommy porn\\" is terrible.  I would not recommend it to anyone.  Don't waste your money.  If you want beautifully written erotica try Delta of Venus by Anaïs Nin.  Then you'll know true erotica.
B000FA675C|4.0|Love that it's set it Paris. As a novel, it keeps me entertained, which is all I need. I like that there is some history to it, but I'm not the type to fact check and see what's real and what's not. I'll be looking forward to reading Angels & Demons soon!
B005LZW8FO|4.0|This small independent production is the first feature film of Mike Cahill and Brit Marling. What could have been a rather mundane tale of romance and redemption for two people impacted by the same tragedy is, however, raised to something more by two things. First the acting is absolutely top notch. William Mapother (better known for \\"In the Bedroom\\" and \\"Lost\\") is a familiar face and strong actor. Brit Marling, however, is nothing short of amazing in her lead role as Rhonda Williams. The fact Marling co-wrote the screenplay undoubtedly assisted her in immersing herself in the character. This role puts her in the same league with Jennifer Lawrence after her breakout film \\"Winter's Bone.\\"<br /><br />What also sets this film apart is the combining of two separate genres; romantic drama and science fantasy. Without engaging in plot spoilers, Marling plays a high school senior celebrating early acceptance into M.I.T.'s astro-physics programs by having a couple of drinks. While driving home, she hears of a new planet discovered which is a mirror image of earth. She looks out the window to try and glimpse the planet plowing into the car of John Burroughs (Mapother) a music professor and nearby Yale University. Burrough's wife and young son are instantly killed and he is in a coma. Instead of M.I.T., Williams spends nearly 4 years in jail for vehicular manslaughter. After release, she finds Burroughs has come out of the coma. Much of the film centers on a relationship that develops between them, focusing on how they cope with their grief.<br /><br />The secondary plot, which runs concurrently, explores the existence of the new planet which has come much closer, and turns out to be a \\"Another Earth\\" an exact copy down to the existence of the same people. This development sets up the possibility of what it might be like if you could visit another planet and find a \\"Doppelg&auml;nger\\", an exact replica of yourself you could see from the outside. While the plot may at times strain credulity, it does so no more than a good episode of The Twilight Zone, and leaves viewers much to ponder at the end.<br /><br />While hardly perfect, films like these this one tend to renew my faith in movies at a time when too many studio p[roductions feel pre-packaged and predictable. As for Brit Marling, I can't wait for her next film, \\"Sound of My Voice\\">credulity, it does so no more than a good episode of The Twilight Zone, and leaves viewers much to ponder at the end.<br /><br />While hardly perfect, films like these this one tend to renew my faith in movies at a time when too many studio p[roductions feel pre-packaged and predictable.

1878424114|4.0|I got this book as I had some others by Deepak Chopra, I know that some people don't rate him, but I think that he puts spiritual concepts across in an easy to understand way that makes it easy for you to grasp what he is saying, unlike some other authors in this genre who make it very hard work.<br /><br />I liked the fact that he gives you exercises that you can try out for yourself at the end of each chapter. As with other reviewers I have read it more than once and like to dip in and out of it for inspiration. He doesn't necessarily have anything new to say, picking up ideologies from a range of religions and spiritual thinking, it's the way that he has joined them together in the 7 easy chapters that makes this book attractive.<br /><br />I would guess that if you had read widely on spirituality and religion then you might find this book a little low level, but for those of us who just want a little bit more balance and want to find an alternative way of getting success in our lives then this is the book for you.<br /><br />I have tried out some of the exercises and they really do make you think about the way you live your life and I have certainly made a few changes as a result of reading this little book. The only reason I haven't given it 5 stars is that I think that some readers may already know about some of the concepts explored in the book.

0345803485|1.0|This book and the maelstrom of hype surrounding it must be one of the biggest scams in history. An extremely clever PR person, a magician really, managed to conjure up frenzied excitement about this novel and its sequels and Abracadabra! Thousands of people's money vanishes! Unable to avoid seeing, hearing about, reading about this book all summer, I had to investigate. I was undecided because of the mixed bag of reviews and that made me unwilling to blindly spend MY money on this book, so I downloaded the free sample. Found my attention wandering in the first paragraph. After FORCING myself to finish the 3 chapters, I just had to say my piece. I was pleased to see the number of 1-star reviews rapidly mounting as the truth about this horrible book emerges. First off, I think the PR scam must even include disguising the true author. There is no way this was written by a woman. The photo and bio have to be planted and totally fake. Only a man would be arrogant enough to think we would buy the concept that an otherwise intelligent, capable woman is rendered all jelly-legged in the presence of an impossibly gorgeous man to the point that she stammers, flushes, palpitates, and trips over her own feet. And we know he is that hot because we are forced to read about it over and and over and over. Come on, we got it the first time! I was truly about to gag after what seemed the hundredth reference to this guy's godlike presence. It had the effect of making him totally unbelievable and thus I couldn't have cared less what he said or did. As for the heroine, she was just pathetic. It would be torture to have to read any more of this book. It is amateurish and might appeal to sixth grade girls, but I have no interest in whatever story is being told here (and from what I understand, it is negligible that there even is a story). Now, I know there are over 2 thousand negative reviews and counting for \\"Grey\\" and this will probably get lost in the vast sea, but that's okay. My 1 star will be added to the summary and help increase the ranks, hopefully saving other people from throwing away money on fiction that is not worth the paper it's printed on or the binary code that digitizes it.r will be added to the summary and help increase the ranks, hopefully saving other people from throwing away money on fiction that is not worth the paper it's printed on or the binary code that digitizes it.
B005LAIH9A|4.0|\\"It is so great to see all you kids back in town. And what a terrific soir&eacute;e are you throwing here tonight. Just wonderful.\\" 13 years after graduation the whole gang finally returns for their high school reunion. Lives have changed and old friends have drifted apart. The first night the gang gets back together old feelings come back and new problems arrive. Just when you think things can't go worse...they do. I'm not sure the term growing up with this movie applies because the first one came out when I was in college, but that's what it felt like. I remember the first one being so amazingly funny and raunchy and unlike anything that had come out until then. Fast forward to today and if you re-watch that one it seems so tame and almost PG-13 compared to todays movies. What I noticed about this one first off is that besides being funny it had a lot more heart in it then the recent high school drinking movies. Also unlike most sequels being made long after the series stopped this one actually made sense to do one and the writing was actually pretty good. All that said this is still an \\"American Pie\\" movie meaning there are some over the top scenes and the gang gets into things that seem to get worse and worse. As usual the best scenes involve Jim's (Biggs) Dad (Levy) and actually Stiffler seemed more tame in this one then the others. I have to say though that the ending of this one was perfect. Overall, for a fan of the series this is a great closer and I recommend it. I give it a B.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the books... it is such a guilty pleasure. The Characters are fun loving and the book itself is easy to get lost in. The reading is easy and went all to fast. 50 shades was a book that I could not put down along with a great story line, there are some very steamy...hot... hot scenes. It will revamp your love life with all the new ideas and tricks. It made me laugh,cry, and fall in love over and over again.

B007Y6OZE0|4.0|been a fan of Offspring since i was 18 when Americana came out...i think their best work is \\"ixnay..\\" but IMO theyve never put out a bad album...i thought RAFRAG was a solid album with 4 or 5 very good tracks...same with \\"splinter\\"....but onto the new album ive been looking forward to this for a few yrs....i heard the first single \\"days go by\\" and its got some nice guitar work but i wasnt that impressed...too mainstream sounding...then of course \\"cruising california\\" which isnt as bad as everyone says...its one to jam to from time to time...cheesy lyrics tho and the video is kind of lame.....but dont just the album based on those two singles...the best tracks are likely never to be heard on mainstream radio....opener \\"future is now\\" is a solid opener...\\"secrets from the underground\\" sounds a little like \\"kids arent alright\\" but gets better with each listen...\\"turning into you\\" and \\"hurting as one\\" are both good tracks that would be right at home on the bands older work...things get better the 2nd half of the album...\\"OC Guns\\" is one that most people are hating on and i dont see why...The Offspring has always put a few strange quirky tracks on their records and this one isnt half bad ...i find myself cranking it up from time to time.....\\"dirty magic\\" sounds amazing on here..much better than on Ignition...and \\"i wanna secret family with you\\" is corny mainstream sounding and it took a few listens but im digging it..ill usually listen to it each time the cd is in my car...they save the best for last though as \\"dividing by zero\\" and \\"slim pickens...\\" are two of the best tracks the band has EVER done and they work very well being back to back......final thoughts - mostly the album is getting pretty solid reviews with a few negative ones here and there but hey ill take a halfway decent Offspring album over anything on the radio these days anyday i can. Peace
0765365278|5.0|Another marvelous book from Sanderson, who is probably the best fantasy writer of our generation.  It's unbelievable the sheer volume of fantastic work that he produces.<br /><br />As always, Sanderson's work is smooth to read, has interesting characters, and an interesting magic system.  This particular book spends a lot more time than his others setting up the universe, as he plans on making this into an epic series.  The extra time spent here may be a turn off for some readers, but if you have no problem getting through other epics in the genre, I don't think you will with this one either.

Yes it is a game that you can buy more things to go further. what I really love about this one is you don't HAVE to buy to keep going as long as your patient.  If you don't want your child to buy things use the parental controls. I play this with my 5 yr old. Its great to learn strategy &amp; prioritizing. All in all its a great game.
B000000OU6|5.0|As my review title states the greatest album G N R never made...you have practically the band here except Axl on vocals and Duff on bass, even though he does contribute to some songwriting credits, his influence is present. Eric Dover is no Axl clone, and it times the songs sound as if Axl is singing.  This whole album plays together perfectly, just like Appetite and the Illusion epics.  Hats off to Slash, Dizzy, Gilby, Matt, and Mike for creating this masterwork, and the best solo album of Slash's career.
B007Y2W44W|5.0|Seriously, though, there aren't many bands I know or listen to that can release seven albums that are all ridiculously incredible, all have their own sound production wise, and the vocals/guitars/drums/ambience are all there.  It's disturbing how talented and innovative these guys continue to be, and how underrated they still are.<br /><br />I can't stop listening to this latest work of Egyptian themed brutal/technical art.<br /><br />The biggest complaint I've read about is the insane left field vocals on a few of the tracks, but I gotta tell you that it's one of the unpredictable elements that has actually drawn me to this album.  The other biggest complaint is the more organic and thin production, if you will, but for any who don't know Karl has stated that is intentionally old school so that everything is audible.  And it paid off...<br /><br />There are enough intense riff and drum passages on this thing to fill an entire pyramid of tombs.<br /><br />If you are a casual or diehard fan of this Carolina group, DO NOT HESITATE.  They deserve the recognition, popularity, and respect.<br /><br />HAIL NILE
0547791097|4.0|I read this book because I loved the movie, and I was not disappointed. From the very beginning I found myself entranced by James Sallis's style and tone. Even the way the story begins \\"Much later...\\" creates the sense that time is certainly not going to be linear in the book. Some people feel that this takes away from the story, however I like the way that the book starts in the middle of the story, and jumps around. It is done well, and creates a real rise and fall in the tension of the story.<br /><br />The characters are all rather mysterious, even the main character. Sallis does not spell out for us how we should feel about each character, leaving much to the imagination.<br /><br />Overall, it is a fun, quick read (should only take a few hours) and if you liked the movie you will certainly like the book.
0761119752|4.0|Sandra Boynton, &lt;strong>Pajama Time!&lt;/strong> (Workman Publishing, 2000)<br /><br />Another too-cute-for-words Boynton board book that you'll have as much fun reading to the kid as the kid will hearing it and looking at Boynton's fantastic illustrations. Lots of opportunities for coming up with different rhythms, fun voices, even setting it to music if you're so inclined. Can't say it does all that much for getting either of us ready for bed, but so what? Read it after dinner instead. Jamma-jamma-jamma-jamma-P-J! ****

0061743526|5.0|Having read To Kill a Mockingbird MANY years ago --[ I think it's even been a long time since I saw the movie ]-- this summer I read the book again.  I was struck anew by what a fantastic story it is, and impressed even more with Harper Lee's amazing skill as a writer.  The Boo Radley subplot is brilliant, the characters are extremely well drawn, and the dialogue and descriptions are note-perfect.  And all of that stands beside the value of the book as a moral lesson.<br /><br />I also read The Help a couple of years ago, and reading Mockingbird this year revealed exactly how heavily Ms. Stockett was influenced by Ms. Lee and the legendary 1952 novel.  Stockett doesn't like comparisons because she doesn't feel her work is worthy to be put alongside the earlier book, but The Help almost moves beyond homage into imitation, in my opinion.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Excellent fit for the Young Adult Fiction category. Graceling and the other two that follow (Fire and Bitterblue) remind me quite a bit of Tamora Pierce's \\"Alanna\\" series, which I've loved for years. Graceling has very good character development, a solid plot, interesting scenery, and just the right amount of detail to keep a reader entertained and interested all the way to the end! I'll be watching this author's future publications for the next installment. Highly recommended!

B005LAIHXQ|4.0|&lt;strong>Prometheus&lt;/strong> (Ridley Scott, 2012)<br /><br />You know what? If &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em> had been directed by anyone other than Ridley Scott, or if it hadn't been marketed as an &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> prequel--I am working on the hypothesis that it originally was not, and the &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> elements were retrofitted either at the insistence of the studio or when Scott and Spaits/Lindelof realized how much there was in common there--we wouldn't be having any of the discussions we are currently having about this movie. We'd probably be pretty united in hailing it as one of the more inventive (if derivative), and certainly one of the most technically accomplished, science fiction movies in recent memory, probably the best sci-fi movie since &lt;em>Cube&lt;/em> almost fifteen years ago. From a technical standpoint, &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em> is unassailable; the acting is pitch-perfect, the direction is exactly what one would expect form the guy who brought you &lt;em>Gladiator&lt;/em> and &lt;em>Bladerunner&lt;/em>, every member of the crew brought his or her A game, the 3D is hands-down the best I've seen since &lt;em>Cave of Forgotten Dreams&lt;/em> (and is used much in the same way, to my delight). In short, this is the type of movie for which the word \\"sumptuous\\" was coined. Forget all that Merchant-Ivory boondoggle. (After all, what are sci-fi films if not period dramas for periods that haven't happened yet?) It is, in short, an impressive achievement by any empirical yardstick one would choose to measure it with.<br /><br />The problem is, of course, that it &lt;em>was&lt;/em> directed by Ridley Scott, and even if you hadn't caught all the in-jokes and references in the script before you hit the final sequence, well, when you get to that point there's no denying this is an &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em> movie. (And in a movie that seemed awfully retrofitted, that final sequence was the most garishly tacked-on bit. But I am getting ahead of myself.) Now, while I am a pretty darned big fan of the Alien series, or at least the first three movies (I still to this day have not gotten round to seeing &lt;em>Alien Resurrection&lt;/em>, despite pretty much everyone I know telling me how much better it is than &lt;em>Alien&lt;supr>3&lt;/supr>&lt;/em>, a movie I actually quite liked), and even the one guy in the room who actually enjoyed &lt;em>Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em> for the stupid fun fanboy movie it was, I'm still a casual fan of the series as opposed to a true &lt;em>otaku&lt;/em>. You kind of have to be, in order to enjoy the big stuff-blows-up stupidity of &lt;em>Alien vs. Predator&lt;/em> in any way.<br /><br />There's also another layer to this, and one that most people don't seem to have thought about, but that's come up a few times in my discussions on the movie since I saw it Friday night (I'm writing this on the following Monday afternoon); there's a meta layer that was absent from the other films. And perhaps I'm overstepping the bounds here, but it seems to me that Scott and co., and specifically Avy Kaufman, who cast Noomi Rapace as a character named Elizabeth (and in at least one place during an action scene, an actor slips up and calls her character Lisbet), pretty much invited this meta layer into the film. And it casts an interesting light on what has become one of the movie's big controversies. But again, I'm getting ahead of myself.<br /><br />NOTE: There is one thing revealed in the synopsis that I can't believe is a spoiler, though there is a scene in the film that leads me to believe it was meant that way. If you are especially spoiler-sensitive, you may want to skip over the synopsis.<br /><br />Plot: two sceintists, Elizabeth Shaw (Rapace, rocketed to fame through playing Lisbeth Salander in the Millennium trilogy) and Charlie Holloway (&lt;em>Devil&lt;/em>'s Logan Marshall-Green), uncover what would seem to be a star map in the cave paintings and stone carvings of half a dozen, maybe more,ancient civilizations. Thanks to new-and-improved 2089 technology, they pinpoint the exact star system those paintings depict.<br /><br />[Problem #1: 35,000+ years later, the positions of some of those stars will have changed; after a tenth of that, some of the Greek constellations have lost their original shapes to modern eyes.]<br /><br />So Weyland Technologies, headed up by the very, very old Peter Weyland (&lt;em>The Adventures of Priscilla&lt;/em>'s Guy Pearce, and I'd be tempted to ask him which film had the tougher make-up job) and his ice-queen daughter Meredith Vickers (&lt;em>Monster&lt;/em>'s Charlize Theron), send a ship out to this star system, which happens to contain one very earth-like moon revolving a Saturn-like planet. The ship contains seventeen crew members, including various scientists, navigators, Vickers as the Weyland Technologies representative, and an android named David (&lt;em>Shame&lt;/em>'s Michael Fassbender) who learns human mannerisms from watching old movies obsessively, but, as a hologram of Weyland reminds us during the mission briefing, has no soul. Holloway and Shaw believe this planet to be the home of a race they call the Engineers--advanced beings who created the human race. When they get to the planet they do indeed find evidence that something other than nature has been there (\\"God does not create in straight lines,\\" as Holloway tells us), but of course, what they are seeking and what they find are two entirely different things...<br /><br />As regards the meta I spoke of earlier, and its particular application to &lt;em>Prometheus&lt;/em>: Michael Fassbender garnered a great deal of critical acclaim for his role in &lt;em>Shame&lt;/em>, playing a sex addict. An interesting choice to play the role of an asexual robot, especially when so many of your audience members leave asking themselves (or the people they were with) \\"was David gay?\\". It's a frankly ridiculous question to even be asking, and while half of me doubts that 90%+ of the people involved in the debate are even aware &lt;em>Shame&lt;/em> exists, it still feels like that particular casting choice forced the issue, rather like not changing the name of Noomi Rapace's character. And I've been mulling on this for days without being able to come up with another motive than \\"provide non-controversy to get butts in seats.\\" Which seems to be working, but it feels a little disingenuous.<br /><br />But you know what else? I'm going to ask you to forget all that. I'm also going to ask you to forget about all those plot holes that aren't really plot holes (if you're watching the movie on DVD, pause it when they reveal the designation of the planet, then go back and watch the first &lt;em>Alien&lt;/em>; they're two different, albeit somehow related, planets), forget about the anachronisms that make this ship so much technologically cooler (despite predating it) than the Nostromo, forget this movie is in any way related to the Alien franchise, which it actually &lt;em>is&lt;/em> possible to do until you get to that last sequence that drove me up the wall. Instead, focus on the other obvious source material from which they drew when writing this script: &lt;em>2001&lt;/em>. All the stuff about exploration and the dawn of man and all that. That, to me, is where the core of this film lay: in the sense of wonder at the discoveries they were making. &lt;em>That&lt;/em> is what this movie was about, and in that, it succeeded as well as it could given the script tinkering and retrofitting and all the other silliness. All of which means this is not a perfect movie by any means, but it is a lovely one, and worth seeing. *** ½paintings depict.<br /><br />[Problem #1: 35,000+ years later, the positions of some of those stars will have changed; after a tenth of that, some of the Greek constellations have lost their original shapes to modern eyes.]<br /><br />So Weyland Technologies, headed up by the very, very old Peter Weyland (<em>The Adventures of Priscilla</em>'s Guy Pearce, and I'd be tempted to ask him which film had the tougher make-up job) and his ice-queen daughter Meredith Vickers (<em>Monster</em>'s Charlize Theron), send a ship out to this star system, which happens to contain one very earth-like moon revolving a Saturn-like planet.

It's worth it just for that. But really? Understanding hormones, addiction, and how to overcome them is where I was impressed by how thorough the book was. I've been able to understand what habits I've needed to change because of this book.<br /><br />Understanding that there's a whole bunch of \\"no brakes\\" foods that cause uncontrollable eating immediately made me change a variety of habits. I've been gluten free for a while, but have always struggled with a sugar addiction. Well, in figuring out how to do that, this book also convinced me that I should give up coffee. Um, I never thought I would say that. At this point, I've been without coffee for 2 weeks, and am now in the process of getting rid of all the sugar as well.<br /><br />Final thoughts? If you're going to take the time to read a book about nutrition, read this one! You'll get an in-depth look on how your body works, responds to food, and how you can optimize that relationship.

B007549W62|2.0|&lt;strong>The Divide&lt;/strong> (Xavier Gens, 2011)<br /><br />Full disclosure: this movie was proided to me free of charge by Amazon Vine.<br /><br />While I was watching the movie, I was perusing the comments on the IMDB message boards. Divisive, those, indeed. And for the first one hundred seven minutes of this one hundred twelve minute movie, I was spending a bit of brainpower crafting impassioned responses to a number of those comments, defending these characters and their behavior, with illustrations from history (anyone who believes that humans wouldn't descend to the level of savages given an impending apocalypse needs to bone up on the last century).<br /><br />And then came the last two sequences in the movie, and what I can only describe as the [censored for Amazon consumption] move to end all [censored for Amazon consumption] moves. It's a complete one-eighty for the character involved, it's absolutely senseless within the universe the movie has built, and it reminded me all too painfully of just why it is I can't stand Xavier Gens (&lt;em>Frontier(s)&lt;/em>). I am unfamiliar with the screenwriting team of Mueller and Sheean (this was their first work), but given the rest of the film, I am totally willing to place the blame for that ending solely on Gens' head. (Because, you know, Hollywood NEVER reshoots endings.)<br /><br />Plot: nine residents of an apartment building in New York City flee to the basement during an attack that (as far as we can tell) levels the city. Whether it is a nuclear attack or not is ireelevant, really; Mickey (&lt;em>Terminator&lt;/em>'s Michael Biehn), the somewhat cracked urban-survivalist building super, is convinced it is, and seals them into his basement shelter. We'd be getting into spoiler territory if I told you what happens next, but let's say that after a handful of traumatic events, the survivors' psyches begin to be stripped down to their basest elements. If you were paying attention in the first bit, there should only be minor surprises for you (one character seems a touch more noble than you'd think he'd be, for example); the pleasure, if one can call it that, in watching this movie unfold is in seeing just how absurd the personality devolvement will become. (Here's a hint: it's a Xavier Gens movie.)<br /><br />And while it relies just a little too much on stereotypes--the aggressive African-American man who is finally out from under the boot of white authority pitted against the redneck brothers, the stable, well-adjusted guy is a wimp unable to stand up for his girlfriend, blah blah blah, I was willing to forgive the movie all this because Mueller and Sheean were dancing around as much as they could within those stereotypes, giving us realistic, complex characters that might actually have you questioning whether they're stereotypes at all. That takes some doing, a lot of sitting around the table talking about what these characters would do, a lot of backstory, and not a little subtlety, and for the most part it works... right up until those final two sequences. Which will likely make you want to go to New York, brave the allegedly-radioactive dust, and kill everyone involved.<br /><br />In other words: worth watching, but prepare yourself for a letdown. **urprises for you (one character seems a touch more noble than you'd think he'd be, for example); the pleasure, if one can call it that, in watching this movie unfold is in seeing just how absurd the personality devolvement will become.

B004FIDW5S|5.0|There is no easy way to explain this movie, hardly some people compare it to Disney but I'm afraid they are two separate ways to picture fantasy, Spirit away as stated on the English title is one of the most awarded animated movies en Germany (back on its release date), Fantasy at it's best, Beautiful message of finding's our own identity if you don't  like this movie, there is something wrong on your idea of adventure, fantasy and magic.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|This is the one of the most amazing shows that I have seen in a long time.  I love both the characters, they play off each other really well.  The filming is perfect as well.

B0064NTZQ2|4.0|&lt;strong>Drive&lt;/strong> (Nicolas Winding Refn, 2011)<br /><br />When the Best-of-2011 lists came out in December and January, at least the lists from those people whose taste in movies I trust, I saw the same two films cropping up at the top. One was &lt;em>Absentia&lt;/em>, which has since come to top my own Best-of-2011 list. The other was &lt;em>Drive&lt;/em>, Nicolas Winding Refn's neo-&lt;em>noir&lt;/em> starring Ryan Gosling, which is finally got round to seeing last night. It's not the best film of 2011 (there is little wrong with it, but when it goes wrong, it goes &lt;em>way&lt;/em> wrong; more on that later), but it's pretty fantastic.<br /><br />I should note for the record that I've been a Ryan Gosling fan since &lt;em>Breaker High&lt;/em>. Yes, I admit it. (And if you've never checked &lt;em>Breaker High&lt;/em> out, the actor playing Gosling's buddy is Tyler Labine. That show packed some serious young talent.) He's always been a good actor for edgy, unlikable characters; check &lt;em>The Believer&lt;/em> or &lt;em>The United States of Leland&lt;/em>. Gosling has been treading the same basic ground as Joseph Gordon-Levitt, and doing it just as well, for the same time period, but we look at him and think \\"hey, it's that nice, clean-cut kid from &lt;em>The Notebook&lt;/em>!\\". And then he pops up in &lt;em>Drive&lt;/em> and people still manage to be shocked. (Go back and re-watch &lt;em>The Believer&lt;/em>, which is just as good as &lt;em>Drive&lt;/em>, for a little perspective.)<br /><br />Gosling plays Driver, a mechanic/stunt driver who moonlights as a freelance getaway guy for small-time crooks pulling heists. (The opening sequence of the film is a great account of this side job.) All is going well in Driver's life until Irene (&lt;em>An Education&lt;/em>'s Carey Mulligan) and her son Benicio (Kaden Leos in his screen debut), his neighbors from down the hall, enter his life. Driver starts to see what a life he has never allowed himself--a stable home, a family--looks like, and it's a powerful attraction. Problem is, Irene's husband Standard (&lt;em>Sucker Punch&lt;/em>'s Oscar Isaac) is getting out of prison. And he's in debt to some guys. And maybe needs a getaway driver...<br /><br />The plot, from a Hossein Amini script adapted from a James Sallis novel, is pretty standard stuff for &lt;em>noir&lt;/em>, where everyone's a criminal and life is incapable of ending well for anyone involved. The best parts of this film are in the way Amini writes the characters, especially the minor characters, and how Refn brings those characters to life. (It helps that most of those minor characters are played by very big names, including Ron Perlman, Bryan Cranston, Albert Brooks, Christina Hendricks, and Russ Tamblyn, among others.) Our ability to empathize with Driver, a character written to have the best poker face in the movies, is pretty impressive, and that's down to the combination of Amini's writing, Refn's directing, and Gosling's acting, all of which are impeccable here.<br /><br />The movie only really goes wrong in its incidentals. The soundtrack is &lt;em>awful&lt;/em>, saccharine and overbearing and as subtle as a sledgehammer to the face. In other words, it is everything the script is not, and it detracts from the movie in a fundamental way by being so painfully obvious. There's also a sense that, towards the end, some stuff is missing, though that sense is minor enough that I could have been reading more into it than there actually was (specifically, I got the feeling there was history between Rose and Driver/Shannon that went way beyond what we saw, but there's zero actual evidence of this save some of the things Rose says to each of them towards the end of the movie). If I'm right, well, I'd have gladly spent another half an hour in the company of these characters and the dark clouds that hang over them in order to explore that further.<br /><br />And while I've been hammering on the acting job Gosling did in this flick, I don't want to take away from Carey Mulligan's job here, which is heartbreaking. There's a great, great shot in this flick as we're looking at her through a stationary camera placed in an elevator as the door's getting ready to close. She stands stock-still and everything we need to know about not only her character, but the entire rest of the movie, is contained in the expression on her face. As much as this word is overused in American dialogue, I think it's warranted here--that shot is awesome, in the classic sense of the word. It inspires awe. I'd stick it in the modern film canon right there with the abduction scene in &lt;em>Rabbit-Proof Fence&lt;/em> or the ten-minute shot at the center of Haneke's &lt;em>Funny Games&lt;/em> or the dance at the beginning of &lt;em>Werckmeister Harmonies&lt;/em>. It's that good.<br /><br />Do I need to tell you I'm recommending this movie? See it ASAP. ****ere's a great, great shot in this flick as we're looking at her through a stationary camera placed in an elevator as the door's getting ready to close.

0307949435|5.0|I found this book readable, logical and well presented which isn't always the case with science writing. I agree with the authors conclusions. However, I don't think it is likely to create a diet revolution. The dietary limits suggested are so restrictive that I wonder how many people can follow them for any period of time. Everyone I know who lost weight on the Atkins Diet soon gained it back and more<br />because they found it impossible to maintain the required diet restrictions. It may have worked for our ancestors, who didn't have a choice, but I don't think it is going to impact our obesity epidemic when we are surrounded by abundance and choices. I don't think we have found the answer yet.<br /><br />I have been on a low carb diet since I read this book. I am at my ideal weight, my last blood test results were excellent and best of all I feel great and have energy to spare. I am never hungry and have had no problem adhering to the low carb lifestyle. So I changed my rating to 5 stars and I would highly recommend low carb living and Gary Taubs book. I followed the Adkins plan.

0060775858|4.0|Margaret Wise Brown, &lt;strong>Goodnight Moon&lt;/strong> (Harper, 1947)<br /><br />How does one review a classic? Especially when one is going to say it isn't perfect? Don't get me wrong, I love this book, and I've long lost count of the number of times I've read it over the years, both as a child myself in the sixties and seventies and reading it to my kids in the nineties and now. And maybe my problem with it is as minor as minor comes (the rhythm, impeccable in the rest of the book, hits a snag on the line \\"and a young mouse\\", which is missing a syllable necessary to keep it in line with everything else). But still... you'd think in a book this short the author would pay that much more attention to each line, wouldn't you? Not that you need me to tell you--I don't think I've ever met anyone who has never encountered &lt;em>Goodnight Moon&lt;/em> before--but you'll jar on that line the first time you hit it. Otherwise... perfect. **** ½

B0017JMOSE|1.0|This \\"Brubeck Time Out Remastered\\" is NOT and audiophile recording.  The audio is muddy and lackluster.  Perhaps an overused stamping mother was used, or perhaps some overly aggressive noise reduction between the master source and the lathe? Compare this to an original Columbia Brubeck pressing and you will hear a vast difference.  The originals are bright and warm and sound almost like a direct to lathe recording.  Even the 1974 \\"All Time Greatest Hits\\" compilation has astonishing depth.  This new \\"remastered\\" recording sounds like the signal passed through a wet blanket somewhere in the audio chain, or as if it was mastered from a commercial CD copy.  On the plus side the packaging/cover is a terrific and faithful representation of the original and the material is ... well... it's Brubeck so it's great, but the audio is just not good at all.  I had high hopes for this album given all the new technology out there but any Brubeck fan, or true audiophile, will be greatly disappointed... as I was.

B00772M1F6|5.0|I first saw JD McPherson on Conan's show about a month ago, when he performed \\"North Side Gal,\\" and immediately my ears perked up.  This CD hasn't left my car in the two days since I first bought it. Quite simply it is a very solid record from beginning to end, sure to delight tapeheads who love vintage rockabilly.  Another commenter above said it about right; had this record been released in say, 1957, it might have possibly disappeared amidst the heyday of Little Richard, Elvis, Buddy Holly, and so on. Now, it has the benefit of standing alone in a sea of vapid bubble pop that has dominated the scene for about the last ten years. Old is the new New.<br /><br />I like how McPherson includes his fellow musicians Jimmy Sutton and Andy Hall on the cover title.  That's rare, and it makes me think that while most of the songwriting is JD's, my guess is that Sutton and Hall were huge in giving a lot of the songs real polish in the studio. It's a good partnership amongst these three, one that makes me hopeful that they will work on another album together soon.<br /><br />Perfect album to give to your grandfather who says there is no good music like the old days out there any more.  This will change his mind. Alternately, you can keep it for yourself and pretend your morning commute is more like a tear through rural, seatbelt-optional Oklahoma.  Personal favorites on this album are the third track \\"Fire Bug\\" and especially the slow, piano-tainted \\"A Gentle Awakening.\\"
B007L4HFDI|5.0|The 2012 reboot of the Spider-man saga has raised some questions in my mind as I read some of the reviews.  I'm not here to belittle the new \\"Amazing\\" version.  I actually liked it.  But I do have questions as to why it needed to be remade.  Then I started thinking of remakes of \\"Let The Right One In\\" and \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" and all version are very good.  I hadn't seen the original film for 9 years give or take, so I decided to load the still virgin Blu ray disc into the player.<br /><br />Every once in a while I won't be able to help myself make a comparative observation.  For example, the \\"Amazing\\" version spends the first hour or so, telling the back story of Peter Parker's parents and their mysterious disappearance.  This is never addressed at all in the 2002 version reviewed here.  Parker (Tobey Maguire) is taunted at school for being a geek, much of that coming from Mary Jane's (Kirsten Dunst) thuggish boyfriend Flash (\\"True Blood's\\" Joe Manganiello).<br /><br />During a field trip to Oscorp's laboratories, Peter gets bitten by a genetically altered spider.  This happens early in the film.  Becoming ill, Peter awakens the next day with perfect eyesight, tossing his previously needed glasses.  He also discovers microscopic barbs on his hands which allow him great gripping power.  You might not remember this but Maguire is also quite toned and fit for this role.  As in \\"Amazing\\" some of the better scenes involve Parker's adaptation to the \\"flying\\" ability.  Unlike \\"Amazing,\\" Maguire's ability to shoot \\"webs\\" from his wrists is inherent in his genetic change.  For whatever reason the new version has Parker developing some form of mechanical wristband that shoots inorganic cables.  I haven't read the comics so I don't know which version is historically correct, but for me, I like idea of the \\"webs\\" being organic.<br /><br />Another difference is that Parker wannabe girlfriend in the 2012 version is Gwen Stacy.  In this original movie it is Mary Jane Watson.  Maguire and Dunst have great chemistry and it comes out in their moments together, irrespective of Maguire being Parker or Spidey at the time.  Willem Dafoe, like Maguire, plays two roles in the film.  One is the deposed head of Oscorp and one is the evil Green Goblin, Spider-man's primary foe.  Dafoe teams up once again with the great British actress, Rosemary Harris, who he worked with in 1994's \\"Tom and Viv.\\"  Here Harris is Peter's aunt and she adds some real class to the film.  Her performance here and in Spider-man 2 is truly heartfelt, providing the moral compass to young Parker.<br /><br />J. K. Simmons (\\"Juno\\") is on hand to add some comic relief as the newspaper editor.  His assistant is Elizabeth Banks (\\"The Hunger Games\\").  Also watch for Oscar winner Octavia Spencer (\\"The Help\\") as a clerk at the wrestling match Peter enters to win some money.  And blink-and-you'll-miss-her, Lucy Lawless (TV's \\"Spartacus\\") shows up as a punk rocker.  The bottom line is that I liked this original Spider-man marginally more than the reboot.  Maybe it was the now iconic upside down kiss between Spidey and M.J.<br /><br />The Blu ray disc has a 1.85:1 aspect ratio and a 1080p HD picture.  Although it shows a bit of grain it is consistent with the original film.  The colors are good and the blacks are black.  The audio is an excellent Dolby TrueHD 5.1 and is really superb.  I have no complaints about the disc quality.Watson.  Maguire and Dunst have great chemistry and it comes out in their moments together, irrespective of Maguire being Parker or Spidey at the time.

This is a great album, and I don't even like Jazz (or so I thought)(if this is even Jazz, tells you what I know about Jazz).  It better when you listen to it with your Bose headphones and you can hear the entire ensemble. Buy it, touch it, love it.

031606792X|1.0|I have only ever written one other review in my life. With the second half of the movie coming out soon, I thought it would be a good idea to post a current review and warning of the hot mess your kids will soon be seeing on the big screen.  I wanted to like Breaking Dawn, I really did. I have read the first three books at least five times. Meyer is no Bronte or Austin, but they are a great idea and the idea of the forbidden lovers and what they must face to be together is very compelling. I think she did a good job.    Then along came the God awful tragedy that is Breaking Dawn.    Dear Lord, the IMPRINTING. There is no way to sugar coat what has been done to Jacob. He has been reduced to a pedophilic family dog. Seriously, SM, as a Christian how can you POSSIBLY explain away... \\"Hey baby, I changed your diapers and packed you around as a kid. Come sit on Uncle Jake's knee... Oh, wait, now you are old enough, let's get busy!\\".. EEEWWWW! There is NO way to make that right, and SHAME on you. I am completely disgusted with your comments that your beliefs come across in your novels. So you keep Edward and Bella chaste and make it ok for your favorite character to become a pedophile. Just, wrong.    For the rest of everyone's issues, I agree, so I won't go into any more repeated detail. It ruined the romance, Edward as we loved him doesn't exist and Bella went from a whiny brat to insufferably vain. I weep for the star-crossed couple in Twilight. I miss them terribly. It has been re-hashed over and over. I just wanted to say, Stephanie, I hope you will issue an apology and try to right the wrong you have done to your fans. I fear that if you don't, your career is over. It is as far as I am concerned and once more parents see this second half of the movie.... Ugh.    On a side note, if someone could PLEASE explain to me what the hell \\"eyes tightened\\" means, I would greatly appreciate it. Those two words have got to be in these books over 5,000 times and I have no idea what she is trying to say other than glaring? Squinting? Wth?

0385751532|4.0|INTEREST IN THE BOOK: The title grabbed me.  The back of my book does not have the above synopsis. It is a much simpler synopsis that leaves room for imagination. However, it is pretty obvious, to me, what the story was about from the start. If it is not obvious to you, then I suggest you do not continue reading this review, as you may be spoiled.<br /><br />FIRST IMPRESSIONS: The book begins when Bruno comes home and finds his maid, Maria, packing up his clothes. He is infuriated and asks his mother what is happening. She explains that the family is moving. Bruno loves his home and friends in Berlin, and he is quite unhappy about this news. He does not want to leave his \\" three best friends for life\\" or his five-story house that has loads to offer in terms of exploration. He arrives to his new home in \\"Out-With\\" and his entire world changes.<br /><br />CHARACTERS: Bruno is an interesting nine-year-old who is smart for his age but absolutely clueless about the outside world. This is evident from his many comments about his life. I blame his parents, who have kept Bruno and his 12-year-old sister, Gretel, pretty sheltered. For good reason, in their eyes. It was quite amazing to experience life outside of Bruno's new home. Throughout the story, Bruno matures greatly from a simple friendship with Shmuel, who lives on the other side of the vast fence that Bruno can see from his bedroom window. Neither boy is aware of the reasons they are different and most live on opposite sides of a fence. Neither boy is knowledgeable as to why they are supposed to hate one another and why they cannot play together.<br /><br />Bruno's father is a high-ranking SS official who mans the \\"Out-With\\" camp. His mother is a flighty woman who is obviously depressed, and his 12 year-old sister, Gretel, is pretty much a troll. I wanted to kick her on many occasions but she is definitely a product  of her environment. It is very obvious that these two children are kept quite sheltered, despite their father's involvement in such atrocities. They are never allowed in Father's office, which is \\"Out Of Bounds At All Times and No Exceptions.\\" They are given orders and tasks but nothing is ever explained to them. Gretel at one point tries to explain something to Bruno about Jews, but even she can't identify why they are different and \\"Opposite\\" and must \\"hate\\" them. His father's too busy, mother sleeps all the time, and Gretel talks to her dolls, so Bruno is left to his own devices to discover life. You can learn a lot from reading, but children learn about life through socialization with others.<br /><br />WORLD-BUILDING: The world is not new and unfortunately, a part of our world's history. A part we all wish to forget. Bruno is our narrator, and we see the world through his eyes. His  innocence makes you gasp, and you immediately wish you could revert back to the days when the world was so simple, when you knew of nothing much other than playing with new toys and new friends.<br /><br />I've seen a ton of criticisms about this book on Goodreads, and while everyone is allowed their opinion, I'm a tad shocked at their responses. Children are children - NOT adults. Bruno was nine-years old and in my eyes, that is pretty young.  We're talking living less than a decade of life. I work with children and while they can be very imaginative, resilient, inquisitive and observant, they are still children with little life experience and even less socialization. And the growth that Bruno experiences is very much apparent. He isn't the most observant person you will ever meet, but neither is half the world, if you ask me.<br /><br />Yea, the horrors of the Holocaust were far, far more horrifying than portrayed in this book. However, Bruno was not a prisoner in the camp, and this is a middle-grade book. Let's keep it kinda not nightmare-inducing, k? I don't doubt that middle-graders can digest such horrors, but there is plenty of room for discussion with those children once this book is closed. Discussions in which they may learn about far worse scenarios in these camps, but they will have adults available to them in which to process their feelings and thoughts, and that is a much better way to learn and grow and mature and experience life, from my perspective...<br /><br />And personally, those who complained about such things missed the entire message of this book.<br /><br />LASTING IMPRESSIONS: This was a powerful story, full of innocence and compassion and what it means to be human. The ending will leave you feeling many intense emotions. I was not expecting what I received when I opened this book, and it is one I will not soon forget.<br /><br />FAVORITE QUOTE<br /><br />\\"What exactly was the difference? he wondered to himself.

I guess if yours do, you could buy this book, but that wouldn't cure the problem of the amateurish plotting and character development.  I couldn't get through it.<br /><br />The sales success of this book makes me ashamed to be a woman.  If men were reading offensive junk like this, we'd be up in arms.

It is the light hearted version of  horror movie \\"The Omen.\\"  You follow several characters including a very entertaining duo of angels (one bad, one good, although neither are particularly bad).  I got a little confused sometimes by the broken english written throughout the book but I got over it.  Overall it is a very funny version of the apocalypse, not intended to be taken seriously.
B008D28HYS|4.0|i bought this game after the original CrossMe was the amazon free app of the day. i had finished all the puzzles and needed more! when they first released CrossMe Color, it had a few bugs. they seem to have fixed those bugs; but about a month ago both CrossMe and CrossMe Color had major updates in which Scoreloop was added. i don't use that junk; it doesn't bother me, but that's mostly because i don't log in to it. i don't feel the need to share every last thing i do with the internet. i've noticed that both CrossMe and CrossMe Color were a bit slow to load in general after they added Scoreloop...all in all, a pretty good game. they keep adding more puzzles too.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|I love this game!!<br /><br />That being said, it is deffinitely not for everyone.  Please, please, please, download the trial version first and discover whether or not this game suits your tastes.<br />[[ASIN:B004UBM7Z6 Star Traders RPG]]<br /><br />OK, now that I've got that out of the way, let me give you a synopsis of what this game is.  In essence, this game is a very classic RPG with lots of number crunching going on behind the scenes.  If you aren't willing to understand how the numbers impact each other, you're probably not going to enjoy this product.  You play the captain of a star ship in a setting that's sort of a mix between Firefly and Dune.  You travel between various planets and build up a reputation (for good or ill) amongst the various factions.  You do this by trading goods, battling other starships and performing missions.  The factions work in a similar manner to those of the Grand Theft Auto II gangs (the old overhead 2D version), where you build reputation in one group often at the expense of another group.  The only specific goal is to earn as much loot and reputation as possible.  How you get there is up to you.<br /><br />The developers of this game are very active and even go to great lengths reviewing these Amazon reviews to correct any errors.  I originally owned this on an older phone, but deleted it due to the number of hours I was wasting staring at a little screen.  If that sounds like a slight, it isn't.  This game is addictive!  Skip ahead a year and I find myself re-installing it on a newer phone, only to discover that it's been updated so often that it's hardly the same game!  So if this sounds like your cup of tea, then download the free version and find out.  You won't be disappointed.<br /><br />P.S.  Having seen where the developers have posted follow ups to other reviews, I assume they read them all and just wanted to pass on my thanks.
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Great film that tells the story of a group of heros that mainstream news didn't share enough about. Excellent storie of their dedication to our country.<br />Some excellent acting and drama mixed in to round out the film. Loved it!
B0086QS7N2|1.0|Man, I hear what Rush did from Fly By Night until Presto, and hear this last works.<br />I just CAN´T BELIEVE is the same band....<br />I really can´t understand what happens.<br />I see that they really want to do great songs and compositions.<br />But...Oh God.<br />How a soberb inspiration go out that way??!!<br /><br />If they want to TRY to return to the roots, they need, first of all, call again<br />the producer Terry Brown (producer from all Rush albuns, until Signals).<br /><br />To me, the REAL Rush inspiration go until Signals.
B005LAIH9K|5.0|It was the main man movie. It was a perfect ending to the series i wish it would show kevin getting married and oz striker.
B007SGM084|5.0|This is by far one of the best books I've read in a long time!!! I finished the trilogy and started reading from the beginning again!!! Can't wait for the movie!!! If u like kinky, romantic, fun, free-spirited and fantasy wrapped up into sexy characters, then this book is for u!!!
B0000C8AW5|4.0|While not a top favourite for me(a category reserved for BOTT, Desire, Highway 61 and the critically panned Infidels), Planet Waves is a satisfying trip through some good stuff, tho' some of the tracks are pretty dark. I thought Dylan almost at his humourous best with 'On a Night Like This' and 'Forever Young' is a classic, albeit one where I prefer Joan Baez' beautiful interpretation. 7/10.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|Wow, our family really liked this movie.  It was amazing how so many different kinds of people with competing \\"self interest\\" just decided to work together for something they all wanted.  The whales plight captured the attention of the nation during the cold war.  How fitting that even that could not survive the compelling cause to save the whales.  We've watched it several times.  If you want to see a powerful gripping story that is based on real life and inspires you this is it.  Gotta see it as a FAMILY!!! Lots of positive influence of working together, finding common ground, going beyond initial commitments to do more than you promised just because it is the right thing to do.  Even the villain changes...
B007R3AZNK|5.0|If you don't like this CD then go listen to Lawrence Welk and stop complaing!<br /><br />Joe B is the bomb and amazing.  I have seen him perform 3 times in the past year and he does NOT disappoint.  This new CD is awesome.  I encourage anybody to see him perform live.
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|\\"Trespassing\\" (Deluxe) by Adam Lambert is probably the best collection of songs I've heard, bar none. Every single song is worthy of \\"top of the chart\\" success. The songs flow flawlessly together and each captures Adam's vocal abilities to perfection. I was a little apprehensive following the release of \\"Beg for Mercy\\". It was a disappointment after the \\"Glam Tour\\", but \\"Trespassing (Deluxe) blew me away! I can't wait to hear what he has in store for us down the road. His musical talent is unstoppable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard a lot of buzz about this book and finally had to check it out for myself. I downloaded the Kindle app on my iPod and within seconds had the first book downloaded. 18 hours later, I had read through the first book and was moving on to the second book. I continued and finished the third. This book may not have been written by a professional author, but the love story she weaves between Ana and Christian is electrifying! I found it impossible to put down; not because of the erotic BDSM scenes, but because I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next for these two characters. The dialogue James pens is real. I feel as if Ana could be my coworker or fellow dorm mate in school. With all of Christian Grey's 50 shades, you just can't help but want to hold him and love him. In addition, I feel this book is very liberating as it has given women the permission to embrace their more sensual side knowing you're not \\"dirty\\" or \\"perverted' to share in a \\"playful\\" sexual relationship with a consenting partner. Say what you will about the book, it is doing exactly what it was intended to do and that is to be a best seller and to get women and men alike reading again!

B00881VLCE|4.0|I like how you can download free puzzles. You can also change the number of pieces to make it easier or harder. An all around great app.
B007SSDS24|4.0|We really enjoyed The Darkest Hour.  It is a great movie that pulled in Mom & Dad and teenage daughter.  It was nice to have a Sci-Fi thriller without all the blood and gore...  How they pull off the win in the end is really interesting.  It's a good movie with enough suspense to get you on the edge of your chair.  Good defeats evil of course, but also has very strong theme of \\"keep trying - don't give up\\"
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really love this app!  I have the weather at my fingertips without ever having to search through the Internet.  And its very accurate, well as accurate as weather can be! ;)
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I read all three books hoping they would get better, which the story line did. I found myself skipping the erotic parts and just sticking to the story, I think this would have been a better trilogy had more of the sex been left to our imagination. It became boring and predictable.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I had the pleasure of reading the paperback version of WOOL, signed by Mr. Howey and shipped all the way up to Toronto. WOOL 1 and 2 are sensational. The words flow like poetry and the atmosphere is tangible- like dust floating around a sunlit room, the story zooms in and out of each grain floating in slow motion, with Howey wringing significance out of every particle. WOOL 3, 4 and 5 are action packed thrillers with splashes of mystery and suspense. Certainly a revolutionary tale, very well spun like a thread of good yarn (pardon the pun).  Chances are if you're reading this, you've either read, or are in the process of reading the WOOL Omnibus, and if you're not, you're about to. Congratulations Hugh Howey, you've created a real gemstone!

B0047T86G0|5.0|This is a valuable resource for those who care about language. To make it searchable all you have to do is make it the Kindle default dictionary -- a quick and easy setting that can be changed to any other compatible dictionary at any time.<br /><br />The reviewer who claims this dictionary is not searchable on a Kindle apparently doesn't understand the difference between the \\"Search this book\\" option and the \\"Search dictionary\\" option. It is all clearly spelled out in the Kindle User Guide.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|I was debating for a long time between this stand and the mStand by Rain Design. Eventually the price one so I got the Griffin stand.<br /><br />Overall I'm very happy with my purchase. It lifts my laptop (14 inch) to a great height, it's open in the middle so my laptop keeps cool, and whenever I need to move, it will fold down easily and take no room at all.<br />I also love the space at the bottom where i keep my keyboard when i'm not using it.<br /><br />Some people mentioned that it's bouncy when you type on it. That shouldn't matter at all, because if you're keeping a laptop on a stand, you shouldn't be typing on it regularly. (That would mean that either the laptop screen is way too low, or that you need to raise your hands too high to reach the keyboard).<br /><br />I like the slight angle that it gives the keyboard. It's slanted enough that I can see the keyboard and use it when I need too, but it's shallow enough that it doesn't take a lot of vertical space.<br /><br />I used it a few times with my 15.6'' laptop as well, and it worked just fine. No complaints.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|In this book I also liked the story and the characters, but by now the erotica is gone. its boring and very plain.
0143113100|4.0|Norman Doidge, M.D.'s The Brain that Changes Itself is a neuroscience enthusiast's Chicken Soup for (Insert Audience) equivalent. The book includes heartwarming success stories of neurological disabled victims, the scientific pursuits of neuroscience pioneers, and scientific theory. The highlights of this book are putting scientific principles (i.e. neuroplasticity, mapping, neuronal regeneration) in layman's terms by using examples of people who have been studied and seen to undergo these concepts. In a case study, a woman had rewired her half brain to act as a whole one. However, the explanations of neuroscientific concepts are brief and cannot substitute learning the material textbook. Also, the accounts are misleading in which all severe brain damaged people will achieve extremely successful neuroplasticity and normal function. As another highlight, the personal accounts magically give scientists a personality beyond the lab bench. Dr. Doidge poignantly writes on the motivations of each individual scientist, their process of reasoning, and how they established the frontiers of neuroscience. To an established researcher, many of the essential lab techniques are missing from the text, and only general overviews are given for research that spans at least 20 years. Although the book reads like a Freakanomics where multiple cases are presented, the lack of evident plot and unrelated accounts proves to be overdone by the end of the 427-page book. Thus, due to the entertainment and simple, easy-to-read style for the average person on a complex subject balanced with lengthiness and generality, this book is reviewed at 4 out of 5 stars.

030758836X|3.0|The book is interesting and keeps you guessing for a while.  You begin to suspect and wonder, naturally, what has gone awry in this marriage.  Then finally little clues throw in surprising twists and telling details.  And no sooner does Flynn have you thinking one thing...you find out something else, which breaks down what you thought you knew.  Basically, it's a page turner--in the beginning.<br /><br />It becomes clear what is happening and why. You realize who is responsible for the horrid turn of events in this marriage (although both husband and wife clearly have their own inner demons that they are fighting).<br /><br />And while some aspects are believable the notion of infallibility when it comes to setting up the perfect crime is a stretch, especially for someone who doesn't have a background in law enforcement or forensics (the get-away-with-murder plan is completely self-taught by watching cops shows and reading crime books).<br /><br />The ending was quite disappointing considering the fact that the individual responsible for murder and other crimes faces NO real questioning by law enforcement.  Poorly executed ending, but I won't hold that against the writer.  There's solid writing, good suspense, and nice character development that can't be ignored.<br /><br />I think I would have been sold on the ending if there were some close calls (e.g., being called in for questioning on the basis of suspicion, being jailed for a night until bail was posted, spotty evidence that just didn't stick, having someone of the law make a \\"knowing\\" remark to the perp in passing).  The tension in the book is directed at only one person and there's never a real moment that matters when something is found out that's causing the criminal to feel like things have gotten out of hand or isn't going according to plan.  Never.  The criminal is always cool, capable, calculating, and always, always in control.  It seemed very skewed from the beginning because there is clearly one person in charge the entire time and everyone else is 10 steps behind.<br /><br />I wouldn't care if the \\"suspect\\" (using the word loosely because the person was never really considered a suspect by police to the degree as to be pursued) got away or not.  It was just hard for me to buy how things ended. It just seemed unsatisfactory.<br /><br />3-stars: I didn't think the book was horrible.  I quite enjoyed reading it.

0345803485|3.0|I think there was just too much hype about this book before I got it-yes it is scandalous, but the writing is terrible-no character development or depth whatsoever. Normally I can't stop reading until I finish a book but it took me forever.

B004FGFQBS|5.0|This move is THE standard for all sci-monster flix!  This move began my love for alien monster movies (well Alien actually but this is better).  Ripley returns to avenge her hunted down crew, and hopefully save some miners in the process.  Acting- 5 Stars, Monster- 5 Stars, Mechanics- 5 Stars, Pucker Factor- 5 Stars!  All you need for a great Horror Masterpiece!  Again, the one star guy is... Well a little slow on the uptake, if you get my meaning.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|Top to Bottom, musically and lyrically this clearly is the best RUSH album since the \\"classic\\" 1974-1982 era for the band.  This concept album really doesn't have a weak moment on it and as a whole stands up with anything in that \\"classic\\" period.  While I jumped on the Rush bandwagon in the late 70's, I admit I started wavering around Grace under Pressure when the band became heavy with synths and by the time Hold Your Fire came along I had pretty much written them off.  Somewhere around Counterparts I started listening to the bands albums again and have continued to buy each of their discs and with the exception of Vapor Trails and maybe Feedback have in time come to appreciate each of their albums. This one is different. This one has more immediacy to it.  All the songs are great, the concept of the album is great and the thing just flows like a great album should.<br /> The first 3 songs immediately were standouts that grabbed me.  After playing the remainder of the album a few times, the story line clicks and the songs just jump out. All are memorable.  The closer which is The Garden is fantastic.  The playing feels stronger, more energized and the songs standout over some of the prior releases.  (Kudos on the production to Nick Rakulinecz for getting the most out of the band. Exceptional)<br /> It's nice to look forward to the upcoming tour and hoping they will play a heavy dose of the new album instead of awaiting the same old hits that are rehashed over and over on classic rock radio.  A Masterpiece!

It is good.<br /><br />'Kay, scratch that, it is more than good.<br /><br />The first time I saw Cinder, I thought it sounded totally ridiculous.<br /><br />Then I saw that it was getting really good reviews. And it was starting to sound more and more interesting. Sci-fi Cinderella could work, I thoguht. That's interesting and new.<br /><br />So, finally, I caved in and bought it.<br /><br />I FREAKING LOVED IT!<br /><br />Meyer gives us a very original version of Cinderella. This takes all those fantasy fairy tale retellings (the ones that take place in Ye Olde Medieval Tymes setting) and throws them out the window. Instead, we're treated to a futuristic Beijing. Cool, right?<br /><br />Cinder herself was a very likable character. I liked her personality quirks and all the details of her cyborg-ness. She was a strong character and she didn't let her stepfamily bring her down.<br /><br />Kai, the leading man, was also a likable character. I liked that some of the story was told from his point of view, so we could get some of the prince's perspective on the Cinderella story.<br /><br />I loved Iko, Cinder's robot friend. She was good comic relief, with her attempts to be more humanlike. I also liked Peony, Cinder's younger stepsister. She wasn't in much of the book, but I still found her to be a likable protaognist.<br /><br />I liked that we get more depth to the stepmother and the other stepsister. While maybe a little over-the-top, we come to understand why they are the way they are.<br /><br />Queen Levana was an interesting antagonoist. The Lunars are an interesting race and I think she will be a very interesting villain for the rest of the series.<br /><br />Like I said before, the setting of this novel is interesting. It's set in the future, but it's not a dystopia. It's nice that we finally get a view of a futuristic place other than America. This book is set in China, which was a fresh new setting, as opposed to yet another \\"ruined North America.\\"<br /><br />Meyer throws in all sorts of fun stuff with this retelling. Not only is the setting unique, there's cyborgs and androids and the plague has returned and there's a kingdom on the moon! It was all very fun and original and unique.<br /><br />I love her shout-outs to the original Cinderella story. I love that the car she fixes is \\"pumpkin orange\\" and that she goes to the ball with a too-small foot and a dirty dress.<br /><br />My only complaint with the book is that it's pretty predictable. As soon as a key component to a plot twist is brought up, you know what's going to happen. Most people could guess the plot twist a few hundred pages before it's even revealed. But for me, this wasn't major enough to interfere with how much I love this book.<br /><br />Cinder was an original take on a fairy tale that I loved.

B007EW9ISM|5.0|I use it mostly for writing and occasionally some sketching. It has a comfortable grip and allows writing with good precision. Unlike other styli, the tip is quite firm which provides writing experience similar to whiteboard markers. The only nit is that it require you to put slightly more pressure while writing than a real pen but I think that's something I can easily adjust to. Overall, very satisfied with the product.

030758836X|5.0|I thought this book was going to be an average murder mystery but it's not and I loved it for it.  I haven't read any other books by this writer but I will now. I cannot reveal too much about the plot of the book without giving important details away so I will just give a brief overview.  When the book begins, Amy Elliot Dunne, wife of handsome writer Nick Dunne, has gone missing and we see their points of view in different timeframes;  hers through diary entries when they first met in NYC and his through the current day, aka the day she has gone missing.  What we see is a once electrifying love affair which has crumbled into an unhappy marriage - but not is all as it appears.  My only gripe really concerns the ending.  I won't give anything away but it was kind of...depressing.  However, the author really develops fascinatingly, complex characters that are gray, not black and white.  I especially so got a kick on her take of only children (I am one) and the &#34;Cool Girl&#34; syndrome.  The author as well as the characters keep you on your toes.  Great summer read!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|As an avid David Fincher fan, I'm pleased with my purchased. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo has become a classic among my blu-ray collection. I enjoyed the dark tone of the film as well as the acting, specifically Roony Mara (Lisbeth). Having previously watched it online, I looked to purchase the Blu-ray/DVD combo, which I found for a good deal on Amazon. The video and audio on the transfer are outstanding, it's definitely worth spending more for the blu-ray. I did have an issue downloading the UltraViolet digital copy but eventually got it working. Highly recommended if you find it on sale.
B007JVJ3C4|2.0|The movie I am now reviewing is called, \\"Ghost Rider 2: Spirit of Vengeance,\\" and its starring Nicolas Cage, Johnny Whitworth (played in \\"Limitless\\"), and Idris Elba. This movie came out on February 17, 2012. I actually got the chance to watch this movie in the movie theater. Honestly, I thought the first Ghost Rider movie wasn't bad. Even though a lot of people I talked to really didn't like it. When I saw the previews for this film (Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance). I was thinking to myself, \\"I have to see this.\\" I thought the first one wasn't bad and it looked like the second coming of the Ghost Rider series was going to be even better.<br /><br />This movie is about a dare devil named Johnny Blaze. Johnny Blaze has made a deal with the Devil, and he is trying to figure out how he can save humanity from the Devil and not kill everyone in the process as he does it.<br /><br />To break this movie down and come up with a couple sentences or a paragraph to describe it was way more difficult for me then it was suppose to be. This movie is a mess! There were just too many things going on that had me confused. I, to a strong degree, almost didn't understand the plot to the movie. Granted I wasn't a big fan of Ghost Rider comics, there may be something's that I need to understand about the Ghost Rider. I don't think all the understanding in the world could have this film. There isn't a \\"we are the world\\" song we could sing to save this film. This could have been a movie that could have had a basic plot and my have been successful. This movie needed more action! People want to see what the Ghost Rider can do. There were very little action scenes and the one that they gave us wasn't really that great. There's moments in this movie were I'm still trying to figure out what is going on. Then they threw a kid in the mix. Not a good idea to me. Unfortunately, what ended up happening (that I saw coming) was the kid was getting to much attention in the movie. I think I could have come up with a plot better than this and I didn't even read Ghost Rider comics as a kid. It simply sucked and it even sucks more that Nicolas Cage had to be apart of this awfulness.<br /><br />Some things that I did like about the movie (besides the previews) were there were some cool scenes in the movie. Seeing Ghost rider on fire and a chain rapidly coming out of his mouth was awesome. There was one scene in the movie that I liked and thought was funny. It was the scene when Johnny Blaze was trying to get some guy in the hospital to corporate. Being though he was Johnny Blaze just started going crazy and transforming back and forth between Ghost Rider and himself. I also thought some of the camera views were nice. You could tell the director put a lot of work into that.<br /><br />My final rating for this movie is going to be a 4 out of 10. This is an extremely low rating for me. Its very rare I rate movies this low. That should tell you something right there. Don't see this movie on anything. If your super curious or a big Ghost Rider fan than you have my blessing to catch this on Netflix, or borrow it from one of your friends. That's if your friends collect enough nerve to purchase it.

B00065F86U|5.0|I love Nikon cameras (as if someone who didn't would be writing a review on this obscure cover), but my recent purchase of a D300 has taken a further dent out of my pocket for these accessories.<br /><br />I'm a sports shooter, and I wanted the MB-D10 grip to get 8FPS. A bit of research led way to the fact that you can only get 8FPS with the EN-EL4(a) battery type(s). Okay, so aside from the grip, I have to spring over another $100 for a new battery and charger for the battery. Then I take a look in my MB-D10 manual, and discover a reference to a BL-3 cover, which is necessary for the EN-EL4(a) to work in the MB-D10.<br /><br />It works -- what more is there to say. Snap it on the battery and put it in the grip. Congratulations to Nikon for continuing to milk money.<br /><br />Another option is to use the AA battery tray, which also boosts the D300 to 8 FPS. However, as a sports shooter, I need to be able to change batteries quick during games. The idea of having to fiddle with dozens of AA batteries at a game is laughable, and not worth the time. So, if you aren't going to be in a situation in the field where you have time to change AA batteries, you've got little choice.<br /><br />I hope you enjoy my $30, Nikon. You're welcome.
B000002GBB|4.0|Styx may be considered as the band responsible for introducing synth progressive rock to the mass market and producing several top 40 hits during the 70s and early 80s.  Most of their biggest hits had Dennis DeYoung as lead vocalist (Come Sail Away, Mr. Roboto, Don't Let It End, Best of Times) but PIECES OF EIGHT had guitarist Tommy Shaw voicing its two hit singles--RENEGADE and BLUE COLLAR MAN.<br />Styx also bebefitted from its other musicians, especially vocalistguitarist James Young.  PIECES OF EIGHT is Styx at an apex in their career---they kept their die-hard fans but grabbed a new, wider audience in the traditional pop/rock arena.  My favorite tracks:  RENEGADE, a frenetic rocker with an awesome a cappella opening and blistering guitar work; the appropriately theatrical bombast of LORDS OF THE RING; DeYoung's QUEEN OF SPADES and PIECES OF EIGHT, which open with lyric balladry and then explode into seething rockers. And the sumptuously elegant AKU AKU, a remarkable rock instrumental penned by Mr. Shaw.<br />PIECES OF EIGHT is an important 70s album, ushering in a beacon for other prog/rock bands to become more accessible to the mainstream musical audience without sacrificing its inherent musical direction.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book is well written and takes you on an adventure, keeping you guessing the entire way. It's a passionate, fiery romance between two people that draws you in and makes you want more. I related to this book so well, to Abby and to Travis. I couldn't put it down. I felt like I was there with them, every detail creating distinct pictures inside my mind, flashing me back to my life as a teenager at times. I fell in love with this book..and Travis :)

B003Y2BMVC|5.0|I know this was an adaptation, so the people who watched it with the EXPECTATION that it was going to be the same as Treasure Island, of course would be sorely disappointed. Treasure Planet is it's own movie and an endearing, funny, entertaining movie for all ages. I congratulate Disney movies, the writers, director, planners, and all, because they came up with a whole new movie, although based on an old, loved book. They made it original and new, which isn't done too many times with movies anymore. I love all the little characters in this movie. I wish I had a real life Morph!!! Also I love that they spoke to an unfortunate societal fact of today...men leaving their families, children fatherless and wives partnerless. I think it could even be used as a talking point for families that have been affected by that. Bravo Disney!!!
B0083F5J7S|1.0|The new Maroon 5 album is terrible. It's an utter disaster. I really enjoyed \\"Hands All Over\\" and could really relate to a lot of the songs. The song writing on that album told stories of pain, relationships, heartbreak; it had rhythm guitars and drums that sounded normal.<br /><br />Why they would attempt to reinvent themselves is a mystery, especially into a disco sound. And, ultimately I believe they have committed musical career suicide by releasing this album. Did they even listen to this record before they released it?<br /><br />Let's hope they remedy this with an album similar to \\"Hands All Over\\". The only band that has ever successfully reinvented the creative wheel with each album Release is Cornershop, just take a listen to their albums: \\"When I Was Born for the 7th Time\\" to \\"Judy Sucks a Lemon for Breakfast\\" vs. \\"Hand Cream for a Generation\\" to their collaboration with Bubbly Kaur in  \\"The Double-O-Groove Of\\". If Levine wants to reinvent the wheel each album and at least attempt to this successfully, he should really listen to the above mentioned and draw inspiration from those albums by Cornershop.<br /><br />Seriously, if Maroon 5 felt compelled to put an album out for the sake of putting it out should have either:<br /><br />-Sold out and put out a B-sides album to meet contractual agreements with their record company or<br /><br />-Re-recorded some of their old material that were left over from albums previously and fine-tuned them.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I thought the beginning and ending, largely dealing with the financial scandal were overly dry, but the middle dealing with the murder mystery was excellent and definitely kept my attention. The two main characters Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander were very intriguing and I liked both of them almost immediately. There exact relationship to each other being an enigma, it was clear that regardless of the lack of definition they did work well together and developed at least a friendship of significant importance to them both. I look forward to moving on to the second book in this series, The Girl Who Played with Fire.

1936608898|5.0|Words like 'life-changing' and 'revolutionary' have been bandied about incessantly when it comes to the 'diet' market. Every week it seems that there is a new and exciting program guaranteed to 'change your life' and 'melt away the pounds' and 'revolutionize your body'. Blah, blah blah, yada yada.<br />It starts with food IS NOT ABOUT A DIET!! It is not a 'get thin in 30 days' program or a 'look like a super-model in a month!' program.  It is SOOOOO much more that that. It is an emotional and physiological 'reset' for your relationship with food. Dallas and Melissa do not want you to 'get skinny' or 'drop 50 lbs', they want to SAVE YOUR LIFE AND YOUR BODY! The book explains how in a clever and entertaining read. I have been following the program for over six weeks now, and it has TRULY changed my life. I have boundless energy, my skin, hair and nails are gorgeous, and my fibromyalgia is nearly GONE!! Yes, GONE!! I never knew life could be so enjoyable.  Thanks so much to Dallas and Melissa for giving me the tools to re-claim my own zest for life. The thirty pounds lost is just a nice bonus compared to the dramatic change in my attitude, my energy, and my outlook on life.

B0033AX20E|5.0|Valley  of the damned led the emergence of power metal in the metal scene in Europe and North America. Power metal wasn't a popular branch of metal that vibrates through listeners' ears, until the release of the song \\"Valley of the Damned,\\" and latter the album under the same title. Valley of the Damned is still considered to be one of my favorite power metal albums existed and made in the 21st century. A great album with numerous fascinating innovation, creativity, and imagination that overlaying each element to create one unique musical genre.
1410430103|3.0|This is not necessarily a review of this book so much as a review of the Jack Reacher series.  Because, the sad truth is, if you've read three or four, you've read them all.  When I first started reading them I became addicted to the pacing and tension.  But like addictive drugs, the more you consume, the more you need and Lee Child doesn't deliver more, he just gives you more of the same.  His writing is terse and taut, perfect for the genre, but unlike writers like Michael Connelly, neither the character nor the stories become more complex as time goes by.  If you haven't read a Jack Reacher thriller, you're in for a treat.  By the time you read enough of them to see the formula, it's time to move on.

1439102813|5.0|This is a must read for those of us (and there are many) who have loved ones who are either on the brink of or well into some sort of dementia.  My mother and mother-in-law are in varying stages of short-term memory loss and this book helped me understand so much better what they must be going through -- particularly the isolation and confusion.  It also made me recognize some things about myself.  Since I read \\"Still Alice,\\" I've been recommending it to many people.  What an eye-opener.
B00004WPFX|5.0|Homework is considered to be a major influence on the electronic scene in the late 90s and the 2000s, with its innovative sound that depicts the influence and cultural impact of electronic sounds presented in early metal and rock bands are been inherited by musicians to create their own style and genre of the music. It is also the signs of our advance musical technologies in the industry.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I have been a fan of Mr. Groban for many years. I have listened to his voice grow with depth and talent as these years has passed. Unlike some singers who find a niche and stay there for the remainder of their careers, Mr. Groban takes on new challenges and types of music which has moved him from the ordinary into realms which he has nurtured his talent and made it grow. I really have nothing to say negtively about this CD. It is Mr. Groban at his best and one of my favorites.

B001TKMAGW|5.0|Black sabbath has always been described as the creator or a progenitor of heavy metal genre back in the days, and is still regarded as a significant influence on countless hard rock and metal bands that followed at their awake. The deluxe edition of the debut album shows their early demos of how they've reached their distinguishable heavily-distorted blues-rock sound at slow speeds. The deluxe edition is a great collector's item for any hardcore black sabbath fan.
B00009Z576|1.0|I love the music on this CD.  However, for some reason, when I try to play this CD, I get about as much static as I do music.<br />It's just simply got to be a manufacturing problem.  what an absolute waste of time.  enough said.
B005VR9328|4.0|I have been listening to \\"undun\\" since it came out last Christmas and even six months later I am still finding new and interesting things in this record. And I really can't think of a better thing to say about a record.<br />A lot was made of \\"undun\\" being a concept record, and that it is, but unlike many concept record it's one that works in pieces as well. Most of the songs on this record are just fantastic. The playing is obviously terrific. It always has been on Roots records. The writing here is as strong as it has ever been, tight and concise and loose. The guest appearances all fit the vibe and flow of the record and are never flashy and never overdone. Everything here is played to make a great listening experience, and it all achieves.<br />But the real star of the record is Black Thought, who owns every single second he has on the record. I have read reviews of Roots records and have talked to people who believe that Black Thought has been a weak link to the group. Those people are wrong. He keeps getting better with each record, and to this point, this is what he should be remembered for. He guides the record and keeps level an flowing throughout with his best set of songs yet. Anyone who does not believe the man is integral to the group, and one of the most underrated emcees out there, after hearing this record are just insane.<br />And you get all of this in under forty minutes, a perfect running time for an LP. I really have no criticism towards the album. This is my favorite of the Roots records, and shows that they are far from slipping as they get older. They're only getting better.<br />(A note about the rating: I do not give five stars to records. To me, a five star record is something that has stood the test of time. I can't tell if this record will as it is only a few months old. I can see it being a five star record a few years down the line however. I just try not to overinflate my ratings. Thank you.)
B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the three books.  At first I was not sure about reading them, I had heard a lot of bad press and negetative comments about how women were treated in the book.  I found all thoughs comments false, and was delighted to find a very strong woman in Ana Steele, that would not take Christians crap.  It was a delightful, and exciting read, I wish all the books I read was this good, with an amzing love story.
B004P29FSW|5.0|Listening to a soundtrack album of any movie embraces the listener into the world of the movie itself. The soundtracks albums are created for listeners to experience the mood, emotion, and the environment in the movie as it is part of life at the moment. The tron: legacy soundtrack album is a great example of that. It contains 29 songs of bits and pieces written by Daft Punk, for the different scenes in the movie. It is one of the best soundtrack albums out there, in my opinion because of its elegant style of electronic sound as well as the full orchestra incorporation.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|This was probably one of the worst produced movies I have ever watched.  I was most thankfull that it was given to me and I didn't waste the money to purchase it.  The plot was poor and cinematography was worse.<br />Save your time and money on this one!
B007IXGUG0|3.0|Okay, so I am going to be honest with you here: the prospect of a hip-hop album from Wheelchair Jimmy from \\"Degrassi\\" was not something that really interested me. So I skipped \\"Thank Me Later\\". And in all honesty I had no real interest in this record. But, after reading a lot of terrific reviews for the record and seeing it one sale on this site terribly cheap, I decided that I should give it a shot.<br />And I have to admit that I was surprised. The record is better than I thought it had any real reason to be. Drake is not a particularly good rapper (he is clumsy and his punchlines are rarely memorable) and his singing voice is nothing to write home about. But he does have some sort of charm and a clear vision for how he wants his record to sound and flow. That sort of ambition is nice, especially in an era when putting together an entire album is something of a lost art form. He even creates a few memorable songs in the title track, and \\"Crew Love\\", which features the Weeknd. \\"The Real Her\\" features some fairly pedestrian singing, but it does have a verse from Andre 3000, and his presence on the mic always lifts everything he's on. And \\"Lord Knows\\" has a terrific Just Blaze beat and a terrific guest verse from Rick Ross. So even in an album that is clearly meant to be heard from beginning to end there are some top notch individual moments.<br />And the production on the record is unified, and excellent throughout. The record has a great sound, perfect for a drive at three 'o' clock in the morning. The beatmakers and producers (most notably Noah \\"40\\" Shelib, the records main producer) have done a fantastic job here.<br />So why the three star rating? Well, again, Drake is not much of a rapper. His flow is clumsy at best and he rarely has anything of real interest to say. Where someone like Kanye can mix the introspective with the humorous and playfulness, Drake is dead serious. He also occasionally tries to play like some gangster, and that pose is entirely phony and comes across as such.<br />Singing wise he's not much better. His voice warbles, which to some might come across as intimate but to me comes across as just not very good. There is also entirely too much of his singing, especially on the middle section of the record.<br />And there are many songs that don't work. \\"Cameras\\" is boring and drones on for too long. Drake sounds uninterested on \\"We'll Be Fine\\", and that feeling certainly rubs off on the listener. Lead off single \\"Headlights\\" is false bravado that Drake lacks the skills in really selling. And second single \\"Marvin's Room\\" might as well be called \\"Playa Haters Anthem\\", as all it is a dude seriously hating for five endless minutes.<br />So, should you buy \\"Take Care\\"? Sure, why not. I can pretty readily admit that this record was not meant for someone of my disposition and musical tastes, especially in hip-hop, but the record surprised me by not being all that bad. I can understand why people who really dig the dude and what he is doing would find this to be a great record. I don't think it is, but if you find yourself wanting a modern commercial rap record, \\"Take Care\\" is certainly better than anything Waka Flaka Flame has ever put out.nd comes across as such.<br />Singing wise he's not much better.

B0058UXHHK|5.0|It didn't think I would like this book as much as I did. But I got into quickly and found myself sneaking back to my kindle to find out what happens next. I enjoyed watching the heroine develop out of her vulnerabilities into a stronger person, but I wondered why it took her so long to trust the hero of the story. It wasn't like her secret was that bad. That was just a little something that stuck in my mind while I was reading, but it didn't change how much I enjoyed reading the book. I liked it enough to buy the sequel. I haven't started it yet, but I have high hopes.<br /><br />This book reminded me a bit of another fun book I just finished reading.

B0083GCK5G|3.0|The first thing you have to do when approaching a Beach Boys record is know that it's not going to be \\"Pet Sounds\\" or \\"The Smile Sessions\\". I doubt anyone would do that, but if you thought, just maybe... Well, don't.<br />\\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" is everything you would want from a Beach Boys record this late in the game, this far into their career. It's pleasant. It sounds great playing in the background. The harmonies are gorgeous and the arrangements are good. Brian Wilson delivers a bittersweet, beautiful suite of songs to close out the record. Mike Love never really embarrasses himself or the other members.<br />But really, there aren't a whole lot of great songs on this record, the final three not including. There are no really terrible ones (there is no \\"Kokomo\\" here), and a handful of good ones (\\"The Private Life of Bill and Sue\\", \\"Spring Vacation\\") that warrant repeat listens. But nothing here is great either.<br />But I don't really imagine anyone was expecting brilliance out of this record. What they wanted was a good summertime record with songs that would sound okay during their recent reunion tour. And on that level \\"That's Why God Made The Radio\\" is a success.

0449011917|1.0|There is not a lot that I can say about this book that so many others have not already said. Nothing major really happens in this book to advance the overall story of the series.  We get a view of Martin's world through the eyes of a bunch of characters that I really didn't find interesting nor important.<br /><br />I actually stopped listening about 1/3 of the way through and read the synopsis on Wikipedia to see if there was anything interesting that I might have missed.  There wasn't.<br /><br />While his character POV style is interesting, the non-linearity of this technique is downright annoying in this book.  Brienne's search for Sansa that goes on and on and on and on (while the reader already knows she's safe and sound elsewhere) was absolutely mind-numbing.<br /><br />I finally gave up and moved on to another book.  I am currently listening to \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" and, it is slightly better than this one, however, it is no where near as good as the first books in this series.  I fear that the author has lost it.

0767827902|5.0|-I had not seen this movie since it's theatrical release in the 60s.  It is as relevant today as it was then.  The use of black-and-white adds to the feel of a small town in Texas in the 1950s.  The added features help to understand how Bogdanovich achieved the feel of a neo-realist film.  This is a must see for all lovers of fine cinema.

B007FZ7QZA|5.0|Now I'll make no bones about my love of studio oriented,live band soul,funk and R&B from the 70's and early 80's in particular. However music has moved on and it's now various hybrids of hip-hop that is more influential on that genre. Because I shut myself off from changes in the music that occurred during the 1990's I only have myself to blame for finding myself in a musical world I am still finding baffling. True there is a lot of pop music out there lacking almost in any creative ideas. And it's been only recently,for reasons I am not sure about that I began to even take a second notice at the music of Chris Brown. He's been around for more than half a decade. And as stated in my previous review of his album [[ASIN:B000T988DI Exclusive]],I didn't think much of his character. But even with the egoist sound of this introduction,it's the music that interested me. And even with all the whoopdy doo in the press about him I wanted to hear for myself what he was all about. Well I liked the album I just reviewed by him well enough. But this is something quite different.<br /><br />  Electropop has largely bought bubblegum beyond the dark ages. But somehow Chris does something with it here that actually advances the music forward.\\"Turn Up The Music\\" for example blends 70's disco/funk and some afro pop percussion into the electro pop framework with a very fully constructed melody. And it's actually a highlight. Again that \\"africaness\\" in the percussion is returned to on the hyperactive closer \\"Trumpet Lights\\". Chris seems to realize the importance of percussion and African rhythms are to the best quality dance music and he lets it shine on these tracks. But there's more here than that. The production is sleek,rich and uniform from the minimal electronica funk/hip-hop of \\"Bassline\\",the unusually chorded \\"Till I Die\\" and the blunted funky hip-hop of \\"Mirage\\" recorded with Nas. The middle part is particularly impressive. In the beginning Chris is sexually obsessed and profane to the point of obnoxiousness. By the middle,on the pulsing,sleek ballads of \\"Don't Judge Me\\",\\"Biggest Fan\\",\\"Sweet Love\\" and in particular the almost Sade like \\"2012\\" he's dealing with his sensitive side,showcasing the male side of that emotional construct and that it is possible.<br /><br />  \\"Strip\\" is a terrific uptempo number blending some modern electro effects with what's basically \\"old school\\" 70's dance/funk. On \\"Stuck On Stupid\\" and \\"4 Years Old\\" Chris is working his way around almost epic folk type melodies with some wonderful lyrics exploring the coming of age process that comes with the realization of male vulnerability. Considering his recent history that's a very good thing indeed. The medley of \\"Party Hard/Cadillac\\" features a near acapella doo-wop style closer with powerful female singer Sevyn. Only \\"Dont Wake Up\\" evokes anything close to throwaway electropop. But even that's so fully realized as a composition I totally forgive that. Overall this album finds Chris Brown taking a particular style of dance music that's today often associated with just about everything that's flawed and disposable  about dance music and applies rhythmic and melodic complication with them. That gives the music the effect of being modern enough to dancers looking only for beats,but also musically rich enough for casual listening as well. It takes from the past,remains in the present and looks to the future. If Chris chooses to expand his music from this level,even better things are likely to come.to the point of obnoxiousness.

0345529057|4.0|Books arrived in a decent amount of time. Packaging was very acceptable. Books are perfect but the box case that holds the books.... that's a different story. It is like thick paper. Not even a thin type cardboard. Upon opening the books the \\"case\\" ripped open. I taped it back together and over time while getting books out or attempting to put them back in the case has fallen apart. The books are good though. Good print. Good covers. Good books. If  you buy the set, don't plan on keeping the case that holds all 4 of them, its worthless.
B005EVVESM|5.0|BOUGHT THIS CD AS A BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR MY SON-IN-LAW.  THE VENDOR DID A GREAT JOB OF DESCRIBING THE CD ALONG WITH FAST AND ACCURATE SERVICE.
B003VANOFY|5.0|-Pros -<br />Around the ear cup design effectively cancels noise and provides high level of comfort for prolonged periods of time, especially for those like myself that wear glasses.<br /><br />Provides superior sound quality, I hear things I did not with my THX certified 5.1 surround sound speaker setup. Built in volume controls and G keys are immensely useful. Wireless range is great, I can reach nearly anywhere in our 4000 square foot house.<br /><br />Will fit even the largest head, great measured and notched design make it easy for a friend to borrow, and adjust back to the way you like it. battery life really is about 8 to 10 hours.<br /><br />-Cons -<br />Joints can be a little creaky, though nothing major, no docking station, that would have been nice, can get a bit sweaty on warmer days. Standing next to the microwave while nuking my hot pockets seems to create some kind of annoying interference.<br /><br />Every once in a rare while the controls on the headset stop working, this is easily fix by powering the headset off and on again. As far as I can tell, it's use is limited to the PC, and is not usable with the Xbox360 or PS3.<br /><br />-Other thoughts -<br />There are a few trade offs, that are not really cons, for example; The unit is quite noise cancelling, to the point that at first it was a little odd using voice chat and skype without being able to hear my own voice, also makes it difficult to converse with people in the real world while wearing.<br /><br />I have never needed to raise the volume beyond 60 or 70%, however a friend of mine who has suffered some hearing loss do to his profession did run it up to 100% and mentioned that it could be a little louder. Build quality is above average but falls a little short of superb.<br /><br />Really should have a couple front facing LEDs I can turn on to help me find my way to the fridge at 2 am.<br /><br />-My uses -<br />Skype for voice chat while playing with friends, immersive gaming without wakingthe neighbors. Listening to music while making breakfast without bugging the roommates, phone calls with google voice, and using workout videos early in the morning without waking anyone, (tried with Les Mills body pump, have not yet tried with zumba, may well fly off head in that case...)<br /><br />-Final Verdict -<br />This headset has been one of the best buys I have made in a long time, it's versatility and quality well exceed it's price point.
1439181780|1.0|I loved the Secret, What The Bleep,  and I read all of the Abraham Hicks books and believe in the Law of Attraction and generally love this kind of book. So I couldn't wait to sit down with this one. But - to my disappointment, Rhonda Byrne is not a good writer. What made the original book and movie of the Secret so good was the other experts, who were articulate and inspiring.  This book unbelievably repetitive - basically  the same thing written over and over and over again. The overuse of exclamation points is totally annoying and unnecessary and the message could have all fit on one page. There are many other books that convey this much better.

B001H9JBW6|5.0|The Last Enemy has all the elements of get lost in it, get shaken, stimulated, inspired, humbled, outraged, overwhelmed and moved, drama.  I loved it on a trillion levels.  A hero's journey in the kinda soon future, which engages the intellect, heart and deep deep philosophical stuff down beneath, if you're lucky enough to still be able to go there.<br /><br />The characters are complex, mysterious, and ultimately so well developed that by the end I felt I knew them intimately and would miss them very much.  The Hero, Stephen Ezard initially seems difficult to warm up to, but I fell in love with him and found him (character and actor, indistinguishable for the most part) to be real enough yet still big enough to carry a kind of prototypical inadvertent seeker warrior role.  Who knew that guy could come to be swoon worthy?<br /><br />For me this was like watching a great, spare production of Shakespeare, or re-reading a Jane Austen fave when it really gets in.  I felt immediately when we first started watching, that this is a classic work, and at the end of many hours of transfixed yearning watching, I was like, wow, this is the real deal.  Totally cool piece of work.
B004EJUMT2|5.0|There is not much else to say about this band that hasn't already been said. Yes, they are polarizing and you are probably gonna love 'em or hate 'em. Sure they are a pleasant mix of Mercyful Fate, VoiVod, BOC, etc., etc., etc. The best thing about them, IMO, is that they have personality; something that has been missing from \\"metal\\" for a long, long time. And they are funny, which is a bonus. Thanks for making this old metal lady smile. That is all.
B007BRJYF2|1.0|Game worked fine for a short while, had no problems with down loading. The problem was the game froze up mid way through, was not able to go forward or backward in the game. Waste of money, enjoyed the story but not the game.
B0015DRPJU|5.0|I finished reading book two yesterday morning and took Shadow Kiss with me to work to start during my lunch hour.  Needless to say, I ended-up running a little over on my lunch because I could not put this book down.  After work, I picked it back up and finished it at 3:30am.  Crazy, right!!<br /><br />This book has so far been my favorite in the series. I'm not going to spend time summing up the plot since the other reviewers have done such a nice job, but this is a page turner with a ton of plot development.<br /><br />I really, really Loved this book and still have a little lump in my throat from the last several chapters.  I can't wait to see what happens in Blood Promise, which I started this morning!

Yes, there were a few grammatical errors, and yes, it isn't realistic, but it's a FANTASY!  How boring is a completely realistic love story?!  I would rather read about hot and steamy relationships any day of the week!
0739341243|5.0|Positivly the best non-fiction I have read in over ten years.  Great for introverts and extroverts alike if you really want to understand and value the differences and diversity.  Susan translates all the research with terrific story telling, using both humor and pain to make you feel the needs of those she writes about.  If you are an introvert, love one or are frustrated by one you must pick up this book.

0545123291|4.0|Linger, by Maggie Stiefvater, \\"is the story of a boy who used to be a wolf and a girl who was becoming one.\\" In this enticing second installment of The Wolves of Mercy Falls, the reader listens to the thoughts of Grace and Sam, two star-crossed lovers, and Cole, a new wolf. This multiple point-of-view type writing has become very popular of late.  Though many authors have tried and failed at maintaining a clear plot line with the different characters telling the story, Stiefvater does a magnificent job of keeping her reader interested and involved. Throughout this teen romance/mystery novel, Sam begins to think about his new life as a human while Grace fears that the wolf inside her is trying to break free. The young couple battles through everyday situations that many independent teenagers might face, such as how serious of a relationship they are allowed to have at only seventeen years old, and how tragedy can drive some people together and others apart. Stiefvater creates situations that the everyday teen can relate to, while maintaining the ambience of the magic involved in Grace and Sam's forbidden, even death defying, relationship. I give this book 4 out of 5 thumbs up because the story line and the character development is solid. The only reason it isn't 5 out 5 would be that the writing could be a tad more sophisticated. However, since this is a young adult and teen book, the writing is apropro. If you would like to see more reviews,  visit me on Youtube at [...]or my website: [...]or email me at ispylbutton@aim.com
0307987647|5.0|The Clash of Kings is most interesting, so much happened and keeps the reader holding your breath until the chapter and next book.  This a great book and I enjoy listening to it while doing housework, yardwork or while driving a long commute.

B002IC10Y8|5.0|As this is a collector's item, I was very pleased to received my box of music CDs in perfect condition.  It was carefully packaged, and sure enough, was still sealed in its original cellophane.  As promised, it was listed as used, but had never been opened!
0385738773|3.0|OK. For me, last books in a series usually either crash and burn, or rise and shine. This one was...in the middle. I've never had that happen before. I loved the first book, the second was good, but I kept waiting for answers. Now, I'm not saying I need all answers to every question brought up, but come on! The main character never got his memory back, and thus way too much was left unanswered. Okay, maybe he didn't need to get it back, but there were ways that info could have been given. Even though I liked the epilogue, I still feel like the ending was lacking. I especially had a hard time with the fact that this basically turned into a zombie takeover. And the Right Arm. I think we were supposed to be impressed by this organization, but I have to admit, this almost seems like it was an afterthought of the author or editor that was inserted after the fact.<br /><br />Though I am disappointed with not learning what I wanted to (maybe I expected too much), I have to admit I found myself turning the pages quickly. The storyline was good, and I did find it refreshing through the series that not everything always ends up perfect. People died. I guessed at what WICKED was really after in the end (from the main character), and was happy with that part of the story.<br /><br />So, mixed feelings? You could say so. Overall, I think the series is worth reading, if you don't mind a zombie book.
0345803485|2.0|I am just starting the second book, recommended by a friend who loved it, I am very dissapointed but I purchased all three of the volumes, don't bother!!  If anyon out there wants to read some really great Erotica, may I suggest Delta of Venus, by Anais Nin. Published in the 1930's it is a book of short storeis, one better than the next

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I think this series is amazing. It's entertaining and I love the ideas that it can put in your head
0385737955|4.0|Though the topic included children getting killed in horrific ways, I really enjoyed the book. The mystery from the beginning was intriguing. The only thing that really bothered me in this first book of the series was characters would be about to spill some information the reader is dying to know, then the author would cut them off, and just say \\"I'll tell you later.\\" A couple of times is fine. But it happened over and over again, until it was beyond annoying.<br />Other than that, great start to a series. If you enjoy a distopian-type science fiction book, then this would be a good one to pick up.
B007EDCWHA|5.0|This book was so good!! I even bought it on my Kindle Fire and the pictures were still there and had their own pages. This is a must buy for any true Directioner!! This book is adorable and heartwarming, especially if you love these five guys! I definitely recommend this to any fan of One Direction and I even think that people who aren't fans or aren't sure whether they are fans or not yet, should read this. This is written by them about their lives and I think that people who aren't fans should still read it too, and not just judge them. Get to know them by reading this amazing book. Everyone needs to get this!! &lt;3
B005LAIGZU|5.0|Such a great movie.  I can watch this over and over again because the plot and the action are top notch.  Yes, they aren't the greatest actors but then again you shouldn't expect them to be.  They bring a sense of believability to the movie, though, that most actors can't.

B004XKVPG6|1.0|Last week on 6/30 I purchased a \\"New\\" copy of this from a amazon merchant named EZfulfillment that fulfilled Prime Membership purchases. When the order went thru, the first thing I noticed on my screen was that the name of the merchant changed to Canada Inc. I thought perhaps I made a mistake. When the Blu-ray arrived 7/3, the return address was from Canada Inc. Lexington, KY. I took off the shrink wrap and immediately noticed there wasn't any security tape on the case. Also there was a bar code sticker on the outside of the shrink wrap with \\"Made In Canada\\" on it. I thought it was used and had been rewrapped. I've never purchased a brand new DVD, Blu-ray or CD that was missing the security tape. I sent amazon  and the merchant an email about the issue the evening it arrived. I had left feedback for the merchant only on the issue of rewrapping a used blu-ray and selling it for \\"New.\\" I noticed the name of the company I was leaving feedback for was EZfulfillment and not Canada Inc.<br /> After looking back on my order, I realized the merchant also sent me the wrong blu-ray (I order a lot of stuff from amazon including DVDs and Blu-rays, so the cover didn't register asap). I was shipped the 2009  release:The case with Pitt and Freeman on the cover. I had tried playing it and could not get a menu to pop up on any blu-ray player or on my son's sony play station. After a phone call with amazon the same night, I was told I would be refunded and they did so the next day.  The merchant returned my email, and they sent it under the name EZfulfillment but with the company signature of iNetVideo, not Canada Inc. So, I was glad to know for sure I had not made a mistake, but I was a bit bewildered why they would fill my order under a different company's name and also go by a third company name that sells here.<br /> I found out today from reading a recent review of the 2009 release, there are merchants selling a Canadian made release that isn't compatible with almost every Blu-ray player. He explains the specifics about it very well and has been stiffed twice.<br />In an email, EZfulfillment offered to give me half of my money back and let me keep it or a chance to use amazon's return policy. I told EZ not only did I get a used copy but the wrong one and the bla bla bla I stated above and EZ could have it back if they paid for shipping, no problem.<br /><br />I just reordered this again today 7/5, directly from amazon and hope I get the right copy of a 90's classic detective team/horror film.<br />Update:7/6 amazon passed my order off to ez and they passed it off to Canada inc. Amazon customer service rerouted my order and had it returned to them. I also had a knife sharpener with this order that was returned along with the Canadian Blu-ray. I paid the extra and ordered the knife sharpener from Williams--Sonoma.<br /><br />I'll see what some local stores have in stock and hopefully get the Blu-ray version of this.ay player.

B003TH2LA8|4.0|I completely understand why this show got its bad ratings. It is based EXTREMELY loosely off a fairly good fantasy book (currently reading the series right now) and it also has all the elements you would expect in a Raimi-made show. This was made by the guy who brought us Xena, Hercules, and even (my personal favorite until this show) Jack of All Trades. To the average or casual TV watcher, this show is going to look really cool in its lameness but also feel very empty.<br /><br />Essentially I am saying this:<br />If you want a laid back show that had a lot of really neat looking slow motion sword fights and women dressed in full-body leather then this is the perfect show for you. If you have read the books and are looking forward to seeing the show because you liked the books, just think of it this way: this in not Lord of the Rings, it goes very far off course from the books to the point where it is pretty much just the character's and place's names are the same.<br /><br />For those who came here wanting to watch the show because they liked the books but do not understand the Raimi style of TV then they should leave now. For those who read the books and are wondering how they turned it into a TV series but they have also watched and liked shows like Xena or Jack of All Trades, then this show is for you (as long as you don't take it personally that Kahlan reveals she is a Confessor in the first few minutes). For those of you who have never read the books yet are drawn to TV fantasy, you could either love this show or hate it. I suggest watching the first episode and then if you didn't like it, just leave, it doesn't get better. If you did like it, odds are to you the show will feel like it gets very very good as the episodes progress.<br /><br />The show as a total (the 2 seasons it lasted) was great in my opinion. Of course when I first watched it as it was aired on TV I had not yet read the books. As I am watching it again while reading the books, I am still really enjoying the show a second time. Odds are though I will not watch the last couple episodes of season 2, as that is were the show just went down the drain. If it ended better, I would have given the show 5 stars, but because of the poor ending, I have given it 4.<br /><br />To sum it up, this show is great, yet it is also horrible. It all really depends why you want to watch it and what you are expecting. I hope this explains the mixed feelings this show got in the reviews.
B003Y5H5B0|5.0|I absolutely love this film. I have seen it seven times, five in the theatre and twice at home, and honestly, I haven't seen a better film this year. I enjoyed The Avengers, really liked Magic Mike, and I'm sure Ted will be a lot of fun, but 21 Jumpstreet is the best. Maybe it's me, but every single line in this movie cracks me up. The commentary is a heckuva lot of fun, too. ;)
0374275637|5.0|I finished this book about 3 weeks ago... and now I will start reading it again, this time with a notepad and highlighter in hand.<br /><br />The book has 5 distinct parts, each one building on the previous concepts.  The author has clearly struck a novel vein, and it's just starting to be mined. It seems to me that Dr. Kahneman has left this book as his legacy, as a pointer to others to continue what is clearly a rich area of research, with many practical applications.<br /><br />Take your time reading this book.  To use the author's lingo, it's a \\"system 2\\" book, one that will engage your \\"rational\\" mind, so read it slowly. It's worth your time.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|I will admit that I saw this film because of all the fuss about George Clooney's performance in it.  Clooney has made quite a few good films in the last several years and I am glad to see that he is not loosing his stream.  His performance is wonderful, but movie itself falls a little short.<br /><br />It is a story about the man who is native Hawaiian and lives somewhat modest life compared to the wealth he inherited.  He is a lawyer, specializing in real estate in charge of the land trust that his family owns.  On the surface is life is perfect: he has nice law practice, wife and two daughters.  One day tragedy hits home and his wife ends up in a coma.  It is during her hospitalization that he discovers she had a well kept secret from him that changes his entire outlook on life, marriage and family.<br /><br />Like any encounter with death, family members need closure with the person that is dying.  This family goes through that process with close family members, friends and grief councelors. No matter how difficult the truth is for this man who is loosign his wife of nearly 20 years, he pulls through it and carries on with whatever is left.  It is the story of endurance, during most difficult times and story of a family capable of finding their peace once the trauma of loosing one of their own is over.

B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|\\"Lost In The Echo\\", \\"In My Remains\\", and \\"Lies Greed Misery\\" seem to be the only songs I really enjoy off this album.  I've tried to listen to it more.  While this is a much more listenable effort than the horrendous A Thousand Suns, I still just can't get into their state of becoming more electronic on the majority of the songs on this album.  I liked their share of electronic elements that were fused into the heaviness and catchiness of Hybrid Theory and Meteora.  Minutes To Midnight was quite good for even straying out of the nu-metal greatness of their first two efforts.  Since their last album they have been less rock and less metal and more electronic than anything.  I like when bands expand on their sound and experiment on albums.  It can be a breath of fresh air, unlike some bands such as the overrated re-hashed material of Nickelback.  But I can't help but feel that this album is missing the greatest of what made me enjoy their first three albums.  Some of these songs feel like leftovers from A Thousand Suns.  The first single \\"Burn It Down\\" was a disappointment to me right from the start and I wasn't very enthused about the album.  It feels more like attempt at Top 40 and a leftover from A Thousand Sons.  Whatever happened to Linkin Park releasing first singles that would be catchy hard rockers?  \\"I'll Be Gone\\" seems like a slower version of the first 3 songs on the album so it doesn't interest me too much.  I also find the last half of the album to be the downfall with the majority of the songs being very mediocre.  \\"Skin To Bone\\" is a song that just bores me with it's repetitive electronic loops.  \\"Roads Untraveled\\" is a complete snoozer and sounds like an attempt to reach the glory of their previous hit ballad \\"Shadow of the Day\\" but fails.  \\"Tinfoil\\" and \\"Victimized\\" are also complete filler.<br />Well, this may actually be a tiny step in the right direction and even though it is better than the last way-out-there album they released it still doesn't capture the start-to-finish greatness of Hybrid Theory and Meteora.
0307592731|2.0|I really wanted to love this book. Going through a difficult time in my own life, and having made some poor choices, and enjoying hiking and the outdoors, I thought I'd be inspired by a story about someone who'd overcome a tough life, and faced grief/crisis, and was healed through an epic journey. Instead, it sounded like the author was trying to shock readers by writing things that didn't contribute to the story or characters, but would make some people say \\"wow, she's so brutally honest!\\"<br /><br />Did we really need to read about the author wringing out and re-inserting her sponge-tampon on the trail? Ick. The references to her dying mother's male nurse's penis was unhinged. Eating a handful of her mother's ashes? I wanted to say \\"come on lady; you're mother died; you didn't get stranded with an Uruguayan rugby team after a plane crash in the Andes!\\" Seems to me that some things that happen to us in life, and some things we do, need to remain private - even if we decide to write our \\"brutally honest\\" memoirs for a living.<br /><br />I'm no prude, but the drug use and promiscuity was over the top. A twelve-pack of condoms? How optimistic! There was so much focus and energy spent making sure she didn't have sex with anyone without a condom, but virtually none on the dangers of heroine and other drug-use?  From the halfway point in the book, every time she introduced new male characters, I was so distracted with which one(s) she'd be trying to get to service her, I could't pay any attention to any other aspect of the characters. She seemed less like a woman hiking the PCT to heal, and to find herself, and more like a woman serving a life sentence in an all-female prison. She says \\"I'd been on the trail 6 weeks and hadn't even masturbated yet.\\"  By the time she got to the hippie-convention, I was thinking that had been another bad decision on her part.<br /><br />I changed my named to Strayed, cause that's what I did in my first marriage?<br /><br />I simply lost all respect for the author while reading the book. She obviously went on to become a successful person with a stable family.  Maybe at least a few comments at the end about remorse, lessons learned, healing, mistakes leading to improved character, revelations? Nothing.  It comes across as bragging about and flaunting a lack of character, as opposed to putting it into any perspective, or having it evolve. Maybe if the trail was another 1,000 miles, the author and the book would have found themselves.<br /><br />It struck me like A Million Little Pieces. I doubt many of the details are true. She writes about spending every free, waking moment READING classic novels and trail-guides in her tent every night, but barely a mention of any time WRITING in a journal.  In light of that, would there be any way to get these vivid memoirs after 20 years?

1594744769|5.0|The reason for this purchase was that my 8th grade son was to read this book for his summer project.  Before he was able to begin, I was curious after reading the prologue as well as looking at the many pictures within the book.<br /><br />I completely enjoyed this adventure, was captivated by the pictures and noted the many literary elements throughout the book.  I was looking forward to my son reading it so he could see how the main character develops into a confident and brave teenager.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this book for reading by young teens due to the many lessons to be learned as well as by young adults because this writing contains many interesting literary elements.<br /><br />This is a thoroughly entertaining reading on many levels-you will not be able to put it down!  I would suggest this book for any reader that enjoys:  adventure, fiction vs nonfiction, coming-of-age, friendship, family or mystery.  I would purchase this book even if it wasn't a school required reading.

B003YOEXUM|4.0|About time I found some rock/metal worth listening to.  Past few years, been nothing but retreads from the old folks (KISS) or musical let-downs from once 1970 big-names like Nazareth and Van Halen (Tattoo....really, someone outta Tattoo them to retirement).  Accept----raw, loud, great riffs.  REALLY LIKE THIS BAND (w/there new singer)!  Never heard of Accept before this album/CD (so I went back and listened to Accept w/orginal singer....forget him).  There's 5 KILLER tracks on this album (that's counting Time Machine); the only semi-dud is Kill the Pain.  Otherwise.......great album<br />NOTE:  An their newest album....STALINGRAD....is a must listen also

B006LSZECO|3.0|I was really invested in the story and the characters. A large portion of the novel is captivating and a must-read, but sadly, the end is extremely disappointing. It just ends. No real resolution to the plot and the characters. After investing time and energy into realizing who these characters are the end of the novel truly disappoints. Flynn just leaves the novel hanging at the end of a cliff. It was a very unsatisfying conclusion to a well written, engaging mystery novel.

B0060AY85C|4.0|\\"Home\\" was a surprise for me because it is so fundamentally different from most of Morrison's previous works.  However the simplicity and beauty of this shockingly brief novel is refreshing.  It reads much like a short story in a sense, without the density and complexity of say \\"Beloved\\" or \\"Jazz\\".  I finished this book in a few hours, however it left me with a feeling of satisfaction and warmth.  Its story is one that may resonate with many Americans, particularly those with Southern roots or those who have experienced the aftermath of war veterans or heroes attempting to make an adjustment coming home from Korea or similarly any previous war.  I love the intimacy and grittiness of the characters as they are introduced to the reader.  We find out in a few passages why Cee feels so vulnerable and is an easy target for a doctor who has few ethics and whose scientific experiments take precedence over the well-being of real human beings.  Cee was scarred emotionally as a child, having been raised by an emotionally-scarred grandmother.  Her hero is her brother Frank, from whom she has to learn how to reach her own inner strength so that she might eventually embrace her own life and worth.  Again, I love this book as it touches my heart and inspires me to re-create images from my own family history,  even though on a literary level, critics will most likely not give this work the stature of many of Toni Morrison's previous ones.  Bravo to Toni for a real, heart-warming story.
006197806X|4.0|The bottom line in this book is: survive. Whether it's \\"Now,\\" 6 months after Lena's escape, or \\"Then,\\" within days of it, the only thing that matters is to survive. Lena was having trouble doing so in the Wilds because it's hard to survive when you're still so dependent on the Insiders. In \\"Then,\\" Lena is helping the resistance and her survival isn't as jeopardized... that is, until she's kidnapped with the son of the leader of the Deliria Free America (DRA). And then survival is once again her main concern.<br /><br />I loved how this was told in \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\". The tough thing about it was how each chapter seemed to end in a cliffhanger! And then I'd turn the page expecting to see what happens next, but it'd jump to the other time frame, and I'd have to get to the next chapter for relief from the cliffhanger. It was like this almost constantly, but I loved it. It made me want to keep reading and reading until I'd read it all.<br /><br />I have to say, I'm still in love with Alex. Throughout this book, I refused to believe he was dead, even though Lena was convinced that he was. Every time she mentioned him (which was rare) or thought of him, my heart hurt for her. And now I don't know what to think. So much happened in this book and I don't know what to think or feel anymore. I'm sure Lena feels the same way. But you'll have to read to find out exactly why.<br /><br />There were so many new characters in this book, which is to be expected since Lena knows no one when she runs away to the Wilds. Raven was a great character, but I kept forgetting she was so young because she had so much responsibility and acted much older. For some reason, I really liked Hunter even though he was hardly a big character. And I have mixed feelings about Julian... I can't figure out how I feel about him.<br /><br />Pandemonium is a fantastic sequel! I didn't expect what I found in the pages, but it was a beautifully written, intense story that I didn't want to put down. I can't wait to see how this series ends in book 3, Requiem.to see how this series ends in book 3, Requiem.

B002VPE1WK|1.0|Thought that I would use this backpack for a two week trip that involved several flights - not a good idea on my part.    On the last leg of the journey home the lens filter and cap got busted due to the lack of padding and bouncing around in the overhead bin, the lens (a 70-200) was okay but I lost the filter and cap, luckily my 5DII and 24-105 survived the trip unharmed.    I'm ditching this bag and going back to my Crumpler http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001TINMT8/ref=wms_ohs_product full time now.    It's not worth dealing with poorly designed products when you have several thousand dollars worth of gear, just get something good like a lowepro or a thinktank to help protect your investment.
B007Y1JGOY|3.0|I love Lucidity and April Rain to death, but Delain's third album is not doing much for me. There is a distinct lack of strings and symphony that makes the songs all blend together and sound like a heavier version of Paramore. There are a few standouts such as \\"Mother Machine,\\" \\"We Are the Others,\\" \\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot,\\" \\"Babylon,\\" \\"Are You Done With Me\\", but this is their first album where I had to skip a few songs rather than put the whole thing on a loop. The single \\"Get the Devil Out of Me\\" sounded much better at the demo stage before they changed the chorus. Charlotte's vocals are as strong as ever, but she's being backed by some uninspired riffs and melodies this time around. \\"Where is the Blood\\" sounds like it drew some major inspiration from Within Temptation's \\"What Have You Done,\\" and this is not a very good sign as the latter band has now mainstreamed their music and sound. Delain needs to introduce the orchestra back into their music to break up the monotony. The absence of Marco Hietala's guest vocals makes you realize what a difference his touch makes on the songs. If they don't return to their roots, Delain will just end up being another female-fronted rock band that is indistinguishable from the rest.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|The writing is so breathtakingly juvenile, I deleted the trilogy from my iPad before I was done reading the first book.

0525423656|3.0|Matched had a fascinating premise, and I loved the book. However, Crossed was definitely not up to par. My main criticism is that the book was too slow. I got bored several times and put the book down and wandered off to do something else. It dragged, it stumbled, it sputtered and crawled. Eventually, things picked up slightly at the end, and left me vaguely curious enough to decide to read the third one when it came out. Not much happened in this book-- you could skip it, I'm sure, and be almost completely fine reading and understand the third book.<br /><br />What I did like about this book was the introduction of new characters with interesting personalities-- one of whom seems more promising than the main characters Cassia and Ky. I also liked the subtle secrets introduced into the story as I read. That was probably what kept me reading. I wanted to know about the little secret details Condie had added.<br /><br />Other than that, the writing does improve somewhat between novels and the setting is refreshing, compared to the previous book. There is some character development with Ky-- I learned a lot more about him and he became slightly more complex, but Cassia seemed to remain her naive, gentle, innocent self.<br /><br />All in all, I'd suggest reading it, but I would tell you to get it from the library. I like collecting books and putting them on my shelf, so that's why I bought this one, but if you aren't into that, don't spend the money.
B00846REIS|4.0|If you appreciated the premise of the 50 shades series but are looking for an adult version written in adult English about adult characters, Bared to You is the answer.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am not a reader of erotica or BDSM books, in fact I will say I was kind of a prude about them.  I had 5 friends recommend the 50 Shades series as good reads so I downloaded them to my kindle without reading the reviews, or the plot synopsis. I figured my friends know me very well so if they think I'll like the books I'll trust their reccomendations. Once I realized what I was reading I was shocked, but then I couldn't put them down and found myself drawn into Christian and Ana's story big time.  I ended up reading the whole series in two days!  It's hard to be angry at my friends for not warnning me about the theme of the books when I ended up getting lost in the story and enjoying it.  One friend said, \\"it's easier to ask forgiveness.\\" It's easy to give forgiveness when the innocent deception leads you to something that you never would have picked up on your own.<br /><br />I do agree with some of the reviews about how often themes repeat and the same descriptions are used, but if you get byeond that, the plot and the story itself is just awesome. I would highly reccomend this series to anyone looking for an easy read that draws you in.

I found it at Fry's the day it came out on DVD.  As soon as I got home I tried to cancel my Amazon order, but for 6 hours I got a message that Amazon was not available.  Later, I was told that it was in the process of shipping.<br /><br />Long story short, every set I bought was defective.  Despite a few hundred other disks playing perfectly on my Sony VDX RDR-525 for years and several others since, including ALL episodes of this set but #6, the end of episode 6 continues to be screwed-up even on the second replacement.  BTW, both the original I got from Frys and their replacement had the same problem.<br /><br />Five copies bad in the same place from two sources, when many other disks play perfectly?  Sounds to me like a bad burn.  So first thing to do if you get this set is to try Disk 2 Episode 6 from about 35 minutes until the end and see if it hangs/skips or otherwise fails to play smoothly on every device you might play it on, and return it if it won't.<br /><br />I'm now on the third copy from Amazon.  I returned both earlier copies the same day about 15 June using their printed labels [now 6 July] and they've credited me for the return of one copy on 3 July, but not the other, so their returns process sucks.<br /><br />DO NOT buy this product from Amazon.  Get it locally.  Test it for playback on Episode 6 in the last 10 minutes, and exchange it locally, because Amazon will definitely screw over you on a return forever.<br /><br />  Show, 10, Amazon Zero.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|On my 3rd copy of this CD to send to friends and fellow Joe Walsh fans.  I can't get this album out my head.  EVERY song is great.  Twinges of \\"old Joe\\" both lyrically and guitar-wise plus a couple of heartfelt ballads.  Especially like what \\"Family\\" lyrics have to say.  May soon be the \\"music-bed\\" for  amateur family videos of the future.  \\"Band Played On\\" is a rockin little ditty.  You may catch yourself trying to hit the high notes on the chorus to \\"Spanish Dancer\\" (not pretty when I do!) I could go on and on...but I won't.  Buy it, listen to a couple times and love it!

055338466X|3.0|Stephen Hawking's attempt to answer the great questions about life, the universe and everything. It is co written with someone with a name I can neither pronounce nor spell, but apologies to Leonard Ml-whatever-your-name-is, for not taking the time to copy and paste it.<br /><br />Plusses are that this book is a wonderful short history of the growth of scientific thought as well as a crash course in quantum mechanics, relativity and M theory.<br /><br />However, there was nothing actually new here - although it brings a lot of material into one nicely accessible place. A fuller discussion of the scientific theories can be found in books such as Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe (he has a later book that probably covers any recent changes Hawking includes).<br /><br />As for the history of the development of science, that can be found in many places, but at times it was reminiscent of Russell's History of Western Philosophy.<br /><br />On the downside, this book does not do what it purports to do. It asks the question \\"why is there something rather than nothing\\", but cannot answer it, and the attempt to reduce it to a non question is just a fudge that admits to the unanswerability of the question.<br /><br />Early on the book also simply dismisses philosophy, saying it has not kept up with the science. That statement is a bold assertion written in defiance of the clear fact that modern philosophers are well aware of the latest physics, and make good use of it. Indeed, inasmuch as this book IS a work of philosophy, the book refutes its own assertion.<br /><br />In a few other places, things are asserted without evidence and which are not obviously true.<br /><br />The proposal of the unmodified radical multiverse idea as a solution to the extremely unlikely balance of the laws of nature that allow our universe to exist is also written in ignorance of the work of philosophers such as Keith Ward, who make the point that this merely multiplies the improbability of thewhole. There is now so much more *stuff* to explain than before. We have mechanism but no answer to the reason there is something at all.<br /><br />So no answers to the big questions in this book. I liked the physics, which is nicely described, but other books do that more thoroughly.
B004WCTLNY|3.0|`The Adjustment Bureau' is one of those movies that works so long as you don't try and take it too seriously.  Once you start to break apart the film's elements, it becomes a bizarrely campy mess and it starts to lean on the `stupid' side of things.  The performances by Damon and Blunt are great and they go a long way to making this premise work, but unlike most film adaptations of Philip K. Dick's work, `The Adjustment Bureau' feels kind of corny.<br /><br />The Bureau itself is an obvious figurative peak at God and his angels poking around at the fate or `free will' of us humans.  The way they are depicted is rather shallow and almost laughable (their introduction on the rooftop made me laugh) and the film really fails to flesh them out, despite trying to (especially with the Harry character).  The film plods along rather well and then dives into lunacy when the final ten minutes roll around and director George Nolfi slams his foot on the gas pedal and the film steamrolls to its finale.  The `Monster's Inc.' type door escapes can be pretty cool (and the special effects are top notch) but they also get rather redundant.  The love story is underdeveloped (love at first site isn't always the most logical plot point) and overall this film winds up being a missed opportunity.  Add to the mix the ridiculous `hat' idea and you have a film that flirts with a depth it isn't willing to embrace.  Instead, it meanders at a decently entertaining action thriller with a charismatic lead performance.

034580404X|4.0|I have enjoyed these books so much. I only gave a 4 out of 5 because, well, the sexual content is a bit much & gets boring after a while. I have read so many mixed reviews, but you have to remember that not every book is for everyone. I am amazed at who has been reading the books, out of my friends, they are also loving the book. If you don't like a lot of sexual content, this book is not for you, but if you want a good book that is hard to put down then I would suggest this book. I don't get those who say there is no story line because I feel there is one, while else would it be hard to put the book down. I am on the third book & have been very pleased. She could have kept the monotonous sex out though. Great Read!!!
B000002H92|5.0|Track #1 makes this a superb collection of live Doors work. Most live albums don't include ambient, before/after concert crowd audio. The ~2 minute admonition from the promoter & crowd sounds and responses are priceless. It totally makes you feel like you are actually at the event being taped. It reminds me of an article I read about a renown \\"taper\\" from the '70's that would include many minutes of pre-show crowd audio of Led Zeppelin tour concerts. \\"Robert, you have great hair!!!!\\", \\"Pass me some grass!\\", and other random/candid statements from the concert-goers from 40 years ago makes for an awesome time-capsule of audio.<br /><br />Plus, Jim's voice is spot-on in all of these tracks. Not to mention, the guitar, drums, and keyboard are at top form. And I really love it during one of the songs on disc #2 where Jim tells the audience to \\"shut up!\\"
B005LAII08|4.0|Well,... Walt Disney and Pixar sure were \\"brave\\" in bringing out this video whit Madagascar 3, and Ice Age 4, also playing.<br /><br />In short, imo, Brave doesn't come close to either Madagascar 3, or Ice Age 4.<br />Madagascar 3 and Ice Age 4, were both (almost) \\"continuos laughs from start to end\\", for me.<br />Not so with Brave. Brave was more, like \\"a few luaghs here and there\\".<br />It's a nice story, mother-daughter fairy tale, mistic, excelent animations (as we expect from Pixar),.. and that's it.<br /><br />I'd think mother and daugthers will like and appreciate this movie, even without the laughs.<br />But I suspect most Dad's and sons, will go, \\"mwa,... it's \\"ok\\"\\"...<br /><br />By the way, I found there were a few pretty scary scenes,.. kids 6 and older can probably handle it,...<br />5 and younger I think maybe not so much,...  but it's only a few scenes.<br /><br />I was thinking more three stars, but hey,... mother and daughter liked it.<br />Especially older daughter, and she's considerable older than 10 (!),... so that must count for an additional star, bringing it to 4 star for me.

B002S0OBMS|5.0|I admit it:  I've had a bootlegged copy of this music for quite some time, which was given to me by a friend, although I took my time in listening to it.  But once I did, I found I couldn't STOP playing it!  To be frank with you, I was never 100% happy with Lloyd Webber's \\"Phantom,\\" liking and loving pieces of it more than the whole.  But my feelings about that show were changed by the phenomenal 25th anniversary performance from Royal Albert Hall with the wonderful Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess.  So, knowing that they starred in this recording, I found myself paying closer attention to it, and it quickly became an obsession with me.  So I decided to break down and buy this double CD package.  The show \\"Love Never Dies\\" has been ripped apart by some and ridiculed as not worthy to be a sequel to \\"Phantom,\\" but I completely disagree with such disparagement.  And it's also been called a one-song show, which is so very wrong.  Yes, the title song is phenomenal, and to those who bitch about the melody being taken nearly intact from \\"Our Kind of Love\\" from the composer's \\"The Beautiful Game,\\" so a composer can't re-imagine a melody?  Just one example:  Beethoven, who lifted the finale for his \\"Eroica\\" symphony directly from his only ballet.  So there has been an abundance of precedence when it comes to THAT!  But back to the show, which has so many other wonderful songs, like \\"Beneath A Moonless Sky,\\" \\"Once Upon Another Time,\\" \\"Look With Your Heart,\\" and the wonderful and thoroughly haunting finale -- and lots more.  And Karimloo and Boggess and the rest of the expert cast are fantastic!  I strongly recommend this recording to fans of musical theatre, and to the legion of Lloyd Webber and \\"Phantom\\" fans, there should probably be no need to preach to THAT congregation!  I'm stunned that Lloyd Webber is still giving us such wonderful music after such a long career.  One tiny quibble:  Why have they stopped giving us a synopsis of the story in liner note booklets?  There's not one word here, just as there wasn't one word in the original cast recording of Lloyd Webber's \\"The Woman In White.\\"  They do their fans a disservice by not including a few paragraphs telling them how each song is integrated into the story. That aside, I adore this show and this recording, and I've been -- very selectively! -- buying original cast recordings for decades!'s not one word here, just as there wasn't one word in the original cast recording of Lloyd Webber's \\"The Woman In White.\\"  They do their fans a disservice by not including a few paragraphs telling them how each song is integrated into the story.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is really fun and super duper cute! I highly recommend it to those who love or don't love ice age!
B002N5N5M0|3.0|The fact of the matter is that if you are looking at this product you already like Dexter and have probably already seen this season.  If I had to review the content, I would place this was the second best season with Season 5 being my personal favorite.  If you like Dexter, but have not yet seen this season, I can say you will like this season.  As usual John Lithgow does whatever it is that he does that makes everything automatically better.<br /><br />That said, I still rated this a 3 because the the product itself, the discs (in my case the bluray set), contains the unacceptable practice of forcing you to watch an EXTENDED commercial when you start playback of a disc and this commercial  cannot be skipped or fast-forwarded.  This commercial consists of every piece of programming on Showtime!  I did not buy this box set so that I could watch a commercial: and I certainly didn't buy Dexter Season 4 so that I could sit through an extended commercial consisting of segments for the product I have just bought.  If you could skip over it that would make it tolerable, but for the next, FF, and menu button to be disabled is thoroughly unacceptable to the point I wished to see the disc's authors meeting Dexter while held down with saranwrap.<br /><br />If you are considering getting this series on disc for your permanent library I would recommend waiting until after the series wraps up to see if a complete series box set would correct this issue.  If you are buying it because you want to see the episodes I would recommend renting them instead.  Just put the disc in and go to the bathroom, cook a snack, or mow your lawn while the commercial plays.<br /><br />5 stars for Dexter: 0 stars for the discs' authoring.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is one of the funnest games ever once u play it u r hooked on it on my moms ipod my hi score is n the millions. This game will not rip u off at all! It is so much fun when I first  got my kindle i looked to c if it wuz on here.
B002WCLG48|4.0|I really enjoyed all the anime styles and the different ways of portraying the stories from the Halo Universe. I am a big fan and thought this was really well done. The behind the scenes and making of the episodes was also pretty cool as well. For the price I think it was a great buy.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was an amazing read! Totally loved it! Did not disappoint at all. If your a romantic at heart and love reading some fun romance books, this one is for you. I've read the whole trilogy and each one is better than the other. I would highly recommend this book to anyone that wants to enjoy a good book. The minute you start it, you won't want to put it down. I finished this book in 2 days with a 4 month old :)
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I actually like it so do my little brothers especially the game with the fish and the game with the soccer ball I recommend this for ages 7 and up even my father likes it

B007J4T2G8|5.0|Had to see what the hype was all about, and glad that I did. I Couldn't put it down! Instantly downloaded the next book, Fifty Shades Darker.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|What a great book to read during the leisurely summer months! Cheryl's incredible hiking experience kept the reader fully engaged, whether it was because of obstacles on the trail, or emotions her trek brought to the surface. Even days after completing her book, I find myself wondering how she is doing \\"on the trail.\\"  That's a sign of a great read!
0345803485|5.0|This series of books are by far the best books I have ever read.  The best ever love story.  It is very sexually descriptive (done very tastefully and respectfully) which you never get in any other romance novel.  There is lots of passion and suspense which kept me on the edge of my seat. The author is superb, delving deeply into the female character, Anastasia.  She includes all of Anastasia's thoughts from her self-conscience and her inner Goddess.  I laughed, I cried, and I could not put the books down.  I am on my second time around because I didn't want them to end.
B0086700CM|5.0|get it! its awesome great and fun I think it good for ages 5+. If you get it your lucky. Also... no advertisements!

B0088LU3P0|5.0|It's nice to know that I \\"own\\" the Mad Men episodes purchased via Amazon.  I mean who wants Dan and Peggy and Joan and Pete and Roger interrupted by commercials that come with the television viewing?  Viewing them the \\"Amazon way\\" means you can have the MM characters all to yourself -- anytime.  Of course it helps if, like me, you're mad about Mad Men -- the best show on television.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|love playing this game with my son. we trade off doing levels :) it would be better if you had the option to buy revive with game money as well as real money.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is one of the best biographies I've ever read. Along with books like Unbroken and Devil At My Heels about Louie Zamperini and Saved By Her Enemy about an Iraqi women, Fearless is an incredible narrative about an incredible individual. It was hard for me to put down once I started reading. Sam Bowman, Tuscaloosa, AL
B006LSZECO|5.0|It's been years since I found a book that enthralled me so much that time stopped.  I downloaded Gone Girl yesterday at lunchtime and didn't stop reading for 12 hours until the last page. This is a true page turner with twists I never ever saw coming.  Stop reading reviews and go get this book right now.
B0079K4WEE|5.0|Item arrived quickly and undamaged.  The story was fairly interesting.  Either way Eva Green is beautiful in it so who really cares about the story.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|I'm so glad Bloomberg has finally brought out an app for the Fire that is not crippled.  This actually compares favorably to the iPod Touch version I've loved for so long. Also, it is now possible to input stock positions with partial shares, like 100.775, for instance. And none too soon. Now we can use Bloomberg on the Fire and enjoy the process. My .02 cents.
B00785P2QC|5.0|This app is the best virtual city type game I have encountered in a while. I say this to all, play your cards right.
0802473156|5.0|Wow, honestly! Thank God for the great work Dr. Chapman is doing. I believe this book is not only a thought-provoking read for married couples but it might also interest anyone who has marriage in his or her future plan. Indeed, this book truly hold the secret to love that lasts. Writing in an understandable way, Dr. Chapman uses real informations and real cases to explain his theory. What's good about this is that it's short, but packed with plenty of life-changing information. It more than deserves being on the best-seller's list and I am definitely keeping a copy of it because I believe it is - and will continue to be, really helpful.<br /><br />My advice : Don't wait, the sooner you know these things, the better!
B002EWD0I6|5.0|Just like I was swept away by the ladies of Cranford, the BBC series Lark Rise to Candleford has me completely distracted. It is a wonderfully done series which means even though I've almost finished watching the first season, there are even more seasons to follow.<br /><br />Lark Rise to Candleford takes place at the end of the 19th century, and it follows the stories of two very different communities ~ the small little town of Lark Rise and the bustling town of Candleford.  The series focuses on Laura, a girl who leaves her small town to work with the post mistress there.<br /><br />I am LOVING the humor, costumes, acting...very well done on so many different levels and one that I'm happy to have as a part of my period drama collection ~ and one that I'm glad to have nearby while I'm sitting and `resting'. :)
B007JF87VS|5.0|I bought the show since I was not at home and could not get to my tv to watch the series so it was totally worth spending a few bucks to watch it!
B005LAII0S|5.0|We have a hard time finding movies that all of our kids enjoy watching together. We picked this up for family movie night last week and it was one that our entire family {parents included} were able to enjoy together. There is enough adult humor, action, and comedy to make it a great {and clean family movie}. Loved it and am glad we made the purchase!
B004DM1ZQY|5.0|great backgammon game. it is nice for the developer to offer a 'free' version (with ads) to try before buying. I played a few dozen games and really enjoyed it, so I think paying a dollar is worth it!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is very very fun to pass time except for the energy thing that takes way to long to regenerate
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great puzzel game. You can choose how many pieces to cut thebouzzle into so when your waiting flor an appointment you can choose an easier level, and when you have more time you can choose a more difficult cut.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Step 1:  Watch the Fan Made Trailer - Fan Trailer - TheJohnCarterFiles.com<br /><br />Step 2: See the Movie with Friends and/or Family via DVD. (I love Amazon.com)<br /><br />Step 3: Go to website: backtobarsoom.com and sign the petition.<br /><br />Hopefully, we will make it back to buy the sequel someday.

B004TMPJP6|4.0|This app does all that I need. Easy to use. I really really need to set tasks to repeat. Please add this feature.
B004FGMDOQ|1.0|So far this has been a pretty good book. But there are asterisks in this book which, I assume, are supposed to lead you to footnotes. But those are not available AT ALL on Kindle Touch. (They may be on other Kindles) I have no idea what I've been missing, since I haven't gotten the hard copy yet. But if you have a Touch,  this probably isn't the right ebook for you.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|l This app is one of my favorite.  It is user friendly.  It works fine on my Kindle Fire and Droid X.
0307341577|4.0|It's great to read a book knowing you are not expected or obligated to \\"like\\" the protagonist. She says right out, \\"I'm mean!\\" So...on to the mystery.<br /><br />Libby Day's family has been murdered. She heard the killer, escaped, and testified against her own brother. But years later, she's confronted by people who think her brother's innocent. Could it have been someone else? Libby investigates.<br /><br />She does her best to do the research, interview the witnesses, and come to conclusions. She even goes to visit her brother in prison. I find this book creative, and off the usual track. I'm enjoying the premise and the fact that our \\"heroine\\" is not the usual sort of heroine.
034580404X|5.0|I am still reading the first book, I am a slow reader but so far I love it.  I would definately recommend it, my husband loves it when I read this book in bed at night ;)
B007IXWKUK|1.0|After reading all three books of Fifty Shades I found the book to poorly written and terribly boring with such<br />repetative verbage.<br />I would never recommend this book to anyone.
B00011CZRE|3.0|It's extremely hard these days to make a truly original, engaging film about a fictitious serial killer, and \\"Seven\\" illustrates that point only too well. The idea of a killer using the Seven Deadly Sins as his M.O. has much potential, but the directors and producers could have been far more creative regarding who is murdered, how/why it's carried out, and so forth. All the blatant gore only serves to substitute for real intrigue; e.g., I wanted to know a bit more about Victor, the \\"Sloth\\" victim, but the revelations of this character and his relationship with the killer stop just as they begin to get really interesting. Freeman, as usual, plays his part very well: It's not his fault that the directors and writers made his character a rather contrived veteran cop who defies all the stereotypes. Pitt, as the mercurial but able young cop-on-the-edge, is just plain annoying. Spacey is good as the killer: He's not exactly what I expected--but then again, what exactly DID I expect?
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The writing is very amateurish.  The content is a long saga of sexual encounters followed by short periods of reflection and anticipation of the nest sexual episode.  The book is very good for those wanting titillation because there is plenty of it for those open to it.  However I think the book is a cheap exploitation of sexual themes.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is a great game if you like simple card games like these, and its a good time killer when you need something to do for a little bit.
B0002VJY18|5.0|amazing A.K. has the talent!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. Absolutely love this cd and all her beautiful Music. would her cd's any day. Music that make you heart happy!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I was looking for an app to write on my photos. I use a kindle fire and this works fantastic.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is by far the worse book I have ever read. It is poorly written, unrealistic and just plain boring. I am mostly upset at myself for buying the trilogy.  What a complete waste of money. If, while reading a sex scene you put down your book because you are falling asleep, that speaks volumes.  Really girls... don't waste your money.  Now.. if it comes out in a movie and Ryan Gosling is the main character, I'm all over it... Let's face it, a movie is less time, less money and if you don't like it you can walk out (taking your popcorn with you)and it only wasted two hours of your day.
B003Y5H5BA|5.0|Jonah Hill makes me laugh everytime and he did not disappoint in 21 Jump Street.  I loved that there were so many extras on the Blue-ray disc.  I dont have the time or energy to go over what the whole movie was about but it was really FUNNY!  See it!  :)
B00328G4Y8|5.0|This is one of hendrix's most versitile albums. It has a combination of not only rock but a twist of jazz and funk as well. Ringo starr was a good drummer in his glory days, but in my opinion he ain't had nothing on mitch mitchell, just listen to that drum solo on\\" if 6 was 9,\\" and also check out the mellowness on\\" up from the skies\\" it's a nice jazzy beat to it. And then he matches up again with hendrix again on that funky cut \\" you got me floating\\" and also give you a funky beat on the begining of \\" little miss lover\\". Don't get me wrong, hendrix does some hellified guitar work on \\"little wing\\" and \\"axis bold as love,\\" but if you was to hear the whole album you would think this was mitch's album just as much as it's jimi's album. The two other songs that are over looked is \\"ain't no telling\\" and \\"she's so fine\\" written by bassist noel redding which also consist of good guitar and drum collaboration. In fact the whole album is awesome, hendrix already established himself as one of the world's greatest guitarist, It's mitch mitchell that needed and deserved much wider reconigtion, so for all you aspiring drummers out there...Buy this cd.
0545425115|5.0|I am not much of a reader, but my wife told me about the book. As soon as picked it up, I could not put it down. I finished it within 3 days, which is unheard of for me. The second book in the series I read just as fast. Great easy read, fantastic story. The flow of the book is fast paced and fun.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not the greatest writing, but definitely a fabulous read, has a great story line and she does a good jon keeping you on your toes.
B000002G8H|5.0|As I get older, I find that I tend to prefer well-chosen compilations to original albums. There are some exceptions, of course (how could any Beatles compilation even remotely do them justice?), but very often individual albums contain a few strong tracks and rather more weak ones and I don't have the patience to sit through the fillers.<br /><br />No such issues with this album. Clapton here produces a great selection of songs, melodic, rocking, brilliantly arranged and, as you'd expect, wonderfully performed. From the hard rock of 'The Core' through the bright shuffle of 'Lay Down Sally' to the exquisite tunefulness of 'Wonderful Tonight', there isn't a dud on the album. The arrangement is stripped down so every voice and instrument can clearly be heard and the playing and singing thus revealed are well worth hearing.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite albums. Every song is like a familiar friend and I never get tired of meeting them again. If every album were like this, the musical world would be a better place; and, incidentally, there would be fewer compilation albums, because there's nothing I would discard from this recording.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|really fun! awesome awesome I really like this because its fun and stuff yeah I'm just doing this for points lol isn't that funny like
B007N85ZXY|4.0|Bitch, moan and complain all you want this is a exceptional album.  The wild buzz of the guitars and the rough hue of the production bring these tired old folk songs to life.  There is something wicked and slightly evil about these songs and their performance, like the devils band playing in the dark night!  \\"Coming Around the Mountain\\"  is worth the price of admission.  I'm not sure who's coming but I don't want to be in town when she kills that red rooster!  Only weak song was \\"Get a Job\\" and I just didn't think it fit well with the raw production and style of this record.  But hey who really cares.  This is a great record to chase away the doldrums of summer.  Put it in your car and turn it up loud as you motivate down the road!  Works even better if your car isn't perfectly pristine and has a bit of personality!
B0000027RL|5.0|This debut album by Pearl Jam will always be my personal favorite Pearl Jam CD.This was right next to Nirvana's NEVERMIND as the two top Grunge albums of the early 90's.Every song on this album rocks.I love the the slow haunting intro to Once and how that same intro,which turns into the outro,closes out the album.If you never heard any of Pearl Jam's music,you should pick this up.It's a great introduction to a great band.
B0086700CM|3.0|Temple run is a fun app that can be entertaining. This is not the best app for road trips. I enjoy playing to get the people from the store, but after I have the things from the store I do not think I will really play. There are alot of bad reviews on this app. I for one do not think the app was too bad, some glitches but not to many that are so noticeable. Over all I think that Temple run is a fun good app, but it is not the best long term entertainment app. :)
B0002O7XW2|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.I personally fell in love with this car the first I seen it too lol There is just something really erotic and sexy looking about that slick 1958 Red Plymouth Fury.But the movie is great and this special edition dvd is just AWESOME! I loved the deleted scenes and the commentary from John Carpenter and Keith Gordan(Arnie Cunningham).If you're a big fan of this film like I am,and you don't have this special edition DVD version of it,BUY IT NOW! You will love it! I'm 100% sure.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good for spending time but all the games have no instruction and I don't know what to do
0790730960|3.0|Batman Returns(which was Burton's and Keaton's second Batman film),was alright,but I thought the story was kind of thin,and The Penguin was just a mess.I would have liked to see more of a \\"tuxedo-wearing,human looking,overweight corrupt guy\\" kind of Penguin,like how he is in the comics,and not some type of mutant looking creature,like he is in this film.But other than that.Catwoman was really good,and so were the other characters.But this was NOWHERE NEAR as good as the original movie was,in my opinion.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Down in these parts of the south any thang old western is great. Yall should get this thang. Well peace out homies! !!!!!!!!!!!!!! xoxoxo Thank God For Southern Women!!
B00005JNJV|4.0|Batman Begins was a really good film.It gave us a good look on how Bruce Wayne became Batman.Nolan brought back the darker Batman that we all loved from the comics,along with a few new villains which we've never seen in a Batman film,before this one.I was really happy how Christian Bale played Bruce Wayne/Batman.He brought back that seriousness to the role that Michael Keaton had.I thought Ra's al Ghul was a great villain.It was kind of a letdown though,because we did not see much of him in the middle of the movie.Just at the beginning and more at the end.I was not very happy with Johnathan Crane/Scarecrow.I didin't think that a guy putting a potato sack over his head and gassing people was very scary at all.Overall though.This is still a great film and I highly recommend it,if you've never seen it.
160094048X|3.0|I loved _Vegan with a Vengeance_ and was even more thrilled with _Vegan Cupcakes Take Over the World_, so I had high hopes for _Vegan Cookies Invade your Cookie Jar_.  This book was disappointing, not because there weren't a few wonderful recipes (crispy rice squares and snickerdoodles rocked), but because there are some HORRIBLE recipes.  The \\"Banana Everything\\" cookies had consistency of a bad muffin; the \\"Chocolaty Crinkle\\" cookies were overly chewy, flat and rather tasteless; the \\"Peanut Apple Pretzel Drops\\" were gummy, soggy and tasted like '70s-hippie food; \\"Magical Coconut Cookie Bars\\" were soggy and un-savable.*  I'm afraid to try any more of the recipes, because it is such a waste of ingredients when they wind up inedible.  The number of failures in this book genuinely puzzles me, because the authors are clearly able to hit a home run in the cookie department (e.g.,\\"Sparkled Ginger Cookies\\" in VWAV)  And, almost every recipe in the pie and cupcake books is top notch.  I wish the authors would do another cookie book with better testing and tasting.<br /><br />*I should add that I'm an experienced baker and follow recipes to the letter.
B001GZ6QDS|4.0|The other reviews are correct.This \\"special edition\\" really blows! When I first got this,I was hoping for some cool deleted scenes and maybe some commentary from Nolan and Bale.But Nope.None of that.Just a bunch of lame stuff that I did not give two craps about.But the movie itself is really good.Ledger as The Joker is a great performance.Although,his Joker was not very true to the comics,as Jack Nicholson's Joker was.But we are talking Nolan's Batman here.Which is supposed to be based in more of a \\"real life\\" kind of setting.Christian Bale once again does a great job playing Bruce Wayne/Batman.Bale caught alot of smack,because of how he did Batman's voice.But I thought he did a great job with it.The only bad thing was,there wasn't much of Two-Face.Harvey Dent was throughout the movie,but not very much of him when he was Two-Face.Overall.This is a really good film,and I am very much looking forward to the sequel,The Dark Knight Rises,with Tom Hardy as Bane and Anne Hathaway as Selena Kyle/Catwoman.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this seems to be a very good app! easy to use and love how it is so big! even the kids enjoy doing math on it!
0790731002|3.0|First off.Let me just say that, I think Val Kilmer did a really good job playing Batman/Bruce Wayne.Not as good as Keaton.Not by a longshot,but he was still pretty good.I think he does not get the credit that he deserves for his role as The Caped Crusader.Now,I think we can ALL agree that George Clooney was a total joke,along with that whole junk of a movie that he was in.I think if Kilmer would have been Batman in \\"Batman and Robin\\",it may not have been terrible.It probally still would have sucked,but I think it could have at least been a tad more tolerable.Anyway.With that being said.This movie overall was okay.Not the best.But still pretty good.Storyline could have been a little better and maybe the villains could have been darker,but I thought Carrey and Jones were decent.If you've never seen this film before,and you don't know if you should,because of all the negative things you hear about it.Still give it a chance.It's really not all THAT bad.Just avoid \\"Batman and Robin\\" like a virus though lol
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|UM U NO THAT I AM REAL IM DUCKY MOMO o yeah the apps terrible I wouldn't waste my time on this GAY!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|For a free app this is first rate. It works flawlessly on my kindle fire and I had no problem setting my location. The ads aren't intrusive so there is no real need to pay to upgrade to the add-free version. It has been very useful during the recent heatwaves especially the alert system and the lifestyle section which lets you know if the weather is making various things like mosquitoes or sinus pain more likely.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Norah Jones may be accused of a number of things, but making the same album twice is not one of them.  Little Broken Hearts is the latest exhibit in her continued artistic evolution, and it is definitely a winner.  She joins a long line of musicians to use a break up to fuel their creativity.  Add to this the surprise choice of Danger Mouse as producer, and you come up with uncharted territory - at least for Jones.<br /><br />While the overall tone of the album could be described as wistful, I still found one song downright infectious.  The song that grabbed me the first time I listened to this album was \\"Say Goodbye\\".  I love good vocal harmonies, and the chorus on this song delivers on the lines \\"Well it ain't easy to stay in love/if you can't tell lies\\".  As this also shows, Jones wears her broken heart proudly on her proverbial sleeve.<br /><br />Which genre goes especially well with break ups?  The blues, of course.  I like the infusion of blues on the title track without overtly taking over the song.  The electric guitar here and on \\"She's 22\\", \\"4 Broken Hearts\\", and \\"All A Dream\\" adds mournful tones that align with Jones' trip into melancholy.  She's working through some tough stuff, here folks.<br /><br />I don't know if it was intentionally or not, but I find the inclusion of a song titled \\"After The Fall\\" to be very fitting on the album that is, well, after The Fall.  Like the rest of this album it provides a contrast to the more upbeat tone of its predecessor.<br /><br />I've always loved Jones' voice, but the sorrow in these songs draws out an earnestness in her delivery that stands out to me among all of her work.  You can especially hear this on \\"4 Broken Hearts\\".<br /><br />In case you have any doubts left, I will say it plainly.  Little Broken Hearts is an artistic triumph for Norah Jones despite the personal toll she paid that led to the songs you'll find.  While the whimsical nature of her past music made it seem transient, I see Little Broken Hearts as her album that will stand the test of time.

0307245306|5.0|My sons enjoy listening to audio books while we are driving and also at home.  It is a challenge to find stories that I also enjoy listening to as well.  The Percy Jackson series was great!  We all enjoyed the adventure and the reader really brought the story to life.
B008B3H4VQ|3.0|Back when Korn, Limp Bizkit, and Linkin Park came out, I blamed these bands for ruining the post-grunge era.  While I haven't come around on all of them yet, I decided to give Linkin Park another chance when I saw that they had a new album come out last month.  While it will never reach the top of my list of favorite music, I have to admit that Living Things has changed my mind about Linkin Park to an extent.  Perhaps it is just the passage of time and a wiser, more open mind, but I find the style on this album to be interesting in the variety it provides.<br /><br />One thing that most of the songs on Living Things have in common is an out in front, clearly established beat.  This makes it a good workout album.  With the exception of \\"Castle Of Glass\\" and \\"Skin To Bone\\", the songs are pretty high energy.  The combination of instrumentation and electronics is not bad.  At times it reminds me of what I hear on albums from Garbage such as their recent release [[ASIN:B0081TZUAW Not Your Kind Of People]] (see my review).<br /><br />I find the dual vocalist concept interesting, but ultimately not very well executed.  Mike Shinoda handles rapping duty, but his delivery manages to serve only as a contrast to Chester Bennington's vacillations between emo and scream delivery.  Rap is not a genre that I listen to a lot, but I would prefer K'Naan or The Beastie Boys over Shinoda.  I don't mean to be harsh, but Bennington seems mostly void of vocal talent.  Even his screams seem whiny.  I can't decide if it is the lyrical content, the delivery, or both, but nothing from these songs really sticks with me.  They seem rather disposable, meant to go in one ear and out the other rather than contemplated.<br /><br />Download this:  Lost In The Echo
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Having owned this stylus since it was first available from Kickstarter, I can assure you that the wide barrel means that a  relaxed grip is all you need.  The half-dozen other models I've attempted to use cramped my hand after short periods of use.  This bad boy can keep you going through a long day of tapping, swiping, writing and drawing.  as a matter of fact, I have misplaced my Cosmonaut...and am so unhappy about it that I am not waiting for it to turn up....I need another one pronto.<br />Thinking about ordering but not quite sure?<br />Just<br />Do<br />It.
B0083EW97W|5.0|I honestly think this his best album yet.  As a fellow artist I was very impressed at songs like Walt Grace's Submarine Test and Whiskey,Whiskey, Whiskey.  These songs are some of his best stuff.  Folk story telling at its best.  Good job John!
B0029LHW4U|2.0|This really shouldn't be called Alice in Chains without Layne Staley; it was his unique voice, and drug-addicted anguish, that gave them not just their distinctive sound, but the passion and emotional edge that set them apart from their contemporaries. What we're left with without him is a rather lackluster CD that really should have been presented as a Jerry Cantrell solo album with the others credited as guest musicians, rather than to a band that had its emotional core permanently ripped out. There's no passion here, in fact, with the exception of the title track, dedicated to Layne, there's very little emotion of any kind on display, just a curiously detached Jerry Cantrell making observations like \\"California's alright, somebody check my brain\\". There's simply nothing here to compare with the likes of \\"Angry Chair\\", \\"God Smack\\", \\"Man in the Box\\", \\"Would?\\", or previous songs where Jerry sang lead, like \\"Heaven Beside You\\"; there's no heart, no sense of urgency, and not much to hold on to. I don't think I'll be listening to this one again any time soon.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Awesome puzzles but for some reason you have to buy them which is a real downer since the app itself only comes with about 20 free ones
B006Z7Z3R2|1.0|I love horror movies, I even love ones that are bad in a good way if you know what I mean. the kinda movies where the acting and the effects are bad but its still enjoyable because its funny or ridiculous. well this is not one of those films. Its just all around bad. the plot or lack there of, doesnt lead to anything and it doesnt build the characters in anyway. there are lots of random scenes that are totally unnecessary and leave you asking yourself \\"why?\\". The female character is the most unbelievable, with her constant awkward interactions with the other characters and her reactions to situations. Its an awful mix of terrible directing and Sh*t acting. bottom line dont waste your time you wont get a laugh or a scare.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the hunger games and I could not put it down I wanted to read more it was just so well written
0307719219|5.0|This is terrible but brilliant book to read.  They collect immense swaths of history from around the world to support their theory of why nations fail.<br /><br />In the same fashion as Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs and Steel, an excellent book in its own right, they compare contemporaneous societies to better explain why some succeed and others fail.  Their theory is that states that have extractive (or better said exclusive) political participation generate extractive economies which over time obstruct Schumpter's creative destruction from working and thus, these countries fall farther and farther behind the world.  In contrast, pluralistic societies engender more pluralistic (or perhaps distributive) economies which allow creative destruction to work properly and over time, innovation takes off.<br /><br />To prove their point, they go over Roman history, talk a great deal as to why the industrial revolution emerged in Great Britain and discuss the failure of various states from Spanish Latin America to rise of political plurality in early Virginia outposts.  Probably their most interesting example was how Venice first emerged as an innovative powerhouse and then over time fell back by eliminating pluralism in their economy and ultimately in their political establishment.  But they have many more, such as the economic powerhouse that is Botswana as compared to the failed nation state of Zimbabwe.<br /><br />They believe that Communist China in its present form is a more exclusive or extractive political environment and has thereby created an extractive economy.  Over time they believe it's innovation will run out of steam, unless it can transform itself to a more pluralistic political society.<br /><br />Essentially, pluralism means no one group can impede the evolution of technology. Schumpters creative destruction says that for innovation to take place, new technologies will necessarily push aside older ways of doing business and as some ways of doing business are destroyed, somebody in power gets hurt.  But with more pluralistic political establishments that someone cannot hold back the tide for long.<br /><br />However, within an exclusive political environment, those in power can hold back innovation and stop the pain for a long time. For example, in much of Ottoman Empire (Turkey, Arabia, etc.) there were no printing presses until the mid-1800s, almost 400 years after their introduction in Germany.  Why, because the religious and political orders felt that the ability to widely disseminate ideas, even biblical texts would make the religious hierarchy less authoritative and their political power less stable.  (Witness Luther's attack against the Catholic church, imagine if the Pope had banned all printing presses throughout Europe or for that matter Twitter and the Arab Spring of today).<br /><br />On the downside the book needs some serious editing.  It seemed to me that I was reading, multiple times how the Kongo deteriorated, how Latin America succumbed to extractive policies and how Great Britain emerged as a more pluralistic society.  That and their repetitive use of language, got boring.<br /><br />Nevertheless, as I got further into the book it was hard to put down.  Their logic is hard to deny and I am VERY impressed by their command of history around the globe from Roman times to modern day Africa. They certainly have an impressive theory and they amass lots of material to justify it. I just wish they could have done a better job at conveying it.

B006OCM0G0|3.0|I love food and to eat.Is that so really weird? I don't think so. I like sweets a lot more though.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is a great book for people of all fitness levels. My boyfriend had originally ordered the book because our friend (who is really ripped) recommended it.  He kept reading me excerpts from the book, which I found really interesting and decided to read it myself. We also read Mike's book on Muscle Myths.<br /><br />I loved Mike's straightforward approach to all aspects of weight lifting: cardio, nutrition, which exercises to do, how to do them and on what days, supplements, rest days and even sleep. He takes all of the guess work out of working out and makes it totally accessible to readers. I also found his writing style very encouraging and I felt like (even) I could do this program and be successful. I wanted to get started right away on my first training session.<br /><br />Mike wrote this book for men but I decided to try out his system with my boyfriend as a way to spend time together and support each other. I emailed Mike after day 3 to ask a question about how a female should approach nutrition since I wasn't really going for size. He wrote back right away with lots of great coaching for me. He told me several ways to adapt the program, even though he has a book for women coming out soon. He easily could have just said \\"wait and buy my book.\\"<br />I have been training for years with no significant results. After having finished the first week of Mikes program I can already tell that this will be very different.  Plus, the training sessions are so manageable.  He only has you doing 3-7 exercises per workout, so you blast your muscles and get out of there. No more spending the whole afternoon/morning at the gym.<br /><br />I love this book and after getting through the first week of the training program I can definitely say that it is credible and I highly recommend it.

B007UQ5Z1G|2.0|Linkin Park fans tend to divide into two factions, before and after Minutes to Midnight. As a Rolling Stone poll of the best LP songs just showed this week, the majority are in the pre-minutes corner with just one song out of 20 comming from 1000 suns and no songs from Minutes.<br /><br />Living things comes from the same fire as 1000 suns, but minus the message, the artifact songs and the interwoven speeches. The response to Living Things is much as it was to \\"The Catalyst\\" and that is \\"where does the house music actually fit in here?\\" It's not the lack of power that brings this record down, it's the addition of fluff. Seriously, take away the lyrics and you have a soundtrack for Magic Mike.<br /><br />From the opening synth we know the piping, up-tempo, thumping club music is not only a radical departure for LP but a poor contrast and juxtaposition to Chester's lyrics and style. On A Thousand Suns everything felt like a tripy, techno experiment but on the more straight-forward Living Things it sounds like an awful misstep. Mike feels in need of constant reassurance here<br /><br />\\"You lost that right / to hold that crown<br />I built you up but you let me down\\"<br />\\"I don't hold back I hold my own<br />I can't be mapped / I can't be cloned<br />I can't C-flat / it ain't my tone\\"<br /><br />Maybe he needs to forgo use of the word \\"I\\" because on this and 1000 Suns he keeps telling use how he really is cool, no matter what we say. While Chester's earnest \\"Each word gets lost in the echo' feels all the more relevant surrounded by Mikes unending self-affirmations. He's the Stuart Smally of rock-rap.<br /><br />By the time \\"I'll be gone\\" comes around you may not have noticed the songs changing, they feel so similar you could just fade them into each other. Then, suddenly this techno version of ... wait for it ... The Carpenters (go on kids, You-Tube that!) comes along and we're on a folksy, techno trip to the outer limits.<br /><br />Not that it can't get worse. \\"Victimized\\" tries to reaffirm the bands heavy roots much, actually exactly, the way St. Anger did for Metallica. A big, hollow drum noise with raw vocals, but first a techno-rap verse, now, scream \\"NEVER AGAIN, VICTIMIZED!\\" is a mess.<br /><br />Unlike 1000 Suns, which at least begged you to keep listening (as Chester wanted it to be one long uncut song and released an mp3 version of it that way) Living Things feels like a forced attempt to return to the rap-scream formula of Hybrid Theory and Meteora, but adding the pounding club techno in as if to say it's still something new. Well, new and better aren't the same thing, just different would have been fine, but an utter and complete misfire is what we have here.<br /><br />Living things is as light as air and as flimsy as plastic. The ever moaning \\"look, I am too cool\\" Rap with the \\"feel my pain\\" rock wears thin in one song, let alone 12. Worse yet, is you can take the band away and not notice. This entire record could be performed live with just Chester, Mike and Hahn and no one would notice. LP is not progressing as a band, they are struggling to find a voice, but, they already had one, they just needed to embrace it and trust in themselves to no re-write the first two albums rather than force themselves to do something completely misguided.imized\\" tries to reaffirm the bands heavy roots much, actually exactly, the way St. Anger did for Metallica.

B007Y6OZE0|3.0|Probably the best thing I can say about Days Go By is that Dexter seems to have found the voice he lost on Rise and Fall, and the caveat that the record doesn't actually suck.<br /><br />The first track \\"The future is now\\" may be the weakest opening track the Offspring ever came up with (this from a band that once opened a record by screaming \\"Ah f***, F*** f***, f***!\\") Did we choose our track titles from the book of super cliche's and things you should know better than to name your songs?<br /><br />Recorded in six studios over three years the \\"produced by Bob Rock\\" seems a bit of an overstatement. The album lacks cohesion, the songs feel cobbled together and the lyrics are mostly tired and say very little.<br /><br />By the time \\"California\\" comes on the record is already suffering from \\"it all sounds the same\\" fatigue, but this bubble-gum MTV Beach-party anthem may make you you suddenly skip to the next song if your windows are down at a red light, because you don't want anyone thinking you listen to this. Of course a big, banging music video and radio push could turn this into the one hit on the record, sad, it's a terrible song but in a world of \\"call me maybe\\" it could be the next \\"Thong Song.\\"<br /><br />OC Guns is the bands \\"yep, we stepped in it\\" song. Crawling along, the repetitive grinder says \\"tiki, tiki, tiki\\" way more times than any lyric should, spews Hispanic obscenities and features a James Cagney like voice \\"shoot him in the back.\\" Can't wait for it to be over.<br /><br />The one thing that can't go without mentioning is the re-recording of \\"Dirty Majic\\" from Ignition. While, on one hand the vocals are much better here the bigger-is-better approach is not. There's much added to a minimalist song that need-not be there like extra instrument parts and harmonies. The worst offense is slowing down the chorus and adding \\"go on and\\" to every-other-line. The song looses power and veracity and gains nothing.<br /><br />One odd, bright point is the closer \\"Slim Picken's does the right thing and rides the bomb to hell.\\" Not quite \\"Change the World\\" (but then again, it doesn't have \\"Amazed\\" as a lead-in) but it'll do and make the previous 40 minutes feel less painful in retrospect. It seems the Offspring have hit a point where they don't know what they want in a record and put whatever comes out there, let's hope they get over that. This one will collect dust until the next.\\"Slim Picken's does the right thing and rides the bomb to hell.\\" Not quite \\"Change the World\\" (but then again, it doesn't have \\"Amazed\\" as a lead-in) but it'll do and make the previous 40 minutes feel less painful in retrospect.

B008B3H4VQ|3.0|I've been a fan since I ran across a great homemade video that a fan put Final Fantasy gameplay and cut screen to In The End (Album Version) from Hybrid Theory (Special Edition). I love the heavy rock mixed with the rap and electronic sound. I loved Minutes To Midnight as well. To me these are the Linkin Park I love.<br /><br />Any band can do whatever they want with new albums. Sometimes it works for fans and sometimes not. For me, when I want a sreaming, metal sounding, rock anthem heavy, with a dash of rap sound I listen to those albums. I wanted more of the same, but I didn't get it.<br /><br />I don't hate the sound, but after listening through once tonight (I just bought it tonight) I didn't come across a single song that impressed me. The first 2/3 of the album are screaming, heavy sounding songs but the lyrics aren't memorable and the music isn't intriguing; it all sounds the same. The final 1/3 of the album are ballads, and again, just okay.<br /><br />Look, I still love Linkin Park and I don't regret my purchase (it's only five bucks!) but it isn't what I was looking for. And for those reviewers who want to be angry at anyone scoring down Linkin Park because it wasn't what we wanted - what's the point of reviewing if it isn't to say whether we got something we liked? It is totally valid to say that we were disappointed if we were. Just as valid as those who love the new sound.<br /><br />I, for one, am looking forward to their next album, which I hope is closer to the previous two than this one. Just my opinion.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are just plain awesome. even though it says 101 games it is actually 126.  I think this is one of the best apps I have.
B005LCECU6|4.0|I TOTALLY dig this version of Rush.  It's loud and heavy as heck.  The guitar tone is to die for.  ES335/Marshall Plexi.  Geddy is on fire.  It's a different version of a younger neil.  He had only been with the band for less than a month before this gig.  Definitely better sounding than even All the World's a Stage.  roll a fatty and ride down the freeway at night and crank this thing to the brink of distortion and imagine you're there.  THen you'll get it.<br /><br />I have one problem with this album.  I would love to go back to 1974 to the jerk audio guy who mixed this broadcast and slap his hand off of the pan pot on Alex's track, break all of the pan knobs so he leaves them in place, and say, \\"NO!!! Bad sound man!!!!\\"  The panning wasn't cool back then and it isn't cool now.<br /><br />I'm sorry this is not official.  I can understand why Rush wouldnt release an otherwise great sounding kick axx recording due to the guitar panning thing.  If it wasn't floating around the internet for years, this would be a must have.  If you don't have a copy of these songs, GET IT!!!

B000002JBG|5.0|i first seen this movie as a young kid in the 90's and i loved this movie.  this about Michal Jordan going into the toon world and playing some basket ball with them.  before bugs and daffy go get mike there are little aliens that get challenged to basket ball.  to make them self get bigger they absorbed the talent from some professional basket ball players.  which causes them to grow the size of buildings.  this movie also stars Wayne Knight (Jurassic Park)  and Bill Murry (ghost busters).  this is a funny movie.  if you like toon/ live action movies and never seen this check it out.

0307592731|3.0|Strayed's memoir of her life and her on and off hike on the PCT are interesting enough, but not in the same context as [[ASIN:0060730552 Touching the Void: The True Story of One Man's Miraculous Survival]] or [[ASIN:B004VXKTT4 STACY'S STORY]].  I expected this to be a suspenseful read, showcasing the protagonist's personal holocaust and what she went through to survive it.  In the two aforementioned books the protagonists do not contrive to place themselves in jeopardy nor do they seek to place blame or question their misfortune; they are simply too busy trying to remain alive.  Their next step does not result in a stubbed toe or broken fingernail, but places them inches closer to exiting through death's door, a component crucial to a great thriller.  In Wild, one gets the impression the protagonist goes out of her way to throw her life over a cliff, repeatedly, (Infidelity, drugs, irreverence, heedless sex) and then laments the impact of the back-draft.  In the book, she's not vulnerable to the loss of life or limb, except through ill-advised self-infliction.  Strayed's antagonist, as she so mindfully reveals in her memoir, is herself, exacerbated by poor choices.  If you're looking for a story on not what to do after you've been jostled by life, then this may be it.  If you're looking for a good suspenseful thriller or inspirational story, try elsewhere.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Let me start off by saying, I am NOT a reader. I was very apprehensive to start reading these books because when I do decide to pick up a book, it has to be really good to hold my attention! I usually only read fiction. Well, I could not put this book down. I loved it! I am now half way through the second one (Fifty Shades Darker)<br />I would agree with some reviews that said \\"Christian Grey - you love him and hate him at the same time.\\" There is a lot of passion between the main characters. The author did a great job of making me feel everything she (Anastasia Steele) was feeling.<br />There is quite a few 'sex scenes' and they are very graphic at times. It was very erotic to me, but to some people it may be too much. The book does open the readers eyes to the world of BDSM.<br />I'm really glad I read this book though. And I'm enjoying the second one right now. Can't wait to read the third! And I really hope they do make a movie!!!!!

0810993139|5.0|I was taking my husband in for minor surgery, and as we were going out the door I grabbed the only reading material I could find, Diary of a Wimpy Kid. My son and daughter love the series so I thought I'd see what the fuss was about.<br /><br />An few hours later I found myself sitting in the hospital waiting room laughing hysterically. Even though Greg's a modern kid, his experiences at school are timeless, like Fregley, the weird kid with the secret freckle, the quest for popularity, the \\"cheese touch\\" is just another name for old-time cooties. Even Greg's stick figure drawings are notably funny, but the book goes deeper than that. It's about the angst of trying to fit in, the trials of friendships, and sibling rivalry. Highly entertaining for both young and old.

He goes to a hospital and asks to be admitted. It does a good job of really showing how Greg (the young teenager) gets threw this hard time. I really emjoyed the movie to watch him hurt in the beginning to feeling better at the end. Most people who are depressed don't say a word and never get help, so maybe this movie will inspire people to speak up. You have to open up, so you can heal. A very funny movie in all and a heart warming story, kinda. ;)<br />I would like to just add this qoute in here because I think it's apporatie.<br />Unless you learn to face your own shadows, you will continue to see them in others, because the world outside you is a reflection of the world inside you.
0439023513|1.0|The first was great 2nd k/Great this One...really?<br />It was reallly long and had too much depressing parts it was exstreamly difficult to continue. I find the ending of what was an wonderfula series, up until now, very troublesome. Gpiyh
1416972250|3.0|Sadly I didn't end up liking this one as much as I liked the last two. The characters spent a majority of the time NOT connecting things which made me really frustrated. Like really, you know the villian has another son, and someone mysteriously shows up around his son's age that none of you know? Why did it take you so long to put these things together? Jace has zero qualities of a demon, how did you not realize he had angel blood and therefore couldn't be Valentine's son? Seriously guys, pay attention.<br /><br />There were also some plot holes I found troublesome. I mean, Jace was a full two years younger than Johnathan, right? How did no one notice that he was a lot closer in age to Clary, and the timeline didn't match up for him to be her brother? I think they were too worried about their angst, and not worried enough about using their brains. Which was kind of the theme of the book, which I found frustrating.<br /><br />Overall the actual plot of the book moved well though, and I love the storyline. I just want the characters to grow up a little. I get that love is the most powerful emotion in the world, but I think Clary needs to be a little bit more like Isabelle who realizes the gravity of every situation, and less of a brat. That being said, I'm hoping that since she got her way in the end she'll mature a little so we can focus on the plot, not her whining. Because when she stands up for herself and what she believes in, (like she did with the clave) she is perfection. Strong but humble, self-assured but completely aware of her faults. That's what I want to see more of, not Clary being a tween.

1416972250|3.0|Okay, I read the first book in a day. I will not lie when it was said that Jace and Clary were related I googled it to get my answer. Sweetie, I'm not a patient person. Honestly, the books just got worse and worse. I've read better Dr. Suess books. This was just bad. Bad, typical, cookie cutter writing. It was like Star Wars. And Sebastian was a creep. Seriously a douche bag. Now, I'm giving it a three, because I'm a nice person, and I've still read worse. This book did nothing for me. No revelations, no serious mood changes, not even making my heart thump wildly. It was boring. I don't see myself reading the next ones. It was that bad.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|Both myself and my wife enjoyed the movie so much, specially the 3d edition. 3 of my friends who borrowed the Blu-ray also highly regarded the movie. I usually do not like to watch a movie again and again. However, this is one of the exceptions that I would love to watch few more times.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I had alot of fun with this game.  It requires some thinking though to figure out what to do next to move on. I have to admit that I had to look online to find the solution to one situation,  and after I did I felt silly for not being able to figure it out on my own.  The game could have been longer though.
B005M0R524|5.0|Downton Abbey is, in my opinion, one of the best historical fiction dramas released in 2010-2011.  It is intriguing, suspenseful and informative regarding British aristocratic culture during the years leading up to and after the war.
B004AHNIGM|5.0|I kinda hate the \\"intellectual\\" critiques of this CD.<br />Blues, and especially Gregg Allman are something you FEEL. It's not in the brain, it's in the very cells of your body.<br />Someone else ( bronco) said, listening to Gregg sing--\\"it hurts so GOOD\\"<br />I listen to this ENTIRE Low Country CD very very often--have my favorites, like Checkin up on my Baby, and Just another Rider But it is ALL great. I also have ALL his body of work and Gregg NEVER put out anything that didn't come from deep in his soul.<br />I don't know how anyone could ever have heard the Allman Brothers band and NOT have recognized that HE is the band. There's a world of great drummers and guitarists out there---not to take anything away from the Brothers, because that band was TIGHT. They finished each other's sentences, musically speaking. But without that VOICE it would have been just another great \\"Southern Rock Band\\", as they were labeled.(they were always SO much more than that!) I have NEVER forgotten  being at a concert and the ABB was smokin!!!It was almost exhausting. Then with these screaming guitars playing at the speed of light, SUDDENLY the lights went blue,leaving one single guitar note laying on the air,it's scream fading away--at the last moment he bent a string and Gregg came in singing YEAH YEAH YEAH, as they went into Not My Croos to Bear. WHAT an emotional experience that was. The whole arena was riveted by his voice. So dont analyze him, just FEEL him. Pray for him and love him. He is a gift.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Okay, so I had really high expectations for a Liam Neeson movie after seeing him last in Taken.  Maybe because that movie was such a tough act to follow, this one was such an epic disappointment.  He was actually fine, I guess.  Probably the only thing wrong that he did was accept the role.  The character buildup was crap, and there were a bazillion major holes in the story.  I gave it 2 stars because...hmmm, nevermind - I can't justify that.  I'm giving it one star because it was dumb.
0345803485|5.0|I'm surprised at how many people hate this series. Maybe it's because they're looking for a masterpiece, or literary genius. Um, no. It's fan fiction.<br /><br />Has anyone who gave this book one star ever read fan fiction? It's supposed to be totally unrealistic. It's supposed to be a complete and utter fantasy. Go on tumblr and read some fan fiction about Supernatural, the gay lover brothers who are in a love triangle with the angel. Or One Direction, who all in some sort of love pentagon with each other.<br /><br />This book is a combination of everyone girls dream: a sexy, successful, mysterious, dangerous, sexual deviant...<br /><br />I thought it was a great read, and I kept wanting more. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for an escape from reality.

030758836X|1.0|This book has shown up on a lot of the \\"must read\\" lists for summer 2012.  I was excited to read what was described as a clever mystery.  Don't waste your time.  I am beginning to wonder whether the definition of clever has been dumbed down.  This is not an intelligent read.  The characters are not well developed.  I could say that I didn't care for them but I'm not sure I was really given a chance to know them.  And, the ending is ridiculous.  What are the publishers thinking?  Contrary to the New York Times review, there is no evidence of a quicksilver mind in this book.  I am craving a truly well written mystery that doesn't pander to the general public's desire for simplicity.  Gone Girl is not that type of book.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|I finished the first Hunger Games book yesterday (7/5/12) and I have to say - I didn't really care for it. I looked at my Kindle at 40% and nearly just said 'Forget it' - and I rarely dump books, but I bought all three books at once due to the fact that so many friends raved about the movie and books - so I kept plowing through. Finally around 60% it picked up. I'm sure I'll be burned at the stake for not falling over the book like everyone else. I've not seen the movie, but I'm afraid this may be one of the rare times the movie is better than the book. We'll see when it hits Blu-Ray. I'm now 40% through the second book - it is better than the first so far so I'm glad I forced my way through Book 1. Surely I'm not the only reader who had a hard time with the half-post-apocolyptic half-Willy-Wonka book?

B0017SWPXY|5.0|The premise of a book written from the perspective of a television-addicted, race-car loving, unusually insightful, buddhist dog sounds gimmicky. And in the hands of a lesser writer it might be. But Garth Stein's characters are so real, his situations so laugh-out loud funny, his plot so moving, and his dog so believable that this book stands out as one of the best in recent years. If you've ever wondered what your dog was thinking, Garth Stein knows...

1408430487|4.0|Dark Places was the third book I read in a row by Gillian Flynn.  This book was the most disturbing, by far! These books have haunted characters that draw you in. Cutters, kidnappers, and murderers: intoxicating and curious.  These are wonderful reads that are all page turners. However, the gruesome acts are just that!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great app it works well and has a lot of translations and is a little more convinientnthan a book you can simply type what you want to read and its there I haven't had any function problems  and it is a great app 5stars!
0375850864|4.0|My 11 year old son read this book for school. He thought it was so interesting that I should read it,so i did!<br />Very different with a lot of thought-provoking events...keeps you wondering and guessing.<br />He and I had a great discussion about it afterward.<br />Also loved that an adult and a child could both really enjoy this book. Recommended!
030758836X|3.0|I have read both of Ms. Flynn's other novels and enjoyed them.  I think she has a highly creative mind and a masterful way of getting under the skin and the psyche in unsettling, disturbingly good detail.  Her characters tend to be real, gritty and human in the most gruesome of ways.<br /><br />There is a great deal about \\"Gone Girl\\" that I appreciated and fully admit to being engrossed enough to lose much needed sleep to keep reading.  I wholeheartedly agree with reviewers who say \\"the less you know about the book, the more you will enjoy it\\".  Having read a few reviews, some of the \\"big twists' were at least suspected (if not anticipated) and I wished I had come to the book without any foresight.  So, to those of you who have not read the book, consider NOT reading any more reviews!<br /><br />Near the end of the book, the direction it was taking began to alert me that I was going to hate the ending, and hate it I did.  I will give Flynn credit that I did not hate is as MUCH as I though I would, as she did mange to keep some interest in the resolution, but it was still a clunker and a disappointment.<br /><br />SPOILER ALERT (just in case).  I really don't want to give to much away, so I will tread carefully.  My experience was that a particular complex characterization in the book that was a thrilling rarity of a deranged psychosis that you can almost RELATE to  was reduced to a borderline offensive \\"Sex and the City\\" cliche.  Maybe \\"War of the Roses\\" if you want to give the author a bit more credit.  I felt cheated that the story had introduced this conquering hero of redemption and revenge, only to render the character a sad-sack of neediness in the end - almost to the degree where the oft described and revered intellect of the character seemed to fly out the window.<br /><br />All the rage, and the twisted intellectual awareness flowing through the story winds up boiling down to....\\"the only thing that makes you truly happy is a man\\".  There is enough in Flynn's prose where one could argue that it really wasn't that simple and the \\"happiness\\" at the end was sick and unhealthy in numerous ways....BUT I still think she could have taking the resolution of this story in a much different direction that would have 1) made more sense, given they way she had drawn a particular character and 2) provided a ending more fitting for the investment in the story.<br /><br />I know some reviewers have recounted their reaction to the ending as, \\"that's it?\\".  For me, it was \\"you've got be kidding\\".  I stayed hopeful that it might round this annoying corner and still end with a bang, or something that felt satisfying and true to the characters, but it did not.<br /><br />So, three stars for an engrossing read and well-drawn characters, minus two stars for the awful ending.
B001HNE3NO|4.0|The plot was sometimes complex, sometimes shallow.  But the combination worked quite well.  The major impact of this book was that it clearly gave the reader a deeper insight into the facts and emotions associated with the Holocaust, even if the characters were fictitious.  The book is worth reading.

B005V2S7FW|4.0|So it's a bit confusing at first, but once you understand how it works on the different mobile devices LastPass does function very well.<br /><br />On all devices, the app will sync with your master list of passwords and you can always copy/paste the username/password and view/edit the list.<br /><br />On the Kindle Fire, the AutoFill functionality doesn't work unless you launch with the LastPass browser that gets installed.  It's not a separate browser with an icon, but from the LastPass app you can connect and browse.  Unlike other mobile devices, this app does not seem to work with other apps installed on the Fire.  On those devices, you can select a different input method and then LastPass becomes a \\"keyboard\\" where you can use the AutoFill functionality to login.  However, when browsing the web using the built in browser, the LastPass autofill functionality does not work - unless you install the Dolphin browser and the LastPass plugin.  Only then does the functionality mimic the experience used on the Mac/PC.<br /><br />So, if you only have a Kindle and no other mobile devices, then you may not want to shell out the $12 a year for this app.  However, if you have other devices (blackberry, android mobile, iphone) and are looking for the one app to help you manage all your passwords - the $12 covers all your mobile devices not just the Kindle.  I highly recommend this app, but again, you have to understand how it works on the different devices.<br /><br />If it worked seamlessly the same across all platforms, then easily 5 stars, but the slight learning curve knocks it down by one.

030758836X|4.0|An ardent reader, I am always in search of a provocative, engaging, and mesmerizing book.  Gone Girl is just that, until the last few pages.  Gillian Glynn, the author invites you in as a reader and within the first 50 pages has you invested in both Nick and Amy.  Nick is a fascinating but troubled character who shares his innermost thoughts with you via alternating chapters as he reflects upon both his good fortune as well as his undeniable misteps.  Amy draws you in as she reflects upon her dreams and the shattering of her dreams through throught provoking diary entries.  Several times throughout the book, you will undoubtedly stop and exhale in anticipation of the next chapter.  Not only is the story line intriguing, it is plausible, surprising, and totally  challenging until the very end.  The conclusion left me unsatisfied but maybe that's just a quirk in my personal psyche.  Nevertheless, I encourage you to read and enjoy this memorable third novel from Gillian Flynn.  So good, I have already obtained her debut novel and will also obtain Dark Places.

B004SEUJN2|5.0|This movie is one of those classics that you go back to every now and then just to enjoy the ride. The fact that you know the ending and the twists and turns it may take doesn't really matter. Just look around and you'll see a few things you missed before. In fact, knowing the story may actually make it more interesting; Kind of give it an 'inside joke' feel. If you want a movie that you can watch more than once, hits on several different levels, and is an intricate little knot to fiddle at, here it is.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|We've all seen the plot holes and scientific inaccuracies listed online. This movie is an insult to science fiction and an insult to Alien. The writer from Lost? Really? The guy who answered all of his questions with, \\"Oh, never mind. They were in purgatory the whole time, so nothing I wrote up until now matters.\\" He's a garbage writer and should be blacklisted.
B007N85ZXY|5.0|This is a fun CD from Neil Young with his version of a lot of songs we grew up with.
B001HN69AY|4.0|Terry Gilliam films are certainly not to everyone's taste (I myself am not really one of his fans), and this film will certainly be no exception. However, to paraphrase one of the other reviewers, anyone walking into a Gilliam film and expecting a coherent narrative has obviously been comatose for a very long time. So at best one goes into the film having some idea of what to expect (or, better yet, what not to expect). Simply put, this film definitely worked for me. While this dark fairy tale certainly does not always make sense, it is so wildly imaginative and visually stunning that you should just abandon yourself to it and enjoy it. Some people will see the film just out of curiosity in that it is Heath Ledger's last. Just about everyone knows that Ledger died while filming, and that Johnny Depp, Jude Law, and Colin Farrell stepped in to see that the film was completed, so there is some added poignancy in the films dedication: \\"A film from Heath Ledger and his friends.\\" Gilliam did what he could to work around Ledger's untimely death, and the use of the other three actors is pretty successful (at least it makes sense within the context of the movie). But this is definitely a director's film, and if you enjoy being witness to someone's (Gilliam's) imagination allowed to run wild, then you should be a fan of this film.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was worse than pathetic. I don't know what the big deal is about this book, because the writing is so bad that I just couldn't read any more after like, chapter 5? It was also unnecessarily trashy. I would not recommend this to anyone...ever.
0345803507|5.0|Best book series I've ever read!! Wish it was longer!  I looked forward to reading this series every night and was sad when I was finished! The author needs to write another series that is just as good but longer! I loved it!!!!!
B005LAII1C|4.0|Several years ago the creators of South Park were highly critical of the series \\"Family Guy\\" and its style of humor. Nevertheless, Family Guy has matured into a reliable vehicle for cutting edge humor while South Park, in my opinion, became stale - evolving gradually into a formulaic package showcasing its creators' seemingly narrow political ideologies and more recently often adopting extreme gross out humor supported by little, arguably, in the way of comedic substance.<br /><br />\\"Ted\\" showcases the talents of Family Guy's creator Seth MacFarlane on the big screen. The humorous results are often downright hilarious, witty, incisive and novel. There are a few instances of standard bathroom style humor, though they are amped up in ways that gives them new life. However, for me some of the very best parts of this film, much like the Family Guy series, are the rich, reoccurring and exploited pop culture references. If you do not want some key surprises in this film ruined, I strongly advise not reading too many reviews of it before you see it. If you grew up in the 1980s this film will be much funnier if you go in blind to its content. At the same time, the script incorporates humor for young adults as well. There were a couple key references to current icons that I did not get, but that the younger members of the audience absolutely roared at. There is truly something for everyone (except small children, who should definitely not see it). I do somewhat agree with the notion that the film loses a bit of comedic steam when it turns serious, but I also understand why the writers chose to do it. Ultimately the storyline ends up being quite a bit more than just a slapstick or screwball comedy, so a bit of drama (and seriousness) helped increase the total impact of the film.<br /><br />Finally - Mark Wahlberg. . .he is just impressive throughout this film. He's an incredibly versatile actor and in \\"Ted\\" he demonstrates once again that he can also be very, very funny.<br /><br />Check out \\"Ted.\\" It is one of the funniest films to hit the big screen in a long time - far better, in my opinion, than the popular \\"Hangover\\" films - and a great exposé of the hilarious happenings inside the mind of Seth MacFarlane.

141694737X|5.0|This was my favourite children's book when I was a child and now I am delighted to be sharing it with my daughter who loves it as much as I do.<br /><br />We've been reading this together since she was only a small baby but she now loves lifting the flaps herself, anticipating the next animal and celebrating when she gets it right.<br /><br />Rod Campbell has written several Lift the Flap books - this is by far my favourite. The others only appear to be available in the UK but are well worth the investment of the extra shipping!<br /><br />I heartily recommend this book to all those with children under the age of 7 and they will continue to love it after this age. I am purchasing this book for all of our friends with kids as it is the best book ever!
B005MYEPXC|5.0|\\"Midnight in Paris\\" now ranks among my favorite Woody Allen films of all time...and that's saying a lot. First and foremost, the film is set entirely in Paris and is just beautiful to watch. Allen really captures all the best things about the city in this movie. Second, though, the story itself is a true delight. Owen Wilson stars as Hollywood screenwriter and aspiring novelist Gil Pender, who is visiting Paris with his obnoxious fiancee (Rachel McAdams) and her parents. Gil is at kind of a crossroads, and he ends up wandering around Paris aimlessly in the middle of the night. He gets lost, and then he meets some colorful new friends who are right out of the Golden Age: we're talking Pablo Picasso, Ernest Hemingway, and Gertrude Stein here, among others. Gil also meets a charming woman (Marion Cotillard) who makes him begin to question the choices he's made and determine what he wants out of life.<br /><br />This is a beautiful and clever film full of witty references to classic art, literature, etc. It's also a great story about a man who really finds himself in the beautiful City of Lights. I really enjoyed \\"Midnight in Paris\\" and I highly recommend it.
0670022411|5.0|Deborah Harkness has crafted a fantastic world. Just a touch more magical than the one we live it making it easy to fall into and believe. Her characters are well developed and thoroughly enjoyable. The book itself has a slow burn effect. With each passing chapter we are pulled in more and more till you can't bear to put the book down for a second.<br /><br />I love the way the author has crafted both magic and history into an ever evolving storyline. Some authors put to much effort into \\"building\\" their world and the story suffers for it. This is not the case in A Discovery of Witches. Harkness gives you just enough reality with a touch of something more making it easy to understand.<br /><br />I've read some reviews that compared the romance of Diana and Matthew to Romeo and Juliet. Other than the whole ill-fated lovers comparison I just don't see it. Romeo and Juliet is, to me, more a story of raging hormones and teenage angst where as this was a novel about actual love. The kind you don't expect or maybe even want. Even with the odds against them, since she's a witch and he's a vampire, Diana and Matthew are willing to fight to stay together.<br /><br />Its hard to not fall in love with both main characters. Diana is strong willed and stubborn, but still willing to let someone into her heart. Matthew tries to be detached but can't help himself around Diana. His controlling nature feels more like a mother hen than an overbearing boyfriend. The secondary characters are just as enjoyable. I found their backstories concise enough to be interesting but not detract from the storyline.<br /><br />I can't wait to start the next one!

1594744475|2.0|I have a picky five year old, and I started making bento boxes for her lunches in order to inspire her to try new things and have her venture away from the ham and mustard sandwich her dad had been packing her every day for months.  It really did work!<br />I purchased this cookbook as a source of new ideas, but didn't find much inspiration.  I was looking for a bit of healthy variety for my munchkin, and this was pretty lacking.  Most of the recipes are based around white rice and processed meat.  Not a great deal in the veggie or fruit department.  My advice?  Save the money and search the net - there are a lot of better options out there, both in ingredient choice and themes.
0345803485|1.0|It is depressing that this is a best seller and that so many of my friends and colleagues have read it and have perpetuated the hype. Repetitive and nothing new, this is hands down the worst book I have ever read. The hype kept me going until the bitter end... \\"surely there is a twist coming,\\" I thought. Wrong. After skimming the other reviews, nobody seems to be disturbed by the fact that the \\"hero\\" beat the, excuse the expression, crap out of this young girl. Why would so many people think this is okay for an innocent girl? Save your precious time and money. This author has made enough already.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I thought I'd see what the fuss was all about so I bought the book.  Ripped off - and not in the bodice ripping way!  Ridiculous is the word that springs to mind.  Take out the sex and it's a teen romance.  The writing is repetitive, boring and infantile.  I managed to finish the book, wondering with each turn of the page when it was going to get good.  I even found myself skimming through the sex scenes.<br />Don't buy this book.  \\"Oh my\\", don't buy it.  \\"Holy crap\\" it's rubbish!
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Just complete first six chapters. The story happens in a world (perhaps future) where the rules of governance are different. It is absorbing so far. It is a new idea. It is too early to form a final opinion.
B0040ZN9WM|5.0|I bought these sandals in the beginning of the springtime, when I realized that putting socks and shoes on a squirmy toddler a million times a day was a bad idea.  I chose them for their style and washability, and now wish that I'd gotten the next size up.  My daughter outgrew them in just a few months, being 1, and now there are no more available in her next size up.  She still cuddles and carries around one of these shoes and tries to put it on.  She's very picky about shoes, so if it has her seal of approval, that's enough for me.

B007RP4D5Y|5.0|This album so completely achieves what it sets out to do, and every listen is becoming more enjoyable!  What makes it so enjoyable, so compelling, is essentially discovering the individual genius of each band member coming together in total unity, as the title suggests.  I've been following Metheny since I was 16 with \\"Bright Size Life,\\" and in the last ten years or so it seems the composer/guitarist has been looking around for new combinations and collaborations.  I think this is--by far--his best recent musical incarnation.  Saxaphonist Chris Potter is phenomenal here, really soaring in some passages, as if Metheny urges him full reign.  Antonio Sanchez is dazzling, as usual (it's no wonder he's been Metheny's principle drummer for a while).  But maybe it's the young Ben Williams who really knocks me out, whose bass provides the concrete, not to mention some beautiful lines.  So I guess what's up with this is Metheny is out to bring out the best in his collaborators.  Mission accomplished.  I also love the variety of the album and the statement it makes as a whole: it seems all the Metheny \\"genres\\" are here, along with his sounds, guitar synth, 42-string guitar, orchestrion, but in new combinations.  I love the haunting \\"Interval Waltz\\" going into the minimalist \\"Signals,\\" where you can hear very clearly Metheny's debt to Steve Reich.

B0050VA428|3.0|I read this book along with my granddaughter - it was her school prescribed summer reading. Because this is a well-known mystery, I looked forward to reading a Sherlock Holmes book. How could the book be bad? Well, I don't think it was a bad book, but I do think it wasn't a book to engage middle school kids. The formality of the times and the English setting somehow detracted from the story. This book is an oldie that probably deserves it's fame, however, it seemed a poor choice for a middle-school teen.

1400095204|5.0|Half of a Yellow Sun takes place in Nigeria during the Nigeria/Biafa civil war. The narrative follows 3 characters: Ugwu, a village boy who is taken in by some politically-inclined academics as a house boy; Olanna, Ugwu's mistress and a rich heiress; and Richard, a British expat who desperately wants to be accepted by the Biafrans as one of them. The stories of these three characters are superbly and tragically woven together on a backdrop of war, racial hatred, and famine. This is one of the most impressive books I've read in quite a while. The characters were so deep that I felt I knew them. The events described had an eerie realism to them that comes from the author's intimate knowledge of the history and people. This is one of those books that makes you feel like every incident described is important and well-planned. This is a story not only of war, but of people--their dreams, their loves, their fears, their strengths and weaknesses. Half of a Yellow Sun is a must-read for anyone interested in international literature.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I am absolutely addicted to reading. I do so every spare moment and when I cannot read for myself I have my kindle read to me. So when a friend of mine kept bugging me to read this book with her I did so happily. I have read the full trilogy in 3 days. I kept reading waiting for it to get better and it never did. I do not normally give bad reviews at all, but there was so much repetition in this book that I thought I was stuck in the movie \\"Groundhog Day\\". And the main characters were just plain annoying. I do not understand why it took three books to get this story across. I would not recommend this book to any avid readers. Why is this trilogy on the one of the top books on Amazon?

0812993292|3.0|Normally, I really enjoy small, slice-of-life stories about ordinary people, which is why I ordered the Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry. It has been compared to [[ASIN:0812981227 Major Pettigrew's Last Stand: A Novel]], and in fact, the cover includes a glowing testimonial by that book's author. But while I absolutely loved \\"Major Pettigrew,\\" I was less enamored of \\"Harold Fry.\\" I realize, based on the other reviews, that makes me something of a contrarian, but although the concept was good (though not groundbreaking--David Grossman's To the End of the Land had a similar premise), by its very nature the book was episodic and a bit slow, kind of plodding along like Harold himself. The author did her best to get inside the heads of Harold and his wife, Maureen, and she introduced the requisite colorful characters along the way. She also hinted at elements of the back story that weren't revealed fully until the end. And the main characters were changed, as they need to be in all good fiction.    But the book and its characters never really engaged me the way Major Pettigrew's cast did. Just as there was a sameness to many of Harold's days (at least until he was joined by a group of hangers-on), there was a predictability and repetitiveness to many of the chapters--lots of description of the weather, the countryside and the roads, physical challenges and various encounters with mostly kind people. And toward the end, some of the events were just implausible. It was simply hard to believe, for example, that some of the characters would pour their hearts out to complete strangers in the way they did. It was as if the author was using the device for convenience, to reveal parts of the story, without much regard for whether it was believable. Even one of the pivotal back story events, which I won't reveal for fear of spoiling, didn't make sense. Why would the character, a number cruncher, be cleaning someone else's office?    Rachel Joyce clearly has great potential as awriter--she knows how to describe the world she's depicting and is insightful about her characters--but this book, her first, didn't really resonate with me, primarily because of the pacing and the implausibility of some of the elements. Perhaps her next one will.

0743437497|5.0|Stephen King can do no wrong, but that's just my humble opinion. I hope no one is writing a review on this book based on the movie. They don't even compare. This is a nail biting, suspenseful, ghost story. I can only imagine living in that humongous hotel, I would be petrified. King did an excellent job of making you feel that you were trapped there with the family. This is a book that I read at least once a year, when I wanna be carried away to a remote place and have the creeps!!<br /><br />Read this one--you can't go wrong!
B0015AARJI|1.0|What's the matter Sony?<br />Was $40 not enough for you to include the cable necessary to charge this controller in the first place?<br /><br />Why? WHY would you not include the cable needed to charge and use this controller? To save a few dollars? Certainly not because you want people to buy your controller. THIS is why Sony has sold the least amount of consoles this generation- these anti-consumer practices.<br /><br />The controller is fine. The fact that it comes without a required cable, is not.

You can't do much with it, I really wanted to put it in iTunes, but you can't you have to use their software. I want to have it with all my other digital movies! If they want to stop piracy, you don't do something like this, offer a digital copy but then put a lot more restrictions on it! But the movie was 5 stars but I dropped on for the digital download offered.

B007WFR1MQ|5.0|While not being anything particularly innovative from the Los Angelean industrial metal quartet (essentially a duo for the recording) this album is reminiscent of their earlier glory days with the blistering title track The Industrialist and its follow up the supercharged Recharger. The rest of the album takes on a more melodic approach even including some more electronics than their previous installment Mechanize. Meanwhile the extended story found in the lyric book provide a more complete image of what singer Burton Bell wishes to put to us. On the whole a very good metal album and an equally good Fear Factory album. A must have for any FF Fan and definitely worth spending your money on if you're a die hard metal head.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This is my first book by this author but it will not be my last(i have already purchased Dark Places)!  I was sucked in from the beginning and stayed up half the night to finish it.  I liked that it kept me guessing on what was gonna happen next.  Some books you can figure out what is going to happen and how it will end, not with this one.  Amy & Nick seem like the perfect couple but wow what secrets they both have.  This is a perfect summer read and you will not be able to put it down!
B007SPN5MA|5.0|When Once burst onto the scene, I was captivated by this Irishman, as were many.  I love the movie soundtrack and checked out some of his earlier work with The Frames.<br /><br />I would have to say Hansard up till now has seemed like a powder keg, often on the verge of rage, and often his singing would dissolve into helpless waves of emotion.<br /><br />Rhythm and Repose shows us a solo Glen Hansard (with accomplished backup singers including Marketa Irglova and her Broadway doppelganger Cristin Milioti), and he is a revelation.  As another reviewer has said, more repose than rhythm.  He is quiet, thoughtful.  The lyrics on this CD are some of his best ever.<br /><br />My particular favorite, a song I listen to over and over, is Maybe Not Tonight.  This song reminds me of a '70s American rock ballad, as sung by Bob Seger maybe, or the Doobie Brothers.  It's about that point in a relationship when you realize you need to break up but are not ready to give it up yet.  It's such a pretty tune and the lyrics just tug at my heart.  It's tempting to conclude this song refers to his relationship with Marketa Irglova but I wouldn't presume to know the man well enough to say that.  The song Races is also about a relationship that goes on even after the romantic part ends.<br /><br />In general there is more hope in the songs on this CD than in some of Hansard's earlier work.  Earlier songs like Leave and When Your Mind's Made Up were defiant and closed-off:  go ahead, leave, I'm not going to try to change your mind, I'll be fine, get out of here.  It's refreshing and heartening that Hansard's lyrics on this CD are more reflective and able to see the positive in a situation.  It makes him more vulnerable, to open himself up to the possibilities he sees in the future, and it also makes him more eloquent.<br /><br />There is one song on this CD that makes me a little crazy, and that is Philander.  I guess it is about a guy who knows his girl friend is cheating on him and he isfine with that.  Is it tongue in cheek?  Is it sarcastic?  Is it vaguely threatening?  The song just bugs me - but not enough to detract from the 5-star rating.<br /><br />Hansard gets a little growly sometimes which is fine.  That's his trademark.  But he also shows on this CD that he is capable of growing musically and lyrically.  The musical arrangements are more ambitious, and the lyrics are definitely richer.  I am listening to this one over and over.  Every time I hear something different.  A different song grabs me, or I hear something new in his voice.  I just really love it.  To my mind, it's his best work so far.

1936608898|4.0|As has been said, the first half of this book covers the \\"why\\" behind the Whole30. As someone who has read the Whole9 blog for a long time, I found the first half of the book very interesting. It goes into more detail about hormones, how daily food effects them, the four factors Whole9 considers for a certain food, \\"food with no brakes,\\" and other more in-depth \\"whys.\\" (I found their take on the \\"is red wine good for you\\" question especially interesting).<br /><br />The second half of the book is the \\"how to do a Whole30\\" part. Since I'd already done multiple Whole30s (and learned tons about myself and food; I highly recommend the Whole30) I skimmed this part pretty fast.<br /><br />I have bought multiple copies of the book and given them to people who are brand new to the Whole30; I'm now getting positive comments back from them. So I think the book is good in entirety for newbies and someone familiar with Whole9 and their Whole30 can still get some good new information from the book.

B00571F26Y|4.0|This book was very enlightening. Coming from a mother of 3, to include 2 children with thyroid disease and I have thyroid disease. After reading this book and employing the of wheat in addition to dairy, soy, has finally had an impact on my children and myself. We all have lost 10 lbs, which did not happen trying to various, and I mean various diet plans. This was very enlightening to me as to what is happening to our food supply in general. It made me just sick to go to the grocery store initially and realizing by reading alot of food lables, how much stuff has that evil wheat in it. Great book for anyone that has tried everything else. Lots of techinal talk at times, but doesn't detract from the information.

B007Y1JGOY|4.0|This one was a long time coming. In fact, this album was originally slated for release in March of 2012, but issues with band's label forced the album into questionable territory. Long story short: Delain's label was recently purchased by Warner Bros.' music division. Since the new label doesn't really \\"get\\" metal, Delain's new album was put on hold until the execs could figure out what they wanted to do with the band. After dealing with (I'm sure) torrents of political crap, Delain announced earlier this year that they had moved to a new label, and their new album, We Are the Others, would be released, finally, in June 2012.<br /><br />And it was well worth the wait for Delain fans.<br /><br />We Are the Others, along with the title song, is inspired by the 2007 hate crime against Sophie Lancaster, a young British girl and identified member of the goth subculture. Sophie and her boyfriend were brutally attacked in a park in Lancashire, UK by a group of young men. After being rushed to the hospital in critical condition, Sophie's boyfriend survived. Sophie did not. It was later determined that Sophie was attacked, and ultimately murdered, purely because of her unique appearance. We Are the Others stands as a memorial to Sophie and as a call for acceptance for those of any unique \\"subculture\\" or anyone who is just a little different from the norm.<br /><br />Seemingly built on the central message of acceptance, many of the songs on this album revolve around those ideas, such as \\"Mother Machine,\\" \\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot,\\"<br /><br />\\"Not Enough\\" and title song \\"We Are the Others.\\" For me, the real stand out song on this album is \\"We Are the Others,\\" a powerful anthem for anyone who doesn't fit the with \\"in\\" crowd that celebrates acceptance. \\"Mother Machine\\" is an unique track with heavy guitars and a gorgeous string bridge. Though it came across as somewhat sinister, I enjoyed the heavier sound and the industrial/mechanical influences. \\"Not Enough,\\" though a little on the lighter side, probably brings home the album's main themes the best, while \\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot,\\" in its surprisingly snyth-y glory, encourages those who have been bullied or hurt to be strong.<br /><br />I was a little surprised at the lyrical inconsistency when it came to themes. Since this album was so strongly grounded in such a horrible tragedy (and such a strong central message), I expected virtually the entire album to flow from that, but that's not what happened. That's an almost odd variety of themes here, ranging from acceptance to lost love, romantic obsession and romantic conflict. I really would have liked to have seen the album centered more on the acceptance themes, it would have added some cohesion and made the overall album stronger.<br /><br />But that doesn't mean that the album was a bust past those four song. In fact, far from it. We Are the Others offers some haunting songs wrapped with catchy hooks, a shocking amount of snyth, the occasional orchestral section, heavier guitars and the most amazing vocals lead singer Charlotte Wessels has ever delivered. For me, highlights included: \\"Generation Me,\\" \\"Get the Devil Out of Me,\\" and \\"Are You Done With Me?\\" \\"Generation Me\\" offers some interesting commentary on social media, modern Internet narcissism and the concept of an online \\"persona while the super-catchy \\"Get the Devil Out of Me\\" takes Delain's signature lighter approach to symphonic rock with a bit of that rock edge. \\"Are You Done With Me?\\" actually threw me off at first with its super poppy and radio-friendly feel, but it grew on me after a while. I blame it on the incredible vocal work. Charlotte jumps effortlessly between notes and between genres on the chorus, and it's both haunting and beautiful.<br /><br />Overall, We Are the Others completely \\"fixed\\" all of the issues I had with April Rain. The songs are more polished, they don't feel over thought or overwrought and the overall direction is clearer. While the band didstick to the lighter side of the genre, the guitars were heavier than on April Rain, there seemed to be more snyth and less use of the orchestral aspect of the genre (and there's even a childrens' choir on \\"We Are the Others\\"). And Charlotte is incredible here. Her voice shines on every track with its brilliant range and amazing power -truly her best performance thus far.<br /><br />On the whole, We Are the Others is a much stronger album than April Rain. Yet, there is still room for improvement. Some of the songs started to run together, and I personally would like to see a more expanded use of the orchestra and greater thematic consistency, but that's really a personal preference.<br /><br />Delain's latest album is worth the wait for fans, and I'm excited to see what this band does in the future.

0345803493|1.0|I don't know why I gave the second book a shot after not really liking the first one. Their relationship doesn't seem sexy to me, it's actually kind of boring and gross. I'll probably skip the third one altogether because honestly i don't get why everyone is so crazy about this book.
B004O3YGMC|2.0|Since last update, connection to desktop is very irresponsive and slow. Haven't found a way to fix it yet. Will go back to log me in.
B0086700CM|5.0|very easy to learn and so fun to play. you will get stuck in it trying to top your best!!!
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is helpful and a bit more accurate than the other app I frequent.  I like the 15 day extended forecast feature even when it doesn't always come true but you have to expect that due to the unpredictably of mother nature.
B007VTVG4C|5.0|simple and sa·li·ent review. just saying.<br /><br />i'm a huge fiona apple fan and have been since she released her first album.  it's dark and gritty and at times very playful and optimistic.  that sounds stupid but if you're a fan you know what i'm saying.  i have an ok system and this sounds pretty good on it, assuming it would sound better on a high end system.  the vinyl album also comes with an mp3 code so you can dload it to your computer or mp3 player free.  give it a listen.<br /><br />imo this is some of her strongest music to date.  gonna see her in chicago in a few days!  woot. ;)
B006LSZECO|4.0|First of all, no spoilers here, so don't worry. I found Gone Girl to be very engrossing; like others said, the first part was a little slow for me, but once Part 2 started, I couldn't put it down. There were so many plot twists, and the way the story alternates between the husband and the wife's points of views, leaving you on a cliffhanger with each change of narrator, really keeps you reading. The author is very good at pulling you in, manipulating your emotions towards each character (which will change a few times throughout the novel).<br /><br />The only reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is because I found the ending to be very unsatisfying. I also found the novel as a whole to be incredibly dark, almost depressing. That would've been easier to deal with if it had ended in a satisfying manner, but to me it left something to be desired. I would've liked a more emotionally satisfying ending, and I'd like to have heard more about what happened to all of the characters (not just the main ones but the supporting cast also). Still, it's a pretty riveting read that will suck you in as you get deeper into it and I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery!
B0072GPQ72|5.0|This is one of the best movies i've seen this year. war horse is absoulutly an amazing film directed by an amazing director. i was not expecting this movie to be as good as it was. stupid be for doubting steven spielberg. all his movies are amazing. the story, the actors, the animals were all outstanding. i can't say nothing but good things about this film. so i'm going to quit here. if you have not seen this movie then i really recommend you do
B003Y5H5B0|4.0|I had the movie ready to watch then heard it was just okay, but I really needed a good laugh, so I gave it a try. And awesome! Laugh out loud funny. Sure, there was raunch, bad language, and male anatomy banter. Not to mention this movie is nothing like the original series, but I can't remember laughing out loud when I watched all the H.S. undercover angst ridden takedowns back in the day. If you go for this style of comedy, and you accept this is not a modern day installment of the moody Johnny Depp show, then have some fun and watch the movie.
B005FITILO|4.0|This movie was better than i thought it would be. i thought that it was kinda funny. i was surprised to see patton oswalt in this movie. i thought he was pretty good. i still like him from king of queens. charlize theron was excellent playing a stalker ex girlfriend that was pretty funny. i think this movie has a little truth into it. about ex's stalking there ex's. but all in all this movie was pretty good. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
B005YVTHT0|5.0|Great Steering wheel. Small and compact so it is easy to put in my Laptop bag and take along. Works perfect in SimRaceway and easily configures to other games like Shift2, ACR, Driver SF, iRacing, etc. Would love to have force feedback, but the it would be to heavy to hold in you hand. Its a great steering wheel that is both inexpensive and portable. Just what I have been wanting for a long time. WIll not go back to a controller again for racing.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love cut the rope because it keeps you entertained. I think that this game is worth the money but this is all just my opinion. Thank you to the person who made this game!!!
B0052VUNHC|1.0|I really don't understand how this got 4 stars.  I bought it after reading the reviews and was hugely disappointed.  The characters were not only unlikable but so annoying that i could hardly finish the book.  There was nothing charming about this love story...
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I really like this game (s) cause it is so fun! I love it and play it almost every split -second. I recommend you try it if you like Temple Run and Monster Park.
B005XBA9Y8|4.0|I have received this set from Amazon and have listened with particular interest in trying to figure out what makes these recordings different.  The set contains many performances -- some great, none less than good -- from core repertoire.  Then there's the other \\"stuff\\" that is less interesting to me -- Civil War (2 discs), Flamenco guitar, and a lot of Band stuff from Fennell.  But my main interest is \\"Why does the orchestra sound different in these recordings than others contemporary with the times?\\" (i.e. early stereo era -- 1960's)<br /><br />I believe I have an idea how this Living Presence came to be.  The Mercury Team used three microphones -- so did RCA.  But the difference seems to be that Mercury used the middle mike for stereo purposes whereas RCA's engineers referred to that mike as the \\"mono mike\\" (from which they presumably mastered the parallel mono version of the recording).  Many years ago I had lunch with Dr. Harvey Fletcher -- generally credited with both bringing sound to the world of physics AND the invention of stereophonic sound.  He told us (six of us around a lunch table) that they had shown empirically (back in the '30's) that the stereo effect was best achieved with three channels.  He insisted that two channels was not stereo but binaural.<br /><br />I believe what the Mercury team did was to take more care with that center channel and thus produced recordings that were so carefully balanced with that channel that they were able to produce a more accurate virtual center channel for our standard two channel world.  By doing so, they brought a greater focus to the center of the orchestra where the woodwinds live.  The term \\"presence\\" in the sound world has generally meant more mid-range.  Some early stereo equipment had standard treble and bass controls but then had a \\"presence\\" control between them which was intended to control the mid frequencies.  By more carefully recording the center channel there really is more presence than we're used to because the center of the orchestra comes into clearer focus and does not wander around the sound stage.<br /><br />Thus these Mercury (orchestral) recordings have a more natural stereo spread, as well.  It is not a case where the violins are crammed into the left speaker while the trumpets and basses are crammed into the right.  If the concertmaster plays a solo within the piece, he comes from just right of center -- right where the sound should originate.  This is not the case with many recordings.  Mercury got it right.  The middle mike was not treated as \\"the mono mike\\" but rather as the center channel -- exactly like Dr. Fletcher described to us around that lunch table years ago.<br /><br />So the bottom line is that these recordings ARE special because they (1) focus the center of the orchestra and by doing so (2) they increase the \\"warmth\\" (i.e. mid-range) and create a much more intimate sound -- more like the conductor would hear on the podium.  I didn't buy many of them back in the '60's but I am very pleased to now have them and know what I was missing.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />PS:  4 stars only because there are too many novelty discs in this set that have nothing to do with the core classical repertoire.<br /><br />PPS:  Ironically, the \\"Living Presence\\" moniker actually was born during the late mono era.  But I think it describes their stereo results perfectly.d to because the center of the orchestra comes into clearer focus and does not wander around the sound stage.<br /><br />Thus these Mercury (orchestral) recordings have a more natural stereo spread, as well.

B003O86FMW|3.0|I loved this book, well written. But the storyline was SO predictable! From Katniss winning the games even down to Peeta losing his leg, very predictable but enjoyable story
0143119680|5.0|I was aware that this book earned a lot of praise when it was published last year. But on a limited income, I decided to wait and finally was rewarded when it was offered as a Kindle discounted book. Well worth the wait!<br /><br />Diana and Matthew may be the basic modern fictional couple... a witch and a vampire, but they are adults, not teenagers. They are both accomplished and she is every bit the intellectual scholar that he is, though 1,400 years younger. She does reject her magic, but you'll have to read the book to find the reasons for that. They don't jump into having sex, but they do have sensual encounters. Nice build up.<br /><br />It is a step above even the better Paranormal Romances like the Southern Vampire Mysteries and the Night Huntress series.<br />Twilight? I could only bear to read the first volume.<br /><br />In A Discovery of Witches the writing is excellent. Each character has depth and personality. The descriptions of the places, food, and wine are thoughtful. I didn't think they took away from the book, but added to my imagination. There's not an excess of adjectives, or descriptions of minuscule things. There is such intelligence and good humor behind the writing, I'm tempted to sit on Ms Harkness' doorstep until she asks me in for a cup of tea.<br /><br />I hope the second book will be offered at a discounted price also. I've finished this one just in time.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|From the very beginning, the language of the book is stilted and unconvincing. The author writes about places she has no idea about, and uses cliches without thinking about what they mean. If you \\"floor the pedal to the metal\\" (an incorrect cliche, even) in a Mercedes CLK, you're going to be going so fast the world would blur, not just be cruising down a major highway. She also uses the phrase \\"terminal velocity\\" when referring to an elevator...<br /><br />Every sentiment is repeated twice per paragraph, just incase you didn't understand the childish descriptions the first time around. Another reviewer has already done the amusing task of counting the number of blushes, flushes and rolling eyes. I cannot believe that this is where literature has digressed to, that this trash is now a best seller. Please people, have some self-respect and get your erotica somewhere else!!!
B007KZY1YY|1.0|I wish I had borrowed my friend's hard copy instead of buying this book on her recommendation. Don't waste your money unless you have a hankering for sordid sex descriptions and no story. The Black Brotherhood series are more believable than this rot and FSOG is based on characters supposed to be human?? The story started off OK but quickly sank to rock bottom and never surfaced again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator works great. I love it. And it is easy to use. That's all you really need, isn't it.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This series would have been so much better, had the author stuck to 'Vanilla sex'.  (I only read the series because my Book Club did.)  The S&M was so over the top (especially in the first book), that I began skimming it halfway through the first book.  She also used many of the same words and phrases over and over and over and over and over again. (Monotonous, eh??) It did NOT live up to all the hype.
B006R8GK2Q|5.0|Lots of HOS to play so far. Moves well and the story is interesting. I would recommend for HOG fans.  I like these G5 games.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoyed playingthis app on my kindle fire and I can playito my computer but boron here until I gotthis app. I think that if you like to play spider solitaire on you're computer that you will like this app.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really love this game! it reminds me of when I was in elementary school and we played the original Oregon trail.
B001CZVVW8|4.0|This is a very fine performance and recording of what must be described as rather a minimalist production which, on its own terms, must also be considered a success. To elaborate further therefore ......<br /><br />The cast chosen for this production is unquestioningly top quality throughout and it delivers similar high quality performances in depth. The title role of Onegin perfectly suits the handsome and impressive Dmitri Hvorostovsky whose rich voice and generally restrained bearing underlines Onegin's own perceived role in society. The Russian timbre of his voice also adds considerable veracity to this role. In this respect he is in good company within the cast. Olga, sung by Elena Zaremba, Tatiana's nurse, sung by Larisa Shevchenko, Tatiana's mother sung by Svetlana Volkova and the impressively Russian timbred Serei Aleksashkin as Prince Gremin, all share these tonal advantages. All the above listed singers are clearly equally immersed in their respective roles and the production benefits accordingly.<br /><br />Ren&eacute;e Fleming is a perfect Tatiana and brings the necessary appearance of youth combined with her later social sophistication effortlessly to the role. Her voice is as beautiful as her acting is beyond reproach. The role of Lenski suits the sustained lyrical abilities of Ram&oacute;n Vargas which culminates in arguably one of his finest moments at the beginning of Act 2 scene 2 in his lengthy aria just prior to the fatal duel. This justifiably earns a considerable ovation from the very appreciative audience.<br /><br />The orchestra play to their normal high standard under the sure direction of Gergiev who clearly knows this score inside out.<br /><br />The production is one of the minimalist variety where the intention appears to be to focus the audience's attention on the personal dramas rather than the settings. To this extent it succeeds very well and suits the intention of the libretto based largely on Pushkin's creation. As Tchaikovsky himself commented in a letter to his future benefactress Nadezhda von Meck on 27 May 1877, `The opera will have no strong dramatic action, but the portrayal of everyday life will be interesting, and how full of poetry it all is.' Nevertheless there will be those who will regret the lack of opulence in the ballroom scenes which can be spectacular in other productions.<br /><br />There are the usual interviews and introductions typical of these Met recordings plus a short film giving an interesting glimpse of rehearsal moments which reinforce expectations rather than casting any new light as regards understanding this opera. The booklet is usefully informative.<br /><br />The imaging is crisp and the camera work is involving. The close-up shots during the ballroom scenes help to suggest a greater scale of event than is actually the case on stage! The sound is presented in excellent DTS 5.1 and stereo.<br /><br />This is a quality production which should give plenty of pleasure and satisfaction to most purchasers. Within the context of the somewhat minimalist chosen production values it seems reasonable to rate this as a convincing disc although there will be many who will regret the lack of scenic scale, most obviously at points such as the ballroom scene where it can easily be argued that too much has to be left to the imagination.<br /><br />...........................................<br /><br />A response to a previous voter of this review:<br /><br />Goodness knows what you find to be unhelpful about this review<br /><br />The voting system is specifically only about reviews being 'helpful' or 'unhelpful'<br />A negative vote without reason is not helpful to anyone. It does not contribute in any useful way to discussion so no-one can learn from you.<br /><br />If you have a different view or find the review 'unhelpful' then explain, giving your reasons, and share your views in the comment option as intended.<br /><br />Your opinion might then add to the total usefuladvice.

B004DIPL3Q|5.0|Lorin Maazel considered requests to create a synthesis of Wagner's Ring cycle as a continuous `Ring without Words' twice before finally agreeing to the request made by the recording company, Telarc, in 1987. The resultant 75 minute recording proved to be a big seller and in Maazel's opinion it helped to create a new audience for the operas.<br /><br />In creating this continuous synthesis Maazel attempted to produce a reduced version which followed strict chronological order and which introduced all the main themes and motifs without adding a single note not written by Wagner. In this he reinforced Wieland Wagner's view (Wagner's Grandson) that the essence of the work lies in the orchestral score.<br /><br />Weiland Wagner's view is worth considering in this context and can be quoted as stated to Maazel at a rehearsal of the Ring as `The orchestra, that's where it all is - the text behind the text, the universal subconscious that binds Wagner's personae one to another and to the proto-ego of legend ....'<br /><br />As one who has known The Ring cycle for around 40 years or so this synthesis is both impressive and intriguing. It is also successful in terms of what was attempted as in paragraphs 1-2 above. It is impressive because it covers so many of the key moments and intriguing because it jumps unexpectedly from one key point to another without including what you would expect to hear next! It becomes a sort of quiz - spot the excerpt, and a rather enjoyable one too!<br /><br />The whole experience is enormously enhanced by the wonderful playing of the Berlin Philharmonic at full strength. Four harps is an impressive sight not to mention vast ranks of strings and incisively burnished brass. If ever an orchestra was born to play this music it has to be this one. The visual impact provides a real advantage over audio only reproduction.<br /><br />In terms of reproduction, this early example of high definition recording from 2000 is a complete success with crisp imaging of considerable clarity and fully involving camera work. The sound is wide ranging and presented in DTS-HD 5.1 as well as stereo. There is a short bonus in which Maazel says much of what is relayed above and which is even more fully covered in the sleeve notes.<br /><br />As a keen Wagner Ring enthusiast, I still found this a very enjoyable experience for all the reasons above. I would expect it to give much pleasure to all but the most hardened of purists and, in addition, it might be a very useful way of getting to know the basics of the opera cycle as an introduction in miniature so to speak. For all the above reasons therefore, and in my own personal opinion, it seems only reasonable to rate this as a 5 star issue.ng of considerable clarity and fully involving camera work.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|Love the game so far. well put together and decent graphics. Would suggest it for all ages. Easy to pick up.
0307887448|5.0|I confess: I steered clear of this book for a long time because the title made me think that its subject matter - i.e. gaming - would be something in which I am not well-versed.  Then, something interesting happened - I started seeing lots of different people pick up a copy, and it seemed to transcend all of the usual boundaries, in that both men and women and everyone from teens to grandparents seemed to be gravitating toward it.  This all culminated in a woman coming up to me and telling me how her daughter had urged her to read it.  She couldn't stop raving about it, so I finally picked up a copy.  And now I can definitely see what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />The most important thing for prospective readers to know is that you don't have to be a gamer to enjoy this.  It's true that gaming receives a lot of focus, but it's all explained in such a matter-of-fact way that nothing goes over your head, nor does the material become too bogged down in technical jargon.<br /><br />Since there have already been so many reviews about the book's plot, I'll mostly stick to more general impressions about the content and characters.  In regard to the latter, Wade is a great main character: he is a normal, 18-year-old boy who happens to be absolutely brilliant when it comes to gaming and seemingly all things technology-related.  He's witty and a little angsty; he makes mistakes, but he also makes grand, heroic gestures, and everything is backed up with a staggering amount of knowledge and smarts.  His relationships and friendships with the supporting players all begin and/or develop naturally, and I think Mr. Cline did a wonderful job of keeping his characterizations grounded in reality even as their lives were immersed almost entirely in virtual reality.  When it comes to the big bad of the piece, he could have been a cartoony, mustache-twirling, cardboard cutout kind of villain, but he was actually quite cold and menacing, which is made all the more potent because he,too, is operating with a lot of intelligence.<br /><br />As great as they are, though, the characters are not the star of the show, the virtual reality is.  It was described in such expansive, even jaw-dropping detail; considering we're talking about innumerable planets, structures, puzzles, combat scenarios, and the like, it could easily have gotten bogged down in the details.  I see that some other reviewers found that to be the case, but for me, it all served the purpose of bringing each of these aspects of the virtual reality game to life, and I think Cline succeeded brilliantly at that world-building, too.<br /><br />On top of that, the reader gets treated to myriad references to all things from the 1980's - so many TV shows, movies, songs, and of course, games are mentioned and it becomes so much nostalgic fun to read about all of it.  Granted, I was born in the early part of that decade, so some of the references weren't entirely familiar to me, but then he would mention things like Family Ties, the Commodore 64, Max Headroom, Bladerunner and Indiana Jones, Ferris Bueller and WarGames, \\"Wake Me Up Before You Go Go,\\" and Zork (my older sister was *obsessed* with those games), and I was transported right back to my childhood.<br /><br />Plus, he referenced the Firefly universe being created adjacent to those of Star Wars and Star Trek.  After reading that near the beginning of the book, I was hooked, courtesy of my deep and abiding love of Firefly.  Cline paid homage to umpteen pop culture references, both from the past and even some from present-day, and he did so with great inventiveness and wit.<br /><br />Though the book may be a lot of fun, that is not to say that it doesn't include elements that are dark and/or highly emotional, like murder, corporate greed and corruption, first love and first heartbreak, and even an epic battle.  It also contains a sort of cautionary message about escapism, i.e. how a little can be a good thing, and can lead to inspiration and creativity, but how, like any number of other subjects and pastimes, too much of a good thing can start to be harmful when it results in people willfully abandoning reality in ever-increasing amounts.  The book tackled this thought head-on and literally, but not in a ham-fisted way, which held true for all of those other less light-hearted themes, as well.<br /><br />In short (which is ironic, given the length of this review), then, Cline was able to deftly juggle both fun and heavy subjects and situations, and in doing so, he created one of the most purely entertaining, wholly creative books that I've had the pleasure of reading in a long time.  I would urge people who might find themselves hesitant to pick this one up (like I was) to give it a try - you'll be glad you did.
B007V508CC|4.0|I think this album shows that Maroon 5 continues to surprise listeners everytime.  Although this album is slightly more \\"clubby\\", the lyrics and melodies are still catchy.  It's not my favorite album ever, but I still really enjoy listening to it.
B0049D1TCM|1.0|Blasphemy. The so-called Hip Hop that's been released in the last 10 to 15 years is absolutely terrible. Nicki Minaj is a terrible MC and how she became a sex symbol...Wtf. If it wasn't for those fake tits she'd have an A cup with a cartoon like giant ass. Biggy, 2pac, Jam Master Jay, Big L, ODB, Eazy E and MCA are spinning in their graves over this broad, Drake and that sorry ass Lil Wayne and that moron Kanye West. Hip Hop used to mean something, it spoke of life for the poor, politics and a MAN'S view of relationships. This so called music reminds of the early 60s and sorry singers like Bobby Rydell, Frankie Avalon and Fabian. All looks and no substance trying pass of as music. This generations' style sucks, your fashion sucks, your music sucks and everything you stand for sucks. Once again the big corporations get a hold of something and screw it all up. Sad! Gotta give a star cuz they make you---she deserves minus 5 stars.
B007SGM084|5.0|It was so different from other books that I've read, and it felt wrong reading it.<br />But there was no way I could stop, I had to keep reading. Great trilogy!
0345803485|5.0|It's an interesting read,it is certainly not run of the mill.  If you don't care for explicit sexual activity, don't read this.
B00785P2QC|4.0|love it.  really like the Sims game.  for a free app it offers a lot.  I would recommend the download versus a lot of other games.

0099579936|5.0|This book, actually series, exceeded my expectations and more. I love how it dabbled into the BDSM lifestyle without censorship. I am not a huge romance gush, so the saucy moments made the books irrestible just as much as Christian Grey himself!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a fun game when your bored. :) cant get enough. I play it at least once a day on my kindle fire
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|this game is hours of fun.  I love all the levels. I like how you can keep playing until the whole puzzel is done.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|The first book is the best but I still gave this book a five star rating. I love the series and could not put down the book once I started reading it. Though the story is a bit crazy and depressed itself, still no hesitation to recommend to anyone who like reading.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|I play alot of hidden object games so I downloaded the full version of this. All was well and then the game froze on one screen over and over and wouldn't let me get passed it to continue. I tried reloading it w/o success.  I have the Kindle Fire version.
B0086700CM|4.0|Addictive, fun game. The graphics aren't amazing HD or anything, and the controls are a bit touchy. But 10 times out of 11, everything works great,and ot is always great to play. Highly recommended.<br />OH YEAH!! And it's free, too! So at least try it once.
B004KZDV8E|5.0|I recently built a HTPC and when I was looking for a CPU I was looking for something with power, but was also quiet.  I have this in a small HTPC with a SSD and Intel Motherboard.  It works like a charm and because it runs so cool it never gets to hot in the small area its in.  Gotta Love these Intel i's they are definitely worth the price.
0307594165|1.0|[CAUTION -- MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!]<br /><br />After loving \\"The Bluest Eye\\", \\"Song of Solomon\\", and \\"Beloved\\", Toni Morrison's \\"Home\\" was a colossal let down. Morrison is a great writer and I have huge respect for her because she has this ancient wisdom about life that was showcased so beautifully in those three books. But that was just completely absent here.<br /><br />The story is about a black Korean war veteran, who was said to come home and experience racism, and his sister, who was described as being \\"medically abused\\" and in need of rescue. Already that sounded like a fabulous plot, especially in the hands of a highly intelligent and gifted writer like Morrison. This also takes into account the moving poem that started the book off, which hinted to blacks being foreigners in the land of their birth because of racism: \\"...why does this lock fit my [house]key?\\"<br /><br />But after I finished the book, I wondered what was even her point of writing it: there was no racism experienced by the main character, not even subtly--what was his conflict? Ultimately he seemed like a caricature of what we all believe a war-torn veteran is. And though his sister was a victim of a eugenics doctor, even that victimization had no point to it--one would expect Toni Morrison to sensitively and powerfully delve into this part of America's racial history. She then brought up, almost sloppily and as an after-thought, this idea that whites had a fighting club where they forced blacks to fight each other to the death. For anyone who watched the movie \\"Mandingo\\", these \\"fighting blacks\\" were also featured, fighting in a gruesome and savage display for their slave-holders. Again, Morrison could have also crafted something powerful about this historical fact, especially since she implied that father and son were inhumanely pitted against one another. But nothing further was even said about the subject.<br /><br />Perhaps \\"Home\\" suffered from extreme brevity when considering the fact itdealt with numerous heavy topics (post-traumatic stress, eugenics abuses, black objectification). I believe if Morrison would have added about 150 to 200 pages to the book, it would have been a much better work.<br /><br />Additionally, the book also suffered from bad prose. The other books from Morrison that I'd read were beautifully written: she wrote incredible opening sentences to every chapter that had a way of hooking you right in; she had a keen, wise realistic eye... her works were simply magic. This book seemed like the choppy, dull prose that characterizes so much of today's literary fiction--it's just downright yucky. I was hoping to read 1970s-1980s Toni Morrison, but she wasn't there.<br /><br />\\"Home\\" was a failure--so many missed opportunities! Not recommended. Re-read \\"The Bluest Eye\\" or \\"Sula\\" if you want novella-length, high quality, vintage Toni Morrison.

B00004SVIK|5.0|I would recommend this to any Floyd fan. If you care about more than just hearing the songs you remember, and want to dig even deeper into the experience of The Wall; then you will not regret this purchase.  Knowing where the inspiration came from and the commentary alone is worth the money.  The quality and music that are unavailable in the original studio album are incredible.  I LOVE IT.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I downloaded Spider a few days ago and I love it.  You just tap on a card and it flies off where it should go.  If you like card games in general then you'll love this one.  It's easy to learn...I didn't even read any \\"how tos\\" for this game.  MobilityWare is a master at card games.
0316056863|3.0|Tina Fey is talented and funny. No doubt about that. It's an auto-biography in the form of a lot of self-deprecating jokes. It's funny for sure. It's not a story though. It's more like punchline after punchline. For me it was hard to read too many pages at once because it's not a continuous thread of a story. It's still good though. And, funny.<br /><br />One point seven five thumbs up.
0802130208|1.0|I can honestly say that I don't understand what the other reviewers who give this high marks see in it, especially when they call those who don't like it \\"humor-impaired\\".  Ignatius is pompous, narcissistic, and boorish, but just having those qualities doesn't make him funny - an author has to do something with a character like that, and Toole doesn't (at least through the first half, after which I gave up because it just got too boring).  He and his mother are much like the characters on Desperate Housewives: having no redeeming qualities that might inspire even a slight bit of sympathy or relating, yet not evil or noxious enough to generate antipathy and interest to see how they might meet some kind of downfall.  Instead you just wish they'd go away and stop bothering you.  But then, I guess there are people who like Desperate Housewives too.
0439023521|5.0|Let me tell you a crazy story -- my friend told me to read this book. I read the synopsis and thought 'who wants to read a book about teens killing other teens? what is this world coming to?' Then, my brother lent me the book and it sat on my desk for 2 months. Then, I traveled in other countries for 45 days straight with this book in my backpack thinking I \\"might\\" read it if I get bored or am on a long train ride. I never read it, and in fact during my travels I tried to trade it for something else with another backpacker. They didn't want it. So it came back with me, roundtrip, after seeing parts of Asia.<br /><br />Three weeks ago, on a rainy day, I was bored and I thought let's see what the hype is about. I was sure I would put it down after 4-5 pages.  Sixteen hours later I had finished the book. During that time, I barely looked up and engaged only in the most minimal human interactions and attended to the most minimal bodily needs!<br /><br />This is maybe the BEST book I have ever read. I laughed, I cried, I stressed, I sweated, I smiled, I held my breath, I sighed with relief. It's so exciting, thrilling and yet so emotional. I have rarely been swept in this way by a book. For the next 3-4 days all I could do was think about the book -- while walking, while working, while eating, etc. I kept remembering the scenes and the dialogue.<br /><br />There are like a million reviews on Amazon for this book, so my review means nothing probably. But, if you are reading it, I highly recommend this book and the series -- get it, read it, feel it, and read the 2nd one right after and then the third. And then pray that the author makes another series that will rock so hard that it will knock the bow and arrow out of Katniss Everdeen's grip.<br /><br />If I could marry a book, this one would definitely be a contender in the finals. Three thumbs up, plus a bonus gold star!
B007VLHP9K|2.0|I owned the 8th symphony on VHS, but I did away with my VCR more than ten years ago. It was a long wait for these recordings to appear on DVD. I was initially disappointed that these are not on blu ray (Euroarts released one Celibidache/Bruckner with the Berliner on blu ray). After watching these DVD's I know why. The picture quality is horrible and not worthy an amateur VHS release. I assume that it is the source material that was bad. It is a pity that many (legendary) concerts taped for TV in the eighties and nineties were done with inferior video equipment. If you want to have Bruckner with Celibidache, stick to the EMI cd box.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Again, I'm doing a full series review. Boy, this is a mighty mighty series. Un-put-down-able. Non-stop action. Good character development. I was there right beside Percy jackson in each book. That's how good the story-telling and description were. Fantastic. It is just as good as the Harry Potter series in terms of storyline, storytelling, characters, etc. Rick Riordan is a fantastic writer. I can't recommend this enough -- again for people of all ages. If you are young at heart then no one is too old for this series! Three thumbs up.
