B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the collection. I can see why she wrote it for her kids. She brings the war close to home and the horrors people live but in a way that young teens can understand it. Has no political incline just common sense!
0812550706|2.0|I wanted to like the Ender's Game. I was really trying. But though this book gets so many positive ratings, I was disappointed. First off, let me mention that I'm not really a big sci-fi fan or anything; I was assigned the book as a class project recently. I found it very hard to keep track of what was going on. At times it was indeed interesting, but i found that my attention would no longer be on the book after a while. It was boring to read at times, and I do not recommend this book for children probably 14 and under. I felt like I was reading all of these pages, and nothing was really happening. And behind the characters, there were no personalities you were really getting to know or any background other than good character and bad character. I expected way more from this book, and I just want to let everyone know that if you're setting high expectations for this book, you might have a hard time reading it. (By the way, I quit before I got the ending, so I have no opinion on the ending)
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|very addicting game. haven't been able to put it down since I downloaded it. I recommend it for casual time burning.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|very fun game that is similar to temple run but is a better game in my opinion - try it out!
B001UAX56A|5.0|Lauren Hill is a classic.  Even if she never did another album i would love her still.  I remember this album when it came out.  It was great then and now.
0062082353|5.0|Loved the stories he told....he had decisions to make that separated him from his family for months.  Appreciated the comments by wife, Taya, and the struggles she had to maintain a home and kids.  Kudos to her....the story of how the Muslims sent a small boy to retrieve a RPG (I believe), and he could not shoot him.  He showed compassion for a small child even tho he was the enemy.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Everyone in my home loves to play this.  And it actually goes along with the scenes in the movie.  I love all the Temple Run games.
B0044C3RB4|5.0|Came to it late and am enjoying working my way through the seasons. Hope another one comes along that I can love.
B004RRVHCW|5.0|Thurston does it again!  Co-produced by Beck, this album is beautiful, filled with soft drums and lovely string arrangements for guitar, cello, double bass, and more.  Quite lovely to listen to!
B0089EHWQE|5.0|Definitely a book to read! I read this for my book club and thought it was fantastic!!! A man becomes a quadriplegic and has many decisions to make, including his death. Despite his family's reservations he uses his best judgement to make a decision everyone can accept.
0894803123|1.0|I dont' think these are the same recipes that ben and jerry's use. They call for raw eggs which a professional company would NEVER use because of the food born illness liability. I was very disappointed with this purchase.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|You can't watch one episode, be prepared.  Excellent plots, all characters are involved.  Costuming is outstanding and superior settings and camera shots
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|When I watch movies set in the middle ages, otherwise known as &#34;A thousand years without a bath&#34;, I can't help but note the unreality of the fresh scrubbed and well groomed actors in their well groomed sets.<br />This series comes closer than anything I've seen in depicting the stinking, filthy, nasty, squalid conditions of the period. And that's just the people. They have done a great job in incorporating period accounts of the vikings and their brit contemporaries in the sets and the story line.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app was a great deal for free and I would have paid up to $5 for it otherwise. I would highly recommend you to get this.
B00899F0G8|5.0|I love this show, and how it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Every episode is like a roller-coaster ride. I would recommend it for anyone who likes suspense.
B0083IQFD2|5.0|Really, this is a hip hop masterpiece, I wish I could ask Azealia how does it feels to be the baddest bitch n the game
B0094M2ODQ|4.0|I like this movie because it about middle age people finding love and the beauty is within. There are not much movies nowadays like this, it's timeless just like any old movies. Its also has great humor and you see it when and where they fell in love. Well done!
143911000X|5.0|I bought this for my older brother and he loved it, most of what Is written is true and bros need to learn the code!
630514415X|5.0|A classic vision from a young Spike Lee and Denzel Washington.<br />Sure to touch anyone who appreciates these filmmakers and finds compassion<br />for the human experience!
0930289234|5.0|What can I say about Watchmen that hasn't been said in the one thousand + reviews already here? Well first of all, I have a confession: I saw the movie first. And I thought it was alright! Especially the Ultimate edition. And then I read the book. But, I read a digital version on my friend's computer and skipped over most of the tie-in content. And I still liked the movie better.<br /><br />But then I bought this, and it was a thrill to read. The first time, I went through it speedily, soaking up all the content I'd missed my first read-around. I'd definitely recommend getting a print version to a digital version, because there's so much going on with the page layout that you don't get reading digitally. Seems like a weird thing to say about a book with probably the most rigid panel structure I've read, but it's true. Even on a 3x3 grid, Gibbons and Moore managed to change it up just enough to reflect the mood of the current story arc. But it was subtle enough to make me feel like a comic analyzing genius.<br /><br />I read it again recently, this time after procuring a magnifying glass. I probably went overboard: scanning every panel for texts that foreshadowed what was to come (my favorite: \\"The Veidt Method: I can give you bodies beyond your wildest imaginings), flipping back and fourth through the symmetrical chapter, and making note of every recurring symbol and motif and hoping that I'd get assigned this book to read in a class one day and have to write an essay on it.<br /><br />Beyond that, it came in a nice condition and the binding is high-quality. The paper's glossy and there were some color strips on the edges of the pages at times, but I didn't mind at all.
B008I43DYU|3.0|The calculator does a nice job with basic and scientific calculations.  I was hoping it would be able to handle financial calculations such as amortization and time value of money.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved this book. I read it in one night amazing. It captured more than j could have asked for. A book on depression made me feel better about life
B00821OX98|5.0|My husband watched this not me and I guess he liked it ok because he watched all this season and season 2
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is challenging for me and it it fun to play.this game reminds of old magic people and things
B0040HERTY|5.0|So Bruce willis kills it once again. Die Hard movies just seem to keep getting batter and batter! this a family, date night, ect movie for all ages. can go wrong here guys
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I rated this book because I thought it was totally awesome!<br /><br />I liked this book because of the adventure behind it!
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|This book starts out VERY slow. There was a point where I almost stopped reading because it was just a typical TEENAGE romance and I'm 25 years old. DO NOT QUIT READING!!!! Trust me, everything falls into place and it FINALLY gets VERY interesting and has a deep, dark story that, although it's sad, makes for A pretty good read.
B00BWYX2MG|5.0|Spread this around the part of the glove that you'd use on the screen, dry with a hair dryer, apply a second coat, dry again, done.  I've used conductive thread on some gloves, and the buttons you stick on the tips, with usable but not great results.  This liquid makes the glove behave exactly like a finger.  Works perfectly every time.  I used a lot and it seems like I could do a bunch more gloves with the amount in the bottle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really fun game.I love how it always has goals to complete and then I do complete them and it is really fun knowing you can get boost and new character<br />And there is a lots and lots more.
B0050C863G|5.0|I've been doing the headspace program for about 8 months now.  The program has been nothing short of life changing for me.  I can't believe it took me this long to start living my life this way.  Anyway, I decided to read Andy's book to get a nice overview of his teachings.  I learn in a variety of ways, and reading works for me so I found the book useful.<br /><br />If you haven't tried the program I'd say the book is a good read, but you'll get more out of it if you've at least watched the videos on the headspace website and tried Take 10.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is one of my many favorites.<br />I like how Steven Chboskey didn't write it with the vocabulary words that people learn in English.<br />It made it a lot more realistic.<br />I would reccomend it for mature people 12 or older.<br />12 and older because I would not have understood this book when I was 11.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This book was fanciful, dream like, unique , pretty much unlike anything I've read before.  Yes it's a story about the pursuit of God but apart from that just a well done story. A dry humor throughout.
B000XNXM3Q|4.0|I like Beck's sound in general, and this is a great album.  Now I'm just filling out more words to meet the requirement to submit this.
B00B4VXQC8|4.0|I was warned ahead of time that this isn't the usual Bon Jovi album.  Very true.  Saw them  in concert before it came out. Good show.  Got the disc and it is sort of growing on me.  Richie is lacking for sure and I now no he won't be on the tour anymore.  It's more a Jon Bon Jovi Album.  Love Jon so I bought it.  It' s a pretty mellow version of them but not all bad if you expect mellow.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|The best album I've heard in years. Prog perfection,nay,CONfection! Beautiful and atmospheric song writing and musicianship on an extremely high level. Govan's guitar playing in particular is absolutely awesome, but all the instrumentalists shine here. I've bought copies for two of my friends and I will buy more! If you love prog in particular, or music in general, you need to own this album. Can't wait for a blue ray concert with this stuff. Hope Steve is working on that!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book - you won't want to put this book down.  Great read! Perfect summer book. Recommend this book to everyone

0375851569|3.0|It was a gift for a grand child. Good reading. A bit expensive. Could have been postage free as well
0385342071|5.0|Her books are always so fun to read. The author makes you forget what ever may be bothering you in your life, and transports you right into her characters lives.  Her characters are always a bit quirky and the main one usually a good intentioned disaster, which is what makes them such fun reads. This one is about a woman who is about to get married, loses her engagement ring and cell phone. But when she finds another cell phone thrown away in a trash bin, the craziness begins.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a really good game I would reccomend it for anyone who liked fun lasting fame's its somewhat. Like temple run but you don't turn your device you just swipe best thing ever I swear..
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|In my opinion, this was a great movie. I also feel that Daniel-Day Lewis did a phenomenal job portraying Lincoln. I highly recommend watching this if you enjoy history, or if you are a fan of Abraham Lincoln!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Had a good story line. Kept me turning the page to see what would happen next. Had a flow to the story.
B006IDG2T6|5.0|This theory of freewill is refreshing and awakening. It allows us to think differently about how we approach the series of events that unfold to become our past - our lives.
B007W1BLN0|5.0|I enjoy watching this movie The views and soundtrack are grate as well as the story line. I have seen it many times and plan to see it many more!!
0393327655|5.0|This guy holds nothing back! A wee bit hard on Islam - but I understand the stance he has taken. Keep a wide open mind when you read this one; and think critically.
B004ZGI2KK|4.0|This movie was a fun twist on the Red Riding Hood fairy tale. Good surprise ending and of course darker than the Kids story
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love BONES! I have never been disappointed! The chemistry between these two and the cast is always a pleasure to watch.
B00881PTRC|5.0|I just love the creativity of the character. Very original and looking forward to more updates. Now make one with hints.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I'm 11 and I have a kindle so in my opinion its a good game no bad ads or nothings. gone wrong on my device and its good for all ages
B00683JLXA|1.0|you should be more original. the quality is also very poor. I would not waste my time downloading this game.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|So colorful, the graphics are well done. I think most people would enjoy this game. I like the calm pace and relaxing music.
B005PK56TA|5.0|One of the best t.v. shows out there. Very addicting from the first episode. Wish season 2 was free as well.
B004V5QWU2|1.0|I bought the app but never received it.  Makes me less inclined to purchase others. I should have heeded the warning of others.
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|This one is my very favorite game!  I actually paid for this one!  Challenging, great graphics, I even like the music that goes with it.  If you like puzzles, this is the one for you!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I loved the movie first. Then the book.  Unlike another reviewer I do have some mental illness quite close to me in my life.  I wish all people with this disability could have a happy ending in their life like this book.  It gives me hope.
B00985E3UG|5.0|I LOVE this book. I have another on this topic but it is dry and technical in the style of writing.  This one is much more &#34;user friendly&#34; and so relevant to my concerns about our food industry.  I HIGHLY recommend this one if you care about the food that you are feeling yourself and your family!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV right now.  I couldn't stop watching it and I watched all the episodes within 2 days.  Great story line.
B00BF11UM0|5.0|it was awesome!!  the anticipation was thrilling.  amazed at all the work it took to catch bin laden.  made me proud to be an american.
0553805371|5.0|First pages easy to follow and quite interesting.  Later gets more intense but still very thought provoking.  Would recommend it.
B008GJV4F2|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time.  This movies provides humor, drama and testifies to the power of acceptance and unconditional love.<br /><br />Johnny Depp and Juliette Binoche had wonderful chemistry in bringing to life some of the positives of when opposites attract.<br /><br />Delightfully entertaining! I recommend this movie anytime, it is such a &#34;feel good&#34; movie.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I would have preferred a little less flowery writing .the story kept my interest,but I nearly put it down several times because of the nonessential blah blah.it is worth the time to suffer thru all the nonsense to complete the book.
B009R659L8|5.0|Another great book by my favorite author! The only bad part about the  book, is when I finished it, cause I don't know how long I will have to wait for another of her excellent books!
B00003CXCT|5.0|My son loves this collection! He is 11 and has become a fan of StarWars. We are waiting for episode 7 in 2015
B000QCS8TW|4.0|Started in the middle of a world I didn't know but quickly learned and wanted to know much much more.
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|I love Jack Reacher in the pages of a Lee Childs' book. Who was this guy on the movie screen?  When I found out that Tom Cruise, once again, was cast as a tough guy I just laughed.  Why does he get the rolls which require a \\"manly man\\" not a \\"girly boy\\".  Much to my regret I broke down and watched this movie.  Bad move.<br />The only thing the creators of this movie were smart about was not trying to recreate any specific Reacher book. I sincerely hope if there is another Jack Reacher movie Tom Cruise has nothing to do with it.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|This is the fastest and greatest app for remote access.. I've used it in my ipad for 2 years and is really stable and fluid.. Android version is just as good as the IOS.. Highly recommend..  5 stars!
0062014536|3.0|Steph's Review:<br />It may be a bad thing that I'm writing this review before I review Pandemonium, but trust me, I have A LOT more to say about Requiem. Warning: There will be rants, annoyance, change of hearts, etc. After I finished Pandemonium, I kind of had the \\"blank look of shock\\" until I immediately started grabbing for Requiem (which is why I never reviewed Pandemonium, lack of time spent reading and studying for exams). Both Delirium and Pandemonium were flat out amazing, and I finally found myself in love with this series. Requiem changed things a little...<br /><br />I am so torn about this book. I didn't really know what rating to give it since there were parts I absolutely adored, but parts that really pestered at me. It completely lived up the high standards set by Pandemonium action wise, but the love story? In shreds. The ending? A big HUH?. I think its best to do a \\"The Good\\" and \\"The Bad\\" comparison. Minor spoilers ahead, view discretion advised.<br /><br />The Good<br /><br />Action<br />While I felt Delirium was lacking in the action, Pandemonium made up for it. Requiem delivers action right to our minds, spot on. The suspense is a killer, the betrayals and backstabbing are the ultimate twists. During the action sequences, my heart was racing with fear and anticipation, and most of the time I just hoped everything would turn out okay. I started to like Lena a lot in Pandemonium, and I wanted her to be lucky, and be happy (happier?). She's faced too much death since reaching the Wilds. The action is heart jolting, and is what really shines throughout the entirety of the novel. I think all this action  shows Lauren Oliver's growth as a writer, because the plots and plans are so much more elaborate than before. I actually couldn't see through them this time. This is what mostly kept me engrossed the whole time (I'm a sucker for action!). The Resistance has amassed a huge number of followers, both within the confines of cities and out. The attacks and raids planned were startling and superb!<br /><br />Hana's Story<br />Requiem is told in dual POV's, one Hana and the other Lena. In this installment, Hana has been cured of amor deliria nervosa and is prepping to get married to the to-be mayor of Portland, Fred Hargrove. At first I was kind of mad that Hana ended up succumbing to the will of the government, because I always thought it'd be pretty epic if somehow Hana managed to make it out into the Wilds too. From how she was in Delirium, this was a big change in demeanor and it was harder to make a shift from \\"past-Hana\\" to \\"present-Hana\\". Then I realized how dumb I was about that because Hana lived her whole life primped and primed to take her role in society. After I got past my initial anger, I ended up enjoying Hana's chapters more than Lena's. She is newly cured now, but can't seem let go of her old life completely: i.e. the cure didn't quite work all the way. She's a great actress though and can hide this from the press, her fiancee, her parents, everyone. Her story is one of discovery, about herself and about Fred... who's intentions might be much darker than what appears in the good-boy facade he emulates to the world. Most of the suspense is actually in Hana chapters. Lena gets the action, Hana gets the tension.<br /><br />Alex is back everyone!<br />Yes, I was always an Alex girl. Julian was such a wimp...and he never really grew on me. I always though Alex was better for Lena. He joins Lena's group, meaning we've got a 3-way love story going.  His and Julian's silent treatment of each other was actually quite amusing. There are parts of \\"Alex\\" I was really angry about though, but I'll get to that in the bad under \\"The Romance\\".<br /><br />Annabel<br />This is Lena's mother, who also goes under the name \\"Bee\\" in Requiem. She doesn't have a huge role in the book, but I think her character is a good representation of sacrificing yourself for those you love. She has a noble concept, and I couldn't help but really like her despite not knowing much about her character.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />Romance<br />*sighs*. I'm an Alex girl. And he annoyed me for the first half of this book. He's broken on the inside, but I don't take that as an excuse to push everything and anyone he ever cared about away. It wasn't fair to Lena, not fair to himself. I wanted him and Lena to get back together and happy, because even Lena admits she's never loved anyone more than Alex (besides her mom I guess). Julian is messing the whole thing up to me. I don't like him, I think he switched sides to fast, and well he's a wimp. I'm into alpha-male type characters, and Julian...is not. Lena's indecision swamped me too. She clearly was still in love with Alex, couldn't break it to Julian, then decided that if she couldn't fess up she must love Julian. Ack. Her back-and-forth mindsets really annoyed me. There are no more stolen moments in this book like there was in Delirium and Pandemonium. The romance the reader gets come from mentality only.<br /><br />The Ending<br />If this ending wasn't so awkward, I could've gotten over myself about the romance issues and given this book a good pat on the back cover, rate it 5 stars, and be done. I honestly don't know what to make of it. Lauren Oliver didn't write the ending to feel like a close of a series, It honestly felt like there was a 4th book on the way or something. There are so many questions unanswered, and the knots are not tied. I don't want to spoil anything, which is hard and leaves this part a little vague, but if you read this book you will understand. There isn't really an ending plot. Lauren basically leaves us with this inspirational comment about love, life, and fighting for your deepest desires, but it wasn't a closing. There was no finality, and the ending of this book really made me feel like I was hanging somewhere. It really disappointed me because we never find out the imminent futures for the characters, no definite HEA, just...emptiness. I don't know if she's trying to say \\"you can never predict your own future, so I'm not going to give you anything to predict my character's futures\\" or something like that. There just wasn't a good resolution to the conflict, which just made the ending to this series discouraging. It was a wonderful read until I realized that there was not more left of it when there should have been.<br /><br />You might have noticed I didn't talk much about our protagonist, Lena. I just don't know where to put her on this spectrum since she was overall just \\"meh\\" to me in Requiem. I liked her during the action, I despised her during the romance. She was just okay.<br /><br />Overall, this book is great while you are part of it, when your reading it, but once its over you feel like you've been crudely ripped away from a world you wish you could stay in longer. I do recommend it to Delirium fans, though read at your own risk.<br /><br />--Steph @ A Walk on Wordsut really like her despite not knowing much about her character.<br /><br />The Bad<br /><br />Romance<br />*sighs*.

0812550706|5.0|Card's character development in this book and the Shadow series puts him at the pinnacle of his craft. The Ender's Game and Ender's Shadow series are responsible for two of the most compelling characters, from any genre, ever conceived. Put simply, this is the best science fiction novel I have ever read and there's a good chance you'll feel the same way too.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Cute, nicely paced movie! Funny movie showing upbeat but different<br />experiences related to pregnancy. Lots of star power with Jennifer Lopez and Cameron Diaz in lead roles. Entertaining,I wasn't sure what to expect<br />but I enjoyed it!

B003EY7IRC|5.0|I absolutely loved this series.  This final book was just as creative as the last 4. So many twists and turns.  It keeps you guessing until the very end.  I was afraid throughout that it would not end well??<br /><br />I don't want to say anything else because this is a series you should go into blind.  Just close your eyes and ride the roller coaster.<br /><br />Karen Moning is truly a gifted artist.  This series is equal to my favorite Experiment in Terror series (karina Halle).

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Stayed true to form from the rest of the series. I would have liked a bit more detail in the ending of it all but won't go into it here to not be a spoiler.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This charming series makes one nostalgic for a simpler time.  The characters, with all their idiosyncrasies, leave an impression on the viewer.  If you enjoy period pieces, this one is must- see!
B005K01VZS|5.0|I have read several other Mitch Albom books, and I enjoyed this one the most.  There is something so inspiring about a true story, told well and Mitch Albom does tell a story well.  Dedicated to a promise made to his rabbi to do his eulogy, brings the author into closer relationship with Rabbi Lewis, and what it means to live a good and full life based on faith. The introduction of a second &#34;man of God&#34; and the comparison of the two men and their ministries leaves an indelible mark upon the reader, revealing that in this life all things are possible, even the impossible.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Overexposed is the first Maroon 5 disc, since Songs About Jane, that doesn't sound played out poppy.  Yes, some of the songs fit mainstream expectations, but the variety of music provided on the album really show Adam Levine's vocal range and the flexibility of the band musically.  To put this album into one specific genre would be a hard task, as Maroon 5 has exposed their versatility with this one! This is a must listen.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I love Daft Punk. Featuring Pharrell Williams on vocals was stellar. I can't wait for the album to come out!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It was a hard read at first, but once I got into it, it is a very good book. I just didn't like the child narration; but it made sense once you got into it. You had to get there first. Don't stop reading, keep going, it gets better and becomes a page turner. I would recommend this book.
B0014QABX0|5.0|The guitar riff in &#34;I Got Mine&#34; is one of the coolest around. Rest of the album is great as well. Love the fact that you can buy the CD from Amazon, and they'll let you instantly download it as well. I will be buying more albums from Amazon for that reason alone.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love this show - well written, acted and beautiful place. Love the clothes and looking forward to season four. I can not wait until til 2014.
0143122916|4.0|This is a compelling and important contemporary book that anyone who has any doubts about<br />conditions in North Korea should read.  It's an amazing story whose savagery, brutality, extreme cruelty<br />and incredible courage shocks at every turn. Still, I was left with<br />wanting to know more about the subject of Harden's book, Shin Dong huyk. I had the feeling Harden was either too much the<br />journalist lacking an eye for deeper understanding or he simply did the best he could with a young man so traumatized<br />by his experience and by guilt over informing on his mother and brother who planned to escape it wasn't possible to go further.<br />If I had to choose, I'd say it was the latter.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|great story line acting superb and scenery amazing interaction between characters excellent<br />looking forward to  see what season 2 holds
B0076DELIG|2.0|This was my first Connelly book so I don't know if it is representative of his style in general.  It was just a little too hard core police procedural for my liking.  I only got half way through.....keep picking it up to try again but it just doesn't catch my interest.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|THis is one of my favorite musicals of all times and I am glad to have it in my collection!
B006LSZECO|5.0|The twists and turns in this novel will keep you on the edge of your seat.  Great read and an unbelievable ending!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Keeps my attention and reflexes sharpened. This is good for a senior citizen like me to keep my brain active.
B006YTTVHO|1.0|Perhaps my expectations were too high, but I was very disappointed with this book. It screams &#34;self-published&#34; and &#34;never edited&#34;. It is very repetitive and poorly written. On the plus side, it's blessedly short.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|I loved the movie plenty of actio but it needed a little more I think but as you want an essay I have no chioce on Bull Shipping you more
B002PEP4SC|3.0|As a fan of the TV show Castle, I enjoyed reading this book. The book characters are exactly as described in the show--they're over-the-top reflections of their &#34;real life&#34; counterparts (the characters in the show).<br />However, as a fan of literature, this book was BAAAAD. It's an obvious and cheesy attempt to make more money off the Castle franchise. It is not a murder-mystery book that can stand on its own merits.
B00992CF6W|3.0|As my title says I do, but PE Isn't as good as the real one.<br />I would recommend survival craft. PE just kind of makes no sense, it's all crazy, it is still well modeled though..
B002K0WBXW|5.0|Me and my highly poisonous snake watch this movie and just laugh our ASP off!!! &#34;Totally different head, like totally&#34;
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|Does what is expected from Google on my Kindle . Not a bad app at all.4 more words and I'm out!
B007KZY1YY|4.0|It was good ,but the language was over the top.Every one or most people knows  what happens<br />between  a couple  in the bedroom.<br />And this  include  all three , Fifty shades  of grey, Fifty shades  of darker and Fifty  shades  of freed.
B008LFY6NI|3.0|NOT LIKE REAL LIFE SPIN ART. THE GAME IS JUST OK. MAYBE I WAS EXPECTING TOO MUCH FROM THE GAME.
B009OA57MI|5.0|I use this app all the time and it is one of my favorite apps.Join my YouTube account called rnelson 299.
B007EECSFA|5.0|This is a somewhat &#34;tough&#34;read to get into, but is expertly written with flashbacks to the London Blitz and the present.  Lots of twists and turns, romance and surprises as the mystery of the past of a dying mother is discovered/investigated by her grown dauughter.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really love this game... it has really gotten interesting in every update.. really fun... very challenging and mind blowing. I never get bored playing this game. Also it become really noticeable and popular to play.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Am in the middle of this book and chose it as something very light  to read while enduring medical testingl.  It is truly a typical Nicholas Sparks book.  I call him the male Danelle Steele!  One knows the end before even reading 10 pages!  Well developed characters and am awaiting the villian to show up!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I THINK THE STORYLINES ARE GREAT AND AM PLEASED I CAN ENJOY ANYTIME WITH PRIME MEMBERSHIP. IT MAKES THE TIME GO QUICKLY WHILE I AM AT OUT PATIENT HOSPITAL
B000W93CHC|5.0|Even though this is a recent book, it feels like a classic. Follett does a great job of capturing the fears, hopes and dreams of his characters. It can be a little like a soap opera occasionally, but it is paced well throughout.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is by far the best game I have played so far!  It's challenging and it makes you think.  Not too hard, but definitely not too easy.  I've never played a game like this before, but the reviews were great, so I had to give it a try.  So glad I did!  I can't wait for the next one!  Buy this game.  You will not regret it!
B000FBJHZS|3.0|This book was pretty good, but a little predictable. I could tell how this book would end about halfway through.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|It took a little bit to get going but the book was amazing. I missed the other characters at first but as always George R.R. Martin sucked me in.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Abby and Travis will have your complete attention from the first chapter of this book. I couldn't put it down!
B0072GPQNG|2.0|I guess I had just hyped it up in my mind 2 much.  It was a good movie but I think the trailer was better than the movie.  It was very slow in spots.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|I love Michael Buble's voice.  His christmas songs are the originals and they are delightful to hear.  Wish he was in the US so I could see him in concert.
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|Daniel Pink is a master at taking left brain subjects and injecting the right brain into them. I have worked in sales all my career and read too many left brain how to sell books. Wish I had read this one earlier and not been forced to figure this out sub-optimally for myself.<br />Pink + Simon Sinek = a rewarding approach to a tough business (sales)
B00C1BUYX4|5.0|Yes I would highly recommend this movie.Other have told me it is a great  movie.We will watch this again & again. Great  show! Must see.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This is a very sweet story. The setting was interesting, as were the characters. I would recommend this book for those who want an enjoyable, light read.
B00932A4XE|5.0|I loved this movie!! I'm going to by it soon!! So funny and heartfelt at the same time. Great movie!!
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Bought the Kindle version of the entire series for a trip to Morocco. From the first chapter onwards it moves at a nice pace. Very good read. Finished all 4 books in under a week, and now really looking forward to the rest of the story.<br /><br />Characters aren't as deep as some other well known authors, but the upside of that is that everyone can read and enjoy the books.
B00BT0ZDF2|5.0|I had looked for this to release in theatres and somehow missed it. Had to see it as soon as I could.<br />As good as the book? No, movies seldom are, but an awesome movie, with a loyalty to the original material but standing fine on its own.<br />If the book had started the way the movie did, with short snippets of the various story arcs, I would not have had to read the book over again , as the first time thru I was a little lost in the beginning and missed some stuff.<br />Strong recommend, shame it had such a short theatre life span.<br /><br />Spoiler (Maybe)<br />Seeing Smith in drag was great.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Each book is better than the last. The books are intriguing, entertaining and fun to read. People have the misconception about these books been &#34;soft porn&#34; which is far from the truth.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Very good product! It was exactly what I wanted access to a dictionary on my tablet. Very pleased with app
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|Yes that thing that you have been thinking about With the one think you can focus more on that what you really want.
B007VYQ9G2|4.0|Good movie. My kids loved it. They have watched it three times already. I thought it was a little slow at first, It got good.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|As most other reviews has mentioned it is sleek, and very comfortable to use. I really recommend this product as its easy-to-use and looks pretty ok too. For me, these were more important features rather than making it look fancy!
B005S9EKCW|3.0|The packaging and contents were perfect.  But a STRONG warning for those who had seen Les Mis either on stage in New York City or own the 10th and 25th Anniversary videos.  That is because only they will know the potential of Les Mis.  This is a movie so Hollywood gets involved where it shouldn't, actors singing instead of singers acting.  The \\"Javert\\" (s) on stage and in the two anniversary videos were fantastic.  In the movie he was okay.  Jean Valjean on stage in New York, Colm Wilkinson, played the priest in the movie.  Jean Valjean in the movie was okay.  Fantine's acting was well done.  But the singing never came close to broadway and therefore very disappointing.  M. Thenardier, the Inn Keeper, was a sleeze, not smart like the one on stage.  And the director having Santa Claus with a prostitute in the Inn was unforgiving . . . wasn't needed and political correct, which too often we can expect from the elites in Hollywood.  In the director's explanation cut on the video, he said Marius and Cosette were picked because they had looked like relatives in Victor's day.  What, in a musical you look for people with faces from old paintings instead of their singing?  Marius could sing but looked too young for the part.  And Cosette, played by the lead from Mama Mia the ABBA movie, just ruined it for us with her voice not even close to the wonderful Cosettes on stage.  In fact it has come to the point we can no longer watch the movie, knowing what Cosette can really sound like.  And the director, along with the actor who played Jean Valjean, said in the cut Les Mis reminded them of . . . wait for it . . . OWS.  What?!  Did they not know OWS was lead by communists in the crowd on the streets against businesses and banks in New York City?  OWS wasn't about abuses of society like in Les Mis. OWS didn't like successful people making money, this in a society overflowing with entitlement programs not exactly the world of Les. Mis.  By the way, the 10th Anniversary is only onDVD, but has an excellent ending with all the Jean Valjeans on stage that have played that part around the world. The 25th Anniversary is on Blu Ray and also excellent. As a final remark, the backgrounds in the movie were truly outstanding.  It's sad the quality of the singing didn't match.  Again, the music for Les Mis is for professional singers who can act, not popular actors who can sing.
B000W91RUG|4.0|As long as you are ok with these people being treated as religion phobic or challenged it is pretty good. Smart people have traditionally been unable to process a higher being and they do a pretty good job of making fun of themselves. The science is true and the humor is great.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|This game is ok, but it gets boring after a while. It would be better if there were dots in every box and you could blend them together to cover the whole box in the shortest amount of moves.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I'm not gifted at playing, but am having fun trying.  I am using a stylus and not the controls at the bottom.  I keep dying but I am playing longer each time.  Talk about a trip down memory lane.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book and the writer's style. Would highly recommend. In the same vein as Angela's ashes. Well done!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|My daughter, a tough critic loved it! She said it was not as good as the first but still a fun movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a simple game where the kid is running away in the subways. He needs to collect coins and dodge trains and of course not get caught by the guard. It is set up a lot like Temple Run but my kid likes this one better, probably because it is a kid as the character. No educational value but a fun little game.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great graphics, interesting storyline, extremely playable. Couldn't put it down, and in fact I want to go through it again! I look forward to more games from this company. Well worth the price.
B008Y7IP0S|4.0|I enjoyed watching it and my kids understood why sometimes you just have to do things first then understand the reason later.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|The Cube is fast moving and mentally stimulating.  The colors are very vivid and object view is wonderful.  Very stimulating for a 72 year old!
B009M4KTEM|5.0|Great jammin sugaree, and \\"that's all right\\" very good collection of songs.  Uptempo can't help but to get down and groove out
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|I am impressed by the Title, Table of contents, as well as how the author guides the reader in a very creative way the meanings, and the excellent examples to make his point crystal clear, REGARDING BLATANT LIES AS MULTITASKING AND HOW TO ASK YOURSELF : \\"WHAT IS THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I CAN DO TODAY SO SUCH BY DOING IT EVERYTHING ELSE WOULD BE EASIER AND UNNECESSARY? This question was a real challenge for me, and now, I like challenges that will make my life useful to others and at the same time enjoy my life. VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT STEVE CHANDLER TALKS FREQUENTLY: Focus on one thing at a time. Everybody, has only 24 in one day, if I want to change something the answer for many people (including myself in the past)thought that working more hours, doing more things etc was the answer. Steve Chandler's set of a Success course on CD, was the first person I heard talking an I will quote him \\"business is laziness\\" and this book THE ONE THING, hekped me to nderstand better what Steve meant.<br /><br />In the last 4-5 years I have read many self help books , but never one like this one. Several years ago I read another book concerning the same topic, Comparing what I got from this one is unbelievable, and I am taking into account that I have grown from the personal point of view, and inspite of this the book is A MUST TO ANYBODY THAT IS LOOKING FOR ANSWERS LIKE PURPOSE IN LIFE, HOW TO FIND IT, HOW TO BECOME EFFICIENT, HOW TO DEVELOP A POSITIVE HABIT ETC..I RECCOMEND THIS BOOK WITHOUT HESITATION, DO NOT WASTE MONEY OR TIME LOOKING FOR SELF-HELP BOOKS....THIS ONE (I ignore if it was the authors purpose or not)INCLUDES ALMOST ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW TO THRIVE IN YOUR PERSONAL, FAMILY, SOCIAL, BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL LIFE. I HAVE FOLLOWED MANY OF HIS ADVICES AND WITHOUT BEEN A MIRACLE-LIKE RETRIBUTION YOU GET, ACTUALLY IT HELPS YOU TO UNDERSTAND REALITY IN A VERY PECULIAR AND AT THE SAME TIME SIMPLE VIEW. describing the benefits with less words might be unfair to any body looking for down to earth answers...HE WILL NOT GIVE THEM IN YOUR MOUTH LIKE FOOD...YOU NEED TO THINK, AND THINK POSITIVEody looking for down to earth answers...HE WILL NOT GIVE THEM IN YOUR MOUTH LIKE FOOD...YOU NEED TO THINK, AND THINK POSITIVE

0385342055|4.0|This has to be the best in the shopaholic series. Minnie is a riot and Beckys antics are funnier than ever.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Every episode envelopes the viewer in political intrigue.  Then toss in all the other usual suspects:  interpersonal competition, interpersonal relationships, the normal bumps in the road that life throws at you, and the &#34;law suit&#34; of the day...the perfect storm and the perfect balance of tension.
B005PK553C|5.0|I could not stop watching this....we watched the whole season in one day. This is for the unique horror fans out there that like to push their limits

B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple Run is so my much better than the first temple run because much more activities and there's a cave!!!!
B00BQI4AU6|5.0|This is a great album that has quickly become my favorite. I've played it three time in a row, something I haven't done since Def Leppard's Hysteria back in 1987. Tom and Savannah, his wife, have written and produced a great album that any true rock/blues fan needs to have in their collection.<br /><br />Tom's voice is better than ever. Some people may expect the screaming voice from back in the 80s, which he delivers from time to time on this album. But, I actually prefer his voice now. It has more emotion than ever. If you haven't heard the acoustic version he recorded of \\"Nobody's Fool,\\" (VH1: Classic Metal Mania - Stripped Vol 3), you ought listen to it. I love it.<br /><br />Cinderella fans, and fans of great rock music, need to add this album to their collection.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Nemo's reef is a pretty good game. Fun for kids with familiar characters it's a good beginners world and easy to play.
0374533571|4.0|I have not seen the movie, but since it was well-received, thought I would try the book. The characters are very quirky, but likable. Our book club selected this book for April. One of the members had seen the movie and did say the movie was not very true to the book. She had found the movie enjoyable on its own, but I think I will just stick with the book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Had no difficulty reading this book.  Don't usually have time to read books.  Am still not finished with this book.  But enjoyed it extremely so far.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|This album is another masterpiece from HIM. It reminds me of a mixture of Love Metal and Dark Light. If You love HIM you must buy this album.Every song on this album is amazing.  This album is a must have for all HIM fans.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|love it that you don't HAVE to buy stuff. graphics are great!!!!! LOVE IT LOVE IT  LOVE IT LOVE IT
B009MYARIK|1.0|One of my favorite authors so I didn't bat an eye at preordering her new book. I'm not sure I even read the premise of \\"The Wedding Night\\" either. I  enjoy the author's wit and the unthinkable disasters that her characters find themselves in however this book missed the mark by miles. I found the characters to be under developed and lacking any real connection. The story line was rushed and so unbelievable at times. It was hard to relate to either of the heroines as it jumped back and forth between them over and over. I also felt the dialogue was strained and instead of the charming wit that I have come to love in her writing I found multiple cop outs with using the f word repeatedly. I don't mind a little bit of language or the occasional shagfest, unfortunately this one went from classy and endearing characters to shallow and trashy.
0920236162|5.0|I read this to my daughters when it was first published (25 years ago). Without giving too much away, I loved the fact that the Paperbag Princess outsmarted the dragon and appreciated her independent thinking -- standing up for herself, which was a good concept to instill in my daughters in an entertaining way.  They still have copies of this book, and I even have one myself.  I've given it as gifts many times, too.  This was an unusual book for its time, but the story still holds up.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|The plot was silly and poor example of parents and a family. Very foul language. Not worth your time to watch.
1416968725|5.0|This book is so creative and suspensive with the illustrations ! as you turn about 5 smaller size in lengths each a bit bigger then the previous  and when you turn it over it creates a new picture telling  the events of what is happening with the eggs hatching. its beyond creative and extremely fun! Dont forget the &#34;quack&#34; at the back of the book when you flip the book over! Its open to interpretation and REALLY gets the kids talking about what it means to them! :)
B00BVYKWJI|5.0|Everything about this series is wonderful!  You have sex, murder, betrayal, loyalty.  Not to mention the people are beautiful and the customs are nothing less then deliciously appealing for the eyes!
014241543X|4.0|Gayle Forman beautifully writes a tragic, yet hopeful story portraying a very musical girl named Mia who gets in a tragic car accident and needs to decide whether she should stay or join her family in heaven. Forman demonstrates a strong reflection of reality in her writing because many people, if given the chance, would want to see what was going on and decide if they would die or continue to live. Another huge reality that may hit home with many readers is the car accident. This is an important display of reflection of reality because this happens on a daily basis.<br /> The internal consistency of a book may help the reader define if he/she likes the book or not. Forman wrote in a very easy flowing style. The chapters switch back and forth from old memories to her in her out of body experience in the hospital. There are no bizarre shifts in the events that happen or with Mia's attitude. The events that happen in the book flow one after another very naturally. Although the chapters flip from present to the past it is still very easy to follow and readers will know when they are in the hospital are a flashback Mia is having. In the sequel to If I Stay Forman changes the stories main character to Adam. The flow of the book remains the same with the chapters going back in forth from present to past so the book is consistent all the way through to the end.<br /> Forman made it very easy to read this book and clarity was another bonus this book reads. Not only is it a quick easy read, the word choice, large font, and small book size make it an easy book to read for many ages. Since the word choice is simple there is no need to have a dictionary by your side in case of a struggle with words.<br /> In conclusion, both books kept you wanting to learn more about Mia and Adam to see what would happen. The book remains consistent  with its chapters, writing style, word choice, and quick flowing movement. Many readers will connect with Mia and feel the same things she does oreven feel like they are with Mia or Adam. Everyone will be cheering Mia on page by page until the end, where Forman excels by pulling people in to read the next book.
009950569X|5.0|I am always somewhat skeptical about self-help books, but this one is well above the norm for the genre.  While the basic ideas can be reduced to 5-10 pages, most of the stories and explanations do actually add to the exposition of the topics.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This war game has the feeling of that ur in combat. Cool weapons, vehicles, and  isn't easy; so prepare. Grab some guns, grenades , flack  jacket and start blowing shit up..........
B00BESCJII|4.0|not exactly epic.  The setting was supposed to be in the 90's but a few conversations sounds like today's bantering.  Plot is not bad, but not impressive.  It's still better than most junk out there anyway.

B007BVOEPI|5.0|Season 1 episode 1.. This is where it all starts. If you are new to the series I wouldn't jump around. The first episode is great but for me season 1 really didn't pick up until mid season. I highly recommend

B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a pretty good app for getting daily and weekly weather. I check it every morning before I go out.

B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Cut the Rope has always been my favorite of the &quot;big&quot; mobile games, and this one continues the tradition. There's some great, brand-new content here, and pound for pound this is even better than its two predecessors. It's a little short, but what's here is premium CtR action, and well worth your $1.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so fun whenever in bored it helps me get cheered up and not bored any more I just love it.
1936608898|5.0|The main part of the diet is very close to 4 hour body, but takes it up a step.  I did not feel bad before I did the program, but some problems I was having did not think of as a problem until I no longer had them.  Read it and give it 30 days.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Fun game and another good thing is is fun lots of fun playing and its easy to get money and build for on city
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the cutest game ever!!!!  I love the cop chasing him.  Freakin' hilarious!!!  I play it over and over......lol.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think this game is very awesome.I love the daily challenges and I also love the power ups.The change in venues keep the game exciting and fresh.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My daughter suggested I read this trilogy.  She said it was really good.  She was right!!  I read all three books extremely fast!!  I couldn't put it down!!  If you saw and liked the movie, then grab these books and read them before the other movies come out!!
B008B1BL4E|4.0|Highly detailed but engaging work tracing the mutual mistrust and paranoia among the Great Powers that culminated in World War I. The author focuses on the history of their competing interests and policies in the Balkans during the 19th and early 20th centuries and on the suspicion generated by their ongoing imperial rivalry. He explains &#34;how&#34; the Great War came to pass but does not ignore the &#34;why&#34;, broadly concluding that blame should be shared by all. His approach is somewhat revisionist and less critical of Austria and Germany than most studies. A thoughtful addition to the large body of scholarship on a subject of enduring fascination.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I started watching the HBO es before I grabbed the books.  My co-worker told me to read the book series if I like the TV series.  I must say that the HBO version is pretty accurate, but the books give you a clearer picture of whats going on!!  I love Game of Thrones!!  Its well written and keeps you hooked!!  I highly recommend these books!!
0545265355|5.0|I read all three books within a week, and now I own the first movie looking forward to the second one coming out.... The books were as impossible to put down as the movie is impossible to not sit down and watch all the way through.. one of the best book series ive read in a long time.......
B0067AC5KA|4.0|I really liked this series.  However, some of the details of the book got a little boring.  I think the translation to English caused them to focus on a little too much detail for my taste.  The movie did a great job cutting out some of the fluff that is in the book, but also left out some significant details as movies usually do.  The first book is fantastic...the second not so much...the third was pretty good and ended well.  Good read though!!
B000002N3N|5.0|I love Enya and all of the music that she shares with us.  This is one of her best recordings, and I love every minute of it.  I listen to it over and over and never tire of the melody/voice - I even used it as a backdrop to a sermon.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|This is a fantastic product that works exactly as described. A must have for campers, hikers or for emergencies. It boils or heats like a charm.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Worked very well on my Kindle HD.  Slow down and enjoy it.  IF you get frustrated put it down and resume later.  This is a nice slow game with good graphics and good sound.  It has my recommendation.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|The movie was entertaining and funny.  It was a cute story and held the attention of a 4-year-old, 7-year-old, 9-year-old and mom and dad!
B004QX07G4|5.0|I love Ellen! This book was such a great way read and easily put a smile on your face! I recommend this book for everyone!
B00AYDC5HY|3.0|Although my kids stayed awake through it, I did not.  My 9-year-old daughter came up with the 3-star as it was just an ok movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great ending for the Trilogy.  Good story.  I love happy endings.  Love can make things better in this world.
B008602KQI|4.0|Movies are never as good as the books, so I wasn't too disappointed, but I do wish the movie people had stayed closer to the written story.  Katniss's relationship with Gale isn't really explored enough to explain it to someone who hasn't read the book and Peta comes across as rather wimpy and boring.  The Capital people weren't &#34;fleshed out&#34; enough and you didn't really get how controlling the Capital is.  It was still ok to watch.
B0074MZSWW|5.0|Classic blues rock. Could have been recorded in the 60's and given competition to Janis Joplin. The technical quality isn't top notch, but that's irrelevant after you've gotten addicted.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|The action in this is good and the CG is well done.  It's a good movie to see if you like Batman.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Best series I've seen in a long time. Be prepared to sit through the entire season in one shot. Grab your popcorn
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Made me laugh, cry, and stay up very late on work nights!! A definite must read. Thanks Melis for the recommendation.
0316056863|3.0|I picked this book up for two reasons: Tina Fey is generally pretty hilarious; and Bossypants is just a great title.  I'm pretty sure my siblings have been calling me that behind my back for years.<br /><br />Typically, I'm a little reluctant to read books by comedians because I don't love a whole book full of jokes.  I'm happy to say that this book is funny, but it's funny things about Tina Fey's journey from growing up in Philly to being the creator/head writer of 30 Rock.  Maybe this is because her background is not in standup, so she doesn't feel the need to go over her shows with us.  Regardless of the reason, I really enjoyed the format and the little journey I got to take through her life.<br /><br />One of my favorite things was the approach Tina Fey took on things that really bug me, specifically people giving random unsolicited opinions like you asked for advice on the topic.  She is clearly not into it, but takes the time to mock it, and that makes me wish I had her kind of wit so that I could come up with a funny, yet poignant, retort to those kinds of comments.  Alas, I will have to just keep thinking and being polite in the meantime.<br /><br />This book was exactly my humor style, which I figured it would be since I like Tina's other work, so it makes sense that I'd like her book.  After reading it, I feel a bit like I know her - not because I think this book is overly personal on her part, more that she seems so relatable and easy to get along with, she just seems like my kind of person.<br /><br />As is the case with a lot of these types of books, if you like the comedic style of the author, you're probably more likely to enjoy the book.  So if you're into Tina Fey, or think you might be, go pick the book up!
B00932A4XE|4.0|I loved this movie.  It wasn't your average chick flick and I loved the camaraderie with the men in the movie.  A great date movie.  :)
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|I bought this game for my grandson who is 4 years old.  He seems to like playing it but I have no idea how it plays.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my kind of genre! I love love love the hunger games trilogy. So exciting! It really catches u. The book surprises u also. The ending leaves in suspense. Hope this helped and if u read this.... ENJOY THE HUNGER GAMES May the odds be ever in your favor.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|This game is fun to play.  The only problem I have with it is that you have to buy new lives. You get free ones but they are quickly used up and then you have to wait.  I would like to be able to earn new lives during the game so that I could continue playing instead of having to wait for the time to go by or to spend money on buying them.
0439023521|5.0|This was a great book. I finished it in one sitting. But I do want to kill the main character. If Katniss does not want Peeta then she should just say so. And he needs to get a life. But it is a good read!
B0029EDMEG|4.0|This made for tv movie shouldn't work. Tom Selleck is at least 20 years older than Jesse Stone was in the book. Movie writers typically change the story line, you know the drill. The story has been changed. It's shortened. The ending is different. Molly is black instead of Irish Catholic.<br /><br />Surprisingly it does work. Selleck may be too old but he manages to pull it off quite well. While the plot has been changed, enough of it is loyal the the intent of the story that it hangs together. The movie has the feel of the book. I'm surprised, but happily so.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's awesome when you get to know how to play it it's aggravating at first but it gets better after a while
B008NEVP1S|5.0|Most artists peak early and then trail off and even out as their career progresses--not Aimee!  This is my seventh album of hers and her last few are better than her earlier ones (which were very good).  Can she do any wrong?  Not so far!  No one sounds like her and her music puts you in a mellow, thoughtful place.  I love music that doesn't jar me and lyrics I can actually understand (the words at least).  There is a lot of subtle depth to her music and her voice is like velvet.  If you like Aimee at all, you'll love this album.
B009M1QRM8|5.0|This book completes the story started in their other two books - Fever Dream and Cold Vengeance.  Again it was fast paced and kept your interest as Agent Pendergast finds out more about his wife and her life before he met her.<br />This in turn leads to the discovery of a German city in the forests of Brazil and the experiments they are conducting.  I thought it was interesting and well worth reading.  Would recommend this one also.
B00BMQDM10|2.0|Disappointing effort from Kinsella, the female characters felt like watered down versions of Shopaholic. Not up to her usual standard.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|i love the book .it was hard to put it down  once i started reading it . its  full of action.and very very interesting. i recommend it whole heartedlly ...you wont be disappointed .
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|This was a decent album, not completely my taste, but I did enjoy it. Its pretty good. If you like Bruno Mars then you should definately buy it
0739317741|4.0|This book explores Sabermetrics...the creative and intuitive spin on number-crunching in traditional baseball.  It's a lengthy book, but crafts a nice mesh between the analysis of raw numbers and the personality traits of players, and the journey of who succeeds and who fails.  (The narrator in the audio book version is very good.)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|if you aren't watching this show then you are must be a walker. this show is amazing and will hook you in from the first minute.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|The story is fun, the animation is cute, the music is beautiful, and overall, the movie was enjoyable to watch.  I think this is a good movie to watch with your family.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Much better than the second book of the trilogy. Interesting to think that this could or might even happen in the future.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|I've never had one of these programs before, but since it was the FAOTD I decided to give it a try. I am very impressed! I played around with it for a little bit, looking through some of my files and pictures. I opened a photo editing program and now I can edit photos from my KFHD. Awesome for when I don't want to lug my big laptop upstairs. I look forward to playing around with it some more. I don't know all the capabilities, but so far it seems to work really well.
B003P8D6JQ|3.0|Although the movies could have been better, the soundtrack is pretty good. There are some random songs on it that are a bit out there, but most of the CD makes for good listening.
B008JJM88Q|1.0|When I start the app it says scroll to select your language. One problem. There are no languages I can select! It won't do anything else. That is literally all it says. Scroll to select your language, but there are no languages I can select.
0767836324|5.0|I bought a DVD, I received a DVD.  Hard to go wrong.  Hook has always been a favorite of mine, and watching this movie with my girlfriend (who hadn't seen it) was a lot of fun.
B002O6FBW0|4.0|I have seen a few silent movies. This one is a cut above for the facial expressions of the stars. Most intresting was the use of scenery and props to set the tone. The movie lacked a single straight vertical or horozontal line in the scenery. It has a suggestion of the way nighmarish backgrounds may move or be missing completeness. Unnerving is the best one word description I can think of.
0385349947|1.0|I just received the book, hard cover. This is the worst quality book I have ever bought in term of the condition/outlook of the book. It looks new but the binding is badly done, causing all pages not aligned. This is my first hard cover book from amazon, I hope this is not something common, anyway I won't try my luck next time.
0007477155|5.0|Very good series of books! Great bang for the buck with this set. Good reading for anyone that likes fantasy.
0345803493|4.0|I couldn't put it down!  Many parts are ridiculously sophmoric and repeatative, but bad writing or not, I liked the story.  Maybe because it's so different from most romance novels.
B008133MDK|5.0|I can't wait for the next series to come out.<br />This version of Sherlock is better than any other.<br />Once an episode starts I am riveted.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I felt it kept the pace from the first book really well. It was the kind of book , that once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. Very pleased.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|The premise is on fasting and this works!  It isn't fast, but it is steady.  Short book, the writer has been on OPB and I watched him when he did this program.  Very to the point, try it out!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This is a very handy app, rather good at predicting your corrections, and it analyses your typing to fine tune the predictions. The app will ask to log onto your email, Facebook, and twitter accounts, to get a bigger pool of data to base their predictions on. You don't have to agree, but it is something to know about.<br /><br />My main complaint is that when you are typing in a Web browser address bar, it adds a &quot;.com&quot; button on the space bar. Mostly it gets in the way and makes me mess up my typing. That is the only big issue I have here, and it is the reason for losing a star. If they fix it, I will change my rating.
B0052CK5PQ|1.0|so boring and never ending! she goes on and on and on about the same topic for endless pages just to turn to a new issue and do the same. its so boring. I was really looking forward to read it but its been a great disappointment!
B0031NMLCS|5.0|I found this movie to be a superb movie with a sci-fi appeal. Time travel of sorts. Leaving the what if question. If we could change our past to change our future givien the opportunity. Dennis Quaid plays a heartwarming and believable part as the father. Could not find a streaming version anywhere so I ended up buying the dvd. Well worth it for an addition to my video library.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is the best show on television. Great production, great quality, HBO knocked it out of the park on this one.
B006S53QCK|1.0|So much build up about this movie...what a let down! Steamy?? More like dry ice! Don't waste your time; 91/2 weeks isn't worth 91/2 minutes!
0307744434|1.0|This is the first book I ever read that I got to within 50 pages of the end and just stopped. I didn't even CARE how it ended.
B00003CXBK|5.0|The movie itself is, of course, AMAZING!! The condition of the box and the such is very nice and, as expected, in good condition. Thank you!
B004LWZWEC|2.0|I love the show, love Bon Scott, love the performance - but the audio is not in stereo...it's a mono soundtrack - yes...a mono soundtrack in hi-def? Like putting makeup on a pig. 5.1 mono audio. Yawn. Don't beleive me? Turn on surround and listen to each channel - it's all the same.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|The movie itself is, of course, AMAZING!! The condition of the box and the such is very nice and, as expected, in good condition. Thank you!
B00BSW6F26|1.0|Going to remove from it from my Kindle.  There is no challenge.  As soon as it started I didn't like it so I didn't go very far into the game.
B004G606K8|2.0|There's nothing initially wrong with this book, but as I started reading it, the characters were a bit too typical and the story didn't really grab me.
0812550706|5.0|All the books in this series are a little twisted and sad and attempt to challenge your sense of right and wrong. Good read for teenagers and Adults
B006HL9G10|2.0|not a bad product, just wasn't what i expected took it off almost immediately it was free so can't complain too much
B0034G4OVS|1.0|Cheeze movie, I knew it, so phonie, it was a bit entertaining, the story line was kind of good, but a hollywood type of snowboarding movie, iaaaakks
B000NA2776|5.0|I went looking for Mika after hearing him in &#34;Were the World Mine&#34;. I was surprised (in a good way) to find the music peppy and the lyrics entertaining. It's the kind of music that just makes you want to get up and dance around. It is easy to hear the influences from the 80's in the vocals and the 90's in the music, at least in my opinion.
B00CL0J99K|4.0|[...]    Everyone's favorite Avenger is back in his own film, and he is in no rush to get the dazzle going.  Iron Man 3 opens with an untold backstory, just not the kind you might expect, given such a statement.  After that, the movie takes the post-Avengers route, which is to say it shows one piece of the aftermath.  The impact of these preceding events is apparent in the first act, but offers little more than a character roadblock, in the long run.  Beyond that, the threat of a new villain is brought up consistently enough (through broadcasts) to warrant Tony Stark's curiosity.  The rest is left to be seen first-hand.    Iron Man 3 returns much of what was missing from the second film: delight.  The laughs and conversations can definitely get obnoxious, but even when they fall flat, there's still an odd gravitation to find towards it all.  At least, with the very potential exception of the film's key plot twist.  Spoilers will not arise, but those in charge of the script choices really jumped the shark here.  This will be an experience-destroying moment for some, especially given what is initially built up.  From there on, the plot begins to fade away as action is (finally) incorporated on a more frequent basis.    Like the laughs themselves, Iron Man 3 has tone shifts splashing left and right.  To say the film loves leaping from detrimental threats to light-hearted scoffing is definitely an understatement.  If it wasn't so brash--usually courtesy of Robert Downey Jr., you could almost pass it off as dark humor.  Whether it works or not rests entirely on the viewer's emotional flexibility.    One certainty, however, is that the cast had a fun time doing this film.  While there are some serious scenes, a lot of room is made for whimsical or play-along-with-it moments.  Guy Pearce, Don Cheadle and Ben Kingsley get a lot of the latter.  In fact, if there's anyone who gives Robert Downey Jr. a run for the suck-it-up award, it would have to be former series-director Jon Favreau, even with his brief screentime.  There really aren't any weak points in the cast, although Gwyneth Paltrow could've had more footage during the second act.    Where Iron Man 3 shines the most, unsurprisingly, is in the action sequences.  No, they aren't always plausible.  Then again, neither is half the technology Tony Stark has at his disposal, so credibility is far from top priority.  As Guy Pearce says in the movie, \\"ever since that guy came down with the hammer, things haven't been the same.\\"  Nonetheless, this leads to some pretty impressive stuff.  The attack on Stark's mansion is as thrilling as you'd expect, while the climax almost feels like it got mixed up with The Adventures of Tintin in some spots.  But given all of the style, it's tough to complain.    The final word on Iron Man 3 is that it's a very misleading film.  Things start off quite serious before quickly turning comical.  There's nothing wrong with that in and of itself, but it isn't always for the best reasoning.  Still, everyday audience members won't have a problem rolling with what comes around, simply because it means plenty of entertainment.  Iron Man 3 is a worthy successor and inclusion to the franchise, but the first film has continued to prove a tough piece for Marvel to match.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Good book for an escape or entertainment.  I liked the ending but I doubt it would end that way in the real world.  Suspend your intellect and read it for entertainment.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am a latecomer to this wonderful series, and I am completely smitten with it. I watched Season 1 streaming from Netflix and Season 2 streaming from Amazon. The show is just great. From the moment the music intro begins, it is completely engrossing. The talent is superb and the costumes, scenery, writing, filming, and editing are top-notch. Each time an episode ends, I feel a little sad. I actually miss the characters. I'm intentionally dragging out my viewing of the season to prolong the experience.<br /><br />That said, the five stars are for the show, not for the Amazon product. I have Amazon Prime and was happy to be able to download the season, but several of the episodes had technical difficulties, such as freezing. This required me to rewind, and in some cases, to restart the episode and then fast forward to where I was. I view my streaming content through my Wii, and the rewind/fast forward functions are hard to navigate because you don't get to see the video move backward or forward. You have to watch the timer and make a guess as to when to stop. It's irritating and time-consuming. Also, the picture quality was not great on my nice Sony Bravia HD TV or on my iPad, when I viewed it there. If I had to rate the streaming product, I'd give it three stars.<br /><br />I'm getting ready for Season 3, but I wish my Prime allowed for a free download. I'm not thrilled about having to pay $14.99. But if you haven't yet become a fan of Downton Abbey, give it one try and you will!
B001FW58D6|1.0|This show had a lot of potential but was really soured by the awful acting.  In addition, there were lots of melodramatics and long boring scenes meant to connect the audience with the actors emotionally.  I don't have a problem with this when it fits, but it was very forced in this show.  I would give this show a C for plot and an F execution and acting.
B000089RVX|5.0|I love this CD so much, it is one of those albums that absolutely must stay in my music collection.

B000PDYVVG|5.0|This book really touched me. I really appreciated the author sharing her journey with me. I recommend reading  it. Thanks
B008M721MS|1.0|The worst app I have. Every time, and I mean every time, I get an incoming call Skype crashes! And it wouldn't even surprise me if my Skype crashes during a call. If it crashes while turning on. If it is not reactive at all when I try to call someone. Like there isn't even a ring tone when I call someone do I sit there in awkward silence wondering if I pressed the call button and suddenly my friends voice is on the other side just.... sudden! Or if I am still seeing no reaction once I press the call button I press it twice and then it non stop calls my friend no matter how I try to hang up, I have to turn off my kindle to get it to stop calling!<br />If it aren't for necessity, it would never come back on my kindle I hate this thing so much

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It is a very good book to read to kids.Then my kid would have the  same memory as I have.
1936608898|5.0|I picked up this book about a month ago when I was looking at guidance to adopt a diet that would help me feel better.  I didn't have any serious medical conditions but have started feeling less energetic, more tired, not sleeping well, some recurring joint pain and creeping weight loss that didn't budge no matter what I did.  I've recently been diagnosed as hypothyroid (underactive thyroid) and a lot of that might have been contributing to my feelings, but medication wasn't making me feel better.  Over the last 20+ years I've had seasonal allergies that I even previously had allergy shots and daily allergy pills.<br /><br />So, I decided to do the Whole30 for the month of April 2013--no exceptions, no cheating, just following the guidelines in the book.  So, here we are past the 30 day mark and I cannot get over the results.  I did this &#34;diet&#34; change to help feel better, and I do.  No more joint pain, no more lethargy, more motivation to &#34;move&#34; and be active and I was sleeping GREAT for the first time in a few years.  Even more amazingly, my lifelong allergy problems have disappeared.  No sinus issues, no sneezing and watery eyes due to all the spring pollen in the air--completely unbelieveable and unexpected!  And, although I didn't start this with the goal of losing weight, I'm down 12 pounds in the first 30 days, primarily just by changing the way I eat and walking in my neighborhood a few times a week.  Nothing extreme or unrealistic, nothing that I felt deprived by.<br /><br />That said, is this an EASY change to make eating this way?  In some ways YES and in other ways NO.  It is tough to give up the carbs that I love, but once I started doing it, I felt better within the first week.  THE FIRST WEEK.  So, why not try it for 30 days?  I'm continuing for the next 30, just because it has been the fix that I've been looking for, without medication, and I love how I feel!  If you've been looking for a &#34;fix&#34; for the things I described, thismay be what you've been searching for, just as it was for me.  Good luck!
B00CEF014E|4.0|If you are looking for an authentic short horror/action-adventure book, you should definitely purchase Solstice. This book is filled with a continuous stream of page turning twist's. The author cleverly packed the story with informative details, while keeping the story's momentum at a steady pace.<br /><br />Just when you think Dana is going to give up, she finds an uncanny amount of energy to keep moving forward. During the course of the plot, Dana never underestimate's her gut instincts. She is literally forced into a situation that tests her psychological well-being, passion for loved one's, and survival instincts.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow! This game is great! Just when it starts to get boring you change cities or there are new prizes! Even better on the Kindle FIRE!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is awesome I love it so much and I was never able to put it down. Just AWESOME.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game kept me intrigued from start to finish. It was definitely worth the price. It made me think of movies like the Da Vinci Code and tv shows like Zero Hour.
B008I34ZFW|2.0|I really, really wanted to like this and waited a long time for it to be released, but the effects are the only good part and give them just two stars ( because you can make almost ANY effect on a computer). The story line could have been five star, but turned out lame. Save your money on this!
B00881PTRC|3.0|Overall, I like to play this game like when I'm waiting at an eye, dentist or some other office type place.  I just wish there were animated graphics for every theme.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Twist on the normal match three games makes this one stand out.  Well worth the money.  Special prizes on each level that make the next level a little easier than it would have been.  Fun game!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome. had it for a year now. anyone no when the 7.0 update comes out? hopefully the add Herobrine. best 7.00$ ever spent
B008LY5VHE|5.0|I like that this movie has you on the edge with it's drama screens. I think any one over the age of 12 could enjoy it.<br />If you tend to scare easy.y I would not watch this movie. A few screens with language bleeps but other wise a family movie.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Josh Groban is at his best on this CD!  I especially like &#34;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&#34; and get goosebumps every time I listen to it!<br /><br />Corinne Dickey<br />Birch Bay, WA
B009CGKW10|5.0|This is a nice family movie for all ages over 12 years old. No language bleeps and no sexual screens just some<br />clean scary screens<br />.

B003O86FMW|5.0|This book and the entire series is such an easy read you don't realize how much time has passes while you are reading.  GREAT SERIES!
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I liked this book.  I was a very quick read and quite a bit different from the movie. Definitely worth reading.
B003F5WOEC|3.0|I bought this record after I purchased El Camino because a good friend recommended it.  Not even on the same page as El Camino IMO.  But I do love the fact that Keys always either give you a d/l card or a cd with their vinyl.
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|I had the pleasure of reading the first book in this series, and with how much I loved The Luck of the Weissensteiners, it was tough to wait for this one to come out.  But I did, and it was absolutely and definitely worth the wait.<br /><br />Right now, in literature, we seem to live in a world where the character has faded into the background, and how they look, what special powers they possess, and how much sex they have dominates.  So when I stumble upon a gem like Fischer, I become a pretty fanatical fan.  Character pieces are underrated and under appreciated in this world, and Fischer so brilliantly reminds us why the classic literary novels are, in fact, classics.<br /><br />The characterizations in this book are amazing.  Not just Sebastian, either, but every single person making an appearance in this book has their own, rich, separate lives.  I lost myself instantly in the description and the plot.  The journey was swift, but it was rich and i could see the streets in my head.  I could see the time period so richly, and with every page my heart went out, terrified for the worst and hoping for the best.<br /><br />There's not a lot I can say without giving away the plot, and I don't want to do that because it's such an amazing journey.  We need more books like this.  We need more focus on writers as brilliant as Fischer, who brings back that amazing story-telling without having to give their characters unrealistic beauty and superhuman abilities.<br /><br />Fischer reminds us that everyone is flawed, but it's because of that, that we are such a beautiful species.  It's tough to remember when you're browsing past thousands of vampire novels, but I urge you, even if it's not your thing, pick this book up.  It's not a waste of time.  It's wonderfully told, a way that I could only dream to achieve on the page.<br /><br />My only problem now is waiting for the third book.  Which I will do.  As patiently as I can.<br /><br />This book gets a five stars, only because I can't go higher.  I'm forever a fan of yours, Mr. Fischer, and I can't wait for more!e I can't go higher.  I'm forever a fan of yours, Mr. Fischer, and I can't wait for more!
B008O037RG|3.0|I actually bought this record before I bought their first one : Sigh no more.  The record sounds great and all, I just didn't get any warm and fuzzy feelings about it.
0380977788|5.0|What a deliciously creepy book! I love it. It's full of chills and shivers and nightmarish characters.<br /><br />\\"Coraline\\" is perfect for teens and young adults but it can also be enjoyed by older readers like myself. Certainly Neil Gaiman's fans will love it. This is a fantastic book by a wonderful writer and I can't imagine anyone disliking it.
B0074MZSPO|3.0|I bought this record because I have heard good things from friends.  But to me, it's just okay.  Not quite as energetic as I hoped.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|A great storyline and character descriptions makes this a captivating book that makes it hard to stop reading. Usually not a scifi fan, but this book is recommended even for newbies like me.
B00AO2TREY|5.0|If you liked the first (and if you didn't why are you here?) you'll love this. The second half of the album is more like Happiness- smooth catchy pop with some really astonishingly brilliant numbers (just release &#34;Help&#34; as a single, Hurts, and conquer the world), the real interesting stuff is at the front of the album. Love where these two are going and only wish I knew where they buy their clothes!
B00991TCOG|5.0|Unless I'm listening to a specific album from my digital library I have Pandora on all day in the background while I'm working. I do this because I love the variety it provides, but I have also found that it is a great way to hear music from wonderful artists I don't know existed. Lindsey Stirling was one such discovery. It turned out to be the most delightful surprise! I can't recall which track it was that I heard but right from the start of the song I was hooked! This eclectic and beautiful fusion of classical violin and rock was extremely unique and captivating. I absolutely LOVED the song and used the \\"Buy this album on Amazon\\" feature to learn more about the artist. I listened to all the samples and read the bio and loved every piece of music on the album so much that I just had to buy it. I purchased the CD two weeks ago and I have literally listened to it ten times since then. It's one of those CDs that has become a favorite and I never tire of listening to it. The high-energy tempo and originality of Lindsey's compositions are incredible and it's like catnip to my ear drums. I HIGHLY recommend this CD if you're a fan of classical, rock or dance music. You will not be disappointed.
1451629184|4.0|This was a good book...I purchased it to support Jaycee and everything she has gone through.  What a horrible thing to happen.
0345495004|5.0|I belong to a book club and the leader chose this book.  Before reading this book several years ago I did travel to see one of the houses that Frank Lloyd Wright had designed.  But I didn't know anything about his personal life.  He was a man before his time.  I have already recommened this book to three of my friends.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game so far. If ur new to it you'll love it just get it and play all day just like some peaple
B009MAJYYW|5.0|This album will entertain your passion for all of those James Bond Movies. The quality is excellent and all the original artists and rendetions are included. What is not to like?
B0071PS7AC|4.0|This is the most fun bowling game that I have played on a tablet. The graphics are pretty good, as is the sound.<br /><br />The negatives are that the game has some technical glitches, which pop up, for me, about every ten games or so. It would be nice to see the developer release an update!
075640407X|5.0|The Kingkiller Chronicles are quite possibly my new obsession when it comes to fantasy.  I'm not sure I'd call this &#34;Epic&#34; fantasy, due to the fact that the story revolves mostly around one character.  BUT WHAT A CHARACTER!!!  Sorry.  I'll calm myself.  This story has it all.  Far-off lands? Check.  Unique magic system? BIG CHECK!  Likable main and supporting characters? CHECK CHECK.<br /><br />One of the best things about this is that this book doesn't seem to take itself too seriously.  Now, I do not mean to say that this book is sloppy.  Far from it, in fact.  I mean it doesn't read like so many other fantasy titles out there (LOTR, ASOIAF, etc.).  It takes one point of view, and runs with it.  You follow a present-day Kvothe as he retells this story from his childhood.  From the event that spurred his obsession with finding a band of mythological beings, to the college where he meets an array of lovable and memorable characters, to the ever-growing tension that something horrible in the present-day is just over the horizon.<br /><br />Buy it. Read it. Love it.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|its a great game but I did have to start my game over. I hope I dont have to again, otherwise like I said it's a great game.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I really have enjoyed the books that I have read so far from this app<br />Thanks for letting me enjoy them for free.
1476734941|4.0|I am currently reading this book and will try it.  I  have been on Weight Watchers like forever and it is just a yo-yo for me.  Let's see how this goes.
B002PYW26Y|5.0|What a great movie. It has action, comedy, and romance. I think is a great movie remake of the original
B003L77G10|5.0|This is my favorite drama.  I can't get enough of the characters and court room drama.  I love the mysterious Kalinda and enjoy the other characters, too.  Julianna Margulies is fantastic and is proving to be a very strong woman with real big issues regarding career, marriage, and her uncertain future with Peter.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|Action packed with a great storyline that meshes well with the previous movies.  Wonderful acting and visually attractive.  A must have to round out the Bourne collection!
B0053O89WY|5.0|TBBT is my favorite comedy.  The characters are hilarious and the show is very well-written.  I have also learned more than I ever have about physics.  Sheldon is the best character on TV and I absolutely love him.
B00C7JG0KG|1.0|If Amazon's description of this \\"Oz\\" package is that of ONLY the 3-D BD version with no 2-D BD, then Disney can put this package where, as they say, the sun don't shine. Shame on them!!! They've gotten more and more avaricious over the years, like their corporate fat cats, and have lost touch with those of us of a less money-engorged class. Count on me, Disney, one of the biggest supporters of 3-D, to watch you try to  kill 3-D with this antic; I will wait for the film to hit one of my premium channels, if ever. I can live without it if it doesn't. You've forgotten who you are, Disney. Walt must be spinning in his grave.
B003FSTN52|5.0|Alisha Florrick is one tough woman.  I admire her strength in the face of the humiliation her husband has put her through.  Julianna Margulies plays this character with class and toughness.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was excellent.  Didn't lose interest like I often do with books in a series.  I just wish this was the erotic book that was being made into a movie!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My kids like the fact that this game used a great deal of trail and error-reasoning. i like them problem solving.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Love this book!  It's so well written and totally envelopes you.  I love the way historical situations and figures are interwoven into the story.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Just before the invasion of Iraq, when walking through his Marines camp Logan Thibault found a picture of a lovely young girl with a keep safe message on the back. Despite posting it as missing, it was not claimed so he kept it with him during 3 dangerous tours in Iraq.  During that time he survived gun battles and several roadside bomb explosions with only minor injuries. He, and others, started to believe that his survival was due to the picture which was his lucky charm.<br /><br />After Iraq his best buddy tells him \\"There is a greater purpose to all of this. It is your destiny (to find her).\\"  After a bad start Logan sets out with his faithful German Shepherd, Zeus, on a long walk from from Colorado to Hampton, North Carolina where he hopes to find the woman in the picture.<br /><br />When he gets there he discovers Elizabeth, the woman in his lucky picture who has a great son and a terrible ex-husband.  The pages sparkle with an exciting and different family romance.<br /><br />Sparks is a consummate storyteller of mainstream romance novels that don't involve the steamy and coming of age  problems of so much contemporary \\"romance\\" (sexually based and immature) fiction. I have enjoyed several of Sparks books including this one, but my main worry was that the finish of this one was too fast.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I loved this story.  This is one of those books you can't put down.  It was well written and I love the way historical events are woven into the story.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series!  Can't get over the ending of Season 3 though!  Can't wait to see where they go with Season 4!
B004SIP9B0|4.0|I saw this film on a whim. I had a little motivation (as it's an Oscar nominee for Best Picture) but no overwhelming desire to see it.<br /><br />Well, now I can't imagine not having seen this film. The Princess Diana story has never been something with which I've been familiar or affected. But I was captivated every single minute. The fragility of the royal family's public support and perception was a particularly interesting bit I've never considered before.<br /><br />Dynamite performances round out what is one of the most pleasant cinematic surprises I've encountered.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book keeps you turning the pages with anticipation and fear at times of what's coming next. It holds your attention page by page
B0029LCJJS|5.0|While some may want to group this show into the (informal, unofficial, and misnamed) &#34;sex and sandals&#34; genre, it transcends that title. Season 1 of 'The Tudors' is simply one of the best seasons of television you can watch.<br /><br />I've always been interested in this period of history, but I am not a history buff; the show is very accessible for both students and non-students of history.<br /><br />It features an extremely talented cast, terrific writers, and a great opening theme: what more could you want! &#34;An intriguing story.&#34; An intriguing story, you say? Well, the real drama that inspired this show is considered by many to be extremely important for western civilization, and the show does a fine job of setting the stakes.<br /><br />A must-watch for those who enjoy TV dramas.
B0091THRCU|5.0|I have used this sleeve for a few days now and like it very much.  It is slim in the pocket and ejects the iPhone quickly with a clever pull tab when you need to use it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love the characters in this series.  It's exciting and captivating.  I can hardly wait to watch Season 3 (obviously I'm way behind as it's been out for awhile).
B003HV0TN2|5.0|Such a colourful read - unlike George RR Martin - i only read a couple of chapters per night and don't feel the urge to find out what comes next... having said that I feel it was a great find to have found this author
B001BKTEZA|5.0|This will be the third time of read this book. First time on Kindle. They just don't write 'em like this any more.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I started seeing the results of my work out after about 2-3 weeks. The great thing about this program is that you can easily do it everyday. There are no excuses to skip your work out if its only 25 minutes long. What I love about these workouts is that all the exercises are combination moves so that you are maximizing your time (working arms and legs at the same time). I also like the fact that you do not need a lot of room or equipment (maybe hand weights) and that's it. NO EXCUSES!
B00BGD8CFK|5.0|Very nice and sleek.  I was skeptical of how well it would protect the phone if I dropped it, but it I've dropped it multiple times and there are no breaks/scratches.  I LOVE how slim the cover is.  Fits the phone perfectly.  I've received many compliments on the case.  I highly recommend this.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This series is honestly the best series I have ever read. I love this series. Robert Jordan was an awesome writer and Brandon Sanderson is really good too. If you like Brandon Sanderson then read The Way of Kings. I cannot say a bad thing about this series other than it took a long time to finish, but not that they are all out that doesn't matter. Read the series, it is better than LOTR and the Chronicles of N.
B0044WQHA2|5.0|American Graffiti is a piece of art that symbolizes a very special time in San Francisco Bay Area and American pop culture. Rock roll was newly born and running strong, and Wolf Man Jack, possibly Americas greatest DJ ever ruled the Northern California airwaves. The movie is a must see for Bay Area natives over 40 and anybody else who would celebrate the early days of rock roll and the youth culture it gave birth too
B003DZX44I|5.0|I grew up watching Beauty and the Beast and know the story by heart. I love the story. I love the characters. And I love how the movie is just so damn good after over 20 years of it's release date. Honestly, what's not to like or love about this movie.<br /><br />As for the blu-ray, the color saturation is sharper and more crisp, but it's still the same film. You have the option to watch the theatrical version (which I prefer, personally) or the extended edition that's about roughly 10 extra minutes of new scenes. The extended edition is... okay. In that version, there was a new musical scene added called &#34;I Can't Wait to be Human Again&#34;. I remember seeing that in I-MAX theaters in Charleston back when I was in 7th grade. I understood the directors and other crew members of the film wanted to add that scene long ago when the movie was in production, but couldn't. Don't know why, but I still feel like the original version still holds up. I felt like the theatrical version was so perfect in its own way it didn't need anything. If added anything it would have ruined the film overall. This is my opinion, obviously, but for those who love the extended version that's fine. I just like this original piece just as it is. There's tons of new video commentaries about the making of the film, which I'm deeply fascinated to know more about the animators, directors, etc...<br /><br />I also have to add this to my comment. My biggest and highest praised criticism I give to this film is the musical score of Beauty and the Beast. Alan Menken is incredibly gifted for making original musical pieces for most of the '90's disney films, like The Little Mermaid, Aladdin, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Pochahontas, and most recently Tangled. His gift in music writing and orchestration delivers an atmostphere that brings the kid in a lot of us. Whichever movie you like that had Menken's score done to it, Beauty and the Beast not only had a great score, but also some of the most memorable, and delivering songs still adored by audiences today.<br /><br />It's a great movie with great songs. What can I say except I love Beauty and the Beast and it'll forever be a movie that I'll cherish and treasure years to come.ble, and delivering songs still adored by audiences today.<br /><br />It's a great movie with great songs.

B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Movie has a lot of action and thrills. Acting is even up on a par with some of the best. I liked seeing Batman as being human and having some weaknesses. The only down side to this movie was not the movie itself, but Amazon streaming that had about 5 minutes of glitches during the last ten minutes of the movie.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I think playing this game without background music makes me play more better ;) I luv this game :)<br /> I am happy for this app to be free thank u
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great acting, a plot and story that moved and plenty of action. Even the slow parts kept your interest with a good story line. With twists and action this was Quentin Tarantino at his best. Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio were stellar.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Love the story.  Saw it at the theater last summer and it sticks with me.  An amazing story of finding someone that should have been a superstar for his creativity but was finally found by a quest from South African people.  His music had been popular there for years.

0385344228|4.0|I hated Jacob and would have preferred to rub his cocksure attitude into the sand, knock him over the head with a shovel, and then bury him with said object about six feet under. He's more emotionless void than passionate Picasso, and he feels absolutely no responsibility for his actions. That's your typical teenager, at least on the latter, but not having a heart is not exactly what I strive toward every day of my life. And yet I ended up completely immersed in legalese and legal suspense.<br /><br />William Landay has a knack for plotting novels, or at least based on the merits of DEFENDING JACOB. The spoon-fed trial details, the slipping between the present and the past almost effortlessly, the family history that comes out later like a pissed off reptile, and the emotional struggle to hold a family together even as it's being torn apart all make for one glorious read. And yet he takes nearly 431 pages to answer one basic question: Is Jacob guilty or not? If you peel back all the emotional layers and struggles and doubts and accusations, that's the bottom line. To put it mildly, he does it really, really well.<br /><br />Andy Barber doesn't want to answer this question. He doesn't want to believe he could have made an error raising his son; instead, he chooses to focus on the goodness and righteousness that he sees every day in Jacob. He'll do whatever it takes to defend his boy, even if it means lying or circumventing the truth or covering up details along the way. But then I'm the kind of person who thinks celebrities and other public figures should act in a professional, civic manner, and I hold myself to the same standards that I hold others to (often to be disappointed by said individuals somewhere along the way). None of that detracted from my overall reading experience, though. It just gave me a few additional thought molecules.<br /><br />But I will say I didn't like the ending. Even though it doesn't change my rating, I would have been happier had the book ended about 30 pages sooner. Sure, it was an excellent twist, but it's not one I was particularly happy about.<br /><br />Robert Downs<br />Author of Falling Immortality: Casey Holden, Private Investigatorok ended about 30 pages sooner.

B00CEF014E|4.0|The characters aren't very fleshed out but the situations build up nicely and come to fruition with quite the entertaining finish.  Some twists and turns were very transparent and expected, but some were very good.  All told, this is a good read.

B0037VNX44|5.0|I could not stop watching.  It was an amazing film on someones true life.  I looked it up on Wikipedia after and read the real story.
B008E374PO|4.0|This started as a comment on another review, but I am going to expand slightly to a review.  Ocean Eyes is still Adam's best album, and I also agree with the comments that the lyrics on Ocean Eyes were very original and whimsical.<br /><br />I think many of those Ocean Eyes songs were musically brilliant. I could play \\"If My Heart Was a House\\" \\"Meteor Shower\\" \\"Strawberry Avalanche\\" and \\"Fireflies\\" (and more!) in an infinite loop for six hours and just be lost in it. The music on Midsummer Station just doesn't reach to that level.  This isn't to say that there are not good songs on Midsummer Station.  But some of the songs on Ocean Eyes were at a level of originality, quality, and variety that I see maybe a few times in a decade.  There are genuinely moments on Ocean Eyes where I wonder if Adam Young descended from Mozart.  The bar is just set so high....<br /><br />Regarding the whimsical lyrics on Ocean Eyes, those are mostly gone on Midsummer Station.  It feels like either they forced Adam to team with another songwriter, or alternately Adam is trying to learn to write poetry in a more pop style. Either way, the lyrics lack the magical and whimsical qualities of Ocean Eyes.<br /><br />However, I have an inverted view of the lyrics on Ocean Eyes. What I have realized is that many of those songs had a perfect meter for pure poetry. If Adam had teamed up with a truly brilliant lyricist / romantic poet, they could have developed a set of sonnets, love poems/songs that would have been remembered for decades.  So definitely there is an opportunity to partner with a lyricist, but it has to be someone who is great and a pure romantic, otherwise why bother.  You cannot pair the Mozart of Electronica music with a Mickey Mouse lyricist and get anything better than Disney Channel music.  The lyrics on the latest album are a regression. They are not brilliant metered poetry, nor are they the whimsical creative lyrics of Ocean Eyes.<br /><br />Some of the songs like \\"Take It All Away\\" do however show real emotional power and emotional authenticity (in the style of a Taylor Swift).  I almost wonder if if \\"Take It All Away\\" is about Taylor Swift given the whacky history with Taylor writing Adam Young a pretty direct and very public love song \\"Enchanted\\" on her \\"Speak Now\\" album.  Then it appears she basically gave Adam a cold shoulder when he responded.  Hang tough Adam, that would be a tough sequence for any man.  But even \\"Take It All Away\\" needs the power of a more complete poet to fill out the lyric.<br /><br />Adam needs to do a reset. He is young and musically brilliant. Let's see if he can do it.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|I didn't even know he was a musician! I saw this and bought it on a whim and it's great. I loved his show and I love the music.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|This is one of those movies that stand the test of time.  A good story and gorgeous actors.  Paul Newman and Robert Redford together, doesn't get much better than that.  Funny and poignant.  A must watch for every movie lover.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|When I read the reviews for this book, I was expecting a thrilling mystery with lighthearted comedy. Though I did chuckle out loud throughout, I was painfully aware of how much was left of each chapter as the story seemed to drag on after a while. I really enjoyed the historical fiction side-story and not until this part became more prevalent was I really intrigued. I think the book gets kind of monotonous toward the end and I was annoyed at how predictable the ending was - everything seemed to wrap up too neatly! I did sympathize with the characters and Allan's philosophical notions that were dropped into his sentences were a pleasant addition. Overall, the characters were well developed and the story could have gone somewhere wild but I think it just fell short a little bit. That being said, I did enjoy reading it but by the end of it was keen on starting another book.
B002U3CB5M|5.0|I have also read Angels Game and Prisoner of Heaven. This is the best and Prisoner would be my second choice. It was intrigue and love and totally written so well.<br />I have just returned from following this novel on a tour in Barcelona. Fabulous.

B0050DZN4K|5.0|As the news of google reader closing I started looking for apps to use to change from rss feed reader. I liked the interface is clean and neat and similar to google as a plus the reader also has add-ons for Chrome Firefox etc. that lets you open the reader. It loads fast and syncs in all places.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is great for listening to any distant, weak, or obsure broadcast you like. I was listening to my favorite Birds & Nature show within 2 minutes of downloading! Not possible from my radio since it's a weak AM station. Crystal clear digital. Nice.<br /><br />A great app.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It's a great game especially since it's free i have fun my dad has fun my brothers have fun so trust me this game is worth it

It's Angry Birds, and a bunch of new levels -- yaaaaaaaaaaaayy! But sure, playing against online opponents sounds fun too. If you're a fan or AB, then this is another 'must have.'

B00899E5B4|5.0|I can't say it's better then Rocky Mountain Way but hey I heard that when it first came out so it's always been one of my favorites. But this really is a fantastic album. If you want to literally see for yourself check out episode 60 on Live From Daryl's House, they play Wrecking Ball.<br /><br />If you love Joe Walsh you'll love this album!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really didn't think out was gonna be this fun. It's a pretty fun game. Maybe a different song every once in a while would be nice.

B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I gave this five stars because I was immediately drawn in.  There are great plots and fascinating characters.  Worth a watch!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A sad tale of cruelty to children is interwoven with the stories of two adults trying to find their place in the grand scheme of things and a bit of happiness and belonging. The ending is surprising and satisfying. Having visited Ireland, the setting and the characters feel real. I would recommend this as a good read about the best and worst of human nature.
B00136Q1XA|5.0|I've always loved this album. I purchased it originally when it came out in the 70's on vinyl. Sounds stupendous on MP3!
B0070DOHQS|4.0|This app was the faotd so I took a chance. It works amazingly and is not hard to set up. The only problem is that it deleted Java and wont let u run it until this program is deleted. Otherwise a good app.

B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This game was a great way to spend a rainy afternoon. Bonus for the fact that the hidden object scenes were not to hard but not overly challenging.
006082543X|5.0|Gave this to my 9 year old grandaughter. She reads<br />it over and over. Proud to have her on copy.
B0000714BP|5.0|I had never seen this and my boss was talking about it and i looked it up, was a great price and had to have it. Very glad i bought it.
B001I10ABE|5.0|I just got this in the mail today and listened to it right away....it's awesome in sound,package and detail!I think its so funny that someone on here writes about not having a 45 record player to play this on...hahahaha!how can you be a vinyl lover and buyer and not have a 45 player or at least a 3 speed player in one!Duh!!Well anyways also Nothing else matters sounds just fine on my system!Its all good buyers...pick this gem up if you love your metal on wax!!!Now i wanna watch some Beavis and butthead!Huhuhuhhehehe!!
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|The voice of Susan Boyle is powerful and diminuative.  She sounds like every note is considered as to how she will sing it.<br />This kind of control is intelligent and engages me every time I hear it.
B008RTE08E|1.0|I was reared on The Beatles. My mother grew up in the 50s and 60s, and I have listened to all The Beatles' albums and songs. I have their first two feature films, and they were fantastic. But this one is just horrible. I know this was the beginning of the downfall of Beatles when Paul started taking control of the band. And I'd bought this DVD for nostalgia's sake. But I'm regretting it now because it's overall just awful. Not even when I'm high or on drugs would I enjoy this film.<br /><br />If you're a hardcore COLLECTOR of The Beatles, then by all means buy this. But if you're a casual fan who was reared on the Beatles, it is not worth it. Just get all the albums and the first two feature films.
B005WYFLNU|5.0|It's in good quality,and I find my daughter can stay for almost an hour to decorate these princesses. She kept changing clothes for the three girls and started to draw their dresses. It's a wonderful sticker pad!
0061950726|5.0|Two women from different eras but with similar life stories.  How will that friendship progress?<br /><br />You will be mesmerized by this book that is based on a true part of American history.  ORPHAN TRAIN has magnificent detail and a wonderful storyline.  I was pulled in within five pages. The two alternating time periods telling about the lives of Vivian and Molly is beautifully told. They are two appealing and well-developed characters that you want to know more about and won't be disappointed in what you find.<br /><br />This book addresses the life of orphans who arrived in the Midwest in the late 1920's on the orphan train that originated in New York and how they are treated as second class citizens by most of the adopted families.  It is told with enthusiasm and genuine compassion along with the detailing of feelings.<br /><br />You will feel the despair and helplessness of \\"Dorothy\\" as she moves from one household to another with the second one being worse than the first. The beautiful prose carries you along.  It makes you think about what is important in life and what you should keep with you and what you should leave behind and let go.<br /><br />This book will pull at your heart strings and keep you up because you won't want to stop reading.  It brings two generations together each with good and bad memories to share.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading about a part of history I wasn't aware of and with the added bonus of  Ms. Kline's incredible writing style.<br /><br />Don't miss this splendid book.  You will fall in love with both main characters and wish you could be there with them as you learn about a not-often discussed part of American history. 5/5<br /><br />This book was given to me free of charge and without compensation by the publisher in return for an honest review.
B007REV4T8|5.0|received when it supposed to come and was in good shape and the movie was great. One of the best bond movies

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The story is somewhat slow to unfold however is quite good.  The end is very heartwarming. I'd give an A-  .
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|A glimpse into pure evil and its effects on human spirit. Free Palestine? Fee North Korea too. I guess the UN has more noble busywork.
B004WR125O|3.0|not so easy to use it took forever for it to pick-up my network it was a fight to get it to work
B000EHSVQ4|5.0|The director's cut is by far the superior version of this film.  Director Ridley Scott delivers one of the most gripping character driven epics in recent memory.  The sets and costumes are absolutely stunning and Orlando Bloom gives the performance of his career, proving his quality as a leading man.  There is just the right balance between history and dramatization, between action and character development.  It is one of the most ambitious projects of it's time and the 45+ extra minutes in the directors cut puts in in the running for best film of that year, and amongst Scott's best works of all time.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Not quite a Western. Maybe a Southern? Definitely worth watching. Quentin Tarantino hasn't disappointed me yet. I regret not seeing this one in theaters.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|\\"The things that knock you down in life are tests, forcing you to make a choice between giving in and remaining on the ground or wiping the dirt off and standing up even taller than you did before you were knocked down. \\"<br /><br />RECAP<br /><br />Sky Linden Davis, has always lived a sheltered life with her mother. With not being allowed to have any technology around Sky spends her time with her best friend Six and reading. But she also spends her night making out with boys to just escape the real life and feel \\"numb\\". But senior year its different, after coercing her mother to allow her to attend public school Sky realizes what the world really hold outside her home walls. One of those realizations is Dean Holder.<br /><br />Holder has spent the year in a state of despair. He didn't lose one girl he loved, he lost two. So he does what guys do best, he rebels. When Sky shows up on his radar Holders life changes drastically, he knows she looks familiar. He takes it upon himself to get to know her. Even if getting to know her turns out to hurt both of them.<br /><br />When secrets unfold will Sky and Holder be able deal with them? Or will the secrets destroy both their lives?<br /><br />MY TAKE<br /><br />Okay, this book came highly recommended by numerous book lovers so I couldn't wait to get into it.  I was ready for the romance, the angst, the tears, and the secrets unveiling. I was ready and prepared to love this. And I did enjoy the story and the premise of it. I saw the twist coming a mile away but I still enjoyed learning all of the facts and all about the characters.<br /><br />Sky is completely sheltered from social media, television and cell phones. She was a teenager starting to learn how to find her way in life. I liked her character at the beginning of the book and loved her inter-dialogue. The turn in that changed when she became consumed with Holder. Don't get me wrong who wouldn't enjoy Holder? But I just thought she had more of a backbone in the beginning when she didn't \\"need\\" him for everything. This is not to say that I didn't feel bad about what happened. Even though I saw it coming I was still sad for what she had to go through and for her having to relive it.<br /><br />What I loved is their connection with each other.  \\"It's what happens when two people become one: they no longer only share love. They also share all of the pain, heartache, sorrow, and grief.\\" Holder was the perfect rock and perfect person to help her through the devastation, even if he kept secrets. Both characters feel hopeless during the book but both together bring hope to each other.  Holder shows, not only Sky, but himself as well, how to live, how to ask questions even if the answers are scary, and how to always have hope.<br /><br />Then there are the secondary characters that play a part in this book. Six,  yes that's her name, is Sky's best friend and although she's gone most of the book she is on of those friends that is a bad influence but honest and faithful to the core. Six's words to Sky set the stage for this story which is why her character made such an impact, \\"Not everyone gets a happily ever after. Life is real and sometimes it's ugly and you just have to learn how to cope.\\"  Breckin, the new best friend in the whole wide world, is awesome and such a sweetheart. He is nonjudgmental and is present when needed. Karen, Sky's mom, I just can't say how much I adored her. She was your typical protective mother but her story in this book is so heartbreaking. Her strength, her courage, her love for Sky is what a mother's love should always be.<br /><br />This book is filled with love, loss, and pain. The only reason this was a 4 star is because Sky's character annoyed me at parts, her reactions were a little selfish and judgmental, and I thought the book was a little too drawn out. But don't miss out on this story.<br /><br />BUY it. READ it. LOVE it.<br /><br />HAPPY READING!!inning when she didn't \\"need\\" him for everything.

B009R659L8|5.0|I love Mary Higgins Clark books.  Some folks get tired of the same author and I have as well, but I read everything she writes.  I can usually figure out the bad person(s), before the end of the story, but her books can fool me.  I think that is why I keep coming back!
1616960922|5.0|my husband is a huge sanderson fan, so I bought this for him as a just because gift. he said this was probably the best short story he has ever read. I would trust his assessment since he is an avid reader. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of fantasy.

B002WV5A9G|4.0|loved this movie. nothing is a good as the original but this did it justice.  The acting was great, love the little Spock romance thrown in....it's about time for him, lol.

B001F12J48|5.0|I can't believe what a deal this move was. I didn't realize until I unwrapped the disc, but this product contains both the advertised 3D blue-ray and the 2D widescreen version! I paid $8.50. The standard widescreen version was nearly $20 on its own. It was actually cheaper to buy the two pack, which also comes with the 3D blue-ray.<br /><br />It also comes with 4 pair of those red/blue paper 3D glasses. I didn't get them to work. I also couldn't get the 3D film to work. Most likely a problem with the settings that I have yet to remedy.<br /><br />The 2D version was awesome. This is a wonderful Christmas movie. I am more a fan of the older Christmas films, since Christmas is an old time tradition, but this movie was surprisingly great.

I would recommend picking it up. I know I'm glad I did.

B00866H7SS|3.0|I was very disappointed it was a complete copy of fifty shades.  i found i didnt warm to the characters as i did in Fifty shades. I gave it 3 because even tho I was frustrated with it I still finished it.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I could read it by hours, even though I have got a little baby. It was easy to find some time for reading. The characters are so real like they are your neibhors, the hopes and wishes too. It's amazing how your own self-esteem can grow up a but hier, because you realize that you can percept things like a main hero - thinking that you are not quite good enough, and trying and trying to be better for some people... when you are already so amazing and lovable. I could distinguish this idea and more - to feel it through my heart - by reading this book. It's one of that books that can change your life a bit, and  somehow change your  vision
B003B02O3C|4.0|Traditional southern law and scandal of JG. Set in early 90s so some of the salaries and such are comical by 2013 standards. Read if you like his classic stuff.

B00CHILW64|3.0|I think the main value of this film is the awareness and reminder of the scale and magnitude of what happened in Thailand. The story line and the acting are mediocre, but still worth seeing.

B007QDNKQA|4.0|This is a good movie for action and behind the scenes of being a sniper.  Predictable but still a good watch.
B0044RUSZM|5.0|What can I say? This stand looks good and does the job, as advertised. I haven't had any problems. It was a good buy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I started reading this at the recommendation of my 12 year old grandson. I figured it would be a quick read and give us something to share and talk about. It was so much more. I read it in one day, not because it was just literary fluff but because I was on the edge of my seat. I will definitely order the next two books.
B008XG1X18|5.0|The only way to make Pinterest better is to make it portable... Wow, so much fun to have it on my Kindle. My addiction just hit a new level!
B00BPQYWSO|5.0|Other than the oddly placed \\"other\\" singer on this release, it's pretty much the bizness. What's up with no download code when you spend $25+ for the vinyl though? Annoying... I'm hoping that I'm just missing something and Polydor isn't getting stingy.
B0095P33IW|5.0|This is a great movie. Right up near the top of my favorite comic book movies. They stayed true to the story and kept the characters true. :)

B000YCLRBA|5.0|Onegin is contemptible. A self-pitying narcissist, Don Giovanni without even the false nobility of defiance. On one hand, one can be gratified that the tale includes no Faustian Repentence/Redemption, so beloved of 19th C adolescence. On the other, one can feel aggrieved that the despicable jerk doesn't end the opera with a suicide. And that leaves the key question: why did such asinine heroes appeal to Romantic writers, composers, and audiences, from Goethe's mawkish Werther almost to the present?<br /><br />Alexander Puskin's poem is a revered classic of Russian literature. Unfortunately, I can't read Russian and therefore have no idea how closely or amply the opera libretto by Tchaikovsky and Shilovsky represents the poem. The libretto is stock Victorian melodrama. That doesn't, of course, distinguish it from many other popular 19th and early 20th C operas, most of which depend on passionate music to rescue their stories from banality.<br /><br />Is Tchaikovsky's music passionate enough? Forgive me, dear reader, but to my ears it's mere humdrum bandshell Heldenwhoopy. The only portion of the opera that affects me emotionally is the soliloquy of the poet Lenski as he confronts his almost-certain death in a duel with his \\"friend\\" Onegin. Lenski is another Romantic caricature, a fool but a likable one. The role is sung and acted, on this DVD, by Ram&oacute;n Vargas; both acting and singing are superb enough to justify the whole 156 minutes of the production. It's the singing and acting that earn my five-star rating of the DVD, rather than the opera per se. Dmitri Hvorostovsky is the very avatar of the arrogant selfish Onegin. Ren&eacute;e Fleming makes herself believable both as the puppy-love provincial maiden Tatiana and as the mature self-dominating faithful wife Tatiana. Extraordinary singing can redeem almost any mawkish text.<br /><br />And the \\"film\\" is beautiful. Fleming and Hvorostovsky are sensual bliss in close-ups. The \\"sets\\" are utterly minimal -- a floor covered with scattered autumn leaves, bare walls, a few chairs -- but perfectly conceived to frame the gorgeous costumes, expressive faces, and well-directed choreography of the singer-actors' movements. The color coordination, from the lush orange and auburn of the first act to the brooding blues and somber blacks of later scenes, seems more artful to my eyes than any amount of costly clutter.<br /><br />I know this is an ambivalent review. But it's sincere. Eugene Onegin is a perennial favorite of opera audiences. There must be something more to the music than my ears perceive. Conductor Valery Gergiev can't be held accountable for my taste; he elicits very fine instrumental timbres and tight ensemble from the Met Opera Orchestra. If you consider yourself - in your madness - a \\"serious opera lover,\\" Eugene Onegin is an opera you must hear and see at least once, and this is as artful a performance of it as anyone could demand.ith scattered autumn leaves, bare walls, a few chairs -- but perfectly conceived to frame the gorgeous costumes, expressive faces, and well-directed choreography of the singer-actors' movements.

B00CL68QVQ|1.0|This is proof positive that Hollywood has imploded.  Best Actress?  Are you joking?  She has one character and it worked in Hunger Games, but it is just sad and broken in this movie. You might feel good if your life is also sad and pathetic, but I had to turn it off half way because it was a boring, predictable and far too unrealistic to carry any emotional weight.  Cooper's character should be in prison, for many years and Lawrence should be walking the streets covered in tracks.  Just gross.<br /><br />I would have thought Cooper would have had better script access, wtf?
B00479SVBU|5.0|Exactly like what is written in descreption, exactly looks like the pectuer, exactly like what I expected and i need.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|I just love this movie, and am so glad to finally have it at home!  I especially enjoyed the references to some of the older arcade games - who doesn't love Pacman and Q-Bert!?
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|very good. liked the hunger game , that was the best of the series.The Mockingjay was a let down. but at lest it gave closure.
B004I744AS|5.0|Great simple dictionary. right at the TOP first line type your word in; so easy.  IF you choose to use them it also gives a &#34;word of the day&#34; with speaker pronunciation; an interesting &#34;Article of the Day&#34;; &#34;Quote of the Day&#34;; &#34;This day in History&#34;, &#34;Today's birthday&#34;; and &#34;In the News&#34;.  If you enter your birth date one time you get a &#34;Horoscope&#34; and there are 4 different word games can be used by all ages.  Spelling bee has 3 difficulty levels, hangman easy, Match Up harder.  Great for learning new words. SUPER application and it is free, there are ads but with the features in this app it is worth it.<br /><br />You can enter your Zip code and it will give you your daily weather report for a week.  I have checked against the computer and newspaper and it is right on.

B004GYNPL2|3.0|Ughhh...  Yet another developer that thinks their app is so important that it needs to load at startup.<br /><br />Too bad really, as the app was working just fine before it got so greedy and invasive.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Great box set.  Works perfectly with my US player.  Nothing to worry about this being the UK version.  Kind of interesting to hear it called the Philosopher's Stone and not the Sorcerer's.
B00821OX98|4.0|It keeps you watching. Special effects, very good. Suspenseful, keeps you on the end of your seat. But, stay in your seat because you must follow it closely to know what is going on. Can be a little disjointed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Addictive, can't stop reading. I had to find out what was to come and how this trilogy would end. Great book, I recommend it to men and women.
B006LSZECO|1.0|I found this book to be vulgar and it even without that to deal with, the story was pointless!  I wonder how it made it to the Best Seller list, again it is a very trashy book about trashy people
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was a hard book to put down. This is an amazing trilogy and I highly recommend it to both men and women. It's a great read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was nothing I expected it to be! I had read the description multiple times and had seen the cover, but I was never too interested. Then a friend said she had read it and loved it so I gave it a try. It was fantastic! Took a turn of events to something I was not even expecting! Very gripping and fantastic! Just goes to show - don't judge a book by it's cover!
B009DH2PP4|4.0|Good reference guide with great detail for the brewer to understand the chemical, organic and metallic considerations when brewing.<br /><br />I wish that I had bought the book and not the Kindle edition, so that I could use that charts and graphs. They are adjusted for the screen and difficult to follow.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|&quot;I am nothing&quot; Abby the main character responds to a question when asked if shes not a girl what is she, its sad devastating answer whcih answers the question if you were frozen at the age of twelve for centuries exist only after sundown and must feed on blood to survive how lonly and sad is your existance? Truly one of the most unforgettable films I have ever seen the atmosphere, music are top notch. The creepiest part of this is how it mixes absolute horrific actions by Abby and makes you geniunley feel for her and Owens deep lonliness. Abby  played by Chole Grace Mortez is fantastic in a part where its not important of how much she says to owen but how and what little she information she gives to owen which makes the movie even more sad and more creepy. An absolute fantastic scene done even better then the original was when Abby enters owens apartment uninvited at his prompting even after she asks owen to let her in or invite her in I should say, he doesnt she enters and starts bleeding from her eyes and body and owen yells I invite you come in she collapses owen grabs and hugs her weakened body and asks here what is that?  Abby answers I dont know, this is what makes the movie so sad and tragic she really doesnt know why she is what she is . You dont need to be a vampire lover to like this movie in fact if you hate the subject you might also like this however a great many people will find it too slow too dark, if you love sad sweet and occasionally the horrific this one might be for you it is not easily forgettable due to a haunting score fantastic acting by both main characters. One of my all time favorite films, both versions let me in and let the right one are fantastic and evveryone should see both as there aspects in each that are one better, I think and stress think I like let the right one in just a tad better but it depends on the mood, movies that is about a very unlikely and special relationship that happens to include vampires, even if u hate the vampire angle see it its sad sweet and haunting.e the vampire angle see it its sad sweet and haunting.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I will spend the rest of my life practicing being kind rather than right.  Worth the entire book (which was highly entertaining, by the way) just to get this lesson in being a better person.  I recommend this book without reservation.
1582701709|5.0|The secret has been known by so many people over the generations, maybe not by this name, but it is truth/faith/belief.  You can see it in your own life and the lives of others.  This book will be a gift to all of my grandchildren at an early age. The DVD is also very good.
B00BG4UWPC|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect - more of the latest without acknowledging the early albums, or something new entirely?  Thankfully, Bankrupt! takes everything you love about the band, whether you're a long-time fan or someone who just discovered them, and rolls it up into a brand new direction of awesome!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|The application here seem endless. I use it for so much. I archive all of my articles and reading. I make my grocery list and have my wife edit or add on the fly and it updates for me. Take pictures of anything and becomes searchable text. No more business cards. Just picture, store, and done. My friend archives every beer he has ever tasted. He rates them and is at over 800. Webclipper is my best friend for saving anything. I just love this app and how much it betters my life. I don't worry at all about the disclaimers.
B00846REIS|2.0|A complete knock off of 50 Shades! Only 30% of the way through the book and would suggest 50 Shades over Bared to You. I am shocked the story can be so similar and it be okay to print.
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun game. Downloaded it to pass some time. Requires a fast reactions and reflexes. Just turning left and right and ducking and jumping. Simple and fun. And with little boosts and things that can help you along the way.
B008JFUO4U|2.0|This movie made me have alot of hope that it would be an awsome, action packed man VS alien movie...I was wrong. This movie had long bouts of nothing but borring waistland and broke down security drones, the action parts might as well have not even happened because they only shot at drones, and really not to much involving aliens of any sort. I think they put more money into the speacial effects of the water syphoners than the rest of the movie. Long, drawn out yawn fest. Watch at your own risk of putting brain cells in peril. Also, why have someone like Morgan Freeman and you hardly even see him in the movie. They should have more \\"HOSTILE\\" aliens involved, and actual fights with the \\"alien insurgeants\\". This movie is not close to living up to the hype. I went with 3 friends....2 of us fell asleep. I see Tom Cruize is accepting any scripts for money, and not worried about the meat in the movie, shame. If you saw this movie and expected awsome....I am sorry that you had to endure this snore fest.
B001AITH50|5.0|Some movies you can just watch again, and find something new every time. This is one of those movies. Hadn't seen it in years but streamed it and watched with my wife and liked it just as much as the first time.
B003NX76BM|5.0|Nora Roberts has done it again. I absolutely loved The Search. Fiona was a wonderfully developed and easy to love character and so was Simon. One thing about this book that was great to my mind was that even the secondary characters were so easy to love. It seems that Roberts spent just as much time developing those characters as she did the main characters. The dogs in this book were not just in parts of the story, they were a constant throughout the story and were written as best friends for Fee. Loved the entire book!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun because, they always change it up and do.different things with it each month  which won't make you board it's kind of addicting

B00632HWOG|1.0|I have worked with Yahoo for years, but that time has ended. It has become obvious that  the administrative folks don't give squat about privacy nor do they care about controlling unwanted junk mail.  I don't know about anyone else but my junk mail (spam) has quintupled over the last year.  I've had enough and have moved my mail to a different provider and the spam has stopped. PERIOD. I tried to address my concerns with Yahoo, but it fell on deaf ears. When a spammer sends mail from one of their alias's you can not block it...it doesn't work.  Yahoo mail sucks!!!
B00571F26Y|4.0|well written,  seems to be based on sound research,  the concepts may even work if I could afford to follow the plan
B003NTSBUG|5.0|Shutter Island keeps you in suspense continously and keeps you guessing. Just like and old Hitchcock movie, Vertigo for example, it makes you work your brain.  No easy answers here; you'll want to go back and see the movie again when it's over.
034552554X|5.0|the story of a person's struggle to find herself after being abandoned at birth. She struggles through many foster homes, and trial adoptions only to be &#34;returned&#34;  to the system. A mother finally got through to her heart by teaching her the meanings behind different flowers. this was finally a language she could understand. it helped her to express herself in a way she could not before.<br />But the rejections of her past keep haunting her and prevent her from accepting love from others. A very good study in the pain of the foster care system. the fragile children that  the foster system fails to help into adulthood. It also brings out the different ways we communicate to each other, and how very easy it is to misunderstand others. An excellent read for ages high school to old age.
B006LSZECO|1.0|Why would you write about such sick creatures? Although this has been on the best seller list, I have yet to talk with anyone who liked it. It is a throw away. I like to read something informative and uplifting - this is not it.
B0085W09ME|4.0|This was more than I expected.  Seems to be very accurate.  Even though I went to the airline site to book, it gave me information I would not have had otherwise.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|This entertaining book was by an author I hadn't read before.  I enjoyed the story and had a hard time putting the book down as I read, with anticipating of what would happen next.
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Since its written like a novel, the reading of this book is much more pleasant than similar titles.<br /><br />Lots of buzzwords, so you'll be entertained. Not very technical, but I think everybody can learn something from it (if not seeing yourself reflected on your day-to-day duties).
B00B69UQJY|4.0|Depeche mode always delivers good music. Good driving music for anyone who likes new wave/electronic pop. Band has been together for decades.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|This was a fantastic book. It was quite long but so different from anything that I have read in recent years. I did not see the movie but I would like to because of reading the book!  I  Highly recommend it if you have not already read it. Very inspiring and uplifting.
B004S9AK7C|3.0|Found this spy thriller to be entertaining will full on action from start to finish, twisting and turning keeping you second guessing about what, when and who was next. Ken Follett's character Nat Dickstein is very entertaining.
B00B4804KS|4.0|The movie is great to watch in 3D.  After see the movie in 2D and then seeing it in 3D, I wil retire my 2D version.  I recommend this 3D version over the 2D.

B00CDT41RY|5.0|We streamed this moving on a poor internet connection,  It buffered every 20 minuets interrupting our experience.  It took us four hours to watch this moving.  We waited with baited breath for each buffer to continue.  I never do that!! I hate buffering and waiting for movies. This movie is amazing.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|We love watching Downton Abbey over and over.  We were happy to find a full set and look forward to the next episodes.

B0009P5YXO|4.0|For my fellow Whovians, I bought this screwdriver not too long ago and I think most of what everyone is saying in the reviews is true.<br /><br />For starters it is a toy and people need to understand this that it's NOT METAL. I think that's the first misconception that someone might make when purchasing this guy, however it doesn't take away from its novelty value. This version of the 10th Dr.'s screwdriver is a nice plastic replica. It comes with two pen nibs (one on the screwdriver and one as the alternate), though with the one I got, the one that write's in the secret \\"UV ink\\" doesn't like to sit on it very well and falls off a little easier, while the one with normal ink's cap falls off all the time.<br /><br />I think I've played with this a few times, showing it off to my friends but it will probably go on my collectors shelf from now on.<br /><br />On a more technical note, the screwdriver's head DOES extend however you do so with a plastic push knob (it's not sprintloaded; this pushknob also acts as an access to the battery door when removed). The trip button that makes the sonic screwdriver activate its sound effects also trips every time you push up the head because the button is depressed inside the chamber that houses it so expect that to happen.<br /><br />Overall not a bad replica, definitely not a five stars because of expectations but it's not lower than a three because of it's actually a really fun product!<br /><br />Peace out!
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I had to watch this film twice before it struck me what a masterpiece it is. Poetic, abstract, ephemeral, dreamy, intense, profound. The future of cinema.
034580404X|5.0|I read these books before and decided that I must buy them and I knew where I would get them without a doubt amazon,, the fifty shades saga is so very hot , steamy and shows how a person can change when love is in the picture .....
B00C5ZORES|5.0|So glad they're back, first of all.  And this was a great comeback album.  Even the songs that I didn't care for at first (The mostly rap \\"The Mighty Fall,\\" for instance) grew on me after only a few listens, and the songs I liked upon first hearing border on perfection.  I've been listening to the whole thing on repeat for days now.  I couldn't be happier with this album, and I can't wait to see what they do next.
0316224588|5.0|Read  &#34;The Impossible Dead&#34; or another Rankin book about &#34;The Complaints&#34; to get accquainted with Malcolm Fox. This story will make much better sense if you do.

0316228532|3.0|A well-developed story, a quick read, and an interesting look into everyday life in a small England town. On the other hand, the characters really didn't have too much depth or dimension, but were simply 'types'. Not destined to be a classic by any means, but an enjoyable read overall.
B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Christoph Fischer's Sebastian is a very enjoyable read. I had already read something by this author, The Luck of the Weissensteiners, and really enjoyed that so when this one came out I was ready for it. It did not disappoint. Although the story follows a teenage boy into young adulthood it is not just his story, rather it is one of relationships and the transience of ones involvement in them, and all things. The backdrop of a Baltic war is never far from the forefront although this story line does not dwell in any battlefront scenes, which appealed to me. I thought it was clever how the author once again draws from history to create an illusive energy throughout the story, a tension that enters into Sebastian and his relationship with his mother, father, grandparents, romantic interests, and his jobs. The scenes were well written, the characters developed nicely, and the story charming, intriguing and poignant, holding my interest throughout the read. It's a good read for the entire family. I was given an ARC copy of this book for a review.

Did I mention it is compatible with Facebook so you can show off your park and you can also visit your friends park if you like. And you can give gifts to some of your friends. I would totally recommend this game to anyone.

B000N4SHOE|4.0|What, you're asking who or what is MISS POTTER?  That's a bit thick!  How about Jemima Puddleduck,  or Peter Rabbit?<br />Oh, now you get it!  Better late than never I suppose.  Yes indeed, MISS POTTER is the woman who created those children's gems, and became known throughout the world, recognized by everyone except her mother, who was a fuddy-duddy and thought Beatrix Potter was worse than potty to be pottering about with silly drawings.  But MISS POTTER, nicely brought to life by Renee Zellweger and supported by Ewan McGregor, and those wonderful English character actors we've come to love so much.  But MISS POTTER is more than the sum of her parts.  What she accomplished with her life is remarkable even by today's standards.  However, I'm not going to tell you about those things, you must watch MISS POTTER yourself - it'll do you good.  By the way, I stopped at four stars instead of five because there's just a touch of sentimentality  here and there in the picture. But it never gets out of hand, just gives a little squirm every once in a while.  Miss Potter is a thoroughgoing family picture, reasonably priced from AMAZON, so you can own it, because you know children - they want to see what they love over and over again.<br />P the G

B005S9EJ14|5.0|What can I add to the kudos already ringing around the world for THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL?  Not a word.  So I won't say what a delight it is to watch Maggie Smith, Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, and Tom Wilkinson, seasoned actors at the height of their powers, bring to this fable a remarkable reality.  Buy if from AMAZON as I did so that you may enjoy it again and again as I have and will continue to do.  In a world reduced to unsolvable problems overwhelming us, THE BEST EXOTIC MARIGOLD HOTEL is a breath of fresh air.  I'm on my knees folks, begging you to buy it.  AMAZON's prices are always reasonable.  So you be reasonable.  Don't go another day without it.<br /><br />P the G

B00007GZQI|5.0|When I first watched this movie in Kansas City with a very special lady in my life, the  \\"hippie-world\\" was at its peak. This film had me almost falling out of my seat with laughter. I actually had to go back and watch it again, by myself, to make sure I got to see everything I may have missed while laughing myself silly, along with the rest of the theater crowd. A true classic. A must see, the mix of cameos and crazy situations make this wonderful British send-up something not to be missed.  I'm hoping the DVD will bring the story out in all its comedic splendor.
B005LAII12|1.0|One would think that a Teddy Bear means a family film.  I was totally offended by this movie.  There more ways to create laughs.  it was just stupid.  It is just a movie about drugs and sex.  There no redeeming quality to this movie.  I rate this movie as a negative infinity on a scale of 1 to 10.  This movie shows the lack of creativity in present day films.

B00CKOYVG8|4.0|This is a pretty great game. The only problem is that it doesn't have very much content. All we get is the Weekly Tournament and the Practice mode, which still provides us with  a good game (Y'know, if you like Angry Birds.)<br /><br />OVERALL RATING:<br />4/5 Stars

B00CKOYVG8|4.0|There is no question about Angry Birds. It definitely is the most popular game to download for your computer, tablet and smartphone. It has never gotten old. But now you can challenge your friends with a little angry excitement with Angry Birds Friends. I like this game because it has classic Angry Birds appeal, which is fun and classic play. It is definitely a step in the fun that is just simple to toy for the high score. I loved playing Bad Piggies earlier this year, and for them to go back to the Angry Birds formula, this definitely works well. I really thought the animation was just as fun to play, and easy to control. I do wish though there could've been more challenging levels, like there were in Angry Birds Space, but this is a great download for your device.<br /><br />Graphics: B<br /><br />Sound: B<br /><br />Control: B+<br /><br />Fun & Enjoyment: B 1/2-<br /><br />Overall: B

B0002NRRAG|5.0|In the totally controlled corporate and commercial world of young female singers Madeleine stands with a few others in the jazz category.<br />It is the unpretensious style that sets her apart, and the wonderful ease with which she phrases each song.<br />Most have a Billie Holiday sense to them, and she is widely criticized for this. But originality is not what makes her so good.<br />Her musicians and her material strengthen all her cds, which don't vary a lot admittedly, though there is some variation.<br />It would be nice if she were a little more experimental but I think it is her style not to be too up front.<br />A welcome trait given the egoists who pass as vocal \\"artists\\" in the Pop World currently.<br /><br />She honed her craft on the streets of Paris, not in a sound studio.<br />Allison Krausse, Sarah Jarosz and Norah Jones maybe and certainly Roseanne Cash IMO.<br />A pretty face, talent and a good voice are all the current crop of pop singers have in common.<br />But they lack originality and are little more than products chosen by moguls for their ability to prance around on stage.<br />Alicia Keyes is particularly pretentious, though she is not a prancer thank God.<br />Amy Winehouse was the most original of the whole crowd of Pop Singers.<br />But Madeleine isn't a pop singer any more than Norah Jones is per se.<br />Nor is she merely an imitator of Billie Holiday.<br />In fact if the other divas were as competent in that department their acts would be greatly improved.<br />But she is much more than that. A true Jazz singer at times, with inventive arrangements and musicianship that vary subtly from cd to cd, but always with the same mellow vibe.

0307730697|3.0|\\"When Adam Brown woke up on March 17, 2010, he didn't know he would die that night in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan - but he was ready.\\"  So begins the book Fearless, a look at the life of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown.  There's no suspense in how this book will end, but the look into how Brown turned his life around and ended up in Afghanistan that fateful day makes this book a compelling read.  Adam Brown had a typical childhood.  Raised mainly in Arkansas, he was one of three children of an electrician and his wife.  Adam excelled at sports, had a stable home life and was generally liked, yet after high school he lacked direction.  This eventually led him to drop out of college, quit his job working in the family business, and get involved with a questionable group of friends.  After an unsuccessful stint in rehab, Adam began stealing from family and friends to support a growing drug habit, which eventually led to arrest and a year-long stay at Teen Challenge, a residential rehab facility out of state.  During the stay there, Adam became more religious and seemed to turn his life around, but more relapses followed.  He met his future wife, Kelley, and eventually, after spiraling back down towards addiction, he decided to follow his childhood dream to become a Navy SEAL.  Luckily, a father's friend was a naval officer and was able to convince the skeptical recruiter to accept the drug addicted felon into service.  This proved to be the major turnaround that Adam needed.  The discipline required to be accepted into SEAL training gave him something to focus on and allowed him to channel his energy into his calling in life.  As he and Kelley started a family, Adam began his life in the elite SEAL training program.  Although he suffered some serious injuries after joining the Navy, it didn't deter his determination or ability to be the best.  The only problem I had with the book was deciphering and keeping straight all the acronyms - HLZ, BUD/S, DEVGRU, etc. are some of them that are bandied about and repeated over and over.  It can all be a bit confusing!  But I did enjoy the story of the man behind the hero.  We all hear the heartbreaking news of loss and sacrifice that our military families endure, and this book makes a tragic loss tangibly real.GRU, etc. are some of them that are bandied about and repeated over and over.

Still doing research on this.<br /><br />It's a good buy for the money.  I am ordering another one for my wife so that should tell you something!

B007XNAOPI|5.0|Melodic and heavy. Complex yet simple. Beautiful and ultra-sonic. What more can be said about Baroness? This album is right up there with Mastodon as far as being great progressive metal. Bought it on vinyl and it sounds amazing enough that my 66 year old mother even commented on how good it sounded. And by the way she hates metal!!! Great album. Now I need to see them live this summer and I'll be a happy M.F.
1400069289|5.0|This book is a fabulous investigation of how habits influence what we do.  Mr. Duhigg's many examples of how marketing is influenced by the way we purchase items.  I had heard that companies used psychological techniques to figure out what to sell us. Just buy the book you will not be disappointed.  Oh yes, please disregard the few negative comments.  People like that drive me nuts because thy just have to be opposite to whatever everyone else thinks...its actually quite sad they have little else to do.[[ASIN:1400069289 The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business]]

B0076DCT2G|5.0|Fast moving story, smart aleck Detective Corey is on his game - would like to see this one turned into a movie.
B00BI6SSMC|5.0|I heard Lovers revolution before this was released and LOVED that song (ok sound like Jetho Tull some huh?). In today's iTunes world, picking songs instead of listening to albums, is what everyone does. Do yourself a favor a listen to this entire album all in row for it is so well done and I believe meant to be listened to this way. Great Sunday morning coffee drinking or housecleaning music.
1933633867|1.0|Parts of this book are excellent, but at some point you realize that much is being claimed, and very little is proven, or even argued. For example, the author will state that there is a difference between obligations and debt, and that debt is quantified through money technology. This seems an exciting avenue for exploration, but he never deepens the thought except to reference it as a tautological jump off for other thoughts. Some of the arguments are rather hazy, and end up as description disguised as analysis. For example, the author will list various troubling anecdotes relating debt to exploitation, and to the implication, or usage, of violence. But then, somehow, and without real analysis, the book seems to relate debt as inherently relating to violence. Perhaps there is a fair argument relating the concept of ownership to violence, but it isn't in this book. You are simply expected to leap from anecdotes to presumption.

B00BZAJMWG|5.0|I've been there and I know what it is like -- shrinks shoving pills down your throat so you can have a &#34;normal&#34; life.  The shrinks fail to realize this, as this movie doesn't. it takes normal people around you so you are capable of a &#34;normal&#34;, average life.  It is the person who suffers to realize that she must seek out normal people to realize that normalcy is the absence of severely dysfunctional people.  It takes more than two to escape this sick tango.  This movie shows me exactly that.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's been so long since I've written a book review I'm not quite sure where to start. Honestly, this is the best thing I've read in a long time.<br /><br />Mr. Howey succeeds in creating a complete world, web of characters and events which kept me completely immersed and wanting to read more. The details of the silo and circumstances surrounding this haven in a harsh future are realistic and cohesive throughout. I feel like I now know what life is like for everyone from the up top all the way to the down deep.<br /><br />One of my favorite aspects of the story was Howey's ability to create such distinctly human characters. They aren't strictly black or white, good or evil, but shades of gray. The &#34;villains&#34; don't seem so bad at times, the &#34;heroes&#34; are flawed and some fall in between.<br /><br />If you're even a little interested in sci fi, I strongly recommend reading this. And as a bonus it's crazy inexpensive! Definitely looking forward to reading more of Howey's work.

Forget work, family stuff, just read as fast as you can to see will happen next. It is funny & disturbing. Truly a twisted tale.  A+
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love the way Gillian Flynn writes!! This is so fresh and intriguing. You think you know what's going on and then you get thrown in another direction!  I like the way she moves from one character's prospective to the other, and back (each chapter). And she is very funny! Her ability to describe just what the person is feeling is &#34;dead on&#34;! When I finished ready Gone Girl, I immediately purchased two of her other books.

B00CL151G4|5.0|A very original series, fun and the crime solving is top notch, Sherlock (Johnny Lee Miller) is brilliant and his counter part Miss Watson (Lucy Lui)is a wonderful change to the original male character Dr. Watson. A great twist on an old story. Definitely a Keeper....A Class Act.....

In my reverie, I have always thought of sex as an endless pursuit of possibilities. But with life and having a child in my early 20's, I didn't pursue some of the fantasies I felt that I would enjoy.  And now, upon reading these three books, I have regained those urges that I had put on hold. In the next half of my life, I'll be more courageous, and open in my sexuality.

All emotions of life are apparent and supported, the joy, the sorrow, pain, exhilaration, even ecstasy. A beautiful example of awakening to higher consciousness as well. Deserving of merit and loaded with signifance for the lives of each of us with the eyes to see.

0307476073|2.0|I found I could put this book down at any time. I am still reading it, but nothing exciting has happened yet. The book is more about the person &#34;finding herself&#34; than what she see's on the trail. Maybe it will get more exciting as I go on.

B0002S947K|5.0|I know that sounds crazy, but is it?  I just wanted to give my Mom something different to expand her horizons.  She listens to Van Morrison and Train, and so I want her to try something new.  Not saying the brilliance of Mr. LaMontagne is analogous to Train (sorry not trying to be a snob here), but it's not like I'm giving her Skrillex, either.  I cannot wait to see how she likes it.  Am I a bad daughter?  Should I have just bought her some jewelry and wine? lol  They say experiences make you happier than material things, so I hope her having this CD will give her a great experience.  This music has so much soul to it, I'll write a follow-up review to see how she likes it if I can remember.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I didn't buy this for the digital copy which is good because that is an limited time offer that expired February 15th (2013).  Other than that this is great.  The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the &#34;false&#34; advertising, inadvertant though it may be.

B00BK5D95C|2.0|Went out on a limb without listening to the album.  Really liked Breezleblocks and wanted to support a new artist.  There are two songs that I liked on the album, Breezleblocks and Tessellate, so I gave two stars.  Other than that there is a lot of repetitive indie- artsy wish-wash.

B00CL0J99K|1.0|SPOILER ALERT<br /><br />First of all how could Marvel do this to Iron Man's greatest villain, the Mandarin. He is a make believe character really? The movie was created by the official Marvel studio. What were they thinking? Also the MK 42 was barely working in the movie. Don Cheadle didn't even get any Iron Patriot action in this movie. Such a disappointing movie. The only was they can do Mandarin justice is if they rebooted the franchise.

B009UAO1ZG|5.0|Absolutely engrossing. It is interesting to know more about the political climate before World War II and frightening to know how unprepared we were.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|I have had this back pack now for a couple months and have used it for business travel. It fits my 17&#34; laptop with no problems. It has a lot of space and diffrent compartments and pockets and I find it very easy to keep everything organized. Very comfortable wearing through the airports. Only two months in but it seems very durable, time will tell.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|It's a book that's very different from what I usually read. The fantasy land of the circus made me want to be there and the romance was unique and special.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|It was a little hard to get in to because there's so many characters and so many things going on. Once I got into it, I couldn't put it down. Amazing story!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I was expecting more from this movie, I mean its Denzel for crying out loud. One min I was rooting for him the next I wanted him to fall into oblivion. Wait till its on free tv.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|I enjoyed reading the novel; it was in the same genre as previous novels by Clancy. I'd recommend it to other people who like to read this type of novel.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Jennifer Lawrence and Bradley Cooper were amazing as always in this movie! It was a beautiful protrayal of how mental illness can affect individuals, couples and families.
B001LOPYHI|5.0|Logan's Run is the quintessential sci-fi movie..an ominous Big Brotherish dome world where everyone blindly submits to death before age 30 on the &#34;Carousel&#34;unless they try to make a run for it, in which a &#34;Sandman&#34; hunts them down and exterminates them.  The story revolves around just such a &#34;Sandman&#34; named Logan 5 becomes increasingly aware that not all is well in Paradise.  He eventually escapes the dome with a woman (natch) and together they start a new life outside the dome but not before bringing the others out...Michael York plays the Sandman Logan 5 and there is a first role by Farrah Fawcett as a body technician who operates the machines that changes your body and face (shades of plastic surgery)  still cool to watch, and a little kitsch but perfectly enjoyable...Enjoy
B00632HWOG|2.0|I downloaded this app thinking it would allow me to access all of my linked Yahoo accounts. My website and business email is with Yahoo Business under my own domain name. From my desktop or laptop, I can access all my information through one screen. This app does not allow me to access my Yahoo emails through my domain name. It only reads emails from @yahoo.com addresses. I actually don't use the @yahoo.com email address for anything important, so the app is effectively useless for checking my business emails.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is a shining example of why so many US shows are adapted from UK shows. There is no dumbing down of dialogue. No graphic sex or violence. Just top quality writing combined with excellent acting. Although the family is not a typical one in the sense that they are royalty, everyone can identify with the challenges they face. Some things are universal in life. Downton shows us that we all have more in common than we realize.<br /><br />I hope it stays on for years. The characters are so well written and portrayed it easy to become emotionally invested in them.
B00BLCHZC2|5.0|Great show can't wait for more. Very well written great story and great acting make this series a must watch
B004BCNVOA|5.0|This album proves Pink's amazing talent. Her incredible voice and vocal range is unmatched. Her songwriting is deeply personal and reasonates. You have the gamut on this album. Upbeat danceable tunes to thought provoking ballads. Pink is here to stay for a long time. as long as she stays true to herself, she will have a remarkable career and will be known as one of the best entertainers ever!
B007R41E8O|4.0|The game was fun. Beautiful graphics; good storyline; surprise twist at the end,  my only wish is that the puzzles were more of a challenge.  Enjoyable way to spend some downtime.
B000GOU4M4|5.0|The sequel to Vacation is so much better! The complications and disappointments of trying to create a &#34;Currier and Ives&#34; Christmas are comically portrayed. Everyone can relate to some aspect of Clark's attempt at having a true family holiday. Don't forget the fashion lesson taught us by Cousin Eddie-never wear a dickey with a white sweater!<br /><br />A thoroughly enjoyable movie to watch over and over again, not just at Christmas!
1570629706|5.0|This book is now one of the must reads of my library.  Hermann Hesse was more than just a great writer.  He was a great sage as well.  This book is so profound that I found I could not read more than a few pages at a time in parts.  I needed to contemplate on what was being related.<br /><br />It is a work of great beauty, wisdom and truth.  More than a few times it brought tears to my eyes.  To think that it wasn't even originally written in English staggers me.<br /><br />I recommend this book with every fibre in my being.  It is a journey from childhood into spiritual mastery in a way that is deeply moving, heartfelt and compelling.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B000002UHG|5.0|Broken China deals with depression. Rick's wonderful melodies and lyrics strike a chord for those dealing with this silent menace. Rick's voice is very soothing. A wonderful album!
B008X8QCTO|4.0|This is a great game. I love hidden object games &amp; the developer hit the nail on the head with this one. I am playing on a kindle fire HD &amp; it downloaded fine for me. The only reason I did not give this a 5 is because in the bonus chapter the game freezes when using the glass cutter on the fish tank. I can not get past the bonus chapter because of this. I hope Alware comes up with an update to fix this. Other then that good game well worth the $ .99 they are charging.<br /><br />I did not get a message to pay more while playing the game.
B0040JBAMY|5.0|This phenomenal band from the 70's and 80's is like none other. Freddie Mercury's voice cannot be duplicated. there is an endearing quality to his voice that is unmatched to this day. Freddie was a true entertainer. he performed all genres of music and excelled at each. He is greatly missed.<br /><br />A large factor in Queen's success was the contribution of each member. You didn't see the egomaniacal monster in this group. instead, each member contributed to the band's success. Each member was given the opportunity to compose, sing and perform. Brian May's songs in particular speak to me in a way like no other. Brian's music and lyrics have helped me through some very dark times in my life.<br /><br />John and Roger's songs speak to a generation.<br /><br />This band and their music has stood the test of time and will continue to do so even without their frontman. That is a testament to the quality of this group.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I have been watching the weather channel for many years and I am very pleased with the desk top and apps for the Weather Channel.  They are very informative and up to date on their reporting. I would recommend it to everyone.  They are as accurate as any weather can be.
B0000025H6|5.0|Roger Waters'/Pink Floyd's The Wall take us into the world and mind of a rock star on the brink of a breakdown. We see how he got to this point, the contributing factors, we watch his decline into almost madness. Through the music, we get to see the different stages of &#34;Pink's&#34; life. from his boyhood and how they contributed to his decline. We watch as he is put on trial for his crimes. The crimes being mistakes that everyone may make in living their lives. Pink's life has many similarities to an every day person's life. The issues of abandonment, success and failure ring true for many.<br /><br />This should be on everyone's must see list. The music is well written and seems to be biographical in nature for Roger Waters. We are able to feel his pain and loss which stems from losing his father in the war. To see how this influenced every aspect of his life touches you.<br /><br />You don't just watch this movie, you experience it!

031620157X|1.0|Fairy tales cheapified!<br /><br />I am not sure whether it's Mr. Colfer's lack of experience as a budding writer that makes me cringe at his work, or maybe his youth, but definitely this is a book to reckon with if you're not in your right mind about devouring fine, exquisite writing.  The finesse of writing doesn't have to be equal with those of more popular writings, and I've certainly read less famous authors' works which are enormously fascinating. Popular writing or not, there are certain benchmarks to good writing and this one breaks all the rules. This book for me is a toss in the garbage.  It's bland.<br /><br />I have high respects for Colfer's ability to act and sing, no question about that.  But his writing is way out of context.  It's as if all the Fairy Tale characters we love and respect suddenly go emaciated, all their lines seem to be those of a whiny child who's gone totally berserk. Snow White suddenly becomes queen-so and apparently as queen, you'd expect her to gave gone unshakeable, what with the rigid amount of work to rule a kingdom, yet at that time she appears before the Evil stepmomma - yes, evil-  all tears break loose.  WHOA!!! So much for a queen there.  And Snow White's lines, yes we're still in chapter one,  are just lame, an ugly duckling that grew up still remaining ugly.  Those words are like a mini kitten who seriously believes her purr is as strong as a lion's.  Even the girl main character who's supposed to be witty brilliantly spuns piercingly dull similes.<br /><br />These thoughts crawled into my head by the first paragraphs in chapter one, but I gave the book a chance anyway.  It was ok the next few chapters, but by chapter eight I decided to close the book and dump it.

B000Z9PYJS|5.0|Oddly enough I had this book on my kindle for quite some time but never actually read the book.  It always seemed to be one of those flavored of the day best sellers and I doubted its worth.  After seeing the movie on an international flight, and enjoying it, I decided I wanted to read the book.  Even after knowing the story I really enjoyed this book and all it has to say about religion, survival, and storytelling.  I think the writing style is enjoyable and well paced, not overly descriptive and bounces between themes quite fluidly.

B008JFUO4U|4.0|(NOTE for anyone who wants to give a negative review: please leave a comment to help me do better next time.)<br /><br />First: DO NOT READ Amazon's description of OBLIVION!  It gives away key PLOT SPOILERS.<br /><br />For my part, I will quite deliberately tell you only a little about the plot, as I think it really is best kept as a surprise. Thankfully, the commercials do not do it an injustice, and will not spoil your viewing.<br /><br />The merest details of the story are as follows: Jack Harper (Cruise) is a repairman known as Tech 49 whose assignment is providing security in order to keep Hydrorig machinery running on what's left of our planet after a ravaging horde of aliens destroyed almost our entire race six decades ago.  Alien scavengers are sabotaging the rigs on a daily basis, and all Jack and his partner are hoping for is to finish their job and join the remainder of Earth's survivors on Titan, a moon of Saturn.<br /><br />As for anything else, it's best you keep your mind clear until you see the movie.<br /><br />The acting is very competent and while not entirely engaging, it doesn't have to be: the movie aims for a deliberate aloofness here. And, though the movie has Cruise in almost every shot it is not a typical star turn for him.  For once Cruise has selected a movie that features him but is not ABOUT him, in a sense...it's about what secret lies behind their strange day-to-day existences.<br /><br />Olga Kurylenko ([[ASIN:B001VIMCW4 Quantum of Solace]]) and Andrea Riseborough ([[ASIN:B005V3HM7K Brighton Rock]]) are excellent, as is Melissa Leo ([[ASIN:B00BB8RKH6 Flight]], [[ASIN:B00BEIYHO2 Olympus Has Fallen]]).  While Morgan Freeman is featured prominently in the ads, he does not play a large role in the film...though it is pivotal.<br /><br />OBLIVION is an interesting mix...lots of action, yet it tries to be a thinker. As such, it does provide a puzzle that needs to be put together by the viewer. The real, ultimate problem is that once that's accomplished there isn't a lot there to ponder afterward.  There's a twist, yes; it just isn't all that intellectual. Think [[ASIN:B0053EZWZQ Planet Of The Apes (1968)]] without the BIG shock.<br /><br />What OBLIVION does really well is look good. It superimposes post-apocalytic scenes of desecrated New York landmarks upon a desolate landscape laid waste by enemy invaders. Shot in Iceland during their 24-hour cycles of daylight, the juxtaposition makes for a stark composition of collapse and ruination...an earth no longer even worth inhabiting.<br /><br />As always, the desolation is New York City's: the Manhattan (or is it Brooklyn?) Bridge juts out of the silt, in the midst of a rocky crag there is an entrance to a big interior room of the New York Public Library, the Empire State Building appears only from the observation tower on up, and a big football stadium (is it the Met Life Stadium?) lies in ruins.<br /><br />What director Joseph Kosinski ([[ASIN:B004R63MWQ Tron: Legacy]]) and cinematographer Claudio Miranda ([[ASIN:B00BSBT8M6 Life Of Pi]]) accomplish is to produce the devastation of Earth through the browns, blacks, and greys of the soil and rocks, counterpointed by the bright blueness of the ever-present sky. There is a gorgeous iridescent blue and black night swimming scene in Jack's sky suite, wherein the two actors swim tastefully naked inside a transparent pool. Indeed, Cruise's silver-blue uniform and his clear glass bubble-like helicopter are sleek and artistically interposed in this world of greys, blues and browns. When they travel into space, it is primarily dark and black. When he is trapped within the hidden caverns of his enemy it is a dark, shadowy world of blacks, greys, and browns.<br /><br />There is only one place in this whole movie that really displays color, and it is a hideaway Jack  has created for himself in what one can only assume is New York's Adirondacks -- though these scenes were shot in California. It's a little hamlet oflush greenery that has within it a cabin of artifacts Jack's lifted upon his trips around the ruins of NYC. He has tucked away books, Procul Harum and Led Zeppelin albums, a doll, and photos near and dear to him. The audience at my showing had a little chuckle at the fact that he places on one shelf his own iconic sunglasses...to my way of thinking, the trademark of one Mr. \\"Top Gun\\" Cruise.<br /><br />So the film is strikingly visual, and a beauty to see at the theater. I saw it in an IMAX theater (though it was not shot that way) and it was gorgeous. Besides that, the soundtrack by French band M83 is also alternately pensive and rousing, peacefully employing a lone piano one moment, then next dishing up an insistent orchestral piece.<br /><br />All in all, OBLIVION is a beautiful, striking, thoughtful work, though it doesn't -- as perennial one-year old genius Stewie Griffin might say -- \\"leave us richer for the experience.\\"lush greenery that has within it a cabin of artifacts Jack's lifted upon his trips around the ruins of NYC.

B008602KQI|4.0|I had read the books and loved them so I was excited about seeing the movie.  I really liked it.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Wow.  I really don’t know what to say about this.  Frankly, this is one of the top Fantasy books I’ve read in a very long time.  It’s not that there’s really anything new here from a content perspective, and I was initially put off by the retrospective narrative, but the book captured my imagination and kept me excited to the very end.  As a whole, everything seemed very well balance: fantasy elements weren’t over the top, heroes weren’t superheroes, and the book wasn’t two-thirds world-building.<br /><br />This book was so good that I still wonder if the author is a pseudonym, as you just don’t see many first time authors put out a novel this strong.  Again, it’s not like the setting and story is so different than what you’ve heard before, but it’s been done in such a good way, that you want to read the whole story.  I very much WANT to find strong new authors, but it’s so hard to find one who can be consistent thru the whole book.  This one was a winner, and I’m glad I took a chance.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Great cast! Very graphic, had me at the edge of my seat every week! Hoping for Season TWO as I did not have a sense of closure!

B009VA1FN6|4.0|After reading Kate's other books I personally thought this one got off to a slow start but as I persisted, I found her skill of weaving secrets and intrigue through the story was ever present and absorbing. It was the having to persist that I gave it four stars instead of five.<br /><br />Kate is a story teller who sets her stories both in Australia and England. Her characters are always well formed, even vivid. Her stories are such as have a romantic thread woven together with the savage side of human character. No mush.<br /><br />Looking forward to the next one
B00BGI086Q|2.0|Arrow is sort of like Smallville with the will-they or won't-they sleep-inducement. However, where Smallville made up for the continuation of high-school-silly, long after Clark Kent had graduated, this series begins with the lead all grow'd up, as it were. Grown, but somehow trapped as a selfish, snarky, short-sighted teenager... with an arrow collection and a serious hate-on for the evil One Percenters. I'm surprised they haven't done an episode where Oliver tries to kill a bunch of Senators or the Prime Minister or even a Clinton. This anti-hero hates rich people that much. Odd, since he is one. I personally don't hate rich people. Yes, I wish I was one and, yes, I don't particularly like being poor. That having been said, I don't wish a mental patient with a bunch of arrows would start hunting them down and stealing their money so that he could redistribute that wealth to whoever he's decided is deserving. The political subtext in this series is not subtext. It is so overwhelming, so punch-you-in-the-face clear, that watching this series and enjoying it is as impossible for me as watching a Ron Jeremy Porno. I mean, sure, there's an appeal, to some, but, is that appeal universal? Do we all need to see that? Isn't there an alternative we could be watching? If you want to watch a fun, action filled, tween-style superhero show, just watch the Smallville seasons after Clark Kent graduated from high school. True, Lex Luthor was rich. Also true, a whole mess of rich folk in that show were not, contrary to the position of the Arrow writers, horrible people. Also, you won't really care whether or not Arrow/NinnyPants ever gets together with his ex-whatever or mends fences with that dark-haired buddy/ex-buddy/drinking-buddy/possible ex-boyfriend or whatever. You won't care who he kills or who he puts in prison or what his black-friend are up to, his black-friend who is essentially a man-servent they've named \\"Diggle\\" (\\"they\\" being, most likely, whichever writers descended from slave owners, slave owners who'd handed down through the generations that Bessie is an appropriate name for a cook, even if she already has a name and slave owners who believed black people have names like \\"Diggle\\", not Thomson or Jones or pretty much anything other than Diggle.... Diggle! Yeah. Well, at least it wasn't Digger.... Am I still in the parenthetical? Oops.) Don't watch this. More importantly, don't let your children watch it, not if you want them to grow up with a healthy respect for money, what it means, what it does, what it is for and how it is earned: specifically, not by shooting people with arrows and intimidating them with your best Christian-Bale-has-throat-cancer creep-voice until they hand over all their green or, just, stealing it from the rich and using it to buy green leather hoodies. And most importantly, don't let them watch it if you value the no-killing-people-value-system I am assuming you've at least taken a few moments to fill them in on since they've been in your care. The \\"Arrow\\" in the story arc of this first season, unlike his predecessor in Smallville, rarely kills the baddie but he nearly always kills his paid security, hard working men hired to act as night watch or bodyguards or even, not so on the up-and-up, actual underlings who beat people up and break kneecaps. This Arrow is basically a serial killer with a disturbing body count and odd political bent for motivation. If you are interested in this series, I would advise skipping the first season and moving directly to the second, in which the new Oliver Queen has a crisis of conscience over having killed so many fathers and brothers and sons who were, after all, just doing their jobs, and suddenly decides that maybe, just maybe, he should reserve the killing for the men who have actually committed the crimes. Just a warning, season one of Arrow may not be for you and I wouldn't let a young person in my family near this one.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Not much control on this one either. Children might enjoy it for a while but not for long term. It doesn't't require much skill. It moves mostly on it's own.
B00ARA4SLU|4.0|I have seen a number of Hitchcock films and movies about Hitchcock as well. This one is really very good. Why? Because it focuses on the person, the man; it focuses on Hitch. Yes, he had problems with relationships and had a 'wandering' eye, but his direction of his leading ladies in his films was quite remarkable and this is what comes across in this film. I highly recommend it.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Excellent read. I was hooked from the beginning and had a hard time putting it down. Made me laugh & cry, highly recommend this book.
B0060MYKTY|5.0|This Showtime series, of which I have just finished the second season, is a remarkable mix of history and fiction. But beyond that, the first and second seasons portray the stunning story of the successes and failures of this tortured family – the Borgias. This is one of those cable series that I would not have been able to last week-by-week waiting for the next episode. I have pre-ordered the third season and would be watching it today if it was still on Showtime.

B001DM1VXE|3.0|It's just not that interesting to me.  That doesn't mean the movie is not good.  I did not really enjoy it and idi not even finish watching.
B00AQM8H9I|5.0|Works well on the kindle fire. Addictive to play and the various level settings allow for different age groups to be able to compete.

It goes into detail explaining all types of fats,carbs,vitamins etc. It explains how you should work out whethershredding or bulking and how to maintain once you have reached your goal. I am a very active person and i hit the gym as well. i have ran into problems like some other people where we begin to see no change in size or strength but after reading this book the Why? was answered for me. This is a vook i woud read again if i get into any problems. Overall the book has made a huge impact on my routine at the gym and believe it or not strength and size has improved in a shirt amount of time. All I did was follow the steps and rules.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Best child prodigy book there is, he's an amazing character who will stay with you forever, thank you very much Card.
B008602KQI|3.0|I probably should have passed this one by; I usually like adventure movies but not ones where children kill children... My fault should have known better...
B000O8OTNC|3.0|I think it's a nice pocket sharpener, good to throw in your pack. I don't very well like the sharpener for serrated blades but does a nice job on straight edges. Very affordable.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was our book club pick for April, and we all really enjoyed it. Most of us agreed it takes a while to pick up speed, so if you're feeling like that, don't give up. I suppose I watched too many (all) of the episodes of The Closer, so I correctly guessed &#34;whodunit,&#34; but that's a smaller part of the story than you would think! There were twists I didn't see coming despite being well trained by Brenda Leigh Johnson. (I think even she would have been surprised at all that occurs.) Our book club liked the way the story's narration switched back and forth from the husband's thoughts to Gone Girl's diary entries. This Gilian Flynn is one smart chick! I heard she self-published this book. I just did that with my own little book of humorous essays here on amazon, and if I could sell a third of the number Gone Girl has sold, I'd be gone girl, over-the-moon, hot-Krispy-Kremes-at-every-meal kinda happy! (It's titled &#34;Aging With Ungirdled Passion&#34; if you're looking for a fun beach read or girlfriend gift!) Anyhoo, Gone Girl has sold well for good reason!

B00AHTYI5M|4.0|Excellent acting and unique plotting make this film within a film a good choice for those appreciative of<br />John LeCarre- style stories.  Fans of Ben Affleck, Morgan Freeman, Ed Harris and Alan Arkin will not<br />be disappointed and viewing the film industry from an interesting point of view is worth the effort.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I have a little girl and she just loves this game :). And I even enjoy it when she needs help with something.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|This is a quirky tale of a group of retirees who have decided to relocate sight unseen to The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel in India.  Their journey begins with a brief synopsis of why each of them is leaving England and going to India.  Each story is funny, and people can relate to these people's situations.<br /><br />Upon their arrival, culture shock sets in.  Some can accept it and some can not.  One of the characters, Muriel, played so adeptly by Maggie Smith, is prejudiced against Indians, so her injection into India provides many laughs.  Her remarks are priceless.  Muriel expresses what many people only feel and keep to themselves.<br /><br />Upon their arrival, the guests are greeted by Dev Patel, the owner of the hotel.  He is the young actor who played the hero in Slumdog Millionaire. His comic gestures, timing, and hilarious welcome to the guests are a pleasure to watch.  He delivers funny lines with such seriousness that makes what he says even funnier.  His intentions are so good for these people, but he stumbles over his words, which makes his welcome even funnier.  Dev Patel is the best host/owner/manager of this establishment.<br /><br />Patel's \\"Welcome Dinner\\" is hilarious.  His intentions are so pure and sincere, but his words are so funny.  He calls the hotel a place for \\"the elderly and beautiful,\\" and for people \\"who are long in tooth\\" and \\"heard the chimes at midnight.\\"  Everyone is in shock.  The food is atrocious, but he prepared it lovingly with his most \\"loyalest\\" and best friend, Young Moossi.  When someone falls over at the table and gets crowded by the other guests, Dev Patel rushes through saying, \\"Let me through.  My brother is a doctor!\\"  This comedic dinner doesn't get much better than this!<br /><br />The entire cast is brilliant.  These actors are at the richest point in their careers, and it is a joy to watch them.  Each character has his or her reasons for going to this hotel, and their stories unfold most amusingly.  Each actor plays his or her part to perfection.  The casting was superb.  Everyone can relate to their situations.  The deadpan and the hysterical actions are extremely amusing.<br /><br />I have watched this movie over and over because I discover something new every time I watch it.  I would recommend this movie for anyone who wants to sympathize with the plight that seniors may face in retiring to a foreign country.  This is the best movie that has come along in a long time!  I would NOT miss it!  ENJOY!
B0058YPG2K|5.0|This one blew me away with the last 4 episodes can't wait to see how they wrap things up in season 5!!  Hail Hiezenberg!!
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I did like the story even though it was predictable, good beach read. I liked that it was a little longer than most sample romances.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This CD was totally unexpected and a joy to experience. Lindsey plays with an amazing energy and power. After listening to the CD it led me to go to her concert in San Francisco. What an experience!
B004NELBPC|1.0|I hats this app on the kindle.  go back to the old version please. I can't read because the font is too small.  take a lesson from the new yorker.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Excellent view of the weather.  I have tried a number of others and this one is the best by far.
B000Y5JFNE|5.0|A great movie from when I was a kid!! Loved being able to share it with my kids!! Both my 5 and 9 year old enjoyed it so much!! Anybody who hasn't seen it, should!!
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The first two books were great until you get to the end.  It was like she did everything for nothing and lost more at the end.  I enjoy a great read and death that come with it.  However, it felt as though the Mrs. Collins gave up at the end and really didn't know where or how to end it on good note.  I don't think I will be buying any more of her books in the future, don't get me wrong I like twist and turn of any good story.  I just notice that some author start off great and wither out at the last book.  Maybe it's pressure from the publisher or whatever.  I wish it would have ended with a bang instead of a people dropping like flies.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Awesome app...works great...very easy setup on kindle and computer...was so surprised an app like this would be on free app of the day. thank you!  I was curious how good it would work so tried movin pics and docs around and could even play facebook game on computer from kindle...wow !
B00BG4UWPC|3.0|Fun album but I can tell it will be one that will fall off my radar and never become a must listen to album.
B009LJZJL6|5.0|This year I planned on reading classics. It has been awhile that I read one; I think the last time was during my second or third year of high school. And that was a long time ago! To tell you honestly I'm a lazy girl when in terms of reading classics. Some were just boring that I can't even stand to finish it! But thankfully To Kill a Mockingbird isn't one of those books. It's the kind of book that will dig deeper into you and slowly gets you attached to the characters and story!<br /><br />I love this book! It's easy to read, memorable and thought-provoking. It brings back memories of our mischievous childhood. It also reminded me of how the world runs during those times. Unity and justice were unattainable back then due to racism. People judge others by the color of their skin. Though today racism is gone, thankfully!, I have felt the heaviness of racism during the course of my reading.<br /><br />The premise of the book is ordinary but something made the story extraordinary. And what's that? It's how Harper Lee magically brought the story to life! The characters were full of emotions and because of that I can easily relate to them, especially Scout! I like how innocent and curious she is. Not to mention how mischievous they (Jem and Scout) can get. The issue about racism was written with finesse. Harper Lee surely has the knack of writing.<br /><br />I wanted to talk more about the story; to share it to you guys but I'm afraid I might spoil it. So let me just invite you to read it then? :) To Kill a Mockingbird is a book you don't keep; It's a book you pass along for everyone to read and feel the magic sealed in it!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|The app works great.  It is easy to search and organize information with the tags and notebooks.  I have not had any issues with synching across any of my devices.  The only issue I have is that the ability to send/copy something from websites appears to be broken. I search for the issue and found others having the same problem but I have yet to see a solution.  I would definately give this 5 stars is this was working.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Playing Nemo's reef is really fun. I think it is so cute and addictive for children like me. For ages 12 and down because you are never to old to play games like this awesome one!!!!!! I reccommened children 12 and down to buy nemo's reef in the app store for free.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This is a clean movie of a love story of a boy and his horse. They both went to war and was separated. they found each other when at the bottom of depression and discouraged. It also shows a strong devotion that bonds everylasting love. Highly recommended
B0050DIWFC|5.0|It was hard to put the book down. The surprise ending kept me<br /> wanting more, there should be a sequel,
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|What a funny book! I was very entertained, but it was over too soon. I could have read another 100 pages.
B005HSL626|5.0|I got this to entertain my niece and nephew.  They really like it and I think they use my tablet more than I do.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|I saw this movie again and again and I love the feeling that inspired on me, the story has to many points of view, and that is enough reason to watch it one again.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This Cd was actually purchase for my husband. Who found Lindsey Stirling on Youtube. He was really excited to get her Album.<br />The only complate that was made by him is that the CD came with the Case broken. Other then that He's going to listen to this time and time again.
B00CMO5H8W|5.0|This is my favorite episode of this season!  It's great to see Mercedes (Amber Riley in case you didn't know!) stick to her principles even if it will slow her music career.
0345803493|5.0|If you weren't thinking about sex before you read this book, you will be.  Received the 1st book in the trilogy as a Christmas present, then I had to order the 2nd book...almost finished with it, and going back for the 3rd book.  HOT, HOT, HOT!!
0307949486|2.0|Very slow start to this book. There are also a few stories going on all at the same time that, of course, all come together at one point...but are a bit confusing along the way. Being a foreign book translated and set in a different country than the US, the language and names are a bit different as is their way of life and the way they deal with people. It came together well in the end...but I didn't care for the ending. I can't say I'm looking forward to the sequel.
B00AEFY66U|3.0|The video itself was received on a timely basis and in good condition. My husband did not recall this movie so he wanted to view thge older one prior to the new one coming out soon. It seemed very outdated after watching the trailer of the newer one with Leonardo. But it was just nice to watch a pleasant movie on Saturday night.
0786891416|5.0|I am a fan of the tv show \\"Castle\\" therefore I thoroughly enjoy this book. You can definately see the two tv characters personalities portrayed in the book's characters even though there are many different traits separating book and show. Great comedic writing and just enough in the sex scenes to leave you wanting more.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Follows the book pretty closely.  I was surprised that they were stretching this to 3 movies.  Then again, any worthwhile book is really hard to cut down into just one feature.
0425263908|4.0|I wanted to kill both of these people...her for running away every time she didn't understand something and him for being a jerk and an idiot. But....I loved the tension and the sex. Whew, the sex. And because of the intense sex, people want to compare it to 50 Shades but it's not. There is no S & M... he doesn't like that at all. No bondage at all. Just a lot of possessiveness and childlike behavior. Like I said...I wanted to crawl into the book and kill them both at times. I am looking forward to reading the next two books and seeing how this truly dysfunctional relationship turns out. Oh yes, and reading more impressive sex scenes :)
B005LAIIJY|3.0|Interesting story told with typical over the top Terintino violence.  Decent to escape with but I probably wont watch it again any time soon and propably should have rented it.
0061801313|5.0|THese books are full with suspense and its great for tenagers because its so very great also its a tv series
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I bought this for the Nook Color, which it doesn't fit perfectly, but that is not the maker's fault, so I still give the product 5 stars.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|I am a big fan of the Nicholas Sparks books as well as the DVD's based on his books.  I would recommend it to everyone.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|Very original. I like the characters. Can't remember reading anything similar to this, kudos to Baldacci for coming up with a great plot line.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I've read some of Stephen King's novels and enjoyed them.  \\"On Writing\\" is a short compelling memoir of King as a writer and his thoughts on what makes a novel flow.  Whether a King fan or not, he presents insights about his writing craft that are valuable to writers of any genre.  Included are an example of a first draft and a hand written edit/revision.  King also presents some examples and comparisons of dialog construction that really show why some styles of writing can grate on the reader.  \\"On Writing\\" can be read in one evening, but you'll want to read it again and refer to it from time to time.  It is the one source that can make all the difference.
B002W5UVSM|2.0|It was an ok read but nothing in there was calling me to come back to finish. Didn't care about the characters and it was a bit over written.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a very fun app and I enjoy playing it. However, I believe that the first Temple Run was better, not by graphics and animations, but I believe the first one was better than the second.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|A style and passion in his writing that really captures my imagination. I look forward to the next 2 in the series.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Even though the story is a sad one; the movie was done exceptionally well.  It gives the viewer a true to life view of what it must have been like in those days.  I saw the movie at the theater; that's why I decided to get a copy for home.
1601251505|5.0|The book is a spendy, but it's the player's and DM's guide and I've been playing a while so you'll eventually break down and buy it.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun but you do need to be warned that it is very addicting.But in the end it is a perfect fun app.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This takes careful watching and quick movements.  I really enjoy, expecially when I receive a real high score, but alas, the next time I fall flat again.
B006ZN7KMM|5.0|The best material to understand the modern history of Spain. These are good documents to know more about the moder history of Spain since Franco past gone and the amazing transformation from to one of the most poor country in Europe to the important economy and country in the Europe Context.

0802473156|5.0|My husband and I held a marriage retreat and we used this book.  It was a hit!!!!!  Now that each couple are aware of their spouses's love language, we've created accountability to one another!!!  A must get book!
0385349947|4.0|Presently, I have no women in my CEO group. In the past we've enjoyed the presence of two strong women entrepreneurs. The group agrees that for sure we had a wider view of approaches to challenges and opportunities. And that was not simply because we had different business experience at the table when these powerful women were there, it was because we had a diversity of gender views. We continue to search for that gender diversity for our group.<br /><br />So I picked up Sandberg's new book on women leaders with anticipation. I wanted to understand why there was reluctance on the part of so many women entrepreneurs to join this high performing group. Part of it is just numbers. A 2012 McKinsey survey of more than four thousand employees of leading companies found that 36 percent of the men wanted to reach the C-suite, compared to only 18 percent of the women. And of course there's the \\"usual\\" reasons - too busy, I already belong to an industry group, I travel and can't make monthly meetings, etc.<br /><br />Alice Walker may have the real issue pegged though, she observed that \\"The most common way people give up their power is by thinking they don't have any.\\" Many of the women entrepreneurs with whom I've spoken seem to want to hide the power they wield or, as Walker suggested, aren't not aware of the power they have accreted. They may not be able to see themselves sitting at the table with other CEOs, Business Owners and/or General Managers from different industries.<br /><br />There are many insights in Sandberg's book. As a result of having read her research, thoughts and opinions I have changed the way I now approach women entrepreneurs. Instead of assuming, on the one hand, that women CEOs have exactly the same approach to power, leadership and relationships as her male counterpart, I try to make sure I'm even more aware than usual to not have any preconceived notions about CEO motivations for being interested in leadership. On the other hand, I work even harder to not allow the women to \\"give away their power\\" by not recognizing that they have that power. That is very different than how I might approach a male leader where I am more likely to run into an \\" outsized ego.\\"<br /><br />I now realize that I will have to work even harder as I coach women in leadership positions. Thanks to Sheryl Sandberg, I at least now \\"have a clue\\" about how to shape my own thinking and guard against my own prejudices. Anyone in a leadership position, man or woman, will find Lean In to be a must read and well worth the time. After all, the essence of being a leader is developing other leaders, so let's not make the mistake of allowing half of the population to escape our attention and mentoring.r to not allow the women to \\"give away their power\\" by not recognizing that they have that power.

B001NLKT60|5.0|This book book was predictable and not predictable.  Just enough twists to make it hard to find a spot to quit reading!<br /><br />Th  author had me really sad for Salander, yet provided  glimmer of hope and that good would prevail.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I found that this app transferred names my from my Yahoo address book to my cell phone address book. I did not know that it would do this with out asking me first. I had to delete the duplicated entries in my cell phone. Do not link this app to your Yahoo web address unless you are prepared to clean up the extra addresses in your your cell address book.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|I stumbled upon this book when I was going through a tough time. I have read this book and have gifted to 3 of my friend and family and have recommended to dozen of people. One of best books I have come across.
B008220DIC|5.0|The Master is a purposefully non-traditional film that most people won't like.  I happened to be one of those who loved it.  If you go to this film expecting a traditional, three-act narrative structure, with likeable characters and/or characters who will eventually be redeemed, then you have come to the wrong movie.  This is not a Hollywood, feel-good movie about the triumph of the human spirit.  Instead, The Master is a groundbreaking film that you have to watch with an open mind.  Ultimately, The Master is an incisive exploration of the eternal struggle between the spirit and the flesh.  As the cult leader, Phillip Seymour Hoffman represents the realm of logic and the mind, of science and rationality.  He approaches life analytically and always needs to be in control of his surroundings, and the people in his life.  Jouquin Phoenix, on the other hand, represents the unchecked flow of primal, animal nature.  This the the central conflict in The Master...between someone who constantly needs to be in control of his life, and someone else who resists all methods of control and repression.  The reason why this film alienates so many people is because of its disquieting portrayal of human nature--in the world presented in The Master, no matter where we run to, we're always presented with the startling realization that in this life, there is no escape or redemption, there is only the constant struggle for power and domination.  The only thing that separates us from the animals, Paul Thomas Anderson seems to be saying, is an ultimately futile desire to find a higher force to comfort us, but what if that higher force is using us for its own purposes?  I believe this question is what The Master is ultimately exploring.
034580404X|5.0|Was a bit leery to order this for a gift.  But when I received it, it was in perfect condition, brand new condition.  I was excited<br />and please to wrap the trilogy & present to my friend for her birthday.
B0061PEAUY|5.0|I love all of her books. This one did not disappoint me. Action paction packed and lots of tension between Tempe and Ryan.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|Love it!My homeschoolers use it , and love the size on the Kindle. It gives us extra calculators wherever we are.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I just downloaded this a few minutes ago and I would say this has the quickest pain free set up of any of the rdp type apps I've tried. I have another one that I use a lot, it has a few more features, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is not good with technology.  This I think my parents could use.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|So easy to use and holds a memory for those who want one.  It did come in handy at the grocery store when I needed to put something back and my total went to zero.  The memory had my total and history of entries so it was no problem catching it back up.  :)
0307346609|5.0|was expecting this book to be like the movie... i was wrong... much better!! lots of excellent research done during developement and lots of detail... happy happy happy
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|I love MailOnline!  It is so much fun to read.  This British publication has more news about US celebrities and other news than US publications.  And, it's free!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book due to its immense popularity, thinking it would not be great but maybe along the lines of twilight without the vampires. It is in fact the worst storyline I have ever read, the characters have no depth, the plot is not even a little believable, and the sex scenes are in fact pretty poorly written.
B00BJS7104|5.0|Awesome movie from beginning to end! I was on the edge of my seat the entire movie. Great movie, will recommended!
B00CHSPB8Y|4.0|This game is kinds of repetitive and plays just like temple run. Also the graphics aren't that good but not bad.
B003NX76BM|5.0|This is a story about Search and Resque Dogs, and how they are trained.  It starts out right in the first chapter,with a search and resque of a small child. IF you love dogs, you will love this story, Its mostly about 3 S&R dogs. and a pup called Jaws.  You will fall in love with Jaws, and the other dogs. This story has dog teams, murder, kidnapping, likeable people, and some not very likeable people. Nora Roberts is a well known writer and a well writtin writer.  Her books stand on their own.  This one is outstanding. you will love the main characters, and the supporting people, and the training the dogs go  thru..  I recommend this book for just about any one, especially Nora Roberts fans.  If you are not familiar with her works, this is a great one to learn about her style and if you would to read any more of her books<br />Germaine Rosenquist
B004B8DH98|4.0|Like \\"Up In The Air\\" he implies certain life choices kill relationships and alienate you and an elite boss can destroy you.  Even after decades of mistakes, a redemption and new path at loving connection can open up.  But if you wait too long or continue destructive behavior, new wounds will rob you of time to enjoy them.  It uses the hitman genre to convey much broader realities.
B000059MEL|5.0|So, I ordered the album off the Amazon main store and it made it to my house within a few days, no long wait. Then I hurriedly opened the package to find this glossy double LP packaging by Daft Punk. These guys take their time and really think their brand and concept/s out thoroughly. Any fan or music collector WILL appreciate that... The art work upon opening the LP is interesting and the LP's are finely pressed... Ok, the songs are stellar and sort of flow into one another making for one cohesive listen... STANDOUT TRACKS: Face to Face, Digital Love, Harder Better Faster Stronger, Something About Us & Aerodynamic... The album is SOLID.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Start with the first season! This is a great show, very dense and will not make sense if you watch it out of order.  It is an HBO series so expect R for violence, sexual content, nudity and language.
B00795P4EG|1.0|Does NOT do what it says it does in the least, the demo showed how to use but in real practice it doesnt work, takes a bunch of the photo you didnt want to remove out, I tried it on a subject to remove a darkened area in the back of her and it took part of her out and at one point did not even remove the darkened area period. awful, what a ripoff, waste of time, adobe had or has this feature and that too never worked the way it was demo'd......a royal pain, easier to just erase or use a program with clone and cover the object up or cut and paste the subject into some other back ground etc........it was a cheap app, but I guess you get what you pay for!!!!

B00C7TAF3Y|2.0|maybe it is just me, but I like games that take you from scene to scene wth fun graphics etc, this one is a BOX plain and simple , that is the ONLY scenery and it is a total bore to play, the 3 D effects do not save this from the snooze factor either, it is dark, and just not fun......at least that is how I found it........maybe I missed something
B00136NUG6|4.0|always loved they're music, and this sure brings back all the fun I had during that era of time, loved to dance!!!
B000PY6BBI|5.0|We showed this movie to our kids the other night and they loved it. They asked us for more movies from our childhood. Michelle Pfeiffer is beautiful and the other cast members did a great job. Wonderful love story!
B008JH5CVS|3.0|usual tale with typical cliches. I like Guy Pearce so I watched it. It would be nice if for once a women in trouble wouldn't act like an idiot. The whole spoiled and nearly too stupid to stay alive is ridiculous.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great action flick. It helps fill in some of the gaps but you really to see the individual movies. Special effects were done with style
B0098VYKSA|4.0|A lot of fun. The Queen was evil and dastardly and there are moments when you don't know if some of the characters are good or bad. lol loved the special effects and really adored the evil Queen. lol
0671646788|4.0|purchased as a gift, arrived promptly seemed to be well appreciated by the person for whom it was i ntended
B0052TDGQO|4.0|Love the sound of Scotty's voice and cheered him on AI.  Wish him much success and his gift will continue to grow.
B002N7RAH4|4.0|Funny with a dark underpinning.  I like Simon Pegg and Hot Fuzz helped that along.  I laughed and I worried because there was more than just craziness.  But I was cheering his character on all the way.
B009OYSFDM|4.0|Certainly better than I thought it would be. Gritty and the hero is so determined it causes him to be blind to other options and the cost of this quest to himself. I will keep watching.
B007Y36K46|4.0|I don't care what the pre release movie propaganda has to say about this film.  It is a fun film with good special effects and a nice old fashioned hero against the world plot. I suppose for younger audiences who didn't grow up reading Edgar Rice Burroughs like I did, the film isn't relevant. But I don't go to movies to be civilized, I go for entertainment and escape from daily problems of real life. I go to be entertained and John Carter did that. I suppose they could have advertised it as the fantasy it is and that might have made its reception more agreeable.
B007UXT6T6|4.0|I didn't like the previous MI films. Thought they were just so so. But I enjoyed the hair raising stunts and Tom Cruise so intent and focused in this. The whole man with a personal mission worked for me. I'm one who has to weed through Tom's performances to find the gems.  I think this was one of his best 'fun' movies.
B007L5KT76|4.0|Great fun, fast paced excitment. The actors work very well together. I like Roberts interrpretation of Holmes. He is more connected to the world than many of the portrayals allow Holmes to be, which I think permits him to infiltrate the seamier elements easier. I don't dwell on Robert's not looking like classic Holmes. I think that is a nit pick that will just distract from his performance.
1741791529|1.0|The 2012 version of this book is some 60 pages shorter than the previous 2008 version (368 pages as compared to 428 pages—a difference that is actually much larger than it appears when you strip away sections on culture, history, and language and only focus on the travel guide sections—276 pages of travel coverage in 2008 to 205 pages in the new version), and in many instances the loss in coverage is substantial.  Take the city of Qeshm, for example: in the 2008 version LP lists 7 hotels, 2 restaurants, and a money changer (very important as you get a 20% better rate than banks offer); in the 2012 version (page 271, viewable in Amazon's &#34;look inside&#34; feature), however, there is only one hotel, one restaurant, and no money changers or banks listed. The rest of the information on Qeshm island is clearly based almost exclusively on tourism information provided by a local tourist/development organization (the Avaye Tabiate Paydar Institute), which may be very helpful but doesn't really meet the standard of truly unbiased, honest, and independently-researched advice I expect from LP. This is a major downgrade, but rather typical. The story in nearby Bandar-Abbas is similar: there is no information on where the inter-city bus station is located, and no notation on the map as to where it might be... even though the 2008 edition clearly showed this information. Arriving at a bus station at 6 in the morning and having no idea where the station is relative to the rest of the city is not fun, but it's especially frustrating when you later discover having the previous edition of the guidebook would have solved this problem. These examples are quite typical, and the removal of such important information is difficult to justify.  In other instances, the information just completely misses the mark. An example of this would be the walking tour in Yazd. While it seems like a great idea, the map and the locations marked are not accurate, and actually trying to follow thewalking directions/route will lead to frustration as things are not where they are claimed.  A significant part of the problem is that there has been a major change in authors between the two versions: Mark Elliot was responsible for the chapters on Western and Northeastern Iran in 2008, and Andrew Burke covered the rest; in the 2012 version Mark Elliot is out, and new authors Virginia Maxwell (Central Iran and the Persian Gulf) and Iain Shearer (Western and Northeastern Iran) have taken over all coverage outside of Tehran and Southeastern Iran. This has led to not only a dip in quantity, but also a dip in quality: much of the 'new' content appears to be little more than regurgitations of tours offered by local tour agencies. This is unfortunate, but probably an unavoidable trend in guidebook writing. The decrease in quality is so severe that even a Iranian hotelier who is prominently featured in LP—and is thanked in the credits—wholeheartedly agreed that the previous edition was superior. Apparently the coordinating author (Mr. Burke) wasn't able to spend more than a few weeks in the country for this edition, and the contributing authors were essentially parachuted in to provide quick coverage of the country. While this explains the shoddy coverage and the tendency for the book to mimic tours that local agencies and guesthouses offer, it is pretty dreadful.  It is also quite interesting that despite the author change, much of the text remains word-for-word identical to the 2008 text, even in the sections that supposedly have completely different authors and/or were previously penned by Mark Elliot. I'm not sure how it possible, either morally or legally, for the exact same text to be attributed to two different people, but apparently that is what LP would have us believe.  ------------COSTS, PRICES, AND DEVALUATION OF THE RIAL---------------- As others have noted, the Rial has crashed in the aftermath of Western sanctions, resulting in prices being around one-third of what they used to be. This makes the Lonely Planet prices way out of whack, as they decided to price everything in US dollars and not Rials in this edition (they made this decision because US dollar pricing was seen as less susceptible to inflation, which typically was 20% or more per year). So in order to figure out what things should cost, you have to convert from LP's US-dollar prices to Rials using the exchange rate LP uses, and then maybe add a little bit for inflation. The net result is that things cost about one-third as many US dollars as LP quotes. Unfortunately, a few unscrupulous businessmen (I'm looking at you, Vali) have decided to use LP's US-dollar pricing, which means that they charge about three times what they used to charge before the devaluation (e.g., the LP quotes $10, which used to be maybe 120,000 Rials, but now they charge 360,000 rials, which is still $10... even though their rivals who price things in rials would only charge maybe 150,000 after inflation). Anyway, things should be much cheaper than they appear in LP. If they are the same price as LP lists, then you are almost certainly being taken advantage of.
B008220C56|2.0|I love Kiera Knightly, but this movie did not do her justice.  It was difficult to follow the story line and was frustrating to watch.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Very quiet, however, the temperature didnt decreases as expected, just a mere 2C°.. On the plus side, it brings everything you need, to the thermal compound to the last screw. Use it together with the articsilver and this all done.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|This book was simply wonderful! I cannot remember the last time that a book evoked so many tears and belly laughs. Amazing!!
0786838655|5.0|I read these books with my son. They are so adventurous, full of mystery and magic and gods. There are lessons to be learned without being obvious. Thank you. Thank you for writing books I can be proud to share with my son.
B005K0HDGE|3.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book all the way up until the end.<br /><br />It's kind of frustrating to work your way through a long book like this one only to be disappointed in the way it ends.
B00683JLXA|2.0|There is very little control and no way to get  extra help.  Not fun at all,  Will delete in from my kindle
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I spend too much time, but I have fun  with all the levels.  Easy to use and just fun.  FUN&#60; FUN
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love this app...use it all the time love the large numbers. Use the app when paying bills I don't have to carry a seperate calculator.
B000VWYNOG|3.0|I listened to it, but gave it to a friend; just not quite my cup of tea.  My friend loved it!
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Well, this book certainly starts off with a bang. I won't give anything away, but there is a really gruesome scene in the first chapter that involves two starving children attempting to hunt for food. I'm definitely the squeamish type, so I barely made it through that section alive, but it certainly did a good job of introducing the reader to the horrors of what being a poor Russian in the early 20th century would've been like.<br /><br />While this book has an excellent, if cringe-worthy, opening, I disliked the author's choice to introduce so many characters all at once. I have a hard time with retention (which is obviously perfect for a voracious reader!), and it always makes it difficult to remember/tell apart characters when you learn about so many within such a short time frame. Although, I understood later in the book why this type of character introduction may have been by the author on purpose.<br /><br />This book wasn't necessarily scary, but it was a little creepy and very upsetting. Learning about what it was like to live in Stalinist Russia was a huge eye-opener. I love historical fiction, but I've never read (or even studied) anything about Russia, so I had no idea what I was getting myself into. The way that their government was run was really frightening. It's hard to imagine that things like that actually used to happen (and still happen in some places in the world today).<br /><br />The author's choice to make the protagonist a government official was really interesting. Almost immediately, I began to sympathize with him, even though I learned about all of the horrible things he'd done in his life. As the book goes on, you begin to like him more and more, and it's strange, because you really should probably hate him.<br /><br />I figured out the \\"twist\\" pretty early on in the book, but there were still so many other surprising and exciting elements to the story that I really didn't mind. And the ending was really good. I wasn't sure how it was all going to wrap up, and I was very happy with how the author decided to do it. I'm excited that there is more to this story, because I really want to find out what happens next!going to wrap up, and I was very happy with how the author decided to do it.

B004ZMWUCU|4.0|A very sad, tragic story when reading about the fact-based orphanages...yet filled with humor and hope<br />...a good read for all.
B004742Y68|4.0|A classic that hopefully doesn't get remade in the era of the hollywood remake.  Liked how the used the white noise of the tv.
B004VFMCWE|4.0|Michael Douglas does a great job showing the repercussions of a man who is damaged.  He shows how at any time a person with a shattered psyche can go off, and how they may not be a criminal, but can still be a danger, both to themself and others.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott Card (OSC) has written the ultimate commentary on how perception and reality are not the same, but they do overlap and affect each other.  OSC took the ingredients for an intriguing, coming-of-age, adventure tale and prepared a delicious stand-alone story that is entertaining all by itself.<br /><br />However, if you enjoy reading and re-reading a book to extrapolate the cross-layers of a rich fabric, then you will enjoy the tapestry that OSC has spun from the fibers of real-life politics, religion, education, war, and social interaction.<br /><br />This is a must read for all science fiction fans, but more importantly it is a multi-genre, literary classic for everyone, and it speaks to a person on many levels about the complexities and consequences of life decisions.  With the possible exception of children, whose parents are concerned about their child's exposure to adult language and a few violent scenes; I highly recommend this book for all ages.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Follows in the Lord of the Rings series. Starts off a little odd with everyone decending on his house & eating all of his food.
B00CM96A60|5.0|Once again AVB comes out swinging. He is the only one that can pull off trance and classical and blend them together in an effortless way. I predict that \\"This is what it feels like\\" will be the smash hit of the summer. If the radio would only play his songs to the mainstream audience he would own the airwaves.
B00846REIS|4.0|Good, fast read....leagues ahead of those redundant Christian Grey novels---less S&M (thank goodness!), just as sexy, and written by someone that is literate!  Yay!!!!
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I absolutely love all the tracks to this CD!  It's very different from my *NSync, Mariah Carey, and Taylor Swift christmas albums.  Rod Stewart has an amazing voice and its refreshing to hear him singing some classics and some original music!

B005LAIH2W|5.0|with a new take on how he got there and why Mars was dying, the characters and action are true to the original.  I wish it had done better as I would like to see another.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Even though the ads are irritating, this game works well and you soon learn to bypass the ads. Graphics when you win are cool!
B004EPYZSK|4.0|very cool movie and an interesting take on redemption.  Amnesiac bad guy Craig tries to set things right as aliens threaten the earth in the old west.
0765325950|5.0|Yes, I think Jordan would have written a better book - but I think Sanderson did a pretty good job in finishing up another author's work.  And either more of this was Jordan's material or Sanderson did a better job mimicking him, but this book felt much closer to Jordan's work than the Towers of Midnight did.  I don't mind that not every plot line in the series was resolved, and while I could easily make a list of things that did bother/annoy me in the end I enjoyed this book immensely.  Seeing the characters I've know for almost 20 years finally come into their own was worth the wait.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|there are not words to say how well all the various parts of this movie come together.  that they managed to create an ensemble out of solo artists shows a mastery of film I don't think can be beat.  matched by the best perhaps but not beat.
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|Disney's prequel to the 1939 MGM classic \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" is a feast for the eyes with many magical moments.  It's beautifully photographed with some amazing special effects, including the sequence in which several of the characters travel via giant soap bubbles, and the scene in which the Wizard fits together the pieces of a broken china doll.  The sets are amazing.  It's clear that no expense was spared in the making of this film ... and yet, on some level, it fails to achieve the emotional resonance of the earlier film.<br /><br />I think that \\"Oz, the Great and Powerful\\" suffers because we, as the audience, don't really have a central character to root for.  In the 1939 film, the main focus was on Dorothy and her quest to return home; in the prequel, we don't have a genuine hero or heroine.  The wizard is a bit of a greedy scoundrel throughout most of the film (and a womanizer to boot); the China Doll and the Monkey are just sidekicks, and none of the witches, not even Glinda the Good, is ever vulnerable enough to inspire much sympathy or concern.  And so, without that one lovable lead character, \\"Oz the Great and Powerful\\" is reduced to a visually splendid but emotionally aloof blockbuster.  It's definitely worth seeing ... kids will especially love all the color and action ... but it's not a classic for the ages like its predecessor._____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br /><br />***** REGION FREE CONFIRMATION FROM AMAZON UK, dated JUNE 4, 2013 @ 3:00 PM CST *****<br /><br />Hello,<br /><br />I'm sorry for the delay in responding to your e-mail message.

B008YWY0HK|5.0|the moral of the story is that when you talk to someone they aren't really listening if you are talking at them and aren't listening back.  fun to watch more than once.
B009MXSWI8|4.0|Book of the Dead, Bruce Campbell, excellent effects work (for that era), need I say more? Loved it the 1st time, & it was great to revisit this classic.
B0041T52S6|4.0|a very strange collection of characters that are not quite grown up.  very strange arcade combat highlights the pursuit of his dream-girl as she seems to have hooked up with every wacko she ever met.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is a classic story, well acted and beautifully portrayed. Ifbyou only watch it to see Maggie Smith, you will be glad you did.  The character development is interesting, and the loyalty yet tension between the classes makes for lots of intrigue. I am always looking ahead to the next episode.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|this is a very good take on the Green Lantern comic books.  Reynolds does a very good Hal Jordon from the early comics
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great serial...beautiful setting that draws you in and makes you feel like a guest at Downton Abbey.  The characters are well defined and draw you in to their world.  I find myself jeering the villain and cheerring the heroes.  So glad I became a fan, as many others have.
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Duffy has a great voice and a way with a catchy lyric.  didn't know before I heard her that the Welsh had blues but she does it right.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. Every chapter brought a new surprise. I can't wait to read the next book.
B007L6VR12|4.0|very strange and very funny.  helps to have grown up at the same time as the feel of the early 60s is very much in control of the action and some younger viewers might not get all the humor or context.
B00BZOD63S|5.0|Can't get enough of Guillermo Del Toro, love his books and his movies. Will definitely recommend. A must see. Two thumbs up!
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|absolutely true to the book but with a few insights I may have missed when I read it; as well as the depths that Bilbo discovers in himself that surprise him and everyone around him except maybe Gandalf.  you also get a glimpse of the arrogance of Saruman that later brings him down and hints of more than a working relationship between Gandalf and Galadriel.  all that being said I think my favorite part was Radagast the Brown and his bunny sled.
B00CE379IM|5.0|Made me want to read the book, a definite must. Will recommend to my friends and family. Great special effects.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|This was a good read, think ill catch a few other jack reacher stories. Will also recommended this series to friends.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I love puzzle games of this style and enjoyed the challenge of beating the time, earning all the stars and figuring out how  and when to use tools earned to help in the game.  I hope the developer creates more games like it.  I will definitely buy!
044042321X|4.0|I haven't read any of the actual books. I have simply watched HBO's Year 1, episodes 1 through 3 (DVD), which is the sum total of what this graphic novel covers.  I would have liked to have known ahead of time that this graphic novel covers only the first three HBO episodes.<br /><br />This graphic novel (Volume 1), along with other 'paper' books I bought, got me up to speed as to who is who, who is doing what to whom, and generally what is happening -- it helped me get my footing, in other words. I shan't need more of the graphic novels because I now can follow the DVD/HBO story.<br /><br />The storyline, drawings, and paintings are superb, which are all very detailed.<br /><br />Two of my favorites are:<br /><br />[[ASIN:0615540325 Game of Thrones Season One Essays]]<br />[[ASIN:B008OCCYG4 Game of Thrones Season Two Essays Illustrated Edition]]<br /><br />by Pearson Moore, in paper or Kindle.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This is an exciting and educational game with enought interaction and challenge to keep everyone entertained. The graphics are exceptional.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|Loved this show.  Family and friends talked me into watching and now I'm totally hooked.  I need to catch up before the next season starts.  Love Charlie Hunnam.
B00BBW16HW|4.0|Heartwarming and often funny. Great acting and I like it because it was based on a true story and had a happy ending
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Much more to this movie than I expected. My grandson and I watched this movie together on blue ray, the colors were awesome. The best movie for kids this year. All who watch it will be entertained and leave feeling great.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|The more you watch The Good Wife, the better it gets. The characters develop as does the way they interact. The cases are quirky and moving and interesting every time, but the long term stories of the characters and the drama itself are what keep the seasons getting better. Margulies is stunning from every possible perspective, starting with a look at her talent.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|My grandson first saw this movie on the big screen and he had to own it, now I love it also. Great movie for the whole family
B0057R5XRG|5.0|It is wonderful to see Jurassic Park in in Blu-Ray.  Having the full set is even better.  These are movies that warrant repeated watching.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|Loving this new music from the guys! Very different feel than The Block, but awesome all the same... Some great songs that have become favourites, but all in all, I love all the songs! NKOTB forever!!!
B00ACKU1NY|4.0|This is a really cool app, let's me watch french TV in the US at the same time as it airs. I just wished it had more channels but I doubt there could be a better deal on the market!
B005LAII12|5.0|it  is so funny as the bear is like human and smokes pot,  drinks beer and brings home hookers. he got a funny sence of humor and owner is real stuck on him as he drinks with him and smokes pot! he even tries to hump a cashier  post lol as where bear works as i cashier in food store!
B000W93CHC|5.0|A follow-up to Pillars of The Earth with all the style and intrigue you would expect from a Ken Follett novel.  I love historical fiction and was very happy with another novel written so brilliantly.
B0000714BP|5.0|This movie is so awesome, I loved all of hem together and especially that Patrick Swayze, that man. Miss you Patrick!
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I have always enjoyed these movies. Was disappointed because it was not as good as the other movies that the did.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like the look of this big calculator! The ads don't get in the way on this free version that I'm using. It's a nice addition (pardon the pun) to the apps on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00A3XWB10|5.0|Once again these guys have surprised me with catchy and killing songs. The whole album is remarkable though \\"Anarchy\\" and \\"Garden Of Babylon\\" are the tracks I like the most. I'm really glad I got to know who these guys are. Rock on!
B0042FZOFU|5.0|These movies gave me all the feels! Scared because this kid's toys are flippin' alive! Happy because they are like devoted little play slaves. I'm pretty sure Woody would take a flare gun for this kid! Sad because the kid grows up eventually and they get stuck with some lame girl (although her porcupine toy is pretty sweet). Angry because Woody is the. most. whinny. cowboy. ever. Seriously I can't count on my hands and feet how many times that dude guilt trips his friends! But really... All the feels... IN HIGH DEFINITION! Putting these demon toy movies on Blu-ray was the best idea any company has ever had ever. And human flight exists! Five stars, Pixar.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is quite a lot of fun you do not won't to put it down. Good graphics and you feel when you fall down.

B0038P59A0|5.0|Great movie as are all of the Robert Downey movies and the Sherlock Holmes series are. Family type movies that the whole family will enjoy.
B003XYE7R2|5.0|Engaging timeless mystery.  Enjoyed the well-written story, so many words no longer used in modern English language.  What seems like an impossible mystery to solve, is laid out meticulously by our hero, Sherlock Holmes.
B002RPR6DU|3.0|I saw this when I was a lot younger and thought it was really futuristic.  Forty some years later, it ain't all that.

B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game not like most pay to win and there is plenty of energy to keep playing unlike most others
B004IFYMWK|4.0|Supposedly a true story, which reveals how Washington can destroy anyone with lies and deceit; nothing new!  If what was portrayed is true, then it is horrifying to thing of how power can corrupt.
B005PK57IK|5.0|The story lines in this series is quite entertaining and varied.  The lawyers, the law suits, the verbal battles are well written.  All the characters are real life persons with real life situations and conflicts. Very entertaining.
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I have tried several dictionaries on my Kindle Fire.  This is the easiest to use by far.  I recommend it to anyone with the Fire.
B009AMANH4|4.0|The movie got off to a slow start but eventually picked up.  Great acting from Daniel Day Lewis and Sally Field
B005SAJJHM|5.0|The entire cast is great.  Well worth the money.  I haven't enjoyed a show this much since Friends.  Just gets better with each season.
B00BUCW54Q|1.0|Just the same old action movie.. And all the one-liners by Cruise were horrible... Nothing good about this movie..glad to see Duvall in a movie, but not even his greatness could save this movie.. The female lead was horrible...
B005S9ELVC|4.0|It is \\"The Untouchables\\" on steroids. Sean Penn is a descent criminal but Goslin is botj a great good and bad guy. The cops use Thompson submachine guns while a lot of the bad guys German Mp 40s. What a weird symbolism
0062059963|3.0|I had a good time reading and cursing against the characters ... while egearly turning the pages...<br /><br />If the first volume was about a well known reality tv show maybe a little bit too developed, the author relies less on this in \\"The Elite.\\" Yet, the game is still on and the prince must choose his beloved.<br />And this is where I found that the story revolved around in circles.<br /><br />As there are no more dramatic elimination (except one), nor romantic getaways, the story focuses on the emotions. Unfortunately, America is still undecided. She wants to be selected by Maxon but continues to keep her opportunity open with Aspen.<br />And she dare to be jealous when the prince shows interest in another suitor. Not a great role model...  Our heroine seems to have forgotten that she is in a game .. She does not know what she wants, she is unfair and for these reasons, she is annoying. Surprisingly, she is also endearing thanks to her blunders full of good intentions.<br /><br />Maxon, as all male participants in \\"The Bachelor\\", he takes full advantage of the opportunities with its contenders. Therefore, he is annoying when he confess his love after making out with a different girl few minute earlier. An annoying player with a poker face...<br />But new revelations at the end of the book promises to spice up the next volume.<br /><br />If I turned the pages cursing, I still turned them quickly. This is the main thing!<br /><br />After that, maybe I would have ended the selection in this volume and I would have concentrated on the princess life at the palace once the cameras would be turned off because of the rebels, of the alliances and the king's attitude... All these ingredients announce a great page-turner potential...<br /><br />So, I look forward to the next volume should be more darker ...<br /><br />Lucie<br />newbooksonmyselves.blogspot.fr
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Fair story line.Poor writing and those awful,repetitive catch phrases. Not at all sexy but very  sexist in nature. Not worth the money.
B000I3UMKM|5.0|This film is a classic for good reason.  It manages to be light hearted but still probing.  Audrey Hepburn is a jewel.
B00BKBCF38|1.0|This is a very cheap budget cd packed in a simple \\"promo\\" cardboard slipcase devoid of any relevant info or lyrics. Save your money.
B002PJN59M|5.0|Great classic with great actors. This is one of the few movies that was able to simplify a story that had so much detail and history in relation to King Author and Sir Lancelot.
B0027MJU00|4.0|Not nearly as brilliant as Gone Girl, but quite entertaining. This book has some well drawn, complicated characters - all deeply flawed.
0525953728|5.0|I haven't read the whole book but it looks like its going to be a great read!  I'll have to wait and see if it's anything like the movie \\"Zero Dark Thirty\\"
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a fantastic story!!! Read this book twice!! Heartbreaking at some points! Definitely one I would recommend to my friends.
B0070DOHQS|4.0|It dorks very well, much better than others I have tried.<br />The only negative is that it does not Wake the PC if it is asleep.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun! I play it every spare moment of my life.<br />Like every spare moment. Even in class.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Started Bared to you on a vacation trip to the beach, read first two books in the series in two days, I really enjoyed these books and can't wait for the next one!!!  I haven't read that much in 10 years........ Resting up for the next one!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Went by fast..but was fun and something different.<br />Wish it had more levels!<br />Very entertaining and challenging at the same time.
B0061PEAUY|3.0|The story I found, hard to follow but in the end comes together nicely. I would recommend this book. OK book!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I bought this to replace a Microsoft Explorer wireless mouse. It was killing batteries left and right so I decided to go wired. This mouse is excellent. It is solidly built but still light. I had to use all of the weights since I was used to a wireless. It is incredibly precise and the buttons are laid out very well. This mouse has a much higher DPI than most in its class and is also less expensive. Two of my friends bought them as well and both are pleased.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Cost nothing and with the little bit of testing I have done, I am happy to say it meets my needs.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Like the game but my score froze on level 10 , I'm on level 17 and still no new score, but enjoy the game
B008602KQI|3.0|Don't get me wrong; the movie was entertaining enough. From the hype of it all, I guess I might've expected a bit more of... something. The characters were developed fairly well and the imagery was great... but the predictability factor was a bit too high throughout.
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|\\"Get information about the currently or recently running tasks: a thumbnail representation of the tasks, what activities are running in it, etc\\"<br /><br />Spyware is spyware and does not belong in a game/app that the seller is charging the end user a fee to own.  I can somewhat understand greedy programmers putting sypware in free games, but once you start charging a fee for a game/app, all spyware should be removed.

1401922732|5.0|Was guided to choose this deck, and it has served amazingly so far. Love the gold edges on the cards. Love the artwork on them. The answers have been outstanding from them.<br /><br />-love and light
B005S9EKCW|5.0|My daughters favorite movie.  Got it right on time at a good price.  We have watched it many times already.
1451627289|5.0|The book got to me as described and early. The book itself was a time travelling journey to stop The Murder; in the process the main character falls in love.
B003SHUMRI|4.0|What's not to like!!!!!!!! Channing Tatum  can dance and it was a great story too! my daughter is in love...lol
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Really liked this book from start to finish.  John Grisham is a great writer, that kept me interested in the story line, great ending.
B0014LX420|5.0|Some of Britney's best songs (yep, even the oldies!!) are on here. Great way to reminisce about the 90s or hear some of her more recent stuff.
B0040I09RM|5.0|Right it's the only show I'm watching on tv.. that speaks to how great this show is! Watch it..I need one more word
B002L9N4DS|5.0|The art of the box is really good, have some parts with hologram effects. Have two disc and looks extremely good on my full hd screen.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I listen to everything under the sun when it comes to my musical taste,and this is some of the most riveting and beautiful<br />music I have heard in years. No matter your favorite genre,put this in your player and you will be blown away! Lindsey plays<br />with a passion and depth you can feel when you listen to her music...bravo I say!
B003BW0CB6|4.0|Another good tale by a very good author' who happens to be a favorite of mine.Loved  the surprised ending! Have enjoyed all of Connelly's books - well written & easy to follow.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|I like this a lot.  The graphics are beautiful and this game is a delightful waste of time. Good job!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I really expected a lot more from this book and it really disappointed in it. The book did not keep my interest at all. This last book was just pointless
B00003CXWV|5.0|I just got my order of movies yesterday and I'm happy and excited the products I ordered are brand new, exactly what I wanted. This movie is great if you buy make sure you really order it from the seller amazon.com because if you order from any other seller you might be disappointed.
B00C1XZ2LQ|5.0|I watched Oblivion and the score struck me as one that I just had to buy. I listen to it as background music as I'm doing other things and it's great. My two favorite tracks are &#34;Starwaves&#34; and &#34;Oblivion&#34;.<br /><br />A must for score fans.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addicting! The interesting thing is the cop always keeps up with you don't let his big stomach fool you.I may not be that good at it,but I love it!!
B007SGM084|4.0|Great read for young women.  However some parts are very repetitive and if you are a more conservative person it may nit be for you.
B0000C1733|5.0|Great Hot Chili Peppers CD...I've been wanting this CD forever and the good thing it was cheap plus when I got it, it played great and also looked brand new...
B009GX69RK|5.0|New Girl always brings on good laughs. I watched the newest episode on the plane and was literally laughing out loud.
B000000OS2|5.0|Great CD... Even plays like a brand new CD...It had no scratches or anything on it, looked brand new to me!!!!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Took just about the right amount of time. A good challenge without being frustrating. Try to hold off using the hints as long as possible. A good alternative to the many shoot em up games out there.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|That's what Hugh has created, a new world. A world with uncommon challenges and a great range of characters. A world that lives and breathes on the edge of the possible...and I love it. Well structured, well written and a great read. The Wool Omnibus has left me wanting the story to continue, wanting more.<br /><br />So c'mon, Hugh! I'll be back after I go check out Shift...
B00AJAFNIA|1.0|wow...  pretty impressive if you are looking for a shameless way to steal someone's data.  lame game to boot.  looks like Amazon regressed a little on this one in defending its customers.  also kind of a neat demonstration of what you and 35 of your motivated thieving friends can do to pump your ratings up.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This season does not disappoint! It is fabulous. Acting is superb! Drama, romance and suspense all wrapped into one. Don't miss!
0316286850|5.0|When I received this book, I was amazed at all the make-up information jam packed in it! This is a great make-up manual for beginners and a novice.
B005DJGMQE|2.0|This could have been an interesting topic, but the acting was so bad, I couldn't stay with it and turned it off after 1/2 hr.
B0030F5W5K|5.0|If you like Patrick Swayze how could you not like this movie?  It's a crime drama, a comedy, a  love story, a little si-fi and a great cast!  Still great after all these years!
B008GJV8BW|4.0|The movie is dated and the characters are cartoonish, but still I enjoyed it for late night watching.  My wife didn't care for it; it may be better appreciated by men.
B00BUCXVPI|4.0|Great movie. Thrilling and keep you on the edge of your seat.  Tom cruise was bad ass. He played the part perfect.  Def bought it cus I liked it so much
B004NS710C|5.0|Surprisingly good movie, one that hast you on the edge of your seat until the very end.  One to watch again and again.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|It was a good read, but definitely not my favorite book by Sparks. Some parts just drag on and on.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|It's no Downton Abbey but if you are all out of Abbey episodes to watch this will fill the void. The characters aren't quite as lovable and the staff changes a disappointing amount but overall the show is quite entertaining.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I rly love dis game but u cant blow up the tnt without the tnt the game is just minecraft without tnt<br />?
0307888908|4.0|If you buy a book with this title you should not expect Nietzsche.  The text is light, easy to read, and includes the occasional clipart and upward-trending graph.  What it does accomplish is helping those looking to be successful in their career or gain incentive to change the needed tools and permission to take risks.<br /><br />It provides cursory nods at the big players in the career search/self-help field ([[ASIN:160774497X What Color Is Your Parachute? Job-Hunter's Workbook, Fourth Edition]], [[ASIN:0743269519 The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People]], etc. while also describing LinkedIn's approach to making connections.  If you don't want advice on how to market yourself and improve your career, this isn't the book for you.  I found it somewhat inspiring and was able to get a few ideas about networking from it, making the time invested worthwhile.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Loved this book!!!!! From the moment I began to read it, I couldn't put it down. Finished All three books in two days. Amazing story about courage, passion, and love.
B003L20IJM|3.0|I was quite disappointed to find that I had purchased a previous rental DVD which did not contain any of the special features.  If I had known it was a rental version, I would not have bought it at all.  The movie itself is not quite as good as the original, but still quite pleasurable.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is just you know really fun and great and fun for lots of people or kids and it is really fun for kids if they have an active imagination
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is all I needed in a calculator for my Kindle. When traveling it comes in handy. I have little need for square root function, so can't say I miss it. I really like the very readable display.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Its a challenge to take a story that people know and, from that, make a compelling movie. That's exactly what happened here. Brilliant story of political back room negotiating and deal making, performed so very well by a brilliant cast. I was so riveted to the movie, and the dialogue was intriguing and compelling. A must-see with entertainment, insight, and all the good things one wants in an intelligent movie.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|This fast paced legal drama follows the trials, in both court and life, of Alicia a devoted wife who reenters her professional life as an attorney in a large law firm. Her legal skills may be a bit rusty, but Alicia is determined to overcome both her husband's betrayal, and the competitive environment of her firm. The series blends legal and family drama into a compelling story that is supported by first-rate acting and writing.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|It's hard to find a good series these days but this is one of them. It was well worth watching.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|You truly have to break out of the first 60 or something pages to really start to LOVE this book.  DO NOT expect the movie to have the same effect on you, at least in my opinion I wasn't very impressed with it.  The book, however, was an amazing story of how lives can transcend the borders of time and impact each other in ways unbelievably imaginable.  The book truly pulls you into each characters world and that's all attributed to the great penmanship of the author.
0786891416|5.0|The writing in this book is so fun to read, partially because its based on my favorite show!!  Passed it along to my mom to read too, big fans!!
B000FBJAOG|2.0|After reading World War Z and loving it I figured I'd try this book out.  Though interesting, its much like (and to the authors defense that is how its written) an instruction manual.  Its about as entertaining as reading how to put your flat screen up on the wall.  Helpful knowledge inside in case there is an ACTUAL zombie apocalypse though.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Glad I finally found this show, the chemistry between Castle & Beckett is fantastic. I can't wait for season 5 to come out!! I absolutely love this show!!!!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Goodreads Description- WICKED above her hipbone, GIRL across her heart<br />Words are like a road map to reporter Camille Preaker's troubled past. Fresh from a brief stay at a psych hospital, Camille's first assignment from the second-rate daily paper where she works brings her reluctantly back to her hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls.<br /><br />NASTY on her kneecap, BABYDOLL on her leg<br />Since she left town eight years ago, Camille has hardly spoken to her neurotic, hypochondriac mother or to the half-sister she barely knows: a beautiful thirteen-year-old with an eerie grip on the town. Now, installed again in her family's Victorian mansion, Camille is haunted by the childhood tragedy she has spent her whole life trying to cut from her memory.<br /><br />HARMFUL on her wrist, WHORE on her ankle<br />As Camille works to uncover the truth about these violent crimes, she finds herself identifying with the young victims--a bit too strongly. Clues keep leading to dead ends, forcing Camille to unravel the psychological puzzle of her own past to get at the story. Dogged by her own demons, Camille will have to confront what happened to her years before if she wants to survive this homecoming.<br /><br />With its taut, crafted writing, Sharp Objects is addictive, haunting, and unforgettable.<br /><br />If I had to pick one word to describe this book it would be disturbing.  There were times when I was reading that I just had to stop and give myself a break because the content was very difficult to handle (at least for me) emotionally.  Every single character in the book was just plain sick.  I don't want to have any spoilers but the ending was very flat compared to the author's tone the entire book.  You can definitely tell that this book was her debut because this book is nothing compared to Gone Girl.  3 stars.
B0091Q82L8|5.0|I put off buying this for too long, mainly due to reviewers stating that Leeds was superior, but finally got my own copy. In one word, \\"Whoa!!\\" The clarity of the drums and bass is astounding. It stands shoulder to shoulder with Live @ Leeds and Isle Of Wight, but is different enough to warrant the purchase. A must have for Who fans...
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|We only saw the third season of Downton Abbey. We had missed so much of the story in season one and two!<br />We have loved every minute of the three seasons. I only wish  the 4th season  would be available soon!
B008I34Y6W|5.0|Frank Zappa is the Stanley Kubrick of modern music and One Size Fits All is a masterwork of collative learning and listening.  All the tracks contains layers of hidden melodies and motifs repeated both on this and throughout his other works.  A genuine modern masterpiece!  The entire album resonates from beginning to end.  Favorite tracks are Inca Roads and Sofa No.1. If you've never heard Zappa's music and were looking for an introduction, this is it.
B00AB7HESI|1.0|This was so slow to load and it deleted itself twice. DO NOT BUY IS WASTE OF MONEY.And waste of time
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a relaxing but challenging game and I enjoy it on my Android tablet just as I do on the computer.
B003EV6DBM|5.0|The more I watch the show the more I enjoy it. There is definitely a difference in the story writing of the shows from Eccleston to Tennant and that of Smith's. The current one seems more complex, almost movie-like in it's approach to suspense and progression. I especially liked  &#34;The Wedding Of River Song &#34;. That was very good. Likewise, Neil Gaiman's  &#34;Doctor's Wife&#34; was a good way of imagining the TARDIS outside of its comfort zone.  I may be wrong, but I swear the voice of the antagonist reminds me of the voce over from &#34;Jack Of Blades&#34; of FABLE game (Xbox). Very sinister.<br />&#34;Fear Me. I've Killed Hundreds Of Time Lords.&#34;<br />Matt : &#34; Fear Me. I've Killed Them All.&#34;<br />Epic.<br />Rewatching Tennat's right now.<br />Peace.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I like the benefit of books, but I miss the games that I downloaded to my Kindle [before it died]. Particularly the crosswords, like Everyword Crossings. Perhaps you could add that and others to my Android download capability.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This is one of the best free games I have played.  If you think you hit a wall on tough challenges, start a new deck to grind out some runes for the &quot;rare&quot; purchases.  You really shouldn't ever have to pay money if you are patient but it is very tempting to.
B0055S348W|5.0|It is the only app that I could find to work well. I love it.<br />It is so easy to use
B00003CXRM|5.0|The story is a little off but the oneliners and the music changes this movie from a dumb movie to one you keep watching just because.  This is my third copy.  The other two are worn out.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|really cool. I wish you earned more stark credits each mission though. but overall it is a really fun game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love having YouVersion. It has wonderful devotionals and makes it so easy to stay in God's Word&#34; eveyday. Daily bible verses sent to my phone everyday is a blessing.
B009B8YZKS|5.0|When I saw some pics for this movie at some websites, it felt like youtube movie put together by a bunch of fans and I was not very interested in it. But now that I watched is I have to say I am quite surprised by the quality of it.<br /><br />******************************PROS*******************************<br />Indepth Personal story: The story revolved around a non Master Chief character, a cadet called Lasky. More you follow the character, more you get interested and more you like him and other cadets.<br /><br />Great acting: I personally didn't know a single actor, but I have to say I loved the acting of almost everyone of them. They all really add different colors to each cadet's personality. Well done.<br /><br />Master Chief, aliens and Halo universe: I like how they slowly introduce him. He is in rather small portion of the story but where he is, he still kicks some major butt.<br /><br />Quality/budget ratio: This is why I gave it a five star. There are Hollywood movies that have 10x or 20x  budget of this movie and they still fail to deliver. Compared to that this movie is shot on a smaller budget but really delivers it.<br /><br />******************************CONS*********************************<br /><br />Budget: Since it is on a small budget, action is not as great as say movies like Iron Man, Transformers, but it is still pretty good.<br /><br />*****************************CONCLUSION*****************************<br />I say it is a must buy for Halo fans, but if you don't at least watch it. You won't regret it.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|Enjoyed the detail of simple life and routine matters that the author provided. I truly felt sorry for the main characters.
B009AMANH4|4.0|Very interesting and intense.  Enjoyed it very much.  Wish it had been more about the Civil War and a bit less about the passage of the Imancipation Proclomation.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|Odd direction to take the show in this season but, fantastic non the less! We love Dexter Morgan Blood spatter Analyst.
B009CCBCU4|2.0|Did not read past first chapter! Did not hold my interest. Was not my type of a read. So sorry.
B001UTW7QU|1.0|Where do you get the idea that I would watch this piece of crap? I have never in my life done so!
B007SGM084|5.0|The book has been a wonderful read and exploration into our own desires. We have enjoyed the series so far.
1455523550|5.0|This book is really wow! This is the story of Erin/Katie who's been abused by her cop-husband. She ran away, cause that was the only option left.<br />She wanted to start over some place knew and ended up in a little town called South Port. There she found love again. But her husband couldn't let go, he hunted her down like a dog chasing a rabbit.<br />The books is easy to read and has different angles, it tells the story through Katie/Erin, Kevin and Alex's vision and you will get a sence on all of their thoughts. I think it makes the book an awesome read. And some surprises in the end! (Ofcourse I am not gonna tell you what that would spoil the moment)<br />Even though I am more a fantasy kind of book person. But this is a truely amazingly written book, even for guys to read, it is not only a women's book. I think I will read some more of his books in the future.
6305252572|4.0|I saw this movie for the 1st time around 25 years ago.I liked it a  lot . I saw it again recently on tv. It is a must have in my video<br />library.
B00AG6Z92C|4.0|This cd has some of his most beautiful music, especially if you like the Latin beat. I play it when I'm driving. It's very relaxing.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|At first, i thought &#34;it just a book about a guy stranded on Mars,&#34; but I just spent the last several hours finishing this e-book. What a great page turner. I wonder if it will ever be optioned as a movie?
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I just recently discovered this series, and have been watching them through from the beginning. Season 5 is by far the best so far (I haven't seen all of season 6 yet, so can't compare that). The theme of the crack - the rift in time and space - is one that continues throughout the entire series, holding it together in a way that previous seasons were not. Previous seasons were all scattered stories, which were great, but I like the long-runnning storyline.<br />Matt Smith makes an amazing doctor - he's got the right personality to be slightly clumsy while still maintaining the idea that he's ridiculously smart. People ask me how I like him compared to David, and I say &#34;I like the doctor&#34;. Because they're both awesome in their own ways. Also, Amy and Rory are in my opinion the best companions yet.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Harry Potter is one of the only movie series that nerd types can use to actually get hot girls into bed with them. It's the Gandalf pillow cases that loses the deal..
B00499QUK2|5.0|This is an excellent version of Sherlock Holmes.  Love both of the leads. It is quirky and smart. Love the use of cellphones and texting.
B0002KZAKS|5.0|These are Equal to the Shure 58 Mics but at an even better price. Came with a hard case and fortune cookie.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|This book is a easy read and well written. I don't like the therapist and client being friends, since this is a huge no, no in a therapeutic relationship. This book kind of disregards that ethical rule and actually highlights their relationship outside the therapy room.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I hated the whole concept of this show when it first came on.  The whole &#34;stand by your man&#34; theme is a turn off to me.  So much praise and so many awards finally made me curious and now I am HOOKED!  I am a fan of Julianna Margules  but she will always be Doug Ross's partner to me.  That said she is stellar in this excellent show and now I get to watch one episode after another.  Yea Amazon Prime!!!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I bought this on the recommendation of a friend and thoroughly enjoyed all of it! The story subject was different than what I normally read, but it was riveting, magical, and strangely believable. I highly recommend this to anyone.
B000001FKY|5.0|It's Del Leppard.... if you like them this is a great album... if not.. oh well maybe there is something else out there for you  B HALL
B005MLOKXA|4.0|My newest addition! Alicia and will the tension is fierce! And Peter wow love him! Can't wait to start Season 3!!
B0060MYM3S|1.0|I know I order a lot of books, but this is ridiculous when I receive a book instead of the DVD.  I did return the book, but my account has not debited back the money for the ORDER I DID NOT RECEIVE, nor has the CORRECT DVD been delivered.  So yes I am extremely dissatisfied with this order
B00633W614|5.0|Really interesting.  Kept you guessing.  Can't wait for next book.  A real page turner. Surprised by the ending.  Good characters.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Wonderful historical novel---- understanding the nuances how the War started--- was very enlightening. AGAIN Follett spins a story, which you cannot put down!
B006LSZECO|3.0|As a mystery, this book was definitely a page turner.  However, the characters were all so unpleasant and unsympathetic - I felt disgusted reading about them.
B00284G2JE|5.0|Sealed. Good condition. can't get high enough listening to it. Great cd for tripping. It's great for falling asleep also.
B006R1T40I|4.0|Since I have admired this singer and her blues capability for a long time, and this is the sixth of her CD's that I have purchased, I found nothing to dislike in this recording, and will continue to folow and buy her recordings.
B0089LOKHG|3.0|I love Lauren Oliver but the end of this book made me so angry I was expecting something different more explanation about the other characters but there wasn't any but the book itself was great but if this is really the last book in the delirium series then I'm disappointed. Hopefully she makes another but I love her and the book but the end isn't what I expected or wanted to be honest. The book is about love and New beginnings and there just might be some loses and betrayals in between.
B007KDFWRG|3.0|This is the second title from this duo I have purchased. Disc 1 of this title was great, but Disc 2 strayed into very lengthy renditions of well known and too frequently recorded Gospel numbers, which I did not find appealing. However, I find their creativity and frequent surprises in their own material refreshing, so I will continue to follow the band.
B004N66XYE|5.0|YOU CAN'T TOP THE ORIGINAL UPSTIARS / DOWNSTAIRS BUT THIS CAME CLOSE.  SO GLAD TO SEE THE OLD EATON HOUSE AND EQUALLY AS GLAD THAT THEY BROUGHT &#34;ROSE&#34; BACK.  WHAT GREAT MEMORIES.  THE ONLY PROBLEM WAS THAT IT WENT TOO FAST.  YOU REALLY CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF UPSTIARS  / DOWNSTAIRS
B000UOOT1W|4.0|Although a rehash of previous big sellers, I hope it is not the precursor to a whole new range of Golden Oldies, which tire rapidly from overexposure. The guy is a great guitar player, with a unique style, and I love the beat, but I won't buy many more compilations.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Keeps my CPU cooled to low 30s, mid 30s (overclocked). I bought this mostly because the CPU fan I had before was really loud (or so I thought, it ended up being my video card). And these fans are absolutely silent.<br /><br />This thing is a TANK! I had to remove one of the case fans on the side in order for it to fit. But it's worth it to keep the CPU a tad bit cooler than the stock fan.<br /><br />It was an easy install. I had to remove my motherboard, but after that it was easy to put on. If you happen to have another person helping you, it will be even easier (Just make sure you remember to have an anti-static wristband or gloves. Don't take any chances! lol).<br /><br />The only problem I've had is that it only directs air vertically, instead of horizontally, but that's just the way my mobo is set up. I've seen other people with this cooler and it directs air horizontally (air in through the front and out through the back, instead of just directing it out into the case).<br /><br />I liked these fans so much that I went and bought a pack of four more, and now I can't hear anything on my computer accept the hard drive :).<br /><br />This was money very well spent.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|This book is terrible.  Boring, boring, boring.  You don't care about any of the characters.  The author fills pages and pages and pages with short stories written by one of the characters.  I started skimming through ten pages at a time and then would stop and read one paragraph to see if I was missing anything and then skim through ten more pages.  Thank goodness it was a kindle library rental and I didn't buy it.
B002HJ9PTO|2.0|I bought this to make a few youtube videos with (mostly rants and things of that nature), and was disappointed to find out that it's only mono (must have missed that on the page :P), so I have to fill the other channel in an a/v editing program. I can't take a star off for that since the page clearly says it, but besides that, there is a lot of fuzz in the audio when I record and it really takes away from the quality I go for. For $20 (although not a lot in the electronics market) I thought it would be a little bit higher quality than it is. It's still an alright mic, and I'm a fan of the brand, I just haven't found any use for it since I realized how limited it is.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great conclusion but I would love to read another trilogy Post-Memory of Light to see how main characters progress afterwards. How about in Brandon?
B002CIY8EM|3.0|I've always heard so much about this book, I thought I would finally bite the dust and read it.  It's okay....but I'm a little disappointed in how poorly it is written.  There is nothing that irritates me more than to read a book that is full of grammatical and spelling errors.  Now, I don't know if those are in the original, or just in the Kindle version.  But sometimes the sentences aren't even complete sentences.  I think that when this was first released, it would have been a real shocker, but now that there is so much else written about ancient aliens, it is behind the times!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This series is great.  Although the story line is starting to stray from the book, I still consider this a great series
1600597963|4.0|This is a great book for those looking to learn more advanced techniques than simple brick stitch, have fun while doing it, and turn out some lovely work into the bargain. Photos are clear and neatly sequential.  Instructions are also very clear.  Those photos?  LOOK at them!  They really help with the more complicated directions.  I've made three projects here so far, and one was for someone else, who absolutely loves it!!
B009R659L8|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone.  Easy read and keep your attention. Mary Higgins Clark did it again.  Although all her books are about the rich, wish she would write one of someone in the middle.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I can hardly wait for the next book to come out. I enjoyed reading the first two books very much. I would suggest this to others.
B0006J28MI|5.0|My son really loved this movie, and the quality of this DVD was good overall we are happy with it.
B00CMOH7P8|5.0|You have been living under a rock. It is simply the best TV show ever! Go ahead and buy it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Well written and the acting is exceptional.  The name of the show kept me from watching in the beginning, but it was recommended by my daughter and her friends.  I find myself caught up in the moral dilemmas faced by all of the characters.  Real life is full of such.  I'm rooting for Alicia and Will but she is also a mother.  Protecting your children often trumps romance.  I look forward to finding out what the future holds for them.  Highly recommend the series.
B0064MGU98|5.0|love it to death never tried watching it on television i wish that it on the nights i don't work.
B00APUYWYA|3.0|My nieces who are 8 and 11 loved it, me not so much.  This is a younger audience movie for sure.
B00AJAFNIA|5.0|Fast paced, fun game that I think could use 2 tweaks to make it just about perfect.<br />So, in game you are the moon and you're trying to make it back to the Earth before the Crab Nebula eats you. Along the way, you orbit hundreds of other planets in order to keep you on your way. I've in orbit, you tap to sneeze, then you fly straight away from the planet.<br />There should be a couple Modes: like this, and one where when you tap you continue to travel in the same direction you are anyway. You'd leave tangentially, not perpendicularly.<br />My other gripe is that while in game, new situations cause the game to pause while you read how this new thing works. At that moment, I just skipped past, and bite I'm not sure what a gas giant does.<br /><br />Otherwise, it's great! I enjoy it, and I'll keep playing.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|we started watching with season 1 a few months ago.  caught up quickly and can't get enough!  Big Bang is our current favorite.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Barely has a storyline. The one it has was not achieved. An interesting idea but poorly executed. Mr. M was AWFUL. It's hard to believe he could actually act at one time. Some great cheese I admit. But, that's about it.
B0040I09RM|4.0|Good drama and I love the outdoors scenery as it reminds me of southern California. The characters are good too.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Beautifully written novel with many unusual twists and turns. Wonderful characters with depth. Excellent historical fiction. I will certainly read more of Kate Morton!
B000I9YLWG|5.0|I watched this when I was a young teenager at the theater. It was -at that time- the scariest of that time. And the shower seen was really the 'talk of the town'. I saw a newer one but it just doesn't compare to the first original as far as I am concerned! Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh are great in this.
B005VC4FLW|5.0|I loved this movie! One of my favorite movies of all time.  Made me laugh a LOT! You won't be disappointed
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Very boring Not enough action. I guess I have to forget the free games. You get what you pay for.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google finds anything and everything you are looking for. Just type in a few letters and Voila!, there it is.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Good interface, very stable, works smoothly over slower links. Haven't tried vnc but rdp works really well. My favorite rdp app.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|this is such a great game and entertaining for kids would definently recommend it . my son loves to play w anemone and friends
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I've read several other books who claim to be as hot as the Fifty Shades series was but Sylvia definitely delivered! I did like her characters and the story line however it was very similar to the Fifty series.. rich troubled hot guy and the girl that saves him. It's still definitely a great read!
B000W93CHC|4.0|When Ken Follett  takes you back in time, you can almost taste and smell the middle ages.  A rare look at the past.
B0063GORYU|3.0|I sorta like it.  I think I like the one on my laptop better.  Are there other versions of this game?
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I am a dog lover!!!  And I also enjoy racing.  Enzo  tells his story the way I think all our dogs would if we could only understand them.  Good book for many readers.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The premise is interesting.  Maybe it's because I've read too many books, but I could see the basic equation this story uses, and there weren't many surprises for me in terms of the plot.  Overall not bad, but not great.
