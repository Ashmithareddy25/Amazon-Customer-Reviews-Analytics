B007D2XSW0|4.0|I was a little worried after reading the first few reviews, but I'm really enjoying this app. One of my favorite pic editors so far.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The only reason one would continue to read this trilogy would be to see how it ends but it doesn't happen soon enough.  I feel the author needs to bring some style into her writing.  If Ana is so sharp she would most likely not be a virgin in 2011 and would have a better vocabulary.<br />Christian is obviously damaged goods and Anastasia (Ana) sees something in him besides the obvious and it turns out that she is almost as crazy as he is for kinky sex.  There is way too much repetition in the description of their numerous encounters.  How Christian always seems to turn up everywhere and still run his numerous holdings is a mystery.  At least it has more or less a happy ending.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|This book gives you a great perspective and history of the ultramarathon.  It is a real page turner.  I couldn't wait to find out what happened in the races the next season.  The recipes are great--just be aware these are high calorie athletic endurance recipes.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I just got these games today; the game's I have played on my kindle fire work really well. I recommend you get this!!  It really is fun.
0345803485|2.0|Once you've read Anais Nin, A.N Roquelaure (Ann Rule) or even D.H Lawrence (Lady Chatterley's Lover) books like \\"Shades of Grey\\" by EL James can't hold a (wax dripping) candle.<br />I was so looking forward to reading this trilogy but, stopped mid-way bored out of my mind... If I read one more line about her protagonist, \\"Anastasia\\" \\"blushing or gushing\\"  with their silly soap-opera names i was going to throw up.<br />I can think of hundreds and hundreds of other adjectives to describe these same emotions so you can really feel it:<br />\\"His mere presence caused my warmth to spread, causing my lips to tremble, bitten a deep, juicy red, every shade of pink first, \\"soft red\\" the blush of a sweet rose' wine. Like ripened grapes, squeezed in a childs' small fist, juice running, picked recently and tenderly from the vine...i wanted more.and more.of him.\\"
B00002N9ER|5.0|I ordered this and thought there was one in each package, but there were two in each. No big deal, can always use them. Just be aware.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|out of the last song, the notebook, and the lucky one [the only 4 i read] i honestly love this one the best. you always expect the main characters to fall in love, but in this one they dont. i also love the book because every time they part they say &#34;i will see you soon&#34; instead of &#34;goodbye&#34; which is what they say a the end. i already read this from my public library but i want to buy this on the kindle.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really enjoyed the storyline of this trilogy.  Well written.  Couldn't wait to finish this one and move one to the 3rd book.<br />Oh Christian!
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is a very fun game I love it and instead of just watching Tv I play temple run
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this came it is so fun. sometimes I just want to kiss my kendle so hard because I got a new high score or sometimes when I get mad at my kendle I hit it because I lost.I hope you will like this game as much as your friends and family and your pet if they can play the game oh and if you have a turtle or a dog I am so happy for you.lil brb bye
B000GCFO0I|5.0|I really enjoy this movie. I've seen it in theaters and bought the dvd when it came out. I watched this movie with my friend yesterday and it was so hard to watch. She didn't get who the creators were. She didn't understand that they were all dead. She didn't understand how the father could be walking around the same school and not find his wife. She made it very hard for me to understand the movie. I never had question's about it before, but thanks to her I do. Either way I enjoy this movie. She should have just enjoyed it to. It's a movie. It's not suppose to make seance.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is a really great app. Has multiple levels. Runs smoothly. Keeps your attention. Makes you want to come back for more. Try it. Don't care much for the ads but they can be terminated without. much work
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This is by far the best keyboard for Android phones out there. It is a must have if you have an Android phone. With the latest version out it is faster and smother than ever before and if you take the time to read the little nifty shortcuts it will save you a ton of time.
B00005N6KG|1.0|Just purchased the addidas cx 680i.. you really get what you pay for with these, spend some money and get some nice head phones
B007L3BMGA|2.0|This book isn't really all that well written (in my humble opinion) and the story is a bit lacking, but the sex scenes are great - and there's PLENTY of them - so that's why it's hard to put down.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this game it is so fun sometimes I get mad at but it is still fun to play with friends and family.
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|I didn't know there was a Sex and the City 2 till one day I was shopping at Costco and saw it. I really enjoyed Sex and the City Movie so I was pretty excited to order Sex and the City two. I just finished watching the movie and I'm not as happy with it as I was with the first movie, but it wasn't bad.
B007SGM084|3.0|Aside from the characters being totally unrealistic and extremely far-fetched, the hideous editing job, and the endless redundancy, I wouldn't call this series a total waste of time.  The sex scenes are mostly dull and repetative, and do not at all live up to their hype--the best, IMHO was the car sex scene while hiding from a stalker.  For me, these books do not reach deeply enough into the soul of Christian Grey.  He is so made-up and lacks the depth you would find in most people, especially in someone who has been through what he has been through.  That, I think is what I find most disappointing; the lack of character development, especially when the author had over 1500 pages in which to accomplish this!  Also, La Cote D'azure is not close enough to Versailles (just outside of Paris) to visit in an afternoon when hanging out on a boat off the French Riviera.  That is junior high knowledge for most readers. The book is mildly entertaining but never gets gritty enough for my tastes and the characters are not fully realized.  Too bad, it had such potential!  I am not a romance novel fan.  If this is how they all are, I guess I never will be!
0099579936|1.0|Borrow this book from the library....honestly not worth spending the money to add to your book collection or rewarding the author for such poorly written book.<br /><br />The last reviewer said it all for me. Ive actually enjoyed reading the book reviews more and found they were actually better written than the book in question!
B006NFKUF6|5.0|That was really cool except that it wasn't long but it was freaking awesome!I was kinds hoping it would be longer. To bad it wasn't after the scene with the helicopter.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is amazing.  I love this game. it is for all ages. I wish they had this game sooner.
B001DDBCUA|5.0|I've never been interested in Sex and the City show's. But my friend couldn't stop talking about what great shows they are. Since I am  a DVD collector I decided to buy the dvd to see how I feel about the show's. Well I really enjoyed the movie and I have a feeling I will enjoy the show too.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|cant save to SD?  Cant Load from gallery? limited features and FC's often?<br /><br />really why bother wasting 5 bucks!?  just wander over and purchase PicSayPro.  i use it even for editing photos i sell.
B0072IVGZG|5.0|Great CD and great packaging. Hope this band finally wins a Grammy. The songs are just as good live. A must buy for ant hard rock fan.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Love, love, love the Outlander Series of books.  I read every night, and with this book I look forward to my \\"reading time\\" all day.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|it is so easy to trick the game.I just did this for coins. yay!good game too many adds. I like coins.
0345803485|2.0|I feel this book glorifies rapist, sex offenders.<br />Even though everyone is entitled to enjoy their own personal experiences. This book needs to be available only for adult crowd. Do not leave it lay around, it may not be something you would want your teenager to read.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|we really love this game a lot. my kids and I really have a good time with it. wish it was s llittle easier to girt acorns.
0142410314|5.0|Roald Dahl's entire published work should be required reading. He's a magician. I loved all his books as a child and I recently bought them all to enjoy again as an adult.  I have made my friends read them to spread his works to others.<br /><br />This short story is written in the same style as most of his other works.  Not everything about people or life is pretty -- but there's always something to learn from it.  Roald Dahl uses vivid imagery, fun language, and immerses the reader.<br /><br />Get it. Smile.
B0006A9FMI|5.0|I am a fan of the whole Ghost in the Shell series, specials and movies and this was a great addition to the collection.<br /><br />The animation was EXCELLENT.  Lots of CGI was used that was very well done.  It was at the point where you forgot that what you are watching was rendered on a computer.  The surround audio was well done, even startling my cat when a dog barked behind us.<br /><br />The story was interesting, just like all the Ghost in the Shell stories are, and fans should not be disappointed.<br /><br />This particular DVD did NOT have a English dub included on it - that is available on a separate DVD.  Your choices are Japanese 5.1 Surround (which I watched) or Japanese Stereo.  Subtitles were available in a number of languages.<br /><br />I recommend this highly, but those who need dubbed anime will need to look into getting a dubbed DVD.
B0086700CM|4.0|... but you either pay to unlock things or play for dozens of hours.<br />Simple concept, works well on my Kindle Fire.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is a good app for free...it will keep you busy with trying to get all the games--some are crazy hard to get and they are too &quot;expensive&quot;! It will take me forever to unlock all of these games because they require tons of in-game coins to be earned. Most of the games are enjoyable, just a little tricky.
B000068OCS|5.0|It arrived much earlier than expected. It was well-packaged and  in excellent condition. Most importantly, it was as I remembered seeing it long ago and a truly unique film. I enjoyed it then and will continue to enjoy it for many years into the future.<br />A five-star rating to the seller!
B003ZHR6RK|5.0|This movie's a classic.  It's great to have in your collection and let it entertain you once in a while.<br /><br />The quality is good. The price is right.  I'm pleased and would get it again.
B007VGXS8M|5.0|My boyfriend and I love this game! It saves us from boredom waiting on long lines for appointments and driving on car trips out of state. So much fun!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Not sure why other people have problems with it.  It works fine on my Thunderbolt.  It is a memory-intensive app so if u have an older phone then dont use it.
B007RRFUHM|4.0|As others have said, the album is great, Kimbra is amazing, but the production leaves a lot to be desired. The percussion is drowned, especially in comparison to her videos and her live performances. I barely hear drums in Cameo Lover, and Settle Down, which is my favorite song of hers, sounds totally bland in the album. Thank goodness at least Plain Gold Rings was the live at Sing Song version, which rocks BTW.<br />Despite the disappointing production, I still felt that, with an artist as promising as her, it's important to buy her records and keep her around for a long time.
0553801473|1.0|There aren't any heroes in this series anymore.  Just a lot of new torture, rape and depravity.  I enjoyed the first two books a lot, the third was mediocre, but the last two are tedious.<br /><br />It seem's like Martin's only purpose in writing characters who you enjoy is to kill them off in some new betrayal.  Now that I've read this book almost every character that had any honor or dignity has been stabbed in the back.<br /><br />This series is starting to remind me of Robert Jordan's descent into book after book talking about tea and the color of the sister's dresses, excepting that Martin uses rape and torture instead of tea, and all protagonists dying substitutes for dresses.  Feels like repetitive filler throughout the book.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I've been using this for a month or two now and am pleased with it.<br /><br />It's tiny but mighty. Definitely an effective flash.<br /><br />I like that it is unobtrusive, light, and cheap.<br />It doesn't take up too much space in my bag, doesn't get in my way, doesn't scream \\"HEY LOOK AT ME AND HOW FANCY I AM,\\" and it gets the job done.<br /><br />I'd recommend getting the Sto-Fen diffuser with it.
0240815807|5.0|This not only improved my audio skills and studio strategies, but also my song writing and understanding of acoustics. My tracks have seen a NOTICEABLE improvement and I haven't even finished the book yet.
B004QL7K6G|5.0|This film was not marketed at all, and so almost everyone missed it. This is a damn shame because it's the funniest movie I've seen in a while. While it's not as smart or original as Role Models, Wanderlust is probably funnier on a joke-by-joke basis. When David Wain is at his best, his humor comes not at the expense of the characters, but because they're so fun to watch. Wain is at his best here, and anyone who's ever enjoyed any of his stuff needs to own this DVD.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I'm running ICS on my Transformer Prime and I cannot load pics from the gallery (says that loading from the gallery is broken on the Kindle Fire - great, but what about the Transformer?)<br /><br />Can't really test it if I can't load pictures, so it's getting uninstalled.
B004JN1D2I|4.0|Great Book. I started reading after the show was mid way through the second season. The show almost directly resembles the novel but cuts the fat where necessary, although I'm quite enjoying getting little extra tidbits that help explain some of the actions of the characters on the show. I have trouble creating what these people look like in my head and the novel has even more characters than the show but after you get into it, you recognize the main characters and can keep track fairly easily. Super long though!

B007I2BZIE|5.0|These guys are still amazing! I honestly wasn't expecting a classic but boy I was wrong. This is easily one of their best albums and only gets better with each listen. Clockwork Angels is a concept album yet the songs can stand on their own. I love BU2B and The Garden the latter just might be their best album closer of all time. This album brings back that amazement I first felt with RUSH when I was 17 and bought Roll the Bones on tape. Geddy, Alex, and Neil should be very proud of themselves. I look forward to getting the book.
B004UXUX7S|2.0|I think people got fooled by this film because it has good actors, a directors who has done some good work, and a strong opening of 15-20 minutes. But then it goes nowhere, does nothing, and resorts entirely to cliche. There is absolutely nothing here! If you'll be suckered into getting emotional about a character who has been comatose the entire movie, and whom we learn precious little about along the way, and if you enjoy the tritest ever speech about the natural beauty of Hawaii, then I guess you might get some pleasure in watching this melodrama. For the rest of you, my advice is please don't waste your time.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Use to upload to FB. Can save to my computer from there even when too far away for direct saves. Grandkids love saving art to gallery and sending to parents.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|This is an amazing transition of styles flowing from jazzy to sassy. Songs that smile; haunting melodies; emotional ballads; powerful vocal strides. Love it. Well done indeed, Ms Jones...
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm speechless this game is ....................... awesome.awesome awesome awesome awesome awesome. want to play so bad. let me re phrase that need to play so bad
B002PEP4SC|3.0|I just finished the book Heat Wave.  I am a big fan of the tv show Castle so I thought it might be fun to read the book that is mentioned in the show so often.  I found the book somewhat disappointing.  I thought it was rather boring.  I may have enjoyed it more if I hadn't seen any of the shows on tv.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so fun. i play it in my kindle fire all the time. :) its got a good story line. its evebn great for kids.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|There are plenty of other erotic novels that I'm sure are better written than these... I don't understand how this series is getting so much attention. I've never seen the same phrase repeated so many times in one book... then multiply that by three. Drove me absolutely insane. I kept reading because I was told I had to read them, they were the greatest books ever. But no, just no. The third book has slightly more plot than the first two, but they all seem like they were written by a child. Save your money.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Everyone is bashing this app, so I decided to try it since it was free. On Samsung Galaxy S it worked fine. I could open, edit, save, everything with no problems. Don't let the reviews get you down, just give it a try.

B0086700CM|5.0|great free game good power ups that don't require real money to purchase I have been playing for a while and still find fun

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so much fun and it gives you self determination! I believe whenyou play this game you put yourself to the test I know that may sound wired but honestly that's what I experience. this is truly a five star game I would recommend this to anyone with a Smart phone, kindle, Ipad,.
B00795P4EG|5.0|Really cool and fast. There's times when I wish I could open this on the pc instead of photoshop since photoshop take so long.<br /><br />For rubber stamp type of automatic removal of defects in a picture this is great.
B002ND62ZO|5.0|ANOTHER PERCEPTION:<br /><br />The matador is Death. He is inevitable and inescapable. Not cruel, just there -- and he has come for the bull, who will fight for his life and lose. But don't feel sorry for the bull for the bull will die fighting, a chance not given to other bulls -- who will die without dignity.<br />The people who enjoy watching are not yet aware that there is a matador for each of them. Not cruel. Just there. Inevitable. So what do you do? You get drunk and have a lot of sex and sleep so time will pass.<br />But what if your manhood has been taken from you and you are deprived of the chance to Be A Man and fight your matador with dignity. No, you have no balls, so you will die with out dignity. You can not even love, for the woman will be disappointed. You can't consummate your love if you had your balls shot off in the war. Only love makes life worth living. So if no woman will love you because fate has emasculated you -- well, you represent a whole \\"Lost Generation\\" of men who were emasculated by the war. Terrified. All men realize all men (and women) are good only for slaughter. They have smelled death. They have seen Death at work. They know Death comes for each of us. They have learned love cannot save them.<br />But don't worry because the Sun also rises. (That's a Heminway pun for those who don't get it -- \\"rises\\"? You don't get a rise if your balls have been shot off in the war. A whole generation . . . emasculated by war.

0345803485|2.0|E.L.James is no literary lion, that's for sure, the writing is poor and the story drags. Ana is too naive to understand that she can take the bull by the horns because Christian is so besotted with her that he will do anything to keep her, she doesn't need to sign any contract, or give in to his ridiculous sexual escapades. I want to slap her silly but then realized what does she know about it all, absolutely nothing, and I think that is why Christian wants her so desperately. I had a hard time reading this book, it kept me awake (because it is disturbing) and anxious (how would he wound her next) and weepy (she needs to talk to someone but can't because she signed the confidentiality clause. I wish that Ana's friend Kate had taken a bottle of Christian's favorite wine and whacked him over the head with it. Beware of gorgeous young men who fly their own helicopters.
B007U1FEJE|5.0|This new Beach Boys music is the Best! Brian, Mike, Al, Bruce, David along with Jeff captures that California Harmony sound on this CD that made this Hall of Fame Band famous. No fast car type songs on this CD this time around. A little slower up beat music that the harmonies are just Beautiful. Which song do I like the best? Being a big fan I love them all. If you want summer, joy and love back in your life, check out this CD and their tour. Another Endless Summer from The Beach Boys with this new CD and successful World tour.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so awesome I love it it is so cool. I know everybody else calls it stupid well those people. who say that stuff u totally wrong this game rocks I LOVE it!!!

0345803485|5.0|This one hits the ground running and doesn't stop.  You can actually put yourself in Ana's shoes, or at least this book makes you want to be in Ana's shoes!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this game. its good for wasting time and very addicting!!! my daughter loves it as well...some of the games are hard but once you hang of them its no problem

B0063IH60K|5.0|This is easy to use and fun. I have other products, however none seem as User friendly.  I would purchase this product again.
0099579936|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book after the reviews. But was very disappointed and found it hard to finish. The writing is very poor and repeats ( Ana ) the main character saying over and over 'Holy'to almost every sentence. It is very boring with a boring story line, basically about a male ( Christian 'Mr Grey ' ) who is the dominant over student Anastasia, and their on off relationship, will she stay with him, or leave him.<br /> Of course she is going to stay ! A young girl taken in by a multi millionaire. HMMMMMMMMMMMMM ! leave that to you to guess what she did.
B001NLKT60|5.0|AMAZING! Did not want to put the book down. Did not start off as slow as The Girl WIth the Dragon Tattoo. LOVED THIS BOOK!
B00846REIS|5.0|One word to describe this book...PHENOMENAL!!!  I consumed this book in less then 6 hours and immediately called my best friend and made her buy this book.  We haven't been able to stop talking about it since, and are actually depressed that we have to wait for the second book.  Fifty has nothing on this, matter of fact I think fifty was sort of PG compared to Bared to You. A MUST READ!!!!! A most!
0345529057|5.0|This product shipped quickly, and in perfect condition.  I love this series and highly recommend it! Anyone who likes the HBO series \\"Game of Thrones\\" will love these books!

B005WUHAX8|3.0|Pros:<br />1. It's sleeker than an Otterbox and offers much more protection.<br />2. I feel better knowing that my phone is protected against dust, damage, and water.  Although I think PURPOSELY submerging your $700 iPhone in water is for a-holes (nothing is 100% guaranteed foolproof, not even Lifeproof.)  But it helps knowing that if I accidentally got it wet, it would most likely be okay.<br />3. It feels sturdy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />1.  It was a b**tch to put on.  This was because lint kept getting inside the front cover.  I had to take it off and clean it about 5 times before I got it right.  They provide a lint cloth to clean it, however this put MORE lint on the cover for some reason, so I used my finger to try to brush the lint off.  In the process, my finger left a light scratch on the plastic screen.  I am not sure why, my fingers are not rough.  I tried to buff it out with a cloth and scratch stayed.  It's a very fine scratch, but still a scratch.  Makes me wonder how many scratches my fingers will put on the plastic screen just with daily use.<br />2.  Once I got it on, then the air bubbles under the screen started.  This is due to the fact that the home button is slightly raised, so air gets in.  However, this video on youtube helped me get the air bubbles out. [...]<br />3.  The case retails for about $80.  Get your heads out of your butts, Lifeproof.  This case should retail for $39.99 or $49.99.  That would be reasonable.<br /><br />I didn't do the water test.  Personally for me, I didn't see the need.  I was mainly looking for a phone case that would completely surround/protect my phone from dust and dirt and daily wear.  I don't plan to take it near a tub or in the water because the risk is too great, even with Lifeproof.  I read too many Lifeproof reviews saying it leaks.  But this case works for me because it protects from dust and dropping.  I just hope the screen doesn't scratch anymore...ch anymore...
B0053TWVDC|4.0|I got this movie because I had never seen it. And I always wanted to because my mom didn't let me see it as a kid. Ha, ha.<br /><br />I first assumed it would scarier than it was. A good movie, but a little streiotypical. It depicted farm kids and town people to be all farmers and unintelligent. They all have biblical names and simple ways of living. The children weren't as frightning as they should have been to victomize adults. And the concept is a little corny (yes, pun intended) with the monster we never actually see as well as killer corn is really just humourus to me.<br /><br />But other wise a good watch, something that can be enjoyed from time to time. But still, definitley not a fav.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I've been crazy about watches my entire life.<br /><br />As a watches collector I have an Omega Seamaster 300M James Bond, a Rolex Submariner, a Raymond Weil Tango Chronograph...but my Tissot PRC 200 Chronograph is my favourite!<br /><br />I bought this watch in 2006 and I love it! The time is amazingly precise. I even used it a couple of times for scuba diving in the ocean and it has continuously been working as a dream for six years!  No issues at all!<br /><br />I also have Seikos and Citizen but Tissot - particularly my PRC 200 with a black face - belongs to a different league. And looks wise? In all honestly it gets more attention than my Omega James Bond!<br /><br />Congratulations to Tissot!!!

B007D2XSW0|3.0|Thia app is free today and I recomend downloading it. I have tested what the other review say it cant do and it works fine. It saves to gallery, you upload from gallery (or camera), you can rotate pictures, etc. But I do have picsay pro and it deserves 8 out of 5 stars. It exceeded my expectations. I still recomend installing this just because its not bad, and its $5-free. (Motorola Droid 4)
1936608898|5.0|After working in healthcare for many years, one thing is blatantly obvious, in respect to health, it all starts with food. While most people are aware that their food choices have some effect on their health, they are often misled as to how much of an impact our food makes. With so many different nutritional recommendations out there, who knows what to believe? Dallas and Melissa Hartwig of Whole9 break it all down for you in their debut book It Starts With Food. The book covers everything you need to know about eating for the rest of your life. They will open your eyes as to what food really is, and expose the so-called `healthy' foods that are really making you less healthy. Don't let that get you down though because they have tons of good food suggestions to fill your plate with, and sound scientific reasoning to support all of their dos and don'ts. This book offers so much more than just advice on what to eat. They expand to the practical applications of the information, as well as the psychology behind why we make some of the bad choices that tend to creep into our diets.<br /><br />It Starts With Food is written in an easy to understand style for the layperson, with all the studies and a gazillion references to satisfy more critical scientific minds and health practitioners. One thing that really makes this book, and the Hartwigs themselves stand out is that they are the first ones to point out where scientific evidence is lacking or inconclusive. There is no smoke and mirrors here- just the truth. While many of these topics may sound pretty dull, Dallas and Melissa's fun and casual trademark style keeps you interested and engaged every step of the journey. Information that may have made you fall asleep in your college biology class is suddenly fascinating though the words of the Hartwigs. My personal favorite parts of the book are their myth-busting sections where they critically evaluate common myths in regards to calcium supplementation and osteoporosis, cholesterol, saturated fat, and many other important topics. I have always wanted a concise, easy to understand way to explain these confusing topics to my own patients, and am pleased to now have a resource to direct them to and help educate them.<br /><br />If you have been eating clean for a while, following other paleo books and Whole9's blog articles, you may be wondering if you should bother buying this book. Yes, you should. This is not just a compilation of their previously published free articles. This is not just another list of what to eat. This is a wonderful tool that will inspire you to continue making good choices. With the information contained in this book, you will be more confident explaining and recommending this lifestyle to others. You will learn how to modify your already paleo diet for your activity level, for your personal health problems, as well as a few recommendations on paleo in pregnancy too. As always, you should work with a licensed health care provider when treating medical conditions, and this book can help start the conversation with your doctor, and fine-tune your diet for your specific situation. As Dallas and Melissa often point out, context matters.<br /><br />After I finished reading It Starts With Food a few days ago, a good friend eagerly asked, \\"Is it as good as we hoped?\\" My response- \\"Yes!\\" Dallas and Melissa Hartwig continue to set the bar high for both themselves and the rest of the paleo community. It Starts With Food is better than anyone could have hoped for, and should be mandatory reading for all!
038533348X|4.0|There is a great deal of very witty satire in this short novel that resonates with anyone who lived through the sixties.  Vonnegut is dead-on in lampooning the child-like idiocy of twentieth century science in playing with forces that it neither understands nor can hope to control.  Also effective is Vonnegut's critique of religion.  He imagines a deal struck between the founder of \\"Bakononism\\" and the head of state to keep his religion illegal.  Somehow the unholy alliance between the state and religion has a way of corrupting the latter.  This is quite well done and amusing.<br /><br />As for the principles of Bokononism itself, on one level Vonnegut seems to be preaching a \\"free love\\" philosophy and hostility toward organized religion that were so much in fashion 50 years ago.  But on a deeper level, Bokonon seems to be making the age-old challenge to how God can tolerate so much stupidity and evil in His universe.<br /><br />On the down-side, I thought much of the book could be pared down -- including an interminable plane ride to the fictional island of San Lorenzo and endless discussions/letters between Newt and the narrator that do little to advance the plot or ideas of the book.  Also, the book lacks the true depth of feeling that later made Slaughterhouse Five a masterpiece.<br /><br />So, I'd recommend Slaughterhouse Five to anyone who wants to read Vonnegut now.  \\"Cat's Cradle\\" is good, but not great.<br /><br />In the audiobook version of this novel there is a ridiculous interview of Vonnegut where Vonnegut posits that his German heritage somehow kept him from being accepted by the literary establishment.  I suppose Vonnegut did not get the literary acclaim he desired.  This was probably more the result of snobbery toward best selling authors than any hostility to German Americans.  Or it could be that Vonnegut had a habit of saying a lot of silly, eccentric things.  But his writing is generally good and his books, particularly Slaughterhouse Five, are worth reading 50 years after the fact.

B007ZCQJOM|5.0|Beach House really stepped up for this album.  They kept the unique washed out electronic sound that was so great in Teen Dream, but added a little extra energy and variation to create an album that isn't just background music.  If you liked Teen Dream, don't hesitate... buy this.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|was concerned while reading all the &quot;1&quot; ratings that it was a waste of money and it indeed is not! you CAN save pics directly to your gallery after editing and you CAN rotate the pic (couldn't get my pic to rotate for the life of me then saw the edited but with a picture of a turning arrow, sweet!)
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love this program. It really helps me write my stories and refer to websites between my kindle fire &amp; my PC.  The only issue is the format squishes words together sometimes. Not a huge issue for me, just odd.

B0053TMP24|5.0|I have been reading these books by Rick Riordan and they draw me in every time. They have just enough to keep you hooked reading them. I find myself laughing and relating to the characters all the time, even if they are just teens.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this app because it gets harder as u go on, it is free, and u can shop in the store for different people, wallpapers, and upgrades. The only thing I don't like is when sometimes I drag my finger to turn, but the game ends because u have to press hard.

B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is ten times better after this latest update. Thanks for putting so much work in to it. I love the new themes.
B0072IS13G|5.0|This is Schleich's best dragon ever. From what I understand this is a limited edition 2012 figure. Mine was on sale when my boyfriend bought it for me.<br /><br />The dragon is very biologically designed. The anatomy seems loosely based on dinosaur anatomy. His head/skull is very expressive, with eyes facing forward in the skull, like Tyrannosaurus rex or other large theropod. This differs from other reptiles which have eyes on the sides of their head facing out. He has a small frill around his head like a ceratopsid dinosaur.<br /><br />He is quadropedal, with toes that face inward, like many of the large Cretaceous dinosaurs. He also has a long clubbed tail with spikes on the end, like an ankylosaurus.<br /><br />The integumentary system is also more like a dinosaur than a modern reptile, with much of the skin being bare, and some scutes and horns dispersed on the body. The folds and textures on the skin are extremely well done.<br /><br />The wings are constructed like an extra set of arms, and you can see all the associated muscles in them. They are pretty much like bat wings, but instead of a thumb digit, the dragon has a horn coming out of the wing. Each of the other wing digits ends in a horn.<br /><br />The saddle and harness is great, it looks natural on him and doesn't stick out too much. Sometimes I wonder what he'd look like without it, but it looks great.<br /><br />The colors and paint are flawless, they even went to the trouble to make the insides of his nostrils glossy to make them look wet. I think it would have been cool if they also used glossy paint on his eyes. Like any painted figure, you have to take care to make sure it won't wear or chip off. He's extremely solid and durable in every other sense, but rough play would take a toll on the paint job.<br /><br />The kid that goes in the saddle (he's the one named \\"Shansy\\") is removable and doesn't have any ugly pins or holes on him, his legs just fit onto the saddle and hold him in place. His clothes are Russian/Eastern Europe inspired, and all the paint is put on perfectly. He can move his arms somewhat. The spyglass goes up to his eye. The spyglass and the sword aren't removable.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo1Y2CI7JN82Z33]]This quick and easy book is a must read for writers wanting to upload to Kindle. Learn how to format MS Word from the first page to the last and have it look good on any device, whether a basic Kindle, the Fire or the Kindle for PC app. You'll also learn how to use the Previewer to check its appearance and make changes if necessary.

B00785P2QC|3.0|Virtual City is a great game.  Much like Sim city but not as deep, although you could have great fun with it. Lot of things to unlock and some cool achievements and rewards.  The progression is kindnof slow but if you have the time then that should be a problem.<br /><br />My only real issue with this game is that to do anything significant,  you have to pay and pay a lot. Virtual City uses investment point,  which can be earned through game play,  to build some of the more decorative things in the game. G5 nickel and dimes you to death just to get a lot of the objectives done.  Great game G5,  just wish u didn't need to charge so much to really play this game.o
B007D2XSW0|4.0|well i mean its ok but we could use some more extras and the thought boxes make the words turn with the boxes the words shouldnt move with the box.needs more options.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Awesome show!!! it's a must see for those who would like to know more about Autism....Claire Danes was wonderful in her acting and she was very accurate in the way she portrayed people with autism. My favourite phrase from the movie: \\"I was different but not less!\\"

B001GJ30QU|5.0|This is the dream album, the best of both worlds. It's Motley Crue, which has been my favorite band for as long as I can remember. And it's in vinyl, so it has amazing sound quality. I don't have anything against CD's, you just can't beat the clearness of a record. If you have a record player, or CD player, or if you happen to like sub-par sound quality and still have a cassette player, buy this album. As in stop reading this comment and buy it.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Who doesnt like to fly? This game gives you the chance to fly with some challenging levels.<br />Works great on my Samsung Galaxy skyrocket and tablet. I would def recommend.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like the game a lot and it is enjoyable to play when I am bored but it had way to much lag and glitches. if I do not have wifi it lags horribly. I would like it better if they fixed the issues. :/
B000ICLRIE|5.0|I am not going to write a synopsis about the Kingdom of Heaven movie here because many others have already done so.  What I will say about the director's though is that it puts the theatrical version to shame.  The original release was already a favorite in my collection of movies, but I couldn't help feeling  something was missing.  After seeing the director's cut that feeling was squashed!  There is no way to really describe it, but buy the director's cut and you'll understand!<br /><br />Now as far as blu-ray versus dvd, once again the blu-ray version completely blows the dvd away!  You actually see that there is green grass in the beginning of the movie!  I was amazed that EVERYTHING being so darn blue was due to the film being on dvd and not because of the movie maker's choice.  I do know the bluish haze is supposed to be a movie effect but the dvd is almost completely void of any other color until the characters reach Messina.  The blu-ray technology brings color to an almost colorless (besides the blue of course) world and the details that can be seen in just about everything will not disappoint!<br /><br />A great story as the theatrical version, but an amazing story as it should have been now in the director's version.  A bland blue world on dvd became a world with amazing color and detail complimenting the blue \\"feeling\\" that the movie makers intended on blu-ray!<br /><br />If you could only afford to upgrade one dvd from your collection to blu-ray, The Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut should be the one you choose!  It is worth every penny and then some!!!!!!!
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|I LOVE THIS WHOLE CD/DVDCOMBO!<br />Richard puts on a Fantastic Performence!<br /> Plus all his guests, I Love the Extremely Talented Sara Niemietz on here.

B007JRUA7K|3.0|The movie was just a click away,no waiting time , simple just what the doctor ordered. The movie was interesting, just ok for me.
B0007TKH66|5.0|The first season of Enterprise is better the second time around. Watched it originally on TV and was disappointed.<br />Going back and watching the episodes again was a joy to do. The beginnings of the Federation, and the Temporal Cold War give new light to the Federation's roots. Olde technology, going more by the seat-of-your-pants and more character driven plots is what makes this series different.<br />The characters are more like you and me, with all of their flaws showing. They loose their temper unlike in the New Generation. They are quicker to pull a phaser, like the Original series. The ship is smaller and less advanced showing the Right-Stuff from these newest of Srar Fleet's finest.
B005I6EU48|2.0|I've had my Kindle Fire for 6 months now and purchased the cover with it. I often put in my case with my laptop and bring it to where I work. The edges are beginning to show wear already...not like real leather, rather the color is wearing off and it is beginning to look like cheap imitation leather. For $40 I would have expected a better product. When I wear this one out, I will either seek a real leather cover for it or go with one of the synthetic ones. I think you can tell I'm not too happy with this.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|This is a challenging puzzle style game that kept me entertained for many hours.<br />Works perfectly with my Samsung Galaxy Skyrocket.<br />I would recommend downloading it.
B007VYDFMS|5.0|I'm not a big fan of documentaries, but this has me singing a new tune. I watched this with my ten year old and she was engaged the entire time. The movie provided a great timeline of his music and life.  I plan to watch again before the weekend is over.  Highly recommend this one.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really enjoy this app. Keeps the Bible close by and the reading plans and devotional plans are wonderful.  Downloadable Bible makes it accessible even when there is no Internet access. Love the notes option, bookmarks, search option, and very User friendly.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I had been waiting patiently for this to come out on DVD and it's one of my favorite Disney movies. The movie itself teaches valuable lessons about honesty, loyalty and courage. As for one reviewer who complained about the extras, I loved the extras! The commentary was very informative and I liked the special featuring Dickie Jones, the voice of Pinocchio (all grown up now, of course, but still has a boyish face despite the thinning hair) and Real Life Geppettos. I didn't notice too much over-enhancing but I respect that one reviewer's opinion.<br /><br />Since this was Disney's 2nd film, there was more attention to animation and the songs (\\"When You Wish Upon A Star,\\" which won Best Song in 1940 and the movie also won Best Musical Score) than getting big-ticket celebrities to loan their voices. As a matter of fact, the only names I remembered without looking up was Cliff Edwards, who plays the lovable (and sometimes feisty) Jiminy Cricket and Mel Blanc whose only contribution is a \\"hiccup\\" by Gideon, Foulfellow's sidekick. Jones plays the cute and lovable Pinocchio and German actor Christian Rub plays the doting Geppetto. I also learned Thurl Ravenscroft provided the sounds of Monstro the killer whale.<br /><br />Now about the movie- some of the scenes may get a little creepy for children but they serve to warn them about the consequences for being dishonest or naughty. Geppetto, a talented toymaker, makes Pinocchio and wishes upon a star that his puppet become a real boy. Thanks to the beautiful Blue Fairy (Evelyn Venable), his wish is granted- on the condition his new \\"son\\" learns to be \\"brave, truthful and unselfish.\\" Jiminy Cricket, who's witnessed the miracle, is appointed as conscience (and he asks for a gold badge, which the Blue Fairy doesn't promise!). When Geppetto discovers his wish came true, he's delighted. He gets Pinocchio ready for school, yet his son is conned by Foulfellow \\"Honest John\\" and Gideon. First, they sell him to the volatile and greedy Stromboli (Charles Judels, who later in the movie plays the evil Coachman) who pushes the little puppet \\"into the public eye\\" (so he can make money, of course!). Jiminy almost gives up as conscience figuring \\"What does an actor need with a conscience?\\" Later, the 2 con men get Pinocchio ready for a trip to Pleasure Island, which collects naughty boys and here, Pinocchio meets Lampwick (Frankie Darro). I'll stop here so as not to ruin too many surprises.<br /><br />All in all, a great story and a great movie. One reason I was glad the extras were included on the DVD is because I got it before I got my own Blu-Ray.
B0086700CM|4.0|This a very fun and challenging game. Works great with my Samsung Galaxy Skyrocket.<br />My only complaint is that it needs more variety in advancing through levels.<br />I would definitely recommend.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Wow. What the hell was i thinking? A lot of my girlfriends are into this book so i thought I would give it a read. I wish I could be refunded seeing how I didn't even make it past the 12th chapter. Women that are truly hard over this book need to be contained and told about legit porn! I just want to never be reminded about this book again. The way the author writes is painful to me-and any book that refers to a woman's vagina as \\"my sex\\" needs to be shelved.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|It won't even load a photo from Gallery - just goes back to the home page and tells me to choose an image. Very disappointed.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved this book and the whole trilogy....it says a lot about love and relationships! The way we experience life lays the framework for how we live life...we can either change our perspective or live it the way it was modeled.  Change is always good.

B008CPZNL6|5.0|I love Flipboard on my iPhone and was disappointed it wasn't available for my Kindle Fire. I'd even been searching for how to sideload it. Was thrilled to see it in the Kindle app store today.<br />Read a review about it hanging on some news stories but thought, &quot;Bah, that'll never happen to me!&quot; Well it did and I learned how to shut down and restart a totally non-responding Fire. (Did you know the Fire's instructions don't have a troubleshooting page? Page 5...&quot;If your device becomes unresponsive during use, you can shut it down by pressing and holding the power button for 20 seconds. You can then press the power button to restart it.&quot;)<br />That slight panic inducing glitch was easily rectified (after reading the f'ing manual) and I haven't had a problem since. I love this app and am so pleased to have it on my Kindle.
B003YBNRHU|5.0|Watch for their World Gone Crazy performance on HDNET - Looks and sounds like the DBs of old, loved GREAT new song, \\"Chateau\\"!  Made me think I was at Red Rocks Ampitheatre in Denver in mid 70s!  I'm definitely buying the DVD after watching the televised performance.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Sucked!<br />Do not wast your time! Unrealistic  charictures and story line! The person that wrote this book is so not a good wrighter. Could not even read the rest of the book.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|the only way to type on a cell phone, especially if you aren't a text master. works great, usually guesses words quickly and accurately. Love it!
0345803485|5.0|And CERTAINLY NOT written by a teenager!  Perhaps a very well versed and well read one.  Clearly this is a hate it or love it book.  The subject is a bit taboo so depends on how open you are to different preferences people have.  Just lighten up and go with the flow its only a BOOK!  If you don't like the BDSM subject then don't read it.  Enough said.  Enjoy!

B007P6VLR8|1.0|I give the actual music 4 stars. However, on the vinyl version, the last track(s) on each side are extremely distorted. This isn't just the typically snaps and pops, but actual signal distortion from the mastering and isn't found on the CD or Digital versions. This isn't just on the loud tracks either: side 2 ends with the song Pinwheels, which is a more subdued song without any loud guitars or Pumpkin fuzz. The song starts to distort into a fuzzy mess.<br /><br />Pick up the CD or digital copy. This format is busted.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|first of all u cant take pictures on the kindle fire and there is not a lot of edit things on the app.don't get this app not for kindle fire
1400069289|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It validates what many of us already knew...that is habits are especially powerful.  What may not have been so obvious is how prevalent habits are for most of us---and how our habits can dominate our lives. Those who are looking for a 'how-to' book on changing habits will be disappointed, because this book isn't focused on that.  Rather, the book does a great job of sharing insightful stories that illustrate the 'nuts-and-bolts' behind our own habits and habits others desire us to develop (think: marketers). The book's premise is solid and the content well executed. The author is right--habits are indeed powerful.  The key is to develop healthy habits in the first place or modify the ones that aren't working. Four thumbs up!<br /><br />Bill Wiersma, Author--The Power of Professionalism

B007TNS6JI|1.0|This game is nothing like Dungeon Hunter 2, in that it makes no real references or story continuation to it. First of all, DH2 was DUNGEONS. This game is arena-based combat defense. Rather than fighting your way to a goal for any sort of story or purpose, you are simply defending different areas from the monotonous stream of enemies which constantly pour into  -name of place here-. Aside from being completely unrelated to DH2, it almost requires the spending of money to buy things in game, and it does so very early in the game. Without spending money, the game is incredibly difficult, boring, and tedious. Also, the download was considerably larger than it reads in the description. Don't waste your time and memory space downloading this game unless you are new to the DH series and/or enjoy this sort of gameplay. The only positive thing about the game is that the download is free, and the graphics are great.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I had never seen The Phantom of the Opera before. Then, on PBS, this version was on. I decided to sit down to watch it. I FELL IN LOVE! The plot is gripping, the characters are engaging, and the music is beautiful!<br /><br />Sierra is wonderful as Christine! Her voice is perfect and her acting is superb! Christine has flaws, but isn't weak. She's entranced by the Phantom, but fears him at the same time. Her interaction with Raoul and the Phantom are simply wonderful.<br /><br />Of course, Ramin Karimloo as the Phantom is by far the best part of this! When I first heard him sing: \\"Brava, brava, bravissimo.\\", I literally melted. When he sings \\"Music of the Night\\", you will never be able to call another song truly beautiful. His voice is the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. Best of all, he puts everything into the character, successfully making the Phantom three figures at once: a frightening madman, a scared puppy, and a darkly beautiful angel of music.<br /><br />At the end, we get to hear Sarah Brightman sing with four past Phantoms. Then, Ramin returns to sing \\"Music of the Night\\" with those Phantoms. The only downside is that, since Crawford had just finished a tour, he wasn't one of the five Phantoms. I guess I'll have to satisfy myself by hearing him on my London soundtrack...<br /><br />You will laugh, you will cry, and you will be utterly captured by this wonderful version of The Phantom of the Opera.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I have been playing this on my Kindle Fire and I can't put it down! The only down side is that some things require you to have friends that also play. I only have 1 friend playing this and I haven't had any problems yet. Love it!

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Fifty Shades of Grey is basically porn with no redeeming value.  So if porn is your thing, then you will like this book.  The character development in this book reads like a high school novel and the story line is lame and completely unbelievable.  I wanted to stop wasting my time about a quarter of the way through but was reading it for a book club, so I pushed on just so I could see if it ended with any redeeming value.  It doesn't.  Ana is supposed to be this intelligent journalistic type, but she comes across like she's 15 and can only bite her lip or say \\"Holy Shit\\".  And Christian??!! Billionaire before he's 30?  Drop dead gorgeous, accomplished concert pianist, pilot, fluent in several languages...  really!!??  This is a harlequin novel at its best - but the writing is even worse.  After reading this, I am ashamed that our society has gotten so morally corrupt and intellectually void that they deem this as true literature and has made this book - and the sequels - best Sellers.  I feel this author is also further denigrating our morals and standards and setting women's rights back a few decades.  Ana gets physically abused and emotionally manipulated, but she puts up with it because she \\"loves\\" him and feels that if she doesn't do what Christian wants, she will loose him.  This is the kind of irresponsible writing that will illustrate to young girls that its OK to put up with abuse in order to keep your man. Because \\"sex sells\\",  this author is a millionaire.  She doesn't deserve it.

B0069JBKHI|2.0|My husband and I decided to go with this monitor since 1) all of our electronics are apple products.  2) We LOVED the idea of multiple monitors (2 iPhones and an iPad) without ANOTHER gadget to keep up with, especially since we always have our phones with us.  This was probably the deciding factor.  We set up the monitor when it arrived (prior to baby's arrival) and were so excited to use it.  A few other pluses we liked about the monitor:<br />-Ability to start music from iPhone/iPad<br />-Ability to talk to baby<br />-Temperature and Humidity information<br /><br />Unfortunately, when we started using the monitor in real life situations once our baby arrived home we found it less than acceptable.  We are returning the monitor for the following reasons:<br /> - main reason - it looses connection with the internet all the time and often says it can not reconnect<br /> - Range for bluetooth connection is not strong enough for our home, or to take monitors outside on back porch<br /> - Horrible feedback (very shrill) from the listening/audio monitoring<br /><br />For the price, this monitor should work like a DREAM! Extremely disappointed it didn't work, we were so hoping that it would.

B004T4LUPW|4.0|kindle fire.  Syncs  with google calendar.  App works great especially with latest update.  more features and functionality. Highly customizable.  syncs also with task pro app...which is easier for me visually for adding and tracking tasks.  Cons: extensive customization menus can be overwhelming.  print on the kindle screen is too small in some views to be useful.<br />I do recommend this app if you need a powerful scheduling and task tool for little cost.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|really? this is the lamest  most juvenile  chick book i have ever read  sex scenes ridiculous  writing boring and for idiots  was embarrassed for author  such stupid c<br />dialogue  descriptions of people  stopped reading after less than quarter of book  i heard two women at grocery store giggling about how dirty it is  they were late 50s or so  guess they didnt have much experience w  sex or written sex  ugh
B0083GPDBO|1.0|I went into this movie with high expectations, which was my biggest mistake. It had potential to be better, but in the end it was a waste of time.
B005JJCMSU|5.0|Nicolas Cage stars as Kyle Miller, a rich successful diamond dealer with a home safe bigger than my bank's. He doesn't have time for his family. Nicole Kidman plays his wife Sarah who struggles to keep the family together. Liana Liberato is their daughter Avery, who is at that difficult rebellious teen stage. She is not allowed to see Kendra (Emily Meade) who is a bad influence on her.<br /><br />Once the characters are quickly established the movie turns into a home break-in film. Avery is not at home because she disobeyed her parents to go to a party with Kendra...a party that has the forbidden older boys!<br /><br />While Kyle and his wife are being bullied and threatened, Kyle is attempting to figure out who these people are from indirect clues they give him. Cage manages to cause disharmony among the thieves. There are flashbacks as Kyle and Kidman think they know who these people are. As it turns out they both have their dirty little secrets. Excellent job by the actors. Fairly decent script for a home break-in which is normally a \\"B\\" movie. Good script with multiple twists and they weave seeming useless things from the beginning into the mesh. One of the better home break-in films. If you liked this one try the new version of \\"Mother's Day.\\"<br /><br />One of the thieves, Jordana Spiro, for some reason feels she must look around upstairs in her bra and panties. Thanks.<br /><br />F-bomb. No sex. No nudity.

B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I've always been a fan of Fiona, ever since Tidal and When The Pawn..., both of which I consider to be as great as anything any artist ever did in the 1990s if not better. 2005 saw her return with Extraodinary Machine which was equally amazing as her first two efforts. Now, after 7 years she returns with The Idler Wheel..., which may be her most challenging and interesting record yet. Maybe this will sound pretentious but listening this record made me think of throwing paint on a canvas and experimenting with it. You get a sense that Fiona is creating an abstract work of art and not relying on heavy production value to do so. It never feels self indulgent but still taking a lot of risks, this record may not be for everyone but if it's for you then it really will effect you. Always powerful both musically, lyrically and even vocally, this record is amazing!! She has grown from the grammy winning singer/ songwriter that we knew her as from the 90s.<br /><br />Fiona Apple is a name you can trust in popular music.
0307730697|5.0|This is the second book I read and reviewed this month, but the two are totally different.<br /><br />The first part of the book is about Adam's years before becoming a SEAL. The book pulls no punches and doesn't gloss over his failures and drug addictions. It shows what a great guy and SEAL he was, yet also shows how the greatest men can have a weakness and struggle.<br /><br />This is a very inspiring story. In part, because of Adam's perseverance to be a Christian and get victory over his drug addictions, but also because of the things he went through to become and stay a SEAL.<br /><br />This book went into more detail than the other I reviewed about their activities in battle and out in the field, and it helped me gain a better appreciation and thankfulness for what our military do and go through to fight for our freedoms. The book had its sad moments, but overall it is a great story of a great military hero.<br /><br />I was disappointed in the language in the book. Yes, men curse in the military, but Waterbrook is a Christian publisher and should not have allowed the language that appears in the book. I counted multiple uses of 4 curse words, and two other words that just don't belong in a Christian book (the vulgar words for urinate and illegitimate children). Also, they used an abbreviated version of the \\"f\\" word ending in ing and only removed the \\"u\\" and \\"c\\", replacing it with a dash. That is way too close to using the actual word, and they do that at least 5 times.<br /><br />If you're willing to overlook the cursing, then this is a book I'd recommend. It tells the story of a great military hero and also of how God changed and used him.
B004LROMQG|3.0|As I mentioned in a review of Starz Camelot series, I've been an Arthur fan since my teen years.  Now on S3, I yearn to enjoy the Merlin series more than I do.  To me, it just seems like a kids' version of the Arthurian legends, with all the hokey faux Old English incantations, CGI monsters, unrealistic scenery, and teenagers playing the important roles.  Several characters in S1, ep 1, had so much heavy & fake makeup on that I almost threw in the towel right then!  Having Merlin himself be a young servant rather than a bearded wizard and Arthur a self-involved youth with a boorish streak is an original concept--but it amused me that they still felt they had to throw in an old geezer (Gaius) to take the place of the elderly sage that the Merlin character usually fills!  With Guinevere also being a servant in this version, that's two key characters they've \\"demoted.\\"  One thing that really bugs me is the way they've plucked names of significant characters from the legends and applied them randomly--sometimes to characters that get killed off in the course of one scene this series--just to get the names in there, I guess.  As for Morgana, Katie McGrath does a decent job with her descent into wickedness until you compare her with Eva Green in Camelot, and, well, there IS no comparison, although, as with the latter series, she is largely the most interesting character.<br /><br />Uther Pendragon is more involved in his children's lives than in most versions, and I do like the dynamic and the actor who portrays him.  As far as the eps themselves go, I definitely prefer the serious ones over the \\"comical\\" ones.  The one called \\"Changeling\\" was embarrassing even to watch!  I don't quite \\"get\\" the relationship between Merlin and the dragon, or why Merlin let him loose in S2 to wreak havoc on the country.  Maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention.<br /><br />I know this series is wildly popular and has a huge fandom, and that there will be plenty of people who disagree with me, which is fine.  I just wish it was more what I wanted!  As it is, it just doesn't seem fair in the scheme of things that Starz Camelot folded after one season and this one is approaching its fifth!  As it goes on, I find my attention wandering more and more as I watch.  But the great thing about the Arthur legends is that they CAN live in so many forms and variations; I'm likely to keep watching as I do find the series mildly entertaining and I love everything Arthur (except the movie:  \\"Excalibur\\"!), so, \\"Merlin,\\"carry on!
B004D7GU3C|4.0|I had already downloaded the video for \\"The Best Thing About Me is You\\" (which is exceptional) so I decided to go for the spanish version of the CD. I really enjoy listening to it in the car.....the strange thing is I'm an R&B/soul boy but seem to like the latin twist on here. Can't understand a word but sing along frantically in a phonetic way! Sad but true!
B008D37J6O|5.0|works great, if you have any high quality music files that will not play on your phone and or tablet of any kind you must downloadbthis app, it's awesome<br />.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Given our societal Crisis of Confidence, where authority is suspect and free will under thought control. it is timely that Rush returns with their intricate, rich ode to individualism and personal fulfilment. That they do this with the creative intensity sorely lacking in modern pop music makes the album all that much more distinct from its contemporaries.<br /><br />As a concept album, Clockwork Angels keeps true to its theme - a lone traveler looking for meaning in a mechanistic world, a fool against the elites. The individual songs provide fragmentary glimpses into his journey and encounters with diverse characters, each a metaphor for the things that matter and that allow us to define our identity as distinct from the whole.<br /><br />There is a great deal of depth in the album - musically it proves that rock can still be born anew and poses a challenge to the rest. Some songs feel a bit too layered, requiring repeat listening to peel away the dross to pick out the gems within.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I have to say that I read this book a few weeks ago and I always come back to read the review and see any updates, because this book is out of this world. Teenage romance? heck no! this is deeper than that. It dark, thrilling, real, and addictive.<br /><br />First I noticed the 999 review status and I said to myself let's make it 1000, because the book deserves it. The author is great. I put her book next to Stephanie Meyer's \\"The Host\\". She captivates the mind and the heart and more than once you will experience heart palpitations.<br /><br />This book has become my standard of comparison. I always come back here to find similiar books, but I never do. Still searching and it literally has become a beautiful disaster.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|its grand and i liked it. i completely recommend this adobe reader. thanks for ready my review. deuces my little people.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I think I was very lucky to find this book just after two months of starting to workout. I must admit that before reading this book I didn't have the foggiest idea of how important nutrition was, how muscle building actually worked, or that supplementing was actually a good thing.<br />One of the things I like the most about this book is that it's based on success principles, like: setting goals, keeping track of your progress, visualizing how you would like to look and, of course, discipline. I also enjoyed the terms definition section. Although I had done some search on the web for some terms I never found definitions so easy to understand; I couldn't agree more with the author on the importance of knowing the real meaning of the words (that we usually think we know).<br /><br />I did expected to see some references to studies to corroborate some of the statements but after reading a few myself I can see why it might be hard to do so. It seems each new study contradicts the previous one, and then another proves the first one right. But knowing that Mike supports his statements with his personal experience gives me more confidence.<br /><br />I must admit that I was scared to go heavy at first; for those two months I was following the \\"common routine\\" of higher sets with higher reps so obviously I was using low weight to endure through the workout. I was surprised to realize that I could handle much more weight when doing fewer sets and reps, it took me around three weeks of carefully increasing the weight to find out how much weight I could manage properly. I've been following this book's recommendations for 5 weeks now and although I now it will take some time to see results at least now I feel stronger.<br /><br />Dieting was hard at first, reading labels and planning your meals is quite time consuming but once you have the products and the info you need it gets easier. However I wish there were some suggestions to make it easier to plan your meals, maybe a sample spreadsheet?.<br /><br />Anyway, I am very happy with the book, I'm glad I bought it, and to be honest it's quite cheap for the knowledge I got from it, not to mention the money it saved me on supplementation and time. I also like that the author is so accessible and willing to help.<br /><br />BTW, I also got the book \\"Muscle Myths: 50 Health & Fitness Mistakes You Don't Know You're Making\\" and although I think it contains quite a few from \\"bigger, leaner, stronger\\" I still think that both books represent an invaluable source of information for people that are just getting started into bodybuilding and don't know anything about it, like ME!

B0083GPXSW|5.0|One of my favorite shows of all time and it was a great finale.  More importantly, I forgot to DVR the last episode.  The following evening it was not on Comcast On Demand nor on Fox.com. However, I was able to buy it off of Amazon Prime Instant Video.  I am now a Prime Member for life!
030758836X|2.0|The idea behind this story is brilliant.  Unfortunately, the author did not do a good job of convincing us that it could have actually happened.  I was pulled in from the first page.  But once the plot twist was revealed, I quickly lost interest.  It seemed as if she was trying to fit the characters into the idea, rather than making them a true part of the story.  It just never quite reached the point of credibility.<br /><br />By the time I finished, I was more annoyed than entertained.  Nice try, but no cigar.
B00785P2QC|3.0|this app is ok.  it is a pretty good game and you actually get to play without irritating yourfriends with all the facebook updates.  and don't need your friends to have fun.

0439023483|1.0|It looks to me like the author just watched the movie Battle Royale and liked it, so she copied the plot in amazing detail and published it.  She only got away with it because Battle Royale is a foreign film and the general public didn't realize the plagiary. She barely changed the story at all.  She is taking credit for someone else's work.  I also believe it is a tad to violent for the elementary and middle school children that are reading it.

B0059WTMLW|1.0|this app is way to easy on easy, solving puzzles in under two minutes and can be impossible on moderate. no explanation on all the game types how to play, and the biggest gripe, when you solve it you can't see the solved puzzle. there has to be a better game out there.
B0088RQ4X4|4.0|I was really turned off by the marketing of this movie. I knew nothing about the Burroughs stories. I just had no desire to see a Tarzan-esque guy running around fighting martians. I didn't know he was from late 19th century Earth. For whatever reason that made the whole thing better. Was this a phenomenal movie? No. It was a better movie than any of the Transformers movies.  I sincerely hope that DVD sales are strong with this and Disney decides to make a sequel. I rarely want to see the next chapter in movies any more. Case in point, The Avengers. I liked it but I didn't care about any of the characters. I don't need to see another Avengers movie. I will, but I don't need to. I ended up liking John Carter as a character. I didn't even hate that CGI dog thing! I want a little more.

B003EYVXSW|3.0|----------------------------------------<br />Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />**Brief Review**<br /><br />I am a huge fan of science.  Saying that I do feel that there are things that should be left alone.  We are just not advanced enough to know the ramifications of all our actions.  As we are still children we should for the time being leave certain things alone.  Amoung these are messing with things that nature has already painstakingly engineered for us.<br /><br />'Splice' is a classic tale of scientists going too far.<br /><br />**Movie Details/Some Spoilers Ahead**<br /><br />The movie centers around two genetic engineers, played by Adrien Brody and Sarah Polley.  They make designer animals.  Animals spliced together from plants, mammals, fish, etc.  They produce species never seen on this planet.  Why are they doing this?  The movie is kind of vague on this, (at least to me), something about harvesting unique proteins or something...<br /><br />Well, Sarah Polley's character is not content just making weird animals and has a strong desire to make a human/animal hybrid.  Brody is apprehensive at first, but after some sensual coaxing by Polley he relents.  By the way, it's illegal to do this.<br /><br />Things are BAD from the start.  The fetus matures in the artificial womb way too fast.  Upon it's violent birth it nearly kills Sarah Polley.  This creature has a wicked stinger that delivers a powerful poison.  Personally I think that would have been a fine time to throw this thing into the furnace, but they keep it alive for some reason.  It matures fast and keeps changing in appearance, becoming more and more human \\"looking\\" each day, but still a monster none-the-less.<br /><br />This creature dubbed \\"Dren\\" is quite a fascinating creature.  She has wings, can breath under water, and has a long prehensile tail barbed with a powerful toxin delivering stinger.  She's a predator to say the least...<br /><br />Long story short, the 2 doctors have to sneak her out to an abandoned farm house and try in desperation to contain her there.  Of course things never go as planned...<br /><br />--Summing Up--<br /><br />Premise wise this movie is quite good.  The special effects are top notch.  Dren looks quite real.  Dren while a monster, is nothing in comparison to what the doctors are capible of.  In the end you can't really hate Dren, she didn't ask to be made, and she's just being what she is.  The acting and dialogue are not the best.  Brody says f@#k way too many times and without any need.  I don't mind swearing, (and do it quite a bit myself...), but I like it to at least have some purpose behind it.  Don't have an intelligent doctor in a lab swearing like a sailor for no reason.  Polley, while a good actress, doesn't really shine in this feature.  The film also suffers from spells of boringness.<br /><br />Shoud you buy this?  I did...used for 4.99.  I would not recommend paying a fortune for this, as this is a one time view, maybe twice.  You will not find yourself yourning to re-watch this.  It was on HBO, it will no doubt re-show on there again.  This is a Sci-Fi movie to say the least, with some horror elements thrown in, not for everyone.  Definitely not a date movie...<br /><br />Well, that's my thoughts.  As always sorry for any spelling/grammer mistakes.  I went to public school...reature dubbed \\"Dren\\" is quite a fascinating creature.  She has wings, can breath under water, and has a long prehensile tail barbed with a powerful toxin delivering stinger.  She's a predator to say the least...<br /><br />Long story short, the 2 doctors have to sneak her out to an abandoned farm house and try in desperation to contain her there.  Of course things never go as planned...<br /><br />--Summing Up--<br /><br />Premise wise this movie is quite good.  The special effects are top notch.  Dren looks quite real.  Dren while a monster, is nothing in comparison to what the doctors are capible of.  In the end you can't really hate Dren, she didn't ask to be made, and she's just being what she is.  The acting and dialogue are not the best.  Brody says f@#k way too many times and without any need.  I don't mind swearing, (and do it quite a bit myself...), but I like it to at least have some purpose behind it.  Don't have an intelligent doctor in a lab swearing like a sailor for no reason.  Polley, while a good actress, doesn't really shine in this feature.  The film also suffers from spells of boringness.<br /><br />Shoud you buy this?  I did...used for 4.99.  I would not recommend paying a fortune for this, as this is a one time view, maybe twice.  You will not find yourself yourning to re-watch this.  It was on HBO, it will no doubt re-show on there again.  This is a Sci-Fi movie to say the least, with some horror elements thrown in, not for everyone.  Definitely not a date movie...<br /><br />Well, that's my thoughts.  As always sorry for any spelling/grammer mistakes.  I went to public school...
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I'm a photo junky so I've always got my eye out for photo editing apps like this. I am a big fan of PicSayPro which has many of the same features as this but it still has it's own unique tools with a good degree of customization available as apposed to just stock filters. Still exploring the whole app but it's definitely worth picking up if it's compatible with your device. You just need to know which editing app (or multiple) to use when you want a certain look since I've yet to find one app with all the features I want.

B001TODCII|5.0|----------------------------------------<br />Public service announcement before I begin review.  Toonami is back!!!  Airs on Saturday Midnight, well technically Sunday, from 12:00 a.m. to 3:00 a.m., with an encore beginning at 3:00 a.m. to 6:00 a.m.  Tune in and support it.  Now on to my review.<br />----------------------------------------<br /><br />**Brief Review**<br /><br />I have loved watching Liam Neeson for some years now.  The man just makes great movies.  Hell, even 'Darkman' is pretty decent.  But he really SHINES in this feature.<br /><br />**Movie Details/Some Spoilers Ahead**<br /><br />The film centers around ex-CIA agent Bryan Mills (Liam Neeson).  A divorced man trying desperately to form a closer relationship with his daughter.  He ex-wife Lenore (Famke Janssen) has long remarried, to a filthy rich man, and is not that worried about Neeson getting close to his daughter.<br /><br />Well summer comes and Neeson's daughter desperately wants to go to Paris, to \\"study\\", yeah right...  Neeson must sign a parental consent form for her to leave the country unattended by an adult.  After much goading from Lenore and his daughter he relents.  He soon discovers though that she is actually going to Paris with her friend to follow the band U2 (or maybe it was Blink 182) around Europe.  He is furious about being deceived.<br /><br />Neeson has been around to say the least and knows how dangerous the world actually is.  Well, his daughter is no more than 10 minutes off the plane in Paris when she and her friend are \\"marked\\" by some flesh peddlers.  These monsters steal women, and auction them off into sexual slavery.  Sad to say this is REAL, and something that the international police forces are trying to desperately combat.<br /><br />As you probably have seen on the movie's trailer, Neeson is on the phone with his daughter when she is kidnapped.  And as you've seen off the commercials \\"he has a particular set of skills...\\".  He's a badass to say the least.<br /><br />In no time at all Liam's on a plane to Paris ready to kill anyone who is between him and his daughter...<br /><br />--Summing Up--<br /><br />This film is HIGH on the action scale.  It is a tad slow for like the first 15 minutes, but after that never stops.  Plus the acting is superb.  Forget 'Ransom' with Mel Gibson, 'Taken' is the film to see.<br /><br />There are very few people who have not seen this movie.  But if you are amoung the few who missed it, definitely check this out.<br /><br />Is this worth buying.  ABSOLUTELY YES!!!  This is a re-watch times 10.  I have personally watched it apx 3 times, and will no doubt watch it again soon.  In fact just typing this review I am getting the urge to get my copy out and pop it into my aging DVD player.<br /><br />Well, that's my 3 cents worth on this movie.  Wait, holy crap there's someone in my house, help me Liam!!!r /><br />In no time at all Liam's on a plane to Paris ready to kill anyone who is between him and his daughter...<br /><br />--Summing Up--<br /><br />This film is HIGH on the action scale.

B00772M1F6|4.0|Heard a review of this album on NPR along with an interview of J.D.McPherson. Liked the sample I heard so I bought it and was really glad I did.  True and real rock and roll that makes you want to crank down the windows blast the box and sing real loud.  If you like artists like Chuck Berry, BB King, Jerry Lee Lewis and the King then you are gonna want this one.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Game well thought out and executed. Graphics stand up to many other andriod games. vlVery addictive,  I check this game daily for the bonus and play regularly. Lilith has been the only gamenI like enough to actually invest in,  with gameplay easy enough for newbies,  and fun enough for the pros... The free version is deffinately worth playing through.
0143038419|1.0|I was hoping this would be a rich journey of a woman finding herself in the larger context of the world vs the rather narrow confines of \\"woman's role\\" in America. I couldn't read far into the book before giving up. The author seems prone to emotional excess which even she can't explain.  Clingy with her new love after her divorce, she whipsaws between ecstatic closeness and what amounts to clinical depression on an almost day-to-day basis. Some chemical problem she was born with that causes her misery? In her place, I would just have had fun for as long as it lasted.  Then moved on to the next phase--and perhaps man--in her life. This strikes me as a woman who isn't very grounded, but seeks outside support of various stripes in the hope she will finally feel okay.  Sadly, I quickly just didn't care whether she felt okay or not.  I'm sure she is talented enough in putting sentences together, but I didn't feel the book had any substance. Many apparently loved the book--no idea why.
030758836X|3.0|I am giving \\"Gone Girl\\" 3 stars, but only begrudgingly. In my mind, any book that takes me 3 months and 20 different tries to read is not worth 3 stars, especially a book written by an author I already respect. And I am not kidding, for me the first half of \\"Gone Girl\\" was a PURE TORTURE to read.<br /><br />Amy Dunn disappears on the day of her 5th wedding anniversary. All gradually uncovered evidence suggests that her husband, Nick, is somehow involved. Did he kill her? Was she kidnapped? What happened to Amy? One thing is clear, Nick and Amy's marriage wasn't as perfect as everybody thought.<br /><br />The first part of the novel is all about the investigation into Amy's disappearance, slow unraveling of Nick's dirty secrets, reminiscing about the troubled history of Nick and Amy's marriage as told in Amy's hidden diary. I strained and strained my brain trying to understand why this chunk of Gone Girl had no appeal to me whatsoever. The only answer I have is this: I am really not into reading about rich white people's problems. You want to whine to me about your dwindling trust fund? Losing your cushy New York job? Moving south and \\"only\\" renting a mansion there? Being unhappy because you have too much free time on your hands and you are used to only work as a hobby? You want to make fun of your lowly, un-posh neighbors and their casseroles? Well, I am not interested. I'd rather read about someone not necessarily likable, but at least worthy of my empathy, not waste my time on self-centered, spoiled, pathetic people who don't know what real problems are. Granted, characters in Flynn's previous novels (\\"Sharp Objects\\" and \\"Dark Places\\") are pretty pathetic and and at times revolting too, but I always felt some strange empathy towards them, not annoyance and boredom, like I felt reading about Amy and Nick's marriage voes.<br /><br />But then second part, with its wicked twist, changed everything. The story became much more exciting, dangerous and deranged. The main characters revealed sides to them that were quite shocking and VERY entertaining. I thought the Gillian Flynn I knew before finally unleashed her talent for writing utterly unlikable and crafty women. THEN I got invested in the story, THEN I cared.<br /><br />Was it too little too late though? I think it was. Something needed to be done to make \\"Gone Girl\\" a better read. Make it shorter? Cut out first part completely? I don't know. But because of my uneven experience with this novel I won't be able to recommend \\"Gone Girl\\" as readily as I did Flynn's earlier novels, even though I think this horror marriage story (it's not a true mystery, IMO) has some brilliantly written psycho goodness in it and an absolutely messed up ending that many loathed but I LOVED. I wish it didn't take so much time and patience to get to all of that...characters revealed sides to them that were quite shocking and VERY entertaining.

0345803507|1.0|Like so many others I wanted to know what all the fuss was about so I downloaded the sample of the first book...and wanted to slit my wrists. All of the 1 star reviews I have subsequently read were right on target. Its repetetive. Four word sentences are the norm. Its so unrealistic it borders on the ludicrous and absurd.<br /><br />The scariest part about this is that it wasn't self published, but a publishing company (i.e. an entire building full of people!) had the chance to stop this devastation from occuring, but instead decided it would be a great idea to promote one of the worst stories ever written!<br /><br />Even more alarming is the scores of women who are touting it as the best book(s) they have ever read and are waiting for their own personal Christian to arrive, sweep them off their feet and onto their backs, where they will be both verbally and physically abused, tied up and ordered around like a slave, but all in the name of love, so its labelled as a romance. Oh, and he buys her stuff, all sorts of ridiculously expensive items, so I guess that helps with the justification for all the degradation and subjugation the heroine (surely the most lackluster woman to ever fill the role) endures.<br /><br />What has happened to the world? I really hope this sad excuse for a \\"love story\\" (a.k.a. a riveting saga of the joys of domestic abuse) doesn't set the women's lib movement on its ear. History is rife with actual heroic women, real Amazons, that fought and suffered to give women equality and choices, but E. L. James seems determined to right that wrong. She has succeeded admirably with her handbook on how-to catapult women back into the dark ages, putting them in their place, kneeling before their husband/boyfriend and licking their boots on command.<br /><br />Thank you. It's good to finally know where I belong.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Interesting, emotional, sexual, psychological and a need to read on!  A different way of viewing love because of emotional and psychological problems. The author captures all elements of this emotional roller coaster.
B007SGM084|3.0|The book was good but needed more action, besides sexual that is.  It kind of got redundant and predictable. I am glad I read it but it's  not one I really feel like I want to keep In the library.

B007D2XSW0|4.0|Does the developer just not care about keeping the amazon store version updated? As I type this that's version is 4 releases behind the google play store version (2.04 there, 2.0 here). Why would anybody buy it here if they're going to be 4 versions behind all the time at minimum? To me, it screams with that the developer just doesn't really care about support after they get their sale. I downloaded it here for 2 reasons, 1 it is the free app of the day and 2 amazon has this thing now it seems where they will let you erite reviews but won't post them unless you bought whatever it is from amazon. In othet words, Amazon will let you type of the review all day long it just will never actually be posted. They don't tell you they're doing this and if you don't believe me, then try it--try reviewing something you didn't buy here. Amazon will accept it but it will probably never show up online.

B007BRSNQS|4.0|This is my review of the 2012 Sony Japan CD edition of my favorite Byrds album, The Notorious Byrd Brothers.<br /><br />It is also, by extension, a cursory glance at four other original Byrds albums (Mr. Tambourine Man, Turn! Turn! Turn!, Fifth Dimension, and Younger Than Yesterday) and a special two-disc comp titled Original Singles: A's & B's 1965-1971 that Sony Japan has also issued this year.  At the very least I plan to post a review of Turn! Turn! Turn! and the compilation at a later date; I have ordered both.  I may end up getting all of them.<br /><br />The five original albums use Blu-Spec technology in the manufacturing process.  According to some product descriptions on the Internet, all six titles are presented in the DSD audio format.  All are playable on a standard CD player such as mine.  I'm guessing these Sony Japan editions are geared toward (1) audiophiles with high-end sound systems, (2) Byrds completists, and/or (3) the curious.  I clearly fall into the last camp -- although for many years I ran with the second group (owning prerecorded open reels of Notorious and \\"Sweetheart,\\" obscure TV appearances preserved on VHS tape, import vinyl records, etc.).<br /><br />I carefully and repeatedly A/B'd this new edition of Notorious with the 1997 Sony remaster bolstered by the six bonus tracks.  On separate occasions over the course of a week I listened to specific passages, whole songs, and the entire two editions of Notorious through my headphones or through my four speakers (my preference).  To my ears, there's no appreciable difference between the two CDs.  The beauty of (and nuances in) Chris, David, and Roger's vocals and the clarity of the instrumentation (from Chris's bass and mandolin to Roger's Ric 12-string to the drums, whether played by Michael or by Jim Gordon or Hal Blaine) are on display in both editions.  The sound effects on \\"Draft Morning\\" are powerful in both editions.  The door slamming shut at the start of \\"Get To You\\" is still abrupt -- in both editions.  There simply was no \\"A-ha!\\" moment when I felt certain one edition outdid the other.  The 1997 Notorious and the 2012 Notorious provide a mesmerizing yet virtually identical audio experience -- on my system.  Listening to this new 2012 edition on your system, especially if it's audiophile quality, might elicit an entirely different reaction in you.  I just don't know.  Either way, I would respect your findings, observations, and opinions.<br /><br />Yet, beyond my subjective audio comparison, there are notable dissimilarities between the 1997 and 2012 CD editions:<br /><br />1997 Notorious:  has just the stereo mix; I had only it to A/B with the 2012 edition's stereo mix; that's because the . . .<br />2012 Notorious:  has the stereo mix of the album AND its corresponding mono mix (which actually leads off the disc)<br /><br />1997 Notorious:  6 bonus tracks in stereo (plus the unlisted radio spot and the \\"studio dust-up\\" appended to track 17)<br />2012 Notorious:  2 bonus tracks (12 and 13 here) in mono (\\"Lady Friend\\" and the single version of \\"Old John Robertson\\")<br /><br />1997 Notorious:  a 12-page booklet with David Fricke's essay, Johnny Rogan's song notes, and some cool photos<br />2012 Notorious:  a 24-page, text-heavy booklet (almost all in Japanese) with track listing and song lyrics in English; alas, there are some errors in the printed lyrics (for example, in \\"Artificial Energy\\":  Do you think it's really the truth/That you seek/I've got my dance/It's happened to me)<br /><br />1997 Notorious:  housed in a standard jewel case with a clear tray through which the original back cover photo shows<br />2012 Notorious:  housed in a beautifully rendered facsimile album jacket about half an inch taller than a standard plastic jewel case; the CD itself mimics a black vinyl record (complete with \\"grooves\\") with a red Sony Music label; it, like the 1997 edition, has the iconic Columbia Records \\"walking eye\\" logo; the disc itself is snugly protected by a U-shaped sleeve<br /><br />According to information I've gleaned elsewhere, all five original Byrds albums in this series boast the same features:  first, the album's mono mix, then the mono bonus tracks (as many as five), and finally, the album's stereo mix; plus a faithfully reproduced album jacket -- front and back.  I would assume each one has its own booklet with the track listings and song lyrics printed in English.<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier, I will eventually post reviews of Turn! Turn! Turn! and the 2-disc compilation of Byrds singles.  I'm getting Turn! Turn! Turn! only because one of its bonus tracks indicates a STEREO version of the title song.  Oh, really?  Is its imaging better/wider than that of the narrow stereo version that's been around for years and which I assume leads off the stereo album mix on the disc?  I'm skeptical.  But if it's true, come to fanboy!  I've been waiting for you!<br /><br />I'm getting the two-disc comp (Original Singles: A's & B's 1965-1971) because 50 of the 52 tracks are in mono.  Not only did many of those '60s singles grace my record collection back in the day, but back then singles were produced and mixed in mono to give them real \\"punch\\" over Top 40 radio stations.  Plus, I want to know if the version of \\"Chestnut Mare\\" on that comp is the infamous radio edit that lacks the ethereal bridge.<br /><br />The music on Notorious is deserving of 5 stars.  I've never wavered on that.  This 4-star rating reflects my take on the 2012 Sony Japan edition's sound (first-rate, but to my ears not an improvement over what I've been listening to for the last 15 years), packaging (nice reproduction of the original vinyl album cover), and contents (the booklet is kind of a mixed bag for non-Japanese-speaking Byrds fans, and while the disc itself has only two mono bonus tracks, it DOES have the entire album in BOTH mono and stereo mixes).  In any case, I hope this review at least answers some basic questions you mayhave had about the 2012 Sony Japan remasters, particularly The Notorious Byrd Brothers.  Thank you for taking the time to read it.

0374105235|5.0|[A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier, ASIN:B001KTVVZS]. This true story captured me almost within the first chapter, and it pulled me along into the tumultuous and horrifying journey of the innocent victims. You will still be thinking about this story years after you've read it and your heart will still remember the sorrowful pain and the hope it felt for the people who lived this day to day battle to survive.
B005LAIH54|4.0|I think Hollywood makes these movies almost on a production line. Rather than take a chance on something original, they repeat the same plot with variations.<br /><br />The filming is very good. The graphics are brilliant. They must have spent a lot of money on making it.<br /><br />The acting is reasonable although I do not think anyone was brilliant.<br /><br />The actual story is better than average for such a movie. The reluctant hero on a quest, with a rogue and a beautiful princess against an evil God that can destroy the universe, quite passable.<br /><br />Overall it makes a better than the average movie.

006197806X|5.0|Lena's so different in this book. She's struggling with the pain of losing Alex, adapting to her new life. She's burying the past, trying to let go. And she does.<br /><br />When Julian Fineman was kidnapped and she got caught too, I didn't know how she was important...but I figured she was going to change his mind about the deliria. How could that not be how it was resolved? They were locked up in a tiny room together, and then made their escape, relying on one another. Of course they'd end up at least friends.<br /><br />I liked the double storyline thing. \\"Then\\" and \\"Now\\" was a really good idea on Oliver's part.<br /><br />But the ending pissed me off...No, it wasn't bad. It was a cliffhanger. The next one won't be out until March next year! How do you expect us to wait that long without going completely bonkers? Couldn't put it down...and then I find this ending. It's quite frustrating. You people who've read it, you know what I mean.<br /><br />So, we come across yet another dreaded love triangle. Really? Just as long as it doesn't turn into a vicious Team Julian/Team Alex battle like Twilight, I think it'll be okay. Personally I haven't picked a side. I don't know enough. Julian's a likeable guy, but so was Alex in Delirium. Now that he's back, I've no clue who to root for. What if he's not the same person? Whatever happenned in prison or whatever might've really changed him...and Lena's changed too. Maybe he doesn't love her anymore. Maybe she'll realize that she doesn't love him anymore. I don't know.<br /><br />So mummy dearest is part of the resistance? I saw that coming. I was thinking about the woman Lena was taken by, how she kept saying her name and didn't want to be revealed...who else could it be?<br /><br />And Thomas Fineman...I'm assuming he's dead. Raven shot him, but then again, we know gunshot wounds don't always take in this dystopian world. I'm not glad so much as in agreement that Oliver was right in killing him off. You grow to hate him once you realize how he treated his children. I mean, Julian's brother, may he rest in peace whatever his name was, died because he was beaten and then neglected. And he was willing to have his son executed because he was \\"sick\\". Ridiculous, Thomas. I realize there's no love in you...but does that have to make you cruel?<br /><br />Great book. Different. Thought provoking, just like the first. Love may the reason for a lot of problems, but really it's one of the most important things ever. Take that away, call it a disease...well, then we're not much more than empty shells, are we? This book helps prove that.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite apps.  I no longer have yo load my handbag with a calculator . Everything is on my kindle right where I need it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|wow. i thought thks was goin to be a bad app because of the terrible reviews but i have a ki dle fire and this ks a great app!!!!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I just installed it and it won't open. It automatically &quot;force close&quot;. I was looking forward to seeing what features it has.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This game is very fun and challenging! Also very addicting! Great for long car rides or to just pass time!
B004L9MFM2|4.0|Although I like the genre, I find that I am quite selective as there seems to be no shortage of these types of books.  I was recommended this series by my son and thus found myself reading 'Game of Thrones'.  I found the setting of the series to be a little bit too raw and brutal compared to most of the books I normally enjoy reading, but I started my reading in the sixties last century.  Things are a bit different these days.  However George Martin presented the story lines well in an easy to read and organised manner.  The reader isn't continually beaten up by ever increasing brutality.  The stages are set, the myriad of characters and links between them are carefully laid out allowing the reader to get to know them as the story line slowly develops. His characters are especially well developed and all different and there are no shortages of them. Its a bit complicated initially but George manages to bring you into the intricate webs that have woven all over the place until you are firmly entangled in them.<br /><br />Book one whetted my appetite for book two which I found quite comfortable to read, especially the way in how the chapters are all set to each individual character.  I have already purchased book three and have wasted no time in getting stuck into it.  In fact I am finding it very difficult to put down.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|While this was a free app and I was able to use all the features but when I went to save to Facebook it said I needed to download an app even though I have Facebook on my phone and then it wouldn't let me do anything else. I tried downloading the suggested Facebook app and it said I wasn't able to do that and then stopped working. I have a DROID RAZR.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I Absolutely Love This App, It Has Every Thing I Want To Edit Pictures, But There Can Be Some More Fonts That Are Crazy Yet Pretty
B007J4T2G8|5.0|OMG!! I just finished reading this book I just loved it!!  Starting reading the second on last night and so far love it just as much as the first one. I hope this author writes more books.
B002361MLA|5.0|This book will help you go a lot of steps ahead in your way to be a conscious and more enlighted person. Its easy to read, and it will make you really think in a lot of habits or progamations we have and are not neccesary or even real.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this application works great with phones that have Android ice cream sandwich installed. using a galaxy nexus and this application works without any problems. so far this is one of the best photo editors I have seen on a phone. it really is worth the 5 bucks.
B008AZWMMG|5.0|This album is going to be awesome.  You should defiantly pick this single up. I have already played it more than 99 cents worth
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome app. lots of fun. crisp graphics &amp; challenging. great way to pass the time &amp; challenge reflexes while also taxing the brain
B007IPJMCM|5.0|I remember buying this CD 20 years ago when it first came out.  It was one of my very first CD's I ever purchased.  It still rocks just as hard as it did then!  This is one of the best metal albums of all time and it was only made better with the addition of the lost track Piss.  Must buy this CD!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Little skeptical because of reviews, but its free so why not? Does everything it says &amp; saves to my gallery without a hitch.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|downloaded this as a faod and love it. have read a lot of bad reviews that it wont load from gallery but ive had no problems. between this app and picsay I have all my editing needs on kindle fire!
B007PBKG5G|5.0|For a debut album boys and girls is fantastic. The potential for this group is tremendous. Brittany's voice is incredible both in range  and feeling.Well worth it. The download to the cloud was great.Can't wait to see how they develop over time.
B004TTMYQG|5.0|Exactly what I've been looking for! its awesome being able to see everything on my agenda without having to open any programs and with so many different widget options!!
B0083GPDBO|3.0|The story line was interesting. The Blair witch like videography was annoying at times. The characters were interesting but not well developed and the movie moves very slow.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|At first it would not load an image, either from the gallery or camera. After restarting, it does and edits seem to work now. May be an app conflict?<br /><br />I think I'll be playing with it more before a final decision, but other than needing a restart, so far it's good.
B005HSL626|5.0|awesome because u get to slice fruit and its cool also therebqre home and if u spliced it game over and its fun because there is an exploson
B005LAIGYQ|3.0|Can you get past the terrible acting?  Let's let the soldiers do their jobs and the actors to theirs!<br /><br />Much like a George Lucas film I did get by the terrible acting, and it was an exciting movie as far as old fashioned special effects goes, but this isn't going to make my top ten war movies anytime soon.  Probably the best recruiter/propaganda film I've seen.  If you don't have the attention span to watch documentaries, then this is for you. I could spend a weekend watching the History Channel and learn about Navy Seals than I did from this movie.<br /><br />I will say that I came away with a better understanding of how these missions are carried out logistically, though you don't get a good sense of the time put into preparations for these missions.  Do they really surf all day and then go on a mission, or can we get a time stamp (a la Law & Order) to understand that they probably have a lot of field training as well as classroom time.
B0086700CM|5.0|All I have to say is wow!  I love it because it truly is a  challenging game!  I recommend to anyone who loves to compete with themselves to see if they can do better than they did the last run in the game.
B0030B0S2Q|2.0|So I was skeptical about paying $10 just to watch this film, once it began I was pretty excited seeing that the music was done by Clint Mansell and imagining a man going insane from isolation and being cut off from the nourishment of the planet Earth.  However, it turned into a ridiculous story about clones.  Wow exciting and creative - not.
B008DR27PI|5.0|This show is Always exciting, always entertaining, and there is always something to be learned from these brilliant lawyers and their lifestyles.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I can not understand who is buying into this crap- I don't mind the smut but shouldn't the characters at least be a tiny bit developed? or relatable?! I mean take away this guy's money and you are left with a super creepy stalker<br />it actually made me angry reading this, I kept going only because so many people seem to be going crazy over it<br />if you want to read the words \\"inner goddess\\" a million times then by all means this book is for you
0345803485|2.0|Okay so I broke down and bought this book after hearing many of my friends loved it!I was pretty excited to read it and started it the first day I bought it. I just finished the book yesterday and I'm extremely disappointed. The book, in my opinion has no climax (Other than the word climax used 46458 times by Ana). I was bored throughout the entire book. I couldn't help but keep thinking of \\"Twilight\\" during reading. Also the lack of variation in the words was extremely irritating to me. So many words were repeated that I could almost predict the next paragraph. Also this book isn't good for younger teens. I see many 14 and 15 year old girls reading this. That is not okay, they are given a false idea of sex. Ana was a virgin in the story and her first time was marvelous and she orgasms almost immediately every time. This probably is giving younger girls the idea that sex is always great and you don't have to love somebody to have sex. I'm starting to sound like a mother so I'll end my review here.  I still am not sure if I will buy the next book in the trilogy. Part of me is curious to see if the story gets better. Then the other part of me doesn't want to waste my money. I'll wait until I can find it on sale at my book store.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Challenging romantic relationship. Inticing story. Get lost in a different lifestyle and world set. Not for those with a closed mindset. Has a great range component.
B0086700CM|5.0|ive been waiting for this tam and now its finally here yay I love the game its got some glitches since the game was origanally made for I phones and Ipod touch but other than that its awesome
B0071T5PN0|5.0|This will be short and to the point. Buy this album . I listen to this CD alot and I am loving it. The Maestro Eddie attacks the selections with the fervor I have not heard since the early days of Fair Warning and VH II. Dave's voice has superbly matured like a fine vintage wine and projects the sexiness I expect from my all time fave California band. I miss Michael in the fab foursome though. Just sit back, listen and enjoy!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I read some reviews that didn't care for this book/series because the characters are not believeable blah blah blah! this isn't a biography...the characters are supposed to fictional. with that said...i feel in love the books. when i got to the kinky part (1st time for ana to see the playroom) i didn't think this was the kind of book i would care for...so i put it down. the next day curiosity killed the cat...i picked it up and never put it back down. I love how Christian Grey is such a complicated man with so many insecurities and a troubled past...and Ana in all her fiestiness and eagerness. awesome book just wish i didn't read the whole damn trilogy within days!
0671449028|5.0|This is the last book I always read to my 2 year old son before he goes to sleep, after reading a couple of other books.  He loves it and it's become part of our \\"ok - NOW it's time to go to sleep\\" routine.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Typically, I dislike Sci-fi, and am especially shy about self-published authors.  This series, though, very well written and edited.  The world it creates is believable.  The story is both engaging and devoid of many cliches that plague sci-fi.  This was my first Kindle purchase, and I will certainly buy more of his works.
0671027344|4.0|Without completely trying to refute prior reviews of this highly enjoyable novel, I have to say that the ending left me deflated.  Up until the last 20 or so pages, I felt a real connection with Charlie and his experiences in high school.  I, too, was the English geek: a voracious reader, sensitive, shy...the wallflower.  But as I began to see that Charlie had some fundamental psychiatric issues, this connection became more and more strained.  Yes, it is true that Charlie is essentially honest, but not always.  Ultimately he is afraid to confront people directly with uncomfortable feelings, to honestly express himself as is evident in his relationship with both Elizabeth and Sam.<br /><br />I think the trick here is to be a filter and not a sponge as we read Charlie's letters, as Bill, the English teacher, so aptly puts it. In the end, Charlie seemed to me to be more of a synthesis of Chauncey Gardner and Susanna Kaysen's \\"Girl Interrupted\\":  honest, naive, but ultimately broken.  The final meltdown severed the connection so that all that was left was a bit of nostalgia from the first 2/3 of the book.<br /><br />Now, don't get me wrong here.  The book is a fantastic read that really nails the voice of a gifted, sensitive, 16 year old.  The portrait of late 80's, early 90's Midwest America is spot on as Charlie navigates the murky emotional waters of pre-adulthood.  I especially enjoyed the ironic elements of Charlie, the wallflower, being more experienced than any of his family.<br /><br />I certainly recommend this book, especially to any adult who realizes he is out of touch with young people today and is interested in experiencing an honest account of life in high school.  But I would caution against considering this an anthem of sorts that expresses a complete picture.  After all, Charlie, like Chauncey and Susanna, experiences a range of events that probably exceeds the normal experience of most readers.  Ultimately Charlie rights himself after stumbling over his burden of secrets and guilt, but the positive ending reassures us that everything will work out in the end.
B000G9YQ7I|5.0|please make sure if they are black vinyl or red vinyl ....that you whant befor you buy... i have had it happen .
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a really fun game. I love bying people to run with and getting power ups. my favorite power is the invisible power. it comes in handy a lot of times.
B000LXCBTE|1.0|whatch out when buying this album .... ya its a red album cover and has black vinyl albums ...  its not an album with red vinyl records....
0670022411|5.0|How wonderful -- an erotic tale of vampire and witches, illuminated by references to history and literature, and written in graceful prose.  The author builds her plot well, with suspense building chapter by chapter.  I wanted the next book in the series immediately and will get it as soon as it comes out.
B006RUJST6|5.0|This is just one of those books I can't really describe. I loved it! The whole slam was a wonderful surprise and made for a fresh read. I love how Will and Lake started out. The conflict was a surprise as well.<br /><br />I'll leave it at that, but if you're looking for romance with a different plot line, then I'd say this is definetly it!<br /><br />The sequel--you'll want to read that, too.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Fun game. Kind of reminds me of Sim city back in the day. The only thing I don't like is you have to pay money to get anywhere in the game.. I would be happy just to pay one set price for the game
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I really enjoyed working with this editor. I have tried a few before and they were lacking.<br />This app was really functional.<br />the editing and the filters are really functional and really easy to use.<br />I recommend this app.
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome but big batterey hog and kind of tiring idk. idk idk idk idk idk idk idk idk idk idk idk.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This Bible app is very useful...I'm able to highlight and save my notes, as well as share on Facebook. The friendly reminders to get a 5 minute reading in are very encouraging. Thanks, God bless...
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very simple in nature but is very fun. It becomes addicting when you try to continually beat your previous score. Great graphics and especially good  on the kindle fire.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app is great and there are soooo many options that look really professional!! just one or two glitches here and there but overall I looove it!!!! ;)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|draw free is an addicting game I play back and forth with my friends. my friends and I love it! I highly reccomend this app.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I downloaded this app not knowing what to expect. My family uses photo editors all the time and we are quite familiar with how to use them and the benefits of having a good one. There are so many available and some are just not good. This photo app has a lot of features and is pretty powerful. It has a large selection of Edits, Filters, Frames and Extras with the option to save your work, post to Twitter or to Face book.<br /><br />I won't go over all the features but some I thought were nice are the fact that has a good pinch and zoom feature that is useful when editing the photo. Unfortunately the pinch and zoom feature worked great but only once. After I used it I could not get it to work again on multiple photos. It does a good job of cropping photos and it lets you add text at the top and bottom of the photo. You can even add cartoon speech boxes to the photos to add captions. You can add texts and adjust the font size, color and type. Using the stickers was fun to doctor up some photographs; my wife got a laugh at some of them I modified.<br /><br />The selection of picture frames is good and it adds a nice touch to a photo to enhance it. I did not feel that the red eye reduction worked well at all and I did not understand how to use the BG Fill option as it colorized the entire photo deleting the picture you were trying to edit. Overall this is a nice app but some features need to be improved and some more help information would help to improve learning how to use all of the features properly. I am not sure if it is worth the price of $4.99 they are asking for it, that seems a bit high.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|I tried loading a picture from my gallery and it gave me an error about Kindle Fire OS.  But I have a Motorola Electrify.  (same as Photon) ?  I should also add that I have problems loading from my gallery in Instagram but there they have an option of loading from file, but this app does not have that option.
B0086700CM|3.0|I agree that it stays the same and you get nowhere! It does get old and boring quickly! Spice it up!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I have this on my phone computer and kindle and it syncs great between them all. its so easy to use and such a handy program with so many uses. it has replaced all our written notes that use to get lost. I absolutely love it.
0553062182|4.0|Although the writing style of the book is somewhat simple, the information within is fascinating reading and the simple style makes it easily accessible.
0439023513|2.0|The first book was on of the best and well constructed I've ever had the joy to read.  The second was a disappointment and the third a train wreck.  I would have liked to have some closure instead of a lot of loose ends.  It looked like the author glanced up at the clock and said \\"oh dear, times up....better finish this one off\\"  Spoiler alert:  did the last hunger game happen?????  What happened in the trial of Petta???  Was Gail's ending any happier???  How about the Mother??? did she ever see her daughter again?  I'm sorry that so many hours were spent waiting for victory that came without any joy.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Hate to trash a free offer but the app just locks up on my X10... doesn't do anything just a black screen that eventually turns white.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|Just what the title says. It tricks kids into spending real money on acorns and fake money. Can't find a way to get the \\"items\\" returned
B007DIQC90|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this band. I first heard \\"Little Talks\\" on a local radio station where I live and I was ionstantly enamored with it. I hit the tag button on the Shazam app on my phone to find out what it was, then linked to Amazon to buy it. I later created a Pandora station based on them and by extension, discoverd all of the songs on this album. Their voices all work so harmoniously together and their stories are so different from what we usually hear in the states. \\"Dirty Paws\\", for example, evokes a folktale about mythical creatures while tying in themes that are relevent to our time such as polution and war. \\"From Finner\\" seems to be about a whale and is so enchanting. The female singers voice is so unique and different from anything that I have ever heard. All in all, this is a fantastic album and this band has a big future in music. Most albums are only good for a few songs but this album is worth the entire download.
B005LAIGWS|1.0|I can honestly say this was worse than Catwoman, worse than Batman & Robin, worse than Elektra, and yes even worse than the unreleased Roger Corman's Captain America film. I went into this with a good attitude, having bean a fan of Nevldine/Taylor's prior work (Crank, Crank 2, Gamer).<br /><br />The movie if difficult to fallow, it jumps around has numerous insert shots that are all out of left field. If I tell you about any of them you will think I am BSing you, that's how WTF? they are. They even through in a token black guy who dose nothing more than say a few one liners. The plot well their isn't really any plot, they drive around for 1 hour then briefly fight a bad guy. The special effects look terrible, What pathetic attempt their was at a story is beyond predictable I saw every so called twist coming a mile away and so will you. I am also a fan of Nicolas cage and have bean my whole life, this however is the worst acting performance I have ever seen. You can really tell he was just their for the pay check. I have seriously seen better acting from extras in Godzilla movies. If you don't believe me look at the other reviews on here 99% of them are negative, this is one of the few instances Critics and Audiences agree, Don't waste your time, this is 78 minutes of your life you will want back.<br /><br />Calling this movie Shit would be an insult to Shit.
B0086700CM|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire.  Great way to waste a little time or entertain myself when bored.  No need to ever spend real money if you are able to accomplish simple task.  Obviously above the limitations of a few reviewers.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|VZW Galaxy Nexus. This app is fantastic! Zero issues grabbing a file from my gallery. Zero issues saving it to my phone (you do NOT need to upload to Twitter or FB... look at beginning of your gallery as it renames file). All modifications are easily applied on the fly using sliders, and can be discarded if not beneficial. I have to say most bad reviews are operator error. Great app and I highly recommend it!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it keeps me entertained all day. even my children fight me now for my kindle.I suggest everyone get this
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great read, the kind of book you don't want to put down. Reminds one of the government taking over everything in G.O.'s 1984.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love I love it it itit ito a a a it it it it it it. it it it
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Its pretty cool to be able to play so many games for free. And they aren't all that hard either. haha. thanks!
B003YFIUW8|4.0|This book was written from a very unique perspective, that of a young boy kept with his mother in one room for the first 5 years of his life.  While hard to read from a mother's point of view, it was still a page turner.  The characters are well developed and the story never turns maudlin.  I enjoyed it very much and would read other books by this author.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I have just downloaded this, and played with the app for a few minutes. I love the design of the UI - clearly a lot of thought went into this, the mark of good upfront design. As a software architect, this tells me that the underlying code is probably also well done, which bodes well for the future of this app. I have no doubt that I will be able to find things that I don't like, or believe could be improved, but the mere fact that I'm motivated to not only use the app, but also actively look for &quot;stuff&quot; (techie term there) that might trigger the software design part of my brain, is a good sign. If in the future you need a beta tester (or even alpha), you have a willing volunteer here. Considering the price I paid - zero! - this is the least I could do.<br /><br />Congratulations.<br />David.
0345803485|4.0|The first book was my favorite but the series went downhill after that. I can't stand the main characters. Frankly I think Anastasia is so slow to pick up on things and is more of a pushover than the book wants to admit. I'm still trying to figure out why people love Christian. At points I wondered if females would start to think Christian is the type of guy they should strive for... oh please no. The sex scenes are a bit much for me and overkill (I really don't need to know every detail). The series could've cut out a bunch and made it two books. The writing is also not good, but I went in knowing that. All that being said, I still enjoyed the series and am really glad I read it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|FOUR AND  HALF STARS?!?! WHAT THE HECK?!?!?! HOW IS THAT EVEN POSSIBLE!??!?!?!?!???!? bestselling book/movie gets 4 1/2 stars. not FIVE. four. -.-
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|So I've been listening to this album for a few days now, and while I don't have any strong opinions yet, I will say one thing: This is classic Fiona.  It's not like Extraordinary Machine, which was awful except for about 3 songs.  And it's not the type of schlock that people like Jane Monheit or Diana Krall release either (a direction that I was worried she'd go in).<br /><br />It's more like Tidal, or to a lesser extent, When the Pawn Hits...  The strong piano and vocals at the forefront are reminiscent of Shadowboxer.  I do wish they had kept the Optigan and Chamberlin in use as they were really unique instruments that differentiated her music.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Got this as the free app of the day, but for me personally, the kindle fire is not a real tablet to do alot of work on.  It's great for reading and game playing, but not the ideal device for photo editing.
B00881VLCE|5.0|Awesome, best puzzle game on my kindle fire. You can buy more or get free puzzles to add to the collection that comes with the game. Endless puzzles to choose from!
B00884GR0W|2.0|This was a complete rerun of minecraft pocket edition. Please quit slamming the app store with scrappy refund of fantastic games.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|It works well on my Droid and has nice frames. But it doesn't matter how good the editing or effects are if it saves a low resolution photo! I have an 8MP camera, and when I saved it asked me which save quality. I choose high and it have me a low 92 res photo.<br />FYI the only editor I've found that doesn't reduce resolution is Photo Enhance Pro, but the options are sadly very basic.
B004HD2ZIQ|5.0|i didnt like these guys much till i saw them with JUDAS PRIEST, Lemmy was awesome<br />the music bad ass. now im a big motorhead fan. now i been buying there cds, wow what bad ass music.
B00881VLCE|4.0|my 7 year old and I do. them together. lots of fun and I  like that you can choose the size of puzzle.
B0086700CM|4.0|when I bought it great now okay but it is still very fun so overall I really like it for your input
B00005JNTX|1.0|So this DVD seemed promising as the menu was up and I was geared up to watch this excellent movie...but then once it started something very important seemed to be missing....yes it was the audio throughout the film. There was audio in the menu but not the actual movie...so that was pretty lame
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Just plan and simple..this app doesn't work...Don't waste your time. Find some other photo editer for your phone or tablet.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I WAS EXPECTING MUCH MORE. IT DRAGGED. I THOUGHT IT WOULD HAVE PULLED ME IN, BUT IT DIDN'T. THE ONLY INTERESTING PART WAS CHRISTIAN. :-)
B007VTVGAQ|1.0|The production of bringing the vocals and plunky piano to the forefront, and relegating every other sound to background music is so distracting that I can't even really pay attention to what she's singing. The monotone sound of the entire album (with the exception of the last song) makes it sound like one long morose song without anything in the way of variety. I hear great lyrics but I end up just skipping songs before they finish. I realize this production was all intentional, but it doesn't make it good. It would have been interesting on a couple songs, but a whole album? No thank you.
B005XOPEOU|4.0|Coldplay's 2012 release, MYLO XYLOTO, has a lot in common with their previous VIVA LA VIDA.  Listeners who were turned off by the band's revamped sound in VIVA LA VIDA will probably not enjoy this album.  With Brian Eno returning as producer, this album finds Coldplay shifting their sound, trying to straddle the fence between pop rock and art rock.  For what it's worth, MYLO XYLOTO works better as a pop record than it does an expression of art.  Where ViVA LA VIDA found Coldplay trying to reach new creative heights, MYLO XYLOTO feels like a much safer album.<br /><br />I'm not quite sure what happened to the production of this album.  Several reviewers have complained about the over-mastered/overcompression of all the sound.  It seems strange, since Brian Eno also produced this record.  VIVA LA VIDA had active dynamics -- songs would gradually shift from soft to loud.  When the band was loud, you could feel it.  For example, in the last track (\\"Death and All of His Friends,\\") the final explosion of sound works so well because the rest of the song was soft in comparison.  There are no real dynamics here.  It takes a toll on MYLO XYLOTO.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Hurts Like Heaven,\\" a solid song that sets the tone for the album.  It is a conventional song, but it is given a smattering of art-rock ambiance.  The rest of the album finds the band repeating this technique: taking conventional songs, but through layering, making them sound stranger or more creative than before.  The acoustic-focused \\"Us Against the World\\" feels like a track could have made its way onto PARACHUTES -- it's classic Coldplay.  \\"Major Minus\\" finds the band taking a few unexpected directions, and the distortion added to Chris Martin's delivery works wonders -- it's great to see the band step outside of its comfort zone.  The greatest moments on this album are when the band embraces its pop sensibilities.  \\"Paradise,\\" \\"Charlie Brown\\" and \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall,\\" are all great songs, but they make no attempt to hide their mainstream accessibility.<br /><br />This is a good record, but I think it pales in comparison to the rest of Coldplay's output.  Fans of VIVA LA VIDA will enjoy MYLO XYLOTO; additionally, fans of Keane, the Fray, or Snow Patrol will find material here to enjoy.  Standout highlights are: \\"Paradise,\\" \\"Charlie Brown,\\" and \\"Every Teardrop is a Waterfall.\\"  This is an album worth checking out, but I really hope there is another remastered edition floating around somewhere., but they make no attempt to hide their mainstream accessibility.<br /><br />This is a good record, but I think it pales in comparison to the rest of Coldplay's output.

B000002TQB|5.0|Blur's 1994 release, PARKLIFE, is one of the best albums of the 90's.  Largely overlooked in North America, PARKLIFE cemented Blur as a Britpop phenomenon -- a band that wasn't ashamed to be British but unafraid to try out American ideas.  Blur frontman Damon Albarn would much later develop Gorillaz, but his tendency to try out new musical ideas and genre was first evident here.  PARKLIFE is an experiment, but it's so surehanded, it rarely feels like one.<br /><br />The album begins with \\"Girls & Boys,\\" an unapologetic salute to the British glam bands (T. Rex, David Bowie, etc...) of the past.  Radiohead's Thom Yorke would go to say that his biggest regret in life is that he wasn't the one to write \\"Girls & Boys.\\"  The song blends a catchy melody, a killer pick-slide, and propulsive drums to create a fun, poppy single.  It's the perfect way to start the album.  The next track, \\"Tracy Jacks\\" shows that, even when Blur works with familiar formulas, the results overshadow the competition.  It's a conventional rock song, but it's focus on melody makes it a fantastic addition to the album.  These two songs (\\"Girls & Boys\\" and \\"Tracy Jacks\\") sum up the entire album -- PARKLIFE is both a strange meddling of trends and a refinement of preexisting genres.<br /><br />Fans of alternative rock need to listen to this album; it's an essential entry to the canon of alternative.  PARKLIFE establishes Damon Albarn has a powerful creative force with a fantastic ear for melody.  Standout tracks to sample: \\"Girls and Boys,\\" \\"Parklife,\\" \\"Badhead,\\" \\"Tracy Jacks,\\" -- well, they're actually all good.  You owe it to yourself to check out this album.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is an easy app and offers different levels. I can complete a puzzle at the &quot;Master&quot; level and my grandchildren can complete the same puzzle at their level.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Just tried a few random features. Worked fine on my R2D2. Will try later on the Transformer. You can save to device or facebook/twitter. Didn't crash for me. I like it. :)
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This editor works fine on my ASUS T300. All the negatives are wrong; It tilts, crops, saves to pad, etc. First run through it explains all the options and controls. I've used Photoshop and this does a lot of that, but simply and easily.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I see nothing interesting about this book. A stupid college girl and a sick young punk. this book is so repetitious, i fell asleep reading it.

B008011XQQ|4.0|I am so glad that Carlos Santana has gone back to the style of music that has made him one of the most recognizable and best rock guitarists of all time. I enjoyed the variety and the selection of the songs on this CD and I have to say his guitar playing is still right up there.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy was the best i've ever read. I read all the books in less than a week and a half and I would read it again. No money wasted here. A must read!!!
B000FBHC7S|5.0|TAKE ALL THE SOUNDS IN THE UNIVERSE, CONDENSE THEM , ADD THE ULTIMATE COSMIC FORCE, UNLEASH THE EXPLOSION INTO YOUR BRAIN, AND THERE YOU HAVE IT....THE HEAVIEST THING EVER REALIZED......NOTHING EVEN COMES CLOSE......
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The main character is a typical abuser. He holds his advantage over a young vulnerable woman. It is in some women's nature to try and fix, change, and heal those who need help. The sequel should have stopped here as the ending is as it should be. Sex activities are fine if both parties are game with a level playing field.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I really like this app! It was free for the day, so I thought I'd check it out. it's awesome!!!!!! ;)
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Quite an enjoyable read. I finally had time to sit down and read for entertainment, that said...I read it in two days! I am ready for the sequel. If you enjoy mystery, otherworldly beings, a twist on magical beings, mortality, and romance then you will enjoy this book!
B0086700CM|5.0|Simple and addictive gameplay.  Great for short bursts of downtime.  Doesn't even require ridiculous in-app purchases like some other games.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I use ColorNote Notepad every day and find it quick and easy to use and navigate. The sync feature is very helpful in keeping all my devices updated so that I am never without up to date notes and check-lists. Works very well with the Kindle Fire. Need to add ability to sync with Google Calendar, would be 5 stars then.
B005VR9328|5.0|Undun is a very well put together album with a light and gentle feel. The album is a re-telling of the life of Redford Stephens and his decisions in the streets. The production is rather excellent, delivering melodic beats with a laid back feel and crisp drums. The live instrument aspect of The Roots have always separated and distinguished them from everyone else. The lyrics on the album are strong and deep as Black Thought and others touch on society, the streets and critical decisions. The lyricists flow over the beat and complement the production well. Undun is very cohesive as each track flows into each other well, just don't listen to it if you are trying to get hype. My only gripe is the length and the interludes & skits. A must listen.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Great mishmash of items which you create to make more items.Pure alchemy!Try it!All the negative reviews are lies!I had the best expieence with my kids creating all sorts of whamo that would be a time killer!I upgraded to full version!Sweet!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Excellent!  David Baldacci one of the best authors in the business.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat.  A can't put down book.  Highly recommended.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Version 2.0.4 in the Play Store.  Everything here is either junk and a waste of time or outdated with bugs or missing features!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Davis does a really great job of describing the \\"problem\\". The language is easily accessible to the plain reader and sheds clear light on some serious issues with our food options. I never quite got the issue with carbs (even good carbs) until Davis explained it. I also wondered how my ancestors ate wheat for so many generations and had so little trouble with it. This book is fills in a lot of knowledge gaps and I'm already seeing the results of applying the sound advice offered. Thank you Dr. Davis!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|perfect calculator. serves my basic needs. comes in very handy in the grocery store and when shopping in general perfect for everyday use.
B001FB55Y4|5.0|Great flick, awesome dialogue. Voice over totally works. I never thought I'd see a humorous action scene, but Richie pulled it off.  Snatch veers a little into seriousness and suffers from comparison to true hard boiled works, but this perfectly balances comedy, crime and even drugs.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I play this game all the time, it's easy to use and lots of fun. I completely recommend this game to all users. :)
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This is a great game. I sit down to play it and before I know it, hours have passed! It will provide you with hours of fun.

B007D2XSW0|4.0|O.K I figured out why so many folks are sad with App.  After reading all the bad reviews on this App, I thought heck it's free lets see why all bad reviews.  I installed this on 4 devices as a test.... My phone with 2.2 Froyo  Had the issues, my 7 tablet with dualcore CPU and gingerbread. 2.3.4 , had the issues, my Asus Transformer Prime with Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.3  Had NO Issues and works as advertised.  My new 7 inch Poloroid Tablet Single core with ICS 4.0.3 , While a tad slow works as advertised........  Meaning All the folks winning about how bad this app is, had phones with either 2.2 or 2.3 installed....... Even the Kindle fire has a variant of Android 2.3.4 so............  Stop blasting the Dev for staying up to date, what yall need to do is call your phone provider and amazon( for all with a fire)  And have them update the OS software to meet Modern Specs.........  Jelly Bean comes out in a month.... So folks with Andoid 2.2 Really need to get updates:)  And amazon , Either update your fire, or lower the price, My poloroid with 4.0 was only 90 bucks , and runs loops around your fire......  With a single core CPU to boot.... I anit sayin I'm Just sayin.......:)
B007SGM084|5.0|I bought the trilogy, have a kindle & kindle on my phone. Started reading & could not put it down!! Once I started telling a friend about it she borrowed my kindle & read it on there. Once you start reading the first book you are glued to the story. I would read walking around the house. I finished all 3 books in less than a week. I usually don't read before I go to bed but these books I read all the time. The author did very well keeping the reader's attention, the twists along the way, some predictable others a surprise, all well timed. I was sad that I was almost finished with the last book, sometimes you just don't want a story to end! I thought it was a very good trilogy, very well written even the risque parts.
B005HSL626|5.0|the fruit on the game looks like its real! I play this game all the time I have so many backgrounds and new swords that I think are really cool :)
B007D2XSW0|3.0|the developer seems to be heading in the right direction with the app... nice interface, good selection of tools, enhancements and effects. but a few things (that I found) just aren't working too well or need to be better implemented...<br /><br />&quot;pinch to zoom&quot; and &quot;two finger panning&quot; is broken... I could zoom into a photo once, couldn't zoom out and the zoom wouldn't work again until the app was &quot;force closed&quot;. trying to pan around the photo just doesn't work at all.<br /><br />saving a photo... the choices for the resolution are great, but there is no way to change the location of the file.<br /><br />exiting the app... using the back button does not close the app and when reopened, the last last photo that was being worked on is still resides.<br /><br />Overall &quot;good to very good&quot; but needs a few more tweaks.<br />reviewed on a toshiba thrive.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app it is very fun and complicated I think everyone loves a challenge if you like points winning games challenges and shoppping you'll love this app
0547569653|5.0|So far so good!  It's a very interesting read and I'm very happy for Scott!<br /><br />In the book he talks about coming from a \\"redneck\\" school.  Very true! Proctor is the land of flannel shirts and red solo cup parties.<br /><br />The book is worth a read on many levels.  You can learn a lot from this, even if you have no interest in running.<br />The recipes, encouragement and straight forward writing makes it an enjoyable read.<br /><br />Please read it you'll be happy you did.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I have tried quite a few photo editors over the past year and this is the best one. It is user friendly and has quite a lot of fun editing tools, filters, and frames, not to mention all the fun little extras like talk bubbles, hats and clip art that can be added.  Thanks esDOT Development Studio.
B001EAWMGA|4.0|I'm a huge fan of Jim Caviezel and, when I saw this on tv, I knew I had to have it.  It's a bit corny in places but one of the better \\"8 PM SciFi Sat. movies\\".  A good story to it and most of the acting is pretty good.  I'm very happy with this purchase and, if you like Jim Caviezel or just a pretty good scifi movie, I'd recommend it.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Graphics r great but once I logged on I could not exit game.  I had to shut down to exit.  Removed program from my device.
B00170MYIS|5.0|Bought this about 2.5 months ago after learning my daughter's 3 y/o camera wouldn't power up, and the stock battery was all icky / leaking looking. I've never had a li-on battery get bad like this, but since I'm reviewing this replacement and not the original, it gets all 5 stars. As others have mentioned it is compatible with the info-lithium capabilities of some cameras which guesses at time remaining and not just a \\"fuel\\" gauge. Capacity seems fine and holds a charge as expected. Some reviewers report suspicion of getting a fake battery - I didn't notice any funny business with the battery or packaging, ordered from seller \\"AC365\\". When in doubt and the prices are close, just click on the XX New button and order direct from Amazon for best odds and easiest returns. An aside - the leaking battery (which was left in the charger, unplugged, for months at a time) messed up the charger and I replaced that with [[ASIN:B003SFKAMC Sony BC-CSG OEM Battery Charger for NP-BG1, NP-FG1 battery]] with success.
1936608898|5.0|This is a great book, and wll worth the read. An excellent companion to Robb Wolf's book, I recommend both.  Buy it, read it, try it....
B0086700CM|5.0|Its great I got my kindle and this is the game that popped first and I got it its great it like u go over and over and u like to fillet coins and just keep going even if u get mad u do it again and again Get it its an AMAZING games I love it make ur own review to see what u think bout it :) thanks
B004T2QZL8|1.0|There's no valid reason that this game should need my gps location. Before the update this game was actually pretty fun, but now that it's basically spyware, I'm going to have to uninstall it.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Satisfies my puzzle urges! ;)  Easy to use.  Cute puzzles.  As challenging as you want to make it. What more can you ask for?
0307591549|4.0|A well written explanation of mechanics of happiness and its underlying science for lay persons.  While the title targets work environments, the principles are applicable for all.<br /><br />The author goes deeper than others in this space.  If you've already read books about friends at work or employee engagement, this takes things a step beyond to the next level of why things work the way they do.<br /><br />This book can also be enjoyed beyond it's serious intent. It is written in a lively style.  Good for that long business flight or getaway vacation. There are any number of enjoyabke annecdotes to share with friends, family and business assoicates.
0316066524|4.0|What if there was a form of entertainment so mind capturing that viewers would abandon all else in favor of the said entertainment? They would forget to eat, forget to sleep, and even forget to use the restroom as they were carried away by The Entertainment.<br /> Loosely, this is the question that is under scrutiny in the massive 1000 + page tomb from the late David Foster Wallace. More broadly, pretty much everything comes into question in Infinite Jest. The \\"plot\\" of this thing can't really be pinned down, nor should be, and so I'm not going to attempt that one.<br /> As a postmodern work, the reader of Infinite Jest will be dropped rudely into an already moving, fluid and ludicrous backdrop where you might find yourself asking again and again, \\"Did he just go there?\\" And finding that the answer is always: yes, yes he did. It's unlike Wallace's \\"Broom of the System\\" in that you are never going to fully or maybe even partially know what the heck is going on. Oh sure, you'll formulate multiple questions about the characters of the work and become interested in their outcome, but in the end, for-getta-bout-it.<br /> This is the reason that probably the majority of mainstream readers will shy away from Infinite Jest, but here are some reasons it is worth its weight. Number one: it's intelligent. While not quite like reading the Oxford English Dictionary (as one of the several dozens of characters for whom we hear a perspective in the work does), it does offer a bit of information on any and every kind of subject. For those who have never touched an addictive substance to those who have felt the shakes of withdrawal, Wallace makes the addiction and its consequences informative, real, and oddly entertaining; addictions that range from substance abuse, emotional dependency, media reliance, and even vanity issues. Through Wallace's characters all things, all emotions, all scenarios are possible and probable.<br /> Another reason to dive into Infinite Jest is the humor. You will find it's not a laugh-fest as you wade through the intricacies and details of the work, but it is witty and thought provoking as the character bounce off and into each other in a broken timeline of years that have names like \\"Year of the Trial Size Dove Bar\\" and \\"Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment.\\"<br /> Perhaps the reason I would read Infinite Jest again and would recommend it to the patient reader is the places that this work will take you. Those who know a little about David Foster Wallace know that this man of prolific writing capability committed suicide in 2008 after more than 20 years of struggling with depression. This element lends itself in Infinite Jest as Wallace talks through his characters about the consideration of suicide, the attempts, and what it truly means to decide to \\"erase one's own map.\\"<br /> The phrases like \\"offing one's map\\" and developing a case of the \\"howling fantods\\" are what make the novel endearing and unique. Wallace is speaking his own language in his own world that he has created, and...it's damn impressive.<br /> Wallace has a way of providing commentary on issues that makes them interesting in their own right. He has you considering whether filmmakers are purposefully bad in their art or just plain bad, and then not even ten pages later you are considering how much food an average human would consume over their lifetime and what a room filled with said food might actually look like?<br /> In the end, the novel is going to turn you upside down, vertical, and put you back horizontal (page 902). It's going to make you think a little more, and mourn a little for the loss of the author that brought you on such a wild trip. While not for the faint of heart, it's definitely one to get lost in. As David Eggers says in the forward, the debate between whether fiction should be easy to read or challenging will still rage on, but the rewards to challenging reads can indeed be quite great.
B005K2XUPK|5.0|This case is always on my Samsung Galaxy 7.0, I bought it because my tablet is the same size as the Kindle Fire. The fit is perfect, the liner is soft so it will not scratch the screen. The Case is very well built, threre were a few loose threads, but nothing that would cause it to fall apart. My only suggestion to Timbuk 2 would be to not pad the flap that cloes over. The padding is kinda thick in the flap, and the fabric it covers, so it makes it pretty thick on the flap side. Other than that, great case!<br /><br />  Dodger
B008BQL77K|5.0|This is great television. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but is consistently entertaining. Like Burn Notice, each show fits a quick and exciting story into a 45 minute window while continuing to follow a seasonal story arc. Highly recommended.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|It's really cool. I just don't understand why you need full internet access to use the stuff that's already part of the phones built in functions.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|Great game! Have blast killing time with it! I hate that I have to have 30 words or more lol
B002RI9ZUE|5.0|This book is amazing.  Sylvia Plath is an amazing writer, and it takes you into her mind just before she took her own life.  While the book is not an auto-biography, it contains many aspects of her own life within it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|My husband really enjoyed these books, even though he never read a single page. His only complaint was that I read way too fast and then went back to reading boring, non sex crazed smut :) Oh, and the first sex scene is amazing by the way!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app rocks! I now have this on my ipad and kindle. this has some really cool effects. I love it, id recommend it for anyone
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This series of books by Diana Gabaldon is by far the best I have ever read when it comes to historical fiction/romance.  Her characters come to life before your eyes!  I can't wait to see what happens next for Jamie and Claire!!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Well what can I say not my usual book but it was brilliant lots of sex great story line.<br />Cant wait to read the other 2 books
B0074VTHKM|3.0|Another nice story that moves along okay.  The characters are fairly well developed and the plot is makes perfect sense.
0345803507|5.0|I read all three books.  For a book that one would normally not read, it was almost impossible to put it down.<br />If you want to join in everyone's conversation where ever you go today It Is A Must Read!!!!!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised at the sweet charm of this book. There is a simple intensity to the plot that keeps the reader wrapped in it's clutches until the final pages. Although at times despondent due to the deep loneliness of the main character, the hopeful snatches of a brighter future ring true to the heart of humanity. It is that simple human desire: to love and be loved, to need and to be needed that is reflected in this delightful novel.
B007D2XSW0|3.0|with AT&T Anvil/ZTE-Z990 running Gingerbread. Downloaded and installed but crashes on startup - deinstalled. would love to try this app but it seems many apps fail on the ZTE-Z990 smartphone.
B00881VLCE|4.0|it would be perfect if it had a few more images for the puzzles ...it's would be a great game with minor. adjustments
0307477479|5.0|In short: I'm obsessed with this book.<br /><br />Due to its quick buzz on the interwebs, I recommended it to my book club (not the hipster-ish book club, the other one, with the old ladies) and it didn't go over well. One read 11% and had nothing to say other than &#34;if you can't remember a character's name, it must be a bad book&#34;; one couldn't believe there was a powerpoint presentation in a fiction novel; the other two - the actual old ladies (who I should mention ride Harleys so that 'old lady' is perceived properly) were pretty meh about it.<br /><br />Admittedly, I love music-fiction, when done properly. And when I read a good book about punk...well. I think that some authors who have an obsession with music (more than the rest, that is) to an extent to implement it into their story tend to lose sight of the novel part, and go off on some tangent about music. Such was not the case with A Visit from the Goon Squad. It's another ambitious book that reads with a certain Palahniuk flair. Every character is basically insane in that they have at least one weird quirk that they are not obtuse about. I became invested in this travel-driven story through the characters early on. It's definitely one of those unputdownables; I read it in like a day. Whilst the powerpoint presentation was not necessary, I think it added the value to the eccentricity of the book and its characters. I thought it played off of its weirdness, and did it well.<br /><br />It's a nice balance of music and unique literature that I really loved. Until Palahniuk writes a book about punk, it'll be my favorite ladeedah piece.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|very simple interface. it only needs a button for instagram.  I think my wife can use this with just a few questions. hopefully the update will add the instagram.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|My children got this series for me for Mother's Day. I have been wanting it for some time. This is one of my favorite programs. It is family friendly except for maybe one or two episodes. It takes you back to what America was like as people began to move westward. For those who like history and pioneer days, this is a great series. My whole family loves it and it is something we can all watch together.
0143039431|5.0|The book arrived in described condition in a timely manner.  This is an excellent edition if one is reading this for educational purposes.  I'm just reading for pleasure, but it's nice to have the extra info if needed.
B003HARV98|5.0|Wow, what a FUN and YUMMY release! This is truly great pop, with a unique 80's meets modern sound, that leaves you wanting more!  Marina's voice is excellent and energetic, with shades of Lene Lovich quirkiness that swallows you whole!  'Hollywood' and 'Mowglis Road' are amazing!  Don't miss out... get this NOW!
B0036TGT3E|1.0|Product did come on time, I will give them that at BCS and only that. The title clearly stated \\"TWO disc DVD/Blu-ray\\" and \\"COMBO\\" which to me translates into TWO not ONE item. This title is misleading and falsoe advertising. I was disatisfied to only recieve the Blu-ray disc and not the DVD. The only thing combined was a Blu-ray with a case, not even any artwork. When contacting BCS for a refund, they refunded the purchase price, just be ready to pay for shipping TWICE. The customer service told me to read the fine print of the product. I feel like I bought a car, but engine not included.
159562015X|3.0|This book worked pretty well for me. I was able to work through my strengths pretty quickly to identify them. It's well written and I had no trouble understanding the individual strengths. However, I personally could have benefited from some direction for proceeding with those strengths - but that's not so much what the book is about!
B000BJ7BCK|5.0|This is a great movie!!  Although there are almost no \\"Special features\\", if your goal is to have a copy of this movie for whenever you need some silly fun, definitely buy it.  Amazon recommends not to write \\"too short\\" a review.  What am I?  Wonder Woman?  (The right people will know why that was funny.)
B0075PYG1M|3.0|Some pleasant moments here and there, but I can't really recommend this album because it's periodically marred by unskilled, aimless instrumental noodling and embarrassingly trite/tired lyrics. I normally hate to criticize an artist for experimenting, but in this case the experiments in question don't really go anywhere interesting. Some of the guests bring spark to the proceedings, but others are just distracting. And yes, the Nirvana cover at the end is a complete abortion (as you might expect on a lite-jazz/smooth-hop album).<br /><br />Long story short: while this might be a pleasant album to put on in the background, especially at this low price, don't buy it if you're looking for more than that.<br /><br />Oh, and if you're interested in a much higher-quality album with a similar jazz/rap/poetry soundscape, I recommend the 2002 Blackalicious rekkid \\"Blazing Arrow.\\"
B004D2GMR6|5.0|I think I was in middle school or just entering my freshman year when my best friend and I started listening to Bon Jovi and all the other rock groups. This dvd just brought back memories of the good ole days. I bought this dvd as a father`s day gift for my husband as well as Journey and he loved it. BonJovi and Richie Sambora still rock after all these years.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I haven't gotten the game... but wanna know why? because I have to pay $3.00 for something that I can get for free on my phone. I don't know what's wrong with that or why it is. but I play it on my phone for free, but my kindle has a bigger screen so its easier. but I have to pay $3.00 for it!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game has kept me so busy these past few days. I cant find the time to put down the game to sleep.

B00000K3D4|5.0|Labyrinth is one of my all time favorite movies. It's full of Muppet characters and based on a bedtime story that was told to cause children to behave. It's funny, sad, and keeps you moving with the story. This is a movie that the whole family will love. I'd give it more than five stars but that is as high as they go.
B004HV54TU|3.0|Full disclosure: my desk is not the best setup, but I would argue that it is \\"average,\\" and thus the review is valid in that context. Maybe someone with a more ergonomically setup desk space will have better luck. Estimated time of use: 1 week at time of review.<br /><br />Pros: movement is quite smooth, vertical design holds arm in a \\"more\\" neutral position, many buttons for customization.<br /><br />Cons: I have small hands, used the print out to measure, and this mouse is still too big. I constantly feel like I am gripping up to get my fingers in the right place. The thumb buttons are in a really awkward position and I find you can only really use one(mainly the top one)  or the other since they are spaced so strangely. The scroll wheel does not have an unlock function so you must move things click by click (although you can change the number of frames that the scroll moves), there is no horizontal scroll, the scroll wheel itself is in a really strange spot where it's not natural to use either your index or middle finger to scroll. They say you can customize the buttons, but they neglect to say that it is only to the presets they have (which, I admit, is a lot, but I don't think it's too much to ask for the software to just allow the user to setup his own macros like all other programmable mice).<br /><br />Prior to this mouse, I had a lot of shoulder pain that I attributed to long hours at the computer. The mouse somewhat alleviates the pain, but now pain has migrated to my elbow region/different region of the shoulder since wielding the mouse is a bit awkward (could be most due to the size still being too big). But I think it has to do with the fact that you can't \\"drag\\" the mouse as much in a normal way, you have to sort of pick it up to move it around if you want to move far. Also, as some other users have noted, it puts your whole arm in an elevated position, and this doesn't feel so great after a while.<br /><br />I think it was a great idea, but there arestill some kinks to be worked out. It may work for people with bigger hands/better work space, but not for me.

0385737955|2.0|Quick read with an interesting enough plot. Dashner does a great job of front-loading the book with enough suspense to keep me flipping the pages. First half of the book filled with interesting compelling questions-- I was especially intrigued by the Grievers (or as I called them in my head-- the smoke monsters). A question that was never explicitly asked, but that I kept with the whole book, though, was why this book was really only populated by boys? Not a book that would pass the Bechdel Test, and it's never clear why this is the case. Author's choice? Something that will be explained in later books? I've read about a dozen or so of these young adult dystopian books in the last year, and this is the first one with a male protagonist, but I don't understand why all but one of the other characters were boys as well.<br /><br />Not a book I'd recommend to others. Though the questions asked were interesting, the answers weren't and all felt a bit ridiculous. Did make me want to re-read one of my favorite books from middle school, which I remember having a very similar (but more satisfying) plot-- Invitation to [[ASIN:1442409398 The Game]] by Monica Hughes. (Interestingly enough, this is listed with Maze Runner as a book people tend to buy together.)

B004LUHQ1G|5.0|This is one of those rare albums that has nothing but GREAT SONGS. Unbelievable that after all this time, all the CDs (of which I own every one), all the bandmates that've come and gone, that FF has put together their best yet. Ripe for alternative, punk, and rock fans, it shows Dave and the boys can still put together a terrific set of songs that everyone can listen to and enjoy. If Wasting Light is any indication of the direction The Foo are headed, I'm along for the ride until the last note's been rocked-out.
B007P6VLRS|4.0|This album contains beautiful soundscapes and chilling melodies.  It doesn't so much build, as it does flow.  More of a concept record, in terms of the sound.  Billy Corgan writes and records what he wants.  I respect him for that.  Listen, and enjoy.  Leave the past behind.
032109333X|5.0|This \\"Complete Works\\" is everything I was looking for. Unlike many versions out there that induce headaches after 20 seconds, the text in this version was spaced in a way that did not feel cramped and dizzying. Only the lines that have footnotes are numbered, but there are enough footnotes to easily identify the current line number. This system makes it much easier for the reader to access the editor's notes. Sure, it's not the latest edition, but it's not like the text really changes. All it did was made this incredible version the best and cheapest out there!

B005LAIHYU|4.0|Timur Bekmambetov, a screenwriter, producer, and director, was born in Kazakhstan and is perhaps known best for the Russian action films \\"Nightwatch\\" and \\"Daywatch\\" and the bullet-bending spectacular \\"Wanted.\\" Bekmambetov is notorious for taking what is usually a really farfetched concept and making it way more enjoyable than it probably should be. So it was no surprise when it was announced he'd be the one tackling \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" because the absurdity of that story is directly in the title. But what makes even less sense is how good \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" turned out to actually be.<br /><br />Being unfamiliar with Benjamin Walker made any sort of expectations for his performance tilt like a faulty pinball machine. However his supporting cast would prove to be extraordinary. With the likes of Mary Elizabeth Winstead (\\"Scott Pilgrim Vs the World,\\" \\"The Thing\\"), Dominic Cooper (\\"The Devil's Double,\\" \\"Captain America: The First Avenger\\"), Rufus Sewell (\\"Dark City,\\" \\"The Illusionist\\"), Marton Csokas (\\"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" \\"xXx\\"), and a brief appearance by Alan Tudyk (\\"Serenity,\\" \\"3:10 to Yuma\\") this movie was in extremely good hands when it came to actors. Within moments, Walker is able to pull you into his portrayal of Abraham Lincoln as well. It's mostly driven by his thirst for vengeance and him being torn between telling the truth to his soon to be wife Mary Todd (Winstead) and hiding it all from her in an attempt to keep her safe.<br /><br />The movie thrives on unbelievable action sequences. Abe chops down a tree with a single blow early on. He then goes on to catch a blade in his mouth while hanging upside down and slits a vampires throat before bending himself in half and cutting the rope from his feet. There's always this sense of impossibility to nearly every big action sequence in the movie and yet it somehow makes it all a little more entertaining. One of the greatest sequences in the film is this montage of Abe fighting several vampires that heightens with him shoving the face of one into a fire pit and holding it there while Abe uses one of those old fashioned air pumps to make the fire grow. Then the movie switches gears suddenly and Abe is shown nodding off at a picnic with Mary Todd who's a tad upset he's fallen asleep in the first place.<br /><br />Bekmambetov seems to muck up action sequences more often than not. What your brain is able to process is outstanding and is pretty much exactly what your inner action junkie so desperately craves. There were times during things like the horse stampede action sequence and several of the gory vampire slayings where legitimate goosebumps were present. But the rest of the time, you can't really tell just what in the world is going on. The camera zooms in way too frequently, things are flying in the air, vampires are flying left and right, and the train sequence is a real mess if you're really keen on connecting all the dots when it comes to character's actions.<br /><br />Other than not knowing what's going on when the action gets really hot and heavy, \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" is fairly outstanding overall. It's downright ridiculous at times and extremely outrageous through and through, but is unbelievably entertaining from beginning to end. Speaking of the ending, it's bound to ruffle a few feathers. Oddly more historically accurate than expected (except still not so much) and yet so gloriously outlandish, \\"Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter\\" is bloody marvelous.montage of Abe fighting several vampires that heightens with him shoving the face of one into a fire pit and holding it there while Abe uses one of those old fashioned air pumps to make the fire grow.

B007SGM084|2.0|This was the worst sexual book I had ever bought......didn't even finish the 3rd part.  I don't know what is all the buzz about these books and if they make the movie is going to be a flop because whoever read the book is not going to go see it.  It's a shame that the media put so much into something that has no sense the main character in this book is a sick person and I;m very confused because they said that this book is what is in every women's dreams; I don't think so not everybody likes pain and no romance!!!!.  I think this author pay a lot of money for this publicity...I hate when I pay my money for garbage; there are a lot of writers that should get this kind of media; for example Lori Foster, Lora Leigh, cherry Adair and cindy Gerard; they do it for me their books put romance in my bedroom; and is a shame that these writers don't get notice like E L James did with such a poor book writing!!!!.

B005LAIHY0|2.0|I agree that the film looks good, but plot doesn't make much since, aliens seed earth then for no explicable reason aliens want to destroy us.  Then we have the overused plot angle of searching for God and finding our alien fathers. I have been a fan of righteous Science Fiction since a teenager, but it buggers the mind to see great Sci-Fi writers of past ignored who had intelligent and entertaining plots for the same old tiresome mundane stories that Hollywood comes up with.  Coulda, shoulda, woulda, but, alas, same old same old.  What Hollywood cannot do is anything worth a good two to three hours of my time to watch. Oh, please give me another Batman movie, or some other lame comic book super hero Bull!  Never ceases to amaze me what little the world expects from movie producers.<br />As a great Sci-Fi writer once said, \\"99% of it all is crap\\".

B002MQYOFW|5.0|In this book, everything is flawless, literally. Katniss is not going to be your bestie, totally, but this book will!!! The next two books are also gripping, but Mockingjay isn't as fast paced as the rest.
B003PIUBZS|4.0|Spartacus has many of the trappings of a soap opera/soft porn interspersed with violent scenes. The first episodes start poorly with an emphasis on the gore but then settles into a story line with characters you care to follow. Some of the acting is very good the main characters are better but like Star Trek people that you know little about are destined to die.
0307949508|5.0|I can only hope that a movie will be produced based on this book.  The \\"Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" was good, but this is a MUST READ!
0099579936|1.0|I'm listening to this only because a friend gave it to me and I was out of audio books.  I rarely don't finish reading something I've started, but if I make it through this one, it'll be a miracle. The writing is horrible, the characters are pathetic and the story is going nowhere.  I keep hoping that it will get better, but after reading other reviews, I don't think that's going to happen.  What bothers me the most is that there are so many people who think the book is good enough to buy it - I hate to think what that says about the group consciousness of our society!
0345803493|5.0|This book was shipped extremely fast & conveniently! An AMAZING read, this trilogy is the best I have read! The writing itself is not anything magnificent, but the story is definitely one you can easily fall in love with.
0061743526|5.0|I don't know why but I waited a very long time to read this book. I think the film is one of the best ever made, although it never seems to make into the top 10 of any critic's list, but is certainly in my favourite 5. I think it might have been this that prevented me from taking it down from my bookshelf where it has lain unopened for at least 20 years; the fear that it might disappoint and, in some way, diminish my love of the movie and Elmer Bernstein's heartrendingly beautiful score. I need not have worried; if anything it has enhanced my appreciation of it.<br /><br />The book, of course, stands on its own as a sublime evocation of the lost innocence of childhood and it is Lee's great skill that she is able to elicit, through her prose and Scout's narration, a child's truth, which produces a wonderful portrait of, what surely must be, one the great literary creations; Atticus Finch, in all his glory: the father of Scout and her brother Jem, struggling to bring up his children in a time of great hardship, both economic and moral, the latter struggle epitomized by the seemingly endless patience he shows in pointing out to them, in the face of apparently overwhelming evidence to the contrary, that their lives should truly be lived according to the dictum ensconced within the Declaration of Independence: that `all men are created equal'.  Thus we observe the children's growth in understanding of this teaching as they witness the horrible injustice perpetrated by the laws constituted to, among other things, safeguard the rights of all men. This is illustrated, beautifully too, through the, ironical, persecution of Boo Radley and their growing realization that, perhaps, the `boogey man' they have long feared is not their reclusive immediate neighbour but the evil, ignorance and hatred ineradicably woven into the fabric of the everyday lives of all but a few the people they have long taken for granted as representing the norm.<br /><br />When first in print perhaps ithad a great influence, along with the movie and others, such as Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and In the Heat of the Night, on fair minded people in America with regard to questions of race, colour and creed, even while the riots in Detroit and elsewhere were raging - who knows? One thing I do know is that this book is a masterpiece of imaginative writing and will endure for decades to come and beyond when we can only hope that the issues at its core are a distant memory.
B0086700CM|3.0|I couldn't wait for this game to come. But if you have a kindle fire and you want to buy this, don't. Its really hard to control on the kindle fire. when you turn it, it doesn't turn. IT IS VERY HARD, and that is why I just said ok.
0553582038|3.0|I must admit, I completely understand why the fourth book in George R.R. Martin's epic is panned by so many.  The battles and movement of the plot that made the previous books such riveting reading is largely absent here.  The trade off, of course, is character development which we get in spades - a strong case could be made that Martin does too much of one and not enough of the other.  Another accurate criticism is _A Feast for Crows_ does not focus at all on fully half the primary characters in the story.  This is easier to forgive, as Martin explains at the end of the book that \\"the book had become too big to publish in one volume.\\"<br /><br />That said, I am of two minds.  On one hand, I wholly enjoyed the development of Cersei and Jamie's characters - Martin's nuanced understanding of \\"good guys\\" and \\"bad guys\\" has always impressed me.  Similarly it was refreshing to be introduced to new characters in other parts of Westeros; this keeps the story interesting, and expands the narrative.  On the other hand, the plot itself really didn't seem to move that much.  The characters previously introduced did little of significance, and the new characters largely seemed to create chaos.  Martin does leave some cliffhangers and tantalizing clues for the future, but this was not enough for me to give it more than a mediocre review.<br /><br />Of course I will read [[ASIN:B003YL4LYI A Dance with Dragons: A Song of Ice and Fire: Book Five]] - one can hardly not after such an investment in the story and the characters, and I trust that book five will help tie together the loose ends left here and have a quicker pace.  Taken on its own and compared to his previous work, however, _A Feast for Crows_ is lackluster.
0807014273|5.0|This book by Viktor Frankl may appear dated because it was first published in the 1950's, but do not be disallusioned about its timelessness, strength and perspective for all those who want to put their lives in order, realizing that strength from within can be found in ALL situations, by realizing that lifes smallest gifts, realizations, connections, visualizations and observations can put a whole new perspective on one's life and future, while soul searching for the real meaning of life. Has the potential to help get your life back on tract, while realizing the many gifts that daily surround us.

1400069181|2.0|I have nothing against Blake Mycoskie. He seems like a genuinely nice guy, who built a tremendously successful business.<br />But this book was dull. I'm not sure if it was aimed at the tweens and teens who wear Toms because they're trendy at the moment. I have a pair of Toms, I love them, they're comfortable, but even given the one-for-one, they're EXPENSIVE because the quality is so poor. I'm not knocking what the company does. I just think the book could have been a little less feel-good and a lot more in-depth.
0099579936|1.0|I read this book solely because of the hype surrounding it. My, oh my. Where to begin? This has the worst book that I have possibly ever read. The sheer repetitiveness  of the book nearly drove me insane. Firstly, the flushing. Who on God's earth, flushes at the site of a strange man you've never met. She flushes crimson, flushes beetrood red, flushes scarlet. If I didn't know better anymore flushing, she would spontaneously combust. All in all, a ridiculously tedious book, that defines how influencing  viral marketing can be.

Kept skiping to find some sort of real purpose in the story but just doesn't get there and becomes repeticious,  boring ,stupid, totally unintelligrnt & totally juninile as well as pornographic, abusive to self & and others.  The writing shows a deep disrespect for intimacy, for relationships, for even learning. Nothing of good report what so ever. TR<br /><br />Could not finish and would not buy this author again.

B0023SDPS6|2.0|When I saw the first episode of the new series the show was mildly interesting,with several glaring errors such that I was tempted to fire off a letter to A&E taking the writers to task.  I was glad I waited, it wasn't the script writers, it was poor research or just laziness on the part of the author.<br />If you live in a large urban area, want to daydream about living in WY, but would probably hate the reality of it, maybe this is the book for you.<br />As I stated in the title, the best description I can give on the writing is Meh.  Developing a story line slowly is one thing, developing it slowly while generating little interest in the process is completely another.  I'm on my 5th day of trudging through this book, with no optimism that it will get better.<br />Craig Johnson apparently hates firearms.  He cannot introduce a single character that we are supposed to like, without venturing down the guns are evil boulevard.  While concurrently, he associates the NRA or any positive interest in guns to the bad guys, or the general losers he describes that come and visit Wyoming.<br />Well ok, if you feel that way,and want to make the point, even repeatedly, fine.  But at least generate a story based in some amount of reality while you're doing it.  Case in point:  a large part of the plot deals with Longmire searching for a murder weapon in 45-70 caliber.  He's searching for a circa late 1800's Sharp's rifle in that caliber, because 'they don't make any rifles in that caliber that accurate now'.  Really?  I wonder if Johnson spent even 5 minutes with Google doing a little research where he would have quickly learned of his error.  I will cut him some slack on the TV show reference, where 'anyone can order an AR15 off the internet.'  That may indeed have been the scriptwriters being as ignorant as he is.<br />In summary, the writing is slow, and worse, error filled if not downright lazy.  I fully expect to read if anyone is shot with a handgun, that it will be an 8-shot Webley-Fosbery.<br />If you want some enjoyable detective/crime reading based in the modern west, go find a copy of Tony Hillerman's Jim Chee/Sgt. Leaphorn series.  I'm sure you'll be much happier.

B00846REIS|4.0|After reading 50 Shades, I was looking for something similar and stumbled upon this book.  This book was very good and I read it with anticipation of knowing the ending.... BUT I thought it was NO comparison to 50 Shades. I couldn't put the trilogy down and I think I was expecting the same thing with Bared To You. But that didn't happen.  Don't get me wrong,  I enjoyed the book.. I was just comparing Eva and Gideon's relationship to Ana and Grey's. They were so differet and in Bared To You, I felt it was way too repetative. Gideon would mess up and Eva would try and talk about it but they ended up having sex... Again. All the sex scenes are the same and there's WAY too many of them. At least in 50 Shades,  they were growing in their relationship whereas in Bared,  I feel they stayed at the same point with so many ups and downs... And are we ever going to fully understand Gideon's past? That's the golden question!<br /><br />I will still read Deeper In You when it comes out... but I know my loyalties will always lie with Grey!<br />Laters, baby. ;)

B0087240Z4|5.0|Billy Corgan has been dragged through the mud by the press and most notably himself during the past 5 or so years.  His public persona doesn't do much to heal his poor perception with mainstream audiences too but you really have to put that all aside and take an objective stance when giving this album a try.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed!!!<br /><br />Being that this is the first album from the new lineup I couldn't be more pleased with the outcome.  Not every track is a winner for me but there is zero filler on the album either.  The swirling guitars of Billy and Jeff compliment each other so well that (dare I say) you soon enough won't be asking yourself \\"where's James?\\".  And the bass...forget it.  Nicole is sooooo far superior in what she brings to this album than any previous SP bassist.  It really is that big of an impact, the bass lines don't just fade into the background, they are a serious driving force in the majority of the songs.<br /><br />I'm no music expert so I can't speak to the structure of the songs, melodies, chorus, bridge, etc.  I'm just a fan who appreciates good music when I hear it.  I've been a fan of the pumpkins since I was 13 in '93 but I've been so let down by the band's output since Billy regrouped in '07.  Not anymore!  Oceania brings back the whimsical melodies, emotion and rocking undertones that first got the hooks of the band into me nearly 20 years ago. This album has been playing nearly every minute of my free time.  I haven't been that into any music in a very long time. The highlights for me seem to change with each listen as you notice little things each time but consistent favorites include:  Panopticon, Pinwheels, The Chimera and Inkless.<br /><br />So again, don't let the past cloud your judgement \\"this isn't the real smashing pumpkins\\" garbage is no longer valid.  This lineup is the Smashing Pumpkins and if Oceania is a taste of things to come then sign me up!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is the best it is so awesome and it is  so fun!! And all the people who put bad reviews your contraption is messed up I just got it today for free and it works perfectly!
B007D2XSW0|2.0|does not work on Stood Charge. it is a big disappointment. would give better rating if it worked. But an app that does not work is useless. test it out before you release it.

B0086700CM|5.0|This game is an eye-hand coordination game. It gives a great challenge. The controls are simple (tilting and finger swipes). It is great for kids and adults.

B0086700CM|5.0|great game!  fun and challenging but simple to play.  you will enjoy it...while it will frustrate you as well.  keep your eyes open and react quick!
0307594165|4.0|This review is not so much about the contents of the novel, but a comment on the design: the look and feel of the book itself. Thank you to Knopf for issuing such a quality edition, even though the price is similar to books more cheaply produced.<br /><br />Thinking about whether to buy this in hard cover, paperback (when it becomes available), or on a reading device? Get it in hard cover. The typeface is elegant, the paper is quality, the cover has a lovely sheen and that tree with birds graphic on the front is embossed. A very nice-looking and nice-feeling book.<br /><br />Yes, the story is beautifully told, heartbreaking, and redeeming in the end, like most of Morrison's novels. I'm just glad that a writer of such quality also gets a book to match.<br /><br />(No, I don't work for the publisher or a book distributor. Normally I don't even notice these things. This book is so nicely made that the quality just jumps out at you.)
B0061TQBRK|5.0|I never listened to Lacuna Coil before and so this was my first album. Let me just say that I thoroughly loved it! Cristina's and Andrea's voices are perfect with each other and the guitar rhythms are fast-paced, aggressive, and heavy. The whole album is exceedingly listenable and each track is amazing! I particularly love the songs \\"Kill the Light\\" and \\"Upsidedown\\". I do think that if you are a first-time listener that perhaps you should listen to the band's older material first to get a taste of what this band is like because I don't think it is fair to just listen to the band's latest album and form an opinion of what they can do just based upon their newest album (like I did). It's still a great album and I would include it on my list of albums to take with me should I ever be stranded on a desert island.
0345803493|5.0|Book picks up right where the first one ends. Author creates drama and suspense but solves it in one paragraph. Wished she would draw out a suspenseful scene, make it last longer. It would have been a more well rounded book.

B007D2XSW0|5.0|This is the absolute best photo editing application for Android.  it gives you features similar to instagram but with much more control.  I have tried almost all of the photo editing apps and this is the most powerful that I've found.  well worth the price.  I can't believe I never knew about until I got free from Amazon.
B0086700CM|5.0|i think it is a pretty cool game for it to be free and this game is like addictive i cant stop playing it!!!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Love it! Plenty of ways to edit my pictures. Thank you for putting such an awesome app on free app of the day. It will be put to good use. Works flawlessly on a Razr Maxx.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|great app! works great with the Kindle Fire! absolutely love it!(: awesome effects to add to your pictures! 5 stars!(:
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app is great. Super easy to use. I find editing photos is far easier on my phone than on my pc. I tried instagram for a little while but prefer the interface on this app.  Plus I hate the way instagram crops photos. I can crop with this app but can also leave my pictures as they are.  The thumbnail previews for filters are awesome and made me make several choices that I wouldn't have normally considered. Plus the more I play with this app the more features I find tucked away that just keep making it better and better.

B005LAIGN2|4.0|I purchased the product because I had seen the movie Tuskeegee Airmen and desired to see a little more of the action that these heroic men engaged in. The movie was very well done, even with the mockups it was a great experience. Seldom have we seen movies about the great things that men of this caliber (White, Black, Brown, Red etc.)have accomplished. The anglo saxon has always seemed to think they are superior in all ways which is sheer stupidity!<br />A great THANK YOU and a hearty well Done goes out to those men. As a Veteran myself I can appreciate a little of what those men went through.

0984999302|5.0|This is a must read. It's very well thought-out and thorough. The ideas are novel. And it's entertaining. It will also save you time and money from going too far with an idea before it has been validated by the customers.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|they listened and fixed everything! great app please get, thanks! this is one of the best (if not the best) editing app I have just got and is really easy to use!

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|just pay attention the game explains itself to you. good game for kids. easy to follow along. it does start out a little slow.
B0086700CM|5.0|You may be thinking to yourself why is this game rated 5 stars? Well this is simple! This game is for people of ALL ages!!!!! For young children there is nothing scary about this wonderful game.It is not very hard to learn what to do and how to play game! I give this games 2 thumbs up! Give it a try!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple Run is a very fun and simple game. All you have to do is run from shadow demoms. The main control is your finger. This game is very good as a time passer and even kids can play. There are many power ups and unlockable characters. I love this game. :-)
6305428425|5.0|If you like Lisa in anything else.. GET THIS! She's a great actress. The two main characters Romy and Michelle are very \\"dumb blonde\\". The things they say are so over the top, that you can't help to just laugh. Buy this awesome movie!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book. I borrowed the first one from my friend and when I finished, I couldn't wait to get the second one from her so I went on Amazon and bought the digital version. In just minutes, I downloaded it for my Kindle App on my Ipod touch and was reading it practically instantly. I love to have real books in my hand but the convenience of getting the digital copy is also appealing and serves a purpose. The book was amazing and I'm now reading the third, anxious to find out what happens in the end. I would recommend anyone to read this story from first to last.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app is great for me when it comes to editing photos. I have yet to find a better picture editing app! Quite the steal for the Free App A Day section, however, I believe that normally it is a tad overpriced.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|it's the short story \\"The Lottery\\"  extended to book length with dozens of victims.  Give the chosen a few weapons to defeat the others until only one is left. It is aimed at young adults and will probably please them with easy vocabulary and simple choices.
B004SBX112|1.0|I have to re-register with Amazon.com every time I want to play the game - which automatically sets up a new device on my account and causes other apps to fail.  I paid for this app!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I use it in church all the time. Very convenient!! I really like all of the Bible plans that are available.
B0013FSL3E|3.0|I have to say that, honestly, I do not think that this one is quite all that. It is a nice, heartwarming film, and an impressive feat of creating a feature-length presentation out of a little robot. However, I would never imagine ranking this among the great animated films of all time, which is what I keep seeing other people doing. The human scenes felt a bit visually incongruous (relative to the robot-focused bulk of it) to me, for whatever that is worth. I think that Wall-E is definitely worth a watch, but not five stars.
B0063GORYU|4.0|This is worse than a drug addiction because it's legal. Really, folks. I play whenever I have a minute and it stretches to an hour of unproductive time.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Fun app with tons off games. Really want to get more points without the free options because I can't do it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game. It's very fun to play with friends and or family. I would recommend this app for people that like to guess drawings. Very cool app, so if you like to draw and guess, go ahead and buy this app!!!!!!!

B00164EAC8|1.0|If this were a Jurassic Park installment, it would be considered the worst one but an average entertainment. As a GODZILLA movie, it is a disappointment as large as a GODZILLA turd. I wish they had've titled it FRAUDZILLA and turned it into a comedy, which would've given it a little merit. Anyone who has no clue about this film, I want to ask you: would you ever confuse the words soulless, lifeless, and lack-of-personality when describing the original KING OF ALL MONSTERS? No? I didn't think so. And that is what this godzilla is. And to top it all off, if I remember correctly, there were a bunch of littler lizards running around somewhere in the 2nd half - what was that all about? The producers and director should be shot just for enforcing the GODZILLA name - Who the F ok'd that move anyway? Sad when you think of it. Really sad when you think of the potential a big-budgeted GODZILLA movie could've been if the vision &amp; intent were more in line with what true fans want. What I would like to see? Someone with real, creative, directorial talent take up the reigns of Toho's monster repertoire and have a go at it - maybe produced by Tim Burton, in conjunction with Magnolia Pictures, and have it maybe directed by Joon-ho Bong, the successful director of The Host (2006). I realize he is South Korean, but, I think he would have a good handle on a modern realization of Godzilla, and with Tim Burton's support behind him (a huge GODZILLA fan growing up), together, they could produce a damn interesting film, if borrowing the best of both worlds, of old school retro with new school production values.

B00169N0BK|4.0|I got this device quite some time ago, but was reluctant to review it because I couldn't get it to work. The monitor calibration was easy enough. But the main thing I wanted it for, the printer profiles, well, I just could not seem to get it to work. Whether it was Windows, or the printers I was using, I don't know. I tried all the suggestions from the developers, no luck.<br /><br />Well, recently I switched from Windows to Mac, and I also had a new printer. Once again, I needed to have a printer profile setup. I wanted to print scrapbook pages, and good color reproduction really is important to me. So I figured, let's give this baby another try. And wouldn't you know, this time it worked! I almost fell over when I saw the little indicators light up with a success! Fingers crossed I worked my way through and soon had a finished profile for my printer and paper.<br /><br />And it sure does make the difference. My finished printout looks very nice, considering it's not a super high-end photo printer, it got all the quality out that it could and I am so happy with the results. When doing 12x12 printouts, having to get it right the first time is really important or the cost goes up really quickly!<br /><br />So can't go with 5-stars with all the problems I had getting this to work, but very happy now that it does. The zipper on it also broke when I went to put it away, I wish they just used velcro to fasten it, as zippers always have a limited life span it seems.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I looked at this trilogy several times before deciding to buy and glad I did.  Yes, there is the erotica, S&M stuff going on in these books, but there is also a great story found within the covers of the trilogy.  Glad I purchased!  I truly believe you have to read all 3 to really appreciate this story of Christian and Ana.  Loved it!!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I saw all the negative reviews so I had to try it for myself. For what the masses think is a negative, I think its a positive. The features are fitting for a smartphone and there are always other applications that make up for what PicShop lacks and vice versa. For the most part, 5 dollars is a bit steep but my donation is clearly to support. Thanks for another brilliant application.
B0052UZIFA|3.0|This is a decent port of the game, but it's missing a few features. To be honest, the only one I miss is &quot;endless mode,&quot; though.
B003FNLZ62|5.0|Book is in pretty good condition and I was please to get it in the mail, I actually had forgotten that I ordered it seems it took a long time to arrive- worth the wait. I have read it already and will now pass it to someone else.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|it is a pretty good photo editor but I'm glad itbwas free today because I would not have been happy to pay over 99 cents.
0385360169|1.0|I am yet another sucker who bought this book after I heard people raving about it. I pre ordered all 3 so I will stick with it & read Darker & Freed when they arrive.<br />I'm neither a prude nor a feminist but come on. Sex scenes in a no brainer romance novel are great, but not when they involve assault & battery and treating a woman like she's a second class citizen. Having sex 5 times a day & orgasms on tap is perfect for a simple romance book but punishment by beating for the other's \\"pleasure\\" is totally degrading.<br />This could have been an easy read romance book to relax with on a cold winter's night but it was just a little perverted for my tastes. I hope Ana can relax Christian & help him sort out his obvious psychological issues in Darker & Freed.<br />On a positive note, Becca Battoe narrated beautifully, with emotion and enthusiasm.
B00076ZZ9I|1.0|I, like many other reviewers, bought the dualdisc version for the enhanced audio, expecting 24bit/96khz or 24bit/192khz DVD-A format. This disc does not contain that. It does not contain any dvd audio at all, only the DVD-Video content, for which the audio track is 16bit/48khz.    A true DVD-A disk has content in the AUDIO_TS folder on the dvd when you explore the folder structure on your pc. This disc has an empty audio_ts folder, just like any other DVD-Video disk would have.    Sony is misleading in the advertising of their dualdisc. It NOT a dualdisc, it is simply a cd/dvd double sided disc.  Apparently sony does this for all their \\"dualdiscs\\"    [...]
B00005ASHM|2.0|I thought this was going to take me back to the hey-day of the group, but it didnt. The only tracks that I loved were the ones I already owned in the beach boys best songs cds. I found this album an attempt to recapture what they had, and in my humble opinion, its a dismal bust. The new stuff was dreary, melodramatic, and overwrought. No rythm, no purpose, just cry in my beer stuff that left me wondering why in the world I ever bought this to begin with. but i do know why!  I wanted that past. sadly, the past is gone.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I own quite a few knives and must say that for the money, the Ka-Bar BK2 Campanion fixed blade knife is amongst the top in terms of quality and design. Its also a great camping knife and will serve well when required to chop and baton wood for the camp fire. Hence, the weight and geometry design of this knfe best serves these purposes. Apart from praising the knife itself, the kydex sheath that came with the knife is horrible and am sure other reviews will tell you about this in detail, so I will not go through the same in my review. However, I do suggest that you place a separate order with the many fine handmade sheath makers out there. In my case, I went with a custom handmade leather sheath maker and it compliments the knife really well. On a whole this is a well thought out knife from Ka-Bar and Mr. Ethan Becker and do believe they have a winner here.

B002QE3CTY|5.0|an amazing teen book that is as good as the hunger games. This book has everything!i completely love dasher!thank you
B0059XTTW8|2.0|I'll tell you why I say it's tedious. There is no attention to characterisation whatsoever. We are given no clues as to the motivations of the characters. They just go about doing mysterious 'stuff'. Colin Firth gets in a whole sentance explaining why he went over to the russians. It's just a pity the sentance is banal.<br /><br />Because the characterisation is missing, the movie is an endless parade of events happening to people we know nothing about and care about less. The plot is built up slowly and it requires intelligence to watch and decypher; that doesn't make it an intelligent film - just one in which the plot has been finely chopped. I'd rather join the dots in a children's play book.<br /><br />I gave it one star for the faithful recreation of the 70s, another for the photography.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wish there was an option for 0 stars.  This book was poorly written, juvenile and downright boring.  I made it 1/3 through the book when I decided that I just couldn't take it anymore.  I wish there was a money-back guarantee on kindle books that you can't bring yourself to finish.  I had heard so many women talking about how wonderful this book was that I really considered buying the trilogy sight unseen. Thank goodness I balked at the price.  Basically, this book is about a college graduate who meets a 'hot' billionaire for coffee one time and decides although he is aloof and less than polite, she wants to sign a legal document to become his slave in all things (not just the bedroom).  She is told up front in the legal document that she must do everything he asks, eat everything he asks, wear anything he requests, exercise all week, keep herself shaved and properly groomed at all times, be at his beck and call and accept any and all forms of punishment no matter what his reasons.  She wants to do all this after 1 coffee and for 1 and only 1 reason--- he is hot!!  It is laughable and unbelievable. I only hope that there aren't really educated girls out there that would want to sign away all the rights their grandmothers fought so hard for just so they can get attention from someone who is hot.; someone who won't even let them look in his eyes.  To me, it was offensive.  I am no prude. If this book was just hot, raunchy sex scenes I would have continued reading happily (despite the juvenile writing) but the premise itself  was disturbing.  I am no man's slave. I do what I want, when I want, and for my own reasons.  That someone would even consider willingly signing away all their rights shows a disturbing lack of character and self esteem.  As for the gals who recommended this book, I now see them in a whole new way and literally feel sorry for them; if this is a fantasy of theirs, they have serious issues.
030758836X|5.0|I would write a longer recommendation, but I can't put the book down long enough to do so. It's incredible. I think I know \\"who done it\\". Now off to download more of Gillian Flynn's works before I get back to the book.

B005NFJAZS|5.0|What a treat!  No-one can be better than Robert Preston, Shirley Jones and little Ronnie Howard.  I mistakenly purchased a remake with Matthew Broderick and Kristen Chenowich, who are fine actors/muscians and whom I love in other things, but the original cast and production are so exceptional that they can't be beat!
0525478817|5.0|Before I review this book, I have to give you a bit of background on myself so you know where I'm coming from.<br />  I'm a fifteen year old teenage girl residing in the United States. I am an avid reader and am very passionate about the community involving John Green, but that was before I read this book.<br />  My first John Green novel was \\"Looking For Alaska\\", which I enjoyed greatly, so I decided to give his newest novel a go.<br />I have never cried harder after reading a book. This book, unlike most novels geared towards teenagers (although I have had adults read it, who all return the book red-eyed and sobbing) this book is filled with metaphors and hidden meanings. I've read this book six times cover-to-cover and unveil something new each time. The plot is beautiful, yet cheesy, and expresses the true feel of humanity, how people that with cancer are glorified, when really they are like everyone else.<br />  The characters in this novel are dynamic and wonderful and are very easy to attach to. Hazel, a sixteen year old girl living in Indianapolis, has has a thyroid with stage 4 mets in her lungs, a drug called Phalanxifor keeps her alive. A seventeen year old boy named Augustus is her opposite, he had a touch of osteosarcoma a year and a half ago, and he's riding on a roller coaster that only goes up. I loved these characters, from Hazel being a strong, well-developed character (unlike some other novels geared toward teens- ahem- Twilight) that is a perfect representation to what this book shows. Her character displays a normal teenage girl, just like any other, but with a touch of cancer.  Augustus is just a massive symbol for about anything, and his character can turn your views inside out. His enthusiasm and depth amaze me as a fictional (although i wish he wasn't) character.<br />  A local girl in my area has had leukemia for 6 years. The community rallies around her and gifts her things, praises her, I wouldn't be surprised if someone had a shrine for her. After reading this book, I feel as though I can meet her eye-to-eye. After talking with her, it emphasized the meaning of the book; we're all the same, even when we're sick. She was just like me, in every way, but just with a touch of cancer.<br />  This incredible novel made me think and feel things in a way I never thought I would have. If this is your first Green novel, please, dear god, read his others and let them change you the same way that they have changed me.<br />Thank you for reading<br />~Sydney.her. After reading this book, I feel as though I can meet her eye-to-eye. After talking with her, it emphasized the meaning of the book; we're all the same, even when we're sick. She was just like me, in every way, but just with a touch of cancer.<br />  This incredible novel made me think and feel things in a way I never thought I would have. If this is your first Green novel, please, dear god, read his others and let them change you the same way that they have changed me.<br />Thank you for reading<br />~Sydney.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|You can tell that the people who submitted negative (1-3 star) reviews of this album that just came out YESTERDAY only listened to it once, didn't get it, and decided to announce to the world their deeply informed judgment that it sucks or is \\"underwhelming.\\" This is not an album that reveals itself on the first couple of listens, but you can tell, if you have an imagination and an open mind (like me, of course!), that there is \\"something\\" here, even if you can't put your finger on it at first.<br /><br />On my first listen, I was happily intrigued. It seemed pretty minimal and nothing really caught my ear. The first track that caught my attention just a little was track 4, \\"Jonathan.\\" On my second listen (and I mean really listening, sitting down in front of the stereo and giving the music my full attention) I started to see that this was like getting a new Bowie album in the seventies: imagine going from Diamond Dogs to Young Americans to Station to Station. Of course you weren't going to get it the first time around! Maybe not until the fourth or fifth serious listen would you begin to appreciate the brilliance and originality. That is how I feel about this new Fiona Apple album. I've listened to about ten times since yesterday (okay, six of them were on my flac player while doing yardwork). I love it. It's great. It has depths and hooks and fantastic drumming. Check her out on Jimmy Fallon's show the other night (June 20, 2012?). Wish I could see her live. Hope she makes it through the tour without a meltdown. A true genius songwriter, lyricist, and performer. Don't write it off until you've given it at least six tries. It's worth it. And you don't need to own an iPhone to enjoy it, unlike that last Bjork album.
0763644765|5.0|I got this book and the PRI 4-in-1 toilet trainer and step stool. My 19 month old son was afraid of sitting on the regular size toilet so I thought something more to his scale would work better. He went potty using this book and the little toilet after two tries! He absolutely LOVES this book. He will imitate the faces the little guy in the book makes. I think it explains going to the potty really well. Its simple and minimal graphics actually help get the point across. I'm going to get the author's other books. She's brilliant.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love playing this game on my sister's ipod and I was dissapointed when they didn't have it in the appstore  then all of a sudden it was in the appstore it was free so I was happy about that I like it better on the kindle than I do on the ipod because the screen is way bigger

B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game. I like it better than most games I have gotten. I don't have to buy anything. I simply just deal with the stuff I have earned.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever!I always. loved this game on my ipod but I never got to play it on my kindle fire till now.p.s.Everyone who put 1,2or 3 are haters
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great book, it has a slow start but when it gets started you won't want to put it down!! You'll be in love with the main character and all fifty shades of him!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|on DROID Bionic! Thanks for FAOTD! Does what it claims to do. Can save enhanced pic to phone memory! Terrific app!
B007I1TFK0|1.0|the remastering of the sound tract leaves a lot to be desired. the loudness level fluctuates- in some places very low. the sound quality is not much better. the disc was played on sony es equipment and klipsch reference speakers. overall a bad sound tract
B0054JZC6E|4.0|my sister and I both play this on our kindles and enjoy it. the ads are a bit much, but not the worst I'ge seen. the game prices rise faster than thebprizes though.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|A very intriguing and immersive world. One of the most entertaining books I've read in a while at a great price. One gripe I had with the kindle version was the occasional grammatical errors. Can't wait for the next book to come out!!
B005FUTBWS|4.0|Someone recommended this movie to me and I had no idea what it was.  I thought it was going to be a documentary, but was surprised to find that it was more an indie horror/thriller picture.<br /><br />**Some Spoilers**<br /><br />Three teen boys answer a craigslist type sex ad to get it on with what turns out to be a much older woman.  The woman gives them a couple beers each which turn out to be laced with the date rape drug - roofies.  When they wake up from the haze much later, one is tied up in a cage, another plastic wrapped to a cross and a couple others are locked in a basement in a fundamentalist church.<br /><br />I won't tell you what happens, but they are captured by a really sinister and destructive church.  Some feel they were mirrored off of the equally vile church group out there in real life called the Westboro Church in Kansas.  Although that church is mentioned in the movie, this church is supposedly ten times worse if that's even possible.  They take it upon themselves to commit crimes and use the reasoning as \\"they're doing God's work.\\"<br /><br />The movie is a borderline horror and it is exploitive, but in a necessary way.  I didn't give it 5 stars as the last 15-30 minutes took it in a direction that became outlandish.  The pay off wasn't worth it and no one really wins except for the John Goodman character who takes a team of agents and officers to break into the church in an all out shoot out.
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Repeat rooms, objects and characters.  There is no zoom, but I never needed it really. The hint bar fills up quickly, most objects are fairly well hidden, and the dialogue isn't tedious and overly time consuming. It's well worth $1.49.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Cherub nice edits. So you have to use another program most likely to save to your favorite photo site. Big deal. one of the best one day free apps ever offered by Amazon. Jump on this deal. Remember you are getting free upgrades as this software gets better and better.
0446572993|5.0|As usual, David Baldacci has written a very entertaining book.  I am tempted to read the end, but shall refrain!
B0086700CM|5.0|love it but it should have check points so that u should'nt have to start all over ......just saying mannnnn
0525425764|5.0|This kept my attention and I enjoyed the book very much.<br />John Grisham never lets his readers down with his stories.<br />I highly recommend the book AND this author.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Have enjoyed playing this game.  The designs on the tiles are easy to see.  The game is challenging and entertaining.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|I use this program a lot to edit up portraits and to fix up pictures of my self when something happened during the shooting.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|its simply awesome. plenty of levels, variety, challenging, fun, unlockables, etc. give it a shot. you wont be disappointed. hope they produce other fun and interesting games.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|For starters I had some doubts when it said &quot;Not compatible with the LG Optimis Picshop&quot; because it wasn't made clear why there was a version just for that phone, nor why the two aren't compatible with each other. But I figured it's a free app so no harm done if it's bad.<br />Well apparently when editing photos it converts them into this horribly low format, and if you save to your devices internal memory then it over-writes the original file.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app is great especially cause its free today I love how many things you can do and the stickers are hilarious great app!
0307719219|1.0|Well, the guys have an idea (I don't even say it's a theory).<br />And all they did was to find some examples from history to support their 'idea'.<br /><br />In science, when you come up with a new 'idea' you present your findings with some caution. But these guys, on the other hand, insist that they are rigt, their idea is a 'fact'. 2x2=4 and this is it!<br /><br />No. Finding 5-10 even millions of supporting ideas in thousands of years of history does not necessarily make you 'Mr. Right'. No matter what you think, or believe you can easily find thousands, even billions of examples in the history. That's not how the science works.<br /><br />The idea is good, and well deserves some appreciation but it certainly requires some more scientific research.<br />They leapt out of the bathtub too early and ran through the streets naked and proclaimed 'EUREKA!' 'EUREKA!'.
B000PKX2KA|1.0|Bought this product to use with a navigational program.  Mac GPS NavX.  Could not get the product to install or function correctly.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this everyday! I think I would be lost without this app! I love evernote!  I have told everyone I know about the power of evernote!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was my favorite of the trilogy!  I was sad when I finished, I missed reading about Christian.  If it had to end though, this was the perfect way to do it.
1439127700|4.0|I love the history that is written in this book, gives you a unique look into how sitting presidents worked with ex-presidents to tackle world issues.  Unfortunately, as you read it you will find that the liberal presidents were very genuine, thoughtful, magnanimous people and the conservatives were calculating, dishonest, and power hungry often putting their needs above the country's, including our war in Vietnam.  That is difficult to swallow, wish they would have chosen to tell both sides or just leave politics out of it and report the facts as they happened.  I am a liberal and it was even hard for me to believe how the author depicted Nixon as manipulating the country into his presidency.  Put all that aside and there are some great stories in the book and you are sure to learn something you did not already know.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Its easy to use and manage a great tool for keeping important information and ideas. You can list store locate information with ease. Love it!
0307592731|3.0|Wild is more of a `chic book' than one about the PCT. It has a `Brysonesque' flavor to it. Granted that her PCT experience was `ground zero' for her self-psychoanalysis, but she, like Bill Bryson, never came close to hiking their respective National Scenic Trail. Cheryl `strayed around' a limited portion of the PCT or hitched on roads that paralleled the Trail. She never actually hiked the three most spectacular areas of the Trail, i.e. the desert section in southern California, the High Sierra and the Washington Cascades. Instead this book is a belated `it's all about me' documentary of her tribulations that for the most part ignored the Trail itself. To her credit, the last couple of chapters more thoroughly engage the people she met on the PCT.<br /> If you are looking for an `Oprah kind of read' this is the book for you, but Wild is not a strong adventure travel story.<br /><br />Follow-up - October 2014 - I listened to Wild on Books on tape. I do admit that Cheryl finally 'got it', i.e. she eventually captures the nature of a true thru hiker's perspective in her book. Still the subject matter has little to do with the PCT and I am not convinced at the end that she has 'found' herself.
1594135851|4.0|Two of my kids have read the series, one loved it and one thought it mediocre.  Purchased all three in the series so I can read it sometime.  Way better than the three-month wait list at the library.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Take about amazing app! If I would have known Kt existed before, I would have paid for it! Amazing app; allows you to edit just about anything on a picture! I certainly recommend it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|At first I was not going to buy the second book. I just figured it would be the same thing over and over again. But as soon as I got to the end of this one, I HAD to buy the rest of the series!!! Great books!!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|its a cool ap to have. it has almost everything you need for editing you photos. the only thing missing is more kinds of fonts.
0393088774|5.0|This book does a phenomenal job of breaking down the solutions to the crisis. While I have an exhaustive academic and professional background in business, the book is written such that the layperson could quite easily digest the material. As the nation continues to debate the merits of multiple solutions, lost in the shuffle is the fact that it is all a stems from a lack of demand both globally and domestically. While conservatives will all but certainly continue along the path of willful ignorance and refuse to read a Krugman book, for those who want to explore the crisis from an economists perspective rather than a storytellers (Too Big to Fail; End of Wall Street; Big Short, etc.), this book delivers.
B0086700CM|5.0|its on kindle fire its awesome I have been waiting for it 1000000 stars for temple run. I love this game have it on ipaf
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I have had this for a month. Works great. I leave my webcam on at home and review my house from my kindle or cell when I am at work. The only issue was, my home computer runs XP. I could not get sound which I wanted as I am monitoring a new dog addition to the family. It was a pretty easy fix though. I ran a patch wire from audio out to audio in. Sound works on Vista and windows seven
B003L77GG0|5.0|Smallville is a great season, and I just hate to see it come to an end!  The item arrived in the condition that it was described.
B0086700CM|3.0|the game is fun but sometimes when you try to jump it doesn't work and you die. that aggrevates me. a lot. but the rest of the app is fine:-{D
B007D2XSW0|4.0|solid performance so far.  It's got a good range of tools and a smooth interface.  It would be nice to save to Flickr or google +.
B004W25KKW|4.0|Great read, some excellent points and as usual, Einstein applying methods that will make one think and grow. A book to read more than once as it can contain principles that need revisiting. Enjoy it.
B000B6CODO|5.0|My daughter saw this on cable at a friend's house and wanted to get this movie.  She loves it.  This is a great family movie and we watch it on family night.  Fun, Fun, Fun!
0345803485|2.0|Every female at my work is reading and in love with this book so I decided to give it a try. The male character is so unbelievable.... Handsome, billionaire, talented musician, pilot, ohh also an amazing lover who can make the female character orgasm by looking at her. With all that I still wouldn't be able to look past this guy being a total jealous, possessive stalking ASS!!<br /><br />The female character and her \\"subconsious\\" and \\"inner goddess are also totally annoying.<br /><br />I just don't get why everyone is obsessed with this book!!??
B0086700CM|5.0|It's really fun and you don't get bored of it like you do with a regular app. and it's free to boot!
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|When I first started reading the book, I thought it was going to be different and be more about the era of WWII but it didn't and I was a little disappointed. I did get into the lives of characters and continue reading. It was fast paced and very involved writing. I was mad with the ending but I could tell the writer did his research with the different characters, settings and so forth.
B007D2XSW0|2.0|Try it because it was free. Found it difficult to control some of the tools. could be good, but needs work.
B006M4F67A|4.0|This is a nice tileset and the game implementation is good. The only thing I don't care for is that I can't turn offthe music. The game is worth a reommendation though.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Wow... I don't understand the bad reviews. I have a Kindle Fire and this app works great with the pics from my gallery.  Plus it's easy to use.  Ignore the other reviews and get this app!
0385344228|2.0|Oh the disappointment that is Defending Jacob. Some clever writing, but poorly plotted and the story just did not grab me. Maybe I have read too many great crime/courtroom stories, but I struggled to finish this one.<br /><br />Shaking the dust of my nook in preparation for my next great read.
030758836X|5.0|I have loved the past works of Gillian Flynn so looked forward to the release of Gone Girl. In fact, I've anticipated reading this book for weeks and have to say, I was NOT disappointed. Perhaps her best novel to date...this is a great blend of suspense, psychological thriller and plain old-fashioned mystery all rolled into one. The characters are believable and not always likeable, this is one of those reads you cannot wait to pick up each time you have a spare moment. Kudos to Ms. Flynn. She continues to be an author worthy of the title.
1451627289|4.0|I love Stephen King, so I can't really be objective. This is a wonderful premise and an ingenious plot device, but there DOES seem to be a lot of expository verbiage here. The story could have been well told in 500 pages as opposed to 800.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Picked this book up on a whim, but am very glad I did. The author surprised me with his skill! The world is captivating and the characters are all believable. I thought the story to be original and it kept me in suspense. I flew through all the books because I wanted to read just one more chapter. I highly recommend this book!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I thought that every thing in the kindle fire app store was going to work with the fire so am I missing something or is amazon stupid. thanks for a free app that I CANT use and that's the only reason why it is getting 1 star.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Nothing fancy just good protection for your Fire.  The Fire fits perfectly and it holds the Fire in place in an upright position without slipping.  If you want something with a cozy feel this isn't for you-get leather.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this app is awesome if you want to shape up or change around a picture i love pictures and if you do to then this is the app for you!!!!!!!
B007P6VLRS|4.0|If you're looking for the Jimmy pure sound, it's not hear, but the speed and tempo is.<br />the opening lyrics to Quasar are worth the purchase. If you're a long time pumpkins fan there is no reason to not own this disc. If you own little to no pumpkins start with Gish, Siamese Dream, and Adore, then go to Machina, THEN get this one.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|amazing qualities in this app. you just have to get it. I am serious. it is soo fun to make your dog look purple
B007SGM084|5.0|The books are actually quite interesting....racy but certainly not pornographic - would recommend-read with an open mind and you'll discover a most interesting character in young Mr Grey
B00884GR0W|5.0|I love this game. The only parts I dislike was only getting one skillpoint per lvl. This should change to 3or 5 points pet lvl. Also when you die you should keep at least half your exp. Finally you should add a item guide for finding where to get items find items at too.
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I don't think a better actor could have been picked to play this role.  I think Robert continues a great performance in Game of Shadows and the continous of the plot was right on.  The combination of Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law still carries the film from beginning to end.  This was well done and I would love to see more.
B005L38QK2|1.0|I know 3 people other than me that have had this happened to them... it just stops working... yeah just like that the mouse dies... And the cause is non other than the crappy usb steelseries put on their products. Save yourselves the trouble and look elsewhere for a gaming mouse.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Droid Razr. Works perfectly. I was able to open a file directly from my gallery. I was able to play around with the pic and then save it right back to the phone. It works with no problems. I'm thinking the negative reviews are mostly operator error. I would certainly download it and give it a try.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this puts a lot of motion to your mind (: I enjoy this &amp; so does the young ones. I love it
B007URVZJ6|3.0|This looks a valuable resource but if it's a 'how to' book that you need by your elbow when you are formatting, surely we should be able to print it out. Please make it downloadable, Amazon!
B0086700CM|4.0|but ive had it for 4months and today the right side of the game was all wiggley looking so I couldn't raven see that part of the screen so I have to redownload the game :(
B005LAII08|5.0|A delightful, brilliant and charming film! Pixar has created an amazing story that grabs the attention of children immediately and keeps them entertained throughout. The characters are Stunning as they give a breathtaking performance and will have the young ones laughing out loud. Wonderful, unforgettable animation with a creative story as the film portrays the trials-and-tribulations of stepping into adulthood, not an easy task for most. A fun-filled adventure, enjoyable for the entire family. Highly Recommended!
B003TOPQI0|5.0|I have seen this couple of times and it's so funny, I had to buy my own copy. Think broken-down trailers, Gypsy Travelers, squeaky dog, Dennis Farina, the diamond trade and Hasidic Jews. Plus you get Brad Pitt sans shirt speaking some gnarly language (You may want to use close-caption) and bare-knuckle boxing. Lots of foul language so it's not for the little ones. But adults will laugh out loud many times.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|Nice that it was free today,  but it wouldn't load so I had to uninstall it.  Maybe this will be fixed in a future version?  Droid Incredible.
B004Y1WCDE|5.0|app is stable and works great.  My HP Touchpad running ICS has no trouble running it.  make sure you have a plex media server.  Doesn't work without one.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|App will not open on my droid incredible. Glad I got this as free app of day or I would be very mad. Not worth $5. I would rate zero if I could.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|it ids so fun me and my friend can do it together so we do not get bord. so it is super super super super fun
B007D2XSW0|5.0|i made this room and a dude in it and photoshoped it to look like a ghost and everyone thought it was a ghost lol,i like how u can post it on facebook and tweet it and stuff
B000FCKIFU|5.0|another great novel with the camels.  great author with many great novels.  this is just one of many.  can hardly wait to start the next.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i have a hard time trying to find time to read the bible untill i found this app...so now i just listen to the Bible  all daylong .. pretty satisfied
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book is a great read. It is a bit shocking to those of us who have never been into the whole bondage thing. Still a good story with crazy sexual fantasies being played out.
0307463745|1.0|Jason Fried totally misunderstands what makes the best products, managers, visionaries in business - great. As a former user of his company's products I was relieved that at least this book finally explained to me why the products were so incredibly un-innovative and underpowered. There is a good focus on simplicity with them, but their myopic obsession with simplicity made them suck. Just like this book.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|This is a totally awesome CD.  The music is very moving and Sixx AM is the best group ever! Excellent accompaniment to the book which is also awesome.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|good free app! works well on my kindle fire. I use it to figure bills and what not. if all you need is a calculator.then it's a good one!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This is great! But you will need a higher end device to work it right. So have at it while it's free.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It's fun, funny and heartwarming. Must read for anyone who plays video games, and even if you don't you could do a lot worse than spending a few hours in the world of Ready Player One.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|love it! Works well on my Android RAZR. fun to modify and tweek pictures. I still like the pre- installed app on the phone too though.
B007JWKLMO|5.0|But I will try...  My deepest admiration and respect for this wonderful DVD set. George Harrison was a wonderful human being and this set helps us learn more about this talented and deeply spiritual gentleman.. Great music, great interviews.. Puts us in the middle of the loop with all of his closest friends and loved ones telling their stories about George... GREAT!
B004LWZW88|5.0|A fun take on Puss' previous life. Has adult humor intermingled in with the classic silliness of a Dreamworks family film.
030758836X|5.0|This is the best crime novel I have read this year.<br /><br />I haven't read any of the author's previous novels, but I do remember reading great reviews about them here and there and that they were commercially successful. So when I was given the chance to read Gone Girl, I simply took it. And as you can guess from the first line in this article I really loved it.<br /><br />This is the story of Nick and Amy, and what a story it is. Nick has spent most of his adult life in New York working as a journalist. He used to write about the movies and TV and review books, and live a somewhat worry-free life. And then he met Amy, a woman who at first sight took his breath away and made him believe that she were the one he always dreamed of meeting. Thus he fell in love with her and she fell in love with him, and then they got married, wishing to live together their happily ever after. However their everyday lives were constantly under the heavy shadows created by Amy's parents, the ones that gave her life and robbed it of her.<br /><br />How did they do that? Well, they were both writers, a writing team actually, and together they created a series of books with the adventures of the Amazing Amy. The Amy of the books though was someone who the real life one could never be. And the Amy of the books became kind of a weight on her young shoulders and a curse for her life, since she made her a target: beloved by fans, haunted and hunted by stalkers.<br /><br />Before she met Nick she felt completely alone, having him by her side she became the cool girl that she always wanted to be. Nick has set her free, however, her happiness wasn't meant to last forever.<br /><br />First came the economic crisis, which led her parents to bankruptcy. Then came Nick's letting go from his job and finally came the move from New York to a little town in North Carthage, where Nick was born.<br /><br />So, all of a sudden, her happy life became unhappy and her successful marriage a prospective failure. Joy and laughter were replaced by tension and anger. They hit rock bottom.<br /><br />Amy though desperately wanted things to be the way they used to be, and she started working in order to stir their relationship towards that direction. However, just before her efforts started bearing fruit, she all of a sudden vanished from the face of the earth. Where did she go? Was she abducted or did she simply run away? Could she be dead? If yes, who was it that killed her? As usual the husband is considered the prime suspect. Nick keeps protesting his innocence, but his behavior is considered curious if not suspicious by everyone who meets him, as well as from the general public.<br /><br />Who is Nick? And who was Amy? These are the big questions here. Is Nick as careless and detached as he seems? Was Amy as bright and innocent as she looked?<br /><br />The author gives us a chance to take a good look into the private, but mostly separate lives, of her heroes, through diary entries, thoughts and discussions. Nick and Amy, they both say their own version of the story, and they both hide more than what they say.<br /><br />The more one reads the bigger the mystery becomes and the twists and turns come in waves. Nothing is what it seems and all the clues lead some of the main characters from one dead end to the next.<br /><br />The final solution is just as surprising as the facts that precede it, but what one mostly enjoys by reading this book is its built-up, the whole construction of a world that's in many ways amazing, just as much as Amy.ure. Joy and laughter were replaced by tension and anger.

Nick and Amy, they both say their own version of the story, and they both hide more than what they say.<br /><br />The more one reads the bigger the mystery becomes and the twists and turns come in waves. Nothing is what it seems and all the clues lead some of the main characters from one dead end to the next.<br /><br />The final solution is just as surprising as the facts that precede it, but what one mostly enjoys by reading this book is its built-up, the whole construction of a world that's in many ways amazing, just as much as Amy.
B003QHYHFS|3.0|Waited a while to review this, but I believe most die hard Maiden fans are being kind.<br /><br />I dont know, over the years these newer Maiden discs don't hold up. The production is again marginal (why so flat and distant sounding?), the songs are a bit lllooonnnggg and too many extended intro's and time wasting, repetitive rhythm sections that don't hold your attention. I keep trying to like the newer stuff but, aside from 'A Matter of Life And Death' (which was 60/40), it doesnt sound very fresh and the content doesnt demand such long tracks.<br /><br />Honestly, I would rather have 10 4-5 minute, solid tracks with staying power with the same production/sound quality as a 'Piece of Mind' or even 'Brave New world' . Is that to much to ask? I mean they really cant enjoy playing these tracks live, they don't go too far. Has to be a bit of a bore (but the intro's do give them a lot of time to rest between songs). But in 2012 with such a high caliber band, to have such flat production further dragging down the overtly long songs, lets just say it doesn't help and i dont get the intentional drop in sound quality. Not as bad as Metallica did in their past few but still a travesty. I mean the technology and the money IS there. (If money is tight, worry less about the pretty packaging and covers).<br /><br />I do have a history with Maiden. Long time Maiden fan, blah blah, blah.. Didnt want to not like this, I am just disappointed at the level of flow on these newer CD's. Frankly they bore me. They just drag out making me less likely to go back to it because the payoff isn't there. This = wasted time and money on a band that was once extremely reliable. If you expect me to sit through 8 minute tracks, don't make 2 minutes of it an intro, don't let them just drag along mid-paced without even a strong production to fall on and if the ideas are dry, just cut songs down to the 5 minutes they should be. Some tracks would work much better that way because there are some scattered pieces of 'good'.<br /><br />Sorry, just being honest. Love Maiden, but its time to start worrying about the quality instead of song length. I (and many others i am sure, if they were honest) dont care how long CD's are anymore, just give us some quality tracks.. The talent is obviously still there, but the disappointments are mounting.red pieces of 'good'.<br /><br />Sorry, just being honest.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|I have read this series so many times because you just don't want to leave this world Karen Moning has created. I've bought T-Shirts on Zazzle. I am a loving fan. I want to hear more about what happens with Jericho and Mac, it would be so cool if they have a child! Imagine the abilities. Also a child may just soften up Jerichos men...smile. Would love to hear more about Riordan. What can I say I just don't want this series to end! I have pre-ordered Dani's book so I can go back. I wish they would make this series into a movie like twilight. Just loved it so much...Please Ms.Moning keep writing this series.....
0099579936|5.0|Incredible, amazing love story!!!!! A little over the top, but I cannot put this one down. It makes me feel young and alive again. This book takes me back to the most unbelievable relationship that I have ever had. I forgot how good it used to make me feel being that much in love with someone. The excitement, seduction, and relationship are out of this world... It really makes me question whether or not I got married to the right person or did I just settled for \\"safe?\\"
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It has been a very long time since I've enjoyed a story this much.  I couldn't put it down.  Wool is amazingly well written; I certainly cannot do it justice in this review.  I wouldn't be surprised if Hollyweird attempted to make a movie out of this.

B000F3TBIO|5.0|Look. It's like this. Peeping Tom is a fantastic album if you:<br /><br />A. ...love Faith No More and believe they were one of the most underrated rock bands ever.<br />B. ...are seriously tired of the auto-tuned, mass-produced, over-marketed bull**** masquerading as music these days.<br />C. ...are willing and eager to try something \\"different\\".<br /><br />What's brilliant about this album is that it's Mike Patton's attempt at creating \\"pop\\" music. It's not pop music for the masses though, and I doubt seriously he intended it as such. It's like Mike is appealing to HIS masses. I happen to be one of his masses (a tumor near his left nipple, actually) and I love that. He challenges people with his music. He doesn't want to regurgitate whatever successful lick is out there. He wants to dive in and explore. If his music was paint it would be Jackson Pollock. A crazy spray of color on canvas that, somehow, meshes together. It connects. Maybe it won't for you.<br /><br />But I can pretty much guarantee it will evoke a response from you, either way. There is no fence sitting with this album.<br /><br />And if you love FNM's \\"Angel Dust\\" as much as I do, this album is a natural.<br /><br />Thank you, Mike. I love you. Keep slinging those dead cats.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This 5 star (if I could give it more, I would) rating comes from someone who, normally, cannot stand comic book movies. I was quite skeptical going into this film and a complete fan leaving it. I will recommend this clever, fun, surprisingly pretty movie until the cows come home. It's everything a summer movie should be: funny, action-packed, epic, and best watched with friends.
0440178002|5.0|Shogun published in 1976 is one of the three Asian sagas on Japan and Japanese written by James Clavell, an Australian director and writer. Dell edition is 1152 pages long and it took me months to complete this novel. The author chose the days of the year 1600 Japan, when decisive battle of Sekigahara dividing the nation into two sides, Western league led by Ishida(Ishido in this story) and Eastern league led by Iyeyasu Tokugawa(Toranaga in this story) was about to take place. It was also the year the vessel piloted by William Adams(Blackthorne in this story) was brought to anchor off part of Kyushu. Clavell excellently put the two elements together and made an excellent epic on exploits of English pilot Blackthorne and introducing an powerful and elusive warlord Toranaga who aims to be a Shogun and ultimately rule the whole Japan. And unlike the similarly plotted samurai dramas, Clavell blended love romance. Also this novel is one of the first attempt to plobe into the minds of soon-to-be Shogun by making him confide part of his intentions to a woman he sleeps. It also complements the background information of what you have seen in TV series which has not explained enough. By making the original story and not the translation of existing Japanese historical novels, Clavell shows the real-life examples of how the Bushido, samurai codes of ethics, are applied to various kinds of situations, just as Asimov did in his robot series to show how the three laws of robotics work. As for the correctness of historical setting TV series are far better because Toho staffs and Toshiro Mifune who played the part of Toranaga corrected the factual errors. So by reading this novel you will have the idea of how the original plot might have been. What is also great in this novel is that it presents both the formal and informal manners of Japanese which for some non-Japanese a sort of double standard.<br /><br />Verdict: Great introductory novels to find out about Samurais as well as underlying logics of Japanese behavior.<br />Rating: 96 out of 100<br />Recommended for: Fans of Japanese culture and Samurai films.
B0086700CM|5.0|love it best game ever and yes I am thirdteen s don't say I am no 13because I am love the games best
B007U1FEJE|5.0|Let me start off by saying that with age comes wisdom. I would have never guessed in a million years that \\"THE BEACH BOY'S\\" in 2012 with them being 70 plus yrs of age would have put out a new studio album of this calliber. Who else has done that (NOBODY). This is in my humble opinion there most consistant album by far. Almost every song on this album is truly a winner. If your like me i enjoy music that makes me feel happy and emotional and that you can create wonderful memories with and this album has all of that. There harmonies are absolutly beautiful on here. I have had this cd for about 2 weeks now and the first night i played it 6 times back to back and had to force myself to stop listening to it and have enjoyed it everyday repeatedly since. With all of the depressing and negative crap out there causing people to be so full of hatred i believe music and entertainment shapes our youth into what it is today and looking at our society today it's very sad and depressing to me. So along comes THE BEACH BOY'S to remind us what music is all about. Fun, happines, memories and tears of emotion. This album has such a feel good vibe to it and a few very beautifully emotionally written songs. The last song on the album \\"SUMMERS GONE\\" is my personal favorite. It's about summer coming to an end but somehow i get this feeling it's about \\"THE BEACH BOY'S\\" coming to an end. I have cried everytime i have listen to it because it's very emotionally moving to me. Do yourself a huge favor and buy this album and let it brighten your day and everyday! I would like to say thank you to \\"THE BEACH BOY'S\\" for all of the great happy music you have all contributed to my life. God bless you \\"BRIAN WILSON\\" for being the musical genius that you are and \\"DENNIS AND CARL WILSON\\" may you both R.I.P. To all of you - SURFS UP!!!
B002ZG9774|5.0|Burlesque is just one of those movies that comes out of nowhere, doesn't get the press it deserves, and then becomes a sensational hit after the fact.  That's exactly how I feel about this movie.  Now I'm not a musical kind of guy, but I've only seen a handful of musicals, and this one ranks among the best.  It's up there with Rocky Horror and My Fair Lady (my other two favorite musical movies).<br /><br />The only thing that annoys me is how some people claim that this is a \\"chick flick.\\"  It is by NO MEANS a chick flick!  This movie is great for both guys and girls.  For the girls, you can look at all the gorgeous women and appreciate them for their style.  You can also look at the very handsome lead actor, Jack, for some eye candy.  Maybe you view them as role models, perhaps (and maybe you fine lesbians can whet your whistle a bit!).  For the guys, well...you can look at all the gorgeous women too and get your male juices flowing.  For the gay men out there, of course there's lots to love!  You got your Broadway musical thing going on with your fabulous icon, Cher (and a musical track by your other icon, Madonna, interspersed in between scenes), and then there's Jack with a partial nudity scene.<br /><br />There's something for everybody in this film!  The choreography is great, the actors are wonderful, and the dance numbers are super catchy and entertaining to watch.  It's a definite must-see.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Overall this is a great kill time game, lots of fun minigames, a little bit of a challenge, and the kids love it. My only problem with it it the point system to unlock the games.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I haven't even downloaded this app because of all the bad reviews. I have a kindle fire, and am paying an extra $80 each year for free app every day, and a prime member for amazon... this $80 is NOT worth it. Amazon's free apps of the day are all crappy ones that no one else is willing to buy. I've had it since January, and only have 1 faotd that I have kept. My kindle won't ever allow me to upload photos to facebook or twitter, so why even bother with this stupid app?? Ridiculous.

B007U1FEJE|5.0|I have been a Beach Boys fan ever since I first heard \\"Surfin' Safari\\" back in the summer of 1962. I cannot believe that it has been fifty years since then. Their sound captivated me then, a thirteen year old boy growing up on the shores of Lake Erie who always loved the beach, but we had no surf on Lake Erie (except in winter when no one in their right mind would go out near the lake). I had that California surfer look down pat in high school and followed the career of the Beach Boys ever since. This is a great album of new material to mark fifty years of great music. Add this to the list of classic albums. Maybe this one will be the one that caps their great career. I hope not.<br /><br />The songs are mature songs that evoke the memories of our youth, but from a perspective of someone who has been around more than the same old beach. The title song brings back memories of how myself and most people first were introduced into rock and roll- by listening to the songs on the radio, often in the car. \\"Isn't it Time\\" is a classic song that brings back memories of great times spent with close friends or a \\"significant other\\". This may become another classic song in their vast catalog. \\"Daybreak Over The Ocean\\" evokes images of being on the seashore when it is quiet as the sun rises. When I heard that song, my mind immediately thought of the time at Hilton Head when I sat on the beach and watched the morning sun rise over the South Carolina coast. The final two songs on the CD; \\"Pacific Coast Highway\\" and \\"Summer's Gone\\" offer a very fitting conclusion of the album and perhaps the Beach Boys' career. I sure hope not; but with fifty years this surely is a milestone. I want more.<br /><br />If I could compare this album to any previous Beach Boys album, perhaps it could be compared to \\"Pet Sounds\\", their 1966 opus that was a complete departure from all their earlier material. I was in high school in 1966 and when I first heard \\"Pet Sounds\\", I didn't like it. It was so different than their earlier material and was a much more mature sound for the group. However as I grew older, I got to like \\"Pet Sounds\\" more than their earlier material. It grew on me, as this will grow on anyone who listens to it. The Beach Boys sound matured just as I did along with my generation. Now us baby boomers are looking back on all the years and remembering our youth, while refusing to give in to advancing age. The only thing that I could find against this album is that it is too short. After listening to it, I wanted more.<br /><br />As a side, I saw the Beach Boys in concert last week (June 13) and they showed that they could still rock in concert. They played a first set that lasted 90 minutes, took a fifteen minute break, then came back for a second set that lasted another hour. During the two sets, they played forty of their songs spanning their career. I was pleased to see as many young people on the lawn of Blossom Music Center as aging baby boomers. People here know a classic rock and roll band when they see one.<br /><br />I live in the city of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and am a charter member of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The Beach Boys were inducted in the third induction class of 1988, the first year they were eligible (in order to be inducted twenty five years must have passed since the introduction of their first song on the charts). There are not many artists who can make that claim to fame. That induction class of 1988 also includes The Beatles, Bob Dylan, The Supremes and The Drifters. That is a pretty impressive class.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|The reviews for this application seems to be all over the place.I was a little skeptical at first as the standard gallery all ready allows some editing like cropping and share on Facebook. However this app has so much more for the user to choose from. I like the fact that this app controls the camera so there is not a need to dig though the gallery.  It its one of the nicest editing tools I have on my phone but $5 seems rather high for this app, but there may be options that I have encountered yet.
B0086700CM|4.0|I just got this app for my kindle fire, and it runs great with no lag. Its pretty fun for a free game. However this game may get old for some people.

0060775858|5.0|For those of you who have read this board book to your little ones ten thousand times, you may know the answer to this trivia question: How long does it take little bunny boy to settle down and go to sleep?<br /><br />The artist, Clement Hurd added fun detail to his pictures. The first is the addition of a tiny mouse in almost every scene. My son had lots of fun finding him and pointing him out as I read. Once he got older, he added a side dialog as to what the mouse's name was, what was he thinking, where was he going, etc.<br /><br />The second fun tidbit is the clock. We start the story at 7:00 pm and finally close the book at 8:10 pm. Parents, we've all been there. It's nice to know that even fictional characters take a while to fall asleep.
0345803485|1.0|I am so glad I did not pay to read this book.  Unfortunately, I can never get the time back that I wasted reading this dreck.  This is some of the worst writing I have ever seen.  The dialog is juvenile, the sex scenes are laughable.  The whole thing sounds like something a 15-year-old would write in her diary.  It isn't so bad that it is good, it is just plain bad.  I can't believe that these books are so popular.  There are much, much better erotica novels and short stories out there.  Ugh!

B003VANOFY|5.0|A friend recommended these and I love them!<br />I can put them on and walk all around the house while listening to music.  It dampens the sound around (blocking the noise the kids are making).  I work at home alot and this summer they have been great, the kids play in the other room and I am not disturbed by them, as long as the music is on.<br /><br />Pros:<br /> - Love the surround sound for the video games.  Really enhanced SWTOR and Diablo III.  When I get time will try them on older games.<br />- The 3 buttons on the headset are great while listening to music.  I can skip to next and pause without being near the computer.<br />- Microphone worked perfectly and the mute control on the headset is also very handy.<br />- Setup was easy.<br />- Very comfortable<br /><br />Cons:<br />- I look a bit geeky with them on (according to the wife and kids).

B007D2XSW0|1.0|Thanks for offering it for free but it won't load at all on my Droid incredible just comes up and says force close
B007D2XSW0|3.0|Going into this app, the one feature I was looking for was Red Eye removal - which to my delight is included... But.<br /><br />As with most of the functions in PicShop, Red Eye Removal isn't quite fully baked. The problem I had with my first photo was that the image needed to be zoomed in, so I intuitively \\"pinched\\" to zoom my photo, and then couldn't figure out how to pan the photo. Sooner than later, I've zoomed out, and am unable to zoom back in (as I've seen in some other reviews) Several Force Stops later (as the program does not have any exit function apparent) and I've got it set up for my Red Eye Removal, touch my daughter's red eye, and end up with a green halo around her eye?!?!?! Several minutes of settings tweaks later, I have satisfactorily removed the redness from her eyes and moved on to the fun stuff. Borders, stamps, \\"focus\\", etc. These effects seem to work mostly, and can indeed be fun to play with.<br /><br />Time for do or die. All done editing the photo (nearly 45 minutes later for simple Red Eye Removal plus a little bit of play time) and I hit the Save button - and decide to just send it to Facebook. Nope. After entering in a description for the photo, and hitting the post button, an error pops up telling me to sign in to Facebook - but I am. Both my browser and the Facebook app are signed in, so no idea what else it's wanting from me, but the error box will *not* go away. After some finagling I do manage to save the photo to the device itself (not a simple feat with the Facebook error covering the middle of the screen the whole time) and can post separately from within Facebook itself. Another Force Close, and one more attempt to upload to Facebook from within PicShop ends in the same error message as before (What do I have to do to convince this program that I'm signed in to Facebook?). Well, I load it up on my tablet, and with the larger screen I see what it's wanting now. With the larger error window I can see it asking for Facebook login credentials - which again didn't show up on my phone.<br /><br />Bottom line - PicShop is 3/5 of a very handy app. There are some annoying bugs, and lacking options that prevent this from being a great app. If the devs can get the little stuff straightened out, this will be the photo editor to pick up, but until then I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who frustrates easily.<br /><br />Tested on:<br />HTC Amaze 4G ICS<br />Asus Transformer Pad TF300T ICScredentials - which again didn't show up on my phone.<br /><br />Bottom line - PicShop is 3/5 of a very handy app. There are some annoying bugs, and lacking options that prevent this from being a great app. If the devs can get the little stuff straightened out, this will be the photo editor to pick up, but until then I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who frustrates easily.<br /><br />Tested on:<br />HTC Amaze 4G ICS<br />Asus Transformer Pad TF300T ICS
B000MKD9P6|4.0|In a movie, it's funny, in real-life, the job would be hell.<br /><br />I don't doubt there's bosses who feel entitled to treat the little people in such a manner, but it's just another form of bullying.<br /><br />Anyways, Anne Hathaway put in a good performance, the outfits in the movie were lovely to look at. Emily Blunt gave a great performance as...Emily.<br /><br />Fun movie. Isn't it nice how things are so easy and just fall into place in the movies? Bf, job, fabulous wardrobe...ahh, if only it were all so easy.
B007JYDOI0|5.0|An emotionally wrenching story about a family of Polish Jews living in Paris, who, in July of 1942 experience the rounding up of Jewish families by French police. The story goes between present time and 1942. In the present, a woman who happens to be a journalist, is about to move into the home that once belonged to the Jewish family. She is assigned the task of writing about the anniversary of Vel' d'Hiv' - the rounding up. She becomes obsessed with finding Sarah, the young daughter who locked her brother in a cupboard - until she could return for him - not knowing she would never be allowed to return home. A shocking, deeply profound story of tragedy, love, loss, and the sharing of grief.
B0077SGMXM|5.0|I like the fact that this &quot;golf&quot; game is 2 dimensional rather than 3 for the sake of simplicity.

0307278255|3.0|I was surprised to learn this was a book of short stories. However, one that leaves a string that weaves through the stories. Lahiri is a fantastic writer, drawing the reader in, as if you are sitting next to her near a warm hearth, and you are sharing a cup of tea and listening to her tell her stories. A great pleasure to read.
0618918248|4.0|There are three, and only three forms of human experience: thought, feeling and action. Each domain has its own rules. One does not evaluate Mozart in the same way that one evaluates Evolution. The difficulty with Dawkins argument is that he applies cognitive rules to evaluate affective and psychomotor aspects of religion. Yes, the domains overlap, to a degree that is uncertain and may even fluctuate; but to refute a feeling, one must apply rules that govern feeling. Dawkins refers to aesthetic matters as the heading of one subsection only, on Inspiration; the parameters of the factive aren't considered at all, though they lie at the center of the Islamic imperative. These are precisely the areas that require amplification, if his argument is to be complete. God must be shown to not exist in all three domains that humans are capable of perceiving. Abraham Maslow's \\"being values\\" apply, and Dawkins' argument could profit by working through these systematically. He comes closest when he equates religious instruction with child abuse, since his anecdotes pierce the heart like a needle. He needs more such. Until he deals with the affective, he may change minds, but not hearts. As it is, he is beating an apple to death with an orange.<br /><br />I disagree with other reviewers here: Dawkins is entitled to his style; we all are. His is entertaining, particularly when he tells stories about Science that approach parables. And there IS something strange about an omniscient god that changes his mind. On the other hand, if human choice (free will) is real, the existence of God is necessarily unprovable, since any proof would make free will impossible, and this is true whether God exists or not. The converse is also true: it's impossible to prove that God doesn't exist, in any scientifically robust way; the most we can do, and Deakins does it, is to say God is unlikely, in this book, near zero.<br /><br />Yes, it's unreasonable to believe in a god, who is indivisible yet appears in thirds and is His own father, then becomes His own son, who is and isn't Himself, by being born of a virgin, who is and isn't His mother, and rises again from the dead again to become Himself, in order to atone for sin that He created that He could have forgiven, being omnipotent. And, yes, it's suspicious that cultures appear to create gods that resemble themselves. But our species is unreasonable and impulsive; reason won't change what is hard wired. Still, appeals can and should be made to mind, heart and hands; Dawkins appeals to mind, but not heart and hands.<br /><br />He commits the cognitive fallacy. Systems theory pertains. In a system of interdependent parts, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts, suboptimizing any part suboptimizes all parts. What is not so obvious is that optimizing one part suboptimizes the others and the whole system. Where God is concerned, thought, feeling and action operate wholistically and systemically. By optimizing one element, cognition, Dawkins not only suboptimizes the others, but suboptimizes the cognitive. To take on the subject of God, one needs to be more than a scientist; one also needs to be poet and hero.<br /><br />His remarks on pronoun policing do not convince me that conscious raising justifies aggression. There's a fine line between pride and bullying, and many cross the line so often that they no longer know where it is. Nor do I believe that the gambit will prove effective. The French have been trying to control popular usage for centuries, and French is more franglais than ever. I doubt that our linguistic puritans will do better than the people who invented Chauvinism, and it seems even more unlikely that operant conditioning will undo gender-based distinctions that lie at the heart of natural selection. Of course, oppression is odious, whatever its source, even when it opposes oppression; but wars of any sort, including culture wars, are more odious, because more destructive and less useful. As it is, trying to describe popular usage is like trying to describe a countryside from a moving train through a window whose blinds are drawn back one minute per hour during a thunderstorm at night; controlling usage is yelling instructions through that window, while it is closed.<br /><br />Dawkins can't think of an empirical test for a religion, but there may be one, whether it produces good neighbors. In America, this outcome exists, most notably among homesteading pioneers and their offspring, where interdependence in the face of external threat is mandated by circumstance. But in this case, religion is not the controlling variable. Whether it lasts beyond the third generation remains to be seen. It may simply be the case that in certain circumstances, environment reinforces religion.<br /><br />Bottom line: This is one of those books that will stimulate you, no matter what you believe; and that is why you should read it. Unmediated raw stimulus is responsible for one-half of all cognitive growth; what you believe has nothing to do with it. It's the Hawthorne Effect. And there's pleasure in watching the English do scholarship, not only because they call out the humbug mercilessly, but because one can enjoy watching a monument of enduring intellect take shape, like Pygmalion from a block of marble. I mean, Dawkins is an intellectual! At Oxford, scholars spend a lifetime pursuing what is large, omnivorously. There are few intellectuals on American campuses; we have careerists.ul.

0143113100|4.0|Like getting your eyelids opened wide so you can see more! Proof of the brain's plasticity is now undeniable. This remarkable organ is a fantastically adaptable unit. The personal stories in the book really underline and personalize the data presented in a very human way. I loved the story of the girl born with only half a brain (literally). Gains in rehab therapy in the stroke area are heartening. Would love to see some follow up information, as well.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|After listening to the album a few times, it's easy to rank this one at the top.  The people that like this album will be the ones with musical sense and understanding of an artist who puts his heart into song writing.  I don't compare albums to the last because they all sound different. That's what makes Billy the best.  Have an open mind to music and enjoy the ride!

B002SSUQFG|4.0|I bought this watch quite some time ago and am satisfied with it.<br /><br />I replaced the cloth bracelet with a brushed stainless steel one from Dakota watch CO.  It looks great and I wear it to work 60% of the time.<br /><br />This works on job interviews and brings back memories of the old Hamilton GI to older people that I run into.<br /><br />The problem with this time peice is that it LOSES time and I find myself readjusting it on a weekly basis.  This is not an issue and takes not more than a few seconds and I dont mind this at all.<br /><br />If you are willing to deal with this I would suggest buying this watch.  It is easy to use and fashionable without being overstated.  I really love it.

B0012PDVQ2|4.0|I watched this with my 14-year-old son last night.  He fell asleep.  This version of the film removes the voice of Harrison Ford and adds a bunch of deleted scenes (mostly shots of scenery).  Blade Runner is a great film, but all the changes make this version seems slow and annoying.

0688156819|5.0|I really enjoy this book illustrated and written by Tim Burton.  Kids may find it too scary since I know some adults who think its creepy.  My only negative thing to say is that I wish it had more stories.  The entire book can be read in 15 minutes, which is more like a teaser than a real book. But the stories that are in there are quality and clever.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I can honestly say this is one of the best books I have read in a while. I was constantly waiting to see what would happen with the intoxicating main characters Trav and Abby. It was worth the money and worth every second spent. If you love a good love story this is one to add to your collection.
B001P36OXI|5.0|I've seen this movie over & over I mean come on who doesn't like Vin Diesl! I love sifi as well & to have both Vin & SIFI together is a dream come true. Can't go wrong with this... It's got action, drama, comadie, love.... It's an over all GREAT movie!!
B007MAETA8|2.0|Thought it was John Mellencamp coming out with a new CD so pre-ordered and was surprised that I had gotten John Mayer instead.  Don't care for John Mayer but there are some songs on the CD that are okay.  Not something I would normally buy so probably not fair to write a review.
B0086700CM|5.0|I like this game because u can even use it on a kindle fire and fyi for all u pad and pod lover's the kindle fire is 1000000times better
B003Y38YFS|4.0|I had this pair of crocs hovering in my shopping basket for a few weeks. I liked the style, I really liked the purple color. But it was the fact that they're crocs that had me hesitant. Usually when I try on some of the more attractive footwear made by this company, it doesn't fit correctly. Most commonly, my arch and the arch constructed in the shoe don't line up effectively. That doesn't seem to be a problem for me with this pair, hooray!<br />I can wear them comfortably through a full day on my feet, but there's two things in the design that I'm less crazy about.<br />One is the flexibility of the sole. Overall, this has much to do with the comfort. However it is very easy for the very front of the shoe to catch on a surface like a rug and bend under, causing a little bit of a stumble.<br />The other thing is the footbed surface being peppered with little braille-like bumps. Again, I know it's about comfort. But they are great at trapping dirt in the sandal, especially in the little well the logo provides. I've already cleaned the inside of my sandals with a nail brush at least twice after wearing them around.<br />But I really dig them. They're flattering on my foot. Non confining. I was concerned I'd have a little bit of blistering from straps, I did not. They were ready to go from the beginning.<br /><br />Edit: Enjoyed my purple ones so much that I sought out a pair in another color later in the summer. Same level of comfort. I pretty much spent my entire summer favoring these shoes. I wish it was summer year round.<br />Have raised my rating by one star, because I have to be honest, it turns out I really did like these.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy was AMAZING!!  I'm not sure what those who didn't like it read but I found it to be awesome.  I couldn't put it down and when I was done with all 3 books, I wasn't ready for it to end.  Ugh!!  And whoever said it's similar to Twilight didn't read the books.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is an amazing story by a fantastic storyteller, and is instantly one of my favorite sci-fi books of all time. I have read everything from Iain M. Banks and find it hard to read other sci-fi writers, who too often have a style that focuses too little on character.<br /><br />Howey's writing is rich with texture and feeling, making this an effortless read. He manages to demonstrate differing viewpoints in a way that feels balanced but not undecided, giving clearly despicable individuals believable justifications for their actions. It's impossible to know what you, as the reader, might do in any of the characters' shoes.<br /><br />It's cheap and good, buy it. You won't regret it.
0345803485|5.0|Easy read, hard to put down. Easy to love characters.<br />Looking forward to reading it all from Christians point of view.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|Hi there.as soon as I downloaded the app I knew it would keep me busy and I would have lots of fun using it.
0470932139|5.0|Helene Dujardin's PLATE TO PIXEL is an excellent overview of food photography, which tries to cover many aspects from equipment, style, aspect, camera setting, props, and much more. This is one photography book that is an smooth read and easy to follow.<br />Read PLATE TO PIXEL for novic lessons on how to shoot, the value of lighting, composition, and framing, etc. Then practice her suggested techniques with wooden fruit or other props until your camera work becomes second nature as to focus, ISO, lighting with found objects (lids of to-go boxes make good bounce for light)until these become second nature. Then you came move on to the more advanced aspects of food photography.<br />As Helene says, \\"shoot as if you were using film.\\" This saves many hours working with photo editing software to get a pleasing exposure.<br />Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH
B00782O7IY|3.0|The photography is beautiful, the music is nice, and the design is superb.  But we have seen this trite story before and this is certainly nothing profound.  I would not need or want to watch it again.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|great app :) would recommend to others looking for a good calculator app. One more useful app for kindle fire.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love the immediate delivery of E-Books. I had already read this book so I haven't read the e-version yet but I know I love it already, just wanted to have it available at any time for reading through all 3!

B007D2XSW0|5.0|Downloaded this app for the kindle fire.<br />Went online and downloaded some of my photograpySince the fire has no camera.<br /> Opened up this app. Controls are responsive.  App performs great. Saved my finished photo. 4 options are available. After I setup and then uploaded to facebook.<br />Tho app is a great way for editing smartphone photos on a bigger screen.

0545265355|5.0|I received my Hunger Games boxed trilogy a few days ago. I got it within 4 days so the service was quick.<br />The price was great for the books. They look real nice and I can't wait to read them! Satisfied customer! :-)
0307719219|4.0|This book owes a great and unacknowledged debt to Mancur Olson's \\"Power and Prosperity\\", which laid the theoretic groundwork for the importance of governmental institutions to economic development, and to Hernando de Soto's \\"The Mystery of Capital\\", which provided definitive objective evidence.  I recommend both over this book.<br /><br />While I agree with the authors' conclusions and think the evidence of history is overwhelming, their approach is anecdotal as opposed to rigorous.<br /><br />Still, it is an easy read and clear, and it makes a strong if not scientific case for the relationship between good government and growth, and why small elites favor autocratic governments at the expense of the populous.  This is an important topic that citizens in a democracy need to understand.  It is for these reasons that I recommend this book.
B0038P59A0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Action, suspense, thriller, very funny and excellent music with none of the stupid sex crap you see in most movies for whatever reason.
0393080269|5.0|This was a great book and there was lots to be gained from reading it.<br /><br />First, the text came in at 255 pages with supporting charts and a good index. (With a total of 14 chapters, that works out to 18 pages per chapter-- enough to read a chapter on a lunch break.) Sharma got in, said what he had to say, and then wrapped up (both in each chapter and in the book as a whole).<br /><br />Second, the author had a good and clear writing style. In no way did his prose come across as stuffy or pretentious.<br /><br />Third, the book didn't come across as some abstruse academic study/ analysis. It was (and felt very much like) the writing of someone that had real life experience on the ground and wrote his book from actually being to the places that he went to and paying attention to the happenings there. His index and bibliography were very short (only about 4 pages) and most of them were drawn on articles from sources such as WSJ, Forbes and internet articles.<br /><br />In all these three respects, the book was distinctly anti-academic. (Not such a bad thing, since it is said that the only reason for professional and academic economists is to give the weather forecasters someone to laugh at.)<br /><br />The most resounding (to me) take away messages of the book were:<br /><br />1. Regression to the mean. Nations that are growing now can't always grow forever. This topic has been visited many times by many different authors, but a restatement of it never hurts in light of the fact that so many people seem to think that something new is happening every time that some economy that seems to defy gravity seems to come up (think China).<br /><br />2. The long term predictions of experts are no good. We also knew this as well. He gives a different spin on something that was taken up by Nicholas Taleb (he of [[ASIN:081297381X The Black Swan: Second Edition: The Impact of the Highly Improbable: With a new section: &#34;On Robustness and Fragility&#34;]] and [[ASIN:B00824LIPM Fooled By Randomness]]), but in the context of Development/ International Economics (rather than simple Macro/ Stock Markets).<br /><br />3. No, the business cycle is not going to be dis-invented. People thought that they have done it before-- and they have been wrong. (Margaret Thatcher brought up this point something like 20 years ago in [[ASIN:B0002NPFSM Statecraft : Strategies for a Changing World]].)<br /><br />4. The increase in the price of commodities is a third boom and is something that is just like other booms: First the Japanese boom-- and bust. Then the internet/ technology/ dotcom boom-- and bust. The discussion of the commodities boom is done in Chapter 13 and is over a tight 16 pages that can be reread over the course of half an hour (to glean any missed information). It's not excessively bloated or technical.  Sharma creates something like his own Big Mac Index with his &#34;Four Seasons Index&#34; (p. 233) and he estimates how much room nations have to grow (and who could become the next breakout nation) by how under-priced their Four Seasons hotel is relative to the emerging market average. I think that this was probably the best part of the book.<br /><br />5. p. 221. &#34;No nations development path can be understood through a simple set of rules.&#34; Amen! We knew this, but a pithy book like this that iterates the idea never hurts.<br /><br />The book also has some very brief history of countries. Nothing that is overwrought with detail, but just enough to put together a coherent story of why country X has result Y whereas country A has result B. (For example: The author gets into a discussion about the reasons for the greater technical competence of the Chinese leadership vis a vis the Vietnamese leadership--- even though both have the same economic system/ type of government.)<br /><br />He also let a bit of air out of China sails by point out that: 1. It's very easy to have huge growth from a small base; 2. It's less easy to have largegrowth from a large base; 3. China has an aging population that is going to drag on growth. I am not sure that I agreed with his assessment of the &#34;huge consumer market&#34; in China (I live here, after all), but it didn't detract that much from the book (which was meant to be expository and not overly analytical).<br /><br />I bought this book new, and it was worth every penny of the new purchase price.with his assessment of the &#34;huge consumer market&#34; in China (I live here, after all), but it didn't detract that much from the book (which was meant to be expository and not overly analytical).

B008011XQQ|4.0|Happy to see a new Santana album with original material. There are more tracks than usual without Afro-Latin percussion, which opens up space to appreciate the rhythm section interaction between Dennis Chambers' drums, Chester Thomas' keys, the bass and Carlos. Some tracks have a more rock edge while others serve as soothing chill music. I LOVE the opening track with American Indian sounds that at once take me heavenward and place me firmly on Mother Earth. Great work that will be appreciated for years to come!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|For me I think it was very a good book. A good book for me has to have some basic things to make it really interesting. It must have action, adventure, death and a little bit of romance and the Hunger Games has everything. This book makes you want to continuo reading and reading, you get so involved the story that you actually feel like you're in The Hunger Games. The book´s ending really leaves you in a cliffhanger, making us read catching fire.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|like I hav ween people on iphones play this and I knew I wanted it I was so excited when I saw that u could get it for kindle fire!!!!

B002C6A6N6|5.0|Love this series. Set in the 1800's, it's the story of Dr Michaela Quinn, her medical practice in Colorado Springs, the events of the town and its colorful people. From medical emergencies, romance, action and history, this series has it all. I highly recommend it.[[ASIN:B002C6A6N6 Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman: The Complete Series]]
1442419814|4.0|Its a very interesting entertaining book. It is in practically new conditiion. I really enjoyed this book. I already ordered the third one as well.
B0034G4P8A|3.0|Thor was the last of the Avengers films I needed to watch. And it did excite, at times, though I wish there were more of Thor. The first 30 minutes of the film was great, a great battle between Thor and his four friends attack the frost giants in an epic and well done battle. From then on it dropped downhill, but with enough great settings and special effects, that it does excite.<br /><br />What I give the most praise to in this film is Director Kenneth Branagh. His camera angles and the upside down views were interesting and depicted the separation of worlds. And the look of Asgard, as a city, was well crafted and beautifully rendered by the effects team. It was straight from the comics and done excellently on screen. The Gatekeeper was a great addition, I was glad he was in the film. Anthony Hopkins(\\"Silence Of The Lambs\\"), plays a good Odin and Chris Hemsworth is the perfect actor as the god of thunder. Loki is also an exciting character, his wickedness shows well here as performed by the great Tom Hiddleston. And of course his plans for the future begin in this movie.<br /><br />Now that a Thor 2, Iron Man 3 and a Captain America 2 have been green lit, and that leading into the next Avengers film.  It looks like its gonna be a great few years for Marvel on the big screen.<br /><br />Descent/good movie with some Lol humor as well. 3.5 stars
B007VT6QSI|1.0|I am not a big Justin Bieber fan, but I bought this because he said he collaborated with Taylor Swift. When I opened the lyric sheet, none of the songs had Taylor Swift's name on it. I felt betrayed. I think Bieber only said it so some Taylor fans, like me, would buy his album. Beware Taylor Swift fans: There is no song written by Taylor Swift!
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so excited when they came out with kindle version. I really like how i can play with a much bigger screen than a smart phone. Overall: GREAT APP!<br />CAUTION: HIGHLY ADDICTIVE
B007NZDES0|5.0|I did not know about this item until I saw it on the shelf at Target. If you are even a 'casual' fan of Sade or even Sweetback (the band), this DVD will give you goosebumps. Sade's raspy voice is beautifully backed by the band from heaven. Seriously, the music they create is God-sent.  This is a must buy for any music lover. Top rate.<br /><br />My only complaint, the CD will not play on my computer. DVD works fine, but the CD simply is not recognized at all by my PC (iTunes, Windows Media Player, CyberLink, even right clicking on my D drive will not boot it). But I can live with it - the DVD is THAT great.
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is awesome, but there seems to be some sort of glitch where the game skips and then it doesn't register my touch, so I just fall off the edge or hit a tree and die.

B003VB5E2E|5.0|If you want a superb collection of all styles of blues then this is for you. You get old school and new school blues.  There are some amazing talents on this collection.  I like the informal format of the disc. It is like you are there in person. All the screw ups included. Most things with Eric Clapton involved tend to be great. This is a must have collection.

B0086QS7N2|5.0|Name another band that made what could be their best album after 38 years together.  Can't think of one?  Nor can I.  What was this album they made?  A progressive rock concept album.  In 2012.  Now, in a time where auto-tune is a given and no one is famous for more than a season, this trio made an album that could've climbed the charts just as easily in 1976.  And the lyrics?  A journey through a sprawling dystopian sci-fi world told with absolute sincerity.  Perhaps that's why the horn-rimmed hipster set branded them uncool. They don't know how to be ironic.  They just play great music and tell some honest and interesting stories with a point.  That's a shame, maybe if they'd sneered at the fantasy and wore skinny jeans they might be played at some parties in Silverlake or the East Village.  Maybe if they'd  burned themselves out in a blaze of excess and insanity after Hemispheres, they'd get into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  Nope, these guys (who are almost 60 and at the top of their game) just belted out what might be their best album in almost four decades.  To me, that's a big deal.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game is very fun, yet makes you think. There are no cheats so if you can't figure it out, you just reset or stop for a while and come back to see if you missed something. Very rewarding! Sometimes it gets frustrating when the boxes are so small that you can't help but hit the wrong ones, but that's my only complaint.

A thousand pages later, we're almost at war with Meereen.  This pretty much sums up how far all the plot lines go in this book.  Perhaps the most frustrating and obvious of the shaggy dog plot lines  is Tyrion.  He begins the book on his way to meet Daenerys, which will actually be interesting - and after a thousand pages - he's become a slave, broken away, become a mercenary and aided young Griff.  All of which might be interesting if this were book one, but all I want to see at this point is him meet Daenerys.  Really, would that have been too much?  On page 500?  Too Soon?  Nope, we'll save that for Book 6.<br /><br />  And young Griff?  He's a plot line introduced 4500 pages into the story and now becomes yet another obstacle to an ending.  We didn't even see Sansa in this book so we'll probably get 500 pages of Sansa and Littlefinger see-sawing in the Vale in Book 6.  Who cares?  And for those folks who demand to know why I kept reading if I was so annoyed, I kept reading because I'd already delved into 4000 pages and was hoping it was moving toward a conclusion since Martin pondered over this book for so long.  Not to mention the fact that Martin is a great writer.  His prose sucks you in, he wields suspense like Valyrian steel and his characters are deep.  Yet, all I felt at the end of this book was disappointment.<br /><br />  Great writer or not, his name should not be mentioned in the same breath as Tolkein.  Tolkein managed to tell a better story, in a deeper world using a third of the pages.  Heck, I actually liked \\"Feast,\\" but at this point, I honestly don't know if I'll pick up book 6. The only thing of significance in Dance happened at the very end when Jon Snow takes a knife in the back, ironically similar to the one Martin keeps twisting in mine.

B0061JPYX2|5.0|OK to be honest I never really was interested in Amy because she was a bit too much for me, until I heard her sing a duet of \\"Body & Soul\\" with Tony Bennett. LOVED IT! This is turn peaked my interest and I began to research her music. This CD is filled with a great line-up of old tunes with a reggae twist. I never thought Amy would be in my music library, but goes to show you, don't judge a book by it's cover!
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|my daughter is playing this game and if she doesn't guess correctly two people so far have called her swear word names including the f word..... this is so not necessary. this happened yesterday and today.<br />I am not sure how this could be monitored but people really need to have more class.
B007NZDES0|5.0|If you weren't able to go to this concert of the decade, then this DVD is an absolute must! I have always known of Sade, but for some strange reason I never really paid too much attention to her music. After I attended this concert, I was totally hooked. The very next day I bought-up everything and I mean everything, I could find on her. Her band is so very talented that you can feel the power coming forth from their instruments. This DVD is one I am sure you'll watch over and over again. Nothing compares to Sade's beauty and self-respect to create the wonderful music that she does so very well. This is a truly talented woman backed by the world's best musicians. I am definitely ready for my next dose of Sade!
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great workout video! It had been a couple years since I was serious about working out (trying to get rid of baby weight). Started at level 1 and after about 2 weeks, moved up to level 2. Both levels start out pretty challenging, but that's because I was out of shape :-p  Although after just a few days, my endurance was built up, and even though I was sweating like crazy, it wasn't as hard as it was at the beginning. I haven't lost much weight since starting it almost a month ago, but I can see my ab muscles making an appearance and inches all around my body have disappeared.  Can't wait to start level 3!! If you need a place to start working out, this is a great video. (and since I don't have hand weights and didn't want to buy any, I use 2 remote controls...still works!)
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|A very inspiring book.  Jaycee experienced some horrific conditions for 18 years, but came out a survivor who still sees the good in life and others.  What a wonderful example for us all!
B00884GR0W|3.0|I have yet to purchase this game as my Kindle Fire was broken over the last week (plus no money to buy the game at the moment.) I am currently waiting for my Staples gift card for the equivalent price to come in so I can pick up a new one. From what I have seen (and read from numerous reviews) it is essentially the look of Minecraft together with the RPG gameplay and elements of Skyrim.<br /><br />First, here is a little lesson for the idiots who posted that this game is a \\"rip-off\\" of Minecraft... What some people don't know though is that Minecraft was based off of Infiniminer. Block Story was based on nothing but the implemention of ideas from the developers which were inspired by other games. Yes, they BORROWED ideas from other games but they didn't take the idea and claim it as their own original idea. Just look at Uncharted (a prime example) versus Tomb Raider. Uncharted BORROWED alot from Tomb Raider, but wasn't a blatant rip-off of Tomb Raider. Call of Duty to Quake, CoD is BASED on the engine that ran Quake 3 Arena. That is why that game is so twitchy and fast paced. Was it a complete rip-off of Quake? NO! It BORROWED from the game, but didn't steal it and claim it as their own original idea. People who are inept to know a thing or two about what they CLAIM they are talking about should not even be allowed to post a review on Amazon, LET ALONE be allowed on the internet. To all of you idiots who call this a MC rip-off, think for a second instead of typing complete incoherent nonsense on a whim. Alright, now to the review.<br /><br />From the Youtube videos, trailers, and screenshots I have seen since discovering this game, it has intrigued me greatly. The concept is simple to grasp, and it is easy to play considering how the game is tailored to work with many different play styles. The graphics are very nice for a mobile phone/tablet game, and you can even change the settings if the game doesn't play how you need it to. The presentation of this game is topnotch; great trailers, much feedback from dev (not to mention quick updates,) lots of stuff to do, lots of enemies to fight, lots of items to buy/collect/craft. Overall, it looks like a great game but I will change my review when I can finally play the game for myself. This is just my review from what I have seen second hand. I can't give it any higher than 3 stars since I haven't been able to play myself. Once I get to play, and experience it to where I feel the need to edit this review, I will gladly do it with haste.<br /><br />-Zak
B0073PZIYI|4.0|\\"IN TIME\\" with Justin Timberlake: A very interesting concept for a movie. Starts out a little slow but soon makes up for it. Well worth the time spent watching. If you like movie's that are a little off the wall and make it a point for the underdog to come out on top, you will enjoy this movie. I have to admit I was a bit skeptical of just how good of and Actor Justin Timberlake might be but I have to admit I was very suprised as too how talented this young man can be.[[ASIN:B0073PZIYI In Time]]
034580404X|5.0|Omg!!! i felt like i was looking at a movie or a tv series when i read this collection.I am a avid reader and this collection was the best!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a really fun game I know I already like it and my kids will like it too. really worth the download.
B007NESBK2|5.0|Saw the concert in Arizona and it was great.  Wanted the DVD then but not available.  Getting it now was just what was needed.  Have enjoyed the show again and again. Excellent and you can really get into the grove over and over.
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|I saw the screenshots and I was like this crape is an epic game!! Brazil is the perfect place to show thugs beating up people, getting sweet revenge and stealing their cars as a forgiving method. But, I think I need a price drop before I convince my dad to give me leverage. If not... I LOVE YOU Gameloft!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I am VERY sensitive to noise of all kinds. I initially purchased White Noise Lite (which is free). Although it worked quite well, the free version only runs alone, which means you can't read a Kindle book at the same time you use White Noise Lite. I decided that a couple of bucks was a small price to pay to block out my boyfriend's rock band rehearsal while I read.<br /><br />There are so many great choices for noises on the White Noise app -- many more than on the free version. Although I like Pink Noise best while I'm trying to read, my favorite sound on this app is of a cat purring. I can't wait to play that one the next time I take a nap. I find the sound of a cat purring very relaxing and become instantly drowsy when I hear it. I am also thrilled that the next time I'm staying in a hotel where I can hear noises outside my room, I will be able to play a soothing sound from this app instead of suffering through the noise or spending a bunch of money on a white noise machine (which I have almost done many times).
0545265355|5.0|This was purchased for a gift.  The person who received it was very happy to get it.<br />That is why I gave it 5 stars.
B007T2XC7A|4.0|I liked it Norah sounds good as usual. what surprised me was how dark some of the song are. worth the money.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|Got this when it was the FAotD. Evo Shift. The UI and game play is very similar to the Sudoku feature on Nintendo DS \\"Brain Age\\" games.
B007VTVGFQ|5.0|So, now I am on my 3rd listen to \\"The Idler Wheel\\" (the real title is a long rhyming cuplet thing that probably only makes sense to Fiona). This is her first self-produced album, co-produced actually, with drummer Charley Drayton providing sparse, bumpy percussion beds (but no songwriting credit) for Fiona to pound her piano, sing, yell, pout, bitch, ponder and vent about (mostly) the shipwrecks of her relationships, both with her beaus and her own facets of self. Besides the sinewy indie production, the first thing that is apparent is that there is nothing as pretty and melodic as \\"Paper Bag\\", as sensual as \\"Slow Like Honey\\", or as \\"normal\\" in song structure as, say \\"Shadowboxer\\". The intensity is certainly there, but the dissonance, musically, that has always been a growing part of Apple's songs is pushed to the fore, with clustered chords and claustrophobic chromatic runs, often accompanied by raw-nerve lyrics and banging percussion.<br />Swordfishtrombones territory.<br />There's no denying the artistry. On the other hand, it's kind of an unsettling listen. You know when you wandered into that coffee house and they were doing some really intense poetry with conga drums and flute, and you recognised that it was probably genius, but it was offputting at the same time? Or that painting that you feel compelled to \\"get\\", even if you aren't getting it? Anyway, f##k me and all critics, the important thing is, be true to your art, and she has done that in spades. I doubt this album will supplant \\"When the Pawn\\" for me, but the songs are starting to grow on me. The opener, \\"Every Single Night\\" swoops and sways musically, and it is pretty melodic compared to the rest. The closing song, \\"Hot Knife\\" is overdubbed lavishly with frantic legions of chorus girls, assisted by Fiona's sister Maude Maggart, a professional singer in her own right. Elsewhere Fiona sounds for a minute like Annie Ross doing a rap.<br />The deluxe version contains a 7x5in CD booklet (which resembles aschool notebook-turned-diary) full of Fiona's artwork; line drawings of animals and people, watercolors, a couple of self-portraits, and the bizarre/groovy cover drawing, lyrics and a little poster. Also a couple of wtf postcards, and a DVD of her recent 5 song performance at SXSW (3 old songs, 2 new ones).
B000063DFS|5.0|the first 2 OZZY albuns are great, but for me this is BY FAR THE BEST moment from OZZY...the prince of darkness really bring a GREAT collection of songs on NO MORE TEARS...The title track is one of the greatest heavy metal songs ever, DESIRE, I DON´T WANT TO CHANGE THE WORLD and MAMA I´M COMMING HOME are metal gems!!!! The lyrics are AMAZING, and OZZY´s band really shine on NO MORE TEARS...GREAT ALBUM!!!If you enjoy OZZY OSBOURNE, this is THE PINACCLE of his legendary solo career!!!BRAVO, OZZY!!!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is awesome! It has a clean UI with nice colorful graphics and is easy to manipulate. Sure, the ads that appear at almost every point between games can get slightly annoying, but then I didn't pay for the app, so I am not complaining.
B000068QZK|4.0|NO REST FOR THE WICKED is a great album from OZZY, the prince of darkness...it´s also the debut of the great guitarrist ZAKK WYLDE...I really enjoy all the songs...if you like OZZY´s music, i think you will like this one...
B007D2XSW0|5.0|It works just fine on my droid x.  I can save the edited photo to my gallery and not to facebook or twitter as mentioned in other reviews as a problem.  I like some of the features, like layering pictures over other pictures, and one that lets you make one part of the picture sharp and the rest of the picture blurry.  It was really, really easy to use.  I like it so much that I parked it on my phone's homepage right next to the gallery so it will be easy to find.
B00005QIPH|4.0|IS THIS IT, The STROKES debut is BY FAR their best album...All the songs are nice...some classics like HARD TO EXPLAIN, LAST NIGHT and THE MODERN AGE...After this great album, the STROKES created more cool rock songs, but also A LOT of not so memorable ones and A LOT of fillers...
B000PMG16U|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my grandchilren and they LOVED the entire series. Their ages are 9 and 11.
B0000252YK|2.0|OZZY solo career is great...but in my opinion, this one ULTIMATE SIN, is by far the worst album from OZZY...besides the good title track, i really think the songs ARE TOTALLY UNINSPIRED....
B003WKOU0G|2.0|I'm not sure we learned anything new whatsoever about birth, child development, parenting, or even foreign cultures.  Personally I found the music to be extremely intrusive, spoiling many moments that did work.  Why not just focus on the gentle sounds of the babies and family members?  Finally, the 3 mothers (and one pathetic dad) chanting and singing \\"the earth will take care of us she is our mother\\" again and again cast a long shadow of absurdity...it being a clumsy, shallow \\"message\\" in a film that otherwise takes care not to force feed us messages.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|i love this app. it gives you so many games! fun and easy, great app! good for kids. only wish you could go to the game from the instruction page.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|I ordered these for my birthday and was disappointed when I saw that it could take a month to get them, but they arrived in just a few days! I was so pleasantly surprised! They are beautiful cards, the artwork is amazing and the color is flawless. An absolute must have fore any Legend of Zelda fan, like me! I don't know if I'll ever actually use them though. They were more of a collector's item for me.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Love this! Have spent WAY too much time bagging. I actually think about this game while loading actual groceries in my truck.
B005MYEQ4U|2.0|In a word - disappointing.  The usual Woody Allen character appears again with the usual dialog.  This time the actor is directed to imitate Woody because Woody would be too old to play the part.  While the cinematography of Paris was excellent and the story line intriguing at times, the Woody character has become such a cliché that it needs to be left behind in his future movies.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|Epik game. Funner with full version. Great strategy game. I play it a lot. Fun.<br />Terrific. You should play this game.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|I finally got it for kindle fire. you can choose how many messages you want to display. it is free.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is awesome! you can never get tired of it because there are so many games and when you run out you can just unlock more!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|i was actually looking forward to using this free app of the day but it wont install on my kindle fire. it says corrupted file.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is great.  I just downloaded it to my kindle and it works the way is should.I also like that it saves my history so I can go back and look at what I calculated.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|The bag was a little smaller than I expected, but nonetheless I am definitely satisfied with the purchase. So much so I ordered my father one!
B000W93CHC|2.0|\\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" was a better read. This second book is reaching out there and not connecting. It should have been called \\"Book Without End\\". Hackneyed characters. Stereotypes.  Tear-jerking. All there, and used to little literary merit.Sad. Save your money unless you are stuck in an airport.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A very simple plain old calculator without the bells and whistles. Percentage works like my old handheld. I love this app!
B0052RDHTM|3.0|This is a typical Follet novel...solid and well researched, but not a work of art.  One step above the usual weak trash on the best sellers list.  Will I read the next two in the trilogy? Yes. Good entertainment.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|This is such a subpar app!! I've been using PicSay Pro for months and it is great! Saves at high res and has so many more options than this app even dreams of. FREE photoshop editor has more....Pass on this there are much better options out there.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|I bought this amplifier to help eliminate the ambient noise I hear when working out at the gym.  It does exactly that and I couldn't be happier.  Additionally, it's so lightweight that it doesn't bother me at all during my workout.<br /><br />It's a great product at a great price.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this product was very fun and entertained for children under throb thrush fith fit friend good great awesome tan yellow purple blue
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Let me start by saying that I had (along with my girlfriend) the opportunity to see this amazing band playing live in Sao Paulo, Brazil, on June 2nd (a forever memorable Saturday night). The concert we saw was, in fact, heavier than the one recorded for this DVD, as there were neither special participations (hey, nothing wrong with that), nor acoustic songs. What we had, as a special treat, was a drum solo by this great drummer (I got a drum stick for my collection).<br />Just to give you an idea, he played stunning versions of \\"Song Of Yesterday\\" (from the first BCC album) and \\"Sloe Gin\\".<br />About the DVD, I don't want to sound repetitive, so I recommend you read some previous five stars reviews let by other costumers, which are all complete and/or detailed reviews. That said, stop wasting your time and find yourself a way of bringing this wonderful concert to your home. You won't regret it!<br />About Joe (from whom I got a guitar pick for my collection), he is the best \\"guitar character\\" that appeared in the music business in the last ten years. I hope he will know how to deal with all the compliments he is receiving recently (all deserved, I must say!). We don't want to lose you, JOE! YOU'RE THE MAN!
B004T2QZL8|5.0|This the best game I played i love it. I cant stop playing it every tell me it great and I try it it is
B0054JZC6E|5.0|everyone should get this app its amazing .why? Because it has fun games that are sometimes a challenge, but once you beat the score it gets easy.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Let me start by saying that I have been counting down the seconds until this movie was released for over a year. I had an actual day, hour, minute and second countdown running a month before the movie came out. For the week leading up to the release I was doodling A's everywhere and watching every trailer I could get my hands on: even ones in languages I did not understand. Because my *interest* in the movie was so apparent I was asked by almost everyone I knew if I was building my expectations up too high and if I would be disappointed. It got to the point where I almost became worried of this idea myself. However, The Avengers not only reached my expectations: it far out stripped them. I was in love the moment I exited the theater and have seen the movie 4 times since. This is a movie I would recomend to anyone. For me, it is character that makes a story. It is the reason I watch Bones, not because of the crime scenes- I couldn't care less who murdered who and why- I watch for the character interactions. And character interactions are the foundation of The Avengers. Even after five viewings I still laugh out loud. Even if superhero films are not your taste, even if you are a DC fan all the way, no matter who, when, or where you are: I feel that everyone should experience The Avengers.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app and it's FREE!  Totally unexpected, greatly appreciated!  Very easy to use. Touch screens are tricky and the keys are large enough that I don't push two at a time.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|A wonderful story told from the perspective of the family dog.  This novel will make you laugh and will make you cry.  You don't even have to be a race-car fan; the book is entertaining and shares many life lessons that only a wonderful dog can teach us.
B004EPYZUS|5.0|I'm no real fan of Tom Cruise but I did like the story line, all the action scenes...at one point, my hands were perspiring when he was climbing the tallest building in the world in Dubai...you have to see this movie to appreciate...
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is a very well written mystery with lots of suspense.  It brings up all kinds of ethical dilemmas for the father, in particular.  Once into the story, difficult to put down.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I bought this dvd and at first it kicked my butt, I am now on day 9to and its getting easier. I can already see a difference! The only downside I found is that workout 2 is way easier than workout one. It has less jumping around which hurts my knees. Over all i love this dvd!
B007D2XSW0|1.0|I know this is free today and even tho it had a lot of bad reviews I wanted to try it....<br />Uninstalled already. Im have a samsing exhibit ii and it couldnt even load one photo from my gallery to play around with to see if I did like it. I even took a new pic with my camera inside the program and it didnt load for editing. Very sad because I was very excited....
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is addictive.  The only thing is that it does take time to create your village if you do not purchase any additional coins or acorns

B0054JZC6E|5.0|it entertains me all of the time... that is not easy to do. the games are fun but they could use more directions and could tell you a ranking of hard medium or easy:) I love the games though. you should buy it. this is coming from an 13 year old.
B007D2XSW0|1.0|The app seemingly starts but never opens a picture. Perhaps limited to operating on a limited number of devices but description should then say so. Fail (DROIDX)
B007D2XSW0|5.0|It's perfect for little adjustments and changes to all your photos. It even has a meme creator. Just try to have fun with it!
B007D2XSW0|4.0|Seems to work for me. All features work. Try it, it is free so it is at least with a shot. With downloading even with issues just to have. Apparently an update is due soon. Sensation 4G CM9.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Great keyboard does everything perfect. Haven't had one single problem.. Better then android stock. Thats why it got 5 stars.
0439023483|5.0|As an adult, I picked up this book because I wanted to read it before I saw the movie.  I thought the writing style was a little juvenile, but am not faulting the book/writer since it is a book for YA.  That said, I did thoroughly enjoy it and found it to be my favorite of the 3 books in the series.  I recommended it to my YA niece (12 years old) as well as my brother-in-law, who is in his 30s and they both really enjoyed it as well.
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|I had not heard of this series until the show was first being filmed and it was recommended to me by my brother (a long time fan of the book series).  I watched the first couple episodes and fell in love; I think the show is fantastic.  The writing and acting are superb.  It even inspired me to read the book series (I'm in the 4th out of the 5 that are out now).  I'm quite impressed with how true to the book the first season is--something you don't find too often.  I would recommend this to fans of the books and well as those who are fans of the genre and similar things like the Lord of the Rings.
B002BWP49C|5.0|So I'm not going to write what the movie is about because this already has enough of those reviews.  I will say that this one and the first one are my favorite of the movies so far.  I'm excited about part II and hope it is as good.  Good to add to your collection if you already have the others in the series, but obviously would be weird to buy as a stand-alone movie.
0345803485|2.0|I wanted to see what all the hype was about... it was difficult to get into the first few chapters because the writing is stilty and does not flow.  The plot is a little one dimensional, though it gets better once the action starts.  I will say at times I was inspired to rev up my love life with my husband, but all in all, I feel like the book was a waste of my time.  I don't like either of the main characters and you dont get to know any other characters all that well.  The author is also very repetitive with the blushing and biting lips and so forth.  The author needs a few classes on writing and so does the editor.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! It is so addictive. I would give it a 6/5 stars if I could. Soooooo glad it came out for kindle.
0061122416|3.0|Okay, everyone, click your heels and repeat after me, \\"There's no place like home.  There's no place like home.\\"  Are we back in Kansas yet?
B003Y5H4Y8|3.0|THE DEBT is more of a psychological thriller than an action thriller. The action simply provides the bedrock for the psychodrama. THE DEBT is a remake of a 2007 Israeli film which was rather different.<br /><br />The acting in THE DEBT is excellent, particularly that of Jessica Chastain as the younger Rachel. Chastain is a talented actress who, though she has appeared in many films, has fortunately managed to avoid celebrity. Helen Mirren, who plays the older Rachel turns in her usual work of stellar caliber.<br /><br />It is 1965. Stefan, David and Rachel are Mossad agents tasked to capture the Mengele-esque \\"Surgeon of Birkenau,\\" a Dr. Vogel, who is living inconspicuously in East Berlin, practicing gynecology twenty years after escaping justice for his war crimes of useless and horrifying medical experiments on Auschwitz inmates.<br /><br />They capture Dr. Vogel but when they attempt to sneak him \\"over the wall\\" into West Berlin things go badly awry, and so the three agents are forced to care for him while awaiting extraction. Realizing that his captors have become as much a set of prisoners as he himself, the wily Vogel (who is an unrepentant Nazi to the core) begins to torment them psychologically; eventually, he makes his escape.<br /><br />Recriminations fly back and forth. Finally, Stefan convinces David and Rachel to agree to the story that they killed Dr. Vogel while he was trying to escape. Eventually, they are extracted, and return to Israel as heroes, where they are feted and invited to speak publicly about their successful mission.<br /><br />Thirty-odd years pass. Stefan is now head of the Mossad. Stefan and Rachel have been married and divorced, and have a daughter who is a notable Israeli journalist. Their daughter writes their memoirs which become an international best-seller.<br /><br />At the same time that their daughter's book comes to print, a Ukrainian journalist announces that he has gotten an exclusive interview with a old man claiming to be the Surgeon of Birkenau. Rachel, Stefan and David's thirty-five year old lie begins to unravel. How they deal with that unraveling and the consequences they face make up the kernel of THE DEBT.<br /><br />I didn't like THE DEBT. I can't appreciate films where the motives and motivations of the characters get twisted into Turkish Taffy by dint of their own stupidity. There's something pathetic about watching intelligent people knowingly sticking their feet into bear traps, and that's what we have here. THE DEBT's biggest failing is the moral relativism of its characters. Dr. Vogel is the only character who seems to have the courage of his convictions, however twisted they may be. What I kept asking myself as THE DEBT played out was why the three agents simply didn't kill Vogel after their first botched extraction attempt. In the end, their lie, made true, would have been a better resolution than the self-imposed unresolvable ethical morass in which they lived their lives.e the Surgeon of Birkenau.

0811879542|5.0|I was a bit skeptical about this book, but the reviews sold it. And they were right! My son has asked us to read it to him at least twice a day since we got it last week. Amazing how such a simple concept can be more entertaining than many of his interactive electronic apps. I also like that this book helps with counting, following direction, and pattern recognition.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Its been a long time since I absolutely could not put down a book and I do not read \\"sci-fi.\\"  My daughter-in-law recommended \\"Wool\\" and I was between books so decided to give it a try (with skepticism).  First of all, the story is unique; if I had to make a comparison it would be Animal Farm but that doesn't even come close.  There are so many twists and turns I had difficulty finding a spot to take a break.  Secondly, Mr. Howey develops characters with depth and a certain degree of economy that would seem to be in opposition but are not.  I cared about all the characters, whether I loved them or hated them.  I especially appreciate the fact that no one was totally good or totally evil, which make them seem so real.  Their struggles to survive, to find and maintain friendships, and to find meaning in their lives would make excellent topics for discussion in a sociology class.  Finally, this was just an enjoyable reading experience.  I stayed up late, got up early, read in the car, and even standing at the kitchen counter cooking dinner.  There was not one \\"dead\\" spot in the entire book, nothing I felt like skimming over.  I am going to read every book this author has written and will watch for him in the future.  Wow!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|The plastic on this part seems different to the feel from the original which had a problem with breaking down.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|As soon as you hear \\"Feet don't fail me now . . .\\" sung in that gorgeously sedated voice, you are transposed into Born To Die, a netherworld of angst-ridden privileged youth, circa Anytime America, where the grass is greener on the other side but may contain horrific vermin crawling closely underneath.  Imagery, I believe, is everything in Pop music and Lana Del Rey has mastered this concept without having a gang of male dancers wagging behind her.  Her imagery is quite old-fashioned: through her sweetly nihilistic lyrics, which paint vast portraits in ways that can only be described as poetic, evoking powerful feelings and desires with familiar phrases and repeated words, as if conjuring up a past life you'd forgotten about.  With Born To Die, Lana Del Rey has crafted one of the most brilliant Pop albums of the last decade and yet this is only her debut.<br /><br />Borrowing lines and sayings from spirituals and hymns against a muted trip-hop beat, \\"Born To Die\\" manages to align the moodiness of aimless adolescence with the heartbreak of religious redemption.  The sumptuousness of the chorus is broken for a breakdown of strings and breathless cooing, a combination which mimics romantic delirium and post-coital bliss.  There is also something very longing and yearning in the way Lana says \\"So...\\" as if she does not completely believe what she is saying though feels it is too late to change her mind.<br /><br />This tinge of vulnerability, however, is quickly demolished on the free-wheeling, bass-heavy \\"Off To The Races,\\" which is without a doubt my favorite song on the album.  Here she plays a ruthless, self-destructive gold-digger, who may do too many drugs but will at least stand by her equally-corrupt \\"old man\\" till \\"the end.\\"  Mixing Nabokov (\\"light of my life/fire of my loins\\") with the decadent ramblings of a Hollywood princess (\\"likes to watch me in the glass room bathroom, Chateau Marmont/slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup\\"), Lana crafts one of the most rhythmically incredible Pop songs ever created.  Her dictation with each short description becomes hypnotic and driven with an almost maddening switch from drunken-drawl to seductive-squeal, eventually erupting into a booming orchestral cave of paranoia.<br /><br />Drifting out of the cave, we hear the opening guitar twangs of \\"Blue Jeans,\\" which immediately hark back to an older time and is only confirmed through the girlish recitation of her Valley Girl love letter to her bad-ass boyfriend, who is \\"so fresh to death/and sick as cancer\\" (Oh, that infectious emphasis on the \\"c\\"!).  With the combined mention of sweaters and hip hop, Lana creates a seamless connection between the past and the present, coming off like Ann-Margret if she had grown up listening to Biggie Smalls.  This is doubled in the colossally-epic \\"Video Games,\\" which is the most modern ballad I've heard and the most passionate expression of millennial ennui.  Never has anyone displayed the need for a person's attention because of their gaming addiction in such a operatic, sympathetic manner, while also making lines like \\"I say you the bestest\\" sound like Whitman.<br /><br />On the cool \\"Diet Mountain Dew,\\" Lana brings herself firmly into the 21st century with a driving hip-hop beat and a vampy flavor that recalls summertime in urban sprawls.  \\"Do you think we'll be in love forever?\\" she asks with an almost disinterested glee.  \\"Do you think we'll be in love?\\"  Yet this wonderland of highway confessions and dime-store kisses is quickly replaced by the golden hues of \\"National Anthem,\\" a merging of classicism and rap that tells the story of a social climber, first masquerading as a novice and then revealing herself as an experienced virtuoso.  As she stretches the word \\"ovation\\" into an almost staccato dreamscape, Lana embodies a young siren, enveloping you with her smoothness and finishing you off with a reminder that \\"money is the anthem.\\"<br /><br />\\"Dark Paradise\\" is the beginning of whatI perceive to be a quartet of croon-flavored torch songs, illustrating a collection of memories through melodies once sung by the song's narrator's former lover.  \\"Nothing compares to you,\\" she pleads, hinting at an equally-tortured vocalist from a couple decades ago, though Lana seems darker and more ethereal, as if a ghost recounting glorious moments.  Darkness, however, is nowhere to be found in the profanely sugary \\"Radio\\" which patches a standard rags-to-riches concept with an innovative, wispy production of bright, childish swells and loose thumps.  \\"Not even they can stop me now,\\" she drawls with a mix of confidence and posturing, before altogether losing her cool as she rejoices in how happy her life has become \\"sweet like cinnamon.\\"<br /><br />The other two songs in the torch-quartet, \\"Carmen\\" and \\"Million Dollar Man\\" both mesh into each other, as if sung by the same lounge singer in the same smoky bar on the same night.  While \\"Carmen\\" has the toughened hiccups of a pill-popping spotlighter with its fractured fairy tale lyrics of misplaced fame and even more misplaced addiction, \\"Million Dollar Man\\" evokes the heartbroken hang-ups of a confident dreamer, still holding onto love that has expired long ago, something all too familiar to many of us.  When Lana says \\"You're so screwed up and brilliant,\\" she is holding onto a fantasy of her emotions, though also thinking of how much time she's wasted on this person.<br /><br />That wasted time is only amplified on the apocalyptic, 90's-flavored \\"Summertime Sadness,\\" which creates a sun-streaked haze of cotton-mouth kisses and reckless abandon against a romance that may never again be as darling as it was before.  \\"Kiss me hard before you go/summertime sadness/I just wanted you to know/that baby yudda best\\" she echoingly mutters out as if privately chanting about the end of the world into a Coke bottle.  Her girlish-yelp is prominent here as she tumultuously says goodbye, only to lead to an even bigger farewell on \\"This Is What Makes Us Girls,\\" her ode to the banalities of small-town life and the finale of the album.  As she recounts her misadventures with a group of girls she barely really liked but realizes \\"were the only friends\\" she \\"ever had,\\" the entire cohesion of the record comes full-circle.  The nostalgic, shivering feeling of her voice combined with the Baroque production, brilliantly closes the concept kicked off by \\"Born To Die\\": that utter maddening longing and yearning for an ideal that maybe never really was.<br /><br />With its complex fatalism and perfect quality, Born To Die is one of those delicious albums that are so well-crafted, you almost feel that you can eat them, proving that Lana Del Rey has managed to successfully weave her bumpy upper-middle-class upbringing into a perplexing piece of Pop that sparks and crackles with freshness.  This is Pop as art, Pop as fun, Pop as philosophy.  And I couldn't ask for anything more.
B00821OW8K|2.0|This was kind of a let down.  I expected more from a Stephen Speilberg event.  It was just a typical alien vs. human drama.  Wish there had been more of a unique plot.  Tiresome
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I had heard that this book was good (recommended repeatedly by Rothfuss and others), but wasn't sure what to expect.  So I was fairly ambivalent.  Put it on my list and eventually added my name to the long queue from the library.  When it finally came up yesterday, I had a couple minutes so thought I'd just cast a glance at the first few pages. . .<br /><br />Big Mistake.<br /><br />Get the book friends, but don't even crack it unless you've got a couple of uninterrupted days to stay plugged in to the OASIS.<br />Nuff said.
B004WR2WAS|5.0|As usual, Sam and Dean snap another hit.  I just love these brothers.  Their adventures are funny, heartfelt, scary, on the edge of your seat masterpieces!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|When I saw \\"This is It\\" in theaters the first time, not even 5 minutes into it I started to cry. Michael meant the world to me. His whole personality made me feel so happy because he was always a nice person. He truly was an angel sent from heaven. When amazon had this DVD as a pre-order I knew I had to get it and I didn't regret it either. If you're as big a fan of MJ as I am, I would definitely recommend this to have in any Michael Jackson Collection.<br /><br />It does pain me to watch it because every time I do, I still get quite upset and want to cry knowing that he's gone. Although his legacy and all the good he did for the world and the entertainment he engraved into each generation after him will live on forever. Long Live The one and the ONLY King of Pop MJJ 1958-2009.
B0051CSIKQ|4.0|I will start by disagreeing with the low raters of this film. It is not a sleeper, it does have a story, the acting is solid, special effects are as good as any multimillion dollar movie. The characters let you in just enough to relate to them. Although it is about vampires, it is more the lazy stupid vampires. A cross between a vampire and a zombie, on the other hand a vampire is nothing more than a zombie anyway right. Also too many younger viewers are addicted to CGI effects, the really good special effects films don't needs CGI, this is one of them.<br /> Doesn't matter anyway, the details of the spread vampire-ism are left low key, we've all seen enough vampire/zombie movies to figure those details, the story lies the the survival of this small group. Yes that kind of story has been told a few times, but as with any movie, the characters make the movie, and these characters do make the movie.<br /> There's a few pop up scares, enough blood for the gore lovers but not too much. You will see remnants of films like \\"28 days later\\", \\"30 days of night\\", \\"I am Legend\\", \\"The Postman\\", yes I said The Postman, just some hints of it, simply because The Postman id a movie that has heart & emotion for the characters as well as action, the country side landscapes and visiting town to town give the feeling of that one.<br />  I didn't rate this one 5 stars simply because I disliked the ending, Its not a bad ending, I just prefer a different way of concluding movies like this. Never the less, you will enjoy the movie.
B0012C7ET0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy listening to Stevie Nicks. Her friendly voice never disappoints me, and I always like her music. She has a unique voice that brings a special quality to her singing.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|I absolutely love this book!<br /><br />I rate this book as follows:<br /><br />Love interest: 5<br /><br />Subcharacters: 5<br /><br />Writing: 5<br /><br />Romantic Plot: 5<br /><br />Overall: 5
B001PO53IO|5.0|Muy buena calidad, de acuerdo a lo que esperaba, el arribo fue en el plazo indicado mas aún considerando que estoy en Chile
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This must be fun to not want this app for yourselves. I really love this game very much and it is learning how to draw better.
B002N8A14M|5.0|The title says it all. I mostly just use the clip but the armband works well too. The clip stays on my shorts nice and tight and doesn't move when I run! Great product for an older ipod
B00785P2QC|4.0|its a fun game.  helps pass up time when just chilling byurself or waiting for something to be done. like that you can still do a lot of things with out having to use real money.
0143106287|5.0|BOUGHT IT FOR MY ENGLISH CLASS IN COLLEGE AND FELL IN LOVE WITH IT. FULL OF DRAMA!!! I DOODLED WITH ALL KINDS OF NOTES AND HIGHLITES INSTANTLY BECAUSE I FELL IN LOVE WITH SOME OF THE WORDING AND QUOTE-WORTHY PHRASES IN THIS BOOK. VERY CHALLENGING BUT ALSO EDGE-OF-YOUR-SEAT TAKING. FOR AUSTEN'S LAST BOOK, THIS WAS A MASTERPIECE!
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I truly enjoy this movie for its intriguing plot and complex characters. This movie is about self discovery and how choices made in one's life affect everything, with the gay theme just one of the factors in the main character's life. Great writing and actors, and beautiful music. Definitely worth watching!
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I PURCHASED THIS TO SEE WHAT EXACTLY I WAS EATING BEFORE THAT WASN'T HEALTHY FOR ME. AND BOY, IS THAT EXACTLY WHAT I GOT OR WHAT!!! I AM NOW A PESCETARIAN.. AND ALTHOUGH SOME SCENES IN HERE SHOW THAT EVEN SEAFOOD ISN'T EXACTLY TRUST-WORTHY ANY LONGER EITHER, I STILL AM KNOWLEDGED THAT IT IS STILL HEALTHIER THAN EVERYTHING THAT WAS SHOWN HERE. ORGANIC PRODUCTS ARE THE WAY TO GO!!!!!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a very entertainingly funny game. I'm happy to play each night before I go to bed. definitely relaxing
B007HO392S|5.0|Another great hit CD. She is so talented and such a super person. She has a true niceness about her. Love her music.
0062183591|5.0|This is Dan Ariely's third book.  It is easily as rich and entertaining as his two prior books and I highly recommend it, particularly to business leaders.  If you're a follower of Dan's work, much of the early stuff in the book will be familiar, but it gets better.  Here's what the book is about: \\"...we are all capable of cheating, and we are very adept at telling ourselves stories about why, in doing so, we are not dishonest or immoral.  Even worse, we are prone to \\"catch\\" the cheating bug from other people, and once we start acting dishonestly, we are likely to continue misbehaving that way.\\" P. 246
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This has to be the number 1 sci-fi TV show of all time next to star trek.  I have become a die hard member of the verse and it is a gorram shame that this show was cancel, rutting FOX.  I love the fact that you do not have to be a sci-fi nerd, like myself, to love this show.  If you like Nathan Phillion on Castle you will love him in Firefly. Plus there are several references to this series in Castle.  The firefly cast brings Whedon's universe to life.  The chemistry of the chararters is a perfect combination of funny and endearing.  The comedic banter is flawless and once you start watching you won't want to stop.  I would also recommend watching the Serenity movie which takes place 18 months after this series starts and helps to complete Whedon's story.  For all you Browncoats, keep flying.
B005I6EVUG|2.0|I thought this case looked awesome, however after a few months its already broken. I am rather disappointed considering the cost of this case.
0061655554|4.0|Barbarians at the Gate is one of the best business books I've ever read. It rings true now as it did 20 years ago when the RJR Nabisco LBO took place. The knowledge you acquire from reading the book should be a prerequisite in business, financial and law schools. It should be a constant reminder for us of the impact of greed and money on human behavior. It should also help us be critical of our own actions and how these may affect others, industries and the way business is done. Great read.
B008ALA6DW|5.0|The adapter required a few MacOS updates on my machine before it worked. So it may not work out of the box for you. That said, the updates were easy. Just plug in the adapter and update over wireless using Apple Software Update.<br /><br />Got transfer rates of 50MB/s copying large files to the Macbook Air. I'm using older Intel NICs without jumbo frame support and relatively slow disks on my servers. So you may get better performance from faster disks and newer network cards. That said, I'm happy with the performance because it's as good as any other box on my network.
0439023521|4.0|The Hunger games are more than fiction. They represent a possible view of the world a possible scenario and maybe that's why they became popular. A stark reminder of close situations like what is happening in some parts of Africa or in North Korea. When you are forced to do things you don't want to and pushed to be a person you never wished. Great read.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|This app works really well I don't know why people were saying it wouldn't access the gallery. It worked just fine for me. I  love all the different effects you can choose. Was surprised at how well this app was for an average rating. I am just glad I got this as a free app of the day. SCORE!!! (Using a kindle fire)

B005KP7D96|5.0|I became addicted to this show late in the season.  By the time I had viewed three episodes, the beginning of Season I had vanished from ON DEMAND.  I purchased this episode and the others as Amazon instant videos. It was money well spent. The episodes can stand alone to a certain extent, but there are some continuing plot developments among the main characters.  This is quality television indeed--great script, great acting, entertaining.
B0086700CM|5.0|addicting! and I absolutely love this game yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea yea
B004FP1WX0|1.0|This is a film which is able to combine bad photography and annoying Internet social networking. Nev Schulman (Nev Schulman) is being filmed as the topic of someone filming someone. And we know it is real because they start off with a close up of him eating. He meets a family from upstate Michigan on-line (he lives in NYC) and they hit it off really well as they communicate on Facebook, text, and he breaks down and makes a few phone calls. The 8 year old girl paints, the older daughter records music, and mom is a hottie too.<br /><br />Driving back from Colorado, and congrats to all of you that make it this far into the film, they decide to detour to Michigan to meet the people who he has had an on-line relationship. All is not what it seems. And while there is a twist, rest assure the boredom doesn't end. At this point the movie would have been better if the family wore fake looking rubber masks and were cannibals.<br /><br />When a DVD cover must use single words cut out of a review to promote itself, that generally means they couldn't use the whole statement without making themselves look bad. Intrigue? Suspense? Provocative? Give me a break.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No words sex, or nudity. Adult sex talk.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|As a fan of nonfiction I found this book to be perfect for me.  There was mystery and suspense as well as a well written story.  It held my interest from page one.  It also showed a part of China I was not very familiar with.  Interesting how police react to certain situations. Couldn't wait to find out who was responsible for the crimes.
B000I8HIR2|5.0|Based on a video game, this is without a doubt one of the top horror movies of all time. A woman (Radha Mitchell) goes into a town to locate her adopted daughter (Jodelle Ferland), who has a past connection to said town. As she looks for her daughter the film intensifies as we keep asking ourselves what is going on?<br /><br />The movie includes weird inner dimension Sci-Fi stuff as well as horror movie tension. I was on the edge of my chair the whole time. Great horror movie to build the evening around. Lots of conflict because it was a video game first. Don't pay more than $5.00 for a new copy.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, you can't go wrong.<br /><br />F-bombs, no sex, near nudity.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I used it to make collages of one direction and it world good. except for the fact tht some of the pics come up blury. u shud really get this app. it is very cool and also it can be a game for children.
B002GYI96U|4.0|I really loved this book.  Once I started, I could not put it down.  I loved how the minor characters were so well developed-all having their own issues that later tied into the overall plot.  The writing was detailed and well thought out.  The nain character is a sympathetic character.  The ending was what I was hoping for and so much more.  I great read that will make you smile!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Love it. This games is Mario with a twist! Very easy to play and very fun to play. I would recommend it.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The app will not load on my seven inch android 2.2 tablet.  Amazon MP3 will, but not the Kindle app.
B005LAIIS0|1.0|I did not like the movie if I would have knowing that is was about that kind of thing I would have not gotten it<br />I would like to send it back. I have watched it 1 time and will not watch it again.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Better than you'd think. I'm loving the logic and challenge here. Solve the puzzles and create an image! If you like logic puzzles, connect-the-dots, or sudoku you'll love this.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun but hard I play it all of the time I love it because it keeps me busy and I never get bored with it mad but not bored :)
0345529057|5.0|I only wish they came with time to read 1000 page books.<br />Once you get past what the HBO show has shown, the books feel quite a bit different.
B00005JKNF|2.0|We love British movies and TV shows, but this movie is very dull and slow paced. I went to sleep watching it. Maggie Smith is always brilliant and was the bright spark of the movie. A little like Downton Abby, but with a very weak plot.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|this is a fun and challenging app I played on my brothers i-pod and I immediately bought it for kindle fire
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Some of the games are fun, but the instructions on some are rather vague - like the oil well game. I don't understand what I'm supposed to do or how to do it.
B0078JOAOI|5.0|Honestly when you really love a show nothing can make it seem wrong. This was another episode to add to the plot of the show. I really can't wait till season 3

1567184855|3.0|Atheism, abortion, deja vu, soulmates, aliens, after life, racism, homosexuality, painful childhood...questions we all have on these and other topics are compellingly explored, some even answered in this collection of case studies by a professional hypnotherapist who discovered a breakthrough technique that opened the doors to our \\"life between lives.\\"<br /><br />For me personally, the most satisfying quality of Dr. Newton's work is that it confirms everything that I have been taught by my own spiritual teacher, Barbara Martin, author of [[ASIN:0970211813 Change Your Aura, Change Your Life: A Step-by-Step Guide to Unfolding Your Spiritual Power]] and [[ASIN:1585428167 Karma and Reincarnation: Unlocking Your 800 Lives to Enlightenment]].<br /><br />Dr. Newton is not a spiritual teacher, nor does he have a direct connection with the higher so the information he gives us in this book is not from his own firsthand experience, as Barbara Martin's work is. In fact, he frankly admits to having been a cynical personality and convinced atheist (his discoveries chronicled in this book changed that).<br /><br />However, lacking this direct connection and a true spiritual teacher's concerns for allowing us to learn how to connect with our own higher self and thereby find the answers for ourselves (not to mention their desire to avoid interfering with or taking on some of our karma), Dr. Newton has no qualms about sharing all the tiniest and juiciest of details. Things a true spiritual teacher will not because they will only distract you from the path, but they are entertaining!<br /><br />All the information he shares with us he unabashedly and mercilessly extracted from the subconscious recollections of his patients while they were under hypnosis. It is a thrilling read. And if your faith was lagging or a sense of purpose in life was eluding you, you will find this work inspiring. It is a nice intro into a more serious pursuit of the path. You will need to look elsewhere for practical tools.<br /><br />My favorite part is on our relationships to our teachers (guides) and our soul groups.<br /><br />There are some things, being only a hypnotherapist with no direct personal experience, that he cannot explain such as the qualities and meaning of the aura, working directly with divine light through meditation, healing with spirit substance, spiritual protection, Lord Christ vs. Jesus Christ, etc. And if you are interested in these topics I strongly recommend the two titles mentioned above. But if you are interested in experiencing your own Life Between Lives, you can go to Dr. Newton's website and find a local hypnotherapist trained in this technique.ractical tools.<br /><br />My favorite part is on our relationships to our teachers (guides) and our soul groups.<br /><br />There are some things, being only a hypnotherapist with no direct personal experience, that he cannot explain such as the qualities and meaning of the aura, working directly with divine light through meditation, healing with spirit substance, spiritual protection, Lord Christ vs. Jesus Christ, etc. And if you are interested in these topics I strongly recommend the two titles mentioned above.

B001FD5KJM|3.0|I barely made it all the way through this movie.  It's too predictable and kind of boring in my opinion.  I guessed a few lines correctly before the actors and/or actresses spoke.  lol  That's how predictable it is.  I'll take \\"Dark Knight\\" over this any day.

B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book is a compelling story of heroism and four heros, including the author, who fought a terrible battle in Afghanistan on June 28, 2005.  It is also about the sixteen other heroes who came to their rescue.<br /><br />The story starts with a background about the author and his twin brother who is also a Navy Seal.  Then it continues on to provide the details of Navy Seal training.  \\"Hell Week\\" is described and it is brutal.  No wonder these men are the most effective fighting men in the world today.  And, the training continues on and on, after they are a Navy Seal and then when they get ready for their missions.  This emphasis on training and the challenges of being a Navy Seal shows that this job is hardly glorious and romantic, but very important to the defense of our country.<br /><br />The book continues on to the main reason for the story.  The battle for Murphy's Ridge and the survival afterwards.  I won't go into that so that I don't ruin this for the potential reader.  But, the action is non-stop, and I couldn't put the book (actually my Kindle) down.  And, the morale dilemma that the men faced that caused the battle is something that we should NEVER put our men through.<br /><br />In short, I agree with the author's opinion of liberals and the liberal media and can understand why he gets on his stoop about this from time to time.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for an American who is proud of our country and the fighting men that defend us.

B007SYWFRM|4.0|Its a good game but hard to do some challenges with no friends and waiting a long time to finish some because u have to spend money!!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Great app. Very user friendly, all in one photo editing. Best one I have used thus far. A little pricey, but worth it.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|drawsome is awesome.its a great game you can play with your friends. you draw then guss what they draw.you would like it if you like drawing games
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great series leave you sad that you no longer will be able to spend time with those characters you feel you've gotten to know, built friendships with, and actually care for their well being.  Wool is definitely one of those, and after just having finished it (about 5 minutes ago) I was relieved that there was a 6th installment of the series out.  I can't wait to see how Juliette and crew end up!<br /><br />Although the whole book was great, of the whole series, the first one left the biggest impression, and it's probably one of those stories that I will remember for the rest of my life.
B0080R7P8A|5.0|Okay, here it is an a nutshell: if you are a fan of Can, this is a no-brainer. For a new fan, I would say start elsewhere (maybe Ege Bamyasi or Unlimited Edition), but for the initiated this is 50 hours of unreleased tapes that have been distilled into 3 hours. This is not \\"barrel scraping\\" by any stretch of the imagination. These are prime Can recordings. If you are looking for a sign-post I would say that it is closest to Unlimited Edition (which I love) but superior to my ears thanks to the approximate chronological in the sequencing.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|ALL I WILL SAY IS IT'S THE BEST! THE LARGE BUTTONS MAKE IT VERY EASY FOR ME TO SEE!!! TRY IT....
080214473X|4.0|Mark Bowden did an outstanding job accounting for a part of military history that many Americans were unaware it happened until \\"Black Hawk Down\\" the movie was released.<br /><br />On October 3, 1993 several helicopters dropped about 120 soldiers into the heart of Mogadishu, Somalia with the mission to abduct several top Lieutenants of Mohamed Aidid. It was supposed to take an hour. Fifteen hours later, 18 Americans were dead and 73 were wounded. Many mistakes were made from the General level down to the most junior solider. The soldiers were so confident of a quick victory that they neglected to take night-vision devices, water, and proper gear and equipment.<br /><br />All of these things were much needed later as the simple plan turn to chaos. There was also animosity amongst the Rangers and Delta which created two separate ground-force commanders, who at one point would not even speak to each other. Poor communication and coordination allowed the ground convoy to be mislead throughout the city and take additional casualties from fire from the Somalian mobs. The lack of communication also had Delta take on friendly fire from the Ranger unit.<br /><br />In very strict terms the raid was a success. Two clan leaders were captured but the mission was a failure. The individual heroics were amazing. Soldiers will fight to survive, to protect their buddy, and to kill before they are killed.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I'm already spending more time with this app than several games I've downloaded thru FAOTD. I've wanted to be able to crop my cell phone pics right from the phone for a long time and this lets you do that and a crap-ton more.
B0029LHWFO|3.0|The book was well written and interesting in that it provided a coherent window into what his early years were like. I enjoyed it as a sociological study, but found it a little melodramatic in his portrayal of the absent father and his Kenyan relatives. I looked forward to the insight into his mother's family and never received it. Those characters were portrayed as flat and without real value in his life. Their care and support of him throughout his entire life was discounted completely. As the book went on, I became keenly aware that this was written to be a vehicle for the advancement of Obama's political career and to illustrate the fact that he is seeking to maximize his image as an advocate for the downtrodden. By the end of the book I felt as if I had been force fed an alternate and embellished history of Obama's life.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|After installing this app, Amazon App store is still asking me to install it. But I opened it after download. I might just end up in uninstalling just to eliminate the confusion.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|This is one of my top favorite games I got for my kindle. I was amazed at how many different combinations you could make! You should get it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Loved this book the description doesn't give it much justice it's amazing! I couldn't put it down and as soon as I finished it i started on the next one it's a must read!

B005LAIGN2|1.0|There are many problems with this film, but the core of its problems come from a very weak script filled with trite dialogue and situations.  I don't think any actors could have done anything to save a script so poorly constructed.  The overall effect is to demean a group of brave servicemen who had to resist the racism of the 1940's U.S. military while they fought the German military.
B0086700CM|5.0|My Dad introduced this to me and it id a lot of fun. simple but looks like it will challenging for a while.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|I personally enjpyed this movie quite a bit but unfortunatly I am married, that being said the wife didn't make it twenty minutes in so in summery Men=4 Women=2
B007D2XSW0|1.0|said it could not be installed..Samsung galaxy s  I was really excited for this free app, as most do not interest me...wish it would have worked.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This whole book is a stupider version of Twilight. I hate it. &#34;Christian&#34; is Edward and &#34;Steele&#34; is Bella. This writing is such crap, it makes me want to gag. It puzzles and depresses me that this pulp fiction is on the bestseller list. Why? I enjoyed Twilight more!!!! The characters are about real as hotdogs with jetpacks, and the tone of the whole book is so staged, I was rolling my eyes every time a character said something.
B004XANKVO|5.0|Item was sent as a gift.  Well pleased and would order from again.  I have personally not seen item but the recepient was extremely happy with it.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|ii love iit haviin mad fun wiith thiis app just needs more features wiith iit but iin general iits a gd app
B007D2XSW0|5.0|After reading the negative reviews I thought I would give it a try. This app works just fine on my fire...even posting to facebook without a problem. It's a good photo editor that is very easy to jump right in and use.
0345803485|5.0|Erotic to the extreme.  Movie version will be XXX rated if anything.  I will read and enjoy the next two volumes of the trilogy.
B005IZLPMY|3.0|Okay, let me start this off by saying that the character of Captain America is one of my most favorite characters, and the movie really stayed true to that. Seriously, I would very willingly have Captain America's baby's.<br /><br />That being said, the movie was rather slow in parts, and even the really intense parts of the movie struck me as a bit overdone, and even boring, but I could just be jaded. Overall, there were a few glimmering, memorable moments, but mostly a poorly written story and vaguely cute dialogue.<br /><br />If you're a Marvel fan or a superhero fan, watch the movie. Otherwise, it's nothing terribly special-- just another cute face, hot pair of abs, relationship drama and....a fairly decent ending. The ending was one of the redemptive qualities of this movie, and definitely plays into The Avengers' dialogue.
B0086700CM|4.0|It is fairly hard to get enough coins to get coins if you don't constantly play. Still a GREAT game! Love it! :)
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's your average solitaire. No frills or bells, just solitaire.  The ads aren't too annoying.  They only pop up between games.
B0086700CM|5.0|i have been waiting for this game to work on the kindle fire its amazing and addicting everyone should get the game
B0088RQ4X4|5.0|This is a fun movie for any age. Great entertainment. If you wish, you can totally immerse yourself into the fantasy. Interesting visual effects. Amazing costumes (was that really Willem Defoe? wow!) Beautiful musical score. I had read and loved the series of books by Edgar Rice Burroughs and was afraid that this movie would be disappointing. On the contrary, it is a blast. Watch it and enjoy.
1401234542|3.0|I used to be a Geoff Johns fan. His first work I had read was the \\"No Fear\\" book and after that I've read ALL of Johns work on the Green Lantern mythology. But sadly, he seems to be slowly losing his touch. \\"War of the Green Lanterns\\" wasn't that impressive, \\"Flashpoint\\" was disappointing and now this.<br />As expected, story is exciting and entertaining but then, sometimes it's not enough make the fans happy. The worst flaw with this book is the character portrayal. A villain and murderer (Sinestro) is made to look like a hero and a hero (Hal Jordan), who has saved the universe n times, is made to look like a loser. And to add insult to injury, he's Sinestro's sidekick in this story and moreover, is shown to be inferior in ring-slinging compared to Sinestro. In fact, sometimes, Hal is made to look like a rookie-lantern compared to Sinestro. Sad. I seriously don't know what Geoff Johns was thinking while writing this. I've been a die hard Hal Jordan fan and it hurts like hell to seem him being treated like this. At one point, it's shown that Hal , inspite of losing his ring and being penniless, is asking his on-off girlfriend help in buying a car! I mean, SERIOUSLY!!??!!? Is this the Hal Jordan that we've been reading since decades? Disgusting. And the way things are progressing (with the story, I mean),  it'll be a VERY long time, when Hal Jordan is the sole top-dog in the Green Lantern mythology. Till then he'll be playing second-string to Sinestro.  And Redemption seems to come extremely cheap nowadays. I mean, Sinestro , of all the people is a Green Lantern now? Being a Green Lantern is still okay, but Johns is intent on depicting him to be a kind of a hero. Does anyone even remember \\"Sinestro Corps war\\" anymore? Weren't many Green lanterns slaughtered at the hands of the Sinestro's Yellow Lanterns? Inspite of all this, still Sinestro is shown as a hero.<br />And still there are some faults in the story.<br /> For one, The Guardians have made Sinestro a Green Lantern, but it is NEVER mentioned that he's the Green Lantern of which sector. It's upto the readers to assume that he's the GL of sector 2814.<br />Sinestro heads to Korugar, his home world on hearing that it's been invaded by the Yellow Lanterns. So now, one itsy-bitsy question pops to mind: Where the HELL is Soranik Natu??? She's the official GL for Korugar and she's nowhere shown , not even MENTIONED once. Did Johns forget her during the DC reboot? Unless I'm  mistaken, the GL series is the only comics for which the storyline was intact.<br />The artwork is ok but somehow I've never liked Makhne's art. He is good at drawing everthing except human faces (which I felt, he depicts them bit ugly).<br />The inking and coloring in this book is pretty good. In fact, it makes the pencil-work look much better than it actually is.<br />The last issue is drawn by Mike Choi which is in complete contrast to that of Makhne. It's kind of irritating that a reader gets to see a drastic change in the art. Choi's rendering of Sinestro is still ok but his Hal and Carol are completely unlike the ones done by Makhne, in terms of facial resemblance.<br /><br />After so much criticism, still I've given it a three-stars because the story is ok. And the best part of the story are the seeds that Johns has planted for an upcoming major event. Not to give away any spoilers , but it seems the Guardians are up to something and they don't want the GL corps to be aware of it. One remarkable ability of Johns is that, everytime when you feel that now things are calm and that there is nothing that can happen now, he suddenly pulls the rug from under your feet. It's just because of this that I have been reading the GL series and will continue to do so. I just pray that Johns brings up Hal's character to what it was before.<br />I've read in many reviews that this book is a good starting point for new readers. I strongly disagree. In fact, seeing the first page itself, they'll be confused. New readers, are better-off starting with the \\"No Fear\\" paperback which was the kind of beginning of Hal Jordan's greatness. Now? Well it's a completely different story.
0345803493|5.0|It really bothers me when people rate the first book with a 1. The story really starts to unfold during this second book, there is SO much drama and a great story line that develops.  This is my favorite out of all of the books because it is where Ana and Christians relationship really starts to develop. Love love love :)
B006KX3GXO|5.0|this is the best photo app ever especially since I was looking for one to make collages or just to edit a pic. I regret not downloading this app sooner instead of going through the other apps just 2 delete or uninstall(if that's a word), but get this app because u wont regret it. u can upload to anywhere, send it to emails, and so much more!!!
B007D2XSW0|5.0|I'm not very creative so I need all the help I can get. This app is really fun and easy!
B004P8ITGU|4.0|Very enjoyable book. Clearly written for the younger audience, but still entertaining for the Grisham fan.<br />Would recommend this for any parent trying to motivate their child to read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|leps world is the best game I've. ever played!I love all of the levels in the  game so much that I've that I filled all.3 slots!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have never read a book that was so horribly written in my life.  It was childish and ridiculous from start to finish.  I don't understand how this book became #1.
0345803485|2.0|Interesting sex scenes, but over all the writing is amaturish. You can only endure the same cirisis described using the same words so many times. Book two is worse.
0345803485|1.0|This book really is terrible. I am so glad that I borrowed this instead of paying. Why is this book so popular??? This is the first book I have given one star to. Had to force myself to finish the book, it is SO BORING!!! YES SHOUTY CAPITALS!! So stupid. You just read the same scene over and over and over. I figured there must be something good in the book because of all the hype, but no. Also, the sex is not even hot. There is no chemistry between the two, it's very one dimensional and poorly written. Christian would've had a great time with me since I was rolling my eyes every ten pages.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|this is a very great product and I am very happy it is for kindle and that I can upload them to fb
B007SYWFRM|5.0|so much fun<br /><br />.even my husband likes this game. I hope they can expand it very soon.<br />Sometimes there are a few bugs but worth it anyway.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I have to leave and come back to play and check messages. unless you are decorating you won't spend much time in the restaurant.  otherwise its fun when u get to set your things up.
0307887448|5.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of Patrick Rothfuss--he suggested it on his blog.  I love that man's books, so I gave it a chance.  What a ride!  This book is mindblowingly good.  Fast paced plot and more pop culture references per second than is legal in most states.  The most incredible achievement?  All of that pop culture is completely important to the book. The Best part of the book?  The characters.  With all the importance of the pop culture madness and wonder, this book would fall on its face if I didn't care about the characters.  I couldn't stop reading--I wanted to know how this story went, and how it ended.  But I didn't want it to end!  I wanted it to go on for another 16000 pages.  Seriously.  Get this book--a new sci-fi masterpiece and classic all in one.
B007D2XSW0|4.0|But I really like the execution of this app, even though it still has some rough edges, that if worked out, could potentially be one the best (non-photoshop) photo editors out there. The menus make it easy to quickly select the functions you want to edit your photos. Combined with Sketchbook mobile, I feel I am going to have a lot of fun with this app. Thanks Amazon for this Free App of the Day. :)
B007D2XSW0|4.0|This app is very good, but the touch is off. For example I was trying to edit the frame and it said that I was touching save! Other then that the app PicShop Photo Editor is a very easy, fun and creative way to edit your favorite pictures!
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game it is so fun but it is a little hard but u have to try harder every time
B0081JAED0|5.0|I have been a fan since the beginning.  With the less than par rock music these days, it is refreshing to hear some new rockin' sounds from Garbage. It rocks!
B0050XFY4O|4.0|This is a wonderful movie that involves what others might consider taboo. While the movie does not actually deal in depth with issues of love between brothers or being gay itself, it has been written well to make the audience love it. the writer has perfected(almost) the world to make the movie more light and not too serious(like Big Eden). first half was awesome showcasing the intimacy between the boys. second half was all lovey dovey with scenes that will make one melt. both cases, the chemistry was awesome. there is no comparison to that. at the end, it just makes one want the movie to never end. could have dealt with the issues a little deeper. thats why one 4 stars. overall, great concept made light to melt and keep the audience happy till the end. have seen it 3 times so far and still want to see it again.
B005KXT58U|4.0|Always loved Evanescence and this album does not disappoint. If you enjoy their brand of hard rock, then this album will keep you rockin'!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Great graphics and music. Sometimes the game gets stuck and its hard to continue. otherwise I think it is a good adventure.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is my favorite game ever I love it so much. I like all the different obsticles that you have to go through.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Really glad this was a free app of the day. Just downloaded it and so far it seems pretty cool. Would like more frames and stickers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Esta jugo es muy bueno! Me gusta el mucho y me enojo el todas las dias! Encanto jugar esta juga!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|awesome. easy to play. fell in love after 2 minutes. have a problem putting it down. going to get the first one when I'm done with this
B006Y9BVRM|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE this watch. This watch is a good as watches many times the price. The only downside<br /> the date window is way to small.
B006QS0PF0|5.0|This book is well written and keeps the reader wanting more. I learned a great deal about anorexia and enjoyed reading about Amanda's battle with her weight.
B007XNAQLA|5.0|These guys are heroes to me. Being a musician myself, I know how hard it is to make excellent and original music AND play it well live. (I'm not saying you have to be a musician to know that, but I really appreciate the magnitude of what it means because I try it every day and think about it constantly)<br /><br />So when I hear this CD, I'm filled with a massive amount of hope and inspiration for my own future. These giants of musical creation helped (and continue to) light the fire that makes my life immensely colorful and enjoyable; Particularly music like this because of its of unique character. Even after several decades it is still fresh and beautiful and people want to hear it and people want to hear THEM because they are some of the greatest musicians on the planet.<br /><br />I had the great honor of seeing them live during their world tour in September of 2011 at Ruth Eckerd Hall, Clearwater, FL.. and it was the best night of my life, bar none, just to see and hear them live. I felt like I got to see a major part of history. (But they are NOT \\"history\\" yet. Clearly they still have so much to say!)<br /><br />As far as the actual content of the album goes, I am maximally pleased. They NEVER cease to amaze me.. There's always some sort of new musical surprise in each tune. They never really play the same way twice which is wildly fun and to me the ultimate goal for musical expression. Plus, I have to say, I love that most of the tracks are so long. Each one is like a journey and they take you down all kinds of different paths and expose you to different concepts. They are all still very much alive and well with what they do and to me they trump any modern band in terms of energy, enthusiasm and overall sound.<br /><br />After all... They are a MAN band.<br />Long live RTF, long live PURE MUSIC.<br />THANK YOU RTF, WE LOVE YOU DEARLY!<br /><br />- Nick Spagnuolo, Palmetto, FL<br /><br />\\"When you play, you play life\\" - Jaco
B004P7CN5O|4.0|Moive came on time and in perfect condition.  As for the actual movie it's one of those movies you just sit back and watch for mindless entertainment. Plus it also has as some other people have mention some great one liners threwout the movie.  The one that sticks in my mine is teh stripper saying \\"welcome to slavery\\" and the male actor goes \\"No thanks I already got a wife.\\"  I also thought special effects make up was very good.  So if your looking for a horror movie to just take up some time and help you relax as time goes by pick this movie up and enjoy some good mindless entertainment for the evening.
B007PYF7D4|5.0|I love The Vampire Diaries every episode keeps you wanting to watch more. The plot is great. A very interesting show. I just wish the third season would hit Netflix already. This is my Favorite show i watch it 24/7. ~Delena Fan!!&lt;3
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|I love this movie.  I am a big Sherlock Holmes fan, and although these movies don't go 100% with the original stories, they are just as engaging and fun.  Robert Downey, Jr. does a fantastic job (as usual) and Jude Law shines.  Casting Jared Harris as Moriarty was a good choice.  He may not follow the physical description of the \\"Napoleon of crime,\\" but he has that whole megalomaniac thing down.  Highly recommend.
B007KCG7MQ|5.0|I only heard this was coming out via Hmv radio ads and having virtually all his albums from James Gang to date I could not wait to hear it. This time round I decided to preview Itunes instead of blindly buying. Most of the output since \\" folks \\" had the odd cracker here and there. The \\"confessor song \\" is right up there with the best but I felt that these latter albums for the most part were forgetable. Anyway back on track having listened to the samples I was blown away. I wanted to buy the CD but could not wait so bought through I tunes. Been listening to it for 3 hours steady. The song \\" india\\" ...is an instumental has a thunderstruck AC Dc esque intro and merges into typical Walsh at his very best...( a pity it couldn't last for ten minutes!\\"  The intro to \\"analogue\\" is so Walsh a castaway on desert island for 30 years would spot it immediately. All the tracks have something going for them. The Jeff Lynne input is evident and perhaps in some tracks maybe massaged Joe rasping chord playing too much but that's nit picking. This is a fabulous piece of work right up there with seventies best. I loved the early stuff then still do but I was thirty years younger then as well,  so do I expect a poor rehash of old stuff NO ! he's changed he's older ( it happens to us all ) . This is a modern sounding collection that harnesses the power of the early days , the Eagle's influence and blends it all into something brilliant and contempory. The man sounds happy and this has a feel good output . I don't expect him to sound exactly like he did in 75 but what I want is some semblance of the talent he had then and let me say THIS DELIVERS BIG TIME!!!!
B005IML464|5.0|Excelente producto, envio rapido y eficiente llego a Argentina rapidisimo, la edicion muy buena, gran sonido, muchas obras, lo recomiendo a todos los usuarios.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is a good app and verrryyyyy addicting! my mom keeps telling me to get off my kindle!! ahhhhhhh :)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The first few chapters (which available as sample) depicted the lead male as mysterious, rich, and smart person.<br />But after I bought the book and continue reading, I found him quite stupid.<br />He's not mysterious anymore and the book's not fun anymore.<br />The lead female is a bit annoying since the beginning and after that it's even more unbearable :(<br />The sex scenes are not at all sexy. They actually made me sick.<br />I've bought many books in my life and some of them are not good but after a few days I will forget about them.<br />But with this book, I would say it's the WORSE!! And I can't forget about it. It stuck in my head and in my library too :(<br /><br />I WANT TO DELETE IT FROM MY LIBRARY!!<br />I DON'T WANT ANY REFUND.<br /><br />PLESE DELETE IT FROM MY LIBRARY TT^TT
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is really awesome but you have to earn coins to buy more games. a great game and its free
B0086700CM|5.0|I've seen lots of people playing this game and I asked my dad if I could get it and he said yes!I think it's awesome!
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Saw it IMAX 3D, the way it was meant to be seen! Can't wait to own it! The 3D was so effective that I found myself trying to look around objects and actors to see behind them in scenes. I love Michael Fassbender, and he is absolutely perfect as the Android David...I believed he was David. He really made the movie for me. Noomi Rapace's performance was memorable, and her \\"gory\\" scene was seriously disturbing in just the right way...I wrapped my arms around myself and curled up as if I was feeling her pain. Charlize Theron was good but not great. Idris Elba and all the remaining cast delivered. Outstanding cinematography - so much beauty to behold in every expansive landscape. Made me wish my eyes were bigger, there was so much to take in visually. The music was perfectly scored, swelling at peak moments causing my body and mind to involuntarily react and swell with intensity in the same way. The story was engaging and moved at a good pace. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. So much more to mention, but simply put...AMAZING!!!
B00633W614|3.0|Not as good as the first Clifton chronicle.  Heroine was too smart, good, etc.  Not a believable character.  Plot was very contrived.
0525478817|5.0|First of all.... The Fault in Our Stars is now by far my favorite book. Pure genius amazingness.  Also, the Book Haven's shipping speed was surprisingly fast... I got the book like two days after I ordered it, and in perfect condition. So, overall, awesome service, great book!

B001V7SME2|5.0|Another Vampire Movie it's not.  This is a new take on an old story and is an excellent foreign film.  The acting is fresh, the characters are believable and the main character is chilling.  Not your average vampire movie.  This one is better than it's US remake.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy playing this and the ads aren't a problem.  It's worth it as far as free games are concerned.
B003O86FMW|5.0|the book is totally cool beans you should buy  it the movies are bad i dont like movies  really good book
0316056863|4.0|Most celebrities just take themselves too seriously. Tina Fey does not and how refreshing that is! I laughed on almost every page and thoroughly enjoyed myself reading this one. Having seen Ms. Fey on SNL helped immensely since I could picture her telling the story.<br /><br />This is a quick and delightful read. Thanks for the laughs, Tina.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a super super super fun game... yup...ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Allows me to do great editing to fix pictures shot in a hurry. Best part is though, it improves every picture I have with 3 button clicks via autofix.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|A new release from Rush is always a welcome treat, since it wasn't that long ago we thought we'd never get another one. About 2 years ago they released a couple of teaser tracks, Caravan and BU2B. These lead off the new release, and BU2B gets a new intro. Both of these are thundering rockers with some lyrical meat behind them. Caravan starts off with some train or caravan bells, signaling the beginning of a journey. And Clockwork Angels is indeed a journey - a concept album, 66 minutes long, Rush's first real concept album since 2112, and seems to be loosely based on, or at least influenced by, Voltaire's Candide, as [...]. A bit esoteric for a rock album, but this is Rush we're talking about here. It's definitely a literate work - Caravan lyrics lead with \\"In a World Lit only by Fire\\", a nod to Manchester's well-known work on Medieval history. It's the story of a young man's journey through a steampunk / medieval world - and apparently will be novelized by Kevin Anderson, the Sci-Fi writer.    I've been living with the CD for about week, listening to it constantly. I find that Rush CDs really require a break-in period of a few weeks to really appreciate them, there are so many layers. Behind the extraordinary musicianship one finds deep lyrics, and hooks and solos that resonate more each time you listen. There are a lot of atmospherics and textures in this disc, more than any other Rush disc in recent memory. Caravan bells, string orchestra backdrops, the wind sounds on Halo Effect, vocal processing effects, a carnival backdrop and a repeating, echoing ratchet sound on Carnies, all make their appearance, and lend a depth to the songs. But they are always subtle and not overdone.    In fact I find the word that most describes this disc to me, for a 30 year Rush fan, is \\"distilled\\". All these songs are distilled to their essence and the core of Rush's approach. There is a delirious, Middle-eastern inspired guitar solo in The Anarchist that is about 30 seconds of blistering guitar work that would have been a 10 minute interlude for Rush 20 years ago. Distilled. (And oh by way intermingled interestingly with a string ensemble - this song would have felt at home on Led Zeppelin's Physical Graffiti, were that remade today). As always, the songs show the typical Rush bent for philosophical introspection together with a musical change of meter and change of key, and unwillingness to just play it straight - the title track Clockwork Angels packs three different movements (including a jazz interlude) into a 7 minute solid track. And it works. Scattered amongst the power rock are a couple of well done ballads, including Halo Effect, a song about seeing what you what to see in someone, instead of what's there.    Interestingly I found many echoes and nods to previous Rush material scattered through the music. BU2B's remixed opening immediately makes me thing of Permanent Waves; the guitar solo on Carnies cannot help but remind a Rush fan of YYZ from Moving Pictures, the winds on the opening of Halo Effect feel sampled direct from 2112, and if you are true long time Rush fan, you'll hear By-Tor and the Snow Dog from 1975, echoed in the back half of Seven Cities of Gold. Headlong Flight clearly echoes Bastille Day from Caress of Steel. There are too many of these for it be un-intentional; much as Robert Plant did on Tall Cool One, they're sampling themselves to remind you where they were, and that they're better now than they were. I love it when people late in their career are still innovating.    A small bit of media commentary. It's legendary how much the music \\"establishment\\" dislikes Rush. But how an album from a group that's sold more music than practically anyone, can debut at #2, and have virtually NO reviews out with in a week, is beyond me. Rolling Stone, where are you? I'd like to think the reviewers were doing the same as I was, letting it sit for a week to really \\"get it\\". But then Billboard throws up a review that's 1 paragraph long and dismissive, with no content, that took about 30 seconds to write. Seriously?    Well, whatever they think, if you like Rush or any form of hard rock, or just appreciate powerful musicianship, get Clockwork Angels and let it spin for awhile. I'm not sure where this disc is in the pantheon of Rush CDs (Snakes & Arrows was a masterpiece), but it's near the top....
B007Q476KU|5.0|the story of a magnificent animal and his owner is well worth watching. The bigger the screen the better for this epic tale of a super horse and the humans in his life.
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Prometheus failed to deliver anything new beyond the opportunity for a new franchise. The film stumbled forward on weak, underdeveloped legs rendering any potential overall concept flat on its face in the end. If there was an overall concept, it was unclear. Prometheus felt like a prequel to a film that hasn't been made yet, and one that I already don't care about.<br /><br />Prometheus has been hailed as visually stunning--I think I have even seen the phrase \\"visual masterpiece\\"--but I argue that the film didn't give us anything that we haven't seen before. We already know that filmmakers can dazzle us with anything that the mind can conceive. Stunning visuals are little more than a parlor trick nowadays, and certainly not enough to carry a film alone. The recently released Iron Sky, a low-budget Sci-Fi comedy, boasts stunning visuals that were easily as interesting as anything Prometheus has to offer. Big money and big visuals do not necessarily equal successful storytelling.<br /><br />The screenplay was weak and full of half developed ideas, stumbling by opportunities to tell a story, or develop characters, in order to get to the next action sequence or opportunity for gore. Dialogue that was key to each moment had little impact on the overall flow of the plot. Character driven subplots, which should have meshed in with the overall story, were confusing and got lost along the way. By the time the film was over, I was left feeling like nothing had made sense except that the filmmakers wanted me to know that there would be another film.<br /><br />I have read that the film left too many unanswered questions, but I felt that the film posed irrelevant questions (that I didn't have going in), and offered watered down answers. For instance, the film largely centers on the origins of human life, but the characters in the film didn't even seem all that excited about the question or the answer. The answer was provided in the first moments of the film and was as interesting the origins of toothpicks. Prometheus also attempted to answer questions that I (as a fan) was supposed to have (but didn't), and did so with underwhelming results (e.g. the Space Jockey). I already knew it was the pilot of a ship. The film attempted too much in terms of touching on big questions, and too little in terms of telling a good story. As a result the film left me feeling wholly disinterested.<br /><br />Sometimes poor dialogue and lack of plot can be rescued by really good characters--sometimes. The characters in the film were either over-the-top-archetypal (the maverick pilot), confusing (the archaeologist/lover/\\"X Games type scientist\\"), boring (the archaeologist wrestling with her faith AND a squid), pointless (dying billionaire and CEO, who dies), or left me with a question that I probably wasn't supposed to have (\\"Why is she here?\\"--the angry, sexy, might-be-a-robot, corporate crony, who wants her maker dead?). The only character that I found the least bit interesting was the android (David) played by Michael Fassbender, but I didn't understand his motivations at all, which left me feeling the same way that I felt about the rest of the characters--I didn't care about any of them. It was sad to see so much talent wasted on characters that couldn't be saved from dull aliens or bad writing.<br /><br />This film had nothing that I had hoped for. I went in hoping to see exciting and new visual spectacles, but I got a McCathedral. I went in hoping for great story telling, but I got a condensed version of the three bears. I went in hoping for complex and compelling characters, but I got Saturday morning cartoon versions of them. I went in hoping for the reveal of some exciting new aliens, but was greeted by cuttlefish and...extraterrestrial body builders (?). I don't get it. This film had so much going for it, until they made it.<br /><br />Prometheus' ego was as big as its budget. And as it is with most big egos, they can't see their own shortcomings, and everyone kisses their bu...budget. \\"The bigger the ego, the harder they fall,\\" it has been said. I think that, while Prometheus may not fall hard, it will fall out of people's minds. This is one of the most forgettable films I have ever seen. But hey, maybe its offspring will fare better. It does, after all, have great DNA.<br /><br />--UPDATE--<br /><br />If you're interested in learning about the probable DNA behind the Prometheus story, I recommend looking into the Gnostic texts of the Nag Hammadi. The Apocalypse of Adam, one of the Nag Hammadi texts, seems to offer numerous parallels. Of course, a background in Gnosticism will help, as there are numerous characters one should be familiar with. If you're not familiar with Gnostic ideas, simply look up the Nag Hammadi on Wikipedia. There's enough information there to help a person become familiar with the ideas that likely underpin this film.
B007BLUD30|4.0|Better than most of the reviews would suggest. Eddie Murphy is funny asis Ben Stiller but the whole cast delivers a funny movie. Will justice prevail in the end?
0425263908|5.0|Bared to You is a delectable, hot, wild ride from the beginning. I found the characters interesting and quickly lost myself in the story. Gideon and Eva's demons were very intriguing. (I'm dying to learn more about Gideon's) Cary is a great friend to Eva despite his self-destructive nature. I really hope Eva can knock some sense into him in the next book. Sylvia Day is definitely a talented storyteller and I can't wait to get my hands on Deeper in You. I will definitely be checking out more of her books.
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Midnight In Paris is an enjoyable experience from start to finish. From the opening montage of images of Paris to the simple ending of Paris in the rain, it never drags or<br />goes off course. Gil (Owen Wilson) plays an American screenwriter who through some sort of magic, each night is transported to Paris in the 1920's.<br />Gil interacts with allthe players and the idols of his imaginations. Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Gertrude Stein, Picasso, Cole Porter etc...<br />His interactions and conversations are intelligent and fun  Even with the fantastic premise the film never veers off to silliness or camp. The characters he meets not only accept Gil for who he is, but actually embrace him which is a stark contrast to his daytime reality.<br />Gil is in Paris with his fiancee who regularly treats Gil with disdain while at the same time planning their lives together in Malibu. Gil dreams of a simple life in Paris writing novels while she enjoys his career as a screenwriter and all it affords them in Hollywood. When Gil tries to explain and share his nocturnal experiences on the streets of Paris she dismisses him and recommends seeing a neurologist.<br />Michael Sheen brilliantly plays an intellectual snob who is an old friend of Gil's fiancee. It is classic Woody Allen characterization of the annoying know it all but it is great fun seeing Gil in the Woody Allen role subtly but hilariously handle him.<br />All of the cast is great especially the characters from the 1920's. The movie is gorgeously photographed and paced.<br />This movie has it all. Comedy, romance, beautiful photography, time travel, great characters, acting and a wonderful soundtrack of Cole Porter and instrumental music.<br />A great night at the movies.This was a movie made for the big screen and not for special effects or 3D. This was made for the big screen because it is a classic movie we want to sit in the dark and get lost in.
B005LAIHIQ|1.0|been a fan of dark shadows since the mid sixties , thought they did a pretty good job with the 1991 remake . so what the hell went wrong ? other than tim burton being involved ! I really have trouble believing what he did to the story , and cant believe that depp a self professed fan of the original series would involve himself in such a travesty ! this film is an insult to the fans , the creator of the original series , and the stars of the original series ! tim burton owes them all an apology !

B003Y5H5HY|2.0|The movie is a great portrayal of a very compelling story by Stieg Larsson.<br />However, this format of a digital copy is currently not worth the money, time and effort. I was instructed to open an account with UltraViolet.  I have an Ultraviolet digital copy of another movie which I was instructed to download with Flixster. Apparently I should have used the same account name for each, now I have to use Flixster for one movie and UltraViolet for the other. Can't merge them.  System is too fussy.  A single download to iTunes allows me to easily access digital copies from all of my devices.  Hopefully the UltraViolet System will oneday be worthwhile.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool was first brought to my attention as a recommendation in one of my magazines (which one I do not remember). I thought it said that if I liked 50 Shades of Grey, I would like Wool. I have read both the 50 Shades of Grey series, and Wool Omnibus Edition 1-5, and I can't for the life of me understand this comparison and these two book series are NOTHING alike. I can only imagine that I must be mistaken as to what the book comparison was. Nonetheless, a magazine brought me to Wool and I am glad.<br /><br />Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1-5) is essential the first five books in the series. Don't let this be overwhelming or daunting to you, as these \\"books\\" are more like a collection of short stories. The first book is the shortest, and it appears with each book/short story the length increases. Overall, Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1-5) is essentially one book when it comes to length. This is not a negative, just an observation and one that will hopefully help make the idea of five books in one less daunting.<br /><br />I actually very much liked the Wool series/collection. It is of the sci-fi genre, which is a genre I enjoy in both movies and books. I have never really read anything like this series, which made it a pleasant read. I found the first short story to be difficult to understand at first. It just jumped right into a sci-fi story that left me a bit confused. After a few pages though, it was brought together for me. I did find the first short story to be a bit boring. My first impression was this is not a good buy, and I am not going to like this. Thankfully I was wrong. I got much more into this series midway through the second short story/book, and from there on the book had my attention. I loved the 4th and 5th short story/book the best.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed the storyline. It was like nothing I have yet to read. The overall length was good, and I am happy that the 6th book is available (I am going to start on it this weekend). The cost of the seriesis very affordable, which I also appreciate. I enjoyed the characters especially Juliette, and the people of mechanics. I look forward to hearing more of their story and what happens with the people of silo 17. It was definitely a good read that left me riveted and highly entertained. I would absolutely recommend it for the sci-fi/doomsday reader at heart.
B007K3JCAE|2.0|First, please understand that the movie is great! Robert Downey, Jr and Jude Law bring new life into the franchise and their portrayal of this version of the Sherlock Holmes saga makes for some great fun.<br /><br />The problem I have is with the UltraViolet digital copy.  It is still a very fussy system and to me not worth the money, time and effort to acquire. I am still not sure what I have and how long I might be able to access it. You can download to UltraViolet - or perhaps Sony - or to Flixster,  and watch it on UltraViolet - or maybe Flixster, but if you download to UltraViolet, Flixster might not be able to find it...and each account requires a new setup and password and you must be sure to use the same signin to each account or you will wind up with multiple accounts that can't be merged . . .just not worth it right now.  I like the good old download once to iTunes and there it is forever. Very simple and easy to use.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|GNEX<br />Like some I had no problems opening or saving pix.  There are many preset enhancements a well as a lot of fine tuning options.  I also like some of the extras like stickers (mustaches and hats etc)  as well a the speech bubbles.  Great FAOTD

B00003CXBK|5.0|Princess Mononoke has great animation, very good characters and storyline and a menagerie of wolves, pigs, apes, animal deities and miscellaneous monsters.  Sometimes it seemed that conjuring up weird wonders was more important than telling the story.<br /><br />Were all those weird wonders really necessary?  Origins successfully tells the same type of eco story without the menagerie.  Princess Mononoke was quite capable of defending her forest without their help.  In fact, she would have come across as an even more heroic lass if she had been a solitary warrior.<br /><br />I don't expect a story to be exactly the way I want it to be.  What the movie did do, it did very well.  For that reason I did decide to give it 5 stars instead of only 4, but I still like Origins better than Princess Mononoke.  If your preference in that type of story is to skip the menagerie, then Origins would be a better choice for you than Princess Mononoke.  Origins is also available from Amazon.

0316044695|4.0|This book was written by a guy that went through one of the most extraordinary ordeals I have ever read.  Is he a writer?  NO- and he doesn't claim to be.(these people complaining about no \\"ing's\\"!!) He is telling you one of the most fascinating stories of survival we know so little about.  We couldn't possibly understand the sacrifices these men made because we are in a little bubble surrounded by big macs and awful reality television shows. The least we could do as a sign of respect is learn more about what our troops go through especially the special operation units. During WWII my grandmother told me the sacrifices that were made, the people who hung flags in their windows for loved ones who had died, the rationing of food, the sense of community and a feeling everyone was in it together. Our country is caught up in the bitterness of politics,the apathy of everyday life even though we have more access to see what our troops are going through everyday then ever before in history, the release of more and more generic technology that 98% of us don't need. Listen I realize times are tough now but we are not getting shot at on a daily basis by people that hate us. I wonder what that does to their psychology? I am so proud of some of the things my country has done but lately we seem to have lost touch(me included)with what real sacrifice is.  This book will bring all of these things to life for you and it's a book you can't put down. I love that Marcus includes a lot of the cultural differences and idiosyncrasies that make you aware of why fighting in Afghanistan is so difficult. All I'm saying is give the book a shot, if anything you will not regret reading it.  You also might realize we need to do so much more for our troops. Thanks Marcus Luttrell for having the guts to rehash a story that must have been so painful to re-live again. You are a hero.
1936608898|5.0|It's worth pointing out that the authors share a huge amount of information, via their website and social media, and, for me, the cost of this book is a tiny price to pay in return for all of that. One of the great things about the book, of course, is that so much information is condensed in one place - the science of nutrition explained in detail, and easily digestible! I love the easy to grasp message of 'eat food that truly nourishes you'.<br />Please don't believe any reviews that claim the authors don't provide references - there are pages and pages of them.<br />If you want to take charge of your health, that project must start with food, and this book will be the ideal companion.
0345529057|5.0|I started watching this series on HBO, I couldn't wait until the next season to start to find out what happens to the characters.  The books are incredibly detailed and that is great, I prefer a lighter read but that's okay.  I'll just read one chapter at a time because there is so much background on the characters in the book.  Like I said, incredibly detailed makes for a very long read.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really addictive i play it all the time. the only thing that i dont like about it is that you have to use a credit card to buy coin. that

B004QOB8SY|5.0|Great concept, cast and writing.  Of course Irene Adler would be a domanatrix, not an opera singer.  Is the Hound of Baskerville a giant mutant escaped from a creepy government lab?  Why shouldn't Moriarty run through all the stories like an undergroud stream?  By taking iconic plot elements from the original canon and bringing the stories into the present day, it's much more like Sherlock Holmes than the Robert Downey, Jr. -- Jude Law films.  The only problem about buying this is having to wait for season 3.

B007TBCTRK|1.0|If you thought that Prometheus would keep up with the excellent score from the first \\"Alien\\" movie, then sadly you are way off track.<br />This soundtrack has 25 tracks, each of them 1-3 minutes in length. Thats the problem, no piece really points out what Prometheus really is about. There is no good Leitmotiv at all, no track is worthy to be remembered. The tracks are too short, too weak. Usually short tracks should have a high musical intensity to compensate the amount of what can be put into longer tracks. Well, not on this soundtrack.<br />I listened to the trailer music and thought it would be on the soundtrack as well. The trailer music was far better than the finished product, to be honest it was the only reason I got interested in the Prometheus soundtrack anyway.<br /><br />I often listen to soundtracks while surfing the internet, and it ranges from the Terminator synthesizer music from the 80s to the up-to-date themes from actual movies with good scores. If it is James Newton Howard, Hans Zimmer, Jerry Goldsmith, John Williams, James Horner, Vangelis, Alan Silvestri etc.. I like them all, and I adore their work. Soundtracks can be timeless if they are excellently done. Like Basil Poledouris and his work on \\"Conan the Barbarian\\" for instance, a timeless masterpiece, which makes the CD so expensive (over 50$ at the moment). They are talented in transporting feelings through music. The opposite is the case with Prometheus. I mean, I am in the internet and have the CD playing in the background, and it touches absolutely no feelings while listening. Nothing epic, nothing dramatic, nothing heroic, nothing melancholic. That is what I expect from a soundtrack, and that is why I am a soundtrack addict. Track 20 plays, and the next time I watched it was track 25. It makes absolutely no difference. That makes Prometheus the worst soundtrack I have purchased so far.<br /><br /> I pre-ordered this soundtrack from Germany before release as I thought Ridley Scott would,as usual, hire an excellent composer, like he did before with Jerry Goldsmith, Vangelis or Hans Zimmer for instance. Though I never heard of Streitenfeld before, my expectations were the same like for other Scott movies, that might have been the mistake.  I am disappointed and I am now looking forward to the Dark Knight Rises soundrack.<br />Prometheus is not worth the purchase and next time when Ridley does a movie, I will not preorder the soundtrack. It seems Ridley has lowered his quality standards. Sadly.

B000J159N8|1.0|It seemed like a whitewashed film from the 40s in many ways. The acting was mediocre and Mel was not at his best or second best or third best. A flat film with lousy camera action. I am surprised at all of the 5 ratings,
B005PK1G76|5.0|I purchased this for my City Mini and it works great.  It has two elastic cup holders and a long pocket that fits my keys, wallet, and iPhone.  Don't waste your money on another product, this is sturdy, functional, and economical.
B005I0DUMC|1.0|Out of touch with any kind of reality and an insult to everyone. There is not one thing that makes the least sense in this movie. Start with day one when Stallone supposedly loses hearing in one ear bashing out a car window with his head. Don't hurt yourself but try putting your head against a wall or something and even getting your ear to touch it.<br /><br />Keitel and buddies go around murdering any police officers who make any mistakes, presumably it tarnishes the image of their perfect community. All put together, this movie is a series of dumb actions by people who had no real motive to do such dumb things.<br /><br />Another stupid movie good for nothing but insulting intelligence. Another movie I am glad I only paid a quarter for, for a used VHS, and even that was a waste of money.
B003EY7IUY|4.0|Loved it! There were parts that made me mad & go WTH??!, but a good book has to draw emotions out of your or else it's not a good book. Becky has to go through a TON of crap, make mistakes, and learn from them like she's done in the past. She's niave and definitely a shopaholic, but she's a great person and I loved how the importance of family and relationships shined through in this book. Another great addition to the series Sophie!<br /><br />Becky is hilarious! Love!
B005KTZ05G|4.0|Assassin's Creed II is one of my favorite games of all time, and even though by the time \\"Brotherhood\\" came out, I was nearing the \\"OK, that's plenty of this series\\" point, I still enjoyed it. So, it made sense that I needed a fine figure like the NECA Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Master Assassin Ezio for display on my shelf.<br />When I took the figure from the packaging, I immediately noticed the quality feel of the figure. It has a good weighty feel to it, and the materials are high quality.<br />The sculpt on this figure is nothing short of beautiful. The colors are subtle and somewhat muted, and are reminiscent of the in-game graphics.<br />The articulation of the figure is actually more impressive than I initially thought it would be. The armor of the figure does not impede articulation as much as you might think it would because most of the plastic is soft and malleable allowing the legs, waist, and arms to move freely.<br />The figure does have a bit of a \\"stability\\" issue as it pertains to standing on it's own free will. It will stand, but it does not take much to cause it to fall.<br />Nice details like the interchangeable hands, and double Assassin's Blades that are both extendable, retractable, and even removable, are great touches.<br />The biggest problem I have with this figure is the paint on the hands. It is very evident that these hands are all sculpted, assembled, and then dipped in paint and left to dry. This leads to an immediate chipping and scraping of the paint on the hands when you move the wrists, or change them. This is disappointing in that it leads to white patches on the wrists of the figure. For such a beautiful figure, it's a little perplexing that such a corner would be cut in quality.<br /><br />Overall, the figure is a wonderful piece for display, and if you are a fan of the game series, then I would recommend it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|*some spoilers*<br />Catching fire was by far the best book of the trilogy for me. I loved all the things before the games. Katniss was strong and good as always but I thought we got to learn more about her in this edition to the trilogy. In this book also you find out a lot more about Gale and Peeta. Peeta becomes involved in the story with Gale in some parts making it a stronger scene when they were together. You could tell though that neither one of them wanted wanted to be around the other if Katniss wasn't there. This book is when I started to fall in love with Peeta. Peeta really tries to be friends with Katniss instead of acting in love with her all the time, but Snow makes this hard by giving by making them think they all will die if they dont act in love. I felt so bad about this and I wished it would've been all real for Peeta.<br />Now let me skip to the games the pregnancy was a great card to throw in in my opinion. It made everything change. The tributes stood together as one against Snow afterwords I loved it. The games you saw Katniss fall for Peeta a little bit and then the end happened. All I have to say is oh my goss.<br />Great book and I recommended it to anyone.
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I quickly refunded this book after purchasing it from the kindle store, but i still ended up reading a copy on a friend's device (I couldn't justify spending $11 on something i wasn't that excited over). the ebook version was extremely disappointing as there were so many elementary level grammar mistakes, it made me wonder how it made it through the editing process. I understand that those kinds of things happen, but the amount of mistakes made me think the electronic version was an afterthought. I don't know if the same mistakes are present in the hard copy, and I honestly hope they are not.<br />  the actual book... was okay, I wouldn't read it again, and am still debating even continuing the series. The story and the characters were my biggest gripe. I understand this book is geared toward a teenage audience and the characters are mostly teenagers also, but having a teenage cast makes for a very rocky and emotionally unstable ride (also part of the draw, though). I felt, at times, that it was excessive. the story also took too long to develop, every time I picked up the book, it was almost forced and I had to convince myself that it was going to pick up and get better, which it barely did. the character development was patchy and uneven, and the common stereotypes of the angsty-mysterious-teens-with-difficult-pasts got on my nerves quickly. Also, the story itself was... interesting, the plot and it's twists were hard to swallow and unnecessary. I'm trying to write this without spoiling the book for those who are trying to evaluate if they should read it or not.<br />  the entire experience (from the weird grammar problems in the ebook, to the odd character development) left an odd taste in my mouth. On almost every page, I felt as though the author was trying much too hard to paint an artistic and poetic picture, that never really cut it for me. The scenes she painted were over-detailed and sometimes made her descriptions harder to grasp, I didn't care to know how shadows were cast in an empty apartment, I just wanted to know what was happening to the characters. This is my opinion, of course.<br />  I'm also speaking to the older than teenage and possibly more \\"read\\" group. this book was no literary marvel, and the story was mediocre, at best. I still recommend The Hunger Games, over these other teen driven \\"war-esque\\" books, although the city of bones is a tad more akin to.. the current popular \\"vampire\\" story, which shall remain nameless. I say this because, this story focuses more on the romantic values, which actually weren't too in your face or shoved too harshly down your throat, that, and it didn't initiate the gag reflex. Overall, the book was okay, but I wouldn't recommend it, especially if you loved the Hunger Games as not being a love story but as a socially significant piece of literature, to say the least. Hopefully this can be helpful and not come out as a garbled mess of words on a screen.
