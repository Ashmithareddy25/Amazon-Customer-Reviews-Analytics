0765348276|5.0|I first heard of John Scalzi a few months ago, when I read his forward to Joe Haldeman's excellent The Forever War. Scalzi was entertaining in the forward to the classic, with his explanation of how he did not set out to follow Haldeman's footsteps with his 2005 debut novel, Old Man's War. I enjoyed The Forever War and Scalzi's forward and internet writings (and, years ago first read and enjoyed Robert Heinlein's Starship Troopers, a major influence of both and the grandaddy of military science fiction), so I figure I ought to go read Old Man's War. Having completed Old Man's War, I'm glad Scalzi wrote that forward, because I'm now a fan of his.<br /><br />In the future of Old Man's War, humanity's way to the stars is through enlisting in the Colonial Defense Forces (CDF). The CDF is only interested in 75 year old citizens of Earth, as these candidates have a lifetime of experience to draw from and are very intrigued - for obvious reasons - in the rumors of a renewed youth offered by the CDF to recruits. Our main character is John Perry, a widower who takes the CDF's offer.<br /><br />I won't spoil the surprises Perry finds upon enlisting, but the science part of the science fiction is fun and believable, if not \\"hard SF\\" detailed, and Scalzi has a great sense of humor that comes through.<br /><br />The part of the book that really leaped out at me was the crowded and diverse galaxy that the CDF finds itself in. Most military SF, such as Starship Troopers and The Forever War is presented as humanity against a single hostile race, with no allies, no neutrals, no one else in the neighborhood at all. In Old Man's War, there's a wide variety of alien species out there that humanity has to compete with, and there are even some that they're friendly with (though, given Perry's military affiliation, we don't see much of the friendlies in this book). This diverse galaxy may be the norm for science fiction like Star Trek, but it's refreshing to see a military SF novel with this take. It presents a much more interesting, believable galaxy.<br /><br />You also don't always fully understand the motivations of these other species, as Scalzi does a good job of illustrating that their alien psychology is, in fact, alien without then demystifying everything in a simple infodump. At the close of the book, the most important and powerful alien species out there is still important, powerful, and not yet completely understood, despite the knowledge earned in this story, and I actually like it that way.<br /><br />I don't think I'd put Old Man's War on quite the same tier as the classics of military SF like Starship Troopers and The Forever War, as it doesn't focus as much on hard issues like those do, but nonetheless, it's a very entertaining read, and not everything - even in military SF - has to be grimdark all the time.<br /><br />If you enjoy military science fiction, SF with humor, or SF that focuses on humanity's interaction with other species, I heartily recommend Old Man's War. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and will be reading the other three books Scalzi has written in this series.his take.

B004J4WNL2|5.0|It's so wonderful reading a book that helps me understand and love myself.  I am an seasoned introvert and I am loving it more and more.
0446547654|2.0|I was a fan of Sparks from the beginning. Bought every book - loved the Notebook especially.  But, to me, each book keeps getting more and more pathetic.  Someone gets cancer, someone dies, love found and lost.  All set in the Carolinas.  It has gotten old.  And without spoiling anything, this book is crammed full with situation after situation of heartache and tragedy.  By the end, I kind of knew what was going on and I didn't like it.  My life is tough enough without reading this bummer of a story in my free time.  I just felt so sad for the main lady.  Pass this one by or get it from the library if you must read.
B006KX3GXO|1.0|its was great at first and then it wouldn't let me edit any more pictures :( it just ducks now
B004HW7JHE|5.0|Early season review of the season's content only:<br /><br />In spite of the nay saying reviewers, we've already had a magnificent episode in E05: Signal 30. As we fast approach the midpoint of the season, the trajectory of the season is at least somewhat apparent. Don seems to have learned a lot from his mistakes in season 4. But all the while, many of Don's colleagues are learning these lessons themselves, the hard way. And the turmoil that many of the characters face are echoed in the ongoing unrest of the excallating conflicts surrounding the Civil Rights movement, as well as other historical signs of cultural tumult. Roger and Pete experience the pains of their respective failures and successes. Joan finally wins something of a victory, but it is completely bitter-sweet. Peggy even drunkenly admits that she isn't sure if she wants it all anymore. Everyone feels the changing times, but whether they will rise to meet them or fall in utter ruin is yet to be revealed.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|With my busy scheduale I have to be up at 5;40 AM each morning. Being my age (14), and having to wake up at this time is so hard and I have to say that the normal Heep's do nothing but temporarily wake me up. Thisnon.the other hand is easy to use and makes waking up a lot better. Love how it starts out quiet its like a warning for your.wake.up
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it!  Would definitely recommend it if you love action, adventure, and reading outside of the norm.  I loved Cinna and the rest of the group too.  I must say that Peeta was my favorite.  LOVE HIM!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is fun and addicting! its great to pass time but also easy enough for kids to play and get the hang of.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the most bestest bestest bestest game I have ever ever played ha ha ha ha ha you should play it
B0055SWM08|4.0|Nice musical ambience.  Appreciate the variety of puzzles while maintaining a &quot;minute to learn, lifetime to master&quot; vibe.  Would rate this a very strong buy for puzzle fans.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|this app has gotten me and my family organized! each of us has our own color and it is easy to use.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great puzzle game! took me over a week to beat it. hints are available if you can't figure a level out. 4 secret levels too :-)
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I read a few of the reviews and noticed some complaints. It's true that The Notebook was a more powerful story, but don't underestimate this one. IT's a great tale on paper--read it before you see the movie! Sparks has a way of creating characters that feel like real people too.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I would give it 5 stars but it doesn't give you many lives and gets boring after a while.<br />I love it because the controls are great and respond quickly..I have been searching for a Mario game like this and I finally  found one :)
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Its fun, and makes you manage your money, energy, how teaches you how they had to live. It was nice to see it really was, after learning about it in history.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|We really enjoyed this album several years go when it was first released.  We bought a copy for a friend who had recent brain surgery.  Hearing the songs helped her memory and recall during her recovery.  A great album with many of the Eagles best songs.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Losing sleep over this game. Great fun!  I would recommend to all who enjoy a challenge. Well worth the price!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I 've played many versions but this is 1 of the best &amp; toughest. This will keep you busy for awhile.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|If this is a kindle fire edition,  I wonder why it says the app is incompatible with my device.  Uninstsll!!
B00005V0X5|4.0|Most of the tracks are pretty raw and fast paced.  Still the early days of Megadeth so they hadn't quite found their sound but this album is a must have for fans of the band or any fans of early thrash.
B006R8GK2Q|4.0|Enjoying this game, can be somewhat confusing at times. Plays well on my Toshiba Thrive tablet. can't wait till I can get back and continue the game play.
B004ZG5EYC|5.0|It is a fantastic french movie!<br />it arrived in no time and I can now watch it as many times as I please.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I know it's scary.  It's probably one of the longest and hardest to read books you've ever picked up (or at least it was for me).  Hugo goes into painstaking detail with his history, his scenery, and his character development.  Reading on can be frustrating sometimes because you just can't see where the author is going.  Minute descriptions of people, places, and political views abound.  But you come to trust in Hugo...because you realize that no lengthy discussion is wasted with him.  It has a purpose and a place and provides a richness to his story that I have never seen in any other work.<br /><br />The scope and depth of the story is UNBELIEVABLE.  The characters are so completely flesh and bone that you know them.  You know who they are and exactly how they will react in a situation before it ever happens.  The scenes are so masterfully laid out that you can envision every detail in your mind.  And oh, believe me when I say the storytelling is breathtaking.  Les Miserables is about poverty and the human condition, set against the backdrop of decades of French history.  But it is so much more.  It's a story of the redemption of man, despite everything the world can throw at him.  It is a story of fear and sadness, but most of all, hope.  The hope that we can do better.  The hope that religion will not lead us down a path of self-righteousness, but to true righteousness, which to quote the book of Isaiah is \\"to loose the chains of injustice and untie the cords of the yoke, to set the oppressed free and break every yoke\\".  There is so much to be learned about forgiveness, love, happiness, and life from this story.<br /><br />Les Miserables is not just a book.  It might be the best book ever written.  It is a LIFE CHANGER.  Don't be afraid of it.  Experience it for yourself.
B006AX6ONI|5.0|Mark Cuban's book, \\"How to Win at the Sport of Business\\" is an excellent book!! Mark writes it as if he is your best friend, standing face to face with you, giving you the Cliff Notes version of business. Thanks for the great advice Mark!!
B006Z9SP3E|3.0|I was looking forward to this book, having read the first in the series last November. Its between 2 and 3 stars for me. Not much happens, feels like a bit of a filler. Maybe its because I was reading it on my kindle which doesn't give the same obvious sense of reaching the end of a novel as an actual book, but when I got to the end of the book I couldn't believe it was over! Unsatisfying ending if ever there was one.
6304711905|2.0|With a cult following as long as this one, I'm surprised at how little critical attention this one received.  I mean, back in '93, this was considered a lukewarm gunslinger and really only gained praise for Val Kilmer's turn as Doc Holiday.  Now, you won't find many who would put this down.  In fact, I've had many a friend tell me not to bother wasting time on the '94 film `Wyatt Earp' and only watch `Tombstone', which they all claim to be superior.  Of note, `Wyatt Earp' actually received an Oscar nomination for its cinematography, a feat that `Tombstone' couldn't manage; but it also racked up five Razzie nominations (winning two), another feat that `Tombstone' didn't attain.<br /><br />I haven't seen `Wyatt Earp'.<br /><br />It has taken me quite a while to finally see `Tombstone', but nestling onto the couch this past weekend to indulge in yet another `manly' film I'm required to like had me questioning my manhood yet again.  I mean, this happened when I watched `Braveheart' and got to thinking that it was a beautifully shot soap opera wrecked with vapid excuses for stereotypes.  My friends berated me and the Ammy community took strike against my three star review.  Watching `Tombstone' felt roughly similar in that it felt completely void of any real point.  It was just another gunslinger with big names and no real dissection of character.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I like my films to SAY something about the subject they embody.  Films that exist solely to show a montage of action sequences don't do a thing for me.  When you litter those action scenes with horrifically amateurish acting, I have an even bigger problem.<br /><br />So, while watching the film I couldn't help but imagine ways in which this film could have been something better.  First, the only great performance here is Val Kilmer.  The fact that he was Oscar snubbed (really snubbed of everything except two MTV Movie award nominations, one for `Most Desirable Male' which only tells me that the voting body, most likely consisting of teenage girls, didn't actually watch this movie and merely voted for him because he's Val Kilmer, since his sickly interpretation of Doc Holiday is anything but desirable) is a true testament to the mundane quality of the film itself.  He is surrounded by average to mediocre to just plain awful acting.  Kurt Russell tries, but ultimately fails to bring anything remotely `true' to his portrayal of Wyatt Earp.  I mean, he look ridiculous and then goes all banshee at the end, which feels so forced and silly (\\"The law is coming!\\").  Sam Elliott kind of survives this with his grumble, but he's somewhat forgettable.  Forgettable is a godsend when you consider that Bill Paxton and Michael Biehn are unforgettably horrible in this movie.  UGH, and to think I used to have some sort of man crush on Bill Paxton and `wanted' to see him movies.<br /><br />Just...no.<br /><br />As far as the film itself, the scripting is somewhat skeletal.  I never felt like I really knew who these men were.  They are just kind of there and yes, they are tough.  Doc Holiday is the only character who feels lived in, and a lot of that is due to the way that Kilmer embodies the man.  He really drives this film.  The lovelorn triangle between Earp, his drug addicted wife and the pretty actress is domineering and foolishly handled and I just wish it had been ripped from the film entirely.  I know that it is somewhat representative of fact, but if you can't flesh it out to where it feels genuine then don't bother representing it at all.  The final scene alone made me want to barf it was so pathetic.  Seriously.  We run out into the street and laugh?  That leads me to the awfully clich&eacute;d score.  I hated it.<br /><br />So, see this for Kilmer.  Or just don't see it.body, most likely consisting of teenage girls, didn't actually watch this movie and merely voted for him because he's Val Kilmer, since his sickly interpretation of Doc Holiday is anything but desirable) is a true testament to the mundane quality of the film itself.

B007SYWFRM|1.0|I had to shut off my Kindle Fire just to get out of the game. Needs more work. Needless to say it has been taken off.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun game! I've had no issues with it and I'm using a kindle fire. great free game but would have purchased it as well
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love love love. ae<br /><br />love log love l<br /><br />love love lov<br /><br />love this game!  I cant believe its free. I thought this would be the type of game that I would eventually get bored of but so far so good.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This first book of the trilogy makes you want to read more and more into the twisted life of Christian Grey. How could you not hate and love him at the same time??? A must read.
B007BLUD30|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for. Bought one at drug store, had \\"massage\\" feature but the massage nodules in back and seat were hard and uncomfortable. Also, I do not use nor need the massage feature. So I looked on Amazon for a car heating pad that had no massage. I found one, great price, and came in two days with regular shipping price.  Great heat too, heating back and seat.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This one will keep you reading. I couldnt put it down once I started. I laughed, then cried then laughed again. It is very well written. My favorite book by far.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am currently reading the third book and am thoroughly enjoying them all. I was a little confused as to the text on book one, it changed from large text to small text in the middle of the book. However I did not find the number of misspellings in this book as I have found in other Kindle books. That was refreshing! Can't wait to see the movie.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|The game is really fun especially if you know the movies! It keeps you going in the game so you won't get bored. I recommend this game if you like village games or if you are a first time player to village games you should get it. DOWNLOAD NOW!!!! ITS FREE!!!!!! WOOHOO!!! :P
0345803493|5.0|ok finished 50 Shades Darker last nite and what a night it was and what an ending! possible spoiler info.....not much....oh anyway I didnt think it was possible for the 2nd book to be better than the first 50 Shades of Grey but it was! The love story that opens up with these 2 is amazing how they are apart and find their way back to each other bc neither one can live w/o the other! i love the way that she shows christian changing morphing into this wonderful man that realized he doesnt need all the other stuff if it means losing the woman he never thought he'd find miss Ana Steel.These two characters are so contradictory and conflicting, and yet complement each other so well. Each trial, every obstacle, every hardship the two experiences are overcome and ultimately strengthen the relationship. The crash wakes everyone up for the better. This is truly one of the most amazing love stories I've read.Ana is a bit jumpy she likes this but doesnt that she is bold then she isnt but i still love the character she is and admits she cant live w/o \\"50\\" her man. And the new job that she has now envolves Jack a man that yes \\"50\\" was right wants in her pants....i love the emails btwn her and \\"50\\" as my hubby and i did this in our dating realationship often so it brought back memories. plot and characters A+ I love Taylor, hate Jack, hate Mrs Robinson, love Momma Grace, but the ending oh my i am starting 3rd book tonite. there are a milion more things i could so bc it was that good and i agree with the other review that i too would give it 6 stars if i could!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Great game fun to kill time with.  Mazes hopefully get more challenging as the game goes on.  works great with galaxy s2
B002PA8Q1S|5.0|I love this movie and book so much that I came up with a play inspired by it about two guys who become obsessed with emulating Patrick Bateman and end up getting carried away -- they eventually turn into Wall Street Executives. It's called THE AMERICAN PLAY and it will be seen in New York in June.    [...]
B007HJ84ZK|2.0|I've read the books, and mostly like the story as it unfolds with great depth and detail. I couldn't wait to watch it brought to visual life, and was hoping it would be adapted as well as Jackson's Lord of the Rings movies.  But I've watched a couple of episodes, and I just don't like it. Confusing direction, uninspiring acting, with only tiny glimmers of the strength of GRRM's writing coming through. I suspect it would be difficult for an intelligent viewer to understand (or care about) the paper-thin characters portrayed in these videos without having read the books. There's a really good story in the books, buy those instead.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works great on Kindle Fire! I highly recommend it. The graphics are really good and the app works like a charm.
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is truly an amazing story of Shin's escape from a North Korean prison camp. The reason I gave it 4 stars instead of five is that most of the book's story is already out there in the interviews and promotional materials for the book, although less detailed.<br /><br />The 'filler' in the book is background information on North Korea and it's leaders, which I already knew about being relatively well read in regards to North Korea. Overall it's a very fast read that I was able to finish in one day.<br /><br />Still, this is the book I will recommend to friends and relatives interested in reading about North Korea without delving into the more scholarly works out there. It really brings home the brutality while giving a light background on the regime.<br /><br />While I might recommend people more well informed about North Korea to skip the book and read the news articles and interviews pertaining to Shin instead, I have no regrets about buying this book at all, as the profits are split between the author and Shin, the subject himself, who really needs the support.
1451648537|3.0|I bought this book back in January of 2012 and just finished it (April, 2012).  Usually I am a fast reader, but this book took alot of effort to get through.  It's not that the story isn't great, it's just that it was apparent that the author had to figure out how to best group the information.  This resulted in the content of the book not necessarily being linear, time-line wise.  There were some parts about the book which probably could've been left out since it is a book about Steve Jobs, not necessarily about every product that Apple ever created (although it felt more like the latter the closer I was to the end of the book).<br /><br />If I was someone trying to figure out if I wanted to buy this book, I would say that it is worth purchasing.  To me, this book appeared to be written from the perspective of a kind Uncle trying to describe the personality quirks of a \\"unique\\" family member (although the author is not related to Steve Jobs).  The information included in the book is very (VERY) honest and many people said exactly what they thought about Steve.  There's no sugar-coating that Steve Jobs was very peculiar.  However, knowing how peculiar he was and that he still became extremely successful is part of the draw of this book.  It also shows that when someone is not in it for the money, but instead for the personal satisfaction of creating excellent products and working with \\"A players\\", that alot can get done.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|This item is lightweight and it works well. It pretty much is everything I want in a Kindle Fire cover. The most important feature to me was that the cover not add much extra weight/bulk. My biggest concern is the elastic strap that holds the cover closed. I am worried that it will stretch out and become worthless as time passes.<br /><br />Given that I'm agreeing with many other reviewers, why am I posting this review? I'm hoping to provide a tip to people who may be having A LOT of trouble getting the Fire to stand up as promised with this cover. I did not pay close enough attention to the pictures and my Fire kept plopping down flat on its back every time I tried to use the stand feature. Well I felt like a right idiot when I finally figured out I'd been folding the flap from the wrong direction. For the stand to work properly you need to fold the flap UP from the BOTTOM rather than down from the top. I realize I may be the only buyer who did not figure that out immediately, but things went much more smoothly once I realized that. Mind you the stand doesn't seem to work perfectly, but if you just cannot get it to stand up, check the direction you are folding from.<br /><br />Overall I think this is a pretty good product and I have not encountered any of the major issues described by others.
B004BCNVOA|4.0|Oddly enough, I haven't even watched the videos.  All the tracks are good, but I especially like the pop-rock ones.  The ballards are okay, but I don't connect to them as much as I do the ones that kick A** and take names.  Keep up the good work, P!ink :)
B007SYWFRM|5.0|runs great on the fire a lot to do.<br />its pretty fun and does not have the energy system most of these games do.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Fun game, I didn't even mind the waiting as I could play the game for a few mintues and do something else for awhile, but my buildings and everything started resetting their timers to 48 hours apiece, and thats jus rediculous for a game like this. I am pretty sure its a bug but since I can't do anything I just uninstalled it.
B0061S0A64|5.0|love the simple and intuitive interface.  I love music and this app lets me make my own tunes.  there's a surprising depth as well.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|may not be like dh1 and 2 but tbh... those were horrible dungeon crawlers. this is how they should have done the whole series! its great!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Well done graphics and sounds! I also like not having ads.This game is going to be recommended to all out my friends.
B005COO1X6|2.0|this was so far off the path that I did not even finish it  and had no desire to do so.  I have read many Stephen King book but this one was definitely not for me<br />The reason I checked it out was because I am from the area in Maine that was the setting but was very disappointed.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game hours of fun. this game is very addictive, and the graphics are awesome. would recommend this game to everyone. thanks.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app makes it so easy to find gospel gold . I recommend morning mining :) Enjoy and. keep on praising the Trinity!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|considering its free its pretty good to by pass time.<br />I recommend it to those who want little different games to play.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|fun and cute game.  good for kids and adults.  easy to use and walks you through it.  want to find more yams like it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Mario clone but pots of fun. and who cares it is free. brings back memories.  hope fun continues<br />after a few rounds

0345803485|1.0|This is truly the worst book I have ever started to read and the first I was not able to finish. The main characters are completely obnoxious, there is no story line, the writing is bad and  I turned fifty shades of purple laughing at the deflowering of Ana. Then I gave up and deleted the drivel.
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Wish it was the ipad version I saw in the TV add but regardless, my daughter loves reading this story and turning the pages as we read it on the kindle fire. I hope they come out with an android version of the book that is animated and interactive.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I am not a fan of this book. There are a lot of characters to follow, its \\"wordy\\", dreary, and typical. It drags. Blah. There are so many well written books that can capture one, I wish I had not spent the money I did on this purchase.
B0039J654O|3.0|Great price but a little worn out. some of the pages fell out but what do expect when it is used.
B005VPRET4|5.0|This whole series by Lego is awesome! I bought it as a birthday gift for my 5 year old niece and she loves it. She definately needed help putting it together, but she didn't get frustrated, we just had to assist. Some people are \\"anti\\" because it is a \\"girls\\" toy, but at the end of the day, most girls like girly things. I hope Lego creates other sets (and I am sure they will). I appreciate the variety of price-points as well.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the games are fun and challenging for kids and adults. they are short easy to learn and entertaining. recommend to all
B005PK1G76|5.0|After initially purchasing the adult cupholder from Britax and becoming quickly frustrated with it, I began my search for something different. I ordered the Diono Buggy Buddy after reading so many great reviews, and it is exactly what I needed. I love that it folds up easily with my stroller and holds two large drinks securely. I was also pleasantly surprised that the middle compartment is large enough for my Nikon DSLR, phone, and wallet. I would definitely buy again!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I love this app!!!!!  The only thing I don't like is that they usually don't have tthe right time up ; for example,  right now it says that it 's 10:52, but it 's really 11:15.<br />Other than that,  an app totally worth getting for your Kindle Fire!!!!
B0061S0A64|5.0|this is well worth the price. it is appealing to both sight and sound. i can be a composer all by myself!!
B0061S0A64|5.0|this is so awesome. you get to make cool sound and music. at first I did not know do it. but nltotally get it!!
0439023483|5.0|I was a wee bit disappointed because there was no dust jacket, and I don't remember seeing that noted in the description, but I won't  take away stars because it could have said it and I just missed it. It wasn't packaged extremely well, but decent. No markings or other problems with the book and it was shipped quickly.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Best Bible app out there. The reading plans are Great &amp; Easy to follow, I Love how easy it is to share on Facebook or Twitter. Would Totally Recommend using this app to anyone :)
B0061S0A64|5.0|I absolutely love this app. I'll probably purchase it just to support the devs. I ran my RAZR dead twice today playing with this. If you love ambient music you will adore this!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I get a little iffed seeing the 1 star reviews from people. But, everyone is entitled to their own opinion. So, here's mine. This book was fantastic! I loved their screwed up relationship, it WORKED for them. Yes, it was hyped up and dramatic, but that is what I expect from a book, and this did not disappoint! Being a college student myself, I found myself laughing with the characters and their partying. Because, uh, well, that's what goes on in college. This book is NOT a young adult book, it is a romance book. Do NOT let your 12 or 13 year old child read this. There is explicit sexual conduct in this book. And it was amazing! Finally, an author not afraid to embrace that side while still keeping a good base story. The sex didn't control the book, but it was a big part of Travis's and Abby's relationship. Which in my view, is realistic and entertaining. I enjoyed the book, I've read it 3 times over. Travis is swoon worthy, and Abby is a sweet, yet tough girl. And they go beyond that even, to the point you feel you know each character personally. Jamie McGuire is an author I am now keeping tabs on!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game is a lot of fun and addictive! once you figure out how to leave the game using the &quot;stuff&quot; menu. the User friendly interface could be better. I wish it gave you more intonation about each of the animals. When I connected the game to my facebook account it freaked out! I had to try and restart the game at least 5 times. it was quite frustrating. Now one of the tasks wants me to go visit other villages and the game keeps saying I need to update and restart in order to be able to visit, but that still doesn't fix the issue. don't know what's wrong. lot of fun for free but some of the bugginess is frustrating!
B0055SWM08|5.0|awesome!<br />fun and challenging. I enjoy this game. the music is soothing and I feel likeit keeps my mind sharp.
0307592839|5.0|I really enjoyed the journey this book takes you on.  The story in itself is great, but the writing technique that Egan uses made it even more interesting.  Every chapter is told from the perspective of a different character, jumping through time, gives the reader a much broader perspective.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|very fun very fun very fun very fun, keeps me busy. I cannot stop playing. very challenging,  this game can make you angry,sometimes , but then I win.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|always loved playing Mario bros now its with an Irish theme.  works great on the kindle.  even my 3 yr old likes it.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Mk so, this game is one of those games you MUST play frequently. Something might run away or spoil if not. Very Addictive. I love it and it plays great on my Kindle Fire.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game is so much fun and you can use both all of your imagination and you get told what to do
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its a fun way to pass the time. I don't think ill ever get bored of this! I find this much better than the other virtual city games.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome. just wish there wasnt special currency for cool things... but its a lot of fun none the less. the graphics are cute. i wish energy didnt take so damn long to show up too. fix that and the game will be perfect.
B007SSDS24|5.0|The Darkest Hour I was on the fence about because of reviews, but I decided to try it and am glad I did, it starts off giving the story as is typical and then quickly picks up keepin you in the action the majority of the time. The ending was good for ending this part of it and leaving it open for another part to the story, which I would definitly see aswell.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|We really enjoy it. I dont like you need to buy acorns to get special and cool stuff but I do like that there is no energy limit.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Even though you have heard that this book contains a lot of sex, you must look past that and into the touching story of two people falling in, what they consider, love.  It starts out a little slow in the beginning but then leaves you wanting to read just one more chapter.  I gave the book a chance after reading an online article about it.  I loved it so much I ended up getting the other two books in this series.  Most girls dream of finding that rich man that sweeps us off our feet into a lavish, exciting lifestyle.  This series puts a whole new twist on that.  Enjoy!
B007BDK3SS|4.0|Fun game<br />I wish I could play.longer. too bad the full version is not free<br />I do recommend this game.
B005COO1X6|2.0|I must admit I am a kindle junkie now. I love giving the Indies writers a shot..Mr. king should be ashamed at having this story released with so many errors. I have read good free books with far fewer mistakes. Stephen-I want 2 bucks back!!!!
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I think its a good app but it still needs some work. like make it more realistic.  also the graphics could be better.
B000068OCS|4.0|Got this dvd mainly for the music but oh my, the visual bombardment was out of this world! Half way into the movie, is a visual plethera of images that enlightens one's imagination & brings you back to a time & memory you'd long forgot. Great stuff!!!! Only took me 30 years to discover this film sigh, better late than never eh! The lights, the camera, the ....
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I chose to read Beautiful Disaster because I had been hearing so many good things about the book from reviewers and bloggers that I like and respect.  The story drew me in immediately with the opening scene as something out of Fight Club.  I personally hate fighting and never understood why guys would volunteer for that kind of punishment.  That being said something about the fight scene fascinated me and pulled me in like no other book.  I related to Abby and identified with her stunned reaction yet physical attraction to Travis.  I loved the dialog between Abby and Travis.  There is nothing sexier than a man who knows what he wants and Travis is just that man.  Travis falls for Abby and Abby is determined to stay away from anything that reminds her of her drunken gambler father.  Her father was a professional Vegas Poker player who famously claimed his daughter stole his luck.  Abby is tired of all the whispers and stares and wants to start a life of cashmere sweaters and preppy frat boys.  Travis as a Fight Club member and the campus man-ho is too close to Vegas for Abby to even consider.  The story is so compelling and full of plot twists that I couldn't put it down.  This book has everything I usually hate fights, violence, borderline abuse, and characters to stubborn to admit they love each other.  But I absolutely loved this book and it will be one I re-read with frequency.<br />Warning:  Travis and Abby are often like oil and water and at times Travis seems almost close to abuse.  He is definitely all Alpha Male.  So if this is not your thing, I don't think this book is for you.  But if you keep an open mind, you just might love it as I do anyway. :)
B00756GKBA|5.0|Madonna is back; \\"Turn up the Radio\\" will go number 1 :) MDNA is a great CD love it. The album is great another number one hit.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|I love this CD. It stays in my mind all day. The songs that burrow into my soul are Going Home, Amen and Show Me the Place.
B00785P2QC|4.0|such a cute little game. I liked it a lot. I hope you like it too. the end of my sentence.
B000026KG7|5.0|I, am a big Deep Purple fan, even though I was only nine years old when this, their self-entitled third album,was realeased. I got into 60's music big time in my early 20's, the Beatles, Doors, and Deep Purple, oh yes. I got into all of the 60's bands back then (the early 80's, which wasn't the best era for music,lets face it, lol). But what is strange is that for years I have owned most all of Deep Purple's albums, my favorites being their first two, Shades of Deep Purple and Book of Taliesan, but I never owned this, their third. Well, my GOD IT ROCKS!!! I LOVE IT!! i KNOW that I have heard some of these songs on this album, but to think that I never owned the actual album, humm. Psychedellic music has always been a favorite of mine, and the way that this band blends it with progressive rock is phenomonal! I DECIDED TO order it from a vendor in England, to my way of thinking this made it even more authentic, being that Deep Purple is from England, lol. Took longer, but it was worth it. Any Deep Purple fan will love this cd. And take it from me, if you love a band, REALLY LOVE A BAND, Always check out their ENTIRE CATALOG OF MUSIC!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is boss. its like leprechaun Mario bros. the graphics are really good if you like cartoons. I love it. peace out.
B003Y5H5F6|4.0|I saw the 2D version of Underworld Awakening in the theater, and I was totally entertained the whole time. Unfortunately, that whole time amounts to just 88 minutes, kind of short for a feature film, IMHO. Still, I'll be buying this when it comes out. Shakespeare, it is not. Underworld Awakening falls into the catagory of movies that are just plain escapist fun. If you want deep meanings and layered characters, you will need to look elsewhere. Plot is minimal, but action is nonstop.<br /><br />  On another note, I have been all over Amazon here and the internet trying to find information on any extras in this blu ray dvd edition. I finally found the following, which I got from a site called Blu-Ray.com. I include it for everyone's information, though I have no confirmation the information is accurate on all points. With a run time of only 88 minutes for the film, Sony certainly has plenty of room on a blu ray disk for all of the following:<br /><br />Sony is offering the feature in two Blu-ray versions - a Blu-ray/UltraViolet Digital Copy combo pack and a Blu-ray 3D/UltraViolet Digital Copy combo pack. Both sets present Underworld: Awakening in its 2.39:1 original aspect ratio with 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio tracks alongside the following bonus supplements:<br /><br />Cracking the Underworld picture-in-picture experience<br />Filmmakers' commentary<br />Five behind-the-scenes featurettes: - Selene Rises<br />- Casting the Future of Underworld<br />- Resuming the Action<br />- Building a Better Lycan<br />- Awakening a Franchise, Building a Brutal New World<br />Blooper Reel<br />\\"Heavy Prey\\" music video by Lacey Sturm feat. Geno Lenardo
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'll keep it brief......How many times can the author write \\"my inner goddess\\" in one book? Answer: to many.  Waste of money IMO. Would give Zero Stars if possibe.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Of the three books I liked this one the least and the middle one the best. It's not a bad read but not as compelling as the other two in the series. My biggest negative impression stems from the ending which after a lot of build up seemed rushed into just a few pages. As others have noted perhaps this is a more realistic ending than other possible ones but for me it felt unsatisfying.
B002VKE1K2|4.0|Pros: A refreshing horror thriller diverting from the overused see-um villain killing unlikable doucebags & going with a never-see-em villain psychologically tormenting people who don't have a stick up their asses, though Katie is annoyingly wussy.<br /><br />Cons: Do they EVER go to work? how can they afford a house that size? I live in a house with 3 working adults & we can only afford a rental home half that size. At least in the 3ed movie you knew that one worked from his house & that his job made sense for him to be accustomed to carrying cameras around.<br /><br />Recommendations: Franchise works in reverse order. I recommend watching 3 first, then 2, then 1. If you want a suspense thriller with more substance, try this subtitled movie from Spain called \\"The Baby's Room.\\"
B0066W1AZK|5.0|it is free it is free it is free it is free it is free it is free it is free it is free. nothing more to say. chess is chess. great for daily mental work out. every will enjoy.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have not seen the movie, but if you want to stay up late with a gripping novel, this is the book to read. Once you enter into the mind of the society and especially Katniss, the main character, you will find yourself falling deep into the ethos of what is happening. There are 2 other sequels to this novel, and I hope to report on the other two. It  can lead you into another world that is deeply scary, but also lifts up the spirit of the human condition. A must read.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this.. a little time consuming but over all good! I'll def keep playing untill I unlock every game
B005YVTHT0|4.0|The graphics and interface are nice. The controls were surprisingly easy to figure out. The only drawback experienced at the onset was a bit of lag. I later was informed this is a PC issue, not an equipment issue. SteelSeries' customer service manager provided the following tips (see his comment beneath my review) should you experience 'laggy' behavior in the steering wheel that interferes with game play:<br /><br />1. Refer to the picture in the link below and make sure that you are not plugged in to any of these places. The USB 3.0 port is OK to use but try using both a 3.0 port and 2.0 port. Since 3.0 provides more power, it may be the better alternative.<br />[...]<br /><br />2. Make sure that your USB devices are set to be powered up at all times and that any power saving features are turned off.<br />Please refer to this thread for further information (steps 1 & 2 apply for all Windows OS, step 3 is ONLY for windows 7 users): [...]<br /><br />His advice helped, so I raised my review from three stars to four stars.<br /><br />When I originally wrote this review on April 18, 2012, Amazon's retail price was 33% lower than the initial price. As of my Sept. 13, 2012 update, the price is now 22% lower than the initial price. Factor that variability in when you decide to purchase.<br /><br />Rating: Four stars.
B004UID2LC|1.0|I have recently downloaded this app and thought it was awesome so I used it and a few songs into downloading it quit.... it quit because ot deleted the software that was able to hold Internet... so after houres of work to get it back I got it back and deleted the app.... the app didn't like that so it re installed itself after a few times of going through this it stayed off but then it would mess up my youtube online so the videos wouldn't buffer and the actual video was the size of my thumb..... after days of working on my youtube it was fixed I currnetly don't haven any probloms with the app... if thee was a way to rate it as a one star I would and I would reccomend you to rate it the same.... save your device and someone else's DONT DOWNLODE THE APP!!!
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Reading this book was an epiphany.  Although you may want to say \\"dah\\" to yourself and think this should be common sense.  This book helps you to truly change your life in the best possible way.
B004EPYZV2|3.0|Rent this film, if, for no other reason, to support the oh-so-talented Simon Pegg. The movie doesn't break any new ground, but if you need something to do on a slow day, there are worst ways to waste time.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|its fun but bate that once out of energy have to wait or pay for it and only way to get cash is by levels you finish
0345803485|5.0|I downloaded the 2nd book before I finished the 1st.  Then, downloaded the 3rd before I finished the 2nd.  Loved it!!!
B007EW9ISM|5.0|I had gotten this through its round of kIckstarter funding and it's easily the best iPad stylus out there. The way it feels to hold, it glides nicely and feels like, with the right app, you're just drawing. Highly recommended.
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|I'm a Wallander fan, so my review would not be an unbiased one. However I can say this: This is probably the best Wallender book of the series.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|This is an entertaining game to lose time in if you're waiting on something. Graphics are good. It's just as funny as the movies.
B004UHSB5A|3.0|Maybe a little too simple, tho. It gets boring after a while. And the games can get kinda long. But I like it.
0345803507|5.0|Just finished book one!  Loved it!! I am now ordering remaining two books.  I loved especially Ana's inner goddess and subconscious.  They are absolutely hilarious!! Very entertaining writing!!!  Can't wait to finish the other two!!
B007V2UGPE|4.0|good game wish you could customize your character more in these glue games and less interest in the gold coins. id also like to see something like zombielane for kindle unknown glue could do agreat job
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I bought this game on the ds &amp; loved it! I'm so glad they made it for the kindle too.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|love it its a nicely built copper pipe heatsink and keeps the temps down when overclocking recommend it to anyone looking for a stock upgrade
B000VSAEYI|3.0|We got this as a present, so had no say in it, but it looked like fun. The best part a slide, is more like a seat as you don't actually slide down it unless it is very wet and very firm. It doesn't stay firm enough for very long, so plan on adding more air to the section every day. The little pool behind the slide looks nice and deep, but there is a drain hole to keep the water level way down. We even tried plugging the hole up, but it doesn't plug very easily. So a deep section without much reasn for it being that deep. Just made it hard for smaller kids to climb into.<br />The big pool is nice, but very shallow. Plus the bottom of it was very slippery when set up on our deck. My kids took several bad falls getting into it or trying to walk across it.<br />I think this year I'll buy a plain boring pool as the fancier ones seem to be duds.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it I read it every day. I have never read the Bible and with all the plans available I have enjoyed and am dioing it. Plus all the other plans it is the greatest. Thank you
B006UG90RM|5.0|The long-awaited return of David Lee Roth to Van Halen is finally over. He sounds great on these tracks. Eddie Van Halen's (& Valerie Bertinelli's) son Wolfgang takes over on bass replacing original bassist Michael Anthony....Highly recommended!
B007SY3CEW|2.0|I immediatley regretted this purchase.  Not a good learning tool.  only able to play melody, no chords. very basic program.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun. Good game. Just enough options included to keep you motivated and interested. And the price is right! A good app.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is great on the kindle fire! You don't even have to buy anything :) Definitely worth it... I would have even paid for it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|play this game a lot.does very well on kindle fire.I have played several of this type of games and this one is great.
0439023513|5.0|I just finished and am still on such a high. Beautifully written ending. I almost did not want to read it because of the negative reviews. Anyone who sees no hope in this ending needs some serious anti-depressants. It's bittersweet yes, but very hopeful. So well written. This was my favorite book of the series. Lot's of action and the characterization/dialog was excellent. Got a little cheesy with the technology stuff at the end but all in all great.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I admire the Navy Seals for their dedication and integrity. This is a great book with an example of the sacrifice they give! Chris, I believe, didn't feel he was sacrificing much at all. Chris was truly dedicated to his job/Seals and completed his duty, guilt free and with honor!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Provides challenge and Vegas scoring so you can see how much you would be losing if you were really gambling.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Magic is understanding of Secret entirely with more knowledge, more awareness, exact point of view and day to day practices which are really changing my life for the better :-) ... my experience is simply beautiful. Thank you Rhonda, thank you Magic, thank you Amazon and I mean it from the bottom of my heart. I am now assured that this life is true precious gift, no matter where we are ... the most important thing is that I am feeling so blessed for finding this book which helped me understand ... well ... everything :-) Thank you all!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Ok... Dosn't Really Work 4 The Kindle Fire though when ever I try to leave the bar wasn't on the bottom. I like the game but it doesn't quiet work!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|At first I thought this app would be cheesey but its not I love it!!!!<br />It is my favorite game so far and would get it if I were you and it works amazing on the kindle fire!!!! :)
B005HSL626|5.0|this would have been even more awesome if they had that one fruit where you would have to slice 30 times in one go but overall the best game on any device
B000002P5R|5.0|Jimmy hendrix Forever!! 3 words.Viva Jimmy Hendrix.He was and Still Is one of the greatest master's of guitar.Great songs on this album ,Freedom is funky and groovin, I love Stepping Stone and Esy Rider. If had to pick the best Jimmy Hendrix song of all of time, I could't,But Mabey the wind crys mary is a favorite. But Enough talking and lets get  back to crankin the music.
B006OCM0G0|1.0|Was bored after one day. if you like just following a timer for fun, then this is for you. if you want to decorate or do anything then watch the time go buy, you have to be willing to spend some hefty cash.Do not let the little ones on unless you enjoy complaining about money or many accidental purchases. Guess Ill just have to keep waiting until Zynga brings Cityville and Castle to Android, until then Ill have to stick to Zynga. com. You have been warned. :-)
B0062NAX1U|5.0|this movie is the best yet by sherwood pictures. i love that it was set against the courage of cops on the job,but not in family
0545265355|5.0|I have never found a set of books that I, literally, could not put down, until this one.  My son loaned me his copies and I began reading one Saturday morning, and I never stopped until I reached the end of Mockingjay.  I cried so many times I can't count and, even now, the books are still with me invading my day-to-day thoughts.  I cannot let go of it, it was so real for me.  The character development of Katniss is unmatched in anything I have ever read.  By the second book, every thought and action she had made perfect sense to me because I truly understood this young girl and the events that led up to her actions.  The book literally came alive from the descriptive writing of Ms. Collins and I actually *saw* what she was trying to get across.  I felt like I was there experiencing everything with them.  Even though I am blessed with a large vocabulary, I find it very difficult to put into words the emotional response these books drew from me.  I can honestly say that this story and these characters will stay with me always, as if I had been there and seen with my own eyes.  It is probably the most pure and honest \\"love story\\" - if you can even call it that - I have ever come across.  Her love of family, friends, and community; deep, honest, and absolutely real.  It's what we should all aspire to be, as a people.  All together a first class read!
B000KRNCYY|5.0|Truly a must have of the Celtic Women music. A delight to listen to over and over. My friends, family and other love it when I put this CD on to listen. A wonderful addition to my music collection.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I win enough to make me happy. It's a fun version of Solitaire with fun graphics at the end if you win. Not bad for free.
B005EGXTEE|3.0|This was a brilliant quick read! Thoroughly enjoyable, bit of action to keep you intrigued and a few twists along the way. I'd recommend you give it a go, then you can rate or slate. It's a thumbs up from me and I have already downloaded the second book in the trilogy.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed the three books immensely.  Loved the writing, the sex scenes got to be redundant after a while but the story was excellent.  Read all three books in two weeks.
B00466HN6S|4.0|Cute movie if not a bit corny :) I bought it just in time for Easter this year and I enjoyed getting to watch it with my son.
031603441X|5.0|Wow!  This book is so good!!  Keith spends a lot of time talking about his childhood in England during & after WWII & I found it quite interesting.  My doctor is from England & he recounted similar feelings/stories to me.  What I find interesting is that the effects on children who grew up during this time is a lot different than what you would expect.  You might expect to hear terrible memories of fear & loneliness, hunger & devastation.  Instead, you hear about how children found playgrounds in bombed-out areas of their towns & how their parents' fears were not their own.  Keith's family background is very interesting, especially on his mother's side where his grandfather was a musician.<br />  Of course, the rest of the book is just as amazing.  I have been a huge fan of the Rolling Stones since I was 13 (way back in 1978) & I quickly became enamored by Keith Richards.  In fact, I wrote a book report on him for one of my classes & was reprimanded for having a \\"heroin addict\\" as one of my heroes!  I remember thinking, \\"But that's not why I like him!  That's not the only thing about him!\\"  To this day he remains one of my heroes & I think that he always will be.<br />  There are so many things to love about him, not the least of which is his honesty.  He seems to have been born with an old soul; wiser than the average person.  His understanding, command & love of American blues is truly astonishing & he seems to garner respect from these musicians just as he respects them.<br />  I had the honor of meeting Keith back in 1988 when he and his band, the X-Pensive Winos, were playing at the Hollywood Palladium.  He was open, engaging, friendly, honest, gracious-exactly how you would imagine him to be.  I think that his personality really comes through in this book & if anybody should know I thing or two about \\"Life\\", it's definitely Keith Richards!
0345803485|2.0|I skimmed this book before giving it to a friend to read while traveling and I could tell right away that it does not live up to all the hype.  So it was no surprise when my friend told me that she had not finished it yet.....and it has been two weeks!  So much for not being able to put it down...  I won't be purchasing the next two books.
B0072GPQNG|2.0|Very predictable movie.  The only saving grace in this film is that Steven Spielberg did not decide to change the ending from a typical Hollywood ending, to a more realistic cold German ending.  I won't spoil it for you, but you can guess the ending by looking at the cover of the DVD.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|This is a great time based build a village game. The mini games and in app movies make this app stand out. however to turn the app off you have to go to the apps settings menu to access the kindles bottom menu bar to get to the home screen instead of an in app log out which is confusing. Also I can only visit a small number of friends due to saying my app is outdated though I know its not. This makes the friend based quests very frustrating. I also noticed that if I use the in game option to connect via a social network my game no longer recognizes my wick signal which also makes the social part of the game frustrating. If those were fixed this would be a 5 star game.
B004EPYZUS|1.0|Tom felt the series needed some comic relief, so the \\"funny out of his element\\" computer hacker/expert continually makes jokes that bring the action to a screeching halt.  This comic relief character, when the tension is at it's height, has to say something \\"funny\\", not witty, that destroys the momentum of the moment.  The Mission Impossible series has always been a roller coaster ride with a thrill a minute.  This version is a Disney Tea Cup ride, with a thrill every 30 to 45 minutes.<br /><br />Terrible script, terrible acting, and terrible directing.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|LOVE this CD!  Beautiful  rich music.  Hugh Laurie is the greatest musician of our time!  If you don't have this CD, go buy it!
B006OB3K56|2.0|This is a typical addiction movie.  It doesn't matter if it's alcohol, or drugs, or sex, these films always ends the same -- on a down note.<br /><br />I don't understand all of the 5 stars.  It is a heavy drama that you can see the ending coming in the first 10 minutes of the film.  You know every one is going to self-destruct.  The screenwriter and the director should have given this film a different ending, a happy ending so we could say \\"Wow, I didn't see that coming!\\"<br /><br />Two stars for the two moments that were not depressing.  Although I can't remember which scenes they were.
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|When i first saw this watch i feel in love with it. And after i got them delivery to my house i felt even more. This watch is great i true love the way it looks on me.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this brings me back to when i was in school but this one is a little different.  i like it though.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great job on a classic solitaire game. That is seven words and they want twenty so I will stretch<br /> it out - did I mention free?
B000HC2LI0|2.0|I am huge fan, evidentely.  Otherwise, why would I spend money on the complete series... I have enjooyed this set for over 3 years now, did not get it at Amazon, but at a Best Buy store.  I have watched the whole thing once every year and now I am really disappointed with fact that many DVDs have somehow lost quality or even worse, don't work any longer.<br /><br />This is not like a movie my kids watch every weekend as happens in many families with favorite films, this is a collectors set where no individual disc has been played more than 5 times... ever!  They are not scratched, although I would have liked better packaging, as I have to be extremelly careful when getting them out of the pockets or putting them back.<br /><br />I began my 2012 marathon but sadly found out some discs start jumping from a chapter to another or right to the credits of the episode.  Also, sometimes, the image would get all weird, like when the discs have scratches.  Finally, some of them would not work on any of the 4 different DVD and blu-ray players that we have at home or the desktop or my laptop...  and I am just beginnin with season 2, I don't even want to try with the rest...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use it to sync my Droid phone and Kindle Fire. Awesome add to link up with Skitch too! Even the email feature is great.
0763644765|5.0|This board book is sturdy with thick pages and simple phrases- great to read to young toddlers (18 mos +).  The baby pictured is not gender specific, so it's great for both boys and girls.  All of my young children like this book, and have memorized it! We've read other ones too, but this one is a definite favourite! It includes the most popular household animals (cat and dog), so the children enjoy seeing them on the pages too.<br />This book is simple and clear, and so are the illustrations. It does not teach everything there is to know about potty training, but it is a very good start, and with it's help, both my 2 yr olds have consistently peed on the potty since before they were 2.  Pooping still needs to come, but they are still only 25 months. I may get a separate book to address the pooping aspect, but I do not recommend to other parents \\"everyone poops\\" by  Taro Gomi, so don't waste your money on that one.
B007SOQBCM|4.0|It can only get better with each update. Slowly but surely the FIRE will get all the great apps. This is a great app if you enjoy watching people play games on twitch.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great entertainment that can be enjoyed in two minute or hour increments.  will definitely recommend to any puzzle player or time waster.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|most games are fun but its not letting me get any more even with the points I have.  Would like to try some new ones.
B006P0FIB0|4.0|I must disagree with most reviews of this film, because I was tempted to not buy it when I read all the ones about it, but I thrust my instincts and bought it and I must say that is a really entertained version of a classic and I don´t ask for more, because all the films made it about the Three Musketeers where all the same. The actors and all the crew put their best effort for made the dialogs not boring, plus the 3D, that is not bad at all repelling  all bad reviews, made of this a nice action movie, worthy to watch.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I like the game! good graphics! Just use ur acorns in the game wisely. gets kind of repetative after awhile. u also need to add friends &quot;villages&quot;...which I don't like to do. overall kind of entertaining.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is cool ive already gotten a few more games and the games are pretty cute I think my five year old will even be able to play a few of them
1250008409|5.0|This is probably the easiest book on meditation I've read. I'm not sure if it will live up to all the promises on the cover, but I've been very pleased at the author's style and his stories that illustrate concepts.  Sort of a Mediation 101 or for Dummies book, it covers his experiences in mediation as a former Buddhist monk.  Most of it is easy to perform and doesn't require a lot of the stereotypical chanting or other exercises Westerners associate with meditation. A must read for someone just getting into meditation.<br /><br />If you're looking for something in-depth into Buddhism or meditation, you're looking at the wrong book.  As a self-help book, the idea is to get you to work on your mind and the rest of your life will hopefully fall into place.  This isn't a quick fix into solving all your problems, but it is a step into becoming less caught up in your thoughts and will help you learn to be more aware about your body and your environment.<br /><br />I've done some meditation in the past without understanding what it was all about.  I always thought I was to empty my mind, but the author makes it clear that it's not necessarily about that.  It's about not being carried away by thoughts.  He gives good analogies that seem to work well.<br /><br />If you want to learn the basics about mediation, this book is for you.  It can help you get the basics down and even gives you good practice for short periods of time.  I would recommend this book for anyone suffering from anxiety or depression.  It can really help break the cycle of negative thoughts.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The book was great, except it was kinda hard to follow because I hadn't read the first two! However I'm gonna order the first two.
B003TQKVGU|5.0|Very well written that does a great job on the subject.  The connection to prayer is a nice touch.  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in creating the world of their choosing.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I heard about Fifty Shades of Grey from a co-worker and was immediately intrigued.. I read the entire book in one day, I couldn't put it down. This is by far one of the hottest, well written books I have read in a very long time!!! I'm hoping she writes another one... Fast!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I bought the Trilogy knowing only that it had to do with fighting for food.  Was I ever in for a surprise!  I found myself wanting more and more each evening as I read and endured the adventures with Katniss and Peeta.  I have vivid memories of the challenges put forth for the tributes each day as they attempt to preserve their lives.  I can hear the buzz of the tracker jackers, the voices of families from the mocking-jays, the gnashing teeth of the 4-legged monsters, the force fields, the rescuing of Katniss, etc.  Katheryn did a great job making the reader actually feel a part of the book.<br />  I just saw the movie Hunger Games and it seemed like it went by so fast-I wanted to sit through it again. I actually had pictured Haymitch as someone short and stocky (not a big fan of Woody Harrelson).  The books are always better than movies but I am waiting for the next 2 to come to screen.<br />  Thank you Katheryn
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun fun game good graphics happy to get it for free not that paying for it would have been bad

B0054JZC6E|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME IT IS SO ADDICTING I PLAY IT EVERY DAY WHEN YOU PLAY YOU GET ATTACHED TO IT
0439023513|1.0|Just got through the last book, and it was no small feat.  I read book one in a day and gave it 5 stars.  Book two, i spent 3 days on and gave it 3 stars.  It took me two weeks to make my way through Mockingjay and I almost quit reading it altogether a couple of times.  It got one lonely star.  How did the series devolve so quickly into the muddled, unpalatable mess that was Mockingjay?  Not just the story arc but even the main characters became increasingly unlikable or just plain rediculous.  Very flat effort for the finale.
0061122416|5.0|This is one of the most enlightening and inspiring books I have read. The Alchemist teaches the importance of following your heart. All of us have dreams at some point in our lives. Unfortunately, as we become older, we get into a routine and dismiss those dreams as childish or impractical. It doesn't have to be that way. We all have a personal legend that can be realized, no matter how big or small. The Alchemist is a reminder that when we desire something with all our heart, the universe will conspire to help us achieve it.

B003I55BIA|4.0|I bought this book when it was on sale for $2.99 because it was featured on a blog I follow.  It had a few Twilight-esque elements to it (being forced to pair as partners in science class, he seemingly hated her when he secretly was attracted to her, he thinks he's no good for her...) but it managed to overcome those with the rest of the plot.  It was also a bit Romeo and Juliet, of course.  I think I read this in about two days.  It was a quick and easy read, which is what I was going for.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I've ordered this thing twice. First time, worked great but then I was careless with it and like 3 weeks later after having it, it broke which was understandable because I just ripped it out. However, the second one I ordered and received not even a week ago and it's already broken after using it once. It serves its purpose perfectly, don't get me wrong. But it breaks. So. Easily. Even if you do absolutely nothing to it.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|After hearing all the hype about this book and someone telling me everyone in their book club, from the conservative to the outgoing, was enjoying it so much they simply couldn't put it down I decided to see for myself what the fuss was all about.  It was not worth the $9.99 I paid for the book, in my opinion.  The sexual tension between the two main characters was exciting, but as soon as the sex actually started I found I was reading it with my nose wrinkled in distaste.  I prefer my romances to actually be romantic, not dominating, controlling, and bordering on abusive (even if the lead female does kind of enjoy the abuse... her uncertainty on whether she enjoyed it or not combined with her inexperience in the bedroom and desire to be loved made me angry).  At one point the book reached an absolutely disturbing point and I considered putting it down altogether.  I persisted, though.<br /><br />I will say that the final scene between the two characters was very emotional.  Disturbing, but emotional.  And the characters were developed well enough that I did purchase the second book (also for $9.99) because I wanted to find out what happened with them.  In short, I wanted to know if she could \\"save\\" him.  But the plots in both books basically read as an excuse to write a whole bunch of repetitive sex scenes that didn't do anything for me.  I did not purchase the third book, and from the reviews I have read I'm glad I didn't.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Excellent!  It was funny and sad, and descibed the emotions of all involved.<br />Alzheimer's not only affects the patient, but those close and dear.
B005KELQEU|5.0|This is well made functional product.  I like that it is made so that there is enough room in it to hold my kindle and the charging cord.  That way everything for my kindle can be kept together.  I love the lightweight material that the cover is made of, while at the same time the material is thick enough to provide protective padding for my kindle.

B004XUMPFQ|5.0|I rarely watch anything more than once, but a few shows have become staples in our household. We think of them sort of as \\"tv comfort food\\" and return again and again for any number of reasons. Firefly is one of those shows - All these years later, the dialoge sticks in your head and you realize you sort of quote it and find certain phrases popping up in daily life. For example...\\"See this? This is the chain of command. It's the chain I take and beat you with\\" or \\"Aim to Misbehave\\" and the always appropriate... \\"Big Damn Heroes\\". Firefly Fans did the impossible and forced the studios to give us a full length movie (Serenity) and there are discussion groups and forums based on Firefly all over the internet. One season only and the ripples Firefly created are as strong as those from the Star Trek universe!<br /><br />Additionally, we watch this both on DVD and via Amazon Prime Streaming using a Sony box and the picture has always been crisp and clear. Love the ability to stream Firefly instantly from anywhere!
B006PZBRCY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I thought it was a funny movie that the whole family could enjoy.  I saw the reviews and thought it would be an interesting movie.  I wasn't disappointed.  It had all the elements of emotion in it and I loved the special effects.  I've been telling friends and family to watch this movie.  Unlike \\"Margin Call\\" which was a waste of my time.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a good game to play when you are braking. Love that the Kindle Fires lets you know when your crops or energy is full.

B006R1T40I|5.0|I've loved Bonnie since the early '70s and have all of her albums. A couple of months ago, I looked to see if she had anything new coming up and was thrilled to have new output to look forward to.  So far, I've only had a chance to listen to it a couple of times, but am really enjoying it. I hope she does well with this, she deserves it!  She's a  terrific musician who's a real class act!

0938045768|5.0|I was referred to this book by a physical therapist. Its slow progression method is safe and effective. Not only does the program contained in the book build strength (which it does in spades!), it can help to heal old injuries by slowly and safely building up strength around the injured areas. The progression methods in the book are indeed slower than a 'traditional' weight training program, but the benefits far outway any negatives. Slow and steady wins the race.<br /><br />I am 43, was out of shape, and had old injuries that prevented me from serious weight training. The program in this book strengthened the areas around my injuries (pain is gone!)and have made me feel 20 years younger. I fully intend to get to level 10 in all of the BIG 6.<br /><br />Thank you Paul for helping me to feel good again!!!! YOU ROCK!!!!

B0011HF6GE|5.0|I absolutely love Bon Iver's music and this, to me, is their best so far. Standout tracks include Blindsided, Skinny Love, Lump Sum, For Emma and of course, Re: Stacks.<br /><br />Even if you fall into the category of not liking much of their music, the song Re: Stacks begs to be listened to over and over. I can't even begin to describe how incredible this song makes me feel when listening.
B003W5C0VW|5.0|I saw the film in the movie theater when it was released. I have been waiting all these years to be able to see it again. I am not disappointed,this is the Stones at their stripped down rauncyest. This dvd kicks ass!!!!!!!!
B006VA57CY|5.0|Downton Abbey is one of the best productions of the last several years. The direction, acting and props are right on for the period. Filming Location is spectacular and story line is addictive! I  would recommend this entire series to anyone!

0756405890|5.0|You've all felt it at one point or another. The desire. The craving. The urge to go to bed with a book. The new hardcover whose jacket you've taken off for safekeeping; falling asleep with one hand splayed over its naked, embossed cover. An old favorite, its edges worn and soft to the touch; it fits perfectly in the space beside you on your wrinkled sheets.<br />At around 700 pages, THE NAME OF THE WIND is the perfect shape and story to sleep with.<br /><br />(At least, I assume it would be, as I read this on an e-reader.)<br /><br />At the unassuming and immaculate inn just out of town, you'd never expect to find a contemporary legend in the quiet, red-haired, green-eyed innkeeper. But he is Kvothe, and when he finally tells his true story for the first time, it is one of love and loss, childhood inquisitiveness and hard-knock-life resilience, boarding school pranks and events that will change the course of the world. You don't believe in magic? You've never heard Kvothe tell his own story.<br /><br />Even without the tangible reassurance of a physical copy, THE NAME OF THE WIND easily slid into its position as my new favorite book. Somewhere in an alternate universe, J. K. Rowling and George R. R. Martin had a literary lovechild, who somehow stowed away on a ship bound for Earth, assumed the human name of Patrick Rothfuss, and, after wandering, bard-like, through many years of higher education, discovered the secret to turning words and ideas into gold.<br /><br />Remember those sleepaway camps and public library programs you attended when you were young, the ones where the performer would gather you and the other kids round the sleepy campfire or colorful hand-sewn rug? Remember how, at first, you were suspicious of this stranger with the odd hair or scruffy beard or clothing that audibly ruffled whenever he shifted positions? Remember how his voice sounded unfamiliar at first, unlike the dulcet tones of your own parents telling you bedtime stories? And then remember how, before you knew it, you were so far immersed into the story you forgot who was telling it and found yourself leaning forward, hanging on to his every mesmerizing word?<br /><br />That's kind of how THE NAME OF THE WIND was for me. The third-person beginning section was a little awkward, as I wasn't sure how I was supposed to feel about this Kote/Kvothe character. But as Kvothe stretched out his long-unused storytelling muscles and the book eased its loving way into first-person narration, I found myself as entranced as Chronicler and Bast were, sitting in that inn and listening to the never-before-told story of a contemporary legend.<br /><br />He has a sexy voice, what can I say?<br /><br />I could mention some minor quibbles I had with the book, like Kvothe's unfortunate near-\\"perfect-ness,\\" or how Denna skirts the edge of geeky-adolescent-boy's MPDG wet dream, but it totally and completely doesn't even matter because don't you know that the greatest artists can break all the rules? THE NAME OF THE WIND is an epic novel, part memoir, part boarding school tale, part wild adventure, and I just know that Kvothe's world is only going to expand from here in future installments. Recommended for anyone and everyone anywhere--except for maybe that hipster classmate of yours with the I-just-got-out-of-bed-no-really-I-just-did messy hair and black Free Trade coffee perpetually in hand who refuses to read anything that hasn't won the Nobel, Pulitzer, or Man Booker Prize. But who wants to be reading buddies with them anyway?mber how, before you knew it, you were so far immersed into the story you forgot who was telling it and found yourself leaning forward, hanging on to his every mesmerizing word?<br /><br />That's kind of how THE NAME OF THE WIND was for me.

1596912863|2.0|Thirty-something Jane Hayes has a secret addiction that's ruining her life: Mr. Darcy.  She can't help but expect every man in her life to be the dashing, charming hero of Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice' and when they fall short, she becomes more and more focused on finding her own Darcy.  She can't hide her secret from a great aunt, however, and is shocked when the older woman dies and leaves her a single gift: three weeks at Pembroke Park, a manor home where the Austen world is recreated and guests are treated to the fulfillment of their Regency dreams.  Will immersing herself in her fantasy cure Jane of her unrealistic hopes?  Or will the mystery and romance of the Park drive her further into her Darcy obsession?<br /><br />I was so disappointed in this book.  The premise sounds so wonderful, especially to a Mr. Darcy fan like me, but the characters are flat, the plot is thin and I felt as if I were trudging my way through every page.  Jane's constant indecision, her internal struggles with her obsession and her romantic dalliances all feel forced and unrealistic.  I just couldn't find much to like about the book, as much as I wanted to.  Cute as the novel could have been, it falls sadly short, and I believe that Austen fans can spend their time more productively with other works...
0345803485|5.0|I couldn't put these books down! The first book starts slow but really picks up eventually, especially in the next 2 books. It is a real page turner! I fell in love with the characters and the plot was intriguing. Its sexy and scandalous...definitely will be reading again! I hope she continues the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games --Loved, loved, loved this book!  I couldn't wait to read the next two!  The book was exciting,thrilling, and VERY entertaining!
0345803485|1.0|Cliched, uninspired writing marked by one-dimensional characters. I downloaded this blindly simply because it was the top book on Amazon, and couldn't have been more disappointed. I wasn't distressed by the BDSM, as were some 1-star reviews, but instead found the characters to be completely trite. The book was largely spoken dialogue between the two main characters, and they hardly get past \\"how's the weather?\\" or \\"I like you a lot.\\" in hundreds of pages.<br /><br />This series does have the honor, however, of being first trilogy I've ever not finished.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|All of Stieg Larsson's books are exciting and full of sub plot surprises. Lots of Odd Characters ,intriguing, interesting twists and turns. Truly entertaining<br />Robin Clark
B00669LN0K|5.0|My favorite Austen book with Pride and Prejudice a very close second.  This is a faster read packed with emotional impact and enjoyable characters.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Spider is my favorite solitaire.  I like the tap function.  Easy to learn.  You can start simply and progress at your own rate increasing the number of suits used.
0439101360|4.0|A classic I always enjoy reading.  Such an endearing story.  Timeless characters that you love to come visit again and again.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I am loving this visually stunning game! The achievements are rewarding and fun. There is a major glitches though in the social area- I can not seem to visit the friends I've added. The program wants to update and restart to fix it. This doesn't fix the issue developers!!! Other than this the game truly is 5 stars but this flaw is sucking - please fix!
B00633QNP4|5.0|Always a great read.  Characters are so endearing but also real in their good points and flaws.  Just great writing as a whole like always with Austen.
0763644765|5.0|My son loves to sit on the potty and read this. We've only had it a week and already he has it memorized and \\"reads\\" it to himself. So many children's books are kind of annoying to read, but this book (and every other one we've purchased by Leslie Patricelli) are just really cute.
B000GWJGMU|4.0|Subtle humor that is truly enjoyable.  Characters that are silly but endearing.  Good twists and turns and a happy ending as always with Austen.
B00006AW2G|5.0|Anyone with a pair of working ears (they don't have to work perfectly, mine sure as hell don't) and good taste would have to place \\"Let It Bleed\\" in the very top tier of Rolling Stones albums, and thus among the greatest rock albums ever made. No doubt about it, this is a classic, from the first note to the last.<br /><br />Speaking of the first note, the intro to \\"Gimme Shelter\\" takes 1st place in my list of the greatest song intros of all time, a real tour de force from the twin guitars of Keith Richards and Mick Taylor. The sound is menacing, mysterious, haunting, and yet irresistible. You feel like the darkness is about to overtake you. And then the song kicks into high gear, and it is as magnificent as the intro led you to believe. Coming in the wake of the assassinations of MLK and RFK, of race riots, of the escalation of the Vietnam War, this song encapsulates the feeling of dread that engulfed the western world. The message in the song: \\"War, children is just a shot away....Love, sister, is just a kiss away\\" says everything that needs to be said.<br /><br />And \\"Gimme Shelter\\" is just one of the amazing songs here. Others include \\"Midnight Rambler\\", another menacing rocker that alludes to a Jack The Ripper sadist roaming around, \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\", with its gorgeous melody and intro from the London Symphony (I believe), the kick-ass rock funk of \\"Live With Me\\" and \\"You Got The Silver\\" featuring the lived-in, whiskey-soaked voice of a then very young Keith Richards.<br /><br />Simply put, if you've never heard this record, you are in for a MAJOR treat. Put it on, listen to it without distraction, and play it a few times, until it seeps in to your brain. Once it is there, you will never be able to get it out, and the good news is, you will have no desire to.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Captivating, exciting, imaginative and sweet. These are the adjectives which come to mind. I haven't finished it yet, but dying to know the outcome.
B004CSKCS6|5.0|In response to the reviewer who states the UK blu ray is region B, that is incorrect, at least for the limited edition version, I can't say for sure about the later version but it seems odd that the original uk blu ray would be region free but not the later<br />one.<br />Amazon reviews are becoming useless as so many reviewers give inaccurate, biased or non-specific information.<br />The limited edition UK bluray is definitely region free, I have it and it plays on my North American Samsung player. It also has more extras than the anchor bay version. Picture quality of either one is excellent (I have seen both).
0375869026|5.0|I'd heard about this book from several sources and was so happy to receive a copy of my own.<br /><br />The story is about a child with a fairly significant facial deformity and follows his first year in a public school. As the book progresses, the story is narrated from the viewpoint of different people who know him as the protagonist takes on the challenges of his new school.<br /><br />I really don't want to give away much more of the plot, but this book moved me to tears several times. Everyone in the house (ages 11-57)  has read it now and we all loved it. I'd like to think that everyone could learn from the characters in the book, but there will always be those who will never have the empathy to see why cruel jokes are \\"harmless\\".<br /><br />I believe that there is good in most people and reading a book like this will open their eyes to the way other people can negatively affect their lives.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is a must read book, especially for middle-school aged children.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|This book came to my attention from media coverage of the long theater lines for the first Hunger Games movie.  Judging from the audience, I was expecting something \\"more Twilight, less Lord of the Rings\\" and the Suzanne Collins trilogy delivered.  Sometimes overly adolescent and full of teenage angst, this was balanced by a dark and often vicious depiction of a future turned bad, revolving around a center-hinterland economic and socio-political reliance based on control and submission.  As with all tales of teenagers thrust into the spotlight of global events, there is a certain linearity to the storyline, but enough twists, turns, and creative situations to keep you turning the pages.  An excellent airplane read, I would give this \\"Three out of Four Terminals\\" for entertainment value.
0307592731|4.0|During her trek of the Pacific Crest Trail, Cheryl Strayed provides an unflinching and unvarnished look at her life.  She acknowledges her faults and her strengths as she hikes 1,100 miles alone through some of the most rugged territory in the United States (and with no previous long-distance hiking experience).  Strayed undertakes the journey in an attempt to discover and reclaim herself after suffering significant losses in her life and after acting out with drugs and sex.  Her odyssey from lost to found is beautiful, terrifying, heartbreaking, and uplifting as she describes her physical journey and her spiritual journey.  The only reason I didn't give the book five stars is that I felt that the denouement was a bit rushed and that more time should have been spent exploring the inner changes that allowed her to find peace and true happiness in life.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|As quoted from a TV Morning Show this is \\"Mills and Boon on steroids\\".<br />A thinly veiled pornographic account of a young woman's obsession with trying to get the object of her desire (Mr. Grey) to \\"feel\\" something other than the comfort of controlling her sexually.<br />The plot is almost non-existant as is the character development, but it is worth a read if you are either curious or inexperineced and can cope with hurtling from one physical encounter to another with the flimsyest of plot excuses.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I really don't have anything good to say about this book.  It is not well written, the characters are poorly developed and the sex is so repetitive....but for some reason I couldn't put this or any of the otter books in this series down.  Everytime there was even a small, interesting plot twist and you thought you might get a small interesting bit of character development, BOOM, the plot twist was over and we were back to the angry sex.  This could have been a good book but instead we are left waiting for the become something that it is not.<br /><br />If any decent authors are out there, please write something interesting and engaging along these lines....hey wait, isn't that the Twilight series?
B005EGXTHG|5.0|Loved this whole series, even though it is aimed at a teenage audience, I really enjoyed it.  Wasn't all hearts & flowers like most books of this genre, kicks twilights ass!
B007MDB71O|4.0|Don't believe all the negative press, which focused more on the movie's budget than on the movie itself. I'm not a Disney shareholder--I don't care what Disney spent on a movie, as long as it's worth my $10 and the babysitter. So despite the lukewarm reception from critics, my wife and I made time to see \\"John Carter\\" during opening week based largely on our affection for all of the talent involved (Stanton, Kitsch, Giacchino, etc.). We weren't disappointed at all, in fact we were pleasantly surprised at how engaging & fun \\"John Carter\\" was. The story is the ever-relatable good vs. evil with a dash of fish-out-of-water; not revolutionary, but done in a way that feels worth the time to revisit. The actors give it their all, and bring more humor to the story than you might have expected from the marketing. The movie looks great too; the combination of live & CG sets & effects are perfectly balanced (it's how I wish the \\"Star Wars\\" prequels would have looked). While it's true that some of the story elements could have been simplified & streamlined, I never felt like the surplus of characters or stories diluted the movie or took me out of the adventure.<br /><br />This ended up being one of the rare recent movies that I have seen twice in theaters (once with my wife, and once with my brother-in-law). Both my wife and my brother-in-law said to me \\"Wow, I can't wait for the sequel!\\" (which, sadly, looks like it won't happen). Disney's decision to remove \\"Mars\\" from the movie's title was a mistake, especially when the trailers & marketing didn't make clear where John Carter was or even the origin of the character itself. (I can't tell you how many people have said to me, \\"It takes place on Mars?\\") Some even mentioned that they would have been more inclined to see it if they had known the movie was based on a beloved sci-fi book series from 100 years ago. In fact, we were at Disneyland during the week when \\"John Carter\\" opened and fully expected to see cross-promotion all over the place...banners, characters, toys. Strangely, the only promotion we saw were two small posters throughout the entire park. By contrast, Disney's \\"The Avengers\\" marketing seems to be in full swing.<br /><br />Whatever our complaints are about why the movie disappointed shareholders & critics, the movie itself is solid, and we'll always be able to revisit it along with some of the other classic one-hit-wonders that gained followings in the years after their theatrical release. We ended up having a really great time with \\"John Carter\\" and we look forward to sharing it with friends/family on DVD/Blu-ray.
B004132HZS|5.0|Amazing I absolutely enjoy this program it's brilliant I'm so glad I purchased it along with the second season and it arrive earlier then foretold.
0307959856|3.0|I think P.D. James is a great writer but I just felt this book was a little off. I though it was somewhat perdictable. But what really bugged me was the characters themselves, I don't think they would have done some of the things they did. All in all I would not recommend it.
B00004SAAX|5.0|These recordings were made in the 1950's through the 1970's. The recording quality is excellent, and of course Walcha's interpretations are amazing. Walcha is one of the supreme interpreters of Bach, and one who has taught other organists. One of his students is George Ritchie, who himself has recorded the complete Bach organ works more recently. Ritchie is also considered one of today's supreme organists playing Bach's works.<br /><br />Years ago, I had some of Walcha's recordings of Bach's organ music on the Archiv label, on LPs of course. Now that this set is available on CD, and not even very expensive, it's a treat to become reacquainted with Bach and Walcha.
0061928356|5.0|Shilpi Somaya Gowda's stunning internationally acclaimed bestseller, set in a remote Indian village, tells the story of parents driven to adopt a baby in a culture that feels that the birth of anything less than a healthy son is a failure. To say more about the story would be to rob any potential reader of the privilege of discovering all the \\"wow\\"s for themselves - superb charcterization and development of unforgettable people that every reader will love or hate, atmospheric descriptive segments that create a detailed mind's eye view of the setting, believable dialogue, powerful emotions and a plot that will keep you turning pages into the wee hours. What are you waiting for?<br /><br />Paul Weiss
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game,, reminds me of the old Mario walks jumps but no running but still fun. have not put since I downloading this game.
0671027344|5.0|I read this book actually last Summer before my freshman year, and I'm so glad I did.<br />This book took me on a journey I had never before encountered. I absolutely loved it. It has no plot.. until you get to the daunting ending. It's a beautiful book and I recommend it to everyone. If you like books such as The Catcher in the Rye or It's Kind of a Funny Story, you're sure to enjoy this one as well, as they are both my favorite books as well.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|awesome game kept me very busy during insomniac nights!!!!! would highly recommend to ppl of all ages and backgrounds.  have fun
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|My wife and I saw this in theaters but decided to rent it because we wanted to watch it again.  This movie will take you throughout the emotional spectrum from laughing to crying.  The acting is great and the dialogue is witty.  I highly recommend it!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I find this to be a wonderful tool to keep me in the Bible daily. I especially like all the choices for a devotional. Greatly appreciated!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|gey this app its soo good I love it :) its my favorite photoshop app :D and it has great editing tools :)
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I was hoping more like old computer game. stupid you have to spend real money to do some stuff. fun for waisting time but not enough so that I am going to invest real money into this! free means free. would love so much if u used your coins for everything and it didn't want your real cash. get rid of real money purchases and I would invite everyone to play and spend much more time playing. probably gonna remove since it requires that for so many of the options
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Well, having just blasted through this fine series of writings, I can certainly say that these books were very entertaining and so thought provoking! It has been hard to lay the iPad down long enough for me to catch a few winks, so that I can make it to work before finding my way back home to start reading the trilogy once again.<br /><br />Thank you for a great read and what a value! Please keep us posted if this series is going to be expanded! Jules rules!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|This concert was amazing!!! The direction of it throughout the different songs Adele performed was excellent!!! I highly recommend this to ANY Adele fan.
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Great product packaging and finish.<br /><br />Basically all the songs you will ever need for yourself and the concert DVD is an added bonus.
B0055SWM08|5.0|One of the best games I've played on Android. The reminder to rate early in the game was a bit annoying.
B0055SWM08|5.0|simple concept and still difficult, controls work well, polished graphics, tons of levels, worth buying even though I caught it free
0345803485|1.0|I could only stand 3 chapters of the absolute worst writing I have ever read.  It's literary hell.  And I'm flabbergasted that our society has eaten this up as they have.  WHAT??
B0071T3Q9K|2.0|I've listened twice in a quiet setting. I'll be specific:<br /><br />Paul's voice lacks the control over timbre and breathe required for this style. I won't pretend to know if it's because of his age or another reason.<br />His limited high range limits some emotion on more delicate passages.<br /><br />Paul's phrasing in several spots reminds me of a guy I know who learned what Sinatra sounded like based on what his parents sang. Too loose much of the time. Even crooning needs a beat to syncopate around and the diction to identify the phrasing.<br /><br />I hope that helps understand my dissatisfaction.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|A lot of fun<br />We enjoy the variety.it gives us each something to play and if you get bored you can change games and still keep your points
B0070YDOT8|1.0|This app is usually good but now after downloading on my new tablet for some reason it'll install, open but wont let you start playing. It says: &quot;Account has been banned in a relation to a chargeback (901237)&quot;. Then their 'Support@selfwaregames.com' is not valid and get my email back. Really hope they'll fix this. Be great to play this app on my tablet.
B003Y5HWJU|5.0|Boardwalk Empire has everything you'd expect in an HBO drama--sharply drawn characters, large-scale stories intercut with intimate moments and a sense that you couldn't find something like it anywhere else on the guide. It's maybe the best new show HBO has launched in several years.
B001DU8T6S|5.0|After nearly 11 years without a song, Queen, utilizing the voice of Paul Rodgers & with two former members Brian May & Roger Taylor come together to remind the world why they are amazing - because they can ROCK out with some AMAZING music! \\"The Cosmos Rocks\\" does NOT disappoint, to the Queen fan with the *Queen ear* it will be loved!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I love this game the characters look just like hey do in the movie if your an ice age fan you will love it to.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|evermore organizes all of my noted using its notebook feature. I can keep all of my notes where I need them and when I need them so I can spend more time on studying rather than finding my notes.
0545265355|1.0|Ordered Hunger Games Box Set on March 30th and it still hasn't been shipped. Just going to cancel the order.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love it. Point blank. I have not had any issues. I love that it is in real time. It is cute and addictive.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love this<br />fun game! good time killer and easy to play. got hooked the first day!<br />good times to be had!
0439023521|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  Have already purchased the next two books in the series by Suzanne Collins. The book was exhilarating!  I am already on the second book, and it is just as exciting!  Love them!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this game is awesome I love it! its super addictive and you can always go back after completing it and try to do better. I wasn't sure about it untill I played it and I'm Impressed. highly recommend it if you like to be challenged
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|An absolutely fabulous trilogy that kept me reading night after night. Suzanne Collins really knows how to captivate an audience; Everyone I've talked to enjoyed it as throughly as I did. Highly recommended!
1891252089|5.0|This book contains beautiful pictures of Asanas and variations. The explanations of each are excellent. Highly recommended for all those who practice Vinyasa flows :)
B0060Q962Q|3.0|Works good for passing time, it's a no brainer. Not much into the games but if you want to pass some time and not think it works great for that.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Worked on my iPad 2 exactly as described. Plugged in my SD card , selected photos and imported. No issues at all.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Easy to use, I find myself keeping a lot of useful info at my fingertips now. Better than depending on a paper note to remember shopping list or tire sizes.
B0061S0A64|4.0|I'm glad I got this on while on the free app of the day, it's really fun! I've created some awesome sounding songs so far. The only problem is the recording feature. Sure you can save the node map, but you can't name your recordings, and you can only have one recording at a time. If this app were to be updated to enhance the recording, I'll change my review to five stars. For now though, because you can't name your recordings, and because you can only have one at a time, I give this app four stars. Totally worth it though.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|awesome game!!! I reccomend it! great for all ages. easy to play! glad when it became free! it's fun and entertaining!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|amazing very easy but fun. all the characters and fun for kids to. if you just feel blown away and mad and you wantva brake this is the game to play
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I read a wide range of books, murder mystery, thrillers, romances, sci-fi, vampiresque, historical, biographys, etc.  I dont' think I'm very close minded about books.  I bought this book for my Kindle even though the sample didn't grab me because of all the great reviews on it (as well as a friends recomendation).  I found it hard to like any of the characters and was hopful I would grow to like them.  It didn't happen, I tried to force myself to read the entire book and wound up skipping around the last half of the book.  The main character to me was very unlikable and Mr. Grey was only slighly more likeable because he at least had a bit of a backbone.  And this had nothing to do with the sex - I did not feel any connection to the charcaters.  I wasted my $9.99 and I have learned my lesson - if I don't like the sample, it's not going to get any better further into the book and I should have not bought it and wasted my time and money.  That being said, I know there are a lot of people out there that love this book, it just wasn't for me
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Love being able to read my books on the go! Without a the app I would not be able to take my books with me. Thanks for the free Kindle apps!!
B006JSXYPA|5.0|Im a huge fan of Transformers since I can recall, I even have to tattoos.  And the movie in 3D is awesome, I just bought a LG 47LW6500 and a 3D BD player...what else can I say
B007J4T2G8|5.0|By far, the BEST trilogy ever written!  I was disappointed when I finished because now I can't find anything even remotely as good to start reading now.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Best stylus I've used. Recommended it to all of my design and iPad using friends! The size, material, and weight make all the difference. Try it out with the \\"Paper\\" App by 53 or Draw Something!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This app, The Oregon Trail: American Setttlers (Kindle Fire Edition) is a great app...<br /><br />You might wonder why its got a 4.0 rating.<br /><br />This is an educational app that you have fun with instead of going through books for hours.
B007JUWM64|2.0|I seriously hate it when movie writer's, producer' and director's dumb down classic literature or history to \\"grab\\" today's younger audiences. This is a prime example! Very little has to do with the actual book. It's not even true to the character's of the book. The Indiana Jones-ish booby traps are ridiculous, that not even a great inventor the caliber of Leonardo DaVinci could have thought up during the period of which the Three Musketeers takes place. Especially since DaVinci himself would never have thought of a need for such a vault. They never go to Italy, they never get kicked out of the Musketeers, (nor has the muketeers been disbanded as in other film adaptations). Constance isn't the Queens Lady-In-waiting either, and she's married. That aside, the entire concept of the movie is crap.<br /><br />Did they write the story first and hire Milla Jovovich second or the other way around. Milady is cunning, but not the limber acrobatic, mission impossible drop from the roof, Resident Evil kick butt villain portrayed here. Orlando Bloom is utterly wasted and looks ridiculous. His hair is an 80's flashback nightmare! I do enjoy Logan Lerman; however he is wrongly cast as D'artagnan. In the novel, his character is almost 20, so his casting was spot on for the age. I had trouble believing him as D'artagnan. He is still young and a relative newcomer; I do not believe that he held his own against much more seasoned actors. I do look forward to watching him grow as an individual and an actor.<br /><br />The flashy style used to capture the kids is out of place. The weapons used by Athos in the beginning you would expect to see in an over-the-top, unrealistic martial arts film. Buckingham's war \\"ballons\\" is more Avatar, The Last Airbender than 17th century Europe.<br /><br />The only reason I gave it to stars rather than one is because at the very least my kids should enjoy it (hopefully), so my money won't be completely wasted. well, they'll enjoy it until they're mature enough to read the real story (not the kid friendly versions).enough to read the real story (not the kid friendly versions).
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There's nothing better than Gods word. It is food for the soul. Plus you tell me what book was written so long ago and still applies to everyday life and speaks directly to you and is current like the Bible? Ill tell you which, none but the Bible.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was the favorite of the series for me. But I know this may not be your cup of tea.<br />A lot of my friends seem to make fun of me liking stories where everyone dies in the end (which is only half true), but what I really love about the Mockingjay is how it is like an old classic tragedy. This is a story about how children was on a show to kill each other, how can that have a fairy tale ending? I would have loved to know more about the epilogue, like what happened to some of the other characters, but then it wont be right, because this whole book is about Katiness' experience, not about other characters. Perhaps the upcoming movie will answer those questions.<br /><br />My favorite scene in this book was with buttercup in the end. I truly love to read books that makes me emotional like that.
B0055SWM08|5.0|reminds me of Braid! i played it for thirty minutes without realizing it. worth twice what you'll pay for it
B0055SWM08|4.0|Pretty decent for the most part. Some levels are pretty much impossible to solve. Most levels require some thought but aren't too hard.
B002ZG974M|5.0|Every one that loves children<br />should see this video. It will also<br />make you see, we really are all the same.<br />From birth there is little diferrence in<br />us and we truly do all come from one common<br />ancestry. Very fun to watch!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have this app on my phone and my kindle fire.  My daughter loaded it and so my parents. I especially like having the devotionals in the same app. Use it every morning.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I simply loved everything about this book. I went into it not knowing that it was an \\"erotic fiction\\"  but don't let that title scare you away from it. It's a very intense love story that keeps you reading into the early morning hours! I finished the whole series in about a week and a half and am hoping she does a fourth!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I enjoyed the game. I have found the way to exit the game is to open the settings, the bottom bar becomes  accessable. You can then go back to the home screen.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I love the story, but they end up in bed several times a day........I find myself scrolling through those sections since they're all the same.
B003F3NE1Q|2.0|ive ordered quite a few seasons of greys now and they always come in great condition but when this one showed up the box that holds the discs was damaged. i thought nothing of it and watched the first four discs. when i put the fifth disc in it would not play. i look at the disc and theres four deep scratches on it. my discs stay in the container so it wasnt me who scratched it meaning it came like that. i now have to order another set of season six just to watch four episodes because they screwed me. definitely wont take the chance of that again. im going to walmart.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|too hard for the kids and you must replay levels many times to progress but good variety of games.  I have not gotten board yet though
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|reminds me a lot of the old game harvest moon. if anyone enjoyed that they are sure to enjoy this as well. oregon trail is false advertising.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is the first book I have read by William Landay. I was not disappointed. A wonderfully written murder mystery with court room drama like John Grisham used to regularly deliver. An ending I would have never seen coming. Read it!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have always enjoyed spider.  good way to pass the afternoon if you are trapped inside.<br />keeps the cobwebs swept away.
0345803485|5.0|Just finished the trilogy this morning.  Clearly this is never going to win a Pulitzer but I enjoyed the relationship that develops as Christian reveals himself. He is a multi-layered man with such a tragic past, and how that plays out as an adult is fascinating to me. Plus, lets face it, Christian and Ana are hot together.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  While it's targeted to young adults, not-so-young adults will enjoy it, too.  It's a fast read.
1401937519|1.0|I have read many books on the topics of religion and NDEs and their interface with science.  This book could have been written in 20 pages, but through constant repetition was lengthened to book-length.  The thoughts are mostly new-age babble: I am god, god is me, I am you, and you are me...googoobajoob - I am the walrus. If Anita mentioned our magnificance one more time, I think I was going to scream.  This type of book seems to be preying on those people who are seriously ill to give them hope that they can heal themselves.  Overall a boring monotonous book. Don't waste your time or money.
B000001EXB|5.0|I passed this album by when it first came out and I don't really know why; maybe it was the mediocre cover art. But I've been such a huge Elton fan for 40 years and own at least one copy of almost everything he has ever released, so I finally bought The Big Picture as a Christmas present to myself. Wow, I can't believe how much I love this album! Elton's vocals are rich and heartfelt, the melodies demonstrate how much he has matured as a writer, and speaking of writing . . . I think these may be some of the best Taupin lyrics EVER. They are certainly my favorites, and that is saying something! Nearly five months later and I still can't stop listening to it. Elton fans, even casual Elton fans, don't pass this album up because of the funky picture or just because you can't sample the music. Trust me . . . it is a GREAT album!!
B004LWZW88|5.0|Got the movies for a 4 year old son.  Whole family loved it and thought is was funny...what's not funny is that I've seen it over 12 times now thanks to the 4 year old :)  definitely worth buying vs. renting..
1741798981|5.0|I spend a lot of time in London so I've compared this to other guides and really like.  The maps and tips are spot on.  Hard to go wrong with this top-notch guide.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is a lot of fun.  all of the old Oregon trail insanity but in a farmville type game.
B0054VVRBQ|3.0|Purchased this to use in a MacBook Pro that has an Express Card slot (Pre-Unibody) running OSX Lion.<br />The product works as advertised. It fits flush inside the laptop and SD cards can be inserted and removed without removing this card. It is faster than USB 2.0; so it does everything I want it to do.<br />The caveat is that it requires a driver; which installs some kernel extensions.<br />The driver needs to be downloaded from the Transcend site; which is more or less straightforward; but the link provided in the packaging was not working.<br />The driver itself is the generic driver provided by the chipset designer which is a Taiwanese company: JMicron. After installing the driver provided by Transcend; verified that it is the same version number as provided by JMicron.<br />During the installation; OS X complains twice that it failed to activate the newly installed kernel extensions; and it requires a reboot.<br />After the reboot; the PCI Express card works and the SD card is mounted normally. However; the device icon is a very low resolution; and it does not follow the OS X icon styling; that because is mounted on the desktop might find it distracting. The drivers provide no documentation and I would much prefer it to use the OS X default icons.<br />All in all; it works and the driver seems OK, but I was surprised that it requires a driver and the volume icon provided by the driver is rather distracting.<br />On the plus side; it provides an uninstall tool; which I did not try. By the way the icon on the uninstall tool is of an SD card that I personally find far more pleasant than the one included on the driver itself.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love this game!!!!! I down loaded it for my kindle and its great to pass time. great options for game play.
B005L38QK2|5.0|Best mouse I've ever had the pleasure of owning, I was and still am a Logitech fan, but this mouse is comfortable and it pulsates!!! ( guaranteed over 1,000,000 clicks ) :)
B0075PYG1M|5.0|This album is worth listening to ALL DAY LONG!it is like making love to my ears or massaging my brain!  This is what music truly is meant to be!  So thankful I bought this CD.I recommend this for anyone who loves jazz!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|this game is full of bugs.  frustrating and addicting.  got my kids to play and i don't have the nerve to delete it now since they have accumulated so much.<br /><br />It does not recognize your facebook friends nor your internet connection.  i can send gifts and see my friends but they can't see me.  I only see them sporadically as well.<br /><br />plus it keeps wanting to update and kicks you out and shuts down without notice.<br /><br />these problems are the same on fire and ipad.<br /><br />Another zinga beta product.
B007JWKLMO|4.0|Amazing stuff, he was the outside Beatle, John and Paul pushed him to the margins, much like Mick and Keith pushed Brian Jones out of the Rolling Stones.<br />The best guitar player of the trio, he was also the most introspective.  Many of his songs are commonly thought to be John's or Paul's.<br />I would have like to see him after the Beatles, his solo career brought so much great music and really showed him outside the \\"bubble\\" of fame and fandom.<br />Very insightful as to the early years and worth a second look just for that, though.
B000OIBY4Y|4.0|This was a novel I purchased for my English class.<br />We were instructed to choose one of nine different perspectives to read from, I was assigned sadness.<br />This novel encompasses many more different aspects, but from the view I had taken, this proved to be a great novel with the contemporary spin on religion and how the human conscience adapts to prevail over everyday struggle. I greatly enjoyed reading it, about a two hour straight through session of reading! Very worthwhile.
0307891372|5.0|Great guide it helped me get through  alot of quest in the game that i couldnt beat.alot of info in this book for any hardcore skyrium player...i recommend before you buy the game get this guide with it cause with the open world gameplay you dont wanna feel lost that way you can get the most outta the game..!!!!!!

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is the best. I love the funny little bird and it keeps u entertained for hours. I almost passed all the game by mere luck but I loved it. I totally recommend it to every one at every age.  And its for free in my kindle fire
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have enjoyed this game a lot and it is easy to tell others they will too. Go get it!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is similar to super Mario. I like this game a lot the only thing that bothers me is that with the kindle fire its sometimes hard to move the little guy. After a while the game repeats itself but its fuunnn.. and its also free
B005SS2QXS|5.0|This case is great for me. It's solid and rubbery, covers the home button and the top, and won't easily come off. Extra rubber on the corners where it counts, and nicely shaped in the back and sides. Lots of room to plug in, and not in the way of the camera and flash. Just buy a screen protector and you're in business. I like it a lot better than the heavy bulky cases.
0307595579|4.0|I did'nt buy these books off amazon, I bought them off ebay for $40.00. I really enjoy the books but the only thing I noticed was 100 pages into the 1st book I noticed that the red paint on all the dragons is coming off just from everyday reading around the house.... I love how they wraped the all the books in cloth I just wish the paint was staying on...
B001BEX50G|5.0|Here we have JAZZ SAMBA, recorded 50 years ago, on February 13, 1962, in just a few miraculous hours! You can hear the off-the-cuff quality of the playing; very endearing.  And now it has been remastered beautifully; which it richly deserves.<br /><br />Bossa Nova and Joao Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim were still in the wings.  \\"Getz/Gilberto\\" was not recorded until 1963 and not released until the summer of '64.<br /><br />So until that happened, we had this wonderful recording.  I can still remember arriving in Palo Alto, in the afternoon, at the conclusion of a long motorcycle trip from L.A. that lasted forever because of the night, fog and cold.  But when I put on this new recording in the living room of my High School friend's house and fell asleep on the grass outside, I thought -- you know -- that I had died and gone to heaven.<br /><br />I was already familiar with Joao and Jobim from Joao Gilberto's first recording to be released in the U.S, in 1961, \\"The Wonderful World of Joao Gilberto.\\"  It immediately \\"tanked.\\"  (\\"Is he singing in Spanish?\\")<br /><br />But Getz's version of \\"Desafinado\\" from this record, won a grammy and lives on.  The recording itself was on the \\"charts\\" for 70 weeks!<br /><br />I almost forgot to give credit to Charlie Byrd, the guitarist.  It was his idea to make this recording.  He had been to Brazil on a good will tour and discovered Joao Gilberto's recordings and brought back several to the States.  He had Stan listen to one or more and Stan was sold.  Stan then got Creed Taylor at Verve to green light the project.<br /><br />And now 50 years later JAZZ SAMBA still lives. Both Getz and Byrd have gone on to their well-earned rewards, but this affectingly beautiful and daring recording is the reward they gave us to cherish and enjoy for more than the next 50 years!

B006OB3K56|4.0|This purchase was a no-brainer for me, since I've been fascinated (or FASS-inated??  Sorry...) since seeing Michael Fassbender in Inglourious Basterds.  In Shame, he plays Brandon, a sex addict - prostitutes, women (and one man) he picks up in bars, online sex, masturbation at work - it doesn't matter.  And it's clear that Brandon gets no relief or enjoyment from the sexual acts.  We don't know what drives him to these behaviors, but when his sister, Sissy, (played by Carey Mulligan) shows up uninvited and unwelcome, the tension between the two, Sissy's lack of boundaries with her brother, and Brandon's hostile reactions to her hint at something possibly very traumatic in their pasts.  Sissy continually reaches out to her brother, as he becomes increasingly angry with her neediness and dependency.  An argument with Sissy sends him off to find relief one evening in the one way he knows how: with a series of degrading and potentially dangerous sexual acts.  The night culminates in a threesome.  While some might think any threesome must be good, this one would change your mind.  The scene depicted here was not sexy at all and Brandon's pain (Fassbender WENT for it here) was heart-breaking to watch.<br /><br />Fassbender received some international awards for this role, as well as a Golden Globe nomination.  His performance is extraordinary, as is Mulligan's.  He makes you feel the hopelessness and emptiness of Brandon.  I can't say I liked him, but I did feel sympathy for him.  And let's not forget George Clooney's salute to Fassbender's golf club-size...appendage.<br /><br />If you like Michael in Shame, I'd like to recommend two earlier movies of his: [[ASIN:B004CIIXFA Fish Tank (The Criterion Collection) [Blu-ray]]] and [[ASIN:B001G9CNI6 Eden Lake]].  Three very different films with three very different characters.  Fassbender was amazing in Fish Tank, and Eden Lake is a smart horror flick.

B000SEI230|5.0|I finished this book this afternoon and I can honestly say that I was moved to tears multiple times amid the laughs also. The tender manner that this book was written just grabbed me and did not let me go. It took me back to high school and made me wonder how an experience like this might have moved me and in what direction. The characters were alive on ever page and coaxing emotions at a pace and level that left me spent once this story was told. I can only imagine the pain exhibited by Landon and Jamie and his growth experience was heart felt on a personal level that I have not reached in many years.<br />Even several hours later I am still emotionally spent but this journey of heart and soul preached to me at every turn about a God of mercy and grace that fulfills us even in our darkest hours.<br />Nicholas Sparks is an author of soulful experiences that pierces even the hardest heart and brought me to my emotional knees as I experienced this journey. I will read this again but I may never reach the emotional zenith that I reached today but I cannot say that with any certainty. This is a must read.
0345803485|4.0|Ok, I get it why some of the reviewers hated the writing, it's silly....BUT....a quick read and definitely a book that you can have a group discussion about.  It contains the necessary components that your typical reader enjoys these days.  Scandal, power (on so many levels), mystery and of course lusty sex.
1118156315|5.0|Business Model You has great insights and tools as to how to create a business plan for yourself.  I'm finding that many High School students are disenfranchised with the educational system; going to college, accumulating debt without much prospect of a well-paying job at end of it, is looking less and less attractive!  I'm working on a personalized student learning model for students driven through interests and passions that can be linked to career explorations plus opportunities for creativity and innovation leading to... as the BMY exalts....an enterprise that can earn a livelihood!  We need to create stepping stone experiences so young people can transition into being successful financially stable adults, have hope for their future and act for the greater good of the planet!  This book is a great easy step-by-step to create a \\"canvas\\" for a new livelihood.... I'm looking forward to using it with students...
030788743X|5.0|An excellent read! I'd suggest it to any geeks! This is one of those books you won't want to put down until you reach the ending. An all around fun time.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I've just finished all 3 books. The first 2 books were great. I like the 1st one most, the Hunger Games. Katniss character in the first book was so great, smart, lovely and so capable of doing things. However, she was gradually developed into a selfish, pathetic person in the last book. She was just a trouble maker after all.<br /><br />Peeta character was so weak, so incapable of doing anything except baking. Yeah, he was nice, kind and thoughtful but so what; he got hurt every single turn and got protected by a girl all the time. What type of man was that?<br /><br />I like Gale character; he was some kind of Mr. Right for most of girls. He did not do anything wrong throughout the story except the part that Katniss assumed he was responsible for the bombing. He was faded out so badly at the end of the book for no sensible reasons.<br /><br />The ending was horrible except the part that Kaniss killed Coin. All characters were torn apart. I did not like the ending at all. Katniss chose Peeta over Gale.
B00112ASYO|5.0|I accidentally ordered 2 of these and it has worked out perfectly because both my son and daughter (ages 2.5 yrs and 1 yr) are crazy about them. If my son isn't holding both, then my daughter is looking for them. They are lifelike, durable, and fun for the imagination. The mouth is open with teeth to pretend they can 'bite' but really the teeth are just dull, so can't to real damage to furniture or fingers. We love our two.

B005MMJ84K|5.0|I just finished a marathon of reading Delirium and Pandemonium over the course of a couple days. These books both kept me up at night reading and wondering what was going to happen. I liked Pandemonium slightly better than Delirium just because Lena became such a stronger person in this book. Someone who was unafraid to fight for what and who she loves, and someone not afraid to love. The ending of this book...wow. What a cliff hanger. I haven't been so riveted by a book in a long time and my jaw literally dropped open when I read the last word. I'm so bummed the 3rd book won't be out for nearly a year, but I'll be anxiously waiting for it.<br /><br />Definitely check Delirium and Pandemonium out, and read \\"Before I Fall\\" too. That was also a really good one.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I thought this book was a thoroughly enjoyable and offered a fairly deep dive into the life and thought processes of Jobs.  It balances his professional accomplishments and his personal life well - as seemingly even all of his personal life events tied into his professional development somehow.  I enjoyed seeing how literally obsessed with his projects he would become, and how that reach for perfectionism often times helped and sometimes hurt his outcomes.  There's a lot of lessons to be derived from this book as well, in business mostly but also some personal lessons.  Well worth the time.
1416583408|5.0|If you have a dog, if you're a dog person or an all around animal person - you have to read Inside of a Dog: What Dogs See, Smell, and Know by Alexandra Horowitz.<br /><br />\\"Go look at a dog. Go on, look---maybe at one lying near you right now, curled around his folded legs on a dog bed, or sprawled on his side on the tile floor, paws flitting through the pasture of a dream. Take a good look---and now forget everything you know about this or any dog.<br /><br />\\"This is admittedly a ridiculous exhortation...What we'll find, in looking at dogs through a scientific lens, is that some of what we think we know abut dogs is entirely borne out; other things that appear patently true are, on closer examination, more doubtful than we thought. And by looking at our dogs from another perspective --- from the perspective of the dog---we can see new things that naturally occur to those of us encumbered with human brains. So the best way to begin understanding dogs is by forgetting what we think we know.\\"<br /><br />True to her word, Horowitz pretty much decimated everything I thought I knew about dogs, many of which are commonly-held, accepted beliefs. Misunderstandings about man's best friend stem, Horowitz explains, from humans anthropomorphizing dogs [\\"We see, talk about, and imagine dogs' behavior from a human-biased perspective, imposing our own emotions and thoughts on these furred creatures\\"]. For example, dogs don't urinate to mark their territory - they actually urinate to provide information/messages to other dogs. Horowitz compares a fire hydrant as a common bulletin board for the neighborhood.<br /><br />Horowitz breaks down these and other \\"myths\\" in organized fashion, systematically concentrating chapter by chapter on a different cognitive experience: how dogs see, smell, hear, and think. Interspered with the clear scientific passages are personal observations and anecdotes of Horowitz's own dog, Pumpernickel or \\"Pump,\\" which infuse the book with an intimate feel. You can tell this scientist loves dogs :)<br /><br />I think Inside of a Dog was so mindblowing for me because dogs seem so known and not at all mysterious, when in fact, they are surprising creatures worthy of in depth study. The mind of a dog is a fascinating perspective to explore.

B007UYZDZ6|5.0|Casting Adam Baldwin as Ethan Slaughter was inspired,not to mention reuniting Nathan Fillion with Baldwin(Firefly). These two actors play off of each other in a way that is seldom seen on the big or small screen.Adam Balwin is an underrated actor who deserves his own show.At the very least the Slaughter character should be brought back in a recurring role.So it was a hoot to watch these two do their interaction again!The only thing missing was an inside joke.Like them looking at each other,upon meeting,in a familiar manner,saying;'Don't I know you?'All in all,Headhunters was one of the best episodes yet.And that is saying something!

0307593312|5.0|1Q84 was originally released overseas as a three book set(books 2 and 3 sold in one volume)and became an international sensation. It was released here in the states as one book encompassing all three. It is a monster of a book whose characterization and steady pacing drive the story and reader along. You will devour this book as it devours you.<br />It begins simply enough with a traffic jam in Tokyo, the year 1984, a quiet young business woman by the name of Aomame (like the green peas she says)is stranded and running late for an appointment. The Taxi driver offers her a solution, on the overpass, off to the side is a walkway used by technicians and city workers, if she gets out and climbs down she can get to the street and take the city transit. This simple act, sets the whole tale in motion. Aomame in climbing down the stairwell enters a new and different world, a paralell to the the Tokyo she thinks she knows and into the Tokyo of 1Q84.<br />Elsewhere, a young teacher and frustrated writer named Tengo gets an offer from his editor to re-write a teenage girls first novel and improve it so it could win a contest and sell for the publisher. This act sets in motion the novel Air Chrysalis and like carefully plotted dominoes, all the rest falls into place.<br />There is religious persecution, religious cults, sexual abuse and sexual freedom, a desire for revenge and tremendous sorrow. Crimes are committed and punished. There are triumphs and there is intense defeat and no one really gets away from 1Q84.<br />But at the center of it all is the one thing missing throughout this tale. There is no love. The one emotion in 1Q84 that none of the characters seem to have and it is the absense of this emotion that drives this tale on. For in a moment, when they were children, Tengo and Aomame touched briefly and each felt that foriegn unknown sensation called pure love. They would spend their lives and this incredible story looking for the way to get that moment back as adults.<br />In the end this tale is about Tengo and Aomame and no matter how sad or damaged they may seem you will always want them to get free of 1Q84 and find that moment of their love for one another again.
B0012HCASA|1.0|The only value to gain from watching this series is that the writing is so bad, you wish Sky-Net would take over the world sooner.<br /><br />I never make a negative comment on a brand new concept because at least it is an experiment in entertainment, but, the Terminator formula is not new, it is a very basic plot about a relentless killing machine which travels through time to kill a human. The fact that the machine has no feelings, looks scary and it is unstopable makes the first Terminator a succesful story, and even though one would think that replicating the same formula would be easy as pie, yet, sequel after sequel, year after year, new untalented writers and producers manage to pitch their idiotic ideas and alter the original plot to the detriment of Terminator fans. This TV series is a perfect example of how you can take a good concept (The original Terminator) and turn it into garbish.<br /><br />I don't really blame the actors, I can see how they are trying their earnest while the director and the writers are pissing the Terminator franchise away, not hard to do after Terminator 3. In any case, starting an episode with a cheesy dream sequence is stuff I have not seen since my first year in film school. No imagination.<br /><br />Months ago, when I saw this pilot at Comic-Con and it was awful. After a second viewing on TV, it realized it was worse than I thought.<br /><br />Watching the free pilot on Amazon was great because it allows you to fast-forward over all the bad parts, that is 90% of the show just to see Summer Glau, the only reason why anyone would want to see this mess is her. Poor Summer Glau does not look at all like a Terminator, the laws of physics go out the window when she fights heavier meaner robots, because of her natural sweetness she is clearly a misguided casting choice, the role of a mean killing machine may end up killing her career. She does not handle it as well as she did on Serenity and I truly hope she makes a difficult professional choice and quits this series before it is too late and get a job doing something more suitable for her.<br /><br />There is so much that is wrong with the execution of the Chronicles, for starters the \\"concept\\" is completely misguided, a series about Sarah Connor and her son, no exactly an interesting pair. The fact is nobody cares about this pair of dysfunctional misfits getting shot at every five minutes (unless you are a misfit who gets shot at all the time). When they aren't docking bullets, there is lots of repetitive filler chit-chat between them, it is a soap opera, just not a very good one as it could have been.<br /><br />Of course, if you came here to buy something that you can get for free on your TV, then your definition of ridiculous could be different from mine, and you may love this show. For the other half of the population, I would say stay away and do not support bad television.<br /><br />There is only one reason to watch this show, and it is of course Summer Glau, who is still yummy eye candy even while surrounded by the absolute mediocrity created by the writers. To what she would probably say: \\"Take a picture it will last you longer.\\"<br /><br />I just watched the last episode \\"The Devil's Hand\\" for free on TV just to see if there were any improvements or merciful evolution in quality, and it was just as bad if not worse. On this one they have Summer learning ballet! I am sorry but if Arnold had danced ballet on the original movie...no one would have come to see the movie and there would not be a series.<br /><br />Of course, the series has been inexplicably renewed despite the bad reviews, not surprisingly since it was renewed by the same people that made the mistake of making it in the first place. (Fox is notorious for dragging a dead horse until there is nothing left to squeeze out of it) Don't think that because Fox hasn't canceled the show that means it has good rating, all it means is that it is cheap to produce and the actor arebeen payed miserably. \\"Galactica\\" is a perfect example of a show that no one saw when it was on cable and now they are trying to shove down your throat.<br /><br />Remember, if you don't buy this episodes then you are forcing them to write better shows in the future...no pun intended.been payed miserably. \\"Galactica\\" is a perfect example of a show that no one saw when it was on cable and now they are trying to shove down your throat.<br /><br />Remember, if you don't buy this episodes then you are forcing them to write better shows in the future...no pun intended.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I just finished reading this book, if it wasn't easy to read, I guess I might not even finish this book.  First is that I think it put too much word to describe how ridicules the Capitol is, which on the countary, didn't help at all.  Because I can't see anything that describes the Capitol from the side, which made me feel this book is combined with two separate stories instead of one continued.  Just like a person tells you that his teacher is terrible, but you aren't in his class so there is no way you will confirm this.  Also the game part is too unreal, I was expecting to see how the person's inner thought changes  due to the pressure of the game, but just as I mentioned, it looks like a woman tried to wear makeup to show others that she is pretty.  Also when I was reading this book, \\"Battle Royale\\" keep coming up to my mind, which I think is more simple and straight forward, because I can get a picture of how weird the government is without the author telling me \\"The government is weird\\".
B000DWMYQ8|5.0|The characters are kewl, the story is neat, and the music is awesome.  Of all the \\"modern\\" kid's movies (where modern = came out since my childhood), this is my absolute favorite.  The DVD has a lot of kewl special features also.

0385342063|5.0|This review was written by my daughter.<br /><br />When it comes to writing what I love to read, Sophie Kinsella has definitely \\"Got my number\\"!<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella has done it again... I've got your number is the story of life and love in the digital age, showing how modern day romances and relationships can blossom via text even BEFORE you meet the person! It is the story of Poppy Wyatt who accidentally loses her family heirloom engagement ring and then has her cell phone stolen at her own bridal shower!  Frantic to find her ring, Poppy happens to find a cell phone someone threw in the trash and decides to use it as her own. Little does she know that cell phone and the events to follow would change her life forever!<br /><br />In true Kinsella-style, you are immediately engrossed in the story and get inside Poppy's head from page 1...which is a funny and exciting place to be through all of the twists and turns throughout the book.  Just when you start to think \\"oh this is predictable\\" the story takes a turn you definitely wouldn't expect.  Through Kinsella's creative writing, and comical use of footnotes, you will definitely relate to Poppy and feel you are along on the journey with her.<br /><br />Check it out...you will not be disappointed!

B004GXA5U2|5.0|I couldn't put this book down - waiting to see what would happen and how she would emerge from all the conflicting and troubling aspects of her very full life.  Demanding career, 2 young children, annoying child-carer, incompetent cleaner, stoic husband, horrid assistant at the office, friends needing your time and advice, even a potential long-distance lover.<br /><br />Having been through so many of her crises, I could identify with all her conflicted time pressures.  How can a career woman be expected to bake a cake for her daughter's school during the night before!<br /><br />I urge you to read this book if you have ever had to juggle life's requirements and try to multi-task on so many levels.  However, it is definitely a woman's book.  Perhaps only we can understand this troubling sleep-depriving problem of so very many important things to juggle and to decide our life's priority.<br /><br />With all of this, it remains a very funny book.

0312330529|3.0|Thankfully, I returned to the Amazon reviews having arrived at \\"Part Four\\", and having found myself wanting permission to abandon this fascinating-turned-lackluster novel! (Thank you, other 3-star reviewers!) I HATE not finishing books, and I hate not giving authors the benefit of the doubt that something great is just around the corner...<br />The roughly first half is absolutely worth picking up the book to read - for the scenes of Australian newcomer to Bombay, Indian slum life and imprisonment.  Sadly, the characters become less and less compelling as time goes on.  Interspersed throughout are \\"philosophical\\" dialogues and soliloquies that reeked of sophomoric ramblings as you might find from a collection of intensely self-absorbed university students sitting around a pub - (or maybe I'm just too old for that?); I had no background information on the author, and assumed he must be a fairly young adult who had not yet learned how to \\"demonstrate, rather than pontificate\\" a point of view - but it all made sense when I read of his drug-addicted, ex-con background; a certain amount of perseverative, waxing-on about the meaning of this and that fits that context.<br />To be a very good novel, this book requires chopping off at least 1/4 the length, substantial editing, and a few lessons from writers such as Rohinton Mistry or Khaled Hosseini, who know how to sustain and build characters and a story that feed the desired philosophical impact without forcing it into your system via a feeding tube!<br />Nevertheless, the book deserves 3 stars for the wonderful imagery, sounds and smells of India - the primary reason I embarked on reading it!  I would have preferred to borrow it rather than pay for the Kindle download, but would encourage anyone to read at least the first half - and please feel free to NOT FINISH it! You will still get your time's worth with just half.

B0059XTUVI|3.0|If you check the reviews of The Iron Lady, they are decidedly mixed and leaning toward lackluster at best. Critics and amateur reviewers alike seem to agree that the execution of the material is decidedly lukewarm. The comments of the major critics such as Roger Ebert and A O Scott of the New York Times seem to agree quite well with amateur reviewers on Amazon where the reviews are almost evenly split between ratings of one through five.<br /><br />The film depicts Ms Thatcher's life and career from the time before her marriage through the middle of the last decade after her husband's death and after she had developed what appears to be Alzheimer's disease.  Much of the film depicts imaginary moments and conversations with her late husband. She is attempting to discard his clothing and genuinely seems to want to let him go at times; but at times he is still living to her even though she is reminded constantly by her daughter that he is not.<br /><br />The story is told through a series of flashbacks. Since the film chronicles such a long period of time, the viewer is often left wishing he or she had learned more about many of the pivotal events of Ms Thatcher's life and career ... things that may have better explained her extreme and often controversial conservatism. Nevertheless, I personally feel that the film does indeed illuminate much of what I personally did not know about Ms Thatcher.<br /><br />The bright spot of the film is, of course, the performance by Meryl Streep . She delivers another stellar portrayal of a character not at all like herself. As in most of Ms Streep's films, you stop seeing Ms Streep early on and see the character that she is playing. This is particularly true of this film since as an older Margaret, Ms Streep looks nothing like herself. What a grand actress she is! For me she is the epitome.<br /><br />As I post my review on Amazon, I will give this film a rating of three stars; but that is only because it's the middle point of the rating scale. Ms Streep's performance deserves at least a five; but parts of the film deserve a one. A three is the best I can do.
1594744769|5.0|Loved it!! A wonderful spin on a book, including the old photographs. As a photographer, and vintage photography collector, I really loved the photos that were included, and the story was brilliant. Really looking forward to the sequel! There was a great progression in the story, from being cautious about these \\"peculiar children\\" to completely trusting them and having your heart won over by them. Can't wait to see where this series goes. Brilliant first novel!
B005KR6OBM|1.0|I received these dvds for Easter and i was very happy. then i noticed that there was something wrong. lets start with how the disks and cases looked. the disks looked faded and were scratched even though they were said to be new. then i almost broke some of the disks trying to pull them out of the case. the cases look like ones you can buy online which i am sure this person did. then the dvds themselves had issues. as i watched the seasons i noticed many glitches or skips in the audio, then the picture froze while the audio continued to play or the picture would scramble and then the audio skips. this ruined the episodes because the audio no longer matched the picture. i watched these disks on other dvd players and had the same problem so it was not the dvd players fault. i had this same problem on almost all of the disks and have to get replacement seasons. i spent about 55-65 dollars on this and now have to buy 3 replacement seasons. just buy the seasons individually and don't waste your time with this deal.
0143119680|4.0|The trilogy is very promising and I am eagerly waiting for the next book, which is due out soon. As for Discovery, I started out a little torn. It was just a tad bit slow in the beginning, with some of the character building, and the redundancy of the visits to The Bodleian, but then quickly progressed into a vampire/witch love story, a wee bit reminiscent of Twilight. That was about the time my husband started reading reviews about it and was snorting at me because all of the male reviews were not good, stating it was a romance novel, and too much like Twilight. Give it a chance gentlemen, give it a chance. The romance part was necessary to establish the bond between Diana and Matthew, and that they have been destined to find each other. After they leave Sept-Tours and head to NY, the book finally gets to the meat, and the true purpose of what this trilogy is offering comes to light. True the book is about Diana and matthew, but there is also a higher purpose - the future of all 4 races. Witch, Daemon, Vampire and Human. I am glad that Nathaniel and Sophie were introduced in the latter part of the book, as well as all of the characters coming together as they did in NY. Now to see what becomes...One last aspect that I really enjoy is the history and science parts of the book. I think it is really fascinating how much history the author wound into the book. I really love European history and this book has a lot of it!Well done, looking forward to book 2!
B0072GPQ72|4.0|There's no question in my mind I have to see a movie whenever I notice it's directed by Steven Spielberg. It doesn't matter if it's an action/adventure, historical drama, or sci-fi film; his very name on the project means that even if it revolves around a horse, it will be a quality movie worth my time.<br /><br />I wouldn't usually give a film about a horse the time of day. I wouldn't even consider watching it. Spielberg made me step out of my box and witness something different and captivating. I'm not going to tell you \\"War Horse\\" is the greatest film I've ever seen, but it is a spectacle to behold; the cinematography is nothing short of mesmerizing.<br /><br />Fans of Steven Spielberg's movies will want to get \\"War Horse\\" right away. There are plenty of special features to keep consumers happy on the Blu-ray set, and the film will stand up to more than one viewing.<br /><br />The movie will no doubt earn its place right next to \\"Schindler's List,\\" \\"Amistad,\\" \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" and Spielberg's other period pieces. Is it his best film? No, it isn't. But it is definitely a movie worth seeing and one you will want to own for further viewings at home.
0440244412|5.0|Loved this one the best out of the series. I was a little disappointed in the first two books, but then the next two were better and this one was fantastic! The author ends almost every chapter with a great cliffhanger that wants you to turn the page and keep going. I really loved this world and hopes she writes more about these characters. Even though she had a lot going on with many different characters in this book, I think she tied almost all the loose ends up at the end. Also, just when I thought I would have something figured out, she would go and throw in somethig totally unexpected. Really superb story! There were a few tidbits that I was left wondering about, and I have heard she will be writing more in this world. Can't wait!
B0020TS5LU|1.0|First; let me say that I LOVE LOVE LOVE this film. Beginning with seeing it multiple times in the cinema upon it's initial release, to buying, listening to and appreciating the wonderful soundtrack CD to the film and opening up the world of Ivor Novello and his music to the unacquainted; to buying the DVD releases..needless to say I am a big fan.<br />That is why I am truly so saddened by this VERY anemic blu-ray release.<br />What do you have to look forward to on upgrading to blu-ray if you already own the standard DV releases? In my opinion..nothing.  Zero.  NOT even an improved picture quality I would say IN FACT, I would say the blu-ray release's print<br />in of less quality that DVD's.<br />Second: on the Blu-ray, you get NO SUBTITLE availability. NOTHING. And you DID get subtitles on the prior released DVDs.<br />Third: Audio- I am not sound engineering pro, barely fluent in some of the terminology, but then again, like many average viewers who aren't either, I would say that the playback levels on the blu-ray seemed lower. To be fair, there ARE options for choosing your audio presentation (the ONLY option on the entire Blu-ray by the way). Lastly, because this movie is a period piece (1930's) and because of the very tone, era, subject matter and so on, this film is just about entirely bereft of any types of special effects, the presence of which..in a \\"larger that life\\" cinema world of today which demands explosions, machine sounds, and so on, the audio level here is pretty much that for the entire film..level.<br />Fourth and Fifth: Commentaries and Special Features (documentaries/interviews/etc)..simply..the standard DVD has 2 commentary tracks and a few Gosford Park special presentations..the blu-ray has NONE<br /><br />FINAL Thought on the Blu-ray: DON'T BOTHER; stay with the standard DVD releases
B00518HBD0|4.0|Just over 3 years has passed since they put out their last album, and this one ranks right up there with that one, as a solid 4 star release.  Also like the last album, the band stays with 5 members.  The original 4 that did their first 3 albums: Brad Arnold (Vocals/drums), Matt Roberts (Rhythm/Lead guitars), Chris Henderson (Rhythm/Lead guitars), and Todd Harrell (Bass guitar), and they stayed with their addition, former Puddle of Mudd drummer, Greg Upchurch.  As far as where it ranks compared to their other albums, I'd say about equal with their last 2, and not as good as their first 2.  Here is my breakdown of their albums:<br /><br />(2/00) --- The Better Life --- 4.5/5 stars<br />(11/02) --- Away From the Sun --- 4.5 stars<br />(2/05) --- Seventeen Days --- 4 stars<br />(5/08) --- (self titled album) --- 4 stars<br /><br />They stay true to the same sound and formula that they've been using since their debut, almost 12 years ago, and why switch what works.  It may get a little old to some, the sound and the song content is basically the same, album after album, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, especially when you have it down and mastered, and you do it very well, like 3 Doors Down does.  A nice album to add to your collection if this is your kind of music, just don't go expecting anything really new or different from their previous efforts.<br /><br />Check all my reviews
B000XUOIQ4|5.0|The DVD was in very good condition even though it was used. This is my great-grand-daughters favorite movie. Before we only had it on VHS. We were very happy to find it. The colors are so much brighter.
0525423281|5.0|Every teenage girl is drawn to the bad boy, right? The boy who plays in the band and is covered in tattoos. The boy with spiky bed head and always looks like he just rolled out of bed. But what about the boy next door? What is a girl to do when caught between the rocker guy and the adorable boy next door? Stephanie Perkins answers that very question in Lola and the Boy Next Door.<br /><br />Lola Nolan was born to a woman who could never get her act together, but raised by her uncle and his husband. Her two fathers are super strict and definitely don't approve of her 22 year old boyfriend who is in a band. Lola loves to wear crazy, kooky, funky outfits and never looks the same twice (complete with wigs and false eyelashes). Everything in Lola's life is as fine as it could be until the Bell's return to town. The house next door, to be exact. Calliope Bell is Lola's former friend turned figure skating champion and her twin brother Cricket was Lola's first love and first heartbreak.<br /><br />At first, Lola thinks she is impervious to all that makes Cricket Bell, but pretty soon, she can't stop thinking about him. She looks for him outside her window every night and thinks about him when he is at Berkeley for classes. When Cricket announces his feelings for her right in front of her boyfriend, Max, Lola still can't admit her feelings for Cricket. When Lola's mom returns in all her messed up, sickly thin, drug abusing glory, Lola just can't take it anymore. What she does not only makes her look deeply at her relationship with Max, but also the entire life she chooses to live from crazy beehive wigs down to the Marie Antoinette prom dress.<br /><br />Another fun story from Perkins that is just as good as the best Sarah Dessen book. She knows how to create spunky heroines and boys you can't wait to see them with. I loved Lola's kooky outfits and love for fashion, and there was an interesting part where she was called out as being fake and hiding behind her costumes. It was a real eye-opener for her and questioned everything she loved and lived for. I also really loved that Lola had two dads. Lola was part of a happy, healthy family that wasn't glorified or overdone. It was just a normal, happy family. It is nice to see same-sex parenting in young adult novels and treated as it should be- like any other normal, happy family.<br /><br />This is a good young adult novel for your typical young adult ages. It is perfect for those girls who love a good romantic comedy and just want a happy ending. If anyone read Anna and the French Kiss, they will be happy to find Anna and Entienne in this story as supporting characters. It is nice to see some friendly faces in the new book, but this is definitely a companion book, not a sequel. Anyone could read this book without having read the first one and understand everything just fine. But don't forgo Anna for very long if you haven't read her yet. Both Anna and Lola are perfect for that warm, fuzzy read we all need in our lives!s a real eye-opener for her and questioned everything she loved and lived for.

B0051T47NQ|5.0|Item was received in the condition and time frame it was promised.  I would use this vendor again and recommend it to others.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|...but alas I couldn't. I am thinking that the reason this is so popular is because the majority of the mainstream public don't read \\"racy\\" BDSM novels. Then this one catches on by one mainstream person with credibility and it skyrockets. The sad thing is that the popularity of this book will only spawn others.<br /><br />It is clear that this used to be a fanfiction. As a fanfiction writer myself I recognize the pacing and formula. One of the main components of fanfiction is the lack of character development. This is not a bad thing!!! The characters have been made by someone else, therefore the fanfiction writer does not have to go through the process of explaining them to the reader. All that is required is making them believable in the situation they have been thrown into. The author of this book has that fanfiction background, in fact this book used to be a fanfiction, she just reworked it so it could pass as \\"original\\" but she stuck to the fanfiction model of writing. Therefore, no character development. Ana, the protagonist, is flat, boring and completely two dimensional.  This is not good story telling, it comes off as either lazy or uninspired or both.<br /><br />I couldn't read it all, but skimming the parts of what I did read the author has only a loose understanding of BDSM. She mixes the lifestyle of 24/7 Doms (Grey's history in training) with simple flirty bedroom bondage (the ease at which Grey complies with Ana's wishes). And while I don't want to discredit the possibility of these two extremes coexisting within the same person, I will say that (in my personal experience anyway) that it is HIGHLY unlikely.<br /><br />I will not be finishing this book nor will I read the others.
B00005JKEC|4.0|Very good, fast paced movie, lots of action.  Another masterpiece by the great Denzel.  Don't get it if you don't like violence.
B003TWONOK|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. What I didn't like is the price of the Kindle edition, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had received a kindle for Christmas and was completely opposed to using it.  My friend suggested I read Fifty Shades and now I'm really pleased with the whole experience.  The ebook was an easy download and taking this particular book around with me was fantastic.  The story itself was interesting and not exactly what I had expected but by the end I had to buy book two.  Quick and fun read for me.  Would recommend to others.
0061714402|5.0|The book was in excellent condition and arrived on time. I was able to preview a few pages so I knew what to expect.
0439023521|5.0|KATNISS ROCKS!!! Her tenacity and both physical/mental strength make her a modern-day Lara Croft. I usually don't like these types of reads, but am enamored with the trilogy. At the end of book 1 though, I am not sure if I am Team Gale or Team Peeta. We shall see.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is an excellent piece of science fiction, originally conceived and skillfully written.  The story flows well and begs for sequel treatment.  I'm not really sure why it was released as five separate \\"books\\".  Just get the omnibus version including all of Wool 1-5.
1594203334|4.0|I liked a lot of what she said and it made me laugh a few times. It could have used a more thorough editing.
B004OEJMZM|5.0|This is a thorough, well-organized, lucidly written treatment of the somewhat arcane world of programming in the Linux environment.  I wish that I had had it in my hands a year ago when I plunged into my current project, currently wrapping up.  I will be much better prepared for the next one.  I enthusiastically endorse this book for anyone facing the task of building a Linux application, particularly if embedded as mine is.  The clarity will accelerate a newbie's ramp-up, and the comprehensive coverage will benefit the seasoned developer.
1400079276|5.0|Murakami is one of our greatest living authors, and in my opinion this is his masterpiece.  Kafka on the Shore is so beautiful and so surreal it will leave you haunted for days.  The characters are so masterfully crafted that they will become a part of you.  The existentialist themes are so profound that they will change you.  This book is designed to make you think, and more importantly, to make you feel.  And it does both those things, powerfully.
B000025Y9I|2.0|Great music, but was unable to copy onto my music server.  I determined that it was defective and exchanged it for another with the same results.  I assume that the CD is protected so that it only plays on CD music players as opposed to computer CD drives.  Unfortunate, since all of my digital listening is from my music server.
1416562605|4.0|A powerful book packaged in a short, fast read.  Adiga's novel gives you a glimpse of a smaller, meaner India than you might be used to from other Indian literature.  India is such a large country, with many distinct cultures, it's nice to get away from the setting of Bombay/Mumbai.  With this novel Adiga explores the themes of social subjugation, economic classism, and human value.  Your \\"lessers\\" may often be forgotten and ignored, and yet they are every bit as complexly human as you.  Adiga also shines a light on the underbelly of the Indian \\"economic miracle\\", showing that it's not all saffron and roses in the emerging superpower state.  This book belongs alongside Roy's THE GOD OF SMALL THINGS, Mistry's A FINE BALANCE, and Rushdie's MIDNIGHT'S CHILDREN in the cannon of great Indian literature.
B007Q476KU|1.0|Unless you're interested in seeing horrible things happen to horses you won't like this movie! I do not know how it could have gotten a PG-13 rating as there are three scenes I had to turn away from. Granted, I'm one of those people who love animals more than people so I can admit to being biased but I wish someone had told me what was in the movie!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Huge variety of different games. the controls all work great. if the ads are bothering you just turn off wifi. no reason you shouldn't download this. you only start out with 10 games and you can unlock the rest by playing or using real cash. don't let this scare you, unlocking games is very easy.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is very fun but if you like to do a lot of stuff your energy runs out fast.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|The ads on the kindle fire are really out of the way they wont intrude on your gameplay. All 3 tables are very fun and different. you get 2 more tables if u pay. controls, graphics, sound, is all very good. if u like pinball this is a must buy.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I've had it 3 months now, and it's compact, and light. I originally had a leather one that was too bulky. The only thing is that I seldom use the elastic band to close it because I didn't want to stretch it out. The cover stays closed when I put it in my bag though.
B003YCOIFY|5.0|Item was shipped super fast and are in great shape! Everything looks new and I have really enjoyed all the DVD's. Great buy!
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|I've read the Millennium Trilogy and have seen the extended versions of the Swedish films with Michael Nyqvist and Noomi Rapace. First of all, I highly recommend that you read the books before watching any of the film versions (btw, watch all the Swedish films in original subtitles not dubbed).  That said, I want to highly recommend David Fincher's new film version of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" which I have seen four times.  I know people love to compare which film version of the book is better and which actor does the better job in his or her role.  I have to say that Noomi Rapace and Mara Rooney both do admirable jobs with the fantastic Lisbeth Salander character.  Likewise, so does Nyqvist and Craig with the Blomkvist character.  Rapace's Salander does seem to be a more mature interpretation. Her Salander is tougher, and more directly in control; whereas Rooney's toughness surprises because she's obviously much younger (and closer to Salander's age in the book) and therefore seems a touch more vulnerable because of it.  Both film versions interpret the book well, but there are some differences.  It's important to note that Fincher's film is an interpretation of the book, and not the Swedish film. If I had to pick which film followed the book's details more closely, I would have to pick Fincher's, even though what happens to a key character at the end of the mystery was changed. But not significantly enough to effect the final outcome.  He does manage to keep the last poignant scene of the book intact, though, which I liked very much.  Basically, Fincher's version is more cinematic, better filmed, edited and scored. It is appropriately dark and chillingly cold, like the subject matter.  The Swedish film has more daylight and sunshine in it, it seems.  However, again, both films are great, both beautifully acted, and I highly recommended you watch both of them.  I just hope Fincher gets to the do the other two books and complete his film version of the trilogy.

B0077PBPY6|2.0|This was released in Europe in it's original widescreen format on Blu-Ray. It is going to be released here in a fullscreen format (1:33). Why? I don't know. Maybe it's because a lot of PBS watchers in the US still watch on their old format (4x3) TVs? Whatever the reason, it is crazy to release a Blu-Ray widescreen movie in a Blu-Ray fullscreen format in this day and age. But hey, we are backward in a lot of things. The Europeans had widescreen TV long before we did. So, don't waste your money on this one until they release it properly, if you want to watch it properly.
0439023548|2.0|It seems often to happen with trilogies.  The first book is good, good enough to entice one to read the second.  The second is pretty good and leaves things unresolved.  The third becomes a mundane good guys-bad guys story with nothing particularly new--well, perhaps a twist in the end, but a lot of slogging to get there.  Mockingjay is a real disappointment.  I would suggest that one read Hunger Games and skip the other two.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|The game was fun but I could not get out of the game without shutting down the Kindle.  The \\"stuff\\" button didn't work.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|Personally I loved this series though it did have its shortcomings. But for me, the good outweighed the bad.<br /><br />The bad... there is a lot of Ana lip biting. There is a lot of Christian murmuring, although both things I believe to be personal idiosyncrasies that the author was trying to portray, and how do you not get repetitive while doing that? There is a LOT of sex. Granted it's a romance but... wow. Rabbits, anyone? Also, not much exciting happened in the book. It mostly concentrated on the emotions and the relationship building between Ana and Christian. Some of the reviews stated that nothing happened in the plot, but again, this is a romance. This genre isn't about action or suspense (its refreshing when a romance includes those things though) but is about the beginning of a relationship between two people and is perfectly apropos to concentrate exclusively on such. So, meh... I didn't have a problem with \\"nothing\\" happening.<br /><br />The good...The characters were interesting enough that I kept reading. I found Christian drool worthy; the very flawed and not so strong hero of our story. Ana was sweet and innocent and has to learn to cope with Christian's issues. The S&M is mild but not risque. It was an interesting world to take a walk in for a while, what with the portrayal of the lives of the uber rich and sexually deviant. I enjoyed seeing Christian seek to change himself for Ana and overcome his issues. I also feel that the author did an excellent job of portraying the pitfalls of a controlling relationship (as I've experienced one myself albeit with a not-so-happy ending).<br /><br />It's not the best book I've read, but I wouldn't consider it the worst by far.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|The story is absurd. The world has collapsed and North America is divided into fenced ghettos. Each year a boy and girl from each ghetto are sent to the dominant territory to fight to the death. Technically they are picked at random but substitution is allowed. Technically they are not supposed to train, but many do. One of the entrants is a young girl with no \\"training\\" except that her ghetto raises apples and she has learned to jump from tree to tree like a squirrel while \\"picking apples\\". Not a very efficient way to actually get apples out of a tree.<br />It is not good science fiction and it is weak fantasy. As a teen romance novel it must work based on its popularity, but it's been a while since I was a teen and it just left a bad taste in my mouth
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|The Best of Me by Nicholas Sparks<br />Dawson works on the oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, 30 days on, 30 days off and has his money sent to places nobody could ever find if they tried.<br />When he was younger he fell in love with her, she was from the other side of the tracks and her father and mother held the college education over Amanada's head.<br />Instead of going to unknown places with Dawson when school ended she took off to college, met her husband, now a dentist and an alcoholic with 3 kids, and one also had died from cancer.<br />He ended up in jail for an accident and he would send money to the the wife and kids of the guy he felt he killed. He had met Amanda through Tucker, who he lived with and had given him<br />a job fixing cars. Tucker had lost his wife recently and having Dawson there was good for him.<br />When Tucker died they both came to town and got time to talk to one another and were given instructions on the memorial service Tucker had wanted private and what to do with the things he owned.<br />Dawson was still having nightmares of an explosion that occurred on the oil rig. He keeps seeing the guy at different places, he knows he is seeing things and when he looks again the man is not there.<br />While at the cabin he tells her about his cousins, they are mean tempered.<br />She must return home and deal with family life again.<br />Love how the book all comes together at the very end, thus giving the title of this book true meaning.
0345803485|5.0|The best book (actually best 3 books) I've ever read - seductive, captivating, romantic. There wasn't even a moment to be bored. Pleasure to read and reread (maybe)! Highly recommend.
0345803493|5.0|This book is in a league of its own. The romance is truly outstanding, better than just about anything I've ever read, including classic romances. Highlighted all over the place and plan to read this over and over. And by the way, I'm picky as hell and hardly ever like anything.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|I wanted the first two dungeon hunters but I couldn't.  get them Cu's of money. now this is freeeeeeeee so its a bunchees better
0345803485|5.0|THIS BOOK IS MY OBSESSION. The second one is even better. I'm not finished with the third one but already sad about finishing. Everything about it is awesome - the characters, the writing, the plot. This author deserves an award for excellent romance writing. I had more fun reading this than I've had in a long time.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I really enjoyed the book and wasn't sure if I'd like the movie. I ended up loving the movie. Emma Stone was impeccable in her delivery and sweetness as the role required. Bryce Dallas Howard was great as she went from bad to worse in every way as a character and Viola Davis and Octavia Spencer were phenomenal. I'm so glad I watched the movie!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I read a review saying this book is a must read.  It's not.  It is enjoyable enough and easy to read but won't go down as a classic.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Never know where life's path will take you and this book explores all of that in typical Sparks fashion. Love in high school that can last beyond is always an interesting topic and like usual all of the elements tug at the heart.
0615568084|5.0|When Girlebooks decided to publish a bicentenary edition of Sense and Sensibility, they were faced with the dilemma of how to make it \\"different\\". Sure there were fewer ebook copies on the market than hardbound, but even a cursory search on Amazon.com offers over 2,000 Sense and Sensibility listings. How could they stand out in such a crowd?<br /><br />Enter the combined creative talents of Margaret C. Sullivan and Cassandra Chouinard. Sullivan, no novice to the historical world of Jane Austen (she is the author of The Jane Austen Handbook) first collaborated with Chouinard when writing There Must be Murder, a sequel to Austen's Northanger Abbey, set in Regency Bath. Laura McDonald, founder of Girlebooks, had recently prepared There Must be Murder for ebook publication and knew that Ms. Sullivan's meticulous research abilities and smart, fun style were a \\"matchless match\\" with Ms Chouinard's lively illustrations--a perfect pairing for a beloved classic.<br /><br />So- as Sense and Sensibility turned 200 years old, a fresh look was taken at the book. For the first time in years, new illustrations for an unabridged copy of the book were created. Characters come alive--not in a dated, Victorian tinted way, but with faces and expressions which display both sense and sensibility--along with charm, alarm and a variety of other emotions drawn from a book that seems at times to be \\"nothing but a succession of busy nothings.\\" Certainly most of the major activity happens off page, and yet, there is nothing boring or monotonous here. Ms. Chouinard has provided 23 large illustrations...and, in a nod to Hugh Thomson, a charmingly illustrated chapter header for each of the 50 chapters! These darling headers give a glimpse of \\"what's to come\\" to even the most rapid reader, flying by the scenery in order to discover Willoughby's secret and Marianne's fate.<br /><br />While Cassandra was busy sketching and drawing, Ms. Sullivan was hard at work, researching the allusions which wouldhave been readily apparent to Jane Austen's contemporary readers, but have been lost in the following centuries. Her plan was to read it with an eye towards the first time reader--not creating a scholarly treatise, so much as answering the questions that arise when considering Colonel Brandon's supposed \\"nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins\\", for instance. (Incidentally, I discovered that these are a: an Englishman who became rich by doing business in the Indies, b: an Indian coin, and c: a litter carried by four attendants and covered with a shade).<br /><br />Sullivan's insights also help reveal the depth of coquettish conniving betrayed by the Steele sisters in choosing to join the \\"Doctor\\" in a post-chaise all the way to London, for \\"it seems that the party was made up of just Anne, Lucy and the Doctor, and as the post-chaise seats only three, it would have been a very cozy party indeed.\\"<br /><br />Although it has been many years since I first read Sense and Sensibility, I confess that I learned more, and understand it more now, than I ever have before. It is one thing to view someone else's impressions of the book on film, but reading the book again, this time with clever chapter notes (97 in all) which answer so many of my questions before I can even begin to ask them, I finally feel like I begin to understand the world that Jane Austen was writing in. Certainly, the book is far deeper and more complex--and better told--than any film adaptation to date.<br />Along with providing ample notes on the text, Ms. Sullivan has added to \\"the improvement of [our] mind by extensive reading.\\" Included in this edition are a biography of Jane Austen and inclusive bibliographies on subjects as diverse as \\"Biography and Criticism\\", \\"Authors Having Fun with Jane\\" and \\"Fiction inspired by Sense and Sensibility\\". There is also a complete list of Sense and Sensibility films--surely enough extended reading to satisfy even my enthusiasm for the subject!<br /><br />Sense and Sensibility, the Bicentenary edition is available in paperback, as well as Kindle/Mobipocket PRC, Adobe Reader PDF, Microsoft Reader LIT and Epub editions. Check out your favorite medium, today! All versions arrive with beautiful formatting and charming illustrations, making them instant favorites--easy to read and lovely to behold.
B0031Q0XCA|5.0|This movie is so true for life! Not everybody loves us back and sometimes we don't know why.  I loved this movie and the actors are terrific!
B007J09H76|3.0|I love Chuck, but he is not a very good vocalist. His piano playing is phenomenal but he should not sing. It sounds amateurish, the singing and the piano playing do not fit together. He is not very evocative, and his voice is not very strong. His other albums and Cd's are fantastic, until... he sings. Another problem is that he sounds as if he misses the point of the songs.He sounds like he is correct in the reconstruction of the song, but he misses the intangibles that make the songs great. These are songs that exist with energy and emotion, not just note for note replaying. I love Chuck, and I will probably buy this because I will listen around these faults and enjoy the sound of his piano, but I wish that he could do another album like \\"Forever Blue\\", that was a perfect Chuck vehicle.

0345803485|1.0|The plot for this series is basically ripped straight from Stephanie Meyer except the supernatural monsters are replaced with a man with childhood demons.<br />1. Plain girl that all the men around her are in love with (Best Friend, Boss' brother, New boss etc).<br />2. Older man with endless resources, whose beauty takes paragraphs to describe and makes every female he meets blush/get wet<br />3. Protectiveness/Jealousy = Love (the male character referred to as a Stocker)<br />4. Her car is dangerous and he buys a new one and forbids her to drive her own car that she has been driving in safely for years<br />5. The Main character is kissed against her will by her best friend and rescued by her man<br />6. The female is so fragile she must be protected at all costs (including buying the company she works for)<br />7. They visit her mother in a sunny climate<br />8. Are married very quickly (6 weeks!???)<br />9. Predictable pregnancy that of course at first is a crisis and then a miracle.<br />10, They have know each other for three weeks but can't live without the other<br /><br />I could go on and in more detail, but I really don't want to waist any more time on this series.  The Romance is unbelievably fast paced, the sex is BDSM, but that is portrayed as perverted/punishment, the plot is predictable, the man over protective to the point of abusive.

The story is about a naive girl, a virgin, who meets Christian Grey, a very powerful, worldly entrepreneur. She's never had a relationship before, and indeed, admits she's never even brought herself to orgasm. Okay. The first time she and Christian have sex, she climaxes from penetration alone, basically on command. She continues to do this throughout the 3 books. Not very believable.  Some may argue that, in a Dom-Sub relationship, the Sub is often trained to do this.  This is not the case here.  She's a virgin on her back for the first time, climaxing because he urges her to.

For the duration of the trilogy, Ana (the girl) refers to her genitals as 'down *there*.'  As in, 'when he touched my breast, I felt it *down there*.' Really? Isn't that how a pre-teen might refer to her privates? You would expect grown woman in an adult relationship, with a Dominant no less, to think of her body in more adult terms.<br /><br />4.

Amazon credited back my shipping charge, but that's it.  DO NOT buy from this company!!  They will only refund your money if it's never been used and in the original box.  I even asked for a replacement, and the would not do that.
B0038AUYB4|4.0|I loved this book and want to read it again; curious, funny and thought provoking. Although each chapter is in a different time and place, there is always a quirky link. Julian Barnes is a confident and intelligent writer. His understanding of the human nature and his provocative essays, take the reader to a different and challenging sphere. He tackles some non PC issues such as religion and dying. Only read if you are prepared to challenge your paradigm.

0062060554|2.0|Reading the reviews of this book I ordered it but was very disappointed.  The writing style was tedious and repetitive which frustrated me.  After struggling to read approximately 40 pages, I gave up and stopped reading.  I prefer reading books which are fast paced and create tension.  This book does neither.

Plus the images of bdsm are misleading of what little I know of such activities as done by mature, healthy adults. Skip this one please, I want my money back. Badly written,  horrible editing, and honestly stupid characters.
B007QNRMUU|5.0|If you've enjoyed Jason Mraz albums in the past you'll love this album. It sounds different than his last album, but for the better. Highly recommended!
0345803485|5.0|This book was so so hott. Seriously how can they contemplate creating a movie from it? I wouldn't be able to watch that in public. I nearly had 30,000 orgasms reading it. It's amazing. And Christian Grey, I simply love love love his character. I want my very own Christian.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|My 11yo wanted to read this but after I read it I thougt she should wait until she's a little older.  She is an advanced reader and it's not the difficulty level, it's just the graphic detail that I don't think she's ready for.  It would give her nightmares.<br />The books themselves are very interesting and make you want to read them - I was amazed at how quickly I got through all 3.

B00782O7IY|5.0|I saw this in the theatres 4 times. I can't begin to tell you what a delight this gem of a film was. I am a 27-yr old male and I have rarely gone to the movies since 2009, because Hollywood persists in producing/releasing such unwatchable trash, I'd rather stay at home and clip my toenails. How many sex comedies must Hollywood make per month before they finally realize \\"enough is enough\\"?<br />\\"The Artist\\" is a salute to where Hollywood originated and what people originally considered entertainment. Honestly, I wish American entertainment would revert back to the 20s/30s/40s. [Sigh...]<br />Jean Dujardin and Berenice Bejo are absolutely marvelous in this film. And I can't begin to express to you the joy I felt when Monsieur Dujardin beat George Clooney (who is an overrated, self-centered d-bag, BTW) for the Best Actor Oscar. I am thrilled to the core to see \\"The Artist\\" win Best Picture.<br />The ONLY reason this film is PG-13 is because the starlet (Missi Pyle) briefly flips off Dujardin and he nearly shoots himself. Otherwise, there is absolutely NO violence, sex, nudity, or language. They don't even kiss! This is the perfect date movie.<br />I am buying this the moment it is released. THIS IS A MUST-HAVE!
0345803493|1.0|OK, let's cut right to the chase here.  This is the continuation of the story of damaged people with HUGE(shouty caps)character flaws attempting to patch together a psycho relationship.  It seems that some reviewers here think this guy, Christian, is \\"hot'.  At least we are told that over and over (and over and over) during the story. But he is actually a warped and broken young zillionaire who gets his jollies from physically abusing and causing pain to various insecure women and girls.  The reason he does this is because he was abused as a child. So even though these women had nothing to do with his childhood, he punishes them with his whips and canes and disregards everything  his psychiatrist has to say. This is what some people call hot, steamy romance.  I call it sicko.<br />One of Christian's former submissives was scaring him and his lady friend so he had her locked up.  Apparently, in the State of Washington, anyone can be hauled off to a locked, mental hospital and \\"treated\\".  How about a court order?  How about a signature of a legal relative?  How about examination by three psychiatrists?  No worries there. Anybody with a fear and oodles of money can  put a woman away for an indifinite period of time.  Let's stay away from Washington State. Also, this action should be a major red flag to the lady friend. Hey--it could happen to her, too.<br /><br />The writing is repetitive and sophomoric.  The sex scenes resemble each other to the letter. There is much 'moaning', 'groaning', lip biting, eye rolling, clambering in and out of, gasping, flushing, blushing, etc.  Women everywhere are dropping at the feet of this 'Greek god'. (do women really do that?)<br /><br />I would recommend this to anyone who likes poor writing, thin storyline and repetitive descriptions.<br />If you have evolved beyond this type of drivel, avoid this novel.
B005LAII0I|3.0|There were a lot of interesting scenes and plot additions to the Snow White story and even the dialogue was entertaining, but when looking at the movie as a whole, it didn't feel like it belonged in the theater and rather felt like a Disney TV Special.<br /><br />Worth a rental.

B00715SUI6|4.0|Sequels and prequels are expected to be disappointing and with third instalments they are definitely cursed.  I'm a big fan of the previous Paranormal Activity films and I am delighted with this third instalment. It's a huge achievement to take this story on a ride that has all the ingredients from the other two episodes yet somehow manages to improve the experience by ranking up the terror.<br /><br />How can they succeed for a third bloody time? Well, once you introduce a good back story and add a creative combination of talented child actors, camera stillness and unpredictable moments, you've absolutely smashed it! Children are known to be more susceptible to the spirit world as we observed in the original Poltergeist (1982) and the ground-breaking The Exorcist (1973). In this film the two children's traumatic experience reminds many of us those forgotten memories of vulnerability we went through, the nightmares and the difficulty sleeping after watching something we probably shouldn't have.<br /><br />Set in 1988 the whole piece captures this period with accuracy, the colours used and ornaments, lighting fixtures the and 80's hair styles is a great example of commitment and attention to detail. I watched this with the bleedingwife and when the ride had finished she admitted to closing her eyes during the final minutes because it was far scarier than the other two films. I have to agree, it is bloody scary and I enjoyed every second. There are many genius touches with this production that really surprised me, they have perfected this hand held camera genre more than other attempts. However, at this point we must not forget  to pay maximum respect and thanks to the original, one and only, `The Blair Witch Project' (1999) that not only set the bar in terms of low budget capabilities and original simple camera work, but managed to market the BWP in such a unique way. I don't think any other film since has been able to repeat the `is it real or not' speculation to such a all media snowball effect.<br /><br />This PA franchise proves you don't need buckets of blood or special effects to scare the hell out of your audience. Simple, back to basics film making that every wannabe horror film maker should study. What clever hand held camera concept is going to overtake this one I wonder?<br /><br />If you were not impressed with the other two, then I doubt you would be keen to watch this. Many people just don't get the Paranormal Activity experience, it's too slow for them, they get bored quickly because they watch fast paced films that cascade a stream of impact moments because film makers are fearful the audience will loose interest.<br /><br />I can see where they could go with Paranormal Activity 4, it would have to be set in present day or a totally different environment, like a secured vulnerable patients unit.<br /><br />bleedingcritic<br />bleedingfilms.comch a all media snowball effect.<br /><br />This PA franchise proves you don't need buckets of blood or special effects to scare the hell out of your audience.

B004SB60OC|5.0|I first heard Christina years ago in a 'Cricket' cell phone commercial -- playing the piano and singing 'Respect'.  Her soulfelt interpretation and exquisite voice quality permeated my heart, soul, and mind.  I needed more!!!<br />I searched to find who the singer was, and then searched to find her recording of this song. Alas, not to be had.<br />And then - much later - \\"Lovestrong\\" was released.  My current favorites are 'bluebird', 'arms', 'bang bang bang', and 'jar of hearts'.  She is a unique artist with exceptional talent.  I hope for for many more years of her work -- maybe even including a track of 'Respect'!
1878424319|5.0|I apologize for taking so long to write this review and giving this book \\"The Four Agreements\\" that was instrumental in bringing me to my authentic self on earth the full credit.

0345803485|1.0|If you like reading the same scene over and over again, this is the book for you. It was so silly and dull. Really, I think that people who love this trilogy must not have ever read a truly good book in their whole life. It really is the \\"talk of the playground\\" but it's all hype.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Ok maybe it's me, but Katniss is annoying and really self-centered, before you all start bugging out, yes, I know it's about survival so you have to sorry about yourself, but even during the first games and now the second games, she thinks more about Rue and other people before she thinks about Peetar who is actually there in the arena with her.  I mean really how naïve can someone who has been through the first set of games be?  Even after learning that she has to return to the games, she spends her time trying to figure out the fake romance that she never bothers to learn anything about the other people in the arena that she must fight, that would be your first priority like Peeta did, learn their strengths and their weaknesses, does she think so much of herself that she automatically assumes that she can beat them all and keep Peeta safe.  I never found any reason to like Katniss at all.<br /><br />The constant doubting of everyone and everything and constantly going back to \\"poor Rue\\", ok we get it move on....  I saw another review mention that Collins' style is immature and I would have to agree with them.  Katniss doesn't grow up at all in this book, still reacts before thinking, and why make Peeta such a weak character that gets hurt in every turn of the game.<br /><br />It wasn't god awful and I have read worse, much worse, so with that said, yes I'll finish the series....
B004UID2LC|4.0|pretty good app. plays videos perfectly. only problem is that probably 60% of the time I use it, it will say &quot; app has unexpectedly stop... force close. &quot;other wise good app.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I saw this on my recommended list and decided to give it a shot, after seeing all the positive reviews. I am so, so glad I did. This book was amazing. And I looked up \\"The Avett Brothers\\" and decided I love them too. It was a quick read for me, but it really took me through the ringer. There were times when I cried, and then laughed in the next paragraph. I just bought book 2,[[ASIN:B007D90ALU Point of Retreat (Slammed Series)]] and cannot wait to find out what happens next. If you are thinking about getting this book, DO IT! You won't regret it.
B0063IH60K|2.0|ok I can understand a few ads. but this was insulting.  not only did the ads run videos but the close buttons changed from ad to ad.  this is not really free if you have to be sold on products to play a game.
B005KELW26|5.0|I am very satisfied with my cover.  I dropped it accidentally, it was protected from damage.  It was well worth the investment.

1439102813|5.0|This book will open your eyes to, and broaden your understanding of, some of the inner workings of Alzheimer's disease and what it is like to be its victim. Even though this is a work of fiction, the author did extensive research and study to get it right. It is so very believable. To me, it felt as if I were reading the memoir of an actual person, I felt the frustration and pain of her family, and I laughed out loud at one incident which was both funny because of what happened and sad because of why it happened, and in another place I had tears in my eyes because of the truth of it.<br /><br />Lisa's main character, Alice, is a very intelligent, highly regarded and respected professor of cognitive psychology at Harvard University. She and her  husband (also a Harvard professor) had brought up their three children and now, at only fifty years of age, Alice knows something is seriously wrong with her memory. She puts off telling anyone and sets out on her own, at first, to find out what is going on. What she learns changes her whole world, and that of her family.<br /><br />The author draws the reader into the lives of Alice and her family in a very smooth and captivating way. I wanted to know, I needed to know, and Lisa does not disappoint as she covers two years in Alice's life.<br /><br />At the end of the book, there is a section of Discussion Questions for a group, or for personal study of the novel. There is also an interview conversation with Lisa Genova.
0307352145|5.0|Can't put the book down!  Insightful, researched, practical, useful, and now empowers me to loudly speak up for my 'Thinker' needs.<br /><br />No matter if you're an introvert, extrovert, or anything in between, you have got to read this book to better understand yourself, your experiences, your internal messaging, your employees, your bosses, the markets, and all of the people in your life.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Thick As A Brick 2 is a great album!Your Customer Rating:<br />  See Detailed Ratings<br /><br />Thick As A Brick 2 is, if nothing else, conclusive proof that when something is done this well, eras, trends and even worse, \\"genres\\", lose their precedence. This album is nothing short of brilliant and endears itself to the listener more and more upon re-visit.<br /><br />The music is extremely well played and is full of well written melodic hooks that initially captivate but reveal upon repeated listens a sophisticated structure of both development and recapitulation.<br /><br />For fans of Mr. Anderson who wish to peruse his rich and thought provoking lyrics, there is a bounty for one's mind when reading of the varied life and possiibilities of one Gerald Bostock, the central character of the album. \\"What If's, Maybe's and Might Have Been's\\" describing how a passing chance or a chosen fork in the road always holds potential to change one's destiny, hence we have the Gerald Bostock character appearing in multiple and varied lives. The content is rich and there is much to be studied even as pure poetry alone.<br /><br />The \\"Pebbles\\" instrumental, one of two recurring main themes of the new album, evokes images of a faraway sea chanty or a distant plainsong of the moors in it's ethereally haunting flute passage.<br /><br />This is a record that will stand the test of time and is well worth your purchase as you will be rewarded through many listens. How many items of media in one's own collection really adds up to the potential of this? I cannot recommend this purchase higher.<br /><br />The Special Edition is well worth the price as in addition to a CD (and yes it is important especially in this day and age to actually buy physical product so that physical product continues to exist from record companies) there is also a DVD which contains a mini documentary on the recording of TAAB 2, a poetry reading of the lyrics by Ian (filmed against various background locales), both 5.1 and DTS surround mixes and a 24 bit high resolution stereo mix along with a PDF for computer of the \\"St Cleve Chronicle\\" cover artwork which is based from the original TAAB of 40 years ago.<br /><br />Congratulations to Ian Anderson and band for proving that the constant of time is what we make of it, and what we choose of it.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read a lot of books and this is the best one I've read in at least a year. The setting and context are super creative. The characters are compelling and complex. The story is interesting and engaging. The only disappointment was that it ended. I could have kept reading on. Really, an excellent book that I'd recommend to anyone.
0307956350|1.0|I spent some time reading the very mixed reviews on this book ever since it came out. I didn't want to chance it by buying a copy so I added my name to the hold list at my local library - faster than expected, the book landed in my hot little hands. I am not sure what it was exactly but I did give up after 30 pages. I wasn't a huge fan of the writing style and found the main character incredibly annoying. While I'm happy for those who gave this book 5 stars and enjoyed it, I was certainly not a fan. Very glad I didn't pay for it.
0345803485|1.0|After the third or fourth occurrence of the word \\"murmur,\\" I used the search function to see how many more I would need to endure. There are 146, which would be excessive even if this were a parody of the romance genre. I get it now. E.L. James derives pleasure from torturing her readers.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Don't listen to the people complaining about not being able to exit they just obviously don't play games that much, ok now go to stuff on the bottom right then options then WOW!  The little arrow on the bottom will pop up so you click on it then press the back arrow then vuala it asks you if you want to exit the game and the not now will be lit up but you want to press yes if its not obvious! yay you did it!!

6305313687|5.0|An open and honest tale of two brothers -- Derek and Danny -- both whose lives are going in two directions after one does time in prison over a brutal crime that gets Derek locked away for three years.  After Derek is released, he finds out his brother is headed down same road as Neo-Nazi skinhead.  Danny, in an attempt to stay in school must write a paper on his brother's once incarceration.  This movie is written extremely well, the acting feels real, and the color contrasting is quite smart.  The ending is shocking and done superbly.  Though this movie is R-rated and not for a young audience -- I feel strongly all indivduals should view this film -- you and all who watch won't be disappointed!

B005K0HDGE|4.0|I haven't been a Stephen King fan (never read any of his books) but this one I like.  It captures my interest because of the time travel, it seems so real, and the reason Jake went back into time.  I haven't gotten to the part where and if he confronts Oswald but I'm pretty sure I won't be able to put it down at that point.  I highly recommend this read.
0985114606|4.0|It is nice to see the quality coupled with an erotic romance. The character development and story line both deliver. You will not be disappointed with this read.

B000GG4KTU|5.0|Since my wife and I are \\"fans\\" of her, this review will be \\"slanted\\" in favor of this audio CD. We have followed her career via the CD's we own. This is another example of her jazz piano ability and her vocal accompaniment. As usual, it is a delightful selection of \\"standards\\" which she performs very well.<br /><br />We have attended a couple of her \\"live\\" performances at Yoshi's Dinner and Jazz Club in Oakland, CA, and a larger audience venue at the Ironstone Vineyard, Murphy, CA. We do intend on seeing her this summer in August at Thunder Valley in Lincoln, CA.<br /><br />If you, too, are a fan, this album would be worth adding to your collection.

0545265355|5.0|I came late to this trilogy and decided to read it because so many of my friends recommended it. I tried to find it at the library - it was all checked out. I put in a request for the book. After about a month or so, I got my turn with it. Consumed it in a couple days (I have a really busy schedule). I knew that there was no way I would want to wait very long to get the 2nd and 3rd books. So, I decided to buy them. Awesome price from amazon, by the way! So glad that I bought the books because the themes involved in this series are not only engaging, but also timely and thought-provoking. Some of the moral issues that these books force the reader to struggle with include the corrupting influence of power, class inequality, defining freedom, Machiavellian ethics, violence as entertainment & reality TV, the sanctity of life, etc etc etc etc. In talking to others about this book, they each have different views and interpretations of some of these themes. So, the series ends up being something of an allegory in which multiple readers end up gleaning diverse lessons and meanings from the text. Collins did an amazing job here. I'm not usually one who re-reads books, there's just too much out there that I want to read, but I'm seriously considering re-reading this series.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is AWESOME!!!!!!. it is so easy.. but fun. this is also like tiny village but more fun. I give this a five star rating.
0439023513|5.0|There has been a lot of chatter about how the first two books were so much better than the last book. I'm not sure how I feel about that assessment because the final book seems a logical and powerful conclusion to the series. Yes, the book is much different in terms of direction and following the \\"script\\" of the first book. But, the messages buried within the pages of this book seem to be so important that I might say that the last is the best of all the books.
B005ZB91KY|4.0|This is my favorite movie of all the Avenger series. I am looking forward to the movie coming in the summer.

1594203334|4.0|Warning--I am a devoted francophile and love reading about ex-pats living in France.  I don't want to live there myself because I think it would be extremely difficult to live in another culture, especially coming from California, where anything goes.  With that disclaimer, I have to say I loved this memoir of parenting in France.  I have to say, though, that the \\"pause\\" or as it's called here, cry it out method or sleep training, did not work for either of my two children who are now 6 and 13.  I let my kids sleep with us whenever they wanted which ensured I got the most sleep.  However, I love every other aspect of French parenting.  I hate how our culture is so child-centric and obsessed with perfect parenting.  My small community has mostly stay-at-home parents who enroll their children in literally every (I mean every!) sport and activity possible.  My son used to ask to participate in things he didn't even like just so he could see his friends who were otherwise never available because they were so overbooked.  I also do not like the expectation that parents will stay at birthday parties for kids over the age of 5--as a parent of a guest I love the free time, and as a parent of the birthday child, it's too much pressure to entertain the parents along with all the kids!<br /><br />As a working parent, I wish we had a similar high-quality daycare and preschool system here that did not cost an arm and a leg.  When my daughter was in preschool, I paid $1000 a month for combined preschool and daycare.  I also wish we had an acceptance here that daycare is not bad for children.<br /><br />Finally, I think it is good that \\"friends don't let friends get fat.\\"  Considering the health risks associated with obesity, a little judgment from friends and family can go a long way towards keeping us healthy, not anorexic, but healthy.<br /><br />All in all, I found this book interesting along with French Kids Eat Everything.
B0078JOU0W|5.0|I just started watching british drama a year ago. I was always reluctant because of their accent, afraid I would not understand the accent. I have really been missing great drama. This series is incredible love it. Acting is superby and the actors are great. A must see for all serious movie watchers!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a book that kept the reader wanting more.  The concept was very good and interesting also.  I have recommended this series for reading.
B005LAIH4A|4.0|After numerous attempts at live-action films, have animators finally found their groove when depicting a tale by the late, legendary Dr. Seuss? Or are the majority of professional reviewers correct in their belief that the subject matter is not expansive enough for a full-length feature?<br /><br />  Ted (voiced by Zac Efron) is a twelve year-old boy in the perfectly plastic metropolis of Thneedville. Everything in Thneedville is artificial and air itself is only available to those who pay for it. Ted (Efron), more than anything, wants to impress Audrey. Audrey (voiced by Taylor Swift) wants to see a real tree, but all the ones in Thneedville are electric and powered by batteries. Some even come equipped with a disco function utilizing music and mirrored balls. Ted asks his family where he might find a tree and his grandmother (voiced by Betty White) says that if he wants to know about trees he'll have to venture outside of town and ask the Once-ler. The Once-ler (voiced by Ed Helms) is a hermit who never leaves his house and refuses to even speak to visitors until his very specific, very peculiar demands are met. Once they are, he begins to recount the epic tale of his arrival in the forest and eventual introduction to its protector and advocate The Lorax (voiced by Danny DeVito).<br /><br />  In such politically-charged times, there'll no doubt be critics who decry this film as preachy or anti-business. Perhaps if I held beliefs similar to said critics, I might agree. As I don't hold such beliefs, what I saw was highly entertaining and even hilarious. I'm no fan of Zac Efron or Taylor Swift, but they were up to the task and while Danny DeVito might not have been the best choice, in my opinion, he managed. If you have young children, this film is a must-see that you might actually enjoy and if you don't have children, who knows? You might just enjoy it anyway. I did.
B00004ZB9D|1.0|I bought this used. It arrived on time, but was scratched so bad that I can only listen to about half of it. Waste of my money :(
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Nice time killer.  One of my most fun apps.  I would definitely recommend this. Please release an Amazon Trail. Please.
B0067Q42BY|2.0|The game is fun, I love the backgrounds, tile sets, and board layouts. however, it's really glitchy. i can't complete quest, because it keeps force closing.
B003EYVXV4|3.0|EDITED AUGUST 19, 2012<br /><br />I bought the DVD of \\"The Hunger Games\\" yesterday and watched it for the first time since seeing it in the theater. Looking back on my previous review, I realized I was a little too harsh on the movie. Watching it the second time around, I liked it a lot more than I originally did. However, it's still not without it's flaws. My overall rating for the film is now teetering at about 3.5. Not quite a perfect 4, but not a 3.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />*The acting. This was one of the things I was able to appreciate more watching the movie the second time around. Jennifer Lawrence appears to have been born to play this role. She embodied the role of Katniss perfectly. Josh Hutcherson played a pretty good Peeta. He certainly looks the part, with a round, sweet face. I especially liked him at the beginning, the way he followed Haymitch around like a dog, trying to get tips. I have a few quibbles with him, but overall, really enjoyed his performance. Liam Hemsworth was okay, I guess. It's sort of hard to judge his acting, with what little we were given of Gale (I mean, he wasn't in the book much more, but still.) Most of his scenes were just making angsty faces when Katniss and Peeta kissed.<br /><br />Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) was also perfect. He was exactly how I envisioned Haymitch. I also loved Effie (Elizabeth Banks.) Banks played the airheaded Capitol native well. She had excellent comedic timing with her lines and had a bubbly, vacant personality that was perfect for Effie.<br /><br />(I realize I'm using the word \\"perfect\\" a lot.)<br /><br />All of the tributes were also well-cast. Rue (Amandla Stenberg) was absolutely adorable. Cato was scary. His movement throughout the film just seemed to say, \\"Don't mess with this guy.\\" I liked his monologue at the end, which showed that he wasn't all bad and, like the other tributes, was scared and wanted to go home. Clove was terrifying. The actress who played her was younger than what I imagined Clove in the book to be, but her younger age made her more frightening, with how vicious she was with a knife.<br /><br />Donald Sutherland was different than the Snow I imagined, but that's not a bad thing. I liked that he looked a little more friendly. He looked more like Santa or someone's grandpa. The way he delivered his lines and his voice, though, said otherwise. He was wonderfully creepy.<br /><br />Moving on...<br /><br />*Costumes and makeup. The Capitol's costumes and makeup were insane and I loved it. It was wonderful. It really reflected how silly and airy the Capitol people are. Oh, and some of the hairstyles in this movie. I loved Katniss's hair during the \\"girl-on-fire\\" scene was beautiful. Also, Seneca Crane's beard? It made me sad that he died, knowing that I would never see that beautiful beard again. RIP, Seneca.<br /><br />*Glimpses outside the arena. I thought that was a nice touch, since in the book, we're limited to Katniss's perspective. It was interesting to see the Gamemakers add things to the Games. That scene from District 11 was also a nice addition to the movie. In the books, we only hear about a revolution starting via Haymitch telling Katniss and it seems sort of distant. In this, we got to see that the revolution was happening NOW.<br /><br />*Followed the book pretty well. The movie followed the book very well. Of course, not everything was perfect, but what book-to-movie adaptation is? Overall, I was impressed with how the book transferred to the screen.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />*Cinna. Now, he wasn't exactly terrible. My expectations for Lenny Kravitz were kind of low. He surprised me and I'll admit, he didn't seem completely miscast. But something about him still felt kind of...off. I personally feel that Cinna could have been cast better, but like I said, Kravitz wasn't terrible.<br /><br />*The score. It didn't have that broad, epic sound I thought maybe it would have. When a movie isthis big, you expect it to have a theme song that will be memorable (think \\"Harry Potter\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings.) I feel that we didn't really get to hear enough of the score, since there were so many silent moments in the movie. What we did hear was, in my personal opinion, just seemed sort of generic, like music you hear in other action/adventure movies. It just didn't really strike me as anything special.<br /><br />THE UGLY<br /><br />*Long awkward silences. At certain points during the Games, the movie goes practically silent or the sound is muffled. Occasionally, it works, but overall, it's just very awkward.<br /><br />*Cinematography. As many other reviewers have mentioned, the cinematography is incredibly shaky. I will praise it for this: It helped with the gore. I think the shaky cinematography eliminated some of the violence. You could tell what was going on, but it didn't get as graphic as it could have. However, it became kind of annoying after a while. I understand what the filmmakers were going for, but I don't think it had the effect that they wanted. It just made some parts difficult to watch. I also wasn't a huge fan of the zoom-ins they did (like when they zoom in on Katniss's lips before she blows up the supplies.) While the cinematography helped tone down the violence, it ended up looking more like a little kid had taped it with a camera.<br /><br />*Games felt rushed. Not horribly so, but I think the movie could have had a little extra time. I think the fandom would have sat through twenty-thirty extra minutes. One part that really suffers, in my opinion, were Rue's scenes. Katniss wakes up, finds Rue, there's a short (and I mean, SHORT) bit showing them eating, then it launches into the blow-up-the-supplies scene where Rue is ultimately killed.<br /><br />*Cave scene. This kind of goes along with the \\"games felt rushed\\" problem. I feel like this scene needed a little extra time. It ends up being one of the bigger scenes in the book, with Katniss pretending she loves Peeta, Peeta thinking it's real, and Katniss realizing it might not all be an act. In the end, this scene was mainly just Peeta telling Katniss about his near-lifelong crush on her, along with some rather creepy dialogue. \\"I watched you walk home from school every day. Every day.\\" Well, hello, Edward Cullen! It also made it seem like Katniss was really, truly in love with Peeta, as opposed to faking it, although I will say that towards the end, when they come home to District 12, she seems a little awkward with Peeta.<br /><br />Overall, this certainly wasn't a bad movie. It was a good adaptation of the book with some amazing acting. But it did have its flaws and it wasn't perfect. However, I think fans will enjoy the movie.this big, you expect it to have a theme song that will be memorable (think \\"Harry Potter\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings.)

B002JH3TW8|5.0|I own a couple Macs, and they all have the new 800 FireWire connector. I recently replaced my wife's Mac with a Mini, and needed to give her a camera for Skype. I had an older iSight camera, but it had a FireWire 400 connector. I read on-line that the use of this adapter would work with the iSight camera and Lion, so I gave it a shot, and it worked perfectly! The 800 side goes into the Mac, and the camera's 400 plug then fits into the other end of the adapter. Both ends of the adapter fit snugly, and it's of molded construction, so there's no chance of it coming apart over time. The price of the adapter was very inexpensive on Amazon and shipped free via Prime. It was much more expensive on the Apple Store site, and shipping and tax would have been additional.<br /><br />FYI, anyone coming across this review who is using this specifically for an iSight camera, it works with everything in Lion except FaceTime. Skype interprets the camera perfectly. Go figure that an Apple camera wouldnt work with Apple technology.
B0055SWM08|2.0|fun little app. BUT, the name of the game is logic, and it is illogical at times. move in one direction and you are blocked. move from the opposite direction in another square, and you continue through into a spike.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I enjoyed the story, well written, very graphic in some areas but well done.  The author has the ability to take you away to a different time and place and you become embroiled in the plot as though you were present.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|i don't like that you have to be on a social network to gain friend points. others than that I like the game.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This app is o.k. and the levels are really easy to beat until you get to world 4 ( there are 3 levels in each world and one castle to beat after you completed those 3 levels)  so when I got to world 4 I had to keep replaying because I kept losing the thing is once you lose you have to go all the way back to level one of that world even if your on the castle which gets so irratating the good thing is that at the end of the castle their is no enemy to fight and you can get one ups by collecting 100 coins and in the castle you still get the halfway their point. The only problem I have had with this app That whenever I get on it's like loading feint or something which is like this website with more of that companies games and sometimes the controls act up

B007SYWFRM|5.0|it is such an addicting game I love it so much if you like games like tap zoo or birdland this is for you
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I have enjoyed playing this game. I am on level 13 and so far am advancing with out additional money. It is just taking a little longer. I would definently reccomend it. I only wished it was easier for me to get others who play to become neighbors. I am now at level 50, I am still enjoying the game, but there are some glitches. Customer service is not helpful all they say is wait for the update. The update has come and gone and still having the same issues, contacted them again and was told same thing wait for the next update.Other then that they have done a excellent job of letting you play the game without having to buy the special items with real cash, you can just save up the acorns in the game to get the same stuff it just takes a little longer. I would still say get this game it is worth it totally.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|fantastic.I have it on my phone, computer and kindle. the only note application you need. what are you waiting for,?
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game at first I too couldn't figure out how to exit game but I figured it out go to stuff -options-then menu and arrow sometimes you have to learn where everything is before and how to use it just like anything else
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I had heard this book was hugely popular, which is why i gave it a go. It is brilliant! From the start it sucks you in, needing to know more about the characters and their secret lifestyle. I found i was unable to put the kindle down, trying to read little bits when i could, i was thrilled when i found book 2 and 3. Now they too have gone, and so the journey continues to find another story to read that is addictive as this. Well done to E L James, the books are superb!
B002ZG99A4|5.0|It cracks me up how everyone refers to this movie as a bunch of muscle head, has-been, type cast idiots who couldn't act their way out of a paper bag. And it's usually guys that make the comment, who if they were one on one with any of the guys in the movie they'd crap their pants. Honestly, what did ya expect??? It's an action movie, not a remake of gone with the wind. Oscar level performances were not mandatory. But, if they're just a bunch of idiots and this is C-level movie, I'm dying to know why the lead cast trained so heavily for months prior to filming beginning???????
0553801473|5.0|A fantastic story with twists, turns and many change-ups. The Author had many heros and just as many if not more villians doing all kinds of mean and nasty things to the characters.<br /><br />I couldn't wait to pick up the next book!
0449011909|1.0|Doing audio books to help with long drives. But think I need more from a series of books and feel that listening has become a job too.<br /><br />First it's a Soap Opera needs adverts for Tide thrown in. You are brought in to the story of the Starks, a noble and honorable family. Then over a long tedious reading with 30 word desirptions where 10 would do, they die. Anyone who does good and noble things will be punished. Yes that includes the Bad guys, do something honorable get your hand chopped off. That is the moral to George's story.<br />Second it's a fracking field of flowers, I don't need a description of each in turn. Used the fast forward on the CD player.<br />Third tired of hearing The Bear and the Maiden Fair song. Can almost sing it by memory now. Just say he was sing the Bear and the Maiden Fair and we get it.<br />Lastly these audio CDs are expensive but figured it was long and good for long drives. But now I'm reading that I go to book five and the story still isn't finished? Don't bother buying I'm donating mine to public library so check it out and save your money. But only to book three cause I'm toast.<br />Wasted money and wasted time.

B004EPYZV2|3.0|First off, the film is phenomenal (5 stars)!  Amazon edition (3 stars), I returned it for BestBuy Edition (5 stars).    --Original Review--  I had heard tons of praise for this MI film, and was excited to pre-order it, however after receiving the pre-order on release day, I read that Best Buy got the exclusive 2 Blu Ray (plus everything else) edition.    So now, I'm returning the Amazon edition, and ordering the Best Buy edition with 3 discs (second Blu Ray disc has all the extras). If you just want the movie, and a couple extra things, then the Amazon version is fine, but if you're a movie geek, then get the Best Buy version, I'm just bummed that I didn't order it at Best Buy on release day, when it was $19.99 (like it was on Amazon).  --End Original Review--    \\"While Ghost Protocol does not reinvent the blockbuster genre, it provides over two hours of effortless escapist filmmaking, thanks to director Brad Bird's zippy confidence guiding the many action scenes, Cruise's movie-star charisma, and a couple of engaging supporting performances from Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg.    One small caveat: those purchasing the Blu-ray through Amazon will miss out on more than sixty minutes of bonus supplements; only Best Buy carries a deluxe edition with these additions on a separate disc. It is Best Buy's version that Martin Liebman calls \\"a must-own package\\" in his Blu-ray review, a high-definition release that ranks as \\"one of the best releases of 2012 to date...It's not at all convenient that fans cannot buy this version through Amazon, but those interested in the full slate of extras have no choice.\\"  Source: [...]

B001VLXNLU|1.0|After reading about 50 pages into this book and seeing the R-word used twice I decided to quit reading.  I did some research and found out the author actually defended her use of the word after being called out on it and actually mocked it in a book later in the series.  To me it's offensive and unacceptable.  I will never pick up another one of her books.
B0073XORCY|5.0|If you want to re-visit the magic feeling of immersing yourself in a new album that gets deeper and thicker (sorry) each time you play it...you can spend your money wisely on this release.

B007EW9ISM|4.0|I had been following the cosmonaut project on kickstarter and bought this stylus the day it came out. I have been using it since primarily for note taking and jotting down ideas on my iPad. It is perfect in that role. The board marker style grip and the weight and bulk just feel right. There is a slight air gap between the tip of the stylus and the rubber coating and you need to push down a little for the touch to be registered. This saves you from generating inadvertent touch events.<br /><br />This stylus, however, is not the best option if you are in to sketching or drawing. It's ok for quick figures and graphs but anything more involved and you'll find that the constant pushing down of the tip to register the touch becomes tiring.<br /><br />To sum it up, its best suited for note taking but average for drawing.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun to play. easy for younger kids. wish it would collect automatically from the animals. my nephews love it. fun.
B005FLX2WC|4.0|I have heard cuts from the album and they were amazing - Beth Hart is absolutely pure heart and soul and Joe Bonamassa is a fantastic talent; together they are supernatural.<br />Definitely check this album out but avoid the seller Blues River. I didn't receive this product!
B006RUJST6|5.0|I have had the privilege of reading some phenomenal Indie books this year. This book is no exception and in fact had earned a spot on my Top 5 list.<br /><br />Wow, where to start on this book after my 3am reading session. First, I'm kind of peeved that all of these amazing authors are changing my POV on contemporary lit! :) I'm usually a paranormal girl, through and through, but on whims and extreme recommendations have picked up some fabulous books lately. Going Under by Georgia Cates and Wishing For Someday Soon by Tiffany King both are on my Top Reads list. Now, Slammed is on that list and there to stay.<br /><br />Lake is real and endearing. Will was sweet, genuine and made me swoon and want to punch something. Not him, but just...something. The 'injustice' of their situation had me growling for them. I won't say what the twist is, though I saw a review say it and that's the whole reason I picked up the book, but I felt their shock and outrage over it even though I knew it was coming.<br /><br />I LOVED the love between these two. I knew when the 'event' happened that they'd spend a great deal of the novel not actually together, but when they were, it was fireworks that had me checking the temperature gauge in my house.<br /><br />The story flowed, I never had a moment where I thought I could put the book down, I never thought a line or action was misplaced or unrealistic. I was floored by the way the story seemed to fit together and was proud of Colleen for a very thought out plot and delivery. The slam poetry part of it was new to me and the last two pieces performed in the book were breathtaking. The side characters weren't annoying as I find them to be sometimes. Gavin, Eddie and Nick were real and added a perfect effect to the story line.<br /><br />Bottom line: Read this book and have tissues ready. And be ready to fall in love with two, or three or four, characters who really need it.<br /><br />5 non-stop, beautifully soul gripping, tissues piled on the back of the sofa, fanning myself for hot flashes on more than one occasion, chest pain for happiness and sadness, stars from me.back of the sofa, fanning myself for hot flashes on more than one occasion, chest pain for happiness and sadness, stars from me.

0099579936|5.0|I kept hearing about this book everywhere and although it seemed to have been written for women readers, I a middle aged man who usually reads Stephen King, Ken Follet or Wilber Smith decided to see what all the hype was about.<br />The writing is fast paced and the characters are well defined and intriguing. When I got to the sex scenes I was frankly surprised. Are women really into this whole S&M thing do they all really secretly want to be tied up and punished?<br />What's odd to me is this fantasy that must be appealing to the millions of women who are devouring this book, is not a fantasy that I, as a single man would ever have.<br />The idea of subjecting a woman any woman to pain of any kind is not a turn on to me. I don't know about other guys.<br />The last time I read a book with similar sex scenes was in Mark Thornton's excellent super natural thriller The Souls of Dumah. In his book the character subjecting women to torment is evil.<br />The popularity of this well written novel just confirms what I have known for years - man will never ever understand women, to me as much as I adore them they remain a mystery. But maybe that's a good thing.<br />[[ASIN:059514568X The Souls of Dumah]]

B004EPYZV2|1.0|I like the movie a lot (hence pre-ordering it on Amazon), but I'm beyond disappointed in the ridiculous UltraViolet digital copy crap that they've started using. I can't import it into iTunes, which means I can't manage whether or not it's on my iPad in any remotely easy way (major fail). Not only that, but when I went to register the disc on Flixster, there isn't even a link available for me to register the disc and download the digital copy. UltraViolet is a poor technology that hasn't been thought out and isn't wanted by the consumers. I want a digital copy that I can do what I want with, not one that the studio is going to tell me how I have to use. Like I said, the movie is great, but UltraViolet is garbage.

B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is an excellent puzzle game with just the right level of difficulty. Completing most levels is a moderate challenge, but doing so in the minimum number of moves is the real fun.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Like many others, I wanted to read what all the fuss was about. What a disappointment this was - a waste of time and money. I only made it half way through the book and had to stop; I felt like the more I read the dumber I got. This book was literally like something I would have read in middle school, minus the steamy sex scenes - which actually weren't all that exciting given the characters and the setting.<br /><br />The characters were cookie-cutter from your run-of-the-mill romance novels: the innocent, inexperienced, beautiful college student and the handsome, mysterious billionaire. The premise was so unbelievable, as if any woman of her looks, age, education and background had never been kissed, never had or wanted a computer, never had an email address (really?), etc... And why in the world would a billionaire select this girl with no personality who had little more to say than \\"Jeez\\" and \\"holy cow\\"? I won't even go into my opinion on their boring dialog, their dumb email exchanges, the silly contract, and all that follows from there.<br /><br />I would imagine the movie will be better, but good luck to the person adapting the novel to a screenplay - they have a lot of work to do.

0340980508|5.0|The author, herself a neuroanatomist at the Harvard Brain Institute, suffers a serious stroke in her left brain, the side of the brain that loves to work with data, organization, logic. The uninjured right side of her brain, that morning, finds itself unencumbered by the now-injured left side and loves the feeling of nirvana. It takes a while for her realize she's in trouble and how she gets help is itself a lesson. Remember, the left side, the \\"filing cabinet,\\" doesn't remember 911. Ultimately help comes and we follow her through the first steps of treatment. But the most fascinating part of this, to me, was how she, with the help of her very intuitive and determined mother, climbs all the way back to the demanding career she has. If anyone tells you \\"whatever you don't recover in six months, you never will,\\" this book will show you how nuts that is. It took her eight years to recover all her mental faculties---and you'll note there are choices she makes as to what she does NOT want to put back in her brain. But she's back, and doing a lot to educate us all about this trip as only someone who understood, as a researcher, could do. There is a list of 40 items at the back of the book that I would suggest to anyone who is working with a stroke victim, even if they don't read the book. My book is out on loan (again) or I'd look at the title of that section, but it has to do with the things that helped her the most in her recovery, starting with those initial days: \\"Don't ask me yes or no questions; ask me multiple choice questions.\\" \\"If I want to sleep, let me sleep. So much recovery happens in sleep.\\" And so on. This is truly one of the most interesting books I've ever read and one of the most essential for anyone working with stroke victims. My son's doctor called me to recommend it (my son is NOT a stroke victim), and I now have told countless others about it.
B006LG74R4|5.0|My 10 yr old son loves this movie (and the sequel).  I'm happy with the purchase- it's hard to find appropriate movies for boys that they actually want to watch.  Doesn't hurt that Rowan Atkinson is a very funny actor.

B001CC7PKS|1.0|In this Director's cut, there is a scene where a girl in a biker bar is doing a strip tease and she exposes her naked breast. It makes the movie seem very dumb and very tasteless. This scene is NOT is the regular theatrical version of the movie, \\"regular dvd\\" version. Note: in the \\"regular dvd\\" version, there is still a love making scene, but it is shown in a respectable manner, NO nudity is shown.<br /><br />To my surprise this version also has a sub-story with the rapper Coolio. This entire storyline was originally cut from the movie. Coolio plays a strung out drug addict. His acting in the movie is absolutely HORRIBLE!!! That is why his section was cut from the theatrical version.<br /><br />This version is 30 minutes extra-long, but you are getting 30 minutes of complete garbage, that would normally be in the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" option. You know, that menu option that you might click on after you have completed watching the regular movie.<br /><br />I HIGHLY ADVISE that you purchase the regular widescreen DVD version of this movie. It tells the story in a much better manner that makes sense. And you are NOT bombarded with extra scenes which end up making the movie feel terrible. I have the regular DVD version, and I am very happy with that version.
0446573019|2.0|GAG A MILITARY MAGGOT!!!<br />As many times as Baldacci mentioned \\"treason\\" in this book, he should be sentenced to a firing squad made up entirely of authors who have had their work ripped off... and ripped off so pathetically badly.<br />I'm not going to rehash all the similarities between this drab, flimsy, copy-cat story line and a robust, rousing Reacher novel... or three.  I'm going to offer a couple of plausible theories for why this hack might have pirated and trivialized such a powerful franchise as Lee Child's masterful, military/loner series.<br />FIRST THEORY: Child and Baldacci are in real life good friends, colleagues, and old time drinking buddies who, in a rowdy bout of chug-a-lug, thought it would be a hoot if Baldacci tried his hand at something as surefire and foolproof as a Reacher novel.  SURELY, no one could screw up this failsafe line of escapist hoopla... WRONG!  He didn't just screw it up; as they say in the military: It is FUBAR.<br />SECOND THEORY:  Baldacci knows a cash cow when he sees one, and he's more than eager to lead it to slaughter.  With all the delays and speculation and striving for perfection that's keeping Reacher off the world's movie screens, Baldacci thought he just might be able to score.  If he could whip up a Reacher-like character (names changed, of course, to protect the real writer in the contest) then maybe he could rush his flimsy military-cop hotshot to Hollywood before the REAL police arrived.<br />Either way, the result is repulsively bad.  The characters are dreary.  The dialogue is from MTV.  The plot is outlandish.  And every tool of the writer's craft is simply ignored.<br />Do yourself a favor.  If you HAVE NOT discovered the Jack Reacher novels from Lee Child, go out and get KILLING FLOOR, and then read the rest of the series in order of publication.  THIS is what Baldacci is trying (and failing so miserably) to achieve.  If you are ALREADY a Reacher fan, be patient.  Find another diversion until the next Reacher episode comes our way.  If our luck continues to hold, Lee Child won't cut that wait artificially short for us by rushing a story to print without its usual deft editing and literary polish.  While I've been waiting for Reacher to return, I've read all three of The Hunger Games trilogy, all three of The Dragon Tattoo trilogy, and the first three books in The Game of Thrones series.  Oh yeah... after swearing years ago I would NEVER read him again, I also read Baldacci's ZERO DAY.  The title is such a prophetic description.Reacher episode comes our way.

B0059XTUVI|2.0|i think the director and/or screenwriter may well have killed Ms Streep's chances for an Oscar for this performance but for Harvey Weinstein's relentless campaigning for Oscar votes for her. It really defeats the purpose of honoring her career to show her in her dotage, talking at length with her long dead husband Denis or \\"DT\\" as she calls him, who seems much more alive in Jim Broadbent's caricature of him in death than he was in real life. I think the idea of praising someone so controversial was simply too much for those who still don't like her but wanted to do a movie about her, thus the emphasis on the less glamourous items and of course, the sexism. It's odd to see her play that card so often when as her media advisors point out, that was her \\"trump card,\\" as she would never have been PM Heath's secretary of state for education, her first Cabinet post, had she not been a woman. All said, it's a good effort at a balanced view but less now and more then would have helped. Also, she doesn't quite get the British knack for mispronunciation of words, like saying \\"Himalaya\\" instead of the British \\"Him-al-ya.\\"
1439153663|3.0|I found myself with a feeling of disappointment when I ended this book.  First of all, throughout the story it seemed all too often that the solution to many of the problems the characters faced was killing someone off.  Another frustrating occurrence was all too often a conversation would get cut off right before a character was going to communicate or learn something very important and that just made the story feel too contrived.  Also, there wasn't much happiness to the story's ending, it could've ended in a hundred different happier ways which made me leave the book feeling unsatisfied.  The good is that I found myself not wanting to stop reading so I could find out what happens next, the bad in that aspect, however, is that once I did find out what happened next, it was depressing.  So I give it a general \\"ok\\" rating.

The writing, the plot, the characters are all very standard mediocre quality romantic paperback fiction you can buy from the local supermarket.<br /><br />The author does have an annoying habit of repeating the same descriptions and scenarios again and again - and they're not THAT great that I'd like to re-live them every fourth page again and again.

I love how the author was descriptive when Alex was snooping around and when he was fighting. I know you will like this book and if your 13 or 14 years old because you will relate to the character like me. I'm 13 years old so i can relate to what he is thinking or doing except i am not a MI6 Agent. If i was you i would watch the video and then read, then when your done i like to think what is different or similar between the two of them. So i hope you like this book and i recommend this book to people that like action books. Thanks for reading this and remember to give it 5 stars if you like this book. And comment on my review and tell my what you think THANKS BYE!!!
B007L3BMGA|2.0|This book will probably not end up to your \\"Best books I've ever read\\" -list, but it's ok to pass the time and have some sexy moments here and there.<br /><br />The author does have an annoying habit of repeating the same descriptions and scenarios again and again - and they're not THAT great that I'd like to re-live them every fourth page again and again. Smell: fresh linen; fingers: long; inner goddess: doing a backflip; self conscious: tutting in disapproval etc. And: \\"Oh my!\\" x100000. Dominant Christian blanches, gasps, and whispers a lot for being a very experienced dominant. Maybe I was taking it too literal but it truly distracted me when every other sentence was whispered - that would make a really weird discussion in real life.<br /><br />I'd say go with the \\"Story of O\\" instead if you're interested in this sort of sexual literature.

B007KZY1YY|2.0|This book will probably not end up to your \\"Best books I've ever read\\" -list, but it's ok to pass the time and have some sexy moments here and there. The writing, the plot, the characters are all very standard mediocre quality romantic paperback fiction you can buy from the local supermarket.<br /><br />The author does have an annoying habit of repeating the same descriptions and scenarios again and again - and they're not THAT great that I'd like to re-live them every fourth page again and again.

0739378333|4.0|the book is written in such a manner that I thought it was a bit of a spoof on the legal proffesion, which in reality it is but it has an underlying story line that makes one wonder at the incredible compexity of the law.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Wheat belly has changed my  life.  The best part is, I feel like I'm eating so much fresher, better food, which in turn makes me have more energy, feel better, sleep better, has lessoned my spring allergies and I lost 2 inches from my waist in 3 weeks.  I'm not big anyhow being only 5'1 and I workout 5-6x a week.  After maintaining a certain weight for a long time and nothing changed, by cutting the wheat out its cause me to slim/ trim the fat from my midsection.  At least try it for 4 weeks, you have nothing better to lose but your spare tire!!
B006KSAPV0|4.0|Pedro Almodóvar is probably the most well known and revered European filmmaker working today. Ever since he directed \\"All About my Mother\\" in 1999, he has taken storytelling to new, turbulent depths. He reaches the highest peak in that regard with \\"The Skin I Live In,\\" a beautiful yet incredibly sick, corrupt, and perverse story about a mad scientist and his creation. It is at times a difficult film to watch, but not so much for its blood (we see very little of it) but for its aberrant chain of developments. Beautifully shot and performed, the movie leaves a queasy feeling at the very end (which is the reason I rate this 4 stars and not 5). The very last scene feels, in my opinion, a bit abrupt. Instead of the camera fading to black, I would have liked the camera to linger a bit more on the expressions, on the reaction of Vera's mother. It is a minor complain, since that scene also serves to underplay any emotion on the characters' part so that we are the ones feeling and taking in the life-scarring tragedy that Vera has undergone. Highly recommended. But beware: this film is not for everyone. It is a very intense and disturbing film.
B00023B1A8|2.0|I bought this, and I was a bit disappointed.  I am a HUGE fan of their music, but this DVD does it no justice.  The performances seem completely phoned in.  I am sure if I was at this show (and I have been to about 8 of their shows over the last 30 years) I would have been amazed.  But, watching with a big tv and a really nice stereo system gives away the fact that there is zero passion here.<br /><br />I can't say I blame them.  Still is as impossible a human being as he is talented, and Crosby has just been (admittedly) wasted ever since he can remember.  I love these guys, and I still see them every time they come around, but time has taken its' toll on them... even in this done 20 years ago.<br /><br />plus, the song list did not dazzle me at all.  If you have the money to buy this, buy the DVD \\"Daylight Again\\".  Much better performances, I think.  Then, buy the cd of Stills 'Just Roll Tape'.  It is amazing! Stills wrote all the songs of the band (ok, almost all the songs) and did the instrumentation, too.  The band is truly Steven Stills and his singers.  Problem is, Stills is keenly aware of that.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Fantastic puzzle game that is simple and elegant.  this game has great graphics and gameplay.  I highly recommend this game.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I can't believe something like this is free. It's great to pass the time but it's pretty addicting, lol. I really recommend this game, seriously, you won't regret it :D
B0054JZC6E|5.0|good games and fun..wish they had more games that had less points to buy games the start getting spendy. but other then that very fun
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The Bible app is wonderful! it could use a different narration voice though but still God and his word are Awesome!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|If you didn't get a chance to see John Carter in theaters you really really missed out.  I've been there.  I used to listen to critics and I missed out on some great times at the movies.  I hope after you finally get around to seeing JOHN CARTER and you LOVE it, you'll regret listening to those critics and internet trolls and NEVER EVER do so again.  Why would anyone listen to those who decided, like a mob, to gang up on this great film, or those you who made snap judgments based on trailers only, only to bully it from obtaining box office glory - glory which it deserved like no other action-adventure film in recent history? (Overseas audiences apparently still think for themselves).<br /><br />If you're one of those folks who listened to the critics pile on this great film, and decided to stay away, now is your chance to right that wrong. Buy the Blu-Ray/DVD! I hope after you see JOHN CARTER, and this great FILM sinks into your being, you spread the word and that like wildfire, JOHN CARTER gets the respect and attention it so rightly deserves. It's already destined for CULT status, that much is guaranteed. (Hello Blade Runner!) I just hope it gathers enough of a cult following to generate a sequel - the other books in the series it's based on deserve to be put on screen.  Us fans need to get really loud and be heard.  I hope if you are a fan of adventure films, you give JOHN CARTER a try.<br /><br />You may be thinking, oh I've seen this story before.  But you haven't.  This film is epic and tragic and wonderful and happy and funny and though-provoking.  Bottom-line: it makes you feel like the child you were when you first started liking these types of films - films about adventure and a hero's journey. Up until now, you've only seen the version stolen by others (no disrespect meant - I love most of these films).  But this is the great, great, great grand-daddy of all science-fiction/fantasy action-adventure films.  This is it - the source.  There's something refreshing about seeing that finally put on film. Only took 100 years!<br /><br />It is not a CG-laden crapfest that so much big budget sci-fi has become. (Hello Transformers and Star Wars Prequels I'm looking at you!).  The action is focused.  The backgrounds are real and/or look real - not a scene in it looks like bad green screen work.  The characters have real emotions and motivations. The villains are evil and the heroes are good old-fashioned heroes - not cynical whiny jerks. Taylor Kitsch brings a lot to the title role. He's a reluctant hero and you really feel for when you finally grasp why he's so reluctant.  Lynn Collins transforms herself into a Princess that could show Leia more than a thing or to.  She's that type of character you so rarely see - strong, sexy and smart. Not helpless.  Not a bimbo.  Not a vacant-eyed supermodel.  Mark Strong and Dominic West make for a great set of villains. And the CG characters in this are AMAZING!  They don't come across as animated, they come across as real characters.  I can guarantee you that TARS TARKAS, SOLA, and WOOLA will stick in your memory as fully-formed Martian creatures who just happened to be caught on film.<br /><br />The story of John Carter has been ripped off by countless science-fiction films from Lucas of Cameron.  And the damn shame is, our culture is so uneducated, that the media and masses saw the trailers for John Carter and immediately thought they were just seeing a STAR WARS or AVATAR clone. How ironic is that? Edgar Rice Burroughs CREATED the genre of science-fiction-fantasy in 1912 with his novel A Princess of Mars, upon which JOHN CARTER is based. Yes, I said 1912.  100 years ago - imagine that. He created the names SITH, JEDDAK and BANTHS (Sound familiar Star Wars fans?).  George Lucas tells the story of how he couldn't get the rights to make Flash Gordon, which itself was inspired by Burroughs' Mars books, yet doesn't credit Burroughs for the names and ideas he outright stole.  So, if the arena scene in the trailer looks it's from Attack of the Clones, that's because Lucas stole the idea from Burroughs books in the first place! (Gladiator-style battle between man and beast, with a crowd of alien onlookers, check!  Burroughs was there first buddy-boy.)<br /><br />The media and internet trolls treat the films that stole ideas from JOHN CARTER like they are the originators of the tales and JOHN CARTER is treated like some also-ran. They just don't get it.  That needs to be corrected.  See this film and judge for yourself.<br /><br />I sincerely hope that you see JOHN CARTER and fall in love with the story, the characters, the score and want to go back.  I hope you are mad that you were tricked out of seeing this cornerstone to science-fiction/fantasy by all the negative reviews and bad publicity surrounding it's release. I hope you DEMAND a sequel and call Disney out not doing their part to properly market and promote of this amazing action/adventure/science-fiction/fantasy/romance.  This should have been a summer movie release. Don't get me started on how mad I am at Disney right now.  The only way they can correct it is to greenlight a sequel.  And the only way that's going to happen is for you to buy this DVD/BLU-RAY and spread the word.<br /><br />If you get time, check out the facebook group \\"Take me Back to Barsoom!  I want a John Carter Sequel!\\"  Thousands of fans have already started to rally around the idea of a sequel. If DVD sales are strong enough, maybe it will happen.  I guarantee when you watch the end of this film, you'll want to go back to Mars (Barsoom) ASAP and be VERY VERY curious to see where the story goes next. Book two is amazing. I want to see it on film.<br /><br />(Please note - I am a huge fan of all science fiction fantasy action adventure films. I love Star Wars, Star Trek, Battlestar Galactica, StarGate, Avatar, Blade Runner, Alien, The Thing, Conan the Barbarian.  The list is endless.  But my love for all things sci-fi-fantasy began with exposure to ERB's Barsoom (Mars) series of books.  JOHN CARTER is the foundation for all of this love. It may be old school, but as a fan, old school is where it's at. Pulp fiction is where it began. I hope fans of comic books realize this as well and check out John Carter.  In many ways it's like a superhero film - John Carter gains the powers that the early Superman had - super strength and super jumps!<br /><br />Explore the roots of this whole crazy fandom by checking out JOHN CARTER.  Leave your preconceived notions at the door.  Honor its legacy by making this - the original - your own.

B004LROUNG|4.0|Easy to read since the very fist page. Will get your attention and probably you will read until the end. This is what happens to me.<br />it also presents a good sense of humor.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was looking for something new to read that would engage me and leave me thinking.  I'm the kind of person who can usually see were a book's plot is going in the first few pages and spend the rest of my time waiting to see if I was correct.  Wool is delightful because the story flows naturally, is well written, has excellent foreshadowing that isn't heavy handed, and takes intellectual twists that are a joy to experience.  It has left me eagerly wanting to know more about the convincing new world Howey has created.  This author is one of my top picks!
0439023513|2.0|The ending of this book sucked. The author left too many plotlines without explanation. I was very displeased with this.

0385523912|5.0|This book touches the soul of the reader in every way. It tells of a love story that was never meant to be. Firstly separated by wealth and status levels before distanced by the borders of two bickering countries. Demick's fine work in exposing conditions in North Korea is admirable- instead of a bland, journalistic expose, she grasp the story of the defectors and transforms it as an enhanced version of Orwell's 1984. The connection with the characters in the story is amazing: she narrates the story as if she is there all along watching the cruelty happen, walking side-by-side with the characters. Yet with all the heartbreak, the disappointment, this book depicts, the ending is optimistic and empowers readers to do their bit- even something as minor as informing others of the poverty and injustice in North Korea.<br />An enthralling read that will carve an indelible mind in the minds of all readers, whether interested in North-South Korean politics or not.<br />Time reading this book was time well spent.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I believe this trilogy should be read and discussed in high schools right now! There are so many themes to be discussed: politics, war, and prejudice are just a few. But since this review is on the final book in the trilogy I'll try to keep my thoughts focused! My first impression after I closed the book was that I was utterly emotionally exhausted. Then I read one of the reviews and it put things into perspective for me. This is not a fun book to read-I cried the entire second half of the book (I'm a very emotional person, so not everyone will feel like I did). But it is a book that makes you THINK-and when people think there's the possibility of change, whether that's individual or as a nation or as the world-whether it's a change in thought or action. It's real-and real isn't wrapped up nice and neat. When the war ends things won't ever be the same. There's physical pain, and emotional pain from things seen that haunt people for a lifetime. Lives are lost and families and friends are devastated while they try to live a life without them. The nation must pull together to repair damage. It's not about survival in an arena-it's about survival in the world, now.
B004499LX0|3.0|This is a movie about obsessed ploeasure seekers which a found to be tedious and boring.  Clive Owens gave a great pewrformance on a character I completly disliked.  No one was likeable and I thought Julia Roberts was miscast.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I enjoyed the story overall. Exploring what war can do to a person, especially when your young, gives food for thought; even though it can be very disturbing to contemplate what human beings are capable of doing to one another.<br />On the one hand I can understand the fast pace and development of the story, but on the other hand I found the details of the characters' growths and convictions a little lacking because the story moved so fast. I was left at the end (of the trilogy) with a feeling of incompleteness, like I've missed something, only it wasn't there to go back and find. The whole thing was over in a flurry of action and I'm not sure I was completely convinced about the chain of reactions that brought it about. But this is just me, and I was still hooked and couldn't wait to turn each page to find out how Katniss will escape from the string of neverending impossible situations. I'd definitely recommend it to any fan of epic fiction.
0345803485|3.0|I just finished the book and to be honest, I read it in about a day. While, I liked the witty back and forth dialogue, the pornographic sex scenes were more than redundant. I think I read it so quickly to see if there was something more at the end (other than just orgasm after orgasm). I have not read the second or third books in the trilogy, so I cannot comment much further. I wish it had better character and plot development, but this is an okay read. Overall, I just do not think it should be a New York Times Bestseller...let's save that for the really talented and polished writers. ;)
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|I didn't purchase this watch through Amazon.  However, I did read all the reviews on here before I did.  Having already had a couple Skagen watches, I was interested in adding this one as well.  I read all the reviews about how the clasps don't work or are loose.  I read how the crystal just falls out.  Having experienced NONE of that.. I was not too concerned.  The only issue I was concerned about was where I read the black color is easily scratched or worn.  My other models were the Titanium grey, so I didn't have to worry about the color coming off.  But I went ahead and purchased anyhow since the deal was too good to pass up. I am glad that I did.  Having had this watch now for almost a year, I can say it still looks like the day I got it.  Not worn or scratched or anything.  And I usually forget to take my watch off when I work on the car or in the yard... stuff like that.. and it still look brand new.  Love the watch, love the design.  Since i had no such issues with the black coming off, I have since ordered another black Skagen watch [[ASIN:B0007X9F7O Skagen Men's 233XLTMB Titanium Watch]].  However, that one I was a little too busy for me.  You can see my review of that watch here.. ( http://www.amazon.com/review/R2KZL3Z2F4OYSX/ref=cm_cr_pr_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B0007X9F7O&nodeID=&tag=&linkCode= ) it's a little more detailed then this review.<br /><br />Great watch.. love the slim design, the clasp system and the professional classy look.

0670023329|5.0|This book tells a story of how someone gets away from the most unpleasant situation a man could imagine. From witnessing executions to a path for freedom, Shin Dong-Hyuk, provides a sincere and ugly look into the prisoner's life in North Korea. The reason for being there matters little, but what's revealed in this book does. It's what was there that does matter. And, it calls for a human rights investigation...one that we will never see!<br /><br />For this is the life of a North Korean prison camp for political detainees. Blaine Harden's retelling of Shin's story shows how little we know of this repressive regime and how it treats its detained....<br /><br />Shin Dong-Hyuk was born in Camp 14 in 1982 and escapted to China, of all places! Then he traveled to South Korea and then the U.S.<br /><br />So, now we have an idea, and proof, of what goes on behind their closed doors. So, what does the free world need to do? Sure the regime has a million man military and sure it's experimenting with nuclear weapons and rockets, but what do we do as a moralistic people? If the past tells us anything, unfortunately, it reveals that we (and the rest of the free world) will refuse to get involved.

B0011FL7FA|5.0|Had a buddy recommend the movie and I was dubious about anyone trying to do work anything \\"Beatles\\". I bought the movie and watched it. I watched two more times. I could not believe the vocals and instrumentals plus all the cameo shots. Added to everything else, there was a subtle hint of things, personal, to individual members of the band.<br /><br />In all, it was Sgt. Pepper Meets Anthology, but very well done. I will watch it again and often do!
0007294662|5.0|Was given this book as a gift.  Everybody that visits is fascinated.  Seems the author has done a conscientious job of getting the facts right - some areas are probably difficult to ascertain with certainty but it's educational, surprising and helpful.  Am now giving the book as a gift to my parents.  Hope they enjoy as much as we have.

B0079XNWQA|3.0|I do not have the ability to compare his studio vs live shows having yet been to one - I can say that in other studio albums vs live RECORDINGS his spirit literally permeates every thread of his work. You finish all of these albums feeling refreshed. like just having a long heart to heart catch up with an old, out of state  friend.<br /><br />His previous works lets you know that he is a well rounded human being -a lover,a luster, a vegan , a redneck, a white boy who can rap with an appreciation for Chaka Khan.. And in doing so allows you to revel in the joys of being an individual.<br /><br />Listening to Jason Mraz is an experience; one that has refined my musical pallette for the better.<br /><br />This album has little wit, little play, the song about his grand pops is touching but devoid in the larger scheme we fans have grown to appreciate.Maybe it's because he has gotten (still not enough)recognition as an ...adult contemporary genius(?) that this new offering, though polished, lacks substance.<br /><br />Perhaps Jason has been in LA too long hob nobbing with the plastics.<br />He needs a vacay in the VA.(rhyming not intended)<br /><br />***************Extended For the Gentlemen who responded *************<br /><br />I love Jason and his music,  And I hope to see him at Merriwether's , BUT..<br /><br />1. The Freedom Song -<br />delivers his famous slightly Caribbean groove with soulful background vocals, and funky horns. I've always enjoyed his \\"uplifting\\" tracks. He sings them with personal joy yet broad insight.The lyrics are chosen with effortless grace.  For instance : Make it Mine - \\"wake up everyone, how can you sleep at a time like this\\" , Half Way Home - \\"I used to walk all along the opposite side of the road , and make others get out of my way...Never doubt us, Never doubt\\"<br />Don't even get me started on Details in the Fabric!!!!!<br /><br />Yet unlike Jason - these lyrics left me puzzled- in fact wondering if it was perhaps a joke when my mediaplayer went to the next song. Here is a sampling:<br />  \\"Come on along , I know you really want to feel our song/ We've got some life to bring,we got some joy in this thing\\"<br />....Really Jason? you can do better than that.<br /><br />2. Living in the Moment -<br />Has a distinct country vibe with a steady 4/4 beat , with the occasional drum frill thingy every other verse. Now there's nothing wrong with a little country,But when I heard it , It sounded like something else (but not as good).Keep that in Mind.<br /><br />3. The woman I Love,<br />more of a steady country beat. I really like the song, the lyrics are solid  -and though he holds back vocally I can really see him (or anyone else) really ripping this to pieces. I DO wish he would have done a bit more vocally though.<br /><br />4. I won't give up<br />Love it. Composition Great Lyrics, he actually sings...sweet.<br /><br />5.  Another good track. Kind of Bluesy. yet..still reminds me of<br /><br />SAM & RUBY! this simple, airy country vibe that he has chosen sounds JUST like  a Sam & Ruby knock off , but not good bc Sam & Ruby are... Sam & Ruby.<br /><br />that said \\"Be Honest\\" with Inara is sickenly better than Lucky. And provided some glimpse into the  Jason we love : \\"If you decide you want to move into a new stage/ Deleting me from pages on your Mission Statement\\"  :-)<br /><br />I remember Jason's face when he didn't win the Grammy for \\"We Sing\\". It probably was the biggest robbery in the Last 15 years for sure. I was upset too, and turned off my TV...but I don't think it was a reason to simplify his music for the masses.<br /><br />Especially since the people who love him have been waiting so long...

B005F6NA56|5.0|This has been one of the better albums of 2011, and definitely Feist's best album to date.  While it contains the same quality as the tracks on Let It Die, that aren't covers, and manages to capture some of the catchy elements of The Reminder, it brings with it more thematic and atmospheric consistency.<br /><br />What I appreciate the most is how it combines the best elements of previous albums.  It takes the folky, earthy, intimate elements from Let It Die, and adds to it the catchy, jazzy elements from The Reminder.  It also manages to lose some of the mainstream pop gloss and sheen she had picked up on The Reminder, that I felt never quite suited her.  It even has a few stompers, that see Feist \\"rocking\\" quite a bit more than before, thanks to very well done, strong percussive elements added to the mix.<br /><br />I guess if you picked up on Feist at the Reminder, you may be disappoionted, as this album is not nearly as \\"poppy.\\" But having heard her first in Broken Social Scene, I love the slight change in direction.<br /><br />It also seems to be an album that gets better upon subsequent listens, with new elements coming to light that may have been completely overlooked before.  So, I recommend anyone initially disappointed by this album to give it another spin or two. It's likely to grow on you...

030788743X|5.0|I liked this book a lot. My sister's boyfriend recommended it and I was really glad he did. The descriptions of all the old video games were kind of like a trip down memory lane and at some points I felt like I was actually in the old arcades of my youth.The book is kind of like a non-stop description of video games and movies with just enough plot and action thrown in to work but that is part of why I liked it. the descriptive nature of it kind of made me space out into daydreams of the old games. I really recommend this to people who grew up in the days when arcades still existed.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|Game is really fun, but the timers on things like crops and collecting coins from buildings glitch a lot and will continuously start over or add extra hours that don't match the description in the &quot;store&quot;. Also, there should be a way to earn &quot;cash&quot; other than by really paying for it. Like maybe everytime you level up, earn a dollar for instance.  Please fix timer glitches!!!

We were supposed supposed to study the way that Malcolm Gladwell writes since he is very successful in his style.I think he is an entertaining writer and this was a good read but I don't buy everything he's selling in it. I've read his other books as well and feel the same way about them. I'd probably like them a bit more if there were just a tiny bit \\"more academic\\".
B0054JZC6E|5.0|play this all the time at work when I am bored! would recommend this app to other people. my daughter also likes playing the games.
B000ERTAGE|3.0|Excellent tracks but it is missing some songs from different versions that I was expecting to be on here. Despite that, great CD.
B007K3KO74|5.0|If you are a Madonna fan and a vinyl collector, you must buy this release! The sound of the vinyl pressing will blow your mind! I also recommend the Japan version of the cd release.
B003O86FMW|5.0|All of the Hungar games books were exciting, well written, and action packed. Could not put them down. A must read set.
B007BWUIHA|5.0|The UK vinyl reissue sounds fantastic as compared to the original vinyl release! I recommend this release if you are both a Madonna fan and a lover of vinyl records! You won't be sorry.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|First, there is a way off. you just hit the menu or whatever and then hit settings and it brings up the arrow so you can hit the back button or home. I rated 5 stars obviously because I liked it. :D

B003O86FMW|5.0|This 2nd book keeps you guessing.  You get a greater glimpse into the characters in this novel.  A few unexpected twists too!  It leaves you wanting more.

B003XF1XOQ|2.0|This 3rd book was a big let down.  It seemed as though Suzanne Collins did not have enough time or pages to explore/develop the many different angles she introduced.  I felt like the book was 'all over the place' and did not flow. It was a big let down.  I know that 2 times in the Games would be enough to drive anyone crazy - but did everyone have to be so unstable? I found myself flipping ahead because certain scenes were entirely too long and did not keep my interest.  The first 2 books made me not want to skip a single letter.  This book made it impossible to read every sentence...?
B007BWUJ60|5.0|The UK vinyl reissue sounds fantastic as compared to the original vinyl release! I recommend this release if you are both a Madonna fan and a lover of vinyl records! You won't be sorry.

0345803485|1.0|I, like so many others, chose to ignore the hundreds of bad reviews this book has received in order to serve more prurient interests. However, this is the biggest load of crap book I have picked up in my entire life. Seriously.<br /><br />Terrible harlequin romance novels are better written. Even if you choose to skim through the unending boring parts to the more smutty ones, you'll be disappointed by the constant childish references to \\"down there\\" and \\"my inner goddess is doing the (fill in the blank cliche dance move).\\"<br /><br />It's incredibly rare that I never finish a book, and not only did I not finish, I feel like giving money to this author is enabling her amateur prose. For your own sake, just don't do it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|enjoy playing the games and love the bow and arrow best. directions in playing some of themm could be better.
0618918248|2.0|As I read Richard Dawkins I keep wondering, \\"Why is he so angry?\\"<br /><br />The other thing I wonder is how can he be so certain he's right?<br /><br />It seems to me you have to be careful when you start labeling everyone as \\"deluded\\" who doesn't share your worldview. When you get to the point where you think you are right and everyone is wrong - watch out. The mental wards of the world are full of people with that degree of certainty. This is the problem with America these days. Everyone \\"knows they are right\\" - no matter what side they are on. Is this a reasonable point of view?<br /><br />Science is a great tool - the best tool we have for learning about the material world. But science and human thinking have severe limitations. There is so much we don't know even within the realm of science. As humans we are all un-objective and easily limited by our own ignorance and myopia.<br /><br />A hundred years ago we didn't know there was more than just our galaxy. A decade ago we didn't know the universe was expanding. Dark energy and dark matter account for 96% of the universe and we don't know what they are.<br /><br />How much of what we \\"know\\" is even true? The history of science is the history of continual revolutions in our thinking. There is no reason to think that we have \\"finally\\" figured anything out. People two centuries from now will surely look back and shake theirs head at how naive and ignorant we were in the 21st century.<br /><br />Is there more to the cosmos than so far has been imagined or measured by scientists? Surely it is narrow-minded and even arrogant to deny this is possible.<br /><br />Personally, do I have evidence that God exists? I have felt the Holy Spirit on many occasions telling me that he does. Does this mean I'm deluded? That would be your opinion, about something you have maybe not yet experienced yourself. Not a very scientific attitude I would think.<br /><br />Does evolution disprove God? Personally, I believe in a God who works according to natural laws. If we don't yet understand all those laws then that's our problem. Maybe that's the point of this life - to learn to figure them out for ourselves.<br /><br />Maybe God wants us all to be scientists. But open-minded ones.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|PERFECT. WORKS GREAT ON KINDLE FIRE. U WILL LUV IT  yes there are some innapropriate ads but that keeps it free so WHATEVS. works great 10 thumbs up
0307352145|5.0|Quiet helps us understand those who have stayed under the radar based on our culture's bias towards extroverted showmanship.  Not only are we provided with an understanding and appreciation of introverts, but we also learn how best to harness the strengths that have gone unrecognized.  Very helpful for those working with others in any capacity.  As a psychotherapist it has already helped in my work with clients.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I and my six year old love it.  Just got for the Kindle and looks really amazing on my new ipad.
B007NCT36U|5.0|If I would have written my review after the first or second listen I would have probably given it 1 star... After 10+ entire playthroughs though, this album is dope.  The only track I skip is the intro, but I'm lovin every other track.  Great sophomore album Nicki.  Please come hard on your third major release.
0062060562|5.0|My reader friends you have to indulge in this book! It will keep you guessing at every angle and make you wonder what would happen if YOU lost your memory every nite and had to rely on others to tell you your life story!! Very intriguing!!  =)
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|If you ever wanna take clean notes on both a tablet and a laptop easily use this app. it is great at quick writing. I wish there were some more structured options but its like a drppbox for text files that updates on its own. Anyone who plans on writing anything should check this out.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Kids having a blast playing with all their favorite ice age characters.  Fun for the whole family.  easy to play andcentertaining for all.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Great little sharpener. its smaller than i imagined from the pictures but it works great with my 6 month old Kershaw OSo Sweet spring assisted pocketknife. its small enough to use with pocketknives and big enough to use on a hatchet (which i have tried and it worked great).
B006OOHYIC|5.0|Once I tried Quell for the 1st time, I was instantly addicted to this puzzle game &amp; it is beautiful on my Kindle Fire...so as soon as I saw Quell Reflect app I purchased it right away. Plus I thought that 99&cent; was a bargain.<br />I enjoy Reflect as much if not more than the original. Reflect has cool enhancements that I highly recommend to check out esp if u enjoyed original Quell.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|amazing I love playing it. and my God sister love to play if too. you should love to play this game
B004UID2LC|1.0|it caused a virus on my kindle fire for days I couldn't open my apps or app store it finally opened bac up and I got virus protection and antivirus scan
B006PTL1GC|4.0|As a person who has for all of my career been interested in Psychoanalysis, I really enjoyed this movie. I read other reviews and lay people are not all that impressed it seems. They thought Keira Knightly's acting was a bit \\"over the top\\" in the beginning. I assure them it was not  - I have seen people just like that in mental hospitals - and people who were even worse. The Blu ray as usual was well done - wow just great for the home cinema. If anything I thought Viggo Mortenson was a bit understated, but then he usually is - his performance in Lord of the Rings was very laid back, and I was hoping for a bit more pizazz. He maybe thought Freud was ultra conservative - or at least had to appear so - maybe he was spot on, difficult to tell. If Jung was like that he was not as nice as I had hoped. Also I thought Mrs Jung a bit insipid. Keira Knightly really shone and was a treat to watch.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|this game is fun. fyi the pigs stole the egg and the birds want them back! my favorite one is the black one.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|Okay, this is my first review and I want to be very helpful with everyone. Most of the people who rate this as 1 star probably had a problem with the signal strength not the Link Quality or maybe the Installation.<br /><br />In the installation process it's a must to plug the device first before installing the driver. Also if you are using Windows 7 I prefer for you to download the driver using the Windows update then update the driver again using the CD. I want to give this 4 stars but because I was able to make it run perfectly using that way so it doesn't matter anymore.<br /><br />Going to the review, I really love this device and it was amazing that the previous 1 bar became full bars although that is just the link quality that means is the connection is well connected and you won't get disconnected easily. However I noticed that my signal strength is still at 2 bars.. what does that mean? let me explain..<br /><br />The Link Quality is how perfect the condition of the connection between the router and the computer.. if the Link Quality is over 95% that means that you won't get disconnected easily coz if the link quality is so low, you might get disconnected frequently.<br /><br />The Signal Strength is how powerful the speed of Alfa device can give you.. It depends.. the Maximum speed it can give is 150 mbps(this is the alfa device) however most of our internet connections are mostly around 10-20 mbps so that's a good thing for us already. If the signal strength is very low, and you're downloading, even if the link quality is very high, your download speed will still be slow. so be sure to check the best position where alfa device can get its best signal strength. I recommend you buying a good antenna for this, but I'm still waiting for the antenna. I will update this review once it comes and will tell you if I will recommend this antenna for you.<br /><br />It was nice to have this device as it can maximize your normal wireless speed connection.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. the menus are a little compilicated but its easy to understand and is kid friendly. I recommend this app to every one
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun fun game had a small glitch but restarted it and it was fine. reminds me of a game i played as a kid
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I enjoyed this book very much.  As I said its playful but steamy.  I appreciated the innocence of Ana transposed by the quirkiness of Christian.  I love the fact that it is a trilogy.  Sexually explicit in a rather immature way as it is told by Ana.  Can't wait to read the other two.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|this game is super fun and there's so many different things you do.  this game kinda  reminds me of the app We Rule.
0765365278|4.0|This is the first book by Brandon Sanderson I've read but it won't be the last.  While I've enjoyed some epic fantasies--most notably the Game of Throne series--I don't consider myself a major fan of the genre.<br /><br />My take on The Way of Kings: if Sanderson can infuse future installments with the page-turning readability of the last half of this book he will have accomplished something quite noteworthy.  This does imply that I found the first half of the book a bit slower than I would have liked.  A stern editor might have insisted on some judicious culling here and there.  But the second half: wow!  What a great blend of suspense, science, mysticism, and culture.  And most importantly the characters finally came alive for me, all fleshed out and three-dimensional.<br /><br />I can only hope that his writing will continue to soar as I await the second book.

B004Z8ZFAI|5.0|My grandson watches this movie at least seven times a week since I purchased it. I also enjoy the movie and the music is great. It really makes you want to dance. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a movie that makes you feel good.
0345803507|3.0|Let me start by saying that I'm one of those people that once I start reading a book series, I will soldier on to the bitter end regardless of how terrible the series might be.  Why?  Because I can't stand simply not knowing what happens and because a part of me simply hopes that the series will improve.  I'm currently fighting my way through a series that has managed to drag itself out for eight books now and I'm just dying for it to be over all ready.<br /><br />The Fifty Shades series is not the worst series I've ever read, but it's far from the best and I'm grateful that it was only a trilogy and nothing more.<br /><br />By the time I got to Fifty Shades Freed, I found myself more and more irritated with Ana's character.  Despite her introduction to the world of BDSM and sex in general, she still maintains this ridiculous naivete that simply requires more suspension of belief than I'm willing to muster.  You realize your husband is a control-freak, you've had lengthy discussions with him about it, but you continually do things that you know will set him off and lead to a fight.  Are you stupid?  It all seemed much too contrived and convenient and I found myself rolling my eyes at parts thinking to myself, \\"My God, Christian, you could have done so much better.\\"<br /><br />By this point in the series, the sex scenes are sort of formulaic and expected, and I found myself more or less skimming most of them so that I could get back to the primary plot.<br /><br />As other people have mentioned, E L James could really have made use of a good thesaurus.  I got tired of hearing Christian referred to as \\"mercurial\\" when I know there are plenty of synonyms out there to describe his mood swings.  Other words or phrases that were simply over-used include, \\"inner goddess\\" and \\"find/found his release\\" amongst others.  Lots of gasping, grabbing hair at the nape of the neck, hearts pounding, etc. etc.  It was disappointing that there were times when Christian and Ana literallysaid the exact same thing from one sex scene to the next.<br /><br />Having said all that, the plot is ok if expected but it's enough to keep you interested if you've made it this far.  The sex scenes are still pretty hot.  The love story is there, but it's a little too fairy-tale for me personally.
0307592731|1.0|While Ms Strayed may have needed this cathartic rendition of her trail walk, the reading public did not.  The dangers she encountered were not frightening and were often a product of her frequently acknowledged lack of preparedness.  A bear!  It walked away.  A rattlesnake!  It rattled and she walked around it.  No water!  She walked to a nearby road and got help.  Lost boots.  Buy some more.  She provided a map early in the book that showed how far she walked and when she left the trail to hitch rides.<br /><br />Where's the tension?  Ms Strayed wrote this many years after her actual hike, yet her descriptions were unbelievably (to me) vivid and often alliterative or metaphoric without quoting her journal.  Perfect memory?  Maybe. Validation of authenticity?  Quite the antithesis.<br /><br />Far too much of the book was dedicated to trying to elicit sympathy for her's and her mother's life experiences. It became tedious and simply didn't work for her.  Ms Strayed came across as too self-indulgent to fulfill the role of heroine.  She was not particularly likable.  Read Bill Bryson's account of his Appalachian Trail experiences instead if you want a five star adventure.
159562015X|4.0|The utility of this book is based on the buyer learning his/her work profile by taking the author's strength finder exam and using the book to understand the test results.  The purchase of a new book entitles the buyer to access the test once by using a code supplied in the book.  I learned this by buying a used copy and then buying a new copy....  The book provided reasonable insights into my work style as well as a way of understanding others.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I love the Walking Dead, it is probably my favorite show on Television. The characters are all so dynamic, the zombies look digustingly real, and the tense plot keeps me entertained every week. There are some very deep moments in the show where Rick's leadership comes into question, Shane's role in the group becomes questionable, and various character's mental stability is put to the test. However, the interesting thing is that that can all get interrupted by a hoard of motherless, flesh-eating zombies attacking them, threatening their lives.<br />As for the DVD itself, there is no reason for it to decrease my review of it any lower. Most people buy them just for the actual shows themselves, with the added content and other features as a bonus. This does not make it cost $50-$60 in stores, but that's why I went to Amazon.com, to get it $30-$40 cheaper.
B0059XTUVI|2.0|This movie was such a disappointment. The script was lame , with such an interesting subject and great actress, what happened????????<br />  Meryl Streep did win the oscar and I thought she deserved it.  There was way too much \\"jumping around.\\"
B006Z21ZEM|3.0|When Maiden releases live material, at least half the songs should be new material. There's enough classic live Maiden stuff to fill a barrel. There are six or so songs on Final Frontier that are great songs. Why are songs like Mother Of Mercy,The Alchemist,Isle Of Avalon, or Coming Home not included? Love Maiden, but the set list for new live discs needs to get better.
0439023491|4.0|This book, while very good, has the distinct flavor of a middle book in a trilogy. Collins' writing style grabs and doesn't let you out until the back cover falls, leaving you wanting more. That hasn't changed from the first book, but there were some places where it felt like the story was retreading just so there was enough length to get it to the bombshell last pages.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it good game,  like a lot of them in it ..<br />favorite one is the soccer and cookie game
B0052VUNHC|2.0|It appears that the author was thinking more of high school than college life. Cafeteria scenes were downright ridiculous and laughable that it made me think the author had never been in a college or university campus. If the author was going for Fifty Shades type of hero/heroine, she completely missed the mark. Travis reminds me of Brutus from Popeye... a brute through and through with no redeeming qualities at all. Abby comes across as a trashy girl who in five years time will look like an old hag... haggard, battered and abused.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wow if your a prude this is not for you. Five stars is not enough to rate and neither is xxx-rated.<br />Hot wet and beyond sexy. A book that puts the pink in your cheeks and an extra beat in your heart.Puts our husbands on notice (shame).<br />And so will the next three books that follow. A must read and a reason to run home to read. Hard to put down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Started off a little slow but once the storyline unfolded I couldn't put it down until I had finished it.
B005COO1X6|1.0|I have always loved Stephen King's writing! I have been reading his work for 35 years. That said, this book/story changed my opinion that he could never write a bad book.  I could not believe how this story ended.  It read like a story a 10 year old would write.  I turned back and forth between the last 2 pages 3-4 times thinking I had somehow skipped pages.  After reading \\"11/22/63\\" and \\"Under the Dome\\" this year, I was left feeling like I had wasted the hour it took to read this book.
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|Having finished reading Amazon's complimentary e-copy of Pride and Prejudice on my Kindle, I was ready to watch the movie adaptation of this delightful story. I knew that the BBC 1995 version was the golden standard having watched snippets of both the 1995 and 2005 versions on Youtube. One night, while surfing through the tv channels, I caught the second half of this 2005 adaptation. I've enjoyed it very much and decided to purchase the dvd + digital product.<br /><br />This was not a 100% faithful adaptation of the book. It took poetic license in capturing Jane Austen's witty observations. The fireworks between Mr. Darcy and Lizzy Bennet were there. Kiera Knightley's portrayal to some might represent the same old \\"I am tough\\" mentality but it brought to live Lizzie's wittiness and intelligence when she stood up to Darcy and his aunt, Lady Catherine. One could felt the loving bonds between Lizzie and her father (Donald Sutherland) towards the end of the  movie when she declared her love for Mr. Darcy. Of course, the American ending was a bit \\"saccharine\\" as observed by the actor Matthew Macfadyen  (Mr.Darcy) in his interviews.<br /><br />The cinematography was simply beautiful. It was noted in the DVD commentary that one of scenes was filmed next to a 500 years old tree.<br /><br />I was able to download the digital copy from Itunes using the provided complimentary code and watch the digital copy.<br /><br />This movie has 2.8 million likes on Facebook. Those statistics speak for the popularity of the movie.
0307454568|4.0|Started off a bit slow, but once I got going I couldn't stop reading!  As in the previous books Larson does an awesome job painting a picture of his characters.  It lets you identify with them almost to a point of making believe that actually exist in real life.  It's ashame he passed before he could finish this awesome saga.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|I bought this kit to easily download pics on my new iPad. Works great, and oh so easy! Worth the price.
B003EI2EH2|5.0|To be quite honest when my sister gave me this book I was a bit skeptical.  I am an avid weightlifter and follow a bodybuilding lifestyle. But Tim Ferris does an amazing job at supporting all of his theories with scientific evidence.  His slow carb diet is one that I definitely would consider if I were ever to try to lose some weight.  I think this would be a great guide to anyone who has little knowledge about diet and physical wellness. One thing I would recommend is not to read this book like a narrative. Pick out the chapters that interest you read them, go back to them, hop around through the book. It is more of an encyclopedia. Very well done! Highly reccomend.
1401937519|5.0|This book is probably not going to be enjoyed by someone that is firm in their religious or spiritual faith & that's ok. For me it was a perfect expansion on what I'd learned from law of attraction books I read. I am 35 & I've been struggling for 9 years or so with a chronic illness that has sucked away my quality of life. However, this book shed a new light on that. I hope this book is as life changing for me as it has the potential to be. It encourages compassion where it is most difficult. For someone that is open minded about spirituality, this is the perfect read.
0061733199|5.0|This is a great book that gives a lot of brief but useful information. It doesn't give the most detail on any of the subjects, but it gives you the amount you would need in a survival situation. There also is a lot of common since information in this book which you'll find yourself filtering through. It's worth the buy though.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I reaaallly love this app. I like it because I can play all sorts of games and never get tired
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love the movement of the cards. Very easy to install on the Kindle Fire.  Fun to play!! I would highly recommend this game to all ages!!
B007HJ91HU|5.0|It was just as good as the first!! I was pleasantly surprised! I enjoyed the music as well. Can't wait to watch it again.
1559402652|5.0|I like the beatles and is my favorite group.  I like the music very much and I even play piano, guitar and mandollin.<br />I like learning to play the guitar because it's a good instrument.  I like the Beatles Dvd becauzse it's nice music and I enjoy it.  I will give five stars and excellent review.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|i loved this book. I fell like i could connect with it. i just wish there was a better ending
B002JVWR9U|5.0|Since, I'm against the whole Twilight craze, I was very reluctant to try Vampire Diaries. But I've found that it's absolutely amazing! Each character has much depth, many layers of intrigue; with even the most minuscule characters being interesting. I even began to love Damon Damon Salvatore who seemed just like a horrible jerk in the beginning.<br /><br />Elena is an amazing female protagonist that doesn't fall into the damsel in distress category. At least not all that often. She is fiercely independent and not easily pushed around...she has what is called... moxie. She doesn't easily give into the horrors of Stefan's vampirism and is extremely loyal to her friends. She will sacrifice herself if it meant her friends and family being safe.<br /><br />Stefan himself is equally complex. He retains his humanity; determined not to drink human blood, but proves he can be serious and formidable at the same time--depsite his handicap of being the weaker of the of the Salvatore brothers.<br /><br />The story is intriguing, even thought it comes off as a simple vampire human love triangle. It is full of love, familial as well as friend bonds,and many trials.<br /><br />I highly recommend it for those who love the vampire genre and a good story-telling.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|OMG! WOW! Nail bitting, thought provoking, tooth grinding, on the edge of your seat, pulling at your hair trying to figure out who dune.  One clue. It wasn't the butler cause there wasn't one!  Full of suspense from the first sentence to the last page.  I did not see that coming.  Took me on a ride in a rollercoster with no seat belt and without a safety net.  WOW!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|keeps you interested and so many ways to play. pretty good story line. planning to recommend to my friends. good graphics.
B000EHRVP6|1.0|I reviewed Hostel one and two. Both are disgusting beyond description. Some people call them pornographic. They are sadistic and only show men and women of a mentally retarded stage far beyond most peoples imagination. Here is only shown the human trash of todays sick society.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is better I man 100 times better than any fb games. You have with you everywhere you go!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this app is great didn't wanted to download it at first but now I'm addicted really cool good way to pass time if you're bored
0439023513|2.0|Not as good as the first two.  Unimanginative and redundant.  I had to trudge through it for closure.  Really you have to read it just because it's the third book in the trilogy but it is extremely disappointing.
0345803485|5.0|I was unable to put this book down. I remember looking up at the clock and was amazed at how late it was. I was so caught up.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I don't know why adults are reviewing this book from the perspective of co-dependency shown for youngsters to emulate. It is simply a good story depicting a different (not bad!) kind of relationship. The ending kind of fell short for my expectations, but overall I was engrossed in seeing these two people with dark pasts try to make a go of it. Usually the females in these stories are trying to fix the \\"bad boy.\\" Abby doesn't because her past is just as sordid as Travis's.<br /><br />Don't read this if you're looking for more Twilight or a happy love story. Read it with an open mind.
0345803493|5.0|Being a strong woman, who knew that I would get into a book with such a dominate man roll. Again E.L. James kept me glued all the way through this book. What will I read once this series is done :)
B0073XORCY|5.0|With almost 200 reviews already written on this album, it's going to be hard to add anything beyond what has already been mentioned.  With all that said, I HAD to say something.  I was VERY SKEPTICAL going into this.  While I've enjoyed the last few 'real' (maybe original is better term) new Tull releases (Dot Com and Roots to Branches), I had major concerns about this release, primarily due to the deterioration of Ian's voice over the past 2-decades.  I also worried about the music.  Could Ian still write good creative music after all these years?  While a HUGE Tull fan, I am not a big fan of solo Ian Anderson (I am starting just now to appreciate \\"Walk Into The Light\\" now after 20 years!) and since this is really more of a solo effort (given the obvious absence of guitarist Martin Barre), I was very concerned.  As a HUGE fan of 5.1 surround sound and knowing that Steven Wilson (Porcupine Tree) was responsible for the mix, I was as much excited by this prospect as much as anything.  SO...where did I wind up?  I CAN'T GET THIS OUT OF MY CD PLAYER!!!  It's on in my car on the way to/from work, it's playing all night at home, I am so wrapped up in it!  I am listening to old Tull again---not too old, I am listening to Minstrel/Roots/Rock Island.  The new album has elements of all those to me.  I really love it!  I have to say, I did like it the first time I heard it, but even after 20 listens, I still like it more every time I hear it!<br /><br />Here's my take on the 5.1 mix: very, very good (although there are better out there). My issue is not with overall sound which is incredibly crisp, clear and clean sounding.  It's more that, to me, the potential of what 5.1 can do for music is not fully realized with this recording.  I realize I am being a bit picky so let me reiterate...the SOUND IS INCREDIBLE. Steve Wilson (of Porcupine Tree) was chosen to do the 5.1 surround mix for this album.  As you may (or may not know), Steve is no stranger to surround sound.  In addition to having mixed close to 10 of his own recordings (his own solo records and those w/No-Man and Porcupine Tree), he has also recently remixed much of the great King Crimson catalogue (AMAZING stuff you should definitely own if a fan of this audio format), last years poll-topping album 'Heritage' from Opeth (he's done others for them too) and last year's 40th Anniversary edition of Jethro Tull's 'Aqualung' as well (among many, many others).  So well known is SW for the surround sound format, his solo album from last year was nominated for a Grammy for his production work.<br /><br />As a huge fan myself of the format, I find my favorite 5.1 recordings are those where all channels are fully taken advantage of. Many of SW's earlier works are great examples of this style of production.  Unfortunately, from my perspective, of late, Steven Wilson has been of the mind-set to use surround less to \\"wow\\" listeners and more to subtlely enhance the listening experience.  I get that approach, but selfishly, I WANT to be wowed!  I appreciate that this may be controversial but I want to hear instruments spinning around all four speakers.  I want to sit in the middle of something that is full of ear candy!  I was a little disappointed with the 5.1 mix of Aqualung as I didn't think it sounded much different from the stereo version at all.  I realize purists want it as close to original (stereo) as possible---but that's what multiple mixes are for!  Do one that is faithful to the original and then give us a little wizardry!  With all that said, it is still 5 stars for me all the way around...highly, highly enjoyable.  And quite addictive!<br /><br />I hope you have the same experience.  Ian and JT belong in the R&R Hall of Fame...committee members, please open the door for them!!!
1594744769|4.0|I knew the moment I saw the cover of this book that I was going to read it. Then I read the blurb and I was hooked. It was like this book was written for me. On top of the awesomeness I already knew about this book, John Green was a huge supporter of Ransom Rigg's and since I adore John Green, I knew he wouldn't suggest something crappy. Now you know you're truly a book blogger when you have to take \\"breaks\\" from reading your author/publisher requested books to read a book you are actually interested in and purchased yourself. I've been doing really well keeping on my requested books so I decided to reward myself with this novel. I'm SO happy it lived up to my expectations!<br /><br />The Good: Much like the author of this book, I am fascinated by old pictures. It's amazing to try and figure out the history behind the picture and most times, whatever crazy history you give it is often ten times more crazy than the actual real history of it. I know a lot of people were upset that this book wasn't as creepy as the pictures alluded too, but I was actually very impressed with the made up history of the pictures. I thought Riggs created an amazing, wonderful and ALMOST realistic story behind the pictures. I felt like the pictures all related together and there were points when I actually believed the story behind the pictures. I think that the world building was CRAZY awesome in this novel. Riggs is a mastermind writer. Honestly, there was just so much I enjoyed in this novel, I can barely formulate my thoughts. Just read it. You won't be sorry.<br /><br />The Bad: As much as I loved this book, I was a wee bit disappointed with the last half of the book. I thought it fell apart a little bit but it wasn't terrible, just a little disappointing.<br /><br />I give this book a B+!!
1596177373|1.0|I am a huge Tim Burton fan and I was excited to get these cards.  They are of fine quality, but the advertising is deceiving:  There are only 4 Tim Burton images (joker, jack, queen, and king) and it is the same image on each of those cards for the 4 suites.  The number cards have no art on them at all.  I know its just a set of playing cards, but come on, just 4 images?  That's all?

B002QKZLZ6|3.0|This is the second [[ASIN:B002QKZLZ6 Plantronics Carry Case for Voyager Pro/Pro+ Bluetooth Headset]] that I have bought.  It's not because I love them; it's because there are a couple of design flaws of which buyers need to be aware.  First I'll touch on the good and bad, then the details.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* Nice professional design, attractive and non-obtrusive<br />* Reasonable protection for Plantronics Voyager Pro-series headsets<br />* Compact and unobtrusive<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Belt clip leaves it all too easy slip off<br />* Magnet closure opens too easily, headset can fall out<br /><br />Details:<br /><br />As noted above, this is the second of these cases that I've purchased, and this one only because it came as a freebie on a promotion when I purchased my replacement [[ASIN:B0043EV20G Plantronics Voyager PRO+ Bluetooth Headset]].  My earlier one was lost when I was out cycling, and I had the case with the headset clipped to my belt.  I can say that in part this was my own fault, as I had wondered how well the belt clip on the rear would hold, but since I've had such good luck with Plantronics products over the years, I figured that they were better engineers than me.<br /><br />So much for blind faith... and somewhere on a +20 mile bike ride in the late afternoon, the case slipped off of my belt, so I was out one Voyager PRO+ headset and a poorly-engineered case.<br /><br />If you read the other reviews here, you will see that my experiences are not unique, as others have had similar experiences. All things being said, my initial being upset over the loss of the case and headset has subsided over the months that have passed, but I still look at this case very cautiously, and now relegate it to the inside of my computer case or camera bag when the headset is not in use.<br /><br />Any recommendations that I might offer on this would be conditional, and only if the user put it in another bag or case... and be careful, as the magnetic latch opens far too easily. The Voyager PRO+ headset is a good, solid product; it's a shame that its case is not.<br /><br />2/17/2012ch opens far too easily.

1400052173|5.0|Never in my life did I think something as cold and unsentimental as a freezer in a laboratory could make me cry. This is the kind of book that makes you love reading. It gets under your skin and keeps you thinking about it for days after. You will ask everyone you see if they have read it, and you will encourage them to buy it. And I sincerely hope after you read it, when you have been as astounded, moved, touched as I was that you will also go to the Lacks Foundation website and make a donation to honor this woman's incredible story...<br /><br />It's engrossing to the point of keeping you up late to finish. It's a lesson in history that is entirely missing from American schools but gives one of the best contexts for modern race relations I've ever read. It's a fascinating tour of how basic medical research gets done - and how 'science' is more subjective and political than we would like to think. It's a portrait of America at a crossroads, where medicine was pushing the limits of ethics, and society was on the cusp of major social change.<br /><br />In the end, it's simply an extremely well-written, fascinating book that you cannot put down.<br />Buy it.

0307888908|4.0|Some context for my review... I'm about to turn 25, have been very career focused since my sophomore year of college and work in product management for consumer web companies (so far).    This book came out at a great time for me. I've seen a decent amount of success and have generally enjoyed what I've worked on and where I've worked for most of my professional life; something that I know many people can't agree with. Therefore, I know I am fortunate. However, more recently I have begun to question my real purpose, what I'm really good at, and what I really enjoy. I can't help but think that I could do more good for the world and the people in it by focusing my career on something other than what I always have so far. Reids book proposes that everybody do this fairly often with their career and compares it to building products; generally products that are still being defined or in the discovery phase.    He lets you know that it's ok to challenge stereotypical career ladders and to pivot or change directions here or there, just like products or startups often do. I've never been able to stick to a long term road map with any of my web products and similarly there is no reason to believe that it's necessary to create and stick to a 3 year career path. I can leave product management at middle/large size companies (which often becomes project management) and become a product guy at a small startup or try to edge my way into the VC world or take a gap year or try something completely different. Just like products require product discovery and customer discovery, your career deserves reflection and change.    Chapter 6 focused on managing risk and I found that to be the most motivating chapter in the book. One of my favorite quotes was \\"Overestimating threats and avoiding losses may be a fine strategy for achieving evolution's cold mandate to pass our genes on to future generations. But it's not the way to make the most of this life.\\"    I and others have written decentreviews on Quora at [...] and I blogged about it at [...].    Thanks Reid and Ben!

B00729GQ0A|4.0|In her New Adult paranormal/urban fantasy novel, The Forever Girl: Sophia's Journey author Rebecca Hamilton brings a fresh and exciting twist to the classic vampire and shape shifter saga. Sophia Parsons discovers a whole world of immortal creatures exist alongside humans when she attempts to rid herself of the constant static that invades her mind. She casts a spell hoping to quiet the noise, but instead the noise changes into murmurs and whispers that she can't quite understand. Along the way Sophia is thrust into this strange and dangerous cast of characters while trying to rid herself of the family curse causing the noise, including Charles whom she feels an instant connection with. She quickly learns that no one is who she thought they were, and popular myths of witches and vampires have a bit of truth to them.<br /><br />Hamilton definitely did her research for this novel and accurately depicts the Wiccan rituals and beliefs, right down to the discrimination Wiccans face in towns so small that there's no escaping the rumor mill. She also does a wonderful job with the dialogue, and I loved some of the off the cuff remarks made between Sophia and Charles, as well as Sophia's internal thoughts. I quickly began to feel the emotions racing through Sophia, especially when it came to her hesitations in the romance department and the fear of being hurt.<br /><br />The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars, and I wanted to very much, was there were a few times where I wanted to reach through the pages and strangle Sophia and her insecurities. The back and forth waiting to see if Charles and Sophia were going to finally give in to their feelings drove me crazy. It was just a tad much for me, but for fans of romance novels it may not be. There were a few more elements that were a little hard to believe but I can't go into too much detail without giving away spoilers, so suffice it to say that I work with law enforcement during my day job and once or twice things didn't happen as it would in the real world. These are easy to overlook in the scheme of things and didn't ruin the novel for me at all, but felt I had to note it. Overall I loved the book and I cannot wait for the next in the series!
B007IK44CK|3.0|For those of us who didn't see MISSION IMPOSSIBLE: GHOST PROTOCOL on the big screen but bought into the rave reviews that this is the best of all the MI pictures this 4th installment is a big letdown. Brad Bird as director may be part of the problem: his credits prior to this assignment include Up, Ratatouille, The Incredibles, The Iron Giant, The Simpsons, and such like - films that depend on the animation magic they bring to cute stories but somehow don't transfer well to the use of actors in a `serious' film. Writers Josh Appelbaum and Andr&eacute; Nemec based this script very loosely on Bruce Geller's original television series, but in this film they seem to opt more for inserted comedy lines when there is anything vaguely beyond the minimal conversations that occur. The film is like a ship without a sail and headed in a direction full of sidetracks.<br /><br />Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise in a Tom Cruise Production) and his team Jane Carter (Paula Patton), Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and William Brandt (Jeremy Renner) are racing against time to track down a dangerous terrorist named Kurt Hendricks (Michael Nyqvist), who has gained access to Russian nuclear launch codes and is planning a strike on the United States. An attempt by the team to stop him at the Kremlin ends in a disaster, with an explosion causing severe destruction to the Kremlin and the IMF being implicated in the bombing, forcing the President to invoke Ghost Protocol, under which the IMF is disavowed, and will be offered no help or backup in any form. Undaunted, Ethan and his team chase Hendricks to Dubai, and from there to Mumbai, but several spectacular action sequences later, they might still be too late to stop a disaster.<br /><br />It all starts in Budapest with the assassination of Trevor Hanaway (Josh Holloway) by Sabine Moreau (L&eacute;a Seydoux), proceeds to a prison breakout (Ethan Hunt has been imprisoned for killing some Serbian guards), the Russian secrets are discovered, aborted plans lead the team form the Kremlin to Dubai (for Tom Cruise's reportedly self performed scaling of a glass tower) and subsequently to Mumbai and on and on an on for well over two hours. The movie is fast moving and the booms and blowups and car chases and pyrotechnics and absurdly one-sided fights (yes, the girls get to fight and kill each other) manage to keep our attention because of spectacle. There are a couple of moments where we get to learn just a bit about some of the characters an their motivations to be part of this invincible team, but in the end we care very little about any of them as they talk their way through a soupy ending. OK to see on Amazon Instant Video but not a film to own. But that is just one opinion from a viewer who likes story in a movie.

B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I purchased this case after returning a leather case that just added too much weight to my Kindle Fire, which on its own is a bit heavy. This case does just what it says it does. It protects the tablet, weighs practically nothing and, so far, seems well made. It does support the Kindle for viewing (landscape only) but if the designer could figure out how to make it a little more stable it would be appreciated. All in all, I think it's the best case for my needs.

It's the kind of book that you read where you're like \\"Eh, I'll read one more chapter...\\" One more turns into two and then three and so on... You can't put it down. I would stop at times and then glance at the book wondering what would happen next. So, I had to keep going even if my eyes were tired. This book tugs on your heartstrings and fills you with anticipation to get to the end. I'm going to get the second book immediately. I haven't seen the movie yet, but want to. I'd recommend this book to everyone--absolutely magnificent.

0307951529|5.0|First: The $100 Startup is an odd title. Unless your time and computer are worth zero, write the name off to marketing fluff. It costs money and time to get going.<br /><br />Chris has an enjoyable set of narratives from entrepreneurs who have done what he calls `freedom businesses.' You make money doing what you like and have time for the rest of what life has to offer. That fills up the first part.<br /><br />Then there's basically business 101 with an emphasis on virtual products - build-once for low cost, sell a million times for profit, etc. He doesn't subscribe the Lean Startup terminology, but the ideology is baked in.  Nothing earth shatteringly original, but all in all, this is good stuff to know and quick to consume.<br /><br />Nice to see a section on health insurance. It was only 2 pages long and rather lame. The 39 step product launch checklist was great, and five pages. He has 1 footnote nod to Ferris. Would have been nice to see a section on taxes.<br /><br />All-in, it's a decent intro to the world of the DIY careerist.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Being an obsessive Hunger Games fan, I've been drowning myself in young adult dystopian lately, but with all the books coming out of this now popular sub-genre being the same old stale formula and never really living up to the excitement of THG, I just found myself sick of it all. It led me to go searching for what I'd fell in love with when I was, oddly enough, a young adult, which was dystopian fiction that centered around adults.<br /><br />Wool was the highest thing on the Science Fiction and Fantasy best seller list under Game of Thrones, which I've already read a couple times over. I read one review and the allure of a pristine 5-star rating with hundreds of reviews drove me to buy it for my Kindle. I breezed through Wool 1 quickly and found myself stunned at what an amazing read it was and at how quickly I'd come to care about Holsten. After I finished Wool 1, I raved about it to my frustratingly critical husband, who read it and declared it to be \\"very good\\", which I consider rare high praise.<br /><br />Howey continues this intricate weaving of characters in Wool 2-5 and as another reviewer said, you find yourself worried about these fictional characters and hoping that everything turns out okay. You push forward and read because you can't bear not knowing what happens to them. I loved Juliette, but for some reason felt a lot of attachment to Solo. I think I really just found his devotion to survival to be inspiring. I'm glad I picked it up and I'll be following his work and his blog regularly from now on.<br /><br />As I've made my way through the Omnibus edition, I've been yapping to anyone who will listen to me that they have to pick up this book. Once I found out there was a Wool 6, I bought the Kindle version and then bought an autographed copy of it too, since after reading his work, I'm convinced getting his autograph will eventually be not quite so easy as hitting the Paypal button.

0345522478|4.0|Druid? check.  Vampires? check  Gods and Goddesses? check  This book just keeps on adding more outrageous antics and thrills.  What fun.  Seriously.  It's over-the-top as it is meant to be.. and so darn funny.  I laughed out loud through the whole book.  How often does that happen during an action story?  You don't have to be a video-scifi-comicbook lover to enjoy this trilogy.  Im not. Never have been.  But I happened upon them and fell in love.  I read the trilogy recently and I'm waiting for the fourth to be released next week.  A guaranteed good time.  Can't wait. So if you are a scifi/fantasy lover or just happened upon this by chance... go for it.  You won't be disappointed.  As an entertainment expense?  less than $10?  come on.. its hours and hours of great entertainment that you can't get at a movie theater.  enjoy.

B005RJ6AIK|5.0|Having lived in Hawa`i, I had already developed an appreciation for the music of the islands both the old school stuff and the newer more contemporary variety and found this to be an excellent compilation of Hawaiian music. The only artist that was curiously missing is Keali'i Reichel. He was my Hawaiian Studies teacher in Maui and also a very popular recording artist in Hawa`i but the decision of who and who not to include in the sound track doesn't have anything to do with Amazon.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is full of mini games which some are fun but others are a waste of time and you have to play them to get all the games. they don't give you a lot in the beginning to start out with and you need a lot of points to continue. they try to get you to download other games to get more points. fun for it being free
1451627289|5.0|One of the things I wanted to accomplish this year was to read more books. Stephen King has always been one of the more famous author's  that everyone loves. I decided to read one of his books for the first time and bought 11/22/63 from Amazon. Wow! What a book! It was so hard to put down. I carried it everywhere I went. This has to be the best book I've ever read. I will definitely be picking up more Stephen King books in the future. I wish he would do something similar as this for future books! Highly recommend it!
0345803485|1.0|I love books, books are magical, so I decided to give this book a chance. I want to return it, but I got oj on some pages. Maybe I'll make something artsy out of it, like trim the pages into a cool shape and fan it on my wall, but I must paint the cover first because of what it did to my brain. My IQ dropped with every page I turned, I was getting dumber by the pages, so dumb I forgot how to read and didn't, couldn't finish the book. My book collection refuses to let this book in!<br /><br />First of all the main characters are annoying. Ana... my inner goddess bitched slapped her until her hands bled. And what's the guy's name? That Grey guy.... he's a diva, or divo, divo's are not sexy, divo's and diva's are the way they are because of insecurities, insecurity is not sexy. Machismo is not sexy. The sex in the book was not sexy! I've had hotter moments at a cemetery.... true story.<br /><br />I know it's all fiction, but holy orgasms was it far fetched and annoying!!! Did I mention it was annoying..... yes, by the way... it was annoying.<br /><br />Don't buy it. Save your dinero and spend it on something else.... anything else is better.<br /><br />Another thing.... I didn't want to give it the 1 star in the rating. I would give it a quarter of a star just for giggles.
B005COO1X6|1.0|I read King's short stories over twenty years ago, and generally enjoyed them all. I absolutely loved 11/22/63. But Mile 81 is like a B side to a an old 45 record.
0307592731|5.0|Just started this book and I love it. It's real, sincere, honest, harsh, tearful, and I've laughed out loud. Up 'til 2:00 reading it. I love when a book keeps me up until 2:00...
0345803507|5.0|If you like the first two books you'll love this one. It does take a little longer to get going than the first two, but if you can make it half through you will be rewarded. All heck breaks loose, and you see the bond that really have. This is the first one that I teared up in. It was a great book that left me wanting more. I really really hope the surprise at the end of the book is an indiciation that there is more to come from a different point of view.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Enjoyed this book without any preview or recommendation. I'm a woman in mid-40's that enjoys a good legal read with plot twists.  This book did not disappoint. It was an easy read that kept me interested in the characters.  Great ending that left me thinking!
0061537969|5.0|I don't know what it was that got me started on this book but every single time I read a few pages I felt myself smiling more and more. There were times while reading this book written in Enzo the dog's voice that I looked at the wall for support. You will be instantly moved by the dog's heart. Everybody's thought about the saying \\"A Dog is a man's best friend\\" but I fear I will take this opportunity to say that not until this book came around did I give that a true hour of thought. Let me start again. This is a great book written from the eyes and the world of a dog who loves his master, a dog who sees zebras in the form of stuff toys doing mean things when the masters are away, a dog who feels his time to become human has come, a dog who lives with beliefs of what he sees on tv, a dog who never winces for your attention, a clever dog with a lot of self respect who will still down the tastiest bite in the world in one go. Enzo moved me and spoiled me. I miss this book so much because it was so funny and Enzo's space of mine was such a pristine spot that I refuse to think of him as someone not real.<br /><br />Ever since I finished reading \\"THE ART OF RACING THE RAIN\\" I find myself waving to every single dog out there in the world. Whether it a lost dog, whether it's someone's dog, whether it's a friend's dog, I am looking to find Enzo. I have never owned a dog myself but this book truly moved me.<br /><br />I must also give my respect to the author and sadly as much as I can try to convince myself that Enzo actually wrote it was the author who was having conversing with me and not the dog.<br /><br />This is about as good a book as any fiction I have read in the past year or two. I have now downloaded Raveon stole the moon and will finish it one of these months.<br /><br />Read the first chapter and you will feel like reading this book. My suggestion is you take one week to get to know ENZO. Oh I forgot to mention he also has a master who's a very steady race car drive. Oh well.rive. Oh well.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|The very first thing I always think of when I see TTSS is \\"They couldn't get any more names?!!?\\" Wow - what a cast! It's the cream of the crop of English actors. Gary Oldman is superbly subtle as Smiley (he SO deserved that Acadamy Award nomination, and he should have gotten the award.) Benedict Cumberbatch is equally amazing as his right hand man Peter Guillam. I loved every minute of this film, I can not wait to see it again!
0345803485|5.0|I have seen a few different reviews going both ways on this book . I understand its not for everyone, BUT you also have to read the book to understand its not just about the sexual content. There is a story here, and it draws you in, captivating you, making you unable to put the book down. I cant wait for the next 2 books to arrive, to find out how everything turns out. Suggestion.. burn a copy of the soundtrack and listen to the music as you read..  Put yourself in the moment.
B0039PPW60|5.0|SERIOUSLY.  FANTASTIC.  AND IT ARRIVED SUPER EARLY FOR MY BIRTHDAY.  THANKS! IT WORKS GREAT AND i WOULDN'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
B00127RAJY|5.0|OK - so I just finished my first workout on level 1, let me tell you its great. My whole body is feeling it and I can't stop sweating. Just be warned its 20 mins of Non-stop movement with no breaks. I pray that in 30 days I will be 20lbs smaller. I have bad knees and there were a few moves I had to do on my mini trampoline to help me with the impact on my knees (jumping jacks, and jumping rope). If your knees are ok the only things you will need are small hand weights like 3 pound ones and a mat for a hard floor.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|I got this little amp about 3-4 weeks ago, and it was great for that whole time.  Then suddenly, it stopped turning on.  I charge it for ample time, and the amp glows red.  However, once I take it off the charger, it refuses to turn on.  I am pretty disappointed with this..
B000001E7L|3.0|As a huge fan of their debut, I find this one somewhat of a 'disappointment', much like the song of the same name featured herein. There is some great, emotionally resonant stuff here...and the Cranberries' lyrics have never been a strong point, I admit...but even so, the ingenuity of the songwriting and the lush production at times causes the lyrics to come across as childlike and naive in a nostalgic way. So, a lot of people talk about their 'faves' or the 'highlights', but I feel like most of the album is a highlight, so let me discuss a few of the LOWlights. Aside from the awful, plodding, whiny \\"Zombie\\", (which sounds completely out-of-place on this record) my main gripe with this record is the boring-as-church middle. \\"Everything I Said\\", \\"The Icicle Melts\\", and \\"Disappointment\\" are three of the most pointless, anti-climactic, and awkward songs I've ever heard. \\"Everything I Said\\" is particularly embarrassing. It sounds like The Smiths doing a copycat number on morose early 80's Cure, with the most sluggish, weak percussion ever and the most annoying Delores' vocals ever mixed WAY TOO HIGH! She over-emotes like Shatner over-acts! Take away those three songs and \\"Zombie\\" and you've got a great album!
B0058UXHHK|4.0|What a wonderful book! I was pulled into the story from the very first page and could hardly put the book down, finishing it in less than a day. The times when I was forced to put it down to fix dinner and sleep, I found myself wondering about the characters, what they were doing and what would happen next. The characters are rich and relate-able. Ms. Swank has a knack for capturing dialogue in such an easy and realistic way. I believed the characters -- how they acted and reacted, and how they interacted with each other -- and found myself wanting to be friends with many of them. The story made me smile, it made me laugh out loud; there were times I was nervous about what would happen and I even got a little bit misty-eyed at one point.<br /><br />I found the style of the book to be something of Stephanie Plum meets Sookie Stackhouse, but with a twist of sweetness that sets Rose Gardner apart and makes her a unique character.<br /><br />The only reason I gave the book 4 stars instead of 5 is that, in the Kindle edition at least, it needs one more edit to clean up some typos. There were just enough typos to be distracting, but not enough that it took away from the story.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book and will be telling friends about it!
0439023521|2.0|I know I'm in the minority, but I can't like this book or this series.  Frankly, I gave it 2 stars because while I don't like it and there are major flaws, it wasn't horrific, which is what a 1 star book would be for me.    There are alot of reasons I don't like this book/series, and all of them are listed in my in-depth review on my blog    http:[...]    But, here are the highlights:  1. I can't make myself like Katniss.  She is an emotionally distant, cold, almost sociopathic girl with no understanding of the things happening around her.  2. All the other characters are so shallow that they can be summed up in one or two adjectives and it would be the extent of the character in total.  For instance: Peeta is the baker's son who likes to bake, frost cakes, paint, and he loves Katniss for some reason.  And that's it.  That's Peeta.  3. The story was really just a derivative premise and everything else is an attempt to stretch that cool idea (kids killing each other in high tech arenas for the amusement of the rich) into a trilogy.  It felt fake and forced.    So, I know most everyone loves it.  Some have even said that it changed their lives.  For those people, good for you.  I know books have that power.  I have felt similarly at times, but alas, not this time.
0763644765|4.0|This is easily my 17 month old daughter's favorite book. She always wants to read it and I think she's starting to get the idea, pointing at her butt when we read sometimes, etc. I agree with another reviewer that there is not enough detail about wiping and hand washing. Also, maybe this would be gross, but \\"tinkle tinkle toot\\" are hardly explanations for what goes in in the potty. Kids need to SEE the wee and poop in order to know what they're supposed to be doing.<br />But the simple illustrations are great, and the baby and animals seem to fascinate my daughter.
1600243711|5.0|I have attempted to read his other book The choice, it didn't keep me as interested as this one. I hated cheesey love stories but this one was pretty ok. Totally a page turner, finished this book within two days. I am glad this one is being made into a movie.

B000MD7OKY|5.0|Watched again two of the most beautiful people of their entertainment generation. Still as good as when I first saw it. Amazon is a great source of movies like this and access is so easy.
0756405890|5.0|For those like me who go to the reviews because they can't decide whether or not to read a book, please do read this!  I put this book off, scared by the intense negative reviews, but boy did I love this book.    If you're here to see what kind of book this is, the important things to know about this book are:    1. Its in first person narrative, which is not some people's cup of tea.  2. Its kind of slow, but only because its thoughtful and deliberate, rather than a string of action scenes or crises as some fantasy books tend to be.  3. Its not a finished trilogy, yet.  The next book is scheduled to come out next year so, if you're like me and hate waiting, you might want to wait til next year to read this.  4. You won't regret giving this book a chance :)    For a more in depth review, check out my blog  [...]    Don't worry, there aren't any actual spoilers aside from character names!

034552554X|5.0|I loved this book. I thought it was beautifully written and had a very creative take on flowers. I don't necessarily believe that there is one interpretation for flowers but I do enjoyed this book. I do love gardening though so it helped that I had a love and knowledge for the specific plants she mentions. It's so well written that I read it within a few days. I am sorry it is finished.
B007JRUA7K|3.0|This movie was not all that entertaining.  It was pretty sad and mostly showed the dark side of Marilyn's acting prowess.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Everywhere I turned I head about 50 shades. I could not wait to read it and when I was 80% through with the book and I was still waiting for something to happen that would make this book a great book I almost stopped reading but I finished anyway and what a waste. I have no idea why people are freaking out over this book. This is not going to \\"transform any sex lives\\" nothing even THAT crazy happened. The same phrases were repeated so often I started rolling my eyes at the book. I really would love to know why people are loving this book!
1451683405|3.0|Philosophers debating free will have long understood that the term can be used in many ways, most of which are incoherent. Thus, advocates of \\"libertarian free will\\" (founded on the belief that free will requires indeterminism) have had to face the objection that indeterminate events in the brain would be expected to produce randomness, not freedom. And advocates of \\"compatibilist free will\\" (founded on the belief that some kinds of free will are compatible with determinism) have had to face other problems, including the one that many people find compatibilism intuitively implausible. Despite these difficulties, most leading philosophers (with a few important exceptions such as Galen Strawson, Derk Pereboom and Ted Honderich), have come to the conclusion that, if used cautiously, the term \\"free will\\" can be applied to human beings in a coherent, meaningful and true manner. One of the hard-won achievements of this 200 year old debate has been to separate out conceptions of free will that have a good chance of being coherent and even true, from those that are incoherent or probably untrue. It has been clear to all for many years that unsophisticated conceptions of free will are unlikely to stand up to philosophical analysis.    This 66 page text makes little attempt to contribute to the modern debate, but rather takes the easy option of attacking \\"the popular conception of free will\\" which, according to Harris \\"seems to rest on two assumptions: (1) that each of us could have behaved differently than we did in the past, and (2) that we are the conscious source of most of our thoughts and actions in the present\\". Of course, this popular conception gets a thrashing, because assumption (1) is ambiguous and assumption (2) is simplistic.    Whether this conception is really popular is debatable. There has been research on what ordinary people believe about free will, and popular beliefs actually seem to be rather varied [...], but let us suppose that at least some people have a conception of free will resembling the one Harris attacks. For such people, the book may be useful. It is certainly much easier to read than the works of serious philosophers.    Harris has not refuted free will, but has mounted a ferocious attack on one rather naïve version of it. He doesn't seriously grapple with modern scholarship. Admittedly, he does briefly discuss two short texts from compatibilist philosophers Tom Clark and Eddy Nahmias. He merely dismisses libertarianism as not being \\"respectable\\" (page 16). He wins a cheap victory. Why should anybody be surprised if an unsophisticated \\"popular\\" view of free will can be knocked down?    If this easy-to-read 66 page tract stimulates people into reading more serious works on free will, this will be of value (they might start with Robert Kane, Daniel Dennett and Alfred Mele). If it lulls people into thinking that the problem is solved and free will does not exist, it may be a victory for obscurantism.
159102594X|4.0|This books starts out a series that is a very interesting look at human nature.  The big question in this series is \\"Who is a hero?\\"  The answer is, unfortunately, \\"Nobody\\".    This series is worth the read for those really into the fantasy genre.  At times, I think of it as an inside joke for those deep into the genre.  Abercrombie specifically sets out to take the cliche and tropes found in fantasy and turn them on their heads.    I'm not saying those new to the genre won't like it.  Far from it.  This would actually be a very interesting introduction, and one that is certainly a step above alot of others out there.    If you're asking the reviewers, \\"should I read it?\\"  I say, \\"yes\\". I go into more depth about my reasons and critiques on my blog:  [...]    Don't worry, there aren't any actual spoilers on there :)
B000HOMU98|5.0|I am not a member of the military or ever will be but when I think of what it was like to be in the marines in that era I see this movie as being pretty close to the truth. Just a little glorified but still the training sequence is probably the funniest and most dramatic sequence of a film I have ever seen combined. I have never had a Vietnam war era film entertain me all the way through like this one did.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game fun silly total waste of time!! wish I had more help with all the work.  play smart friend

0756407125|5.0|This book seamlessly picks up from the first, [[ASIN:0756405890 The Name of the Wind (Kingkiller Chronicles, Day 1)]]    It was a great read that very nicely progresses both the characters and the story.  This isn't a fast paced action book, so it can get a little slow at times, but I never minded that in the least.  I was pleasantly surprised at times, moved at others, and intensely curious at others.  All in all, it was a book that kept me reading and thinking about reading when I wasn't able to.  I just can't wait for the third installment!    For a more in depth review on this and other fantasy books, check out my blog:    (...)    Don't worry, it doesn't actually have any spoilers :)
B000069AUI|5.0|I have found myself liking coldplay more and more lately. This album is one of those albums that you don't care for much when you first listen to it but if you put it on the radio and just do your thing it creates a good vibe and is just overall a great work. If you haven't heard of this album you have probably been living under a rock or have been a prisoner of war in a foreign country for the last ten years and in that case welcome home!

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is really fun but it is very time consuming. The game is also kinda su&ccedil;kish because of the energy feature. But overall it was a good buy and it is free.

0062112430|5.0|I have to say that I'm quickly becoming one of Lauren Oliver's fans.  She does write for the young reader; but there is something in her books for all generations.  Her books quickly grab and bring you in to the book, wrapping your mind and thoughts around her story line and subject matter.  Her writing is thought provoking and makes a reader simply want to read and read until the book is completed and then want more.<br /><br />Although I don't find her books especially delightful and uplifting, which they aren't meant to be, I do find them thought provoking and challenging.  Overall, I definitely think this one meets the mark!  Can't wait until the third book in the series is out!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I like the game just wish there was more mini games but like that you can earn acorns without having to only pay for them like most other games.

B007CMD5AQ|5.0|I enjoyed Halestorm's debut album, but The Strange Case Of... blows it away. There isn't one song I hate enough to skip and there is about a 70% hard rock to 30% ballad ratio here. The first four songs alone should rock your world.<br /><br />Lzzy Hale is a mix of Joan Jett and Lita Ford. She's by far the superior singer of the three, though Lita has her beat on lead guitar of course. Just check out the video for \\"Love Bites (So Do I)\\" on that \\"video sharing\\" site and see what I mean. A hot chick with attitude. The rest of the band holds their own as well, especially Lzzy's brother on the drums.<br /><br />The song lyrics range from fun to sexy. Nothing too deep, but they are a whole lotta fun to sing along to.<br /><br />So...<br /><br />If you like rock with heavy riffs, a few ballads thrown in the middle for balance, melodic song structures and a female singer who is in my mind one of the best rock vocalists working today, buy this album now. I bought the deluxe version because it includes three bonus tracks.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Nice game, relaxing and fun! good background music as well. Nice game, relaxing and fun! good background music as well.
B007H7XJD4|1.0|I bought the full version of this movie due to me thinking that I'd want to see it again, but in reality I never saw it to begin with.  The movie was edited so dark that I never really knew what was going on -- I basically had to listen to the movie to try and get some grip on the storyline.  It literally was not a viewable movie.<br /><br />Speaking of storyline, where was it?  There were so many loose-ends, no character progression, and what little of either was scattered across the movie had no logical foreshadowing or climax to begin with.  I'm a pretty big history buff, I know the story of Theseus and while I won't compare anything to the original myths - If you don't know the story, you probably won't understand WTF is going on. At All.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I loved the books and was prepared to be disappointed in the tv series, but  OMG!!! Peter Dinklage totally blew me away with his preformance as Tyrion Lannister.  He may be small in stature, but he is an absolute giant as as actor.  He carried this series for me.  I cannot wait to get the next season.  Whatever else you may think of the way this was brought to the screen, it is completely worth it just to see this man act.  I haven't been this impressed with anyone since I saw Al Pacino's Merchant of Venice.  Peter Dinklage is magnificent.
B005GVA2L0|5.0|I've seen some lackluster reviews for this album, but I can't agree. Several standout tracks: \\"My Heart is Broken\\", with characteristically phenomenal Amy Lee vocals; \\"the Other Side\\", and \\"Oceans\\". Overall, a great effort from an incredible band. Waiting enthusiastically for the next album!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|so far so good, its a throw back version of marios bro, get it for your self if you like or have an annoying kid you want to calm or shut :-)
B001BO184Q|5.0|I read the above review and I don't know why I am amazed by the amount of negativity in these reviews.  I have, a couple of times, almost not bought items here because of reviews like the above.  Well, there is good stuff to be had in this box of Puccini Operas.  I see this as part of the Golden Age of Opera when the labels were recording them as fast as they could because the LP had replaced the 78's many, many discs for one work. (I was only 9 y.o at the time of this recording.) Maybe the sound quality isn't what it is now but we have those wonderful voices preserved. They will never be replaced!.  In Butterfly, you have de los Angeles, Bjoerling, Sereni leading the cast.  I have never been so moved 10 minutes into the first act as I was in this recording.  I have heard the Pavarotti/Karajan recording, I prefer this one(EMI).  I think people should just give this set a chance.  I think you will be surprised.  Trust yourself and buy what you like.
0307956350|3.0|Probably a good story but the time line is so screwed up that it is hard to tell where you are.  The author jumps back and forth too much.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I was really skeptical of this game when my boyfriend told me about it, but once he taught me how to play & I played it with him & his sister I fell in love with this game. It has the property building aspect of Monopoly which I like along with the conquering territory aspect of Risk and the resource gathering and Management of the computer game Age of Empires.<br /><br />The game is the perfect mix of strategy and luck, with the dice controling your resource inflow and your strategy affecting what you have to build with.<br /><br />It's a great game (haven't tried playing 2 player yet but its so much fun with 3 people) and I've just ordered a copy for myself as well as the 5-6 player expansion because I want to be able to have my whole family play at the same time (it's 4 player and I have 5 people in my family).<br /><br />I have high hopes for the expansion to this game and I would recommend this game for any boardgame lovers

Sparks book I have read, due largly to the fact that Im not into overly melodramatic romances, but I thought since the trailer for the movie (as of this review it hasnt come to the theater yet) looked good Id give the book a shot first. Blah. They talk and talk and hang out with the kid and talk some more. They eat crabs and dance. The romance is as flat as the pages it is written on.<br /><br />Not much unresolved sexual tension, lingering glances, hot sweaty muscles etcetcetc. Beth is a late 20's single mother who hasnt been laid in forever, yet there is ONE SENTENCE spent on how shes looking at his abs????  If this man looks like Zac Efron, whole chapters should be devoted to his mouth-wateringly sexy body, face, hair, eyes....<br /><br />For example, in the movie trailer we see Beth looking out the window at a hot, sweaty georgous man lifting heavy things, his muscles glistening in the sun and we can feel her lusting after him. In this novel, we get that he \\"unloads some dog food from the back of the truck\\". uh, snooze. In the trailer, she basically attacks him under some running water and they eat each other's face off. HOOOOOOTTTT. In the book she listens to him talk and he listens to her talk, over and over talking and talking until they make love in one paragraph. REALLY???? SIGH.<br /><br />I think Zac Efron is amazingly sexy and hope they bring more heat in the movie than this lukewarm book offers. Im not sure what type of person reads N. Sparks novels, but this was just wayyy too tame for me.

B007SYWFRM|5.0|its a cool build a city game. the pace is faster than most and the characters are fun. I like the movie and the characters are funny. good game.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This movie is very well done.  Grabs your attention first thing in the beginning scene.  Touches an array of emotions, keeps you either laughing or crying.  The humor is talented and wholesome.  The message is full of hope in the midst of a uncertain world.  I would highly recommend this movie.  I not only bought one for our own library but one to share with others!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game so much because it is so cool and the games are funny because it is hilarious.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are fine. I just wish that there was more. some of them I stink at. the games need to improve some.
B007UXSDYU|1.0|This movie starts OK, and gets a little better as things go on to a point. Then it's obvious the writer had no idea what to do after that and then the movie devolves into your stereo typical survivor horror story. Why people stand around letting one or two others rape and torture when they can just subdue the crazy ones makes no sense. I assume it was the Directors failed attempt to shock the audience instead of answering questions about the original attackers of the City.
B007JUWM64|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, though I was not compelled to complete watching the movie in one sitting.  I finsihed it after a few sittings and felt it was about average.
B003L77GGK|5.0|I have every season of supernatural. Season 1-5 i have purchased out of stores and payed between $40.00- $70.00. I just discovered amazon and saved alot of money on season 6. The quality is the same as buying from a store. I will now only buy dvds from amazon I had not one problem. very happy with my purchase.
B007H7XJD4|5.0|I was a little hesitant about watching this one at first but that was put to ease within the first 5 minutes of watching. Great story line full of action, I would defiantly recommend watching or even buying this one. I will be watching it again soon.
B007UXSPK2|3.0|All the elements of a Mission Impossible (MI) are there but for some reason, this one seemed to lack a certain snap for me. Felt scripted to me. I know, all films are scripted but this one had that, lull between \\"events\\", special effects, feel to it. Oh, this one is Ok but nothing special and I still like the first MI film the best. When only an action film will do and nothing better to watch.

B0071MV540|2.0|My husband and I rented this thinking it would be funny. Well it wasn't.. With this kind of cast we should have been laughing every five minutes. I don't think either one of us cracked a smile the whole time :(  the movie felt very long and played out very slowly.
B006ON41FC|3.0|For those who like competition this game is for them. The only problem is that the turn radius in the control is kinda pitiful.
0553386794|1.0|I'm rating this a one as a service to people who have not yet read it.<br /><br />I've been reading this series since the original publication in 1997, impatiently awaiting its completion with the third novel in the planned trilogy, which turned out to be book 3 of a series of at least 6 books (book 5 is not the end!!!).  Book 2 didn't appear until 2002, book 3 in 2003, book 4 in 2007, and book 5 in 2011.<br /><br />Is it unreasonable to expect an author to have a plan for a book and follow it?  Martin has clearly gotten lost somewhere in the land of imagination and can't get out.<br /><br />Don't get started, you'll regret it if you do.<br /><br />On the other hand, it's a great story, great characters, and I can't wait until the next in the series.  But since I'm 66 years old, I'll probably be dead before he finishes.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love this game. I had bought the larger solitary pack for the free cell game and liked it but the classic solitary wasn't what I wanted so I bought this one and haven't had a problem in six months
B007SYWFRM|5.0|cool game. very cute. like that its fast paced. like the short movie. kids love it. make more like this one
B007SSDS24|4.0|This movie was not as bad as it was stated in the 1 star reviews. It did not have a big Hollywood budget to start with. Yes, the plot is not great, the acting is okay, the visuals are acceptable. The ending could be better. It was too simple. However, it kept me entertained for 120 minutes.
B007BLDFWG|2.0|I must have very different tastes than most others, but I just plain didn't enjoy this film.  Strange, sudden ending to which I couldn't determine the significance.
B004UHSB5A|4.0|This app is helpful when I have a short delay and need something to do without getting very involved in a game. Was hoping it would be good for kids, but they don't seem as interested in this since there's not as many graphics as some other games. Like it and would recommend if you like playing dominoes.
B007SYWFRM|3.0|it is good for a free game, although there isnt much of a point or goal to the storyline? develop more interwoven goals in the game.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|its great so many fun games. if your bored you can just play it I love it and play it all the time
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Contemporary film with action, love-interest, drama, lots of humor and real family entertainment.  A truthful look at the 'good guys' who have employees who break the law as well as redemption for those criminals who are willing to change.  A good cross-section of society shown working toward a common goal.
B005EGXTEE|4.0|I was looking for a good book to read and thought I would give this a try with the movie release coming up. I had no expectations going in, so I was pleasantly surprised with the result. The plot was full of twists and turns and the author did a great job of helping me get to know Katniss. Unfortunately it a was a little too good as I immediately downloaded the 2nd and 3rd books of the trilogy and proceeded through the week on minimal sleep. Highly recommended.

0440243688|4.0|\\"Gone Tomorrow,\\" by New York Times bestselling author Lee Child, is the lucky 13th in his Jack Reacher thriller series, coming after [[ASIN:044024367X Nothing to Lose]].<br /><br />The book opens early one morning in New York, New York, on a nearly empty Manhattan subway car, the number 6 Lexington Avenue Local. There are only five other passengers.  And Reacher, a former army MP notices the fifth, a woman he suspects is a suicide bomber, because she matches all eleven criteria on the list for women developed by Israeli intelligence to predict such things.  A list that was widely disseminated and studied after 9/11.  Her name is Susan Mark, and she appears to be an ordinary woman, working an ordinary job in personnel at the U. S. Defense Department in Washington, D.C.  And once she was.  But she now holds a secret that's way too big for her, and is actually being watched by interested parties in D.C., and abroad.  Reacher doesn't know whether to confront her or not: as the train approaches Grand Central Station, a major hub, he finally does, as so many lives could be at risk. The deadly result sets him on a hunt that seems to go back to the misguided 1980s Soviet war in Afghanistan and forward with the war on terrorism.<br /><br />Child certainly writes a mean, tight thriller, as everyone says.  I've never actually read him before; read this one with my mystery book club.  His dialog and narrative are fine, plot reasonably complex, though Reacher did strike me as, shall we say, an overachiever. The sex scene felt obligatory, and perhaps it was.  Never mind, I kept turning the pages.  Particularly enjoyed all the New York detail, as I was born there and spent most of my life there: it all seemed remarkably accurate to me considering that Child is British-born.  Was a little unhappy for a while, as it appeared that Child was heading towards yet another tale of naughty high jinks among high Washington muckety-mucks, a plot device wildly overused by thriller writers the last several years.  But the author avoided that hoary device quiet handily, by setting forth that the federal interest in Reacher was simply a result of what I consider an acceptable desire to keep the lid on some of their less appetizing past actions, and their mistake in sending a B team to a game in which the opposition had sent a sizable A team.  Was also a little unhappy about Child's quick stepping evasion of ever quite telling his readers what exactly his macguffin was, to borrow Alfred Hitchcock's useful word: that which sets a mystery plot in motion, and keeps the players scrambling.  Mind you, the writer had established an ingenious, likely one, but then it somehow got lost in translation: that's a no-no to me.<br /><br />The author, a former television director now resident in New York, is the #1 internationally bestselling author of the Reacher thriller series that  includes the New York Times bestsellers [[ASIN:0440245990 The Enemy: A Reacher Novel]], [[ASIN:0440246075 One Shot: A Reacher Novel ]], [[ASIN:0440246008 The Hard Way: A Reacher Novel ]], and the #1 bestselling [[ASIN:0440246016 Bad Luck and Trouble: A Reacher Novel ]] and NOTHING TO LOSE. His debut,[[ASIN:B002G7UKBO Killing Floor ]], won both the Anthony and the Barry awards for Best First Mystery, and THE ENEMY won both the Barry and the Nero awards for Best Novel. Based on this first taste of his work, I sure would be happy to try him again.last several years.

030758836X|5.0|Gone Girl is about the disappearance of Amy Dunne. She was apparently abducted on the morning of her fifth anniversary. Her husband, Nick, is of course a prime suspect (isn't it always the husband?). But even though half of the chapters are told from Nick's perspective, you just can't make up your mind if he's guilty or not.  There's definitely something \\"off\\" about him.  And he does say that he is good at half-truths.  And the marriage was on the rocks.  So.... guilty or not?<br /><br />I can't say more without giving too much away.  But I will say that this is one of the best dark psychological thrillers I've ever read.  And easily the best \\"unreliable narrator\\".  Highly recommended.

0375842209|3.0|I was recommended this by at least two people, and while I thought the book was decent, I was surprised at the abundance of 5 stars on this site.<br /><br />To clarify, just a list of pros and cons-<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Interesting style with the many subheadings and authorial intrusions/interjections<br />Some absolutely beautiful description/imagery - particularly when it's the narrator speaking about his own experiences and views (i.e. not telling us the story)<br />Really really powerful in eliciting your emotions<br />Some light humour<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Much too lengthy<br />- There were many story arcs which I found unnecessary or a little drawn-out - some even boring (like the Mayor's wife and her library)<br />Yet, ironically, I thought the pace was much too quick as well<br />- Suffered from the 'Dan Brown' writing where each chapter is extremely short and subsequently insubstantial (although sometimes its brevity worked!)<br />Repetitive regarding certain things (nightmares, 'feather hair')<br />Slightly unbelieveable characters<br />- This is further explored in the next point...<br />Too much sentimentality/cuteness<br />- This is to me the biggest flaw of the book. It is much too cute. Although it is understandable that Liesel would harbour such powerful feelings of love towards her adopted father (as she is an orphan), wading through repetitive paragraphs detailing his 'silver eyes' and his altruism was a little tiresome. Similarly, Liesel's relationship with Max was much too sappy. At times I found myself questioning whether the characters would really do what they do; whilst their gestures was sweet, it was overblown.<br /><br />The latter point felt like Zusak was really just trying to win you over through the sweet, cutesy, parental relationships between Liesel and these two men than with anything else.<br /><br />One last one:<br />Whilst the authorial intrusions are pretty stylish, they quickly become disruptive and break the flow of reading. Became vaguely irritating.<br /><br />The book was good. It wasn't fantastic, and I certainly did not find it as spectacular as my friends had claimed, but it was good. In retrospect, however, there are too many cons - stylistically and story-wise - which weigh this from being something fantastic (which Zusak attains at a few points in the novel).

B001E75QH0|5.0|Words cannot do justice on my love for the Indiana Jones movies.<br /><br />It all started back when I was 7. It was the era of the VCR, the VHS tapes and when digital cameras were in its larval stage. Me and my father watched many movies on VCR, movies like E.T., Rambo, Dirty Harry, Jurassic Park, Commando, Star Wars, Gorgo and the Godzilla movies. One day, my father and I watched Raiders of the Lost Ark. It was my main introduction to Indiana Jones, the macho archaeologist whose search for artifacts of immense value were just an excuse to see Indy outsmart and defeat those evil Nazis and other forces trying to put him down. To say it had an impact on me is an understatement; rarely did I watch a movie that had me laughing and smiling at what was happening on screen. The scene where Indy shoots down that evil Arabic minion with a sword still resonates with me today as it did 17 years ago. After the movie was over, I found out that two more Indiana Jones movies were made: Temple of Doom (1984) and the Last Crusade (1989). Those movies were the best place to go when I was tired from school and wanted to do something with myself for the time being.<br /><br />Now, me and everybody else who grew up watching the Indiana Jones movies can relive those memories in this great box-set, that also includes the unfairly maligned Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008). This box set is an action fan's nirvana; each of them containing non-stop action that feels exhilarating rather than tiring, comic relief that actually provides laughs and, of course, the man with the hat and whip.<br /><br />1. [[ASIN:B0014Z4OMU Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark (Special Edition) (1981)]]<br /><br />I can write numerous paragraphs on the history, impact and greatness of Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first installment of the Indiana Jones trilogy. But that can wait another day. Steven Spielberg was still reeling from the box-office disappointment of 1941 (1979). 1941 came out at a time when bloated epics like Sorcerer (1979), New York, New York (1977), At Long Last Love (1975), Popeye (1980) and, the epitome of directional excess, Heaven's Gate (1980) were box-office disasters due to their uncontrollable budget, sloppy screenwriting and its directors' strive for artistic perfection and ruined many careers (with the exception of Scorsese, who made Raging Bull afterwards). Spielberg needed a hit to prove his legitimacy in the eyes of Hollywood and, most importantly, the public.<br /><br />So one day, Spielberg and his pal George Lucas (who recently made Star Wars) developed a character that was to be a cross between James Bond and Fred C. Dobbs from The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948). Spielberg had always wanted to make a James Bond movie but Lucas added the intrigue by not only putting Bond into a world of 30's era Saturday morning matinee adventures but by turning Bond into an archaeologist. The result was Indiana Jones. To cast Jones, the two filmmakers originally wanted Tom Selleck to play the role but eventually, that part went to Harrison Ford. The rest was history.<br /><br />Raiders of the Lost Ark is the work of two great filmmakers at the peak of their creative powers, making a movie that is having fun with defying expectations, adding new twists to a dated formula and making the audience have the time of their lives. The opening segment where Indy has to retrieve a golden idol head, only to be chased by booby traps and that dreaded boulder, emphasizes the movie's raw appeal. As if to dare to top one action scene after another, Lucas, Spielberg and Ford adds exciting chases (the truck chase where Indy tries to get the Ark is a classic), entertaining fist fights and an ending where the Nazis get it the hard way. Some people have complained that the movie doesn't give the audience time to breathe but that's the point. Raiders is an exhilarating ride, not an art-house movie talking about existentialism.<br /><br />But this ride would have no soul or heart if it wasn't for the characters and the excellent acting. Harrison Ford really made Indy his own character; tough, obsessive in his search but also mocking his own machismo behaivor. It's hard to imagine Tom Selleck in this role before Ford came on board. As Belloq, Paul Freeman makes a slimy but genuinely intelligent rival to Indy, particularly where he lets Indy do all the dirty work, only to come back and snatching something that Indy can possess that Belloq himself can obtain. Karen Allen is wonderfully spirited as Indy's spunky love interest Marion and John Rhys-Davies (in his pre-Gimli days), Ronald Lacey and Denholm Elliott provide excellent performances in their supporting roles. The box-office revenue was well-deserved as audiences rightly ignored those curmudgeon critics and made this one of the top-grossing movies of all time.<br /><br />2. [[ASIN:B0014Z4ON4 Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (Special Edition) (1984)]]<br /><br />Before Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, Temple of Doom was often considered the weakest of all Indiana Jones movies. Out of all the Indiana Jones movies, Doom is regarded as the darkest and (to some people) the most mean-spirited due to its shocking violence (the heart-ripping scene...I shall say no more), annoying heroine (played by future Spielberg wife Kate Capshaw) scare factor and its patronizing attitude towards Indians, a fair assessment but then again, many Saturday matinee cliffhangers were not exactly politically correct, either. It is a combination of these factors, plus the release of Gremlins (1984), that led to the idea of a PG-13 rating by the MPAA.<br /><br />Yet, with the exception of its \\"racism\\" towards Indians, Temple of Doom deserves a re-evaluation on its negative aspects that are actually considered the reasons why this movie works. Spielberg plunges into the darkness and shows us the ugly side of his archaeological hero, having Indy and his pals Capshaw and Short Round, play by Goonies actor Ke Huy Quan, confront Chinese gangsters, hideous bugs, spiked ceilings caving in, voodoo magicians, a fragile bridge and man-eating crocodiles. But to talk about the dark aspect is to say that Doom is depressing. On the contrary, Doom is actually funnier and wittier than its predecessor. The scene where Indy and his friends are forced to eat a dinner of bugs, monkey brains, eels within giant snakes and a soup of eyeballs may have been too gross for audiences' taste but in Spielberg's hands, it comes across as boldly hilarious rather than appallingly tasteless.<br /><br />And like Raiders, Doom moves at a brisk, electric pace, making the action more exciting and the comedy funnier. The mine cart chase near the end ranks as one of the most exciting set-pieces in all the Indiana Jones movies and epitomizes the movie's appeal: bold, scary, maybe violent but still fun, enjoyable and one hell of a ride to go back on.<br /><br />3. [[ASIN:B0014C2FX8 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (Special Edition) (1989)]]<br /><br />Regretting the darkness of Temple of Doom, Steven Spielberg and George Lucas went back to the lighter approach of Raiders with The Last Crusade. Not only do Spielberg and Lucas begin the movie with a prologue depicting Indy as a youngster but they also bring in Mr. Bond himself, Sean Connery, as Ford's father. In addition, Davies and Elliott, who were mere supporting players in Raiders, are brought back and given more substantial roles. Even the Nazis have returned as the primary villains, with Hitler making a memorable cameo appearance.<br /><br />Instead of making Crusade feel recycled and hackneyed, it actually makes the movie feel bittersweet and even melancholic, as the fact that this was going to be the final Indy movie (at the time, at least) was obvious. The final scene where the four main characters ride off to the sunset makes Last Crusade feel more like an elegiac western straight out of Shane (1953) and The Searchers (1956) than something outof James Bond movie. But enough about contemplating sadness.<br /><br />Is this just as exciting as the previous Indy movies? Hell yes. The motorcycle chase that occurs after Indy rescues his father at a Nazi compound is first-rate, as are scenes where Indy and his companion Elsa voyage under the rat-infested sewers of Venice before attempting to outsmart their enemies in a thrilling boat chase. But what's an Indiana Jones without a wit? Take, for example, the scene where Connery scares off a flock of seagulls to crash a German plane into oblivion. It is one of the wittiest ways to defeat an imposing enemy ever depicted on celluloid.<br /><br />Speaking of Connery, it is his chemistry with Ford that is the heart of the picture. From their first meeting onward, Ford and Connery cut the father-and-son relationship deep, making their bond more palpable when Indy is forced to go through a ritual to \\"choose wisely\\" the one cup that will save his father's lives. Given the father-and-son relationship, it's little wonder why many fathers and uncles prefer The Last Crusade as their favorite Indiana Jones movie. The final scenes where Ford addresses Connery as \\"Yes, sir\\" as the main characters ride off to the sunset establishes the kind of genuine emotion that only Spielberg could achieve and illustrates why this trilogy is a breed apart from all the other mindless anthologies that favor explosions over expositions.<br /><br />So that completes the Indiana Jones trilogy...<br /><br />Oh, wait a minute. That's right.<br /><br />We have one more business to take care of.<br /><br />4. [[ASIN:B00005JPO1 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Two-Disc Special Edition) (2008)]]<br /><br />Few series installments are as utterly reviled by die-hard fans as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull. Released in 2008, Crystal Skull has become the object of derision and parody by a majority of people, including the creators of South Park. But the reasons that this movie are hated range from vague to downright absurd. But we'll dissect it anyway and then I'll offer a defense to the movie's \\"shortcomings\\".<br /><br />1.) The movie is too silly, too unrealistic, the \\"nuke the fridge\\" scene standing out as the example of this. Right. And a scene in Temple of Doom where a guy is still breathing after having his heart ripped out is so much MORE realistic. And while we're at it, let's talk about how, in the beginning of Raiders, Indiana Jones just so happens to run into his friend's seaplane after going on a lengthy journey (with a foreign crew, I should mention) to pursue the golden idol.

Harrison Ford is too old to play the part.

Speaking of 1950's:<br /><br />3.) There's ALIENS in an Indiana Jones movie and the main villains are Russian. Given the fact that this movie is set in the 50's, the decade of the communist witch hunt, the Cold War and the fact that it was the golden age of science-fiction cinema like War of the Worlds (1953), Forbidden Planet (1956), The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Invaders from Mars (1953), you would think these people would not make a hissy-fit about it. But even if this were set in the 40's, it still wouldn't matter because the Saturday matinee serials and adventures that inspired Indiana Jones also covered science-fiction, jungle adventures and espionage. So to say that Crystal Skull disrespects the Indiana Jones name because it features aliens is wrong, considering the origin of the movies and the aspects of that origin.<br /><br />And 4.) This movie has CGI. Probably the only critique that I would consider valid but if you're really that nit-picking over a few special effects shots, I feel very sorry for you.<br /><br />As for the movie itself, the movie no way holds a candle to the three previous installments but on its own, it's very good and enjoyable to watch. The acting and action scenes are solid and Spielberg's use of framing and camera angles have very few peers. A much more serious shortcoming is that the movie drags in the middle section and that Blanchett is way over-the-top, compared to the villains in the previous movies. But even with such quibbles, Kingdom of Crystal Skull is a very good, if not great Indy installment that deserves better than to be recognized as a target of some idiotic Comedy Central cartoon.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br /><br />No serious movie fan would be complete without the four Indiana Jones movies (or three if you hate Indy 4 that much). To have them on a slim thinpak with great picture and audio quality makes this treasure to re-watch again and again. When it comes to Indiana Jones movies, there's no better place to discover some \\"fortune and glory\\".<br /><br />Strongest recommendation.of James Bond movie. But enough about contemplating sadness.<br /><br />Is this just as exciting as the previous Indy movies? Hell yes. The motorcycle chase that occurs after Indy rescues his father at a Nazi compound is first-rate, as are scenes where Indy and his companion Elsa voyage under the rat-infested sewers of Venice before attempting to outsmart their enemies in a thrilling boat chase. But what's an Indiana Jones without a wit? Take, for example, the scene where Connery scares off a flock of seagulls to crash a German plane into oblivion. It is one of the wittiest ways to defeat an imposing enemy ever depicted on celluloid.<br /><br />Speaking of Connery, it is his chemistry with Ford that is the heart of the picture. From their first meeting onward, Ford and Connery cut the father-and-son relationship deep, making their bond more palpable when Indy is forced to go through a ritual to \\"choose wisely\\" the one cup that will save his father's lives. Given the father-and-son relationship, it's little wonder why many fathers and uncles prefer The Last Crusade as their favorite Indiana Jones movie. The final scenes where Ford addresses Connery as \\"Yes, sir\\" as the main characters ride off to the sunset establishes the kind of genuine emotion that only Spielberg could achieve and illustrates why this trilogy is a breed apart from all the other mindless anthologies that favor explosions over expositions.<br /><br />So that completes the Indiana Jones trilogy...<br /><br />Oh, wait a minute. That's right.<br /><br />We have one more business to take care of.<br /><br />4. [[ASIN:B00005JPO1 Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (Two-Disc Special Edition) (2008)]]<br /><br />Few series installments are as utterly reviled by die-hard fans as Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of Crystal Skull. Released in 2008, Crystal Skull has become the object of derision and parody by a majority of people, including the creators of South Park. But the reasons that this movie are hated range from vague to downright absurd. But we'll dissect it anyway and then I'll offer a defense to the movie's \\"shortcomings\\".<br /><br />1.) The movie is too silly, too unrealistic, the \\"nuke the fridge\\" scene standing out as the example of this. Right. And a scene in Temple of Doom where a guy is still breathing after having his heart ripped out is so much MORE realistic. And while we're at it, let's talk about how, in the beginning of Raiders, Indiana Jones just so happens to run into his friend's seaplane after going on a lengthy journey (with a foreign crew, I should mention) to pursue the golden idol.

B004H83IG4|1.0|This is a really terrible movie.  Let me describe it by splitting the film into two sections.  Let me explain the first half first.<br /><br />The first half of the movie is totally fitting for the Lifetime Movie Network.  It's about a woman who lives in an apartment building and, while a man is fixing a plumbing problem under her kitchen sink,  they fall in love.  Little does she know the man who has a history of mental illness.  Well she DOES eventually realize this but not until she's already committed to the guy.<br /><br />Let me state that what the guy does for a living is completely meaningless.  He works in real estate and it's a family business, hence the constant sarcastic bickering between him and his father about \\"making the right choices for the sake of the family\\".  None of this matters though.  The focus here is on the man and woman attempting to hit off a relationship.<br /><br />Well for the entire first half of the movie, the man and woman go through the routine ups and downs of being in a relationship, however since the man has a mental condition due to him having to tragically witness his mother jumping and killing herself when he was a child, this problem interferes with his ability to want to have kids with the woman and... now things get worse- MUCH worse.  Apparently the woman brought back personal feelings that weren't meant to see the light of day.  Now these mental problems have been unleashed.  Sounds fun so far, right?  Read on.<br /><br />Let me mention that everything about the man and woman falling in love is flat out *boring* because I've seen an identical build-up of typical relationship highs and lows in several other films, so nothing different was done here at all.  I mean it was written in such a predictable way here that it's totally pointless to watch.  In fact the one and only scene that made an effort to stand out and be different is when the man gets furious at his wife who's simply minding her own business at a dinner party and he comes storming in the room, grabs her by the hair and pulls her out of the house.  Nobody at the party seemed to think this was unordinary behavior or stood up for the woman.  What?<br /><br />Even worse is that whenever something good happens such as this, the writing completely falls apart so the very next scene shifts in another direction, thereby destroying all suspense that could have occurred.  Terrible.  It's obvious the man is crazy but nothing really suspenseful other than the guy destroying a book shelf and making a few threats ever seem to come out of it.<br /><br />Now the second part of the film.  This is when the storyline completely falls flat.  This is when the amount of confusion will probably leave you speechless.  Well apparently the wife disappears, so we flash several years into the future with the husband as an old man, in a courtroom, and attempting to explain his innocence but... now the storyline is completely focused around the characters as OLDER people so suddenly it's like watching a completely different movie, and... get THIS- now we're seeing the man accused of murdering his wife dressed up as a woman *himself* and involved in conflicts with other older people that do absolutely nothing but confuse the living heck out of me.<br /><br />Suddenly MURDERS are now occurring, which is odd because you'd think growing older would mean becoming wiser and less violent.  Suddenly as an old man, he's doing drugs with a friend in a car and wearing make-up like a woman.  Whatever (or whoever) is responsible for these murders being committed when it would seem these characters don't have much time on the planet anyway since old age has creeped in is beyond my understanding- WAY beyond it.<br /><br />Bored by the generic writing of the first half and confused by the second half makes this movie an absolute failure.  A double dose of failure in fact because \\"bored and confused\\" is the worst of BOTH worlds when it comes to movie storytelling.Ugh!  I strongly recommend avoiding this hogwash!

B0062KMDZ2|4.0|Over the years I have seen many versions of this movie, and I don't consider that any of them should be taken seriously.  So all in the spirit of fun I find that this Brendan Fraser version is a keeper for me. I enjoyed the regular DVD version initially...until I upgraded my television set. I just bought and watched the 3D verstion of this movie and even though I found the 3D glasses a bit difficult to wear throughout the movie, doing so was worth it. While I believe there is still much work to be done on the quality of 3D movies in general, I found the depth and the \\"pop-out\\" to be delightful experiences and I plan to purchase a few more select 3D movies.<br />As far a this version of the Jules Vern Classic, this was my favorite as Trevor Anderson (Fraser), his nephew make a breakthrough discovery and a breakthrough in their relationship that improves the story for me.  This predictable \\"never-before-seen world\\" (except by Hollywood and previous versions of this story) holds a few new twists and turns as well as an ending that works for me.

B0006A9FKA|4.0|Slacker buddies Shaun (Simon Pegg) and Ed (Nick Frost) gradually realize that they are in the middle of a zombie apocalypse that has gripped London.  Shaun, who has already been increasingly dissatisfied with his aimless life, rises to the occasion and sets off to rescue his ex-girlfriend (Kate Ashfield) and mother (Penelope Wilton), dragging Ed along for the ride.<br /><br />I enjoyed the film, due to wonderful performances and the funny way that hell on earth so slowly impinges on Shaun's existence.  However, I have to admit that it fell short of my expectations, given the acclaim it has received over the years.  I was bothered by several scenes in which characters have extended, pointless conversations with each other while in the midst of an attack, but I was won back by the fresh take on a familiar genre and sharp social commentary.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I absolutely could not put this book down.

B002IDDRT8|3.0|For me, the best part of the film is when Jesus drops the \\"F-bomb\\" about five minutes in. It was so shocking to hear the devinely devout Jim Caviezel spit it in such a completely convincing way that I actually laughed out loud.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of this genre and also a great fan of Caviezel, so when I saw this pop up I was curious enough to make an instant buy. I'm not sorry I did - very entertaining and an interesting premise. Cowboys v. Aliens only a bit further back in the timeline and with less technology.<br /><br />There was a lot of silliness, some confusion and tons of cliches. Fortunately, the acting was actually very good, despite a level of predictability that should have been avoided and - with an obviously large budget - could have been. Unlike some reviewers, I think Caviezel's somewhat dry acting style of restraint and a steady confidence lends itself very well to being an action hero. I don't like my tough guys running around losing contol of themselves and overacting all over the place. Tall, cool ones always play it best. Jack Houston makes for a pretty and likeable right-hand man and Perlman and Hurt are seasoned pros who pull away from the pack in any scene they're involved with. A number of talented support cast add flavor and a dash of humor when they get the chance - which sadly isn't often enough.<br /><br />The worst thing about this movie is the missed opportunity. I like a bit more Sci with my Fi, if you will.  To take an alien being with highly advanced technology and introduce him to the primitive Vikings should have provided a wealth of interesting situations, humor, wonder and ultimately a fantastic showdown. But it didn't. Instead, the alien/hero just becomes a regular old Viking, no cool stuff is introduced beyond the first ten minutes or so  (besides the monster and that's a given) and the whole thing kind of flatlines. There just isn't any growth to the story - it peaks early and then levels off. That's too bad and does adisservice to all of the hard work and money that was obviously put into this film.<br /><br />Still, I watched it all and I liked it o.k. It was a decent movie - far better than quite a bit of the nonsense and garbage that gets dumped into the theaters these days. It was full of beautiful scenery, some pretty great fight scenes and some very talented actors. It's just a shame that there was such a lack of vision for the project as a whole, which plays itself out in the end when the production company pulled out with little or no promotion whatsoever. Missed opportunity, indeed.

0446572993|4.0|While I'll admit that I haven't read everything that the prolific Mr. Baldacci has published in recent years, I'm pleased to say that The Innocent is the strongest novel I've seen from him in quite some time.  It was a book that I didn't want to put down until I'd read it all.<br /><br />The novel opens with Will Robie.  We learn that he is \\"an inch over six feet and a rock-solid one hundred and eighty pounds\\", that he is one day shy of his 40th birthday, and that he is a professional killer.  But this is no thug off the street; this is a man with a rich interior life, a moral center, and more than a little going on upstairs.  Therefore, it's not too surprising when we soon learn that Robie is employed by an unnamed federal agency to carry out \\"sanctioned assassinations.\\"  In his own words:<br /><br />\\"Sometimes he went after people intent on global menace, like Rivera or Talal, or sometimes he simply went after a problem.  You could take your pick of labels, but in the end, they all meant the same thing.  His employer decided who among the living and breathing would qualify as a target.  And then they turned to men like Robie to end the living and breathing part.  It made the world better, was the justification.\\"<br /><br />Except this time, he's being sent after a different type of target--a woman, an American, a mother.  At the crucial moment, Robie refuses to fire.  It doesn't smell right.  Someone finishes the job with a long-range sniper shot, and it looks like they'll finish Robie as well if he doesn't run.<br /><br />Elsewhere, we meet the wise-beyond-her-14-years Julie Getty.  She's been in and out of the foster care system, and she's in the process of escaping her latest \\"caregivers.\\"  Julie has parents that she loves and who love her, but who are engaged in an ongoing battle with addiction.  Returning to her parents' home illicitly, Julie is just in time to see the two of them murdered in cold blood.  She is a witness, so she too is on the run.<br /><br />Julie and Robie arrive at the same escape route, a late night bus from DC to NY.  Each notes the other, and when things get ugly fast, it's not clear which of them was the target of the violence.  Nonetheless, these two characters form an unlikely alliance as they attempt to unravel the mysteries surrounding them.<br /><br />When it comes to a Baldacci novel, plot is front and center, and I thought this one was deftly handled.  The pacing was excellent, and my interest in the story being told never flagged for a moment.  I'll admit that I DID suspect the ultimate bad guy, but I didn't have a clue as to the whys and wherefores.  The story was suspenseful and unfolded beautifully.  It all made sense and held together well in the end.  As a native Washingtonian, I won't say that the novel was hugely evocative, but the DC setting was handled reasonably well.  Mr. Baldacci seems to have a good feel for the workings of the town.  Additionally, Robie and Julie made appealing and well-fleshed protagonists.  One of the things I liked best about this novel is that it is a stand alone, but I wouldn't be at all surprised if we see these characters again.  The door is left open for sequels or a continuing series.<br /><br />All and all, I found The Innocent to be a very successful entertainment.  More like this, please, Mr. Baldacci!  And I'm left pondering who among the characters really was the eponymous \\"innocent\\" of the title.>Julie and Robie arrive at the same escape route, a late night bus from DC to NY.

0553801473|2.0|For anyone who hasn't read the books yet, I'll mark where spoilers are in capital letters for you. I'm not going to mark spoilers from previous books, however. You should read the first three books regardless of how these last two have turned out.<br /><br />I'm at a loss for what happened to Martin with this book. I don't understand how a man who could write a scene as amazing as the Red Wedding, or could make Jaime Lannister my favorite character, somehow turned into Robert Jordan with all this filler. No offense to any Jordan fans, but I had to give up on him half way through book 6, when I finally realized that absolutely nothing was happening. But seriously, I hated Jaime Lannister in Game of Thrones. I was extremely pleased when Robb captured him at the end of the book. I was very angry at Martin for making Jaime a new POV and having Catelyn set him free. Then I read his chapters and somehow Martin turned him into my favorite character in the series. Even though the writing was on the wall leading up to the Red Wedding, I still threw the book across the room and didn't start reading it again for a week. Those kinds of emotions that Martin could provoke in you seem to be long gone, and I don't know why.<br /><br />I think what bothers me the most is that Martin's main stated reason for not jumping the series ahead five years was that he had no good reason for why the Others wouldn't attack during that time. These last two books have covered about 1-2 years worth of time and the Others still haven't bothered attacking. Considering they are supernatural creatures who do things when they want to, I think them waiting five years would've been fine. After reading AFFC and ADWD, it was pretty clear to me that Martin had nothing worth writing about in the aftermath of ASOS. He needed people to travel long distances to get the board moving again, and decided to spend two books describing all those journeys, while having no one reach their destinations by the end. AFFCwas almost entirely about Cersei hating people and nothing happening, while Brienne walked around everywhere yelling \\"SANSA!!\\" when we the reader already knew that Sansa was at the Eyrie, and that she wasn't even getting close to figuring that out. It's hard to read a journey that you know can't go anywhere meaningful. Maybe if Martin had hid where Sansa was going, there might have been some suspense to Brienne's journey.<br /><br />SPOILER PARAGRAPH: The biggest problem with the plot of this book is that it is almost all travel, and no one finishes traveling. It's especially confusing because Martin said one of the big reasons he had trouble finishing the book was untangling his \\"Meereenese knot.\\" He didn't untangle it at all. All the people on their way to Meereen are still on their way to Meereen at the end of the book. If \\"words are wind\\" was actually true, all the people on their boats should've spoken into their sails to make them go a little faster. Tyrion's journey was the worst traveling offense. Every chapter was roughly 20 miles down the road (or river) from the last chapter. Martin could've easily cut the 8 travel chapters down into 2 or 3 at the most, and still given us a great view of this \\"incredible\\" world he has built. I don't even want to get into the issues with Daenerys' chapters. First of all, the Daenerys from ASOS would have never in a million years found that Daario character a guy she wanted to be with. He might be the worst designed character that Martin has ever made. I could accept Dany being a bad queen of Meereen at first (she has absolutely no experience with ruling), but at some point she should've started growing into a leader or dieing as a bad one. Instead she remains mired in poorly written indecision that lasts throughout the book and never comes to any resolution. I do realize that there can only be so much resolution in book 5 of an allegedly 7 book series, but that's no excuse for the utter lack of progression in her storyline. As for the Griff revelations, they don't bother me as much as someone like Catelyn being not dead or undead or whatever she is now, because his death was implied. It wasn't like Catelyn who you knew was dead but now isn't. Her not death opens up too many possibilities for death not being meaningful, which is a major part of what made Martin's tale so awesome in the first place. If Ned, Robb, and Tywin all show up together at an inn in the next book, I will be setting it on fire, on the spot, and will officially give up on the series. Back to Griff, I don't think he's going to matter much anyways if he continues on his path. Martin has already fallen in love with the leader who never loses a battle on the field, but dies for some personal reason (See: Drogo, Robb). Griff already seems on his way down that path so I'm not too worried about him mattering much in the end.<br /><br />I think the cold truth for ADAD, as with AFFC before it, is that it didn't really need to be written. Or, at the very least with an actual editor, it could've been trimmed down to one book that would've more than sufficed for transitioning the story over to the Winds of Winter. Martin didn't need 2000 pages and two books just to world build and show us how vast and different it is. He could've achieved that with much better, more concise use of his wording, in 1000 less pages, and it would've been a lot better regarded by the fans.<br /><br />Despite everything I said above, I'm not done with the series yet. I think the Winds of Winter was the book Martin wanted to write after ASOS, and will have all the action and plot that was missing from these last two books. Assuming he had done whatever time jump he had been contemplating, I think TWOW is the book that he would've produced for us, but instead he just decided to take the long, boring road to get there.<br /><br />Bottom line: Read the first three books, read the plot summaries for the last two books, wait with the rest of us for TWOW,and pray that Martin gets back to using plot and character like he knows how to.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|We pre-ordered this DVD 3 months ago it just came. I was surprised to see that the film is an attack on the successful and conservative prime minister of Britain. It is silly, long and boring. I should have known it would have liberal anti-Thatcher slant when Meryl Streep got the academy award.<br /><br />There isn't much to attack her with over cutting taxes and busting the labor unions. Unfortunately, however there are many ridiculous fabricated conversations between Margaret and the ghost of her late husband; too much.<br /><br />The film portrays Mrs. Thatcher as a cold woman who was rude to allies in cabinet meetings and who sent soldiers to fight and die in the Falklands.<br /><br />There were so many flash backs; it was disjointed and a huge disappointment.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|No other show on television has hooked me quite like Breaking Bad. I give it perfect 10's across the board: acting, pacing, storytelling, cinematography, etc. I even have the soundtrack, the music is just that good as well. So stop reading this and start watching Br Ba!
0439023513|4.0|Mockingjay in my mind is the book from the Hunger Games trilogy most unlike the others.  It is the only book of the trilogy to not feature the Games.  It appears to suffer in many fans eyes because of it, but the series had to break into the large story eventually.  In doing so, it highlights both the strengths and weaknesses of the larger trilogy.<br /><br />Katniss has woken up from the horror of Catching Fire to be faced with the choice of whether to become the face of a revolution.  Many a speculative fiction series has dealt with a messiah (notably, The Wheel of Time), but what about the symbol of a revolution?  And what if the rebels bear signs of being just as or almost as bad as the current government?  These are the questions Mockingjay asks, and the value in simply asking that largely carries the book.<br /><br />Like most dystopian fiction, the Hunger Games uses its science fiction aspects to explore human nature through social and political structures rather than to explore human nature through the implications of technology.  And like most dystopian fiction, the science is predictably bad in comparison to hard science fiction.<br /><br />The Hunger Games was never a very \\"nice\\" series.  Mockingjay is particularly dark.  But it's also very good.  The pace is fast.  Collins's ratchets up the tension in the first half, and shows a definite skill for ending chapters on Wham Lines.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|It's so nice to get a CD that you can just put in and enjoy from start to finish.  Every song is great and the tunes weave themselves together effortlessly which makes for a very pleasurable listening experience.  \\"Don't Wanna Know\\" just makes you want to get up and dance.  Long live the Cog!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this dvd after the birth of my second child. My first and second workout, I couldn't really keep up. By the third workout, I could tell a huge difference in my stamina. I do think its effective, but I do think its easy to injure yourself if your form isn't correct or if you try to overdo it.<br />I really like that its pretty short. With two small kids, 20 minutes is perfect. I do wish each part of each circuit had a countdown timer, but that's just personal preference. Jillian keeps saying that this will replace hours in the gym. We will see...
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game...very addicting, love that you don't have to buy &quot;acorns &quot;,you get them when you level up. A grate way to kill time!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I am unthinkably lucky. My favorite book series of all time has been turned into one of the best television shows of all time.<br /><br />And I'm not the only one who thinks so! Critics love it, award shows laud it, and record-breaking millions of viewers are tuning in.<br /><br />The dialog is superb, flowing with hidden subtext, overt emotion, political posturing, unfortunate truths, naïve admissions, and much more. And each line is perfectly acted! I don't know how they managed to fill an ensemble cast of this scope with such talented actors, but even the children are impeccable. Joffrey conjures uncontrollable hatred, managing to be one of the most contemptible characters to grace the screen, and at such a young age! I feel bad for that kid. There's no way anyone will be able to look at him the same again.<br /><br />Season 2 picks up after the shocking events of season 1, which I won't mention in case you haven't seen it. And if that's the case, what are you doing? Go watch it right now!<br /><br />The death of a monarch has left the land of Westeros in political turmoil, rulers declaring themselves kings on every corner of the map. As the inevitable war ensues, we follow the various leaders, rooting for the most honorable, but simultaneously fearing for their lives, for this is a dark show, and the most just cause is often the most treacherous. Our heroes do not have the strength of numbers, but rather the strength of character, and that does not win wars.<br /><br />The season launches us headfirst into this maelstrom of a power struggle, introducing us to even more characters than before. For people who haven't read the books, it may be a bit hard to follow, but the show does its best and usually manages to pull it off. The two newest additions to the battle for dominance are Stannis Baratheon, eldest brother to the late king, and Balon Greyjoy, father of Theon Greyjoy and perpetual enemy of house Stark.<br /><br />From the moment you meet these characters, you'll be awestruck by just how high quality this show is. HBO spares no expense, and their money is put to good use. The new sets are stunning, from Stannis's table carved into a likeness of all of Westeros, to Balon's fireplace, crafted into a giant Kraken.<br /><br />Back in King's Landing, we once again finds ourselves enjoying Peter Dinklage's Tyrion as he continues to cleverly maneuver the human chess pieces that make up the court. He's definitely this season's hero, and he strikes a perfect balance between likability, morality, and underhanded politicking. As the season goes on, even more people die, the stakes are raised, and a sense of impending doom settles across the land.<br /><br />If you love the realism of the series, you may be shocked when things take a turn for the magical partway through the season. Still, the sorcery is artfully done, and while it's a bit hard to fathom, there isn't much of it to get used to. By the halfway point, situations have become truly dire. War is most certainly brewing, the lands north of the wall promise ever-increasing danger, and the clash of kings continues.<br /><br />And what a clash it is! Episode 9 presents us with what is quite possibly the most incredible battle in television history. Only on HBO could a show achieve such heights. The tension of the women awaiting the outcome, the gruesome brutality of war, the chilling fact that no matter how much you prepare, in the end your fate is decided as much by random chance as by skill--it's all awe-inspiring. Whatever stalling the season might be guilty of is justified in this amazing episode.<br /><br />And it definitely is guilty of some stalling. Daenerys doesn't accomplish much, but the resolution to her storyline is satisfying. And even if you didn't think that was enough of a season final&eacute;, I have just one word for you: zombies. Or maybe two words: zombie horse.<br /><br />This is a show of deceit and of honor, of love and betrayal and politics, of warand the base desires of man, of monsters and of loyalty, of sex and lies and conniving. It is made with the utmost sincerity, doing service to the source material, and expands upon that material with brilliant scenes we could not have witnessed in the novels.<br /><br />There is plenty of violence and nudity, so bear that in mind, but that is not the heart of the show. Rather, those aspects serve to underscore the themes of the story. These characters live in a dark world, and they must make the best of it while they can. After all, Winter is Coming.<br /><br />UPDATE: Packaging is gorgeous, although the DVD case is somewhat flimsy, but what can you do? Getting the digital copy was super easy. I followed the instructions and downloaded all the episodes off Amazon Unbox without any problems, and was able to watch them on my PS3 immediately. Admittedly, my TV is only 720p, but the picture quality of the discs was impeccable. Have only run through everything to make sure it works.

1609611543|5.0|The information in this book has been life changing for me. I had no idea wheat could detrimentally affect my health. I always thought whole grain wheat was healthy. I now know this is not the case. By eliminating wheat from my diet, I have finally found the cure for my health problems. I have had Fibromyalgia and arthritis for 22 years and have tried many things to help relieve the horrible pain I was in (prescriptions, homeopathy, health clinic, going off sugar for nine months). The anti-inflammatory and pain pills helped to mask some of the pain, but it didn't remove it completely. Now after eating wheat-free and low carb/high fat for two months, I can stand up and walk without pain. My chronic headaches are gone (unless I eat something with wheat in it). I no longer have acid reflux, which prior to going wheat-free was so severe that I had to sleep in a chair. I had so much scar tissue in my esophagus from the acid reflux that I had to have four surgical procedures to break up the scar tissue so I could swallow. I was on the highest dose of Prilosec. I also had irritable bowel syndrome with severe cramping and diarrhea. Now, the IBS is completely gone. Along with Fibromyalgia I also suffered with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. Prior to going off wheat, I couldn't do much because of the pain and fatigue. Now I have energy and feel great. The brain fog has lifted and I can now think clearer. I have lost 33 lbs.; and although I'm happy to finally lose some weight, I am even more excited about my improved health. I did have some withdrawal symptoms during the first two weeks. My first really good day was about 10 days into the diet (I had energy, no pain and could think clearer - it was such a huge difference and my husband and kids were so excited for me); and then after three weeks I consistently had good days. I think the acid reflux got better right away, but I can't remember which day I noticed it was gone. This is the best I've felt in 25 years. I'm so grateful tofinally discover the key to solving all of my health problems.

When I read this amazing book I saw a whole other side to Marilyn. It was so interesting, intriguing, beautiful, obscene, hilarious! All I have to say is buy it read it enjoy it!

0060005696|4.0|This is a readable academic's take on decisions, with footnoted studies to back it.  The essence of the book is because humans adapt, you won't be happy with what you have forever, therefore you will make additional decisions and changes in your life.  The \\"Maximizer\\" seeks the optimal path, always, and goes into agony if some small part of what he or she considers 'The Best' is not available.  The \\"Satisficer\\" seeks a path good enough for the them, enjoying life more without a continually agony of decision making.<br /><br />The book's paradigm explained why I usually don't care about what restaurant we eat at, but agonize for hours about buying a CD because I don't like every single song on it.  Once you are aware of Maximizing vs. Satisfying, you can tune your preference into satisfaction instead of being addicted to maximization.<br /><br />Liked the book; gave a logical explanation to my own behavior in stores, when I am faced with tons of choices.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|My son hooked me into George R R Martin's wonderful series and as I am a third of the way into Book 5, I simultaneously cannot wait to see what happens, and dread that it is coming to an end. I have read heroic fantasy since I was introduced to Robert Howard's Conan back in the seventies and have read a huge amount of that genre since. I find that it ranks as high for me as Tolkien's LOTR and Michael Moorcock's Eternal Champion. The unique part of Martin's series is the way he has found to kill off every major character without destroying the story, or the desire to read on once your favorite has had its head removed. This is truly a masterpiece of modern fiction.
B004HEXSLI|5.0|This book was suggested to me by a Pyschotherapist, to help me understand the relationship between the difference in the hemispheres of the brain and our emotional state of mind. The Author, a highly educated Neuroanatomist or \\"brain scientist\\", experienced a major stroke and after eight years of constant effort, therapy and loving support, was able to make a full recovery and go back to her profession. It allows the reader the ability to perceive, on a very basic level, the overwhelming results of a massive hemorrhage to the left hemisphere or logic center of the brain, not just from a physical but also a mental, emotional and spiritual impact. It was positive, educational and rewarding to read about one person's journey back to health with a new awareness of what we are capable of and how we can use a tragedy to refocus our perspectives and goals.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|The strength of the omnibus was that I was able to keep going and thus develop a more consistent feeling of the silo environment. Even though some of the characters were predictable, I think what grabbed me was the impact of living as a bank of humans in such a situation. As a consequence, I could even sympathize somewhat with the IT guys and their decision making. It may seem tyranny, but in the end, what option is there, particularly when the destruction is contained and reflected inwards.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have no idea why people like this book.  The author needs a thesaurus.  \\"Hot\\" can't be the only way to describe a good looking man (at least after the age of 16).  I know she's a middle aged woman but it reads more like it was written by an inexperienced 18 year old with boring cliches of what someone imagines is sophistication.  And to be even pickier, who wears gray flannel pants and a linen shirt at the same time?  Instantly unsophisticated.

0307956350|2.0|To put this in perspective, I don't like Grisham, I do like Turow and I love Durrenmatt.  The characterization in this book did not work for me, the plot line became unintentionally funny, especially at the end where we kept getting \\"surprise twists\\".  There was a lot of howlers, the spy gets recruited just like a Le Carre agent back in the thirties at Oxford only it's not back in the thirties at Oxford.  It was a cyber crime and that part had its interest I suppose, but not much for me anyway. Heard it's being made into a movie, strong female lead, strong female villain. It might do well, but it's not much and you leave it with nothing.[[ASIN:0307956350 The Expats: A Novel]]

The Invention of Hugo Cabret is set in a busy train station in Paris, where young Hugo manages to keep all the clocks ticking and avoid detection while living in the walls and working to repair a 'mechanical man' left by his dead father. That is he remains secreted away until he meets up with a book loving girl and her toy maker guardian. The beautiful drawings add richness to the real black and white movies which are part of the plot.

B001DJLCRC|5.0|I heard about Breaking Bad (BrBa) through word of mouth, and by the time season 4 was underway I picked up the first season, late on the bandwagon but still wowed. All of the seasons of BrBa are great, but they all sort of drag out what's going on, and while the tension and suspense are there I still have a hard time remembering each episode because a lot of them left me with blue balls. This season however short it is, moved at a lightning quick pace and barely gave me time to adjust my face.<br /><br />Breaking Bad's first season shows the beginning of Walt's transformation from unlucky high school chemist to criminal mastermind, and it's all fascinating because it's all circumstantial, Walt's almost forced into this new dangerous world because the other options are die and leave his family with nothing, and that's what makes BrBa different from say, Scarface since Tony was just a greedy thug in the first place, Walt is a family man.<br /><br />Basically season 1 chronicles Walt taking out his competition early on in New Mexico, and there are many memorable scenes and results from it, one of my favorite moments is Walter putting a plate back together and making a horrible discovery, you know the one. But pretty much episode after episode some new variable changes the game completely, keeping the whole season short and sweet; television writers take note.<br /><br />If you haven't seen BrBa before and are curious you need to stop reading this right now and get your hands on the whole series, season 1 especially starts out the show with a bang but by season 3 it starts to show it's stretch marks. Still Breaking Bad is proof that HBO has some competition.

0452273331|4.0|I just finished reading The Fountainhead by Ayn Rand. As with the rest of her books it has a heavy dose of her philosophy and politics like all the rest of her work does. Its main focus is the difference between people that derive their motivation and purpose in life from themselves and others that derive their purpose in life from the reactions of others and the power, praise money and respect that they get from them. For me the practical application of the philosophy fits what I have seen and felt in the world. It discuses the moral situation of creation versus distribution and differences between the way society treats who make vs those that only give without making. Ayn Rand is often referred to in libertarian circles but the subtlety of the philosophy in her books is far in excess of some of the crude parroting of it I have read before. Unfortunately I don't find that her writing matches the quality of her philosophy. Like many women she seems to believe that where one word is good two would be better. In addition to that the excessive self awareness/exposition of some characters, especially Toohey later in the book, that make the philosophy clearer but the characters less plausible.  Overall I would say that it is well worth reading for the insights but don't expect the entire book to be gripping action.<br /><br />I would lean towards 5 stars for the ideas but the writing style is FAR longer then necessary and just plain uninteresting for the majority of it. The writing seems as crenelated as the works of Keating.

140053271X|4.0|I only have my NOOK for three weeks, but I'm very happy with it. Already read four books on it and it reads just as easy as a paper book. Battery lasted only three weeks instead of two months (but depends on the amount of pages you turn, and I turned quite a lot of them ;p), but the battery is charged within three or four hours,so no big deal. Nice, light weighted, compact e-reader, with good screen and enough options to change font,font size, etc. Also very quick delivery to Europe with Amazon (within a week!). Good price vs. quality. For Europeans, don't buy the extra adapter, because it's American only and it's easy to charge via pc. If you're looking for an alternative to paper books, this is a great device. I also bought a NOOK cover from B&N: very pretty, but a little expensive I think, the back crinkles very quick and it takes a while to ship to Europe.

1451627289|5.0|This book was amazing!  As a dedicated Stephen King fan for years, I thought this book was fantastic. It is much different than what we usually find in the stories that Stephen King writes, but it was just as great.  It was very suspensful and intense and extremely hard to put down! It kept the reader wanting more. Stephen King never seems to disappoint, with every twist and turn of the story, i couldnt help but bite my nails! I would highly recommend this.  An amazing book written by a sure genius.
0307956350|5.0|The Expats is an unusual espionage novel. It is about a married couple who have secrets but who love each other.Dexter and Katherine Moore seem to live an ordinary life with their kids in the suburbs. On day Dexter comes home and tells Katherine that he has been offered a very lucrative job in Luxembourg.At first Kate treats it like a joke pretending she doesn't know where Luxembourg is or if its a country. She does not want to leave her CIA job which Dexter is unaware that she has.<br />She finally agrees to go and be an expat in Luxembourg raising the kids and being a full time housewife.She becomes bored pretty quickly with the dull routine of housework and full time mother. She is approached one day by a woman named Julia who says she and her husband Bill would like to become better acquainted with Dexter and Kate. They show an almost obsessive interest in the couple. The story takes off and is told with much wit and humor. Fascinating, the world of espionage but Pavone makes it a fascinating read.

B005F9CPG8|5.0|Of course, I love rarities, but this work demonstrates the evolution and versatility of The Beatles' music. Perhaps we don't let today's artists grow as earlier generations did, which is a shame. Just listen to how The Beatles sound and message changed with the times and personal maturity...would we allow current artists to do the same? It's worth listening to in order to hear the value in pop, in \\"light\\" and in (at least for the 60s and 70s) alternative. Craft is key: that partnership among songwriting, production and talent. Listening to the early songs makes me look for the art in today's pop songs - and it is there. The genuine anger and angst of some of the later work makes many of today's overwrought, emo, woe-is-me fabrications look positively foolish.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|I found this book without looking for it and started to read it without any great expectation.  I was pulled in quickly and read the omnibus edition straight through. Considering the potentially limited space implied by the reference to silos, it seems a complete world in a single environment, more richly detailed and consistent than most.  The enviroment is a main character in the book, helping to make this an engrossing read.  Thank you for an enjoyable and thought-provoking series.  I'm hooked.
B0011UF792|5.0|Awsome service, arrived early and product matched its description! What more can you ask for?  I very highly recommend this product.
B000ICXQGK|3.0|Since I based watching this movie on the reviews I read, I wanted to rate it myself to help others in their choice. Overall, we were disappointed with this movie. It was just too strange, sad and surreal to keep our interest going throughout. The religious undertones were prevalent and awkward in many scenes. Acting jobs were decent, though it seemed that there must have about an hour's worth of dialog with actors being on the verge of tears. It became too much. Nice idea for a script but it just didn't grip us.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|ya! It's. a fun game.If you like building your own Ice Age village then you should get this game.Its fun and cool for kids like myself and it could very well be a really fun game for you never know you may just like or love the game / this game:)
B001GMH8SI|5.0|This is one of the best movies ever made in my opinion. Plenty of reviews here already attest to that, but I wanted to put in my two cents. The blu-ray quality is very good and does the movie justice. Very fair price for such a movie.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a basic but easy to play Mario copy with all of the same types of obstacles.  I'm excited I found this
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I tried the free version and liked it so well with the limited features that I thought &quot;shucks,  for the price of a bottle of pop,  why not try the paid version?&quot;  It is<br /> worth every penny!<br /><br />If you need a sleep noise generator,  you can't get better,  especially. at this price.  I love that I can layer custom blends of sound and save them so that if I wake up in the middle of the night, with a couple of touched on the screen,  I'll be back to sleep shortly.  I also like that the. timer gives a wide range of shutoff options.  In over 3 months of nightly use (sometimes more),  I think I have only. had to force-close maybe 2 or 3 times (in upwards of 200 uses).  It also seems to go very lightly on the power usage while unplugged.<br /><br />I do have a suggestion or two though for the developers,  though.  Could you make an option to leave the screen light on,  perhaps with a timer?  My middle daughter still prefers to sleep with a night-light, and I could see this being a useful function for babies and children.  The second suggestion is to let me know where I can send additional sound files (and in what format) - I have a frog pond in spring, mocking birds' night songs,  and a whippoorwill's call recorded that I would like to send to see if they could be added to the sound menu.
B0074EIQUG|5.0|How many times,even in my life has \\"Mac Rebennack\\" been a comeback kid? Seems as if each time in he comes out with a new album it seems like a comeback. He has the kind of personality where some people actually wonder if he'll ride off metaphorically into the sunset and not make any new music again. Never happens though. And considering how much of his music I'm more than familiar with,it kind of concerns me this is the first Dr.John  record I ever bought. It's something I plan to remedy very soon. He's one of those guys who just seems to sweat funk out of his pores upon waking up in the morning. He is from New Orleans so no surprise on that anyway. However I almost skimmed over this because I heard that producer Dan Auerbach  ruined the album with too much of a \\"heavy rock\\" production. And that it was Mac's born and bred Crescent City funkiness that \\"saved\\" the album. Kind of vague descriptions I suppose. But what I found here is quite different.<br /><br />  First of all for anyone who heard the critics this is NOT a guitar rock album at all. It does contain music somewhat faster than we're used to coming from Dr.John. But hey,everyone from the late Amy Winehouse on have helped popularize a new and higher octane type of rock n soul production this album does fully embrace. The title song is a monster! And the guitar solo is clean,bluesy and in complete control. \\"Revolution\\" has this heavy,horn packed modern retro soul flavor where \\"Big Shot\\" has this sound/sample of this very New Orleans jazz style horn solo mixed into it as a reminder of the heavy rootedness in the mans music. On \\"Ice Age\\",\\"Getaway\\",\\"Kingdom Of Izzness\\",\\"You Lie\\" and \\"Eleggua\\" the funk is as deep,churning and swampy as it always is. With a little Leon Russell type slickness involved too. Dr.John is also observing on how many of the spiritual,polticial and social freedoms his sound embraced being diminished in modern society. On the more major chorded and gospel influenced grooves \\"My Children,My Angels\\" and \\"God's Sure Good\\" he reminds us why those things are so important.<br /><br />  Even as a young man,there was something mildly sage about Dr.John to me. By the time I saw him live in Portland Maine about at the end of the 1990's,he was re-imaging Duke Ellington standards onstage,mingling them with his own classics to such as extent you think he'd written everything he played. He just has such a strong and distinctive personality,both musically and personally, that he can remain extremely provocative no matter what the cultural atmosphere he happens to be creating in. He's described in the liner notes to this album as \\"The Last Of The Great Tricknologists\\",again pointing to his individual qualities. And perhaps because this producer was associated mostly with the Black Keys might have something to do with the albums supposed \\"rock\\" flavor. Which,although not a bad thing in theory,just plain doesn't do justice to this highly soulful and funky album. For my first Dr.John album purchase?I personally don't feel like I was jipped. And that's my two cents on it.Angels\\" and \\"God's Sure Good\\" he reminds us why those things are so important.<br /><br />  Even as a young man,there was something mildly sage about Dr.John to me.

B006OCM0G0|3.0|First off it is very easy to accidentally buy or spend gems and items that cost gems are very expensive so if you save up fee gems you still won't be able to afford them. Also it will commonly lose things that aren't actively being used, for example it lost appliances I had stored and erased parts I needed to build something (which was very frustrating because I had 39/40 parts).
B0063IH60K|5.0|I've played many solitaire games in my lifetime but this one is the best.  Keeps my brain stimulated! Highly recommended!
B007SYWFRM|3.0|would be 5 but have issues connecting to gl live from inside the game...meaning no stats get posted or credited.
B006RUJST6|4.0|This is a sweet story, and although I have heard rave reviews about this, it wasn't as awesome as I thought it would be. You have the protagonists' forbidden love and they strive to do what's right, despite their love for each other. You'll probably cry or get teary at some point, too.<br /><br />There are also interesting and unique things that Ms. Hoover has - called Slams and I wish I knew what that was like (to actually hear the performances).<br /><br />It's a great chick-lit book about struggles and life and love. It's a nice read :).
0439023491|5.0|bought the 3 book series because daughter had read the first installment...she ate it up after she saw the movie...she LOVES this story!
B006QVRVJK|3.0|Polanski is very good with stories that start simple and slowly get out of hands. I can see why he felt at home with this. The construction of this film is fascinating and, of course, the acting is enticing. Although, I must say, John C. Reilly is the best of all four. In my humble opinion, of course. All the other ones, as good as they are (and they are), seemed to exaggerate a tad too much whenever losing it. It felt a bit like acting. John C. Reilly, on the other hand, was always believable even when angry. Especially when angry. As an actor, he really held his own amongst the three other powerhouse names. That's all to his credit.<br /><br />Now the intentions of the storytellers are what got me a bit annoyed. First, I didn't think we needed to have \\"help\\" in order to not like Christoph Waltz's character in the beginning. Why put him constantly on the phone? Of course we're going to be angry at him. The two couples have plenty enough of irritants between each other. We don't need to have the writers voluntarily create bad habits for them. Like the photos of Jodie Foster's characters. She obviously loves them more than certain human beings. Or Kate Winslet's character vomiting in the living room. They should let their personalities run the show and not use artificial artifacts to help us feel whatever they want us to feel as viewers. Speaking of the Jodie Foster's character, I feel like this whole debacle is, in most part, her fault. By constantly pushing the envelope, by constantly wanting to lecture the other couples, she finally provokes them. Her character and Christoph Waltz's character are the pillars of this story. They're both symptomatic of two important breed of parents.<br /><br />But the conclusion is too simple for my taste. To finish by saying that kids are basically more \\"sane\\" than adults, especially parents, is not fair. Even a cheap shot. Kids are not as conscious and \\"aware\\" of  their behavior. They go with the flow whereas adults are \\"corrupted\\" by their life experiences and whatever pressure society puts on them, good and bad. The conclusion solves nothing. I would have preferred for the two couples to make amends and to almost become friends at the end, the message being that yes, we can become animals despite our civilities but that we're also \\"better\\" than animals and that we're able to come to our senses, making us unpredictable and complex.d\\" by their life experiences and whatever pressure society puts on them, good and bad.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|This book the 3rd in the trilogy. Has much less S & M. Christian and Anastasia are married. Big mystery still going on about who is after them. Story is compelling.  Still not recommending these books for the Christian reader.  Would not want my kids reading it either.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I looooooovvvvvvveeeeeeeee iiiiiiiitttttttt. best game ever so far. any age can play it and be entertained. it also challenging in a way where nobody will get bored.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This is the 2nd book in the triology.  This book is not for the Christian reader. This book is explicit sex and S & M.  At least Christian and Anastasia are married. There is a mystery going on in the story which makes you want to keep reading.  I wander where she got this awful research for this kind of story.
B007MG360G|5.0|It was an amazing game it was a good game it got harder durng the end but it was nice to beat the game.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I have to say this trilogy is not for the christian reader.  It is total S & M and explicit sex.  Christian, the main character seems like an older Edward Cullen from Twilight.  It is an addictive set of novels.  But be careful you may not want to be thinking to hard about what is happening in the story. You may not want this stuff in your head. One good thing. Christian Grey and Anastasia steele at least get married. There is some mystery of what is happening to the characters so that keeps you reading.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|a nice little game on kindle fire. would be great if the exit option is clearer;takes sometime to figure out how to exit the game
B005HV6Y84|3.0|This CD has much more classical music than the other 3 cd's from the Twilight movies. I liked this music CD much better. You are not interruped constantly from bad music.
B006OB3K56|1.0|ONLY WORTH BUYING IF YOU HAVE BLU-RAY.  POOR QUALITY DVD, NO EXTRAS.<br /><br />Sorry to one star you Fassbender...Love the movie, love Steve McQueen. My beef is with Fox, which for some reason decided to release this film in this combo pack only, and decided NOT TO INCLUDE ANY OF THE EXTRAS ON THE DVD--just on the Blu-Ray disk. Would have enjoyed seeing the extras. Also be aware the DVD is standard definition...quality is awful. For hi-def you need to have Blu-Ray.<br /><br />Guess this is the new marketing push to get everyone to upgrade to Blu-Ray but I would have saved my money if I knew the DVD included in this set would be this shoddy. Would have at least liked to have had it spelled out in the product description so I could decide whether to buy. Fox should have refrained from releasing it on DVD at all rather than annoy people like this.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is a great app. teaches my daughter about saving and spending. we are hooked.  I even play after she goes to bed.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|wont let me pull up my kindle homescreen. I had to pull up gameloft games and get home from the app store please fix this.
B002O3Z50Q|4.0|As someone who grew up watching awful ancient epics and series such as \\"Sons of Hercules\\" - always featuring miserable special effects, the Mighty Ursus looking bewildered and the temptress Messalina in a prehistoric push-up bra - it was mostly a pleasure to see this spectacle brought to life. Brad Pitt gives a fine performance almost despite himself (notice how he adjusts his chiton unnecessarily for the camera's benefit) as Achilles, the troubled chieftain who decides to sit out his part in a war because of an insult by another chief. The cast is stellar, though no one is given enough screen time: Sean Bean as wily Odysseus, the aristocratic Peter O'Toole as King Priam, and too many more to list. The photography is beautiful and has the very definition of Cretan blue. But there are too many times when the CGI overwhelms the living action, to the point where it is as obvious as was the modern underwear on those old black and white epics of my childhood. Particularly egregious was the fleet under sail, which looked like it was shot off someone's desktop. Another problem: in this day and age, the movie omits the fact - central to \\"The Iliad\\" - that Patroclus was not Achilles' cousin or best friend, he was his lover. Only his death can bring Achilles out of his tantrum and send him rushing onto the battlefield in search of vengeance. I understand that it might be complicated to portray a warrior who removes himself from battle because a slave girl is taken from him but then returns to war because of the death of a male lover, but I think the world is old enough to understand that bisexuality existed in ancient Greece (as it does today). Anyone who reads \\"The Iliad\\", which includes a majority of college students and a fair number of high school students, is well aware of the story line. There are no surprises here and thus no need to put a metaphorical fig leaf over the situation. Bottom line: a well-acted, well-photographed film with too many special effects and an annoying fig leaf over the truth.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|good animation and works very well on the kindle<br /><br />no bugs and the gameplay works well. unique take on this genre of game and welcome on the kindle
B001RIY4WE|4.0|Terminator 2 has been reviewed to death so I'll focus on this edition.<br /><br />This edition has had more noise reduction applied to the video removing most of the grain. Some will not like this but it does not look like plastic as is the case when too much noise reduction is used and to my eye it brings out more clarity and fine detail. Blacks are ok but can be on the grey side and a bit too bright.<br /><br />Sound is great with the DTS-HD MA 6.1 lossless track. Only negative I can hear is that some sounds are in the wrong location in the sound field.<br /><br />The extras are a bit underwhelming and mostly recycled. The menu is fairly hard to navigate and most of the time only stays on screen for several seconds before vanishing.<br /><br />Overall not much is wrong with this edition and is well worth the $6 I paid for it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|simply awesome!  its so convenient! you can share things on different devices and systems without actually having to click share any where. its all automatic.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|My four year old granddaughter LOVES this movie. She comes over every weekend and watching it four or five times in a two day period is not unusual.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a fun game. I like the concept of seeing what happened to your Oregon Trail family. Good graphics, easy game play.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|As I am sure most people say the Hunger Games is a great book. It's a bit slow at the beginning but man once you hit the games you can't put it down. I love the strong female lead in these books. Katniss is awesome! I don't know about kids reading this though it's pretty violent.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So, I bought this book for my son who loves reading. He really liked it, and I read it after him, and I was impressed, so I took us to go see the movie. Way too violent, should of been rated r because they show little kids and teens killing each other. Anyways get it if you`re over 13
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It was a very fun game. Even though you could get a little mad at first ypu get the hang of it
B000S5ASM2|4.0|I really like the clean and unadorned recording of the New World Symphony, but I cannot find who actually recorded it!
B007SYWFRM|1.0|app wont work on kindle fire even though that is what it says it is for. don't know why it isn't working.
B004GYNPL2|5.0|this app works great for me. It's nice to have my important info on my pocket at all times. Great app!
B001DHXT6G|3.0|The initial interest in Star Trek might have been to imagine what life on other planets look like. The show didn't really provide that vision, but provided original entertainment at the time it was released, and remained original for decades thereafter. Today the choice of TV shows is far greater, although the quality has deteriorated. Star Trek is still unique, and worth watching for that reason. Some episodes are enthralling, whilst others are a bit monotonous.<br /><br />I was an avid viewer decades ago. I delayed buying the DVDs. Then I saw rebroadcasts of the show on TV. Just as well I didn't buy it. In every episodes captain Kirk and his party gets into trouble on a new planet. After a while you would think that they would be more careful. Sending the captain of a ship into dangerous situations instead of an advance party doesn't really make sense, but obviously necessary to create main characters. In many episodes they get into physical combat, and gets beamed up just in time.<br /><br />I did prefer the original series of Star Trek because the special effects were simpler, and it was more about the story. The acting didn't always look that serious. In later decades, the special effects became more elaborate, and it looked more serious. It wasn't as much fun, although the movies were entertaining.
B001NERPHS|5.0|This 2009 Columbia/Sony edition of The Basement Tapes has been superbly remastered, now making it, without any doubt, the best sounding version (on CD or LP) that's ever been issued.<br /><br />Musically this oozes a classy laid back charm, and is as essential as anything else in Bob Dylan & The Band's amazing back catalogue.<br /><br />If you have not already heard this sonically upgraded version yet, you are in for a real treat!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|more fun than many of those other build games.  easy to advance in the game then needing to hug w real money. many more ways to earn money and acorns in the game
B007SYWFRM|5.0|love this game and the mini videos are great for my three year old little one good fun for the whole family
1466401885|5.0|I bought this book before Spring Break after seeing it in my suggestions box. I was not familiar with the author and decided to give it a try. Being a college student I don't get many opportunities to read for fun very often. I was pleasantly surprised with this book and proceeded to reread it 3 more times since I bought it. It's a fairly easy read and doesn't get old after reading it more than once.
0802473164|5.0|I ordered the original book as well as this one for my fiance. It's very easy to understand, the ideas make a lot of sense, and I felt excited to really understand my partner better. It's one of those books where when you read it, it just clicks. My fiance read it rather quickly and liked it as well.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Really basic concept but its well designed. Fun and extremely simple<br />Fully worth its price. Couple of hours worth of game for a dollar.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game because there is so much to do. Its not boring and repetative. It keeps me entertained for a long time.
0307472841|5.0|I really liked this book and wanted to read more by Mankell after I finished this one. The plot was unusual and the characters drew me in. This book changes location and time due to the elaborate back story that needed to be told so the reader understands the significance of the solution to the mystery when it arrives. So, you go from Scandanavia to China and back again, but I didn't find the transition to be difficult. A cut above many mysteries.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I am not a big reader but am trying to become one.<br />I bought this book on a recommendation from a friend. At first I didn't think I was going to like it because of how the author jumps around from chapter to chapter with each charecter. Once I got to know each one I actually found myself having a hard time putting the book down because I could not wait to get back to each one to find out what happens. As soon as I finished the first book I watched the first HBO season. I am now reading the second book and will finish in time to watch the whole second season.<br />Overall I think this is a great series especially if you enjoy reading stories from this era in time.<br />Two thumbs up!
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|I really like this app.  Best reader I've found. But it crashes a lot on the Fire. Hangs for long periods too. Hoping for a fix - it's a really great app otherwise.
B007IK44CK|5.0|A flash back from the series.  The first three movies were awesome in decending order from I to III.  IV shared their own only from I to IV...  Enjoy those of you who are 52 lapers or there about...
B00006ADD5|3.0|it is a great epic movie - I don't know if I would watch it again as I found it depressing.  But beautifully made.
B007SSEBCU|1.0|Don't waste your time.  I'm sitting here with my family; everyone had high hopes.  Everyone hates it!  Don't say you were not warned.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I especially enjoy how you can redeal same hand to try and get it right, if you don't succeed the first time.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|This book didn't blow me away, but if you're a Marian Keyes fan she stays true to her style and characters. It was an ejoyable read- comedic, fast paced with some romance thrown in. I'd recommend for any Keyes fan.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game. good interface cute graphics slow pace bit what do you want for free overall an enjoyable experience ok
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This. Book. Is. Amazing! I read it in one sitting and just couldn't put it down! By the time I was done, I qualified for zombie status, but oh it was so worth it. I LOVED Travis. He was tough, rambunctious, headstrong, unreasonable, confusing and immature. Not to mention a total manwhore! He was also caring, loving, protective, devoted and single minded in getting the girl! Oh and did I mention he was totally HOT! Complicated doesn't even start to describe him, but all these reasons only made me love him more! I also really liked Abby. She was a great love interest and very well written. The two together burned up the pages and left me hungry for more! I loved Shep and America together and best friends to Travis and Abby. This was an amazing story of two polar opposites who find out they aren't really that opposite, push-pull till they find they are in love and then conflict ensues! Im am enamored with this book! It was such a terrific read!!!! The only downside to this book was it didn't keep going..and going and going!
B0055PGUYU|5.0|I absolutely enjoyed this book so much.  I gained so much insights about how our habits are linked to every aspect of our lives.  Highly recommended!
B0070UFMOW|5.0|This device really did shock me because of how little this device is but wow this defiantly gives power to your headphone! Best of all it uses DAC/AMP. It also comes with DAC and AUX cables which is nice. Never seen DAC/AMP that costed under 200 dollars. The sound stage is extremely nice through these amp and the bass is also very tight when you bump it up. But compare to e11 the bass is slightly weaker which is the only down side but other then that one of the most affordable amp you could get. I would defiantly recommend this to people who wants to use it as a portable device. Defiantly sounds nice through Sensheiser HD600.
B0055SWM08|4.0|This will take up a lot of your time if you let it.<br />because it's fun and engaging.<br />Don't get caught up for hours like I did.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|Try using this app on instrumental or classical music &amp; it rarely returns any results. Many times all you have is a tune or hum and this is where it falls short. Great social &amp; we search integration, when it finds the song it can take you to youtube for example. Also &quot;Barbara Streisand&quot; easter egg!
B002BU0DPE|1.0|We bought these headphones late October 2011.  They started dying early 2012.  Mid April and they no longer work at all.  Put your money toward another set of head phones.
B004EPYZV2|1.0|I loved MI1 and, especially, MI3. I was really looking forward to 4, but it just doesn't work. The film feels like a bad spoof of itself. The humor could have worked if the acting had been good, the action sequences well put together and the overall pacing on par with MI3. But the acting is flat, the action sequences poorly shot and edited and the pacing is completely off. It seems they put the wrong director on this one. MI4 is unfortunately, in my opinion, the worst of the series.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this ... so many translations. Its easy to use. I love being able to go to the different translations without having to pick up a book and struggle to find what I want.
0307888908|5.0|I have read and re-read this book a few times now, and believe that the authors have laid a clear path for managing one's career in the 'new' world of business.<br />This book is specially relevant for those in the US, where the job market has completely gone online, and individuals are successful only if they are super specialists. The title is very apt: Its you that matters, not the company, not the city and not the industry.<br />Unlike many other career books, in this book; each topic is addressed in detail, yet succinctly. Congratulations to the authors for a job well done!
1451648537|5.0|Reading this biography of Steve Jobs, you will love him or hate him, though more likely a mixture of both. What you won't feel is indifferent. This guy was breathtakingly complex, contradictory, crazy, brilliant and all too often cruel. But the one thread that remains constant is his extraordinary vision, creativity and passion for excellence.<br /><br />Corporate bean counters take note: You don't have to sell junk and limit your vision to the next quarter to be profitable. This should be required reading in any business curriculum.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|The film has a special meaning to my husband and I as it came out when we were dating in 6th grade and was the first movie we saw together.  I purchased it as a date night idea for when he gets back from deployment and I've been watching it with the kids in the meantime.  Our 6yr old and 3yr old love it and I'm glad that it's the kind of movie in which they can watch and it doesn't have sex or foul language in it. I'm definitely happy with this purchase.
1250006341|5.0|My wife loves the Downton Abbey series on PBS so I bought her this book and an accompanying book, Lady Almina and the Real Downton Abbey, as a birthday present.  She loved it, saying it was one of the more thoughtful gifts I've given her.  She liked the historical content and beautiful photos and said it was well written.  I got a lot of points!
B004UJTG6Q|4.0|Mark Twain is, of course, one of America's own classic writers, which makes this book a should-read for anyone interested in American literature. Twain's characters are as engaging and endearingly real as they were when the book was written, and it is a window into one part of our country's past, a portrait, warts and all.<br />The formatting was a little confusing but not terrible, and who can complain about a free download? Each section had good indexing, which made it easier to find specific incidents within the story, a plus for a college student like me.<br />Overall, this is a great book at an unbeatable price.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I concur with all of the positive reviews.  Surprisingly fun and entertaining app.  Really impressed with the creativeness that went into this.  Great job!
B005LAIH3G|5.0|A magnificent movie..as a fan of ERB books, this movie brought the story to life.  Serious, humorous , tender, thrilling, and so much more.  A character driven film . Truly deserving of a sequel....BARSOOM...
B0071T5PN0|4.0|I hope they record ANOTHER album soon . This one is a good return , but I know the next album will be better ! Some good moments / songs on this release , but I was hoping for maybe just a bit more edge . Overall a worthy buy for any Van Halen fan . NOT my favorite , or even TOP 5 of the Van Halen albums , but I bought it & its growing on me . If you are into Guitar music , also check out the Guitar Album - Shredworx - here on Amazon Mp3

B002KKCXTE|1.0|I am concerned that this may be one of those \\"Read the fine print, or you might get screwed\\" situations.<br />I hope I am wrong, but be careful & thorough, just in case
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I downloaded this game on my kindle fire and it works just fine all u gotta do 2 get out of it is go 2 the stuff tab and hit options and it will let u leave fun and addicting game
B000AJIF4E|5.0|The sony MDR 7506 is the best headphone for this price. It is very precise and not too bassy unlike monsters beats models. It's great for FLAC files and reveals a lot from such compressed music. I think it is better to use them with a DAC/AMP. On the other hand, they are foldable so good to put in a bag and travel.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this game reminds me of a game called tiny village. I love both of these games. they are the best games ever
B005NKGEP2|2.0|I did not like this book and don't know what all the fuss is about for it. The story jumped around too much.  Just when I was finally getting into part of the story, it jumped either back in time or into the future and it made it confusing.  I thought the ending was horrible. All the secrets and lies and this is how the author chose to end the book? Really??  I had to give it 2 stars because Amazon wouldn't give me the option of 1.5.  Don't waste your money!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|I didn't start watching until season 2.  When that was over there was no question that I had to get the first season for the background...such a good decision.  I LOVE this dang show!!!  Great shipping time and condition as expected. Thank you!!!
1400032717|3.0|The story line is decent enough. I was able to identify with high functioning autistic characteristics of the young boy. However it seemed like every fourth word was an unnecessary cuss word, a bit much for my taste and the reason I didn't give it a higher rating.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book it was very hard for me to put the book down, the chemistary between Ana and Christian.
B0052U59F4|2.0|This book should be rated XXX.  Truly, it was an astonishing publication and totally unexpected.  I've never read a book like this and was totally dismayed at the content, with so much S&M in it.  It is a true degradation of women.<br /><br />We're living in an age where anything goes, and this book certainly lives up to that image.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|nice game. would be better if there were more ways to earn cash rather than having to buy it. otherwise its agood game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Hunger Games is an awesome book!  Made me want to read all 3!!!!  Finished all 3 in a week.  Recommend.
B00466HN6S|5.0|I had wanted the DVD in time for the Easter holiday.  It did arrive in plenty of time and in excellent condition.  It was enjoyed by the child who received it....
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is the most amazing book i have ever read! I am a huge Twilight fan and i have to say its better then twilight, cant believe i feel this way but its true. A must read for everyone!!!
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink really went ''deep'' with this album and showed the world she was no ''pop tart'' or Britney Spears clone. Instead of working with mainstream writers, she went old school and got Linda Perry; who until Pink brought her back was a NON FACTOR. This album was mostly writtn and produced by Dallas Austin, Pink, and Linda and the songs range from girl power ''Respect'' to self reflection ''Dear Diary'' to family issues ''Family Portrait''.<br /><br />My favorites are ''Gone to California'', ''Numb'', ''Just Like a Pill'', and ''My Vietnam.'' Overall, this is a classic pop/rock album and if you want to own a Pink album this is the one.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|My Core 2 Duo (E6750) system went down, and I didn't want to spend the extra bucks to replace it with another Intel setup.  So, I took a chance on this.  Well, this FX-4100 really works well.  The performance is slightly better than the Intel it replaced, and the whole thing (motherboard, processor and memory) cost less than I spent just for the Intel CPU 5 years ago.<br /><br />I played with overclocking a bit, got easily to 4Ghz, but took it back to stock.  It's plenty strong enough at 3.6Ghz.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Oh god how I LOVED this book!!!!!!!!!!!  Luaren Oliver is a GENIUS! I loved the entire book. From Lena's struggles in the wild to meeting Julian. At first I didn't like Julian. I thought, 'You are not Alex. Go away.' but he kinda grew on me. His innocence won me over. I loved Lena, though I think after six months of Alex dying she shouldn't have just moved on. I would have grieved for him for years, but that's my opinion. Overall, this book was beautiful, I loved the ending, though my god what a CLIFFHANGER!!!!!!  I was so mad that I had to wait a whole year to see what happens next. :( but still, the book was amazing. I like Delirium a bit more, but this book is definitely one of my favorite books of all time. I would give it 20 stars if I could. I LOVE  Pandemonium!!!!!!! & Lauren Oliver. Lauren Oliver is brilliant.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use evernote across many plateforms. I love it. I use it for business, personal, automation kof dada gathering, you name it evernote helps!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Total enjoyed the read, it was well written and I have now purchased the rest in the series as well.  She is a writer I will definitely follow!
B0068TL23G|4.0|I loaded this game on my new Kindle Fire and have had a lot of fun with it. It is very easy to learn, a 10 year old girl picked it up quickly on her own. It is quite challenging as you move through the levels.
