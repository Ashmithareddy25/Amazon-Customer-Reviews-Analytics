B00F3VOL38|4.0|This is the best way to listen to the Beatles. Playing live with out a lot of teens screaming in the back ground. I like the tracks that were never released in the USA.The only problem I had was it would not play in my parents CD/DVD player. It played in their car but not in the home unit. That's the reason for taking one star off.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|Our knowledge of what's happening with our bodies is changing.  This book is an important contribution to what many of us intuitively knew - that what we eat is the major factor in the function of this magnificent chemical factory called the human body.  The data is there, but we were not informed.  Thank you, Dr. Perlmutter.
1564029654|5.0|Very sweet story. One of my kids favorites. Now getting one for my niece's first child. I hope they will love it too.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The words flow in beautiful strokes of colorful scenes and feelings that at times absolutely astound you. The depths of feelings from cruelty and hate in Afghanistan to that of a father's and  mother's love and their need to survive. There is an ethereal flow that threads itself throughout his writing of siblings, their struggles, needs within a war torn life that can tear at your heart as it tears theirs. At times disorienting but always bringing you back with strong and poetic prose.
B000069AUI|5.0|Great album, i love Coldplay and i have all cd´s since the begining, i recommend this excelente cd for everyone !!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I loved this book.  It held my interest all the way through.  I did not want to put it down even to eat.  John Grisham's books are most always wonderful and this one managed to live up to my expectations for a easy, interesting read.  Can't wait for the next Grisham book.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very good game like that you can still play on and off line very easy even my almost 2 grand daughter loves this game all I hear til I let play on my tablet or phone is I play please
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|This is one of the best books I've had the pleasure to read this year. There was no senseless waffling or predictability. It kept me guessing right till the end.
B000GRUS22|5.0|Great album, i love enigma and i have all cd´s since the begining, i recommend this excelente cd for everyone !!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Lot of twists and turns I didn't expect.  Really enjoyed the book and didn't want to put it down.  Great book.
B00C74SHRK|3.0|There is something good about a novel that keeps you hooked despite the lead character being somewhat unsympathetic.  (I think I stayed because I wanted to find out what happened to the picture, mind you.)  There are lots of incidental pleasures, not least the conceit about the painting itself being involved in a second explosion.<br />But ultimately this struck me as Great Expectations extended to David Copperfield length, with bits of other Dickens novels thrown in (Hobie as a Cheeryble? Boris a manic Mark Tapley?).  This is a reasonable comment - there are lots of knowing Dickensian references, to an extent that feels intended.  And ultimately it doesn't work - there's a much shorter book in here struggling to get out.<br />The Las Vegas section is hugely overextended for the purpose it serves in the book, and the aggressive nihilism of the closing pages lost this review a star quite independently of anything else.<br />So, worth reading - Tartt always is - but seriously flawed.
0345803485|5.0|The book came quickly & it was in excellent condition. I browsed from my friend and decided to purchase for myself.. Excellent read.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|This soundtrack is amazing, in my opinion Hans Zimmer is a genius, all the tracks are great !!!<br />Amazing music for an amazing movie.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Despicable me: minion  rush is a great way for kids to see the best game of America. The game is a great way to get to see the way to run
B001BANK32|4.0|Stephen King remains one of the best story tellers out there.  His imagination soars out of the confines of this world and into a sea of mystery, intrigue, and fright.  How fun.  This was a re-read for me having first read this title many years ago.  Stephen King has recently published a follow up book and I wanted to refresh my memory before reading the sequel.  I recall the fright that shook my soul the first time around and now I've been shaken again.  The Shining is just a classic scary book and King is king at writing them.  So, if you've never read The Shining and you enjoy the scary mysterious stuff, you should order it without delay.  Then you'll be ready for &#34;Doctor Sleep.&#34;  Good luck!
B00594XOZU|1.0|Okay, i just. Love kik. I use it everyday. on my phone. On the kindle, let me clear things up. KIK NO LONGER EXISTS ON THE KINDLE. for  some reason, they deleted it. I love kik and i really wish i could use it on my kindle and. Not just my phone. Amazon, please bring back kik!!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|4.0|I like the game but its not the best game I have on my kindal fire. at leest its better then temple run 2!I really hate that game.
B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|&#34;the Debt&#34; is a troubling, but vital film. I have enjoyed Helen Mirren's performances for many years, but never has she shone as brilliantly as here. Her performance as the older Rachel Gold is nothing short of excelent! Her co-actor (Jessica Chastain) as the younger Rachel is equally good. Together they portray the character seamlessly. The other actors turn in great performances as well, especially Sam Worthington as the young David Peretz.<br /><br />the only problem that I had was that the names of the characters were pronounced as if they were living in England or the US, rather than in Israel as Israelis, even when the action was taking place in Israel and the characters speaking were supposed to be Israelis! ...but what can you expect from IGNORANT Goyim?????<br /><br />i can't recommend this film any higher- there's just no higher praise to give!!!
B00F57VFXO|5.0|I liked these books a lot.  The author got the feel of the time and place and his character was fun.  Kinda like Bond eh?
B00GHJ1S2M|5.0|The mixtures of beats are incredible especially with a great sound system. There is a variety of dance music, and very catchy versus.  I love Lady Gaga's creativity and vocals in Artpop.
B00CHNKJFO|5.0|The Balance Of the Force pack is as highly addicting as the Empire Strikes Back table. The in-game missions makes this game addicting as well. This is a must have for any Star Wars fan.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|what a great game, its addictive and fun. great time killer and rarely frustrating. I wouldst recommend this to anyone
0425252868|5.0|This is about Men! Their passion for not only their lives but for their enemies also! Could not put it down!<br />Can't wait for the movie
B00FVVR2ZO|4.0|It's a great game but I personally think that it should allow you to skip missions. I haven't let my daughter get a Facebook but she gets annoyed with the missions because all she wants to do is play the game but those missions are still in the way.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|A lot of limitations and few app, it drops connections every few minutes. My smart TV can do better youtube and Netflix without touching another device, better yet I can control them using TV remote. Returned it.
B004X2M9VY|5.0|I'm ready to board the TARDIS at a moment's notice. Tennant will always be my favorite Doctor, but Matt Smith grows on you.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be. The plot was kind of dry. I'm not giving up on Grisham yet.
B00008977N|5.0|Incredible performance by Peter Gabriel.  I watched the performances on this DVD dozens of times on YouTube until I sprung for the DVD for myself, and it was well worth it!  I'd buy it again and again.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a riveting novel with how the elements keep the reader fascinated to the very end. Beautifully written, wonderful character development, the best books I've read in a very long time.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|I never got to watch it. I would have had to sit up 'til  01:00 or so to watch it without burning up all of my download bars on Hughes Net. Don't think I'll be using this option much 'til you all figure out a way to let me download movies onto my computer to watch later. And, NO, I'm NOT gonna buy a Kindle Fire HD just to watch cheap movies!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Interesting legal mystery. Family dynamics, teen angst, legal drama.  Interesting to the last page. Something for everyone.  Worth the read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|addicted. I love this game.  I don't care for the nickel and dime features. it is fun and strategic too.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is very fun. The more armor 's you get the more things you can do. WARNING don't fall asleep when your game is downloading.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game! Rather than the normal chase of traditional games this one challenges you to deduce the next step. It is not for the faint of heart! If you love riddles and word puzzles this game is made for you.  At least give it a try. The only down side is that I have to periodically close the game to get it to move to the next step.  It does not get sovled quickly either. Have fun!!
B005HWAOCA|5.0|If you like Cream and I do,  then you will love this concert film.  Music,  music and more music.  All that full sound from the original three man power group.  The group that most musicians will admit that they copied.  Jack Bruce on bass, Ginger Baker on drums and Eric Clapton on lead guitar.  All of them super stars, hence Cream.
B00992CF6W|4.0|i like it but... it needs to be updated more make the animals breed!! that would be awsome! and add endermen and slimes and swamps and villagers and villages it would be cool if it was just like the really minecraft oh and add texture lacks and mods please
0763644765|5.0|My son loves this potty book.  It has simple words and pictures for him to understand.  He now reads the book to me and even wants to read it while sitting on the potty.  I got this book to introduce the potty to him a few months before he was even interested in the potty.  It was a much loved bedtime story and I think it paved the way very well and got him excited about using the potty for real.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|Works well. wish there was some way to tell when the batteries are getting low. I replace them (probably too often) just because I worry about dropping audio in the middle of filming.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Unless you are masterful at self-pleasure, only read this book if you have someone in your life.  I told my cousin to steer clear or she would be sleeping with the first man to smile at her.  If your relationship has gone stale, this will definitely spice things up.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|They are all here and magnificent !  This is another movie that makes you wish you had another to watch right after.<br />As with all Marvel movies, the action (both live and CGI) are excellent.  The storyline is superb, you never want for something to get your attention.  Captain America is brought into focus as the team strategist.  I particularly liked the way the Hulk was given a little intelligence there at the end.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Addictive when I do have time. But hate that I hit bombs so easy the bigger the shark. Would also like baby sharks a little cheaper.
0385537131|5.0|I have not read a book so interesting and compelling, in quite some time.  The story is fast moving, yet filled with character development. I was drawn to the book by the teaser on the flap, black maid left a fortune in a handwritten will, by a man who hangs himself. I've seen all of Grisham's movies, but this is the first of his books that I've read, and WOW!  I have told so many people that this is a must read, that I feel as though I am Grisham's publicist.  I was completely satisfied with the development of the story from beginning to its perfect end.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I could not put this book down.  Having started a family, and pregnant with my 2nd child, I don't have time these days to read a lot of novels.  I must have checked out of society for over a week to finish this trilogy. I spent every free moment I had reading this book.  So sad the author died.  He was an incredible story teller.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Just great ! There are so many 'favorite' scenes that I won't even try to point them out.  Action, drama, comedy, sadness, even a hint of love, this movie has it all.  good for all audiences. At the end you'll be wishing you had a sequel to put in the dvr. .
B007IXGUG0|5.0|Love drake. He's the best, so talented & brutally honest. You just can't deny real legitimate talent. Nice, relevant and verified.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|They sent me the 1st one and there was something defective in it as it kept frezing my computer up for 2-3 seconds and then release the freeze for about 30 seconds. Anker sent me another one as a replacement before I ever sent the defective one back! They did not bill me for the 2nd one. The replacement works perfectly. Their customer service could not be better, and product is wonderful. I just got a fluke on the first go around.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love Stephen King for his rock and roll sensibility and balls to the wall courage. As he said himself, he has to look under the bloody sheet and when he tells us what he sees we share his horror and it is awesome!
B00005V9IK|5.0|(With respects to 'Galaxy Quest') &#34;never give up-never surrender&#34; is the best way to describe Will Smith's character. Will nailed it !  He is 100% a man, (a huMAN) and a Marine.  Plenty of action, both cg, and live.  There is violence, but it is thoroughly justified by the aliens' actions.  The few swear words used were also justified and were NOT used to excess as most modern movie makers seem to think necessary.
B003EY7JH6|5.0|I have loved reading Isaac Asimov for over thirty years, probably closer to forty. I am now rereading the foundation books from the beginning again.
0385350864|4.0|It was definitely good.  The old Bridget Jones humor was still there, but some parts were a little depressing.  Overall, I'd recommend it if you don't mind shedding a few tears.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google as always has delivered!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Awesome, just the only thing is I want to do the whole screen CAST thing where not only the URL shows up but everything. Still overall this is great!
B001DHXT20|3.0|Yeah. it's okay, not as good as the Hulk is in The Avengers, but passable. The story stays fairly close to the TV series, although, the only obvious connection is Lou Ferrigno in a cameo (he can be a good actor, if given the chance).
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've always loved Stephen King books.  I've bought & read everyone I ever knew about.  Can't wait for the next one to come out.  This book is no exception.  Classic King!  I've started reading Joe Hill now and believe that his talent will surpass his dad's as he grows through the years.  Talented family!!
B00817RLWY|5.0|This was my introduction to Kurt Vonnegut, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I absolutely loved the dry humor and random tangents.  If you have an a appreciation for the brilliant weirdos of the world, then this is for you!  Great story.  Enjoy!
B00E981K1W|5.0|A great easy to read resource with practical tips and great examples.  Have already tried my first sketch note!!! While it was a little on the expensive side it was still well worth the cost.
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|This is an awesome app you should get it like right now seriously! I give this a ten out of ten in my opinion! It's also very addicting!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Product description leaves a lot to be desired. The unit will only work with a wireless signal using the Chrome web browser from a laptop with Wi-Fi or a cell phone app routed thru your wireless router, not IE or Firefox on a PC with a LAN connection. That in  and of itself boggles the mind. And even if you use Chrome, there is further detailed programming that needs to be enabled to get it to work. While I don't doubt it works, I gave up after 2 tries working with Google tech support because of my impatience with the product. I am a former communications tech with NEC who worked with VOIP the last 7 years of my employment before retirement and this is not user friendly when it comes to implementation. The dongle is not self-powered but needs to be connected to not only your TV's HDMI port but also to an attached transformer with a short power cord. Do yourself a favor and spend another $70 and get a Roku unit if your TV/DBD player doesn't have a streaming video feature.
B00BIPCY14|5.0|We cannot stop watching. Very addicting. We love the drama mixed with humor. We love all the characters. Very entertaining.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|I DELIGHTED IN THE EXPERIENCES OF THE CHARACTER AND LEARNED ABOUT DIFFERENT CULTURES. GILBERT LOVINGLY AND OPENLY SHARES LIFE  among people of all walks of life.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Have only read the first one so far, but very good with lots of plot twists.  Very believable, even with the fantastic elements.
B00BEF1AEK|3.0|The use of &quot;major&quot; here is used with full knowledge that this is a &quot;first world problem&quot;, but it annoyed me enough to write a review.<br /><br />There is no quit button.
B001AQO3QA|2.0|The picture is great. I just have no audio. My Bluray player is only two years old. What a hassle!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Bought this in the Amazon Warehouse for around $20.  I have a number of lens in it, camera body, charger, spare batteries, etc along with a number of Mini-DV tapes and a Canon video camera.  The thing I really like about this over a Canon or other branded products is that it looks like an &#34;Amazon Backpack&#34; and does not have &#34;Steal ME!&#34; written all over it like say a Canon or Nikon bag.  Of course it's never a good idea to leave a bag laying in a car or unattended but it may add a bit of security.
B00A50PDDY|5.0|Love this CD!!<br />If you like &#34;Holding on to You&#34; I'm sure you'll enjoy the rest of this CD<br />Tyler is a genius
B0028IDXDS|5.0|My little one loves his wubbanub!<br />It was so perfect when he was an infant because you can lay the animal on their chest and the paci wont fall out of their mouth when they stop sucking like other pacis so you don't have to put it back in their mouth 10 times in the middle of the night.<br />Now that he older he carries it around and its hard to lose.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is the best robot app I've ever played considering I haven't played any robot apps at all really cool peoples great app words
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Pacific Rim(released July/13)stars,among others,Charlie Hunnam,Idris Elba,Rinko Kikuchi,Charlie Day,Robert Kazinsky,Max Martini and Ron Perlman.It's a standard slam bam,thank you mam good against evil,humans VS aliens film.You have seen it all before,and done much better,but this one ramps it up with alot of S/Fx.<br />The story finds the Earth being invaded by creatures called the Kaijus,coming through a portal in the Pacific Ocean floor.The militaries of the world unite and fund a division to protect everyone.To do so they build Jaegars,giant 200-300ft.high robots,powered inside by two humans.The fight at first is seeing its share of victories,but after a while they start to lose ground.The head of the military consortium decides to pull the funding plug,and the Jaegars are no more than superfluous machinery.<br />Five years pass and one of the original Jaegar crew members has been working on a long wall stretching from Alaska down through California.He is tapped once more to join the Jaegars,whom it seems,have been covertly running the program without any official funding.Its new crew,with some smart egg heads,through experimentation and crunching the numbers,find that the frequency of the attacks is increasing exponentially.They also eventually find out that there is a mind behind the attacks and the beasts all have a hive mentality,run by this creature,or creatures,down in the portal.<br />They decide to go on the offensive,after some crucial battles,and drop a nuclear device into the portal and detonate it.Just as two Jaegars stand on the brink of the hole they are told that the portal will only recognize the signature of one of their own.Therefore neither can get the bomb to where it is supposed to be.They are attacked and during it one of the Jaegars is so damaged they have to self destruct.The other drags a dead Kaijus with it and into the hole where they enter the portal successfully.Inside both crew members eject out of the Jaegar before it too detonates its nuclear core,thereby destroying the portal and the creatures.The film ends with the reuniting of the two crew persons on the surface.<br />I found the film well acted generally speaking and it was a pleasant surprise to see Ron Perlman as the black marketeer in Hong Kong.The Jaegar machines are similar in stature and look to the Transformers,while the creatures are similar in shape and size to the one in the most recent Godzilla film.However if you are at all familiar with director Del Toro's works,then think weird variations on the Godzilla theme.I did find some easily spotted poor editing in this film.One instance is when one of the Jaegar egg heads is talking to a crew member.The shot is from behind him,and what he is saying is not matching his mouth.Its a kind of thing I expect to see in far older movies where they thought you wouldn't pay that much attention to the mouth when shooting from behind.Another badly edited spot is where Raleigh talks to Mako after a hard battle asking her if she is alright.Trouble is his mouth isn't moving!?As with any Del Toro film he has a story to tell and this one is no different.He will tell it come hell or high water,no matter how much detail he has to go into.This one is full of detail which includes lots of personal conflicts and back stories.Depending on how much you can stomach,will determine how much you like this film.Del Toro hopes his S/FX will hide the shortcomings.And coming in at considerably over two hours,that's a lot to try and hide.<br />Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:78:1 and is clear and crisp.This one disc edition has only commentary for an extra.<br />All in all a not bad entry by Del Toro with good S/Fx and good acting,but its length takes its toll as Del Toro insists on giving us every little detail he can dredge up.3 stars.its nuclear core,thereby destroying the portal and the creatures.The film ends with

B0051HNMTI|1.0|Even though I have the paid version, this app requires that you have an internet connection AND be signed in to Amazon's app store.  I have no internet connection in my gym with my phone so I can't use the app.  The app also frequently crashes and needs to be killed with task manager on my Samsung Galaxy SII.  The workouts included in this app are pretty good but the app itself is terrible.

B00CUKTG2Q|4.0|When we last heard from Franz Ferdinand, they released the excellent \\"Tonight\\" album, reportedly a departure from the 'classic' FF sound but not really all that different (but for the \\"Lucent Dreams\\" track), followed shortly thereafter by the dub-remix album \\"Blood\\", a curious stand-alone release. Now 4 1/2 years later, we finally get the band's 4th studio album (5th if you count \\"Blood\\").<br /><br />\\"Right Thoughts Right Words Right Action\\" (10 tracks; 34 min.) is front-loaded with killer songs, starting off with the title track (1st UK single), about as good and classic as anything the band has done. It is followed by \\"Evil Eye\\" (3rd UK single), another delicious slice of FF. Then comes \\"Love Illumination\\" (2nd UK single), a hard-charging tracks that's another bull's eye strike. Wow. Those 3 tracks alone are worth buying the album. \\"Stand On the Horizon\\" starts off deceivingly slow and intimate but then turns into another romper. The first half concludes perfectly with \\"Fresh Strawberries\\". The second half kicks off with \\"Bullet\\", another winner. \\"Treason! Animals\\" sounds great, containing great lyrics like \\"I'm in love with a narcissist/I know for the mirror told me\\", ha! The later tracks do steer a bit left of center (including a lite-reggae \\"Brief Encounters\\") but still resonate quite well.<br /><br />In all, this is a fantastic 'come-back' album after being so long away, and confirms the band's status as one of the better remaining 'indie' bands from way back when (hard to believe that FF has been around for 10 years now). I've seen FF in concert a number of times over the years, and can only hope I'll have a chance to see how these new songs resonate in a live setting. Meanwhile, \\"Right Thoughts Rights Words Right Action\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love this series. I love the actors, story, and historical details. I am trying to watch the past seasons to be ready for the new season that is coming up.
B00000JZI9|5.0|I really love Kevin Costner in &#34;Silverado&#34; -- he's so joyful and playful in his role -- but then everyone seems to be having a good time.  The film has lots of humor, plenty of drama, and some fine action set pieces.  It's just plain fun.

B006G3JQ78|5.0|The kids loved it as much as we did when we were children! Wonderful story and a great message. Classic Disney.
6305127646|3.0|Val Kilmer and Elizabeth Shue are fun to watch in &#34;The Saint&#34;, but movie is all-over-the-place and full of nonsensical plot twists and incredible (as in &#34;begging credibility&#34;) behavior.  Worst of all, it has none of the flair, elegance, sexiness, or excitement of the books, or even the Roger Moore t.v. series.  In fact, it's &#34;The Saint&#34; in name only.  Even if one ignores the fact that this bears no resemblance to the character in the books, it's still a mediocre action thriller.

B00CNIDH7A|5.0|Saw Train perform in Phoenix this summer (August 2013 at Ak-Chin Pavilion), and they were FANTASTIC live!  Pat Monahan and clan were engaging, and their energy was very positive.  The quality of their performances make me want to buy tickets to see them perform whenever I can...  I saw them before purchasing this CD, and I can't believe I waited two and a half months before finally purchasing it.  (The CD was sitting in my Amazon cart since the night I returned from the concert.)  I love almost every song on this disc (I don't care for the song &#34;You Can Finally Meet My Mom&#34; at all!  Most songs that feature whistling drive me batty- I don't know why!), and I only skip maybe one studio song and one or two live songs (but only because the audio quality isn't great).  I also only recently noticed scratches in the area of one of the songs I usually skip over... I don't know how these scratches came about, and how long they've been there, since I do skip that song every time...<br />I really enjoyed learning the lyrics and the rhythms to the songs-- the CD comes with lyrics included!  Not very many CDs made now come with lyrics, which I feel is a shame.  -starlightjulian.yelp.com

1439156816|5.0|This engaging book was both biographical and educational, and is a must-read for those who aspire to write, or who like to daydream about writing a book someday.  I found it very entertaining, as well as illuminating!  -starlightjulian.yelp.com
B008JFUPK8|2.0|Movie is very good. Ultraviolet is TERRIBLE.  Amazon sells this as a multi format product, but the Ultraviolet digital copy does not work with iTunes.  Do not buy this if you expect to play on your iPad.  The Flixster app is terrible (don't take my word--read the reviews) and no sound comes through.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|like the storyline, like the actor, but I cant replace Jason bourne in my mind when I watch this. sorry, avoid this one and get the hurt locker if you are a renner fan, h
B004UA8D1O|5.0|This is one of them movies that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat. Recommend this one!!!
1250029465|5.0|This was an enjoyable book; a wonderful story of bonding and love between two different species and how they both benefited from this connection.
B007A4SDCG|4.0|If you DO NOT deal with inner resistance then this book will seem pointless. Hence the bad reviews. So before buying ask yourself something along the lines of:<br /><br />'What can I do that will get me started with something that I really want to do?'<br /><br />If after asking this you're finding reasons why to not do it then you should read this book. Because you're probably sabotaging yourself without realizing it.<br /><br />4 stars instead of 5 because the author makes some bold claims that don't really add up. Like Social Anxiety Disorder is make believe. And People finding out they are going to die in 6 months of cancer, then doing what they want to do and having their cancer go into remission. But it's still a amazing book. I think the author was just a little overzealous.
B00371V6SE|4.0|An easy read, I found myself reading chapter after chapter losing track of time. A typical Nicholas Sparks novel filled with love & drama.
0399159347|5.0|This was an excellent book which stimulated discussion of ethics and life choices; it was very well written, very interesting, readable, and attention maintaining throughout. It is now set aside to share with my daughter.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I am giving this book a 2 out of 5 stars primarily because I absolutely hated the ending of this book.  I have been a fan of the Divergent Trilogy to this point, and to be fair it is more a 3 star book.  I think it still came short of the first two books in the series.<br /><br />**Spoiler Alert**<br /><br />I believe Ms. Roth did Tris justice in the valiant and selfless way she acted, and that the message is a good one.  However, why do you end a story with so much pain and sorrow when there is more than enough of that to go around in our daily lives?  The same message could have been portrayed with a happy ending.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I've been waiting forever for Castleville to come to my kindle! Use to be my favorite game on Facebook but my computer stunk so stopped playing only use my kindle now. Happy to have it back!

B004XVN1T4|4.0|Ken Follett is a master story teller and Triple is a damn fine story. Triple takes you on an incredible voyage from New York to Cairo to the high seas. Then it tells you of loves lost and loves found and of battles between good vs. bad. You get all that plus the ambiance of a spies life and the double crosses all delivered in true Follett-speak.

B00F91RYL8|2.0|This movie seemed to be a vehicle to showcase brad pit, but was lacking in plot. Characters were quite shallow.  Brad Pitt's character was the only character that seemed to have any development (he did a fine job).  Lots of zombies, and an improbable cure.  Not worth the time spent.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|Coming from someone who is going through divorce, wish I would have read this years ago. Many of the authors examples were very similar to my own personal experiences. Good read for anyone, married or not.

B00ELOOYZI|4.0|This is a fun, well thought out and well done game. Not 5 stars, as it is simple, really, so I don't see myself playing this instead of larger games, but totally worth buying and playing nonetheless.
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|I got this album about a year ago but I decided to do a review now. This is my favorite album by her it has party songs but also has beautiful graceful mature songs. My favorite song on the album is Give Your Heart A Break it's such an amazing upbeat song that makes you wanna sing and dance. Skyscraper and fix a heart are really good emotional songs that put me to tears and give me chills. Over all this is a perfect album. #lovaticforlife
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|More Pendergast, please!  I have read and enjoyed every one of the Pendergast stories. Each is unique and contains one of the most interesting characters ever in fiction, Agent A. Pendergast.  I had pre-ordered this and was so thrilled when I got the message that it was available.  It went so quickly that I would like to suggest a longer novel for Preston & Child next time.  I won't list this as one of my favorite of the 13 Pendergast novels, mainly because Corrie Swanson seems to be the main character in this story with Pendergast going in and out of the storyline, but every Preston & Child fan should read it!  How long must we wait for more Pendergast??
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|how I fond it is I played on my dad phone and he had this game I played it it was fun I got it on my kindle I loved it I got to a big level hope you like it to.
B00BLSJI80|5.0|This album is perfect. It's my second favorite of hers because unbroken I have to say is a little better. My favorite and most overplayed tracks from this album are \\"Heart Attack\\" \\"Really Don't Care\\" \\"Neon Lights\\" and \\"Warrior\\".
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I was truly moved after reading this book. I highly recommend this book to anyone searching for a heroic story.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is an addicting game for me.  I enjoy that the boards change and become more challenging as the game progresses.  Wish you could earn more bonuses to get through the more challenging boards.
B008JFUPK8|3.0|This has NOTHING to do with the movie it self. It has to do with the content the studio is giving us on the Blu-ray and DVD's. The movie was great and I give it 4 1/2 stars. It was so much better than &#34;Superman Returns&#34; and had better acting, effects and story line. The only things I found redeeming about Bryan Singers creepy Stalker-Superman version (he should have stuck with &#34;X-Men: The Last Stand&#34; or that wouldn't have sucked as bad as it did) was that not only did he load the Blu-ray with tons of extras including 10 additional scenes, but he also cast Parker Posey in the film which made it slightly more entertaining.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the film but over the past several years, I've noticed a rather upsetting trend taking place with home DVD/Blu-ray releases. This &#34;Man of Steel&#34; states &#34;NEARLY 4 HOURS OF SPECIAL FEATURES&#34; and while I've watched all the special features on the Blu-ray disc (and I'm not sure if any &#34;special features are on the DVD) and began watching the features on the second Blu-ray, I started to wonder, &#34;Where are the deleted scenes?&#34; There are features about how the actors got beefed up, one about the costumes and another (fairly annoying) feature about CGI which is hosted by the kid who played the young Clark Kent.<br /><br />I always recalled being excited when the DVD's were released because they were loaded with extras (always a director commentary sometimes with actors weighing in), out takes, bloopers, theatrical trailers, the making of features that had aired on HBO, MTV or other stations and more.<br /><br />The first time I really took notice was when &#34;Evita&#34; was released on DVD in 1997. While not the massive hit the studio hoped for, it did bring in over $140 million in ticket sales, won an Oscar and 3 Golden Globes for Best Song, Best Picture and Best Actress. There were no extra features on the DVD (given the many documentaries made by HBO and MTV and the the history of Eva Peron herself). In 2012, a &#34;15th ANNIVERSARY EDITION&#34; Blu-ray was released and it contained &#34;The Making of Evita&#34;, Music Video of &#34;You Must Love Me&#34; and Teaser Trailer. The Laser Disc version of this film contained not only the &#34;The Making of&#34; and the music video, it also contained director commentary, shooting scripts, sketches, production photos and archive video and photos of Eva and Juan Peron. That's a lot of stuff that people may want to see.<br /><br />It was about this time that I began replacing my VHS collection with DVD's. Some offered never before seen footage and behind the scene footage which was really neat. As more movie trailers were released, I started to notice that many scenes shown in the trailer weren't in the theatrical release at all nor did they show up on the DVD and the expanding market of Blu-ray discs. The last time I recall a set of movies released with alternate beginnings/endings, alternate takes, deleted scenes and almost everything under the sun were contained in the box sets for the first 3 &#34;Scream&#34; movies and &#34;The Red Curtain Trilogy (Strictly Ballroom, Romeo+Juliet and Mouliln Rouge!).<br /><br />Since that time, I've seen studios release multiple versions of the same movie. My last count for &#34;Marvels The Avengers&#34; were 5 different versions NOT including the 10 Disc Set of the Phase One movies.&#34;X-Men: First Class&#34; did a decent job of  adding some deleted scenes, but perhaps the most disappointing releases came with the last 3 bond films. To get the best bang for your buck is to buy the 3 Disc Special Edition DVD or the 2 Disc Collectors Edition with BD-Live of &#34;Casino Royal&#34; (there are currently 5 different versions of this film as well.) And as for &#34;Skyfall&#34;, the top grossing Bond film of all time? Not one deleted scene. The biggest disappointment I've had this year was the &#34;World War Z&#34; Blu-ray. I've been a fan of the book since it was released, I even have the 12 hour audio book which is very entertaining. Even though the movie and the book have nothing but the title in common, for a movie that took 2 years to film it was treated worse than a B rate horror flick that was never released in the theater.<br /><br />So back to &#34;Man of Steel&#34; and the lack of extended/deleted/alternate scenes, maybe I just bought the wrong copy? But with over 10 different editions and packaging for this movie alone, I have to just take a guess that no scenes were cut from the film and that there was no alternate or extended scenes. Maybe they thought they shot a perfect movie?<br /><br />On that note, I'm still trying to decide which Blu-ray of &#34;The Avengers&#34; to buy. I don't need 3D, but I would like to see things like the making of the film and yes...those deleted scenes I'm in dire search of. Can anyone let me know which one would be best to buy?<br /><br />If you're looking for the movie of &#34;Man of Steel&#34; and some interesting behind the scenes footage, than this is fine. But if you're in hope of seeing deleted scenes, there are none to be found.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|It's a great app since you don't already have a recorder,and if you use other apps for this, they don't even pull up, they just crash.
1476729085|4.0|When applying science to relationships there's always a strong possibility of a completely unforeseen outcome.  These are the results Professor Don Tillman discovers.  Don is an extremely intelligent person.  He's what you would call book smart with his street smarts lagging woefully behind.  He doesn't know how to interaction with others and has a hard time relating to most people.<br /><br />Rosie is a breath of fresh, new air in Don's life.  She breaks down his preconceptions of what traits he must have in a wife.  She is the catalyst that brings about Don's transformation and she does it all while simply being herself.  Rosie was a lot of fun, especially when interacting with Don.  It was funny to see his confusion with regards to Rosie.  He doesn't expect to enjoy spending time with her, they have absolutely nothing in common, or so he thinks.  Their relationship is written in a way that is perfectly believable as it develops into a romance.<br /><br />Don is someone who can easily becoming that annoying person you try to avoid at all costs.  He's an odd duck but as the story progresses Don becomes more than the computer like genius he was in the beginning.  The changes may seem small, he still maintains his high intelligence, but those changes have a profound affect on his life.<br /><br />The Rosie Project is an amusing look at one man's search for a mate.  It's a perfect example of the phrase \\"God laughs when you make plans\\".  Professor Don Tillman makes numerous plans but learns that some of the best things in life are the things you don't plan for.<br /><br />Rating: B+
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Awful. Awful. Awful. Stop at book two. Trust me. It's like she had no idea what she wanted to write, so she threw all her ideas into one book. I hope if the movie series goes this far, that they change the screenplay completely from the book to finish things off.
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|I love this story and love this movie. Mr Darcy is amazing and so dreamy! You will fall in love!
1439153663|4.0|Lavinia is a white indentured servant from Ireland living with the slaves on a plantation in the Kitchen House.  Growing up around the slaves, they eventually become her family.  Eventually though, she is exposed to the fact that she is considered to be different than her adopted family due to the color of her skin.  Moving from the kitchen house to the big house, Lavinia uncomfortably straddles two worlds, exposing the best and the worst in people along the way.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the story and became emotionally invested in the characters right away.  This isn't a happy story, so some people won't like it.  I felt though, that the conflict was arresting and made it so I got even more into the story as I really cared about what happened to the characters.  True, some of the characters seemed to be very rote characters (Rankin as the horrible plantation manager has nothing to set him apart), but the main characters do have a depth to them that draws you in.<br /><br />Do I believe this story accurately represents the time period?  Or that it is a perfect historical fictions book?  No.  So if you are someone who needs things to be completely accurate, you probably won't like this.  But I just read it more as a fiction book very loosely put in a time period and really thought the story was interesting enough that I didn't mind the digressions from the reality of the era.
B0084AZXKK|3.0|Years ago I read Treasure Island and enjoyed the adventure.  This read  proved less  ..rewarding ..  less stimulating... a product of my age perhaps!
B001HN6EF4|5.0|Great for on the boat (which is what we bought it for). Do not have to worry about them getting wet!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this book because I love the possessive guy and all the problems that come with it. This book was happy, sad, funny and parts that made me anxious. These are the qualities that make a great story. The ONLY thing I didn't like was the incredibly stupid name he gave her. As if Pigeon isn't bad enough to call a girl, he called her Pidge!! Out of all the things in the world he could've called her, this was so lame.
B00AWFEBDK|3.0|The idea is good, but the author should have used a good editor.<br />Now several ideas are repeated twice or more, without adding extra information
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Horribly written - I've heard the author took it off the internet - and not even sexy. Not worth the cash. I cannot believe they're making it into a movie. This is all about $$$$$$. Don't buy it!
B00AZKCU7G|4.0|I bought this for the hubby. He likes these type of movies. I did not watch it since it was very long and not my thing. He claims that it was good, but not as good as he expected. So.... it was watched once, then sits on the shelf type thing lol.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Extremely fun but has many different puzzles to solve.  You will start the book over if you go over the time.  You should be able to get through it after a few times.  I did not mind it but be warned they are whit harder each time.  Azada 2 next.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I am addicted to playing this game.  So much more fun then the old fashioned Solitaire and the Hard & Higher levels are quite challenging
B008D36INE|1.0|Oh my god this director went friggin NUTS with the violin music.  I'm only ten minutes into the movie and I don't think I can keep going.  The music is too loud and melodramatic.  It is incredibly distracting and it takes away completely from whatever the actors were trying to do.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great app everyone should get it. Took me to long to do it . Need more updates. Take to long for new lives.
B00F56AZK4|5.0|Really enjoy this app. I've been wanting another brain challenge game, and this one fills the bill. I love being able to adjust how many pieces according to who is using it and how much time I have. I recommend it for anybody.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I think that twitter is an awesome app and every one needs to get it soooooooo go get ur self s twitter
0385523394|3.0|3 1/2 stars...This book gave a very good description of a woman's prison camp - not a jail or a prison, but a prison camp. There are definate differences between the three. Although all three lean toward rules and regulations, a prison camp allows more freedoms and opportunities than the other two. Kerman does give glimpes of life in a jail and a second hand account of being locked in a prison, but her experience was almost exclusively in the prison camp. There are guards in all three places for a variety of reasons, not all of which is for the profit, comfort, or rehabilitation of the prisoner. Kerman spoke about this type of prison guard, although her experience was pretty run of the mill because she was there to do her time, and not to create problems. Kerman was repaying her debt to society years after the fact, and at 35 yrs old was petrified to be incarcerated. Due to the helping hand of many of the people she profiles in her book, she adjusted well to life in the camp. Her sentence - relatively short in comparison to those she became close to - went by without a lot of problems until weeks before her &#34;out&#34; date, when she got the shocking full effect of time in a large city jail. Kerman had a lot of friends, family and a fiance' who helped to keep her sane during her incarceration, although the loss of a loved one brought out the realism of her situation. Written in an open, honest way, Kerman gives the details of her incarceration in Danbury Connecticut's woman's federal correction facility during her 15 month imprisonment.
B00CEF014E|5.0|After I read through this whole book. I just can't put this book down. I have to read until the end of this book. If you want to read and feel exciting at the same time. You need to grab this book. I recommend it. The author wrote this book with exciting story, well-organized, well-written and great characters. I'm looking forward for next book. :)

'once a blochead, always a blockhead' love you guys. now that my dream nr 1 has come true, I start to dream that one day you'll come to Finland. I'll be standing in the first row-crying- just like in 90's.

B008CX2A2I|4.0|Unit works great, but only one device can be synced at a time. User has to &#34;pair&#34; for each device every time the device changes.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|I even hate the name of this movie  what a poor choice for a title  I been to White House & I hate seeing it blown up or portrayed in disrespectful manner like this just so some overrated actors and producers can make money. The movie is farce  and big joke played on movie goers. Do your self a favor  wait until Black Friday you will more than likely find it in bargain baskets at  the local box stores.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Veronica Roth knows how to finish a trilogy.  Although many readers will be upset by this book, it truly is a solid ending.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Overall, a thoroughly enjoyable, solid album. I always felt that The Fame, The Fame Monster, and Born This Way all had a track our two that simply didn't work for me. Not so with Artpop. While there may not be a breakout grand slam, Gaga's Artpop offerings are all fun, enjoyable, and deserving of plenty of replay time.
B00AESN8XY|1.0|I bought this game, but it says I don't own the app! I can't do anything, it was a waste of money!
B00G4PX1MO|5.0|I spent many happy hours playing the original Kingdom Rush and was so excited to see Frontiers come out for Kindle. Frontiers has been a tiny bit disappointing as it doesn't seem quite as challenging as the original. But still so much variety and great characters, like the giant worm that comes up from the desert to swallow you unexpectedly.<br /><br />On a side note, typing this review on my Kindle fire hd has been an exercise in frustration - this is the worst keyboard ever!
B008YRVW0I|3.0|Just another game contrived to make you spend money. Most of more interesting items cost cash. Cute idea but if you say it's free then it should be all free.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Candy Crush is addictive. fun. and challenging!  You will get hooked! The levels get harder and harder and are sometimes very hard to beat! I like that you can ask friends for a life or extra moves! Enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Just another game contrived to make you spend money. Most of the higher levels are very difficult to complete without help. I did it because I am stubborn and if you say it's free then it should be all free.
1400034205|5.0|I had previously read \\"of human bondage\\" by  the same author and liked it so much that I thought I would give this a try. I'm  very glad I did, this book has the same near perfect prose and deep yet accessible musings on life and it's possibilities. There are a few main characters and their various searches are what drive the story so for simplicity's sake i'm  going to list them. Firstly Larry who spends his life in pursuit of spiritual goals after being traumatised in the first world war. Although he never amounts to much in worldly terms gaining no money or career status one can't help but think his life a success. Isabel dedicates her life to the much more conventional  goals of family and financial security and the jury is out as to wether her life is worth living or not. Sophia destroys herself with alcohol and drugs because she cannot deal with tragedy and Elliot fritters his life away on social vanity but still has a good soul deep down.<br />Watching these brilliantly realised characters journey imperfectly through their lives is such a richly rewarding reading experience. This would be one of the best books I've read in years and I think I will read it again at some point in the future.
0761129235|5.0|Good advice when feeling overwhelmed with a big project.  Sage advice as to breaking things down into small steps in order to accomplish a lot.  I did get my doctorate that way,  while I raised two children and worked full time. Would have been motivating if I had read this back then. It is helpful even now that I am retired and having to repair our house that didn't get attended to during that busy time! Kids turned out great though and house can be repaired one step at a time using this method! I gave copies to my kids.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|A little slower then the last book.  It was really good, the only thing I did not like was how it ended.  It was a good and bad ending to me.  I wish it ended different.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Very Short but a good story, open end for a sequel... Hoping, even though he rarely does that.  Would make a good graphic novel as well.

0345803450|3.0|Not my favorite McEwan novel.  Atonement and Saturday set the bar very high.<br />I always find spy novels difficult, and this was no exception.  The short stories<br />and novel within the novel approach made it interesting.
B00EHAIHWM|4.0|I like it much more than other stuff I've heard this year. It's poppy enough to be catchy but heavy to keep my attention. Worth the eight bucks.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|yes! was so happy to see that candy crush saga the official app. is avaliable for the kindle. it is a fundamental game that challenges one to think as well. after much anticipation &amp; talk about this great game from fam &amp; friends, now i'm in the addictive crowd lol. it just loses that one star for level 23 being almost impossible to beat, only allowing players to have 5 lives &amp; not enuff moves on some real extremely difficultly levels. other than that  &quot;i like candy. i want candy, crush that is lol.&quot;
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I do love the Fifty Shades of Grey books! They are amaZing and interesting to read. ...I would definitely read them again

B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|With trappings of Arthur Conan Doyle and an adventure spanning a Colorado ski resort town and Hampstead Heath in Britain, Preston and Child weave what is clearly the best tale in the Pendergast canon yet.  Corrie Swanson - introduced in Still Life With Crows - shares the stage with AXL Pendergast as she works to solve the 100+ yr old mystery surrounding the death of some miners by a rampaging grizzly.  Patented Preston/Child pacing, action, and interesting characters woven throughout with classic Pendergast bon mots make this a complete thrill ride that you don't want to end.  Major bonus points for a tale within a tale that is so spot on it elicited a squeal from me.  I can't wait to see where they take me next.  But wherever that is, I'll be queued up day one.  You should be too.
140006922X|5.0|This well researched book that reads like a novel has answered persistent q jest ions that I have had concerning the New Testament. Groundbreaking;.notfor the narrow-minded, for sure.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|The thinly disguised truth with a great fictional story. Couldn't put it down. This brought back all the interest of the older Preston/Child novels. Take that Aspen!
B000X2H8G4|1.0|the cord is so short that I had to buy an extension cable to have any hope of this helping my mother hear the tv, with or without her hearing aids in.  she can carry on conversations just fine with her hearing aids, so she isn't totally deaf.  In the beginning, it did seem to help a little bit, but then just stopped working altogether.  Also, it seemed to go through batteries very quickly.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was an awesome read. How the author made up such a world, I will never know. I can't wait to read the next one!
B004Y8Y26C|2.0|I love The Chemical Bros but not so much this one.  Many songs are very short & were probably excellent in the movie, but this did not make for good general listening pleasure, IMO.
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|its a scarey move to sit with your love one to watch.its one of the better movies i have seen in some time
B006LSZECO|3.0|A little slow to start, but once it does, it's hard to put down.<br /> Can't wait for the next installment.
111846446X|5.0|Mine was bought for me, sadly not via Amazon but via an outside vendor. It is perhaps one of the more important books for the widget. It was what I turned to first when starting to work with my device. I'm giving the Five Stars and 64 individual penguins for it.
B003G4W49C|5.0|The story was intelligently, yet sympathetically written. Ender is every reader. I don't see how the movie could possibly be as good.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|A very awesome game I love playing it in my free time. I also loved the movie when it came to theaters.
B00BC254I8|5.0|It was a good read.  I read a lot of these kind of biographies and this might have been the craziest.  He's more honest than you often see in these kind of books too.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Great DVD, my Dad loved it!  Lots of great celebrities played this concert.  Highly recommended for Beatles or George Harrison fans.
B008K8U13K|1.0|This game isn't that great. The controls are irritating and tedious. Not worth the cash. Spend your money on something else.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Terrific book. I recommend for tech geeks and those who are ordinary (like me). it involves problem solving in computer avatars that translates to the real world.
B004G5ZXVQ|2.0|You should know that I've loved this band for the last 15 years. I think all of their records are excellent (including Up and Around the Sun). I really think that losing Berry forced them to focus to keep evolving as artists. Up was different than New Adventures, Reveal different than Up, and so forth. Accelerate was good given that it was a 180 from ATS (which I loved), but not great.<br /><br />This album however, in my honest opinion, is terrible. It really sounds like leftovers from the last record. The main reason being Stipe's embarrassingly bad lyrics. The \\"rock\\" sound is decent but without the thought provoking and deep lyrics present on all of their previous albums, the songs just come off as cheesey. Oh My Heart and Walk It Back may be the only fine points on the record. Anytime a band prefaces an album release by stating they're returning to their roots, the results are never good (i.e. Stadium Arcadium, St. Anger, Pearl Jam's Backspacer, Jane's Addiction's Strays). Tom Waits and Nick Cave have never tried to rehash the past because they know moving forward is the only way to keep their music relevant and unique.<br /><br />I think that people may be a little biased given this was a rock album and (sadly) their \\"swan song\\". Bottom line, I just do not see this as a quality album, let alone an R.E.M. quality one.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|Nicely written book, can't wait to read more of her books.  New author for me, and was impressed by her work
B00992CF6W|5.0|This a really good game fun and addicting worth all the money<br /> Just wish they would make it more like the computer version or  add more updates other than that 5 stars : ) : ) : )
B002N1AF7C|4.0|An album from back a number of years. Good to listen to, but to dance to, not so much, at least for myself.
B008RXYOKY|3.0|Bummer that 99% of Macs don't have firewire, and audio interfaces and HDDs among few others use firewire still (as it is much faster than USB). However, there are two types of firewire. Firewire 400 and 800. I got the wrong size, and I guess they don't make another size adapter, so I would need two adapters for one device - not worth it. Waste of money. Better off buying components that are thunderbolt or just USB.
B00004XQ83|5.0|If you liked the movie, you had to enjoy the music. All the songs are great to listen to. And, of course, Man of Sorrow has to be the best.
B00GD9F59S|5.0|It took me a while to finish the final book in the covenant series because I didn't want it to end. Alex, Aiden, and Seth have been such amazing and relatable characters that I could guiltlessly put off any thing and get lost in their world and wish they were real, but the story had to inevitably end and I would have to say my goodbyes. Sentinel was what I can only describe as the perfect middle ground for an ending of a series, with it not having everything turn out perfect and good and not having it end with you crying or empty either. I won't spoil any thing but if your a fan of the series you can rest a sure that JLA did a justly and remarkable ending.
B000002NHN|5.0|Loreena Mckennitt continues to do some very interesting songs in her style of music. You should enjoy it like her other albums.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I highly recommend it. It grabs your attention from the first to the last word. Really looking forward to more.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Neil Young does a great job with this album. Every song is Neil Young at his greatest. You will enjoy it.
B005723JSQ|4.0|So I missed a lot of this story because of the bizarre footnotes. I read right over the numbers, my brain doesn't even see them when I read! So I probably missed the humor in the story, but it was still a good read
B001F7AXKE|5.0|What a great book. History of the times in Paris dealing with the elimination of the Jews in 1942 that will shock you. The author is a great writer. You may get thrown off a little in the first couple of chapters as the author changes story positions on you. But, get past those first few chapters and she has it all coming together for you.
1476727651|5.0|I'll keep this review very short and spoiler-free. This is the best King novel since his accident. If he continues on his present trajectory (11/22/63, Joyland, Doctor Sleep) he will soon be writing at the level of brilliance he possessed before being hit by the van. Even his recent low-point (Under the Dome) was much better than his post-accident nadir (Cell).<br /><br />As an aside, has any author used the word &#34;rube&#34; more times in a two-book span than King did in Joyland and Dr. Sleep?! :)
B000063WDH|5.0|For just two guys, The Black Keys know how to make music. A great album to listen to. Alternative Rock at its best.
B00BXLU1EU|1.0|It is a hoax software that leads you to believe it can do wondrous things, but it fails to deliver!
B000051Y0G|5.0|This album is all Cyndi Lauper. She is a crazy performer doing fun things. This album shows her at her best.
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|This is a completely captivating tale. I am a documentary lover, but this is one of those movies which shakes you to your core and lingers in your thoughts for days or weeks after being watched, haunting you.<br /><br />Tilikum's story is tragic, but the story focuses on more than just this one whale, in these tragic strings of events.<br /><br />I think there is something relatable here - a  lesson that can be brought away for anyone who watches.
B000QUCPWU|3.0|Bought this CD for the song 'Green Onions'. The rest of the songs are good, but still Green Onions is the best.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app and I was addicted to survival mode ps. I beat the whole survival mode it is awsome
B001UTW7QU|5.0|It is a very funny and thrilling si-fi like show that my husband and I really enjoy watching. We really like Dr. Bishops humor. Overall I would and do recommend it for others to watch.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Fun game. It helps pass the time. I wish there was a wider variety of mini games though.  The storyline is cute.
B0010OMXKA|5.0|Bocelli is a master at sharing his heart through his voice.  I think the world would be a better place if everyone could hear him sing.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This was a fantastic continuation of the story of Danny's life after the events at The Overlook Hotel.  After having been disappointed by Under The Dome I was afraid this was going to be a pathetic latch on to The Shining that would damage my memories of the original.  It most definitely was not.<br /><br />Simply put it was King doing what King does best and that is pulling the reader in so that the characters come alive and really begin to mean something to you.
B000007MVX|1.0|Listened to this &#34;rubbish&#34; recently and remembered the time, years ago, when I was excruciatingly disappointed by this strange and out of place Tull album.<br />I was and remain a fan of Tull. In concert back in '78, I was blown away, totally sober btw.<br />But Passion Play belongs to a different category.<br />A childrens' story? Whatever.<br />Waste of money. Waste of time.<br />Stick w/ the classics: Songs from the Wood, War Child, and so on.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|I thought it would be easy, but it is definitely challenging after the first few levels. I am enjoying it.
B00BD6EJRK|4.0|Because this app works pretty good most of the tim. This version has more to offer then original .Photo studio.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Eye opening information. The corruption of American food is completely served up by Dr. Davis in this book detailing the destructive components of eating wheat.
B00E9A656K|5.0|so good I love it its so EPIC!!!!!!!!! lol.  something someway somehow. someway. I will be the best racer ever
B001BANK32|5.0|I have seen the movie...but never read the book.  Only after buying Doctor Sleep novel did I realize that Doctor Sleep was a,sequel to The Shining. So I bought The Shining and as with all of King 's novels, I really enjoyed it.  Now off to read Doctor Sleep!
1401324029|5.0|Every book got more exciting and very well<br /> written. Can't wait for another one to come out.....Or is their one?
B00BP0O7QW|2.0|The book's cover is not the same as the original one. This is not the one i expect. But I will read it. I just hope that the other buyer will not misunderstand any more in the future.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Addictive. Fun. Challenging. Wish the game had a way to thank friends for sending lives moves and tickets. Love that I have it on all devices.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|An amazing book and really fantastic photos. Quite unusual. Would be a good book club discussion. I look forward to reading more.
B00DG86ARK|4.0|Great concerts to watch, but they should have been in 5.1. Still worth a purchase in my opinion to support Anathema.
B000FCKGPC|1.0|Absolutely the &#34;Worst&#34; book so far in the Game of Thrones saga, and I am a loyal Thrones fan!  It's boring!!!!!
0385743564|4.0|Steelheart (2013) is the first SF novel in the Epics series.  It is set in a parallel universe where Calamity happened.  A year later, people started gaining unusual powers.  Soon the remaining governments stop trying to defeat the Epics.  In this novel, David is an eight year old boy.  His father is a farmer.  David has not done well in school and lacks much knowledge.  Deathpoint is a minor Epic.  He can kill by pointing at people.  Their bodies become ash and bones.  Steelheart is a High Epic.  He lives in Newcago.  Fortuity is an Epic.  He is prescient, seeing a few seconds in the future.  Donny Harrison is a minor Epic.  He never runs out of ammunition.  Megan is the newest Reckoner.  She likes to follow standard procedures.  In this story, David and his father are visiting a bank.  His father is trying to get a mortgage.  The banker is not interested.  Deathpoint enters the bank and casually kills people.  Then Steelheart enters and confronts Deathpoint.  Steelheart claims the people and offers Deathpoint a position in his city.  David's father has taken a pistol from the ashes of a guard and worked around to shoot Deathpoint.  Steelheart turns toward him and Deathpoint attacks the other Epic.  David's father shoots Deathpoint between the eyes.  The bullet grazes Steelheart's neck.  Nothing else could damage him, but now his neck is bleeding.  Steelheart turns the nonliving parts of the bank into steel.  His transformation reaches throughout the city.  Steelheart also tries to kill everybody in the bank, but David gets away.  Ten years later, David has collected every scrap of data that he can get on Epics.  He is especially interested in Steelheart, the Epic who had killed his father.  He decides to join the Reckoners, an organization that kills Epics.  David gets to the theater just in time to see Fortuity leave with two beautiful women on his arms.  An ever better looking woman gains his attention and Fortuity goes off with her.  David follows behind them.A few blocks away, Donny comes running after Fortuity.  He was sent to bring Fortuity back to the theater.  David decides to intervene and joins the Epics with a counter message.  David walks with Donny back toward the theater, talking about the situation.  He says that he was sent by a man whom Donny knows has been dead for two days.  David runs off with Donny sending a storm of bullets after him.  Luckily Donny has a poor aim.  Then Fortuity appears wearing handcuffs.  Apparently the woman had cuffed him.  Then a sniper drops Donny and almost gets David.  The woman appears chasing after Fortuity.  She sticks a gun into David's face and tells him to kneel on the pavement.  Now David is stuck on his knees while the woman chases Fortuity, but he has an idea.  He takes a car around the block to confront Fortuity in an alley and the woman shoots the Epic.  This tale involves David with the Reckoners.  They try to drop him, but he keeps mentioning pertinent information that they had not known.  He even convinces them to get his notes from the apartment.  After defeating an ambush at his apartment, the Reckoners take David back to their hideout.  Megan defends David's actions and wants the Reckoners to recruit him.  David is beginning to really like her, but his attempts to impress her backfire.  This volume is similar to the [[ASIN:0765365073 Wild Cards]] and other strange powers series.  The Calamity appears to radiate something that changed DNA, giving Epics unusual and varied talents.  In many respects, this is more of a fantasy novel, but the necessary smoke and mirrors are used to make it tolerably science fiction.  David persuades the Reckoners to target Steelheart.  The next installment in this sequence is [[ASIN:0385743564 Firefight]]..  Recommended for Sanderson fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of powerful villains, strange powers, and a bit of thwarted romance.  Read and enjoy!  -Arthur W. Jordin/>Recommended for Sanderson fans and for anyone else who enjoys tales of powerful villains, strange powers, and a bit of thwarted romance.  Read and enjoy!<br /><br />-Arthur W. Jordin
B004UHPU5E|4.0|King Fripp Crimson is alive and well and who cares what you think has always been the way. As long as you hear and feel and live the sound all will be well. That it is jazzier than usual? so what! That is is popier than usual? so what! That it does not live to your &#34;expectations&#34;? never has and never will. We love king crimson because it´s always moving, changing, shadows diluting into more shadows and within light and more light and from yes to elp to uk to asia to gabriel to eno to crimson and king and life with water and clouds and horns and beats and harmonies and .... after all, is just another musical projeckt from one of the masters...
B00AEFYSEA|5.0|One of the best movies ever. If you like western entertainment, then you will love this.  A classic.  Beautiful music by Ennio Morricone once again.
B000SCHBGQ|4.0|This book is perfect for those who enjoy myths and legends and magic. This book by Michael Scott is beautifully written and will please readers of all ages. This book will give  you a new perspective on the belief of magic.
B00DYWKPAQ|5.0|Well, of course I loved these guys are just wonderful. Been on heavy rotation for a while!  A Beautiful War....sigh
B000ZMVAXO|5.0|I love it!  Worked great for my purposes!  I highly recommend it for solo jamming in headphones for practice or just fun.
B00FVFT7YO|5.0|Affirmations is a very powerful tool that people can use in order to improve their lives. The power of affirmations reprogram your subconscious mind. Will definitely help you become a better person all around. After reading this book I suggest you go to his blog and read some of his cool articles.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Fast shipping, great deal!  Now I own them in Blu Ray until the next best thing comes out!  Who can say no to that?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is fantastic.my family play this all the time. i like this more than Moscow.my sister has got addicted to it
B002KGEORM|4.0|Very entertaining. Easy to watch. I'm addicted to this series now. Wonder how much of it is true. Just who can imagine. Acting is true to form
B00CHVJODE|5.0|It is one of the best kids movies of the year. it is not only enertaining but it teaches children about families. we took our grandchild to see this movie she loved it so we purchased the croods.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I wish this series could last. It's thought provoking and exciting. It makes you take a real inner look at who you are as a person and why. Definitely kept me guessing and never would have guessed the ending. As someone who has served in the military, I found this book to be emotionally riveting. Loved it.
0812550706|5.0|Amazing book beautifully written and great flow trough out and keeps consistent I can't wait to get the second book!!
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Awesome movie! Great story line and message. I purchased the film for our church's movie night. We have watched several other movies with Alex Kendrick and cast. these guys are really good and we enjoy watching.
0893815500|4.0|Great photos to use as writing prompts when teaching a group. Gritty and realistic. Take writers into a variety of directions.
B00006D295|5.0|This was purchased as a gift for my daughter.  She has loved this movie for years.  As a matter of fact she already watched it today.  Thank you seller.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|I love angry birds star wars it is better than the first one because you can as different charcters in this one and in the other one you can only play as the bird side
B004YW4L5K|5.0|There isn't much more to say. It is a book about the immigrant experience, about faith, about belief. It is a masterful work and you should read it.<br /><br />Course it isn't perfect. But what is?
0930289234|5.0|This was of my favorite books to read, and I have read a fair number of books. If there is anyone who saw the movie first like me, and was not sure that  buying this would be worth it, believe me, the book is worth it easily.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|Great movie of course, just wish it was the Speical Edition version with all the extra stuff. This had a second disc, but that was all stuff I have seen on the web, those 11 production blogs, but that was fine for those that never saw them of course. Fine movie.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This doesn't even seem like it was written by the same author!  I completely understand why there was a dual perspective, but there was no difference in the viewpoints.  I kept getting confused as to the perspective that I was reading.  Allegiant was terribly written and had a depressing and wholly unsatisfying ending.  It ruined the entire series for me and I def won't be going to see the films now.
0767811070|3.0|I really like this movie very real stuff in it great actors it was really sad when the guy dies they have good sex parts in this movie great friendship this is such a great black film thats why I got it on dvd I have it on vhs  very good movie
B00FAIPDAE|4.0|This game is really fun and I do enjoy it alot only thing I see wrong is pay to win..... and u cannot control where it units go
B00006ZXSK|5.0|One of my favorite movies ever.  Drew Barrymore is amazing and this re-imaging is a delight!  The rest of the cast is incredible and I love how it empowers women.  Thanks Drew!!!!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Best book ever read the series you should real the maze runner series. Thomas is the best realistic book ever
B0089LOG02|5.0|My book club is reading this book and I loved it. What a wonderful story for all ages. Would love to read more stories on the other children who rode the orphan train.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|An Amazon best book of the month selection??  Yes, the premise is interesting.  Unfortunately the writing is awful; no plot development, no character development, cliche after cliche.  I finished the book but it was a mighty struggle and frankly not worth the effort.
1595826971|5.0|This book exceeded my very, very high expectations. The pages are thick, clean and clear and the book itself is overflowing with fascinating information and impossibly gorgeous art. It's a shame that most of this art is limited to the confines this book-- it's flawless.<br /><br />On a more technical note, my husband is the VP of a very large board and card game publishing company that produces many hard cover RPG books of a similar size and heft. He was very impressed with the quality of this book, especially considering the price point. I have not experienced any page weakness etc.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This is a very powerful book.  I read it in two days, but it's one of those books that makes me want to read it again.  The author gives credibility to his true story because of his status as a neurosurgeon.  As a doctor, he answers many questions that are raised and sometimes dismissed by other near-death-experience authors.  I highly recommend this book.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Tightly written, interesting characters, fast paced. All loose ends tied at the end. Good story line. Will always chose a Lee Child. Highly recommended.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Terrible. Lag when streaming from PC. Some websites it does not even show video so what's the point of this device? Returned.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is challenging and fun.  We have had users anywhere from 10 to 60 years old play this game.
B00902AKK4|4.0|It is a fun game, but almost too hard. There should be levels of difficulty!! It is kind of easy to become addicted!
1423140605|5.0|This is a book from a great series.  It is nice to have it in hardcover.  Good for grade school and older.
B000002LVB|4.0|THE VELVET UNDERGROUND-LOADED: Easily THE VELVET UNDERGROUND's most accessible album, their fourth effort LOADED jettisons the dark, druggy, sexually charged imagery of their earlier work, replacing it with (dare I say it?) radio friendly pop rock. It also contains two of head honcho LOU REED's most popular, hook laden and often covered slices of perfection, the sublime anthems SWEET JANE and ROCK & ROLL. Long gone is former group member JOHN CALE's avant garde instrumentation; LOADED plays off straight forward guitar/bass/drums volleys and REED's improved attempt to actually sing rather than \\"talk\\" his way through most selections. The lightly psychedelic WHO LOVES THE SUN and carefree  LONESOME COWBOY BILL (punctuated by REED's funky \\"yodel-lay-ee-o\\"'s) sound almost like another band completely, while I FOUND A REASON unspools as a lovely, ethereal ballad. If this triumphant swan song had been their debut platter rather than the uncompromising VELVET UNDERGROUND & NICO, VU might well have become a commercially viable entity...instead they had to settle for being an incalculable influence on virtually every underground artist that followed in their wake.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR LOADS
1423140591|5.0|This is a book from a great series.  It is nice to have it in hardcover.  Good for grade school and older.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Deceptively free. After level 34, you either had to pay up or annoy friends on Facebook. Neither option worked for me so I deleted it. I found it annoying that the game only allowed me to play for a set time period. Again for play to continue you either spend money or annoy friends. Some &quot;free&quot; game. Found candy deluxe pro which is essentially the same game, though really free with no restrictions in place. Can't believe people get so addicted to candy crush saga. Can only imagine how much money they are spending to get through the levels. But to each his own.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Kind of boring, glad it's over! This book started off ok but it got very predictable very quickly. I' not going for the trilogy.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Great to have all the original  Star Trek movies together now utilizing the latest Blue Ray technology.  Great way to package them.
B00BMKH5NW|4.0|I like how the author interweaved the fangirl story with the real story. Cather is a great character. A coming-of-age story that nails what it's like to be a freshman living in a dorm. Great read.
B008JFUPZI|5.0|We thoroughly enjoyed this movie in the theater and had to have it at home for the upcoming winter months.
B00CW7KK9K|1.0|The box came already opened and the Withings tracking unit is missing. Two USB cords were including though. I plan on returning this item.
B0095R64AO|3.0|The beginning and the end were quite funny, but it got lost in the middle and was just awkward and uncomfortable for a bit. Too bad, I really wanted to like it!
B000NTPDSW|3.0|Audio in latín spanish and english. Subtitles in spanish and english. Here are three  movies at a lower price. Dont forget that the godfather one and two are two of the best movies in the world. Forget the three.
B00G32QIEG|3.0|Wasnt to impressed.  Good cast.  Special effects were good.  Didnt like the whole idea of their concept of death.  Kind of stupid when peoples souls went bad
B004FRX0MY|3.0|Good product and easy to listen clearly. And the most important  thing is free. So take it now and enjoy the music.
B00F35B8F8|5.0|The cast is great!!  What can I say.  Another Good movie!!  I liked the idea of the rolls being switched between Spock and Kirk.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|Excellent movie but my only complaint is why did not continue using the John Williams music I think it could be a lot better :(
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game to spend time playing! Just don't get addicted because it's one that can get under your skin! Glad to now have it on kindle!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is challenging and frustrating but also a lot of fun!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|On so many levels Grisham has drawn the worst and the best of people and pulled together a totally believable story with intriguing plots and characters that held my attention, made me angry, had me cheering on the side of justice and cursing our court system.  Fortunately, the trial had a redeeming end.  This is truly a top-notch read.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|This trilogy is so interesting and exciting to read - hard to put down.  The Best Kept Secret is as good, if not better, than the first 2 books.
B003L77GRO|4.0|Meh. It's getting worse and worse. I stopped purchasing after this season. Not worth the money anymore. . . .
B00DURHYWC|5.0|This is one of the best CD's Pink Martini has done.  The songs are catchy - make you want to move and the melodies great.  Love their voices.
B00FHATBGW|5.0|Great game, keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what will happen next. Looking forward to the next installment.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|The chromecast is easy to setup, easy to use. Love casting Youtube videos straight to my TV. Looking forward to more apps on the iPhone that support it.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Little effort will be made to keep this review spoiler free.<br /><br />The first fifteen minutes establish that Zack Snyder might be the best director of opening montages that Hollywood has ever produced, but when I watched this in theaters and walked a way a little exhausted, feeling it fell just a bit short of the high mark it needed to hit to establish a bold new vision for the DC comic book movies franchise. When I got home and saw the lukewarm reviews (58%) I thought they were pretty fair, although I got taken aback later when Iron 3 acquired a significantly higher margin (79%). Man of Steel should have scored higher for the first minutes alone, not to mention its dramatically serious (if flawed) plot compared to Iron Man 3's cartoony concepts and tired hamster wheel story.<br /><br />Since a second viewing I have revised my opinion. Man of Steel is neither the best dramatic film ever or the best superhero film ever (I can't say it outscores The Dark Knight on either category), but it pushes the bar in both categories. Although handicapped with some plot holes (why Zodd *HAS* to recreate Krypton on Earth or enter into a mortal conflict with Superman is never really explained), the narrative has enough logical sense and emotional resonance to carry the day. If not quite a revelation, it is still a thrilling film that has the virtue of instilling familiar concepts with enough energy to turn them into a cinematic tour de force. The performances, visuals, and editing come together to make a new face out of old material, and the result is a movie with a little soul (something I fear may be vanishing from the Marvel franchise).
B004SEUIWO|5.0|It's easy to agree with most of the other comments (pro and con) regarding this production, except that my DVD played perfectly.<br />Compared to the two other film versions of Roxie's saga, (the silent 1927 'Chicago' and the black and white 1941 'Roxie Hart'  version) which treated the sleazier aspects of the story rather daintily, in this telling, the 'gloves come off '.  The performers all acquit themselves well enough but ... somewhere in my video collection, I have a clip of Gwen Verdon and Chita Rivera performing on a Tony Awards broadcast and against that, the performers in the film, as fine as they are, pale somewhat.  My main disappointments with this version, are that  1. Mary Sunshine is played by a woman and her song is deleted ...  I guess that would have been too 'decadent' even for Hollywood, aside from being too much of a distraction on the  big screen ... and  2.  The song 'Class' is also gone from the film proper (it is, however, included in the special features).  The other fiddling with the score are distracting, but not really a detriment.  Also, the 'vaudeville act' aspect of the original Broadway show is somewhat muddied but handled fairly well as the film slides from reality to  performing.  The 'making of ...'  featurette is interesting.  I look forward to watching  the movie again, this time with Director Rob Marshall's commentary track.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is hilarious and also breathtaking I love how they understand kids in a well what you you might call personal
0385349947|1.0|I received this book today, but am disappointed in the quality of the product - all of the pages are different lengths and the edges are wrinkled.  Given that it's a new book sent from Amazon, I expected better quality.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|I love this game you get to ride on wolf's and penguins yetis sleds egals and more you can complete<br />challges and get new places to ski and even new charters GET THIS GAME!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I luv this app I finally found the real deal. My family lives it already. We just got the game an hour ago and already on level 34 how cool is that!?
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was hard to read at times but at the same time impossible to put down. As a survivor of abuse and rape, I can identify with the demons that live in Camille. Her character will stay with me for a very long time. Will definitely read more from Gillian Flynn.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|great storyline and detail and the great romance of jamie and claire we must follow them and see where they lead love this series the author is very good at mixing history and love
B0040I09RM|4.0|Still waiting to see how this story will unfold, do I like these people? But I am interested and that a good story
B00499NHLC|5.0|I am a Cumberbatch fan specifically because of how he did this role.  One of the difficulties with the original stories of Doyle was the culture and technology of Victorian England tends to insulate us from the emotional impact that the stories had when they first came out.  This series attempts to stay true to the spirit of the originals but allows us to feel the emotional impact that I always imagined they had on readers who actually lived at the time of original publication.  I really enjoy the treatment of Mycroft Holmes, Moriarty and above all &#34;That Woman&#34;.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I love Regency romances which do not have bedroom scenes in them.  The translation to the screen of this book, is fantastic. On the whole, the choice of actors is great!  I like it  much better than &#34;Gone With the Wind&#34;. I have a good feeling every time I watch it.
B0086DBE62|4.0|Interesting twist.  Visually fresh and beautiful.  Amazing costuming.  Not a fan of Julia Roberts, but she fit well.  Love the Bollywood influence!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another great hit for John Grishman couldn't put it down.  Really kept you interested. Real interesting ending to the book.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book was completely haunting but so well written and so interesting. I am so happy that she escaped and is well enough to tell her story.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Really fun game, it keeps you going and you are so sure you are going to bet the board the next time.  Only thing I don' like is when your friends give you additional lives and don't really get them.  They disappear.
B00DYEN6XC|4.0|Completely a great set to enjoy for years, collectors should be extremely happy with the action figures, packaging - the works!
B002GU5V24|1.0|It is unforgivable to have all fake DVD's in the box set. Not to mention the empty slot for the &#34;Live Over Europe 2007&#34;. I felt cheated.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|This app is the best I really do like it. I can take really cool pics and send them or even post them!!!!!!!

1400069289|5.0|Now, this book is one of my top ten books to read. I keep it along side the scriptures.<br /><br />&#34;We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.&#34; (Aristotle)
B004UJAOLM|4.0|This was an easy read.  The book definitely made me think how lucky I am to be living in 21st century.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|One of the best of the Pendergast series. I was hooked from the beginning and could not put it down.
B00CEF014E|5.0|I love a book that keeps you literally on the edge of your seat waiting on the next twist. Stevenson keeps you in suspense page after page. Is Dana crazy? Is her boyfriend real? Why does the cult not want her to leave?<br />I read it all in one sitting and am still on the edge of my seat thinking about it. Definitely a 5 star read.
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|THE MOVIE IS AWESOME.<br /><br />However, this review is not for the movie but for the actual product and Flixtster.com the people that provide the &#34;UltraViolet&#34; download copy. The big disappointment was the actual product, especially the &#34;UltraViolet&#34; digital copy. I got this thinking that I would be able to add the &#34;UltraViolet&#34; digital copy to my iTunes library. This is very misleading. Buyers beware of &#34;UltraViolet&#34; combo pack, if you want to be able to add the digital copy to your iTunes library, STAY AWAY. I also submit a incident with FlixSter and inform them of the issue, several email exchanges went by, I got nothing, they would not give me a code that I could redeem it at the iTune store that I could download a copy that is iTunes compatible. Why re-invent the wheel when you have something that is universally accepted and compatible out there already. WTF. Flixster.com is a complete F***ing rip off. Flixster if you are reading this review, I am not a satisfy customer.<br /><br />Disappointed Customer,
B00FQPHOPI|5.0|Fantastic movie! I am a comic book nerd, but I love the new take on Superman. I believe the next movie will explore the more classic side of Superman while this one set it up very nicely. Well done.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I would have rated it higher if SK had written a little more of the story. It was too short.
B000001E3L|5.0|Twenty years after \\"It's Too Late to Stop Now,\\" here's another great live album featuring Van Morrison.  Instead of the earlier concert's high-energy mix of blues and soul, here we have a blues-inflected jazz album in which Van is less at the center of things than was the case 20 years earlier.  At times, in fact, he sounds more like an emcee, calling out and identifying for his audience members of the band for their solo work, including quite a bit of vocal work.  The band is tight, with Georgie Fame on keyboards and the Dutch saxophonist Candy Dulfer prominently featured.  Many of the items are \\"medleys,\\" some of which blend Van's own songs with covers, and blues stalwarts John Lee Hooker, Jimmy Witherspoon, and Junior Wells do guest spots (as does Van's daughter on one track).  The performances run an expressive gamut that is wider than on \\"It's too late . . .\\" and they are all very fine and in very good sound.  My only quibble is that the version I bought does not have a booklet that goes into sufficient detail about who actually contributes what to each number.  Van's voice I recognize, but otherwise I'm just guessing.  The music is the thing, though, and this is just splendid.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|This is definitely my favorite game for racing great controls cool maps you should by this app it's great  very fun
0385345054|5.0|This is a terrific book.  I buy a ton of craft books and so many are disappointing, either because the crafts are too simple, you need to buy a lot of unavailable materials (&#34;I made these earrings out of old dress clips I got for a song at the Paris flea market in 1975!&#34;) or the directions are haphazard or insufficient (&#34;finish as shown&#34;). This book uses inexpensive, easy to find materials, the instructions are clear and understandable, and I found plenty of things among the 75 flowers I wanted to make.  One of the most usable crafts books since Kaari Meng's French Inspired Jewelry, and kudos to the publishers for putting in so many step-by-step pictures!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome! I couldn't put the damn thing down! Read all 3 books in two days amazing suspense :) strongly recommend
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Another great job by JJ Abrams. The first one was better, but I still really enjoyed this movie. The casting of Khan was on the money.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The only con is that it is so addictive!  This is a great game.  Lots of fun to play  :)
B000001AKM|3.0|Do not buy this collection of Lionel Richie songs. How in the world one can assemble a career-spanning greatest hits package and not include his second solo top five song, &#34;You Are&#34;, is unfathomable. What a scam. Motown Records should be ashamed of themselves for putting out a product like this which such a huge error.
B00EP0KBXM|5.0|I thought this was excellent.  Will Smith showed great ability to leave his past roles in doing this film.  His son also shows promise as an actor. I felt his sadness, terror, fear, and pride in a job not meant for his age, but which he rose to none the less.  I also liked the movie content itself, off the beaten path of science fiction and exploring the earth without mans interference.
B00GMONG90|5.0|They're so talented, deserve their success, and need you to buy this excellent album.  It's tough for most to make money in this business, especially split 5-ways, so help them out so they can keep going.
B001O12PCU|5.0|This was really an off the wall story.  Took me completely by surprise in the end.  Left me wondering if there would be a sequel of the final conclusion.  Future of kind of movie.  Don't want to spoil the plot being too specific.
B007XNAOS0|4.0|This is a good double-album, with several great songs.  But, I think it's about 1 album too much.  Taking the best tracks from Yellow and Green and putting them into one &#34;light-green&#34; album would have been better.
0385474547|4.0|This was a required reading for my son. We received the book quickly and in good condition. He thought it was a kind of odd book
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|An education about recent times in North Korea...a brutal country from which this young man eventually escaped. He lived his entire life until then in a &#34;work camp in North Korea...a horrific, unimaginable life.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Can't wait to complete the trilogy to find out what the final outcome will be.  I'm going to buy all three as gifts for my daughter!  Merry Christmas!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|love this game ... just wish I didn't have go wait 24 hours for more lives. would deffinetly reccommend this game.
B008JFUPK8|2.0|In the last hour of this movie Superman flattens Metropolis killing millions of people.<br />I could still buy into it, but it is just so drawn out and in the end he just flex an arm and Zod is dead?<br />It was take way too far to be enjoyable.  Rather watch Pacific Rim and enjoy the special effects.<br />I should really give it 1 star, but the beginning of the movie was actually good and the special effects is very well done.<br />They just lost the plot in the end or more likely the director had too much money to burn on special effect and came up with bigger and bigger ways to blow that money. And this is the sad thing - rather than enjoy the movie I am evaluating how it was made and for what purpose because I certainly could not be pulled into the madness that certainly is NOT Superman.<br /><br />I am a big Superman fan, and this left me disappointed.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Love the survival point of view in this story. One physical, the other emotional. Yet, they both come to realize that it's their past and they can move on finding happiness with their new lives.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|I am going into a plot review, a lot of others have already done that.<br />I do however want to say that this is one of those movies that you can just sit back and enjoy.<br />The CG and sound track is very well done.<br /><br />Too many movies these days make me sit back and say &#34;what the hell was the director thinking&#34; This is not one of those. Recommended.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Fun game, have had no problems at all. Works great with my Kindle. The more I play the more challenging it has gotten!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is great! I have spent evenings with my nephews playing this game. We challenge each other all afternoon!
B00EI4V3X2|3.0|This headset sounds great, feels great, and was easy to set up, However there are a couple issues that prevent me from giving it 5.<br /><br />One, you can't control the chat volume OR mute your microphone when using these on the PS4.<br /><br />Two, there is a intermittent yet frequent buzzing noise. It may be interference, but with Dual-Band interference free advertised, this should not happen.<br /><br />Three, the buttons rattle around on the headset cups.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|This book tells the story of true heros that fought and died for our country, and one amazing man and hero that survived though he'll to give us their story.  Thank you!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love playing this game! Plus it keeps my little sis occupied. The levels are fun. I love trying to beat my high score!
B00FQUACUM|5.0|I am absolutely memorized by Il Volo!  O Holy Night and Ava Maria, what can I say but that I have goose bumps listening to them. What a beautiful selection of Christmas Music!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can read anytime, anywhere with this. No internet connection necessary.  Just make sure my Android is charged up, play my Pandora in the background, and get lost in a book. I have not seen that there is a way to skip to a particular page.  You have to go through one page at a time.  For example, the Bible on Kindle--useless if you're trying to follow along with a preacher.  If you just want to read a book, perfect.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|Buy! Buy! Buy! No! I don't want to BUY stupid crap to play the game I already paid for. Get it off the screen!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|What a lot of fun!  The Marvel movies deliver again.  Very entertaining. All of the very different characters are pulled together with great chemistry to save the Earth yet again.
B00E5MXU4C|5.0|I have read the previous books in the series and I have enter them all. Quick easy read with humor,  romance and mystery which keeps you coming back for more!
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|This show will be remembered and talked about decades from now. It's extremely ambitious and creative while being totally contemporary, wrapped up in awesome old school film-making. The scenes linger, always longer than they normally would in any movie or TV show. The tracking/continuous shots of pure drama never fail to amplify the intensity. The aesthetics of the it overall are brilliant. Vast, beautiful landscapes serve as backdrops to some of the best cinematography I've ever seen. There are no wasted frames here, they use light and color elegantly to balance the mood and tension in each scene. The 44 minute run-time makes sure that the show never lags, it's essentially one masterfully set up scene after another. And the music, from the songs they use to the amazingly original and unconventionally moody background music, so tense and dark it's something out of a sci-fi horror film, yet feels almost futuristic and endlessly creative.<br /><br />On top of all that, the acting is constantly Oscar worthy, led by the amazing Bryan Cranston and Aaron Paul, who are nothing short of perfect in every frame of this TV show. The final season especially is a showcase for supporting players. Did I talk about the writing? Oh yeah, it's perfect. With essentially no plot holes or loose ends, no one dimensional filler characters or scenes. It's the most tightly told TV show story you will ever watch, not one scene out of place. It's also impressive how unpredictable the show is all the way through, good luck guessing the outcome of any given story line. Even the CGI is perfect, when it's used so seamlessly it would make David Fincher jealous.<br /><br />Best advice I can give you is stop reading reviews and go experience what may very well be the best crime story ever put on film.
0618918248|5.0|If you are having doubts about your belief in God it is a must.  The internet has opened the flood gates of information that has allowed a skeptical review of some of the things you have been brought up to believe.  You want to know the truth, but feel ashamed to question your religious surroundings.  It seems taboo to disagree or to not believe.  Back to this book.  In my opinion having this book is a big step.  It is physical evidence that can be seen by others.  This book is on the opposite end of the spectrum of religious teachings.  Don't get me wrong.  It is a great book, but if it may cause social suicide with your friends or family then don't get it now or get it electronically through Kindle for example so you can be discreet if you must.  I ordered a paperback copy.  To be honest it was difficult for me to place the order because I felt guilty.  I felt stronger after I ordered like I had control of my own decisions.  I'm glad I did.  The book has 462 pages.  There are about 25 pages for quick reference to find interesting subjects.  Cheers!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|its addicting and I love the challenge of the game. I have been playing this game on my laptop and phone and am so glad I was able to download to my Kindle.

B00DM2Q9E4|5.0|Just saw his video on the Palladia Channel. The second I heard his voice I knew he is a force to be reckoned with.<br /><br />His voice is amazing. His album hasn't been released in the US yet but I'm sure it's coming.<br /><br />He's definitely got a new fan, and this is definitely not the last time were going to hear his name.
030758836X|5.0|Great mystery! Loved the twists and turns. What a vivid imagination. I really want to read more from this author.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|Wish they had more stars for this magnificent book.<br /><br />Malala begins with a lyrical, almost poetic description of her beloved Swat Valley. You can see the snowcapped peaks, smell the fresh mountain air.<br /><br />Reverting to her usual plain spoken style she proceeds to give a capsule history of Swat, the Yousufzai tribe and the Pashtun nation. She then weaves the history of Pakistan and her family's history into a single narrative. This occupies roughly half the book.<br /><br />The remainder of the book is her personal story. She describes the rise of radical Islam in general and the Taliban in particular, tying the process to overall political trends with an insight far beyond her years. The rise of the Taliban in Swat, their expulsion by the Army, their re-emergence, and the inexorable march of events leading up to her shooting are told.<br /><br />The remainder of the book covers the part of the story we all know so well, her treatment in Pakistan, the evacuation to England and her subsequent treatment and recovery. We follow the process by which she refined the sense of mission so evident in her public appearances.<br /><br />This is a \\"must read\\" work, as inspiring as the young woman herself.
0812983459|5.0|Very good book!  I really enjoyed it. It slowed down a bit in the middle, but it was still a very satisfying read.

1781162646|4.0|Great story.  Loved the ending.  This was so much more than a murder mystery, but the mystery was served well and resolved.  Unlike the Colorado Kid a few years ago.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book.
B001J710Y8|5.0|This is an older movie but it captures terror in a very unique manner.  It is also quite authentic in it's portrayal of ancient customs.  This is one of those movies that creeps you out without all the blood, gore, and nudity.  Although there is some nudity.
B001BANK32|5.0|I first read this book some 20 years ago, and was thrilled to discover that it still packs the same punch it did then...  One of my all-time favorites!

0316055433|5.0|The story kept me guessing and interested the entire time, it had many twists and surprises. The character depth and description is amazing, so well written, I just wanted to curl up and read this book to the end once I got started even though it has about 700 pages! I highly recommend.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|Most persons I think don't realize one of the 3 main tabs in Gmail is Tasks. The other two are your Gmail and Contacts! For years I've been using Tasks on my desktop to organize my Google Calender, set reminders and to.... well... task. However, this functionality isn't integrated into Android Gmail App. One is left to use third party apps to bridge this Gap. I find that Tasks N Todos Pro is best of the lot that I've tried. Hope Google will come to their senses and remedy this oversight.

B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Works great, really like it! Graphics are great and like the choice of weapons. Easy to get the hang of.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Maybe it's me.  I've read everything Steven King has written for the past thirty years. Like almost all of it. Loved some (The Stand) and many others too.  But this one, I don't know,, didn't read all that great to me.  The shining which is where this one comes from is nothing less than a classic, I don't think this one will be.  If you read all his stuff, you'll read this one and you will not dislike it, but I don't think you will love it either. However, I kept turning t he pages and it was ok. Just not what he is capable of.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|So I bought this because I watch the show and so I started it. It may be fun but boy is the stuff expensive. I would want to dress the ponies up and actually see them better. But I love the new equestria girls game make more
0345472322|5.0|This is great book and great reading. However, there are three important questionable points in the entire idea. I tried to reach out the author. no success. So:<br /><br />- Whether the \\"growth mindset\\" ability is _natural_ ability or talent itself? Where is the border between \\"natural\\" abilities and efforts?<br />- Yes, having growth mindset, you can apply efforts to learn more or run faster. What if you don't know the goal? Art (and business is the art) never has pre-defined goal to achieve. It's always intuition, guess, soul... Example of portrait art school in the book is not credible: it's not an art.<br />- Yes, I know that I have to have growth mindset. What is next?? This book doesn't give you an answer. The reasons of having not growth mindset so complex, so different and  so hard to overcome that just willingness to improve that clearly is not enough. This is actually separate science.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is great book because it gives you clear understanding what you suspected before, and force to think and to ask the questions like I gave above.<br />Must read.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I eagerly read through the chapters enjoying how the three scenarios came together.  I was able to connect with the characters and wanted to know where they landed.

B0001XAPY2|5.0|This is now one of my favorite Studio Ghibli films. I did not think I would like it because of the cover, him being a pig and all. But these really teaches you the meaning behind &#34;Do not judge a book by its cover&#34; ...I enjoyed it so much that I watched it twice in a row and then again with my boyfriend. (I NEVER DO THAT) I warmed my heart and made me laugh so much. I think I even had tears in my eyes at one point. An excellent movie and terrific buy!
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I really liked this app. It was EPIC!!!! My friend bought this app, about 20 seconds later I bought it. Who originally created this app? I don't care.

B002XGRSBI|5.0|I saw the last Beatles concert at Candlestick Park in San Francisco. Needless to say, I was then, and am still, a huge Beatles fan. My wife and I saw this concert at AT&T Park in San Francisco about four years ago. McCartney, always my favorite Beatle, was on stage for over two hours with boundless energy and a great voice. This particular concert video of McCartney in New York is fine, but his voice is not quite as good as it was live in San Francisco. Paul claimed that the damp air in SF made it easier on his pipes. Nonetheless, this is a great video that any McCartney fan will love. It covers not just McCartney songs, but many of his Beatles songs as well. Of particular poignancy is his moving tribute to John.
B00DYEN5QU|1.0|The movie was fine. The problem is the stupid UltraViolet &#34;digital&#34; solution. What a piece of junk. I will never buy anything with &#34;UltraViolet&#34; option again. Too many hoops to jump through to get a digital version of the movie. This idea was obviously thought up by some movie studio executive and not someone who cares about the viewing experience.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Google nails it again. Setup is easy. Easy to use. Connection doesn't go in & out as you might expect with this product.
B003O86FMW|5.0|OMg I loved it it was epic! I love the hunger games can't wait to see the movie !! Yay
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It was ok but not nearly as good as the others. I was disappointed. It started out slow and I was not expecting it to end that way. I loved the first three books and really was looking forward to this one. It also got very confusing and did not flow together.
B000F4MLZ8|5.0|His great folk voice and simple lyrics entertain me while I drive to work or hand out at home.  I love his style!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I think it's a great game. Lots of guns, and animals to hunt. I'd recommend this game to all hunters, or just a gamer who likes nature.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|The most moving, spellbinding book I have read for years. It's hard to believe it is based on a true story, and what hardships he endured, but what pleasures he experienced. So much to learn...

B003YL4LYI|5.0|A Dance with Dragons is every bit as good as the four books that preceded it. It continues to amaze me that Martin can conceive such complex yet integrated plots and write them in such a way that the books are page-turners.
1451627297|5.0|A great combination of exciting thriller, romance, and scifi wrapped around one of the most shocking historical event in US history.  Could not put this book down until finished reading.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham's newest book &#34;Sycamore Row&#34; was his best yet. I loved the history and how each characters personality brought so much to the story. I was surprised by the ending.
B000FC11A6|5.0|This book made me neglect the things I had to do.  Awesome stuff.  Working in two time periods at once was pretty cool.
B00E34A9FU|5.0|As the prevailing story goes, I had to wait some 41 years for it(I had no \\"bootlegs\\"-just as well!). It was definitely worth that wait.<br />The \\"RESTORATION\\" is impecable, considering that amount of time.(Tell the lazy audio- detracters to simply adjust their EQ-settings a bit!).<br />I've also acquired (awhile back) a bootleg (on DVD) of the European tour's show in Denmark the previous April, with Pigpen. His unfortunate absense due to health issues is the only minus to this fantastic performance.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|A love letter to giant monsters, Pacific Rim looked great in theaters, and you're not going to copy the original experience.  However, watching the DVD in the intimacy of your home allows you to admire greater detail that you may have missed while jumping out of your seat.  This is an essential purchase for anybody who loves Godzilla, Gamera or Guillermo.
0525478817|4.0|I liked the story. It's not the usual stuff I read but was recommend by a friend of a friend. I needed something that was an &#34;easy&#34; read. While it's and &#34;easy&#34; read (meaning it won't take long to finish, it's not an easy read book. There is a lot of emotion in the book.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Well-structured and compellingly written account of how the lives of two &#34;ordinary&#34; men who loved to fly became inextricably linked - despite being on opposite sides in a horrifying conflict.<br /><br />Honor, duty, sacrifice and destiny worked together to keep Franz Stigler and Charlie Brown alive after WWII to tell their story. Thanks to the authors, now readers of all ages can marvel at how it unfolded - and need to share its message with loved ones.<br /><br />The world needs more &#34;ordinary&#34; guys like Stigler and Brown - now more than ever.
B001BANK32|4.0|good narrator-good story, kept interest till end. went back and reread the shining afterward. good all around read-recomend highly to everybody
B00CL0J99K|5.0|I still like the original Iron Man best... but I am hooked on Marvel characters.  Great continuation of Tony - post Avengers movie.  Once again, the Amazon purchase process was EASY and less expensive to purchase here, including shipping, than anywhere else.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game to play. Sometimes its a little boring but I just keep playing and it gets fun again. Good way to occupy yourself without needing to buy in game purchases.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|I loved the movie.  I delayed getting blu-ray thinking it would NOT be a big difference and dvds were more expensive.  However, we got the blu-ray player and tried one and we were hooked.  It is incredibly more vivid and clear.  Colors and views have greater impact on the screen  We received the DVD with no trouble.  It was easy.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Wrapping up a loose end from the original TV show, this movie did a great job reminding you of why you loved the series so much. Buy this movie if you have the show already. It's a great adventure and well worth your time.
B00GH4R95C|1.0|Movie was fine (not the best super hero movie ever,  but certainly not the worst) but amazon kept popping up an error message saying hd wasn't supported. I have never had this problem before. I checked my download speeds and had plenty of bandwidth. Standard definition would have been fine, but it was bad enough that it would have appeared pixilated on an iPhone much less a regular sized tv. Refreshing seemed to bring it back to standard def, but who wants to have to stop and refresh every time there is an explosion on screen? Seems like it was some sort of anti-piracy protection or something. With the problems it caused it certainly wasn't worth $5. Hope this isn't how all amazon rentals are going to be from now on. I hate having to go to redbox, but I also hate not being able to even tell what I'm watching because it is so pixilated.
B0000844I8|5.0|The movie that started it all. Time hasn't aged this film at all. It's the classic that started the TV series which led the overall story to fame. Kurt Russel and James Spader do a wonderful job in this sic-if masterpiece!
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Immature storyline and all sequels are the same as the first book, just a year later...same storyline..blah blah blah blah
B0017MO10U|4.0|This story completes the last &#34;loose string&#34; from the original series. Though it sadly lacks Richard Dean Anderson (he has a few minutes of screen time) it's the only negative of the movie. Other than that, it was the perfect way to complete the show.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I am a major fan of Divergent and Insurgent, but Allegiant was a major disappointment. Even though the first two books had minor problems, I fell in love with Tris. She was a strong female lead that wasn’t afraid to do what needed to be done. I preordered Allegiant and was counting down the days until it was finally released, and I was promptly disillusioned with the product.<br />For those that still have not read the book this is what I have to say:<br /><br />And this is not an angry rant right after reading the book. I read the book, was deeply disappointed (even a little angry), but I gave myself time and space to think and reflect. Sad to say, that almost a month later I am still disappointed and just a smidge angry.<br /><br />• I will literally finish books in hours if I truly love the story. I read the first two books in a matter of days, and I thought this book would be that same. The story was so slow in some areas I literally had to force myself to keep reading, and I was severely tempted to just skip some pages altogether.<br /><br />• Going back and forth between Tris’ point of view and Four’s was confusing and unnecessary in some instances.<br /><br />• The big mystery behind the city wasn’t as amazing as we were lead to believe. There are some half brained ideas that are never really fully explained, and the ones that are just leave you feeling cheated and annoyed.<br /><br />• The characters are not the same as in the first two books. I was left with a feeling of “Who the heck are these people, and where are the characters from the first two books? I want them back please.”<br /><br />• This story, unlike the other two, is so forgettable it’s ridiculous. I can recall things from Divergent and Insurgent, but ask me a question about Allegiant and aside from the major issue at the end, I don’t remember much. It’s sad because this book had a lot of potential and it quickly plummeted.<br /><br />***Spoiler Alert for those that haven’t read the book. ***<br /><br />• Even though I don’t like the fact that Tris died in the end, I kind of, in a roundabout way, understand why she died. I don’t feel good or happy about it, but I kind of get it. She was big on the self-sacrifice thing.. ok..got it…. moving on because it still kind of upsets me and whatever. What I don’t get is why she had to sacrifice herself for Caleb if he wasn’t going to change in the wake of her sacrifice. If Tris sacrificing herself was going to have an impact, then HAVE AN IMPACT!!!!! He’s still the same person from before, so I do not see the point of her sacrifice at all.<br /><br />• The fact that the conflict within the city was so easily solved is unconvincing. You’re telling me all it took to get these people to back down from going to war with each other was a little mother-son heart to heart. Seriously!? These people have hated each other for years! One hadn’t seen her son in years and the other one wasn’t that touchy feely to begin with, but I’m supposed to believe that they both just walked away from this. OK buddy, sure, whatever you say.  I’m sorry, but if Four can get his happily ever after with his mother, why couldn’t we get our happily ever after with Tris? (Ok, so apparently I’m more than just a little upset about that).<br /><br />• The whole genetic makeup explanation sounds like something a ten year old explained. I was left feeling more than just a little lost and dumbfounded by what I read, and it did not live up to the hype that we were lead to believe in Insurgent.<br /><br />Overall it was a major disappointment, and I will definitely not be re-reading Allegiant ever again. I’m still not sure about the movies. I’m hoping that the studio will see reason and realize that a lot of fans are not happy with this book, and they will decide to change some things. It’s happened before like in My Sister’s Keeper, so I am hoping that it will happen again.haven’t read the book. ***<br /><br />• Even though I don’t like the fact that Tris died in the end, I kind of, in a roundabout way, understand why she died.

B00E8G5HDW|3.0|The best thing about this season is that it ends. Long in the tooth with tired out story lines, they were able to bring semi-closure to the Darth Maul story line in this season but left us hanging to the conclusion since the show got rightfully cancelled. If you need it to finish a set. Go ahead. But if you're looking for something worth your time., &#34;move along, move along&#34;
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Two Graves was excellent.  Held my attention and could not put it down.  Can't wait to read another of his books.
B004TJ1H3C|3.0|Not to be too repetitive from my review on season 1 Season 2 was the beginning of the end for the show. They brought in a few guest stars from previous Stargate shows  and even had the original star from the movie French Stewart for an episode which was a unexpected surprise!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I downloaded this for my kindle and was amazed when 2GB of space came free after clearing out cache and left over fires.
B00402FGE4|3.0|Though not as good as he following shows based off the movie this show still has some episodes that are worth your time. The biggest problem with the show was that it tried too hard to copy Battlestar Galactica (which was hot at the time) Due to that, the story suffered the humor was slim and it led to it's eventual cancellation after only the 2nd season. For the completist who loved the first 2 Stargate shows, go ahead  and get it. But if you don't you're better either way.

0062225790|4.0|The book being reviewed is, &#34;An Appetite for Wonder&#34; and the author is Richard Dawkins.  I was recently watching the Bill Maher Show on TV, and Richard Dawkins came on as a guest. Apparently, he was making the rounds of the TV talk shows, promoting his new book.  If I could magically talk to the individuals behind my TV screen,  I might have held up my copy for him to see and have  said, &#34; Hey Richard, Look! I've already started it.&#34;  Dawkins is one of my favorite authors and his ability to explain evolutionary theory, while making it fun to read, makes him one of my science heroes.<br /><br />There are two ways to appraise an author's memoirs: One is to think of the book as a written version of what the author thinks is important in his life. If someone, that you admired, wanted to relate to you some story of his life, chances are that you would only interrupt him to clarify a point that you do not follow. Otherwise, you would let him tell his story in his own way. However, the other way of appraising one's memoirs is to determine whether the reading experience was worthwhile and whether the book either held your rapt attention or caused your mind to wander at times.  In the case of &#34;An Appetite for Wonder&#34;, I felt the dual sensations of being a polite and patient listener, but also forming criticisms as the story unfolded.  I have been a long time fan and reader of Richard Dawkin's books, and certainly wanted to hear his personal story. On the other hand, many of you, now  reading my review, may not know of  Richard Dawkins or his previous writings and may merely want to know if it is worth their time to read 'An Appetite for Wonder&#34; and if so, why do I think so.<br /><br />I have so enjoyed the previous books written by this author, that it pains me to say that I thought the first half of the book was rather tedious. Why so? Unless we are talking about a child prot&eacute;g&eacute;e and Dawkins admits that he was not one, what could be so interesting about a tot, child or pre-teen's  daily life? What makes the adult Richard Dawkins so fascinating is his unique scientific thought processes and his special skill at explaining them to a general audience in an interesting manner. These abilities appear to be yet undeveloped in his childhood, as one might expect. Consequently, I thought the book would have been more compelling , if those pages describing the early years were condensed to perhaps one-tenth the current number of pages  and that space used to go into more detail in the years from say, his starting the university to where the book ends, with the publication of his first book, &#34;The Selfish Gene&#34;.  By the way, the author mentioned that he plans to pick up his autobiography,  at where this one ended,  in a future book. There is a lot yet to tell us about his very productive life.<br /><br />To my delight, the book became a lot more interesting to me  in its second half.  Dawkins was drawn towards Zoology as a major field of study.  Consequently, Dawkin's vast knowledge of animal behavior has made several of his previous books delightful  to read. With Darwinian evolution as the central theme, which connects most of his books, Dawkins attacks a particular aspect of evolution and proceeds to educate the reader as to how that aspect works by drawing from animal behavior science. He has the skill to explain complex issues by breaking them down into simpler concepts and using numerous examples from the animal kingdom to illustrate his arguments. He is the most capable of the writers, who strive to undo the fallacious arguments of the Creationists ( a.k.a. Intelligent Design Advocates)and this often is the motivation for many of his writings.<br /><br />Young Richard Dawkins became fascinated with computer programming.  Mathematics was being used more and more in the study of animal behavior and Dawkins rubbed shoulders with some of the pioneers in this new field. I can personally relate to what Dawkins was experiencing at this point in his career. Whereas Dawkins applied computer power to biological problems, I was applying computer power to my field of polymers and formulation development. We both were intrigued by the new power at our fingertips and each made it into a personal hobby as well as a tool to enhance our area of livelihood. Now, I had already learned that Dawkins had this programming interest from reading several of his books where he introduced  the fruits of his labor. For example, using only three variables he generated hundreds of different seashells and snail shapes. In addition, by reading &#34;An Appetite for Wonder&#34;, I learned that he had mastered assembly language, which gave him the foundation to write his own new languages and generate graphical displays. My programming path was in the opposite direction. I was more intrigued by higher level  languages (i.e., Pascal) and structured programming.  Dawkins remarked that the process of computer programming, forces one to be precise. It is a mental discipline that carries over to other activities in one's life. I know that it is also true for me. Taking math courses or playing chess have a comparable effect.<br /><br />This book starts with the birth of Richard Dawkins and ends with his publication of his first book, namely: &#34;The Selfish Gene&#34;.  Dawkins felt that many evolutionary biologist's had it wrong to assign evolution's work as the preservation of individual species. Instead, he argued that evolution's work is to preserve and propagate living genes. The fact that plants and animals are born, reach their reproductive years, become parents, and eventually die, are just mechanisms to preserve these genes. Living things are born and soon die, whereas genes tend towards immortality. Simplistically stated, a plant or animal's genes determine what it looks like, how it nourishes itself,  how it reproduces, and how it survives. As conditions in the organism's environment change, so the genes adapt to optimize its survival and reproductive chances. The book stirred up the scientific community and determined young Dawkin's writing career.<br /><br />Over a ten year period, I have been engaged in extensive reading on the science of our origins. One observation I have made is that several scientists have second guessed Charles Darwin over the years. Richard Dawkins has often come to Darwin's rescue and explained where the skeptic went wrong. So, in my mind, Dawkins is the like the reincarnation of Charles Darwin for our era.  It seems that Dawkins understands the mechanism of natural selection better than most. Of course, Darwin didn't know about the role of genes, chromosomes, and DNA in the reproductive process. The merging  of this technology into Darwin's theory of evolution is the Modern Synthesis and Dawkins has written much about it. In his final chapter of &#34;An Appetite for Wonder&#34;, Dawkins tells us that Darwin is his greatest scientific hero and discusses the link that he feels with this great scientist.<br /><br />Do I recommend &#34;An Appetite for Wonder&#34; to you?  Let me put it this way, If Dawkins eventually releases its sequel as he hopes to, I will order it immediately without further consideration.  I have read the vast majority of his books with delight and welcome reading about the inside story of their inspiration and development. While it is true, that the childhood years covered in &#34;An Appetite for Wonder &#34; seemed dragged out to me, another reader might find them interesting.  I did enjoy the last half of the book a lot.<br /><br />Ralph D. Hermansen  November 15,2013ns was experiencing at this point in his career.

B0006PV5VC|1.0|I ordered this CD based on the review/rating. I was very disappointed.<br /><br />First of the all, it doesn't sound like a CD, worse than an old audio type.<br /><br />Second, I wouldn't call those 8 pieces by Stravinsky classic music at all. They are just collections of unrelated sound.<br /><br />I am not sure if I can return the CD. But I will try.
B007SGM084|4.0|I love this set. This is the second time I'm reading this my first into to a novel wish such a vivid story.<br />Great all around
0451232852|5.0|This is a fabulous story about World War I and the events leading up to it.  I fell in love with Follett after &#34;Pillars of the Earth&#34; which brought to life the fate of ordinary people during the Middle Ages.  This one makes vivid all the different countries' viewpoints and contributions to the Great War, and is extremely readable and interesting history as well.  Any history buff would love this story--I've already started reading the second of the trilogy, but this is a stand alone book as well.

B0076I624W|5.0|I happened upon this movie by accident while flipping through the channels but ended up being caught up in the story and I really enjoyed the ride.  It has become a favorite of mine.  The film score by Thomas Newman is one of my all time favorites.  Claire Forlani never looked so good.  I've never seen any actress play a woman in love any better than she does here.  Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt are also excellent in their roles.  If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.

As the story unfolds about the marriage of two doctors, one from India and one an American, and their adoption of a daughter from India, we learn how their different backgrounds inform their expectations and decisions. It is a heartwarming story of how families are created and the enduring love that binds them together.
0316055433|4.0|There was a time when Donna Tartt's Secret History was my favorite book. I recall being less taken by her subsequent novel. And now there is The Goldfinch. I don't often undertake serious literature, perhaps 15-20 books a year, preferring easier plot-driven fiction for my everyday reading. And there were stretches of The Goldfinch that I struggled through, my mind wandering. Too, I was frustrated by Theo's seemingly neverending naivety, duplicity, and surprise when the next bad thing happened. Ultimately, however, this was a rewarding journey. I enjoyed Tartt's prose, her ability to move between multiple worlds, such as fine art and drug dens, and her most important but flawed characters: Theo, Hobie, and Boris. I've read a few reviews that talked about this novel's themes of grief, morality, and aesthetics. All accurate, but what I found more interesting was the story of the development of a damaged soul, Theo, after the death of his mother. And his ultimate existential crisis when he finds he has built his life on a flawed foundation that has kept him alone and despairing. The ending seems a bit rushed as Theo explains his new existential understandings, which are not easy or trite, and which we hope will allow him a more connected and meaningful life. Tartt earned his understandings in developing his character in such depth and sympathy. I was spellbound as I finished this beautiful work.
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Finally Manga Done Right! If you love Manga you'll love this! The direction was great! Visuals great! And thankfully the actors don't wreck it. It possibly could have substituted some of the slack for a flashback to the main characters life as a kid. You know some Manga-ish back story but even with holes one of the best Manga live action films I've seen.

It is about as close as a human poet can get to climbing inside the devious (and delightful) minds of our little fur balls.

B004132HZS|5.0|I'm smitten by Benedict Cumberbatch and he can do no wrong in my mind. His sidekick is also fascinating. I often have this on as a background while I'm working since I've memorized the dialogue. I do like the way this integrates modern technology and takes the story up a notch. I'm not fond of the new TV version, but I think this is terrific.

B00EI6E17A|5.0|I am not a big Lady Gaga fan but I like the sound on this one.  Also, I love the KIA commercials because they are so cute and they ALWAYS pick a great sounding song for their commercials, catchy songs that stick in your head.  I don't believe I would ever buy a KIA because I am a Honda, Chevrolet, or Ford person, but I like the KIA commercials and the songs they use.

B00G4I0DNG|5.0|This is not as graphic as 'The Cove' but it still gives a accurate portrait of what whales and dolphins are subjected to in captivity. Sea World is a concentration camp for these beautiful intelligent creatures. Separating mothers from calves is inhumane and cruel. We now understand the importance of the bond between members of a family pod. Sea World wants you to believe that the public would not care about wild orcas's if we didn't have these 'representatives' in captivity. That is such a lame argument. We do not have blue or humpbacks in captivity do we? Yet there are millions of people to advocate for them. There is a group of people who go fight with fisherman for them. Ever heard of whale wars? Hello?!.. The truth is green greed. I appreciate this film bringing more facts and evidence that we have not heard. Beautifully done. Now I would like to see this director make another film about the wild orcra's.

Since then I have been continually impressed with everything this group takes on. This album is no exception. I will continue to buy everything they put out until i see different, but they hold themselves to such a high standard i do not expect to see the day.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Certainly addictive, but there are too many times when you can only solve a level by pure luck.  I would like to solve a level with logic rather than on the whim of the candy gods.  But I play away anyway!

0062107313|2.0|This disappointing effort by Amy Tan reads like a very long soap opera.  Truly lacking the spark which characterized her earlier works, it became an effort to finish this.  Our poor heroine slogs through one melodrama after another toward the predictable ending.  I'd read pages and pages and pages, and what?  Our heroine is still only 24???  Although it had its moments, they were few and far between.  Far too long, it's yet another book in search of a merciless editor. \\"The Valley of Amazement\\" gets stuck in the ruts of too many valleys, and needs more high peaks.  Save your time.

B00EUS9JF0|4.0|McCartney's CD &#34;New&#34; opens with a bang with the rocking &#34;Save Us,&#34; my favorite track on the set, with McCartney's electric guitar punchy & urgent.  &#34;Everybody Out There&#34; also has good energy in its simple melody with Paul's guitar line in the bridge setting up the chorus, &#34;There but for the grace of God go you and I.  Do some good before you say goodbye.&#34;  &#34;I Can Bet&#34; is a catchy pop nugget with Paul's bass line inventive, &#34;Be straight with me, Create with me, Don't wait for me to be steady.&#34;  Other tracks on the set are also strong.  Perhaps short of jaw-droppingly brilliant, this is nevertheless a sterling set from this master musician.  Enjoy!

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Chromecast is a great concept, but installation may be impossible if your TV, Android operating system, or modem/wifi router is incompatible with Chromecast.  This info may be difficult to find out in advance.<br /><br />TV: An HDMI port is required, and a USB port is helpful (a cord and adapter plug are provided in case your TV lacks a USB port and you have to plug Chromecast into a wall outlet).<br /><br />Tablet:  If you use an Android, I believe a 2.3 or later operating system is required.<br /><br />Wifi:  Some modem/wifi routers are not compatible.  You may be able to find this info on the Chromecast setup website.  At least it lists work-arounds for some incompatible routers.<br /><br />I connected the Chromecast to my TV (Sony Bravia) HDMI port and used the separate power plug, no problem. The Chromecast set-up screen came on as soon as I switched the TV input to the corresponding HDMI port.<br /><br />I connected my Android tablet to the Chromecast wifi network (go to settings, then manage wifi, then select the Chromecast option).<br /><br />The TV screen instructs you to go to google.com/chromecast/setup to download the free Chromecast app.  It would not download for me. An additional problem is that the Chromecast website is designed for a large screen laptop not a 7 inch tablet, so much of it is illegible even with maximum enlargement.<br /><br />I went to my desktop and downloaded the free Google Chrome browser so that I could read the instructions in parallel.<br /><br />It was on the Chromecast setup site that I learned that some Qwest (Actiontec) and other wifi routers are not compatible.<br /><br />Chromecast told me to call Actiontec.  Actiontec said this is a common problem and told me to call Chromecast.  An impasse.<br /><br />After more than an hour of back and forth, I decided that wasting further time for a $35 dongle made no sense.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />--I got a good aerobic workout running up and down stairs between my TV/Android andmy desktop.<br /><br />--Amazon makes returns quick and easy.  This is the first item I have ever had to return an Amazon item.  Just follow their instructions and drop off the item at your nearest UPS store (Amazon has a UPS locator).<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />--A waste of time.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Google's Chromecast HDMI Streaming media player currently falls short of my expectations as the capabilities are severely and possibly intentionally lobotomized by Google. The hardware design is very well capable of doing more but the software currently limits these capabilities. This is otherwise a very innovative product.<br /><br />All you get currently is the ability to cast YouTube, Pandora, Google Play music, Google Play Movies, Huluplus, Netflix, HBO Go, Vevo, Redbull TV, Songza, Plex, Post TV and host of other apps that might get added in the future. Casting is possible only with Google chrome browser on desktop PC running windows 7 & Mac but also requires 'chrome' extension app known as GoogleCast.<br /><br />There is an 'experimental' feature that adds the capability to cast the whole desktop which is very useful. The video and picture quality is 'average' at best. There is some noticeable lag and certain video quality are seen to be severely hampered depending on how fast your wireless network runs at. Having said, casting the whole desktop can be useful at times and might justify the purchase. You cannot cast anything yet from Android phones & tablets (Other than some limited apps like YouTube).<br /><br />The limited choice of apps (Which again might cost you money for streaming services) that this device supports currently does make this an ideal streaming media player. There are many more capable streaming media players in the market that costs a fraction more but does much more than this chromecast device from Google. If Google ever opens this device up for 'Wi-Fi' direct file transfer for display of local media from Android tablets & phone also make it 'DLNA' complaint to allow for local media streaming may be I will reconsider this purchase.

B005IF7HNA|4.0|I love this series and I'm kind of torn about giving this set just 4 stars but as many have noted you will probably have a problem playing the Miracle Day disks. While I like the idea that you can author a disk region free and any player will play it. Unfortunately this is not the case. But there are players that will play both these 50i disks AND the US disks you are used to! You can find a list of players here [...] Note only some actually convert 50 to 60 and that is what you want. The good news is most appear to be less than $100 if you can find them. If like me you watch a lot of BBC it is worth the investment. I bought the LG Electronics BP530 Blu-ray Disc Player with Wi-Fi as it was the only one on the list I could find locally. (Was worried about maybe having to try multiple models.) It works great! You CAN also get them to play on your PC IF you have a Bluray drive AND VLC with the aacs decoder added (google VLC Bluray) but you will still have to load them via the file menu with no menus and play the titles like files. The other PC players I tried did not like them at all but maybe one will.

B00EUUJ2M8|1.0|The 3D was disappointing, on par with \\"I, Robot\\" 3D which was another 3D conversion mess. No pop outs which would work great with films like these, and hardly any depth as well. The 3D is quite flat. The story is entertaining, and like the film \\"PUSH\\" has sort of X-Men characters with extraordinary abilities, although in \\"Jumper\\" it's only teleportation. I decided to get the 3D version, since I am a fan of the 2D original release. The storyline itself I do enjoy, and I would easily offer 3 stars. As I am basing this review on the 3D version only, being a 3D fan 1 star is generous.

1400069807|5.0|Hi!  How can we change the way food companies are rewarded (profit/revenue) to keep shareholders happy but save the world's overweight and obese population?  Do we call  the food industry &#34;child abusers&#34;?  This is a moral question that we have to ask.<br /><br />I knew that food companies were manipulating our brains to crave food but not to this extent.  When reading this book, I just cried for the world.  What chance does anyone have when eating food that is designed to make you crave more?<br /><br />Although my parents provided us with good food (many farms by our house), I have been a food addict since I was 8.  This addiction will end on the day that I die. Just thinking about certain foods makes me crave them until I eat them. Reading Steven Adler, Slash, Duff McKagan, Steven Tyler, and Aerosmith's books about their lives as heroin addicts/alcoholics, helped me to understand addiction.  The sugar, salt and fat in food does the same thing--hits those pleasure zones and makes you crave more.<br /><br />Fast food (if you can call it food) is designed to &#34;melt&#34; in your mouth and you won't feel satiated.  Have you ever eaten something, only to realize that it is off your plate but your brain has no recollection of having eaten anything?  I usually cook (salmon, veggies, fruits, EVOO) at home to avoid the over-salted food, sugared and fattening food.  I usually drink unsalted sparkling water.  But potato chips, ice cream, and cheese have me hooked.  Although overweight, I exercise EVERY day and am very active, which has helped my cholesterol levels and BP go down.<br /><br />Thank you, Michael Moss, for writing this book.  At least now I totally understand my food addiction.  Now I will try even harder to avoid triggers that make me crave the salt, sugar, and fat and hit the fruits and veggie aisle harder than I do now.<br /><br />I have been talking to everyone that I know about this book.  The health care community should be reading this book, too.<br /><br />When I see obese children, it makes me so sad because those kids are going to have to spend their lives, like me, wishing that they could weigh less.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was eagerly awaiting this book like so many other fans of the Divergent series and I am sad to say this book was a disappointment. My biggest complaint with this book was the constant narrator changing; I found it difficult to stay in the flow of the story. This book also lacked so  much of the charisma of the first two and I never felt sucked in like I did with the others. Obviously this is a must read as it ends the series however I am disappointed with the story and the writing.

B007SGLZH6|5.0|This book provides all the information necessary to get started baking artisan bread in systematic way: 1. Measurements are given in metric units for precision (volume measures are provided, too) plus there are bakers' percentages for easy conversion; 2. The necessity of accounting for temperature is thoroughly explained -- temperature of water, flour, room, etc. -- in order to get consistent results; 3. Methods of varying hydration, yeast amount, proofing time, temperature, etc. are provided to help understand how to get the results you want; 4. Basic equipment and supplies are clearly described and pictured. In addition to the science behind baking delicious artisan bread, there is an intriguing backstory of the author's struggles and successes in building what has become a landmark here in Portland, Ken's Artisan Bakery. One word of warning: don't expect to flip open the book and find quick recipes -- this is more about method than fixed recipes. Just like making good bread, reading and understanding this book takes patience, thought and love for tradition, slow cooking and real food.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|If you read the Bible and have some difficulty understanding phraseology, rationale, context and etc., this book is essential reading. I've been a Bible student for several years now and very few tomes have helped me understand why the Bible is written in the way we now see it. But be warned, you have to approach this with an open mind and not look for a hidden agenda in Aslan's writings. You'll find in the second half of this book, that even as a practicing Muslim, Aslan is a huge fan of the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth. His historical perspective helps pull everything together and makes the narrative of the Christ more clear.<br /><br />One of the things that always nagged me was why would the Jewish church officials, priests and holy men want Jesus crucified. Okay, he was claiming to be the Messiah and they found that blasphemous. So what. And if the Romans wanted to wash their hands of the whole deal, how could the subjugated Jews bend the Roman governor to their desires? If the Church officials of Jerusalem were the offended parties and the Romans didn't care, why couldn't the church community carry out their own dirty work. Since when does the subjugated dictate terms to the ruling class? Did Jesus' transgressions really call for scourging and crucifixion? Crucifixion is a horribly brutal way to execute someone for a non-violent crime. Particularly if you (The Romans) care so little as to try to wash your hands of the deal.  And if the Romans were indifferent, why send a phalanx of armed troops to apprehend Jesus at the Garden at Gethsemane. There was more going on here than is apparent to the naked eye.<br /><br />You want a better understanding? Read this historical perspective of the life of Jesus of Nazareth. You'll be glad you did.

B001MM28JG|4.0|Dead on send up of both crazy fans of Star Trek (something even William Shatner once remarked: &#34;get a life&#34;) and the insecure, childlike actors---very funny.  Good actors--because playing a weak person and doing it so we like you---a tough feat.  The actor who plays the alien leader (name begins with an M, Malthazar maybe?) portrays a most nuanced intriguing character, with great consistent innocence.  No irony. They all give cartoon characters 'life'.  A fun , short night of laughter, especially if you love sci-fi and its movie history.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|If you want a review you shouldn't dictate how many words a person can use.  It's a bit controlling don't you think?  No one likes to be told how many words to use to express themselves.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is such a good game and so much fun. When you play this make sure you stack up on health by buying stuff from defense max up
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|A True John Grisham novel. I really enjoy John's books, have read many, but Sycamore Row was quite the surprise.  A must read in my opinion. Enjoy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome game it's soo much fun I got it and played for hours. It is really easy to play and soo addictive!
B00CH26TL8|5.0|Love this game! I have played it at home on my PC for years now and I was so glad to see the Kindle App for Bubble Witch.
B003AVPV1O|2.0|I'm sure this is good for some folks but it wasn't good for what I needed.  I needed to extend image not mirror it.  I returned this and ordered new cables.  Still waiting for it to arrive
B00AFCEIB0|4.0|I use Google on my home PC so also put it on my Kindle. Makes it easy to look up things if you have questions.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I expect happier endings from YA series. If I want depressing stories, I'll read books like 'The Road' or 'The Lovely Bones.'
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is so addicting doing the pinning of things you want and having your own site where everything is collected.  I have this on my PC and I do it for hours on there. I was so glad to see that there was a Kindle App for Pinterest also!
B003JTHESA|5.0|Holy Eddie Batman - can these guys still ROCK or what?  Just when a 54 year old like me was feeling 'too old' to listen to one of my all time favorite metal bands, along comes this awesome CD.  I had seen IM on tour for 'Brave New World' over 10 years ago, and was so happy to see the classic lineup back.  I was lukewarm on 'Dance of Death', and 'Matter of Life and Death' had some really great stuff on it...but this one really pulls together all of the progressive elements of IM perfectly.  As the other reviewers noted, IM does not seem to be in the business of creating new 3-4 minute power poppers like 'Aces High' anymore - they are totally into progressive metal, and they really wrote the book that countless other prog-metal bands want to write a page in (DT, Symphony X, etc).  It also still amazes me that Bruce can sing today dang close to the way he did on Number of the Beast...and not many singers that have been in the hard rock game this long can say that!<br /><br />The hooks on this CD will stick in your mind from listen #1, and you will probably have trouble going too long in-between listens. Get this bad boy NOW if you are still an 'up the irons' kind of guy/gal....or just really appreciate some great progressive metal a la Iron Maiden.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|I am very happy with this purchase. My little girl love it. If you buy this doll you have win. Nice doll, clothing interrested, handsome packing, awsome accessories. Great ideas of this productor named Mattel. I LOVE IT.
B00DJ80VLS|4.0|I SO wanted to LOVE the new DT CD, and have listened to it several times before writing this review.  Like many reviewers, I am a dedicated DT fan since Images and Words, and us DT freaks get rather persnickety about their work.  I really feel that DT is moving to a truly positive space since Portnoy left, albeit a loss.  I liked 'Dramatic Turn of Events' a whole lot more than 'Black Clouds', but overall this new one just did not hit the mark.  There are some really great songs on this, but the classic DT instrumentation is sparse, and the finale piece fell short in my book...disjointed, uneven and kinda lame.  Wow, it was hard to write that about my favorite band, but I cannot simply say everything they touch is gold.  Will I buy the next DT CD?  OF COURSE.  Have they 'recovered' since Portnoy left? Oh yeah.  I was getting really tired of his '12 step program' dragged out over several CD's, which usually was the most tiresome and boring piece.  But as THE drummer and co-founder, boy do I miss him.  What I don't want to see, and I saw 'glimpses' of in this CD, is the 'ordinary' and almost Styx or Rush-like schmaltz.  I love a great poppy ballad/power rock song now and then (guilty!), but I don't like to see DT foray tooo much into that 'space'.<br /><br />One more thing - I will totally 'second that emotion' on the fact that many reviewers noticed Myung 'in the forefront finally' and LaBrie's singing is truly in top form.  Mangini is truly 'integrated' now, and has really made his mark...Petrucci, as always, is awesome.  After hearing so MANY great solos across all the DT CD's, one has to think 'well, what will he come up with now?'.  He really has some GREAT ones here.  Ruddess has his moments, and thankfully more than less as on previous CD's!<br /><br />My overall recommendation?  Get it, but this is not the 'best thing since Scenes'...but is it one of the BEST prog rock CD's of 2013? OH YEAH.
B006LSZECO|5.0|What a great read! Twists & turns galore. As a fan of true crime TV (Dateline, 20/20) & true crime novels, I found the psychological insight into these character fascinating! As a finicky reader (if a book loses me, I put it down) I can HIGHLY reccomend GONE GIRL.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|a very fun romp! well done, well written, acted and directed. all the actors did a great job. Always kept me guessing
B005XQLBU4|1.0|Very poor graphics.....could be so much better...right now it only deserves one star.....put some work in on it and it could have potential...
B00B1LN8WY|5.0|This gift was for my 17 year daughter who came upon Friends during reruns of course and fell in love with the series. She loves it.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I don't like heavy books too often.  This book was too mental.  I didn't enjoy the exposure of their world to our futuristic world; it felt cheesy.  I had to force myself to finish this book, and I wish I hadn't.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Even better than the hunger games ( in my opinion )! It kept me guessing while turning pages! I would recommend to anyone!
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Evernote is like a bait and switch product. I wouldn't bother with it, time-wise. The devices apps are designed for should be what they are intended to be - simple, easy to use, quick, and accurate. That answers my view of this app.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I like how some of it is supposed to be like the past and other parts like the future. The love triangle gets it at an even faster pace! Awesome!
1439170916|5.0|This is probably the best book I have read so far, very very engaging and a major eye opener. Truly admire the author.
0812550706|3.0|Going through the Goodreads reviews, I noticed what appeared to be a majority of 1 and 5 star reviews. This is interesting  because I find myself caught in the middle of the love/hate for the book.<br /><br />What I had the most trouble with, and what accounted for my sluggish start, was accepting the super-intelligence of Ender and his siblings. It's not that I can't believe kids of this age might be super-intelligent, rather it felt like this was an crucial element to the novel that was never explained. We are supposed to believe, if my reading doesn't omit anything, the children were born in a traditional way to average parents and yet they all have a super-intellect with two wildly different personalities (and a third which is influenced heavily by the extremes of the other two) they can use at a very young age to make a huge worldwide impact. It just really bugged me to not know why this is.<br /><br />Another obstacle that troubled me is Ender's indifference to anyone but Valentine.  I know, for the sake of the novel, I should just accept this as the real dynamic between he and his brother, parents, country and the world, but it was hard for me to buy. Even his friendships between the other students never really felt important to him and that in spite of the very authentic  expressions of friendship between them. It's just very hard for me to conceive of a human being willing to engage in the excruciating struggles he willingly submitted himself to without having some set of overarching and very transparent values, passions and/or loves to push him forward. And Ender's motive isn't very plausible or harmonious with what we're presented of his character and the goal he's striving to achieve.<br /><br />Having said that, the book is by no means boring. I admit I struggled a little to get into it at the beginning, but I was never put off a lack of creativity or interest, it was simply the problem of unqualifiedly accepting the characters as presented. As a matterof fact, the last few chapters I found very captivating and I think the novel gets progressively better (maybe I would've been hooked from the beginning if I hadn't the difficulty I've described).<br /><br />The three stars I will ultimately defend by the following: the novel is enjoyable, but lacks the necessary elements to make it great or on the verge of greatness. Again, despite accepting the end-of-the-world premise, I never really felt a lot was at stake. I was so absorbed in the character of Ender -- which was certainly captivating -- that the final goal of his training was mostly obscured.  There's also a lack pedagogy. Some people don't like that, but I do. It seems the author didn't make any serious attempts to comment on human nature, friendships, love, patriotism, etc. when the story certainly presented him with ample opportunity to do so.  That's why I wouldn't encourage you seek this out unless you're reading it for conversation with family and friends, or perhaps to compare/contrast the book with the movie. If that's the case, yes! by all means read the book. There's certainly plenty for conversation and the novel is a fun-enough that you will enjoy your time reading.<br /><br />Finally, I can't help but mention this because it might be helpful to the readers -- if there are any -- of this review. As I reflect on my own tastes in books, movies, etc., I can't help but see a pattern of being influenced by the expectations I have cultivated by the recommendations and reviews of others. I had every expectation of being blown away by this novel because so many of my family and friends have loved it (ex: my dad, who is quite a reader, has enjoyed this book from his youth and re-read it several times in the past few years because of his enjoyment) and encouraged me to read it because of their confidence that I too would love it. So maybe this is a simple case of me having very high expectations and bringing them to the novel that was inevitably doomed to let me down, like so many other stories I've had great expectations for, unless I approached it with a blank slate?
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love the way it looks and plays. not willing to pay for it, but being forced to wait is probably a good thing or I would play all day. :)
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is the best! I can't wait to level up and grow my character to the max. Woo hoo!!!
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I think this is an AMAZING album! The only reason people are giving this album negative reviews is because she hasn't been making songs that were on The Fame or Fame Monster. People need to realize that those days are over. If she were to keep creating the same music over and over her music would be boring. She is changing, as well as her music. This album shows how talented she is exploring with different types of music all on one album.
0688002307|2.0|I have always been involved with vintage motorcycles and cars and tried to read this years ago as a graduate student, as many of my professors were raving about it.  At that time, I couldn't get through it - finding it pedantic, tedious, and obtuse.  I recently read it again as a 60 something and found it even more painful.  If you are an English Lit or Philosophy professor that knows (or cares) nothing of the nature of machinery, or if you think the title will look impressive on your bookshelf, or if you enjoy page after page of long-winded, pointless, and agonizing pseudo-philosophical ruminations, you may want to buy it for maybe a dollar.  Personally, I took great pleasure in finally throwing the thing away. It was liberating.  And yes, I know that it's really not about motorcycles in the same way that Trout Fishing in America was not about fish.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|What a beautiful story. I have read many books about the Holocaust, but none more moving than this one. We must never forget the horrible treatment of millions of our fellow men.  I highly recommend this book to all.
1401917232|5.0|This is my favorite, so far, of books by Gary Renard.  I loved the first two books, and DU was a gate way into A Course In Miracles.  The book was well written and is filled with true peace, love and joy!
B0042X9L6A|5.0|Fantastic Flash..Used the cls triggering for awhile..But if serious about flash firing everytime..I would invest into Pocket wizards...Cant be this quality at $300...This is my first flash..Chose this over the sb910($500)

B000UVT3OI|5.0|What a collection! I love Garth Brooks and what he does with his music, this CD is the perfect combination of his best. It's great for in the car or around the house, can't say anything bad about it!
159463176X|3.0|\\"The Kite Runner\\" and \\"A thousand Splendid Suns\\" are two of my favorite books, especially the latter. So having just finished \\"And the Mountains Echoed\\", I cannot help but feel let down and confused.  The first half of the book hooked me in, like his others, but the second half seemed like a long, unfocussed and half-hearted attempt to add substantive length to the book. There were way too many characters spanning a 60 year period, and many of the story lines did not connect in significant enough ways to justify the time spent on their stories. There was no need for the lengthy chapter about Markos and Thalia or the section with the two brothers, Idris and Tumi I think were their names.  Although their plot lines and stories were intriguing in and of themselves, they did not contribute to the overall flow, message or conclusion of the book.  To the contrary, they distracted me from it and made it difficult to follow where Hosseini was attempting to lead his readers.<br /><br />I wanted to to love this book and I kept hoping for things to come together and connect in a more coherent and meaningful way, but in this way the book fell drastically short and left me very unsatisfied, especially because Hosseini sets the stage for this but then misses the mark completely.<br /><br />If you have read his first two books, I recommend you stop there and don't bother with this one and rather just enjoy the inspiration, humility, heartbreak and hope his first two books offer its readers.  Spend your money and time instead by  donating to and learning about Khlaed Hosseini's wonderful foundation -  [...] - that funds education, food and housing programs for returning Afghan refugees.
B003G4W49C|5.0|awesome book, hard to put down. had read it in high school but had to reread since the movie was coming out.

B002DJSBMA|5.0|Anthony Hopkins and Brad Pitt gave an amazing performance without leaving outside the co-protagonist, very well done movie even credible sometimes.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I finished The Goldfinch at 2:30 AM. If I had paid for a Masters in Fine Arts would I have learned more than reading this single novel? Visit me for more on The Goldfinch. Stephenyhoughtlin.WordPress.com
0399213015|2.0|The story is captivating for a young child and explains the process of morphosis, changing from a caterpillar into a butterfly.  I read the larger version to my children and they loved it, as it was hands-on interactive.  They were able to slip a finger into a cloth tube that resembled the action of the caterpillar.<br /><br />This mini book is too small, in my opinion, for them to enjoy it the same way.  While it may be a great idea for a parent who wants something small for the diaper bag or car, it just isn't practical and the experience is diminished.<br /><br />The larger version rates five stars.
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Just started reading this and it's odd.  To be clear, I have not read the whole thing, but I found it rather boring from the start.  I seems to pick up, strangely, where &#34;The Shining&#34; left off.  I have read every single one of Stephen King's books so I'm not unfamiliar with his books and writing.  I'm hoping this gets better.  I am a lot older than when he first became popular (high school mid 70's Salems' Lot) and I'd hoped he'd kept up with the times, but I guess I'm probably not up with the times either.  Plan to contribute to this review once I've read it
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Five stars! Fantastically sad but amAzing. A wonderful story about how life isn't always fair. I can't wait to read the sequels.
0374533555|5.0|This book presents many rational and useful facts and<br />opinions about what lies behind our overt behavior. It<br />is also a fun read.
B003B02O0A|5.0|I LOVED this book  it had everything a strong story should have.  I LOVED Jake.  It moved your emotions  and made you  angry and sad. As you read you hurt when people got hurt or died.  I look forward to other  John fetishism books.

B00AFQC4QC|5.0|Instead of the horror of World War II as we've seen in history books, Christoph Fischer gives us a look at the war from the angle of a family living through the experience. When Greta falls in love and marries a bookseller, she enters a world of harsh living. His family disapproves of her and makes her life miserable. Determined to earn their respect, she slowly wins them over, but then the war comes to their door. Beautifully written, this book captures heartache and triumph to perfection. Check this one out. You won't regret it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This book gives another prospective of the Christian religion.  Understanding what was going on during the life and time of Jesus helps with understanding how the early Christian church came about. Everyone who is interested in religion should read this.
1400032717|5.0|Brilliantly imaginative story which is extremely well told - great emotionally literacy, good character development and surprises along the way keep the reader engaged.  It's un-put-downable !!
B00F031X62|5.0|The music, the sound quality and Jimi's guitar playing on this cd are fantastic. Im not sure how Eddie Kramer put this together though. The concert (tracks 1-9) is supposedly from the Evening show, but if you have the HEAR MY TRAIN A COMIN' dvd, you can clearly see and hear that FOXEY LADY and TAX FREE are from the Afternoon show. The bonus tracks (tracks 10 & 11) of FIRE & FOXEY LADY states that it is from the Afternoon show, FIRE is, but FOXEY LADY is from the Evening show.I know this is a minor quibble, but it seems like Janie Hendrix doesnt care about details like that, as long as she can get her piece of the Hendrix pie, she'll lay back and be fat and satisfied. Anyway, as I said earlier, the sound quality and playing from Jimi, Mitch & Noel on the cd make it a must have.
B007A4SDCG|5.0|I have been hearing the inner call to follow my bliss (thanks Joseph Campbell). This book helps put the fire behind the bliss. Get to work, be humble, fail, get back to work. Seems so clear. I better get back to work...
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|What an amazing new Christmas Album to play year after year in our home. Susan's clear magnificent voice reinvigorates some of my favorite traditional Yule time songs bringing back wonderful memories of my favorite season. Her strong and well controlled vocal tones are complimented by choirs, orchestral arrangements and, my favorite, some traditional Scottish instrumental accompaniments. I think that was an excellent touch. I have so enjoyed the album, I have purchased five more to give as gifts. Very well done!
B0085TKAW6|4.0|Very interesting many historical facts included in a great novel.  A book to be enjoyed by all that are interested in the facts of both world wars .
B0010SKUYM|5.0|The name of the wind is a fantastic introduction to a well thought out world. The story is a testament to storytelling, full of character and characters.  It is a page turner to say the least and very difficult to put down.
B00FAIPDAE|5.0|I think it is pretty cool but it is so hard to get the food for the soldiers and all the buildings
B003Y5HWMW|5.0|Superb.  Season one was reasonably true to the first book. Even with so many different story lines, the acting, script, and what must have been very careful editing helped keep the story lines clean.  Great series, great DVDs.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The story wasn't entirely bad although it could have been better as I was disappointed in how it ended. I ruined the ending for myself because I read an article with spoilers so I expected it to happen and those who have read it knows what I'm talking about... However I didn't like how the end for tris was written so meaningless... I just wish there was more for her since she was such a strong person. It is what it is...

1400052181|5.0|A very gripping well written story about the real life and death of a woman whose cells were used to create the first living human tissue cultures. A must read if you are in medical or research related professions. It will give you a new understanding of why you have to go through all that informed consent paperwork, doctors in the 50s did some messed up stuff!

B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed the story and recommend it highly. It reads quickly and builds momentum. It does require knowledge of the first book or movie would be ok too. I'm going to download book 3 today!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Makes me cry and laugh every time I watch it. Great environmental lessons and more than touching, and the animation is beautiful. Strong take home messages about personal and societal expectations and fulfillment and how sometimes, the right thing is the hardest thing to do if it doesn't benefit us personally immediately.<br /><br />&#34;Unless someone like you<br />Cares a whole awful lot<br />Things aren't going to get better<br />They're not.&#34;

B005LAII62|4.0|Norman is such an odd but loveable character that you can't help but root for him throughout the movie. Any kid who's been bullied for being just a little different, regardless of what that is, can relate to his difficulties with finding acceptance and carving out a niche for himself in a difficult world, even though his personal journey of growth is related to his abilities to speak with and see the dead.
B0091QS88K|5.0|My son likes it because the game shows and tell him what to do and guide him thru the process of preparing the dishes. He can also wash the dishes, cook and set the tables.
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|Sheryl's voice is clear and unwavering.  She can really belt out a song when she wants to and can sing a soft ballad as well.  She is multi-talented as a country singer and she still has a little bit of pop mixed up in her sound.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This are the funniest games they could have made. The fact that they interact, and repeat what you say. is hilarious. My 7yrs old son LOVES this game because is like having a real cat by feeding him, petting him and feeding him to see him grow and do this that are funny.
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|Boz Scaggs has an undeniable voice all of his own.  This CD would have been much better in my opinion if he had come up with more original material.  What he does, he does well, but I believe there's room for more.  His soulful style is captivating, but would have been more so with some brand new tunes and lyrics.
B009XI7RF6|5.0|My 7 yrs old son enjoys tracing the colors and enjoys the selections that is available. He likes that it has other levels that he can reach by completing tasks.
B00DVPN30A|4.0|Haven't listened to this enough times yet to know all the songs, but so far....I like it! Amos has a strong voice always and never fails to send a message worth listening to.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Loved this book. Very easy to follow and an enjoyable read. The mesage was possitive and clear but didn't overpower the facts of the story. Would definitely recommend.
B00AGKH7K0|4.0|Eric Burdon takes me way back to the days when he was lead singer for the Animals.  This CD has proven to me that age has only made his music better.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|This is an awesome book and a great series! I read the series so quickly.  I just loved it. Highly recommended.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Very cool book.  I had read Run previously and thoroughly enjoyed it but for some reason I had put off reading more of Blake Crouch's stuff.  Totally my bad because so far I'm loving this guy's imagination.  I don't know if most of his writing follows the same theme of &#34;something bad is happening and now the protagonist must run for his life&#34; but he does a really good job at it.<br /><br />This was a fun read.  It starts with a man waking up beside a river not knowing who he is or how he got there.  Not an unheard of premise, I know, but where the story goes from there is crazy.  I couldn't put this book down.  I just had to find out what the hell was going on.  The twist at the end- BAM, hit me like a bag of hammers.  Totally didn't see that coming and I loved it.<br /><br />The only thing that kept me from thinking this book was perfect was the way some of the sentences were written.  For example, rather than saying &#34;She walked slowly to the door&#34; it was written as &#34;Walked slowly to the door&#34;.  It was a frequent thing that I found slightly annoying.  I've read some other reviews where people were more bothered by him writing William Shatner style...Where.  Every.  Word.  Is.  It's.  Own.  Sentence.  But I didn't have any problems with that at all.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for anyone who wants an interesting read with a unique twist at the end.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It works great but I had problems setting it up with my Droid phone.  I spend hours trying to figure out what was the problem and then called customer service whom couldn't help me set it up either.  I ended up having a friend bring over an ipad and  we were able to set it up in a couple minutes!  I would of give this a rating of 5 if it wasn't so difficult to set up with my phone.
B00DK9FNLY|5.0|My 12 year old loves playing this game.  It's a great game for all ages.  It is a wonderful games to download and play.
B00B5SGXRU|4.0|I like it a lot. I do miss past Depeche Mode style and feel this is somewhat mainstream and 'the norm'. Having said that, they are moving with the times and trying to make it good in clubs so it is what it is. The original Heaven mix is still the best in my opinion, and I really like Owlle mix, best on the record. It has a really cool groove.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard but it still occupies your brain.  Fun.  You can put it down and continue later.  Ran very solid.  No glitches.
B0072X2NUS|5.0|Just a fantastic dance album. Really curious which parts are Vince and which are Mart since they made this album over the internet by passing the files back and forth until complete. Always makes me feel good and gives me energy when I put it on. Would love to hear it in a club. Recommended!
B0096HFD8W|3.0|It was a good sequel. It was exactly what a campy flick should be but not a 5 star movie.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This is a fun, fast moving game! The graphics are lovely, and engaging. It offers players a tutorial while playing which quickly gives you the knowledge needed to play, and progress. Unlike many games , you don't have to try to add neighbors, in order to progress.You can connect with Facebook though, and invite your friends, and when you send an invite, you receive XP. There are fellow players that you will be able to sell your &quot;goods&quot; to when necessary, which makes it so much nicer than having to wait on friends to accept an invite. I am having a blast playing. I encourage you give it a try!
0618154051|5.0|It is so nerdy and perfect for the Tolkien lover. It provides great info on all things Tolkien and Middle Earth.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really liked this book a lot. I read it about a year after most of my friends, but the twist still surprised me. I don't want to give anything away about the plot, but I'd highly recommend it.
B00871C09S|5.0|Oh, this movie is wonderful--no trashiness, lots of suspense and great action and dialogue. James Stewart was perfect in this.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is definitely a 5 star app. I have not played this type of game before and found it impossible to put down. Loved it from start to finish. Two thumbs up to the developer on this one. This is one you don't want to miss!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Wish there were instructions. It is a matter of try,.try, try and keep trying until finally you solve the game without really knowing how it happened.
B00D5LC4GY|4.0|Challenging? Not too much. There is only 5 pieces and only so many ways those 5 pieces can fit. The key is to place the biggest piece first. It would be nice to have more pieces and larger areas to play in. Otherwise this is eternally on easy mode.
0060899190|2.0|Some interesting/inspiring things are written in here, but there are some really inappropriate things as well. I know people have those secrets, but should they have been published in this book? I was hoping to have this as a coffee table book, but there are just some things that I would be too embarrassed to have people read and wonder why I have it out. It's just a matter of opinion.
B00EU9VCKO|4.0|Lots of nice effects, easy to use. The only downside was only being able to use this to make retro looking photos. I would have liked to have given this more stars, but it needs more features. Otherwise its only something to be used on rare occasions.
B0083IQFD2|5.0|Everyone that still doubts Azealia's talent should exchange it for this. Genius and fun. This EP mixes the 90's throwback beats with Azealia's 21st century slang and rhymes.
B00B5C0YOO|5.0|I will never use all the features... not that there are a lot. What I will use is one specific tool, which this adds without root access to my samsung galaxy III. Its the ability to backup apps which I install from the app store. I like having a way to place ant apk I paid for in a safe place.
B00005JLEX|5.0|Bought this for my husband and he was very happy. All the dvds worked and played great. We will continue to add to the collection!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Brilliant book I can't wait to read the next one or to see the movie, excellent job E.L. James. Loved it
B00G32QIEG|5.0|thought this was a very cute fun movie for all ages..very funny and quite entertaining.  I like the Jeff Bridges in this movie, great accent of a cowboy.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Really cool very good details<br />Awesome and its really like real life so what I'm trying to say is awesome texture
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I have heard The Piano Guy's music for some time now have loved everything they have produced. This CD is no exception. Great musicians, great arrangements and exciting to the core.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This clever puzzle game is engaging and fun.  It is possibly the most epic game I have ever played.  I really enjoy this, especially with the extension with the epilogue.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I loved the first half of this book. I thought the second half got a little crazy.  Unbelievable.  There is a twist that comes out of nowhere. I give the first half five stars and the second half 3 stars.
B0063GORYU|3.0|Os app is much smoother and cleaner without the annoying ads..... same features, just the ads. Out of date, cheezy pop up type ads
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the roller coaster of agonizing romanticism, jolting literary fore play, and heated yearn for something more than enough within the margins of their fingered pages. I challenge said reader to try and pull away.
B00D6B4PUG|1.0|constantly tells me it can't connect 15 feet from my router, when all my other apps connect fine. Looking for another solution for Gmail on Kindle
B002MG0MF8|5.0|Amazon wants me to tell you folks why I liked this movie so much. Well where do I begin, the incomparable acting of the.master, Mr.James Stewart, the talented actors and actresses who are in this wonderful film with Mr.Stewart, or the delightful story that is' Harvey'.To me this film was a trip back in time, I so clearly remember laying on the living room floor watching Harvey for the first time with my Mom.. And I'm just as entranced by the movie today as I was way (way, way)back then. If you haven't seen Harvey yet, well heck, how big is that rock that you live under??
B00CKOZ8QA|5.0|Because this is the best work to date by the finest singer of the day!!  He has unrerouted the river!!
B0055OG2BC|1.0|The DVD will not play.  Second one.  Sometimes it will start to play, but then it stops.  Both Blu-rays acted this way.  This is the only Blu-ray I have ever had problems with.  Don't know what the problem is.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is the game. It is LEGITIMATE BEST GAME! It could be allowed little better, but other than, that, it ROCKS THE LEGITIMATE BEST GAMES EVER
0345803507|5.0|Love the series.  Very stimulating.  Have kept the trilogy to read again.  From what I have heard, you either like the series, or you find it very offensive.  You must have an open mind to enjoy.
B00ELVVAG2|5.0|This disc contains both stereo and 5.1 surround tracks in high resolution 24bit/192kHz LPCM and DTS-HDMA and sounds absolutely sensational. Highly recommended.<br /><br />I hope we see more great 5.1 releases in this new format.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I had so much fun playing  this game on to the next one i am hopeful  that it will be as fun as this one.
1936891026|5.0|I read alot of motivational, self help tomes, and I liked this one.  Great for artists, writers, or anyone needing a bit of no-nonsense inspiration....
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|A must read for all. Everyone says that about books they like. This is different. It does not point out one religion being right or wrong. It does not point out the atrocity of following false leaders. It points out the empowerment of education and what havoc lack of it can reek. It encourages the flames of bravery within each of us to speak up about injustices. Once I saw what she sacrificed, I could not help but be appalled at my own lack of voice in even small injustices lived out around me daily. It is inspiring to say the least. Life changing to say the most. Buy it, read it. Her voice will help you find yours.
B00F7YHDWC|4.0|This is  a super fun game, and I know that a lot of people-including me- don't have  a microphone for the plane game. If you go to options on the menu, you can choose whether to have the plane game or not. I just wish they had that same option for the game where you're plugging the holes in the guy, because on my kindle fire, it only registers two fingers on the screen. :(
B00942G4UA|5.0|I lived in Arkansas 8 yrs, over the hill from a chicken farmer. I saw with my own eyes how the chickens were raised.Also , the owner told me his wife went to Walmart to get chickens for a church dinner. I thought that was strange.Also , It was in the paper here in Spokane that a  shipment of wheat was refused by japan because the wheat was genically modified. We just had an election and the voted turned down labeling for modified food. a lot of the money came from Monsanto and other outside sources.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I just really wanted the pink theme for this so I had to give it a5 star rating....I don't know ifsucks yet but I really love pink do yeah
B000FCKGPC|4.0|Can't get enough of this series. Not the best one in the collection but it does set the next book up nicely with lots of foreshadowing
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|The story comes to life you just can't put it down... every day I'd be late from lunch because I was carried away in the story! It is a really good one. Total action, lots of fights, to many bad guy and a few good guys!
B00BXI0IHS|5.0|Historically accurate page turner.  The best novel I've read for months.  By far the best by this author so far.  Hopefully more are to come in the future.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game,highly addictive though. Have to be careful you will end up playing for hours. Again a great game.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|The weather channel is a great and reliable source for accurate weather. One excellent attribute is the weather warning notifications when severe weather is aproaching my area.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|The Best Lady Gaga CD Ever If You Like Lady Gaga You Should Buy It And By The Way If You Buy ARTPOP You Get The Foil CD.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great!  A bit difficult at first. Once you get the hang of it you'll love it. Creative people made this game. Thanks!!! It's Brilliant .
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|love the game. hate how they try to force you to buy add on lives and levels. I bet KING is making a bazzillon dollars off this. Wish I had thought of it first!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|The sweetest<br />The saddest<br />The sincerest<br />Book I have ever read,<br />This book was absolute perfection<br />I cried and cried.
B005EWDA3I|4.0|It brought all the strands together with enough intrigue to be exciting as things came to a head. It also left you reflecting what world were you in, a one moon or two.
0143122916|5.0|Great book....very eye opening to know that North Korea ran/runs slave camps during the 90's and probably still does.  Makes one very thankful for living in this great country.
B002N5N4MG|5.0|got them just as expected and great conditiion, I love this show and good price what else can I say.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|this is a fun game to play but is not fun waiting on friends to help you get to the next level!  someone please tell me how to do this! have asked friends but no luck
B00FJU1HLC|5.0|very funny and heart warming movie, good for a relaxing movie that the entire familiy can watch. cute characters and storyline.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Fun to play even without money but could use a few more freebie bonuses that could actually be attained<br /><br />Also...looking forward to an update soon!  Still seeing Halloween costumes and decorations and it's almost Thanksgiving.<br /><br />Overall an enjoyable game but would be nice to let long-term players be able to achieve more without having to pay.
B000W91RUG|5.0|got them just as expected and great conditiion, I love this show and good price what else can I say.
B008GM1FPI|5.0|Want to see it one more time...wait a while and see it again. Rare to find movie about thinking, and also entertaining
B001FB4VXU|5.0|got them just as expected and great conditiion, I love this show and good price what else can I say.
B00E8KLWB4|1.0|Couldn't get this to work on any of my electronics. I really do want to play it. It looks very intriguing!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard but not too easy. I like level 8 the best. I like how everything is like a timepiece for some thing else.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|I bought the game and wasn't sure if it was something I would want to play. I don't like to play games thar are too hard and games that I don't understand. After the tutorial, this game was just challenging enough but not too hard to play. I found that I enjoyed it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|awesome game not boring at all be careful it can be addictive because you will want to get to the next level
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|I fully expected this to be laggy and not have good controls. It runs perfectly and has almost everything from the pc version. Also the controls are actually very good.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great John Grisham.  There were enough plot shifts to keep me guessing the outcome all the way to the end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Ok so candy crush is so much fun,now if you are a busy person i do not recommend this game because its so fun that u get very addicted .Now if you are person that loves games i highly recommend this game.I LOVE IT
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I honestly prefer to forget having read this book. I fell in love with Four and Tris in the first book, but this book just ruined it for me. I liked the idea of the ending, but it just felt forced. This series could have gone in a more logical direction, and I'm a bit sad the last two in the series were not as good as the first.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|Good movie, a decent rent. Not much else to say honestly. If you're looking for a good action movie to keep yourself occupied, this'll do.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I love this game. It can really kill some time. I like it. I like it. I like it. I like it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|a little slow at first but by the middle it's plot twist after plot twist I wish there were more books she's such a great author!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I use my Kindle Fire for almost everything. I've only been on my laptop twice since getting the kindle. I download and use a ton of pdf docs for my business and hobbies. Downloading them directly from the web doesn't work because there is no easily accessible downloads widget on the kindle. I have office but it doesn't always download and store the pdfs. This app does it all. Web, email, and usb link. Also uploads to Google docs and Adobe cloud. Access docs with a click on the upper left button once opening the app. Even found and stored other docs I thought hadn't downloaded previously. Great app that helps me be more productive.
B008JFUQZ2|5.0|I truly love this film. A film I can watch a few times and still enjoy it. It appeals to me as an adult of 58 and the kid of 8 inside me that I wish could have seen such fine films AT my age of 8!  NOT just a robots and  monsters film. A FUN film. Visually stunning. Good story. It has camaraderie and honor in it. DO hope they go for a sequel ;-) Very good acting as well. Great cast. DEL TORO CAN DO NO WRONG!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game requires thought and trial and error. It gets harder as you get the bigger boards and more colors. It keeps my mind active and provides some fun for those times I just want a few minutes of relaxing game play.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game has the graphics and everything,it is not a waste of your time,I can't wait till multiplayer comes out! :D
B00003CXRM|5.0|Just one great movie that I never get tired of watching.  Hilarious,and the music is great also. Hope everyione has a chance to see it.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|it wont even download ughhhhhhh it dosent work I cant open it always kick me out be I can get in it! !!!!!!!!
B006IMY5ZU|3.0|Great movie to watch, that statistics are a great indicator of the future. Ordering and down loading from Amazon is so easy.
B00F0O8SZK|3.0|I have two other albums by Boyle and bought this one on the strength of the other two.  I'll start by saying that I love Christmas music and have over 300 albums that range from religious to secular.  I have a playlist on iTunes that is composed of my favorite Christmas albums and Boyle's &#34;The Girt&#34; is on that list.  But this CD won't be one of my favorites or anywhere near it.  It's not the voice or her singing but the arrangements just seem lackluster and generic.  It seems little more than &#34;elevator music&#34; or music piped through an intercom at a business.  Again, I really like other Susan Boyle CDs but I'll be selling this one on Amazon.
B003WKOU0G|1.0|Boring.<br />I now understand  why this movie was unsuccessful  at the box office. It was not at all interesting. I would not recommend  it.
B005DR64QE|1.0|Wish I could give it a -3 stars.  Totally ridiculous and pointless movie and how they got actors like Cage and Kidman to sign up for this junk is beyond me.  Total waste of an hour of my life (didn't watch it through the end) and I'm mad that I didn't check it out from the library and save the $5 it cost me.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I have a kindle fire HD and it downloaded within one minute. It's probably the quality and how good your WiFi is. Also this app is awesome!!
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Fast action, reasonably good acting, clear storyline and logical conclusion of the dramatic sequences. All in all better than many of the \\"Genre's\\" typical fare IMHO! Brad Pitt has come into his own, and needs no help from Giggly females in barely concealing attire to keep our interest nailed to the screen, with action flowing. Brad's Co-star was not known to us, but she and the wonderful children actors/actresses did superb jobs as credibly \\"scarred s***-less\\" almost victims in at least a dozen breathtaking moments as the Movie's initial plot unfolded in the first ten minutes, among Philly PA's always scarey \\"street scenes\\". Worth an hour or so on the edge of a seat in our home theatre, streamed or otherwise  brought to your screen!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This was one of my new favorite books!!!! I absolutely loved this book. Could be for either adults or young adults! Very interesting premise and story! I love the author.
B00EKHE1JA|5.0|Let's not be too critical on the dolls.  They are a nice keepsake of a great movie.  Details are better than a Pop figure or a Mighty Mugg & hey, those are collectibles too, right?
1619692368|3.0|This is the first time I buy an audio CD...I wonder if it was exactly read from the book. It felt disconnected and somehow as if its content was taken from a series of monologues from The Ellen Show, which is OK, I guess, but it does not really give anything new. I really like Ellen, I think she is hilarious in her TV show, but sometimes it feels as she is also a very aggressive sales person, she would sell anything that she thinks people will be willing to buy...even a CD with music that others wrote and performed or a book that after you finish you ask yourself &#34;did I get anything out of this book that I would not get watching her on TV&#34;...and the answer is NO, but what the heck, she is Ellen and we all like her.
B00EH486AQ|5.0|Let's not be too critical on the dolls.  They are a nice keepsake of a great movie.  Details are better than a Pop figure or a Mighty Mugg & hey, those are collectibles too, right?
B00CO52NLI|3.0|ok i got this app i love this app but.... you have to pay 7.00 $ too get all of the animal's you can only get hamsters and guineapigs... and it's bad cuz thay get hungry to fast and thay get sick to much... so please i would not wast my time and i think you should int to.... so please READ THIS.  READ THIS. PLEASE ... don't wast you're time and DONT WAST YOUR MONEY.....  ok??? ( : Thankyou for reading this....  mite be hard for littler kids.  VERY HARD !!! ''''''''''''  (: Thankyou.
B003NJPOAQ|5.0|Always a great experience with Jack's music. Thought provoking as well as melodic and joyful. If you enjoy his writing and composing style; this grouping will not disappoint.
B0028R3NCU|1.0|I intended to keep this on my key ring to prevent losing it, but the first one was DoA and the second one stopped working after 6 days and the third another week after that.  I could see no visible damage to the items and I tried several memory cards, which are still working on other readers that I have.
B000ZLJOW4|3.0|Overrated self conscious coming of age movie with a tedious amount of adolescent angst, condescension, heavy symbolism and caricature roles.  Lead roles, however, are impressively acted.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|One of his best! Mr King gets better all the time. He definitely scared the Cerberus out of me! Looking forward to the next story....so hurry up!
B00EY8A6BC|4.0|I really didn't know what to expect from this movie. The trailer is a bit misleading but I really enjoyed it. I certainly recommend it to anyone who likes twists and turns in their movies..
B00BAXFECK|1.0|Horrible characters. Horrible book.  I would never recommend this bloated saga of a repugnant character.  I couldn't finish it and I tried!
B00C81LYH2|5.0|I collect these Barbies.<br />Every Christmas I displayed the Barbie then she gets put away with the others.<br />One day my granddaughter will get them.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Phenomenal album from the greatest modern pop singer. There are some similarities from her previous work; however, she more than progresses in vocal delivery, lyrics, and production.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|I enjoyed the way she described her interactions with such accuracy. I was impressed with the immigrant stories - the challenges of becoming legal and the cultural challenges. I was a bit wary of her new relationships with men - but did get a good sense of the character of each one. I wish there was a bit more development of her relationships with other women .
0345533054|5.0|When I started reading this book I didn't think it would be as good as the other one's I've read by Harlan Coben but Harlen never fails to let us down.<br /><br />This book had so many twists and turns it was absolutely fantastic. Just when a twist took place and you thought it was coming together, then there was another turn which left you gripping the book eager to continue and unravel the story.<br /><br />I've always loved Harlen`s books and this book is another one to add to the list.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I love this book, Iam not surprise at all about Bob. , I am a cat lover and a cat owner as well
B00B7Y0206|1.0|I downloaded this app wishing it would play videos. It loaded just fine, but no matter what video I tried it would NOT PLAY.
006202406X|1.0|While I loved Divergent and thoroughly enjoyed Insurgent, I felt bored reading Allegiant and annoyed by the story which felt weak.  I couldn't keep track of whose perspective I was reading and since I read it on a Kindle it was more of a hassle to go back to the beginning of each chapter to remind myself when necessary.<br /><br />The ending was depressing and actually made me angry.<br /><br />I told my husband who is just about finished with Insurgent to not bother reading Allegiant at all and simply imagine his own ending for the series.<br /><br />I read Divergent over the course of two evenings.  Then I immediately bought Insurgent and read the whole book in one sitting.  So I was very excited for Allegiant.  I could barely get myself to finish this book and that was without even knowing how terribly it would end.  I just didn't feel connected to the story at all like I did with the previous books.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Very much enjoyed how the story played out. Great easy read and would highly recommend it to anyone. Well done
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two novels in the series, but the third just wasn't QUITE as stellar. Overall, I would still recommend the trilogy, but just realize the climax to the narrative comes earlier than expected.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Love this game. Played for days and still enjoy. Can't beat the price (free) and you can progress without spending.
141690977X|5.0|This book is fantastic!! It says every girl needs to hear, no nonsense, and hilarious. I'm recommending it to all my friends :)
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This game is amazing and I love it because it's fun and I like animals! I had this before and was pretty far but my sister reset my kindle and I had to re download it. I have no problem starting over since it's such a great game.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|This movie was incredible. Definitely for any one who likes sentiment, love, thought provoking, free will and/or modern-philosophy (as it's a rebuttal to the fundamental assumptions of Objectavisim). Don't worry if you don't get that last one, you'll love this movie anyway.
1587143879|5.0|The book has all topics wonderfully explained. Love it..<br />The book gives me easy access to topics to refresh myself rather than looking on Internet.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have never written a review, but had to about this book. Can't explain it, it is just so romantic and heartwarming at the same time. Wish I had more than five stars!!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I give this a five star love this game  awesome but  I lost all data  I have to start all over I don't want to all my gem and all the money I spend on this game really sucks.
B00BPEWNZU|5.0|Rival Sons just keep getting better with each outing! Head Down perfectly describes the rollicking, swaggering rock music contained within. Real men arrived to show how it's done. By turns you can hear shades of the Doors, Led Zeppelin, and all shades of sixties to nineties rock in between. This is one of the most talented vocalists of recent memory. Clearly, he is no solo act, his band mates are easily able to keep pace with him. The Rock and Roll train just arrived in the station. Get on. Hang on. enjoy the ride!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I loved reading this book.  The book was very engaging and hard to put down.  defiantly a 5 out of 5 can't wait for the sequel.
B008X77K8W|4.0|Chris Knight has a way of telling cinematic tales better than anyone. This is easily his best album. The recording quality is substandard at times, but, it does little to slow him down. He at times sounds like a conservative John Mellencamp. Though the two come from opposite sides of the political spectrum, clearly, they both speak for all of us. There is a workmanlike approach that is easy to discern and like in Chris Knights storytelling. These are easily his most consistent and approachable lyrics. They are direct and delivered by a man who knows what he is all about. You have to respect that. Enjoy!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can you say candy crack?! Oh my goodness this is the most addictive game ever! The only thing that I don't like is that you have to get 3 tickets from your friends to continue playing but that is really the only problem that I have! love it!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is the best app. I have eve used.  Your never without a book to read and many are free.
B00DDZM0GQ|5.0|This is my new addiction.  I love this game.  It's a great way to check out but, requires some skill so you are not bored.  It's like tetris with the ability to rearrange.  I wish there was a way to have more control over how much or how often the blocks drop.  I always play Zen mode because the other modes drop blocks to fast to actually keep up.  It's my favorite for now anyway though!
B002FQOI0A|5.0|This is a really good book! You really have to be paying attention to comprehend exactly how the plot unfolds, but when you do get it, there is a lot of meaning. The author's imagination is so amazing. I can't wait to read Liar and Spy- I already have it checked out from the library.
B000GL1BHO|4.0|The Papo Pteranodon is inspired by the Pteranodon that appeared in JURASSIC PARK III. Other reviewers have mentioned it is scientifically inaccurate in that the real Pterandon was toothless and had a concave beak. However, since the Papo version is based on the JURASSIC PARK III's  Pteranodon, it is an accurate version of the movie version.The model itself is like most Papo dinosaurs with superb, intricate detailing.<br />One complaint I have about the Papo Pteranodon is that it needs a stand to keep the model upright---otherwise it has to be propped up on or against something which ruins the aesthetics of the model.<br />Overall, I recommend the Papo Pterandon---even with its teeth and beak, it's still the best-looking Pteranodon/Pterodactyl model and a must-have model for the Jurassic Park collection.<br /><br />The movie's Pteranodon was designed by legendary creature-designer Stan Winston. The video link below shows Winston's creature in a test run for the movie.<br /><br />Link: [...]
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|I can already tell this is going to be one of my favorite YA books. It's easily the best super hero book I've ever read. As always, Sanderson creates an enthralling world that draws you in and doesn't let you go.
B0019IB0II|4.0|I was interested in this book as my mother-in-law recently had a stroke. This is an uplifting, easy to understand account of a real life experience, which ends in a positive light. I better understand how each side of the brain functions and how they for a whole person.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I checked it's reliability. It is as close as it gets here in the NW.<br />I would recommend this to others.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|Finally getting around to reviewing this game. The game play mechanics are solid. The graphics and sounds are great and above all it's educational. The game teaches graph theory through trial and error.  Make one mistake and the game is lost. I love it and keep coming back to it. Thanks for reducing the hint wait time down to one hour thats just right enough to keep you wanting to solve the puzzle on your own but it's there if you need it. One nice thing about the hint system is you can use it as many times as you like on a single puzzle but once you solve the puzzle your going to have to wait for the next hint if you need one.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This works well 4 me. I like the ease and speed it provides. I recommend this app for other kindle users.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|It helped me easily step-by-step for what I would need to put my book on Kindle. It has the first basic steps
B008OOYALE|1.0|Might be good for young kids.  NOT  much to it. Takes NO skill to play. Brainless play. I Do Not recommend it!
1451695195|5.0|It is a amazing experience of Dr. Eben Alexander . It helped me to pass the grieving time in the loss of my mother.<br />Thank you !! Dr. Alexander.<br />Lila Falconier
B009VIZDLI|5.0|A read-in-one-day kind of book. Associate Professor Don Tillman is different and he knows it. He sets out to find that &#34; someone&#34; that we all hope to find. The journey is surprising, very funny, and also quite sad at times. We see the world through his eyes, and the writing very cleverly reflects others'reactions without spelling it out. We warm to Don while at the same time seeing how hard it would be to get along with him. He has a good heart, a unique take on things, and a willingness to try and to change. Well worth a read.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book really opened my eyes and clarified for me how love relationships can succeed or fail. And it's so simple to understand and effect, if a pair is willing.<br /><br />Unfortunately my &#34;partner&#34; did not grasp the dozen signals I sent her how important it was to establish each other's &#34;love language.&#34; She ignored my clear urgings, never finished the book, and showed she had zero idea how to communicate with me. She also alienated me by doubling down and doing things she should Never do to someone who speaks my version of The Five Love Languages.<br /><br />I urge you and your partner to read this gem.

B00AB7HESI|1.0|Ok I thought this would be a good purchase because all my friends said that this game is awesome. It took forever to download. The first time I used it it said not responding. Then I tried to use it a second time and it asked me for some season pass thing. I said yes then I was caught in some kind of cycle were if I said yes it would always make sure I was sure and if I clicked cancel it would go right back to the season pass thing.
1449325947|5.0|It's a big book and long explanation, but every single detail counts, and makes me not wanting to skip any of it even though I'm not big on long explanations :-(.  I thought I had already mastered CSS in my past life, but this book gives me another perspective about CSS (disregards it's a CSS3) and a strong foundation.  I'm glad I bought it.  I've learned so much from this book; especially, after five years of being a full-time mom and have only used it once in awhile on freelance projects.  This is also another well written book that is perfect for foreigner (like me) :-)  Hands-on exercises that's what I'm going for, and many outside references and screen shot samples and comparison.  I really enjoy going through this book.

B005MELQ0M|5.0|When Maurice Sendak passed away, I thought it would be only appropriate to review what arguably, is his best children's book. &#34;Where the Wild Things Are,&#34; which captured the hearts of so many people - both young and old. In fact, it was so much loved that they even had to make a movie out of it (unfortunately).<br /><br />The story is simple. Max is a young boy with a wolf suit and vivid imagination and when he acts up a bit too much, his mother calls him a &#34;wild thing&#34;. When he gives her a cheeky reply, she sends him to his room without any supper. But once in his room, Max imagines that he is transported to a land where the &#34;Wild Things&#34; live and there his adventures begin. Of course, Max soon finds out that being a &#34;wild thing&#34; isn't all it's cracked up to be, and a lesson in reality is learned.<br /><br />One of the things that make this book so nice is that its illustrations are vibrant and evocative, while not straying from simple pen and ink simplicity. Sendak's use of colors is what gives us the most here, while the reality parts are in more muted pinks, grays and pale yellows, the fantasy parts are in more lively shades with blues and greens dominating the backgrounds combined with bolder oranges, browns and reds injected into the strange creatures that Max encounters. What's more is that these pictures almost completely fill up the pages (with only small areas set aside for the text). This means that when you read the story to your children, they will be focused on the myriad of activities going on in the illustrations and not distracted by the text on the page. Because of this, we have a story that is best read to children who aren't yet interested in reading. Of course, this doesn't mean that slightly older children who learn to read will stop enjoying this book.<br /><br />But the real beauty of this book is its text. The language is simple, but not unsophisticated. What's more, the sparse text, while telling the story in full, still allows for children to get involved in the pictures while engaging their own imaginations. Of course a children's book without a lesson is a boring book indeed, and this book has a moral to it - that is: &#34;sure it's fun and okay to build yourself a fantasy world, but eventually you do have to come back to the real one&#34;. This was Sendak's subliminal message, and a very nice one it is. What's more, Sendak has Max figure this out by himself, rather than having an adult or any other outsider try to influence him.<br /><br />One reviewer of this book said &#34;… this book deals not only with fantasy worlds but also with the emotional reality of a [tantrum], angry toddler/small child who is often terrified of his/her own emotions. ... While the fantasy sections allow for both explorations of the wildness inside as well as [a] reality check ...&#34; That reviewer also noted that this book includes a reassurance of parental love, which is an essential part of discipline. As a parent, we need to make sure that our punishments do not allow for our children to equate them to a loss of love towards them on our part, and this book strikes this balance perfectly.<br /><br />All in all, this is simply a lovely book, with beautiful illustrations and a smooth and easy text. My kids found this combination of interesting text and endearing drawings to be totally fascinating and almost intoxicating. No wonder they loved hearing it over and over again, and no wonder I never thought twice to read it to them as often as they wanted. To this day I know this story by heart, partially because my kids adored hearing this story and partially because I loved reading this story to my kids. Therefore, there is no other rating possible for this book than a full FIVE stars and I will always highly recommend it to any parent or grandparent or just anyone who is still a kid at heart.

0345806786|5.0|Movie was great but they are really two different stories.  If you care about King's vision (and/or understanding the sequel), reading The Shining first is mandatory and rewarding.
B001NLL93W|5.0|I'm hooked on this series. I read this book the fasted so far in the Mortal Instruments series. It's action-packed, full of unexpected twists and finally gives readers a bit of what we all have been hoping for while reading. This is my favorite book in the series so far.
1476727651|5.0|Advice:  Read this book ... but only immediately after reading its predecessor!<br /><br />The interplay between the two books is so strong that the later is almost incomprehensible, or at least not as meaningful, without a solid familiarity with the former.  Underscore solid.  Even if you've read The Shining before, read it again.  It will not only make the experience of reading Doctor Sleep that much more powerful, it will provide you with the context to really appreciate and have a full 360 degree perspective about the Torrance family and the events at The Overlook Hotel as described in The Shining.  And oh yah, if all you know about The Shining is from the movie ... you don't know The Shining.  Read the book.<br /><br />As for this work, I loved it.  Hard to put down each night.  Like Carrie and Firestarter, Doctor Sleep is more about psychic warfare than a pure horror novel.  The writing was extremely colorful and vivid, so much so that at times I wanted to gag, or at least not have to go into the bathroom in the middle of the night.  But mostly I enjoyed watching Daniel Torrance conquer his own past by doing toe-to-toe with it.  He had always been one of those characters you had wondered what happened with ... and this book answers it.<br /><br />As a side note, I really enjoyed the underlying theme of providence vs. chance that runs throughout the book as well as the idea of God and his involvement, or un-involvement, with the world given the presence of evil that typically leads one to the conclusion that he either doesn't care or isn't there.<br /><br />So yah, read it ... but again, ONLY after you read The Shining :)
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I can't get enough of this series. I wondered if I'd like it, as I'm many years past being a teen. The plot is fast-moving, with unexpected twists and great development of characters along the way.

0425263924|5.0|I've waited to read this 3rd installment of Crossfire series with great curiosity and my expectations haven't been disappointed.<br />In Entwined With You, Sylvia Day answers to various questions left unresolved from the previous volume, and I'm glad about it, but she leaves us with other doubts that I can't wait to be resolved!<br />We see how Gideon and Eva have grown up and changed and how their relationship became stronger and steadier.<br />I still love both characters, especially the wonderful Gideon who cherishes and takes care of Eva in the the best way possible. I can't stop falling in love harder with this lovely, powerful, strong yet fragile man. Eva is becoming more self-confident and shows much faith in Gideon and his love for her but sometimes during this volume I didn't shared her behaviour, in particular toward Brett.<br />Cary is still my favourite second character and I'm very worried about him and his future. I really hope Sylvia Day won't make him suffer too much.<br />There are many sweet, sexy and delicious scenes during the novel that always keep high your attention! The erotism is really hot!<br />I really liked it and I hope we won't have to wait too much before the release of the 4th book. Surely Gideon and Eva's fans won't be disappointed with Entwined With You, on the contrary I think they'll be delighted!

B00EV4EUT8|1.0|Upon viewing this film I was expecting to see a fairly accurate portrayal of history, but what I ended up with was a sensationalized and mostly false portrayal of the life of Eugene Allen, a butler who served in the White House under multiple presidential administrations. Instead of just telling the actual story of Eugene Allen, which by itself is fascinating, the director and producers behind this work decided to develop the film into a hateful, anti-white polemic which inaccurately portrays the civil rights movement and falsely portrays events in Eugene Allen's life that never actually happened, for instance the vicious rape of his mother and murder of his father, an event that was dreamt up in the sick minds of Hollywood producers who were aiming for sensationalism while also trying to promote the tired old &#34;whites are evil&#34; rhetoric.<br /><br />When I pay to see a film, I want to be entertained or informed. I DO NOT want to be a participant to propaganda, especially vicious propaganda that is designed to slander a particular race, namely white folk. The ancestors of the vast majority of white folks who live in America today had absolutely nothing to do with slavery. My ancestors immigrated to America after slavery had already been abolished and the same is true for the majority of white Americans. I'm sick and tired of being bashed over the head by Hollywood and the media with all of this &#34;white guilt&#34; nonsense. Is it possible to see any movie nowadays that doesn't portray &#34;evil white men&#34; or blacks being typical race victims?

I wish I had seen this in its original form, set up to look like a normal blog/vlog (in several installments), instead of seeing it in one viewing as a movie. That one is on me, but it still loses something when you see it as a movie, instead of a blog/vlog. It is still brilliant and worthy of watching, and re-watching. In fact, I may watch it right now since I'm thinking of it.
B00GN73WHM|1.0|hey ive got a great idea, lets make a show and use the clout of the marvel name and the word of mouth that geeks can create but lets make it the most boring poorly written and acted show out there, oh and by having the marvel name attached we can make people think they are going to see some great classic characters and then laugh when they are dissapointed by the fact that we have given them only d list backround characters of the marvel universe played by men and women who look like escapees from a canadian fraternity or sorority. seriously, this show stinks. but then again so does marvel. LONG LIVE DC COMICS!!!!

B001PU8N0I|1.0|I loved the Sands version of Little Dorritt with Derek Jacobi that came out in the 1980s.  In fact, I liked it better than the novel, which I read afterwards.  The series seemed to get at the heart of the story without all the melodramatic subplots that clutter up the novel-- which Dickens after all had to stuff in to keep his magazine serial going.  I wish I could see the Jacobi version again, but unfortunately it's not available on DVD.  So I tried this 2000s BBC one, and was appalled at the mess it makes even of Dickens's melodrama.  It crams all the subplots into an overproduced, overacted, and underwritten 8 hours or so, and the result is an incoherent embarrassment in which the heart of the story-- commerce's lethal effects on human relationships-- doesn't come out at all.  It's not even bad Dickens.  I stopped watching about two thirds of the way through.  Derek Jacobi, come back!

0765365278|4.0|This is my first time to actually sit down and write a review for a book on Amazon.  This was also the first Sanderson book I've read and greatly enjoys the majority of the book.<br /><br />***Minor Spoiler Warning***<br /><br />Setting and Setup:<br />The Way of Kings takes place in the fantasy world of Roshar.  The new kingdom of Alethkar is at war with the Parshendi after they took responsibility for the assassination of their king.  After years of fighting on the Shattered Plains, the war is no closer to being won.  The 10 high princes act more like loosely allied kingdoms than one.  War has been turned into a competition in which the princes race for the valuable gemhearts before the Parshendi.<br /><br />The story is told from several different points of view.  These main characters are Kaladin, the former slave turned bridge man, High Prince Dalinar and his son Adolin on the war front.  Away from the war, a mysterious Shallan Davar seeks out the heretic and scholar Jasnah, sister of the king of Alethkar.  Shallan's goals are less than legal as she plans to steal an item that will help her family stay afloat after the recent death of her father, Brightlord Davar.  The other main character is the dangerous truthless and assassin Szeth-son-son-Vallano, who was hired to kill king Gavilar, father of the current king.<br /><br />Thoughts:<br />The book is long, checking in at 1,007 pages respectively.  While the plot's pace may seem to drag a bit at times, this is the first entry in a long epic story in which time is spent setting up what is to come.  Rest assured that if you find parts slow, there is a payoff in the end.  There were a couple of twists in the plot towards the end that I legitimately didn't see coming.  On top of that, the plot was well thought out and the climax doesn't feel contrived or cheap.<br /><br />At first I didn't care much for Kaladin or Dalinar, but by the end, I cared for both and was engrossed in their journeys.  As I think about it, most of the central characters are not at all what they seem at first.  Character development and motivation are both solid and clear and the magic system is also well thought out.<br /><br />As of now, I'm very much looking forward to where book two takes the tale.  Other than the at times slightly slow pace, my only other complaint (if I can call it that) the last twist/surprise, which I won't spoil here.  I'm going to have to let that part sink in a bit.  After just finishing the novel, my gut reaction is score it between 4 and 4.5 stars.ost of the central characters are not at all what they seem at first.

B00BTV62KG|5.0|My introduction to this record was the new material at a concert with the third-string drummer and bad sound. Sco played a tele and had gear trouble. I dutifully bought the CD anyway, figuring maybe it would grow on me. Now the songs and the solos mean more to me than the previous Uberjam records.<br /><br />BTW how is this one Deux? I count Uberjam, Up All Night, and this makes three. ??? I guess it is evocative of the dada nature of the mashup music that informs the Uberjam project? It is deux because it is - no need worry about it?<br /><br />Anyway, I love Scofield's new voice. It is more beautiful and more direct than the old Sco. If you remember when he stopped using the 80's effected sound, this is as a big a change - also for the better. I wouldn't have thought his sound could be any better, but it is. It is definitely clearer - I hear more nuance.<br /><br />I feel like Scofield's playing is somehow purer on this record, but I can't put my finger on anything I could put into words. Usually when I get a new Scofield album I will chuckle here and there at something clever, but not on this one. It's still really fun and energetic, but... I don't know... it's profound work of beauty that really holds my attention. It's sincere - not that the others weren't... I guess if I could put it into words it wouldn't be music.<br /><br />The songs have a lovely vibe. The cover pic is apt. There is no youthful workin' things out - like Freakin Disco, which was fun but I don't see myself listening to it in 20 years - UJ2 just has pure music. I ripped the CD to my phone and listen to it often. I have the CD in my car and took it out once to put in Wes Montgomery's Incredible Jazz Guitar - then UJ2 went back in.<br /><br />My favorite right now is Endless Summer.<br /><br />I hope Scofield keeps putting out great records for another thirty years, and another thirty after that!

B00F5F140U|4.0|Elton John has had such a lengthy career that his music means different things to different generations of music listeners. For example, I believe I was first introduced to his music in 1976 through his &#34;Don't Go Breaking My Heart&#34;. I was about three and half years old that year, and I've liked his music ever since then. So, I missed his so-called greatest period 1970-1976, his sophomore self-titled album through &#34;Blue Moves&#34;. Instead, I grew up with what early fans would say was his weakest period musically, 1978-1989, &#34;A Single Man&#34; through &#34;Sleeping With The Past&#34;. But it was that period that really sold me on his music. It wasn't until the 1990's that I went back and bought all of his 1970's works.<br /><br />That being said, it seems as if Elton John has been on a winning streak the past decade beginning with 2001's &#34;Songs From The West Coast&#34;, 2004's &#34;Peachtree Road&#34;, 2006's &#34;The Captain And The Kid&#34; and now 2013's &#34;The Diving Board&#34; (and I'm solely focusing on his solo albums). In fact, many critics and fans are calling &#34;The Diving Board&#34; possibly the best album of his career, and more of a return to his earliest works than anything he's produced in the past decade (of course this is said every album since &#34;Songs From The West Coast&#34;.<br /><br />For me, there is something unique about &#34;The Diving Board&#34; in comparison to his previous three albums. &#34;The Diving Board&#34; seems to have more focus, more seriousness, more maturity than his previous three albums. It's as if Elton John has realized what Johnny Cash realized 20 years ago--do what you do best, do what you love, forget about trends, forget about making hits, forget about modern technology, and give your fans what they want. Johnny Cash did that over his final five albums with Rick Rubin. Lindsey Buckingham (of Fleetwood Mac) has also produced excellent solo work over the past decade. Tom Waits, Randy Newman, Paul Simon, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, John Mellencamp, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Diamond, Bruce Hornsby have all understood as well. Sting, Rod Stewart, not so much. 66 year old Elton John and 63 year old Bernie Taupin have hit upon a winning formula, and I hope they keep going all the way to THE END.<br /><br />Right away, the stripped down and direct &#34;Oceans Away&#34; draws you in. &#34;Oscar Wilde Gets Out&#34;, &#34;A Town Called Jubilee&#34; and &#34;The Ballad Of Blind Tom&#34; keep you interested. The first four tracks are some of the strongest material Elton John has put to record in many years. &#34;My Quicksand&#34;, &#34;Can't Stay Alone Tonight&#34;, &#34;Voyeur&#34;, &#34;Home Again&#34; and &#34;Take This Dirty Water&#34; are unrelenting. Finally, &#34;The New Fever Waltz&#34;, &#34;Mexican Vacation (Kids In The Candlelight), &#34;The Diving Board&#34; and bonus track &#34;Candlelit Bedroom&#34; finish off the album on a solid note. So why only four stars?<br /><br />Well, I can tell you that the three &#34;Dream&#34; interludes didn't really do anything for me. I mean, if you're going to do interludes you might as well make a song of it--like Bruce Hornsby has done many times (I personally feel Hornsby is the better piano player). So, if you subtract those three songs you are left with 13 tracks (including the bonus track). I personally felt that &#34;Voyeur&#34; and &#34;New Fever Waltz&#34; were the weakest tracks and could have been left off. I also think it's a tie between &#34;A Town Called Jubilee&#34; and &#34;The Diving Board&#34; for removal. So, if &#34;The Diving Board&#34; were a 10 track album, condensing the best tracks, shortening the playing time, and sharpening the structure of the album, it could have been a five star album (try programming only the 10 best tracks and listen to it as if it were an album and I think you'll agree).<br /><br />Before I review a new album I go back and listen to the artist's previous works in chronologicalorder. However, I did not have the time to go through all of Elton's albums. I decided to revisit only his recent works in comparison to &#34;The Diving Board&#34;. I went as far back as 1988's &#34;Reg Strikes Back&#34; and listened to every solo album in chronological order. A few years back when I reviewed &#34;The Union&#34; I had time to listen to all of Elton's works and so I will include my ratings for those albums here whilst updating my ratings for &#34;Reg Strikes Back&#34; through &#34;The Captain And The Kid&#34; here.

I give Skype 5 stars because it can help you when you don't see people very often and it can be hard but this app will help a lot because even though it's not in person, you still get to see the people you love and miss.<br />GREAT APP!!!!!!

B007HC3LHS|2.0|I was riveted by this book, and I'm disappointed in myself that I got so caught up in the story that I finished it in spite of the language.<br /><br />The author, Elizabeth Haynes, is an incredible writer.  This is the only book I've read of hers, and I would be dying to read her other work if I didn't believe that it would be just as full of bad language.<br /><br />There is a difference between the use of language to solidify a characterization and the use of language as a cheap tool to express emotion.  I believe that Haynes used explicit language as an easy descriptive out, as a cheap tool to express emotion.<br /><br />If Haynes would write without every page being bloodied by the f-bomb (only a slight exaggeration), I would happily contribute to the sum a publisher might advance to her to entice her to write more.

159463176X|2.0|Expected so much more.  Very disappointed.  Mr. Hosseini's 1st novel was extraordinary, his 2nd good -- but this one goes from mediocre to boring.  The beginning was somewhat interesting (though now too familiar;  I enjoyed getting to know 'the other side' of Afghanistan in the previous two novels, now it's enough already).... but by the middle it had become boggy, choppy, and disorganized, and the latter third just really fell apart, diffused, meandered, confused.  I gave Hosseini's wonderful, enlightening and marvelously poignant first novel \\"The Kite Runner\\"  5 stars and would've added a 6+ if possible... His 2nd,  \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\", I gave 4 stars but it was closer to 3.5 (if there'd been such a choice) -- but this 3rd book, 'And the Mountains Echoed', read as though the talented Khaled Hosseini felt pressured by his publisher or agent or perhaps artistic compulsion to write... but his heart was not in this one -- It reads forced and fragmented, as though he gathered up 5 or 6 partially-developed story ideas and mono-dimensional characters, tossed them all together in a stewpot hoping for bouillabaisse, but instead got alphabet soup.

B000B8L6LI|4.0|This is a great sharpening system. I've used it on all of my knives as well as a Big Bohica machete and it does a great job of getting everything sharp to the angle you prefer. The only mark against it is that this is not exactly 'field friendly'. It's a great home system. I do like it a lot. Just not sure I'd want to take this thing into the field or campsite with all of the loose parts it has. For the price though go ahead and buy it. Sharpen all of your knives etc. up at home with it and then get a good pocket sharpening tool (Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal) to keep your edge in the field.

B00BSB2AE4|4.0|I'm not entirely sure how I've spent an inordinate amount of time online without coming across hyperbole and a half. Last week I heard an interview with the author Allie on NOT, she sounded funny and intelligent so I decided to get her book. I'm sincerely glad I did. Her style of narrative punctuated with the comics is really fun, funny, and entertaining. I only wish the book were longer, though I suppose that's what the blog is for. Highly recommended, even if this is the first you've heard of hyperbole and a half.
006202406X|2.0|I loved Divergent and Insurgent! This book fell completely flat. The plot didn't seem to flow well with the others and what Ms. Roth did with the main character was unforgivable as it added nothing to the story.

B00G4Q3KOC|5.0|When the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776 with the stirring words &#34;All men are created equal&#34;, 700,000 residents of our newly created nation were enslaved in all thirteen colonies, some owned by the writers of the words themselves. By the beginning of the Civil War, four million men, women and children suffered in bondage. The word &#34;Suffered&#34; is used deliberately because white Americans, no matter how sensitive, do not have a full grasp on just how brutal, inhuman and sheer evil, slavery in America was.<br /><br />&#34;12 Years a Slave&#34;, (Steve McQueen director) based on the true story of Solomon Northup, is a big step in redressing this omission as it shows the daily cruelties of life on a slave plantation in 1840's Louisiana. Northup lived as a free man with a family in Saratoga, NY when he was conned into a trip to Washington D.C. (where slavery was legal) and sold down into the Deep South. The story is essentially one of a proud man retaining his dignity and his sanity against inconceivable odds. The acting is impeccable with special notice going to Chiwetel Ejiofor as Northup, Michael Fassbender as his insanely complex master, Epps; and newcomer Lupita Nyong'o as Epps’s mistress, Patsey, whose suffering is even more tragic than Northup's<br /><br />&#34;12 Years a Slave&#34; is no &#34;Roots&#34;. Despite the poster image, there are no dramatic escape scenes with baying hounds and hideouts in the bayous. Solomon does not escape; he endures. And what makes his tale so horrific is how casual is the brutality; the floggings and rapes on one extreme, the ugly racist ditties sung by the overseers to serenade those working in the fields on the other. All proceed as normally as any daily routine.<br /><br />Nowadays, it is difficult to conceive that once in our history, half the population of the United States justified slavery as a beneficial institution, defended by Scripture, good for the booming economy and a boon to the slaves themselves. Even today, if you visit some of the &#34;Plantation Museums&#34; below the Mason-Dixon Line, you will find postcards in the gift shop depicting well-dressed and smiling African-American slaves. What you won't see there but will find in this remarkable film are the viciously scarred backs of the whipped, the screaming agony of mothers being ripped from their children; the slumped shoulders of servile submission.<br /><br />This is a hard movie to watch. It is also a necessity if only to understand why African-Americans might occasionally cast a jaundiced eye on their white neighbors. We've either forgotten, glossed over and denied their history. They haven't.themselves.

B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|The setting is interesting and the writing is typical Grisham.<br />You do get involved with the characters even though some<br />are a bit cardboard. My problem with this book is that the ending<br />is very predicable, so the suspense and twist at the end was no<br />surprise. Frankly, while it is a readable book, I thought Grisham<br />could have done more with the story.

B00ERIUO02|3.0|&#34;Prism&#34; is not an album made of radio-friendly hits, that's clear. Perry wanted to come clean and let go of grudges in this album. However, most of the songs may be a little Perry-typical (&#34;I'll make it like your birthday everyday&#34; she sings), or Teenage Dream look-alikes (&#34;Legenday Lovers&#34; is an &#34;E.T.&#34; reminiscent).<br /><br />It's an album worth listening, but do so before purchasing. Some might expect a party album but it goes far from that past half the album.

0688014291|5.0|The one minute manager series is excellent guidance for rookie managers. Too many of us have conditioning in our minds from poor sources like TV, movies, previous bosses, etc. of what a manager &#34;should&#34; be like. I thought I would only need to imitate these things to be an effective manager, but that's not the case. There's a lot more to being a manager than just this book, like goal setting and motivation, but Ken sets up the bare basics for you in how to treat your people fairly and do your job as a manager effectively.

But if you look deeper, you'll see &#34;Bangerz&#34; is not a teen-pop album. With R&B and hip-hop influences, this might be the album of the year.<br /><br />When everyone though the battle was &#34;Lady Gaga Vs. Katy Perry&#34;, things got twisted since Cyrus kicked some serious butt with 2 chart-toppers. The album will not disappoint you, it gets better than the first singles.<br /><br />Strongly recommended: SMS, Maybe You're Right, Do my Thang and 4x4.<br /><br />PS. Amazon, be careful since the jewel case was cracked. The CD was unscathed, though.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|Believe it or not I had never read Stephen King before and I am in my 50s!  What a great one to start with.  The lead character is lovable and sympathetic, and the story keeps you turning pages well into the night.  I am now ready to try some other Stephen King books.  By the way, I am a historian, and King's careful attention to historical accuracy, while writing an engaging novel is most admirable.
B00DHRLK84|5.0|great movie.<br />looks better in 3d. i wasn't too pleased about the so called unrated cut of the film as it's not a major difference in plot development or gore.<br />it has a few minor changes but overall it's not significant.<br />regardless, this movie doesn't disappoint at all and is a great deal for a combo pack.
006202406X|1.0|**SPOILERS! RUN AWAY!**<br /><br />First, let's address the elephant in the room that is the topic of most discussion about this book: The ending. I want to make very clear that I am not a person who needs a happy ending in a book, nor did I even really expect one in this series. I don't read books because I expect to see \\"...and they lived happily ever after\\" on the last page. In fact if this book had ended with some flash-forward to the house and kids like certain other series did, I would have been just as annoyed. That's lame. I don't need happy. What I do need and expect, from any book, is an ending that makes sense and satisfies the story.<br /><br />This ending was not that ending.<br /><br />But I'm getting ahead of myself. The real reason I give this book one star is because the book, as a whole, was awful. I'm sorry, but this is one of the most shoddily written books I've ever read in my entire life. And I say this as someone who absolutely adored the first two books in this series. I say this as someone who read Fifty Shades of Grey ... and Allegiant has officially taken that book's place as the worst book I've ever read. And I debated somewhat on that, but I decided that Allegiant wins because, while Fifty Shades was an affront to literature indeed, I don't actually wish I could go back in time and unread it. I wish to the heavens that I had never read Allegiant.<br /><br />Let me first talk about the writing style. Roth employs the use of a dual narrative in this book, a departure from the first two books. I am not opposed to this style at all - in fact, I welcome it, as I find that a single-person narrative can sometimes be restricting. When done right, a dual narrative can allow a book to tackle parallel storylines and provide insights that you wouldn't get from following the story from one person's perspective.<br /><br />This dual perspective was a mess.<br /><br />When you use two first-person narrators, you have to (a) give them different perspectives to justify the use of this gimmick in the first place, and (b) make sure the voices are distinct so readers can actually tell who is speaking. Allegiant fails on both counts. The only reason this style was used is because of how the book ends, because beyond that there was simply no purpose for it. We did not get any new perspectives on either the story or his personality through using Tobias as a narrator. Whatever new information he learned without Tris being present, he passed it on to her anyway so it became repetitive. Outside of those moments, the two were pretty much in the same place the entire time, so we had no real parallel storylines going on, and having them in the same place made it very difficult to tell who was actually talking.<br /><br />And this is the real failure with the dual narrative: Tris and Tobias were written identically.  I, along with every single person who has reviewed this book, found myself constantly flipping back to check the chapter heading to remind myself who was talking. They were written like they were the same person, which is a shame because one of them is supposed to be a dude. What happened to Four the badass, the Dauntless legend, the one who was sensitive but tough, the one who took charge rather than let other people lead him? Well, apparently he was out buying tampons, because Allegiant turned Tobias into a 15-year-old girl. And a damn annoying one that I wanted to slap. With dueling angst-ridden girl voices, it was impossible to tell Tris and Tobias apart because they sounded exactly like each other. Actually, Tobias didn't sound like Tris in this book because Tris didn't even sound like Tris. Both characters were wildly different from how they were written in the previous books - Tobias becoming a whiny pansy and Tris a nagging know-it-all shrew. This made it that much harder to tell who was talking, since they weren't even the same people we knew. It was like they were both replaced by a third person who inhabited their bodies simultaneously.<br /><br />Roth simply does not know how to write in another voice than, presumably, her own. I predict that the narrator in her next book will sound suspiciously like Tris even if it's a 75-year-old Japanese man.<br /><br />Now that that's out of the way, let's get down to the meat and potatoes of why this is one of the worst books I've ever read: The plot.<br /><br />This entire series has been building up to the Big Reveal: What is outside the fence that surrounds Chicago? Why were these people placed here? Why was the faction society really created? Now we're finally getting our answers. And it's even dumber than I ever could have imagined.<br /><br />The series' premise was pretty flimsy. How could human beings be broken down by a single trait? Why would anyone think that segregating people based on their differences would be conducive to maintaining peace? Clashing ideals and competing belief systems have been the cause of mankind's wars since the beginning of time. And most of all, why is it no one apparently leaves the city, never even seems to occur to anyone to try? These plot holes were apparent from the beginning, but until now the story still worked mainly because it wasn't self-conscious about the premise. The previous books focused directly on the plot, not back story, and so you could ignore the \\"Why\\"s and just assume it would be addressed at the end. This book not only addresses the premise at last but brings it front and center.<br /><br />Roth has said that she didn't really know where this story was going when she first started the series. This obvious fact finally catches up with her in Allegiant, as the entire premise completely falls apart with the most illogical, nonsensical, scientifically bogus back story that was ever pulled out of a person's ass.<br /><br />Here's the skinny: Many years ago, in order to cure people of undesirable traits such as cowardice, selfishness, aggression, low intelligence and dishonesty (sound familiar?) - which were believed to be the cause of all of humanity's problems - some moron scientists figured out how to remove the specific genes that caused these traits. The alterations began to take effect after a few generations, and what they discovered was that removing the gene for one trait just enhanced another bad trait (um, duh), leading to a war between those who had been genetically altered and those who hadn't. The morons sought to correct their mistake by rounding up scores of genetically damaged people, sticking \\"corrected\\" genes in them, and locking them up in a controlled environment to wait for them to reproduce enough times for the bad genes to heal and return to a state of genetic purity (aka divergence).<br /><br />What???<br /><br />First off, any genetic manipulation, whether removing or adding a gene, would manifest right in the subject being altered. It does not take multiple generations to appear. And so, if these people had the technology to remove a gene at one time, they can use that technology to put that same gene right back where it came from - and fix it at one time.<br /><br />But even if the scientists were unaware of this, why would they put everyone in the experimental cities? If the goal is for these people to pass on these \\"corrections\\" for their descendants to be \\"fixed,\\" they could do that anywhere. And, in fact, should - reproduce with the genetically pure people so the damaged genes will be watered down. But isolating them and forcing them to interbreed will only a create a founder effect: with no variation in this small genetic population, the damaged genes they carry will only become prevalent over time. They will just as likely make the defect stronger and eventually create new and perhaps even screwier genes through mutations as they would achieve any imaginary genetic \\"healing.\\" If these people are such a scourge on society, the only reason it would be prudent to round them up in one place is so they could blow them all up at once.<br /><br />This also doesn't work as an explanation for the society being divided into factions. They say they added this \\"nurture\\" component to some of the cities to see if it would help. How would encouraging their inborn behavior help? How would this aid the goal of \\"genetic healing\\" to isolate the people even further by keeping like aptitudes together so they end up reproducing with people with the same strain of genetic damage they have? The bad genes will get even worse.<br /><br />And it still doesn't explain why no one ever leaves the city. So they were being watched. So what? These people were trapped for some 200 years with no idea what they were doing here, and no one in that time ever thought, \\"Hmm, I wonder if there's anything outside. Let's go find out\\"? Human beings are curious animals. If we were not inclined to explore our surroundings and push past barriers, most of the planet would be uninhabited. And Roth expects me to believe that an entire population stayed where they were, for that long, not knowing why they were here or why they couldn't leave, because of a fence and some guards with memory serum? How would that stop anyone? How does that explain why they never even tried? Unless the manipulations also involved removing the common sense gene, these experiments wouldn't have lasted eight weeks, never mind eight generations.<br /><br />Was this really the best she could do? It's like she just ran with the first dumb idea that popped into her head without thinking it through or doing any research despite basing the ENTIRE PREMISE around a researchable topic. Honestly, just five minutes on the Wikipedia would have told her why it wouldn't work. Science fiction needs some level of plausibility. It doesn't have to make complete sense to OUR world logic as long as we are shown why it should make sense to the story's world logic. But this doesn't even hold up within the logic of the story - the experiment is inherently counterproductive to its purpose and an unrealistic waste of time with no context provided for why anyone would be so stupid, and retroactively applying this explanation to the story presented in the first two books just creates more plot holes.<br /><br />But the worst offense is that this backstory is just anticlimactic and LAME. \\"Guess what, kiddies? Your lives are really a science project, there are cameras everywhere and people have been watching you Truman Show-style this entire time from a command center literally right down the street and yet somehow none of you ever figured this out for 200 years.\\" Great idea. That's totally believable and doesn't make everything that happened in the series feel pointless AT ALL. Please. And throwing this nonsense in at the last minute? Might as well just say the whole thing was a dream. Suspension of disbelief can only go so far, and then a story is just too dumb to take seriously.<br /><br />Sometimes a wacky concept only works if you accept it as is. She should have just left the premise alone and not tried to explain anything.<br /><br />A lot of people say the ending ruins the series. For me, it's this backstory that ruins it because I now feel like I've been led on a wild goose chase as it is clear that Roth had no real plan for her story and was making it all up as she went along. The whole thing has the agonizingly awkward feel of an author who realized too late that she wrote herself into a corner and then half-assed her way out. Here's what I think: She had this idea for this funny little city with people living a funny sort of way and wrote a book around this idea with no intention of having any larger story behind it, but then she had to write two more books and realized she needed to come up with one after all. And so she crammed a series' worth of explanations into one book to make a \\"real story\\" out of it - and somehow ended up writing a completely different story altogether.<br /><br />I think the moment shedecided to find a scientific reason for divergence was the death knell for the story, and not just because her decision to have divergence be nothing makes the whole series feel like a waste of time. It seems she couldn't think of a \\"larger story\\" that worked to this angle AND stayed in line with the plot points she already wrote, so she opted for Biology For Dummies over continuity and twisted the story right out of coherence. The radical shift in story direction from ideological warfare between factions to science run amok and civil rights, taking the characters completely out of the current plot and inserting them into a new story so random as to be irrelevant - it feels like a book out of a totally different series rather than the conclusion of an existing one. It's all too far removed from the current story, like Tris and company crossed the fence and accidentally walked into the wrong book - one with choppy writing, characters who either fade into the wallpaper or undergo lobotomies, nonexistent worldbuilding, themes as subtle as a two-by-four and plot holes the size of minivans.<br /><br />And worse, it's boring. Once the characters arrive at the Bureau the story comes to a halt and the book becomes one big infodump, but rather than making discoveries everything is just thrown at them. The big revelation felt very forced, like the author was saying to the reader, \\"Okay, this is what I came up with...\\" Just explanations upon explanations that somehow never really explain anything. And retcons! Oh, the shameless retcons. Remember when Edith/Amanda said she was a leader of an organization fighting for justice and peace and the Divergent were the signal for the people to come out? No, the video was a lie and they never wanted them to come out at all. Um, why would the video even exist, then? Am I not supposed to notice that Roth was just dropping this cliffhanger because she decided to switch tactics after Insurgent? The Bureau supplied Jeanine Matthews with the simulation serum to lead the attack on Abnegation so they wouldn't reveal this video. Um, if the Divergent are so precious, wouldn't it have made more sense to slip memory serum to the Abnegation so they wouldn't release the video, rather than instigate the slaughter of a high proportion of genetically pure people in the faction? And the big one, Natalie Prior was working for the Bureau and was inserted into Dauntless as a spy. Um, if she knew what was really going on and that the Bureau was saving Divergents, why wouldn't she help her own daughter escape? Why would she give her own life to save this video and reveal the \\"truth\\" if she knew it was a lie?<br /><br />Anyway. It's at this point that we abandon the old premise and become immersed in a flimsy new construct where people are labeled by their genes and we are served an after-school special about prejudice so preachy and obnoxious that half the time I felt like the book was yelling at me. The world outside the fence, a paint-by-numbers mashup of every dystopian cliche ever written, is never fully fleshed out and so the reader can't connect with any of it. The trips to the Fringe serve very little purpose in advancing the story, and Tobias getting involved in their \\"uprising\\" was mind-boggingly stupid. Why in the world would Tobias, who intrinsically distrusts people and expects the worst of them, accept Nita's plans on face value when he barely knows her? Because he's bothered by the fact that he's \\"genetically damaged\\"? The Tobias we know wouldn't have even cared about that. It made sense for him to fall for Evelyn's lies in Insurgent because she was his mother and he was desperate to believe in her, but he knows nothing about Nita or any of these people and has no loyalty to them. Total character assassination for the sake of an utterly random plot point. Seriously, why is this story suddenly all about a battle for genetic equality?<br /><br />And you know the whole factionless/Allegiant war, the thing the series used to be about? That all pretty much takes place offscreen and is barely even included in the book. And don't get me started on how it ends. Big Bad Evelyn, hellbent on world domination, plans to just kill everyone as the final step in said world domination plan. And she throws that all away because her son says pretty please with sugar on top. What??? Evelyn was never portrayed as anything other than a cold, calculating megalomaniac. But the son she never gave a crap about begs her to be his mommy again and, poof, she's not evil anymore? Give me a break. I might have forgiven the lack of buildup if she at least didn't cave so easily. Because it was Too Damn Easy. So easy that I wonder why Tobias didn't just do that 400 pages ago and saved me the trouble of thinking this story was going somewhere. And to top it off, Marcus just accepts her peace treaty and agrees to leave, just like that? Who are these people and what happened to the real Eatons? I actually don't mind that Marcus slinks off to who knows where and nobody even cares. It's a fitting end for a terrible man who only cared about how much he mattered over others. But I don't buy that he would cave so easily, either. What a lazy cop out.<br /><br />And speaking of crap, let's discuss the ending. From cheap racism allegory to cheap religious allegory. Tris's sacrificial death. Like I said earlier, I don't need a happy ending in a story. I am not even opposed to the main character dying. I'll let you in on a little secret: I was spoiled on this detail prior to reading the book, and my reactions were, in order: annoyance that I had gotten spoiled; sadness that Tris dies; excited curiosity for the story; and then sadness again as Tris's death sunk in and I actually cried for a half hour - and I hadn't even read the book yet. I cried because I grieved this character, not because I was angry or disappointed about her death. I thought the idea was actually pretty cool. I never would have guessed that Tris would die. How many times in these books do the heroes miraculously survive against all odds? Every time. How refreshing, in theory, for the hero to actually not make it out. I was intrigued.<br /><br />And then I read the damn book.<br /><br />I think most people who do love this ending only look at the situation within the actual moment of sacrifice: The idea that Tris would take her brother's place. I agree with this. It is literally the only authentic or believable moment in the entire book. Of course Tris couldn't let Caleb die for the reasons he said; she is way too selfless slash stupid to let someone throw their life away when she could step in for them. The theme of this whole story, as the book repeatedly tells us, is about sacrifice. Tris was Abnegation at heart, and so her actions make perfect sense in the situation. She did what she had to do. The problem, though, is why she had to do it in the first place - how the situation came about.<br /><br />When Tris offered to sacrifice herself in the previous books, it was because she found herself in a situation to do so due to circumstances beyond her control. But here the characters go out of their way to create the situation for absolutely no reason whatsoever.<br /><br />The entire storyline was contrived just to shove the sacrifice in her lap.<br /><br />The plan to release memory serum onto the people at the Bureau was totally arbitrary. They make no effort to come up with another plan to stop the Bureau from resetting the experiment, and there were much more logical options available to try. Why not work toward a plan to sabotage the vessels deploying the memory serum over the city? Why not try to evacuate everyone? Why not beg for a temporary stay of execution while Tobias talks his parents down from their war plans, since that's precisely what he ended up doing anyway? That was the reason David ordered the reset to begin with, so if they'd just done that in the first place they could have nipped the reset in the bud right off. But somehow the only thing they can think of is a mass memory wipe.<br /><br />Here is where the story lost me: They learn the Weapons Lab is rigged with death serum, but rather than set out to try to get the passcode or hack into the system or disable the trigger somehow or just THINK OF ANOTHER IDEA, they immediately elect someone to go on a suicide mission. This attack wasn't going down in the next five minutes. They had 48 hours and they make NO effort to think of a plan where someone wouldn't have to die. Well. That's conveniently stupid.<br /><br />And that death serum trap - can you say \\"random plot device\\"? Roth uses a slew of these to basically deus ex machina her way through the plot. Evelyn wants to kill everyone with death serum. The Bureau wants to stop this with memory serum. Our heroes want to stop THEM with more memory serum. It's all artificial conflict; it's contrived. Somehow there's a serum to magically fix any problem and yet the gang ignores all the myriad ways they could use them. Why not get truth serum from the Candor, since evidently it's very easy to drive in and out of the city all of a sudden, and coax the passcode out of David? Why do they need to release the memory serum en masse? Why not just get some from the Amity using it to keep people in the city and use it directly on the folks in charge of the reset? Or take the sample Tobias planned to give to one of his parents and use it on David? It is unfathomable that they wouldn't even think to try anything else with someone's life on the line. Logic, schmogic - gotta work that sacrifice thing into the story somehow!<br /><br />Amazingly, it's Tris who proposes this foolish plan in the first place. Tris can be tough and unforgiving, and I get that she would want retaliation against the people responsible for the attack that killed her parents (Retcon alert!), but she is not evil, or stupid. It was glaringly out of character for her to denounce the Bureau's plan to erase people's memories as wicked and depraved, a fate worse than death, only to then suggest doing the exact same thing to them - even though most of the Bureau workers were innocent. Why is this a better option? Her answer: It isn't, but this one saves the people THEY care about. What? Who is this person? Dismissing one group as expendable to save your own interests. The Abnegation would be proud. This moral relativism might work in another context, but it's counterintuitive to Tris's death as a testament to her selflessness for her to die committing an ultimately selfish act. The others even acknowledge what a questionable plan this is but concede that they don't know what else to do. That's not an excuse. It's not okay just because you can't think of a better idea, and for them to act like it is was also out of character.<br /><br />And in what world would Tobias think that Tris would EVER stand by and watch her brother walk to his death? She's pulled this crap before and he's always called her out on it. Maybe getting his period interfered with his radar.<br /><br />It would be different if the plan was a last-minute, last resort idea; if all alternatives were proven inaccessible and there was just no other way; if the characters had been established as morally bankrupt morons prone to jumping to extreme worst-case scenarios before working through problems rationally. But none of these is true. In her last moments, Tris says true sacrifice comes from necessity and not without exhausting other options. Exactly which options did they exhaust? This situation was not necessary; it was impulsive, irrational and just plain idiotic. And for what?<br /><br />Since this book did such a good job of effectively reducing the city to pointlessness, I actually wondered why it even mattered if the reset happened or not and why I was supposed to care - especially since literally none of the characters we cared about were in any danger. I get that they care and they need to stop it, but the larger issue of reprogramming the Bureau's agenda was laughably absurd. So they tricked one building full of people into believing in genetic equality. So what? The rest of the world still doesn't. Nothing changed beyond Chicago, and what happened here was ludicrous. They all just accepted the lies they were told? Nothing contradicted them? These people answer to a higher authority overseeing the experiment in other cities. The government would just replace these workers with new ones who hadn't lost their minds. The idea that they would let them stay in charge and turn Chicago into some GD/GP utopia wasn't believable either.<br /><br />THIS is what our hero's final moment is built on?<br /><br />I would have no problem with Tris dying, would even applaud it, if the circumstances truly called for it. As I said, I knew her fate going in, and so I anticipated a good story, an epic death for a truly epic character. A hero's sacrifice. But there are way too many holes in this story to justify a sacrifice by anyone. Roth needed to deliver Tris to her destiny but failed to create a believable, organic or even vaguely logical path to take her there, instead using cheap plot devices, actions with no logic and characters behaving woefully OUT of character to force the story into its prearranged conclusion. And while one might blame this on a lack of creative skill, truthfully I believe the problem is simply that she rushed through this book and did not take time to properly think out the plotline for her ending. The unfortunate result is a hastily put together concoction that is too flawed to support its goal. It rings false, and it is very jarring to place such a \\"real\\" moment at the end of what feels like a fake story.<br /><br />Even if we accept the nonsense that put Tris in the Weapons Lab in the first place, her death was still unnecessary. She survived the death serum by sheer force of will, proof that she did not want to die - but now the plot officially no longer required her to die. I admit I am not opposed to the irony of Tris the Invincible being taken out by something as mundane as a couple of bullets, but the scene in which David confronts and shoots her felt too convenient and contrived just to ensure her death. The actions, once again, did not feel organic to the story or the characters, and so I was acutely aware that it was not David's hand pulling the trigger, but Roth's. She was forcing the story to kill her. But why?<br /><br />When the main character dies, it should be integral to the plot. Either it was the unavoidable result of preceding actions, or the required catalyst for later actions. We know the former is not even remotely true, but what about the latter? What did her death create? If Tris could have carried out the mission without dying but was killed some other way anyway, it had to be because her death was needed to move the story forward - her death, and not the mission itself, was an instrument of change on its own.<br /><br />But her death didn't do anything. It didn't move the plot. It didn't motivate the other characters into actions that moved the plot, nor did it change them in any way. Her death didn't save the city. The memory serum would have worked the same way even if David hadn't shot her as she was setting it off. Nothing that took place in the aftermath of her death was actually the result of her death.<br /><br />Tris's death was meaningless from a plot perspective and served no purpose beyond the thematic point of sacrifice. And while the relevance of this theme to her character is clear, the failure to incorporate the necessity of her death into the narrative makes it seem merely arbitrary.<br /><br />I read Roth's blog where she explains Tris's journey in trying to understand sacrifice. The first time Tris attempts sacrifice, it's for love but unnecessary so she lives; the second time it's necessary-ish but not for love so she lives. But this last time she got itright, love AND necessity, so she dies. Congrats, Tris, you did it for the RIGHT reasons this time! You know what you believe in now! Your search for identity is over and so you've no need to traverse this earthly plane anymore. And so you shall die, because you earned it!<br /><br />I find it disturbing that this story about a girl's quest for identity, which speaks to the reality of so many young readers, ends by basically saying that since she has found her sense of self she no longer needs to go on. Becoming whole doesn't mean your job is done now! That's when the real test begins - true, honest and certain of who you are and what you want to do. This is when you start living. What does Tris gain by dying?<br /><br />This final act is meant to be the culmination of Tris's story of growth and discovery, but she achieves her growth when she realizes why she must take Caleb's place. Her understanding of sacrifice is satisfied in her willingness to die for him, because she loved him, because there was no other way; actually dying neither added to that point nor made the sacrifice any more real, and her actions don't tell us anything we didn't already know. We always knew she was selfless and brave and willing to sacrifice herself. Even though she wasn't \\"trying\\" to be sacrificial this time - she was just trying to do right by her brother - she is still doing the same thing she always does, because this was always who she was. It doesn't add to our understanding of her for her to do it again. I am also alarmed by Roth's logic that Tris's death honors her parents, who died for her. Her mother's ghost/hallucination even appears to tell her how proud she is of her. (Whatever.) Yes, when I sacrifice myself for my child, I don't want her to honor my beliefs by living a good selfless life. I want her to go out of her way to risk her life in the name of selflessness just to prove herself to me. Sure.<br /><br />Tris found her way back to Abnegation when she decided to take the risk for her brother. She did not need to die to do so UNLESS DYING WAS THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT. But it wasn't; she was able to survive this. Forcing her death is just forcing the point for its own sake, as all story outcomes would have been exactly the same if she had lived. The story did not need Tris to die. She only died because the author felt that she should, because \\"her journey was over.\\" That is contrived. That is dying for the sake of dying.<br /><br />That is pointless.<br /><br />When you do something as controversial as killing off the main character, even if it was planned that way all along, you absolutely must execute it properly. The story must be tight, the writing flawless - otherwise it falls flat. This was not executed well at all. It was not fulfilling; it was empty and unsatisfying. There was no emotional payoff, no promise of hope, no real resolution. A book with a devastating ending can leave a reader emotionally spent but satisfied, if there is some purpose to it. But this ending came off as too senseless, and so, like most senseless tragedies, it just leaves you feeling traumatized. And angry.<br /><br />Writers should not tailor their stories a certain way purely to appease the audience - that would be pandering - but a published author has a certain responsibility to take their readers' expectations into consideration. Roth once stated that she felt the Harry Potter series would have been better if Harry died - that it would have been the most powerful moment in the story and an incredible act of heroism. In explaining Tris's death, she says that Tris had earned an ending as \\"powerful\\" as she was. I am a little disturbed by her romanticized notions about sacrifice and death, obvious Christ parallels and all, in books aimed at young audiences. J.K. Rowling has said she did consider this ending for Harry, but she knew that such a twist, \\"powerful\\" or not, was just not what her audience wanted.<br /><br />Roth would do well to learn thislesson in understanding your audience. Her idea was fine in theory, maybe, but probably not for a YA fantasy series. I suspect this is why so many readers complained of feeling \\"cheated\\" by this ending - this isn't what they signed up for. Personally I love the idea of Tris going out in a blaze of Abnegation-style glory, but I'm several years outside the target market and so that may be why this type of ending doesn't bother me in principle as it does others. What does bother me, though, is how horribly executed it was. The whole affair was crap.<br /><br />The whole BOOK was crap.<br /><br />Now, I don't think all the blame for the absymal nature of this or any book falls squarely on the author. I think when a series is an established success, the editors and publisher likely don't feel the pressure to crank out a truly quality product since they know it's going to be a bestseller regardless. This book really needed three or four more rounds of rewrites before it should have ever been allowed to go to print. It reads like a rough draft. Guaranteed moneymaker or not, I can only assume the editors were drunk when they let this through.is would die. How many times in these books do the heroes miraculously survive against all odds? Every time. How refreshing, in theory, for the hero to actually not make it out. I was intrigued.<br /><br />And then I read the damn book.<br /><br />I think most people who do love this ending only look at the situation within the actual moment of sacrifice: The idea that Tris would take her brother's place. I agree with this. It is literally the only authentic or believable moment in the entire book. Of course Tris couldn't let Caleb die for the reasons he said; she is way too selfless slash stupid to let someone throw their life away when she could step in for them. The theme of this whole story, as the book repeatedly tells us, is about sacrifice. Tris was Abnegation at heart, and so her actions make perfect sense in the situation. She did what she had to do. The problem, though, is why she had to do it in the first place - how the situation came about.<br /><br />When Tris offered to sacrifice herself in the previous books, it was because she found herself in a situation to do so due to circumstances beyond her control.

This situation was not necessary; it was impulsive, irrational and just plain idiotic. And for what?<br /><br />Since this book did such a good job of effectively reducing the city to pointlessness, I actually wondered why it even mattered if the reset happened or not and why I was supposed to care - especially since literally none of the characters we cared about were in any danger. I get that they care and they need to stop it, but the larger issue of reprogramming the Bureau's agenda was laughably absurd. So they tricked one building full of people into believing in genetic equality. So what? The rest of the world still doesn't. Nothing changed beyond Chicago, and what happened here was ludicrous. They all just accepted the lies they were told? Nothing contradicted them? These people answer to a higher authority overseeing the experiment in other cities. The government would just replace these workers with new ones who hadn't lost their minds. The idea that they would let them stay in charge and turn Chicago into some GD/GP utopia wasn't believable either.<br /><br />THIS is what our hero's final moment is built on?<br /><br />I would have no problem with Tris dying, would even applaud it, if the circumstances truly called for it. As I said, I knew her fate going in, and so I anticipated a good story, an epic death for a truly epic character. A hero's sacrifice. But there are way too many holes in this story to justify a sacrifice by anyone. Roth needed to deliver Tris to her destiny but failed to create a believable, organic or even vaguely logical path to take her there, instead using cheap plot devices, actions with no logic and characters behaving woefully OUT of character to force the story into its prearranged conclusion. And while one might blame this on a lack of creative skill, truthfully I believe the problem is simply that she rushed through this book and did not take time to properly think out the plotline for her ending. The unfortunate result is a hastily put together concoction that is too flawed to support its goal. It rings false, and it is very jarring to place such a \\"real\\" moment at the end of what feels like a fake story.<br /><br />Even if we accept the nonsense that put Tris in the Weapons Lab in the first place, her death was still unnecessary. She survived the death serum by sheer force of will, proof that she did not want to die - but now the plot officially no longer required her to die. I admit I am not opposed to the irony of Tris the Invincible being taken out by something as mundane as a couple of bullets, but the scene in which David confronts and shoots her felt too convenient and contrived just to ensure her death. The actions, once again, did not feel organic to the story or the characters, and so I was acutely aware that it was not David's hand pulling the trigger, but Roth's. She was forcing the story to kill her. But why?<br /><br />When the main character dies, it should be integral to the plot. Either it was the unavoidable result of preceding actions, or the required catalyst for later actions. We know the former is not even remotely true, but what about the latter? What did her death create? If Tris could have carried out the mission without dying but was killed some other way anyway, it had to be because her death was needed to move the story forward - her death, and not the mission itself, was an instrument of change on its own.<br /><br />But her death didn't do anything. It didn't move the plot. It didn't motivate the other characters into actions that moved the plot, nor did it change them in any way. Her death didn't save the city. The memory serum would have worked the same way even if David hadn't shot her as she was setting it off. Nothing that took place in the aftermath of her death was actually the result of her death.<br /><br />Tris's death was meaningless from a plot perspective and served no purpose beyond the thematic point of sacrifice. And while the relevance of this theme to her character is clear, the failure to incorporate the necessity of her death into the narrative makes it seem merely arbitrary.<br /><br />I read Roth's blog where she explains Tris's journey in trying to understand sacrifice. The first time Tris attempts sacrifice, it's for love but unnecessary so she lives; the second time it's necessary-ish but not for love so she lives. But this last time she got itright, love AND necessity, so she dies. Congrats, Tris, you did it for the RIGHT reasons this time! You know what you believe in now! Your search for identity is over and so you've no need to traverse this earthly plane anymore. And so you shall die, because you earned it!<br /><br />I find it disturbing that this story about a girl's quest for identity, which speaks to the reality of so many young readers, ends by basically saying that since she has found her sense of self she no longer needs to go on. Becoming whole doesn't mean your job is done now! That's when the real test begins - true, honest and certain of who you are and what you want to do. This is when you start living. What does Tris gain by dying?<br /><br />This final act is meant to be the culmination of Tris's story of growth and discovery, but she achieves her growth when she realizes why she must take Caleb's place. Her understanding of sacrifice is satisfied in her willingness to die for him, because she loved him, because there was no other way; actually dying neither added to that point nor made the sacrifice any more real, and her actions don't tell us anything we didn't already know. We always knew she was selfless and brave and willing to sacrifice herself. Even though she wasn't \\"trying\\" to be sacrificial this time - she was just trying to do right by her brother - she is still doing the same thing she always does, because this was always who she was. It doesn't add to our understanding of her for her to do it again. I am also alarmed by Roth's logic that Tris's death honors her parents, who died for her. Her mother's ghost/hallucination even appears to tell her how proud she is of her. (Whatever.) Yes, when I sacrifice myself for my child, I don't want her to honor my beliefs by living a good selfless life. I want her to go out of her way to risk her life in the name of selflessness just to prove herself to me. Sure.<br /><br />Tris found her way back to Abnegation when she decided to takethe risk for her brother. She did not need to die to do so UNLESS DYING WAS THE ONLY WAY TO DO IT. But it wasn't; she was able to survive this. Forcing her death is just forcing the point for its own sake, as all story outcomes would have been exactly the same if she had lived. The story did not need Tris to die. She only died because the author felt that she should, because \\"her journey was over.\\" That is contrived. That is dying for the sake of dying.<br /><br />That is pointless.<br /><br />When you do something as controversial as killing off the main character, even if it was planned that way all along, you absolutely must execute it properly. The story must be tight, the writing flawless - otherwise it falls flat. This was not executed well at all. It was not fulfilling; it was empty and unsatisfying. There was no emotional payoff, no promise of hope, no real resolution. A book with a devastating ending can leave a reader emotionally spent but satisfied, if there is some purpose to it. But this ending came off as too senseless, and so, like most senseless tragedies, it just leaves you feeling traumatized. And angry.<br /><br />Writers should not tailor their stories a certain way purely to appease the audience - that would be pandering - but a published author has a certain responsibility to take their readers' expectations into consideration. Roth once stated that she felt the Harry Potter series would have been better if Harry died - that it would have been the most powerful moment in the story and an incredible act of heroism. In explaining Tris's death, she says that Tris had earned an ending as \\"powerful\\" as she was. I am a little disturbed by her romanticized notions about sacrifice and death, obvious Christ parallels and all, in books aimed at young audiences. J.K. Rowling has said she did consider this ending for Harry, but she knew that such a twist, \\"powerful\\" or not, was just not what her audience wanted.<br /><br />Roth would do well to learn thislesson in understanding your audience. Her idea was fine in theory, maybe, but probably not for a YA fantasy series. I suspect this is why so many readers complained of feeling \\"cheated\\" by this ending - this isn't what they signed up for. Personally I love the idea of Tris going out in a blaze of Abnegation-style glory, but I'm several years outside the target market and so that may be why this type of ending doesn't bother me in principle as it does others. What does bother me, though, is how horribly executed it was. The whole affair was crap.<br /><br />The whole BOOK was crap.<br /><br />Now, I don't think all the blame for the absymal nature of this or any book falls squarely on the author. I think when a series is an established success, the editors and publisher likely don't feel the pressure to crank out a truly quality product since they know it's going to be a bestseller regardless. This book really needed three or four more rounds of rewrites before it should have ever been allowed to go to print. It reads like a rough draft. Guaranteed moneymaker or not, I can only assume the editors were drunk when they let this through.

I love this book because through it I have learned the names of the &#34;Cars&#34; characters and can talk about them with my grandson. We use the book to play our own games...turning to a random page and matching the car we find with one in his collection.

B00FRMCYQ4|4.0|Good children's movie!  This gives a great message to young children about following your dreams and destiny!  I have watched it twice!
098478280X|3.0|Overall, it's a very good book, and it's a great way to quick start your computer science fundamentals if it's been some time since you've visited. I personally went through an Amazon interview and the book covers what that experience was like pretty spot on. However, the practice questions are often quite difficult (and no I'm not a dummy, I have  multiple degrees, one in computer science) and I feel there needed to be more easy to medium difficult practice questions. However, her advice on what topics to study were on point and the advice really helped me to prepare to answer non problem solving questions. Overall, its a very good book.
0670026182|5.0|My son came across this cookbook first and when I glanced through it, I had to have it.  Many inspiring recipes and everything I have made has been delicious.  Recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The author captures the emotions and feelings of the characters so much to where you feel like you are there. The details of all the love making scenes were exquisite!  Very exciting. I laughed, got turned on, cried and just could not put the book down. It is so well-written. Everyone wants a little Christian Grey in their life! DON'T FINISH THE BOOK WITHOUT HAVING THE SECOND ON STANDBY. ITS ADDICTING. I am75% through with the second one already so I gotta purchase the third now. Get it, you will love it.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app is amazing for meeting new friends, spelling, and your drawing schools. My kids love this app cause we can communicate with each other whenever.
B003YL4KS0|4.0|This book really has changed the way I treat my hair, after just a few days. I have hair that is wavy in some areas and curly (even frizzy) in others, but I'd almost always worn it straight until the last year. However, I was having trouble styling it curly - to get the curls to hold I was using tons of product, and then often re-applying product every morning, which made it dirty very quickly, and the curls seldom looked that great. I haven't perfected my routine yet (I will probably purchase new products they recommend in the future) but have used just a few tips from the book which have already made a big difference.<br /><br />I would give it 5 stars except that the product description on Amazon did not say that the videos included with the e-book do not work in all formats. I have Kindle for the Android and Kindle for the PC and NEITHER will play the videos (it's not user error - there's simply an image that says the video &#34;is not playable on your device&#34;). I don't know if this is true for all non-Kindle player formats ... I kind of feel this is a rip-off and wish there were a way to get the DVD as part of the package for those of us who can't watch the videos. I may actually order the book/DVD set for a friend of mine for Christmas so I can see it that way.
0307593525|2.0|This is, of course, a re-write. Unfortunately, it can be confusing, and it is not nearly as well-written as the original, although many more things have been added...
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Magnificently written!  Impeccably researched.  Deeply satisfying.  I read it aloud to my husband while on a long road trip, and we were both captivated throughout.
0316017922|5.0|Cutting edge. A must read. That said, this book has been so quoted in the last few years, that it seems positively mainstream. Nevertheless, seminal books have genius in them, and I think that this is one of those.
B00BESFWBY|4.0|Great Story and the message of don't give up on your dream is the best.  Great to have on your DVD Library shelf.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Wanted to read for myself what happened that night, to hear President Obama take most if not all of the credit actually for me took away from the original mission, the supposed secrecy of Seal Team 6 and their tactics just to get a political bump was very unfortunate.<br /><br />These men sacrifice everything to succeed and we should honor them.
006202406X|4.0|The best in a terrific series. My friends and I all rushed out to get a copy and mine was pre-ordered through Amazon. I<br />Really loved it but it made me cry.

B000VUCIZE|5.0|This was the quickest education I have ever received regarding religion, I had no idea of the vast amount of differences between each religion and the individuals practicing and their individual interpretation of their holy books.  Sam Harris did extensive research and made it so interesting to read.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I did not like this game at first but my daughter talked about it so much that I had to try it one more time.  Now I can't stop playing.  I truly love this game.

B009IU6BIS|5.0|My family has watched this movie every Christmas eve many years and on several media formats.  Now I have it on my Kindle.  We will likely watch it this Thanksgiving as we travel.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|I bought this disc used and like it enough that I will buy it again new for my library (my blu-ray disc freezes in a few spots).  If you are not sure about this film, it would help to have seen another of Terrence Malick's films, such as Days of Heaven. Yes, I agree that Tree of Life is pretentious, but that doesn't mean that you can not enjoy it.  First of all you must see it on high def on a big screen with a good sound system, otherwise, the visuals and music won't pull you into the non-narrative (I watched it on a projection screen).  I haven't seen anything this stunning since 2001: A Space Odyssey - if you didn't like or \\"understand\\" that film, you probably won't like this one.  Whereas 2001 is about the Tree of Knowledge - ape touches Tree, learns to use tools and kill, becomes man, goes into space, ascends into Heaven, ultimately transforming into the Messiah (at least that's my interpretation), The Tree of Life is all about Life, Death, the Creation of the Universe, the Wonders of the World, and Family.  No, I did not find it disrespectful of religion - I don't see why evolution can't be part of the Creator's process.<br /><br />Those who like classical music will like the soundtrack - I couldn't get Smetana's \\"Vltava\\" out of my mind after watching this, and there is plenty of other wonderful music from the likes of Bach, Berlioz, Mahler, and Tavener.  One of the characters is a \\"failed\\" musician, and there are many references to classical music, such as a quote from Toscanini.<br /><br />I find it laughable that one of the reviewers said that the only reason they gave it two stars is that Sean Penn is in it.  For me, Sean Penn's character is the weakest part of the film - whether it's the fault of the script or the performance, he does not emote enough for me to understand him - Most of the time, he just looks confused, like \\"what am I doing in this film?\\".  Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain, on the other hand, turn in fine performances - I truly believed they could be my Dad and Mom, or Husband or Wife.  My other major disappointment with the film is the ending.  I sort of \\"understand\\" it, but I expected something more visually breathtaking after all that passed before - perhaps all the characters should have danced in the air like (SPOILER ALERT)<br />Jessica Chastain did in front of the Tree - Oh, maybe that would have been too pretentious?<br /><br />***Update***<br />After watching the film a second time, I felt the need for some updates. First, I would rate the Blu-ray image and sound quality as both 9/10. The movie was was primarily shot on 35mm film using natural lighting, so there is a bit of film grain noticeable on some scenes, but otherwise the picture is about as good as you are going to get from a 35mm source.  The soundtrack is at a fairly low level, so the blu-ray producers are right when they ask you to crank up the sound whenever you start up the disc.  I did turn up the volume for the second viewing, and it made for a better experience.  More of the often whispered dialog came through.  The surround channels are subtle, and the LFE channel only kicks in when appropriate.  All in all, a very natural sounding (not knock your socks off) soundtrack.<br /><br />The second time around, I was able to better understand the structure of the film, and its spiritual aspect.  The Book of Job is quoted a few times, and after re-reading it, I can see where Terrence Malick found his inspiration.  (A few mild spoilers follow.)  In Job, a righteous man is tested by God, questioning his faith after a great loss.  A relevant quote from the Book of Job:<br />\\"Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the wondrous works of God.\\" (37:14).<br />From this passage, and others in Job describing stars, constellations, Behemoth (\\"He lieth under the shady trees\\"), and Leviathan (sea monster), the non-narrative imagery in the film make much more sense.<br /><br />A few more hints to understand the imagery:<br /><br />Water: symbolic of life, birth, rebirth.<br />Dirt, sand, desert: symbolic of death, repentance.<br />Water+sand: life+death = afterlife.
1567184855|5.0|Tallies with my own experience but proceeds to previously unexplored dimensions.  I'm grateful for these explanations and new, useful insights.
B00505ETV6|5.0|One of the great novels of the 19th century, and British television does the very best at being faithful to the original when they dramatize.
B00CWIMVDW|5.0|***NO REAL PLOT SPOILERS, MINOR REFERENCES TO ACTUAL STORYLINE***<br /><br />Long a fan of the original books by Thomas Harris and the three films, 'Silence of the Lambs', 'Hannibal' (which unlike some I consider equal to the first film), and 'Red Dragon' (which while still very well done I don't think managed to capture the horror of Michael Mann's 'Manhunter' and was somewhat hampered by its noble aim to be true to the original), but not a fan of 'Hannibal Rising' - I approached this first series out of curiosity and some degree of trepidation due to doubts as to whether it might have been a bit of a rip-off feeding off the success of the films (no pun intended).<br /><br />The first two things to say about it is that I think Hugh Dancy emerges as the definitive Will Graham very quickly. A very fine actor who inhabits his character from the word go and it is left up to the audience to keep up with him. A tortured soul, but not to the frenetic extent that an actor like Jeremy Davies ('Helter Skelter') might have interpreted the role. Yet he is suffering, just keeping his head barely above water, assaulted by what he sees and what he is able to interpret.<br /><br />I could make one observation that Hollywood tends to wade into issues to do with mental illness usually not pulling it off and ending up putting across a very misleading 'story' of what mental illness is to sufferers. I do not want to get all 'PC' about this - it is only television after all - except to make the observation that the show walks a fairly fine line with the core feature of Graham's illness - that he can think like serial killers and reconstruct crime scenes because he is teetering on the edge or falling into the chasm of a episode of mental illness.<br /><br />On the one hand, it is making a very valid observation that great investigators (in the real world) work on gut instinct, become fine interpreters of human beings; so that any investigation's success is not according to the evidence trail alone. A suspect may betray themselves by their behaviour, for example, which may lead investigators down paths the accumulated evidence, at that point in time, would not otherwise have suggested as to be warranted examination.<br /><br />I guess, personally, I had in the back of my own mind, somewhere, this slight feeling of: 'if this version of Will Graham is so unstable, why on earth would the FBI touch him with a bargepole?'...<br /><br />BUT, it is a fiction, it is Hollywood, it is a fable, and the folks who bring 'Hannibal Season 1' together do it so extraordinarily well that within the world they have created, the intensity of Will Graham's descent into 'the arena of the unwell', whilst fighting to retain his place as a highly-gifted special agent, works very, very well.<br /><br />Not that I try to find things to criticise about a show, but I really cannot find anything to point a finger at with Series 1.<br /><br />It was a refreshing and superb choice to have Lawrence Fishburne as Jack Crawford - an intimidating, tough presence on screen who works wonderfully well in the role.<br /><br />Of course, Mads Mikkelson (I think I spelt that correctly, apologies if not) is extraordinary as Hannibal. He is everything you expect Hannibal pre-capture to be - charming, learned, manipulative, dangerous, worldly, obsessive, complex, frightening - and the actor's physical appearance and European accent adds a great deal to the sense of '' apartness', of his uniqueness, if I can put it like that.<br /><br />The rest of the supporting cast, from top to bottom are also outstanding. Gillian Anderson as Hannibal's own psychiatrist is also quite extraordinary. Not a job I would want....<br /><br />Now for the warnings for those perhaps tempted to wander into the dark world of 'Hannibal S1' unawares - think of the darkest, most explicit moments of the original Jonathan Demme 'Silence of the Lambs' - an outright masterpiece, of course. But it was perhaps restrained by thetimes in terms of what the studio, and thus the censors, and finally the cinema-going public, would be able to stomach.<br /><br />It is therefore unfair to indulge in any sort of comparison between the earlier films and this latest incarnation of Dr Lecter.<br /><br />But this series is brilliantly written, wonderfully acted, superbly paced, cinematography, music, production design - you name it - it is all first class.<br /><br />What I should flag is that you will see everything that those who arrive on each crime scene see. It is not just bloody and hard to watch. This is very graphic, visually disturbing, truly horrifying stuff that takes you into the world of not just one but several serial killers. The fact that the viewer does not for some of the time know which killer is responsible for what crime scene ratchets up the tension to an almost unbearable degree.<br /><br />Like truly disturbing horror films, this series I would argue is definitely for adults only, as minors simply will not understand the full meaning of what is going on here and why, and the crime scenes are both incredibly constructed by the team behind the series but also horrifying.<br /><br />These are adults, highly trained adults, trying to deal with and overcome the most ghastly crime scenes perpetrated by very disturbed (other) adults who are hiding in plain sight amongst us, if you like, Hannibal included.<br /><br />This is however one of the great strengths of this series - it is dealing with horrific issues, ghastly material - it shows you what law enforcement has to deal with (hopefully less often than the characters in this series) and it does not let us as the audience off one little bit. Basically, 'you wanted to watch a TV series about serial killers? Well, don't say we didn't warn you....'.<br /><br />The dust jacket for the DVD I purchased from Amazon quoted one reviewer as calling the series as 'deliciously disturbing' - a clever reference to Hannibal's main pastime, and a very accurate summation of the effect this show has on the viewer.<br /><br />I found I couldn't stop watching - it was riveting, horrifying, appalling, and yes, very disturbing.<br /><br />At times, I was reminded of what Hannah Arendt observed about the 'banality of evil' - I don't want to push that comparison too far by comparing a fictional TV Show to one of the most appallingly barbaric periods of world history since the dawn of time (The Holocaust), except to say that with the capture of one particular killer played with beautiful understatement by Lance Henrikson, who is caught sitting almost nonchalantly in his armchair, it makes the horror of what his character wrought, which we have already seen multiple times in preceding scenes, in some ways all the more horrifying and unfathomable.<br /><br />If I am not mistaken, at some point in one of the early episodes, one of the staff working at the Behavioural Sciences Lab at the FBI (Jack Crawford's lair, if you will) makes the oft-observed comment that the FBI estimates that at any point in time there are around 13-15 serial killers operating within U.S. borders (a real statistic, apparently, not TV make-believe).<br /><br />When you contemplate a statistic like that (and I am writing all the way from Australia, and we have had our fair share of serial killers proportionate to our relatively tiny population...) it adds to the plausibility of everything put before us as viewers indulging in this bone-chilling series.<br /><br />But this series achieves something more than that. By the end of the final Season 1 episode, which I will not spoil for you, I really felt a little like Will Graham's character - in need of a good lie down, a few sessions with a Psychiatrist (whose background I had thoroughly checked first, of course), and a lot of time in the sun smelling the roses.<br /><br />I consider myself a fairly seasoned, psychologically tough viewer and cinema-goer who has seen just about everything those with aslightly twisted/demented sensibility like to throw at us.<br /><br />Well, the folks behind 'Hannibal' have taken things to a whole new level, have not just pushed the envelope but eviscerated it. It is expertly crafted.<br /><br />The creators of 'Hannibal' have successfully achieved the premise that those in pursuit of serial killers are to varying degrees caught up, and thus either permanently or periodically crippled, by the horrors they have to confront in order to catch the perpetrators. There is much psychological pain and suffering on show, most superbly captured by Hugh Dancy's powerful performance in the lead role.<br /><br />This series was full-on, do not underestimate its brilliance but also its impact. It will leave you shaken, but also stirred by the superbness of what has been achieved in a series like this.<br /><br />The team behind 'Hannibal' took the subject matter entirely seriously, chose an absolutely stellar cast to bring their vision to the screen, and it is quite simply one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed shows I have seen in a long, long time.<br /><br />I am looking forward to S2 - by the time of the release date of the S2 DVD, I should have just about recovered sufficiently from S1...
0812993292|5.0|I have a penchant for British novels dealing with that English eccentricity that is both hilarious and moving. This book delivers everything I love about English writers. You love the outrageousness and the belief in something more in life than what you've lived and never ending hope and true love that seems buried and cold after 20 or 30 years. How quickly we all forget these things and how wonderfully they are found here. It's not at all predictable or cliche and will surprise you along the way. Just an excellent and satisfying read. I couldn't ask for more.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I just finished this book today after purchasing it over 3 weeks ago ... It was painstakingly hard for me to read; I just kept putting it down after a chapter or two...<br /><br />Firstly, I loved Divergent. LOVED IT! Insurgent was a great read also; not as good as Divergent was but I still enjoyed it and couldn't put it down. I finished both books quickly and even read them again which I rarely do. So my excitement for Allegiant was very high. I even marked my calendar for the book release date like a nerd! And then after that, it was a huge let down. I felt betrayed by the author. I felt like she just rushed to write this book without really putting any heart or soul into it just to get it out on the book shelves. Maybe the publishers were pressuring her to get it out? Maybe she was just too busy? Maybe she was dealing with health issues or family issues?? I don't know but I am so disappointed!! I wish that this book could be erased and she could take her time and write the book that we were all anticipating.<br /><br />So one of my biggest let downs was Tobias' character. What the heck happened to him??? He completely changed!! I loved him in the first 2 books...he was dark and mysterious and sexy. This book he turned into a pathetic, whiny boy. Completely turned me off from him. And I HATED that each chapter went between Tris and his point of view. I would keep forgetting who was speaking because their views seemed the same and they had no depth as characters.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERT**<br /><br />The second big let down was what was outside the fence. I was expecting crazy, drama, action-packed. Hey, I would have even dealt with a zombie apocalypse; but no. We were stuck inside an airport the whole book bored to tears with all this dull information. It was hard to read at some points. GET ON WITH IT! LETS GET SOME ACTION! Even I could have been more creative!<br /><br />The third big let down was the ending. Tris died. Quick. Tobias grieved. The end. See ya later. Awful. I hated it. It just left me feeling empty. And angry.<br /><br />And I can go on and on about the other negatives of the book. The characters had no depth, Evelyn decided not to start a war and kill thousands of people because her son asked her not to one day, Tris died in place of her brother Caleb and he just kept on living as a coward and disappeared, Peter's mind got erased but he kept on living as an a**hole and disappeared, David got away with murder because he has an erased mind, ETC ETC ETC.<br /><br />I don't think I have ever been disappointed with a book like this one.<br /><br />Veronica Roth, I want a re-do.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a novel that will stay with me for a long time.  Markus Zusak created characters that are unforgettable.  I hope the film can live up to my expectations.
B004OR199G|4.0|Great book, easy read. She presents the concepts on a very easy way to understand why it is important for you to make change. So glad I found this book by accident.
044042335X|4.0|I am rating this before I have even finished it.  When it starts good that is all it takes.  Know it will be great like the others. just love his books. stories different and the end is always something I don't plan on.
B004UOE7VA|5.0|I love this album, my favorite electronica, different artists but their styles are cohesive , definitely my go to album for my subway commute
B00BSB2AE4|4.0|This was a really clever and funny book. But also parts are very serious. I would not read this book if I were depressed to start. The drawings are whimsical and lighthearted, masking the drama of the topics underneath.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|Interesting film about a Japanese National Treasure, Jiro! You'll be hungry for some sushi while watching, so plan ahead! The only problem is that you'll want to book a trip to Tokyo to experience Jiro and his son in action.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|for such a simple concept for a game the packageing adds a little something extra that makes the game so fun and a real time sick.
B00FHATBGW|4.0|There was only one glitch toward the end of the game where an inventory item was lost.  I restarted the game and played through without any problems.  The puzzles were good and the help gave just enough information to know what to do.The journal was nice and saves you from having to keep your own notes.  The only complaint I have is inventory items are sometimes hard to use and don't match the cursor position.  Overall, it was worth the cost and has replay value.  The two bonus chapters are a plus.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|The only things I don't like us not enough lives and some levels take days because they are hard...it really makes me not want to play anymore at times.
B00E9PXI3S|4.0|I am giving it 4 stars in part I would to see more of them together making love.<br />These two women was passion about each other in the movie I though more passion was require hope another movie with more passion then they can it passions 2 but for this movie it is fine.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Easy to use. Don't have to buy any more bookcases ;-) Allows me to put the books where I can find them easily.
B009E9R1IM|5.0|I've always been a Led Zeppelin fan, so when I heard about this release, I had to own it. Besides, it's timeless, it's vinyl, and it's ZEPPELIN!!
B000QCQ8XA|5.0|This book it witty and well written, it goes from making you want to cry to making me laugh.  I highly enjoyed reading it and also feel like it is an accurate representation of grief.
B00466HM28|3.0|good but unable to make it work with anything that isint ableton live this imo is for ableton live owners only
B00EKJWS1Q|4.0|This thing works great.You can check all your Outlook folders with ease.The only negative is the free version does come with ads.
B00FEHXCIG|1.0|Do I care what happens to any of the characters? No, they are as thin as pixels. Is there any suspense because I fear the &#34;hero&#34; will lose? No. Iron man is a super genius because he makes great outfits. Should I get excited because the Iron Man Outfit is at Version 3? No, my I-Phone is already at V7.<br /><br />Through genetic manipulation, the vilain glows red hot. Why doesn't Iron Man simply glow white hot to defeat him?<br /><br />Yawn, Yawn, Yawn.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just amazing I love these books and off u like these you'll love Divergent. It's a very amazing<br />Book and a great series
0452295548|5.0|This book tells a lovely story that is intimate, scientific, poetic, enjoyable, digestible, relevant, and applicable. The person who reads it will make new discoveries that will empower and provide hope. As a newly graduated nurse, this book offers me relevant insight into patient centered care, widened perspective for  compassion, and evidence-based science. Congratulations to Jill and &#34;thank you&#34;  for giving this insight to the world!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Worth every penny. I love electric machos layer and the theme game play.  I look forward to the thanksgiving theme.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Awesome!!!!! this game is fantastic. this blows pandemic 2 out of the water. one of the best games for android devices.
1476729085|5.0|I was reading this book in public and laughing so hard I had tears coming down my face. This is great story telling. Don's perfectly portrayed and I was rooting for him all the way. This was not your typical love story, but it warmed my heart. Shining light on the heart and mind of an adult on the spectrum gives hope to a whole new generation. Go Aspies!
B00E9A656K|5.0|I played this on my girlfriend's android before I had one, I played it on mine once I got one and I even tried to find a boot-legged copy for my kindle fire. Then I'm looking through the appstore two days ago and BAM! There it is. Thanks so much for finally bringing this to the kindle!
B005HJWWW8|4.0|Have you ever complained about bare sound when using medium-sized or large headphones?? If so, get this to power up everything!!! You won't regret!!! And with its rechargeable battery you don't have to worry about disposable batteries again, and you can charge it while using it. This includes an USB cable for charging it (actually it's a mini-usb connector, if you already have it), two audio cables, the shortest one has elbow-ends, and a par of clips, but they're not that sturdy, not at all...<br />But there are some flaws, for example, when batt drains at all, volume and eq setting will be restored to defaults. I'd love it if volume control were analog, and there's no warning when batt is close to run out!! Imagine listening to your favorite music when suddenly the sound stops, then you think, something happened to either your PC sound card, cellphone, MP3 player, or the headphones themselves!! With an audible or light warning, that might be less disappointing. Oh, and by the way, batt has a runtime for approx 10 hours or so. And just a little advice, please turn it off when not in use. There's also a small flaw, when you're charging the amp while using it, you might notice some noise like poor FM signal or so, but this only happens sometimes, and when charging is around a half.<br />Even if there are such flaws, this will pump you up!!! I'm using it with Philips SHP2000 and it really works!!! Before that, I had to turn up the volume to max, so I hope I could hear something, but how, I don't have to raise volume more than a quarter in my PC, and almost an 80% on the amp, so everything is different. Feel the deep bass!!! This is awesome!!!
B0052FYPJK|5.0|I liked every thing about this book<br />And I would recommend this book to any martial artist<br />I chose this rating out of  enjoyment  and inspiration<br />I am a black belt and enjoyed this read<br />Peace!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|The minions are so cute when they run. It is kinda like temple run and subway suffer . So if you like running games this is the game for you
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|To finally be able to play Candy Crush on my KF is like playing for the first time!! Iblove the plasma-like screen response.......everything is just so squishy and wet! lol. Wonderful performance so far.<br />Now,  how about a bullet train to Windows8 devices??!! Very early 2014 beckons Candy Crush hither.
1451695195|5.0|Loved this book. Probably the only thing to get me caring about life and the afterlife in decades. I was raised catholic so you know how that goes...
B003157DTM|3.0|I bought this for a friend's daughter for her birthday present at the suggestion of my friend.  It didn't come packaged in the box like the picture shows and it was also quite small.  Without the packaging, I kind of felt like it didn't look like much of a gift.  The 5 year old I purchased it for did like it and does enjoy playing with it.
006202406X|1.0|I am so disappointed in this book, and not because of the ending. I feel like I was reading a rough draft of a book, not a finished product. The writing was stilted and juvenile. I felt like each line was being force fed to me, like Roth didn't believe I was intelligent enough to draw my own conclusions. Or maybe she just hadn't figured out what she was doing so she had to keep reminding herself. Also, the characters were completely flat and one dimensional. Why switch between characters when they're the same person? I was really looking forward to a strong ending for the trilogy. I thought Divergent was interesting and had so much potential. But this book proved that even author's can be one hit wonders.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I am addicted to this Show. It almost makes you think that it could be possible. The story line is great and has substance to it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is an addicting and very fun game for all ages and genders i guarantee it. I can not stop playing it whenever i have down time or when I'm just bored
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is the second time I read the book. It has a great story line about uprisings and revolution. It is about overcoming oppression and standing for what is right. There is also a little love story going on as well. Cleverly written. Highly recommend!
1250038820|5.0|Brandon's photos are amazing.  As a Brooklyn, NY native, I think Brandon truly captures the essence of NYC ~ we are all different, yet we are the same..  Highly recommend this book!!
B000W022XG|5.0|I've bought this CD twice because it's that awesome. I heard it in a record store years ago and immediately had to buy it. Years later I loaned it out and it was lost. Now I have it back and it's just as good as I remembered.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|One of the absolute worst big budget movies I have ever seen.  The script is horrible. The pacing is horrible. The acting is forgettable. Avoid this at all costs.
B0044DEAUA|5.0|Speedy delivery, great packaging! Once I tried this product it was better than what I expected, it's stress free to drive, and be on the phone, I don't worry about getting a ticket for being on the phone any more. The sound is pretty good, and it's easy to use !
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Enjoyed the fantasy of a Utopian place to live. The characters are interesting. Plot intriguing. Made me wonder how I would live in a place like this. A bit scary too.
B00F1CRSKM|5.0|Wow! I love this one great to put on a rock out to! Very interesting one you need this for your soul.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|One of the Best books that I ever read so I read it twice.  What a well written story!  I couldn't put it down.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Great twists and turns as usual. Perhaps a new, recurring character introduced?  For those familiar with Pendergast, you will likely enjoy the uncharacteristic displays in this one.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|This was the weakest links in all of the James Bond movies.  There is really nothing else to say here, except disappointing
0812550706|3.0|Unlike much science fiction I have enjoyed:<br />however if you like more fantasy and less science then this is for you.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It gives full details so you can make plans.  You can choose  to track the weather in various locations with just a click of the mouse.
B00AEDDSTI|1.0|Hard to get the rave reviews for this middling affair. I can understand the Fight Club/Gen X adoration for this type of faux nihilism, but the prose is stiff and uninvolving, characters laughably underdeveloped. And perhaps one of the most ridiculous, inappropriate endings I've ever read.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|A very good documentary about the band from my teen years. A lot of good behind the scenes information as well as home movies. I liked the current interviews of the guys talking about the old days. They admit to the drug use and all of the other things that went on but most of the them straightened up and cleaned up. I wish it had at least some recent concert footage but it's cool to see the old concert footage. Well worth the price to add to a collection. I highly recommend it for Eagles fans.
0618918248|2.0|Lacks any new or interesting ideas.  For a book coming over one hundred years after Thus Spoke Zarathustra, it adds surprisingly little to the conversation.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book started a little slower than the first.  That being said it was well worth the wait for this story to take off.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|This game is ok but gets boring when you hit levels that are impossible to complete until the game just randomly gives you what you need to complete it. There is some amount of strategy to it but the strategies prove useless when a level is just impossible. More a luck of the draw game and something to pass the time. Also, the music is monotonous and annoying. Also makes me want to eat candy!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I could not put this down after the second chapter.  Well written and never a dull moment living vicariously through Andrew Wiggins.
B00902S0IS|5.0|A  science fiction classic ahead of it's time. remember seeing it when it first came out. The Id manifest as an invisible  monster scared the heck out of me. In my opinion, it was by far the scariest movie monster of the fifties and perhaps of all time. Invisible and would appear out of no where- freaky. Although today manifesting the Freudian concept of the Id as a monster has lost a lot of appeal, but in the psychology obsessed fifties it was considered very cerebral. No one gives much credence to the concept of the existence of an ID anymore.  Although as a metaphor it might still be very valid. Sort of a Science fiction spin on &#34;Beowulf&#34;.
B00FN811SY|3.0|Please make it accessible to Kindle Fire, I'd like to be able to have access to the library and study.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|My wife's family has many trays of old slides that I am going to digitize for them.  I researched for an inexpensive way to accomplish this and chose the DBTech. The first one I received would not recognize an sdcard but I was able to scan 5 slides with the internal memory. The procedure is a little awkward but it is easy enough and does a good job of scanning the slides. I returned it and ordered another one which works great. The second one seems to want to hold on to the slide so it takes a little tug to get it out. Would have given 5 stars if not for that.<br /> Oh by the way make sure you have an sdcard on hand or order one if you buy this. I bought a 16 GB card And I think it will be big enough to capture all the slides I have, the counter says I can scan 9999 of them.  The scanner manual says it can take a 32 GB card max.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Since it was getting close to Christmas time I didn't know what my little brother wanted.  I know that he has other Disney movie but didn't know which ones he has.  So I called him up and asked him.  This is not the one he owns.  Before buying this movie I rented it.  I love to play games and it has I do believe every character known to man of every game out there.  I thought that it was going to be too violent, bad language, bad images, nope this movie has none of that.  Being a gamer I actually like this movie but since I love playing games I think I was bi est about this one.  I actually wanted the DVD and digital copy only but had to pay a little extra for the 3D and blu-ray copy as well.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Awesomeness Inc. I think this game is awesome and it's the bomb.com. I would recommend this game to my best friend so they can get the app on their Kindle.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a game for youth and adults. The colors and effects are varied and fun. I like it better on my kindle fire than on Facebook because I don't have to depend on others to advance.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|You made this the greatest app ever. I like it very much. It was great to add a tutorial for everything even the recorded music.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|I understand why many have shrugged off this movie, but I feel like they're missing the point.  This is an action film of &#34;Robots vs. Godzilla&#34; that utilizes every cliche just for the fun of being able to.  To me, it seems like del Toro wanted to have a bit of fun, but still managed to pull off a little bit of camp without a healthy helping of cheese.<br /><br />Yes, some of the characters are cliche.  There are stoic kung fu triplets, harsh blonde Russians, hopelessly clueless governments, and an over-the-top black market dealer, to name a few.  While some characters are far too heavy handed as to be annoying (looking at you, nerdy neurotic science duo), most are cliche enough to be fun, but the viewer still cares about their deaths and/or is drawn into the tension of their near death experiences.  I was surprised that I felt a little bummed when the first character died, about 10 minutes into the film, which I find rare in most modern action films.  And in an age when so many action movies care more about how much their monsters can destroy, (looking at you, Man of Steel) rather than a little character development, I can live with a little unoriginality in favor of a good old fashioned, if predictable, cinematic arc.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I loved The Shining and was excited to find out about little Danny Torrance. This book was full of intrigue, suspense, surprises, action and so much more! I could hardly out it down!! I recommend everyone read this book....especially if you're already a fan of The Shining.<br />Absolutely wonderful!!
B008D19WBQ|1.0|I was so disappointed with this &#34;complete&#34; box set.  There is nothing complete about it.  Each episode is missing the extended cuts.  I can't enjoy watching the chopped up episodes.  I grew up on the dvd set and have almost every episode memorized..... And the blu ray set is missing every single extended clip.  The worst part is that I had to waste over $200.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I personally wouldn't have ended the series like this - but the whole story - all 3 books, were well paced, intriguing and kept my interest. I can't wait for the movie in March.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I have recently started reading this series and have enjoyed every minute of it. After reading the first installment i have continued to get book after book.
B000VDDDY6|4.0|I previously gave this remastered version one star. I based my review of the remaster on primarily The Doomsday Machine which I saw on tv. The problem I guess with this is that The Doomsday Machine was episode 35 and from season two. Now as I begin this review I want it to be known that I am content and happy with the changes in the remastered version as long as the original non remaster continues to remain available to the public. The original version needs to remain in availability so that fans can own both, so fans can have the improved version and the sometimes dated original version. For instance, the remaster features an eye blinking GORN in the episode titled \\"The Arena\\". The original version did not have an eye blinking Gorn. In the remaster in the episode \\"Charlie X\\" the Thasians show up in a green space ship sort of thing. The ship mostly just suddenly appears and it looks mostly like green light. In the original version the ship just looked like a green cloud. These are big differences. The biggest change that I've seen thus far in season one, and I only have three episodes left to watch, was in \\"The Galileo Seven\\" episode. In this episode the clouds and the planet's atmosphere are very GREEN for some reason. On the one hand, if you like this new GREEN look then ok, but for me to much LOVE and attention was given to this episode. The lavish greenness of the atmosphere and clouds just doesn't complement or continue the continuity of the episode's tone. And the high definition of the episode makes the crashed shuttle craft look very space worthy. One would not know that this shuttle craft had crashed in the new version. And the new graphics, the high definition, and the special effects, do not help this small shuttle craft to look as vulnerable and fragile as it looked in the original version. And if you compare both versions you will find that the original version has the shuttle craft going from left to right after Spock ignited the craft's fuel supply. The remaster gets it backwards and they go from right to left.<br /><br />But for the most part the new images of the USS Enterprise look damned good. Sure, the series has been tampered with in a mighty way but really what has happened is season one has been updated to look more like the modern Star Trek shows. Now the original can more easily stand beside STNG, Voyager, etc. All that has really taken place is all the in space shots have been updated. All the planets the Enterprise encounters are updated with a new look, and not that the original look was inferior. Personally I think the original look was fine. The biggest improvement is the new updated look of the Enterprise. The Enterprise looks more ballsy and beautiful in the Remaster. For a guy who has watched Star Trek to the point to where it's an exercise in tedium, this new look was a reason to pay more attention to the show. No, I don't think all the CGI changes are improvements, but many of them are. That said I don't really like the idea of the alien ships looking updated or different. This is why both versions should be available to the fans, so we can compare and value both versions.<br /><br />Also, the themes song for the show was re-recorded. There is a new \\"soprano\\" voice, a new female, singing in the newly orchestrated version of this song. I personally think the new girl's voice and the orchestrated version of the song is inferior but the song had to be redone to go with the new images on the screen, don't ask me why because I am not a film student. If you compare the in space images of the original Enterprise to the new version you probably will agree that the new look enhances the series. Gone is the clunky dated look of the past. You would not think the old space images are that dated unless you compared the new images with the old. Kirk, Spock and the gang look way cooler now as they prowl the universes in search of new life and new civilizations.<br /><br />And the changes of the new series are not shrouded in mystery, I know what I know because I watched the \\"extra data\\" or whatever it is called, on the discs. Most of the discs contain information that explain the changes that were made to the show. I don't think now that it was a big money grab on the part of the owners of the show. Mostly the remastered version of Star Trek was just an attempt to improve on the weakness of prior technology that went into the show. Sometimes the original version prevails in areas and many times, probably more times, the remaster has improved upon the original creation.<br /><br />Don't worry though, the content of the episodes has not changed in any way. I also do not see any areas thus far where part of an episode has been lost. All the character dialogue remains intact. All the scenes are intact. Episodes such as \\"The Alternative Factor\\" and \\"The Conscience of the King\\" continue to be just as boring as when they were first televised. Yes, even with all the help that this high tech this age can provide, boring episodes are usually just as boring. I now understand \\"The Alternative Factor\\" episode better than I did when I was a kid but it doesn't make it any more entertaining. And the same goes for \\"The Conscience of the King\\". Kodos the Executioner is still one boring guy as is the episode.<br /><br />What the high definition of season one does offer though is the presentation of many fine looking women. Yes, they look better than ever. One thing I also noticed in season one was how various women were introduced. Some how when various women were shown a special sort of lighting was used to make the women look as if they had some sort of special aura about them. This was how the original series portrayed these women, in that special light. It's just something to look for. I've come to expect it now as I go from episode to episode. The special lighting given to key women in various episodes was to make them appear to be even more lovely. After a while though as I've noticed it it begins to look a little cheesy or silly but only because I am watching episodes back to back. One would probably not notice it if you were viewing the show on a weekly basis.<br /><br />Anyway, don't miss out on the new remaster of season one. I have read it is the only season thus far available in high definition, which is really just another name for blu-ray quality.
B009HSPODE|5.0|Its the first time i read Munro. At first i was a bit dissapointed because i thought it was a book with one story, not a book of novels. The first novel was so good that i wanted to read more about the characters in the novel. Now I love the novels because she manages to pinpoint every short story in a way I think most of us can recognize bits and pieces and get the feeling of &#34;been there!&#34;. The stories are also very different, and they all have &#34;a nerve&#34;. Thanks to the Nobel prize - made me discover the author!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love the game, but my daughter's tablet just had an update on the playstore. She's in the mall. Please update it soon.
B00F8H0LM2|2.0|It looked boating at first but when you play the new characters, it seems like you w in in two minutes!
B007ADIRDM|5.0|This play set is amazing, all the little detail of the sofa and table even the doll are very unique. I love the part that is the right size to sit the dolls and play with them.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Awesome game I love it. Good thing it'll take a while before the game ends. I love this game so much that I think I'm addicted to it. LOVE IT !!!!!!!!!!!!
B008B68IV8|5.0|Simple but beautiful, all the details of the dolls are unique. the picture doesn't show the beauty of this doll.
B00F031XPS|4.0|Bonus features are what I bought it for, thought there would be more features but I'm still happy with it. I also liked the documentary when I watched it on PBS.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|fast easy read - she was very honest - would have liked it to be longer and get into each close personality she meet .
B001AQMBJQ|5.0|As the penultimate season of the show the series finally started to give us some answers in the 5th season and revealing the back story of the island and its inhabitants.  This season more than any of the others can get confusing because of the time shifting.  After the six characters left the island at the end of season 4 we find that either the island or the people on it began shifting through time.  So in one episode you could be in the present, in 1954, 1977 or the late 1980s.  And you really have to pay attention to keep track of what is going on.<br /><br />Once the shifting stops most of the action occurs in 1977 and we see things like the creation of the hatch, learn more about the Dharma initiative as well as &#34;The Others.&#34;  We also lean about Ben and Widmore's conflict and see the beginning of it.  The season finale leaves us with a cliffhanger surrounding &#34;the incident&#34; which necessitated the pushing of the button every 108 min in season 3.  There are still a lot of questions, but this season definitely starts to fill in some of those gaps.<br /><br />As far as the discs go for those who get the blu rays.  There are a total of 5.  Most of the special features (aside from commentary tracks) are on disc 5, although there is a making of the 100th episode feature on disc 4.  As usual the A/V quality is great and you can play the episodes in season play mode so you can stop and pick back up where you left off.  The special features are not as abundant as in the past seasons, but still enough to make those who like to go through the extra material happy.
B00C5R7B0I|5.0|Dust has carefully put into words how Kay Scarpetta reacted to the most horrific tragedy to date in this Country involving mass killings. Dust has memorialized the trauma of Sandy Hook, that day should never be forgotten, or relived.  When disaster strikes there is a tremendous amount of service and support carried out by our communities.  Police, firemen, detectives, and medical examiners…. all of them suffer right along with all of us, and in some cases suffer more.  They step into the situation with all their heart and energy to try to make right a terrible wrong and support the victims. We sometimes forget their roll and Dust has made a clear image of what it is like to restore oneself after so much hurt.  The story takes off after Kay's return from Connecticut where she has to begin the task of solving another horrible crime involving a serial killer.  Patricia Cornwell puts you at the scene…and in Kay's head on every single page of this novel.  Kay is human, has real relationships and is devoted to finding the ugly truth. The technology is fascinating…and I for one am happy to know that this technology is real.  The best part of Cornwell's novels is knowing that if she has written it …. it has been researched and the facts are true.  This book is no exception.  Could not put it down…another wonderful addition to her series.  When will we see a movie?!!!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great Science fiction, really just great fiction.  This was an excellent story well told, the characters had depth and breadth that pulled me along even when the action waned.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think that this game is cool and useful. Also it's creative in different ways<br />Northwest I think this is the best block game ever!!!!!
8866135909|4.0|For me, at least.<br /><br />I need a paper planner for a number of reasons, but the most important to me is that I'm a tactile kind of person and like to hold the book not look at a screen, and that the act of writing helps me remember appointments and tasks where typing does not.<br /><br />The seven days of the week on one side and a lined page on the other is the best format for me. I have relatively few appointments, but many tasks per week that go on the lined page.<br /><br />I've had Moleskine products with the soft cover, and they are OK for light use, but I carry and use a planner almost constantly. This lost the planner a half a star. Regardless, the hard cover stands up to this use better.<br /><br />Other planners have the address book that slips into the pocket in back. I miss that, and that is what lost this product the rest of that star.<br /><br />The pocket size (3.5 in by 5.5 in)just doesn't have enough space, and if I cram it, the writing is too hard on the eyes. This one, the large book is about 8 in by 5 in, and much more comfortable to write in and read, while not being excessively bulky.<br /><br />The spare blank pages, the year overview calendar, and the pocket inside the back cover are above and beyond what I expect in a planner, but I have grown accustomed to them and use them regularly.<br /><br />Excellent tool, and I recommend it to anyone who prefers (or might prefer) a physical rather than virtual planner.<br /><br />E.

B00CUKTGW6|5.0|Totally give this 5 stars for the music.  The packaging is really good, but it could have been kicked up another notch.  OTOH, I only paid $36 for this box set, which is a great deal.  Cheaper than what I paid for the original LPs, back in the day.<br /><br />I can't say anything about the music that hasn't already been said - The Clash made an amazing musical progression in just a few years, one of the best bands ever!  And it's all here, in one neat inexpensive package.<br /><br />Sonically, I don't have the ears to critique the remastering, so I won't.  Except to say that it seems like they didn't try to reduce the tape hiss, which seems odd.  Actually, the quality (volume, timbre) of the hiss pretty consistent throughout the set, which seems odd.<br /><br />The packaging is fun.  The outer box is decently sturdy, the individual albums have cardstock outer sleeves with paper inner sleeves holding the CDs.  The original LPs were not super-fancy, so these replicas aren't either.  But all the UK artwork and labels is reproduced, including a couple of inserts in Sandinista! and Combat Rock.  They used the same style CDs as in The Singles Box Set - black discs with 'LP grooves' printed on.  The only thing missing is the message &#34;In Space no one can hear you ... Clash!&#34; in the runout on the Sandinista! discs.  The 'record sleeves' are cut a little wide, so the inner sleeves and CDs fall out very easily.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun to play and there are lots of different areas to play in and lots of stuff to do for free.  I like the Mega minion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is really nice and so realistic and so fun once you get on it you can't get off it!
B008JFUPK8|3.0|There are some things to be liked in this new cinematic version of Superman. Despite its darker take on the comic legend, there are some nice heartfelt moments from his formative years in Smallville and some well-observed mythic overtones as Clark Kent realizes his true destiny. Amy Adams makes a great, savvy Lois Lane, and Henry Cavill certainly has the look of a Man of Steel.<br /><br />But as a movie and entertainment vehicle, this fell way short of the 1978 Christopher Reeve picture. That movie really delivered the goods, with its sweeping Lois Lane romance around the skies of Metropolis, laughably maniacal Lex Luther and bumbling Otis and Superman in top form, amazing city crowds and saving everyone in sight.<br /><br />What we have in the climax of the &#34;Man of Steel&#34; is a mind-numbing, prolonged slug fest between Superman and General Zod that reduces Metropolis to rubble. And this is not an Earth-created conflict, but one that Superman's father created by sending his son to our doorstep. I thought Superman was supposed to help humanity -- not create more problems!<br /><br />When you leave a Superman movie wishing that Jor-El had picked a different planet for his son's nursery, you know something has gone wrong.
B00CICW66O|5.0|Cause its an awesome cd, and have been waiting to get this cd for awhile. So over all very good
B008K8VDPU|5.0|this app is awesome cause it teaches me how to play different songs. now I can teach Other people how to play those songs.
B00BC254I8|4.0|This was a pretty awesome book almost a non stop read. The highs the lows. I would recommend this book to any boxing fan.
B000FS9FC6|5.0|The classic anti-government film.  Shows the potential abuses inherent in statism.  And you have to love the Guy Fawkes masks.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I detest spoilers, so I'll try not to slip up!  I know that many fans of the series are going to be angry after finishing this; however, I completely understand why the series ended this way.  After all, throughout the entire series, Tris thought she was never selfless enough to be Abnegation.....what better way to give proof of just how selfless she really had become!  I am much older than the intended reader of this series, but (after picking up Divergent at a friend's home and not being able to put it down until I'd finished) I am quite impressed with this series!  Don't let the \\"young person's\\" label fool you...this series is plenty entertaining for adults, young or otherwise.
B00EZPCZ5O|2.0|I think AFI died between Decemberunderground/I Heard a Voice and Crash Love. This is their second consecutive sub-par album.<br />What else do you want me to say? I'm not a music expert, but if I don't like something, I don't listen to it.
B00B89LZ4C|4.0|The action figure is very well made and really looks like Walt as Heisenberg.  My one complaint was that the package was bent to make it fit into the shipping bag, and as a collector, that dropped the overall value of the product.  An action figure this well made should be treated with more care!
B005723JSQ|5.0|That was awesome. A good, lighthearted read after all the heavy stuff I've been lifting. A bit trite maybe, but sometimes trite can be so satisfying.
B00E00GCF8|5.0|Awe man, what a great job on the bands part and also to the crew who where involved in this recording.  Dave Mustaine is great live.<br />And I love the new guitarist.  He is amazing.  This is a must have in the live dvd and cd collection for my Megadeth.<br />10 thumbs up from me!!!!
1250038820|1.0|Sad to say whatever is good about Brandon Stanton's work has been pretty much subverted by the designer of this book. Pages are crowded with images of all different sizes and texts are almost unreadable; it's as if the designer threw the pictures up in the air and let them land wherever. This makes it difficult to see the images individually; they become  a pseudo-video instead of a collection of still images.<br /><br />Stanton's re-invention of a venerable genre, the street portrait, is notable for its wit and sense of optimism and an important part of that is Stanton's text, his observations about the people of New York. Without their texts many of these portraits have about the same depth as ads for 'I love New York'. But in the book many texts are almost unreadable because the Neue Helvetica? font that is so fashionable these days often disappears into the image.<br /><br />A classic example of how bad design can sabotage an artist's work. One can only wonder why Brandon Stanton went along with it.
B00EJGMCG6|5.0|Great live recording!!!!! This is a must have if your a Testament fan.  I love this band live. Both live cd and dvd are definitely worth buying.
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|I was deeply disappointed to discover that this author does not know the difference between \\"set\\" and \\"Sat\\".  He used Sat incorrectly every time.  To the subject of the book, entirely predictable.  Disappointing!
B0000524CY|5.0|I am over fifty seven years old.  I first saw this movie in 1973.  It scared me then and it still does today.  It has a great story and a real ending.
B005FRF6PC|4.0|This is a book aimed at tennis players who follow the stars of the game. Rafa is a fascinating person and this book portrays some of the stuggles he has gone through, particularly wit health issues,  to achieve the highest level in his sport. A good read.
B006BAEQB2|5.0|Same story but a totally different take from the eyes of Anne Neville. I really enjoyed this book and the authors take on what really happened is very interesting.
B00BEK6Z7M|4.0|Just finished and very impressed. This is a great branching out for this author duo. I loved the new scenery for our characters and a re-up of the Swanson/Pendergast team. Ending was exhilarating and well woven. Kudos.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This is the story of enduring parental love....even when it is deadly. It supports the belief that The  Justice System is a complete failure,a charade with the prize going to the best performer.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|This book is a literary classic. It is still as refreshing as it was when I first read it. I would highly recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It's a pain in the Ass. Keeps losing connection and not worth the $35.00. Wish I had not ordered it.
B00ARHAAZ6|4.0|Once again I'm in awe of this author's imagination and storytelling. Lots of twists and turns, and a very unexpected ending, but that's the Sanderson way! Not really a cliff-hanger, more of a...where the heck is this story going next?! Of course I'll be back to see what the Reckoners are up to in their quest to free the world of Epics!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This game is so fun! I really like playing it and it is such a great way to pass the time! I really recommend this game to people of all ages and I think you all will really enjoy it!
B00F031X62|5.0|I've been a Hendrix fan since I was 12 years old...I'm 59, and i am still in awe of his amazing showmanship...musicianship and song writing ability.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|So much fun! Intensity and realism to the superman genre. The first action hero movie i felt connected too. I really liked Avengers... but this topped it. The opening scenes to this movie were epic. Sooo off the the charts. The whole Krypton origin left me speechless. The characters felt  real and more 21st century. General Zod played by Michael Shannon was unforgettable. He is such a great actor and he owned the whole villain role. The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer was monumental.<br /><br />THe Collector's edition was well worth purchasing. I recommend it, especially if you like novelties. The Case is well designed for an adornment with your library.
B00F031WB8|5.0|Self taught..limited technology of the times,the 60's,and still he was able to elevate his instrument to a new level unparalelled even today! Always searching for new sounds and ways to present them,Unashamed...undaunted...his music will live on forever.
B008ALA6DW|4.0|I want to migrate data from an old laptop to a new MBP.  A &#34;hard&#34; ethernet connection is faster than going through my old wireless base station.  The cases on the new MBPs are too thing for a standard ethernet connection... at least that's how it appears to me.  That's sort of a hassle, but it also makes sense.  People want more compact laptops, right?<br /><br />So anyway, the adaptor worked fine.  I'm happy with it.
B00D2I8E46|4.0|Excellent blending of various genre, by the best 'Live' band in the land, and one of the most prolific songwriters today.The sounds are fresh,exciting,and very thought provoking.Not a weak track in the bunch...i enjoyed every second of it!
0399157573|5.0|This is Patricia Cornwell finest hour in the Scarpetta series. All the usual intricate plots that we have come to expect from this brilliant author are present, and the technology is as high powered as ever. The PIT room is the latest arrival. Miss Cornwell allows us, in present time to visually review its fascinating and sometimes gruesome information. Allowing the reader the ability to walk through the crime scene as if they were actually present. , But it is the changes we see in Scarpetta herself that are the most compelling. The opening of the book finds her at her lowest ebb after witnessing a mass school killing spree. She is effected deeply, both mentally and physically. Coming down with the flu as a symptom. We see her at her most vulnerable and also at her most defensive of those she loves. Benton is being targeted by his own department and Scarpetta will not stop at nothing to find out who is responsible. Her relationship with Marino is particularly complicated in DUST. We are given a glimpse into their past together which is both surprising and enlightening. The reason why DUST works so well, is that we have a much more in-depth view of Scarpetta's personal life. We are inside her head and close-up as all the events unfold. For me this is, by far the best in the Scarpetta series to date.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|The story just gets better and better.  Serious drama against a colorful historical backdrop.  Excellent acting.  Outstanding production values.  Great locales.
0131988425|3.0|The American hardcover is outrageously expensive.  Just buy the softcover international edition on abebooks.com or wherever you can find it.  I paid ~$22.  The content is the same.  Some end of chapter problems are just shuffled around or they recycle 2nd edition problems.<br /><br />As for the actual content, I rated 3/5 stars.<br /><br />I don't think this book is as pedagogically sound as Oppenheim & Willsky.  Like O&W, this text suffers from over-wordiness.  Also, in later chapters, O&S write their text assuming you are very fluent with Z-transform, system functions.  If you are not, this text will be frustrating to read.<br /><br />The biggest gripe I have with this text is that important theorems and relations are buried in a wall of text.  O&S does not do as good a job as O&W does on boxing and highlighting the essential concept of the section.  For example, you would have to scrutinize the text very carefully to figure out that linear-phase FIR filters always have zeros that come in reciprocal pairs - it's only addressed in a small paragraph out of ~8 pages or so on linear-phase filters!<br /><br />On the flip-side, there's a lot of valuable information in here.  The only other DSP text I have read to compare this to is this:<br />[...]<br /><br />This is a more practical and less mathematical text that may be a good complement to O&S.
0307352153|5.0|Her book explains a lot, and and helps me have a much better understanding of myself and others. I would recommend reading this book.
