B009UX2YAC|3.0|I loved this game butbit started deleting all my progress when it would go dead or I turned it off and I'm mad.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game.  It did not feel impossible; but is was enough of a challenge to keep me hooked.  Was not boring!
B005S9EKCW|3.0|It's impossible to imagine that anyone would want to see or rate this movie based on their expectations of a great vocal performance from popular Hollywood actors. That being said, it wasn't a bad movie, and a lot of the singing from the principal stars was quite decent. It seemed pretty obvious that the cast was filled out with people with a musical theatre background as the unknowns were a notch above with their ability. Enjolras was extremely enjoyable as the leader of the revolutionaries. Hugh Jackman was nearly consistently good with his singing. Amanda Seyfried was ok, though I got the feeling sometimes she was channeling one of the Chipettes, Brittany perhaps? I saw Mamma Mia after this and was surprised that her singing there was so much better. The commentary, aside from the obligatory cast on cast sycophantic fluff mentioned Russel Crowe's background in musical theatre, which means that he doesn't deserve as delicate a review. Young Gavroche was a scene stealer, hopefully he has a prosperous career in the years ahead. The remaining members were passable, and since Les Mis has some of my favorite songs, as well as some that have wiggled their way into the public's collective consciousness it's sad to not walk away from seeing this with a new favorite version ringing in my ears. I'm sure this movie has converted a lot of new fans though for musicals, Les Mis, and possibly even the plethora of Victor Hugo's writings. That couldn't be a bad thing. Struggling against suffering and tyranny with a dispassionate ruling class makes for an unsettling movie or musical experience anyway. And lesson learned, 15 students versus an army, dissenting opinions not welcome.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|I love this book.  It's the true story of a man who experienced Heaven and returned to Earth.  It is so well written and wonderful to read.
B001GKJ2DY|3.0|Review for 70's disco band ABBA and the piecemeal grouping of their songs into a show - mouthwash to get the sugary taste out of my mouth and reading a book to make up for the lost I.Q. points - not good. And you can't blame the era, because I would argue Tommy by The Who was near the same time period but didn't feel like the equivalent of babysitting a bunch of 11 year old girls. And sure musicals about promiscuity are some of the best and most respected musicals out there, thank you Camelot and Into the Woods, but I guess this did a good job of summarizing the carefree attitude of the '70s decade, which I'm not sad that I missed.<br />As for the movie I think it was a very good effort on the part of the cast for acting and singing. Meryl Streep had so much energy, at least some of it made it look as though she were genuinely having fun. She and Amanda Seyfried did an excellent job singing for non-singers. Most of the principal males had a little trouble with their songs, but they were pretty well perfectly cast for their parts anyway, no reason to complain. I get this was about dancing and singing, but there were times when there were close ups of singing and there was too much action. Twitching even? It's hard to be expressive with your face when you should be expressive with your voice, and some of the extraneous movement was disconcerting. A director should have told them to stop wiggling so much during those certain scenes. Even having the actors in question watch a musical or stage performance of a professional singer to learn how to hold their bodies and their faces and appendages while performing might have alleviated some of that.<br />The chorus was spot on most of the time for comic relief. There was a lot of pleasant and fun humor in the dances. However much of the story involving the older set of ladies was very blue collar humor, and it really made them all the more pathetic. Set and costume design was strikingly good, even if you haven't been to Greece you can get the feeling you've visited from the vibrant seaside decor and colors used here.<br />Don't think it's spoiling too much to say the daughter makes the \\"right\\" choice at the end to not go through with getting married, just like her mother did years before her. Good to know we haven't matured past the values of the '70s, or at least they want to relive their glory days.

B009XIXVU6|3.0|Some writers only have at best one good book in them.  Maybe two.  But not three in this case.  I did finish it but far from a page turner.  I Still thin his second book was his best.
B00005RDRO|4.0|Old fashioned murder mystery comedy. If only they were all so amusing! I have to admit to not being familiar with most of the originals the cast is spoofing in this farce aside from mainly Miss Marple and Hercule Poirot, but I could appreciate it none the less. It's interesting to read a little about the Detective Charlie Chan history, the character was created to combat negative stereotypes yet the original Asian actors garnered little popular success for the character and were later played by a Swede and an American to more acclaim and appeal. When a comedian does something irreverent, such as using a broken Chinese-American accent I guess it's best to take it as pointing out flaws in our perceptions of culture instead of taking offense. Peter Sellers got to have the most fun with his character and provided the better part of the humor. Truman Capote's presence on screen didn't excite me as much as some of the other reviewers, before this I knew him as an author, and after this I will still think of him as an author. Much of the humor was lighthearted and there were a lot of puns. The ending was ridiculous, as it should have been. It only illustrates the frustration a lot of mystery readers feel about late introduced characters or misdirection in stories that seem to make no sense at the conclusion and the revelation of the guilty party. If you can't keep them guessing, at least keep them laughing.
B004S5FW1U|4.0|Really enjoyed it. Grown ups version of Catcher in the Rye.<br />Funny and quirky.<br />Movie was good too though as always book was better
B00CWY76CC|5.0|For a free game this is an easy 5-star rating. Challenging yet not so hard that it is frustrating. Definitely would recommend it and look forward to updates.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|I instantly put it in my CD player there are a lot of great songs and big hits on it. Love It!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|It seems as if I've been living with this series as a part of my life forever. As each new book came out, I would go back and 're-read the entire series from the beginning. When I heard of Mr. Jordan's passing, I was extremely sad for his family and selfishly, really upset that I'd never get to read the ending to this amazing story he had created. But when I read that Mr. Sanderson had been choosing to finish Mr. Jordan's work, I relaxed and waited for the final books with much anticipation. I had read Mr. Sanderson's work and knew he could pull off not only decent story telling and character development but solid world building.<br />Well, the final book in the series doesn't disappoint. The final threads are woven, there are no questions left unanswered, every important character gets their time in the limelight and their story told. Even Bella.<br />I'm sure I'll be reading these books over and over again over the course of my life, as they are comfort food for my mind. But now I'll be doing it knowing how their story ends and that, I expect, will make the stories new for me again.

B0087ZG7PW|2.0|Purchased this DVD because it included a digital copy.  Ordered on 6/30/13 and it arrived today.  However, there was no digitial copy insert in case and no option to save movie from disc.  I contacted Amazon customer service and was told they couldn't do anything about the digital copy and I would have to contact the studio who owns the rights to movie.  I understand Amazon's limitation for providing the missing insert but I was expecting an offer to send me another DVD to replace the one I received.  Amazon did send me a return label to return the one I received for credit but I won't be doing that since we really wanted this one.  The movie is clearly listed as DVD+Digital copy and when I purchase similar DVDs from other vendors, the shrink wrap has a sticker on it indicating it contains a digitial version.  No such indicaton was on wrapping of the movie I received.  I'm curious whether the discs Amazon is selling are truely the digital copy versions or if someone just selected the wrong one during packaging.  I noticed that another customer posted a review in June 2013 with the same issue for this movie so maybe this is something Amazon should check into.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Having read Hosseini's previous two books I expected an engrossing, fast read. However this book is much more complicated and disjointed and I found it difficult to understand who all the characters are and how they relate. Having said that, I was moved by the basic story and my heart ached for the brother and sister, and for the people of,Afganistan.
B00CO8D3G4|5.0|People need to understand that the world is changing and the only way to truly benefit from this change is to &#34;choose yourself&#34; because no one will do it for you.

B008BU75IQ|3.0|It was great to finish the series, but this book is not nearly as good as the 1st two books.  The first 2 were quick page turners for this one I was not in a rush to finish, and didn't care as much.  The story line with Virginia, Giles ex-wife looked forced and not in sync with the other storylines that took place.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|This is one of those cd's that puts you in a great mood. I can't stop listening to it and I think its been on repeat since the day I bought it!!!
B005K01VZS|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I can't recall lately picking up a book that I've enjoyed more.  This story is uplifting and poignant and should leave you with at least a modicum of appreciation for roads traveled by others in this life.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This review may contain some spoilers. I will try and keep them out but some may slip through.<br /><br />The movie was amazing. Daniel Day-Lewis was perfect and the rest of the case did an amazing job. I really felt the pressure watching the movie that was on Lincoln during those times. They did a great job of making the characters seem alive and got into the gritty details of what politics was like during the Civil War.<br /><br />If you are looking for a movie that shows you the ins and outs of the battles during the war, this movie is not right for you. The movie stays true to its title and focuses on the hard choices and the battles in Washington that Lincoln had to face. I thoroughly enjoyed it being a big history buff as it tied in many different elements from that period and brought the scene to life. Some parts were difficult to follow for my girlfriend who watched it with me who is not as knowledgeable about the history of the Civil War. But she still enjoyed it and found it interesting.<br /><br />Overall I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Just make sure you pay attention while the movie is running or you may miss something and not understand what has happened.
B008ZOHCKE|2.0|For notes this is a good app. Personally I wanted to use it for multiple notebooks. This app will add as many as you like, but it adds them based upon their order of covers.

1609611543|5.0|What are we to do about it?  The first step to solving any problem is to do research and try to understand every aspect of the situation.  Reading this book and sharing it with others, especially health care professionals, is a good first step. In this culture, moving away from wheat completely is a very daunting task.  I hope it won't be such a struggle for our children and grandchildren.  Messing with such a basic food resource has cost many lives, but who is going to hold anyone accountable?  How many of our friends and family members have suffered because of what has been done to our food - without anyone's permission?  Where is the FDA, and what is it for?  I'm angry, and you will be too after the first few pages.  Many thanks to Dr. Davis for having the intelligence, courage and compassion to bring the wheat issue to light.  Now where is the outrage from the caring professionals who are supposed to be advocating for our health?  As consumers we certainly deserve better.

B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This should be required reading for everyone venturing out into life. It is a must for those souls who wish to find joy and true peace in this difficult world. I appears to be a condensed version of Carlos Castaneda's series of books on the ways of the Shamans of the Southwest. I am 64 years old and have read hundreds of books in my life. That series of books were the most important. They changed my approach to life for the better, at 32 years old. This book summarizes that knowledge into an easily read and concise guide to living.

I didn't read the books, so unlike most of the negative reviews I didn't have any preconceived notions of how tall Reacher should be.  Great story, great action.  Pretty good car chase too.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|OK it's true-I wasn't expecting much with this case. The screen protector I chucked because it didn't have the appropriate cut outs for the 4s. But the case itself is quite excellent. It isn't yellowing at all. And it is sturdy without being bulky. Phone still fits in my back pocket of my skinny jeans. Yep - it protects the phone really well given I dropped it outside on the driveway. Heck even the case didn't scratch. By far, this is one of the best cases I've owned for my phone. Hands down it beats my $$$ case.

It is also different seeing Nazi Germany from the German villagers' side.<br />Brilliantly written and totally absorbing.

Make a choice, either read it or watch it but don't do both. You'll be disapointed.

B000M9BPEY|5.0|Over the course of his career, Tim Burton has established himself as one of Hollywood's leading directors. His fantastic, often dark and macabre visions are combined with his knack for telling compelling stories that audiences relate to. In his adaptation of Dan Wallace's novel, Big Fish, he puts forth an unusually lighter film that is arguably his most personal.<br /><br />The film begins with the elder Edward Bloom (Albert Finney) speaking about the day of his son Will's (Billy Crudup) birth. While his wife was busy giving birth, Edward was out catching the largest, uncatchable fish that you can imagine. Will, now grown up, struggles with his father's penchant for telling \\"Tall Tales\\" and claims that he has no idea who his father really is. Edward continues to tell the fantastical story of his growing up, and the events that lead to him meeting is wife.<br /><br />During this time, Burton employs small flashbacks, vignettes that show each of Bloom's stories, with Ewan McGregor portraying the younger Edward. Burton's visual aesthetic gives these stories a Southern Gothic flair that makes them each seem just a bit beyond reality.<br /><br />Will continue's to struggle with his father's tales, claiming that it is impossible to know who his father really is. This causes a three year rift in their relationship that doesn't end until Will receives the news that his father has had a life-threatening stroke. When Will comes to the ailing Edward's hospital bed, he realizes that his father's life has been defined by the stories he tells. With the realization, he begins to tie up the ends of his father's tales, repairing their broken relationship.<br /><br />This is probably Tim Burton's deepest emotional movie. Each character is given a strong arch, allowing Burton's visual pyrotechnics to be matched by emotional revelations that are equally spectacular. The tall tales lend themselves to the fairy tale style that the film takes on. Overall, this is an exceptional adaptation of Wallace's novel, and a delightful film.of Wallace's novel, and a delightful film.

I am a woman veteran during the Vietnam era but did not go overseas.  Watching the incredible footage helps me understand why my Dad did not talk much about his experiences and helps me appreciate what the experience of war must have been like for those alive that during that time - in Asia, Europe and the US.  The narrative is very well written.

I really like this series from the aurhor and i look forward to her releasing the next one. I highly recommend this to someone who likes a thrilling drama mixed with steamy romance.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|It definitely was a great book, sure it lacks of some description of the scenarios (it's where the other books also failed). Nevertheless, the book flows smoothly and tells you the story about a troubled girl who is expected to take big decisions while her mind is drifting away. It's not about love and it's not about politics, in my opinion it's about an inner travel about morality.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love it. It gives all these little hints and stats. It's so nifty. I am very pleased with this app.

And then when she adds her beautiful voice...well, she had me from the first note of the first song I heard by her. The album is great. My favorite tracks are &#34;Arms&#34;, &#34;Penguin&#34;, and &#34;Miles&#34;.<br /><br />Christina's beautiful voice/songs/videos blew me away the first time I heard them. The lyrics are so emotionally laden that you have to love them and her for giving voice to what are generally very personal thoughts. And, in case you've yet to see them, her videos are the equal of this album, and she's such a beautiful woman that it's a joy to watch them. Who knows what her childhood was like. &#34;Sad Song&#34; might give a hint, but that's a guess. The angst that is such a part of her music may just be her baring her soul. It wouldn't be the first time a singer, or any artists, did so. And it surely won't be the last.<br /><br />I love Christina's songs. She's a super talent...and I look forward to a new release.
0307730700|5.0|Have you ever read a book or watched a movie based on a true story, and found yourself hoping and praying that the ending would turn out differently? Even though you know what's going to happen, you wish for a different outcome?<br /><br />That is what you will feel when you read `Fearless' by Eric Blehm. This is the true story of a man's journey from an idyllic childhood to the world of drugs and finally to the Elite SEAL Team SIX of the United States Navy.<br /><br />I have to admit: I usually would not pick up a book about a Navy SEAL. But I could not put this book down. Adam Brown's grit and determination were at the level that these traits were almost miraculous.<br /><br />Most men cannot come close to becoming a Navy SEAL because of the rigorous physical requirements. Not only did Adam Brown succeed, he did so with two physical impairments that should have made this achievement impossible, and with a `less than satisfactory' past.<br />But God had a plan for Adam Brown, and he knew it. Giving up was not an option. And he sacrificed his life to help ensure our safety.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very attractive  game! First level it is pretty hard to understand what to do, but then it is poor fun. Hope more levels will come soon.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Of freaking course there will be another novel, there damn well better be after all the crap this couple goes through. This book was a good read, I didn't read it nearly as fast as the first two crossfire novels but its still great. It would be really hard to follow the story line if you hadn't already read the first two novels. Eva and Gideon have some things to work out, and there wasn't nearly as much climax in this book, so what Cary got that biotch pregnant, Eva's dad found out about the rape, and Eva and Gideon got married in private.....that still doesn't leave much for a happy ending, which lets face it we all really want.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|So entertaining and fun, with a little bit of a message and a lot of insight into a troubled mind (s).
B0070UFMOW|5.0|I use this with my laptop and some high end headphones (Ultrasone Pro 900's) and it sounds great! Even works on the airlines and makes those long flights much more comfortable.
B00B49L7JY|4.0|An interesting documentary about an amazing man few know about. Intriguing enough to make me order one of his CD's, and it's pretty good!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|great game it makes you think. This game helps solve pieces to puzzles inside of rooms.Very good app keep me posted on the new rooms.
B00CSWA1PM|5.0|Cyndi Lauper's style is all over this musical soundtrack. Charlie's Soliloquy reprise is very indicative of &#34;True Colors.&#34; Other numbers contain her signature sound as well. Which is a good thing! The upbeat numbers are toe tapping winners that make you want to get up and dance. Though my favorite number has to be the quirky and hilarious &#34;The History of Wrong Guys&#34; sung by Annaleigh Ashford. It has fun musical variety and is sung with oodles of character.
B005LAIIN0|3.0|Brad Pitt is fine as a United Nations employee traveling across the world in a race against time to stop the Zombie pandemic that is toppling armies and governments, and threatening to destroy humanity. The film is definitely entertaining, although there are moments when it certainly drags a bit. It's a CGI extravaganza with no blood and very quick glimpses of the zombies as other reviewers also noted. I assume this was done to keep it's PG 13 rating and maybe keep the big budget for the CGI effects which is very overused IMHO. After a while, it gets a bit frustrating being a fan of the genre and I felt that 28 Days Later was much better. The silly premise of injecting oneself with a deadly disease in order to be \\"invisible\\" to the zombies was quite preposterous, but then again, it's Hollywood.<br /><br />Brad Pitt gave an interview where he said that \\"they pulled out all the stops\\" for this film and perhaps I had higher expectations based on his remarks.
B00AEBB9V4|5.0|Having read the story this is based upon, then hearing that Tim Burton was planning on creating a movie based on it, I knew that the two wouldn't have that much in common.  I went into the movie, then, not expecting it to be true to the original and ended up feeling it was true to Tim Burton's bizarre and wacky sense of movie-making.<br /><br />Sleepy Hollow stars Johnny Depp as the main character, Ichabod Crane.  Certainly, in the original book, Ichabod was some thin dweeb of a man who never seemed to amount to much of anything.  Johnny's Ichabod is an intensely dedicated, if socially inept, man intent on bringing scientific means and real evidence into the police work of his day...a big no no that gets him sent up to the backward little town of Sleepy Hollow where, horror of horrors, seemingly supernatural murders are happening.  Ichabod, however, scorns all such twaddle...<br /><br />He then meets the love interest of the movie, Katrina, and runs into the bad guy (seemingly) of the piece...the Headless Horseman himself, played to brilliance by Christopher Walken.  So much for not believing in the supernatural.  Yet, there is a mystery about not just the Horseman, but about Katrina and Ichabod himself that adds a nice subtext to the main plot, hints of witchcraft and magic and more.<br /><br />The special effects are wonderful in this movie, the costumes are nicely done, and the spooky atmosphere that is built from the opening credits on lends itself to the movie to great effect.  The haunted woods that the Horseman hunts through are beautifully creepy.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite Burton/Depp movies.  There are some blood-splattering scenes that could easily have been left out--they seemed almost comic at times, they verged on being over the top--and it would have been nice to explore Ichabod's background more in light of the supernatural themes in the movie, but those are mild criticisms.

0930289234|5.0|Honestly, this was the highlight of my purchase. I love this comic snd I lovr thr movie. The comedian is my favorite hero even though hes like crazy.  The book was perfect snd no be ds or scratches. Will buy again
B001JRB16U|5.0|It was just like we remembered it. We were looking for musicals and loved Dick Van Dike and Julie Andrews, the energy and the songs.
140120841X|5.0|Aerived on time and in perfect condition. Saved me money so im happy I got it on amazon instead of the bokstore. Started to read and im enjoying it so fsr.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was hooked on the book could not put it down I was not, however, very thrilled with the ending, I guess I was looking for a happy ending because I know a person that is like the main character and I think these people should pay for their evil ways!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I saw this movie years ago and have been dying to see it again. The best movie for dog lovers to see. The devotion between a man and his dog.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|ive always tried to find a free Toca boca type game. Finally ive found a pretty licit one. - kaelah
B003VWU2WA|5.0|Works great. Easy to setup and customize. Perfect if you have software that you would rather use a scroller for. Easily adjustable scrolling speed.
B001USHRCK|5.0|Awesome set with so many little pieces to really make it a bustling town scene! Provided days of quiet time in the household! We bought it this past Christmas and she frequently will pull it out and play with it still. Hoping to expand the collection next Christmas!
B0083GQ2A0|2.0|I compare this movie to zombies. Unrealistic bad guy actions for no reason other than someone thought it was cool. I have read a lot about wolves over the years as I'm a fan of a game system that uses real information about wolves. I've never heard of healthy wolves attacking a person unless they had to nevertheless tracking them over a long distance. This movie is ridiculous.
1781162646|3.0|I was expecting more thrills.... It was a quick read.  I liked getting to know Devin.  I am still a big Stephen King fan.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|We rented this movie and wanted it for our library. Whether a man has children or not, this is a MUST SEE film. It has all of the elements: heartwarming, heartbreaking, humorous, and a story that strengthens family values. You will not walk away without being impacted personally - whether you are male or female.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|I have never before read this book, but I was really entertained. I was impressed that for a free book, it was not less than stellar.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|While not the iconic Superman theme provided by John Williams over 3 decades earlier, Hans Zimmer has succeeded in creating a score that embodies this take on the Man of Steel including some heartfelt moments as the film explores the superhero's emotions.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too challenging but also not ridiculously easy so it was a fun puzzle. I liked how it got progressively more difficult bit not so much that I couldn't figure out the puzzles. I hope for more levels soon!!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|No complaints about the shows I've purchased. The quality is great, the video player is great, and the process of purchasing was great.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this book. I truly think the series will become the next &#34;1984&#34; of social/human studies. I'd recommend it to anyone.
B00D57HTBI|5.0|I bought this book for one reason -- it was highly recommended by Seth Godin, and I value his opinion.  After reading it, I can understand why he found it worthwhile, because it deals with how to inspire a tribe (and yourself) to higher purpose.<br /><br />I was part-way through the book when I realized I'd seen Ben Zander's wonderful TED Talk (playing piano balanced on one cheek...), and it all came into focus for me. This book is a gem, with stories from Ben Zander's experience as a teacher and conductor of the Boston Philharmonic Orchestra; and his wife, Roz's private practice in group therapy, accomplishment support, and as a painter and writer.  It's an ingeniously edited book, expressing both voices harmoniously, and including stories that showcase the powerful, far-reaching impact of small changes in our way of thinking about ourselves and others.<br /><br />This book outlines an extremely useful discipline that, if put into practice, will tweak your worldview and give you the tools to influence group dynamics.  While most books in this genre teach you only how to change yourself, this one is both outwardly and inwardly focused.  Read it, put it into practice, and you can join the tribe of people who are living a life of passion, purpose, and inspiration.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The app is lots of fun and reminded me of Myst, a game from the 90s.  Requires creativity and patience.  Lots of fun but too short.  Good game for kids.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|If you've ever played this game as a kid in school like I did, then you'll enjoy this just as well.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I have no idea what this Kid Messenger thing is, but my kids and their friends are always on it 'talking'. They seem to love it - I don't understand how it works, but that's just me :)  Your kids will love it I'm sure.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Super addicting TV series. I watched it all within a couple days. The perk of having it sent to my ipad when I bought the DVD was awesome too!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I'm 45 years old. Don't play a lot of 'games' on computer/phone. I'm addicted to this. There I said it. Yep, I love Solitaire :)
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I find I am more and more disappointed by movies that are released in the theaters these days.  It's one of the reasons we refuse to pay the $10 per person price for tickets any more.  We'll just wait for it to come on pay per view for $4 or $5 instead.<br /><br />I was expecting more of a movie about Lincoln--the man, husband, father, president.  Not a movie about political whining and back stabbing.  I have to listen to the political crap every day, I don't want to have to listen to it in a movie, too.<br /><br />We turned it off about half way through.  And I really like Daniel Day-Lewis.  Was looking forward to it. What a disappointment.
B00C33M2EE|4.0|Natrual beauty accompanied by artful music and unique staging.  These musicians and their staging and recording team deserve great success and an enlarged audience.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This was a moving and believable account of a glimpse of the afterlife during a NDE.  Dr. Alexander did a great job of describing his medical condition and the remarkable recovery he made.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|FIlled with talent, innovative scoring, quality execution and immortal beauty. Will look for more of the same quality and magic.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Appropriate for all.  Simple and open gameplay, though friends are needed to progress, and social menu frequently glitches. Doesn't require money, though it's tempting to get impatient and spend, especialy when they have sales.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Cool flick. A bit gory for the younger viewers, but worth the watch. Glad it's only fiction...can you imagine? :)
B00BJNHACS|5.0|I loved this game. It's lots of fun, and quite simple too, but with a nice challenge. One of the best .99 cent games I bought
148258798X|4.0|This is an account of the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima. The victims are all to human, flawed like all of us. They struggled to get through the horrors of that day, and this is there story. The books follows them after the end of the war and on to the end of there lives. Some lived great lives, others were disappointing. All in all, this is a profoundly human account an inhumane bombing. You may find the book interesting, if Japanese history is your cup of tea, although I am sure there are better books on the subject.
0307591549|4.0|I believe this is a decently written book.  It's easy to read and the author has good stories to share.  However,  most of the things he has written are not truly insightful and are generally things that people know that they should do but usually don't.  I think though if you apply his advice, you will generally have a better life :).
0679720200|5.0|The Stranger is my favorite novel under 200 pages. One of the few novels I have bothered to read more than once. This story is a view into a world without meaning, without purpose, without morals. It is a glimpse into the darkness in the human soul. This is a short book, but it's memorizing. Through the actions of one amoral man, you will get a tour through camus absurdism, and the cruel indifference of the world. Highly recommended.
B007FDE4Y8|1.0|Looks cool, metal, shiny weights, balances pretty fast but as long as you keep it still.  Once it's put into action, it gets sloppy and sloopy.  Wobbley to say the least.  Spent hours trying to get it too work like others say it can but to no avail.  Needed a valium to calm down it was so aggravating.  If you have any carple tunnel problems, be ready to feel some pain.  For the DIY's... you can build a better one than this.  But, some folks are happy and got it to work.  I just wasn't able to.
030758836X|5.0|Having recently finished reading Gone Girl, I think it is worth pointing out that those who are unhappy with the ending consistently cite their desire for punishment of the guilty party(ies). The ending was good, it just didn't fit with the Western style \\"good triumphs, evil is punished\\" ending that Judeo-Christian audiences demand and are given in countless books, television shows, and movies in the US. Like a good Law and Order episode, you have to accept the fact that sometimes there are no perfect solutions to a problem, and at times evil may indeed be victorious. If you can accept that, then you'll enjoy the book (and the ending).
B004UID2LC|1.0|Thought this was a way good app! everything worked great! loved it! then... the update... it screwed up my kindle and my anti virus app deleted this app. DONT GET IT!!!!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|This is a very good show and the action well done.<br />There  are always plot twists  that keeps you coming back for more.
B00CATSONE|5.0|The book worth read and the time ,  there are a lot  of  power inside our intranet need rather used or updated
055380684X|5.0|Great book. A must read! Crunching, deep learning and the biology of how talent get encoded in the brain.  A must read!
B0030ZOYHC|4.0|I thought the movie was very good and is a must have for anime fans tht enjoy mech animes or if they love evangellion but mine did not come with the 20 page booklet that is supposed to come with it that is my only complaint buy this you will enjoy it.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I loved this romance. It wasn't pretty, but they get there. It's definitely one of those reads where you feel good for the characters after their journey to accept each other.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|a great movie for those age appropiate especially for fathers and sons...every goal of every father is to teach your son how to be a man.
B0073COMUW|5.0|So far its been going good... really bright compare to any other LED bulb using same 10W energy... really recommend to everyone..
0140143505|3.0|On Thursday morning, I mailed off my UK visa application!!! In the spirit of my upcoming move, I opted to read 84 Charing Cross Road. I didn't know much about the book, other than that it was about a UK bookstore, but was excited to read it after seeing some very enthusiastic reviews. And as much as I enjoyed being momentarily submerged in British book life, I was overall a bit disappointed with the book.<br /><br />I will give credit to Hanff for compiling a set of letters (all actual letters sent between her an the bookstore) that led to a very cute tale. I think the thing that got me with this one is that I really didn't like Hanff's writing. She exuded an air of smugness combined with excess sarcasm and I just couldn't stand any of her letters (or really her for that matter). Having said that, I thought the notes included from the Londoners (BAHH CAN'T WAIT!) were just lovely. But how they put up with Ms. Hanff, I'll never know...
B009XIXVU6|4.0|All too often I questioned my concentration and ability to fully comprehend. In the end I believe that Hosseini incorporated too many characters into the mix . Sometimes less is more. LESS of some of the characters and MORE about Pari and Abdullah would have worked better for me.
B0099114WO|5.0|This movie besides being romantic and picturing the reality of marriages ones they have gone through routine all their life shows how love can overcome any obstacle. It is a matter of learning how to communicate all through marriage! I highly recommend it to all married couples and to those who plan to marry.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|..reported problems need to be taken care of...downloaded on Dec. 12, 2012 and a few of the problems are still there. NOW, GL has a new version, can't open to up-date with new version, nor sign-on to pay version 1.1.1., why ?<br />I enjoy the game very much, but now I wish they would fix the problems, more than ever.
006226303X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was very entertaining and not at all what I expected. I just finished the Talisman by king, and this was a nice move back into non-king fiction.
B00C1N9JWO|4.0|This book does answer some questions and brings it all together for the whole series.  I would recommend reading it.
B0097S0TM0|5.0|Such a fun album.  My 4 year old and I jam out to this in the car, in the kitchen, where ever.  The songs are very related to anyone who has been in love.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|This was almost unwatchable.  My question?  Did Jeremy Renner need the money?<br />I really don't have much else to say about this movie.  There were 2 times the F word was used and for no real reason.  It was rather a gratuitous use of the word.  J. Renner said it once and it was seemed so ridiculous.  The names Hansel and Gretel also seemed ridiculous as well in this movie.
B008KW43TE|3.0|This is the type of album that you clean your house to... for those of you who like to just chill out with the windows open, jamming music while you clean... This album is for you... even though non of his lyrics make any sense!
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Probably the best live album ever made. McCartney and co. are at their best, interacting with the crowd and playing, from top to bottom hit after hit.
B005USZYDU|4.0|This was a quick and easy read.  Keeps your attention throughout.  The only thing I didn't like was the abrupt ending.  I have to find out now what happens to Theo!
B0057R5G6E|5.0|This is a fun gift set, especially for $40.  The three movies are immensely entertaining, with dinosaur special effects that are still jaw-droppingly good after all these years.  The t-rex statue is nicely-executed: detailed and exciting.  If you like dinosaurs, or beasts-from-the-mists-of-time movies, you'll love this gift set.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is super fun.  It does work out your brain.  I had such a good time with the game I now have my husband hook on it also.
B003UYUR10|5.0|&#34;Prince of Persia&#34; is a lot of fun, if somewhat overlong.  The story is really quite clever and is perhaps the most sensible time-travel plotting I've ever seen -- perhaps the only logical one, in fact.  There's lots of action -- too much in my opinion, it gets a bit wearying -- but it's well done and there's a good amount of humor, and excellent performances from all the actors, making this a quite-enjoyable popcorn movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Loves this game<br />Tho s game is fun<br />This game is so good there must get a lot ofreviws hfgh
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|This is a great app because it's not really dependent on your artistic ability. Anybody could make a great looking image on this thing and actually it's hard to make something look bad. From the screenshots in the app promo, it seems that you can get good at it and create some amazing images if art is your thing. I'm a big fan.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is so much fun. I absolutely love it! It keeps you thinking while your having a blast l can not wait for the next chapter in the room. It is also a very beautiful game,probably my favorite mind bending puzzle game ever. Try The Room you won't be disappointed.
B000LXQVA4|4.0|If my baby were the one writing this review, he would give it 10 stars if he could! He LOVES it. No other toy or activity makes him as giddy as he is when he's in the Jumperoo. He's been using it since he was about 3.5 months, and appears to constantly discover new things about it. He will happily jump around or just sit and play with the toys sometimes up to 45 minutes. It's amazing.<br /><br />I love it too. My only complaint is that I wish there were more options for adjusting the height. We use a padded tray underneath his feet right now, and it seems to work.
B00AAW1322|5.0|Could uu add this song?  [...] thank u! This song is my 2nd have song and I would really appreciate it if you added this song!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Sit back and enjoy the ride as the wonderful characters take you through the ups and downs of daily life at Downton Abbey.
B0000AMJED|5.0|I bought this to have in my collection and it's as good as I remembered. I love all of these movies.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is very fun so far i like it a lot a d i can't get my friend to stop playing it
B008IYR2BA|5.0|Just needed to see the sixth season before we got Showtime.  This worked great for what was needed at the time.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is the best horse game in America at first I said this is dumb but when I started playing this game I could not stop! :3
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|This show is excellent. The perfect mix if drama and musical. Not just people breaking out in stupid song.  A+
B0000524CY|5.0|A remaster of a movie that sent people to seek psychologists in 1973.<br />This is the gold standard by which all horror films should measure themselves.<br />Even to this day, this movie causes chills.<br />Some parts are humorous, but nothing is held back in this remaster.
B00BQH9SY0|4.0|This album is perfect! I love their sound and lyrics. Cant wait for their new stuff and I hope they get more popular :)
B000S0GYRU|4.0|The technicolor made the movie very unique, along with the use of red lighting.<br />The first 20 minutes showed some defining scenes, but the movie loses my interest after that.<br />It doesn't quite live up to the hype from what I saw.
B0088P2A7A|5.0|I probably use this APP more than any others I have, two to one.  Gets me to the references I want in an excellent manner.  Recommended.
B000LPS3B2|3.0|It had a solid performance by Ananda Everingham. However, the movie did not execute as well as I had hoped.<br />Bottom line- it wasn't scary, and it wasn't very imaginative.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Game graphics are good. Wish there were more upgrades and that accessories were not so expensive.  Enjoy over all though.
B0028DRGDQ|4.0|With some good performances by the leads, Rec's editing was very good.<br />It felt like I was there watching real events.<br />The survivalist feeling was very evident, and it was well topped off by the eery makeup of the victims.
B0037B6QSY|5.0|I love this book.  I use it meditatively every morning during morning devotions.  When I get to the end, I plan to start over again and again.  It's so rich and I'm sure I'll get even more each time I explore it.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|this game is very fun and time consuming. Really enjoy playing and so do my kids. I have found that on some stages it really makes you think about your moves and the choices to connect the dots.
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|When any film or book reveals its heart it always splits opinion in two. Those against its heart will attack anything to detract from its reason for being. And those who love it will support any aspect in order not to be openly perceived as...<br /><br />The ultimate in a non-linear narrative. Different stories from different times each cut-up and overlapping. At certain points the dialogue converges as the seeds of truth begin to grow. Spectacular ideas vie with mesmerizing visuals. Only good versus bad seems to endure.<br /><br />And the politics of today are exploded. The greed of those who believe that their order is the natural order. You only hear that word 'natural' when people are being smashed. Groups are being formed. Money not people drives their lives.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas is for the human in us all. Not the moral delinquency of power. The beauty in each of us. None alone.
B005DJREJS|4.0|Season 1 was the most interesting.  Season 2 becomes more typical with its drawn out conflict between which boy Jenna should pick as her beau.  Witty but sometimes juvenile writing.  Lots of trendy &#34;text-icon.&#34;
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I read this book in Kindergarten but I decided to read it again a few years later. I  love reading about Dorothy and her companions adventures. I recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and travel.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The storyline is great, and the book was one of those that I could not put down until I finished it. Just LOVED the idea of alternative life in virtual world, in higher level than what we are able to do currently.  Absolutely mind boggling and great, especially to gamers.<br /><br />The very disturbing addiction to 80's things, that I see so many people doing in real life today was too much. Why do people want to live in the past so badly? That prevents living in the present and seeing the future. Yeah, I know, got nothing to do with the book but since this disturbing element is so strongly present to this modern day, I have to bring it up. Wake up people, and start living now!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Better than most of its kind. wont let me not rate it. I am really hoping there is more after this. otherwise I will be disappointed.  we will see.
B0012HF5NC|4.0|And what better way to celebrate Independence Day than by actually watching the movie that started it all! Ok, so that is not how it started ... but you can still watch this fun movie and eat a bowl of popcorn!
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game is so fun!!! Also very addicting. The only downside is the ads that always come up right after you open the game. You start, and you're tapping to put coins down, when this full screen ad pops up and you accidentally tap it. Then you're at the app store and you have to go back into the game again. Other than that, the game is really easy and user friendly. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|The game is great and exactly what I have been waiting for.  I really enjoyed DotP 2013 on PC and had been waiting for this game to come out for Android.  As with 2013, the deck building is limited but I don't mind it in this game. Grab it if you want a casual game on the go, but if deck building is deal breaker then you need MTGO for the PC.
B00451VH8E|5.0|It was exactly what was advertised, and I really enjoyed showing my son this classic movie! the shipping was quick and I would definitely recommend it.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I'm so glad that I got it for free as the &quot;Free App Of The Day!&quot; It creates some BEAUTIFUL pictures; they're so affective!! I think you should definitely get this game even if you have to pay. Just my opinion though! Worth it!!!! :-)
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|It was alright, the movie plot was not very interesting, and the graphics not so good, seemed better for children.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Though the dragons are amazing the game is way too slow.  I play Dragonvale more because I get more for free faster; things cost less; selling dragons brings way more cash ; and I can do more fun things like race.  Plus  it does not crash or have limited items for my Kindle compared to Apple phones or pads.  I would give it five stars for dragons; two stars for performance on Kindle; and one star for pricing.  I can also play solitary on Dragonvale-- sometimes I just don't feel like keeping up with the neighbors.  Especially when it takes more time than actually playing the game.  With Dragon Story I feel forced to play with others if I want to expand or advance levels.  Give us more choices and less cost and I'll change my rating.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie and a place in the set box to store it great idea. This one is my husbands favorite.  It was sad the M had to die but things happen
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince flynn is a remarkable writer who can keep you reading  when you know you should be doing something else.<br /><br />I will sorely miss not being able to read anymore of his books<br />It's a shame we have lost such a great talent.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|I don't know why, but everyone in the house loves Shaun the sheep.  It is pretty amazing that characters who don't even talk can make all of us laugh, from the 2 year old to the 18 year old, and even Mom and Dad.  These are hilarious!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|loving it this game is so cool I could play it for the rest of my life that's what I say
B00005JLEU|5.0|Yes, I would recommend this to a friend, very interesting, great learning from her experiences, funny, sad, & very educational
B00B0X4PIO|4.0|This is the 3rd book on Afghanistan by K Hosseini that I've read, I enjoyed it all the way through but felt the ending was flat.....I wanted more!!!!!
B00B2DSK06|5.0|My 3 year old loves this movie, my 7 year old loves this movie and even my husband and me too! Super funny, excellent story. Gotta love Sarah Silverman and John C.
B0007P0LO8|5.0|Although much has already been said about this production I find it valuable in the retelling. The music and the performers are excellent, which is most important. The presentation might be better done buy it was poignant nevertheless. The message was never in doubt. I enjoyed it and will continue to enjoy it with pleasure.
0385338082|5.0|This is one of Sophie Kinsella's best writing.  It had me laughing out loud!  I would recommend this book to anyone who likes an entertaining read.
B0062YADWI|5.0|The carabiner is solid.  The metal is the depth of a key and the whole thing is roughly the length of a key.  It does not feel like it adds extra clutter on the key chain and fits very well in my pocket.  I bought this product because I just got married and am very active and needed a place to put my wedding ring when I play sports.  This little carabiner is perfect for the job, plus adds other functions as well.  Great buy.
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|if you make more like this IM BUYING!!!!!!  love the idea and the story line. not to hard or easy. its a good time
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun game. Just started playing. Hopefully I won't need friend help to continue. When I played on Facebook I needed neighbors to complete certain quests.

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Really  good game, love the story line. Almost the same concept as call of the cuthuluhu, but less scary. I want  sequel
B003G4W49C|5.0|Amazing book. This was my second time reading it and I definitely recommend it to anyone interested in the sci fi genre. I plan on purchasing the rest of the series as funds allow
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Holds your interest -- has a storyline.  Can't wait to read the 3rd book in this series.  I like this series more than Fifty Shades.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|Hilarious at times and profound at other times. Its not just how Don sees himself its also how many of his foibles you see in yourself
B0059WTMLW|5.0|Overall design is very good.  All the features required for efficient game play is provide.  Like that temporary numbers are automatically removed when permanant number is placed.
B00005JPS8|5.0|This was a replacement video that I had but was damaged by some I had loaned out to. Love it
B005LAIH2C|4.0|I didn't get a chance to see this movie when it was in the theaters but glasd I got it as it is a fun movie to watch.<br />Has a different twist than the Hansel & Gretel I read when I was a kid but that is a good thing...
B003UYV08E|5.0|This was a replacement video that I thought I had and didn't or someone had taken without permission. Love it
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Not sure how Lee Child does it? This chapter in REACHER' s life was utterly amazing. Twists and turns even a die hard fan wouldn't expect. I literally could not stop reading this; oops, I hope my boss doesn't see this! @@This is the one they need to make THE movie into, sans Cruise, then people would see the real JACK REACHER.
1439102813|5.0|It was an upclose and personal --it hit home for me--I have a 51 yr.old brother who has it<br />thanks!!
B000JMKQX0|3.0|No beginning middle or end - just like reading a report or \\"oral history\\" lol - definitely thought provoking but nowhere near The Road or even Enders Game ....not a bad read.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|Ferris is a classic. Hysterical and creative! I love all of Hughes's movies. They reflect the culture of the their time period.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I think I have read all his books some I liked better than others and this was just okay and so predictable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The only horse game that is fun on a tablet or computer really good you people out there that don't play this game you should play it.
B00633W614|5.0|I think I enjoyed this book even more than the first of the series . The characters were all interesting and the pace of the story was wonderful I didn't  't want to put it down
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This program is a Class Act!  I'll be getting all the seasons available now, and I'm looking forward to the 4th season.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A true page turner...could not put it down!! Very insightful and despite the subject matter this was not at all depressing or a downer...you end up caring about the characters and I hated to see the story end...would in fact love to read a sequel...
B006XF5BTG|4.0|On the surface, this book seems a bit simplistic. Matthews basically suggests that 90% of fitness authors, trainers, and gym rats have gotten it all wrong, while he has gotten it all right. Well, if you can actually swallow that, your name is probably Michael Matthews.<br /><br />Matthews fancies himself something of a myth-buster, and sets out to 'set the record straight' on a lot of issues. Yet in his rush to embrace black-and-white answers, his own thinking is sometimes sloppy or under-researched, and occasionally just plain wrong, causing him to peddle the same sort of broscience that he claims to abhor.<br /><br />For example, he jokes in the blurb that you don't need to constantly change up your routine to \\"confuse\\" your muscles, since your muscles \\"lack cognitive abilities\\". Yet elsewhere he writes that you musn't combine endurance and resistance training, because they \\"send mixed signals to the muscles\\". Um, make up your mind, Matthews: either muscles can get 'confused' by mixed signals or they can't.<br /><br />In the section about plant proteins, he praises foods like quinoa and peas, while urging people to stay away from soy. His first reason for this is base on a myth: that soy increases oestrogen levels. This is bogus science: Raised oestrogen levels have only ever been found in rats, and no human study has ever replicated the observation in humans. And people have been eating the stuff for thousands of years.<br /><br />The reason this myth is so widely spread despite having such a fragile foundation has less to do with good science and more to do with how aggressively the dairy industry (trying to reclaim the market share that soy milks have stolen from them in recent decades) has promoted it. Matthews has mistaken corporate marketing for science.<br /><br />The other reason he sites with soy is that a large proportion of it is GMO, which he calls \\"very dangerous\\". But he clearly hasn't thought much about the issue, and misses two vital points.<br /><br />Firstly, the vast majority of the world's soy is used as animal feed. More GMO soy goes into the steaks, salmon, chicken breasts and whey shakes that Matthews promotes than could ever be consumed directly by people (remember, it takes MANY pounds of feed to produce one pound of meat, farmed fish or dairy). And those animals that aren't being fed GMO soy are likely being fed GMO corn or GMO alfalfa; since animal feed needs to be as cheap as possible, GMO crops are frequently chosen.<br /><br />Conversely, soy for human consumption is frequently non-GMO and even organic. You'll likely find that nothing in the supermarket is as frequently labelled \\"non-GMO\\" and \\"organic\\" as soy products.<br /><br />Ironically, by urging people to stay away from soy because of GMO, Matthews is advocating one of the most GMO-intensive diets possible: one that is heavily reliant on large loads of GMO-based animal feed. And ironically, if the typical bodybuilder wants to reduce his complicity in GMO, supplementing his diet with some soy would be a good way to do it.<br /><br />So, due to sloppy thinking like the above examples, there's more broscience in this book than there should be. For the most part though, the book is worthwhile, especially where Matthews sticks to the basics. His K.I.S.S. approach generally strips away a lot of the fluff and concentrates on the tried and true core of basic bodybuilding.<br /><br />So you won't learn much about isometrics, periodisation, health, drop sets, or other things that you may find helpful and/or enjoyable. But you will get the foundation. You'll learn the basics of progressive resistance, macronutrient balancing, how your body manages muscle and fat, which exercises are best, how to balance cutting and bulking, and so on.<br /><br />As long as you take it with a grain of salt at times, this book is an excellent place to start.
B000J1U0ZK|4.0|I loved the cars , fast pace, location was good, missed some on the other original member but the movie was overall good
B00632HWOG|5.0|Works great, easy to use and has yet to freeze or give me any problems. I recommend it if you have a yahoo account.
B002DFOXIA|5.0|Full of action and fast pace and it never stop. I love all the places you go and the car are really nice.

0142418471|5.0|i bought this for my 15 year old daughter.  she loved it and wants to read the next one that is advertised on the back. she liked it so well, that i am going to read it myself.
B0018OHFK0|5.0|This was the beginning it got you hook on the series that followed, the cars, the action, it was fast pace it was great.
B006LSZECO|5.0|All I have to say is that I didn't see that coming! It's one of the best books I've read in a long time.
0634049011|4.0|Back in my much younger days I played percussion for many years so music theory isn't a completely foreign concept to me, but I'm relatively new to guitar so how it's applied to a fretboard is a brand new realm.  For the most part this book is laid out well and contains a LOT of good, practical, and applicable information.  I've been working my way through it as my guitar knowledge and proficiency has begun to increase, so a lot of this makes sense and is helping me to better understand how and why certain things work the way they do on the guitar.<br /><br />However, some of these chapters leave a lot to be desired as the information is fairly sparse and that makes the exercises confusing.  For instance, while I understand triads and how they are constructed, for the life of me I have no idea what Mr. Tagliarino is trying to teach me in Chapter 14.  The lesson is less than a page long before diving into a bunch of exercises that tell me to complete the close voiced triads and identify their patterns.  While he lists C-A-G-E-D \\"cowboy chord\\" charts, he does so almost as an afterthought and then forgets to mention that these are the five patterns to which the exercises are referring (I think; based on the exercise answers I'm still a bit unclear if that's actually the case).  On top of that, two paragraphs below these charts he mentions that \\"...we will see three basic shapes that repeat to cover the entire fretboard\\" and then \\"Don't expect to be able to play all six strings of these shapes at once. We will divide each of them into four small three string shapes\\".  Okay, if we're seeing THREE basic shapes then how do we divide them into FOUR small three string shapes and the exercises reference FIVE patterns???  On top of THAT, the patterns as identified in the answer key look nothing like the patterns on the cowboy chord charts.  For a rookie guitar player, this has made me dizzy trying to figure it out.<br /><br />Still a good book and I would buy it again, but obviously I'm going to need to pool additional resources that explain some of these concepts in a different way before I will understand everything Mr. Tagliarino is trying to teach me.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Have lots of fun with this great application. I use it all the time when i travel around the country<br /><br />I
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I really enjoy this story line. The first book the Selection got me hooked and I eagerly awaited this sequel. Sadly, this book did not really progress the story. I waited a year for it to be released only to end this book at roughly the same point that the first book had left off at. It is a good read, but if you can wait until the whole trilogy is released then I would recommend it. I found it frustrating.
159463176X|5.0|A great book and everyone should have a copy, very good read and made you think about how the rest of the world lives.
B000059MEL|5.0|It just doesn't get any better than this. Daft Punk on vinyl is a treat for the senses. And having that gorgeous sleeve is always a bonus.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|This show is awesome!!!! I am soooo addicted the stream was perfect no glitches I was able to watch it straight thru it had great subtitle options
B009E3EY38|5.0|I'm not going to waste a whole lot of your time here, but if you're hoping for that Zeppelin reunion concert this might be as close as you will likely get. They sound great all things considered and though this goes back to 2007 if you're a fan you might just find yourself saying \\"Yeah I would still want to see them live.\\" It's a very clean sounding set and I was gifted the one with both the DVD and Blu-Ray all well worth it. The best thing to do here is throw out some of my favorite live album sets over the years and just let you decide for yourself. It ranks at least as good or better then these live albums CCR Live in Europe, YES SONGS, DIRE STRAITS ON THE NIGHT, BRUCE SPRINGSTREEN & THE E STREET BAND LIVE/1975-85 and almost as good as the Fan Club only U22 (2011/12) and FROM THE GROUND UP (2012/13) with Edge's 15 picks. You won't go wrong here with Celebration Day like some live albums that might've let you down over the years. ENJOY and close your eyes you're almost there.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game gets your mind thinking, I couldnt put it down. I played it for probably over an hour today
B00C7BZYRO|4.0|This entry from the US to the 2013 Seattle International Film Festival worried me. I was afraid it was going to be non-stop talking heads. We join a blabbermouth young man who is clearly a sociopath, finds all the right words, charms all in his path and serves his own needs, all the while taking liberal sips from his ever-present whiskey flask. We soon realize he is experiencing black-out drunks, so we start to worry. Eek!<br /><br />When Director James Ponsoldt crafts a second-act meeting with the young man's long-absent father, things start to gain traction.<br /><br />We watch:<br />  * Miles Teller (\\"Footloose\\" 2011) is our hard-partying hero, never at a loss for words, impervious to insults and indifferent to school. This charming character is a far cry from his pathetic lost boy in \\"Rabbit Hole.\\" Good for Teller!<br />  * Shailene Woodley (\\"The Descendants\\") is the awkward misfit who is unexpectedly targeted by our hero. It starts as a lark, but once he gets to know her...<br />  * Jennifer Jason Leigh (\\"Revenge\\") is our hero's mother, distracted by her responsibilities and reluctant to mar his happy memories of his father.<br />  * Kyle Chandler (\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\") is that absent father, whom he tracks down so they can reminisce about his happy childhood.<br /><br />Several things were said that I appreciated: a Geometry teacher says, \\"If a student fails, the teacher fails.\\" A classmate meets with him and as he leaves he turns and says, \\"You're not the joke everyone thinks!\\" A friend says he needs \\"someone to yank you out of neutral!\\"<br /><br />This is notable for several extremely long scenes between the two young stars. Very few older actors can sustain scenes this long. Kudos!<br /><br />This is rated R because of some sexuality, lots of drinking, and a bit of profanity. Check it out from Amazon.
B007VUA7VO|1.0|Alright, I found this app and it looks very interesting so I installed it for free. Then, I used this app for 6 days now...when I play my game, reading a book, and watching a video, etc...before that I charged my kindle fire and after it charges up to 100%. Then when I used it the battery was down to 50%. I was NOT VERY HAPPY AT ALLLLL!!!!!!!!! I thought this app will help me to save my battery but it DIDN'T!!!!!! I HIGHLY recommend not to get this app. This app does not save your battery at all. Very disappointed.
B000SEI230|5.0|This is one of my very favorite books. It makes me laugh and cry and makes me believe in miracles. My boyfriend and I both love this book and Nicholas Sparks. He is an amazing author and we haven't found one book of his that we haven't loved.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This set if books has now become my absolute favorite, better than The Stand or even Gone With The Wind!
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I like this game, but not enough game time provided. Needs more levels in order to keep one interested in playing
B004RWYNT6|5.0|Amazon recommended this to me and it is amazing.  If these guys would have been around in the 70's they would have been legendary by now.  The vocals are so good.  There is not a bad song on the album.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|This is a good game to keep one occupied and interested in attempting to reach other levels I really like this game
0143119680|5.0|I enjoyed this trilogy so will that I purchased the next book.  It is of great suspense and very enjoyable reading.
B0086700CM|5.0|I play this game EVERY DAY since I loaded it onto my kindle. Can't wait to start playing it again
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Lots of just tap-tap-tapping to find clues.  Somewhat annoying but I got the game for free.  Guess you get what you pay for.
159463176X|2.0|I loved reading the Kite Runner so I was anxiously looking forward to reading this novel. The theme of the novel is interesting but the way it is developed confused me. The story is described from many different points of view which doesn't flow well.
0793563836|4.0|This is (are) the perfect book(s) for the very beginner. If you have never picked up a bass or are very new you definitely want this book. I am a big believer in learning how to read standard music notation. It will make you a better bass player in the long run and much more capable than someone who just reads tabs.<br /><br />Learning how to read music will teach you to understand the scales, the notes in the scales and how they relate to songs. It also makes learning the song faster when you are memorizing a song. Understand it will take time. Give yourself that time and keep practicing. You will be glad you did.<br /><br />If you already know bass clef, this book is below your level. You would probably benefit from a more advanced book. But overall this is great educational material.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This is the best Queensryche album since Promised Land.  Geoff Tate should rename his version of Queensryche or just admit it is a solo act.  It is a short album, but it leaves you wanting more!  Some songs style remind me of Fates Warning and Metal Church. I hope this is the first of many more albums with La Torre, who is a better singer than today's Geoff Tate.  Buy with confidence, but do not expect another Operation Mindcrime or Empire.
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I  played this in the past @ King.com and liked it very much but this is different somehow from that version - not as enjoyable to play. But I guess you can't complain when it's free
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I love this game. It is so addictive and the Colorado and rooms are amazing.  The only thing is that it will freeze up some of the time' however gets better with every update.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I haven't played it all that much - I really don't know how to play it!  If there is somewhere that tells you how to jump and slide and roll, I haven't found it and it's been just trial and error to get as far as I did.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|A great continuation of this wonderful series. Can't wait to get started on the next book. The characters and plot make you keep reading late into the night.

B004O3YGMC|5.0|I've used this app for accessing movies from my pc to play on my Kindle Fire while on my home wifi network. It works great and was very easy to install and setup. I haven't tried accessing my pc files from outside my network over the internet, but it says it can be done. Great app at a great price.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I bought these headphones about 10 years ago - I'm just now having an issue where there's no longer audio coming from the left side.  I highly recommend this set as they're light and comfy (ear buds and I do not get along!) - they stay in place during walking/running.  The sound quality is just as good as one would expect with Sony.  I'll be purchasing another pair soon!
B003XVYLDU|4.0|certainly makes you think in the end.  a very interesting complex book.  i always wanted to read it, and finally have.
B000J10ERO|3.0|I loved Man of Steel and gave it a well deserved 5 stars. Superman Returns is much more of a mixed bag. This movie had it's strong points and it's weak points. One of the movie's strong points is Brandon Routh's performance as Superman. Routh portrays the character very well. The character truly feels like Superman and is very convincing in his role as hero. I especially liked the scenes where Superman saves the airplane and lands it in the baseball stadium and when the bullet bounces off of Superman's eye. You see the Superman character with all the powers and abilities you'd expect. Kevin Spacey's performance as Lex Luther was also fantastic. Luther is a convincing villain who feels like a real threat. And of course John Williams Superman score is fantastic. But there are also some noticeable negatives. 1 of the worst negatives about Superman Returns is that it's WAY too romance/love story centric. (The almost complete lack of romance is 1 of the many things I really appreciate about Man of Steel.) This weakness is actually overstated by some of the 1 star reviews. It's not as though the movie is just romance/love story and there's nothing more to it than that,as some 1 star reviews seem to suggest. But there is way too much of this and the high amount of it causes this to not be a great movie. Another weakness is the lack of action. While the action that is in the movie is exciting and well done,there just isn't enough of it. (Man of Steel has a much more satisfying level of action.) The story/plot is so-so. Not the greatest,not the worst. At the end of the day this movie is a very mixed bag. The cast,music,and special effects are great. But the lack of action and the romance/love story heaviness of this movie make it unsatisfying. Superman Returns is worth seeing but is not a film that can be watched over and over again. 3 out of 5 stars.
B002J301NM|4.0|I really liked this chick flick the first time I saw it because it was in some ways different than most.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoys the genre and has never seen it before.  However, if you have already seen it a time or two, you may not enjoy it as much watching it again, knowing where the plot goes.
B00942G4UA|5.0|If you REALLY believe `your' gov't is watching out for YOUR best interests then skip this..<br /><br />If you want to see what is REALLY happening, and most likely some of the reasons for obesity and diabetes in this country, then watch it.. Warning -- You may NEVER eat a McDonalds Chicken McNugget again...
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|The third season is probably the best so far because all the characters, both major and minor, are developed enough that I really feel like I know them.  For example, it wasn't until Season 3 that I found the Buy More employees to be endearing rather than annoying.  I also really like the direction that the plot goes, and found myself hooked and anticipating the next episode.  Casey gets a lot more character development in this season, and by the end of the season I was totally crushing on him.  It was also nice to see a lot of character growth in Morgan, and the Morgan/Awesome dynamic is a lot of fun.
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|Loved it. I read the hobbit back in the 70's before it was cool.. :)  Very nice job of words to pics.. A tad on the long side, but worth every minute.

B0064X7FVE|5.0|I  had my son  program this into my  computer and Kindle and find I cannot live without it. I  check it to find out if I can move furniture without rain, snow or blizzards, to see the time needed for airport runs, with rain or snow, the temperature of children living in other  cities.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I wish the graphics were better and it was a little less clunky, but all in all it is a pretty good time vacuum.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|my  grandchildren really enjoy this series. it is a bit more exciting , even older children enjoy. My  grandchildren have taught  me to enjou all angry birds
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Almost as good as the original stage play - but no Sarah Brightman nor Michael Crawford.  The best video performance.
B002B79BVO|5.0|this is a time in my life that I lived.. I found it AUTHENTIC  and quite good. the characters are  great and casting was  critical to this story.. lead actors  in this series make  the show. It was compelling at every  episode. The  smallest details are  critically important and I found this to be  important.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|This movie is not near as good as the stage play or the Royal Albert Hall production when it comes to performance (acting and singing).  The movie does add a certain excitement that is derived from the filmography.
B001A5HBAG|5.0|This is an example of  the feminism movement and why it  rose to change attitudes about women. Important  script  for younger generations to see. A  view to what  is happening again in our  political system.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I would like new features in the game like New cars and trucks and New tracks maybe like a mud pit or a new Chevy Silverado that would be cool
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|the Angry Birds game is an excellent  and charming game for children and semi-adults. Simple and yet complex,  builds  abstract reasoning in young  children..
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Much better than the movie. I finally understand why people said I need to read the book. Can't wait to start the second part of the series...heard it only gets better.
B00009AOBI|5.0|A great and wonderful beautiful movie and you fall in love with this movie . It is sad but, and a True Story ! Please buy it  and trust me you will enjoy it and it will probable bring tears to your eyes but, everyone needs a good cry. This movie is worth every<br />penny you spend on it. I promise you'll love it. Get it now. Thank You.
B007RAJVR4|5.0|Every song on this album is easy listening and sing along style! He has such a great voice and the guitar work is out of this world! I love his style and he relays peace...what a great place to be!!!!
B00138EV8U|5.0|Awesome soundtrack and everyone should already have this by now. I have this CD, Album, Cassette you name it I have it . I also,<br />have about 3-4 copies of the movie too. That 's how good this soundtrack is. If someone don't like this then they have a problem with<br />their head. It's  wonderful, Awesome, great so, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Get on line and buy it now. Thank You!
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|The first time I used this product I left my home in the middle of rush hour traffic; it got me from Sherman Oaks to Mid Wilshire in under 40 minutes.....AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Such a fantastic read!<br /><br />It was funny, loving, heart aching and so intense! But the humour of it did not let me put the book down, I read it within a day!
B0058W74UY|1.0|I tried. I really tried but I downloaded this to my Kindle Fire and it just didn't work as advertised. While not a great computer whiz, I'm enough of one to know when a program is not compatible.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game although I must admit I have trouble with the controls of the game. I am always getting caught.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app keeps you guessing and is so fun to play.  I just love it!<br />Well worth the money to buy this app.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|I had actually rented this movie and watched it but it was so forgettable, I rerented it, thinking I'd never seen it before. Disappointment x 2
B00BSBU4EC|1.0|We donwloaded this movie to watch on an airplne flight.  The video would never open and has disappeared from my video library.  I got charged and never actually watched the movie.  No idea how to get a refund.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable did not fit but amazon refunded my money.  Thanks Amazon!  I will continue to purchase my kindle p roducts and more.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game would be great for a road trip with upper elementary or middle school.  I had a lot of fun the past two days with it.  It is worth the download.
B003WUYOQ6|3.0|I have another book by this author and I liked it.  I was unsure about this book.  Even though I've not finished it, it seems to be all right.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Like this app a lot, it had me hooked. I stayed up way too late trying to escape. Would definitely recommend this app.
B006UKFFE0|5.0|A great guide if you want to jump and start. The first 10 chapters very helpful the last 5 need to improve a little bit. Not easy to follow up. Even so a good guide that I will use for myself and my students.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|I've read only a few TinTin comics, but always liked them. ANd my kids seemed to like them as well. A little over the head of my youngest, but my oldest (6 years old) was into it.<br /><br />I looked great and moved swiftly.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I Enjoyed every aspect of all 3 of the books.  Very Easy read and very entertaining.  I hope Suzanne Collins continues to write books of this type.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Great movie!  Awesome rendition of all the types of love - young love, old love, rejected love, true love.  An awesome movie that makes you laugh, cry, and want to punch somebody.  A many layered comedy : )
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Action packed thriller.A fan of other MI movies this was another good.It is a very good movie!You will not be disappointed.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|What an interesting movie; even more so since it is based on true events. Jonah Hill was excellent and this is one of my fav roles I have seen Brad play.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Watched the 1st season at the request of my sister and now we can't stop watching it! Great show to get involved with.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is very interesting. Every month the theme will change, for example in January it will be Tokyo. The point of this game is to run away from a guard because you vandalised. I recommend this game for people that like action games.P.S these characters are epic in this game. Lots of people I know PLAY this game .
B00B89WXYS|5.0|This album grabs you with the first beat and doesn't let go until the last...then makes you want to come right back for more! If you liked &#34;Waking up&#34;, you will absolutely love &#34;Native&#34;!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|To start reading the next book. Loved the story line and the characters. Gideon and Eva share such a passion. Can't wait to finish their story.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this is a awesome app. you get to have the fun of action and adventure in one app. if you like iron man get this app. you will not regret it. you will catch yourself playing it all day
B0000AUHQT|5.0|I teach this novel in the classroom, and this is the best version as a complement to the text. Students enjoy the novel and become very engaged when watching this film version. Very well done and a venerable classic.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A well written novel, though not as  captivating as the others.  Also, a rather depressing subject as with the others.  Life in Afghanistan is harsh and unforgiving, something that most of us can't comprehend or know.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This was a gift and I asked the recipient and was told to rate this item 5 out of 5 stars.
B00DBSZEH2|4.0|I would probably not have any kids watch this flick. I can be fairly violent at times. Over all it was entertaining and Gretel was easy to look at. But this is not your kids fairy tale.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Very fascinating book, lots of twists and turns.  I actually loved it and couldn't put it down.  Highly recommend it!
1556438850|5.0|I chose this rating because this book not only gives you A-Z in the teaching of Yoga but also gives theory, history, breath sequences, photographs, instructions on moving through poses and more.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Gideon and Eva, they're prefect for each other, we know it. There's a lot, A LOT more sex scene than the previous books. So here's what you'll want to know:<br />1) This is not the end of the series;<br />2) It's really like Fifty Shades towards the end of this book;<br />3) You might want to read it within 7 days, so that you can return the book and get your money back once you finish it, depends on if you want to keep it in the kindle.<br />So overall, it's not that bad, but really expect more of the depth of love, the development of their love story, instead of too much sex...
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Great job, devs! This is going to be a wonderful new way to express one's artistry. Thank you for your vision and your fearless implementation. Keep up the great work. :-)
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|All of the puzzles were pretty easy to figure out but it was fun. The graphics were great and this all takes place in a room so there was no need to jump back and forth in scenes like other puzzle games. I'm looking forward to the next chapter.
B00CDT41RY|1.0|Very surprised at this movie but that just goes to show how out of touch with popular culture I am at 69.  Thought I remembered great reviews of this one so I decided to watch.  What trash!
B00CGPPMKU|1.0|I thought I would try this app out through the Amazon Test Drive feature before installing it on my phone.<br /><br />I set the flow to 100% and dragged my finger (mouse) around for a bit. While holding your finger in one spot (holding the mouse button down), the line continues to \\"flow\\" (expand, swirl and paint) around that point. After about 30 seconds, the app locks up and the screen turns black. \\"Force close?\\" eventually pops up and is the only way to recover the device.<br /><br />I tried it 3 different times with various brushes and it crashed every time.
B001NTJV6G|5.0|Keep it coming Eryka!  This is one of your best that put you on the map and a good grown and sexy album to get any party started.
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Having read Rainbow Rowell's first book, Attachments, which is a much better book than its genre and marketing might suggest, I downloaded this without even reading a sample.  Do yourself a favor and download this book right now and read it.  It's like a punch in the gut how much it reading it feels like what it felt like to be young and feel powerless and get overwhelmed by love.  It's one of the first YA books I've ever read that accurately depicts how cruel life can be for teenagers, and how loving someone is its own type of exquisite torment.  So yes, buy this book.  And when you're done, and you feel like crying but you're also happy at the same time, go read Attachments and spend all day smiling.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I play this on our desktop.... thought this might be better.  Limited shots are possible,,, game itself is not fun
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|If I could give it more stars I would!Vast colors and designs to work with. Works<br />great on kindle fire HD also you could add your own designs and colors to your<br />own pictures witch is very unique.I recommend this app if you like art work and<br />color designs!!!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Decent way to pass the time. Too many different collections though. It seems like you have to spend money or play the game for a really long time, to get anywhere.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Every show is just so fascinating to me because it is like one huge brand new trauma that makes you feel like you are really there ,..<br /><br />Plus I love the cast of characters ... every one of then Jennifer Jureau and hubby and child, David Rossi .. definitely good choice  Thomas Gibson perfect boss .. shemar moore ... absolutely amazing actor and kind of like the hero ... and Penelope Garcia ... how can you not love her ... then there is the infamous Dr. Reid ... Matthew Gray Gubler ... in real life he must be a genius as well because he acts like it is totally really for him being a genius ...<br /><br />And there always is new and more graphic content and it is always REFRESHING and new twists and turns<br /><br />And I also like how it shows what is going on in their personal lives as well ...<br /><br />Hotchner's wife getting shot by George Foyette ... aka THE REAPER<br /><br />And then Matthew Gray Gubler ... getting abducted ... deallng with the dead kid and then his addiction and then falling in love and crying his eyes out in front of everyone<br /><br />then JJ and her Hubby .. when his partner got shot and he goes inside the building and JJ is screaming &#34;Will will&#34; and then pleads with hotchner to go In and get him ... then she asks him to propose to her in the hospital room and that beautiful wedding<br /><br />I do miss Emily Prentiss quite a bit ... though Jeanne Triplehorn or Trippleton ?? is doing a good job<br /><br />And of course we cannot forget the Used to be a complete BITCH boss who recently just died ...<br /><br />And Morgan talking to the public about being molested and<br /><br />They show their own personal hardships and tragedies as we all do in life .. and that is one of the reasons I love it so much<br /><br />And every week it is something &#34;on the edge of your seat&#34; different<br /><br />And then there is Hotchner having fallen in love again ... which is soo cool if you have been watching Criminal Minds from the very beginning and his son<br /><br />And one of my favorite scenes was Rossi helping Hotchner coach is son's soccer team and the ball goes back to Jack and Hotcher is saying &#34;kick it Jack&#34; and Hotchner and Ross are excitedly walking down toward the goal line and jack kicks it inn for a goal .. and how they high five and do that holding of the hands while all of the kids pass through<br /><br />I love how David Rossi has become this kind of &#34;mentor&#34; to everyone ... and like helping out Prentiss with those exercisms and how he showed up with Morgan on recent show ... while he was remodeling<br /><br />I love David Rossi ..

B0079R8KXG|4.0|I purchased this instead of the official Kindle case because it came in a different color. It fits the device well and the stand works fine.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|This is awesome, hugely derivative, fun, filled with innumerable references to other fantasy and Sci-Fi, and thick with teenaged angst. It is, in many respects, the prototypical YA fantasy epic. Girl learns she is special. Another world exists as an overlay onto our own.  Unseen beings surround us. A destiny. Good vs. Evil. It's totally over the top (and soon to be a major motion picture!) and the author knows exactly how not to take herself or the story too seriously.  Can't wait to read book 2.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is exactly what I wanted in a notebook app times however many notebooks I need!  Very simple; a little lacking in font customization, but for a free app, it's exactly what I wanted.
B004HX4RT6|1.0|They seem identical, both coming with loads of ads for their other games. So don't bother paying if you can find Chess Free by AI Factory.<br /><br />You have option to export PGN, but the PGNs aren't legal. Other computer programs sticking to the PGN standard cannot read the games.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am addicted to the entire series. Looking forward to 2014 when the next season starts up. It's a long wait!
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This novel, written in the form of a series of letters from one character to another, introduces you to people of profound personal character, showing bravery, tenderness, integrity and love, to name just a few qualities.  I am loving spending time with them, so am nursing the book, reading slowly, because I will be unhappy to leave their world when I finish.  It's a bit of a slow starter, so have patience, the plot and characterizations develop and grow stronger as the book proceeds.  Some of the writing, such as descriptions of vistas and even clouds, is utterly glorious.  I will be buying copies as gifts for friends and family.  I was told by the person who recommended the book that it is based on a true story.  If so, it is gratifying to know that such nobility existed in life, and not just in the author's imagination.
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|I looked forward to this movie, having digested hundreds of episodes in the past couple years. TOS, TNG, ENT in entirety, and some of the others. What I witnessed in the theater look like a cheat. I expected more from Damon Lindeloff. Every other episode or movie in canon relied on dramatic leads to pull in the viewer. The only actor that provided any real gravitas was Peter Weller. Benedict Cumberbatch's talent was wasted.<br /><br />The movie felt like a Frankenstein monster. while parts and pieces of other scripts were bulk cut and pasted into this and the stitching is visible. I'll avoid spoilers here. But there were a couple moments I grimaced and said \\"come onnn\\".<br /><br />I'll still buy it on release, because I loved the visual effects. The USS Vengeance was fierce. Why were the Enterprise warp effects changed between the two movies?<br /><br />Those are just a couple of comments. I'm not a Trekker, but I do appreciate Gene Roddenberry's creation, and the legacy of hope and community it has fostered in the fanbase. It's a shame that this movie lost interest in the humanity and went instead with revenge.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My grandson (9 yrs old) gives this 5 stars--every chance he gets he plays it.  Have to limit his time or he would play all day.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|THIS APP IS AWESOME AND THE GRAPHICS ARE AWESOME!!!!!<br />DON'T LISTEN TO THE BAD REVIEWS!!!!<br />I RECOMMEND THAT YOU GET THIS APP IF U ABSOLUTELY LOVE HORSES!!!!!!!
B008ROZAQU|5.0|Great fun, good cast of past actors and funny to watch. My kids love the animals and action. I recommend.
B00290FWYS|3.0|i purchased that Cafe Del Mar Collection the package or the box wel made and nice but the most important is what in the CD i like few Tracks but unfortunately not all the tracks i did like .. and its my fault i wish if there was way were you can choose your own Track / play list and get burned / Copy on CD then they send it to me .. i don't like the digital download because if any internet interruption happens during the download i lose it and the money with it
B005S9ELVC|4.0|Good but not great nor superb. This is a watered down version of the UNTOUCHABLES (assuming you saw that great picture). It has lots of action and does a fairly good job with the costumes, dialogue and setting but it's lacking heart, layered plotting and memorable characters. Sometimes it feels like the violence is a lazy reaction when something sophisticated would do the picture more justice. That said, it's a fun enough flick but with the star-studded cast I was wrongly presuming it would be exceptional. OVERALL GRADE: B minus to B.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|I gave this movie 3 stars. I thought it was an intertaining movie. Not the greatest movie in the world, but a pretty good movie.
B00CHILW64|5.0|This was an excellent movie regarding family, determination and a will to live! Based on a true story, The movie is very moving, and tells a great story of survival!
B003KRJNBW|3.0|Pretty good movie. Thought the picture was a little dark for my taste. But over all a pretty good movie.
B004GTKP3S|5.0|They do it the right way across the pond! The Brittish have these period series nailed! Superb acting! Excellent plot line! and good, clean wholsome fun! Not like the trash put out here in the U.S.
B00CO8D3G4|1.0|Not worth the money.  Meandering reasoning, nothing new, nothing concrete. And, apparently, the offer of full refund does not actually work.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|Are you kidding me?  This is an excellent CD and it is going to be played a lot!  We all love it
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Liked the concept, which appealed to us adults who grew up playing video games in the gas stations and such. Fun story which appealed to the kids. We liked it.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Classic movies, now on blu-ray.  I can still leave the fourth movie, but whatever.  Watched through them with my 12-year-old.  Good times.
B0018QBAXG|5.0|This is a GREAT feel good movie! Clean cut, wholesome, family friendly, good acting, great story and heart tugging moments made this a winner in our house. It was wonderfully done.
B00DGMVJAO|2.0|fairly predictable story, acting is pretty bad.  Ewan McGregor is of course a good actor, but he is not the star of the movie.
B001JIDE3M|5.0|This was great because it took sci-fi, mixed it with exciting, blended it with adventure, while keeping it clean cut! They kept it wholesome and edgy. The visuals were great and the entire family would watch it again! We loved this movie.
1469220725|5.0|This is a great story, Up until this book 50 Shades was on the top of my list but now there is no comparison.  There are so many unanswered questions and characters to follow that I can hardly wait for the next book to be published!!!<br /><br />The only character that I find offensive and of no use to the story line is Brett Kline, Eva and Gideon have enough to overcome without bringing in another obstacle.  If the next book even implies that Eva would have anything to do with Brett it would be enough for me to just put down the books and not finish reading the series!!  Fingers crossed for a happy ending!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Easy to understand and works well. Requires you to think how the discovered pieces fit to solve the level (and open the elevator door). Enjoy.
B003E74B24|5.0|I loved it!! Makes me want to read more! I couldn't put it down! I I will be buying the full auto biography next!! I
B000VSBX34|5.0|I purchased this dvd to somewhat complete a Beatles movie collection. Very happy with this purchase!! I know you will be also.
B00122HUN0|4.0|I haven't listened to this album in a long time,and it brought back great memories. I went to her concert when the album was released. It was great and so now I listen to it with my lil girl and she loves it. It's awesome :)
B001EC0OMM|5.0|This was a play that had been written for her. She then was able to have it made into a star studded film.  Truly a favorite of mine for all of the actors involved.  Ruth Hussey (not sure of the spelling) has been great with her snarky quips!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think it is really. a good app for little kids teems and grown ups<br /> kids love it that are my age
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|There are no instructions with this game.  To much story reading that doesn't give you a clue has to what is happening on the screen.
B006ICOK00|4.0|Seriously effective for timelapse motion on a budget without the need for sophisticated video editing programs. Very clean results. Also adding a power adapter allows for excellent plant timelapse. Good variety of settings to produce differing results.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|My God I was scared I SAW THE GRAPHICS AND GOT TO ONE PAGE SAW HIM  AND WUSSED OUT IT IS THAT GOOD! THE GRAPHICS ARE TERRIFYING!! But when you see slender on my kindle he is glitched and doesn't move until you look away but it is still worth the money!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Got this one for my new Kindle. This is a pretty good but not heavy read. If you're a fan of Grisham, you'll soon realize this is not his best work but a light, don't have to think too much about it afterwards book.If you're looking for something deep and/or a thriller type, this is not for you. I do wish he would write more deep thought provoking books like he has in the past, but there's a lot of fill in fluff in this one. One of the favorite books I have ever read in my life is his &#34;The Testament&#34;, wish he could come up with something again even close to it. I slightly stretched my stars to 4 because I really do enjoy his books but this is only slightly above average.
B00181JGI2|5.0|It's my favorite movie of all time. You can't go wrong with these characters. It's a cult classic for good reason.
B00B9LNJ9I|5.0|took a little getting used to , she has some rap going on  in a few songs ..but  not hard core ..it's actually a nice change for her  she still uses her incredible vocals to charm you into loving this album..she has  a way with  making you feel like you are transported into her sogs ...I really  do like this  change  a lot!
B00AB7HESI|3.0|I bought this game for $0.99 or 99 coins and after I finished the whole game it said &quot;0.99 for all future worlds&quot; . I was like &quot;So you're just paying , $1.98 or 198 coins for the whole thing&quot; and well I wasn't doing that, so I just paid $0.99 for the only worlds that they have now.
B00846REIS|4.0|I really enjoyed the story of two complex people struggling to survive what life threw at them. Can't wait to read the next book.
B005C0DHEY|5.0|Fracking is coming to my neighborhood and I am glad I watched this!  No amount of money is worth the impact that fracking has on our environment.  When one of the reps came to my house and wanted me to sign a contract, worth quite a bit of money, I asked him about the impact on the environment.  He told me there isn't any.  He lied!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Had fun with the kids.  Challenging, but solvable.  At first it seems hard because you aren't sure what to do, but clicking around and figuring out the puzzles is fun.  Love that there are some red herrings thrown in.  My 8 year old even is having fun doing some math, so bonus!
B00BTHWFHE|5.0|I'll make this brief, Thank God for Black Sabbath. This disc is fantastic, Buy it, listen and enjoy. It's worthy.\m/
B0046B8GEQ|3.0|I thought it was slow in the beginning.  Loved the little yellow guys!  You know what is going to happen but it is still fun.
159463176X|1.0|And the Mountains Echoed is a poorly constructed novel that lacks focus and is short on any impact for the reader.  What a sad fall from The Kite Runner.  Maybe Hosseini only had one great story?  I kept reading hoping that eventually some miraculous event would capture my interest and tie the whole mess together.  Rarely am I so tempted to give up on a book when I only have 50 pages left to wade through for a conclusion, but this book was one of those.  Another telltale symptom for me is when I lose my place and read at least 20 pages before I remember that I had already read that portion!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I love it when I was a kid and still do to this day and now its on blu-ray the picture quality is great
B0049J0CTM|5.0|Watched this movie while traveling with my granddaughter. She loved it!! She has seen it many times before and never tires of it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Even better than the first! Tons of action and discovery. Stories unravel ed and sides chosen. Couldn't put it down!
B0001WANCM|3.0|Haven't watched both discs, just the original movie.  Had never seen it before, good movie to add to your collection!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A graceful story. Lyrical and heartbreaking, it evokes nostalgia for a life not lived. Like the titular ocean, Gaiman's story is a masterful digression from the ordinary to the extraordinary and back in the blink of an eye. This is storytelling at its best.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book. A wonderful ending to a great story with such real characters. I hope you all enjoy all the books.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is Suzanne Collins at her best. Catching Fire is one of the best books I've read. Can't wait to see what she'll write next!
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This is the best game I have downloaded so far. It's crisp and very detailed amazing story plot. Keep up the good work.
B008XGW1CI|1.0|This book was not gripping at all.  I actually could not finish the book.  I received this book as a gift from a friend, due to my love for the Harry Potter series, however, I was left frustrated and let down.  I was 120 pages into the book before I decided to stop reading it, so I gave it a solid chance.  I just felt like the concept was great until I felt bored and wanting more.  The so called \\"Casual Vacancy\\" wasn't even addressed much in the pages that I did read and I felt that I was 120 pages into a book I knew nothing about.  I had no idea where this book was going or why I was even reading it.  I know there are readers out there that did like the book, but if you are a fan of Harry Potter and a fan of a book that gets you pumped up to read the next chapter then this book isn't probably for you.  I feel the need to share this with people, because one, I was excited to read this book and two, I hardly ever give up on a book...but unfortunately I had to on this =(
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I was looking for a game to play on my kindle and came across this me and my girlfriend downloaded it and already have multiple characters. It seems like a crawler that allows you to experience the game play from multiple view points in battle and the easy character switch option is amazing. I recommend connecting with Facebook and Twitter and playing multiplayer with friends.
B000FA675C|5.0|Wow a great read! Should have true impact on human culture..where we've been, the propaganda we've bought. Makes one believe maybe we don't have it right.....
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game has alot going for it. Great graphics. Simple gameplay. And it will definitely give you hours of excitement. I liked this game because it has really good multilayer (both local and online) and to progress you don't really have to spend any REAL money. Sure it's nice to upgrade all your weapons and armor with real bucks for diamonds but that takes out half of the fun. I've had this for a while (maybe a month or so) and even though I've gotten pretty far, I still find myself playing this game at least 4 times a day. Gameloft has done an amazing job with this. It is very well done.
B009NLC1D6|4.0|This is a movie for everyone, it was very informative and inspiring. I will recommend to my friends and family.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Love this game ! It's awesome an it keeps me pretty busy. It's cool that you can connect to Facebook.

0316247545|5.0|I absolutely loved this book. Being 18 years old, I thought it would be mentally demeaning to even look at it but it was not bad at all. The print was nice and all the ponies looked perfect. The interesting behind-the-scene things that were in there made it even better than I expected.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|This is well worth watching, even on a small screen. The Oscar nominations were all so well deserved. This film will haunt you after you've seen it.
098478280X|5.0|Everyone should at least read this book once before an interview, it will help. The quality of the book is very good
B004KPX4W2|5.0|One of those quiet evenings with nothing worth watching...when my lovely wife suggested 'Red.'  I had not heard of it.<br /><br />It was fun.  Action...seeing the old guys win...and just a fun movie.  If you have not seen this, you should.  The cast was great.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|loaded fast. no problems. This game is lots of fun!!! graphics are great.  Has lots of challenges to it. I love it!!
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|I originally bought this CD for my 11.5 year old daughter.  I love it so much (yes, a 47 year old mom) that I haven't listened to anything else at all in the last two weeks.  I really like BTR and they don't annoy me like some other boy bands!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Best game I've played on my kindle! Keep you entertained for hours! You will fall in love with your horse :)
B005HSL626|1.0|I actually uninstalled this app after all the grief it was giving me. It worked fine art first, but then it would freeze and get all glitchy and choppy and the fruit would fly on screen really slowly and when I swiped nothing would happen! ARGH! Then it refused to close and it would screw up my kindle or phone or whatever I was playing. Really obnoxious. Trying Fruit Slice.
B000FC1RCI|3.0|Typical Christie- more about the characters then a real mystery.  Not a page turner but worth reading. Recommended for those who need time to fill.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|What's not to love?  All 3 movies in one great collection!  My husband & I love watching them again, as much as my boys for the first time!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|My kids and I have fun figuring out the puzzles.  This is some thing for us to do together not just them playing something on their own!<br />I hope you have fun too...don't get discouraged...remember your math and math properties.  Ha e fun!

B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I don't really like reading review that are novels, so all I can say is: if you are a fan you will love the movies.  This was a Father's Day gift and my husband loved them.
B006X415GK|5.0|I like this doll because its hair and color are different. Monster high dolls have that particularity. I don't like the most of them, but this one a Draculaura are my favorites.
B002ECN4P0|5.0|I never thought I would get to listen to this when I wanted to again, so I am really enjoying this cd.  If you loved the Rolling Stones, you will like this too.  Great music.  Thank you for offering it.

B0059XTUVI|5.0|To bring Margartet Thatcher to the screen is an incredibly hard task, as usual Ms. Streep exceeded expectations.  Utter perfection, it does not get any better than this.
B0068FYZIO|5.0|This movie won top awards and for good reason.  It is an inspirational account of a man who made a difference in the lives of hundreds of people!  Movies like this, while though they have content that is sad and heartbreaking, are also deep motivators to others to give of themselves to impact the lives of others in a life giving way!  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves history, inspiring stories and heroic acts!!
B009ZZDNT6|1.0|Initially my security scan reported this app was okay. Today I was alerted that this APP now transmits email and personal information. App deleted.
B007G3H8Y0|4.0|What can I say? What a great band!!! they have they most fun songs that I love listening to-gotta figure the words out then I crack up ( the funny ones).<br />This band is different than what I usually listen to ( I am 57 yrs young) but I'm sure there is a genre of music fans that love this group!!<br />The more I play the songs the more I like them-I think they are a very talented band and sound great!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|U get to play with over 5 people it's amazing the graphics r amazing to I love it there is no bad stuff it's amazing.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|This is the version for adults/teens!!!! I loved the Snow White story as a kid and LOVE seeing it brought up to date with an amazing cast of actors!!!! I did not think I would like this movie, boy was I surprised-I cannot get enough of it!!! I watch it over and over!!!!<br />At first when I watched I kept trying to match it to the Disney cartoon characters and said where are they?  Then I realized they were the dwarfs etc!!!! It was so cool to see this version-Love it!!!!<br />Charlize Theron and Kristen Stewart and ALL the men actors were great!!! Love love love this ,movie!!!
0143119680|3.0|This is one of my favorite stories; however I was kind of disappointed in the condition of the book itself as the cover has been roughed up and some of the pages are wrinkled or stained.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and challenging. Keeps you coming back until you figure it out. Did it with my 6yr old daughter, we really enjoyed it.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Good case, better price.  Doesn't stand up well, but I don't really need it too.  The hard shell is nice since my kids use my Kindle.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|its a teaser game if you don't spend money it takes forever to get established. let alone waiting for builds of 18 to 24 hours
B001AQTWF2|4.0|I haven't listened to more than a few of these songs, but I still love her voice, and she could sing anything, and I will like it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a space western tv show that was cancelled partway through the first season, it's rather a stunningly quaint production as a whole. Thoroughly Enjoyable!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Just a great action movie.  Nothing missing...all good.  No corny lines or clichés.  Just fun! Just the thing to play when looking for some action.
B0055QYKQO|5.0|This is the best option for any builder who needs assurance that they get what they pay for( the good way). I installed an 8 core AMD fx 8350 4ghz and the bios gives me precise overclocking options for frequency and memory. I can overclock to 4.4, after that it has trouble. My installation was a bit shaky, but everything works great and I am satisfied.
B003FSTN52|5.0|This is one of the best series on TV.  A good look at Chicago politics.  Glad it is on Amazon prime.

B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I thought Delirium was dull in the beginning which I mean by the world was dull. Not the book. The middle was starting to get incredible and then the words amazing, beautiful, love, and overpowering just crashed into the ending. I think this book can easily be labeled with the rest of the best love stories of all time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Awesome book waiting for the next. If I could read all day it's all I would want to read love it.

B0093X805W|5.0|Every parent should read this story to their kids when they turn six. And every parent should video the moment when we learn who gets that final golden ticket. The excitement in that moment could be the very thing that defines childhood.

B003Y5D776|5.0|I needed a means to connect an old MD player to my computer and this is perfect.  I would recommend this product to anyone needing to transfer vinyl records from an old turntable, cassettes  or MD's to a computer or to ultimately burn a CD.
1932735410|4.0|Love this book - - great preparatory material. Well laid out, well presented with great exam type questions. Thank you to the editor!!
B008RA3X5E|3.0|I like the dimmer and the weather.  Although a weather prediction would be nice rather than just current.  Also, there is no easy button to turn off the alarm for the day if you wake up early.  I though shutting off the screen would do it but didn't.  Woke up my girlfriend while I was in the shower and she couldn't get it off.  So won't be using that again
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This book was captivating  and had a little twist at the end. The story was full of action and constantly had me trying to figure out if Jacob really committed the crime.. Would recommend!

B00CGPPMKU|4.0|In the hands of a skilled artist (not me), this could be a rather interesting tool.  In the hands of, well, anyone else, it is a fun, beautiful toy.  In a phrase: \\"Eye Candy\\".<br /><br />Flowpaper offers different settings, and the option to make your own \\"brush\\" comprised of a variable number of different color swatches.  Among other settings, there is the ability to choose \\"touch\\" or \\"continuous\\", which the latter continues the flow from the strokes.  In this setting, the image constantly evolves and flows following the stroke, which results in a hypnotic \\"dance\\" of colored lines.  The size of the stroke and the speed at which it was drawn influence the flowing lines greatly, so experimenting with the app yields an enjoyable, unique experience each time.<br /><br />There are three specific downsides to the app:<br />1: I had hoped for a much more \\"organic\\" feel to the rendered image; more like smoke, paint swirling in a glass jar, or wet paint flowing across a canvas.  Instead, the lines are geometric, forming like a flowing \\"fishing net\\".<br />2: Unable to save larger images of \\"continuous\\" mode.<br />3: Despite the recent removal of IAP, it still retains the permissions for the IAP.  I'm hoping this was simply an oversight and won't be added back again.<br /><br />I like the ability to save and share the resulting images.  Given the nature of the digital input, I'm hoping the developer considers recording the strokes of an image for import and export; recorded properly, it should be possible to replicate any image, even the \\"continuous\\" one.<br /><br />There's plenty of room for advancement and upgrade for this app, but in its current state it is definitely worth $2, and is certainly capable of becoming a 5-star app.<br /><br />[NOTE: Played on a 10\\" tablet with a good processor and memory.]

B008JGSM6G|4.0|I love this game. The first part is easy for s child. Then the other levels are harder for an adult. I can't get enough of this game.
B00B0X4PIO|3.0|A good book which tries to capture various forms of emotional bonding, but every relationship had a tragic end and that is kind of a put-off for me !
1603425381|5.0|Ms. Eckman is a true artist in crochet; she is also a wonderful teacher.  Her written words combine with the photographs to help the reader understand the practical application of so many wonderful ideas; one is left with a sense of excitement and fulfillment in understanding how yarns or threads, coupled with different stitch combinations, can work together to create a marvelous mosaic of riotous and compelling colors and textures.  I'll be eagerly watching for her next book--you can be sure I'll purchase and use it too!  Many thanks for a fantastic addition to my crochet library!
0385340990|5.0|This is a great summer read.  The writing was light-hearted but with substance and respect for the deeper topic. The topic of WW II and the German occupation and war atrocities was handled with respect and personalization that I appreciated.

B00C1BU7V8|4.0|I enjoyed watching Lincoln and admired the time it must have taken to learn their lines.  It is a movie that would not be for everyone, but I personally liked learning a little about the history of Lincoln and the 13th ammendment.

B0095GSKDE|5.0|Outliers does not disappoint;  Gladwell nails it as usual.  Anyone wanting to succeed at anything would do well to give this book a read.  Blink which is as excellent companion book, I have read several times.  This author is very good at helping the reader understand how and why what we do either succeeds or fails.  Both books get a 5 star!
B000HCO83Q|3.0|movie itself was just ok...I remembered it being better when I saw it in theaters I guess. If you want to complete your X-men collection, buy it, if not I wouldn't suggest it. This particular seller did great shipping out fast and in good condition though
B00005ATZT|5.0|The DVD came just as described, shipping was very fast, I have no complaints.  I would def order again. Thank you! This is a classic movie and one of harrison ford's best movies.

The many sweets are very good!  You will definately impress anyone you share your finished recipes with.

B00D5RME3G|2.0|Post-Harcore band Falling in Reverse attempt to be 'well rounded' you might say on 2013 effort [[ASIN:B00COQKE2M Fashionably Late (Deluxe Edition)]].  For the most part, there is nothing wrong with dabbling in pop, rap, and even country.  The problem comes when it just comes off as 'lame'.  'Lame' is too often the sentiment on Fashionably Late.  Too often the album is clunky and overwrought with one too many ideas or one dynamic level too much.  When frontman Ronnie Radke eschews the screamo (and rap most of the time), things tend to trend smoother.  Unfortunately, there is too much indulgent into both.<br /><br />\\"Champion\\" opens rather unimpressively, with the band quickly revealing 'every card in their deck'.  The front-half of the verses are heavily-forced scremo, while the second-half contrast with traditional 'melody.'  If that wasn't enough, the rap verse contrasts everything else, but not necessarily for the good of the track.  Sure, the chorus is positively themed (\\"I rise above it all and I'm not coming down... because a champion is what they call me now...\\"), but the cut itself is so-so.  \\"Bad Girls Club\\" is equally clumsy, if not more so.  Quirky, schmaltzy pop takes over, with the band trying to contrasts themselves with both edgier lyrical references and silly childish one (\\"ollie-ollie oxen free to all the bad girls...\\").  Potential lies within somewhere, but there is little motivation to unearth it.  Momentum shifts on back to back cuts \\"Rolling Stone\\" and title-track \\"Fashionably Late\\".  Neither are 'the second coming', but both seem to show more appeal and improvement over the ill-conceived opening duo.<br /><br />\\"Alone\\" proceeds, but the braggadocios  nature of the rapping seems to be empty of legit hip hop credentials (\\"...man I've been in rap since I was... in Pampers / Climb the ladder to the top  and now I'm... on rappers....\\").  The concept is better than the lyrics themselves, which does give \\"Alone\\" some redemption.  \\"Born To Lead\\" is better rounded, particularly the melodic portions as opposed to 'screamo.' Even so, the 'screamo' is used with more moderation here.  Again, the momentum takes a hit with \\"It's Over When It's Over\\" and generally the remained of the album.  \\"Game Over\\" manages to use some cool video game effects, but the comparison of real life to video games is a bit of an empty comparison.  \\"Self-Destruct Personality\\" is rightfully 'crazy', but that doesn't translate to a cohesive, enjoyable song in itself.  \\"...The Rest\\" basically finds Ronnie Radke not caring and neither does the listener... it's just 'so what?' basically.  \\"Keep Holding On\\" shows the pros about the band, mostly because of they rein themselves in.  Closer \\"Drifter\\" is a take it or leave it, depending on one's tastes.  On the one hand, it's country experimentalism is bold and admirable.  On the other hand, does it really work and why does a post-hardcore band need to go there?<br /><br />All-in-all, [[ASIN:B00COQKE2M Fashionably Late (Deluxe Edition)]] leaves more to be desired.  Falling in Reverse nearly 'plummet' on this album, trying to do 'too much' in one setting.  There are good moments as aforementioned, but none are atonement for all the miscues and improprieties unfortunately.  2 stars.er rounded, particularly the melodic portions as opposed to 'screamo.'

B00C9PQ7I8|4.0|You know what's sad? That more veteran, legendary artists don't receive their just due or rightful acclaim.  Sure, Mavis Staples is long past her prime, but the contralto's most recent album [[ASIN:B00C9PQ7I8 One True Vine]] is easily more well-rounded compared to albums by artists more than half-her age (74).  Staples may not 'let loose' as much as she has in the past, but One True Vine is another fine addition to a rich discography (particularly with The Staple Singers).  A tight ten songs at a brief 35 minutes, One True Vine packs a mighty, inspired punch.<br /><br />One True Vine opens with a relatively unknown, obscure number in  \\"Holy Ghost\\", a cover of indie-rock band Low.  Given spiritual, roots-driven nature of One True Vine, \\"Holy Ghost\\" is the perfect opener. Rather than receiving a truly rousing portrayal, \\"Holy Ghost\\" sort of 'breathes' on the listener, anointing with a quieter, more relaxed energy.  Jeff Tweedy original \\"Every Step\\" opens somewhat restrained, but constantly evolves including more instrumentation and accentuating backing vocalists. The results are nothing short of magnificent, as \\"Every Step\\" gives Staples a 'brand new classic' of sorts that should appeal equally to gospel and R&B audiences. Capping off the exceptional opening trio, Parliament gets fine treatment on cover \\"Can You Get To That\\", which Staples funkily tackles.  Solid production work by Tweedy certainly doesn't hurt either.<br /><br />\\"Jesus Wept\\" continues to showcase Staple's impressive vocals, age considered or not.  It runs a bit long, but the folksy, six-eight ballad still awes.  \\"Far Celestial Shore\\" contrasts, returning to a quicker tempo and more brevity.  On \\"What Are They Doing in Heaven\\" things slow once more, but not in a draggy sense.  Once more in a gospel-driven six-eight, Staples continues to both uplift the soul and make the listener reminisce back to old-school soul and Americana music.  \\"Sow Good Seeds\\" epitomizes 'old school', but it's message remains relevant and worthwhile.  \\"I Like the Things About Me\\" digs back to Staples' roots, covering The Staples Sisters soundly, much with the same vigor as the earlier \\"Can You Get To That\\".  Penultimate cut \\"Woke Up This Morning (With My Mind On Jesus)\\" gives the traditional  spiritual new life, while one last original, title-track \\"One True Vine\\", closes appropriately.  The sole quibble about the closer is the absence of backing vocals, which tend to add more 'spark' to the album throughout.<br /><br />Ultimately, Mavis Staples does her thing - and always has.  She electrifies most on the covers, but strength of \\"Every Step\\" can't be underwritten.  Other than a few minor rubs here and there, there is little to complain about.  Staples could've inserted more ad libs as opposed to remain married to the melody, but that is nitpicking by my estimations.  Anyone who is a fan of classic Americana, gospel, and soul should be pleased by this exceptional effort from one of music's living legends.  4 stars.elevant and worthwhile.  \\"I Like the Things About Me\\" digs back to Staples' roots, covering The Staples Sisters soundly, much with the same vigor as the earlier \\"Can You Get To That\\".

B002IEVZFK|5.0|Everyone has their own view of what real metal music is and what isn't. Everyone has their own opinion of each and every invention put forth into the world from all the bands who step up to the block when they do. In the end, we all agree on one simple thing within each of these attempts at holding up the name of our music...METAL. That thing is staying true to what metal is all about...the emotions within ourselves. Metal is all about releasing the feelings and emotions we hold inside and as a fan of this genre for many years I can say with no hesitation that this album holds true to the meaning of metal. Taking you on a ride through the insane world of ferocious riffs, dominating beats and taking control of your mind, heart and soul with powerful vocals, this band has achieved what many have failed to do. I applaud All That Remains for showing the world of music that metal is far from gone and never will depart. Surely, as expected, there are those who say that the metal of today is not true to the genre that we know from the beginning and through the years until now and that is true. Metal has changed shapes since the days of Sabbath's introduction into music, to the birth of thrash metal brought forth by bands like Judas Priest and Metallica, even into the low point of metal's existence that we know as hair-metal...such a shame, moving along into the next generation with the birth of the dark and horrifying tunes thrown in our faces by those like Marilyn Manson, Slipknot, System of A Down and all of the others that built the foundation for the sound of metal today. After all these years we can't deny that any changes in the sound and look of metal has still held true to it's nature, excluding hair-metal in the 80's and early 90's...such garbage still makes me sad. With all the bands we have seen over the years make their run at giving us more music to enjoy, there is one way to truly know if a band was successful in holding up the name of metal. What it is? Well, if you can remember a song that you heard years ago and can still listen to after all that time while enjoying your collection of metal...then that song is known only as metal.

B00AZM7IQC|4.0|As others have already said, the story is weak and this is a not so thinly veiled ad for vegas Cirque shows. That said, it is entertaining to a point for what it is. I've seen three different Cirque shows live and this 3D blu-ray doesn't measure up to actually being there and seeing it all for yourself but, it's a decent enough second. The first one I saw was Verakai and I think that may have spoiled me rotten because I saw Ka and O after that and neither was nearly as magical, mysterious, fun, inventive, creative or entertaining and neither is anything on this blu-ray. Nonetheless, as I said, it is still a bit of fun in 3D and the 3D is of really high quality. Probably as good as Avatar as far as the 3D quality goes. The music the shows presented isn't great either except for the Beatles stuff etc. If you're into 3D and this disc is on sale at or under $20 I say pick it up and experience it especially if you've never seen a Cirque show or at least Verakai.

B0053YGYO4|4.0|Okay, so after the departure that was Viva la Vida, we now have Mylo Xyloto. The albums tracks take time to love, but when you get into them, its hard to get out. Princess of China is the only track that I dislike, and on the whole, the entire album seems disjointed. But its a trip listening to it, and it almost always soars. A definite plus for any longtime fan, like me.

0316223239|1.0|As someone who suffers from dyslexia I try to read as much as I can to strengthen my mind. It takes a while for me to finish a book because I have trouble comprehending sentences, but when they're written in child speak with the intentional bad grammar and sentence structure I just can't work my mind through that; it's just too painful. I understand the authors intention but I only got two pages into this mess. I applaud those who finished it; you're stronger than me.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm glad I didn't trust those 1-3 star reviews. I throughly enjoyed this book! Gideon & Eva were once more at their finest with other little side stories becoming more apparent.

193700788X|1.0|I know authors retain the rights over their characters and their plots, they can determine how their vision will be in print. Readers can only voice their displeasure by not buying the book, or going on-line and interacting with other readers. I loved this series for years, but can not believe a few paragraphs suddenly change Sookie and Erik to Sookie and ___, so pathetic. I did not buy the book, but waited for the library copy. How sad. Still there may be hope in the fan fiction genre.

1781162646|3.0|I have read a lot of Stephen King books and this one is middle of the road for.  Easy read,  but takes till half way through the book to really get going.  Also not really much in the way of the ghost as to which the plot is set around.  Not a bad read but definitely not one of my favorite Stephen King books.
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|I remember watching this as a kid (my father put little restrictions on our tv). Even as young as I was, I fell in love with this movie. As the years have gone by, I have watched and re-watched it; and every time I watch it I feel the same love for the movie.
034580709X|3.0|I have been excited for so long to read a book by Jo Nesbo. I have come across a few of his works featuring the Norwegian detective of the Oslo Crime Squad, Harry Hole but I didn't read them because I hadn't acquired The Bat yet.  I've read reviews for The Snowman and Redbreast since they are two I have found in the local bookstore I frequent. Plans to collect more are on the horizon but for now, let's talk about The Bat.<br /><br />The Bat is Jo Nesbo's introduction of Harry Hole. Hole is called to Australia to sit on the sidelines and stay out of trouble during an investigation into the death of a minor Norwegian celebrity named Inger Holter. Holter is only 23 years old when her body is found by a fisherman on the ocean side of Watson's Bay. She is brutally killed and that's all I'll say about that.  It appears that she fits the mold for a serial killer who targets beautiful blondes and has been the cause of a string of similar murders across the country.<br /><br />During the course of the investigation, we see Hole battle with his own demons as well as fall for Birgitta, the victims sister. I liked this romantic element to Hole because for most of The Bat he just seemed like a guy going through the motions. We were never given much depth to his character. The only ideas that were supplied to readers initially is that he's a good looking blond guy. As the story develops, Hole does as well. I imagine in the later books he's featured in there will be more character development.<br /><br />As far as the writing and the plot goes, I think it's pretty solid. I didn't find the plot to be too thrilling in the sense that I was biting my nails from angst, but overall it is a very quick read. I devoured the first half of this book in a few hours. The true killer's identity was never something I expected and when once revealed it made perfect sense. Although the ending was very rushed, I do appreciate there wasn't an unnecessary moment in this novel. There was no meandering so pay attention.<br /><br />Although I would say that my first encounter with Jo Nesbo is average, I am still anxious to read the rest of his Harry Hole series. I recommend this novel to lovers of crime fiction or Scandinavian thrillers. Now on to the next...so pay attention.<br /><br />Although I would say that my first encounter with Jo Nesbo is average, I am still anxious to read the rest of his Harry Hole series.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|My Horse is a very fun and exciting game. It is an app to teach you how to take care of a horse. You also play games and compete with others to win medal and coins. You can also design your own horse and buy more horses. I recommend this app if you are an animal lover.

B00C70FH7M|5.0|So far, this is the best metal album of 2013. Without getting too in depth into the musicality of this record, and because if you're looking into this you probably already know TesseracT, you can sleep comfortably knowing that this is an incredible album. The harsh vocals are gone and, to be honest, I prefer Tesseract better this way. Their new singer absolutely slays and he works with the band more than any of their previous singers in my opinion. Is this as good as One? Every bit. Is it better? Only time will tell, but as of right now, I wouldn't be surprised. This is an album you listen to as one whole piece straight through, and that is the only way you can fully take advantage of the quality and musicianship of this record. If I could pull out any standout tracks, they would be Retrospect, Calabi-Yau (simply because of the beautiful saxophone solo), and Eclipse. Even still, every track is incredible and I have no doubt in my mind that this is the best metal release of 2013 so far with a high likelihood of being the best heavy progressive work of the whole year altogether. The only thing I can foresee potentially dethroning it is Karnivool's upcoming record Asymmetry, but that's more progressive rock, though without the harsh vocals and emphasis on groove as well as Karnivool's ability to blur the lines between hard rock and metal, I wouldn't feel out of line putting the two on similar plains.<br /><br />Long story short, this is an incredible album. The guitar work is stellar, the bass is driving and groovy, and the drumming simply adds a wonderful dynamic layer that I haven't heard in a long time. An absolute masterpiece of the progressive metal genre and a definite favorite of mine. Pick this album up, you won't be disappointed.

1433203316|5.0|A plague has swept the planet, spread by mosquitoes and freak dust storms.  The plague infects everyone it touches, either killing them or turning them into blood-sucking vampires.  In fact, it seems that only one man, Robert Neville, is immune.  Robert leads a nightmare existence.  By day, he goes hunting, finding the vampires in their various hiding places and driving stakes through their hearts.  By night, he must barricade himself inside his house, protected by crosses and strings of garlic.<br /><br />Robert knows this can't go on forever so he begins to educate himself.  Studying and experimenting to learn the nature of the plague, in a vain hope of finding a cure.  But what he discovers terrifies him even more.  It turns out the plague has created not one race of monsters, but two.  The first, a breed of mindless zombies, he can deal with, but the second group, a new breed, can think and reason, making them all the more dangerous.  Soon, the hunter becomes the hunted.<br /><br />I don't typically enjoy vampire stories, but I Am Legend is not a typical vampire story.  Imagine being the last person alive in an entire city, an entire planet, of the undead.  Creepy!<br /><br />I love how Matheson twists this around.  Neville feels like the last island of sanity in a sea of monsters, but how do the \\"monsters\\" feel about him?  In their eyes, they are trying to build a new world, and it is Robert Neville who is the monster, slaying dozens of them each day.  It's all about perspective.  We always look at ourselves as the good guys, the heroes.  But how do others see us?  Some great food for thought here.<br /><br />No I didn't put in Robertson Dean's name backwards, it really is Robertson Dean.  His reading of I Am Legend was very good.  He reads with passion and emotion, and he has kind of a dark, gritty voice that suits this audiobook nicely.  In a way, his voice reminds me of Stefan Rudnicki, which is high praise indeed.<br /><br />Lovers of vampire stories may not enjoy I Am Legend because, like I said, these are not your typical vampires.  I do, however, think this audiobook will appeal to science fiction or horror readers.  And for those of you who are crazy about zombies, as seems the whole world is these days, this golden oldie fits the genre well.<br /><br />FILM ADAPTATION: I Am Legend has spawned three films since its original publication in 1954.  My favorite of the three is the classic 1964 black and white titled \\"The Last Man On Earth\\" starring Vincent Price.  I highly recommend this film if you can get your hands on it.<br /><br />Also of note is the most recent adaptation, 2007's \\"I Am Legend\\" starring Will Smith.  If you are one of the two people in the world who haven't seen this yet I hightly recommend this one as well.  It's a very well done movie that stuck reasonably close to Matheson's original story, up until the end anyway.  I think this was one of Will Smith's best performances.  By the way, to all you publishers, we hate it when you use a movie poster for the cover of a book when the book came first.  Especially a classic old book like I Am Legend.t enjoy I Am Legend because, like I said, these are not your typical vampires.

B007MDB71O|5.0|I didn't really know a thing about this story or all the books written about it, save a few badly done &#34;Princess of Mars&#34; type movies on different TV channels.<br /><br />I didn't recognize anyone in movie except the 7th Calvary Colonel (OK, I'm over 60) but maybe that helped to make this movie so good. No preconceived expectations besides that of my brother telling me the story line and that it was written about 100 years ago.<br /><br />The CG graphics were fantastic on Blu-ray so that just made the photography even better. I bought a used copy and got quality for my money.

0143122010|3.0|Mr Pinker has done a great service with his book. His thesis is that violence has decreased over time and that we now find ourselves living in a more peaceful time that ever. This is a worthy thought, worth thinking about but I think I disagree.<br /><br />Does that go against your own perceptions? What I see is more and more violence everywhere I look. So how does he square this circle?<br /><br />Easy, he divides by population. He does not say there is less violence, but that the RATE of violent death is decreasing. He uses the statistic of homicides per 100,000 pop. Since our population is increasing, rates of violent death seem to be decreasing.<br /><br />I have been searching for a good analogy and landed on emissions. Vehicle emission rates have fallen steadily, our cars are cleaner than ever, safer, and we are even driving fewer miles per car, too. However the number of vehicles on the road has increased as well, so that total emissions worldwide continue to grow.<br /><br />Thus it is with homicide rates. The killings increase but the rate decreases. Before I change the subject to global war, let me note that Pinker uses 1/100,000 as about the best that has been so far achieved, 1 homicide per 100,000. However I just read in Sunday's NY Times that the suicide rate in the US approaches 10-13 per hundred thousand and that among veterans it is above 20. That seems high to me but look what it does to Pinker's figures. Add them in and we're nowhere near so peaceful it seemed a minute ago.<br /><br />Pinker seems to treat global war as a thing of the past. He should read Paul Kennedy. Since WWII the Great Powers have fought many wars, mostly little but some not so little, like Vietnam. What has not happened is a war between Great Powers and most especially, coalitions of Great Powers. It is a virtual certainty that this will occur again, sometime.<br /><br />In 1915 it had been a century since the last war between coalitions of Great Powers. In that time the consequences had dimmed in our memories. Europe went to war with great enthusiasm in 1915. In 1939 there was no flag waving, they knew what was coming.<br /><br />This is where we stand. It has been over 50 years since WWII ended and we avoided WWIII with Russia and so now Pinker asks, who is there left to fight? We don't know but one plausible scenario is USA versus the rest of the world. Sooner or later something will happen to get that ball rolling and the rest of the world will realize it is too dangerous for one country to become so dominant militarily.<br /><br />But it doesn't matter. The next Great Power war featuring coalitions will end with nuclear weapons being used. When it is over I think we'll see Professor Pinker was mistaken.<br /><br />Edit 6/14: My views grow more nuanced with time. Please see the comments below.equences had dimmed in our memories.

So I ordered and read &#34;The Shining&#34; and understand why I didn't remember it; hadn't read it at all!<br /><br />A very enjoyable ghost story/haunted house story. The &#34;old&#34; Stephen King with plenty of horror, slow boiling terror and an unlikely hero.  This was a very good summer read.

B006LSZECO|3.0|The book was  magnificent. I was so I to it I couldn't pit it down. The end stank like hot garbage. It was almost as if the writer pit so much into building the story that by the finish she was over it. Like that it literally just ended. Abruptly. If this were a series I might be able to understand however the lack of any acceptable ending made me feel word  then if the whole book was terrible. I have already purchased of her previous books however I might not even open the covers after this. I recommended this book to many when I was still in the middle; when it was good. I will be finding this  people and retracting my statement. Too bad too because  the book showed thalidomide.

I guess somethings are universal and timeless.<br /><br />It was difficult not to do a &#34;Daria&#34; marathon and watch one after the other continuously. My son and I failed at that and did do a marathon.
B007C3TVNA|4.0|I find it very ironic that some reviewers of both film and book who \\"didn't like it\\" because they found Eva unsympathetic when one major theme is Kevin's \\"lack of empathy\\" for others.  Astonishingly, they seem to be aligning themselves with Kevin.  I felt even more sympathy for Eva in the film because she can sometimes be smart ass as a narrator in the novel.  That said, the novel is much stronger because, again ironically, the child actors are so good that they make clear that Kevin is deeply disturbed from the beginning.  Viewing him through Eva's first-person narration makes his child character much more ambiguous than seeing them enact him on the screen.
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|I have been looking for a free replacement for luminosity. Though it's not quite the same it is a good suppliment. Thanks for the app
B009MO5E10|5.0|Cool movie, I love bicycles and this movie shows the new style of fixie bikes.  The digital copy is kind of interesting.

0064404994|3.0|I liked it. It was good. It made me want to eat Turkish Delight...whatever that is. Poor Mr. Tumnus. I felt bad for him when he was frozed.
0553386794|4.0|I bought this book because I like to read the book before seeing the movie or show.  I find it very detailed with a multitude of subplots.<br />I have been told the TV series was very R and I would not like.  Although I am confused in the book, I have to read it carefully to figure out what is going on.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Looking toward to the next episode from this series.  Kept Me busy when candy crushed frustrated me. As good as the hidden object/mystery game genre gets!
B001L5YW9I|4.0|I cover the French and Indian War in the class I teach.  I use snipets of this video to make various points.  It works well for melding my teaching needs with student interest.

B009KS4XRO|1.0|game is a lot of fun but the service is horrible. bought coins and never received support does nothing to make right, keep getting canned e-mail.
B00CA4S27W|5.0|This album is every bit as good as the past albums.  The one big difference is \\"Dancer and the Moon\\" is much more electric/electronic than their previous albums.  There is still plenty of acoustic guitar, flute, mandolin etc. but they definitely added to the power bill on this one.  They cover yet another Rainbow song...The epic \\"Temple of the King.\\" Nobody can sing it with the intensity of RJD but it is an excellent version.  Another cover is \\"Lady in Black\\" by Uriah Heep another very good effort.  The rest of the album just kicks @$$! You are either a fan or you're not.  If you love Blackmore's guitar and Night's vocals just buy the album already, it's freaking good.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|already love hidden object games but this is next level hidden object love this room escape hope they make more like this
B0032BMTCQ|5.0|I usually have to go up a size larger to find bibs that fit my slightly (and I do mean slightly) bigger bum and thighs leaving me with bibs that have loose straps and long legs. The Gore Ozon's are the best fitting, most comfortable shorts I've ever used, everything is just right. Can't compare them to Assos, Rapha, and other $200+ high end bibs since I've never used them but have had various brands in this price range that were not as comfortable or durable. These use a med. weight material and thinner type chamois, are very well constructed and seem to last a long time. Use the size chart from Gore's own website for more accurate sizing as these run on the small side. I usually wear a large in most brands but the Ozon's XL fit me perfectly. I've purchased two of these bibs about a year apart and noticed the older ones have legs that are about an inch shorter than the norm but the most recent pair is identical in every way except the legs are one inch longer than the other pair so you may want to check the length before ordering.
B00CWY76CC|1.0|so i bought this and had fun until level seven. no matter what i pressed the app did not work. something was messed up. waste of time and space DELETE
B0089LOG02|4.0|This is so interesting.  Like most people, I did not know this sort of thing was going on.  I'm sure a lot of people thought they were helping the children, that they would be placed in good homes, be provided for and go to school.  Once they boarded the train=Out of sight, out of mind.<br />I like the way the story was told with the old lady and the young girl.  They broke down each other's walls.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Love love love this app<br />its always helpfull when its charging so I know hoe much battery I have when I want to go on to it<br />thank you amazon!!!!!!! &lt;3
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book is an intimate look into the emotional and physical lives of teen cancer victims.  The writing and insight are exceptional.  One can't help being drawn into the triumphs and tragedies of the characters.  It is an exceptional read.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|The app loaded quickly with no problems opening but I didn't see any help or descriptions about what to do. After tapping icons to see what each did I found the brush options but again no details so its pretty much try each one and see how they work. It has options for flow and you must be lite handed. I do not know anything about drawing shading or etc so I was unable to really create much. I wish I knew more because it seems lovely art could be achieved easily if you do know. For ex: the sample image of the fish is stunning!<br />As free app of day its worth a Doodle.<br />Enjoy!  Floridamom - April
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Stephen King is obviously a great writer, he could write about an accountant's life at tax time and it would still be interesting.

B00CB4ET0K|4.0|Fun game so far I'm early into it but it plays well on the kindle. I would recommend it but like I said it's early. As always fly games are good but may require in game purchase to complete

B00A83075M|4.0|This movie was exactly what we thought it would be and exactly what the kids wanted and told me they wanted but I got it for simply the reason that it was an Easter gift without sugar.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|This Psy-Changeling series is one of my all time favorites and Heart of Obsidian is no exception.  I absolutely LOVE the Snow Dancer pack and was skeptical about how interesting a story about 2 Psy could be. Nalini really delivered on this story and I couldn't put the book down.  Really enjoyed it!
B005LAIIFS|2.0|UMMM the movie was what they wanted since they asked for it and what we expected.  The eggs were broken and my kids felt bad I had spent money on them since they were broken.
B0071NLG0W|5.0|I laughed hysterically at some of the situations!  I got angry at the diabolical characters evil plans. I fell in love with Brad and Amber and was frustrated at her when she stalled.I was frightened by the VOODOO. I cried when Brad was Ill. The whole series is a great buy and \\"VOODOO Deadly\\" brings this trio of books to a fantastic conclusion.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun game for kids and it teaches my neices to take care of a horse so they can help me with mine
B00BD05PEW|5.0|I have become quite the fan of Papo's dinosaur offerings, mostly due to my four-year-old son's fascination with all things prehistoric. The Carnotaurus, mistakenly labeled \\"Carnosaurus\\" in the Papo catalog, is yet another fine example of the quality work produced by the French company and manufactured in China. Notable to all Papo dinosaurs is the level of detailed afforded by the handpainting. As a former enthusiastic model builder and sculptor, I readily recognize the time and effort it takes to produce the color coordination and layering, especially for an item destined for a child's toy box, and it's a fantastic blend of paleontological research and artistic license. The sculpting is what makes the Carnotaurus come alive, however, with the head dipped down in a charge, the body and tail twisted in a subtle, serpentine motion, the miniscule forelimbs dropped back alongside the body, and the powerful legs tensed as they push the creature to the right. The lower jaw is hinged, if an open-mouthed charge is preferred; although the hinge and friction fit is a rather weak connection, so that rough handling could cause the jaw to break loose, my son's Carnotaurus has survived over two month's worth of daily play without notable wear, which again speaks to Papo's use of quality materials and paints. While other reviewers grumbled over the size of the Carnotaurus, 7 1/4 inches long, 4 1/2 inches high, with the beast's eye level positioned 2 inches off the deck, it is roughly to scale with Papo's other theropod offerings, including Allosaurus and Tyrannosaurus Rex, perfectly illustrating the size difference of the top-tier predators of the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods. Carnotaurus is not to scale with other Papo items, however, but only a loon would mix the Neanderthal together with a dinosaur, and a child's imagination carries no such intellectual prejudice at playtime. At $25, Carnotaurus is not cheap, and it's not supposed to be, but it is a worthwhile addition to any collection and suitable for children's hands or an adult's fascination.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game. :) It's good challenge game to play. Great game for anyone to play. I would recommend this game to my family and friends to play this game.

B003EI2EH2|5.0|I know I bought this book so long ago, but I've only read the chapters regarding Fat-loss, as he instructed to read only what is applicable and not the whole book like a novel. I will look at the incredible sex and other chapters every once in a while, and frankly speaking they are all very VERY useful, relatable, and also well fact-checked.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game! Awesome app. Don't even hesitate to download because it is hours of fun!!! I spend hours playing ky and its cool how it goes to places around bthe world!!!

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I like this app, it simple and easy. I am glad that Facebook is available on kindle fire, now all they need to add is Facebook messenger. I still can't believe that it's not here. But then again, there is a lot of apps that kindle fire still lacks versus the iPad, which sucks. But other than that, good app.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Being a completest you have to have this well presented package. And the value of the whole presentation makes it worthwhile.

B000FC146C|4.0|I'd heard of the Thorn Birds as a mini-series many  years ago.  I didn't see the mini-series at that time and so I was just a bit curious about it when I saw the book offered on Kindle.  I did enjoy the book, but I didn't find it the kind of book that I couldn't put down.  However it is a very enjoyable book.

B00571F26Y|5.0|Dr. Davis has shared his medical wisdom to expose wheat and its untoward effects on the human body. He has brilliantly supported his approach with plenty of research and is truly a medical pioneer way beyond his fellow colleagues. Dr. Davis is way ahead of his time and courageously branches off from the missteps of agricultural and pharmaceutical mistakes. Thank God I am free from engineered dwarf wheat and am enjoying real food. Thanks so much Dr. Davis!
B000MKD9P6|5.0|Love the clothes, love the story, love Streep, Tucci and Blunt!!! So funny and fun to watch! Will watch it again!
B0099G6Q5E|3.0|For the riff out and the part of soundtrack that there was a smorgasbord of music they should have incorporated the full song at the end of the CD- call it a bonus if you want BUT I would have loved to hear the entire piece.

B004J88SGC|5.0|very well done with Billy's band and guests, if you are a big fan of Billy Joel, add this to your collection
B006N0YWGY|5.0|After reading the reviews, I was skeptical about downloading this game because of questionable reviews on the controls.  I downloaded it anyway as the Amazon free app of track day.  I immediately changed the controls to the tilt feature ofmy phone and started a game.  It was very difficult at first, but subsequent games have improved my skill level, and by far this game is the best game I have ever players in the Android platform.  It is a true arcade game in my cell phone.<br /><br />Buy this game.  Play it a few times.  Get acquainted with steering and the overall strategy of the game.  You will become a fanatic, as I am.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It doesn't bother me to buy another book.  I enjoy it as much as a nice dinner out and it certainly lasts much longer than a dinner.  I spend more for a glass of wine than I do for a book so I am certainly ok with another book.<br /><br />So, I love Gideon (Ace) & Eva (Angel) for sure. The pull between these 2 damaged lovers is hard to forget and easy to get lost in.<br /><br />From the moment I first saw him--saw through his stunning and impossibly gorgeous exterior to the dark and dangerous man inside--I'd felt the pull that came from finding the other half of myself.<br /><br />Even though he stood several feet away, I could feel the heady attraction, the magnetic pull of being near the other half of my soul<br /><br />Gideon will do anything for the love of his life Eva.<br /><br />\\"You're a soft, delicious little handful, angel.\\"<br /><br />The love & the lust that they felt for each other was so hard to miss.<br />\\"I wish I needed you a little less. Just enough to make it bearable.\\"<br /><br />The physical attraction between the two of them are what dreams are made of. Dreams where you wake up & wish you could go back to sleep and be in that place again feeling everything all over again and hoping when you wake up, this time it will be real.<br /><br />He always checked to see where my head was at before he took over my body.<br /><br />He was good at taking over Eva's body. But Eva<br />The story really unfolds and answers things that happened in the first 2 book that I though really didn't need answering. I guess I was happy with where my imagination went at that time. It was genius the way the author took simple scenes and brought them back around in book 3. I guess she left enough to our imagination in book 1 & 2 for us to come to our own conclusions. I really enjoyed how by tying up these not so loose ends added to the depth of the book. It made things right.<br /><br />The way Gideon & Eva stayed connected through all of the troubles made my heart swell. They couldn't stay away from each other. They need each other to breath.<br /><br />We'd mistaken our ferocious mutual captivation for lust until we realized we couldn't breathe without each other.<br /><br />I can't wait for the next installment of this series. I feel lost without them.<br /><br />New twists and turns have been added to the series, new characters and new plots. Looking forward to how it unfolds.

B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is addictive. Once you start you can't stop. Each new Dragon you have makes you want more and more. I love it. My only complaint, you download a free app but to play the game properly you end up spending spending money to buy what you need. If your not careful it can get expensive.
B00DEG4Z1W|2.0|You only get 2 people and 8-10colors<br />the others you have to pay  for. It  makes  me<br />Really mad<br />E

B00464AVXW|4.0|This is an awesome movie.  Bt is great in it as the inexperienced yet cocky detective and Freeman shows that the changing of the guard is difficult especially when you are on a difficult case.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|While I love this movie (and so does my fiancé), when the package came in the mail, the movie box was cracked a little bit. However, this is not a big deal so it is perfectly fine.

B00B7PIRIE|5.0|Great production, excelent theme, wonderful performances. Highly recommended. All 3 seasons make a perfect package for an extremely reasonable price.
B00DC7N9NS|1.0|I'm sorry, the original movie was in a word, captivating. This pre quel to the first ever color movie, was in a word, boring.  Mila, wrong. Michelle, no, no. James, his worst film.  Although Zach did a God job with what he had to work with,  digital side kicks can be to modern, and cheesy. The witches were not scary, nor were her baboons.  I was terrified of both in the original.  Sorry Disney.  PLEASE leave you other greats alone. They are still great.  're release them in theater's. I'd go see most of them.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was very amused by this game. I found it both challenging and enjoyable. It makes you think and works your brain a bit more than the average game. This is an amazing game that I find to be an excellent game!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I've used this on iPod, iPhone, and kindle and I just love it. Only reason it is a four-star review is because my horse is now forever named Beauty because it was not clear on how to name him/her at the beginning of the game. :)
B00AS1Q8FW|2.0|Another movie with tom cruise playing the same character, the plot drags on for what seems like an eternity. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, TC is past his prime.
B00466HM28|1.0|I chose to rate this as I hate it because it is nothing like it was described in the summary. I have had it almost a month and still haven't been able to figure out how to work it properly. It said the set-up was very easy and worked with any program. I have Fruity Loops 10 Producer Edition and it is impossible to use all the pad banks or just even record the keyboard playing. The software that came with it does nothing to explain the product or how to get it set-up properly. It also didn't even explain each button and its use. I was very disappointed with this product and sincerely regret buying it. However, it does looks neat with all of my equipment, so that is the reason I haven't returned it. Thanks for letting me give my input.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Your Customer
B004MC8CA2|5.0|There aren't any other book that can even compete with this one.  It is a guideline, a comfort, a blessing and a refuge at any time of your life.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Easily 5 stars this is my favorite game on the Appstore this is the best game everyone should buy it it's worth 2 dollars
B00A757EFW|3.0|I thought this would be a fun game from the past but playing it on the kindle was slow going.  I would enjoy it alot more if the came had a faster pase.  Maybe the pase WAS fast enough but playing touch screen seem to have slow reaction time on the game board.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I like to . Pop the balloons with my monkey's  I got a new monkey engineer is awesome  I could unlock cool stuff
B007PKDW44|5.0|Really good. Came early which was nice. All the songs are 4 or 5 stars. My favorite songs on it are heavan nor hell, fallen, 7 shots, mirror and the reaper, being 1 still counting.

B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Great series and the last book did not let me down. Lots of twists and turns and some major characters did not make it to the end, which is good as well but all in all worth the read and as pleased as i was with the book I am sad knowing that there will never be another, but you never know what the wheel wills ;-)
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I don't get all the reviews with the permission issues. I didn't see any of that stuff requested nor was I prompted to pay for anything either.<br />I give this a full five stars unless other information comes to light.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|I walked into a burning store to buy this book when it was first published and it's still one of the finest books I have ever read. Dee Brown was an amazing story teller and he opens your eyes up to American History from the native peoples side of things. Do yourself a favor and read everything he has ever written.
1781162646|4.0|Love to read Steven King in  the Carrie, the Shining horror suspense type novels. Unfortunatey his pulp fiction effort was not up to his usual  standards, but still an easy fun read - after all he is still one of the greats.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|All four movies were awesome in Blu-Ray clarity and sound. Really like the booklet style sleeves that the discs come in, but you have to be careful getting them out so that you don't scratch them. No biggie if you're careful though.
B0094M2SCI|5.0|Just great, vampires lycans etc one cant go bad with a great plot, raging action and kate's performance. A must see

B004GJYROG|5.0|I love this movie. Im a huge nba fan and who dont love bugs and the gang. And if you dont like either of those BILL MURRAY IS ALSO IN IT. Its a must have for any collection.

B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|It seems like Disney has been lacking for years now in bringing in a fresh story. They need to make more movies like this. Great for adults and kids alike.
B00957T6X6|5.0|I loved the TV series and I know it is not over yet, but I had to get the books to see what was left out. Great!!!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|You can predict there will be a &#34;twist ending,&#34; which prevents it from being truly shocking, and some of the plot lines get a bit confused. But it's intriguing at first before you begin to guess where it's going, and it was entertaining enough. Jude Law's acting is good/believable, but the female leads are a little over the top. It brings up some ethical dilemmas in the psychiatric treatment world, and it was better than most psychological dramas out there. Worth seeing.
142314189X|4.0|In Percy Jackson and the Olympians, author Rick Riordan creates a fascinating world packed with exciting adventures, intense action scenes, and Greek mythology. I salute Riordan for creating an exciting, yet deep series. This book came extremely close to getting a five star review, but a few things held me back.<br />PLOT<br />This was one of the few aggravating issues I have with this series. Being an enormous fan of fantasy myself, it wasn't long before I started to see some similarities between the first book in this series and the first book in another famous fantasy series. Let me describe both of the books, and try to figure out The Lightning Theif's counterpart.<br />Our story begins with a young boy, who is seemingly very ordinary, who goes to an ordinary school, with at least one very ordinary parent. One day, a mysterious man reveals his identity to him, and at first he doesn't believe it. Soon, the boy starts to accept that he is special, and goes to a place like a school for other kids who have similar powers. At this place, this child meets many friends, like a very smart girl, and a mediocre boy that is very sacrificial and has known his true identity since he was born. He also meets a wise old man who knows something important about this boy that will happen to him later in life, but isnt letting on. But something isn't right. An important artifact that could do something terrible to society as we know it is in danger! So this boy and his two friends must embark on a quest to save this artifact before it is too late. At the grand climax, this boy must single-handedly battle an enemy that had plotted everything all along. He wins just in time and returns showered in fame.<br />In case you hadn't noticed already, the second book is Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone. Although Riordan seems to branch out in his later books, many small Harry Potter references are abundant. Grade: B-<br />CHARACTERS<br />Again, many are copied from Harry Potter. But as far as I can see, he develops them nicely, and dispite the few copied characters, I have to give Riordans characters an A.<br />WRITING STYLE<br />Riordan is humorous, descriptive, exhilarating, and unlike many popular teen authors, (nudge Stephanie Meyer) knows what a thesaurus is. This book belongs in the top ten for writing style. A+<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book and most certainly reccomend it to young readers. If only Riordan had branched out and not copied Harry Potter as much, this book would have gotten five stars. As it is, I am perfectly comfortable giving it four because of his sub-optimal plot imagination.
B003Q6D2B4|3.0|Not good enough for anyone of these actors! Don't care for this movie! I would not have done this movie if I was anyone of this actors!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I'm the type that likes to read the book before the movie as the movie usually does the book NO JUSTICE.<br />Flew through this in a 3 days and was very into this book!  Loved it!
078322611X|5.0|I loved seeing and hearing Burt Lancaster again! Kevin, Amy, little girl(name?),James Earl Jones and the others made the movie great!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Game is addictive and fun. My only worry is that I will soon run out of maps to play. Definite download.
B004SIP7VM|4.0|This was interesting but I don't enjoy seeing and hearing the worst side of human behavior. We have more than enough corruption for real in our lives in the USA.
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|It kept me up late turning more pages!<br />It kept me in suspense with just enough information but not spelling things out too plainly.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Robert and Jude are wonderfully suited for the parts! Rachel McAdams is perfect in her role!! The Evil Lord Blackwood was a perfect character for Sherlock Holmes to battle with!
B00966TN1Q|5.0|Michael Conneely gives us another action packed book full of suspense and intrigue. A great plot and Harry doesn't disappoint his readers and fans.
B002UZCJ8Y|5.0|Really Great Plot and Great acting from All the people playing their roles! Great Directing! Held my attention all the way thru!
B009ZW9DU2|5.0|Thanks James for brightening my life with your warm tale of your new life with Bob.  Bob only allowed you to find what was already inside of you, your own humanity, or catanity, whichever term suits you best!  Thanks!!!!
B0069UP2PI|4.0|Kate Winslet, Laurence Fishburne, Jude Law and the other actress/actors played their characters very well and made the plot very believeable.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|The perfect sequel to Temple Run with great new features that make it really exciting. Great game for the iPhone though a bit demanding cause of the graphics. Need a 4s at least to run it properly.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|Angelina Jolie really preformed Great and all of the work that she did would have killed me if I had to do it!! I hope that she was not hurt in those fighting scenes! Excellent plot and holds your attention to the end!!
1449325947|5.0|This is not an encyclopedia of CSS; it's a primer on how to use it effectively. It has helped me better understand how to approach problems from a CSS perspective, and I can use a search engine if I need to find some specific syntax.

1400052181|5.0|WOW!  Kudos to Rebecca Skloot for this labor of love on research of the HeLa cells and her presentation of the Lacks Family to the world.  This book blew me away, had me hooked, I laughed, I shed some tears, and my heart goes out to the Lacks Family for all the tragedy they have endured.  The author must be a super special lady because most authors would have not completed this project due to all the adversity and road blocks.  She went above and beyond the norm to ensure that all medical, scientific, historical, photos, and oral family history were fact checked over and over again for accuracy.<br /><br />Most everyone who has studied science or biology has heard of the HeLa cells.  Some like myself may not have known that the He (Henrietta) La (Lacks) cells came from a black woman who had cervical cancer and that her cells were taken without her permission/understanding that they would be used for various research and make a lot of people rich, all while her family was poor and did not even have health insurance.  \\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" puts a face to the cells and reveals all the trials and tribulations that the Lacks family endured before and after finding out the truth about the cells.  The family in my opinion should have been compensated.  So much money has been made off of the HeLa cells that if money had been given to the family...the rich deep pockets would never have missed the money.<br /><br />This book was a New York Times Bestseller rightfully so.  I highly recommend this book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book grabbed my attention right off... a great book with good character s... even though I thought fifty shades was just that, plus I think he is kind of a jerk... I still think it's a great book... now on to book two
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love it. I've been looking for a game like this for along time and I am so glad I finally found one. w

B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Brings back memories of first love so deep it hurts. Definitely for older teens due to bad language and mature themes.
B000R5OGF8|5.0|To me this is one of the best movies That Schwarzenegger maid. The movie had a all star cast. The Laser disc very excellent.
0891419063|5.0|This is one of the best memoirs I have ever read.  With The Old Breed is not a book I would usually pick to read.  I usually do not read war stories but I did have family members in the Marines at Okinawa and Saipan.  I think this is what pulled me to it and I am so glad it did.  The book is so exceptional in its direct honesty, brave in what he is not afraid to<br />tell, I felt I was there with him from beginning to end.  I could not stop reading and this is one of those books that sticks with you.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is like temple run with shooting in it.. it has really good graphics and awesome suites.. which if you combine make a really good and fun game.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|the story is very plain and its not what I expected it to be like. Good book for twenty yr olds
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I'm sorry, Tolkien, Martin, and Jordan. Rothfuss's first novel, in addition to having an incredibly compelling protagonist and plotline, is absolutely beautifully written.<br /><br />I've purchased the e-book version of this to send to friends. Do yourself a favor: stop reading reviews and buy the book.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Out of all the shows around this one is the cutest and funniest.  The writers have great imagination!<br />Cute show
B00AFEXRME|5.0|In \\"Flight\\" when John Goodman's drug dealer enters the picture he's accompanied on the soundtrack with the Rolling Stones' \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\".  This theme could very well be the theme for airline pilot Whip Whitaker(Denzel Washington).  There isn't a controlled substance Whitaker doesn't like.  He's even prone to sniffing oxygen before takeoff.  On a routine flight form Orlando and Atlanta a midair accident occurs.  More than likely it's due to mechanical failure.  Regardless, despite his inebriated state Whitaker lands the plane with only four casualties among the hundred people aboard.  Despite his heroics questions will inevitably be asked.  That's okay because Whitaker has any number of enablers.  Toxicology reports?  Quash them.  While you're at it attribute the two empty liquor bottles to the dead flight attendant.  Everybody is willing to make Whitaker a hero but can he face himself in the mirror?  From beginning to end \\"Flight\\" is a fascinating character study.  Whitaker is probably one of the more interesting characters you'll encounter in any film.  Washington ingeniously enacts his complexities to make him sympathetic to the audience.  \\"Flight\\" is one the best films of last year or any year.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|This a great remake of the original. I bought one for my family and one for my dad for fathers day, he is a &#34;Trekky&#34; fan, and he loved the film also.
1451695195|5.0|I loved that this was from a neurosurgeon's point of view.... a \\"non-believing\\" neurosurgeon no less! He was one of those who believed that after-death experiences were no more that the final firing of brain cells as they were \\"shutting off.\\" Now he knows better. Great story!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|We didn't know about Rodriguez until we were sent this as a gift.  Now we too are sending it as a gift to others.  This man sings wonderfully well and deserves so much more recognition.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|this is a very good app but takes a insane amount of time to load on the kindle fire hd
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|Shame on you Sylvia! I absolutely LOVED the first two books and couldn't wait to have it all explained and resolved. I made the mistake of not reading any reviews before hungrily attacking the \\"last\\" book in this \\"trilogy\\"! When I was done, I was angry, frustrated and disappointed. It was just fluff, drawn out and BORING, and then I was left hanging. Nothing was really explained and there was no end. What the Hell?!! So, I look on-line to find out there will be two more books......, not just one more, but TWO. Do I need to say any more? I am done.
B00APUQJLO|1.0|I'm not sure why I inflicted this movie on myself. I didn't like the book, either. Terrible acting only drug it down further.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Some slow parts are overly descriptive but the action and twists are worth waiting for. And character development is unparalleled.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was expecting a children's app, but this really had my brain working! I am anxiously awaiting more. rooms to be added. Thank you for I initiating this app for all to use.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|I love it.I didn't start watching it till it started on TNT. Now I never miss it. I could watch it every day.
B00CL1SR7O|5.0|Best album to date.  Catchy pop, most underrated, underappreciated 'boy band' out there.  Good for summer time listening. Fun & Catchy.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Like his other books, this was another moving story. Paints wonderful pictures using words. I look forward to the next novel.
B005WLQQ4Q|3.0|I liked it but not the best sophomore efforts.  Hope the next one is better.  But you either love them or hate them.
B005LAIIJY|5.0|Plot & cast amazing! Esp Foxx & Waltz, good chemistry!  Seen it 3 times.....love story, western, history (sad part) and redemption!
B0040ZA2D6|4.0|Love the show, love the group, really like the album.  A bit too commercial, but it *is* a Nick show.
B005FOLIZ2|4.0|As the good little teenager that I was, I wouldn't have liked this show in my teen years.<br /><br />It is funny at times and there are definitely some awkward situations. This show is a little addicting too, if you like it. But there is teen sex and questionable partying, as well as some language, so be forewarned.<br /><br />I recommend for those of us who can find humor is others' high school experiences.
B000Q4RJWW|5.0|Air Force One is one of those movies that I can watch over and over again, and still it retains its luster. This movie is about heroes, more specifically the President of the United States, played beautifully by Harrison Ford. He is a man of strength, character, and wit, and must save his crew from hijackers. When this movie first came out, the story seemed very disturbing to me: a movie made in the U.S. about hijacking our very own presidential aircraft. What a country we live in!! Gary Oldman does a stellar job as the chief bad guy, while William H. Macy is solid as usual. Is there a movie that he (Macy) is NOT in? All in all, Air Force One is an excellent action movie with one heart-pounding moment after another. It depicts courage, love, and humanity. As I alluded to earlier, the story is disturbing, but watching it had me feeling patriotic.
1451695195|4.0|Good read, but still not completely convinced of the biology of the brain as it relates to his experience.  Especially because he did not die (blessing in itself).  Still, a good read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book is much more eventful and an f2f angering than the first stop but in a good way it sort of like the relationship between katniss and petta is flipped
B008OOYALE|3.0|so far, it only seems to attempt to try to be like Dragon Vale.  Free is a good price for it
0142000671|5.0|I read this in high school for the first time (and it wasn't on the reading list). It was simply the best thing I'd ever read. I wished it was twice the size it was. I just didn't want it to end.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|A good game to keep your skills moving. Was hard at first but now i have the hang of it.
140120841X|5.0|Quite amazing concept for someone to come up with. The depth to which it is pulled of is amazing. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good story that makes them think. At times it can be a bit hard to follow though this was easily overshadowed by the rest of the novel. A great work.
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|It was on sale at the time, and who doesn't like a bargain?  And it was the Anniversary edition.  It's as good as the original edition.
030789701X|5.0|One word great book, just to look at. I'm a big elder scroll player so just buy the book you can't go wrong with it.
030758836X|2.0|Everything about the book is negative.  I spent the first half wondering why I'm reading a by-the-books \\"suspense\\" novel, especially when it's so negative.  What was I suppose to be hoping would happen?  I had no idea.  Then the twists started, and it was somewhat interesting, only piled on with more negativity.  Then the lousy ending: a chance for some redemption, but you get nothing.  You just feel cheated at the end.  So that's hours spent mired in negativity with no payoff at the end.  I mean, I GET the end.  But it's a cop out.  For such a \\"smart\\" book, she opted for a snarky ending rather than do the work to make it interesting.  Not smart or funny.  Find something better to read.  It shouldn't be hard.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It doesn't have no helpful hints or level directionsi don't understand level six what to do with the numbers on the case I done for most of the room done except that part and that sucks
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was fun and kept my Attention. enjoyed it and great mind game. enjoy. have fun and need more rooms.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this show.  Only hate that I have to wait so long for season 4 to start. Can't wait to see what happens next.
0062255657|4.0|A seven year old boy is befriended by the girl down the lane who, along with her mother and granny, is more ancient than the universe and more powerful than anything.  He becomes entangled in the conflicts of elemental beings, to his great peril and dismay.  A good deal of the charm in this short novel is Gaimon's adherence to the point-of-view of a naive child whose sense of wonder is thrives equally in the face of (what we grown ups would find) both the ordinary and the mind-blowing.  The women down the lane present as humble farmers, nonchalant in the face of every crisis. Characters who are simultaneously mundane and cosmic, along with the lure of Gaimon's clear, spare prose, make this story fall somewhere at the intersection of psychological novel, magic realism, fairy tale, myth and  Bildungsroman.  A lovely read.
1452110581|5.0|I thought this would be a perfect gift for a cat loving friend, and I was right. She was surprised and delighted at the title and couldn't wait to 'delve' into it. The cover says it all by the picture implying that cats are very smart, and she appreciated the acknowledgement of her same feelings by someone other than herself!
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I can't remember the last time I walked out of a movie, but if I had seen this in the theatres I would have. We rented it and simply could not get through it. Confusing, uninteresting and just a horrible chore to watch. Turned it off about 3/4 through. Love every other movie of Tom Hanks I've seen. I thought that would be enough. I was wrong. Stunned at the rave reviews. Never have seen a movie with great reviews that I've given such a low score for. Oh well, that's what makes human taste so interesting I guess. I can't even imagine who I'd recommend this for.
B00005JKOI|4.0|I grew up watching he 80's movies and this one was one of my favorites. molly ringwald was big back in the day and I liked any movie she was in. great flick.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|GANDHI is by far the most inspiring movie I have ever seen. It will move you and change your opinion of the world.
B001KRVLCI|5.0|how does it get any better than putting these two guys together in a film? I am a big fan of both of them so no wonder I love this movie. the shipping was good as well.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|One of my favorite seasons of Merlin and now I own it. I love it! BBC Thank you for making a great series.
0679746048|4.0|different in some ways than the movie, but still a good true story. to anyone that has been in a ward like this you'll be able to relate to it well. great acting and great cast. it also shipped quickly.
B00AF7Z44K|5.0|It was a great buy. Now I can watch Merlin anytime I want and I can take it anywhere. Awesome!
B002BWP49C|3.0|not the best of the saga but still a necessary part of the saga. it could have included more from the book but it was still good.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I was so exited when it went on sale.I just had to have the last season of Merlin. It was a great buy.
B003QO8TDC|4.0|this movie was great when it came out and it still is a great movie. I loved this movie. it was inspiring. I still watch it a lot. it is a great movie and I recieved it fast.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I could not put this book down. I can't wait til the next one comes out I thought that this was going to be the last one but now I find out there is another one and I can't wait.  I wish the authors could write faster.
B005LAIHCM|3.0|I was expecting something a bit different as i watched it so some parts came as a big surprise to me. I believed ryan. turned out that was not true. It had a good twist to it.
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|I liked the movie,  It was very good.  It played well in my dvd player. Thank you again.  Good bye
B00005JPD0|3.0|if you miss any part of the movie you may as well stae=rt it over. you have to follow this one closely in order to enjoy it. it is a good movie and I got it fast.

B0000JCFPE|4.0|this is the first of a movie that turned into a sequel. I really liked this movie so I decided to buy it along with the sequel. they are both psychological thrillers and are very good movies.
B008LY5VHE|3.0|I don't like the swearing other than that it has good acting.  I really was disappointed with the language.  Thank you.,
B001AEF6BI|4.0|movies like these back in the day were iconic. they are nostalgic and I buy everyone that I can find. this movie was one of the best ones. it took awhile to get it but that's okay. it was worth the wait.

B0021L8UPS|4.0|I seen it before and was pleased with the story line so I decided to purchase it. all the actors did a great job. it sucked to see the father die but he should have believed his wife. good movie.

B000TGJ8CQ|3.0|if you pay attention than you will like this movie. naturally since Nicolas cage is in it I new it was going to be a good movie. Jessica beal is also in it, as well as julliane moore.; it was worth the money and the wait was not that long.

1591844096|2.0|This book fell flat for me, which is surprising given the gushingly positive reviews it has.<br /><br />First, a bit of a disclaimer.  The subject matter / topic of this book is important and much needed.  I really wanted to like this book, and have it inspire me.  It didn't.  Maybe that means I'm not in the target demographic, or I'm not \\"ready\\" for it, or I'm just a \\"cog\\" in Godin's world view.  I'm an engineer, so maybe I'm not an \\"artist\\".<br /><br />Positive:  The resistance chapter was the best part of the whole book.  While it suffered from the same jargon/code/vagueness as the rest of the book, the content and context made sense.  Had the book spent more time expanding on this chapter and particular idea may have had more impact.<br /><br />Negative / Everything Else:  The writing style became annoying very quickly, and I skipped one of the more \\"art\\" themed chapters in frustration out of repetition and lack of context.  This is my first Godin book so maybe this is how he does things, but like others have commented, the \\"blog-esque\\", twitter style paragraphs did nothing for me.  Some of the paragraphs are one or two sentences in length for the bold heading it's supposed to address.  There is very little continuity between these bold headings, and what comes before or after any given thought.  I also disliked the continuous, repetitious \\"code\\" words like \\"art\\", \\"the work\\", etc.  I would have preferred some more specific examples or real world references than generic description after generic description.  The writing style came off to me as rather full of itself.<br /><br />The book struck me as a $16 fortune cookie:  heavy on philosophy, absent of practical and applicable information.  I understand the fundamental concept that \\"there is no map\\" for this sort of thing but then that raises the question of what the goal of the book is supposed to be.  If there really is no tangible advice or protocol to \\"smash the resistance\\" and \\"create art\\" like he suggests,how does one get there?  \\"Just create the map\\".  Ok, that could have been said in a couple of pages instead of 200+.  For $16 I'm disappointed that I didn't take one new idea away or learn one new thing from the whole book.  There is even a convenient passage that basically states if you don't see things his way, then that's proof that \\"you're a cog\\" or missed the point.  Seems a bit of a cop out to me.<br /><br />I really wanted to believe.  I am admittedly stuck in a status quo environment and greatly wanted to be inspired.  This book didn't help.  I likely would not look into Godin's other works, nor would I recommend Linchpin to others.  Maybe I should just stop buying these type of self help / business books.  Two stars simply for the resistance chapter, and for attempting to address an important concept.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I liked the movie,  It was very good.  It played well in my dvd player. Thank you again.  Good bye
0316010669|4.0|A quick and interesting read.  I would consider reading other works by the author.  Great case studies / examples throughout.  A very unique topic.
B009G8GRX6|3.0|It was good, I don't think their best album but it was good enough.  I don't regret buying this album.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I chose this book because I have a nephew who is in the Special Forces. I felt the book might give me a feel for what our military was faced with on this mission and others. The book is well written, fast-moving and shows the commitment and bravery of the Seals. The book gave me a honest picture of their service in Afghanistan and that part of the world.  I was somewhat struck with the attitude of the &#34;thrill to kill&#34; even though it is for the honor and protection of our country, and sorry that the world has once again been degraded to that level, which is the case with all major war. The book also suggests the decisions made in Washington are connected to political rewards for government officials, who in the end take the credit. I am a person who believes that there will always be war and freedom is not cheap.  I am indebted to our military and I recommend this book to anyone who is willing to explore the truth of the mission and the sacrifice that the military makes for our freedom.
B0099G4Y26|5.0|Ok, her concerts are awesome and this album is just as great.  Even the ones that are not heard on the radio are great and it is great to hear an uplifting albums compared to her last album.
1932735410|5.0|This book is full of so much information, but will be useful for my preparation for my PMP exam. Will definitely use this in potential upcoming employment.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|This is almost a perfect album. The only negative I have with the album is the length. However, I would rather have a shorter album with great songs than a longer album with crap songs like Geoff Tate's F.U. or anything \\"Queensryche\\" has done the past 15 years. This is just a taste for what is to come, we finally know who has been holding the band back. If you get this album you will not regret it.
B0090KZDSK|5.0|I hesitated a bit before buying my first Sylvia Day Crossfire book and fortunately I wasn`t dissapointed: even it did not contain so juicy sex scenes, the story itself is very intriguing and got more interesting book by book. If new/forth book would come out, would defiantely buy it to be part of more upcoming events in their lives.<br />I wouldn`t say that Eva and Gideon road to &#34;happy ever after&#34; ended in this book, there is some light at the end of the tunnel and they have stepped towards it.<br />I liked 50Shades, also Maya Banks Sweet series was wonderful. Love scenes are not first priority in this particular series but it makes the whole with everything else that is going on.

B00519YRH2|3.0|I was so looking forward to watching this movie with my kids b/c I remembered it as such a cute show (which it is). It's funny and heart warming.. Tom Hank's role is just unbelievable.  However, I DIDN\\"T remember the language.  There are several instances of G.....D...  I refuse to write that b/c I hate hearing it.  There is also the F word once from a 13 year old.  Don't get me wrong... I love the show but didn't let my son finish watching it b/c I just didn't know what he was going to hear next. I sure didn't remember that from when I watched it in the late eighties.  Nevertheless.. it is a classic show but would have been much better without the language. I guess since they didn't have PG13 ratings then, they pushed the envelope.  Just a heads-up for you moms out there..:) God bless....
B0002TT36G|5.0|I have been buying these collectors binders for years and they are far superior than the made in china binders that fall apart. If you collect trading cards this is the binder for you .
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Let's face it - Gideon and Eva are far more interesting, complex, and real characters than Christian and Ana.  And Sylvia Day has a great sense of humor that she inflects into the books - there are some awesome one-liners in this one.  Spoiler Alert:  The fact that the story doesn't wrap up at the end disappointed me a little, but then again, I'm more than happy to keep reading about this couple's journey.

0345803485|5.0|Really loved this book, very different though.  I recommend reading it, but expect to be surprised and read the whole thing before judging.  It has a lot of twists ans turns!  I have a several friends read only a bit and then stop, because they thought the book was about something it's not.  Again, it is a great read, very different and unique, and obviously an adult book.  Plus, I heard it is going to be a movie, which is exciting as well!!<br /><br />-Kate-
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Great movie to show the young Captain's beginnings. It's funny and fills in gaps of the captain's history. Great for all Trekie fans.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I've never been much of a gamer but this game is fun and challenging.The graphics are outstanding and moving into different levels keeps it fun and stimulating.I'm a young 60 year old guy and it takes alot to impress me. This game does and its free.What more can you ask?
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great app that syncs across platforms. I use it for my to do lists, reminders, ideas, and journal. great Pdt and image features
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is the best g and in the world download it please please poo lease the only problem is by can't move the screen or play 1st person
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I often have a hard time sleeping as I cannot shut my brain off, but this helps with that,  also SUPER love that I can vary and layer the sounds and their volumes for whatever I'm feeling that night...also good for meditation.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|What can one say when it's free and it works.  Very basic and simple, but that's fine for a quick calculation.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|First of all it's a great 3-D view. Second it got trashed unfairly because of nonexistent budget issues. Third you just need to see it to appreciate it... it's a great film that has action, adventure, heart and comedy. Can't beat it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This novel held so many life lessons about choices we make and their effect not only on ourselves, but on our families...  like dropping a pebble in a pond to watch the ripples race toward the shore. There is familial love and mutual responsibility offset by selfishness and self-serving, causing the reader a good bit of nostalgia -  and perhaps some regret. And overriding the events are exquisite contextualization and authentic ambience.. A unique read.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I absolutely loathed this thing when I read it in high school but since it was a free download for Kindle, I went ahead and gave it another shot.  Though I still hate most of the characters in this book, I have to admit now just how well-written it is.  Glad I gave it another go.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Very thought provoking. Challenging but not overly so. Hope for more levels soon as I was disappointed it was over so soon.
B004EPYZUI|5.0|I know this movie didn't review very well but (I know this sounds obnoxious) I don't think most people understood it.  The layers of symbolism in it are *great* and it's one of the few films I've watched in recent memory that I really found myself *thinking* through, to try to get all the pieces.
0440246318|3.0|My title says it all, guess I, (like the rest) will be waiting around until the fall to find out if Reacher ever meets up with Major Susan Turner.<br /><br />I've read them all now, from the first Jack Reacher - \\"Killing Floor\\" through \\"A Wanted Man\\", (sorry but I'm not interested in \\"Jack Reacher Rules\\"). You'll note I have given Mr. Jim Grant's books, (his real name) a 3 star rating overall for the 17 book series and this is largely based on what many others have said, with which I agree. There are just some in the series that appear simply phoned in, but as an avid reader of action-adventure which began back in 1981 with Jerry Ahern's John Thomas Rourke I love these type of what is referred to now as pulp-novels.<br /><br />That said I have deducted one-star for the fact that Mr. Grant has yet to figure out, (in 17 books) that Glock 19s come with standard 15 round magazines, that it is \\"cycles\\" that causes magazines to fail - not long term storage and that in all my years as an NRA Pistol Instructor the only jams with a Glock of any of the big 3 calibers, (45acp, 9mm, 40S&W, all which I own) I have never seen one malfunction that wasn't caused by \\"limp-wristing\\". Surely he didn't suggest Reacher was guilty of that mistake now did he (page 524 of \\"A Wanted Man\\")???????<br /><br />The second star deduction was for the several books (read the reviews and you'll find 'em) that were simply just plain boring and the repetition in not only this book but several others in the series of the exact same sentences separated by chapters in many of books; as well as the clift hanger type situation in which I now reside.<br /><br />Generally I find the Reacher series more than acceptable and they will fit well on the same shelf with the aforementioned \\"Survivalist\\" Series of 27 books by Mr. Ahern, which could have possibly been Mr. Grant's inspiration for the Jack Reacher character in the first place, (John Rourke/Jack Reacher.....some similarity there I guess and not just in names).
B0016BPWNM|5.0|Introduced our 5 year old to the mysteries of the Labyrinth and he wanted to watch it again and again =)  Glad to be able to share these great films with the next generation.
B00746O3X8|3.0|I put it all together, but then abandoned it halfway through the shoot.  it's just too clunky and taking the cameras off is not smooth.
B005S9ELVC|1.0|This was a shoot'em up for the crime period of the 1950's in LA<br />Another movie that has crummy acting and depends on violence to lure you in !!!!
B000066HI4|5.0|This is probably the greatest work of one of the best (and most underrated) songwriters of the past few decades.  The evocative but strangely playful treatment of death is the theme that pervades Oldham's songs, and listening to the album in its entirety can be a truly moving experience.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Okay, so draw a stickman Epic is an amazing game. You draw a stickman and it comes to life. You draw a friend for your stickman and he/her gets eaten by an evil book. You must save your friend and your quest begins! There are 5 different types of pencils: a fire pencil for burning trees, lighting TNT, and burning monsters. A rain/storm cloud pencil that also burns trees and lights TNT, but it stuns monsters. There is an axe pencil for chopping down trees. A key pencil for opening gates and activating robots. And lastly the snow cloud pencil that freezes objects. And yes, all you need to do is tap an available pencil (not all pencils appear in a level) an draw!!<br /><br />Controls are very simple. Just tap somewhere on the screen an your stickman will walk to that spot. Graphics are crisp but simplistic and I haven't had any problems on my kindle.<br /><br />The conclusion is that this is a SUPER FUN and HUMOROUSLY FUNNY game and I had a LOT of FUN and anyone who buys it will too.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it teaches how to save money and for one or more animals while limiting yourself in coins and gems by buying a variaty of things from food and treats to saddles and even more horeses. unlocking different levels opensdifferent races and items I love this game and check it every single day.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Game is a lot of fun.But there is a big problem with opening this app. goes to 3% and will not down load from that point on.Very frustrating!!!!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I love this set.  It's nice, the movies are great, and looks fabulous in my movie collection.  What more could I want?<br /><br />My favorite thing about it (aside from Short Round): The box that the set comes in looks like a book.  It's very sturdy and protects the discs from dust and wear.
B003SI605K|5.0|The Joy Luck Club was a wonderful movie, I highly recommend it! It was more tragic in places than I was prepared for because I watched it for a Cultural Diversity class. However, the tragedy and how the characters overcome it, is without a doubt one of the best parts of the film.
B0070UFMOW|5.0|had to return it because the headphones I got had sucky base so I returned them. So no need for this but it itself preformed marvelously.
0061950726|4.0|This novel, like the novel &#34;Mercy Train,&#34; tells the story of children who were sent by train from difficult poverty situations along the Eastern seaboard to families in the upper Midwest (MN, IA, NE, ND, SD). Some of the children found foster parents who took them on as their own children. Others, unfortunately, were viewed and treated as cheap labor for farmers.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book a great deal and would certainly recommend it to others.
B001RCD2DW|1.0|It says it all in the description folks \\"For the price these really arent as great as everyone says. Bass sucks sadly even with an amplifier.\\" UPDATE: Hey everyone!

B00CATONCA|2.0|I felt compelled to jump on here and do my write-up for the show after i saw the five-star rating that this season has somehow received so far on Amazon. Obviously, I'm a long-time watcher of the show and can say that enduring the entirety of season 3 is nothing less than a chore.  Looking back now it's rather apparent that Frank Darabont teased all of us with his very well done and intriguing pilot episode.  Also, the fact that season 1 was a brisk 6 episodes was a blessing.  They were able to introduce a multitude of characters - some more interesting than others - and got fans of zombies and good drama rather excited for future seasons.  Mysteriously after season 1 the budget for each episode dropped and in turn so was Darabont.  If you are going to buy up all the seasons here based on its impressive 5 star rating, know that this show doesn't feature anywhere near the production value and great acting/writing of some of other highly regarded shows(Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad for ex.).<br /> Anyway, I may be completely wrong here but without Darabont the show seems to be faltering badly..  Season 2 suffered from silly melodrama and was criticized harshly for not including enough zombies or zombie kills, etc.  Season 3 now tries to completely counter that by having WAY too many, which basically sums it up for me.  The show becomes, well, brainless, which is rather fitting.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|I didn't know anything about the Green Lantern when I bought this movie.  I think that was a plus, no expectations dashed.  I watched the movie on its own terms.  After a confusing start, it gradually grew on me and I began to enjoy the goofy conglomerate of action, flash, and fury.  It was a live action cartoon.  It did exactly what it was supposed to do, entertain.  Yes, at times it was a bit cumbersome, but for all that it still made a statement that worked just fine in the superhero universe.  If I had any concerns it was with the star, Ryan Reynolds.  His predilection for playing smart alecks and jackasses had me worried.  In this case, thankfully, he was toned down.  True, he was still playing a bit of a jerk, but the reckless, braggart at least grew during the course of the film.  At times he appeared appreciatively overwhelmed with his unearned power.  I'm glad they didn't try to make a joke of it.  As for the rest of the cast, I'm puzzled as to why Tim Robbins and (especially) Angela Bassett consented to appear in insubstantial roles that ultimately amounted to nothing and could have been played by anyone to the same effect.  The only actor who got to showcase his talents was Peter Sarsgaard (playing the pathetic villain Hector Hammond).<br /><br />It's by no means a masterpiece.  At best, it can be accused of being merely functional.  I liked it because it hit enough notes to make it worth subsequent viewings.  It's a keeper.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|Hair salon 2 is fun to play and its very funny especially when the people in the game make their own little noises. People may think this game is stupid,well that's their opinion. I think this game is fun when you are bored. It doesn't glitch or anything like that. My little brother likes to watch me play a lot. Well it's worth the 2.99!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Super fun! Lots too do<br /><br />A lot of fun Kissed and I both loved playing it.  Will try more of th these game s.for

B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Excellent action flick. Much better than expected. A bit long but it holds your attention. Can't wait for the next one!
B006LSZECO|4.0|good read for a trip or beach vacation.Good twist in plot kept me turning the pages. so I recommend this book
B005MYEPXC|5.0|Love Owen Wilson. This is a keeper. We have watched this movie several times and have loaned it to friends as well.
B00000CQJZ|5.0|It's a very good film for my quirky taste.  It's fun and ironic with questions lying below the action.  The ending is a unique surprise, but not the typical Hitchcock ending.
B004EPYZQ2|4.0|This was an good movie, but I do not know if it would be worth watching a second time. I will probably put it in my next yard sale.
B00CDT41RY|2.0|I kept hearing, but this one is good.  Not so much for me.  I live Jamie, Sam and Kerry though.
B004EPYZSU|3.0|This movie is not one that I would see more than once. I will probably sell it in a garage sale.
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I love this movie... it was a funny, light, silly comedy.  The actress has beautiful eyes.  They worked well together to create a cute comedy love story.
B008K6HN8I|1.0|No clue how it words and couldn't, in a 2 hour period, find out how it works.  Two hours is sufficient time to find instructions, no product is worth your lifetime to figure out.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great Magic the Gathering with quite a lot of playable content without paying for the game. It isn't completely unlockable without paying as I first thought, it just has a lot of content before it doesn't let you go any  further. I have it on a 7 HD and 8.9 HD and it works great on both.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I cannot begin to describe  this book. A most  read. George Martin is brilliant. I eagerly await the next book. Hurry Mr Martin.
B000TXZP0S|5.0|THIS MOVE CONSIDERING THERE WAS ONLY 3 CONFIRMED MURDERS BY THIS FAMED SERIAL KILLER ... IS WAY TO LONG A DRAWN OUT ... THEY TRY TO FORCE SUSPENCE ON A DULL STORY LINE.
B00BGIC2J2|1.0|Worse movie I have seen in years. Only able to tolerate 20 minutes before the viewing audience  agreed to stop it. Wasted $4.99
B006VFLIYK|2.0|Writing is not good, story kind of interesting but pretty much guessed the whole thing. Was bored but had to simian what I started.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Great game, lots of fun for everyone. Challenging yet still fun for all. Need more levels to challenge more. Fun,
B0063M22QO|5.0|I enjoy playing this game.  It starts out with easy levels but quickly moves on to more challenging games.  I recommend this game to others.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I must say I was pleasantly surprised that it didn't end. I sorta knew it wouldn't when I was almost 98% done and didn't feel it was being summed up. I get exhausted just reading about Eva's life but I wouldn't want it any other way. Who wants boring and typical daily life when you could have Gideon messing with you. Sylvia Day doesn't disappoint in her writing style and it's always so nice when it's edited well and there is no grammatical errors, makes the book worth it's price. I devoured this book in less than a day. Couldn't put it down had to see how it ended since I had waited so long. Worth it. Now I can't wait for the next one.
0385349947|4.0|In the past several years it has been clear that this book needed to be written by someone.  Sheryl has the professional cred to say some of these difficult things. She is direct in her writing style and some of the office situations are as riveting as the &#34;Masters of the Universe&#34; writings used to be.
0312853254|4.0|I couldn't put it down, simply devoured it in a couple of days.  The action is quick paced, new worlds and new characters, and a new alien race (or two?).  Not only are the gaps at the end of Ender's Game filled in but the new complications and plot make the Ender saga so much richer.  There were a few loose ends that didn't get tied down (yet) but overall a great read.
B000AYELVU|4.0|X2 X-Men United is a very good follow up to the first movie, much better fight scenes inculding the scene with Wolverine and the female version of Wolverine.  A few characters coming into the mixture as the movie goes foward inculding the scene at the house where Pyro goes \\"you hear about those mutants on TV...well I am the worst one.\\"  Great blowing up the cop cars very good special effects.  Plus one of my favorite mutant characters Nightcrawler and his Relgious Faith its nice to see.  But back to the movie X2 itself has a very good story line about revenge and the lengths person will go to get their revenge, plus what lengths a person go to protect the people they care for and about.  Now I just need to watch X-Men The Final Stand to see how it all ends.  But so far amazing special effects good acting jobs by some talented actors makes me look forward to Wolverine this July 26th and the 4th X-Men movie next year.  So buy this movie if you havent yet if you like your action, drama, special effects and two guys fighting for love of a woman.
B007SGM084|5.0|No d of amazed the series hasn't received any more praise than it has. Certainly not to be read by immature audiences as it is very heavy on sexuality, however, a very enthralling read for young adults and up!! I really hope that they go ahead with the movie plans for this series.
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I have this playing in my car - can't get enough of the selections and/or Andrea's voice.  Just wonderful to listen!
B00D7JQJFG|5.0|This book is obviously and definitely astounding  for the people who finished the game; and merely became obsessed with the universe and setting of 'The Last of Us'. Fascinating to know the reason this universe got to exist, and how so. And good to know that this ain't the typical universe you get to usually see and know. This game is such art, if you played the game, and viewed such outstanding art book outta this, go for the comics, 'The Last of Us: American Dreams', if you hadn't read it!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|awesome book with tantalizing intrigue. Can't wait to read the next in the series and beyond.  I will be sad once I have finished them all.
B0010HA68I|5.0|The [[ASIN:B0010HA68I OP/TECH USA System Connector - Reporter/Backpack]] are at the heart of a great system for carrying a DSLR with a backpack. They attach to the pack's shoulder straps. They are reasonably constructed for average circumstances.<br /><br />I bought this set to take a Nikon D70s on day hiking trips in the local mountains. Other reviewers had remarked about the plastic snaps used to attach these to the pack straps. I took no chances and ordered a pack of Grimlocs ([[ASIN:B007ZCOO8A Military Carabiner Grimloc D-Ring Vest Backpack Keychain Clip Snap Foliage Green (Lot of 4)]]), which are more than enough to support a DSLR in suspect terrain. I sheltered the camera with a Nikon 18 - 70mm zoom in a [[ASIN:B007ABIYKA Case Logic SHC-101-BK DSLR Day Holster - Black]].<br /><br />The shakedown hike was longer than expected, 11.6 miles/2,600 feet of vertical gain, mostly cross country, using some abandoned roads. It ranged from \\"jaunt in the country\\" to \\"OMG!!! Why am I doing this?!?\\" The straps on this are short enough that the camera did not bounce, yet long enough (just barely) to shoot both portrait and landscape modes. I'm 5' 8\\" -- if you're much taller than I am, you will probably want longer straps than these.<br /><br />I also got an [[ASIN:B003T0EYVE OP/TECH USA Utility Strap - Sling (Black)]] which is compatible with this system, allowing me to carry the camera around my neck when not wearing the pack.<br /><br />If one wanted to, they could rig something similar with straps and fasteners and grimlocs. I didn't want to wait for enough time to DIY.<br /><br />Highly recommended. With this system in place, it was easier and faster to grab the DSLR and start shooting than to grab the point and shoot out of my vest pocket.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I've read this series at least three times. I suggest this book to most of my friends. Good book for teens, but the content is too heavy for younger kids.<br />Check out the Gregor series by Collins also.
B008JFUQ3O|4.0|I think this film is a very cute sequel to \\"Despicable Me\\" and good news, the minions are in it even more. The 3D animation is wonderful in this movie and the designs and colors are very fun visually. I can tell the creators of this film paid attention to what audiences enjoyed most out of the first movie and that is what influenced a lot of \\"Despicable Me 2.\\" I think all of the voice actors suited their characters perfectly. This film brings back the familiar voices of Miranda Cosgrove, Steve Carell and Russell Brand, while also adding in newer characters such as Lucy voiced by Kristen Wiig, Antonio voiced by Moises Arias and many others.<br /><br />My favorite character is actually all of the minions. I loved them all so much in the first \\"Despicable Me\\" and I think it was a great decision to include them for in the sequel. Their banter is so funny, even though I can't understand their gibberish, their motions tell the story of what they're trying to communicate. I think the way they work together and fight is very comical and all of their interactions are very funny. The minions really are the perfect side kicks to Gru since he is so wacky.<br /><br />My favorite scene would probably be when Gru finds out that Margo is on a date. He freaks out so much and goes running around the mall trying to stop the two of them from being alone. It's really funny and although it is a bit over exaggerated, it still shows what all fathers go through when their daughters start showing an interest in dating. I also think it's funny how Margo's sisters react to her new romantic interests. Edith, being a total tomboy, thinks that it is disgusting for her sister to go on a date with a boy. Agnes on the other hand<br />thinks it's the cutest thing and immediately starts saying that they are in love, which only worries Gru even more. The entire scene is filled with very funny, memorable dialog and interactions between the main characters and is definitely a scene that stands out for me.<br /><br />I recommend this film for ages 6+ and anyone who enjoyed \\"Despicable Me\\" will absolutely love \\"Despicable Me 2.\\" I give this film 4 out of 5 stars. It has the perfect mix of humor for children and adults so it makes for an  enjoyable experience for all.<br /><br />Reviewed by KIDS FIRST! Film Critic Raven D.

B00BW0QC8G|4.0|I had difficulty coming up with a star rating for this Case Logic Backpack; for my purposes and life the bag rates only three stars, for someone with different needs it almost might rate five. So I've settled on four stars, mostly to be fair to the company. Nice looking, lightweight and with many useful features, this backpack has much to recommend it. There are, however, some design flaws--at least from my point of view. Read on for the breakdown!<br /><br />This backpack is indeed a great way to carry around a laptop and/or tablet. The space allotted for devices is roomy and well-insulated from the front and back. I finally have a good place to stash my cords as well. There's a zippered, soft-interior pocket for your phone and I liked that some pockets are padded for more fragile items. I appreciated the fun tabs on the zippers that make opening and closing the compartments quick and easy (much better than the last laptop carrier I reviewed for Amazon, a Targus Drifter Messenger Bag. What a nightmare to open and close all the buckles). The backpack is truly lightweight and professional enough in appearance to bring to work (as I have every day since I started using it).<br /><br />And now for the flaws. When the pockets are designed for a specific purpose (or \\"designated\\" as the company puts it), they're great. But this pack has many pockets with no apparent purpose but to just fill up space. I would like to know what useful purpose the little mesh pocket in the foremost compartment could possibly serve, being too shallow to hold much of anything and not secure enough to store a small item. It's just there. The 15+ separate pockets give this bag a cluttered atmosphere that I grew frustrated with. Trying to remember exactly which compartment your bottle of ibuprofen is stashed in is its own headache. I was constantly searching for everything that wasn't my electronics or large notebook. Smaller items just got lost in a sea of pockets.<br /><br />While I liked the phone pocket at the front of the bag, as previously mentioned, ideally it would be big enough for my wallet as well, since those are the two things I use the most. I ended up storing my wallet, keys and phone in the roomier hidden pocket, which is at a slightly awkward angle when you're trying to pay at a checkout line. Hunting for those three items just took up too much time.<br /><br />The straps are tedious to adjust; you will have to stop what you are doing, undo the Velcro one side at a time, adjust the straps, make sure they are even, reattach the Velcro on both sides and check to see the length is what you want. I did like the handle at the top of the bag and the separate smaller loop for hanging the backpack up. It also fits nicely on top of a luggage pull-up handle. I have had backpacks without this feature and it is no fun to be dropping your bag all the time at the airport.<br /><br />In conclusion, a product that could have used additional thought in the design process. I've tried to outline the drawbacks in detail, because honestly some people may not mind these issues at all. The full retail price I think is a tad high for the performance of the product, but if you can get it on sale and if the look appeals to you, and if you have a great memory for where you put your keys, cautiously recommended and rating:<br /><br />GRADE: Bhone pocket at the front of the bag, as previously mentioned, ideally it would be big enough for my wallet as well, since those are the two things I use the most.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I love this movie because it's not angsty about coming out, AIDS, gay bashing, etc.  It's about trying to find your way in life, love, and family.  It's sweet and sappy.  It's anxious about \\"Is this real?  Is this what I want.\\"  It's nice to have a gay love story.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I wish it had more detail at some points. A few fast forwards where confusing. Love the ending wish there where more books.
B002GHHHKQ|5.0|it is a great movie, and shipped fast. the product was as described on the item information. would reccommend to anyone who enjoys sci fi
B007FEZQF8|5.0|More interesting then the show, it's a different storyline tho... just a bit different. Maybe a little bit cheaper, like five bucks cause it was such a quick read. But I enjoyed it and don't think I waisted one cent
B004GXZ69W|5.0|Helps with my carpal tunnel syndrome.  I found that mousing over two screens was irritating to my cts and this has really cut down on my symptoms.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed playing this game.  I found it to be challenging  but not to hard. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a game that makes you think.

B005HSL626|5.0|This game is fun for many ages. For me it's the perfect game to play if you want to relax.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|I just reread this book so that I could read the last two because I never got a chance to make it through those two, and I still love this book. The characters are funny and relatable in their own little ways and I  like the story itself a lot.
B00002N9ER|5.0|Does the job!  Easy installation.  Keeps my Mag Lite within reach at all times. Highly recommend this for every Mag Lite owner.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I do like this book a lot, but the whole time I kind of feel like we should be getting a little more from Clary, in the sense that as the main character she strangely does a whole lot of nothing in this book haha. But I did enjoy this one, especially since it got a bit darker from the first one and has a bit more of a scare factor to it!
B007HUD6OS|2.0|might entertain a 10 year old.  Did I accidentally order a kid's book?  If so, it should be advertised.  Alexander
B0091REZMW|5.0|I have been playing this game for a few days and it is challenging and fun to play. I definitely would recommend this to my friends.
B005TBN04S|3.0|I know it's not as good as the first one, but why would I expect it to be? I like the characters and so I liked the movie. I guess I'm simple that way, but it was fun enough for me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don't know how this author is still a &#34;nobody&#34; as he puts it. The stories are eerie and fascinating. I read the books 1-5 in 24 hours and am now impatiently waiting to see what happens to Silo 18 and 17. Great read!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Not as funny as &#34;Mother&#34; with Albert Brooks which is a classic on this subject, but very sweet and enjoyable!
B00004BZ16|5.0|I wanted one of this for my best friend's present and, oh boy! She just loved it so much. She's really happy with the product. I can't do more than be glad for the good service and the quality of it.
B005VPSEK2|4.0|she always has good albums. this one is no different. all good songs but no one song that just rocks.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|This game us fun. Reminds me of cut the rope game but offers different scenarios. the game starts off easy, getting Roby into a box by eliminating platforms or boxes our using explosions to push him. The episodes after have different objectives like getting two robots into their respective boxes and also joining Roby and his \\"girlfriend\\" together. I haven't passed the third episode yet. The levels in each episode offer a variety of difficulty some are easier than others and some are more challenging but not impossible.
B004QMW1NM|4.0|very cool album. so different from a lot of bands playing. they've got a couple songs on here that just rock and have tons of energy.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I have never played Sudoku before and this I love. Kind of keeps the old mind active and alert. Love it!!
B00BG4UWPC|4.0|doesn't have the 1 or 2 awesome songs like their previous album but delivers a full album of solid tunes!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Despicable me minion rush is a great game for kids to play. It is a very friendly kid game that they will love.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I really like this series. But of course I love YA Paranormal books! I think the characters are well developed and lovable. It's interesting to learn more about them in this sequel. I recommend this book/series!
B00CE3IC74|5.0|I previously purchased the Android Edition tags WhizTags and was pretty impressed. I ended up buying some of these new tags for my wife, as the Android Edition tags don't work with the Samsung S4. Absolutely brilliant product. Colors are vibrant, the material is solid and they stick very very well.<br /><br />I love that these feel like a premium product. They're roughly as thick as a credit card, which is the perfect line between durability and portability. My wife is using them in her car to automatically enable Bluetooth and turn on GPS. She's also got one in her office that allows her visitors to turn on and connect to WiFi instantly, just by tapping the tag.<br />Lastly, she has one by her bedside to disable notifications and set an alarm each day. Very cool.
B003IHVKR4|5.0|This is a great movie even though I have seeing it a million time, I had to have it in my archive, it makes me smile every time I look at the cover
B008OOYALE|5.0|It's a great game to play if you like to build stuff and you like to watch animals grow so all in all great game to play
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This is the first book I've read on my tablet. It was a much better experience than I thought. The book itself while good is not as good as the HBO series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is one of the best shows I have ever seen .  The understanding of the culture of the time in Great Britain is an eye opener.  Well written, well acted and superbly produced!
B008JJM88Q|5.0|This is a funny app, as we have all tried to have it guess what we are thinking, and amazingly it does!  Me and my husband have even thought of things that go way back, and it still guesses it. Is there anything this cannot guess? Fun to play.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I Couldn't put this book down! Read it in 2 days! Slightly dark, with a good twist at the end!
B005HED11Y|5.0|I was interested in seeing the originals after seeing the newer two movies. I must say I'm quite impressed. Many of the story lines are very engaging, which is enough to get hooked.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|It is great on my phone...tablet...and IPad!i can read my books wherever I feel like it. Great for an avid reader like me.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is fun and forces you to use your mind! I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the 100 Doors game!
076535618X|4.0|I like Old Man's War to the point that I wondered if Heinlein had written it (huge Heinlein fan). But I was a little disappointed with The Last Colony in that it lacked originality and at times was a little predictable. Nevertheless, Scalzi's writing is impeccable, and he moves the reader along with interesting plot developments. Would give 3.5 stars if available.
B000FC12SM|5.0|A must read for ALL couples, and everyone to learn about the opposite sex. Makes perfect sense and a great way to avoid arguments before they even occur.  Would help any relationship SURVIVE and THRIVE!
0061726834|5.0|yeah whole book is amazing except for the fact that the eNDING MADE ME WANT TO JUMP OFF A CLIFF AND CRY FOREVER
B00B4804KS|5.0|Same great movie it always has been, now with 3D.  Didn't know how well it would convert - some 3D movies made that way today are poor - at least in places.  This was well done throughout.
0446547603|5.0|What can you say about Nicholas Sparks' writing? I always enjoy his story telling ability regardless of what he has written.
B001H4R4LQ|4.0|The time for preparations has passed and at last the critical moment has come.  The march to Galbatorix begins!<br /><br />The action tenfolds while Christopher Paolini maintains the quality and integrity of his story and writing.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|What can you say, it is another Nicholas Sparks book! I really enjoy his writing style and his story telling ability.
B003P9VZ0W|4.0|My 5 year old daughter loves these!  She was given free reign in her room to put these where she wanted.  My only complaint is that the gems don't stick as well as I would like.  They are falling off the walls one by one.  But other than that, I have no complaints.  They look really cute in her room.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a must read! Much better than the movie. My wife got this and she couldn't stop talking about it so I had to give it a go as well.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is awesome I play it when I'm bored its free so that is one reason it is awesome its fun and fantastic
155927557X|5.0|If you like modern philosophy then this is for you. The CD helped me get a better understanding of the book. It also allowed me to review my reading from the previous night as I was heading to class.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|And like nine more ZZ Top albums!  And those little three and a half inch cardboard holders like the original albums instead of the plastic cans cds have always come in . . . oh, they're so cute!<br /><br />I bought this mostly just to get ZZ Top's first album, but remarkably, I hadn't bought \\"Afterburner\\" or \\"Eliminator\\" on cd, so that worked out pretty good for me.  Hey, it was only like thirty dollars; I've bought one cd for forty dollars at one time!(Lenny Wolf's Stone Fury first album with \\"Stay\\")<br /><br />I know I've been rocking out!  Everybody who makes the decision to buy this is going to have to measure things out for themselves!
B0091REZMW|3.0|Great preliminary eye exam...Lol!!! Makes you focus a lot more than usual. Good time consumption. Zone out, and focus... Good game...
B0051ANPZQ|3.0|This is a great book for teenagers to read over the summer. It is a quick read and very interesting. Every character gets their own chapter with their own point of view. Recommended for all ages.
B000NDMRDW|5.0|It is not a dream... If we do not stop killing our atmosphere this movie is going to happen one day.
006114665X|5.0|I believe world war 1 was the greatest tragedy in the past 500 years.  Three monarchies were destroyed and were replaced by Nazism and Communism.  Responsible for well over a hundred million deaths and suffering in the billions. The subject is worthy of study.  I haven't finished reading the book.  I hope when I do,  I can understand how a 19 year old child started this.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I thought the story was well told.  Acting was excellent.  Technical production was very well done.  Overall very entertaining, may be a bit too violent for 10 and under.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I can't believe how awesome this app is.  I love it so much and don't know what I did before.  The predictive text saves so much time.  I don't normally pay for apps but this was well worth it.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|I was very entertained by this effort.  Scenery was beautiful and believable.  Some reviews on James Franco were negative, I didn't feel that way, I thought he did a superb job.  Great story well acted by all.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really like this game it is a good challenge for your mind and I Love the way you have to find the hidden puzzles to get the door to open
B005JABN8Y|2.0|poor quality and not matching the picture.<br />even the little figures are not colored unlike what i expected.<br />sorry<br />how can i avoid this in the future?
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love this game. Try to figure out which two tiles to eliminate. Like that you can change background scene, tile types and can play never ending game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|In spite of being first of 3, this is the only book that could stand alone...but I'm glad it wasn't. It shows us a dystopian future with a unique mix of several pieces we have seen separately in other works. Katniss is not your typical heroine, preferring to work alone or with &#34;the only person who really knows how [she] works&#34; (Gale). She is thrown into her role by the only means possible - her love for her little sister, Prim. The development of our understanding of her foreign world is well-done; neither patronizing nor redundant, we come to understand the variables within the structure from her point of view and can infer much more.<br />Haymitch is an amazing character - he is everything one would expect with his background. He also develops throughout the series, but his &#34;snarky&#34; personality, the ability he & Katniss have to communicate with little in the way of words and his overall fight with his own demons are well-established in this first installment. (personal note: Woody Harrelson is perfect for this role, sweetheart!)<br />An excellent beginning to a series with thorough planning, development and presentation in characters, plot and setting. 5 stars.
B007HUD6OS|5.0|I am a huge fan of John Grisham's books.  The Theodore Boone books kept my interest throughout.  I recommend you buy the Theodore Boone series.
B003O86FMW|5.0|&#34;Catching Fire&#34; picks up a few months after &#34;The Hunger Games&#34; ends. It is, like the other two, broken into 3 parts and well-planned. Katniss evolves in many ways over the series, as does our understanding of the events transpiring without Katniss' knowledge. Peeta, as always, is steady & reliable, while growing into a man before us. The characters are, like the plot, well-developed and realistic. Ms. Collins' understanding of military matters and of PTSD show themselves subtly and effectively in this portion of the trilogy.<br />The arena in each book is well-done, but this one is - by far - my favorite in terms of the participants and the originality of the gamemaker's terror tools. 5 stars!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|This book is very easy to read, and it made my marriage much better!  I highly recommend this book. Thank you, Amazon for forcing me to write so many words to get this point across!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|At the end of this book, my first reaction was dissatisfaction. However, after much thought and re-reading, I have come to understand the complexity of the many aspects...and to appreciate Ms. Collins' being true to what happens in the aftermath. We are not given a rosy ending that ties everything up. Rather, we are given a picture of what PTSD truly looks like 10, 15, 20 years later.<br /><br />The ride this book gives us is swift and exhilarating. The twists, turns, details & even things merely alluded to are gripping and memorable. It is a great read at it's surface and has a depth that will have you reading it again. 5 stars.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game was entertaining and really makes you think.  I loved it and  if you love puzzles this app is for you.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I love Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man!! No one else could ever fill that position!! I love how witty and funny he is.. The movie is just great!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|A very disturbing book. Loved it. It made me think pretty dang hard and I was forced to put myself in this situation and decide how I would act. Well played mister Brooks.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|A good fun and challenging game. Find it kind of complicated in some areas but a must for those who enjoy a hidden objects game with a twist
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game, it's a lot of fun. Not too easy not too hard. I rate it among my top 3 games to pass the time with.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|Not sure that I really appreciated Wings back in the day!  This is a very solid recording and as with everything he does, Paul gives 110%!
B00C5ZORES|5.0|Was never a fall out boy fan until the first song was released.  LOVE LOVE LOVE this album! It's now part of my playlist for 1/2 marathons!
B00BY1F8UQ|5.0|Not sure there could ever be a bad Keith Jarrett disc!  Great sound and enjoyable to listen to.  Hard to listen to just once!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have a galaxy 3 phone. The sceen is big enough and you can change the size of the font of the book you download . I have enjoyed  reading on my phone.
B00A77II0U|5.0|A most intriguing game. It kept me spellbound for every minute I played it. I would thoroughly recommend this game to all. Well done, let's have more like this please.
1476715904|5.0|Oh wow! I completely and utterly love this author. She is able to tap into so many different emotions. This book as with some of her others is a total emotional rollercoaster. I am not sure if Slammed 2 will follow on from this story as it did seem to wrap up, very nicely, at the end. I will definitely be finding out though, next on my reading list is Point of Retreat.
B009FZFONO|5.0|i enjoyed the movie i can always go back and look at the movie it look very clear and sound was good
1623420148|5.0|Emma Chase you have just become my favourite author! 5 Freakin Incredible Stars! Whatever you are reading, put it down and start this book! Witty (as in laugh out loud moments), awesome characters and a great story. Totally refreshing style of writing and point of view!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A really cool game for anyone who loves horses. Awesome graphics and lots of fun. Great game for all ages.
B0097HSS4M|5.0|This is a great app.It made my pictures clearer and enhanced them.I would recommend this app.to everyone.I am very happy with this app.cissyyy
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Don't know what I would have done without the calculator.  Thanks Digitalchemy for coming up with this particular app; it truly was a life savor.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|gorgeous, complex, outstanding performances all around, especially from lawrence fishburne. resets the camp that unfortunately has come to define the hannibal character in recent years
B00CRWJ5GO|2.0|I was really looking forward to this flick. It seemed like a great idea.<br />Unfortunately, it was a major disappointment!<br />Average acting, muddy storylines, and too many drawn-out scenes ruined what could have been a great movie.<br />The creators should have gone all the way and made it artsy!<br />Instead, they try too many ideas, not enough interesting ideas, and the film goes nowhere fast.<br />It presents some heavy messages, but nothing most of us haven't heard before.<br />If you don't have patience for someone else's self-indulgence, skip this.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Is there for fourth book??? I kind want to read from his point of view. I've enjoy all 3 books. Just the way the have evolved as characters.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follett is not only an excellent builder of characters in his novels, he also knows history.  I have never been fond of reading pure history, so I have loved learning it through his settings.  I now understand so much more about how WWII started, and I've seen it from the eyes of different countries.  In this book, Mr. Follett has continued the lives of the people he created in Fall of the Giants, which describes WWI, and the continuity of thought, ideas and lives makes the series incredibly interesting and educational.  I highly recommend reading this book, but begin with Fall of the Giants first.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|It's not your typical love story, it's got depth and the characters have got their things to work though. I enjoyed the second book the most, I think it's because it's the book where everything comes together
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I like this fourth album of Susan Boyle the best. I listen to the songs from musicals (and sing along at times) both in the car and at home. If you like musical theater or films, you will like this CD. The CD's producer said the Susan Boyle sang &#34;Over the Rainbow&#34; once and made most of the people in the recording studio cry.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|This book has a different way to approach the &#34;happy ending&#34; it goes a bit deeper than that and also a bit further. Nothing is straight forward and you also get to know CG better and where he comes from
B00CL68QVQ|1.0|I hated this movie. It was so super corny. Bradley Cooper is a terrible actor. Robert DeNiro did not feel balanced with him in the movie. The information about bi polars was distorted.I wasted my money. This movie is a 20 somethings kind of movie as only 20 years old would like the ridiculous romance.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|This is probably the best shooter, but it has been crashing ever since the update. Fix this and it will be five stars again.
0446572985|5.0|David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors.  This book is fantastic, holds your interest on every page.  Great read.
0312360266|5.0|I absolutely adore this series and the mini-novella's!<br />It is always interesting, never boring or dull.  There's always another twist... :D
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I love mahjong and this game has it all.  different layouts and easy to play.  it is a bit addictive!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My son absolutely loves this game! Even more so than angry birds! He can not get enough.. lol I'm sure an kid 6+ would love it.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|LOTS OF ACTION, GREAT PLOT, TYPICAL OF ALL MI FILMS.  THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE.  TOM CRUISE FITS THE ROLE PERFECTLY.  SUPPORTING ACTORS WERE GREAT.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|What an amazing journey in to a fantastic world. The characters virtually jump off the page.  Outstanding.  I would recommend this to anyone.
B005K17RU0|1.0|The actual temperature was 80 degrees, but this said it was 71 at 7pm, however the next hour it would be 81 at 8pm. I don't think so!!!
147674355X|1.0|I try to choose my books carefully but screwed up on this one.  I think it was listed as a NY Times Best Seller plus over 5,000 reviews.  I'll be more careful next time.  If you love books like The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and authors like Henning Mankell, Arnaldur Indridason, Halldor Laxness, and Jo Nesbo, to name a few, you will be very disappointed in this book.  It's for teenage girls.  Sorry I purchased it.
B008MWBY6W|5.0|I love this camera bag for my new Pentax camera.  It is VERY well made.  Just the right size.  Comfortable shoulder strap.  Well padded. Enough room for accessories.  Great price too.
0920668372|5.0|I read this book to my kids all the time, it was a favorite of my middle son, when my brother and his wife adopted their baby boy, we had two copies of this book and he said \\"Mommy, can we give them one of our Love You Forever books, because every baby needs that book\\"  to this day this is his and my thing.  He just left today to go into the Army and I said to him \\"I'll love you forever I'll like you for always as long as I'm living my baby you'll be\\"  it still makes him smile and feel special.
B008DW6VOQ|5.0|Quick and easy way to find current information.  Bloomberg does a great job.  It's a nice app. for a Kindle Tablet.
B008FPOIT6|3.0|I am recommending this book to my nephew who is into codes and computers.  Well written and different, but just not for me.
1611761808|5.0|Integrating this collection of seemingly separate short stories, Hosseini creates spell binding insight into lives of multigenerational, distinct, unique players.  I could hardly wait to get into the car (where my audio book awaited.)
B000HF0ISC|5.0|This movie was like A Bronx Tale meets A Few Good Men.  I am always a sucker for a movie that shows you true blue friendships and their limitless  loyalty.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|The movie was excellent.  Amazon Instant Movies are the best and I can't wait to stream my next one.  I made it a night and watched The Dark Knight Rises afterwards.  It made for a great movie night.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I loved this book. I would definitely recommend it! So touching and makes you cherish life, even when it isn't what you planned it to be.
0525244581|5.0|Everyone needs to own this book and read it over and over again. There are life lessons to be learned from our wonderful Pooh.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|It is written from the view of a reporter after the crisis is over, who goes back and visits the locations where pivotal events took place.<br />A lot of these events are fantastic, and I wish there were more. However, all the hype from the author, and movie, I do not think applies. The book is a great read, and very insightful of how things can go awry.<br />I have not seen the movie yet, but I gather from those that did that this may be like &#34;I Am Legend&#34; movie and book. Book was excellent, movie was excellent.. but cant be compared as they were similar only.
0887081770|5.0|There isn't a book he's given us that isn't wonderful.  This one is especially special.  All children need his books.
1410454606|5.0|Because it was told in a language understanderable.  Did not have opinions in it. Was not built up to make sound better.
0307744434|5.0|I didn't have any expectations when I started reading this book.  It caught my eye simply because it had to do with magic and a challenge.  What I discovered along the way was amazing and a true pleasure to read.  The author clearly has a very creative imagination because the circus  and everything about it (the tents, the costumes, etc.) was truly a delight to picture in my own head.  The vivid descriptions were wonderful.  (It would make an excellent movie to watch.)<br /><br />The romance between Celia and Marco was very well written and not cliche or cheesy.  The way the two complement one another and display their feelings with their abilities is beautiful.<br /><br />The book had many characters but I believe they were developed well enough and fit into the whole storyline very well.  I liked the storyline with Poppet and Widget.  Bailey's role was unexpected but a great addition.  Kiko was also an interesting surprise character.<br /><br />The part that I was a little dissatisfied with was the way A.H.'s role was tied up in the end.  I think that could have been done more creatively.
B009KS4XRO|2.0|I was really excited to play Bingo, especially when it said &#34;Free&#34;.  Well, it let me play for awhile and then I needed to buy &#34;credits before I could play further.  That really irritated me.  I also did not see any instruction on how it all worked before I even began.  I didn't know what I was doing. So, in other words, I like playing Bingo, but I didn't like this set up.  I will delete it from my Kindle and play no more.  Too bad for me!
B006N0YWGY|3.0|This game works fine on my Acer Iconia A500 tab and my Samsung galaxy s3. It crashes on my nook after on round of play.
B0046B6X1E|5.0|Watched this for the seventh time, what a great movie.  Didn't know John Travolta was in it all this time.
B005KELW26|4.0|Fits device well. On/off button and charging port easily accessible. Magnetic clasp easy to use, but doesn't close cover without an indent so it doesn't &#34;look flat.&#34; Worth the cost for the quality.
B004G6009K|2.0|[[ASIN:B004G6009K Tangled (Four-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)]]<br />i anticipated watching the 3D movie of this. however, it doesn't work, the disc is defective. i watch it in bluray instead :(
B0056FMNYA|4.0|The price a bit high,good quality, the production is from Italy, at least, it said. Get the first time hanging around the waist and feeling good, but with out practical problems more, placed in front of the shelf top crotch bend over and sat there are obstacles, put after walking the comfortable but sit there are problems, take the camera is not convenient, on the side of the camera is easy to be damaged, so in the practical process of constantly transform position to cater to the specific needs of. Comparative advantage is obvious, straps, camera is not easy to move, can slightly running and jumping movements such as, still looks very cool, advantages and disadvantages of each have their own considerations, although there are a lot of inconvenience, but I quite like it, often take it out!
0316223239|5.0|I loved this book. I am 63 years old, and I don't think I have ever read anything quite like it. Once I got used to reading the story through the eyes of a 5 year old, which took awhile, I really got into it.<br /> It's not hard to figure out what's going on here, and it's a story that OUGHT to be depressing, but instead, it's full of hope, love and finally freedom, and a new beginning, for this little boy and his mother, who have spent the first five years of his life in just one room. I don't want to say more, because I don't want to give the story away, but it just shows you that whether living your life in one room, or taking the frightening step outside into the &#34;real&#34; world, there are still boundaries, and walls, and even freedom can be a scary thing after living such a constricted life.<br />I must say again, this is NOT a depressing book, it comes out with a joyful, hopeful new beginning for both mother and son.
B002WJI66C|5.0|Boo is my  favorite character in the Mario sires I'm going to put him in my videos love boos now. -creeper dude
B00D6BU8GG|1.0|I think I would have loved this movie.....after all, it has Bruce Willis in it; but, according to Amazon, there was a licensing problem and Amazon was not allowed to download it.  Perhaps it would have been different if I was buying it, but I wanted to rent it only.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|The writing is good. The subject matter is just a bit too disturbing for me. It made me cringe more than anything.
B008GJVEZ2|5.0|It would be pointless to try and expand on the rest of the reviews here because they say it all. As I watched this tale unfold I was taken in more and more by the subtle tension and persistent and consistent smoulder of the plot. You can see it taking shape but you don't fully appreciate the beauty, like most things in life, until it is all over and gone. Certainly one of the best films I have ever seen.<br /><br />Rated R for mediocre violence and blood shed (by today's standards) with a few bra shots and a split second picture of a nude magazine pin up from a hundred years ago... Miller's Crossing will captivate mature action film aficionados and beguile romantics alike with its salute to the golden age and all of the things that they don't make like they used to. So if you like Model T's and Tommy Guns... go ahead and take this flick in. I doubt you will regret it...
B0060D15AK|5.0|Absolutely funny!  Love Betty White and all the actors.  Total entertainment!!!!  Please send to my Library video again.  It was accidently deleted.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This not too hard of a game it sure kept me going till I was too tired to see or even think want more.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Very fun and entertaining game. Good to waste some time on. In love with this game, even though you have to wait like a whole day for some stuff. Otherwise it's great.
B00BKU9ZFU|5.0|A classic new take on the blues classics.  Gives each of the songs her own take and the result is spectacular!  Her trio is a classic in it own right
B008VBYN80|2.0|Personally I thing this app could be much better. Starting with not get to g booted all the time. For those of u who don't know wat that is its when ur on ur gameloft live account and the game makes it to where u are not anymore. It happens to me and my friends all the time and we hate it. And when u get booted it takes forever to vet back on. Other than those major flaws it's really fun and I would love for it to be fixed thxx
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I LOVE this game. Time flies when you're playing this. I highly recommend this game. Don't start playing unless you have some major time to kill.
B008RJ6TTC|3.0|Yes, it was a big &#34;Gold Box Deal,&#34; but so far (I only finished 1st season) there are very few disks without flaws. Most episodes have a couple of minor interruption points, which doesn't make sense because they are new. I don't know if this is manufacturer's faults or not, but I am not very happy with the products. I wonder if mass-productions for Gold Box Deal could have caused this problems... Kind a disappointed.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Really like this app<br />lt is all that I need to plan my day. It makes my travel planning easy
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I loved the game and its just awsome. and I also recamand the breeding guide witch is also awsome and that's how I got a sun dragon
B000PAAH3K|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's books explain a lot about the world around you, how things happen, why people think and act the way they do. If you like reading about things like that, and understanding the whys of things, then you will love this book. It has a great takeaway too, and you will never look at things quite the same anymore.
B00847KFDS|5.0|My husband is a big fan of John Fogerty so I was very happy to find this CD. Prompt service was appreciated.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A great book to read to get the real time experience of what happened during the raid. The training they do is intense.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this lighthearted, romantic, witty and funny movie. Kunis is charming and sexy. Sex scene are not R-rated but very steamy and suggestive. Now I'm a fan of Timberlake and Kunis.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|needs more levels for more fun! but other tthan that, its worth downloading. I swear. now j need 20 more words but don't know what to say at all. but again, its a fun app. I got it as a drunk moment type of thing rreally.
B004IFYN2E|4.0|Great actor and actress. Movie has entertaining plot, witty romantic comedy movie. Overall I'd considered this movie as time well spent.
0060853980|5.0|a gift for one of my kids<br />She said it was very funny<br />she recommended it to friends and family
0399255370|5.0|I am not ashamed to admit it, I'm 41 yrs old and just purchased this book...for myself! I work at a library and when this book came in every person who read/looked at this book said they were going to purchase this book for either a child, or children in the family, or for themselves! I can't say enough good things about this book, do yourself a favor buy it! You'll smile and laugh and love it each time you read it!
B008LC8TJI|5.0|This is what my daughter wanted for her birthday<br />I liked the music<br />I would recommend this to my friends and family
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Amazing is the word for the book and everything was so realistic about it. I just loved the book. Great job.
B004NS710C|5.0|this movie kept me on my toes from the very beginning.  the best movie I have seen in a long time
B0031RS4V6|4.0|Vintage Jack Reacher- if you like Jack you will enjoy the book. He's the perfect man in my book! His character is not as developed as in later works, but still a great ride.
B004UPANAI|5.0|X-Men Origins: Wolverine has a good story line with good action scenes. The movie moved quickly with few segments of filler.
B0047VSW30|5.0|This movie doesn't stereotype or take the clichéd approach. All of the characters are relatable, and the story is believable despite taking place in such a different time period and culture. This movie is great if you embrace the ideals of science or skepticism, and it will remind you, by comparison, that the modern day isn't quite so hopeless or horrible as it occasionally may seem.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fun to play, great graphics. Enjoyed the mini puzzles within the game. Look forward to more games from G5. I like being able to try it before buying the full version. The first
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book opened my eyes to how I treated and acted around people out of the norm. Wonder changed the way I looked at other people. This book changed my life. Praise for Palancio.
B00A6RCSKC|1.0|I was looking for a  game when I see Kingdom Rush KINDLE TABLET EDITION. I had some amazon coins left over so I bought the game,synced my KINDLE FIRE and checked the cloud,but it wasn't there!!! I tried syncing and checking but it wouldn't come up in the cloud! And I think that I should get a refund for getting a app that I never got
B000065V42|5.0|I remember this movie from my youth. Always loved it then, and love it even more now. Seems to have gotten better with age! Really cute, and shows the importance of family.
B00CXL6XP0|2.0|I had great hopes for this album since they were shaking loose of the Tate impact which has been dragging the band down for some time.  There is not much passion in this release, no real drive that was the core of what Queensryche was in their early years.  Super haters of Tate will give the music 5 stars, but I am not sure that they are really listening to the music on this release.  This album is way better than Tate's recent FU release, but that does not say much.  If you are looking for Q2K type sounds, you will like this, but if you want Screaming in Digital, keep looking.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|They have returned! Queensryche has returned to claim their Prog Metal throne. What a great cd! From start to finish it's what QR fans have been waiting for, for a long time. New lead singer Todd La Torre has injected new life into the band. His vocals are spot on and he co-wrote many of the new songs. I can see why the band chose him to replace Geoff Tate. When the judge has to decide the fate of who keeps the QR name, all they'd have to do is listen to this new disc to know who the real Queensryche is. They're back!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Although 50 Shades of Grey did have devious sex, it also told a story of a childhood so harsh, that it left mental scars. Those scars were bridged in a very unconventional way. It is the combination of Grey's past that leads him to the present inability to show his true feelings for the woman he cannot get out of his head.
0061537969|5.0|Such a sweet book told through the eyes of a dog. It's amazing to think all of the things our dogs know about us and see us do!! Very heartfelt story told through such an innocent perspective.
B009NY43NY|1.0|I was so bored I found myself skimming to see if it ever got better. It didn't! Characters were thoen in for no reason but to wrap up the series. They could have been left out and been remembered fondly instead you end up feeling sorry for them because they are so boring and out of place. Charlaine should have stopped writing about 4 books ago for this series.
6304178352|1.0|Thought I was ordering DVD. The VHS format is useless to me and as a result sits around unopened and unused
B009ZQGNPQ|3.0|Let me say, first of all, Downton Abbey is by far the best TV show I can remember watching - at least up until Season 3. I watched Seasons 1 & 2 in less than a week and loved every minute of it! But this season is filled with only tragedy & sadness, and I found it to be downright depressing (I agree that it's more like Downton Downer). I hope Season 4 will return Downton Abbey to a &#34;feel good&#34; show again.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I would highly recommend this novel to anyone. It's a well-written, quirky, and meaningful story that's very relatable. It's different than your average book, as it's a little more personal.
1623420148|5.0|Loved the characters, the plot, the dialogue and the male POV. I haven't been this thoroughly entertained by a book in a very very long time. I am a big fan of Nora Roberts, Sandra Brown, and Susan E. Phillips. If you like them you will likely LOVE this book. Actually though, I have been getting bored with them and had been searching for something fresh. This was perfect. My only complaint is that the author only has this one book! I hope to see her publish more soon! I loved the relationship between Drew and his sister. His relationship with his niece made me fall hard for him. The way he interacts with his friends had me laughing often.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game that any age would injoy and love. It is sort of like temple run to me.
B00BXKKNFS|5.0|Blocking ads is essential to my Internet use.  ABP is one of best block programs.  ABP, Ghostery, Self-destructing Cookies & DownThemAll are my 4 favorite browser add ons.
1439102813|5.0|I could not put this book down. gave it to friends who are caregivers and those who have not been touched by ALZ
B000FCKRDI|4.0|I would recommend this to others. It is a very good fast read! Love her series of books. Thank u
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Great points points with explanations explains to why they are important!!  A must read for anyone, looking for conflict resolution or good steps towards new relationships.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game the best game ever. The awesomest game ever. This is my favorite game. The best game ever
B0087XBUS8|5.0|I'm not fan of sword-and-sorcery fantasy novels, but this may be first book of this genre to fully immerse me in its vivid, often grim, sometimes kind and seductive world since I read J.R.R. Tolkien's \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy as a teenager.  In fact, \\"Game\\" - for this middle-aged reader - may even trump Tolkien's work, for its better editing and brutal realism.<br /><br />I'm sure this review will add little to what others have already said, given my late entrance into Martin's created world, but to be clear: I loved and/or loathed the fully realized characters and their twisted, interwoven and intense histories; the action was raw, intriguing and unsparing; and the epic scope of Martin's world, as well as the \\"plots and counterplots\\" of its widely varied denizens absorbed this noir-minded (that is to say jaded) reader into its wild storylines.<br /><br />One of my all-time favorite books - worth owning, this.
B009GXHOW4|5.0|cool<br />I just love minecraft I have 1000 diamonds on it it is so cool I am epic at it its so addicting I cant stop playing it
B0064X7FVE|5.0|definitely a good one for sure! a must for people on the go or for people who travel a lot especially with the little ones!
B000I186FW|5.0|The movie is pretty similar to the book. A few differences in the characters but you still get the same overall theme.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun game and not to hard. Makes you think. Even the kids enjoy it. Would like more harder levels though
B00CWY76CC|5.0|We love this game!  It's a newfound fav with my husband and I, even our 6 year old plays it (somehow?)!  Love the challenges, love that it makes you think outside the box.
B00119ZMKW|4.0|The only reason this gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because some of the themes can get a little over played at this point in the series. But otherwise it is still one of the best Science Fiction shows mad.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Who doesn't love Michael Buble? He is terrific and there are many classics to enjoy again = in his voice!
B009FAQ9JW|1.0|Things get confusing because Amazon lumps together reviews for different versions of the same product, so I'll try to clarify.  I streamed the version of ONE-EYED JACKS that claimed to be \\"digitally remastered,\\" with a black cover and a closeup of Marlon Brando's face.  The movie looks terrible.  It's a great film, but the quality of this copy is absolutely abysmal.  Visible horizontal lines run across the screen, and many of the images are blurry.  Until they get a better copy, don't waste your time.
1781162646|5.0|This book is not the usual horror story that Stephen King is famous for.  In fact, except for the occasional mention of a ghost, this story is mainly about a young man growing up in the early 70's.  The story is told by the young man, when he is no longer young.  He is a senior citizen reminiscing about the time he took off from college, and worked at Joyland--an old fashioned carnival that was soon to close a few years later.  The story is bittersweet and I especially liked the fact that an older (and wiser ?) person is telling the story.  There is love, as well as mystery in this story.  This is the perfect story to read during the summer, and I recommend it to anyone that is looking for an enjoyable reading experience.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is a great game.I really like the features that they added in.Anyone who hasn't gotten this game yet.I reccomend getting it. :)
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Fun but I only recommend it for skilled gamers.It gets complicated as the missions go on.The Lizard is far in the game(I already beat it) so if  that is why you are buying th app Don't get it.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|The movie made all the characters seem stupid.  They eliminated characters, changed the plot line, and changed the whole tone of the book.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This book is a great book. It talks about a really great dog (part st.Bernard and part Shepard). This dog proves everybody wrong and everybody is amazed with what a dog can do. Warning if you are really sensitive to animal cruelty you shouldn't read this book. In some parts this book it heart breaking. :) review by: Faith DeLorenzo
B00ADS98FC|5.0|If you love music and to sing, this is a great movie. My kids love to watch it over and over.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|It's a great game &amp; I really enjoy playing It!!! The s 're story line is great &amp; the graphics even better!
B000000WFZ|5.0|I enjoy fine music and Amazon's prices are the greatest not to mention the &#34;listen to&#34; sample feature and large stock.  I don't have to go to music stores to shop.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's great &amp; fun. I really enjoy it. Gets addicting. The horses are also fun. The competition is good. I would download.
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|This game is so much fun! I cant stop playing it. Only thing is it keeps freezing up on me. An if I close the app it doesnt save my progress so each time I have to start over.!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|i loved the entire crossfire series. Wish there were more for me to read. I would have liked to know more about  how things turned out in the story. Excellent read
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I loved the generational storytelling and how events in one life ripple through time and around the world. This was an engaging story with a cast of compelling subplots that drew you in to each struggle.
B00D5YNQMW|3.0|Although not yet released in the US, this title has been on sale in Japan since mid-June (and I managed to purchase a Blu-ray copy there during my recent trip). Filmed in Japan back in 2011 (while the country was still recovering from its earthquake/tsunami tragedy), this concert film is pretty much the band's tribute to their legion of Japanese fans.<br /><br />On the positive side, the performances are awesome and very nicely filmed (as one would expect from seeing Aerosmith performing live). And the focus here is more on the 'hard rock' songs from the band's catalogue (none of those cheesy ballads that they have become so famous for since the 1990s... don't worry, that irritating song from \\"Armageddon\\" is not here). So, if you prefer the harder and 'bluesier' side of the band, this one is for you. It is possible though that some fans may be unhappy about the omission of some of the band's better-known songs from this collection (eg. \\"Janie's Got A Gun\\", \\"Dream On\\", etc). The Japanese edition contains 4 bonus tracks (\\"Train Kept a Rollin\\" - full version, \\"Lord of the Thighs\\", \\"Lick and a Promise\\" and \\"One Way Street\\") but I am not sure whether these are included in the US release.<br /><br />Now, to the negatives. Although I love the performances here, I really hate how this Blu-ray is organized. First of all, this is a 'collection of performances' from various shows rather than a single complete show. Ok, there's nothing wrong with this from my perspective... however, why on earth do they have to mix short interviews/comments/tour footage in-between almost every song??? WHY, WHY, WHY??? Most of us buy a live DVD/Blu-ray because we want to watch the band perform... we want a continuous, non-stop 2-hour live show. Instead, there is disruption after every song with all those interviews, comments, etc. This has been promoted as a concert film and so it should have been released as such. At least, the disc menu should include an option that allows the viewer to decidewhether to play only the live performances or to play everything. Or, why not put together those interviews and commentaries as a separate 'Japanese tour' documentary? Why mix everything together? After all the complaints received for their previous concert release (\\"You Gotta Move\\" DVD), this latest release has not only repeated the same mistake but has multiplied it by ten times (now we get an interruption after every song, and this means that most of us are unlikely to leave this in our Blu-ray or DVD player for repeated viewing, simply because it is so damn irritating!).<br /><br />'5 stars' for the songs and performances. BUT... '0 star' for the Blu-ray!!!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|I loved this Book. It was well Writen and you did not want to put it down. You always want it to know what comes next.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|While I enjoy using youtube one of the things I enjoy is too be able to listen to certain music videos. Which brings me to why I did not like this app! A search bar would be nice, so that I may enjoy the video I want not what is playing! If I wanted no search option I would use one of those other inferior programs..
