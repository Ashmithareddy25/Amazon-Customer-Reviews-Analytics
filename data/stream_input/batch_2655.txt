B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I'm no Van Gogh, but I can't believe the beautiful things that show up on the screen when I play with this app. Endless amazement.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I didn't want it to end. A wonderful escape from my own life. Inspirational and thought provoking at times. And written proof that there is beauty and kindness in the world.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I love this series! I can't wait until the next book! This series is exciting, funny and touching - all in one!
B00DCX08MW|5.0|Another great simulation from this developer.<br />The controls are identical to previous apps like Carrier landing, so if you have those, you need no instructions to fly.<br />You have more setting options than in the other games, and advanced graphics.<br />The free version is somewhat limited of course but still more than a teaser.<br />Rortos apps are very taxing for your system, so even on a Kindle Fire HD the framerate goes down if I set the graphics to ultra.<br />About 70% details works fine.<br />The only thing I miss is a cockpit with working instruments, even if just digital as in earlier apps.<br />Highly recommended though if your tablet can take the strain.<br />Not sure if it would work on the older Kindle Fire, so test this free version first before you buy.<br />I give it a five despite the resource hunger of the app, because it's the app I review, not the system it runs on.
006178480X|5.0|The Eye of God is another slam-bang action/suspense novel in James Rollins's Sigma Force series, and it is perhaps the most breathtaking of all.  The author puts a lot of balls in the air in this one, and longtime readers are going to get rewarded and saddened at the same time.  Not everyone makes it out of this one alive.  Or do they?<br /><br />The action heats up in the opening pages, juxtaposing Gray Pierce's and Seichan's search for her missing mother (who they just discovered was still alive in the last book) and a deadly comet that delivers a peek into an apocalyptic future of the United States eastern seaboard - and possibly the world.  As always, Rollins cribs potential science and curious history into a blend of exotic conjecture laced with chases and blazing guns.<br /><br />There's something about a Rollins novel that just encourages readers to check their doubts and cynicism at the first page of a tale.  It's like going to a fireworks show and you've arrived just as the first rocket takes flight and bursts against the velvet night.  Readers don't worry so much about how things work (much like the fireworks observer) and instead focus on the sizzle and thunder and colorful chaos of the show.<br /><br />A lot of writers could get by on the sheer adrenaline mainlined into these books, but Rollins delivers great characters.  A whole roomful of them, in fact, and if you don't know who's who when you first tackle this book, you're going to have to catch up fast.  Instead of merely attending to the status quo, Rollins has mixed in some new faces that promise interesting storylines as well.  Watching the Sigma Force team members grow is every bit as entertaining as watching the chase and hearing the ticking clock ringing in your ears as you turn the pages.<br /><br />As always, Rollins throws in considerable geography as well.  The action swings back and forth from deep space to Macau to countries once dominated by Genghis Khan.  The author takes a lot of his background from topical headlines, so when he starts talking about how many people can trace their ancestry to the Mongol warlord, I already knew that.  What is fascinating, though, is the credible (okay, semi-credible - since I'm not wrapped up in the chase now) witch's brew that Rollins makes of all that history and science.<br /><br />At the end of every book, Rollins always provides a list of resources he used to put his story through its paces.  I always appreciate that list, and I often pick up some of the books he names, or at least follow up on the science or the history.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book to first-time readers, not because it's hard to get into (Rollins provides plenty of backstory for all of his characters), but because the series is so much better when read in chronological order.  Can't wait to see how the team saves the world next summer!ackground from topical headlines, so when he starts talking about how many people can trace their ancestry to the Mongol warlord, I already knew that.

B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it, its the perfecft game for my Mario fix. Mario still rules, but this game is fun and definitely resembles Mario Try it, what do you have to lose?
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|How can you not love Om Nom?  The puzzles in this little game are great little mind teasers.  My youngest son has already conquered the whole thing.  He can see the engineering puzzles almost right away.  And the sound effects make us giggle.
B000IKAHN2|5.0|If you enjoy the stargate series, you will love Stargate Atlantis. I have watched the entire series several times. The wraith become an interesting foe and at times necessary ally. I enjoy the suspense, action, and chemistry between the cast.

B000SGGUWS|5.0|Pretty Little Liars by Sara Shepard is one of my favorite books. I recommend this series to anyone who enjoys a little mystery that keeps you guessing and reading.

0670026557|5.0|Bob Sutton said of Adam Grant's new book Give and Take: A Revolutionary Approach to Success that it \\"just might be one of the most important new books of this young century,\\" and proclaimed it was a book every leader should read. I strongly concur.<br /><br />Adam Grant is one of the world's most prolific researchers in the field of organizational behavior and management. Unlike the overwhelming majority of books on leadership and management, this one is actually worth reading because it is backed by several decades of excellent peer-reviewed scientific evidence on organizational citizenship, prosocial, and helping behaviors . This is a substantive read, but Grant weaves in real-life stories to support his evidence as well as any author you will find. I purchased my copy of the book, and it will be required reading in my MBA class this fall. I also bought it for my own daughter who is still in college and yet to start her career.<br /><br />Grant's research shows that all of us will assume one of three types of postures toward others: taker, giver, or matcher. \\"Whereas takers view success as attaining results that are superior to others' and matchers see success in terms of balancing individual accomplishments with fairness to others, givers characterize success as individual achievements that have a positive impact on others\\" (pp. 256-257). Grant's call to action for all of us is to \\"focus attention and energy on making a difference in the lives of others, and success might follow as a by-product\\" (p. 256).<br /><br />Takers are selfish. Selfish people can win in the short run, but are much less likely to build a legacy of enduring greatness. When taker's win, someone always loses; however, when givers win, their success spreads and cascades to others in their networks. But there are two types of givers, and Grant's evidence shows that givers dominate the top and bottom of the success ladder.<br /><br />Selfless givers give their time and energy without regard fortheir own needs, and as a result they too never achieve the lasting success. Otherish givers \\"care about benefiting others, but they also have ambitions goals for advancing their own interests\\" (p.157).<br /><br />Do you want to achieve success in your life and career? I hope so. If you do, the evidence is pretty clear that by investing in the success of others, you make an important investment in your own success. Practice this posture and your success will be deeply rooted, rippling through the lives of those you work and live with.<br /><br />Grant's book earns my highest recommendation.
B00D6B4PUG|3.0|Not happy with it. I like the set up used on my notebook best. It's hard to forward, file, why can't it be more consistent??
B002IE2JF0|4.0|I don't want to spoil too much here but I thought this was an entertaining take on a quite famous and ancient tale.
B00DHNAQ2Y|4.0|Yeah,had to buy this bc it isn't availablefor rent til the 23rd...<br />I'm an \\"EVIL DEAD\\" fan, parts1 and 2.\\"Army of Darkness\\" was s'posed to be part 3,but I didn't dig it as much as the original 2.<br />REAL BIG SPOILER ALERT!!!!!<br />They used Sam Raimi's car,once again,in another movie.C'mon,man;its been in the \\"EVIL DEAD\\" trilogy,\\"SPIDER-MAN\\", and now THE NEW \\"EVIL DEAD 2013\\".<br />ANYWAYS...I am a horror buff,watched gore flicks since I can remember,and I was 6 when VCR'S came to life;that's how I saw the original.<br />It was pretty good,well made;the acting could've been a bit better.Zero comedy-like the originals had in them-made this a pretty serious movie,and it had alot of gore.<br />It definitely was not scary;I think the last movie that ever made me jump out of my seat was the part in \\"THE RING\\" when the mom was describing her daughter's dead look then they flash it real fast.<br />When I said it had bits and pieces of the original movies, if you saw the originals,at the end you will know what I mean. 3 and a half stars.

B006CDCWDM|5.0|This a a great book about a personable, humble, great guy. Gives a lot of insight into the person Rafael Nadal. Must read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is beter beacuse there are more opsticales. and it is rally fun for my younger brother and my younger qusin q
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  Very intense!  I liked this better than 50 shades of Grey.  Wasn't so sure at first and then WOW!  It got very interesting
B005PK57NU|5.0|Great show, would definitely recommend.  Season three was great.  The quality of the Amazon instant video was very good.  Would purchase a show on Amazon again.
B005GIS23I|3.0|I thought the movie was more stupid than funny.  It had OK parts.  It was somewhat juvenile.  Could have done without some of the language..
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I loved season 4 (especially the finale - I won't spoil it for you).  The show kept me on the edge of my seat.  Great quality.
1476733953|1.0|I heard great things about this book so I had high expectations. However, it is nothing more than a cure for my insomnia. The writing is terrible. The characters and plot are boring. I really wanted to like it but it's just not good.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|This is a light piece of fluff, good for a night of no brainer relaxing. It has a good cast and is reasonably well acted although a little hammy at times. The photography and special effects are very well done. So you could do far worse than this for a nights movie as it is entertaining and fast paced. A light hearted take on an old fable.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|Great movie for the kids to watch family friendly . lots of action and  adventure to keep them interested in it.
B00338QELU|3.0|The beginning is great, then the story fades. Would have loved the loose ends tied up. Very well written. I would recommend reading
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was the worst $10 I have ever spent. It is poorly written and the story line is Twilight meets trashy porn.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Loved playing this - couldn't put it down. Will purchase continuation when available. Graphics were great and storyline intriguing. The puzzles were a good level of complexity.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I have been enlightened. I enjoyed the reading although I have to admit I was a bit shy at first. Now I understand the entire concept of this lifestyle and story. Not for the timid. a very fun read.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Ordered this as a replacement for my phones shorter cable. Works great and quality is excellent. Will be ordering more.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very lifelike game and is fun to play with different activities and arcadelike games.  Good sound effects and suberb graphics!
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google (cse) is a very good efficient search engine, especially designed for phones & tablets.  I installed it on my Kindle Fire HD and found it very convenient to access, as I use it almost everyday.
B00821OX98|5.0|So this is a series that I was a little hesitant to watch, not because I didn't like the premise, just because I doubted it was done well.  I decided to give it a try, well actually a second try.  I had watched part of the first episode and stopped, but went back to it a few weeks later.  It has enough interesting characters to keep me invested and it really is more about the humanity in the aftermath than about the aliens.  It's sci-fi and has it's hokey moments and unbelievable decisions/actions, but in the end it is enjoyable to watch.  Although it is quite different in terms of setting and story, the pace and delivery are somewhat reminiscent of Battlestar Galactica.  I just started Season 2, so I guess I'm in it for the long-haul now.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This series has kept me turning pages from the day of their release. Don't usually read these type of books, no particular reason, but the first one sounded good when I saw it in the book store at the airport, had to have something to read on the plane! So glad that I picked it up, its been wonderful to follow the star crossed lovers! Great page turner! I finish them so quickly!
B005MLZPLQ|3.0|I'll start out by saying that Helen Mirren is a wonderful actress and does well in this movie. Somehow though no matter how well Helen acted and no matter how good the action was it couldn't save this movie. I don't think Shakespeare meant for his masterpiece to be insulted in this manner,( namely in part by Russell Brand). If you want to know the true Tempest story then....read the book and translate the old English as I did.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|fun game to play. Don't really have to buy anything. You must be patient. It's a good way to kill time. It can get a little boring but just a few minutes every so often is cool.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I think this book is amazing page turner couldn't put my kindle down... Love it would highly recommend it to whoever!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good accounting of the human race in a disturbing future. Twists and turns but not so much that it was Hitchcockian.<br />Character maturation and development makes them become three dimensional after first appearing typical of their position and place. By the end, you want it to continue - which it does in sequels and prequels....
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The way Max Brooks tells this story, with the short snippets of stories, leaves the reader wanting much much more!  This is a very good thing because each story could be its own book.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|One of the best ensemble casts hero movies ever. Just enough of each to support them even if you hadn't seen their individual movies. Great use of humor. Loki and Hulk &#34;interaction&#34; was hilarious!
B002QRWJA4|4.0|I saw the live performance of the Phantom of the Opera on tv and my great granddaughter<br />wanted me to get the movie so I did and I am glad I did.
B005EM8O8O|5.0|This book grows in intensity to a nerve wracking conclusion. Most enjoyable for people who have an interest in AI or computer software or even the stock market, but will appeal to readers of thrillers.
B006Y5EDRG|5.0|Love it. As addictive as Glee. Drama and wonderful songs prevailed throughout the season. Love Debra Messing and Anjelica Huston.
B0079K4WEE|5.0|I purchased this movie after seeing it on HBO or Showtime. I showed it to my class, and they all enjoyed it. It is quite provocative in terms of how we respond to others through our senses.  I highly recommend it for teens and adults alike.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Its the bees knees. Truly a masterpiece of wizardly porprotions. I enjoy casting spells and blasrting enemy creatures to smithereens
B001OQCV2E|5.0|Yea, the storyline is a little mediocre (and occasionally just plain ridiculous).  I'm no scientist, but I'm pretty certain there as some major inaccuracies here.  I kind of just don't care.  This is a fun movie to watch.  I love disaster movies and this one crams several large-scale natural disasters into one movie with awesome special effects.  I don't watch movies like this to analyze their scientific merit.  Even the story-line is kind of secondary for me in a disaster movie.  2012 gets 5 stars from me.  4-stars for all the stuff blowing up, falling down, and getting smashed into by tornados.  1-star for the addition of Woody Harrelson.
B00821OX98|2.0|I don't think my opinion runs all the way through the script writing, directing, or the acting. My boyfriend loves the show. I've just never really been able to get into it. I'm sure it's actually a good show...it's just not for me.
B0015346OM|5.0|Great read , puts you at the scene of the battle - Reminds us that in combat there is no easy day
B000062X90|5.0|I had totally forgotten about W.ishbone but had them somewhere stored on my memory &#34;hard drive&#34;.  This is a must own CD...I wish I could get a vinyl copy, but not available now. However, this CD remaster is superb...I have it synch to my Apple TV in analog mode...being played thru PSB midsize Towers...well broken in after 2 years now. This CD is worth crankin up on your speakers by another few notches. Good stuff!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Maggie Smith and Shirley MacLean made this season magical. They played off each other like the true masters of their crafts that they are.  This show is perfectly paced and relaxing to watch - yet informative with great bits of insight and history.<br /><br />LOVE IT, CAN'T WAIT TO SEASON FOUR!<br /><br />Kudos to the creator and writers
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This series had me hooked from the very first episode. I would highly recommend this for the whole family to watch.
B002VX3RCW|5.0|Ordered this for my nephew when he was about 6 months. He's almost a year now and still loves it. It's a great travel toy and his mom usually keeps it in the diaper bag when he's not playing with it around the house. Recommended!
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a really good app because, you can of course look up weather. It's real easy to do basically everything. I recommend this app.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|Again,If your a Halo fan,this is the movie to get..Graphics are awesome.My kids love this movie.For the ultimate gamer. Have fun!!!
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|I really liked this game. I had it on an iPod, and as soon as I saw this on a Kindle, I got it. Better than on the iPod for the larger screen. This game is a tower defence game, you build your little towers that shoot lightning bolts, arrows, dynamite and spawn soldiers. Then you allow the enemies to advance down the path and (hopefully) get slaughtered.<br />Even better, after every skirmish (of which there is many) you get stars to upgrade your towers. OH, did I mention that you can make fireballs rain from the sky?<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend this game if you are looking for a good tower defence game, or even just a strategy game.
B004QZ9PLU|4.0|Enjoyed this book very much - including the surprise ending. Would like to find more books like this one for my Kindle.
B00CUWWLWG|5.0|THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO PASS BY THE TIME. VERY FUN GAME I'M STILL NEW TO THE GAME BUT HAVING FUN SO FAR
B00AB7HESI|1.0|I love this game because it pretty much never ends and the possibilities are unlimited. You can really make anything from a to z and my brother and I love this  game .
B0046B1KHG|2.0|For a long time I avoided this cartoon though the images were fun.  I just felt that there was something missing in the promotional materials.  My instincts were right.  There is very little story here.  Just wrapped up in a cute package.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|This series and especially this book is awesome. I love the character of Gideon, but could do without Eva-the-nagging-I-have-to-know-everything-that-happened-in your-past character. She was very annoying to me most times. However, she is better than Ana from 50 Shades. Although I am happy to see Gideon making such an effort to control his anger, I hope the author refrains from making too much of wuss to please Eva. He is the alpha male most women dream to have. The plot of the storyline from the first book to this is great. I am anxious to see how the closes the loop on some of the story lines in the next book.
B004YXE438|4.0|This game is such fun! The puzzles are very challenging but such beautiful pictures. The controls are easy to use. My daughter takes it from me whenever she sees me playing since she loves it as well.
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Good fun cheap but worth getting of free zone for a fun game. I have received my monies worth and then some. Also your can earn money to purchase things for game rather than using real money.
030759565X|4.0|It has a different style of recipes that I am use to but I like it.  Not sure who I would recommend it to
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I enjoyed the movie that I watched it twice.  It's a great set up for the Avengers movies.  Too bad Bucky died.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a good site for anyone interested in weather. You can search for any area right down to the zip code. I also like saving different sites. Of course accurate reports are key and they do pretty well.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Patricia Cornwell is one of my favorite authors.  She writes so well and I love reading about the sme characters in her books. You feel like you really know them.  Sometimes they are a bit gruesome, but the story lines are always things that can really hapen.
B008M87GJK|5.0|If I want detailed and wide news coverage I go to BBC News. Well organized. Interesting comments. Easy to read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is like 100 floors but it actually has clues that help you. It's a fun puzzle game but it does challenge you some
B00C6Q6OAG|5.0|My dolls arrived. But the lip color was smeared on the packaging. Called Mattel, they're sending a replacement so I'm happy
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|It's fun and easy. I like easy stress free games. This is perfect. Beautiful graphics. Over all a very nice and wonderful game
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I hardly don't have time to read the Bible during the day. So at night before I go to sleep I use my kindle fire and load my Bible application and read, study the Bible. Love the devotionals and the reading plans they have.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This movie was so entertaining and had a great cast. It was so clever and funny- we loved it and would recommend it to anyone.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I love this tv series as they have a lot of neat technology and the CGI is incredible.  I recommend this series highly.
B004P8A7J2|1.0|Though highly acclaimed by critics, this movie is unwatchable. It is depressing and vulgar, and it has no redeeming virtues.
B0094K1PW4|4.0|This is an exciting movie and lots of fun to watch.  Steven Spielberg does great movies with kids.  This has the some similarities to ET where the Feds are the aggressive bad guys and the kids save the day.  Spielberg always has his young actors swearing, and this is no exception.  One of the adults gets high on pot and uses the &#34;F&#34; word, which was only used once but totally unnecessary.  I really wish he wouldn't do that but I guess it is his signature.  I don't use that language, so I do find it offensive.  Overall, a fun movie, but watch out for the kids swearing off and on if you find that stuff not up to your standards.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Loved it when it came out; appreciate it even more now. No wasted scenes/dialogue, good acting and use of humor.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I greatly enjoy this game.  I choose to use the relatively simple format -- I only use one suit -- and although you don't always win, it is always a challenge.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's been a long time since I've found a good escape game that I loved! This game kept my interest and I finished all available levels in one sitting just because I didn't want to stop playing. Sad there's only 10 levels but I hope they do come out with more because I would definitely continue to play this game!
B00756GRUE|4.0|Funny, this is a good case where if you really spend a little time reading the reviews, you will get what you expect.<br /><br />Reviewer says:  The watch is beautiful and this is correct, the pictures do not do this watch justice.  Gorgeous blue with bcak and silver in the face..beautiful.<br /><br />Reviewer says:  The watch is big.  I agree, it's a hefty piece, but not terribly so and I like the size.  Perfect for a medium size or larger wrist without being obnoxious.<br /><br />Reviewer says:  The wristband is cheap.  (actually, several said this)  Yes, the wristband is cheap feeling but with a good clasp.  I think they could have gone with a heavier and slightly wider.  Overall though, since the watch is pretty heavy, a lighter band keeps you from leaning to the left when you walk.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great watch and were it for a better band, I would give 5 stars.
B004UID2LC|1.0|As everybody has said it has gave course and this is true I recommend before any app purchase check the reviews my 9 year old cousin downloaded this on her kindle fire and we had to get rid of her kindle because of viruses and beside that the app was slow and full of malware and viruses so I please recommend you so not buy this app
B0083Z614S|5.0|This classic piece of literature will stand the test of time. It still has such a storyline for all ages. Love love love it!!!
B0006GANOQ|5.0|I LOVE This Movie! It's so face paced and awesome. Keanu Reeves is awesome as the main character, Dennis Hopper is Phenomenal as The Bad Guy, Sandra Bullock is even good as The Chick who drives The Bus with a bomb on board. This Movie is Action Packed, Suspenseful and overall just one word of description. GREAT! \\"Pop Quiz Hot Shot!\\" Awesome Line.
0062255657|5.0|This is a wonderfully (in the full sense of the word) book.  Dark and deep.  Illusive, yet familiar.<br />It very much reminds me of the best of the darker books by Diana Wynne Jones and that is huge praise! She is, in my opinion, one of the best writes of fantasy.<br /><br />Have you mind stretched--read this book
B0095ZQ36G|3.0|Since this was a \\"full price\\" book with over 1,000 reviews, the majority of them 5 star I was sure this would be a great read.  Perhaps it's me.  I fond it OK, certainly enjoyable, but 5 stars?  No.
B007VTUYWW|4.0|Even my husband sat through this again, and it is because of the presence Angelina Jolie brings to the big screen.  Her Lara Croft character is amusing, scary gorgous, provocative, lively and plain FUN!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Funny show!  A little sappy at the end, but you should expect that.  Some great lines and laugh out loud moments.  More than worth my time to watch!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I LOVE this game. First HOG that I've tried and I am hooked! The tasks are entertaining and challenging (I like that you can choose the level of the game--this helps if you're a more advanced user). Graphics are great, it works amazing on my Kindle Fire HD.
B00AKO93JK|4.0|I have several of these alone, but the complete package makes for a great 10 to 30 minute workout.  Lots of time-under-tension for most exercises.  Not a head-splitting workout, but a great phone app.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by how easy it was to watch this movie on my computer. Well- done, all around.
B003BWERF8|5.0|If you want to make an older iPod Bluetooth, this does the job. Easy to pair, no problem at all.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|Demi does a really good job belting out these tunes. I love Heart Attack. Whole album is very good. Can't go wrong with this one. Top rating.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like it because you can Cary it wherever you go plus it is very fun<br />it is the best game ever
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This is not your normal \\"Oh my God! ZOMBIES! RUN!\\" kind of book, and it's all the better because of that fact.  It's simply an after action report given in the form of collected interviews from those who survived the Worldwide zombie outbreak (World War Z).  The book describes the effects on the World's population in a time of crisis.  I've  read/listened (please don't cheat yourself by only reading/listening to the abridged version) this book 5 or 6 times and I'm still impressed by the creativity and how well written the book is.  Well done Max Brooks.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The very best mystery/courtroom drama I have read in years.  Engrossing from beginning to end.  It was my first by this author, but I'll be reading more.
B000TERLEK|5.0|Coldplay collection complete! Like that the album is safe in the cloud. All my old stuff (pre-cloud) is unknown. I've begun to enjoy this artist more and more! Mellow, rhythmic.....just what you need sometimes!
B00CHSPB8Y|3.0|It was a to glitchy. Got tired of it after a few times. I wouldn't recommend this game unless you are really bored.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|This was the best notepad available (at the time) for my Kindle Fire, then they changed it.  Now it requires you to log in using a WiFi connection, which is fine if you have an available signal 24-7.  If you don't, which is usually the case when you're out and about, then you can't access any of your notes.  You can't even try to make a note if there is no WiFi signal.  Even if you have a signal you have to log in before you can do anything and if you forget your password and try to retrieve it through the app it won't allow you to.<br /><br />Overall it's great if you have a 24-7 WiFi connection, if you don't then pass this up.  I gave up and deleted the app after several attempts on my home pc to try and set up a password and it failed.
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|This is my favorite game but is very expensive as you need to buy glu coins for everything (3200) for $99.99 no way plus after the latest update it became very slow and I have some problems with achievements like collecting the artifacts something that I did but still nothing hope they can fix this and reduce the glu coins cost or improve the drop.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|I got this mostly for my 11yr old but I tried it anyways and it was great, just like the original on Sega Dreamcast.  The controls took some getting used to but before you finish the first zone you'll have it nailed down.  Highly recommended :D
B00957T6X6|5.0|Such a engrossing epic that invokes every emotion possible. Cannot wait to see how this epic tale plays itself out.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Kind of an easy game to play once you get the hang of it.  Got it for my Kindle Fire (not the HD Fire).  The only complaint is that their is a lack of instructions so I was spending points to buy stuff on the game (not real money) that I couldn't use yet.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I love this calculator because of the large numbers and large key pad. The chance of my fat fingers hitting the incorrect key is minimal.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Very well done movie, lot's of holes and a little weak (in my humble opinion) on the here's how aliens ended here promise but still a great movie in a world lacking in good science fiction
B0092YO8C6|5.0|My granddaughter loves the Disney channel singers.  You can't beat the price.  $5 is a really good price to add to her music collection.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|I have to say I think that though this was a good season per say this show has &#34;Jumped the shark&#34; and I most likely will not get next season
B009VSW15Y|4.0|This item is nice to have.  I recommend it for those who use their kindle fire for more than just reading.  I have been very happy with how well this works on my kindle fire.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Awesome app! I have it on everything!! My PC, phone, laptop, kindle. Best note app ever! I have everyone I work with using it! And it keeps getting better, always adding new features
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Loved this book! I loved the structure of the interviews and the way Brooks told the story of the zombie war through the perspectives of so many people. Couldn't put it down!
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I LOVE this editor...I can do so much with it I'm not much of a photographer,but this made me feel like one...
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Picoult's use of ordinary characters begins an unbelievable tale of love, commitment, shared by two upper middleclass families who seemed to have all the makings of the most fortunate in all aspects.  The reader can easily identify with the tasks which needed to be done within each family during the story. As the plot thickens, you cannot help but wonder why, how and/or could this really happen.  This is a real page turner.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It's a good game, but it would be much more fun if I was younger.  I would recommend it for ages 5 to 13
B003D81NVQ|5.0|Just awesome. Walt is a pure bad ass. This show is so addicting my girlfriend is late for work because we keep watch another episode.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|because I love the challenge of beating it.  It makes you use your mind, which needs to be active and alert.  I recommend this game to anyone who needs to keep their mind alert.  It's quite challenging.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It was good but it is not as good as regular minecraft for pc or xbox but was good overall so i kind of liked but kind of not but 4 stars anyway was kind of expensive but fairly good
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really like this game.  It's quite challenging and entertaining.  I have a hard time to stop playing it and go to bed.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I would have to say that this game is definitely worth playing it could use some adjustments such as building rotation but as a whole it is a lot of fun.
B00AALX5SI|4.0|It was a fun movie to watch!  Katy seems like a very dedicated artist who wants very much to please her fans.  You get a good behind the scenes look at what goes on at her concerts.
B000BISBDY|5.0|The music is timeless. I plan to enjoy this CD for many more years to come - especially when I take my long distance roadtrips.
B005VPXNV2|4.0|I haven't seen this movie in years, but I was just as creeped out as the first time I watched it.  Annie reminds me of my whack-job of a boss, so that makes it even more disturbing. It will definitely hold your attention to the very end.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|This is not like the other HO games I have played before. The little I was able to play,was different...but like most,the free part didn't last to long. That's why I gave it only 3 stars.<br />Later on I may use my points to get the rest of this game.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|Good book hard to read at first but stay with it , it really gets good. You'll be glad you did.
B00A6I87UQ|5.0|I bought myself a second copy, added a B&N protective cover to keep with me at all times in the car.  Never know when you may need it.  It's really a lot in a small package, there is nothing wrong with the big ones out there, but this is so handy and at times you just don't want to have to have a separate table just for the atlas.
B004J713JW|5.0|Assume Concert, well recorder, great video. Many Guest extra artist including Paul McCartney performing Let It Be, I Want To Hold Your Hand and more, Stephen Tyler performing Walk This Way, Tony Bennett performing New York State Of Mind. and John Mellencamp performing Pink Houses.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I recieved it new, and everything was well in order, including packaging and disc status. I suggest this movie to fellow geeks everywhere!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I like a good challenge. And this app delivered. I have bad head and I am always looking for ways to challenge myself...W
B004J4WNL2|5.0|The writing was clear, direct and easy to follow for a layman.  At times I felt as though Susan was speaking about me directly when referring to the tempermant, energy ependitures for the introvert and the pseudo-extrovert.  At other times, I recognized some family members and former students and clients.  I am recommending this book to my daughter, who is also a teacher.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved the Kitchen House.  The characters were wonderful and they brought you into their lives.  I was riveted to the book and read it in two days.  I felt as though I was living in their time.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This really is a great way to play magic. The interface is good, the gameplay is fantastic too. Runs well on my kindle fire hd. Looks great too!
B0084TWN9K|5.0|Alice Munro at her best, need I say more. The last batch of stories are not quite fiction, based on autobiographical details but interesting nonetheless if you are a fan, as I am.
B003U51EE8|4.0|I enjoy watching this different series. I may watch 1 episode a week. I will watch the whole series in the future.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER SINCE TEMPLE RUN!!!!!!!!!!! It is easier but fun it give you something to do when u r bored.
030789701X|5.0|I bought this product with the sole intention of never opening it, and so I haven't. It's enormous and beautiful. Perfect for a collector and someone who just wants a complete guide.
B00CHI5B7A|3.0|The movie did not keep my attention. It was boring at times. I would not recommend this to a friend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I play this game as much as possible! It is so much fun! My grandma and I play different games and tell each other which ones  to get and not to get. This one shes getting!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Great story of the challenges of life and the victory in the end of those who do what is right.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I am just now discovering Downton Abbey.  It is good TV.  Good TV is hard to come by,  The characters have depth and the story is full of twists and turns.
B00C7JGDBW|5.0|While this story could have been somewhat better, there was quite a bit that was great. Oscar Diggs is a con artist and a magician for a small circus,he does have big plans as one day he hopes to be truly great.Unfortunately, his act is good enough that it causes a little girl to plead with him to make her walk again and his act fails on the stage when he reveals that it isn't possible. He leaves back to his wagon and meets with the true love of his life, only to discover she is to marry another. While their parting is amicable, it is hurried because the circus strong man is after him in a jealous rage and he makes for a balloon and manages to escape by the proverbial skin of his teeth and a cut rope--into the grasp of a Kansas Twister. He manages to survive and finds himself in Oz where he meets Theodora. While there he discovers he is the subject of a prophecy, that he is to face the Wicked Witch and ultimately rule Oz as the King. What he doesn't know, is that one of his greeters, Evanora is the Wicked Witch, and while the gold offered is extremely tempting, he isn't sure he can do what they think he can. He finally meets Glinda, thinking her the Wicked Witch only to discover the truth about the Witch -and he and his allies must find a way to defeat her,when the threat becomes double when Theodora finds her heart broken and become Wicked.It is then that Oscar learns that a good Con is the best way to defeat evil and he makes plans to become the best illusionist ever.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I am so grateful to finally hear something different then the pop music that seems to be all over the place. Adele's voice is somewhat old fashioned but it works, despite her young age. When you hear her voice you start to think she is older than she actually is. Adele has a way of bringing you into the music your listening to, so that you actually feel the song, just like you should when listening to incredible music.<br /><br />However, Adele's music won't be for everyone. If you are the type of person who is die hard only like Rap or hip hop or has to have bubble gum pop and nothing else, it might not be the best choice for you.<br /><br />I recommend having an open mind and really giving her a chance, you might surprise yourself with how much you like a new genre of music and how much you like an artist who has a true and real talent. Adele has one of those voices that is just magical and I hope that we see much more of her in the future because we needed an artist like this nowadays. It's great to finally have something that isn't like everything else out there.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I have played 100floors and found this game more fun. I like being able to explore an entire room. These levels are challenging without becoming frustrating. Looking forward to more levels.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|This series is great. I enjoyed the story line and the characters are interesting. I also like the fashions from the time period.
1781162646|5.0|Reading this book made me want to find a hole-in-the-wall amusement park and go work there for the summer.<br /><br /> What a well paced narrative and fun characters to spend your time with.  I didn't need the murder mystery and almost could have done without the supernatural element (applied with a generous amount of restraint, I might add). I just loved reading about these people and the time they spent together.<br /><br />A deft human touch and just the right amount of menace makes this one a keeper.  Thanks, Uncle Steve.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I had been waiting so long for another book from this author.  I wasn't disappointed.  Couldn't put it down!  Now I have to wait for his next book.
B00008GKEG|5.0|Got this set for my husband, a huge Beatle fan, and he loves it! There are videos he has never seen before. Sound quality is amazing, the stories told are great, and the music...Well, it's the Beatles, \\"I have to say no more...\\"
B008220BP2|5.0|First off let me say that I first saw this movie while it was playing in the theater and had already decided to add it to my collection. This movie is a somewhat different spin on the traditional zombie movie and I really liked the premise. It is a well crafted story with a strong cast and even has a happy ending which is pretty unusual for a zombie movie to say the least. I highly recommend this movie to all horror fans and especially zombie movie fans. Pop a bowl of popcorn and enjoy!
B006BAEQB2|4.0|Philippa Gregory doesn't disappoint .  You get a birds eye view of everyday life of the ruling class.  It's all about power and who can be used to attain it.  Maybe it is not so good to be queen or King.
B00C7DGRL4|5.0|I for one love this movie, it's an interesting take on the whole Hansel and Gretel story but with bigger guns and more action. A good cast and interesting characters as you would expect, in this version the characters believe in getting more than even with witches after their less than friendly encounter with one during their childhood. I highly recommend this movie if you are an action fan or you like somewhat twisted versions of old fairy tales and yes, I'm both! Check it out!
B000T433CO|5.0|One of the best Christmas films ever! I watch it over and over!!! And it makes me cry every time!
1435122968|5.0|I picked this up hoping for a one-stop-shop book of Lovecraft's works that looks beautiful on the shelf and feels substantial in the hand.  I got that and more!  I was delighted that the stories were printed in chronological order with a short, but informational introduction, thus enabling one to witness the development of Lovecraft's writing from his earliest short stories, through his graphic horror stage, to his later Cthulu mythos stage and beyond.  With a nice, concise introduction by S.T. Joshi, this book has everything a Lovecraft bibliophile could ask for and at a very reasonable price.  Be sure to get the one with the purple ribbon to avoid the errors present in the earlier edition (the one with the gold ribbon), and you'll be more than elated.<br /><br />As a side note, this is the first of the Leatherbound Classics that I purchased.  I have been pleased enough to purchase several more for my reading and collecting enjoyment.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Got hooked immediately after watching the first episode.  Couldn't wait eventually purchased them all.  Must have for any tv series collector.
B007Y6DUHI|5.0|Read this book, it will change your life.  I read it over and over again, I learn something different each time through.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|It is kind of boring wish it had way more levels, and was a little more challenging and was more colorful.
B001F6TXME|5.0|A good, reliable remote release cord is important for quality photos. If you want clarity and focus, it is imperative to use a cable release cord.<br /> I know through experience, a lot of times there isn't enough time to set up and use a remote release. When you do have the opportunity to take some extra time to capture a special shot, a cable release is essential.<br />This is a tool that every photographer needs in their inventory.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|I used to go to daycare and a teacher would bring his iPad in the morning and let us play games. He had this one on it and I was obsessed with it. So that is why I rated it five stars.
B007LGPSX0|5.0|It is so nice when amazon has TV shows that Netflix doesn't have. More seasons please! 90210 is the greatest bad show ever! It's like being transferred back to the 90's!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Superb fun.  Can't get enough. Challenging, yet excitingly addicting.  Challenges the mind and keeps you entertained. Great for families to play together.
B004GJXQ20|5.0|I'm now onto my second game of thrones book and loving it. It's got everything dwarfs, kings, queens, lords, sex, war, incest ..... the list goes on. The first book gets more and more interesting with each new chapter. Strongly recommend!!
B00A0ABQLM|5.0|This adapter works in my installation.  I'm not sure if USB 3.0 is required as other reviews mention, because the laptop I'm using this on has only 3.0 ports.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the game is amazing it lets you play with a lot.let's you have a good one Lamonta I told you to be a good night baby momma know what I said HAPPY NEW YEAR BEST FRIEND printable labels and shit you want me to text back on a all veggie nd baked beans mashed and shit you can get it rolling yuh will have a good time to sit here and shit bout of a sudden and shit for running a fever doesn't matter how much for that bond between the
B005KAH7QU|3.0|Three stars for not developing Hanna's motivations going forward - more flashbacks would have been helpful.  Great story though - enjoyed the premise.
B0081KZ20E|5.0|Just re-read this after more than 30 years and it is even better than I remembered. It is one of the most gripping, entertaining thrillers ever written and is not dated at all.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|You will want to watch it again.  Funny all the way through.  Love Barbara in anything so maybe we are biased.  Even so, it is a good pick for an afternoon or early evening movie as the light mood carries over.
0802473156|1.0|You may want to have a contrary voice to the list of reviews.  I want to show my respect and appreciation to the author and the positive reviewers.  I want to acknowledge that it is not silly to simply express what you need to a partner, and to simply listen and provide what the other person needs.<br /><br />But that is not worth the price of the book.<br /><br />Look at the on-line free questionnaire at 5lovelanguages.org.  Take the test for free.  Then, see what you think.<br /><br />The test is self explanatory.  Save the book money.<br /><br />That said, I found the assessment tool to be, frankly, silly.<br /><br />SAVE YOUR MONEY.  Ask a friend or find a coach.
030758836X|4.0|i was hesitant to write a review simply because i might give away too much; however, Gone Girl is quite an experiential read. Gillian Flynn is an author I think we can trust.
0393343405|5.0|The story is interesting and well researched, but what makes this book exceptional is the skill of the author in weaving a complex tale that tells as much about the era as about the book written by Lucretius.<br /><br />The quality of the writing made me look for other books by the author and purchase an audio copy of \\"Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare\\".  If he can do so much with the search for a poem by an ancient Roman what did he do with his book about the time of Shakespeare?  I will soon know.
B00C3N9O9K|5.0|I had the opportunity to see this &#34;electric trio&#34; live in Louisville, KY this Spring.  Wow...don't know what else to.  The chemistry of the three was amazing to hear and to see.  The album captures it well.  RT is certainly one of the all-time greats on the guitar.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|A very entertaining film if you can get past the violence.  Christopher Waltz earned his Oscar for this excellent job
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|I recently heard about the Harry Hole books, and was determined to read them in order (not an easy feat, as most of you know).  My patience paid off, as I just finished \\"The Bat\\" on my kindle, and now I'm ready for the others! Of course, the actual second book in series, \\"The Cockroaches\\" (according the Mr. Nesbo's website) is not available in US yet, but the consensus of reviewers seems to be that reading Redbreast and then Nemesis is worth it, so I'm game.  I'm an avid lover of Reacher, Davenport, Bosch, Gabriel Allon, and others--and so I was excited to hear that Mr. Nesbo's books are, to many readers, on a par with these great series. \\"The Bat\\" was a good read, although not fabulously complex or exciting.  I was glad to get some of the early backstory to Harry Hole, though.  According to many reviews of some of the other books in series, as well as this book, it sounds like subsequent books are a little more complex, so I'm looking forward to reading more.  My only pet peeve about \\"The Bat\\" was the sloppy use of violence, with no realistic consequences (not to mention any real connection to or furthering of the storyline).  Poor Harry---cracked ribs, concussions, smashed face, but none of these injuries seemed to slow him down in any way.  Really??? Poetic license that is annoying, but otherwise, I'm still with ya, Harry!
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I think I purchased this when it was on a discounted rental rate.  It turned out to be a lot better than I expected and a really enjoyable watch.  Josh Brolin and Sean Penn turned in excellent performances.
B00BESJYAY|4.0|Filmed in Santa Cruz, CA. Kind of a karate kid on surf boards. A true story. A small glimpse into the life of a surfer.
B00C7KXUOE|4.0|I really couldn't see this as the basis for a television series.  I was wrong.  It's visually beautiful and very well done.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|So well written I will be very sad when I finish it.  Thankfully, it is on my kindle so I will be re-reading it at some point.
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|I had been meaning to watch this.  It's a complicated film with some really interesting ideas being put out there.  The performances were first rate.  That being said, when the film ended I really felt that I needed to watch it again to really appreciate it.  I decided to purchase the book and haven't gotten to it yet.  I wonder if it would have been less bewildering if I had read the book first?
B008133MDK|5.0|I love this show! This show was brought to my attention by a friend, and I have to say, it's now one of my favorites...can't wait for the next season!
B00COHAUD4|4.0|There were mixed reviews on this and I can understand why.  I love del Toro films and decided to give it a shot.  The plot and acting were very good, the special effects not so much surprisingly.  I still enjoyed the film, it just could have been so much better.
B003F9G8B8|5.0|If you are into history, like myself, especially about South Africa, you will most likely enjoy the movie. I loved it. Many films go so horribly awry about great historical figures and/or moments, but this one hits the mark without being treacle or doing a disservice to Mandiba, the Springboks, and South Africa.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|While reading Neil Gaiman's latest book, THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE, I kept thinking about all it had in common with books like CORALINE or THE GRAVEYARD BOOK. It is a slim volume (coming in at under 200 pages), there is a child protagonist, and the story is told with an almost whimsical, fairy-tale like narration. But unlike those, this book is for adults, not younger readers.<br /><br />It's not because THE OCEAN AT THE END OF THE LANE contains sex and violence (although it does) or that younger readers wouldn't understand the book (because they would), but because only adults are likely to appreciate the themes of the book: how childhood memories fade with age; the changes in interests, focus, and priorities; and how the sense of \\"home\\" changes after you've moved several times in your life.<br /><br />This is the story of small tragedies becoming larger ones, and how we bounce back from them, or try to. It's the story of the protagonist meeting three women-Lettie, Ginnie, and Old Mrs. Hempstock-and how they try to help him in his time of need. They offer perfect food, a sympathetic ear and a smile, and seemingly unrivaled knowledge. One gets a sense their farm has been there forever, and the universe grew up around it and them. But that's not true, they came from across the ocean. Then again, that ocean is a pond behind their house. And like AMERICAN GODS, there is a magical world magic lying just under the surface of our world. And that magic seems at once miraculous and everyday, as only Gaiman writes it.<br /><br />Anyone who had reminisced with a family member will know that no two people remember the exact same things the exact same way. Something happened, but we filter it differently, both in the short term and long term. That sense of reality versus interpretation, the real versus unreal, and the real versus not-quite-real all come into play with this book. The fact that some of the details from this book have been taken from Gaiman's real childhood, while others were made up, adds another layer to the duality of this book.<br /><br />Not only did I enjoy the themes of this book, I also enjoyed the voice of the protagonist. Gaiman has a talent for writing children's voices, but this unnamed protagonist's voice is also sometimes filtered through the mind of the adult man who is telling the story. As the story unfolds, the man comments on the memories, even as he relates them. Not only is this an interesting balance to pull off, but the protagonist (both old and young) tells the story with such honesty and love and fear that I couldn't help but be moved by it.<br /><br />There are a couple moments are a bit too cute for my liking, but they are minor quibbles I had with with was otherwise a lovely, if very short, book. In fact, this was originally supposed to be a short story, but it grew just a bit too big. I almost wish it had grown a bit more. It still felt too short to be a proper novel in my mind.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a great summer read. If you don't finish it on the beach, you (like me) will probably find yourself carrying it with you at all times to finish it as soon as you can (of course, this will not come as a surprise to anyone who is a Gaiman fan). But unlike most summer reads, this book will have you thinking back to your childhood, recalling memories long forgotten and the child you used to be. And that's Gaiman's real talent: using fairy tales to trick you into thinking about big ideas and causing your heart to swell with emotion., while others were made up, adds another layer to the duality of this book.<br /><br />Not only did I enjoy the themes of this book, I also enjoyed the voice of the protagonist.

B00BHHIWQO|5.0|The game loads up quickly and so far, I've had no issues with crashing. The game is fun to play. The only problem I have is, I can't beat my wife's high score. Bummer!!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|thisnapp is great.during car trips and just to play around with. easy to get pearls and to peveel up. perfect, for auntie's to use for an hour in the middle of a &quot; remodel &quot;
B004SOR4H6|4.0|this game sucks you cant do anything at all there is no play button there is nothing on it except two stupid buttons that are like a help button and a survey entry thing its so stupid and this is a failed attempt at a joke. Twitter is amazing, the app runs great when you have a decent Internet connection (which I don't), and performs well.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I love the graphics and how easy it is to learn.  the sounds are great too.I just wished there was more ways to earn lives...
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Wow...just wow. This is a great book. I couldn't put it down once i picked it up. I cried so much. Wow
B00CW665VI|5.0|I will admit I have been skeptical when buying books lately. They have really good reviews but when I read them, I am scratching my head wondering how the book got such great reviews. Tangled definitely earned all of the 5 star reviews that it has received. I love that the author gave us a book from the male perspective. I am sooooo tired of the whiny females in the books that I have been reading. I also liked that it started out in present day but went back to give some back story then went to the future. it was refreshing to read a book that actually made me LOL. I am looking forwarding to reading more books in this series.
B00122LXTM|5.0|Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too... cant go wrong get this doit just do it
B00DJW0OBQ|1.0|I love this book, so downloaded it to my kindle, and the typos and spacing make it ridiculous to read. Some sentences cut off and never finish, there's extra words and random forward slashes all thought a space big enough a truck could drive through it! AWFUL!!!!!

B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really good, makes you think but can be frustrating at times when you can't figure out a piece of the puzzle!

1476733953|5.0|I'm rounding up from 4.5 stars but this book is worth reading. The beginning is a bit confusing until the author gives you enough information to understand what has happened. Very interesting event happens fairly early on, and this is what kept me going. The next section of book (maybe 20%) was less interesting to me, and I nearly gave up but then the next major event/reveal happens and I was hooked. The rest of the book is basically two sets of stories, one I wasn't terribly interested in and one I was very interested in.<br /><br />The book ends with an understanding of something and a bit open ended (there is a 3rd book that is supposed to take the story further). I learned the second book deals with the events leading up to this book and was very interested in learning more.<br /><br />There are throngs of reviews for this book, so I don't know how helpful mine will be, especially trying to avoid giving anything away. If you like Sci-fi and mysteries slowly unraveled leading to move questions you want answers to this is your book.
B005HSL626|5.0|Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too... cant go wrong get this doit just do it
B000FC130E|5.0|This book is hard to categorize, but was very good.  If you like off the wall fantasy and Sci-fi you should enjoy this one.
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too... cant go wrong get this doit just do it
B00BBI9WD6|4.0|This one was not bad.  it had a pretty good back story the Graysons were more interesting than the regular characters.  Still a veiled copy of the French revolution  and Napoleonic war.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too... cant go wrong get this doit just do it
B0020BUWX2|5.0|I wasn't sure at first about this book but wow. I really loved it and felt for this character, Mia. I highly recommend this read.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too... cant go wrong get this doit just do it
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book just didn't go anywhere. Even after all the 50 shades rip offs I stuck with it. But this book never reached a climax.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too... cant go wrong get this doit just do it
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Out of the three books this one is by far my favorite but the last couple of chapters made me give it 2 stars. I don't want to give details because I don't want to ruin it but I really hated the ending. In my opinion it didn't settle the love triangle between katniss, Peeta, and Gale very well and what happened to the other characters in the end wasn't as concrete as I would have liked. Most of you will enjoy it probably. I am just a very hard critic.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too... cant go wrong get this doit just do it
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Just as good as all the rest of the Sigma novels  I would recommend this book to everyone who likes this style of writing.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too... cant go wrong get this doit just do it
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Enjoyed playing this game. My kids even got into it! Can't wait for more rooms!!  It starts out easy and gets harder each time you complete a level.
B0051XQI84|5.0|Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too... cant go wrong get this doit just do it
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Love these books (as well as HBO's adaptation).  Kind of book that makes you want to read the next ASAP.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Awesome! feels like quality looks like quality and performs like it too... cant go wrong get this doit just do it
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Love this game! Keeps my brain spinning! My hubby &amp; I are always playing &amp;can't get enough!! I totally recommend this game!
B00AR83PN4|1.0|Slow download to my kindle fire. Different take on match three. Played five times and uninstalled. Too hard to play. Light yellow and dark yellow color too close. Controls not responsive. Very frustrating to try to play.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|they heat up the pages like you can hope to someday very lucky girl cant wait for the next book
B003SI9WYG|5.0|I watch because we played the music from this in band a schooli love this movie great for the whole family
0684859106|5.0|One of the biscuit recipes from this book has become a staple. I've converted them over to gluten and dairy free but they remain as delicious as the original recipe.
B000GWE44U|5.0|So scary I fell lol not must watch for Horror fans So amazon makes watching movies great and easy boom
B00B6U63ZE|5.0|Detailed methods for communicating with executive level management and how to learn the culture and political structure of a company/management team. If you are making the advancement from non-management to management, or to executive level management, this is a practical first step read.
B0094M2SCI|5.0|Werewolves fighting against vampires it doesn't get any better.  And then you through in guns with special bullets<br />Can't wait to see the other three movies  I recommend this
B00D2K40WY|4.0|fun but repetitive.... it gets old if you do not order the full game. my daughter seems to love it still.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Playing on Galaxy S III with 1080 display,  quite crisp lookin :)  I've played with it a lot more than I thought I would lol
B008JFUPK8|5.0|I thought this was a GREAT movie!  New Superman Henry Cavill did an awesome job.  Cannot wait for the next one.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love watching Suits and could watch it repeatedly. The characters seem like people we know in real life. The music is upbeat and cool, just like New York iCity is. Thanks to Amazon Prime for offering it.
B009LK6JS2|5.0|The game is really fun but it needs an f-4,and a heliplain but other than that it is really fun
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|THIS APP IS AMAZING.  I NEVER SEEN AN EXERCISE PROGRAM THAT COULD BE SO TAILOR FIT TO WHAT YOU WANT AT THE MOMENT YOU NEED TO USE IT.  CHOOSE WHICH BODY PART, CHOOSE HOW MANY MINUTES AND GO FOR IT.  IT APPEARS BASIC, BUT I WAS SURPRISED HOW SORE MY MUSCLES WERE AFTER JUST DOING THE FULL BODY WORKOUT FOR 10 MINUTES EACH MORNING.  I WAS IN BOOT CAMP AND CAN TELL YOU, THEY ARE BOOT CAMP TYPE EXERCISES, THEY BURN, AND YOU ARE SORE THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS.  EVEN IF YOU CHOOSE THE SAME WORKOUT EVERYDAY, IT'S ALWAYS MIXED WITH DIFFERENT ROUTINES, I NEVER SEEMED TO GET THE SAME ONE TWICE.  IT'S LIKE HAVING A PERSONAL TRAINER....AND I CAN'T BELIEVE IT WAS FREE!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|The Hunger Games is OK. Not the greatest book ever, but it is an easy read.  I was pressured to read this book.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game.  I could spend hours on this game.  The graphics and sound are terrific.  The price is right.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Good game to play. Easy to learn and you gain points quickly. Upgrades are a bit expensive though, especially the players. But if you play a lot, it's no biggie.
B00BTHWFBK|3.0|A good album that should have been great.  If you are a Sabbath fan, go ahead, buy it.  But you will immediately notice the lackluster drum playing.  When I purchased this, I had no idea Ward was not on it.  By the second song, I knew something was amiss.  Looking through the credits revealed Bill Ward was not drumming, it was that obvious.<br />  This album had the potential for best record of the decade and, instead, came off as just another hard rock album.  Deeply disappointed by the band's decision to exclude Ward.<br />  Did I mention I was extremely disappointed?<br />  But go ahead and buy it if you want to...<br />It bothered me to write this as I am probably one of Sabbath's greatest fans.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This works well. I am happy with the results when using this cable. I would highly recommend it at this time.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Another great Downton season. The finale left me angry, though anxious for next season. Haven't they been through enough already?
B001NERPHS|5.0|This item came quickly and as promised, A brand new CD in shrink wrap, packaged to withstand any clumsy postal worker around.<br />Love the music, love the deal, it was a smooth transaction all around. Go back to a simpler time and enjoy this CD like I do.
B000VOC90Y|5.0|the material, zips are of very high quality and as a whole very stylish. Just the one was looking for and worth the money spent.
B00AOCLWF6|5.0|This is the best television show I've ever seen.  I even did one of my public speaking speeches on it.  I love the story, the characters and the effects.  This show is very well done!
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Rollins has a way of creating fiction around truth that is nothing short of amazing and will keep you thinking long after you finish reading.
B0098VXN2Y|3.0|This movie was ok. It still Hollywoodized pregnancy. There are some funny parts. I'm glad I watched it but I don't think I'll watch it again.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is great for horse lovers.i think kids of all ages could play it.me and my sister love it.the best part is that it's for free.the graphics are great too.it's sooo life like.if your not to sure about buying let me tell you it's a great game.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Cute movie with a little bit of action, but a great message. Fun characters that keep my five year old interested and entertained.
B00CV5ZPA2|2.0|For such a worthless and obnoxious human such as kanye we all should no support his music. His lyrics are nothing but trash. Rap people (artist is not worthy here) are known to degrade women, this guy pushes that line. He is also a very racist individual. Its socially unnaceptable to use certain language in public, but kanye, a man in a very influential position, chooses to boost racism in america. Why people support his bad habits I will never know.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|I came upon this show after it was canceled and done, and I got hooked. This is a very interesting concept though very it has an equally dangerous potential. Even with the knowledge of it's demise after a 2nd season, I'd recommend watching it!
B003VANOFY|3.0|This headset is amazingly comfortable, the sound is crisp clear and the 7.1 mode is outstanding. BUT, due to the limitations of the hardware design, the headset has very horrible mic quality. If you're looking for a headset to use for recording and making vids, then this is NOT for you.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Got hooked right away, got frustrated and angry with the main characters (as should be), then at the end, undecided as to how I feel about the conclusion.  Will definitely read more of Flynn's novels.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is a must read for all! Great story, characters, and overall good read. Absolutely love this book. It was almost sad when I got to the last page.
B002LC8HF0|4.0|Loved the series, loved the way minor characters stepped up to the plate to do what was required, liked the ending but it was a bit easy.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|The best part about it is that the characters are very true to the look of the characters in the comic books.  It's not like Transformers where the characters look nothing like what we grew up with.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|I just happen to be pitching my start-up to investors and after reading Pitch Anything I incorporated a bit of what I learned and got investor interest at the very next pitch. If you're looking for investment from angels or venture capitalists this book will definitely help. I think it would also be good if you're in the business of selling 'solutions' via a consulting firm or marketing agency.
B001AFF25W|4.0|I thought it was pretty good.  It did motivate me. I've always been a procrastinator.  Changed my habits. Good read.
B009R659L8|5.0|Great book! Keep you guessing until the end. Once you start reading, you can't put it down!! Another good mystery by Mary Higgins Clark!!!
B004CFBMRY|4.0|Interesting book, intersting story about Caballo Blanco and the Raramuri. Didn´t like author trying to sell minimalist and barefoot running.
0451197968|4.0|This book did not stop once to catch its breath or let me catch mine. It was a breathless race to the end. Best to start this one at the beginning of the day and not before bed.
B002SEQ8ZC|5.0|Item in excellent condition. Enjoyed the movie and love the extra gifts. Brand new item that will be enjoyed for years to come
B008602KQI|5.0|Very intense and well thought out.  Can't wait for the next movie in the series, Catching Fire.  It holds the same type of interest for me as another movie called Avatar.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|This movie was a disgrace to the Die Hard sires. They should have stopped but I guess the producers new the could make a buck no matter what they put out. Bruce should be embarrassed.
B00DGMVJAO|1.0|no action, lame story, and was a waste of my money. I basically fell asleep because it was so boring.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This is one of the best book series I've read.  Intriguing!  Makes a woman want more and stirs up &#34;feelings&#34;.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I thought this was a great book when I looked up something I was able to find it.so good! The end.
B0090P98Z4|4.0|I bought this for my nephew, but I. Am the one who plays it all the time. A great game.
B000SSPL2Q|4.0|Very good recording! Still I like Paavo Berglund's conducting a little bit more. The orchestra is playing great and for example symphony no 2 was excellent!
B0031RS58I|3.0|Different enough to keep me interested and quite a good story line. Keep the stories coming please - just rigt for a good red but nothing too heavy!!!
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|What a charming movie. Often well received plays translate well, but this was exceptional. Dustin Hoffman (who knew) did a superb job and the cast was exceptional. Tom Courtenay reminded me that I need to see the Dresser again, and Michael Gambon was over the top. As was Billy Connolly. Dame Maggie, planning to leave acting, a shame for there is so many fine performances we are seeing now. From here in Quartet to Downton to Exotic Marigold. More please.
B00A7YZ1KI|5.0|Loved it but am so sad that there will be no more!<br />I have followed from te beginning and glad Sookie has respite, albeit for a while.<br />Good read, but I don't want the stories to stop! I have looked forward to the next installment for soooo long.....
B001QE1BDY|1.0|I ordered this movie along with all the other James Bond movies. That is 20. This is the second to the last movie and the only one I ordered from Movie Mars. We are just now getting to watch this movie. When we wanted to play the movie we received an error message that stated &#34;this movie is not for your region&#34;; &#34;eject this movie from your machine it is not for your region.&#34; When I contacted MovieMars they said they could not take returns. This was a 10 dollar loss for me, but I hope I save many of you from a loss. Do Not Order from this place of business. They do not care about their customers and send out defective movies.
B00BMQDM10|4.0|If you are like me and just want to read something light and feel good (at the end) this is for you....
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great character development. Great acting. Suspense, plot turns. Historical. Seems to appeal to all age groups. Can't wait till next season.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I have my Amazon Kindle account on my Kindle and my cell phone, I am constantly reading this hilarious book. You just have to love Tina Fey's humor and the way she describes things. Truly one of my favorite actresses and now writers!
B0015DWJ8W|5.0|This book wasn't about finding your stride or getting into a zen-like state during the running process. This was about finding what you require in life to be fulfilled, pursuing it with all of your energy and learning that evolving as an individual is okay. In fact it may just make you a better person.<br /><br />Only knock would be there were a few instances where there was some unintended boasting throughout the book, but still there is alot you can take away.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This is a grate game you should play it and try to beat the high score rate this game so that every one can know how flood of is
0802473156|4.0|Gary Chapman has long been a valued resource in my life to help me understand both myself and my partner in love. Looking at how we each give and receive love is a major key in truly feeling loved and working in a positive direction each day. Too often we resist love and its often due to simply not seeing what the OTHER person needs. Chapman's book also helps us understand ourselves better. The more we communicate honestly and openly our needs, the better the chances are our partner will be able to meet them. I have also learned that in some cases, relationship issues go deeper and true healing needs to occur before love can be present. I highly recommend The Healing Touch By Dave Bennett.[[ASIN:1462724639 The Healing Touch]]. Dr. Bennett's insightful and inspiring approach of how God's love can heal our hearts and inform our relationships is the true key to lasting and fulfilling relationships as God intended. Every couple should read this book! There would far fewer divorce lawyers in the world if they did.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Despite the death of some favorite characters, I totally enjoyed this season. I especially liked the development of Lady Mary.
B000I9W08I|5.0|Wonderful musical. Just as good as I remember it! The combination of Barbara Streisand and Walter Matthau is an unexpected match but their Chemistry is magical
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Not a short game to play in a retail store checkout line but perfect if you have 15 minutes for a fast pasted game. :)
B0008KLVG4|5.0|i wrote my review under the wrong movie9The Final Countdown}  sorry<br />jaws was a great movie for any age<br />just one of may outstanding movies by Speilberg
B0050DIWFC|3.0|The book was OK...I was NOT happy about the way it ended......I like closure in a book, I don't want to be kept hanging....
B00CFITJKW|4.0|This is a fun app if you know how to use it. If you do not know how to use it, then yes you will have problems. Personally I think this app is fun. The graphics aren't as detailed as some, but what do you expect for a low price, portable flight simulator? So yes, it does glitch from time to time but over all it is a pretty fun app and I give it 4/5 stars
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|What can I say... a trip down memory lane to the days when I went for a weekly run to buy comic books.<br />If you want some well done superhero action to remember your pre puberty fascinations... this is a good one.
B00AR83PN4|5.0|if I produced a game &bull; I'd sure wanna be able to connect with those that gashed me one star.  I'd want to comp them something to help make the game better.. . Like the need for better first impressions...seems like a few blew this game off rite away ...I'd like to rotate the cubes horizontally<br />Imagine opaque six sided pieces !!!  I predict a good future if you can Morph and branch....stay in touch...I be gmail under the moniker LawsonTrust<br />...you think the NsA would figure out that prestidigitation?
B00514HDNW|5.0|Somehow I'd missed reading this book. I've seen all the movies and read the screenplays of various attempts but none really touch this.  A thoughtful tale of a man trapped in a vampire plague.<br /><br />The last man in the world sits alone in his room...
0783116934|4.0|the film is stark no strong colours.it is of a true serial killer in Russia there is a high body count second highest Dr Shipman maybe the highest body count on planet earth.not gruesome. good performances by the cast
B00CIHXUG4|5.0|Amon Amarth always delivers. This one is no exception. Note after note just memorizing as the last. If you follow this band this is a definite must in your collection!
B009D0LBRO|5.0|this is the best game ever it has plenty of levels but I think potpourri is the best world in the whole game.  in adittion you can unlock 3 other characters to play with dark rayman is the best
B009GEEMLY|1.0|Long and oh yea LONG for no reason at all. This movie just dragged on... I almost kicked the chair from under me on this one. The whole move was the last 10 min. Don't waste almost 2.5 hours of torment and save yourself from this one!
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|experiments is just as fun as the original, with different physics and boxes involved; bath time is fun and challenging, and the suction cup variation very welcome
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the dicgotomy between the classes and how it is becoming less obvious.  Shirley McClain. Brilliant as always!  Can't wait for Season 4!
B00AR83PN4|4.0|Personally, this isn't a \\"let the whole world know\\" kind of game. I mean, it's fun to play but, maybe, in bursts every now and then.<br /><br />Pretty much, this game is like a 3D version of Tetris--though you only need to line up at least three like colors. You tap on the grid where you want to place the piece and can swap the boxes. Each level has a certain amount of matches needed to make before you can continue on. A plus for the game, there's instructions on gameplay and button use before you start playing--I gave the game a star for that alone.<br /><br />The graphics are OK, though I think they'd look better on a phone rather than on a tablet. There are no sounds whatsoever. The gameplay is nice and the game can get challenging. I have no issues on my kindle fire with this game. A note to those who care, there are ads for (what I assume is) the devs other game, though I don't mind as long as there's no nondeveloper ads. For $1, I would definitely say to try out this game if you enjoy puzzle games and Tetris.<br /><br />EDIT<br />Apparently, there's sound in this game. I wonder why I don't have any? I might have to redownload it...
B004LSO6YI|4.0|Not my favorite lesbian movie, but within the top five.  There's that famous long kiss and the plot I entertaining.  There are some odd video clips of couples sprinkled throughout, but those are easy to ignore.  Still high quality and well done considering the general standards of lesbian-genre films.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|seemed like if it wasn't so clitchy I might have been able to enjoy it. Great graphics, color, and characters. too bad I did not have the free option to be female... hmmm if only I could have played.. hey it was free.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|It is easy to play. You can play sudoku with out having tenor erase the number.  If u like sudoku u will love this.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Plays as it should but does not end game automatically when there are no more plays.  But, then it's FREE so it's worth downloading.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great Series! Tastefully done. I was sad to finish the series! Wish she wrote more similar books. Couldn't put it down
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Only played it a couple of times so I haven't seen it all as yet but if it's like all the other FREE ones, it will just tease me into buying the real product.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Missions are good until the only way to do them is to use real money.  Cute game but would be better if nothing REQUIRED real cash.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I enjoy the oversize keys and it's so easy to read and use, especially if  you're in a hurry for some basic answers and then as Free things go, this won't require buying the real version before it can be used and appreciated...
B009NCM248|5.0|One of my favorite Stone Sour CDs. Songs are well written and the production is top notch. I would(and have)definitely recommend.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Pretty fun game, can be a bit tough at times but thats half the fun. Definitely would recommend to friends.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|Good cast and story line, not exceptional by any means. For some reason Danny Glover did not get a credit.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Very good 3rd book in the series. I would recommend the whole series. This book carries on the storyline perfectly and keeps your interest.
B003PVPXOE|5.0|love old movies and loved being able to stream on amazon. Such a great great flick! (if youre an old movie buff)
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|There is not enough words to describe how much I love this cd. It really felt at times it could have been old studio tapes from back in the mid 70s. Ozzy's voice tho aged is still sounding good on these songs and geezer and Tony are in true fine forum.Brad had some big sticks to fill and i think overall he did a excellent job. I won't break down the songs,since other people have done that. I gotta say Damaged Soul is my stand out favorite,if it is even possible to pick out 1 song as a favorite.Overall I think the cd has a good vibe thru out.It is probaly asking to much but, wow 1 more cd like this would be awesome!!<br />Great job guys!! this cd is going on my top 10 all time favorites list.
B002MGGM9I|2.0|not awful but definitely not my favorite movie ever. But my eighteen year old daughter LOVED it so maybe im too old;)
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Good story and, of course, wonderful acting.  Not a laugh out loud storyline but a sweet and enjoyable story with candid insights into aging...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This escape game is a little easier than I usually like, but great time waster. Especially for free. Can't beat that!
B00CL68NOG|3.0|An enjoyable but only OK version of the grown child coping with the &#34;parent as a person&#34; storyline.  It touches on some good points but was somewhat predictable.  She's annoyingly intrusive at times and he's annoyingly non-communicative.  Still, so are many parent/child relationships.  Overall, not a bad way to spend an hour and a half.  Watched this for Streisand.  Wish I liked Seth Rogen more.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Entertaining and informative.  If you like rock n' roll, give this documentary a try.  Be sure to watch through the credits.
0345529057|5.0|Addicting, thrilling, etc... I just wanted to add another 5 star review. If you watch the show and are unsure about reading, just do it, you won't regret it.
B007Z9QP3K|4.0|Das Boot depicts the fear and boredom which monopolized the life of a German U-boot sailor, rather than glorifying their role in the sea war.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A little slow in the beginning but once I got into the book, I thoroughly enjoyed it.  I would recommend.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|In cloud reader, the book tended to chop a sentence or so off of the front of the page in 2 page formatting.  On the kindle and iPad, it worked fine.  But of course, this book was so good that I'd read right through the battery of kindle and iPad and be resigned to cloud reader for an hour or two.  Such is life.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Super fun game. Sometimes requires teamwork because I can't always figure it out on my own. Probably helping me fight brain degeneration.
B002LANLDK|4.0|The writing is a whole lot better and there isn't a rapper trying to advance his career in this one.
B007FIY3VW|4.0|Got it for my kindle fire to be able to work on documents and it works great. Would highly recommend it.
1892005034|5.0|I highly recommend this to book. I'd also suggest to check out the several videos on the internet of Marshall Rosenberg.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very well written and a million times better than the movie!  This one is my favorite book in the series.
B00DGNOMB6|5.0|A low key drama that makes you laugh and cry and gives you a candid look at old age. The cast of characters carry messages of hope and pain giving one pause on one's own life and choices. A must see.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|I'm not a big Quentin Tarantino fan, but my husband (who I bought this for), loves this movie.  It's a bit too gory for me
B007SYWFRM|3.0|I've had to start over twice now because it was not loading past the Fox entertainment logo other than that it was not bad at all
B001HN6922|4.0|But, for a toddler who loves Lightning McQueen, this movie is just as good.  I thought the spy storyline was geared to a much older audience.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|This was a great, easy read. Very entertaining and, as I said in my title, gives an accurate reflection of our wasteful, insolent society and how ridiculous it all is.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|I adored the books but found the movies to be &#34;eh&#34;.  But, I LOVE to read and find that it's very hard to adapt such phenomenal books to screen.  I do think they did as good a job as anyone else could have.  I wish they would stay truer to the story but I understand the need for suspence and action in the movies.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Interesting puzzle, makes you think. But could be harder in some aspects. Or at least include more rooms for each level.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Before I read the 50 shades of grey series, I read a lot of reviews about it.  I was hesitant to spend $10 on each of the 3 kindle books if it was going to be garbage.  On an impulse, and out of other books to read, I took a chance on it and read the series.  I liked it.  I wouldn't say I loved it, but I did enjoy reading it.<br /><br />For those people who complain about the author's writing style, overuse of certain words, etc., I say chill out.  I don't think anyone ever thought of this book as the next great American classic.  It's a great summer read; it's not going to win any literary awards so take it as what it is.  It's a fluff book that you can easily sit down and read.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|Good movie, great depiction of what to really expect. Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lopez did an excellent job. I'd rent it but not buy it, it's a movie that's good to watch ONCE.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I don;t know how much of this is based on the actual story or Michael Oher, but the movie is fantastic.  Tugs at your heart strings every step of the way.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|This playfully written novella from Brandon Sanderson is both memorable, and ranks among Sanderson's finest work.  The Emperor's Soul is a rarity in fantasy writing, short and sweet,  that's what makes it so refreshing. Despite it's short page count it does a great job leaving an impression on the reader.<br />  The amount of world building and wonder crammed into the work is incredible; the speed at which it establishes it's world, and the world's rules, gives the reader a chance to brainstorm within it's confines. The true beauty of the work is the multitude of possibilities it creates, allowing the reader to play in Sanderson's world and guess at the plots resolution. Sanderson doesn't cheat himself, or cheapen the established rules for shock value, instead he focuses on his characters cleverly resolving the puzzles placed before them.<br />  The story revolves around Shai, a clever thief, who is imprisoned and tasked with a secret mission to preserve the emperor's authority. The technique Shai is forced to employ is called Forging, a magic system which grants her the ability to imprint a different past on various people and things, the former being frowned upon within Shai's society for obvious reasons. Shai finds herself rebuilding the emperor's identity from journals and the memories of the people closest to him, many of which possess ulterior motives and are actively pursuing greater power and influence.<br />  What follows is an adventure in thought, self-reflection, and the subtle nobility of a character that is considered to be beyond reprieve. The majority of the story takes place within a single room, and yet Sanderson makes this work, changing the space as Shai herself learns and grows. Sanderson allows the reader to travel into the depths of Shai's psyche as she learns about the emperor's, studying the subtleties of personality and the events that shape both.
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I already have this book in print but this review is for the kindle edition.  It's a good book, but take it for what it is.  It's a fluffy summer read, notthe great next American classic.
B003ZFCBJ0|5.0|had some good plot devices was not expecting, enjoyed the movie very much. I would recommend it to all my friends
B003O86FMW|5.0|It's hard writing a book review without giving away spoilers.  Out of the series, this was my second favorite (Hunger Games is my favorite and Mockinjay my leats favorite).  Can't wait for the movie
B009UZLRJE|5.0|Love this show, it is very funny! The actors and writers have done a great job to make this show great. I never watch comedy because it usually isn't very well done but this show is different. Thhe characters work well together to bring out the &#34;funny&#34; the writers have laid out. I tend towards geeky so I can relate to many of the references. Do yourself a favor and enjoy!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Before I read the 50 shades of grey series, I read a lot of reviews about it.  I was hesitant to spend $10 on each of the 3 kindle books if it was going to be garbage.

B00821OX98|4.0|I'm only five episodes deep so far but I like it.<br />It manages to escape many of the pitfalls of most survival operas so far (over-the-top melodramatics, annoyingly over-archetypical characters, etc.).<br />The acting and writing are pretty good. There are a few things that leap out as kind of implausible (such as why would an alien race so bent on subjugating and destroying humanity ignore the giant enclave living miles away in an abandoned school) and it seems like we've seen these aliens in virtually every alien invasion movie in the last 20+ years.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I just discovered Gillian Flynn books and read them one right after another...wonderful story...great twists...a must read...can't wait for her to write another....
B00D8OHPF8|5.0|I haven recommended this CD to quite a few people and we're all in agreement, THIS is REAL R&B music.  Joe brought it in this CD and I play the CD from beginning to end w/o skipping a song!
B00544L9EI|5.0|If you are a fan of hip/hop/rap or just a fan of Eminem, this album is just fire!!!!!  Em and Royce da 59 are just great together and make a wonderful album.  Stop reading my review now and just GET IT!!!!!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I love this game. Brings back memories of when I used to own my on decks and spent hours upon end playing against my friends. Look forward to seeing what they come up with next.
B004HXIZVC|5.0|I will be honest, I got this app to connect with a favorite DJ of mine and I have not stopped using it ever since.  Great networking tool with music.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|Actually, I read this book before I read the biography of the only prison escapee to the west.  I was astounded, but the other book proved all the horrors to be true.  The book starts off slow, just giving background on the main character.  From the time he assumes another identity on, it was a page-turner!
B00AFCEIB0|1.0|I just have one question, why have this at all?  The fire already has a web browser so why add this up there to do...what exactly?  I loaded it and removed it faster than a bee to pollen, don't waste the time.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is the reason I got interested in zombies. Usually movies with blood and gore are not my type but the story line keeps you interested. The characters seem real and shows how we can and do change in times of unbelievable horror.
B00CO6QGCE|4.0|I am new to trying my hand at being a DJ for myself and with this tool, it is a great way to start off and learn the basics.  If you have a hobby for being a DJ then I really suggest this app.
B008AIGWVA|4.0|This crazy little puppy repeats whatever you say. He can sing songs you play or recite phrases. It is funny for young and old.
B00APUTEBG|1.0|It is entirely possible that this film was made exclusively for the purpose of being made fun of on Mystery Science Theater Three Thousand.  I think that show isn't around anymore, but they might have to bring it back just for this film.<br /><br />The biggest thing they teach you in screenwriting classes and film classes is that absolutely every last thing in a movie has got to be there for a reason.  Everything must drive the story forwards.  Cold Light of Day people did not get the memo.  Make it a game for the whole family: shout out any moment that is superfluous to the story.<br /><br />From script, to acting, to camera choices, to common sensibility:  Horrible, horrible, horrible.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Season Two doesn't disappoint.  The plot is interesting, though not overly dramatic like so many shows today.  Character development is a bit more complex than the simplistic &#34;good&#34; and &#34;evil&#34; stereotypes common in many shows.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Challenging yet not too hard.  Got a friend hooked on it at work.  I do wish there were more rooms though.
B009T8XBBO|2.0|I thought it would be like Casteville from Zynga on Facebook.  It's not like it at all.  Don't bother downloading unless you like quests that you have to do in order.
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|I have a kindle fire that I downloaded this on.  The graphics stink, looks like one of the &#34;mystic&#34; wallpaper screen savers for my computer.  Looks stringy on the KF.  Oh well...still kind of neat though.<br /><br />.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Great app for passing time when bored.  Would work better on a larger screen, but it's still really cool.  Totally worth the download.
B00B7VPKMY|5.0|Great old albums, remastered.  What more could you ask?  There are some duplicates with other &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; collections that I own, but each version has its own positives to offer!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie full of action and suspense. I would recommend this movie to anyone, The action was the throughout the whole movie.
B006YTTVHO|2.0|There's certainly nothing revolutionary or new about the content. But if you want a good basic starting point for social interaction, this is it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Fast paced, excellent writing and great character development! You love some characters, then you hate them...then you love them again!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I prefer the hidden object games with stories and plots, but this is a good substitute. Fun game, nice time killer.
B002KGEORM|5.0|I really enjoy the characters, the development, not always the &#34;action&#34; but I had to keep watching to find out where it was going.
B00B47NO2O|1.0|This was pretty horrible.  I couldn't make it through the first half of the pilot.  Graphically violent and not even well made.  The acting was so-so.  Female characters were not compelling or believable.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|The character development is really good, it makes one root for the &#34;bad&#34; guys!  Interesting interplay, good plots, almost makes one want to join an MC.
0763644765|5.0|My daughter loves this book. Every night she wants to read it. So far she has not began to use the potty. However, I hope we are getting close.
B008I34YYY|3.0|If you suspend belief,  then yes the iPod or the iPad can rule the world.  I find it interesting that 1940's technology can fly from the earth to the moon faster than our current day technology.  But I do find the dark humor funny.  I especially like the huge spaceships attacking earth.
B0014JLYS8|5.0|I ordered my normal size and it ran a bit large, so I asked for an exchange and it came in 2 days. The return was so easy and the current pair is a perfect size and works great in the kitchen. Glad I bought from them.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is quite challenging and pretty addictive. I couldn't put it down. I definitely recommend this game to any one thinking of getting it.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|This was a very beautiful movie with absolutely great scenery and fine acting.  It was a pleasure to watch and I know now why this movie won so many awards.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|as always Sylvia you did not disappoint !!! this was the best book by far !!! I want more of Gideon & Eva
B002SHD9E2|5.0|This is an awesome movie! It's almost as good as watching it at the Fox Theater. The music is awesome!
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This is the best book I have ever read. I hate reading because I can never find a book that catches my attention and this book certainly did that.
0425263924|5.0|good
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|This app is awesome but I half to argue about 1thing .In the beginning it stunk just because  you had to wast your money NOT REAL in the game even if you did not want to and I only had 22to coins and they gave me 200coins and it cost 200it was a rip off butt other then that IT  WAS.  AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Excellent game, lots of fun;  however the game needs some hints or clues.  had to go to U-Tube for help on some of the rooms, maybe that's the point. 4 stars
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|LOVE IT!!! It's a nice way to pass the time. I could play this all day and have caught myself up till early morning playing.
B003TTH4IU|2.0|It was interesting in the beginning, but later no new subject. Nothing else in this show other than sex and boyfriends.
B00COGXGNQ|2.0|the whole movie was bad, not worth the money at all I was disappointed.  the only good thing of the movie was the ending and that was because it was over.+-
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Wow just wow. The graphics are amazing the settings in each update are very fun and beautiful to play in.Subway surfers is epic!And remember run till you drop and keep or up dads updating Bye. Undertheroof-
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn never disappoints.  He really does his homework and delivers a great read every time.  I get so immersed in the character and the plot, I can't put the book down.  Nothing got done at my house when I picked up this book.
B00003CXPD|5.0|I saw it one time and enjoyed it so much that I had to have one of my own. A must see.
159463176X|5.0|I am not going to go into a long synoposis and character exploration about this novel.  Other reviewers have done so.  I am just going to tell you to read this book.  It is one of the best books I've read.  I read Hosseini's two previous novels and loved them because they told me about a part of the world about which I knew very little and because they were great stories.  In this novel, I felt that there was a great maturing in Hosseini as a writer and as a person who observes, lives, and understands. This novel is quite simply wonderful, in its story, in its writing, in what it will tell you.
B000FVQLRA|5.0|This movie was the very best, and is a must see for everyone. A true story that one will never forget.
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I've watched this entire film about five times over the last few years and I always learn something new from it.  It's given me a much greater appreciation of what some of our soldiers went through in the Pacific, although I already had a good idea from my father who was wounded on Luzon on 7 June 1945 at Bayombong during the campaign up the Caguyan Valley. He was the BAR man for his squad in the 129th Infantry Regiment of the 37th Infantry Division and was injured by shrapnel from a Japanese anti-tank round.  Left to die, he was rescued by Philippinos who got him to an aid station upriver by boat.  He won a Combat Infantryman's Badge, A Bronze Star and a Purple Heart. He spent weeks in a stateside hospital and was released with a service-connected injury and an Honorable Discharge.<br /><br />This brings me to my solitary complaint: why was this only about the Marines?  The U. S. Army played a significant part in the Pacific campaign and did most of the fighting in the Philippines.  Most movies suggest that the war ended at Iwo Jima and Okinawa.  Quite a bit of fighting went on after that, most of it by the Army, and this included the entire liberation of the Philippines, freeing many prison camps, the Battle for Manila, Battle for Baguio and so on, including the capture of General Yamashita.  These are ignored in many military films.<br /><br />This is still a great film and I highly recommend it.
B004SIP8W0|2.0|I did not like it, I could not understand a word to it, because it was not in english, If I had known that I would not have it.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Temple run 2 is a good app the only thing that I don't like is that it will freeze in the middle of games and get u besides that it's awesome
B004SEUJ82|5.0|The boy  in the striped pajamas is a movie that you will never forget, t is a wonderful story, a must see.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Wife and I watched the whole first season. A little confusing at times but it pays off. three more words ha ha
B00BC5KV42|5.0|If you are into buying or selling guitars or amps, this is a must have tool.  Its comprehensive, easy to use, and pretty accurate (as accurate as can be in an ever changing market).  It will help you establish a reasonable starting point to value an instrument.  Its parent, Vintage Guitar Magazine, is also an excellent resource.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|It is a seriously addicting show that you will not regret watching. There is smart and witty humor along with just enough drama to keep you wanting more.
B009JCL58G|5.0|I really liked the movie, and kept thinking throughout the film that it had a lovely score.  I am happy to say this album contains all my favorites, including the end titles.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I went into this book thinking I was getting an easy read about teenage love and ended up getting a story with more complexity, depth, and heart than I anticipated! Super great read for the .99 price tag!
B0053O89XI|5.0|This is the rare show that gets better and better. Sheldon is an Everyman who spouts in innocence what most of us are unwilling to admit let alone say. The perfect ensemble cast to a wickedly funny but extremely insightful series.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|Game was interesting and fun, a little to short. Maybe allow manipulation of two elements at the same time. Anxiously await the next chapter!
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Many of the cast are from an old favorite, LOVE ACTUALLY. This bittersweet romance brings back memories of my African Peace Corps experience. I, as did this English troop, enter a world where Maggie Smith blurts out she's gone to hell. Some survive and some don't.<br /><br />However, even as exotic as India is, the concerns of family and kin remain the same. We really are all one.  The difference is how we adapt to it. It's a movie not soon forgotten and remembered at odd moments in our lives as well.
B008XG1X18|3.0|This is a fantastic app. I love Pinterest and its a great way to pass time and get new ideas. But this app may not be the best thing... Most of the time when I try to open the app, it doesn't open and I have to &quot;force close&quot;. Its much easier to just use pinterest on my computer, but when it does work, this app is great too.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is just simply one of the best ways to spend screen time. Very upbeat for a period piece with great acting, sets and story lines. It's no wonder it has become so popular.
B005MMY9A8|3.0|Mildly entertaining, but corny and predictable. Good for 11 year-olds, NASCAR fans, and people who still like George W. Bush.
B004GCK6XY|4.0|Julia Roberts movies are (to me) either very, very good (like Pretty Woman) or stinkers (like Runaway Bride). The same for Hugh Grant.<br /><br />So when my wife checked this out at the library I wasn't overly enthusiastic to watch it. However since we, usually, watch what I want to it was only fair that I agreed to watch this with her.<br /><br />I'm glad I agreed.<br /><br />This a nicely done, understated, movie. It tells the tale of a man who owns a bookstore (Hugh Grant) who falls in love with a big movie star (Julia Roberts) who ducks into his store mostly to avoid the paparazzi. He is star struck at being so close to such a beautiful and famous woman.<br /><br />Two scenes have stayed with me - the one after she spent the night the first time - this was very well done and allowed us to have some fun via his goofy roommate - Rhys Ifans as Grant's scene-stealing, slovenly friend.<br /><br />The other is where he visits her on-site for a outdoors scene. The sound guys give him some earphones to listen in for the dialog since he is only allowed to be so close to where they are shooting. When he hears what she says about him is heart-wrenching and very well done.<br /><br />But, of course, it ends happily as most Hollywood productions but even the frantic chase to the hotel is fun.<br /><br />I would give this a very solid 8.0 to 8.5 out of 10.<br /><br />*******************************************************************************<br /><br />And now for a shameless plug - my daughter had a small part in The Lil' River Rats and the Adventure of the Lost Treasure. Originally she had a much bigger role but the director/producer went through a divorce which delayed things for more than 2 years. So the movie was recast as the original kids were deemed too old. My daughter was the only one kept but she was given a much smaller part with only about 5 lines (and I believe 2 of those were cut).<br /><br />This movie was sold at Target last Christmas for $5.99. It is NOTa good movie - it could have been but just wasn't. I would rate it around a 4.5 or so on a 10 point scale. My daughter is the one wearing a blue shirt who gets hit with a water balloon dropped by a remote controlled helicopter. I was there for that scene and it took 10 or 12 takes as they couldn't get the balloon to burst when hitting her. We finally scotch taped a tack to her forehead to get the balloon to burst when it was supposed to. That did the trick and we got the take they needed. I actually read for the sheriff role - actually filmed a couple of scenes but then they found a radio personality which meant FREE advertising on local radio.<br /><br />The reason I'm telling you is all of this is if they sell 10,000 more copies by Labor Day they will have enough cash to make another with her as a high school girls basketball player.<br /><br />Sorry if this blatant sales job upsets anyone.
B0000542D2|5.0|The DVD was in fantastic shape.  The sound was crisp and the video quality was excellent.  A great buy!  Thank you.
B006TLFPKO|5.0|Love this movie. My favorite part is the birth scene. I think it's magical that they were able to create a beautiful child together. Plus the wedding was so elegant, I loved fellas wedding dress :)
B004VMVTNU|5.0|I have used it for a few years now and I wanted to support the developers and get rid of the ads which were, of course, right next to the dismiss button. Now I have larger buttons in a more user friendly interface. I can full size mp3 for alarms or timers.
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I have read this book 3 times in my life and will be reading it again soon. As you can tell I must like the story very much. For those that have not read it you to might find it to be a favorite of yours as well. I personally think that it is the best of all of James Clavell's books.<br />Good reading
B004EF8AJA|5.0|Although when you see the title of the program, you think that this has to do with another version of the original.<br />Which in a sense it does, but this program deals with the differences between those who live in the south of England, as  to those in the North, whose opinions are quite different.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|My daughter begged me to watch this. Guaranteed that I'd love it- spot on!! The dresses, the home(s), the subject matter, the time period- all just 5 star perfect!!!
B009UVWBMA|5.0|I have enjoyed Taylor's sound and music sense I first heard it.  Its light and happy, sad yet hopeful.  It kind of makes me feel like I am twenty again.  Believe me I haven't been thirty in many years.  So her music is magic.  I highly recommend this CD, all the music is great fun.  That is why she is on top!!!
B005MLOKXA|5.0|I am really enjoying this show, but I DO NOT like the requirement of a certain number of words in the review.  That is the reason I do not rate my choice often.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a fun game to play with my son.  It's great to have something that challenges you to think outside the box.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I guess I thought it would be a little more action packed. Sometimes I felt the story was kinda slow. Still an interesting story though.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Hosseini has wonderful stories to tell.  You get the feeling these are his personal stories.  Some are painful but you are well rewarded by his wonderful style of writing.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The second this book ended,I was eagerly awaiting the next one! It is really hot & steamy & I want to know what's next for Gideon & Eva. Hurry, hurry and write more !!
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Great group of actors looking like they are having fun.  I enjoyed the interaction between all of them and being an &#34;older person&#34; , they kicked butt.
B00821PCJS|3.0|After being constantly bombarded by commercials of this show I decided to give it a try on amazon. This review does not have anything to do with amazon's services or any extra charges they may have inccured, this is about the show. The show started right off in action, not showing much about the past and wasting time, but rather explained past events with current characters. This allowed for a good development of the characters and a pretty well put together picture of the premise. The only thing I'd critique for the first season is that there are some ploy holes that I feel personally were too noticeable for me, and some of the writing and acting was not fitting with the overall mood or emotional atmosphere of the scene I was a watching. It was strange at times watching a character talking about an extremely emotional and deep memory, then warily talking about a silly topic the next. Of course come second season, and the show gets even better.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wish there were more levels; it's really fun. It is challenging but not frustrating til the last couple levels.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I enjoy all of his books especially these. Lots of great characters and a little bit of history in a fantastic page turner - finished this in 2 weeks thanks to a long layover. Can't wait for the third one.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|If you are a MARVEL superhero fan, this is a well done movie! Loved every minute of it! Why are you reading this review! Go watch it now!
B000FC13Y0|5.0|I was not sure if I should read this book since I have the movie. I went ahead and got it and have been pleasantly surprised! It's like reading a whole new story. Like most books there is way more to it than in the movie. So glad I decided to read it!
B0046B3QTG|5.0|This movie is just straight up funny.  The minions are hilarious!  It has a great storyline and we can't wait to go see Despicable Me 2 later today in the theaters.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Lark Rise to Candleford is a fascinating show. The only problem I have with it is it's so enjoyable that I have trouble spacing out the episodes rather than having a marathon watching each season all at one time.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Love this show.  Fantasy, English accents, intrigue, betrayal - pity about the rampant sexism, but at least it's honest about the world it has created.<br /><br />Why isn't it free for Prime subscribers??
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|Awesome! This guy knows how to blow and he puts on a great performance on the CD and in person. It's a must have. Whether you're driving in your car, cleaning the house or working out you will not be able to resist cranking up the volume. (The title track is featured in a Nikon commercial starring Ashton Kutcher). I'm not as taken with the vocals, but the instrumental tracks will have you coming back for more.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|I can't get enough of the Good Wife.  I think the characters are all interesting, and the plot lines keep me coming back. (And I LOVE Alicia's clothes!)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had fun with this game. got stuck a couple of times but I figured it out. I can't wait to see the new rooms.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The show is a little gruesome at first but you get use to it, then you can follow the story.
B001GQ2BNQ|5.0|Works Great for me! ... After 20 years of smoking, my lung capacity is now what it should be.  With this snorkel, I am able to swim as long as my 40+ body can go.  I also helps you maintain a correct freestyle stroke.
B002VHI8FE|5.0|one of the better books i have read in a rather long time.  Would recommend to anyone who is interested in fantasy.
B0028AQLYE|2.0|Does not work on the Finis Freestyle snorkel ... in my opion.  Might work on the other Finis snorkel, but I don't know.
B008602KQI|1.0|I got bored of it after 10 minutes, its like baby's first post civilization movie. I think twilight crap is better then this.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Breaking Dawn tells the story of Bella and Edward, the vampire. They are married, and everything seems perfect. But then Bella becomes pregnant with their child, a half human and half vampire creature. The baby is slowly killing Bella from the inside, breaking her bones and rejecting all food she eats, starving them both to death. Jacob is still dealing with the pain of Bella 's rejection to his feelings, and now must help protect Bella from Sam and other members of the wolf pack, who are intent on killing Bella to destroy the unborn child, which they believe poses a threat to the society. Luckily, he's got Seth and his sister Leah to help deal with the wolves. And the one way to saving Bella may end up destroying her life. Edward's now dealing with feelings of hate for Renesmee, the child.<br /><br />Will Jacob be able to protect Bella while trying to cope with his pain? Will Edward be able to overcome his hate of the child and save Bella? And will they be able to overcome the greatest threat of all?<br /><br />This book was amazing. I really liked Bella. She's so tough and stubborn about the things she believes in, and she doesn't let anyone, vampire or no, to get in her way. And Jacob was interesting. It goes in depth about his remaining feelings for Bella, and his bitterness. New characters include Renesmee, Kate, Tanya, and Garrett. Some of the new characters are minor and don't really appear much, but Stephanie Meyer goes into great detail about them.
B004Q3UL2O|4.0|Very good movie. Good ending and some what realistic. Romantic and passionate. Show the transformation lust slowly become into love.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Really enjoyed the storyline, tired with America's obbession with Zombies and attacks on the whitehouse. Great show and I love Jessica Lange, she makes the show.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Love it Love it Love it I have this on my phone too. Can't get enough of this game.Lots of fun. Thanks for putting on Kindle
B00D2K40WY|5.0|So i bought this game and i was like god it boring. then i tried it and OMG it was fun! i absoultly would buy this if i were you!!!!!! :)
B00597A6NU|4.0|I've watched this movie a few times over the years and I still find it fun and entertaining.  I've never been a big fan of Matthew Modine and the movie doesn't change my opinion of his bland stoic style.  However all of the other players and the story make up for it.<br /><br />Worth the watch!
034580709X|2.0|Dialogue is horribly stilted and unnatural.  If this is Nesbo's first Harry Hole, he improved with later novels.  I was unable to finish the book.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Phillp Phillips, has a GREAT Career ahead, with a VERY STRONG Following!<br />Stay Original and You shall go far! Don't let the Industry mess You Up!, Keep a level HEAD & STAY TRUE YOUR MUSIC!<br />F.Shafford<br />Flower Mound, TX.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|The game was fun, challenging and frustrating.  I struggled with a few (figured them out), cheated on one (sorry) and enjoyed every minute.  Cannot wait for more puzzles.<br />.
B0083EW97W|5.0|Very Good, Easy Listening and Calming to the SOUL!<br />John Mayer, has a GREAT FOLLOWING and is just coming back to the Industry, remaining with His OWN Style!<br />F.Shafford<br />Flower Mound, TX.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I'm on the 9th day know and downloading is still at 0%<br />That's the problem I could give a more accurate reading if I could play the game...
B00932A4XE|1.0|Started to watch and the material was so inane I could not finish.  It was a total waste of my time.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I feel like a secret agent in another world. Only complaint...my laundry isn't doing itself<br />It's one of those games that you get frustrated then finally figure it out. A lot of duh, how did I miss that moments. TRY THIS GAME...you will be glad you did. Besides, it's free. What do you have to lose, other than good times doing chores, ha.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|love this game challenging and exciting game to play. I recommend that you try it you will get addicted to it.
B003Y059EK|3.0|I obviously am biased by the original OZ. This had potential to be a much better movie. I kept waiting for some one to break out in song. It is more like watching a &#34;Muppet&#34; movie.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I read about this Sylvia Day \\"trilogy\\" after reading Fifty Shades of Gray.  As it was listed as, \\"if you enjoyed Shades\\", then The Crossfire series is a recommended read!  After reading \\"Bared to you\\" I felt the books was a let down. However, I did like the connection between the characters Gideon and Eva, so I decided to give the author another chance and read \\"Reflected in you\\".  I was presently surprised, and I really enjoyed book two.  As I eagerly await book three, almost 6 months later, \\"Entwined in you\\" was finally released.  Unfortunately, This book was the worst of the three in my opinion.  The story just ran on, and on, with no ending in sight.  Basically, it just repeated most of the story line from book two.  Putting the main characters in very similar situations, without any real view points being made other than, Gideon and Eva stating how much they love each other over and over again.  Omg, what a big waste of time!!  Did the author get tired of writing, what happen to progression and development?  I really thought that I was judging the book to harshly until I read the reviews from other readers who had come to the same conclusion.  I get that the main characters have a lot to work through but the story line was weak!!  Gideon and Eva deserve much better!  At this point, I'm hoping that the fourth book will tie up the very loose ends of the Crossfire series, since it was originally billed as a trilogy, did the author lose count?  Lets hope that Ms. Day, will live up to her super star writing status, with the Gideon and Eva, story line or this reader will definitely be moving on to other authors who can and will deliver great reading.
B002YVAT72|2.0|Maybe it is my win7 OS, but this did not plug&play.but once loaded into iTunes it did not record any playable files for me. I had to use a third party program to capture the sound file. A lot of set up and adjustment to record an album.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|I loved this movie!! I was pleasantly surprised!! Great story! As good as the book! It was GREAT!!!! Def worth the watch!!!
B00821PCJS|3.0|I love science fiction, but I can't seem to get into this one. It's like a compilation of every apocalyptic, Alien invading earth vs Mad Max all rolled into one show.
B009YG2ND8|5.0|A tribute to one of the greatest series in the world, Final fantasy never fails to disappoint.  Great stuff ya
B00BBA6FMU|4.0|A very enjoyable read of a (thankfully) bygone era. Strong characters that draw you in. If you loved 'The Help' you'll enjoy this too.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|it is a great game i love but i wish i had more guns.<br />so they Ned more updates so you can have guns like the posh the mp40 etc.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|My husband and I both read this book.  We both really liked the story.  The story is exciting.  Each page finished leads you to more pages looking for answers.  I was surprised with the ending.
B00BTHV05M|5.0|With so much of the current music being so loud and with so much base that the house rattles it is refreshing to hear harmony and hear the words to the songs.  I love every song on this CD.  The words are meaningful and these guys can really put together good music. If you like other One Republic CD's you will love this one too.  Kudos to One Republic on this CD.
B00CH87HF4|1.0|Had a good game going. Had some Amazon coins I used for a little help. Glitches occurred. Do a web search for this game's problems first, by the way. My character's Skills disappeared, along with three of the other commonly reported glitches, rendering the character unplayable.  I contacted customer service for a refund of the coins. It took them three weeks to respond, and weeks of delayed emails, resending the info I complained about initially. I wanted those Amazon coins back. The only thing they say they've done is give me a &quot;gift&quot; of in game currency, but I haven't seen anything. Anyway, the glitches are there, and there message boards don't seem to indicate they're doing anything to fix them. Don't waste your time with this, or Gameloft in general.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm a HUGE Gideon fan. I love this series way better than 50 shades.  In this series you can feel the love that have for each other.  You want them together, you just more and more for them.  I can't wait for the fourth book.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Love it. so does my son. wish it was more expansive and that you can make more than one reef so my son has one and so do i. otherwise its a great game. very colorful and my son loves seeing all the new fish. great game.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|After striking gold with his [[ASIN:B002WV5A9G Star Trek (2009)]] movie that managed to be both a reboot and a sequel to the Star Trek franchise, J.J. Abrams hits another home run with \\"Star Trek Into Darkness\\".  In this newest Trek movie, Abrams manages to give non-Trek fans a rousing action story, outstanding special effects, another excellent score by composer Michael Giacchino and, for Trek fans, all of this plus some good-natured nods to previous movies (although some were offended by this; more on this point later).  Also, in the spirit of the original Star Trek television series, and [[ASIN:B000I3PA8Q Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home]] and [[ASIN:B000IZA9NU Star Trek: Insurrection]], Abrams gives us a \\"message\\" movie with commentary on current events (*minor spoiler* in this movie Kirk is ordered by his superior officer to destroy a terrorist in enemy territory via the use of long-range torpedoes).<br /><br />After turning in excellent performances in the 2009 movie, the cast is once again outstanding in this film.  Chris Pine continues to channel William Shatner and yet put his own stamp on the role of Captain James T. Kirk; a remarkable achievement by a remarkable actor.  Likewise, Zachary Quinto expertly balances Leonard Nimoy's portrayal of Spock with his own mix of melancholy and occasional bursts of emotion and even anger.  After the destruction of his planet in the previous film, I completely buy into the idea that his Spock would show more emotion than Nimoy's.<br /><br />The rest of the cast also turns in good performances- Karl Urban is very good but slightly underused as Bones McCoy, John Cho as Sulu gets a nice scene of his own, Anton Yelchin as Chekov makes the most of his screen time, and Zoe Saldana is used well again as Uhura.  Alice Eve is also good as Dr. Carol Marcus, but is not given much to do; most likely she was introduced in this film with the intent of featuring her more prominently in the next movie.  Simon Pegg as Scotty is both heroicand hilarious in this film, and steals several scenes.<br /><br />*Major Spoilers Ahead re: Villains* Peter Weller appears as the corrupt Starfleet admiral Alexander Marcus, and makes an effective villain.  Special mention must be made of Benedict Cumberbatch, who *Major Spoiler* plays Khan.  Cumberbatch's Khan is just as villainous as the classic Khan and even more brutal, but yet manages to explain his actions to the extent that while you may not agree with what he does, it still makes a certain degree of sense from his point of view.  Cumberbatch is so good in the role that I think he turns in a Heath Ledger Joker-esque performance as Khan, and I really hope we see him again in a future sequel.  While some fans object to his nationality (in comparison to the classic Khan's nationality), I feel that, as with any film, some imagination must be used when you go to see a movie.<br /><br />*Major Spoiler*  As I mentioned earlier, some fans have been offended by the movie's references to previous events in Star Trek.  In particular, some fans have been offended by the nod to the famous ending to [[ASIN:B0094K20FK Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan [HD]]] when in this film Kirk sacrifices himself (albeit temporarily) to save the Enterprise, and then shares an emotional goodbye with Spock through a transparent door.  I know some disagree, but I thought this was an interesting way to turn Spock's sacrifice in Star Trek II on its head while, at the same time, reverse the ultimate meaning of the farewell between the two friends.  As screenwriter Bob Orci has explained, in Star Trek II Kirk and Spock are sharing a final goodbye as the culmination of decades of friendship; whereas in this movie, this emotional moment is really the true beginning of their friendship.  I disagree completely with the notion that this moment is a \\"copy and paste\\" rip-off of Star Trek II.<br /><br />Does this movie edge out \\"Star Trek II\\" as the best Star Trek movie (IMHO) in my mind?  Close, but for one nitpick- the movie's use of the Enterprise.  The Enterprise has always been as much of a character in Star Trek as Kirk, Spock, Picard, Data, etc.  It has always been much more than an airplane, helicopter, etc., or something simply used to ferry our characters from Point A to Point B in the story.  *Spoiler*  While the Enterprise manages to hang tough in the face of heavy fire from Admiral Marcus' secret battleship U.S.S. Vengeance, it never returns fire to defeat its adversary, which I think is a storytelling flaw.  In Star Trek II and [[ASIN:B000HZGNDG Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]], the Enterprise takes heavy damage, but also eventually overcomes its enemy starship adversaries in those films.  In this film, the Vengeance is eventually disabled in a clever ploy undertaken by Spock, but I think it would have been more satisfying from a storytelling point of view if its comeuppance had been delivered by the Enterprise herself.<br /><br />On that subject, after the Scimitar in [[ASIN:B000IZA9PI Star Trek: Nemesis]], the Narada in Star Trek (2009), and the Vengeance in Star Trek Into Darkness, I think the writers have mined the \\"massive powerful battleship versus the smaller, less powerful Enterprise\\" plotline enough.  I hope the next film gives us a more evenly matched naval engagement between the Enterprise and the enemy vessel, where the Enterprise prevails.<br /><br />In summary, Star Trek Into Darkness is an excellent film for Star Trek fans and non-Trek fans of action/adventure films alike, and should not be missed.  Live Long and Prosper!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|loved the dialogue and continuous plots...left the season on a major cliff hanger!  what will happen next?<br />can't wait for the next season!
B000002TYX|5.0|I have always loved the Beatles, and to hear some the goings on behind the music is amazing.  A great pair of cd's for a great price.
B0092S4WLY|5.0|I like it..its fun and challenging..keeps you guessing..actually a very fun game..brain challenging..would recommend it to anyone..it is a good mind bender if you like a challenge!
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Only problem with this book is she described everyone all over again in detail to stretch the book out.  On top of that she describes Gideon around 4 times.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|The book doesn't disappoint that's for sure. It's great to read and the whole time you are rooting for them the whole time hoping they stay together. Sylvia Day leaves this open for the next book and I'm very interested to see what can happen between the two of them. Even though they are able to be with each other again it seems like there are a lot of forces that are trying to keep them apart.
B000F8O35U|5.0|The movie is in great condition. I bought a used movie. It works perfectly. The movie case is fine! no scratches on the movie.
B0082SU98U|4.0|Growing up I've always been an avid Disney fan and absolutely loved their Pollyanna movie. When I began reading this I couldn't believe how different it was from the film. I still enjoyed the story and highly suggest readers to also get \\"Pollyanna Grows Up\\" so they know the rest of the story.
B0069G5Z9K|3.0|It's fine but  you'd think there'd be a little more of a point to a game but you people who are 5 starring this app are totally respected because I'd understand why some people would like this app. And second this app is so kid friendly.overall it's a good app.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Yay about this product it . Is awesome!!!!!  Yay8<br />This product was great. My children love it and it is also great because they tour around the world. It shows them that travelling the world can be good for their future
B004SBS8LA|5.0|not to sure about these new power aids. they help some.  if they are part of the game we should not have to buy them.  they are not really worth the cost.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I finished the three book series start in two days. I am upset that the negative reviews are all listed first with over 55% of reviews being 4+ stars. I found the third book to be equally as thrilling as the first two. I can understand frustration of being dragged out from expecting a trilogy into a 5-book series, however, I don't feel as though the characters could truly be resolved in book 3. Anyone reading this book with any personal feelings in common with the characters would agree.<br /><br />I enjoyed the addition of Brett to this storyline as most of the adversaries perviously revolved around Gideon, with the exception of Nathan, who we never REALLY met anyways. With two persons as damaged and hurt/abused as Eva and Gideon, I would have been incredibly upset with a happily resolved ever after. That's not even close. I want to see them actually WORK through the turmoil and beat it out (not physically speaking.)<br /><br />I've found this trilogy as enthralling as Fifty Shades, but in a completely different context. While Fifty shades was fun and riveting, this has so much more appeal in its raw sensuality. It feels like it could be far more common in society (minus the bazillionaire part!) I like that it doesn't have the creepy over the top parts that are still a little to taboo-in my opinion.<br /><br />I rather hate that this series is being so closely related to Fifty Shades. Yes, it has a lot of romance and intimacy, but that's where I think the similarity ends. Great book series so far.
B005TVYVI2|1.0|After one year it appeared that the battery was dead.  When I turned it on, the LCD briefly showed \\"1\\" and then faded off.  After replacing with a fresh battery the unit still behaves the same way.  Grr.
B0074PNCRM|3.0|I was told by lots of people that this book MUST be read... However, I found it quite boring and highly predictable.<br /><br />Maybe my expectations were too high? Or maybe I am too old for it??<br /><br />The love story was cute, it was like a long draw out version of the love story in 'My sisters Keeper' - which is a good story, but also disappointing in the end.
B005TBQS0Q|5.0|I like war films and this one was a little different than the ones I am use to. I love Robin Williams and the way he can improvise in many of the scenes. The story line was great.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|SIMPLE YET, ENTERTAINING EVERYBODY IS ENJOYING IT IN OUR HOME. THERE ARE NO CHAMPIONS YET BUT OUR GRANCHILD OF 12 IT IS AHEAD OF EVERYBODY .
B00C2VIA52|4.0|It taught me about card games which I have never really played before so I consider it a cool game. For it to be free I cannot complain.
B0026KX5PO|3.0|Matt Damon's performance is good but the director chose to make Ripley extremely gay which is a divergence from the books.  In the books, Ripley is a cultured, sociopathic opportunist more like Hannible Lechter than the weak, mushy, emotional sociopath this director has contrived.  Ripley's Game is much more true to the character.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|WOW! WotC totally knocked it out of the park with this one. Graphics are brilliant. Gameplay is realistic, intuitive, and so well done you'll be baffled by how human the digital competiton seems. Everything about this &quot;app&quot; is awesome.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great graphics and for the most part, easy gameplay.<br /><br />Swipe up to jump, down to slide. Jump over obstacles or to pick up items, slide under overhangs. Swipe left or right to turn, tilt to be on left or right of pathways. Basically, a combination obstacle course maze that's pretty addictive.<br /><br />Only issue is sometimes you swipe, but it doesn't register the swipe. I don't know if that's a app issue or Kindle issue, hence 4 stars.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Mr Fellowes sure knows how to keep the story going! I especially like what he is doing with Tom Branson, the former chauffeur.
B0064W65UM|1.0|The instructions say to double-click the pane to be viewed and I did - it zooms in on the selected frame, but it's still too small to read.  An absolute waste of ten bucks...
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Just starting season 2, season 1 was great. Show has many different characters all with their own personality. Must watch
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|All three of these books were absolutely amazing! I am so looking forward to more! Plan on reading more of the books you already have out! Everything in these books kept me sitting on the edge of my seat! Thank you so much for all you're great reads!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is excellent. A complete page turner that is constantly changing. You are not sure who you should be cheering for, and you maybe surprised who you like in the end.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|I've Been Waiting For This For A Long Time. About Time They Expanded To More Devices. Great Fun Unlocking All Cards.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|It is not often that a movie prequel does justice to the original. In Oz, the Great and Powerful, Sam Raimi accomplishes this well. It is especially hard to prequel a movie as beloved and classic as The Wizard of Oz. But in this story we learn much of the origins of the people, and places we were shown in the original movie. James Franco sells the young, sly, not very wise, Carny Magician, and Mila Kunis masterly plays the witch who becomes the wicked witch of the west. Michelle Williams is very believable as the Good Witch Glinda. She doesn't get the praise she deserves, probably because everybody loves to hate the villains and they do steal the show a bit. The movie is definitely worth seeing, I have already purchased it, and it is in my DVD case next to the original Wizard of OZ.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The horses look and move like real horses. The horses require care just like real horses. I would love it if there were no pop-up ads while I'm playing.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|This book is AMAZING.  I would love to take Dr. McGonigal's class at Stanford.  This book would also be great for a Book Club.  It would be so fun to be in some kind of a group discussion and practice of his Will Power experiments.
0061692042|5.0|If you love detective story and you live in or around Toronto, Canada you will love Liz Buggs three novels Red Rover, Oranges and Lemons and Yellow Vengeance. Calli Barnow is a Lesbian PI who travels all around Toronto and surrounding areas to solve the mystery.  Liz takes the reader down many familiar streets and areas of Toronto where my wife and I live. Calli has a wonderful friend Dewey who helps her with the leg work and who adds a wonderful comic relief. I have just finished Yellow Vengeance and am thirsty for more of Calli's adventures. Liz is very skilled at making her books page turners and she keeps the reader wondering what will come next. My wife and I give Liz Bugg 5 stars for her ability to grab the reader from the first sentence to the last and making us say \\"Liz, we need more please\\"

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|i used 2 have this game 4 my ipad when i was about 10... i wasnt very good at it at all... then 1 day when i was on my kindle looking 4 apps i thought of this 1... it wasnt on the market... i waited 4 about 3 months and it finally came out... i downloaded it and im still addicted 4 months l8er... im 14 now and i check it 1-2 times a day... it is an amazing sim game and i can only think of 1 down side... unfortunately it takes up about 1/4 of the available space on my kindle :P... still an amazing app and totally worth it tho :D
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I could not stop reading this book. The 'interviews' are compelling; ranging from the human face of the survivors, through the military and civilians, to the ones broken by the war. A very interesting study on the way humans would react when facing global extinction. A really good read !
B007EE5820|4.0|Easy read. Has given me a better insight into Arnie and what makes him tick, what he has achieved, how he achieved it and how much work, focus and determination it tool Am about halfway through it and good too not read a diatribe of nasty things about anyone................ if Arnie doesn't like someone it is never written abut in a mean or nasty way

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was soo good if you havent read it yet...it&#34;s deffently worth it!! Suzanne collins did a wonderful job on this book
B000FVQM2Y|5.0|This is a review of the well-presented single disc DVD presentation of BRICK<br />  A Fantastic thoughtful and brooding film, Brick really shows for those ready for a smart world investment (has a bit of \\"Anywhen\\" flavor to it.  Pros:<br />1. fantastic tension-building pace games.<br />2. Smart acting and mental fencing.<br />3. Awesome dialogue and flow.<br />4. Great ensemble power. (Roundtree?!?)...<br />5. Taken as a fantasy workup, it actually lays down clear rules (and obeys them!).<br />  In short, this is a good thriller/whodunnit with (as noted elsewhere) crazy-smart dialogue and tension games.  It is one of my favorite modern films.  If you can transpose yourself into the realm presented, you will love it.  Gordon-Levitt is also grand in Premium Rush (which was another I almost passed over).  I'd also recommend The Big Sleep for those who haven't seen it (original with Bogart & Bacall).<br />  This blue-cover edition has some excellent production commentary including expanded and deleted scenes, which was surprisingly good viewing...<br />  I hope this was helpful.
0425166805|5.0|The book is well written, detailed explanations of how it may have all started.  We keep looking for answers and these are palpable. We need more people scientific interest in fact finding and not speculations as to our origins.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great fun. Some real brain teasing + memory required.  I recommend it highly.  If you like puzzle solving this is your game - enjoy.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|There is hardly any variation in puzzle types, and every floor leaves you asking, &quot;is that it?!&quot;<br /><br />Not worth it.
B001AQR3IU|5.0|Alright, I don't really usually like fairy stories. My husband is a HUGE fan so I bought this as a gift for him...solely based on the cast. It's darn good. I'd recommend.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|This show is amazing. Even just as good as the first season. Though it was faced with cancellation the show managed to pull off a great two season. It managed to achieve in two seasons what many other shows couldn't in their many seasons.
B0047685I2|4.0|Purchased as a gift for someone. They enjoyed it. It's simple but so Drew. If you like Drew you'll like this movie. Oh...and Angelica Houston is wonderful, as usual!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am so ready for Season 4!  Can't wait to watch this series again.  I like to watch several hours at a time.
B004QSQML8|1.0|Yikes, what a mistake it was to buy this one. This is so early Tom Cruise, and he's not a good actor to begin with given his one mood/demeanor personna, that it's even before he developed any timing or style. Don't buy this one.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|My brother and I both liked this movie very much - we are 60 and 62 years old!  Very fun movie with excellent stars!
B002QVZ71I|5.0|This has always been one of my all time favorite movies so when it was offered thru Amazon Prime at such a good deal I had to download it so I can watch it anytime I want.  So far only watched it once but I'm sure it won't be my last.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Have to take a lot of med's and insulin and never forget them now.  You can just add and name as many alarms as you want.
B001XUIBNO|5.0|Two of my favorite actors played such awesome roles. Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire time.
B003JUGQ38|5.0|Sorry, doesn't really matter which season of Dr. Who it is. I love all of them...so I am just a little biased.
B005CRQ2IU|2.0|Realize this is a graphic novel but the fact that the text isn't searchable or selectable for highlighting notes or definitions? Highly irritating.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Unless you watched Downton Abbey Season 3 on TV when it aired, you will not be able to find it anywhere but on Amazon since they bought the rights to it and it was pulled from Comcast, Netflix, Hulu and I am sure many others. The show is addicting and I'm not really sure why :)<br /><br />Season 3 leaves you earning for season 4 which comes out in January 2014; if you watched the other two seasons and figure you will skip season 3 since you can't get it on your local cable system, that would be a bad choice. I signed up for the 30 day free trial to Amazon Plus and streamed it; I watched the whole season in one day!
B00B2PHSIY|2.0|I think it is very expensive and I am sure you can achieve the same effect via SW post processing.
B0091W7MP4|4.0|It was closer to real life than a lot of movies are to day. I think it shows how whacky our world has become.
B009CF7GRY|5.0|A modern take on a classic.  Might be a little mindless entertainment, but it has great music, good story, and outstanding balance between new and old movie.  Highly recommended.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|A good game from one of my favorite game developers.  I love these kinds of point and click adventure games.  The graphics are beautiful, and the storyline keeps the interest.  I want more, more, more like this, but could we please have lower prices?  $4.99 is a lot to pay for a game that is finished in a couple days at most. Keep the price high and I wont buy. But let the price fall and I will buy them all.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Can't wait for season 3 to start.<br />Funny, intelligent well cast show. A must for someone who wants intelligent programming that is witty as well.
B00004W510|5.0|This stealthy musical bomb came out in 1969 led off by the hit single 'Up on cripple creek.'<br />This is possibly the best rock n' roll album since 'Meet The Beatles.' Every single track being of the utmost quality.<br />This self titled cd, preceded by 'Music from Big Pink' heralded the much ballyhooed American genre.
B004RKXNDU|5.0|John Le Carr&eacute; is one of the world's greatest living authors. Baby boomers will know him best for \\"Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy' his masterpiece about a double agent at the very top of the British secret service. They'll know this work because it was made into an unmissable tv series by the BBC starring Sir Alec Guinness as George Smiley and Ian Richardson as Bill Haydon (both master actors sadly no longer with us.) the story itself is both a page-turner and a deep, extensive dive into the souls of spies as Smiley comes out of retirement on the orders of politicians to give MI5/6 a 'hygiene check' on the rumors of there being traitor in their midst. No writer has ever combined pulse-raising suspense with an extensive examination of humanity - treacherousness, ambition, love - to such perfectly paced and weighted effect.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I've long been a fan of historical fiction and this is by far and away one of the best. The characters are well defined and well portrayed by an outstanding cast. Like &#34;Upstairs, Downstairs&#34; it presents life from two vantage points. When an episode is over, I'm already waiting for the next. It's a sad day when a season ends as the wait for the next seems eternal. PBS has a real winner with this series.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Once again Downton Abbey delivers. The story continues to pull the viewer in with the twists and turns of the family and the households staff. I watched the entire season within 2 days and now can't wait for the next one.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The guy is a good writer but the whole book was sad. That's why I did not enjoy the read. He also jumped to much in the story. Life is sometimes sad but I think there is always at least one happy time. Even the happy sounded sad in this book
B005K17RU0|1.0|I updated yesterday and ever since it freezes and shuts down,If i try and swipe to view the next panel it crashes. It wont stay open for more than a few seconds please fix this app  it is really the only good weather app.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Ordered this for one of the kids, she loves it.  I think the game is lacking in depth and is a time sink, but as long as she's happy.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Amazing! One of the best books I have ever read! I Loved it! I didn't want to put it down!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I read this book in only a week because I couldn't put it down.<br />The story is a hard reality of many people and how Donoghue used young Jack's voice to narrate the story makes so much easier to take in the harsh reality of Jack's life.<br />I would totally recommend to anyone interested in a moving and loving story!
B001R0LOES|5.0|I did not expect this to be as good as it was.  Great plot and the character development and action were good as well.  I highly recommend it.
B0050DIWFC|1.0|Couldn't put this book down. Well written & suspenseful. Loved the premise. Imagine being in this situation...makes you really wonder
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Just match the three jewels. Not much in the way of strategy involved but it is a nice way to waste some time. It has good graphics and sound. Beware: the makers are apparently non English writers as the instructions are a bit vague. You learn the rules as you play the game for the most part.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|Not even worth your money to rent let alone buy! Disney is really reaching a low in its movies. Bottom line don't waste your time or money.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I am yet to complete this book but already started loving it!<br />Pam has written the concepts and het thoughts in a very practical manner which is beyond all religions.
B002CGLX3S|5.0|There's just something about this song that makes you feel happy and sad all at once.  It tells some interesting stories of America's past and it is simply one of the best songs ever written.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Why do we even have weather guessers on TV anymore?  We always go to the weather Channel on our phones/
B000QCS8TW|5.0|It was exciting informative and educational.  There was nothing I didn't like about the book. I encourage everyone to read it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Does everything that I need for a nice early wake up. I use my Phone as well but with the stand I for the Kindle when I wake up early i can easily see the screen.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|At first I did not know what to think of this show but as I watched it I fell in love with it.  You really connect with the characters and you come to love them.  I finished the entire series in like no time because it was just so good. Can't wait until the new season.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I loved this series, even the middle books of the series which were a bit slow.<br />This one is not. This is very well written out. I am not missing any wrap up of sub-plots although there are some things that is still left to the imagination, though I think that is necessary for a series like this or it would feel really strange that it all ended. If you have stuck with it this far I believe you will not be disappointed in this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun game...it is challenging but not impossible.....lots of fun to play over and over!  Definitely worth purchasing.
B00CKJTOHO|5.0|This season is full of interesting revelations. I have been extrememly pleased with the way it is progressing. If you are a Dexter fan you won't be disappointed!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|cause i have played it before and i liked it ,it is easy to play and a challenge to beat the gofher
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|The ending was ridiculous! I can't even believe the publisher allowed that sort of ending from a professional author. Many questions were left unanswered. Don't waste your money.
B003G4W49C|5.0|One of the best books of the last half century.  Just too bad young people don't read so much anymore. Maybe the electronic availability will jump start some more readers of outstanding fiction.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I would recommend it. It works very well.  Can't say much more than that, it's Google for heaven's sake, just &#34;Google it&#34;.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|this a very addictive game and also very frustrateing but I enjoy making the effort.  I know others should like the game.
B00CLZ48FA|5.0|Movie was great. Blu-ray was superior quality. Did not like James Franco in that role. I saw it in the theater in 3-D and it was great.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|love the game its so much fun for a kid my age.  the game is so realistic I feel like I'm in the game
B000001EGE|4.0|Still Great! I love the classic Elton John! I am going to buy Empty Sky and totally enjoy myself today.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Its okay, I have found better, but I do not use it at all right now. I have too much work to play solitare
B0046B3QTG|5.0|Knocked Over--- super fluffy and hilarious.  This is a classic and great movie fo everyone.  Despicable Me 2 is also super.
B00CM96A60|5.0|Another excellent album from Armin.  Thanks again this has already seen me through several project deliverables.  Well done my friend.
B00COGXGNQ|4.0|this was a very well-made movie and a nice chick flick to kick back and enjoy.  Because I read the book, I thought the book was better - the love scene in the movie was not in the book - I know that the movie likely needed the love scene for better ratings, but it was not necessary and a little bit far-fetched in the movie - the love story was more believable in the book.
B00D3V5V7U|4.0|This album, while it lacks some of the original creative spark of old Black Sabbath, it certainly carries on the legacy of heavy rhythm and dark pensive lyrics. A good work from the Godfathers and founders of Heavy Metal
1560100842|5.0|It is a book that worth me to pay for it! A lot of examples!<br />A lot of detailed description!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Almost the same as the computer version and the update makes it even better.even ARMOUR and all the basic monsters.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A fun end of the day brain tickle. I enjoyed the challenge and look forward to something just as fun.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Blitz brigade is the most fun game I have in my inventory.It's just like CALL IS DUTY. Playing online is the best part of this. And missions are fun too.
B004GJYROG|5.0|Got this movie for my 11 year old daughter, who loves Looney Tunes, and she absolutely LOVED this movie. It was one I remembered enjoying when I was much younger, and was happy to have my daughter enjoy it as well.
B001O1O71C|5.0|It really describes the history of the Germans reign and showed what true friendship for life is just like Bruno and schmuel
B00A6RCSKC|5.0|Alright. Kingdom Rush.<br />I've played many similar, but not as good, defense games.<br />It has no major story but has a good cause to fight. The usual save the place you live just because you live there stuff.<br />I love the game but, why have hiring heroes cost money? Why not stars or diamonds? The characters are small and cute. I love how when you call  for back up and you click on a dude it says their name. Not the people in the towers though.<br />My only complaint is that when you kill an enemy there is a little pool of blood. It is not horrible gross. It disappears after like.....2 seconds. It is just kinda......THERE.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Both the audio and video quality are excellent. This is a series that you can watch over and over again.
B000HF2NTE|1.0|Someone reviewing this movie titled their review \\"What a movie!\\" and gave it 5 stars.  Do you suppose that someone was Sylvester Stallone?  He's the only semi-higher self-aware life form in the universe who might so judge this worthless and utterly pointless piece of excrement.<br /><br />Stallone is easily one of the 2 or 3 worst actors of all time.  He is also, tragically, one of the most prolific.  Once he latches onto a cinematic idea that more than 5 or 6 people will buy into, he assaults the living universe with sequel after ever more odious sequel, until the universe begs him for mercy.  I personally lay awake at nights, shivering in a cold sweat, thinking about the release of Cobra XXXVII: Cobra Versus the Giant Venusian Tapeworms Who Infiltrate All of California's Lavender Colored Butt Plugs.<br /><br />If one were to make a list of all the things that mankind engendered to offend God, \\"Sylvester Stallone Movies\\" would appear somewhere on page 1.  Reality normalized Amazon movie rating: 822 unripe raspberries.
B0082SU98U|5.0|What a delightful story!  It is just the right book to read when one is overwhelmed by life's pressures.  This book is about people who struggle through difficult times, yet overcome them despite the odds.  I recommend this book for all ages, from children (about 7 or 8) through senior citizens.  It is well-written with a challenging vocabulary.  My only regret is that I never read it as a child, and I never  read it to my own children as they were growing up.  But, I am recommending that they read it as adults!
B0045INOCO|1.0|If you think weirdness for its own sake is cool, by all means.  If you think \\"down with the establishment\\" is chic, go for it.  If, on the other hand, you look for something redeeming, moving, uplifting, or meaningful in a movie (or a book or a play or a poem), then move along; nothing to see here.<br /><br />One could improve this movie immensely by cutting out all scenes not containing W.C. Fields.  This would reduce the movie to its appropriate length, zero (and return to me the 2-1/2 hours of my life I wasted watching it).  The producers would have made a much greater contribution to human society had they spent their money to obtain some real life experiences for Coppola and Sheen, and maybe a few writing and acting lessons as well.<br /><br />Vietnam represents a complex era in American history.  Even now it is not well understood, nor is its significance appreciated.  It is not a sad and dark chapter of American history because of our military.  It is sad and dark because we were led into it by a cognitively challenged, clueless, socialist democrat president, LBJ, and led to view it in a bad light by a bunch of cognitively challenged, socialist American traitors including the likes of John Kerry, Jane Fonda, Martin Sheen, Noam Chomsky, et al ad naseum, the same debilitating, stinking social infection that sickens America and American culture even today.<br /><br />One thing is for sure: a hip, anti-establishment, arrogant, empty-headed pseudo-intellectual charlatan (i.e., your typical 20th century liberal) is not going to shed any light on the Vietnam experience.  Quite the contrary, his or her contribution will tend more toward the olfactory, emphatically more toward the odious, and hugely more toward the dark of an airless sewer pipe.  Light and air are not things a liberal such as Coppola or Sheen would understand or recognize even if it delivered them a swift kick to the ass.<br /><br />Sadly, the Amazon rating scale is biased toward the positive.  I would give this movie a \\"reality normalized\\" rating of about -12 stars.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|It is a great story and Catching Fire will be even better!!!  The action and acting are perfect and there is no lull in the story. It is true to the book for the most part which is rare for most movies.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual, Grisham is the very best entertainment one can find.  The characters are colorful and the plot ingenious.  A delightful return to total fiction; a fantasy with a happy ending.
B00C1BU7V8|2.0|I love history, however, rather than a drama - this film should be reclassified almost as a documentary.  The entire movie is winning votes for the 13th amendment.  Daniel Day Lewis, Sally Field, and Tommy Lee Jones however, all do an exemplary jobs.  The movie just isn't what I expected.
B0048WQDIE|1.0|Tepid story. Child-like narrative. Silly jokes. Rather puzzled about why the book is so famous (the reason I read it). I guess one has to be very very American to get it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is great it is really addicting i like it when it getsvreally fast so it gets really challenging favorite video gane
B0060MYM7O|4.0|I will not stop watching Game of Thrones. The books are thrilling, and the episodes in Season One did not disappoint. What damages the Second Season, I think, is an increase in gratuitous cruelty and actually quite tireless, because so frequent and overdone, nudity and graphic sexual activity. A brainy audience doesn't need that carrot. Season Two does end on a high note, a creepy cliff hanger.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|The Sigma Force is drawn into action knowing they have 4 days to save the planet from global destruction from meteorites.  Satellites are recording dark energy from a comet that is very close to Earth.  One of the satellites passes through the tail of the comet to pick up the dark energy for scientific study, but chaos occurs when the satellite crashes to the earth in the area of Mongolia.  As the satellite falls, a recorded video shows all of the major cities of the east coast of the United States are lying in ruins.  The Sigma Force will need to find the downed satellite and salvage the crystal that stored the dark energy.  The satellite can not fall into the enemy hands so there will only be a small team sent to recover the satellite.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Vigor and Rachel (in Italy) make a discovery from relics from the time of Attila the Hun, which also indicate that the world will end in 4 days.  Once they contact Sigma Force leader, Painter Crowe; Vigor and Rachel are included into the team.  They are looking for more relics with clues from Genghis Khan and Saint Thomas to save the world from destruction.<br /><br />Gray, Kowalski and Seichen are in Macau (China) looking for Seichen's mother.  They get into trouble can not join the team until they save one of the team members who was kidnapped and being tortured.<br /><br />I don't want to give away the plot, but be prepared as two of our favorite characters will die.  This was a fantastic book and I could not sleep until I finished the book.  There was some very important information on quantum physics.  I did not feel this was difficult to understand and I think it was the best scientific addition  to any of the Sigma Force novels so far.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|Interesting story about Lincoln during the Civil War.  Guess our politics are always mixed up. The acting was excellent and the pace of the movie was moderate.
B00BSBVLF8|4.0|The movie was very cool, not as good as being there for the real thing but still fun to watch!!
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I have watched The Good Wife since it started and it is one of my favorite.  With a change in my Comcast box I can not longer record this to watch the next day so I found I could watch it on Amazon on my IPad. Great!!!
B004HD61KE|5.0|One of the better books I've read in years. Constantly keeps the reader on edge and ready to keep going.
B0078Q2HAA|5.0|Meryl Streep did a fantastic acting job with this movie.  Learned a great deal about Thatcher from the story and a book I read.  Odd feeling, the day after I watched this Margaret Thatcher died.
B0093X805W|5.0|Read this book out loud to me kids this week while on holiday.  We all loved it!  Highly recommend this delightful book.
B00BHU2A7I|5.0|Hopkins did a great job playing Alfred Hitchcock.  Learned a bit about his life and that of his wife.  Well done movie.
B001DTTG16|3.0|Fans of The L-Word might enjoy watching Bette Porter (Jennifer Beal) in her early seminal work. Unfortunately, Flashdance is based on the contemporary theory that humans are incapable of maintaining an attention span of more than a minute or two and suffers from being edited into thousands of quick little bursts of video. The cinematography, however, has some interesting twists and angles that make the film worth studying.<br /><br />So if you want to see Bette take her bra off underneath her sweatshirt (does she even take her bra off in six seasons of The L-Word?), then this is the movie for you. If you want to see Jennifer Beal dancing, however, you will be disappointed ... they used a stand-in.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Amazing acting, great story!  So glad there are so many seasons to watch!  It deals with real life situations and tough ethical questions.
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|This is a fun movie.  In the same genre as Van Helsing. Lots of action, humor, great for an plan flight
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is one of the best escape puzzle games. Challenging but not so difficult as to frustrate.  Thanks for a great game.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|This movie is history, personal narrative, and great acting.  Highly recommended.  Make your kids watch it (at least some of it).
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Don't judge Brad Cooper by Las Vegas - he's got some acting depth, and the characters and relations in this movie go way beyond cheap laughs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|even though I am stuck in the 6th room I love this game I feel maybe they should give you a hint or 2 when you get stuck,my 7 year old grandchild helps me often. I have told my friends about this game and they love it also.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|I love the books. I can't put it down. I'm also watching the Series ,and now know more about it :)
B005HSL626|5.0|great game, it really makes you alert, my grandchild has this game on her phone and I had to get it. Any one who has a phone, kindle or tab should get this game it is great
B008IJT0CE|4.0|Wonderful sounds and easy to use. There's even a convenient timer. My only complaint is the number and kind of sounds that you get from switching from the free version to the paid version weren't that great. Still VERY happy.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very fun game.  Can't wait for more. If you like puzzle games you will love this one.  Goes fast but it's worth it.
0446343129|1.0|I'm actually in the process of getting off sugar for good and yet, I still hated this book. After talking about his own journey, he promises to give a detailed history of sugar and explain why it harms us. He totally fails. He just makes stuff up, without any sources or backing for a vast majority of it. He just makes some outrageous claims, like that people in rural areas escaped the plague because they had less sugar in their diets. Pffft! They escaped the plague because they didn't live in a cramped location surrounded by infected people! I was really hoping that this book would encourage me to get off sugar, but in the end, I just ended up tossing it. It's the first book that I've ditched before finishing in years, so that says something. Sugar can be a real problem and there's a lot of good information in other books out there. Just skip this one.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It sort of basic but is ok. Every age group plays it and can .. My 8yr old daughter play it at school and is trying to beat my score /:
B0092QITO2|3.0|I feel that the original Total Recall was great at presenting a complex story that really had to make you stop and think about what was real, and what was an implanted story.  However, I feel like this remake, though it swayed from the story aspect, was still very entertaining.<br /><br />The remake even pays tribute to the original with a few references and identical scenes, but thankfully, is not a shot-for-shot remake (as was done with the disappointing \\"Footloose\\").  The story seems much easier to follow and not as complex, but this remake seems to have much better action sequences and (mostly because of updates in technology) better special effects.<br /><br />Strangely, I feel like the first hour was actually more engaging then the second, but I do feel that overall, this movie was worth watching.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Excellent  season. Can't imagine what next for this family.  But I know Ill be watching it. Its the best british showw
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I wish you didn't have to wait to read the other book. That is what makes people upset. You are right in the middle and its suppose to be the last book then boom it's not and it is gonna take awhile before the next one.
B001I1D782|5.0|I have listened to this album since it's release in 1968. I saw it performed at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit. Jeff just about blew Rod off the stage with his twin Marshall stacks.<br />This is the greatest, cleanest and full spectrum version of Truth ever. Sure, I would gladly buy a 32 bit SACD if it were available. I definitely notice the improvement of the SHM media. The Stereo Image is absolutely MONSTER, and my compatibility meter agrees. At the present date, this version cannot be beat. Maybe Sony will make a Blu-Spec 2 edition.<br />I listened to this on my REALLY EXPENSIVE Pro Audio playback system. I clearly heard many parts that were previously obscured in the muddy signal-to-noise ratio of the previous editions. There is even an earlier version where some moron added reverb to the original recording, making it worthless.<br />Rod really owes Jeff a debt here for his beginning. When I saw him, he appeared like a frightened kid trying to hide on the left side of the stage.<br />This version has a number of very interesting bonus tracks. There is another version of You Shook Me, an unreleased Blues DeLuxe and a mono mix of Beck's Bolero with an extra part at the end. The 18 tracks include Tallyman, High-Ho Silver Lining, I've Been Drinking Again and an additional really super version of Rock My Plimsoul. The out of character Love is Blue, which was producer Mickey Most's concept is here also.<br />This album is jammed with special appearances by Jeff's notable friends. The added clarity of this recording enables you can to hear Jimmy Page and Keith Moon on Beck's Bolero. Keith also plays on Old Man River. Ron Wood, now a Rolling Stone is a excellent Bass player on this album.<br />This is still my absolute favorite Jeff Beck Album and period. He has been very creative at reinventing himself over the decades and may be the greatest living electric guitar player. In his more modern playing, he has chosen to eliminate guitar picks in favor of the more expressive sound of his fingertips. He has created unique techniques that involves using both left and right hands on the guitar neck simultaneously.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I finally received my Anker Gaming mouse, the quality of the product is superb, I've been using it for 1 day so far I hope it last enough so I could write a more comprehensive review. It feels very comfortable and I can access most of my buttons now using only the mouse which I hope will improve my APM ratings (I wanted it for RTS games). The only thing I found is that I comes with 4 DPI profiles and is manageable at the first 2, the higher DPI are for me hard to control. The weights that come with it could increase precision if you go for higher DPI, but I'm ok at level 2.
B003M70O5O|5.0|Best show I have seen in a very long time, exciting exhilarating edge of seat drama, bring on next season!
B001ENS0BI|5.0|I hated it ending.  Loved that they were all still friends.  I could see another season since tag is in prison.  Escapes again?
B00CGPPMKU|3.0|Probably won't use this much but it is a novelty and and grandson may enjoy it . . .as with lots of things it takes time to explore for its use.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This book could have been about 150 pages shorter and still easily gotten it's message across. None the less, once I got to the second half of the book and the story started to gel I really enjoyed it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|What an innovation . . . to be able to download any book that you have in the Amazon library and then read it!  In seconds . . .
B00846REIS|5.0|This story is HOT!!! OMG! I couldn't put it down! I fell in love with Christian and Ana in the 50 Shades trilogy. This story is similar but stands on it  own. I love the relationship between Gideon and Eva. They are frank and open and  honest about how they feel. It is refreshing. Gideon is sexy as all hell! I love the conversation  and  the  openness and the sexual dialogue. I got hot and bothered right along with them. I am cheering them on, anxious to see the truth come out, to see Gideon begin healing from his painful past, and to see Eva stand by her man. This is an awesome story and  I can not recommend it strongly enough! Love  it and moving on to part two right now!!

B00B7NPRY8|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time. I forgot how good it was until I read it again, hooked like it was my first time reading.
0553386816|5.0|All of these stories are page turners,sometimes making you laugh right out loud, but the funniest and most on point was the lawyer who got the \\"big case\\" out of the blue, and figured out how to keep the money and disappear.<br />This fantasy is prevalent among the everyday working attorneys in my town, who if they are like me have been waiting for the big one, for over thirty years.  We may not cut the corners he did to get there, but we all want to get there.
B0083GQKQG|4.0|Tulsa Swinton was amazing. You could truly feel her frustrations, guilt....All range of emotions. It goes back to the idea that sometimes there is a &#34;bad seed&#34; and there is no hope for a child no matter what you do.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|These books are so catching you never know what you are going to learn next. I love it. Definitely worth the time to sit down and read them.
0345803507|4.0|I have read all three books and the series is interesting but written immaturely. At times it was too repetitive. It was interesting and exciting at times.
B00006ZXSK|5.0|Owned this on VHS, but since I have all flat screens now, I needed to update.  There have been many versions of the Cinderella story. My husband and I both love this one because it elaborates on the characters and the plot. It is funny, endearing as well as adventurous. It is definitely one of my favorite love story movies. No sex, no war or violence, but the best revenge story that will make you laugh.
B00AR83PN4|2.0|Playing the game for 10 minutes will leave you frustrated.  The camera actively works against you. The isometric angle and close zoom don't leave you enough time to see the piece or where to place it. Using yellow and gold for different pieces added an additional level of needless frustration.<br /><br />I got it for free and still feel ripped off.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|The game has good graphics.  The search and find was just the right amount of difficulty.  Not difficult to find your way around.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Love love love this series. Can't wait for more! This has been the best story ever and I can't wait to see what happens next.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|What a great book! Every kid and parent should read!  A great lesson for any age!  All my kids will read this when they are older.
044024613X|5.0|This came when it was supposed to and in the condition required.  It was a great book and I couldn't put it down Kept my attention from the beginning and it focused on bullying and the repurcussions that can happen
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Best series I have ever seen - outstanding acting and characters portrayed.....lessons of a life well lived in each episode......I will miss it now that I have reached the conclusion.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|This is a beauty app that should feature ways to style, cut, and dye hair.But the hair is impossible to style. It is separated pieces that look the best fate  a blow dry with no brushing. I have tried brushing and straightening,but nothing makes this girl look presentable. It is frustrating and I wouldn't recommend this app to anyone.
B008602KQI|4.0|interesting movie, how ever people who are not syfy fans will  be quick to point out all the obvious problems with this concept.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|I love Sophie Kinsella.  Everything she writes I enjoy.  This one was cute and entertaining. No surprises though, very predictable.  That is not a criticism.  I enjoy her story lines.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|This book was a very good book though the poems weren't good the storyline was a good one as well as the character development. The relationship between Will and Layken was such an adult one and more realistic than a novel made one. The supporting characters were awesome also I loved Will and Lake's little brothers even Lake's mother and the bid reveal that Lake's mother revealed I was like \\"Whaaaaaaat?!\\". But overall I really enjoyed this book and I think that you should get this book too I'm sure you will enjoy it and you won't regret it at all.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Took me a little bit of time to get used to making it my &ldquo;go to&ldquo; for everything I wanted to remember, but once I earnestly made a little effort to do that, it worked so well. I use it instead of &ldquo;favorites&ldquo; to remember websites because then they are on any device. But, it's so much more because you can easily keep thoughts or ideas organized . You can copy parts of articles that you want to remember , like a quote from an author.  Bonus- the layout is easy to use and display concise and neat.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|my boys loved this set...simple to build, even for my 4 year old.  My boys liked the motorcycle and Captain America's shield.

1587143879|5.0|This library is a must have for anyone looking to pursue their CCNA!  Wendell Odom is one of my favorite Cisco Press authors, whom I've had the great pleasure of meeting recently at Cisco Live 2013!<br />The library has two books which are broken down to focus on their particular portion of the CCNA, the ICND1 and ICND2.  Both books come with a CD loaded with videos, tools, and software that can be utilized in learning the material required by any CCNA level engineer.<br />The videos included in this series offer a proper walkthrough the topics covered in the blueprint.  Everything from subnetting to configuring routing protocols.<br />There are also games included that are an excellent source of brain training and great for quick and fun training.<br />These books are meant to assist you, challenge you, and cover the topics that you will be covered in the CCNA exam.  Whether you break it up into the two ICND exams or to take the composite exam you will find this library more than useful.<br />Practice exams and simulations will test you on the topics you have learned and prepare you for the type of questions you will see on the exam.<br />Again, this series is a must have.  Not only for those studying for an exam, but also for those who are just beginning a career in the networking field, and I highly recommend it's purchase.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|What a wonderful book, another home run for Mr. Gaiman. My only complaint about his books is that they are too short, and too few and far between (the adult titles, anyway).  There were times, reading this book, that I would just shake my head in wonder at the evocative prose this author produces, the sense of universal human experience he brings forth.<br />More, please!
B000JMKQX0|1.0|The book is many short descriptions of events during the war. Different characters but all written with the same gung ho macho toughness. It was the same story told over and over again. It would have been nice if the author could have developed at least one character. By the end of the book, I couldn't remember a single character. Disappointed.
B001GXTXTO|5.0|Just one of those albums that are good from start to finish.  A must own for anyone who loves music!

B00884GR0W|5.0|I really enjoy this game. I have a level 43 character right now. However, there should be one or two new ores or bosses that drop ores. Also there should be more quest n.p.c.s.
B004HD61KE|5.0|After having read all of Steve Berry 's available books, Mr. Rollins was recommended by a friend, and I felt right at home!  Very similar in style, both use numerous stories occurring simultaneously and weave them all together into an exciting, cohesive story line.  Awesome and ever-engrossing technique!  I can't wait to dig into more of Mr. Rollins' work.  Thank you!
B00CH26TL8|3.0|I'm just being honest here this is a great game really I'm serious it's not that bad but I'm asking no I'm begging for you to please put candy crush saga on the kindle Fire please that's all I want,I would really appreciate and so would a lot of other people .Now I sound impatient but I have wasted money buying fake candy games you certainly have the time to make that but not put candy crush on.

B0012HEB32|4.0|I enjoyed the story - it had some changes from the movie versions of Terminator but was overall pretty well don
0545586178|5.0|Catching Fire is a great sequel to The Hunger games book1. It's very difficult to transport all the gamesmanship from book1 to book 2, however, Suzanne Collins and her team of writers have done marvelous at it. Katniss Everdeen is in big trouble here, yet the author polarizes us with scene after scene of Katniss making smooth transitions from star heroine to a needling weakling. The author blends her characters into the script so well that you would think that each one of them is riding on the coattails of the previous one. However, I often found myself asking the question; who is the real fire catcher, is it Katniss or perhaps the entire district 12, or perhaps it's the capital. The author's dialogue mixtures are superb and without flaws. Overall, another great book by an already accomplished and wonderful writer.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|I bought this as a gift for a family member who likes the series. I thought it was okay as far as it was, I just think the first film took the surpise and awe out of it for me.<br />It's still a good flick though!
1439170916|5.0|As a diagnosed breast cancer patient in the midst of chemotherapy, I read this book as a coping mechanism, hoping that Mukherjee's historical and scientific perspective on cancer would give me some kind of means of dealing with the teeter-totter of hope and despair that a cancer diagnosis brings with it.<br /><br />It helped, sort of.<br /><br />Which seems to be the truth about cancer therapy these days for breast cancer. There is no \\"cure\\" for breast cancer, really. They help, but as Mukherjee says in the latter part of the book, \\"Perhaps cancer, the scrappy, fecund, invasive, adaptable twin to our own scrappy, fecund, invasive, adaptable cells and genes, is impossible to disconnect from our bodies.\\"<br /><br />And while the later chapters detail the fascinating and hope-giving development of scientists isolating the very over-expressing genes for certain types of leukemia and HER-positive breast cancer that led to targeted therapy drugs (despite pharmaceutical and academic rivalries and bureaucratic fumbling) such as Gleevec and Herceptin, the sense that these developments are just drops in the pond can not be escaped.<br /><br />What I learned from this book, is that cancer is a genetic disease, not in the sense of inheritance among families (although that is true for certain kinds of cancers) but that cancer is so deeply written into our own genetic makeup that fighting it requires massive sequencing of the Human genome and each, specific cancer's genome (even \\"breast cancer\\" is deceivingly simple in its nomenclature. Each breast cancer is its own beast and may or may not respond to current chemo-therapies, or may respond only so long as the cells take to develop a resistance) as well as time spent in exhaustive trial and error trying to find molecules that will turn off over-expressing genes or replace deleted ones.<br /><br />And that's a bit depressing.<br /><br />On the other hand, Mukherjee's book starts with the image of the Persian Queen Atossa in 500 BC cutting off her breast in a primitive mastectomy, travels through medieval medicine treating breast cancer with acid and fire, Halsted's radical mastectomies that cut through collarbone and muscle, amazing, highly toxic chemotherapies practiced on patients without consent and without accompanying anti-nausea drugs, and primitive radiation therapy to travel up through 2009 where therapy for cancer isn't so devastatingly scary.<br /><br />The human faces Mukherjee puts both on patients and scientists involved in this tale make each discovery or misguided therapy even more poignant.<br /><br />Mukherjee is a masterful writer, bringing cancer 'alive' with both science and philosophy and plain, human emotions.<br /><br />Even if you are not, as I was, looking for some reassurance or perspetive on a disease you or a loved one might be experiencing, this book is worthwhile just for the amazing sense Mukherjee gives us of how science evolves inside human society alongside disease and politics.<br /><br />The prose is accessible to laymen, the explanations of trials and experiments never dry, and the story it tells is deeply intertwined with modern life.cutting off her breast in a primitive mastectomy, travels through medieval medicine treating breast cancer with acid and fire, Halsted's radical mastectomies that cut through collarbone and muscle, amazing, highly toxic chemotherapies practiced on patients without consent and without accompanying anti-nausea drugs, and primitive radiation therapy to travel up through 2009 where therapy for cancer isn't so devastatingly scary.<br /><br />The human faces Mukherjee puts both on patients and scientists involved in this tale make each discovery or misguided therapy even more poignant.<br /><br />Mukherjee is a masterful writer, bringing cancer 'alive' with both science and philosophy and plain, human emotions.<br /><br />Even if you are not, as I was, looking for some reassurance or perspetive on a disease you or a loved one might be experiencing, this book is worthwhile just for the amazing sense Mukherjee gives us of how science evolves inside human society alongside disease and politics.<br /><br />The prose is accessible to laymen, the explanations of trials and experiments never dry, and the story it tells is deeply intertwined with modern life.

B008YZ4RR0|5.0|Tom Selleck has always been one of my favorite actors way back with Magnum, PI.  The Jesse Stone movies have always been great.  I can't pick a favorite since everyone I've seen get my attention for the whole movie.  Tom Selleck is a natural for the character of Jesse Stone.<br />He's also excellent in the TV drama Blue Bloods.
B00D8OHPF8|4.0|The new LP From Joe is a great reintroduction to old school R&B.  Not as good as his My Name is Joe album but frankly that is one of my favorite albums ever and I do not think much is as good as that one is.  If you love old school R&B you should pick this album up.
B0029EDMEG|5.0|Another great Tom Selleck movie.  I've never been disappointed with any of his movies. I have a couple more to see and I'm sure they will be great, too.

B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This movie really hit home for me and Bradley Cooper's portrayal of a Bi-Polar man was brilliant, funny, and sad all at the same time.  Jennifer Lawrence was awesome as a bitter woman trying to find her way in life. Fabulous and touching.  Letting go of someone you love who doesn't love you back is hard.
B005GU8ILW|5.0|Big fan of Ed Sheeran so hearing him on the vinyl was great! Great sound and great quality! Love the color orange vinyl as well!
B00338QENI|5.0|This book was truly amazing.  I believed it to be non-fiction, then I seriously doubted it because it was such a wild almost Hollywood type story so I went on line to check it out and found that it absolutely is true and is non-fiction.  That family has been totally taken advantage of and somehow should receive recompence for their ill-treatment.  I believe that any drug or other company who used her cells for profit owe the Lack family a lot of money.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Very fun game. I love playing this game. It's tons of fun and you can play different characters. It's kind of like temple run but with kids.
B00863DOL0|5.0|Ok, so it doesn't have much by way of extras, but I'm from an era when such things didn't matter too much!<br />Ignoring such limitations, the concert (when viewed more than once!) is truly excellent.<br />Unlike the two previous Blackmores Night dvd's, this 2011 production shows the current band in full flight, & performing mostly more recent songs, which is a refreshing change for Mr Blackmore who usually likes to stick with the tried & true (he did with all DP & Rainbow live recordings anyway).<br />Having said that, Fires At Midnight is a truly exceptional performance.<br />What really stands out to me, is that Candace Night has finally taken full responsibility for her vocals. There is very little by way of backing vocals these days as her voice has matured to a strength & comfort that she now sounds wonderfully in control.<br />The low point (if one can call it that), is the moment when both Ritchie & Candace leave the stage briefly. It seems to me the band doesn't take proper advantage of the opportunity to show off.<br />And for the Maestro...as a solo player of various acoustic stringed instruments, Blackmore is now an absolute master. Bravo!<br />As for the electric Stratocaster...he gives me the impression that he'd like nothing more than a chance to once again jam with rock musos, but his current path restricts such desires.<br />Maybe one day he will figure out that it is actually possible to do both...!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The quality of this recording is very good and the story lines and excellent acting, costumes, scenery and story lines are superb. Loved it

B0089EHWQE|4.0|This was a book club book that my group read for the month of June and we will be discussing it at next meeting on July 7th.  For my part it was a real eye opener for what quads and their care givers go through and all the emotional stress.  I love the way the two main characters interacted with one another but have to admit my heart just broke for the care giver who really got emotionally involved with her heart and soul.<br /><br />This was an excellent book club choice and I would highly recommend it.

B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Waited along time for this one and it was well worth the wait. This one is my favorite. I like this more than 50 shades of grey there's just more emotion and story to it you can get into the characters more and feel they're love and pain. Ive heard of a forth book which I hope is true this is one of those stories you don't want to end.

006178480X|5.0|For me this ended up as one of the best James Rollins books to date.  All the great characters are in this one as well as some new ones.  We see his usual fact based fiction that adds a dash of the next step to make it cool.  Its fast paced and gets right into the action early.  I really loved the quantum physics stuff in this one.  I know a smidge about this and this just made me want to read some more.  The ending felt a tad rushed which added to the excitement of the book.  All and all a great summer read and I hope sometime soon a movie studio picks up these books as movies they would be amazing.
B005LAIHZE|4.0|If you know a little bit about history and enjoy a well-done, classic-style vampire flick, go ahead and give this a try. Actually it is a good \\"companion\\" movie to academy award nominated \\"Lincoln\\" in that \\"Lincoln\\" provides a history-refresher that will prep the viewer for this movie. It's interesting to see that the two follow roughly the same period and events. A couple of differences with ALVH is that it starts when Lincoln was a boy and, of course, unlike in Lincoln, in ALVH the troubles he faces in terms of his personal woes and political challenges are largely due to a small but vibrant and quite nasty vampire population.<br /><br />As in any good vampire movie there is the morally conflicted vampire (I won't say who that is) who the rest on the eternal-beings despise. Sure he has to live off human blood, but he is at least more discriminate in his choice of victims, picking low-life scums the type that cruelly prey on defenseless women.<br /><br />This movie is extremely clever in weaving the historic story and vampire legend into one film. There is a ton of violence, guts, gore and black and red blood in this movie. The fight scenes are elaborate, well choreographed, and rather artistic. The actors are fully committed to their roles, the friend and romance chemistry between them is wonderful, and you do ache in this movie for the down trodden to succeed.<br /><br />As a lover of smart, original, off-beat, well-acted films with excellent cinematography this easily could have been a five star film for me. The one area where if falls short, in my opinion, is squandering the opportunity to weave one key historical event into the fabric of the vampire story. I won't be a spoiler by saying what specifically, but for me this was the one flat point in an otherwise exceptional film.

030758836X|3.0|Gone Girl is the first novel I've read by Gillian Flynn. I don't read a lot of suspense/thriller novels, but I made time for this one because I'd seen all the positive reviews. It mostly earns the praise it has received -- the writing is good, the characters are well-drawn, and you spend much of the story wondering what in the world is going on.<br /><br />The basic premise, in case you didn't read it above, is this: On the day of their fifth wedding anniversary, Nick Dunne's wife, Amy, goes missing from their house under very suspicious circumstances (signs of a struggle in the living room, the door left open). The reader isn't told exactly what happened, but what's clear is that Amy is gone and it doesn't look good for Nick, who almost immediately begins lying to the police (why, we aren't told, but he does tell us in his narrative sections when he is lying).<br /><br />The novel is narrated alternately by Nick, in real-time following Amy's disappearance, and by Amy, through a diary that she had kept up until sometime before her disappearance. So you can get different perspectives on their relationship, and sometime on the same events. The novel is often, in addition to being a thriller, an interesting take on modern relationships. Flynn is a good, thoughtful writer and the book is engaging all the way up to the end.<br /><br />There are plenty of twists and turns to keep you turning pages late into the night, and I won't spoil them here. As to my overall review: I can't give the book fewer than three stars, because 95% of it was really engaging, really fun reading. I can't give it more than three stars, however, because the ending was...disappointing. Without spoiling anything, I will say that once you've figured out what's happened and who the bad guys are, you really want the novel's conclusion to deliver some catharsis. It doesn't. This is clearly a deliberate choice on Flynn's part, and it makes sense given her interest in sort of poking fun at/analyzing howmarriages work and don't work. But in terms of giving the reader what he or she will almost certainly want at the end of this novel, it's a complete let-down.<br /><br />I was actually annoyed as I closed the book, which is no way to feel when finishing a novel. Especially one that is really good until the last few pages. It's mostly a fun read if you've got a blank spot on your to-read list, and I will be following this author in the future, but, boy oh boy, what a disappointing ending.
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Two things I dislike in games. One a game that is always trying to get you to buy coins or like on Facebook. Two game that makes you wait 30 or so minutes to play again. This one does all three. So DELETE. good by Bubble Witch. Maybe game developers will lean if enough if US DELETE.
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|i enjoy this song, i love the work that joe puts out for his fans,every CD that he do i will by it
B003XVYLDU|4.0|the title is appropriate and a symbol of the destruction of dresden and so many lives in european war 2, the former an unpunished war crime and particularly hideous for a german descendant, kurt.  irony is the prisoners' survival in a former slaughterhouse while most of the people of the city were exterminated.  the story uses a form of stream of consciousness, existentialism/futility theme and a barking dog symbolism.  the lack of justice is revealed in the execution of an american pow for stealing a teapot, another symbol.  there is the constant theme of lives on the border of insanity and all lives lived irrationally.  to get to the core of the book requires several readings, but like other of vonnegut's books the story will recur in the reader's mind.  it's not surprising that this book is not widely touted since it is not a &#34;rally 'round the flag boys&#34; book.
B000T46O52|5.0|Such an amazing movie! Such a grand picture of how people with AIDS can be sterotyped or stigmatized. Great acting by both Denzel and Tom Hanks!
B001V7WC1Q|4.0|I really should have hated his movie, but I  was surprisingly intrigued. Kind of creepy and it looks like they might have spent 100.00 on the whole production, but it worked.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|I am a Viking geek and this series is true to what we historically know about my ancestors. It is very believable and the stories drew me in from the beginning. I can't wait for the next season. Please make it longer than 9 episodes!
B008ODZUN2|3.0|I did not finish it, but that does not mean it was bad.  I may not have been in the mood.  It was very low key.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Same sultry style we have come to accept from Bonnie Raitt. She has evolved to an even more thoughtful, bluesy, mature style.Brilliant!
B00BRUYQFC|5.0|JT is awesome. First CD of his I've listened to all the way through. Totally worth your time and money!
B000002HEP|5.0|Before they grew pop hooks and went into that area of expertise with QotSA there was Kyuss. And they were good. This is possibly, as others have noted, their epitome and I come back to this more or less as much as the QotSA Debut or even Rated R.<br /><br />Everything works here. The Sabbath tones are no coincidence. They rip them off well. And they do it with pride. But there is a detail with this band that is completely different and overall a fresh taste is left after listening. The sound is more grungy and free in some aspects, more cordoned off in others. Gardenia has that freedom vibe of grunge and stoner rock that we all must love with some deep grooves floating through. The second song, Asteroid, affirms they are here to stay in our minds. Each successive song mostly builds well off the preceding tracks and the whole album culminates in a cohesive work near the top of the heap.<br /><br />I would say this is an easy buy. Take a listen to see if you like the sound but if you are even remotely interested in stoner rock no question you need to hear this.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|Normally, these packages leave a lot to be desired. However, when bringing together all of the super heroes together to initially form the Avengers, the natural distaste some have for others seemed to be quite natural and well conceived and acted. No spoiler intended, but they do manage to assemble their talents for a rollicking good time with some super sfx and the only two characters that left this at a four star were, naturally, the Olympus brother gods who where quite good at portraying themselves as walk-ons and actors. Not quite enough to measure up to the others in the film.
B002361MLA|5.0|I would have discounted this book as hokum two years ago. After a spiritual search for some meaning in my life I had a friend sugges this book. There is truth in this book that I could feel deep in my bones. There is no need for me to say more than this: read the first dozen pages. If it doesn't strike a chord with you, put it down for a year and then try again. At some point you'll get it.
B004FOA84A|5.0|l never have loved a game this much before.I kept playing it over and over again.I couldn't put it down, but that's normal for a little girl isn't. it?
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This show keeps getting better and better. Now that we understand the characters from season 1 we followly them through the events of ww1. The season does jump in time without any warning so be ready for that. My underatanding is that the UK version is the best unrated version. So all in all. Watch it an enjoy
B002A5WQ8W|5.0|What more can I say? This is one of THE classic jazz albums from the 1950s, right up there with Miles Davis's Kind of Blue and Cannonball's Somethin' Else. If this isn't part of your collection or you have no plans to add it to your collection then you probably don't like jazz.
B005UBNKZG|3.0|I did not like the way the turbo core worked.<br />I bought the 6350 and have it at 4.4 stable and works better for me
B00AR83PN4|4.0|The game is challenging yes, but very easy to differentiate between yellow and gold and i have trouble with colors simple Tetris like game with 3d involved
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Very addictive, play everyday almost all day long.  I just cannot connect to Facebook on Kindle with this game but can on other games.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I seriously love this game. A lot of thought and detail was put into its making. The rewards are cool and make players want to play to earn then. The plot is neat, I mean, who doesn't want to run from the cops!? I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone. Happy surfing!
B00C061I3K|5.0|I liked this cd so much that I ordered one for myself, and 2 others for the teenage kids, one of my favorite that niles rodgers is on three songs, never really payed much attention to the Robots,  but after I heard get lucky which is one of my all  time favorite songs now, I checked them out on you tube and the web and have to say the robots rock, the best music to come out of France for sure, I'm not going to go into details about each song, sure someone has already and someone else will again,  I recommend every human being that likes music to purchase this cd, It is that good, Its good upbeat dance music too, This is the feel good dancing album of the summer and year, rock on robots rock on
B006N0YWGY|5.0|If he can play it, anyone can. I don't play games, but I enjoy hearing my grandson laugh and laugh as he plays it!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|There are many great joys in life and Disney, the creators of &#34;Wreck it Ralph&#34;, have always been experts at tapping into those emotions. It has been key to their success. Just like the characters in &#34;Toy Story&#34;, we all long to be needed and not necessarily loved, but liked. We want to be included. We want to know that there's somebody out there who thinks of us from time to time and quite simply, that is all that Ralph wants.<br /><br />Locked away inside his game between the hours of open and close of the arcade, Ralph is alone. He's a bad guy. The hero of his game, Fix-it Felix is the star. Felix is the one with the friends and who receives all the accolades. When the arcade closes up for the night, the characters can travel from game to game, they can socialize with each other, but Ralph is alone, with no friends to speak of. Ralph, voiced by John C. Reilly, wants people to like him. He wants people to be proud of him, but being locked away inside his game only allows him to destroy and then get thrown off a building. This triggers a nostalgic and incredibly creative adventure.<br /><br />&#34;Wreck it Ralph&#34; never really struck me as outwardly hilarious, but the movie is endlessly entertaining and loaded with imagery and blast from the past references. Also like &#34;Toy Story&#34;, another world occurs when people aren't looking and when that world takes off, the video game references from the past will go right over your child's head. The adults though, will recognize characters from Super Mario Bros, Sonic, Q*bert, Street Fighter, Joust, Frogger, Pac-Man, Burger Time, the bartender from the game Tapper and even paddle one and two from the ultra nostalgic game, Pong.<br /><br />Ralph means well, but like most animated movies, that doesn't always lead you in the correct direction. So, when he meets a sweet little 9-year old racer named Vanellope Von Schweetz, voiced by Sarah Silverman, he finds that he's not alone in his plight to be included. Vanellope is a glitch, a flawed character program, hidden away in the system, not allowed to play. The two of them may have formed one of the most memorable character bonds in recent history.<br /><br />While the movie may not be hilariously funny, &#34;Wreck it Ralph&#34; is sheer joy and fun and it taps into an emotion that many adults have forgotten and many kids know all too well. It reminds you what it is like that first time you realized that you had a friend. Your child will also see a nice example of friendship and loyalty. This, in my opinion, makes &#34;Wreck it Ralph&#34; not just a movie for kids, but for adults as well. With all the references of nostalgic games and its flawless reminder of how euphoric friendship is, &#34;Ralph&#34; is for everybody.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|It is difficult to weave a pre-quel between the amazing books and the revered movie from our childhood, but this movie does an incredible job. My daughters have read all of the books and seen the original movie and they were enthralled with the story and spectacle. A wonderful family movie that stuck with us for weeks.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like this game.  It is challenging and fun.  I would recommend this game to anyone who like to play cards.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great book, because the way Suzanne Collins writes her books Is so intriguing, how she places the words. But I have to say, book 1is definitely better.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|This is a great book.  It's to bad there are not more people in the world like Chris Kyle.  His family should be very proud.  Its people like him that make people like us be able to live and say what we want.  God Bless
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|Game is a lot of fun-you have to be on your toes so you don't miss a move.Challenging and exciting. Need more games of this type to download.
B004EC5IUW|5.0|Fairly shipped!Fast and surprising,it didn't take long for me to receive this package.Keep up the good work!<br />PS:Hope to have a plastic cover next time though.(Outside the cover)
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Hosseini is such a good writer and good story teller.  My only criticism is that I think And the Mountains Echoed jumps around somewhat gratuitously but I still recommend it.
B002I8PVQA|4.0|Here's the story:  I had seen the movie before and knew the plot, etc.<br /><br />I watched this movie again to experience the acting of Ed Norton who plays a character with physical and mental challenges.  Being able to see Norton go in and out of his character was worth my time.<br /><br />Everyone did a great job.  The plot is fun.<br /><br />If you select it, make a lot of popcorn.
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|I'm no artist, but even I could accidentally make some drawings that looked good with this app. I'm sure there are some ways more features could be added, but, I can find nothing to complain about.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I enjoy this type of puzzle and really appreciate how this one is crafted. The puzzles are multi-step but keep the pointless poking at things in the room to a minimum. I am looking forward to more levels!
B004C00EO6|5.0|A treat to see familiar faces still giving solid performances.  Am looking forward to the sequel coming out this summer.
B000FC2L1Y|4.0|After reading the 1st and 2nd books  of the Outlander series, I was disappointed in book 3. Drums of Autumn is back to good historical fiction within a science fiction thee. I liked it. On to book 5.
B007HU7NBK|2.0|Big Duran Duran fan here. 40 years old now and still listening. The book was flat compared to other rock bios (Andy Summers' was good). Maybe being a rock star just isn't very interesting. And leaving Andy out at the end was just a horribly permanent, passive-aggressive thing to do, especially after all that so-called healing. I hope this doesn't affect my ability to listen to the first couple of albums. If it does, I'll have some sore feelings towards Mr. J. Taylor.
B00C1C188I|4.0|Winstead is an excellent actor, and in this prequel to 1982's &#34;The Thing&#34;, merges seamlessly with the earlier movie. It's gross, it's creepy, and they're ZOMBIES!
B00CTXBO9M|5.0|It is about the most  addicting game ever! I got it on my IPod and now I have it on this!
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|The dialogues are still fantastic but the story line misses the sparkle of season 1. Please give poor Bates a rest and let him be happy for a season or two!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|super addicting and challenging game! the levels are tough and really test your mind! great game, especially since it's free..hours of fun.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Very addictive and spellbinding series.  Highly recommended and very entertaining.  We cannot wait for Season Three to begin, good clean fun for our family!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I would suggest this book to kids and adults it is a good book and it has an awesome morel it is in one of the top then books that I have read but I think that it may be somewhere between my 1 or my 2
B005544TRQ|5.0|I have immensely enjoyed this series.  I would recommend this series to anyone looking for a fun distraction from the stress of everyday life!
0761536434|4.0|Video games as a medium have been around for an extremely long time. Each console bringing it's own unique and memorable experiences to the plate. As the genre progresses and gains more recognition, it's all the more important that it's heritage be preserved for future generations to learn about. This is where \\"The Ultimate History Of Video Games\\" comes in. While other books devoted to gaming merely gloss over certain topics, \\"The Ultimate History Of Video Games\\" leaves absolutely no stone unturned and provides such an incredible wealth of information and detail that you'd swear you experienced it first hand. The book covers gaming from it's humble beginnings as mechanical games of chance all the way up to the introduction of the PS2, Gamecube, and XBOX.<br /><br />It also of course has several chapters devoted to the entirety of Atari's lifespan, dishing out more insight than you could ever hope to know. Like Nolan Bushnell (Atari's founder) stealing the idea for \\"Pong\\" from Ralph Baer (the creator of the Magnavox Odyssey) during a play through demonstration. The case was later taken to court and Atari had to pay Baer and Magnavox a small licensing fee. Apple founder Steve Jobs and his companion Woz were also present during the creation of the VCS/2600. Woz's re-design of the system was so incredibly tight that no one could duplicate it.<br /><br />So much is contained within this thick, \\"grade school sized\\" tome that is could have easily have been a book series, with each individual title devoted to a specific company's history. Mr. Kent did THAT good of a job on it. My only complaint is that sometimes the chapters feel a bit scattered. For instance, you could be reading about the historic crash of '82 and suddenly be learning about the creation of Donkey Kong and Activision. It's a mild gripe, but more thought should have been put into how the book was structured. Regardless, the book is an absolute necessity for any reader with even a passing interest in video games as a whole.
B005544V6A|5.0|Gabriel Macht makes every scene he's in a joy to watch. The writing is really clever too, as are the story lines, great entertainment all around.
B00B7Y0206|5.0|Some apps are useful, some apps are needed, some you could do without while other apps are just plain fun. This app is useful and fun. I especially like the search engine. When I use it I get a good sense of what youtube has to offer concerning a particular subject. The menu is on your right when you open the app and is easy to understand . I feel that anyone with a kindlefire that visits youtube on a regular basis should have this app in their library.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|Much better than I expected but gives me nearly (but not quite) as much control and on my Kindle Fire HD as I get with my Wacom tablet on my desktop and Illustrator and/or Corel Paint. Although it doesn't offer as many tools it really works for a more-than-quick sketch in black and white or color. I then Fine tune in Adobe. Great tool, get the Pro version over the mobile, worth the extra!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have family in several States, from the Ohio River valley's tri-state to the Carolina's; from Texas to California and Oregon, and with this app I can keep tabs on what everyone is experiencing. When packing for visits, I know exactly what to pack. Great accuracy.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|great book from all angles.  I am the mom to a wonderful 10yr old with Asperger syndrome.  The school councelor read this book to the kids this year and I could not wait to read it myself.  Acceptance by others is always our biggest concern with our son.  Love that the characters in this book all had out of place feelings dispite their places in society.  Wonderfully written!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Love the show!!! After the first show, I was hooked on the show. Could not wait to watch the second one.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I have had this pair of headphones for over 2 years now with very minimal problems. Sometimes it will stop working, especially if our Roku is on in the other room. Recently the material covering the styrofoam ear pads wore off and the microphone somehow snapped in half so I am ordering another pair.
B00130EVSS|5.0|Eastern Promises has been a favorite movie of mine since I first saw it. I only chose to rent it because of Viggo Mortensen. His performance was excellent, as they always are. I found the story unique and while it's a violent film, it's refreshing from the same old same old recycled plots that come out of Hollywood these days. The special features are definitely worth watching. The background of the use of Russian prison tattoos as part of the plot was especially interesting. I'd recommend this film to anyone who enjoys a good mafia, thriller, or Viggo Mortensen flick. There is violence & nudity, so not for the squeamish.
B008VBYN80|4.0|pretty good game but the energy is really annoying and takes to long. The makers are just trying to sucker you in to waste money on the game.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|The Waltons meets Downton Abbey. Based on turn of the century reflections by the author, it gets schmaltzy at times but you quickly become attached to the characters and want to follow their ups and downs.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Loved everything about this book. Think this one was the best so far in the series.  If you liked The 50 shades series then you will love The Crossfire Series.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Fantastic book...very emotional.  The relationships between land owner and slaves grips at your heart strings.  Brings you back to that era and allows you to feel as they did.  Highly recommend this book!!
B0060MYKTY|1.0|Everything blu ray was made for is on full display here. Cinematography, acting, and costumes. It's a real shame their are absolutely no extended scenes, cut scenes, or actor or crew interviews. No cast or crew commentary on the episodes to add layer and get a fresh angle from the creators of this show. Extremely disappointing. I have showtime subscribtion, shoanytime. This really was a waste of money.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Unbelievable blue ray. I saw this movie at the AMC Theater and on a normal DVD player. Wonderful movie, but it does not compare to watching Avatar on Blue Ray. It is something special. I recommend to anyone with a blue ray layer to experience this great movie.
B006ZB3V2C|5.0|As stated above the application meets the standards that hold and goes above my expectations in it's variety of sounds. It's interface is both simplistic and intuitive, once the buttons icons are learned. A five star rating is earned thoroughly by the design team behind this handy app. Kudos, sirs/ma'ams.
1609611543|5.0|Lots of great info especially for those of us diagnosed with wheat issues.  Some of the info is helpful, some life changing!
B008YBXQ7Q|4.0|These are bright, good quality, and work well at 12V.  Take note that the wires are very thin, so you may need to solder them in place rather than use a barrel connector.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|The series is not something I'd normally choose, but I am so glad I did! The story is complex and unpredictable. Makes me wish I had read the books!
B000SGGUWS|5.0|It was a great book I read it because I watch the show to, and I wanted to see how close the book was to the show. So far there kind of the same but really different. Overall it was a great book!! :)
B00CO6QGCE|1.0|I don't understand what I'm supposed to be doing and can't find guidance !!!Not well up with these things but wanted to mix some music for circuit classes. Can anyone tell me how to get started
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I have tried several different cache cleaning apps and this one is the best out of them all.  Other ones I tried never seemed to clean out the caches on my LG Lucid phone so it always felt sluggish.  I am not sure how this one does it, but it frees up more memory and doesn't affect the running of the phone in any way.  While this is a free app, the features it offers makes it worth paying for.<br /><br />If you need extra memory on Android device, this is the one to get!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I just love the twilight series!!! The movies do this series no justice.  This is a great book, a very easy read and hard to put down!
B003GK212G|5.0|Another episode of the camel club.  The plot races on with breathtaking speed.  A truly spectacular book.  David Baldacci does it again. Going to read Divine Justice  next.
B00821OX98|5.0|Just what I want from sci fi nail biting entertainment, and excellent special effects, Hope they don't cancel the show before they finish it
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Good, interesting read. A bit confusing since every chapter begins with a different time frame and alternating characters. Some of the characters are more prominent than others and some have little to do with the overall plot (unless I missed something). Perhaps this book could be better understood if read twice, but like Stephen King once said there are too many books to read the same one twice. Overall this book is inspiring and provides some insight into Afghan family lineages and the many paths they may take. It will not be the last Hosseini book I read unless he refrains from writing another
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I would highly recommend this book, and could not put it down. I can't wait to read more books by Hugh Howey.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wastes the time away... its pretty fun game.... pretty easy at first, but trust me it gets a lot more challenging.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I have yet to get to the end of book #5, but I know that I will hate to leave these characters and this fantastic era with it's challenges.  All good things must come to an end, but Mr. Martin's writing makes me wish that were not true!
B007KB48WI|3.0|Mostly forgettable. Very bland. Competently enough orchestrated and performed, but it really didn't speak to me in any kind of emotional way.
B005FVNIW6|4.0|Had heard some decent things about this book so decided to give it a go. Despite some minor discrepancies, \\"Enders Game\\" is a great read.
193700788X|3.0|I am going to try my best to keep this as spoiler free as I can but if I slip up- I apologize in advance.  That being said, I am going to agree with many of my reader friends on this one: the ending left me... unhappy.  I loved that we got to revisit so many of the characters that we met over the course of the series.  Tara and Sookie rekindling their friendship was great.  But I felt like the entire book was rushed as if Ms. Harris said \\"I am so sick of writing this.  I want it tied up and over with as soon as possible\\".  I also was thrown for a loop with the way Sookie's love life panned out.  We knew she would not become a vampire (Ms. Harris has said so in about every interview ever) but I just spent 12 books thinking it was a choice between Eric and Bill,  Eric and Alcide, Eric and Quinn.  I felt like the rug had been pulled out from under me and Ms. Harris said \\"Ha! The answer is D- None of the Above!\\"  I felt unsettled over that part.  Sure, the guy she ends up with fits with the idea of her not turning but it felt forced.  This book, the entire book, felt like the last chapters of Mockingjay- like the author gave up and just wanted to be done.  I'm glad that I did not buy my copy yet- I will get it at the resale shop or online for cheap to finish my collection but I probably won't re-read this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like how you get to actually explore the rooms in order to search for clues &amp; hidden objects.  It is both fun &amp; challenging.  It's a really good game for exercising your mind.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|So much fun and  wonderful game!  Very immersing and delightfully entertaining.  I would recommend this game to any my litte pony friendship is magic fan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game. The 1st day I got it, I played it for hours. It's great for kids too, but adults can have fun playing too.<br />If you love the movie, you'll love this game. I would recommend it because it's such great fun.
B009EEQAT8|5.0|Get ready for lots of laughs and a unique movie experience. The Fantastic Mr. Fox has tons of voices from celebrities you know and love. Fully of witty adult humor, this is a fun-natured film that has more than earned the awards it has received. I can't get enough of it.
0062068415|5.0|I never read such detective stories, but I wanted to read this one. I remember that few years ago I saw movie on TV and I didn't understand it, it was hard to follow, and only now I bought a book. I was laying few months in my bookshelf, but suddenly I felt need to read it and when I started reading it- I couldn't stop. I read it all in three days, I was laying all days in bed and reading, reading, reading, because it was so interesting. Of course I did mistake that first I saw movie, so I already knew what gonna happen. But still it was very interesting book. It was impossible to go to sleep when so much interesting things were waiting for me in book.<br />But in the end of book, in last chapter, I got again confused like watching a movie.... I got lost because I cannot understand what was reality and what was imagined by main character. But it is good, because that what makes book interesting.
B005DD7H50|5.0|Excellent movie...really kept me on the edge of my seat to the very end.  Will appeal to all Sci-Fi and Bradley Cooper fans.
B000PY6BBI|5.0|I don't think many people  have seen this movie.  It's a wonderful fantasy movie and great to watch these seasoned actors in their youth.
006056251X|5.0|I'm a romance novel snob.  After years of reading different authors, I now only read the new fiction of three: Julia Quinn, Eloisa James, and Lisa Kleypas.  Lisa Kleypas is my favorite and \\"The Devil in Winter\\" is her best book.  Her Wallflower and Hathaway series is her overall best work (I'm not a fan of her modern romances).  Sebastian and Evie are a believable, romantic couple with problems grounded in reality.  There are so many \\"reformed rake\\" stories out there, but this one is by far my favorite.  Sebastian is sardonic, sexy, and sweet.  His road to reformation isn't an easy one, but Kleypas has written a wonderful character driven novel that makes the hero's journey authentic and completely swoon-worthy.  Do yourself a BIG favor and get this book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses and I get to know more about horses and other things it is I love to get gifts from my friends I go to other people's stables and feed and groom there horses.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Epic has excellent graphics. Gameloft did a fine job with the art and design. This is a fairly standard RTS game and an excellent indoctrination for younger players.<br /><br />The thing that ain't so epic is the use of Aura and how scarce it is. It is a revenue generator because they charge for additional Aura as a shortcut. That drives me positively bonkers. Imagine a kiddo and the frustration felt when the Aura is so slow to arrive. The cries of anguish would drive most any parent to shut her up with a credit card. Unfortunately, this is the business model of many game designers. Sheesh!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is friken awesome! Please get it there's even cheats on YouTube<br />So get the game lol<br />Lol lol
B00CWY76CC|3.0|Pretty fun. It kept the kids and I entertained for a bit. Double rooms were the most entertaining.<br />After we figured out what we were supposed to do we moved through them fairly quickly until coming to the end.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This game is very cool it's awesome for kids I would prefer this to kids and adults I really like this game
B008602KQI|5.0|I'd say the movie was darker than the book. But it was so well casted and produced. I loved it!
B000YJ85BI|5.0|Great science fiction is all about characters and relationships.  John Scalzi gets this in spades from the first book in this series, Old Man's War, through this book, the third in this series.<br /><br />Great characters are ones that are real, ones that you would want on your side in a bar fight, standing with you at your wedding or vanquished at your feet when the battle is done.  John Scalzi has brought all of those characters to the party and more.  So be warned, you might not be able to easily close the book once started.
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|Downloaded this game and was surprised to find out that it requires an extra 615 MB of memory!! Takes a long time for the extra  download!!
B00A8MGIZG|5.0|This movie holds as true as possible to the book.I personally do not understand or care about the negative reviews.I guess movies like this should be labeled clearly  &#34; NOT FOR THE WEAK OF MIND &#34;!!!
B002KKCVX2|5.0|These sandals turned out to be much more comfortable then expected. They're much better for walking than other sandals I've owned.
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I had heard about it but never watched it.  I have a whole new way to watch TV without all the commercials.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I really enjoyed this read!  Very interesting and enjoyable.  Unbelievable that she was able to do this without training and much experience.
B0056BBO1W|5.0|This album has some of the songs that are played constantly on the radio, and that helped with my decision to purchase it. I have yet to find any of his music(on the older albums) that i do not like.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|If you enjoy the world of fantasy and a &#34;good vs. evil&#34; story, then this series is a must.  I look forward to the next book in the sequel!  This series is a perfect escape in a world of tension and stress.  A movie could never do this book justice.  In fact, I wish I had NEVER seen the first movie!!
B000HF702E|5.0|I just think it's a good movie,some may not agree with me but that's why they do these, to get folks opinions.
B00BC24NT4|3.0|I am a John LaCarre fan. So I read all of his books. I admire that he tries to change with the times nd remain topical. Sometimes it is a hit and sometimes not. This book is not a hit but explores a theme important to Americans: the privatization of our military and national security, particularly topical in light of the Snowden affair and other scandals involving private contractors performing high level government security work. He takes his usual shots at Americans, although well deserved in this instance. Good for LaCarre fans. First time readers should start with his other, more well known works.
B00269FOHM|5.0|I was searching the internet for period dramas and had never heard of this movie until I happen to see it on youtube and started watching it.  I fell in love with the movie, as it has great actresses and actors, the set and costumes are outstanding.  I was delighted to find this movie on amazon for purchasing, since I could not find it in any retail store.<br /><br />The story brings to light some great moral issues and has some very emotional scenes.  Very enjoyable!
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|A fun take on this classic story. Was better than we expected. Was a sweet story with some good characters
B002R88G5E|5.0|After reading the Kite Runner -I read this book and [same author] and must say it touched me deeply as there is still so many atrocities against women in this 21st century -------that shock and cause so much heartache to people concerned -----------this author is very empathic towards the women in his country of birth and has just proved it again in The Mountains Echoed------------all 3 books are wonderful--------and shed light on a rather closed country as far as daily life is concerned------------highly recommended-------Soretha Smithers--Cape Town
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Season 3 was well worth the wait. As a huge fan of the show I found it to be as good as the previous seasons. Maggie Smith is a genius!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm usually not a fan of reading but i have read all 3 books twice!! Don't want to put it down.
B001NLKT60|5.0|My husband and I both have read the hard book and loaded in our ebooks as well to read again and again. We are sorry he Is now deceased and will write no more.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I wish she would write more. I hope there are more books to this series and truly hope they make a movie.
B005HEQ4XQ|4.0|I watch series which are clean and wholesome for the most part. Sometimes there are cuss words and moments where sex is implied, but for the most part this series is clean. I would recommend Star Trek season 6 and the rest of the series to anyone who likes this type of entertainment and likes good special effects.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I just love all of the books. I have read them several times. They are very hard to put down!!!
B008QTV3X0|5.0|I heard this was great. It is. Excellent acting and plot so far. I am hooked. I would suggest this to any adult. Contains sex, language and a little bit of violence so far.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I really like how the book moves from one person's viewpoint to the next. It keeps the ready very much intrigued. I would recommend reading it.
B00BESCJII|5.0|Excellent drama. It is set in a high school, but is of a universal caliber of film. The acting and story is superb - certainly not childish or geared for a young audience. Loved it.
B000FVE3A2|3.0|I bought this watch from JCPenney about five years ago. Overall, the watch seemed to be holding up with a few problems. The pins that hold the band links together began to loosen and eventually break. I actually caught the watch as it was falling off my wrist. I replaced the pins with new ones from the links that were removed from sizing the watch. However, in December of 2012, the watch band broke again and I couldn't catch it. The shock broke loose pieces of the face and the watch stopped working all together. This is all from daily wear.<br /><br />I called Customer Service, and found it very difficult to get through to them. I would wait on hold for 20 to 25 minutes to be told that all representatives are busy. No return call for the message that I left, only nothing for a couple weeks. After finally getting in touch with a human being at Invicta, I made arrangements to ship the watch.<br /><br />I sent the watch in late January of this year(2013), and it wasn't until four weeks later that I received an email stating the needed repairs and the price. I attempted to do this online, but their site is not very user friendly once you get past the smoke and mirrors. It required a customer service representative to complete, and the phone call situation remained the same. I was assured that it would take 90 days for the repairs as of the end of February. I did not hear from Invicta until I sent customer service representative an email to check on the status approximately 90 days later. I was told that my watch would be completed and returned in June. This would be 120 days rather than 90 days. I finally received the watch at the end of June.<br /><br />The watch looked good, and seemed to function appropriately. I went swimming with my children the other day, and upon diving into the water the watch bezel broke off. No, I wasn't rock diving from a cliff in Hawaii, or the high dive, it was the edge of the gymnasium pool. It is not worth the time and hassle to pay for the watch to be repaired, and I will have to figure something out.<br /><br />Will I ever buy an Invicta watch again? No. Nor can I recommend it to anyone who actually wants a quality watch. I have owned many cheaper priced watches in my life, Timex and Casio. They have all held up to greater hardship and functioned flawlessly. When I was in the military, I beat my GShock to death on a daily basis. It never quit until a good 12 years later the outer casing finally broke. The watch continued to work. I like a nice, classy watch, and I hope to have one someday. It isn't the Invicta Grand Diver.<br /><br />WBJ
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Great Cd, Justin continues to impress with how he keeps songs going and the lyrics he uses. Cant wait for the second part of the album.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|This movie is one of the best movies i have ever seen. You wont regret getting this movie!!! There isnt to much bad language and its not as gory as movies like Black Hawk Down. But without the gore and language it is better for younger viewers so its a great movie
B005OCFHHK|5.0|i bought this from a discount store in corpus christi and it got here well before the deadline but there were issues with the postal service that were not related to the company who sold it to me. they were worth the month long ordeal to get them. the company was courteous and helpful and sent them to me again with no extra charge. i apologize for not remembering the name of the store.
B00CGPPMKU|4.0|It's fun to see what happens from one stroke of your finger.It is very relaxing and enjoyable,It makes me look like an artist which i am not,just fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think minecraft is very fun.  It's all about using your brain. That is good for children because there brain will get stronger every time  they play it. Please get this game.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|Great game so far, you get a life every 8 minutes so nothing to buy unless you just want to.
B00785P2QC|3.0|This game is a little confusing at the beginning,but it get easier as you go along. I think i will learn to like it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Better than 99.9% of the garbage on US TV! The current shows are just trash. And WAY too many scam commercials.
B00AVTMB4I|5.0|This movie is awesome. Chbosky is a fantastic  teller who is able to suck you into Charlie's world with relatable laugh out loud moments aswell as the right amount of drama and nostalgia.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellently written.  Great science &#34;fiction&#34;, we hope.  A true page turner!  I wonder why it says that I need nine more words below?
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I haven't played chess for years so thought I would get the brain going again and start playing.  I put my opponent as my father as we used to play games together.  I beat him first game!
B003VPWX6K|5.0|Every sentence in this book  is a piece of art. Ishiguro loves writing about past and missed opportunities. His descriptions are so vivid that you feel like you can even smell the air in the early 1900s.
B00DBSZEH2|3.0|The witches were matrix ninjas who ran through the forest like werewolves. So that was interesting. Also it had elements of van helsing that couldn't be escaped. It has a plot that it followed and it was enjoyable but it was not amazing.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This game is amazing, the graphics are beautiful.  It keeps you challenged the whole time.  It definitely deserves five stars.  I did have some issues, it froze a few times for a few seconds, but I believe that could be a kindle issue though.  I hope sequels to this game come out soon!
B000YMM3CC|5.0|it was good, shows respect for the vows of marriage, i watched with 14 year old girls, a little too much sex signs for them.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved how Christian, the ultimate control freak, had absolutely no control when he met Ana.<br />Love, you cannot run from it!!!
B002QNBRXS|5.0|When you think about it, how do you make the character of a serial killer likable?  Well, you really can't.  But somehow the writers of this show managed to let us know how much pain/anger Dexter feels with his &#34;Dark Passenger&#34; and how hard it is for Dexter to try to fit in with normal people. He thinks buying donuts should solve his problem. He suffers, that's why we allow ourselves to watch him every week.  I'm sorry that this will be the last season.  I am recording all episodes and plan to have a farewell to Dexter watching fest. I sincerely hope they don't kill off Dexter.  Please, at least give us the hope of a movie.
0786955570|5.0|Great game for several reasons<br />1. Fully cooperative game with a 20 sided dice, cards, modular and random game board, and a host of miniatures that represent both heroes AND monsters/bosses.<br />2. Can combine with the Wrath of Ashardalon game or Dungeon Command games' miniatures<br />3. RPG-lite. No huge time investment or setup needed like the real D&D RPGs, though it could be considered a negative if you were looking for a deep character development system and role playing experience, but if you were you shouldn't look at board games in the first place.

0786958731|5.0|This game improves upon its predecessors (Ravenloft and Ashardalon games) by adding the stance mechanic, competitive cooperative team or player vs player scenarios. It does remove the campaign mode but there is plenty of official and unofficial content online as well as the ability to create your own adventure.<br /><br />Those familiar with the Drizzt books will recognize some of the scenario stories in the game but it is not necessary to know the story to enjoy this game. Definitely recommend if you enjoyed the previous games or just want to try the D&D board games for the first time. There is a mix of luck (random card draws, tile draws, and dice rolls) but there is also a bit of tactical and teamwork play to help balance it out as well.

B008IJTFYW|5.0|I like the variety of sounds for the free version. I really like the optional timer, and the option for the app to close itself when the timer runs down. being able to customize the volume for each sound is really nice too. I used several different rain and thunder sounds when everyone was setting off fireworks for the 4th. I didn't even notice the extra booms, and slept well enough to wake up at 0300 for work on the 5th. Very nice! I have not tried the meditational sounds, but if they are as nice as the white noise, then I'm sure I'll like it, too.

B00CF34B2I|5.0|As someone coming back to MTG I really enjoy this. The campaign mode pits you against all types of situations. Really enjoyed the story as well, really great thing for anyone coming back to the game or just starting out.
B00AVPYT8I|5.0|I downloaded this app on my new phone.  I have not had the chance to review any of the books or service yet.
B0027P2ZWC|4.0|The clapping was a bit distracting, but I'd still give it 5 stars if it weren't that some of the tracks ended so abruptly, mid-note.
0345803485|3.0|I enjoyed this first book.  I was not overly thrilled with the second or third books as the story seemed weak and fake.. like it was just written to complete the set..
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow! This book will make you smile, laugh, cry, and feel real hurt right along with these characters. It is an amazing read. Sky and Holder are so strong and they complement each other so well. Colleen has left me truly speechless after reading this. I want to rant and rave about how great this book is but I don't think I would do it justice. My emotions are a tangled mess. Buy this book, I promise you won't regret it!
B004HD61KE|4.0|I love mysteries and historical fiction.  I wasn't too sure I would like this book but the sample hooked me.  I finished it in two days.  I bought several other books by James Rollins because I liked The Devil Colony.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|What a truly amazing and emotional (true) story!!  VERY WELL DONE!  Grab a box of tissues, hold each other close and watch this amazing story of survival.<br /><br />It's a wrenching ride, but as you watch, remember this is a story of a family who made it through - they survived - and it will help you.  This is part of our world history.  Hopefully something like this will never happen to you or your loved ones, but if it does, having seen this might give them strength to not give up, to survive.  And if it should happen again and you're blessed to not be part of it, it will probably inspire you to help, to give whatever aid you can to those effected - ergo it can make you an even better person.<br /><br />PARENTS:  your children WILL see bare breasts and wounds and dead bodies - so keep that in mind as you determine if your children are old enough to watch this with you.  (Probably not as gory as some of the cartoons or scary movies/games they've seen - but perhaps more \\"real\\" and harder to gloss over).
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Love this show my partner and I needed something to watch and watched the pilot episode and can't stop watching.
B00AWJYJVA|1.0|This is not one of Le Carr&eacute;'s better efforts. The plot goes in one direction, and then another, and when everything finally comes together, the author ends the novel abruptly in a deeply unsatisfying way. It's as if he decided to throw in the towel and not finished the novel.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It is no wonder that this novel won all the awards in 2012.  Sensitive, revealing, an in depth exploration of a world we Westerners hardly know.  Thank you for taking me there.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a totally serious workout DVD. Be prepared to have your butt kicked in just a few minutes and on Level 1. I am trying to do this DVD on days where the gym is closed and it is amazing. I just did it yesterday and woke up sore everywhere-- even my abs! It is intense, and nonstop. The only thing is she talks A LOT. Some times it's awesome and motivational and some times I just wanted her to HUSH and let me work. My boyfriend did the dvd with me yesterday and at one point yelled, \\"OH MY GOD SHUT UP!\\" which made me die laughing but yeah she does go on a bit. We probably could have muted it but I'm not familiar enough with the routine to not need the verbal cues.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|What a fantastic tool!! No matter which device I am on, I can update my notes. The browser and email plugins are sure to be useful, but I, admittedly, have not learned all of the functionality of this application.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love the way Brooks chose to tell his story, the distinct microcosms and characters from all over the world that he introduces the reader to. One of the best zombie books I have ever read. Keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting more. No typical plot lines here. Very good read.

0767817710|5.0|Brilliant interpretation of Louie L'more's book. Sharon Stone was \\"dead on\\" the in main role. Silent intensity and deep emotion displayed.<br /><br />Fabulous performances by Hackman,Dicaprio, and Henrickson. Why say more and ruin the experience? Just watch it.
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|It was an enjoyable movie. A little too CGI for our taste but a few laugh out loud moments and Morton Downey Jr is always a favorite.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Great free game. Very challenging and addictive. It makes you want to keep playing, and play again as soon as you see the app.
B009NY43NY|2.0|This book was a great disappointment to me (and apparently to a whole lot of other folks).  The writing felt rushed and the characters were generally out of character.  I have no problems with the end of the story (Sookie ends up with Sam) but wow, it had no build up at all.  And it just felt awkward as every single character of note is run back through the story for a curtain call.  I'm glad I read it, but sorry it wasn't very good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. I have it on my phone and I play it all the time. I was the first one to get this game out of everyone I know and now everyone is getting it I must have started a new thing.I never get bored.this is an amazayn game!!!!!!
B004N6369Y|3.0|The characters didn't have any depth and the story progressed way too slow.  This is a book to borrow - not buy.
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|What can I say. I have always been a Hannibal fan. It is not what I thought it would be.
0307950689|5.0|Always love Dan Brown's books.  He always provides a good adventure to escape into and take me out of my world.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|We have really enjoyed watching the Good Wife.  Some of these we did see on TV when it originally aired but there were a few we had missed.  Series is interesting.  The characters are quirky!  Enjoy the judges.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I simply couldn't put this down. Once again, Hosseini has enchanted me with his incredible storytelling abilities, pulling together seemingly separate lives, across geography and generation, to create a single fairy tale that truly aches and resonates familial love. Breathtaking!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Morton is the master of weaving a tale that spans a century. I couldn't put this book down. Loved it!
B004LZFWJO|4.0|Fun and fast. Love the sound and ease of moving through the characters. You will love it,too.Similar to Candy Swipe. Main difference is not being able to swipe through the word CANDY.
B008UCJ7KO|2.0|This book is so so so boring, I don't understang why, the subject is SO exhausted already. Really hate it! Don't going to buy the next one, I'm done with Crossfire series.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|A great drama that is wonderfully acted showing the contrast between the nobility and servants.  This is one show I hope will last for years.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Love this app for my kindle.  It's easy to understand and I love that you cam move anywhere with the live radar. It does not limit you to a section. Highly recommended!!!
B000OLROWC|5.0|Not much to worry about when it comes to the kids. A little language, drugs, violence, but nothing to get in a twist over.
0345803485|5.0|Yes, this book has a lot of sex, but it also has a love story that I really enjoyed. I have read all three books in the course of a week. I could not wait to see what happened next. Christian Grey seems perfect at first, but as I read more about his messed up past, I realized how lonely and vulnerable he really is. His connection with the main character (Anastasia) was amazing. The way they need each other on such a deep level (although they have trouble seeing eye to eye on so many different aspects of their relationship). Give it a chance, I hope you enjoy it as much as I have!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I've tried many thermal compounds. None seem to be as reliable and good quality over time. I've tried ones many times more expensive and some even cheaper. Arctic just seems to know what they're doing.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|What's not to like about Downton Abbey?  The characters are at the same time lovable and infuriating, but it outlined the kind of attitude prevailing in those times.  As for the production, it was well executed.  The costumes were superb and the acting outstanding.  But not as excellent as the previous two seasons.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|This movie made me cry more times than I'd like to admit. It won the Oscar for best documentary - need I say more?
B009EHDU7U|4.0|Preposterous, imaginative, unbelievable and very funny. Had me in stitches the way the story raced along and the many turns it took.
B00AR83PN4|4.0|I might not have bought this game on my own, but I'm glad it was a FAOTD so I could check it out and see that its negative reviews are mostly unfounded. It IS fine as a free app. (As you can tell, this review does not objectively review Cubimania on its own so much as counter all the other reviews that I feel it has unfairly received.)<br /><br />Now, I'm a hardcore gamer, so maybe I can manage the controls better than some others, but I really see almost nothing wrong with this game, other than the too-similar color arrangement. To anyone who has difficulty placing blocks: just make sure that you tap the TOP surface of the topmost cube, and the game will (in my experience) ensure that that square of the playing field is selected.<br /><br />I actually regard the fact that blocks can block your own view for future block placement as a totally legitimate gameplay challenge. I think the arrow keys for camera movement are perfectly fine, and that if a player places blocks in such a way that they obscure his/her vision of other blocks, that's the PLAYER's fault for poor placement--so the visual ability must be kept in mind when placing, not just relentless searching for 3-in-a-row matches.<br /><br />Speaking of which, 3-in-a-row matches are fine. One reviewer said that they don't always work, but I have yet to see a bug in my own playing. Every time I have dropped a block to complete 3 (or even 4) in a row, whether it was vertical or horizontal or even in an L shape (of 5 blocks, with the corner block being the last one placed), they always registered and disappeared successfully, and so did ensuing chains afterward.<br /><br />There are four things this game probably needs to satisfy everyone else:<br /><br />1. It should probably have four cardinal arrow keys for super-accurate placement of blocks, so that users can just press the arrow keys to direct an incoming pair of blocks to a certain square of the grid, instead of having to touch that square. This can come inhandy when pits/chasms are formed in the grid (though, as I stated above, perhaps this is merely the player's fault from poor block-positioning).<br /><br />2. Cubimania would do well to have more contrasting colors (at least a slightly darker background behind the brighter playing cubes), and especially flashing/changing colors for the four block-placement indicator lines would be helpful.<br /><br />3. I personally think it might be nice to have advance notice of the colors of the next block, like in Tetris (possibly).<br /><br />4. Perhaps a spherical ball icon, to be held with one finger for completely freestyle Cubistry-like rotation of the camera, could be used to replace the current arrow keys. Perhaps, but the game has an intentionally old-school feel to it, and I think the arrow keys are fine.<br /><br />And the music is awesome. What's wrong with epic disco music? I was bobbing my head to it while positioning blocks for matches; maybe I was born decades too late. Played this on both a hacked Nook Color running CyanogenMod 10.1 (Jellybean) and an HTC phone running Ice Cream Sandwich; it's fine on both. Cubimania is here to stay in my games library!
B001K3K5MO|2.0|My girlfriend and I watched this together on a whim.  We were disappointed, really.  What we remember as a fun action movie just comes across today as a date movie for frat boys.  The acting isn't all that great, and the writing is at times atrocious and at other times very bland and uninspired.  Sorry, but this movie just isn't that great.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love everything about this game. It is a great time passer. I got  rid of my angry birds app for this game and I have regrets. The graphics are awesome. You don't have to feel pressured into buying coins to unlock new scenes or vehicle upgrades you just drive drive drive! I honestly haven't seen an ad as they are at the bottom and out of the way! Thanks!!!!
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Just using the browser is better. Program changes page layout and makes it harder to navigate than FB already is.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Great book.  Simply written.  Difficult to put down.  Will make you cry, shout, laugh and smile.  I highly recommend it.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|The author left us in the air with the end, I hope that she comes with the continuation really SOON...... There are many questions unanswered....
B001TH16DI|5.0|Reminiscing the days of Captain Kirk and Spock adventures do bring sweet memories especially now its on high-def format. Overall quality of this box set is good with great picture and audio especially for a well dated film.<br /><br />You can't go wrong by getting this set if you are a Trekkie fan. Recommended.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|I can't stop playing it but every time I get on, I lose all my hard owned peanuts. Like before I had 25, but now I only have 3.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great action, solid and fluid plot.  Best Bruce Banner/Hulk combination since Bill Bixby/Lou Ferrigno (Sorry Eric and Ed). Can't wait for the sequel.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Good book... A lot of information to take in... Highly recommended for anyone that would like to sharpen their people skills....
B008RV5K5E|5.0|This is a great ANIMATED FILM. A point which a lot of illiterate people seemed to miss out on. As a result of their own ignorance they gave it a 1 star review claiming to be duped into buying a live action film.<br /><br />Ignore anything less than a 5 star review for this. The story is great, the animation is fantastic and the voice acting is top notch.<br /><br />I am a huge Batman fan and critique all Batman works with a fine tooth comb. To assure you that I do not give all things Batman the undivided thumbs up, the latest trilogy staring Christian Bale would only receive an at most 4 star rating, on a good day. Reasons being, Bale as an actor did not deliver as Batman or Bruce Wayne, and the story of final part of the trilogy was just a complete retelling of the story from the first film. In other words UNORIGINAL.<br /><br />This film however, blew the Dark Knight Rises away easily with its telling of the return of Gotham's greatest hero. Any fan, even anyone remotely interested in the story of Batman, will find this story interesting.<br /><br />Signed, The Damn Batman (Batman's cousin).
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Well done. The alarm is reliable. The bedside 'nightmode' is an asset. It can remain lit while charger is plugged.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Trash film, absolute garbage. The whole thing is one giant pointless contradiction. Don't bother buying it unless you want to waste money just for a mindless dumb experience for 2 hours. Spend that time doing something else like watching paint dry.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Amazing books amazing show I so hated when Sean Bean was called just love him but that's the book for you..
B008B1BL4E|5.0|I found this book very easy to read and follow.  Mr. Clark worked a web of happenings over a number of years and many countries to its horrible end.  I love that he did not just name people and then let you on your own.  He continued throughout the book to remind the reader who he was talking about.  This made it so much easier to follow.  I have always been interested in World War I because I think it is why we are still having issues 100 years later. This book brings to life those issues back in the early 1900's and reminds us of how we got to where we are today.  Anyone interested in history should read this.  It stops when the war starts so don't expect war stories.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|I love this movie I saw it in the theatre and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD  I was surprised to see it on the free streaming videos .
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This is a very well crafted exploration of good and evil, and the territory in between, which is much larger than either extreme.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|I got this on for my granddaughters when they come over they love hair make up and nail apps and this one is different. They get to wash cut,curl,crimp, and straighten the hair .
B00CGPPMKU|5.0|Relaxing. Create beautiful designs just by moving your finger around. Lots of design options to choose from. Love this app.
B00CLH1PHM|5.0|This was a great thought provoking book. It's a really short story to read in one sitting. When I finished reading it, the song \\"Isn't It Ironic\\" popped into my head. It will make you think of all the things that might have been changed by one simple little incident that you didn't even realize.<br /><br />We really got to know the main character, Terry, and I liked him. At the same time I felt sad for him. His life was one of those \\"if only\\" but we never know. If only I would have...  You will also wonder why some people seem to be lucky at all the time while others have no luck at all.<br /><br />The twist at the end was excellent. I look forward to reading more from this author. I highly recommend reading this story that will leaves you with thinking how ironic life can be.
B009SQRC9E|5.0|It's a good movie for your animation collection. I love christmas stories especially about family and their sense of cohesiveness in times of strife.
B002M87V0A|5.0|An old time classic!  There is nothing like a musical to bring a smile to your face.<br />A family favorite in our house!
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|Story is okay. I don't feel the romance between Jack and the princess. Some actors seem to be miscast, I think.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|A great read for anyone interested in crime solving. I like the short stories, they make it easy to read one or two before bed.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|Hilarious! Maggie Smith is a very convincing actress. It's fun to watch the old folks deal with their lives at the retirement home.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I love the Wheel of Time series.  Brandon Sanderson makes the cross from each book in the series seamless. Easy to become attached to the characters.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|This was a real treat having the original members (excluding Bill Ward) back together. Toni Iommi is as usual his rifftastic self with very tight playing. Ozzy was a real surprise in how well his voice has held up considering all the physical abuse. Geezer Butler kept his bass lines tight and was as good as ever. Brad Welk did fine on drums and fit right in. To me, this album is as dark and heavy as any of their earlier material. Black Sabbath are truly the fathers of heavy metal and I will highly recommend this album to any fans of their older material or anyone who is into metal.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Like adventure, action, sci-fi, good guys winning over the bad guy? This is the movie for you, especially in 3-D.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is so much fun! I could play it for hours. I give it two thumbs up! Five stars.
B00BEZTMWW|2.0|Boring is the best way I can think to describe this movie. I expected much more and was disappointed. I would not recommend this to my friends to purchase. They can borrow mine.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love games that stretch the brain muscles, so to speak. This game will test memory, logic, and even common sense.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great movie first time around in 2-D and exceptional in 3-D. There is nothing about this movie that I did not like.
0143122061|5.0|Here in Brazil, I read this excellent book.<br />This book is about the things that made Western world dominance to all the world.<br />Western education, science, medicine, etc. are the world's standards.<br />In this book, its author, Niall Ferguson has two main things to show. One his view of world history, which he sees as having been dominated by \\"western\\" civilization for 500 years. The second is to correct deficiencies in the way he claims that history is currently taught in Americans, British, etc. schools.<br />In our times tells this book, the West is on the defensive, challenged economically by the very fast ascent of China and militarily by a wave of Islamist hatred.<br />Some great things showed clearly in this book:<br />1- The scientific revolution was, by any scientific measure, wholly Eurocentric. An Iranian can cry \\"Death to America\\", but if he gets sick, he will use American medicine to treat his health.<br />2- Western institutions such as private property rights, the rule of law and truly representative government are \\"conditio sine qua non\\" for prosperity and developement of any nation.<br />3- Ferguson uses this book to speak in defense of western imperialism. This imperialism gave better life for hundreds of millions of Africans, Asiatics,etc.<br />4- The real menace to the Western dominance today isn't Islam or China, but by our own pusillanimity - and by the historical ignorance that feeds it.
B00A85EMVK|4.0|Top Gun is Top Gun, what can anyone say? It was a great movie in 2-D and 3-D brings it to a whole new level. I did not realize the language was bad is a couple of places which is a disappointment in any movie.
B00821OX98|5.0|great show well written always keeping you guessing. cant wait to see what happens next. excited that season four has been anounced!
B005LAIHPE|5.0|Loved the movie. Has everything from action, to suspense, to romance, and a good dose of sci-fi. Good flick would recommend it to everyone.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Julio I am SUPER addicted to subway sitters please add costumes for the inspector guy itself would  be awesome  please if you guys think this is a cool new idea find it difficult useful to for the next update (maybe)
B005LAII80|1.0|Nothing like the original. Very loose plot coupled with foul language that was in no way necessary to enhance the film makes this a do not watch film.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Hunger Games video was on sale also!<br />Interesting movie  - and follows the book very closely-lots of movies do not.
B009O07NDY|4.0|Probably some of the best composed music I have heard, but being apart of Peter Jackson's films makes it alot more enjoyable.<br />So about the product:<br />Everything that was said is included<br />Sound quality is good<br /><br />Only downfall is that the booklet inside is a little doggy, my first had it's booklet pretty much torn out. So I needed to send my first one back to get another one, which was better than the last but still had a small tear on the spine.<br /><br />Overall I love this product, and I'll listen to it for years to come.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I have tried multiple times to download this app on my kindle fire and it keeps on telling me that I don't have enough space on my device to install it. So after deleting all my apps I tried again to see of it would work then but it still didn't. Don't download this app on kindle fire. It's a waste of space.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is wonderful. The beginning is slow and almost boring. I never wanted to read and then they announce what the next games are and then it gets really good. Most of the book leaves hanging. I couldn't put my kindle down!!! This is a great book and if you have read the hunger games then you should read this book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is awesome!! It made you always want to read more and kept you on the edge of your seat!! There is no doubt that I'm buying the next one!! I would recommend you read this book before the movie comes out because it will help you understand the movie better.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|I mean it, just stop what you are doing and order this.  If you don't swoon over his &#34;Rainy Night in Georgia&#34; I will be disappointed. Oh, and that last tune, &#34;Sunny Gone&#34;--I had never heard it before, but it is beautiful and sorta made me cry.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Once again this James Bond movie with Daniel Craig in the starring role is fantastic!!!<br />Your eyes never leave the screen because you do not wish to mish a scene.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|cant pop the battery out of the back of my kindle, so since I set snooze and dismiss to hard math problems, it's either figure the answer or listen to the alarm. I simply love this alarm app!!!
B00BBA6FOI|5.0|As a working mom myself, the book feels genuine to me. It does not pretend that woman could or should do it all by herself.
B00CPTUN5G|2.0|I am a huge MLP fan, but this movie was just. Hilarious, in a bad way. I have to say the AU in a high school setting sounds like a middle schooler written fanfiction. ALSO, running for a dance? She could have just stolen the crown from the principals office and went back to equestria. It wouldn't have been that hard, also Sunset shimmer could have done the same thing. Poor writing to explain to the other ponies why twilight was there, pinkie just blurts it out in a paragraph breath.<br />The ending was just bad, it turned into sailor moon. Like I said, bad fanfiction writing. That's why I enjoyed this, because it was so bad. It was funny.<br />The art was very cute, I enjoyed that. Fluttershy was adorable, and I will be getting her figurine when it is available.<br />I like the opening theme, the remix was really cool. There was one song that I liked.<br />Also just sayin', \\"this is our night\\" did they even try with that song?
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Jack Reacher is that kind of character that does and lives in ways that feed reader's fantasies. Ever wished you could be physically intimidating and as smart as Sherlock Holmes? Then this is the series for you. Lee Child has created a modern-day gunslinger loner who has a code of honor that allows good to triumph over evil. I thoroughly enjoyed, \\"Killing Floor,\\" and I really loved getting to know Jack Reacher. Cannot wait to read more about this character.
B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My two year old granddaughter loves this one!! Keeps her attention and she goes back to it numerous times in one session of playing on my kindle!!  Love, Love Love this one!!
1400069289|4.0|The book accomplishes its objective of demonstrating the pervasive influence of habits in our everyday lives.  Numerous, perhaps excessive, anecdotes are recited ad nauseam with unnecessary detail.  Although these stories are entertaining, they comprise the bulk of Mr. Duhigg's work, which leaves the practical applications of all habit related discoveries thinly covered.  It is not until the appendix that the understanding of how habits work is put to use.  But even then, the advice is inadequate in changing, particularly, addictive habits such as overeating, smoking etc.  Much like the first step for an alcoholic is to admit alcoholism, subsequent steps involve outside help to overcome this powerful and self-destructive habit.  Yet, Mr. Duhigg does not cite one organization, coach or professional who uses the principles of cue, routine and reward - habit forming stages - to break a negative cycle.  A few entities that appear to use these principles to break bad habits or instill positive ones seem to do it by chance rather than awareness of the full cycle, and none are open to the public.  They are companies such as Starbucks who train their employees to manage difficult customers.<br /><br />Despite these shortcomings, Mr. Duhigg does a masterful job of dissecting how habits overcome rational thought, and for that he deserves kudos.
B005HEK3JW|5.0|Capt Jon Luc Picard is very cool. He carries the Star Trek franchise to a new and epic level. The entire crew are all believable and each character is well defined.
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a great series.  Everything about it.<br />I think this series easily goes on the list of Great series in Sci Fi.
B005HEQ4XQ|5.0|Capt Jon Luc Picard is very cool. He carries the Star Trek franchise to a new and epic level. The entire crew are all believable and each character is well defined.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Never read the book, but really enjoyed the movie. In the vein of Star Wars and other sci-fi fairy tales, it is well written, directed and acted. I will definitely see the sequel.
0004704754|2.0|The print size is so tiny to fit all this text into one book of this size.<br />I would have preferred a larger sized book or more pages in the hardcover I purchased in order to have normal size or comfortable reading size letter's.<br />This would be a perfect book to get for a Kindle or E-Reader device where one can enlarge the print size. The print size on the Hardcover is too uncomfortably small for me to enjoy this edition.
B004SCRDCY|5.0|Arrived quickly and in excellent brand new shape.<br />The book is slightly different than the movie and provides more detail and insight I appreciate in character development.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|The charachters you know and love and know and love to hate are all there.  Somehow DB seems to pull me into every show.
B00683JK9K|3.0|The puzzles are fun, but there are not many of them. They need to be more challenging, or have more of them.
6305265666|5.0|This is just as good as I remember from watching it in the theater. Also, all the features that come on the disc are nice as well. It is worth getting to have in your DVD collection.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|Quite a challenging game. It was a bit difficult figuring out how to get back to the puzzle I was working on after I had stopped the game, but it is well worth it.
B00003Q43A|5.0|This is an action pack and well down movie. All the actors were well cast, as well as being well produced. The DVD is well done with everything that I enjoy having on a DVD. It is well worth getting.
B00D6OV57O|5.0|The whole sound track is filled with just awesome songs that take you back into the movie.  totally worth getting the extra tracks
B009AMANBA|5.0|Out of everything Spielberg has given us--along with Daniel Day-Lewis, Sally Fields, and Tommy Lee Jones--this is Spielberg's Masterpiece! If your DVD Library includes DVDs concerning American History, it is incomplete without Lincoln!
B002NNA9N0|3.0|This was clearly a movie designed for the stage.  If it wasn't for the great cast, it would have been a movie I'd say to skip.  Can't miss Alec Baldwin's unforgettable and very quotable scene!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the show. Thanks to Amazon for streaming it. Was able to watch it for free as Amazon Prime member. Great deal!
B0083Z6AH6|4.0|I must confess -Persuasion was my first Jane Asten read, and I quite loved it. Although the style of writing took  a chapter or two to grow accustomed to it became difficult to put down and a very fast read. From the beginning you will understand why the novel is aptly named Persuasion and feel the rigidity of English society's almost caste-like social classes. Whether you're rooting for the lovers to reconnect or wishing the elder sister and vapid father get their just dessert- you will be pleased with how Ms. Austen weaves her tale.
0307887448|4.0|Awesome read after a strong start, and very difficult to put down. Glad that it's available on Kindle now.<br /><br />Needs more 80s pop culture references.
B004GYY714|5.0|This allows for many uses in the class.  Easy to download and use.  Good, &#34;carry-with-you&#34; entertainment.  Pleasantly surprised to find
B000006NPY|5.0|great cd to add to your collection if you are old like me and hate all this new mp3 junk that has ruined the face of music as we know it.  lol.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It was very fun and challenging at times. It definitely warmed up the brain and kept me wanting more. I hope for more rooms in the near future. Highly recommended.
B007P6VLRS|5.0|sure we all miss the old pumpkins with d'arcy, james, and jimmy but this cd still is a great cd to add to your collection.  i guess billy is gonna just go solo now and hire a different band for each cd that comes out?  lol
B005MLOOJA|5.0|It is a great series. It is an excellent summer pastime. Looking forward to seeing all of the episodes in season 3 and 4.
B00B06IJRO|5.0|Nut-job Lego-loving parent here. Ignore my star rating. I don't get free Lego for these reviews...<br /><br />This set arrived on the market mid-2013. MSRP is 69.99. It is often wise to cross check with Lego on price and availability.<br /><br />Though this is an expensive set, I think it has very good designs and pretty good playability. If you are more interested in playability, I recommend the tree house that came out at the same time (see below). I think 31012 is one of Lego's best sets for 2013.<br /><br />There are three designs (and directions) included with the set (you build one at a time). The first is a modernist house, the second a more traditional house, and the third a small factory with sawtooth roof. The set has two mini-figures (man and woman), walkie talkie, turkey-leg, and the light brick.<br /><br />The main design is a modernist house that hinges apart and has lift-off tops. This lets kids get into the inside with their mini-figures. There is a bedroom inside with a bed and light, a balcony deck with a BBQ, and a living room with a comfy chair, desk, and fireplace. The light brick lights up when you press down on a brick on the roof. There is an opening garage with a yellow car, a brick built tree, a small pond, a brick-built remote control car, a brick-built bird, and a stairway. The design has wonderful mottling in the roof (using rust and brown sloped bricks) and the chimney (with light and dark gray). The second house is a Mediterranean design and lacks the garage. It is also hinged and has a lift-off top. There is a small swimming pool, brick built tree, lounge chair, and brick-built lawn mower. The last design is one of my favorites, partly because Lego has not made factories lately. This is a small workshop with a garage door, delivery van, security camera and fantastic sawtooth roof.<br /><br />I really think this is one of Lego's best sets of Creator structures (not including the large modular models) that they have offered in years. Infact, I think it ranks with #4954 from 2007, still regarded as a classic and highly sought after. This new set is the same price and includes mini-figures and interior furnishings (4954 was just a shell with no lifeforms). On the downside, there are substantially fewer pieces in the new set (756 vs. 1174). Set #31012's designs are all very good and they mix well with many of the other Lego themes (City, Friends, etc.). Kids play readily with houses (regardless of gender) because they are natural settings for many story lines.<br /><br />This is Lego's third Creator structure for 2013. The first was #31009 which is much less expensive, but probably not as much fun. The second structure was #31010 which I highly recommend, both for its price point and for its playability. I also recommend #5766 which came out in 2011, is a favorite with kids, and is still available as I write this. There is also the Creator Palace Cinema #10232, but at 149.99, it is in a different league.<br /><br />Creator sets are made primarily out of general-use bricks and come with instructions for multiple builds. This is closer to how Lego was when I was a child, and it encourages kids to rebuild the structures either as the other designs or their own. The Creator sets, however, use more ingenious building techniques than what Lego offered decades ago. These are really marvels of miniature design. Set 31012 has many good bricks including red and brown sloped pieces, lots of windows and three doors, some good size building plates, and plenty of white bricks.<br /><br />Finally, at the risk of sounding like a shill for Lego, the Creator section of the Lego website has a nice collection of short videos that feature their own designers explaining advanced building techniques. These videos mesh nicely with this set.<br /><br />Cheers
B009FZFONO|5.0|We started watching this when they were finished with Season 3... didn't realize we could watch so many episodes at once... Season 1-3!!!
B00B06JTC8|5.0|Nut-job Lego-loving parent here. Ignore my star rating. I don't get free Lego for these reviews...<br /><br />This set arrived on the market mid-2013. MSRP is 29.99. It is often wise to cross check with Lego on price and availability.<br /><br />This is a great set, partly because tree houses have natural playability for kids, partly because it is from the Creator line (see below). I think this is the best Creator set for 2013.<br /><br />Lego released a Friends theme tree house #3065 in 2012 that was a great set and, I believe, one that sold well. It was also a great price at 19.99. This set, 31010, costs a little bit more, adds a larger structure and has a more gender neutral color scheme. As a Creator set, 31010 has directions for three models (you build one at a time): the tree house, a waterside building with a small dock, and a two story barn-like structure. The set includes one mini-figure (a boy) with a walkie talkie, a frog, treasure map, and pizza. The tree house features a folding ladder (very nifty design), a tipper with \\"water\\" in it, winch with hook and trash-can, telescope, clubhouse with attic and lift-off top, bed, a hidden compartment (in the tree) for the treasure map, a brick-built wagon, and a brick-built dog. The waterside structure has a small oven with a lift-off top. The little barn features the winch.<br /><br />I think most kids will stick with the tree house design as it has the most going on. Play-wise, this set works well with a wide range of Lego's other themes. It is mini-figure size, unlike some of the other Creator sets. The set makes a great gift because if the child does not like it, they have the ability to make a wide range of other structures. At the very least, it is a good collection of very useful bricks.<br /><br />This is Lego's second Creator structure for 2013. The first was #31009 which is less expensive, but probably not as much fun. The third structure is #31012 which I also like very much but it is substantially moreexpensive at 69.99 MSRP.

B004SIP98S|3.0|First, Helen Mirren gives a predictably fine performance.  The script was written with a completely uneducated viewer in mind, a viewer with absolutely no sense of modern history nor of the nature of the English monarchy.  I found the constant Cliiff notes inserted into every actor's mouth at every available opportunity to be both insulting and distracting.  The writers were absolutely incapable of moving the story line without inserting some &#34;Wait!  Our audience won't know that the Queen's uncle abdicated!  Which character can say that?  Wait!  The audience won't know the Queen was a mechanic during WWII so let's have her truck break down right in the middle of Diana's funeral so we can give them that bit -- then they'll now we really did our homework!&#34;<br /><br />The rest of the cast was lackluster; in their defense, they doubled as a Greek chorus, inserting the writers' Cliff notes.  Casting seemed to depend on how the writers felt about a given character rather than on an actor's ability to bring that character to life.  Clearly, the writers hate Charles and Prince Philip and had them portrayed as spineless, repulsive sponges rather than displaying any attempt at insight into their characters or behavior.  Tony and Cherie Blair were out and out cartoon characters: dancing little flat figures flitting across the screen with absolutely no idea why they were there.<br /><br />I'd never advise anyone to skip a Mirren performance but do be aware that you're letting yourself in for a great deal of peripheral annoyance from script writers and secondary cast if you watch this.  And, if you watch it once, you'll never watch it again, so borrow it or rent it.  Spend your money on Elizabeth I!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Wish there were a few more levels to play. I like the combining of finds too.<br />Waiting for the additional levels!
B0012QE4Q2|1.0|Despite its being based on a fairly accurate historical novel, this film manages to pervert every relevant historical fact with an eye towards moving things along as fast as possible.  The list of outright distortions is endless so I'll stick to my favorite: Anne is &#34;banished&#34; to the French court as a bungling, unsophisticated young woman and returns a mere two months later (a) speaking fluent French, (b) possessing Machiavellian political skills, and (c) capable of enchanting and maneuvering every man at court, including Henry.  Really?  Really?  The script is as banal as it is historically flawed and the poor actors, well, I'm going to leave to poor actors alone because, with a script like this, they never actually had a chance to act.<br /><br />Save your money!

B0090KZDSK|2.0|I was waiting in anticipation for this book. When I finished book 2 I was gutted to find Sylvia Day hadn't yet release book 3, so I went onto my kindle and pre-ordered the book ready for its release.....I wish I hadn't bothered!<br /><br />The first two books were fantastic, they kept you guessing and enjoying the development of Gideon and Evas unconventional relationship along with storylines developing of other characters in the background.<br /><br />All I can think of with Entwined with you is that Sylvia Day ran out of ideas for this book! The book started off confusing and it continued on to be a try hard book concentrating on the sex element of the relationship instead of managing a storyline. The two main characters (Gideon and Eva) actually became boring) As for the end all I can think is Sylvia day is making good money from these books so why stop at 3, lets cut the end off at a really bizarre part and make some more money with book 4.<br /><br />Sorry for the bad press with this review but there was so much scope for this book and it missed the mark on every level.

B00B2V66VS|5.0|I like this one better than first version. It has more obstacles, turns and hills. I love going through the tunnels

B001XV09UG|3.0|Now that the two are divorces and living different paths, the story has a different atmosphere  than when it was released.

0553582038|5.0|Based on many reviews I've seen for the book, it seems this is where readers have begun to grow unhappy with the series. Perhaps it's because they were so upset about the long wait. Or maybe it's due to the fact that the series' most popular characters, Tyrion, Dany, and Jon Snow, are all MIA. There's also the problem that Martin takes up a few unclear plot threads that, by the novel's end, lead seemingly nowhere. These are legitimate gripes, but it's important to evaluate the book as it is and not as it should have been. Here you should find that A Feast of Crows, though uneven at times, is just as addictive as its predecessors.<br /><br />I will admit this book is more subdued than its predecessors, and it lacks the major plot events as well, but nonetheless it is a remarkable read. The novel is almost worth reading for Cersei's parts alone. She is the novel's major character, and her schemes driven by her intense paranoia are lots of fun to watch unfold. We get a deeper look into the characters of Jaime and Brienne, who both get to set out on adventures that, if anything, help paint a picture of the landscape left behind by the war of the five kings. Samwell remains one of the few untarnished \\"good\\" characters, and this novel shows the beginnings of major things to come his way. Arya and Sansa both play minor roles. While I enjoyed Sansa's parts because we get to see behind the scenes of some of Littlefinger's scheming, Arya's part was not done quite so well. It's unclear where Martin is taking her character by the end. Three of the Greyjoys also have character perspectives, and they're a little more interesting than I thought they would be. Mostly I liked the kingsmoot. The Dornish as well played a small part, mostly from behind the eyes of Arianne Martell, but these are the least interesting parts of the novel and Martin could have done without them.<br /><br />What makes these books so great is the human factor. These novels are about human failures and the frailty of human success. Many of the characters have some major flaw, defect, pain, or weakness. Brienne is a woman with the build and looks of a man. Tyrion is a dwarf. Bran is a cripple. Jaime is a warrior without his sword hand. Sam is fat. Prince Doran has terrible gout. These are men and women who are unable to mask their vulnerabilities, but must work that much harder to make up for them in the novel's cruel world. Pain comes much more often than not. Almost all of the characters are strongly driven to achieve some goal, which makes it that much more disappointing when they come upon a powerful force working against them. The end goal of this series is that somebody will be crowned king/queen of the Seven Kingdoms, and maybe more. Only one person (or two) can achieve this goal, which means that most of the characters in the series are doomed to failure, and that's just a part of human life. We will fall in love with characters and root for them, but only one can win, and it can't always be the one you're rooting for.<br /><br />While there is certainly a little unevenness in A Feast for Crow's story, Martin's accomplishment in this series is astounding. He has done the incredible feat of juggling a massive assortment of complex characters and intertwining them in a fantastic story. Part of my own feelings of disappointment lie in the fact that the book had to end. There's also the fact that I really wanted to know where Tyrion ran off to, and I want to see Daenerys continue to kick butt, and I'm very curious to see how Jon Snow handles his new Lord Commander position. At least book five is already out. My main concern is that by the time Martin finally releases book six I will have forgotten so much I'll need to keep turning to the map and the character list every five sentences. Nonetheless, the imagination of the author who wrote these books is phenomenal.ailty of human success. Many of the characters have some major flaw, defect, pain, or weakness.

B007HACDLK|4.0|Great book, looking forward and reading Mitch Rapp from the beginning, going to be a busy summer of reading. U
B0038Z5SEW|4.0|This movie is relativly simple to describe and yet it actually proves to be quite a powerful movie for those able to appreciate it. Other examples of this are Powder, Bicentinall Man, Slumdog Millionaire, No Reservations, The Invisible and many others I can't remember.<br /><br />I feel everything within the movie is handled brillently, the harshness of the land, the survival aspect, the cast's personalities and the dialogue between Baldwin and Hopkins. The dialogue is what keeps viewers interested in the film as Hopkins and Baldwin must incorporate multiple dimenshions into their roles. They must relate to each other as busniess partners, fellow men trapped in the wilderness, having a deep past history, frustration due to the other's behavior and then convincly, change their personalities as the film ends. That is extremely hard to do in any movie, but these two did it.<br /><br />Also I like how the music helped give a sense to the movie as it got upbeat and faster when problems occured and was sooving when everything was calm.<br /><br />There are two minor problems I have though. One Hopkins could've saved a lot of problems by telling Baldwin immediatly why he wanted the trouser legs burned. Two, even though it was the only convicable ending possible, I'm somewhat dissapointed in it after all those two had been through.<br /><br />Awesome movie and if I could do 4.5 stars I would.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I loved the story line, it was fun to watch, it wasn't boring, I don't remember seeing this in the theater otherwise I would have gone to see it
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Love it. I wish the next season was free as well. Needto continue the series. why do Ineed 5 morewords
B005NFVZTM|1.0|This was such a disappointment, I don't know it was boring, something was missing, it didn't have the feel of the other Xmen
B009XIXVU6|5.0|there is so much love in these families, it is heartwarming in inspiring. I recommend this book to anybody it has universal values
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|He just makes great movies, he is such a good actor, I wish he would make more like this, but my favorite is<br />The last Samuri
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book took so many twist and turns in the characters involved. This book was another insight in the Afghan people and their culture and thinking.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Great android version of game. My only problem is the installer size it takes up as lot of room. Otherwise it is perfect
076115678X|4.0|Having wavy hair and a daughter with really curly hair, I had to get this book. I'm so glad I did. Some of the book is really cheesy, like using &#34;hair&#34; sayings to make a point like &#34;self mane-tenance&#34; or &#34;It's all about Hue!&#34; or another, &#34;The down and dirty root-ine&#34;.  Gag. I am not a fan of playing on words. She did it throughout the entire book. Drove me nuts after awhile. Also, I got this book for my daughter and the quiz at the beginning had some questions that didn't really apply to a pre-teen, like &#34;Do you live in fear of humidity, sweating, spontaneous sex, a shower with your lover...&#34;  Yeah, she doesn't need to read that. Not only that, the author assumes that us girls with curly or wavy hair, hate our hair. I don't hate my hair. She also suggests throwing away your straightener. What? No. What if I want a different look? Straight haired girls curl their hair so what is wrong with me straightening mine? Just silly.<br /><br />I do like the book though because it had a lot of tips for making my hair look better. I gave up shampoo and boy did that make a difference! I would have never known. I also like her ideas for making my hair more curly/wavy. I didn't even use the DVD because honestly, the book did a great job of describing how to make my hair work for me. I recommend this book to any person who has curly or wavy hair. It really helped me and I do love my hair a little more, even if I think the author is a corn ball.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Great show ever. i cant wait for the new season and this season just gets to you. love the guys
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I was expecting this case to be poor quality. I don't know why. But after I got it, I really like the sturdiness of it. The color was nice (I love red!) and it was great for what I needed it for. I like to use Kindle while cooking dinner either for recipes or playing music, and I love that I can stand this on its side and its stays in place. The elastic piece keeps the case closed when not in use. I actually dropped my Kindle the other day but this case protected it very well. No worries at all. The case is hard plastic and does a good job of protecting your Kindle Fire.
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|Great show. A successful spinoff of the stagate movie. If they do another one they should pick up where the shows left off and include Atlantis!
1781162646|4.0|This book was a beautifully well written Coming of Age book about a 21 year old young man named Devin who breaks from college to go work at Joyland(a coastal amusement park) and his experiences during this time. I liked the book a lot but it wasn't what I expected. I guess from the critics reviews and the way the book was presented I was expecting a tale of horror and mystery which there was a little bit(maybe 5 pages or so)...but nonetheless I did enjoy the read and would recommend to anyone, just don't expect an edge of your seat mystery or thriller.
B0079LJZG8|2.0|Wanted to like it, but you must have had to have read the book to get the plot at all.  There were many scenes inexplicably stuck in there that must have meant something to someone.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|A very enjoyable novel. The characters were interesting and nice. The story was well written. I can hardly wait to read the next adventure.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|This is by far the best marvel movie. Action packed from beginning to end. Love the humor too! Can't wait for the next Avenger movie!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Could have been more detailed in instructions. It was frustrating a lot of the times. But it did make me really focus and pay attention to every detail. If you really looking for a detailed challenge, this is the game for you.
B009R5GR1K|5.0|I am amazed that I can have dictionaries in many languages as well as translation dictionaries, e.g., English/Spanish in my little Kindle--all from one program. I can even hear the pronunciation.<br /><br />With the inexpensive upgrade, the dictionaries I select are downloaded to my Kindle and available offline, too. WOW!
B00CWVGBEO|5.0|Great movie. He picks right back up where he left off in movie making. Thanks for coming back Arnold. Too many movies are made now where the main charactor is so tiny and beats everyone up the whole movie. A guy Arnold's size is believable at least. Funny movie also. A lot of great Arnold one lines.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|I was really looking forward to this book  but after reading it I was disappointed..Not nearly as good as the first two.  Not excited at all about the next book especially if it's as average as this one was.
1593272839|5.0|I am less than half way through the book, but I would recommend the book from just the part that I have read so far.  Haskell is not an easy language to learn, but the author breaks it down into easily understandable pieces.  I agree with the reviewer who complained about the lack of exercises.  What I have been doing is to try to solve the example programming problems before looking at how they are done in the book.  It is a testament to the quality of the book (and not my programming ability) that I have been able to create solutions to most the example problems.
B000JMKNVK|5.0|All of the Kenzie and Gennaro books are some of the best mystery/intrigue novels I have ever read.  I prefer them to Lehane's stand alone work, as well, which is very good.  But the six Kenzie/Gennaro's are compelling...
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Wonderful touching story of believable people living in Afganistan, a place otherwise thought of by me as a place with only warlike aggression and fanatical radical Islamist killing each other forever.<br />I am happy to receive an additional belief as to the people of that region.
B005CRQ4XI|1.0|Disappointed that this was on Oprahs List. I will be hesitant to use that as a tool to choose any future \\"book club\\" books.
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|I love the Die Hard franchise. So when they announce that they were making Die Hard 5 I was excited. Overall it was a let down. Plenty of action, but Bruce Willis seemed like a supporting character. He wasn't his usual John McClain. It wasn't the excitement of being trapped like Die Hards 1&2. I hope they fix this with the upcoming Die Hard 6.
B002RN2S62|4.0|I liked it ,thought it was a very good movie and my grandkids loved it.I plan to buy the movie.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|Maybe I'm getting \\"old\\"...47.  Don't mind a splash of F-bomb, as a point highlighter.  Making the F-bomb a form of dialog for the entire movie wears out quickly.  Everything else about the movie was as great as the other comments stated.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I'm hooked! Great show.I'm sure others will have negative things to say...but I love the show and really didn't think I would.
1426209584|5.0|This book is amazing and the story behind it is also engaging.  We saw the authors live at the Nat Geo presentation and they sold us on the book.  These birds are really just jazzed up crows which makes them both smart and beautiful.  Can't beat that combo.
B00D6BU8GG|2.0|Not much content in this movie, just a lot of explosions and action.  Bruce Willis is good in it, if you are a Bruce Willis fan, but for my husband and I (who are Bruce Willis fans), the storyline and character building was weak.
B00499NHLC|5.0|This is a great update of the Holmes stories. Cumberbatch does a great, quirky Holmes and the stories a clever and engaging.  A must for Sherlock Holmes fans.
B009JZVT70|5.0|My husband and I are always looking for good TV series to watch on Amazon.  We didn't start watching this series on regular TV, so we decided to give it a try on Amazon.  Very clever and entertaining.  Different than anything else we watch.  Worth your time!
B001XUH69Y|5.0|Come on.  You don't need my review.  This is the best movie ever made.  And you know it all by heart.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|If you like Maggie Smith, this is a fun movie to watch.  Completely entertaining and worth your time.  Maggie Smith is wonderful in this!
0739366408|4.0|Excellent stories as a adjunct to the movie. A group of short stories.  If you enjoy the movie you will enjoy this book.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|Finding a PC with either a Firewire port (good luck with that these days) or a PCI expansion port for a Firewire card in order to meet my Audio Recording needs was nearly impossible. I couldn't find anything via the main manufactures except a moderate Lenovo.<br /><br />Finally, I found out about the relatively new \\"Thunderbolt\\" port and that I could buy a Thunderbolt to Firewire adapter. This adapter is for the current FW800 standard so to interface to an older FW400 device will require a FW800 - FW400 adapter cable ($8-12) of which you can read my review about the cable I purchased. Also, this adapter IS NOT JUST A CABLE, it has a Texas Instruments Firewire chip-set BUILT IN. Texas Instruments chip-sets work with nearly any Firewire device. I've used TI chip-sets with two different audio recording interfaces and two different Windows PC's (Vista & Win 8).<br /><br />Scott
B009KEN87O|5.0|I felt like Ender! I just started playing today and I love it. I can't wait to really get going!
B005PK57IK|5.0|I love being able to re-watch &#34;The Good Wife&#34;.  An excellent vehicle for Juliana Margulies and other good actors.  Thank you.
B004P1JEXE|4.0|A great read. I couldn't put it down. George Martin as an author is in the same league as Sir Walter Scott in his portrayal of medieval life. Unexpected surprises keep popping out,and keeping up with new characters is challenging.<br />I can thoroughly recommend this book.<br />When do books 6 &7 hit the shelves?
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|My new Ankee car charger is awesome it is a great addition to my other Anker products, thanks again Anker.
B005EWDA9M|5.0|With his special way of writting, Murakami, keeps you reading and reading and wanting to read even more. I just could not stop. With this writer it is more how everything flows rather than the exact plot and focus of his books.
B00CB4ET0K|2.0|It's free till you play, then you have to buy weapons to continue.  In my business that is called a bait and switch.
B005EWDA3I|4.0|Found this book a nice continuation of the other two. I was expecting to learn more about the &#34;little people&#34;...... Writing was great as always. I guess I was expecting something more complicating for the ending. Although it was great reading it and I would encourage everyone to go ahead and read it!
B0028R3NCU|5.0|Small, easy to conceal and works great.  I purchased two of them because I wanted to have a couple of extras.  I currently use one in my medical ID bracellet/band, that has a slot for a paper ID with information...well this little guy fits right in there, and holds so much more information that that little piece of paper ever could.  I'm sure there are hundreds of other uses but this fits my needs, and I'm more confident in having my medical information available in case of an emergency!
B005F2BBLK|3.0|We have watched other movies that were funnier though the story line on water was unique. So was the use of desert creatures.
