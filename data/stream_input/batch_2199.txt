0470901071|5.0|I wish I had started studying for the CCNA with this book - I would have saved myself some time, money, and grief.  Simple, focused, easy read, and not too deep.  The other resources have their place, but this is a great tool to help you pass the CCNA exam.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Had to get the DVD to understand the movie.  Don't hear very well and the language moves too fast for me.  Other than that, I enjoyed the fantasy.
B00AJLHULW|4.0|From giving guitar lessons by pushing the curve forward as a pioneer in electric blues, which is he is known for and justly acknowledged, and sings and plays some songs, artfully.<br /><br />The less than favorable comments remind me of my own reaction to another guitarist's decision to recenter his focus on the songs versus the solos.<br /><br />EC's 461 Ocean Boulevard was released after a very long series of groundbreaking recordings with and by: Mayall; Cream; Blind Faith; Eric Clapton (1st solo record); Derek and the Dominos...All loaded with burning electric guitar.  Ocean Boulevard was full of softer, laid back songs and short, melodic solo breaks that supported the tunes.  I wanted my hard earned after school job at the ice cream parlor money back when I first played that album.  I now have the extended re release with live concert CD of that same \\"too mellow\\" band and enjoy the music immensely.<br /><br />Robben is a very musical guy, who loves songs and has recently devoted more effort/focus to writing and singing.  I like this performance very much and look forward to Robben's continued work.<br /><br />Some pretty burning guitar on Robben's recent rock band release with Renegade Creation and imagine that his live, acoustic release with Larry Carlton will be guitar jam centric.  He can do both.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like it but I think there needs to be an Easier way to get money and to get health
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This is an amazing game.The graphics are excellent rather have different music playing. I would recommend this game to everyone and even younger people will love it too.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|Saw this years ago and remembered it to be so engaging.  I wasn't disappointed to see it again.  It is funny and loopy....
B00867GHS8|5.0|Got this for $22 and change, and you can't beat that price.  Image is crystal clear, and looks amazing on any size screen.  If you're a Blu-ray fan like myself, this is a must have.
B0034JKZ3G|5.0|I would give the film itself about 4 stars, but the high def presentation of it takes it all the up for me.  Next to Sleeping Beauty, this is the best looking cell-animated Blu-ray disc I own.<br /><br />About the film: I was pleasantly surprised that Disney embraced what some would hypersensitively label stereotypical black characteristics: voodoo, street dancing, and the little display the cook puts on while he's making fun of Tiana's dream of a downpayment is almost a self-mockery of blacksploitation theatrics.  They really took some chances, and the results are thrilling.  I think black culture is too important and genuine to tiptoe around, and Disney, of all entities, actually did it right.<br /><br />The cajun accent of the lightning bug sounded contrived I thought, but it's growing on me.  I've seen the movie three times now, and so far it keeps getting better.  I think this one will age very well, and will be considered a top 15-or-so all time Disney animated feature (not counting Pixar) when it's all said and done.  Maybe even top 10.  And for high def presentations, top 5.  Highly recommended. This movie is a blast and a treat for the eyes.<br /><br />Oh, lastly, I should put in a word for the sound.  I don't have a fancy set-up, but even on my little Sony sound bar, this is one of the richest sounding blu-rays I've heard.
B0038ZITIE|5.0|It is a great movie. I loved it as a kid. Flash Gordon is just to cool. Go Flash Go!!!
B004LWZWGA|3.0|This movie was a bit difficult for me to follow.  I plan to give it another try.  Since I haven't seen the other Batman movies, I am definitely not a good reviewer for this movie.

B00632HWOG|1.0|Ever since Verizon.net teamed up with Yahoo I've had nothing but problems.  I don't get emails from one of my contacts, who just happens to have Yahoo as her email address, and she doesn't get emails from me.  I have spammed numerous emails and yet I still keep getting them in my inbox. Many times when I sign on I am not showing I am available and I have to click to make myself available in messaging.  Many times I have go off IE and come back on just to show my emails.  I really wish Verizon had not hooked up with Yahoo.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|I wish I could of seen it at the movies, but had the pleasure of renting it on Amazon.com.  When looking for movie, I was so happy to see it on your list.  My husbands been wanting to see it. We watched it four times!
B005DI66N4|5.0|Read the book, &#34;The Long Walk.&#34; and purchased &#34;The Way Back&#34; DVD which was taken from the book.  Although they were the same story, they were very different.  Both were excellent.
1616550414|5.0|Everything you would expect within. Beautiful artwork, great quotes, the timeline itself recaptures the games well and patches everything up nicely. The book does what it is meant to do, help branch the underlying pattern without breaking away the reader as Link.<br />The bonus comic makes the book worth it alone as it brings everything together extremely well.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This was a lovely book.  The story and the 'telling' of the story through consecutive letters written by the characters was unique and enhanced the tale with their individual voices.  The use of letters allows the reader insight into the thought processes of each author.  The story has everything you would want; history, depth, life, death, love, fear, mystery and romance.  You will certainly enjoy this book.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|A story of love and loss.  A Gothic novel for certain with a surprise ending.  This illusionist had an intense way of performing his magic, gripping from beginning to end.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Amazon's delivery was flawless.  The film though not 100% historically accurate was well done.  High suspense was scripted even though audiences know how it ends.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to you was wonderful to read. It was even better than Fifty Shades because the characters were both adults and not innocent. They fell hard and the story is sexual in a perfect way. I can't wait to read the next book.
B002ZG980U|2.0|Definitely not my type of movie.  I gave it away to a family that liked it.  This kind of movie may be interesting to many people, but I want to be entertained, even educated, but not confused.
B001AT4Y84|5.0|action was great. loved it all.would watch it again any time. good entertainment for all ages over ten years oif age..
B0070Y46UY|4.0|the fist part of the book was a bit boring.  But once you get into it you can see the first part was necessary for you to understand the rest of the book.  I certainly do recommend this to everyone.  But I warn them it is a bit slow at first.<br /><br />A very interesting story that has stayed in my mind since reading it.
0312641893|5.0|I'm in awe!  This novel incorporated all the classic elements of the Cinderella fairy-tale into a sci-fi, futurist retelling.  And it was flawless, each character represented perfectly!  I'm amazed by the genius behind Marissa Meyer's work.  But not only did the story fit in all the elements of a Cinderella tale, it also was unique, suspenseful, and fun all on it's own.<br /><br />So, since it's a futurist retelling, instead of it being 'Cinderelly, Cinderelly, washing the dishes, do the mopping' it was 'Cinder, fix the android robot, fix the hover craft'.  Cinder is a cyborg (a human with mechanical parts), a 2nd-class citizen in her world, and there's no way she'll ever go to the ball.  Not that she even wants to.  She's too busy working as a mechanic and earning a living for the family.  Her robot sidekick Iko--who I liked to think of as the fairy-godmother of the story--is practically her only friend until she meets the prince.  Wearing a hoodie as disguise, the story kicks off the moment Prince Kai visits Cinder's booth in the crowded New Beijing market place and asks her to fix his android.<br /><br />I read this one at hyper-speed, as I couldn't get enough, and loved every moment of the story until the very end.  It ends on a cliff-hanger.  Picture the movie Ever After with Drew Barrymore: she goes to the ball... the prince is so excited to see her until it's revealed that she's not royalty as he thought but a lowly peasant... the step-mom rips off her wings... Drew runs away in tears leaving her shoe behind... the prince is angry thinking he was betrayed until he realizes that it doesn't matter if Drew is royalty or not because he loves her just the same... the end.  Now picture the movie ending before the prince's realization.  What if he never brought Drew Barrymore the shoe, expressed his love, called her by her real name?  The movie would have felt unfinished.  Well, that's how--more or less--this book ended.<br /><br />But, book #2 is already out so hopefully I'll have my ending soon enough :)<br /><br />Bottom line:  Buy it!  Read it!  I really liked it!efully I'll have my ending soon enough :)<br /><br />Bottom line:  Buy it!  Read it!  I really liked it!
B005MJDJQQ|5.0|I chose this series because a West Point classmate of mine recommended it.  I like this type of detective series with characters that seem real with their own challenges and weaknesses.  I also appreciate the opportunity to get a feel for Sweden and its people.
B001TXWJ4M|4.0|Well written, and funny in spots, but I am not a fan of the subject matter, which is drugs and dealers.  The irony of such a straight laced guy turning to selling drugs because he thinks he is going to die and wants to leave his family with some money is interesting but I do not like the drug dealer stuff at all.  Hooked now, so I guess I will keep watching.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|We love,love, love this show!!! So glad that we are able to stream it through Amazon and that as a prime member we get it free!!
B008673ZAQ|3.0|This book did not have the thrill in it that Day's first Crossfire Novel had. A novel filled with a handful of spelling errors that distract from the overall work. This novel seemed to continual move around in circles without truly going anywhere. Parts where suspenseful, but nothing nail biting. An okay novel.
0446580848|1.0|Having read most of DeMille's work and being a big fan, I was anxious to read his latest book.  I was 3/4 through the book and still waiting for something of interest besides John Corey's wise cracks!  I can not recommend this book. Sorry I wasted my time reading it. Poor story line,and lack of intrigue.
B0063FGG22|5.0|Typical Alfred Hitchcock & Cary Grant Thriller.  if you like Hitchcock, and your a fan of Cary Grant, this is a Classic Suspense Thriller that you should have.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is amazing there is nothing bad that I have found about it. It has great edge retention,really egrnomic, and is by far the biggest knife I own. The sheath is also very high quality. Ethan Becker THANK YOU!!!!!!!! :)
B008HFWF3U|4.0|The highlight of the Orchestrion concert in Oslo, was when, after PM played a tune or two with just a couple of automatic instruments, they pulled the curtains and revealed a large symphony orchestra with not a single musician except for Mr Metheny himself. I've been a devoted fan of Pat since he played with Gary Burton in Molde 1975, and I think the Orchestrion Project offers an excellent, and very special experience, but - for listening to his music on CD's I prefer small combos - my favorite being Quartet Live.
B0017SWPXY|1.0|Could not put this book down , we'll written and even tho the racing world is foreign to me and is,piped some of the details the over all story was good as I am a dog lover,

B005CRQ4GU|1.0|This book is AWESOME. This is the 4th time that I've read it. I've read every diary of a wimpy kid. This book rocks and so does Jeff Kinney.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I heard about this movie on PBS. Ordered the DVD. Incredible. A movie I will never forget. I then replayed this movie for a friend. I will never forget seeing her jaw drop halfway through the movie. If you watch the movie, you will understand.<br /><br />I loved the music, I loved the story. Incredible! This movie will appeal to all of us who love poets. Loved this Movie.
B000XA5K48|4.0|This is a simple fun action pic, not to be taken too seriously. The plot is that a hit-man named Smith, ends up with the help of a hooker, taking care of a baby and protecting it from  a bunch of bad guys. Along the way their are a lot of implausible, but good scenes(one of my favorite is when smith is having sex and a shoot out at the same time) that make this film work. Just sit down, grab a drink and some popcorn and enjoy.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I really enjoyed the book. I would recommend this book to people 16ish and up. I am younger than 16 (14) and I still enjoyed it. This book is definitely a great read, but being a teenager, I found it somewhat unrelatable. I would never say I feel \\"infinite\\". I will be a freshman pretty soon and this kind of worries me.... I hope to not experience most of the things in this book...ever.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Excellent step by step instructions, from writing your book, formatting it properly, to publishing.  Very easy to understand and not very lengthy at all!
B00ADIT8U2|3.0|Some objects look &quot;tappable&quot; but they aren't ..which was a little bit of a bummer. They could have done a lot more with it but it was okay.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Awesome I absolutely loved it so exhilarating really like the different locations !Ny,Rio,and  Rome !!!!it is really my favorite game
B00BHMETKC|2.0|This is not the first time this story has been told about the hostage rescue. This time they just used some great actors but it was not even close to what the critics said. The documentary on the history channel was more interesting. I wish I had read a review like this and waited for it to come on late night cable instead of spending money on it.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|Missed an episode when we were out of town. Could not wait until we got home!! Had to download it on vacation!! Walking Dead rocks!!

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Excellent, keeps.me and my son entertained for hours, he loves the compete part of the game, bit of an annoyance having to collect gems, good game apart from that
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Great time killer lol I enjoyed this better then most apps, I enjoy puzzle games and this one adds an element of gun with out the lag.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love this book, I am in love with the characters and the story overall. I'm not sure that it's because it hits so close to home, but I have all my feelings all over the place. Regardless I love it and I'm waiting not so patiently for my next one. Thanks for such a beautiful story.
0439023548|3.0|I love the story line created by the Hunger Games trilogy.  However, this has to be my least favorite of the three books.  It is still a good book, but it is slightly predictable.
B007REV4YI|5.0|this is a really awesome movie, i have always been a james bond fan but this one is really really good! seriously i think Daniel Craig does a great job as 007
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really enjoy playing this game with the family .... it's great to collect the words and earn coins to buy the men.

B004WKH4PS|5.0|A must see movie!! Joan Crawforfd is mesmerizing! I wish I had seen it years ago! It is a great movie.
B003GK22D4|5.0|Great story unless you happen to be Palestinian. Good mix of tension combined with a laid-back way of laying out the action.<br />The only weak part was where the author very poorly dealt with the action parts related to the &#34;female interest&#34;, slightly misogynistic in portraying her thought processes compared to the male characters.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is excellent. The story line is excellent. Although yes it is surrounding sex between a couple it has so much more to offer. Could not put it down!!!

B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Call me a softy for animated films, but the venue is not what carried this story. The story was easy to follow despite a silly plot, and the animation and voice overs will keep everyone from  9 to 90 cracking up. You'll love this movie.

B00AYB0TOW|1.0|Okay, so I see that the pickings were slim on this particular day, so I take a shot at an action movie to entertain me. I would have been smarter to have turned on PBS and watched a cooking show. The story line butchered the original move, and for 20 minutes I was waiting for Stallone to put this movie out of his misery, but he never showed.
B008476HBM|5.0|Gotta love this classics. Can never go wrong with getting a book by Austen. Excellent writer and plus it was free!
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|This movie appeared to have been staged to be a good movie with its left field story line, but they chose random violence over the story-line. Lack-luster performances.
0765348276|5.0|One of the things that made me get it was the review on the insider cover from Publisher's Weekly said:<br /><br />As a lifetime Heinlein fan, that would have been enough to make me buy it but the fact that it was the first in a three part series helped. If a book sucks, I can drop it and not worry about it again, but if it's good, I like to revisit the same world.Though a lot of SF writers are more or less efficiently continuing the tradition of Robert A. Heinlein, Scalzi's astonishingly proficient first novel reads like an original work by the late grand master.<br /><br />My next step after reading the inner review quotes is to read the first couple of paragraphs. Old Man's War starts off with:<br /><br />I did two things on my seventy-fifth birthday. I visited my wife's grave. Then I joined the army.<br /><br />I got a serious Starship Troopers (all grown up) sense of deja vu.<br /><br />To top it off, the back cover blurb sucked me right in:<br /><br />The good news is that humanity finally made it to the stars. The bad news is that, out there, planets fit to live on are scarce. So, we fight. Far from Earth, the war has been going on for decades: brutal, bloody, unyielding.<br /><br />Sign me up! I bought the book on the spot. I did not regret it.<br /><br />A quick synopsis: in the future, we (as in us humans) have made it into space. We are in a perpetual fight with many other species for the rare habitable planets. For the most part we are out gunned and out manned.<br /><br />The colonial defense force (CDF) is in charge of recruiting for, and executing the war. The CDF recruits only from earth, not from the colonies. The colonies need every able body to expand and maintain. The CDF has an interesting recruitment policy, you have to be sign up when you're 65 and you actually join when you hit 75.<br /><br />The CDF wants people with experience. By 75, most people have accumulated quite a bit of experience. Of course, you might wander how a bunch of 75+ recruits can take on the bug-eyed monsters of the Galaxy. John, our protagonist ponders the same question.<br /><br />The book is almost like two very different books. The first is John leaving Earth, joining the army and getting to know his recruit-mates. He also learns how it is that 75+ year olds are fighting a war. They aren't. At least not unchanged.<br /><br />Mildly spoily alert!<br /><br />In the second part, John learns exactly what it means to become a superhuman. He is turned into a green skinned, genetically engineered killing machine. I'll leave it to you to read the particulars. John learns how to fight and kill in his new body. He goes on several different missions before being blown apart on a failed mission. On that mission he runs into someone very, very familiar.<br /><br />I have to agree with the publisher's weekly reviewer. To me, this book has a very Heinlein-esque feel to it. It moves quickly and has a matter of fact writing style that is very reminiscent of RAH.<br /><br />The attitudes on sex and sexual orientation are also very RAH, even if they are somewhat modernized. The science feels very plausible and seems day to day. The shockers are explained well and I was easily able to suspend disbelief.<br /><br />This is a good book. I have the second in the series, The Ghost Brigades, and will be buying the third. I give this one two thumbs up!<br /><br />It's interesting to note that Scalzi is a long time blogger, Whatever and has a fairly extensive bibliography (including Uncle John's Bathroom Reader). You can read his mini-biblio and bio.uits can take on the bug-eyed monsters of the Galaxy.

B00APUQH0W|4.0|It was an enjoyable 90 minutes watching yet another Clint Eastwood movie. The story was a tad off-beat, but the acting was pretty good. Eastwood always gives you a movie you can talk about later, and for the few times in my movie-viewing, I didn't have to look at people boffing each other in some pointless nude scene.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I resisted the overtures of friends and social media for two years. One snowy Sunday I put on the first episode and before realized I had viewed the entire first season. I finished season 2&3 in the next 10 days. Totally obsessed, I was.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy this game. There are a few levels that are frustrating as hell, but there is always a way to get all 3 stars and feed the creature. I have beaten both this one and the original, and am now going back through to make sure I get all the stars. Really enjoyable!
B008X8QCTO|4.0|For everyone complaining that they charge more after you start playing, they no longer charge for this. Where there was a price it now says free. Also to use the strategy guide you have to like them on Facebook every time you use it. Instead of liking them every time you can do it once and then hit the back button after that. Hopefully I didn't make this too confusing to understand. Overall it was a good game. The length was decent compared to other games I've played.<br />Would recommend.
B00B29J0I6|4.0|This is a fun game, but it didn't take long to complete it. I would like to see a lot more levels added.

B00136NUG6|3.0|The sound quality is great, but I feel I could have found a Youtube Channel that would provide me with the same quality. Because Youtube is free, I would recommend just listening to Earth, Wind & Fire on Youtube, instead of spending money on this product.

B004XQYBA2|3.0|Appears to be the exact same game engine as Sudoku 4Ever (which is by the same developer), though the U.I. is not as user friendly. Downloaded both apps via the Free App-of-the-day program, but if I had to pay for either one, Sudoku 4ever would be the better choice.

B00BFBSV72|5.0|this game is very fun. its just like Doodle jump only better. I would recommend this game. that is all; thanks
B004XQYBA2|5.0|I like games, and with Sudoku, you don't have to wait for someone else to play. Now, when I have a few minutes to kill, I can work on my latest puzzle.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Love Downton Abbey!  Kept my interest...not a boring moment...The ending was so sad, but it just makes you want to see more...Can't wait to see the next season.
B000VMFDW2|4.0|Perhaps the best written first hand account of life on the frontlines in the Pacific Theater of WWII. It really changes the impression of the old John Wayne/Sgt. Striker myth to the real heroism demostrated by our young men far away from home.  A &#34;must read!&#34;
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a best seller I love it even my baby niece who is 2 loves it<br />The best game ever
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game kid fun and addicting and helps passages TIME! What can you not love about it!!:)thanks for making this game!
B001CDZZI6|4.0|This product was very convenient for me because I was able to access it on my computer rather than having to wait for it to arrive in the mail. My only negative comment was that it took a little while for the StrengthsFinder to send me my access code. Longer than I expected anyway. Other than that, a great product.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|I've been hearing about this Doctor Who since his first visit to American TV many years ago.  I never quite got around to seeing any episodes.  Amazon Prime (free shipping & free streaming videos) had this Doctor Who, Season 1, so I gave it a go.  Wonderful! Wonderful stories, wonderful writing, wonderful actors, fantastic special effects.<br /><br />I have since learned that this is Season 1 of THIS incarnation - with another set of seasons later, and many seasons earlier.  I AM HOOKED!  - I've gots lots more to see - looks like Amazon Prime has about 8 seasons for me to watch - hope to get to view them all, plus the others I missed...<br /><br />I plan to meet The Doctor one day, and perhaps step inside his tiny police call box...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|some might say I'm over doing it but subway surfers is fun. its just like temple run only with better missions and themes. also we earn coins for different gadgets characters and hove boards.we also get to verse friends. i get addicted to this game and i truly love it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|its a very fun game to play in my free time. I recommend it to any animal lover's. I give it five out of five stars
B00633W614|5.0|As usual, Jeffrey Archer crafts a great story.  This is an excellent 2nd book (the first, also a great read, is Only Time Will Tell) in the Clifton Chronicles trilogy.  I am, however, waiting with trepidation for the 3rd instalment (Best Kept Secrets), because based on the pre-publication blurbs, the story line appears to take a twist which does not quite appeal to me.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|One of my all time favorites . I tell everyone I know to read this book. It's that good. I can't wait for Travis  point of view.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I liked everything about it . . . gave me a lot of comfort along with a lot less fear of death!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I love the Muppets and would love to be in one of their movies.  Grew up on them and adored the Muppet Show.  Jim Henson was a visionary and thankfully, like Walt Disney, he never gave up.  Micheal Cain is awesome and I can't imagine anyone else in this role.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Awesome game In all, but there's only one problem. Every time I play I'll be going and going and then, BOOM! just like that, I just randomly run off of a cliff. No way to turn or anything.  The only way to go is straight and if you go straight yo fall off the cliff. So that's pretty much the only problem.
B00B2G4O2G|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this show, but it is amazing.  I love Kevin Bacon and he is great in this role.  I'll keep watching week after week even though it was hard to sleep the first night I watched this.
B00A85EMVK|1.0|Love the movie and the 3D is terrific, but this disc had serious issues about 54 minutes in.  Received replacement from Amazon and it had the same issues ---- screen stopping, unable to continue.  Suspect it's just a bad batch of DVD's ... will re-order after that batch clears out.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|This Apple product is worth having.  No more fussing with batteries.  Just love it.  I would recommend it to all Mac users.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|Great little addicting game. Gotta love it when your bored in an airport, turn ur computer on and play plants vs zombies. Great times
B00B2V66VS|3.0|its pretty good... it closes every once in a while... by once in a while I mean every 3 times I use it... then I have to un-downlad it then re-download it again... after 3 downloaded it works... its sort of worth it... I guess
B000NTPDSW|5.0|What else can it be said. All three godfather movies in one case in BD. Can get any better than that
B008NW67E0|5.0|I love Mumford's jazzed up bluegrassy sound and the way most of the songs build up to an exciting crescendo.  True, if you've heard one the rest of them tend to be very similar.  But that also means if you like one track, you'll like all the rest.
B0099Y2MYK|2.0|Too many blank spaces in this version.  Was very disappointment in the english version.  Cannot understand how the American version is so different
074356619X|5.0|I purchased the CD set because I wanted to be inspired while driving. The sound quality is amazing. the set was well worth the money.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|Have complements on the color and the slimness of the note case.  I would recommend this item to my friends
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I found the first book to be better but, it starts to warm up after a bit.  Don't have any issues with sharing this book with my girls.
B006ATJXQW|5.0|I loved this book!  I also read the Maze Runner series and love them as well.  Great story!  Couldn't put the books down.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this app because I can have my own horse and complete in competitions I feel like I'm in heaven
B005HSL626|4.0|I got this for my son who is 10.  These are his remarks about the game after playing for only a day:<br /><br />Fruit ninja is fun because you have to slice the fruit or you lose a life. It would be more fun if achievements were easier to get.  I like the bombs and special bananas best.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|Fun to play. Quests started out relatively easy. Sometimes I can't visit neighbors because it says that there isn't any internet connection, but it's not a big deal. Unfortunately, the quests got ridiculously hard and fulfilling them turned into a job. I stopped playing it all together after about a month.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This game is the best free game I have played super fun and a good game for any age! its a must game to play
B0016J81B4|5.0|Absolutely the best kitchen clogs for the price. Have had Dansk for 5x the price, and the Crocs do not slip on the kitchen floors, storage truck ramps etc.
B00A77II0U|5.0|This is my second game from Alawar Entertainment and I love it! I play a lot of these types of games and this is a great combination of puzzles, hidden objects and plot. I especially like that you are reminded of the plot throughout the game and are always involved in the mystery. Played on expert mode there is just enough help available if you need it. Well worth the money. I will definitely be looking for more games from this company!
B00992CF6W|5.0|if you get this app you are smart I had a little trouble finding survivel mod but in the mean time I found it so you.<br />better get this app don't think about not buying it
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This is one of the best movies I have every seen. Nice and clean,. No cussing, no explosions and no killings. I cry every time I watch it. If only people could be as loyal as Hachi. I very highly reccomend this movie. I give it 10 stars. Richard Gere is not the star here it is the Akita Hachi.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|After hearing all the buzz around this work for the last couple of months I decided it was time to see what all the fuss was about. Anything rated this highly both on Goodreads and here on Amazon must have some merit to it. Turns out that is exactly the case and the high ratings are accurate as far as I'm concerned. This dystopian novel is engrossing and engaging. I found myself reading instead of doing all those pesky life things (oh like work, cleaning, cooking, errands lol) because I just had to know what was going to happen next. Howey created a story and a world that I wanted, and still do!, to know more of. The writing was very smooth and easy to read. Even the bits that got into the technology of the machines didn't bore me and flowed nicely with the narrative. A very solid 4 1/2 stars.
B004LWZW7Y|2.0|Really not what I thought it would be! I was expecting more than what I received, and it was very disappointing.
B000002QWD|5.0|Great album!  Lots of fun to play during Christmas Holidays as it reminds me of all our white Christmas's growing up in the 50's!
B009GQ57ES|5.0|With songs ranging from the hysterical to the melodic to the sentimental to the inspiring, this album is pure gold. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis prove that talent is color blind. Finally, some rap that covers a range of subjects with a lyrical style that anyone can relate to. Intense and intriguing, you can't help but to listen to this album from start to finish.
B00AFROVQC|1.0|I'm somewhat confused as to how the reviewer quoted by the publisher for this book could think this even comes close to comparable with the likes of J.K. Rowling, George R.R. Martin, and J.R.R. Tolkien. It doesn't. Not even close. In fact, I think it's kind of insulting to compare this book to them in a way. To be honest I couldn't even really make it to the end, so maybe it magically improves and redeems itself, but I highly doubt that.<br /><br />There's not much I can add that other negative reviews haven't already explained...the characters are one-dimensional stick figures populating a vaguely imagined world going through the motions of a stark thin plot. I made it to the part where they send TRAINEES on on an extremely dangerous patrol after, oh, about ONE DAY of what passes for training in this world (which didn't<br />include any advice on patrolling the dangerous area they were sent to). The insta-love between the main character and the princess had me rolling my eyes so much, I'm surprised my sockets didn't start bleeding from the wear and tear. If we're going to compare this book to any famous authors, I might compare it to Stephanie Meyer for its disproportionate hype to quality ratio, but at least Twilight was proofread. Thankfully, I didn't goug my eyes out, saving them from further abuse, but it was a close call.<br /><br />I guess what really grinds my gears about this book is that it could have been a lot of fun, and even interesting, but fell so, so short.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend spending money on this book...actually, don't even get it for free. It's not worth the precious time you'll be throwing away. You've been warned.<br /><br />Edited: 1/9/14
B008GWSS6W|5.0|John Wayne movies have always been some of my favorites and this one is my favorite of all of them. I had a little trouble with the picture quality on my kindle and it kept trying to download several times but the fourth time I tried to watch it it worked very well.
B000007VLL|4.0|&#34;Holding out for a hero&#34; was one of the tracks I had forgotten who did it. Looking for a &#34;Footloose&#34; dvd now.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I enjoyed playing this after so many years. When my husband & I were dating this game was very popular. We used to play this a lot.
B0000025BA|4.0|This cd brings back the memories of times from so long ago. This sounds like what could be a greatest hits cd.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy this game about every day. The only thing I don't like is the popups that come up on the kindle every time I try to play it. The popups only come up on Solitaire, not any of the other games I have.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Saw the reviews and low price and thought what the heck, why not try it. I wasn't disappointed. Give it a shot.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|Very confusing start to a movie until finally the characters and relationships started making some sense. Too artsy for it's own good and the dialogue added to the confusion. I survived getting to the point where I understood what was going on, but it was struggle. I rented it because it got an Oscar, and costume design was probably it's best asset. Guess I prefer my love stories to be more contemporary and not so dark.
B002ZG97RE|4.0|Good movie.<br />My own belief is that Bush sent the USA military to Iraq because Saddam H. tried to assassinate Bush's father in Kawate.  The National Government may have thought there were chemical weapons, but so what; most militarized countries have some sort of chemical weapons.  Saddam even used them in the Iraq Iran war and against the Kurds and we did nothing except help Iraq; so why was a war justified this time.<br />The movie was enjoyable but it hit too hard on the non-existent WMD.  There was even a hit on the Wall Street Journal for its reporting on the WMD situation before the war.  Imagine that, news organizations not telling the truth about the government's story line.<br />Like a lot of moves like this, they are so packed that the second or third viewing is better than the first.  I like to study the way scenes are put together and this movie is worth studying for its good acting and directing.

1451627297|5.0|I finished this book a few days ago, and I cannot get it out of my head.<br />This is the first Stephen King book I've ever read.  I didn't know he wrote anything other than horror.  Lately though, I've been trying to read as many best-sellers as I can, so this book started popping up.  Reading the title, I assumed this book was non-fiction, some sort of documentary on the JFK assassination.  Reading the author's name made me think horror.  Neither of these assumptions were true.  Even when I got the book from the library, I doubted I would finish it, because at 848 pages, it is daunting.  But I ended up buying it on my kindle.  Sooo much more convenient to read that way.  The hardback I had was cumbersome and made me feel like I'd never get through it.<br />Jake Epping is a 30-something teacher, recently divorced.  A friend of his owns a diner, and has an intriguing story to tell him.  He has stumbled upon a sort of \\"rabbit-hole\\" that leads to the past- 1958, to be exact.  The man (Al) has gone back in time on numerous occasions, and his most recent trip was an attempt to prevent the assassination of JFK.  If this were stopped, Al thought, then several other terrible things could be prevented as well, including the MLK and Robert Kennedy assassinations.  Al himself is very ill and can't complete his ultimate goal, so he enlists Jake's help.<br />Jake somewhat reluctantly agrees to the challenge.  But during his time in the past, he encounters many obstacles.  The main problem is that the past does not want to be changed.  The more significant the event Jake tries to alter, the more things seem to be fighting against him.  But that is not to say that his time in the past is all trials and tribulations.  At the heart of the story is the relationship that develops between Jake and a young woman named Sadie Dunhill.  As their relationship grows and as the critical 11-22-63 date draws near, the story focuses on Jake's \\"stalking\\" if you will, of Lee Harvey Oswald.  It ishard to put this book down as the hours, minutes, and seconds tick by, all leading up to the moment that changed America forever.<br />I have to say, I had no idea how this book was going to end.  It kept me guessing to the last page.<br />I cannot imagine the amount of research King had to do for this book.  It has something for everyone:  a love story, history, suspense, action, fantasy...I felt that it was an amazing idea for a book and executed perfectly.  I have read dozens and dozens of books this year from all different genres, and most of the best sellers from the past year or two, and I can honestly say that I cannot think of a book that moved me more or that I enjoyed more.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Incredibly written, without giving away secrets.  Gives the history of how he was found and an appreciation of those analyzing data.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|great concept. needs better touch response. I had to tap several times on objects. the story is good. good for a rainy weekend.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game ever. And the missions are so fun to complete. There is absolutely nothing negative about this game and I would recommend this amazing game to everyone.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I may be sick but am most involved with the characters, not the destruction of the &#34;Walkers&#34; as they are called. The plot line keeps me coming back for more each week.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best games since temple run and temple run 2.  Will be playing this game for a long time hoping there's a second one.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I may be sick but am most involved with the characters, not the destruction of the &#34;Walkers&#34; as they are called. The plot line keeps me coming back for more each week.
B000PC0U1W|5.0|Just for the collection, it's very good stuff. Good story, good effects, excellent performance of  Hugo as V.  Not easy to transmit a message with a mask on.
B00821PCJS|5.0|I liked the show from the beginning but could never seem to watch much of it. Had to buy it to truly love it...can't wait for next season!
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was amazing!!! I loved it. Just read it because I don't want to<br />Give anything away. It is a great book
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I may be sick but am most involved with the characters, not the destruction of the &#34;Walkers&#34; as they are called. The plot line keeps me coming back for more each week.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really cool game. I like how it updates you every month to a different place. You should get it
B00AXOPOD6|5.0|This is the first time I read a Jane Austen book. The language is so formidable and lovely at the same time. I was inspired to read Pride and Prejudice because of the 200th anniversary it's writing and now  I understand the reasoning behind the  long-term love by Austen  readers.
B0049M7BDE|1.0|the bluray keeps skipping through out the movies.<br />awlful!!! Waste of money. Should have went with another vendor. Don't buy
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a great game I highly recommend it it is a great spin up on a modern version temple run.
B001CEE1YE|5.0|This is nothing but just a Blu Ray trilogy. The picture is crystal clear  and sounds amazing. I own all three of these movies on DVD but I had to get them on Blu Ray because I knew how amazing it would look. A lot of people complain about how they don't have access to special features but honestly who cares about those. I don't at least. Please get this product if you love the Matrix story line.
B004LROUNG|4.0|I love anything that John Grisham writes.  This was quite interesting as it allows one to peer into the background of tort cases.  I found it quite informative in a way.  I guess the subject area was not my favorite....lacked the excitement of his other novels, but still good.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|Suspenseful  A bit slow and redundant at times. Left on the cliff ending (disappointing). Interesting enough to keep me reading throughout a weekend.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Eye-opening presentation on the state of food production and impact that corporations have on it.  A must view for all.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|this movie is just awesome. if you like anime and daft punk or vice-versa, get this and watch it again and again
B008HK3RVY|5.0|This case is perfect if you don't need a screen protector.  Most of the cases that snap onto the Kindle add a great deal of thickness.  I wouldn't suggest this for young children as they will tend to scratch and or drop while using the Kindle.  This fits great into my messenger bag, yet offers a good amount of padding and protection.<br /><br />Definitely recommend.
B0063M22QO|5.0|It is a stress-reliever for me.<br />I enjoyed the game. I don't see any options to change tile appearance but other than that good.
0763644765|5.0|We have bought other potty books that were just okay, but my daughter would never sit through the whole story.  When this book was recommended to me by a friend I was not sure if I wanted to spend more money on potty books, but finally just bought it.  I am so glad we did.  My DD loves this book!  It is very simple and straight forward.  She has memorized the entire book after only having it a few days and will insist on reading it over and over again!  I am so glad she has found a book that makes her so happy to think about using the potty hopefully really soon!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The series is so good I couldn't put the book down! It draws you in from the beginning and you can't walk away from the characters!
B0094U0RJQ|5.0|Still can write the best songs that tell a story. Not a bad tune on this album. The band is tight as always. He wont last forever so i will be looking foward to his next set of songs.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Loved the movie and the amazon instant streaming quality was really great, it didn't even stop to buffer once!<br />Would recommend this movie for kids and families and those young at heart who need a good cute laugh.<br />I will definitely be buying more movies to watch instantly from amazon as well!
B0015DYIH2|4.0|I enjoyed this book most out of the series, the story is complete and ends just as I wanted it to.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Great movie, good blu ray.  Wes Anderson's movie are unique, and this one is no exception.  If you like quirky comedies, you will like this movie, and probably other Wes Anderson films too (Darjeeling Limited, The Royal Tenembaums, Life Aquatic, etc.)
034580404X|5.0|I bought this book set a couple weeks ago, and while I still haven't gotten around to reading them just yet, I will say this seller did a very good job on making sure the item was shipped on time. The books were covered in a sealed box set, just as good as you would find it at a store.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very Good read. A little slow at times because it is the middle book. It definitely peaks your interest on what the conclusion is for Katniss Everdeen!
B0093X805W|5.0|I loved this book! It is a great book and I recommend it! It is a fantasy and is a wonderful book
B004LP3AYI|5.0|This book is amazing and that's the toasted toads truth. To the keeper with all other adventure books. This book will keep you interested and it will teach you valuable lessons  if you seek the true meaning of the words in the book. Life is one giant story... i leave you with that
B008ELUEQC|5.0|No one comes close to him I have been to every concert , except for two, in my area. He is the best.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|This was an excellent book from start to finish...I couldn't put it down.  Looking forward to another read from this author.
B000002A46|5.0|I just love the way Mariah sings the album. I am a big fan of hers; always will be.  Mary
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|Product broken! non functional! I'm very disappointed with this product! I bought this product in USA and when I tried it at my home in Brazil i saw that product is broken!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game; keeps my ten year old occupied, my six year old entertained, and even myself amused for hours! Definitely a good choice!
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is one of the best games in the world! I`v  played this game sins I was 2!<br />It's one of my most favorite games ever!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Definitely 5 stars just because it had some great tunes from the band and just is a great classic album from them. Love their music and this album was all that I wished for and more. Shipment was brief and I love the album. Would recommend to any rockers who love great music and to anyone who is into the alternative/new music scene. Great buy!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Lots of fun.  Had a hard time quitting this game.  Great storyline and it keeps you interested the whole game.  I recomming to anyone who likes adventure games.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|What a fabulous album. The XX is simply an amazing duo. The way they combine sounds and music is just crazy. A great buy, totally worth it. Was very eager to get it, so shipment took years to me, but really was a brief couple of days to great relief. Would recommend to anyone who is interested in new funky music!
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|Downloaded this one for my 4 year old granddaughter ---- she loved it!  She figured out the object of the game quickly and really loved collecting all the hearts!
034580404X|5.0|All three books were really good. The story gets your attention so easily that once you've started reading it you just can't stop reading, as you want to find out what's going to happen next. If you are much into romantic novels, this is definitely a story you don't wanna miss!
B0073LWEXK|4.0|Fun game to play.  Good animation and lots of hints and tips.  Thought it was a little too short though.
0062073559|4.0|My first experience with Agatha Christie and her novels, was through the book And Then There Were None. But then I found Death on the Nile and I instantly loved this book. It's true that Hercule Poirot does a generous amount of chair-sleuthing, but that's what we like about his character. He pompous, always right and has impeccable mustachios. I also was intrigued to read a book about a cast of people floating down the Nile, when there is a murder on board. Now it's up to Hercule to find out what happened.<br /><br />I have to say I was surprised by the identity of the murderer and why they did it.<br /><br />A thrilling read!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Typical Solitaire game.  Great when you want to kill time at the same time it was challenging and addictive.  I would recomment this to anyone who loves a solitaire challenge.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I am, for the most part, an action/adventure movie watcher.  The reviews on this show were so fantastic, though, that I had to give it a shot.  But my interest was really peaked when I saw a piece on HGTV about the history of the English country mansion where the show is filmed.  I watched the first episode of season one and I was hooked.  The characters are so compelling the story so beguiling and the interactions between all the elements so captivating that I must fight tooth and nail to stop watching after just two episodes.  This is film art at it's very best.
B008N1V11U|4.0|This game pretty much follows the story line of the dark knight rises but does change it a little due to the fact that it follows batman the whole time
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I was so looking forward to a period film with wonderful actors, spectacular costumes and lush surroundings. Instead this is a pretentious, ridiculous bit of self-indulgence on the part of its creators. Not even a stellar cast could save this movie from its idiotic design. It was very reminiscent for me of another over-rated movie I hated, 'Hugo.' No sumptuous palaces here because the actors are made to do their scenes amongst peeling paint and cobwebs in the backstage of an old theater. The dialogue was stilted and trite and the whole thing just a disaster. It's not very often that I will bail on a movie bought and paid for but 45 minutes of this was just painful. I'd like my money back. Poor Tolstoy must be rolling in his grave.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it ! I play subway surfers everyday!!!  The creators of this games should make many more games like this, but in my opinion this game is the best game I ever played on a mobile device :)!!
B00AGKHEUI|5.0|For a huge fan, this is a must have. Sounds great, especially for those of us who listened to the album so much in the 70s that it eventually sounded pretty bad. So glad I purchased this!
B009T3AE1Y|2.0|Let me state upfront that I am generally a big fan of Canadian director David Cronenberg, even though his movies are hits and misses, but even in the misses, Cronenberg seems to bring a unique persepctive.<br /><br />\\"Cosmopolis\\" (2012 release; 109 min.) brings the story of Eric Packer (played by Robert Pattison), a 28 yr. old financial Wall Street whiz kid who uses his stretch limousine pretty much as his office, and we see the limo driving in New York towards his barber as Packer needs to get a haircut. Several events intervene, and that is when things starts to unravel, seemingly without sense or purpose.<br /><br />Several comments: to tell you that I am bewildred, and disappointed, by this movie, would be an understatement. Characters come and go, and it's hard to understand why. Juliette Binoche, who gets 2nd star lining in the movie just below Pattison, appears out of nowhere having sex with Packer in the limo and is in the movie for all of about 10 min. or so. Then there are the improbable, at times laughable lines. Such as Packer saying \\"My prostate is asymmetrical\\" to a woman, who responds \\"What does that mean?\\" and Packer responding \\"I don't know\\". And then later on Benni (played by Paul Giamatti) exclaiming \\"I have my syndromes, you have your complexes. You did it to yourself!\\", and on and on. On a minor plus side, the movie does feature a couple of songs from fellow Canadian indie-band Metric. If you wonder why I watched the movie to the end, all I can offer is that I was hoping it would get better and I was on a 15 hr. trans-pacific flight and simply killing time. Bottom line, as much as I like David Cronenberg and wanted to like this movie, I cannot recommend this movie, sorry.

B0040N5364|4.0|I've had  The Smiths first Best Of album for many years and recently started listening to Morrissey's solo work, but it was only recently I heard some of the songs on this album.  I was blown away by Marr's guitar work on &#34;The Headmaster Ritual&#34; and Rourke's bass on &#34;Barbarism Begins at Home&#34;.  &#34;How Soon is Now&#34; is a well-known classic, and &#34;Rusholme Ruffians&#34; is infectious.

Now he's anxiously awaiting an event when I might get him the 3rd book. Great story and a terrific companion to the tv series, according to my son.

B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is absolutely amazing. The only things I would change would be to add more diseases (can't get enough of this game), make some symptoms that are only available in certain diseases (there are no difference in symptoms at all except for the worm!) and make the cheats available in game. It's so lame that you can't get an unlimited point specific disease. It's stupid if you lose the special traits of the diseases. It's not a cheat if it doesn't affect the game. What you have right now are SANDBOX MODES. So please rename them or let them be used in game! Other than that, best game I've played on the kindle!
B000JML90Y|5.0|This is the classic Origin of the Species work.  I haven't read ityet, but for the price &#34;free&#34; you can't go wrong.  I was curious as to the writing style, etc, so I downloaded it.  Plan to read to make me a better person. :)

B0018QQQK8|4.0|This typical Sparks love story is light, easy and enjoyable to read.  I continue to enjoy his characters and the clear yet romantic way he writes.
B00797MB0O|5.0|I would highly recommend this movie - it's thought-provoking, biting, and clever. I really enjoyed it, and if you're into satire, you'll enjoy it.<br /><br />-- tiny spoilers, I suppose! --<br /><br />Charlize Theron plays the Young Adult, Mavis, who is perfectly imperfect, and, in true Queen Bee fashion, has decided that now that her ex is unequivocally taken, she has to get him. The movie is a fun romp as she sets out for this task, and learns, well... Nothing.<br /><br />I rolled my eyes when I saw that a Twilight babe was cast as the ex's wife, but she surprised me with her acting chops! Everyone was cast well in this dark comedy, and it was thoroughly enjoyable!<br /><br />If you don't like tongue-in-cheek movies, you probably won't love this, but if you're someone that enjoys offbeat story lines and the quintessential antiheroes, you'll enjoy.<br /><br />Yet again, proving that indies are the place to be for the time being (until mainstream gets it mojo!).

B007SGM084|5.0|Reading this book you get caught up in the sex scene, but the story line is also great and keeps you reading to do find out what's going to happen next. Loved it from the first page to the very end. Ms. James did a fantastic job with this book.
B008VVT51U|1.0|After recently reading the book, and seeing that a movie had been made from it, I was very excited to see it. What a disappointment!! This movie barely follows the story line of the original, and in fact, appears to be a story from some other book - maybe \\"Life in India for Westerners who are old.\\" Even if I hadn't read the book, I found that the two hours this movie spent to tell the tale was weak and left many ends untied - as one other Amazon reviewer pointed out, \\"how they got hooked into going to the hotel was all very fuzzy. Suddenly they are all together on a plane for India\\". If I was the author of this book, I'd be rather upset with the guy who wrote the screenplay. What was he thinking?? Terrible.
B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|This is a fun app if you love the old Atari games.  So many of these games are true classics.  And this is a superb value for 100 games for only $9.99.
B0024FADAQ|5.0|1982 was a great year for sic-fi effects. Filmmakers were experimenting what would become the most useful special-efffects technique in modern cinematics: CGI. (I know there are variable opinions on CGI, but only a great dunce would argue that they are comparatively cheap, convenient, and effective.)<br /><br />At then tender age of twelve, I was blown away by this film. (I was ten when the movie came out, but didn't see it until a few years later when it came out on VHS.) At the jaded age of 41, I still remember the magic, even if I can &#34;see the strings&#34; of the early-days techniques.<br /><br />The story is a little derivative, but is a ton of fun. The actors seem to enjoy their parts, and, come on, Robert Preston! How can a cast with Robert Preston go wrong? Additionally, while the story does primarily follow the protagonist, I think it spends adequate time moving around in the story to sufficiently keep the audience informed about the context (cutaways to THE FRONTIER, just enough attention to lifestyle on Rylos and among the Kodan, etc.)<br /><br />If there's anything wrong with the story, I'd say it's the stupidity of Xur and the Kodan Armada. But most of the film is, of necessity, given to developing the character of Alex Rogan (Guest).<br /><br />Look, it ain't Star Wars, but it's great entertainment. While perhaps not as fulfilling in the long run as Lucas' early offerings (I refuse to comment on the latter ones), it was for me a lot more fun at the time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game. The world's are cool. The people are great. It is a fun game. Sometimes it is funny. I LOVE THE GGGGGGGAAAAAAAMMMMMMMEEEEEEE.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Amazing Read. Highly Recommend. I look forward to more stories from mr. Howey in the future. What a masterful sci fi universe he has created.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|Excellent read. Another Grisham at his best. Keeps you in suspense all the way through to the end. Not one dull moment.

B000002TYX|4.0|There are many jewels in the rough in this 2 disc set. And many interesting takes on familiar and unfailiar songs that are catchy and ingenious often.<br />The earliest cuts understandably are the rawest in terms of sound quality and facility.

B000007MVD|5.0|This two disc set of tracks recorded when they were already the leading pop group in the UK are informal and have good sound quality.<br />Most of the songs are familiar, but some of them are sung in interesting unfamiliar versions. A number were never sung in any version on their albums. A few were given over to other groups and became hits. The notes do a good job telling you the origin of each song and which titles were included on which albums, but the lead singer isn't alway identified.<br />The harmonies are already very sophisticated and presage the evolution that was to come.
B0030MKGKY|5.0|I gave this movie five stars because it deserved five stars. There were few weak points in the movie. No unnecessary plot twists or deification. No political agendas. It was just a really good story about a man who found his life calling on the battlefield during wartime. J. Renner does an outstanding job in the role as no one else could have given a more real performance. Very intelligent military movie that delivers a more real approach to day-to-day battle than most others in the genre.  It could have used more traditional military themes, nevertheless, it definitely has a place on the virtual shelf for the $6. ;)
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This can be a great game &amp; would have given 5 stars... but it rarely opens on my Kindle Fire. It also slows down to a frame by frame slo-mo speed which can be frustrating when trying to use certain features.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Simply haunting and beautiful, if you don't enjoy musicals- don't see, and certainly don't give a review.  People gave the film a one? Wow!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game has just the perfect amount of graphics and minimalist music. It's rewarding, thought provoking, and the levels are quick and easy to play in five minutes or less.
0143117009|5.0|Diamond yet again presents an interesting read, and the message has vast implications for the future of the human race.<br /><br />To make a long story short, basically people weren't forward thinking with their environment (chopped down too many trees, over-fished / over-hunted) and exhausted all their resources by increasing their population at an unsustainable rate. Then, they eventually all died.<br /><br />It almost sounds ridiculous to believe that people were dumb enough to do that. But they were, and Diamond tells us exactly what went wrong with each specific society. To ensure this planet is lived on / maintained sustainably, this book should be required reading in high school for all future generations.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I just finished watching this movie and it was great. The whole story line was put together superbly as well as the acting. Great movie!
B0095VPBFY|5.0|I needed a processor fast enough for a home fileserver which would be headless most of the time.

B00BESNKB8|2.0|I don't have too much to say about this movie except that it was lackluster. I expected more from a Tarantino promoted film.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|It was awesome in the end everyone shod read this series because it rocks. If you don't read this life is not complete
B00A0SJWQU|3.0|This movie has a lot of action in it but at the end of the movie the viewer is left with a feeling of emptiness.

B009GX69RK|5.0|Hilarious show! From Schmit's flamboyant metro ways to Nick's moody brooding to Jess' denial that things are unsavory its just a great show!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|Bravo!  Superb acting by Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson and the rest of the cast for that matter, in a captivating story of a time off in the not too distant future when each year a boy and girl from each of 12 districts, forming what used to be the USA, must fight to the death - with only one victor - in &#34;tribute&#34; for their great grandparents crime of trying to overthrow an oppressive government.  The movie follows refreshingly and very very close to the original books of the same name.  Worth watching over and over just to enjoy Lawrence, probably one of the most gifted actresses to come along in eons.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|This is a rare find.An oldie but a goodie! It is funny and exciting all at the same time.Roman Polanski is award and niave.His character,I mean.If you like this kind of movie I highly recommend it.

B001ANSSDC|4.0|This was a great story. I had a hard time putting it down. It was unpredictable and realistic. I recommend this read.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Love it, most of the offers are bogus though. Super slow to start. But after it moves at a decent pace.
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like the game and would like to play but  time doesn't seem to move after eight hours  hours I only got ten more energy.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Don't start watching this series unless you have a free weekend, because you may want to have a marathon viewing.  This is one of the most addictive series I have viewed.<br /><br />The premise is great: Francis Underwood (Kevin Spacey) is promised the Secretary of State position in thanks for helping to get a new president elected.  Once elected, the new president conveniently changes his mind and doesn't even bother to meet with Underwood to tell him.  He lets his chief of staff notify Underwood he has been passed over, and asks for his continued support of the president in the Congress as Majority Whip.  Underwood promises his support, but lets us, the audience, know differently.<br /><br />Now the fun begins.  The joy of this series is seeing how Underwood continually outwits and outmaneuvers other politicians who seem just as integrity-challenged as him, but less bright.  And because Underwood has been skewered by the Prez and his team, you really don't mind when Underwood acts in a Machiavellian manner to get the better of them.<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is mesmeric as Frank Underwood.  The casting is superb.  The dialogue is intelligent and inspired.  You can't wait to see what schemes Underwood has concocted each episode and how they are going to play out.  If this series is fairly true to life, no wonder our government is in the mess it is in right now.<br /><br />Hope Netflix continues to create original, quality drama such as this show.  HOUSE OF CARDS is only going to increase in popularity as more people watch it. Looking forward to season 2 of this series.

B00A757EFW|1.0|The game was playing fine and I was enjoying it when the screen faded dark and I saw that I would to buy the game to play long.<br />So long!
B009GIPDQS|5.0|It's quite a good read. As always with John Grisham, its quite well written. Go ahead and buy it already.
B009GEEMLY|1.0|There is a problem with prime and it just isnt as good as Netflix.  The movie woukd stop and kick us out then we would have to start the movie over.  When it was working the picture was great.  His was a pain and not worth the money.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It's ok if you like the Harlequin Romance novels and want to read detailed sex parts. It lacks substance for me. The female character is wimpy and shallow. The male character is also wimpy and shallow, so I guess they make for a good match. None of the story line is plausible. IE: The female is a virgin at 23 yrs old (ok, that is plausible), she has an orgasm on her FIRST encounter with a man - NOT plausible. He's ooglely rich - yawn. He asks her to marry him after knowing her 3-1/2 weeks??? Really??? OK, this is being nit-picky even to me, but when they go to a SAAB dealership to buy a car, the writer portrays the salesman as being the &#34;typical slimy salesman&#34;. In reality if you go to a SAAB/BMW/Lexus dealer, they are top notch salesmen that don't hassle you like say, Pontiac dealers. It's a totally different class of people they are selling cars to so it clearly shows the writer didn't do any background work/research. Writers should write about what they know. So bottom line is if you are interested in a light read that is circled around sex, then this is your book. If you like reading stories with depth, skip it!

B006Q2LTRO|5.0|I first rented this book from the library. I got into it and because it had such good information in it, I decided to buy my own copy. If you are serious about making your relationship work, then I suggest investing in a copy. Some may not like it because of certain reasons, but I believe it helped me personally to understand my better half more. Each individual is different and responds differently as Dr. Chapmen reminds us throughout the book.

B003WUYRGI|5.0|The Oxford English dictionary was my first book loaded onto my Kindle Fire HD 8.9\\" TABLET. It was quite simple to download and install. But then,...<br /><br />I appreciated the accessibility to the settings. I have very poor vision, making the ability to change the font size as well as the borders a real blessing. You can even select font color, making this app a great number one for my Kindle Library. I highly recommended The Oxford English Dictionary for any KINDLE FIRE HD owner.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best because it lets you see the world from different sides and it gives you a chance to battle your friends.I also like this game because it helps you understand challenges and money. Also it gives you action,the longer you go the faster your character goes. Anyone can play subway surfers, I have a little sister that plays it all the time!!!!! I do encourage you to buy this game and have fun playing your ride around the world!!!!!!!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Well, this app is good. But I don't like the assistance. Some movements are incorrect, and most chess cheats don't work. The only one is castleing. Otherwise great app.
B0093FNZT6|3.0|Obviously a life changing experience. Three stars because it started with promise to be an exciting read but then became a bit laboured in the telling.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Good season, not as good as the first season tho. I would recommend watching tho if your into the stories of American Horror story, didn't take me long to watch either. a few hours and I was done watching. I will be looking forward to season 3.

0345525558|3.0|Communication can take many different forms. In the case of Victoria Jones, having been shunted around multiple foster homes as a small child and then growing up in group homes until she is 18, she distrusts everyone and believes herself unable to form long lasting relationships with people. But she develops a connection to plants and flowers, discovering a secret language in each plant and flower that helps her communicate with and help others.<br /><br />But as she finds safety and comfort among her flowers, and even grows bold enough to open her heart to another, an unexpected situation causes her to flee once more. Alternating between her past and present, the author builds the background into a dark secret that Victoria's been hiding since she was a child. Will this secret be the cause of her downfall or can she find a way to reach out for what she wants and to face possible rejection all over again?

This is a masterfully written, easy to read, and highly thought-provoking book that should become required reading for anyone who needs to think about the future and make predictions about where things are going.  Thank you, Nate Silver!
B00A757EFW|4.0|I only wish I could have found Ms. Pacman. I do enjoy playing this, but without a joystick, I tend to fumble a lot & get eaten. :(<br /><br />Pros: Hey! It's a Pacman!<br />Cons: I'm just not very good at it

B003EYVXTG|4.0|Jennifer Lawrence did a beautiful job of portraying the girl shouldering so much responsibility on her young shoulders. It was a good, heartfelt story.
0525953728|4.0|A first rate read about a mission that ranks with the liberation of 500 US POW's from the Japanese prison camp at<br />Cabanatuan on the Philappine Island of Luzon by the US Army 6th Ranger Battalion in January, 1945.<br /><br />The author gives the reader a glimpse of why he chose to be a SEAL, the intensive, demanding and ongoing training for<br />all missions including this most important mission, and the camaraderie that develops among warriors.  Strong language<br />occasionally and humor regarding the \\"hair missile\\" and \\"the good idea fairy\\".<br /><br /> I gained knowledge about the sacrifices these men make to protect us and how fortunate we are that they exist.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The writing lacks in some places, yet I found it irresistible to keep reading. Great spring break beach reading...
B005KDDUVS|5.0|My daughter recommended this book when she found out that I was going to visit Barcelona.  As I started to read it I was grabbed not only by the intriguing plot and extraordinary characters, but also by the beautiful Spanish language that Mr. Zafon uses.  I delighted in his sentences and paragraphs.  It is one of those books where one feels sad when it ends.  I was able to continue enjoying Mr. Zafon's literature by reading El Juego del Angel (The Angel's Game) and will soon be reading the next book in the cycle: El Prisionero del Cielo (The Prisoner of Heaven).

B004UID2LC|5.0|Very happy with this App. Downloaded 1hr 36 min. BW Movie in about 2 minutes. Color Movies might take 4-5 minutes. YouTube Videos in just seconds. Play them back on MXPlayer or even play back on Google Movies and TV App. Both are awesome where you can change screen size and other things. What is great I have a micro to HDMI cable (15 feet) right to my HDTV and can watch anything I wish from my Google Nexus 10 Tablet (32Gb). The YouTube Downloader is great for when you are on the go and away from home with no wifi connection you just pop up the downloaded movies/ YouTube Videos and you are set.

B004MC0FO8|5.0|Played some of the music channels on my HDTV starting with some current songs. It didn't miss a beat. Then tried some oldies and again didn't miss a song and most of the time 3-5 seconds it had the correct title. Then put on some of the older Swing songs and again got them correct. Just one of many great apps for your Android Tablet (I have a Nexus 10, 32Gb).

B005KJJ4F8|5.0|This book is just shy of the best book I have ever read.  It didn`t take awhile to pick up the plot or drag out the ending.  It was a serious cliff hanger making me want the sequel Scarlet ASAP.  This book is a mus read from sixth graders like me through adult.  LOVED IT SO MUCH
B007PT1PEY|4.0|thank you for this wonderful gift. This will make a great and wonderful gift family/ friend enjoyed and will enjoy watching
B0068FZ1C8|5.0|I find this a really engaging film that I can watch frequently.  The photography and direction are excellent.  How the film is directed is important for me as I have some trouble with the heavy dialect used by the actors: the ample flash backs and flash asides (simultaneous action) help a lot in following the plot particularly when the actors drop their voices while still speaking in heavy dialect. (This seems to be a characteristic of many British films)<br />Some reviewer I've read calls it (the whole story)  &#34;funny.&#34;  I tend to disagree.  There are certainly many scenes which are downright  funny. The action overall is handled with a very light, easily watched spirit - only one brief scene approaches intense drama.  BUT, to see the whole story as &#34;funny&#34; seems to me to require little empathy for a boy who is fighting his father, as Billy is.<br />According to the jacket notes, the only actor/actress nominated for an Academy Award was the dance teacher  -(Julie  Walters ?).  Personally, I think the actor playing Billy (Jamie Bell) is equally excellent;  a side feature on the Blue Ray includes an interview with Bell which shows a boy very different from the Billy  he plays - he really is a fine actor.
1452101426|5.0|I went into &#34;Brave&#34; fairly skeptical.  It didn't look like the kind of movie I would normally watch, but then it was made by Pixar so that made me curious.  Then, my teenage son saw it with a friend and said he thought I would enjoy it.  I went, and he was right!<br /><br />The visuals in the movie are stunning and the story is fantastic.  As a family, we all appreciated the message about listening to each other.<br /><br />This book, then, is a wonderful companion as it shows the artwork of the movie and the pre-production artwork that was developed over the years that it took to make the movie.  As a wanna-be artist myself, I like books like this anyway, but I especially appreciated how this book showed the interaction of how the art and the characters progressed.  Characters grew and then the art would change accordingly, or the art would change and the character would grow to match.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was just as good the second time I read as it was the first time. It keeps you guessing the whole time. The direction keeps changing and the ending totally catches your off guard.
0307950654|2.0|I almost gave this book 3 stars because, though it was nearly impossible to get into initially, it eventually got into somewhat of a graspable flow. Not to mention, I feel compelled to support senior writers like PD James. I can barely look at her author picture without feeling guilty about my 2-star review. So classy, grandma-sweet looking! But given the fact that money doesn't grow on trees, I dropped it to two stars. Those with tight purse strings should be forwarned that they may very well be disappointed if they think they will be getting great Jane Austen bang for their buck. They won't. Truly, so sorry. It doesn't mean that her next book won't be great! [[ASIN:0983121001 BIANCA'S VINEYARD]]
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|This book is very much in the vein of Harry Potter, though it's a little darker and more mysterious.  It starts when the main character is 16, which allows the author to get into the darker tone of the materials a lot faster.  I love the weirdness and the mystery of the story and can't wait for the next book!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. And its nice that the scenery changes once in a while. My only comlaint is that it doesn't have more obstacles.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|The follow up to &#34;Bared to You&#34; is still an entertaining read.  If you're looking for some light romance reading, don't waste your time on the &#34;50 Shades of Grey&#34; series, unless you like reading &#34;oh my!&#34; 96 times (in George Takei's voice in my head).  Read this series instead.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great time-killer, it's persistent in posting on Facebook however. I loved it, once you get the hang of it, you'll like it.
B00846REIS|4.0|Bared to You is a much, much better written &#34;50 Shades of Grey&#34; - it engages in all of the standard romance novel cliches, but it's still an entertaining read.  If you're looking for some light romance reading, don't waste your time on 50, unless you like reading &#34;oh my!&#34; 96 times (in George Takei's voice in my head).  Read this series instead.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This CD has a wonderful mixture of electric and fiddle music. Great for dancing! I have listened to others like this but have never loved one so fully. Every song has found a place in my heart. I can listen to the whole CD without skipping any. I definitely recommend this CD.
B00A1XIXM8|4.0|It is not my favorite album by Bad Religion but it still rocks and I enjoy it. There are some great songs.<br /><br />If you are a Bad Religion fan just buy it. If you are not a Bad Religion fan.. uh sorry?<br /><br />The easiest thing to do is say ..
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|I only continued reading this book because friends encouraged me to and it did get a little better but very predictable.  If I were in Jr. High School I may have liked it better.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome lived it so much better than temple run like the fact that u go through the mines and swing on vines
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|This is surprisingly fun although it seems like a game just for kids, all ages could enjoy!<br /> Worth the download!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|Interesting to look at, and informative. I'm glad I installed it. It's impressive to look at against the dark background.
B005NPCJ88|5.0|I'm not normally a fan of any screaming or growling, but I am a big fan of this album.  I got this CD for someone else, but while listening, I ended up liking it a lot more than he actually did.  The thing I like about this, is that it has the great instrumentals that heavier music tends to have, but even though the singer growls or screams, his voice remains easy to understand, unlike a lot of the other &#34;core&#34; / &#34;death&#34; type genre vocals.  Don't buy this album if you're not a fan of double-bass drums though, this has them on virtually every track.  Sometimes they feel unnecessary but I like the sound of them so I don't mind.
B000063S6Z|5.0|I have been searching for this particular CD for a long time and it for some reason was not available in the stores.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|I knew a couple of Stone Sour's old songs, but wasn't really a fan (I mean that I am neutral, not disliking of them), never heard an album, just what I heard on the radio.  Amazon recommended this and I liked Gone Sovereign / Absolute Zero (which I heard on Octane on satellite radio), so I decided to buy it.  I sure am glad that I took a chance with this though because it's honestly one of the best albums I've ever heard.  It's one of those rare albums that doesn't actually have any weak tracks, they're all great.  The album has great flow as well, I usually listen to most music on shuffle or random, but this one I leave it sequential because the tracks go so well from one to the next.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game I have ever played!!! Very addictive and fun! Good for adult and children!! I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!! Xx
B000002GA8|5.0|No comment, hate being forced to do something like this ... and then to have a minimum number of words!!! .... just take the rating or don't ask!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the game it is great to play in the car and entertains kids greatly I just wish the eggs were easier to reach children really have trouble with that it's a total rip off
B00846TRHY|3.0|If I hadn't already read about this man and what he had done, I would have turned the movie off in the first five minutes.  The sex scene was totally inappropriate and detracted from the courageous story of what this man did for the horribly traumatized children in Sudan.  I think more people would have been enticed to watch this movie if not for the &#34;R&#34; rating, and graphic way they chose to portray his former life.  It does show what the power of God can do to change a life and the difference one determined individual can make in this world.  I'm sure hundreds, if not thousands of children in Sudan owe their lives to this man.  It's too bad, the beginning of the movie very likely turned some away from hearing this incredible story.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|This young man is an incredible talent! It's hard to describe his music because it is so versatile and borrows from so many genres...The best part is that it's ALL Good!
B00195BM3Y|5.0|This band leaves you wanting more and more. Beautiful melodic voice and music.<br />All their songs are infectious. One of the best bands in the universe.
B0016OOM7Q|1.0|I received my Madonna record in December, and I finally got a record player this week. I was so excited to listen to it, 'Hard Candy' is my favorite Madonna album. I sat down to listen to the record and it started skipping.....I thought it was my record player because the record itself looked beautiful. So I grabbed an old record (also Madonna) and put it on. It sounded perfect! Then I realized that it had to be the record itself. Every record from the album and every side was scratched. The song would play then go ahead 20 seconds. I was and still am so disappointed. I will never buy from this seller again. Guess I have to spend another $30 to buy this record.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|I'm going to tell it to you straight: This book is uncomfortable to read.<br /><br />Well written? Yup.<br />Absorbing? Absolutely.<br />But no holds barred, 100% depressing.<br /><br />You see, once the story gets started, we meet the main character, Leo Demidov. Leo is a terrifyingly efficient war hero in Stalin's Soviet Russia that's banked his life and the life of his family on keeping his head down and his eyes closed to the atrocities that surround, and have greatly influenced, his everyday life. But when confronted with the real cost of this lifestyle, and circumstances start turning against him, Leo is finally pushed to action.<br /><br />While all that might seem like it would add up to an inspirational read, the book sticks so close to reality that there isn't any room for much more than small, meaningful gestures between individuals. In fact, it's the courageous things that people do for one another - regardless of income, neighborhood or family ties... essentially the base humanity of it all - that makes this novel's message potently clear.<br /><br />The Bottom Line: Part mystery novel, part historical fiction and part cautionary tale, 'Child 44' by Tom Rob Smith is worth everyone's time. In fact, part of me believes books like this should be required reading for all humanities students as tales like this one serve as stark reminders of what can happen if we forget ourselves.
B002ZTIILC|5.0|a really great album, i love just about every song on it. i couldnt stop listening to it for the longest time
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|great easy game. I would buy more games like this. fun game for all ages. have fun playing this great game.
B0086700CM|5.0|Makes good use of the limited play action available on cell phones. Very addictive game to play and loads of fun.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|But not quite the same blockbuster as the first album. The first album had several songs with great &#34;hooks;&#34; this one not so much.
B00594XOZU|5.0|I use this for group chats and to talk to people I know from Twitter and Instagram.  I would recommend to anyone who doesn't want to give out phone number.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|There is a reason this guy won American Idol, although it wasn't terribly clear at the time. &#34;Home&#34; is being used by three different national advertisers at the same time -- a record, as far as I know.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Not your typical YA novel. Green packs metaphors and symbolism in places that really give the book depth to keep any reader engaged. At times I feel this can go over the reader's head and can make the book seem a little heavy handed. However, the book's miraculous flow will keep even an unassigned reader engaged. Even though at some points you can feel Green talking to the reader, he does use an excellent voice for Hazel. A great for young adult and fans of young adult fiction.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|Found this album last summer -- loved it immediately and even my stodgy husband likes it. The lead singer stated that they'd been playing together for years, but they must have just come up with this great sound that reminds me of Queen.
B004VB3V0K|4.0|I browsed this in preview mode a couple of times and was a bit put off by the &#34;Y-gen&#34; language and - ahem - the pictures. Eventually I bought it and so far I like what I have seen. Despite the cheapo surface, the author seems to be knowledgeable and is not just repeating the worn-out examples.
B002VLNB1Q|5.0|Good tunes, not his best album,... but very good. I think that he is an under-rated, and under appreciated guitarist.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It is great and as the same as I have on my phone,and I really been able to do anything with it and get info from all of the places in the U.S.where I have family. And can stay on top of the weather no matter if it on my tablet,phone and also was able to get others in family and Our Church. So I love it
B005FISBTO|5.0|Just when you think this show can't top itself it does!! Love love love it!!! I can't wait to get next season!!!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I love all of Jack Reacher books that I have read.  They keep me on the edge of my seat, and give me a great escape from reality, which is why I read books!  They never let me down!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|AMAZING AND FREE  to download I rate 5 stars my name is telayna davis on Facebook add me:) white background with zebra hearts and purple
B005COO1X6|4.0|Classic Stephen King love the insight from a preteen point of view. Twilight zone  like Under the Dome or It
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I enjoyed this from cover to cover.<br />I had one little quibble with the science (which was easy to forgive), but apart from that it was a convincing, gripping, edge-of-the-seat adventure that had me reading until late in the night.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I totally agree that you play the game. It is very fun and it kept me having fun all day.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Literally a real page turner. Great twists and leaves you wanting to not put the book down until you know what happened. I will admit the ending was a little disappointing, however that would not stop me from offering a most positive review.
0316789798|5.0|My kids LOVE this book.  They are ages 5-8.  This book has showed them how simple shapes paired with their imagination can help them draw all sorts of animals.  The books shows the progression of how to draw the animals in simple self-explanatory steps.  My kids have not been frustrated by it and have in fact come up with quite a few of their own creations.  The book also has some character and is entertaining in places with the descriptions.  Would make a great gift for your kids or as a gift.  I always love something kids can learn from and get them away from video games and the like.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I love this book. I felt every emotion along with the characters. I really did not want it to end!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  Two broken people \\"living\\" each other. Plot twists and turns fully fleshed out. I wish six would've been a little more involved as the storyline got more complicated. Boy is she gonna be PISSED when she gets back! Lol!!!
B0055Q5F36|1.0|I should have read ALL of the reviews before I bought it. It is too small and doesn't fit My Galaxy S2 I tore the rubber trying to fit it in the outer shell.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's refreshing that the book didn't suddenly jump to an end like so many do. Scott the time I worried that it was going to, I was only about 50% through the book. A love story nearly as old as time has prevailed and it's sweet beauty is one that threatened to bring tears to my eyes.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This book lacked the crispness and excitement of the first book in the trilogy.  On occasion it seemed a bit contrived and trite.  My overall impression is good and I will still look forward to the final book.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Without giving all away, that is the best way to describe the second book. It's filled with deception, plans, and fewer enemies than expected. As Haymitch says, in paraphrasing, \\"remember who the enemy is.\\" Through the Quell, it is hard to do but this second book is just as captivating as the first was and let's the reader see into the depth of each character.
B003JTHXOK|3.0|There is enough suspense to get the reader past the predictable elements.  It is a little hard to see how a woman who could be so thoroughly subjugated could know how to do such a great job of recreating herself.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|This has a lot of music and the songs are soothing. I love her voice. I have been listening to her for years.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I honestly bought this book based on the cover and the good reviews. I had no idea what it was about. I loved it! It was so wonderfully written, and despite its sad contents, I finished the book feeling happy. A wonderful read!
B00280LYHS|5.0|Great book, on to the next books in the line, hope the movies live up to the books adventures, and keep with the story.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This wonderful book takes the reader into a world that was very different from today, a world of contradictions and ethical and moral dilemmas.  The characters come to life and the plot has twists that make it hard to put the book down.  I enjoyed this very much.
B009NX409M|4.0|an enjoyable movie, great acting,  and a great ending<br />basic feel good chick flick,  and here's for the mid life crises.
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Ian Mcewan is generally a writer whose works I enjoy.  Although this book is well written, it did not have a great climax or denouement.  I kept waiting for something g more to happen, and did not really like the ending.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Love this headset. Absolutely fantastic sound and a great mic. Only downside, batteries do go fast so i started using rechargeable ones.
B008IJTFYW|2.0|it isn't playing while I use other apps. If i can figure out how to use relax melodies while reading, I 'd like that very much.
B007ZD17XO|3.0|Maybe I'm spoiled by Mumbo Jumbo's &#34;7 Wonders&#34; as my first purchase that actually gives you a fighting chance, but this App drove me crazy. Bang, zoom, time is up, before I even had a handle of the layout on the page. Not a game for the player who likes strategy - more for those with a short attention span.
B004LWZVZC|5.0|Great story!  Very sad.  Seems government never changes.  :-(  not sure what was worse, assassination of a great President or the blind manipulation of its citizens by government officials.....
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The plot reminded me of the Julia Roberts movie, but Mr. Sparks has added lots of strong twists, and memorable characters. I loved it!!
B008K6DU4Y|3.0|Initially got this app for my Kindle fire HD, and Regular Kindle fire- I have this for my regular Samsung MP3 device and I love it there, but when trying to open in any of my Kindle devices they crash, I hope the maker is able to review the app and work out the kinks.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|This was a nice change of pace after reading several books that didn't get my attention.  There was some events in the story that we predictable but many more that caught me by surprise.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game.  It is so addictive.  I played so long that I ran out of buttons toplay, so I had to wait a few days to play again as a &#34;guest&#34;.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|To play any MMO this is a must have. Makes the game enjoyable. No more finger acrobatics trying to hit the right ability at the right moment on a crowded keyboard. The thumbstick becomes second nature. I thought I would just ignore it. I only wanted the mappable keys. But once I started using it I started really enjoying the extra mobility. Setting one of the side keys near it for tab targeting makes it even better.<br /><br />I don't use the programmable functions as much as I thought I would. My main MMO has a good macro system. When I played SWTOR for a while (no macros) I did use a few scripts for it. The basic scripting interface was simple. The deeper scripting was not and it was hard to find any examples or support for how to use it.<br /><br />I have one in a box on a shelf just in case this one dies and they stop making them.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This series has taken me totally through their journey with them! The love and bond between Gideon and Eva is just enchanting!  Can't wait for the next book.
B000A0GP4K|4.0|If you call yourself a Bob Dylan fan and you haven't seen this, you aren't a hardcore fan. This is made for his true fans
B0040ZPLBY|5.0|I hope directors, producers etc \\"get the message\\" -- this is an example of great story telling without the sex, foul language, etc that is so common .. Merlin just focuses on an excellent plot and character development. I have seen all seasons available thus far and can't wait for new episodes -- Well done to the writers and cast !!!
B00005JM1F|4.0|This is in no way a classic comedy like Airplane!, but it is still quite fun and quotable. Just turn your brain off and have fun
B007REV4T8|4.0|There was something lacking in the James Bond reincarnation starring Daniel Craig before. It started in Casino Royale when Bond orders his drink. &#34;Shaken or stirred?&#34; asked the bartender, and Craig looked at him with stern eyes and replied, &#34;Do I look like I give a damn?&#34; While Casino Royale was a great action film and put Craig on the map in a huge way, as a Bond film it didn't measure up.<br /><br />Fast forward past Quantum of Solace, a disappointment all around involving Bond skirting the border between agent and rogue to fulfill a personal mission with a weak payoff, and we find ourselves at Skyfall, the Bond film that almost wasn't, this is easily the best of Craig's Bond films to date, and the peices fall into place to form a more traditional James Bond moving forward.<br /><br />After being presumed dead, James Bond returns to MI6 rusty and injured after M (played by the ever-capable Judi Dench) receives a cyber threat and witnesses the MI6 buidling explode. With assistance from Q (finally making his debut in the Craig films, played by Ben Whishaw) and Eve (the lovely Naomie Harris), Bond must track down and apprehend a psychopath with a missing upper jaw who has sworn revenge against M.<br /><br />At the end of the film, I was clamoring for more. As long as they can stop making terrible video games, I see no end to the Bond franchise, and Mr. Craig has a long future ahead of him if he can keep improving on his performance as Bond.
B00003CWOL|4.0|Much like &#34;Chasing Amy&#34;, this is not your typical Kevin Smith movie. While it is satirical, it has a religious side to it. While it is not ham-fisted, it is still obvious. Salma Hayek is a huge miscast. She has no clue what is is saying in the movie. The poo monster is a bit weird too, but it is not a bad movie, just not a classic
B001P9EQH8|5.0|Great battery life, charges fast, did improve the sound and for the price I haven't seen a better alternative yet, build quality is good for the price too.
B0000VD04M|5.0|This movie might come across as a parody, but it is actually a labor of love. Depp and Burton don't mock Ed Wood, they show their love for him.<br /><br />When Depp and Burton hit gold, they hit a goldmine
B001OFJPIS|4.0|Freaking epic.  This one is so much better then the first one :)<br />but that could just be  my opinion.
B001EXE2ZG|5.0|This is absolutely one of my favorite movies ever made. It might get parodied a bit, but it is very good. Billy Wilder can make a great movie
B001ILFUD2|4.0|Gotta love you're classic Disney :)<br />I know I do. Gotta say I'm really glad these keep coming out as I'd hate to have to keep those bulky VHS tapes.
B000R8YC18|5.0|While DeNiro might be ruining his legacy with movies that do not deserve even the mention of his name  (&#34;Silver Linings Playbook&#34; is an exception and maybe a sign of good to come). We have movies like this to remind us why he terrified us and why we thought and knew he was a masterful talent
B001O5LVPI|4.0|Finally i have my own copy. I've been waiting to splurge on this little sucker for awhile! Now i had the money and decided I'd go a little crazy and get this for myself.
6305508550|4.0|This movie is a great send up of the workplace. &#34;Horrible Bosses&#34; might be the best example of a similar movie. If you've seen &#34;Beavis and Butt-Head&#34; &#34;King of the Hill&#34; and &#34;Idiocracy&#34;, you'll be shocked that he made this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers. It is so entertaining. I have to say, it's so much better than most coin collecting game. I strongly Recommend it.
B0006ZXTRU|5.0|This is quite possibly the best sports movie ever made. The depths and dark waters this movies dive into could have been disastrous in the wrong hands, but in the hands of Scorsese and DeNiro, the movie isn't afraid to show Jake LaMotta as the monster he was, but it never feels damning.<br /><br />Credit to Paul Schrader (writer of &#34;Taxi Driver&#34;) for the portrait
B0053TMP24|5.0|The storyline is awesome. I love it. I can't wait to read the next book.😀😀😀😀 After Mark of Athena what will be the next books name?
B00005JKJA|4.0|I'm not exactly sure what happened in this movie, but I loved the ride. David Lynch can make a movie that you might not fully understand, but you don't really care.
B0083Z614S|4.0|Very good to read over and over again. And makes you look at<br />Things different from other people's  thoughts in the world.
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Words will never be able to explain how much I love this movie. Robert Redford and Paul Newman's chemistry is the stuff of dreams. Buddy movies hope to conjure up the chemistry these two share.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Suspensful and kept us going the whole time! The message was a powerful one and very moving.  Would recommentd to others!!
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is an ultra violent, hyper active and blood soaked movie. While the dialogue isn't ignored, it isn't the center of the movie. The action is. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. I wouldn't say it's better than Vol.1, but it is  a bit more exciting, if not just for the crazy violent style
B004MOMT2M|3.0|I was REALLY excited to get this on DVD-A, only to find that, in my Bose-equipped Acura RL, the CD version, with Centrepoint enabled, sounds better than the DVD-A version.  Sad.  Every other DVD-A I've owned sounds PHENOMENAL compared to the CD.  Don't waste your money on the DVD-A.
B000QQFKYE|5.0|For those that have ever seen a David Lynch movie, they know what they are getting into, which ironically is the unexpected. This movie is no exception. If this is Lynch's swan song, it was a damn good finale
0143116371|5.0|I love that these folks are their own fashion work of art. They just grab the doorknob and step on out.
0375714839|4.0|If this was written any other way, I probably wouldn't have given it a second look. But the graphic novel (and beautiful film) caught my eye. I loved this graphic novel and I highly recommend it to anyone
B00846REIS|1.0|At first, lots of symmetry with FSOG then it just got worst and worst.  The chemistry got lost in the mix, Gideon is no Christian Grey...he seems hot, but completely boring.  Eva is sounding more like a tramp than just merely seduced.  I swear, I tried to...but I just couldn't go on reading anymore.  My skull started to feel numb.  Sylvia Day was trying too hard to be descriptive that I was lost.  It was just to busy that my eyeballs started aching.  I had an open mind anfd thought that this was going to kick FSOG's butt....didn't happen.  I want my money and the hours wasted that I will never get back.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|Skip the horrible American remake (Let Me In), stick to the original (Let the Right One In). This is not your typical vampire movie. It is dark and has a bloody finale, let it has it's tender loving moments. Great chemistry between the two young leads.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|wow what a production.  I am just a normal central valley californian and never been to sea, this must be what it's like
B00009TB5G|4.0|For those that have seen the LotR trilogy, they know that this is not the best in the series. In no way is it as amazing. It doesn't have the heart of the first or the epicness of the last. It is a good middle fit.
B000YR3WUE|5.0|It doesn't matter what I have to say about the music, it could suck to you it could be really cool I don't really care about this review crap when it comes to music just enjoy it haven't we had enough writing on everything?
B00005JMUA|5.0|This film is a complete opposite of Vol.1. Where Vol.1 was ultra violent and hyper, this film takes it slow and is all about the dialogue and interactions. The final confrontation will not let you down. It feels like a Sergio Leone movie, in a way it is even better than Vol.1
B007B6VOG0|5.0|It doesn't matter what I have to say about the music, it could suck to you it could be really cool I don't really care about this review crap when it comes to music just enjoy it haven't we had enough writing on everything?
B000VK6MNI|5.0|Jason is following in his father's footsteps. This hilarious satire you will want to watch over and over again. I can't think of many other films like this one.
B004CR5TD0|5.0|It doesn't matter what I have to say about the music, it could suck to you it could be really cool I don't really care about this review crap when it comes to music just enjoy it haven't we had enough writing on everything?
B0000AUHPG|4.0|Who else can you ask for in your Western flick (Eastwood and Van Cleef aside). This is the of the other Westerns that Leone made. It is not a well remembered, but it should be. It might lack certain elements that made &#34;The good, the Bad and the Ugly&#34; an ultra-masterpiece, but this is still a masterpiece
B0002YLC24|5.0|this is good stuff when it comes to movies.  well produced and really great acting.  creative in its motive and has lots of feeling
B00A8ECU24|5.0|a fun little game that is a great time waster and a good chance for the bronies to have some fun with the show
B00005YW4H|5.0|It doesn't matter what I have to say about the music, it could suck to you it could be really cool I don't really care about this review crap when it comes to music just enjoy it haven't we had enough writing on everything?
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was the best! I loved it! I want to see it in in the movies now so bad!!!!!!
B007M45PMU|5.0|It doesn't matter what I have to say about the music, it could suck to you it could be really cool I don't really care about this review crap when it comes to music just enjoy it haven't we had enough writing on everything?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put this book down the best read I have had in a while!.... can't wait to read the other two!
B0048IMZMG|5.0|It doesn't matter what I have to say about the music, it could suck to you it could be really cool I don't really care about this review crap when it comes to music just enjoy it haven't we had enough writing on everything?
B003QSLW0K|5.0|This has been one of my all time favorite movies. Heartwarming and funny. I forget how witty it is. No one gets left behind or forgotten
B006BXTOFC|5.0|It doesn't matter what I have to say about the music, it could suck to you it could be really cool I don't really care about this review crap when it comes to music just enjoy it haven't we had enough writing on everything?
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book! A little more graphic than I expected but really good.  I  recommend to anyone who likes thrills and excitement.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway suffers is the best game ever.Everyone should play this APP. It's way better than the old temple run. As I told you Try this app.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|It doesn't matter what I have to say about the music, it could suck to you it could be really cool I don't really care about this review crap when it comes to music just enjoy it haven't we had enough writing on everything?
B00BB8SKPW|1.0|It wasn't what I thought it was built up to be.  Turned it off about 1/3 the way through.  It just wasn't good.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Fast paced and very interesting. Recommend to anyone looking for some great entertainment. Really held my attention to the very end.
B0018QQQK8|1.0|This held my interest through out. Enjoyed especially the ending. I would recommend this to any one. Sparks is one of my favorite authors.
0525951652|5.0|This book was an excellent read, can't wait for rest of series. the authors details of the time frame is very good makes you feel as if you are there.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|I guess I'm the only one who sees something wrong about a book and movie about children killing children. The world goes on a rampage when things like this happen in real life. Get the guns off the streets, but when a film like this comes out they're first in line to buy a ticket. Kids see this stuff in the movies and think its alright to kill somebody. Why not? The book and movie made it out to be alright. Oh wee! That's the world we live in today.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The cord works perfectly. It is just like new again.<br />I was told it would work with all Kindle Fire's, and it does.<br />Also arrived quicker than was expecting.
B004J64QR4|5.0|The music is fantastic! It was great to hear the original and former cast members come together in a reprisal of some of the top songs, especially Bring Him Home. Norm Lewis is wonderful as Javiert.<br />Glad I was able to hear this before the movie.
B005FISBTO|4.0|This is a good series but I haven't received this dvd yet. I am also waiting for the seventh season which isn't out yet.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game SO much that I can't stop playing. This is a lot better than Temple Run because you can do more things with it, and about every month or so there is a new place that comes with an upgrade! This game is the best app I own by far!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|the best game in the world ever wine needs to get this game and that will love it I'm little cuz got it and I love it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I enjoy taking it to my kids events and that it doesn't require Internet connection to play.  It keeps kids busy when bored.
0790733226|4.0|The movie is a good effort and does help to understand how some of the concepts of the novel might be envisioned, but is not a satisfying realization of all the events and action of the novel.  Probably no movie could do that in two hours.  That would probably need a long TV series, such as COSMOS.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|can u make a 3rd one i need more games. i have alot i just need more. i kinda like this game
B000XUBFE2|4.0|With every twist and turn I am unable to forget this novel(the book thief..by Markus Susan).<br />Words are forever meaningful.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I sat down and watched this charming movie of Tinkerbell and her long lost sister.  It had a great story line and filled with magical surprises.  My daughters watch this often and I enjoy it being on as well.
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|I'm recommending this book to everyone I know.  Best book I have read in years. Great writer and fascinating story.
1419705849|5.0|The Diary of a Wimpy Kid books are always superb.  My son read this book in a day and is ready for another one.  Keep whippin' 'em out Jeff!
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use the Yahoo mail app along with Google Chrome also on my adroid.  In my opinion, they  both are pretty much equal
B004GCPJDQ|1.0|I ordered this after owning my magic mouse for about a year.  I got tired of replacing batteries and thought this would be a more simplistic solution in comparison to rechargeable batteries.  When it came in the mail I was stoked however, quickly disappointed.  It took me the better half of an hour to just install the battery pack that came with the device.  The battery pack was a cheap plastic, not the metal of the current magic mouse plate.  It was difficult to get it to fit in there properly without snapping the back plate.  Once I finally got it in there I thought - well, that was obnoxious, but theoretically I'll never need to replace it, if all goes well. I waited until the magic mouse had a full charge - (overnight) and went to re-sync my magic mouse with my iMac.  No luck, it searched and searched and searched and searched....however the bluetooth was never able to connect.  I thought something was wrong with my mouse, so just to check, I took out the Mobee charger plate and replaced it with my batteries and original magic mouse plate, Getting that Mobee plate out was twice as hard as putting it in. Once I got the original plate back in my Magic Mouse it synced up instantly and we were on our way. I packaged the Mobee Charger up and sent it back for a refund - I wanted to love this product, I really did...however, it just didn't work out - if it ever comes out \\"new and improved\\" I'd be willing to give it another go, until then it's back to the rechargeables for me.
B005HSL626|5.0|My three year old grand baby Hope begged me to get this game on my cell phone for her. I was quite pleased when she TAUGHT me how it worked the first day.  I have to admit, it is quite challenging and fun for her and me when she is not using my android!  Ads are only small and really don't interfere.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this game now the update lets you play with a ipod touch and kindle fire ipad and phone to servers awesomeness rocks minecraft
B004FRX0MY|5.0|The system works quite well.  It seems to work pretty much the same as I-tunes and the cloud saving that comes with it is wonderful as you can then access it from your other devices.
B004NOH9LC|4.0|Enjoyed a peek into the crazy life of TV producers of morning television programs through the eyes of a young woman determined to succeed. Rachel McAdams shined!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|awesome fun with this app beware it gets addictive and with the new birds like the owl and power up s nice game
B0063GORYU|4.0|Great fun class card game. Hours of enjoyment without any glitches. only wish there were a few more customization but it is what it is :)
B007N85POS|1.0|bought it but could not see it in app store after buying it for some reason even though my tablet is hd
B000268QB2|5.0|Although Strangeland comes very very close to being as good as this album is, this is still by far the best in all of the (4?) major albums they have released. If you're a Keane fan and don't have this album, buy it NOW.
1451627297|4.0|Storytelling the way it should be. What ifs & what nots about going back in time are examined by Stephen King in another one of his classic tales.
B007FOH7UU|5.0|I love that Keane went back to their piano-domniated roots, from the same roots where &#34;Hopes and Fears&#34; came from. This is an excellent album. I would say it comes as a close second to &#34;Hopes and Fears&#34; in terms of quality. There are songs that are hopeful, depressing, nostalgic, reflective... some of these songs like &#34;Sovereign Light Cafe&#34; and &#34;Watch How You Go&#34; really tug at the heart, almost kills me from nostalgia. &#34;Disconnected&#34; and &#34;The Starting Line&#34; both have excellent melodies, and &#34;Day Will Come&#34; should be on the radio. It's totally unfair that this album didn't get more recognition in the US, but that's our loss. Thank you Keane for another great album.
1416594795|5.0|Evolution Explained. Its as simple as that. Richard Dawkins explains page by page, chapter by chapter the case for evolution. After reading this it would be hard for anyone to have an arguement against evolution.
B005HS00NW|2.0|I feel like i wasted my money on this album... it felt like after the 3rd song, it just was noise from there. Maybe just not my style of music, i don't know. But i love Midnight City so i thought the other songs in the album would be similar but i was disappointed that they were not... they got a bit weird for me...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is a really good book and I think it could be an inspiration to some people if they actually comprehend what they read.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|Best new show I've seen in a long time.  Totally unpredictible which is something that hasn't been done in a long time.
B00ANY7V8M|5.0|My daughter loves cats so wanted this set. Easy to put together and fun to play with. Great add to the overall Lego Friends set.
B00B769XB8|5.0|I felt this movie had a lot action and some sense of humor to were it had some comedy. I really enjoyed watching<br />this movie one of the best Hansel & Gretel movies I've seen in a long time. I give it 5 stars.
0762445262|3.0|It was fine.It works fine.  I just thought it was going to be bigger. Other then that it was ok.Thanks. Tammy
B005K17RU0|5.0|the easiest weather app! with all the info you could need! this app is even better then all the weather websites!
B00BHMF578|5.0|It was amazing to see what one determined person could do. HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING EXCEPT HELP THOSE VICTIMS OF A DANGEROUS REGIME WHO CARED NOTHING ABOUT THE LIVES OF INNOCENT AMERICANS. While other people were worried about what the outcome might be, he risked everything to get them out to safety.
B0095P31L6|4.0|The unusual and quirky characters were rendered lovably cute by sheer force of wit, animation and great acting. The story of a battle against both greed and a dry, harsh backdrop of the desert under Olyphant's metaphoric Spirit of the West made for an entertaining, humorous compilation of pure entertainment. The graphics shone and highlighted a story of grit and conviction vs utilitarian rule storybook tale. . Depp and Beatty were spot as the \\"taginists\\" of the story. Good fun. Cannot wait to view it again
B000FC1HBY|5.0|When autumn begins its descend into Westeros bringing with it dark whispers of winter and a burning comet in the sky, the land falls into turmoil and treachery. The cold and empty iron throne beckons to many, but whose claim is true and whose is born of smoke, deceit, and furtive villainy? A boy king born of incest, a pale haired princess the last  of a dying line of past kings, a brother battle hard and iron willed, and a younger brother benevolent and beloved-- on whose head would the crown of the realm peacefully rest?<br /><br />The kingdom cast about so like a storm ravaged sea breaks upon the iron throne and shatters. The dead walk with ice blue eyes and coal black hands. The wildlings are gathering north of the wall, but to what purpose? Even the shadows honed sharp and dangerous by the words of the woman in red offer no shelter.  As every player of the game seeks advantage, the land, its people, and the very heavens burst forth in blood, magic, and fire. \\"For when kings clash; the whole land trembles.\\"<br /><br />Many a time, I have found the middle books in a series a bit of a drag-- long winded, detail riddled, important plot building installments but ultimately cliff hanger kindling that adds more to the anticipation of the next read than the true enjoyment of the current book. This time that was not the case.<br /><br />George R. R. Martin does it again. The ridiculously good story seems to fly out in so many unanticipated but highly entertaining directions with twists and turns leading the reader further down the rabbit hole to Westeros. These books are literary genius! He is a master character smith. The absolute scale of this interwoven tale is unbelievable. So so so so good. Seriously.<br /><br />I have some new favorites to love and hate in this book. Here's the dish.<br /><br />To Love:<br />*Ser Davos Seaworth- known as the Onion Knight for past good deeds as a baseborn smuggler/siege breaker made knight by his king<br />*Ser Byrnden Blackfish- a knight that understands the importance of family and honor, he is a key advisor and confidant of his nephew Rob Stark<br />*Qhorin Halfhand- the first ranger from the Shadow Tower well renowned as a wildling slayer and master swordsman<br />*Jaqen H'ghar- the faceless man from Braavos who keeps his promise to aid Arya Stark<br />*Brienne Tarth- a brave yet unlovely valiant knight-- strong of will and sword<br /><br />To Loathe:<br />*Melissandre- a scarlet eyed, crimson cloaked priestess to the lord of light, loves to say, \\"The night is dark and full of terrors.\\"<br />*Craester- the ickiest man north of the wall with nineteen wives and nineteen daughters, but there are only nineteen women... you do the math. But no sons...<br />*Walder Frey- the yellow bellied guardian of the Twins and the river crossing, doesn't lend aid until most battles are over<br />*The Mountain- Lord Tywin's personal headsman, raping, pillaging, and burning anything in his path<br />*Theon Greyjoy- the ironborn ward of Winterfell and last living heir to the iron isles (read to find out why I detest him)<br /><br />This book will make you turn a suspicious eye every time you see a raven. \\"Dark wings, dark words\\" is a theme in this book. Every raven sent throughout the realm seems to carry doom and destruction, fear and fighting, shadow and secrets. You will wait with baited breath to hear the tale they bring.<br /><br />This book (most likely all books in this series) is a 5 Commendable Yarn. I can't seem to tell you enough how much you will enjoy reading these books. There is something in them for everyone.

5554040527|4.0|PRINCE-THE VERY BEST OF PRINCE:  MICHAEL JACKSON may have gotten more press but the REAL talent of the eighties was a certain sawed off multi-talented violet-enshrouded Minneapolis funk diversh who dubbed himself PRINCE. Not only could this elusive, erotic wondercat sing like STEVIE WONDER and dance like JAMES BROWN, he also jammed out on any instrument, and penned huge pop hits for THE BANGLES, TOM JONES, SINEAD O'CONNOR, SHEILA E, and CHAKA KAHN, in addition to his own impressive repetoire of cunning classics. His falsetto-belted debut ditty I WANNA BE YOUR LOVER and the one-two club-floor punch of LITTLE RED CORVETTE and 1999 made way for a bevy of mega-charters from the heat-sinking soundtrack PURPLE RAIN, (including the nine minute title piece) as well as sexually charged followups such as RASPBERRY BERET, the SHEENA EASTON duet U GOT THE LOOK, and CREAM. Were it not for his legendary eclecticism and highly experimental nature, PRINCE could have no doubt churned out radio smashes right into the new millenium...as it is, THE VERY BEST captures the master at the absolute peak of his purple powers.<br /><br />RATING: FIVE SMIRKS
B007SGM084|3.0|I didn't know what to expect and purchased this Trilogy at the suggestion of another.  Wish I had taken the time to check it out first - for me, it was a waste of money.
B0040GUIAC|5.0|love love the bodyguard original soundtrock album i have all ways love witney music she has always make good music
B003L20IJM|4.0|I enjoyed the first movie and this one proved to be just as good.  I even purchased another one as a gift and with Amazon's ties to other suppliers, I was able to get it quickly and very economically.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|hard to play but that reminds me of the same Outrun game they seem to be basing this on so I guess that's ok.
B005ILYWN2|5.0|I was not sure what to expect when I watched this for the first time, but I ended up loving it!  It was an awesome way to tell old Norwegian folk tales.  When you see a title like Troll Hunter, you think of some B style Sy-Fy original, but this was top notch.
B002GHHHKQ|1.0|Gee, what can I say... this is a very lame lower level intelligence movie.  Wish I had not spent any money on it.
B00125JP1C|4.0|This is the kind of movie to put in when you want nothing but ridiculous action that doesn't take itself seriously.  The director and the actors knew what kind of movie they were making and they had a blast making it.
B00AKOB7CG|5.0|Easy to follow routines. I love the variety and that I can target whatever body part I want. Nice to have a choice when time is short.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Our neighborhood book club chose this novel.  One friend loved it, said she could hardly put it down.  Several others said they had trouble getting into it but when they did, enjoyed it.  I read all the way to the bitter end, although I did not finish by book club meeting.  At the end I was just as disinterested in Nick and Amy as I had been at the beginning, although perhaps a bit more motivated to finish because I hoped they would get what was coming to them. Neither did, so I hated the abrupt ending too.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love this game but the stupid FREAKING Facebook option keeps glitching  now I have to start over so dry but deleted
0393965953|5.0|The book was in amazing shape when it got to me.  Payment process was effortless, and shipped with much haste
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Bought this for my wife this past Christmas. She is OK with it, but I really like it. A nice mix of old and new music from Rod. Well done in my opinion.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|What's not to like about community?!?  The item was shipped fast and it was in great shape when it got here.  No hassle, nothing was britta-d up!  Cool cool cool
B009PF93LS|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my wife. She loves it. The only problem with it is now I have to listen to Michael Buble all of next December in our home (LOL!).
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I've overclocked this to 4.2 with a Noctua NH-U9B. EASILY! I could push it way further if I cared to polish the contacts and apply the grease properly but 4.2 at 70 under load is good for me.
B00770KR7W|5.0|If you are a Halo 4 fan this is a must have! I had my doubts about it, but it has great detail in the armor and gun. It is also very easy to make it stand in almost any way you want, but his legs don't bend very well, so he can't crouch and such.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Perfectly paced games that are challenging and fun at the same time. I was hooked after two games and will keep playing until I have unlocked them all.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I am on level 7 and I only have 2 quests instead of 3! I don't know what to do!!!! Help please!!!
B005OK721G|5.0|The movie is well done and accurate. The moral courage of the CIA field officer is displayed with some humor. If you liked :Point of Impact&#34; and/or &#34;Shooter&#34; you will enjoy this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|his game Subway Surfers is such an awesome game but it can also get annoying but it is also really funn!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Unassuming, this novel simply eases its way into your heart. I did not want to put it down, so when I couldn't actually hold the book I was listening to it from audible.com. A must read, now on my list of best books ever. Read it before the movie, you're going to love both.
B004GYY714|4.0|We live in an area that has little or no radio reception so this app is welcome. It also has a great variety.
B00395ZYVS|4.0|I wasn't sure if I would like this book, but it held my attention and was a page turner. It had a great climax and some surprises. However, the end left me wondering.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It is nice to have a ready source of local weather. As usual the weather channel does an excellent job in providing timely and accurate info.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love puzzles and this app. This app has a variety of puzzles to choose from and a variety of different ways to do them. Lots of fun and hours of play!
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This really helped me understand the series on HBO better. I look forward to book two and the new season.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Another great album released by one of my favorite  fun, rockin' and rhymin'  bands!  This is an album that has tunes you will find yourself singing over and over!! Don't Drive By this album!!
B007K3JFUQ|5.0|This was a gift for my husband.  We both enjoyed the first one and this one did not disappoint either.
0765325950|5.0|I thought it was great- action-packed and a satisfying finish to the series. Let's face it though, if you've read the first 13 books, there's no way you're stopping now no matter what anyone says!
B00127RAJY|2.0|I used this for a week and couldn't handle it anymore. It's not that the workouts were too tough, because even on the hard level, it wasn't that hard. It was Jillian herself that annoyed me so I gave it to a friend.
B00B2EWNWG|4.0|This was a fun movie, it was again, Tarantino doing a variant on his Grindhouse stuff with the 70's campy Kung Fu movie.  I think its the first time I've liked a Russell Crowe movie since Gladiator.<br /><br />Movies like this can't be judged next to Jet Li or Bruce Lee movies, they aren't, they are remakes of 1970's drive in stuff.  I think I remember the 1970's.  I was there, just how much I was there is the question.  Cung Le is no Jet Li, he's not the product of the Bejing Wushu academy, but he has a great sense of humor and some good stunt work. Totally worth it.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Well here we have Ben Affleck all grown up as director/actor. The movie is good entertainment but flexes the story line against the truth at times. I did find Ben's performance good in the movie but I am not a huge Affleck fan. At times it felt they tried to create suspense rather than letting it happen through the story line. Don't misunderstand me I did thoroughly enjoy the movie and would recommend it. Just go into it knowing it is Ben Affleck acting and directoring along with the primary purpose of entertainment. Definitely a good watch though!
1451695195|5.0|Great ending...............great book, well written, lucid, understandable...........and very comforting. Dr. Alexander's life changing NDE was a remarkable story, a real page turner
1439170916|4.0|Awesome book, but in the middle I was stuck a bit. Some of the historical nuances got a little boring and slow for my taste.
1595825045|4.0|Great art book for a die hard Avatar the Last Air Bender fan, but it could have been twice as long and with more information about the martial arts, historical and cultural influence of the series. Very fun to read as it is.
1400049628|5.0|this book is great for a laugh, but it also gives you a lot of sound advice in the event of an actual pandemic level disease outbreak. it has a lot of great survival tips, and a fair bit of humor as well. definitely worth it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Interactive, and fun to play .energetic, bright and colourful with jumpy music . Berry competitive. Which makes you want to win! ;)
B008VBYN80|4.0|Nice little game, good concept, can't escape the $$$ factor. Diamonds run the world and it will cost you. Would have rated 5 stars if free game play lasted a little longer.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|I think the first temple run was ten times better than this slow stupid thing. this game sucks with all these glitches!!!!!!!!
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Initially, I was not impressed with this novel. The first two chapters seemed pointless. However, the novel picks up as the reader understands the rationale for the room. Later psychological difficulties of Mom seemed glossed over as the boy spends time with other family members. Novel ends on an up beat note.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This  book has a meaning for any word  you use everyday  when communicating .this book is for everyone to use
B0016OLC5Q|2.0|This movie is great if you enjoy poverty but not great if you are looking to come up out of it. I felt this movie was a tedious romanticizing of poverty and starving to death in a bus in the middle of Alaska. Supertramp should have gone to Wall Street and lived a happy life. He comes to the conclusion that a writer must deny himself beautiful women and proper sanitation in order to be a true poet. I disagree with the entire premise. He just needed a proper girlfriend and some money, that is all. I hope aspiring writers don't try this home. Go to Wall Street and get a girlfriend who loves you, that's my advice.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I initially wasn't going to see this movie, because I read that it glorified the CIA too much. But trailers encouraged me to give it a chance & I'm glad I did. The CIA isn't all bad & the opening history lesson more than made up for other questionable things we know have been done in our name. It is Oscar material, kept me suspended, even though I knew the outcome.
1603425381|5.0|I LIKE THIS BOOK AND LEARN TO DO VERY MUCH BORDERS TO DIFFERENT WORKS. FILL MY EXPECTATIONS AND I SHARE IT WITH OTHERS
B00BETX5PS|3.0|While the special effects and cinematography are impressive, the plot drags on without the emphatic highlights expected of a Bond movie.  Technical inconsistencies detract from the storyline.  While Bond films are not expected to be realistic, this one has too many disconnects from reality and even within itself.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|It's another masterpiece by Josh!!  Glad it has more songs in English.  Can't wait for his next release. A great CD to add to my Groban collection.
0374533571|5.0|excellent understanding of mental illness...the character family and friends struggle...A TRULY GOOD READ.AND WOULD &#34;IT'S DEFINETLY A FEEL GOOD READ ..
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Playing games was not the reason I purchased my Kindle Fire HD but it was a nice bonus.  This is a simple game but entertaining and it was FREE.  :)
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This isn't just another love story. It has a lot of twice an turns, the author keeps you wanting more. I just love how she kept you into the book just couldn't put it down.  It could of been a true story.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great me an  my bros love it.  My little brothers can't even get of my kindle so I can use my own. I highly recommend this game for little kids.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I had seen this movie but had not read the book. The book is suspenseful and exciting. Quite a buildup period but once the action starts it keeps going. I would recommend this book.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book and it was awesome if I could rate higher I would probably pick something with more than 1000 zeros I love this book more than any book I read I hope more diary of a whipey kid books come out soon please
B005PK553C|5.0|Best scary series I've seen in a long time. The storyline is ridiculously creepy. Dylan McDermott is awesome in his role (as is Jessica Lange).
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Want to see the movies now to see how differently I imagined it compared to the author and producers and etc.
B007HACDLK|4.0|VInce Flynn always provides stories tyat holdyour attention and are entertaining.<br /><br />You get the feeling that he was in the CIA
B008OOYALE|5.0|the dragons are so adorable, very colorful and surprisingly the dragons, habitats, food and gold are not that expensive.. fun (-:
B00BHMF578|2.0|Second rate movie!!!  How and who gave this movie an academy award??<br />Boring and second rate movie.  Movie is just second rate all the way through.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It was boring and it was hard to read but it was okay I guess. They could have made it easier to read.
B004G600A4|5.0|My 2 1/2 year old loves Tangled!  Unlike some of the older Disney princess movies, this one came out after my time and I did not see it until we purchased it recently for my daughter.  I immediately loved it (I'm 35) as did she!  Very cute movie, quickly became one of our favorites.
B0076794IO|5.0|This book was a little different, and as an expat myself, I had an affinity to the main character.<br />The plot soon becomes very mysterious though, and I was reluctant to stop reading it each night.<br />An excellent spy story.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|This game is excelent!<br />I enjoyed it (SotC) on PS2 and now on PS3, and the graphics really changed.<br />You will have many hour of fun with it. It's hard to get all the trophies...<br />It comes with 2 themes (ICO and SotC) and the videos of the developers's experience making the game.<br />I would have liked to get the sountracks included for downloading, because they're really good (both games).
B007EW9ISM|3.0|I love the wide grip and the somewhat heavy feel of this stylus. Based on the reviews it seemed like a good all-around stylus for a reasonable price. The tip isn't all that thick despite the nature of the stylus itself, but the problem is I can't see where I'm writing - where the tip is going to land on my iPad. It gets annoying even playing Draw Something so I don't use it much.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|Not worth paying for. Don't waste your money or time on this game. Look for something better than this game.
B000BYCAJE|5.0|Wonderful vocals and harmony, sounds just as good as it did way back when.  Nice to hear it without the scratchy record sound!
B003O86FMW|5.0|The best book the hunger games series has to offer.  The first one was confusing and the mood was odd, but catching fire really spruced the series up a little
0452295548|5.0|I  am glad to have read this book.  It contains a very lot of information.  I love to keep on learning in my retirement.<br />Especially helpfull, is a list of things you can do for a stroke victim,if you are a care giver.
B00A0HQ7H8|4.0|Lana's voice is as musky and fabulous as always, and her song lyrics hold questionable meanings, as well as being provocative. For those of us who loved her first album, the second is a must-listen. You won't find many of the faster paced upbeat songs on &#34;Paradise&#34;, it's overall a more thoughtful sounding album. It gets 4 stars because it is worthwhile for fans. If you love Lana, you'll love it.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|the game seems like it may be fun but the redirect to full screen ads in between every short game last longer then the game itself this is horrible gave it 5 minutes 4 of which were spent trying to close the ads then UNINSTALL
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I cried my eyes out. Def a different type of story than I am used to but the love between these 2 is amazing. It was a nice easy read but I did cry a lot!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|i am not a crying person, but this one had me crying as Petty Officer Luttrell takes you into the fight. He makes it seem real. You feel the sorrow, loss, and hardship he endures. And he endures it for his country and for his brothers in arms. A very inspirational story.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Great Show. I'M totally hooked. Bought This On Amazon. Quick Shipping. Can't Wait For Season 3.  It Has Me Addicted On Buying Gerber Gear!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hands down my favorite game on my kindle.I can play it all day on my off pity f work days...
B0070Y46UY|4.0|The book brought me a different perspective on the skill of surviving. It was great and insightful. I didn't expect to learn something on this book. Now I want to see the movie but am scared of spoiling the book.
B000XUBC5E|4.0|I started this book a few months ago and couldn't seem to stay interested.  I pushed through and the last quarter of the book was well worth it.  Lots of twists ... overall a really good, well thought out story.
0765325950|5.0|I loved this series. I have enjoyed it for 20 years. I didn´t want it to end. As I read it I couldn´t slow down my reading but I didn´t want it to finish too fast. It is true that it is mostly one big battle, but it is the Last Battle, so what could we expect? There is less in building characters and relationships than in previous books because of this. But still it´s a great ride! The last 40 pages or so of the book aren´t what I would have liked to be the ending but it is impossible to find an ending that will please all the fans and it had to end somehow. This is a brilliant series! Probably my favourite book/series of all time. I don´t know if I would have enjoyed it as much if I hadn´t started reading them when I was 18 (20 years ago). But as it is I throughly recommend it. One should read this as much as one should read Tolkien at a younger age. And Brandon Sanderson did a great work. Knowing him through TWOF brought me to his other books, and Way of Kings is superb. I feel as if an era has ended. And I feel close to all those other fans out there that feel the same. I would appreciate tips on any other books that could compare (I don´t think Fire&Ice is as good as WOFT but I do like The Name of the Wind series) or that you would like to recommend anyway. As I´ve said: It´s been a hell of a ride! Rand will always live in my memory.
B009UMTMKS|3.0|The main subject is powerful, but it could be written in 1/4 pages.<br />However, it worth a lot. I recommend it.
B00BHMF578|3.0|The suspense was gripping.  Character development was well done.  A throughly entertaining evening of movie watching.  I recommend it to all.
1616550414|5.0|Purchased this book for our daughter who is a Zelda Aficionado!  She absolutely loves it.  Would recommend to anyone that plays the &#34;The Legend of Zelda&#34;.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|A very good movie. Great acting,especially Ben Afflect; however, in my opinion not 5 stars. I was a little shocked that it won out over the competition, but some may argue that this is the political nature of the Academy Awards. I would be in that group. If it were not such an incredible story, and a true one, I doubt it would have won best picture.
B002UNMW7O|5.0|For most the sequel sucks, but when considering the original movie the sequel is as good and at times better, I absolutely loved it!
B006TJXZ30|1.0|Got this app to try to check my email from Outlook.com which is where Hotmail has now been migrated to. Unfortunately, this app doesn't appear to work with Microsoft's new interface.
B00AQB2A3I|3.0|Technically, this album is brilliant. However, it lacks emotion and a personal touch that I have always been drawn to in Steven's prior releases. I can't flaw the musicianship, but part of my enjoyment of an album is the flow, cohesion, and the way it makes me feel. This album sounds like a group of great musicians got together to jam but didn't put their heart into it. Maybe that was the goal, but if so, it didn't work for me.
B0001MIQHQ|1.0|This DVD I purchased will only work in European DVD players.  Waste of my money.  I will not do business with these folks in the future.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I very much liked the APP, until I was asked to purchase coins to continuing playing.<br /><br />If you don't mind paying for additional play time...its a good bingo game
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I thought this was a good book, but it wasn't really for me. The story line was something that was a bit disturbing to me. But overall this was a good read.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Great movie I loved it cant stop watching it. Great buy and its part of my twilight saga collection. Recommend it to twilight fans
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Characters are fabulous, always has a great plot, full of suspense and drama one of the only shows I watch anymore.
1582701709|3.0|Not new, looked like it had been read before. It was going to be a gift, but I kept it for myself and bought another one from Barnes and Noble.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I read the editorial view on this page and found that the critic was about 180 degrees wrong about the characters, humor and pace of the movie. In fact, the movie didn't seem long to me at all. The pacing was excellent. It was also nice having the humor in there and appropriate since The Hobbit was written as a children's book with a very different tone to it. As much as I loved Lord of the Ring I loved this movie even better! I was quite pleased at how Peter Jackson did the scene with the dwarves and dishes and have to say that the best scene I have ever seen in a movie was the one with the eagles carrying the the characters out of harms way. It brings tears to my eyes every time I see it.<br /><br />I am not a purist but the scenes that do not correspond to the book are still from Tolkien's writings and need to be in there for the viewer to get a sense of the history and to help tie it to The Lord Of The Rings.<br /><br />All in all, I highly recommend it!
B0000057C5|5.0|i chose this 5 star rating, because it is a good c.d., and my father loves it :).  my father loves this c.d., because he's a big fan of rammstein.  i recommend this c.d. to everyone that loves rammstein :).  be careful not to scratch the c.d. lol.  thanks guys.
B0076DELIG|4.0|As always, Connelly had me turning the pages as fast I could. Loved the story line and have already recommended it to some of my friends.
0802473156|5.0|Save your relationship! Not just for women. Guys you can read too and there is no reason for you to not read this.
B001I999C2|5.0|Drumline is one of my favorite movies in the music field.  I highly recommend it to all music or marching band lovers.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Aside the the amazing story of Boyle's discovery, the brilliance of her music goes on.  What a great selection of songs here.
B0046ECFRM|5.0|This book has a quirky, sarcastic, believable heroine who is flawed and sometimes petty but also a good person with a great sense of humor. Stephanie Perkins has a knack for writing offbeat characters and her first novel is full of them. The fact that the story is set in Paris only makes it more romantic. I found myself rooting for Anna all the time.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Moving, real, funny, and yes, heartbrcan't wait for Season 4.eaking.  The 3rd season had to be the best.  But I'm still crying...
1616550414|5.0|There are already hundreds of other reviews that talk about how great this book is. So I'm just gonna' briefly compare the different versions.<br /><br />There are three of 'em: a Japanese edition, an English standard edition, and an English collector's edition [both English editions are licensed by Dark Horse]. The differences of the three books are almost 100% aesthetic. So besides the difference in covers and language, the content is exactly the same for all of them. In the following areas this is how they compare:<br /><br />Release date:<br />-Japanese (12/2011)<br />-both English (01/2013)<br /><br />Covers (all are hardcover):<br />-Japanese - brown w/ gold letters and symbols; has a kind of wrinkled texture design<br />-English standard - green w/ golden seal and a synopsis on the back<br />-English collector's - brown, faux-leather [not a rock-hard cover but has one of those slightly puffy covers] w/ black debossed seal and absolutely nothing on the back [I mean this in a good way]; also has gold gilded pages<br /><br />Content:<br />-no difference [all three have the same concept art, comic at the back, etc.]<br /><br />Japanese edition only:<br />-has a dust jacket and string bookmark attached to the spine<br /><br />Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) [rounded]:<br />-Japanese - if I read the cover correctly it's around 3000 yen (a little over 30 USD)<br />-English standard - 35 USD<br />-English collector's - 70 USD<br /><br />*What's so special about the collector's edition?<br />*I'm a HUGE Zelda fan. Should I get it?<br />-If you're all about substance, then honestly, there's nothing special about the collector's edition. I suggest you save your money and get the standard. It's so expensive because there were only 4000 of these produced and they will not reprint this version (only time will reveal how true this is).<br /><br />**If you've heard any bad thing about this book it's most likely in reference to the fact that a huge chunk of this historia focuses on Skyward Sword and not enough on the older, original TLoZ games. To be fair, this book commemorates 25th anniversary of Zelda and it was released around the same time as Skyward Sword. (Get it now?) I'm not trying to justify the difference in volume content of the different games. I, too, would like a more in-depth look at the original games. But that's how it is. Just be glad we have an official book from the creators themselves.historia focuses on Skyward Sword and not enough on the older, original TLoZ games.

B007L5GDGW|2.0|The action is much too slow. By the time u get the ball to drift to the right, the ball already needs to be on the left. Boring, slow and uninstalled.

B00BHMF578|5.0|Well done Ben Affleck! This true story needed to be told and deserved the Oscar for best picture. You should have had the best director Oscar as well!
0765325950|5.0|it was a great book I think Brandon Sanderson did a wonderful job at finishing Robert Jordan's work 2 more words really.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|Written very well.  Hard to put down.  Unique way to discuss the grieving process before one dies.  Everyone adult should read this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|People at the office talk bout Downton Abbey - I had no clue as to what show they were referring.  After seeing season one, I decided to view season two and that is because the show is fantastic.  Thanks Amazon for having the series in the video library
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Good packaging, great batteries, and last forever.<br /><br />Way better than those cheapie batteries you find online, and not much more expensive either.
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Great movies of their kind.  Lots of humor and plenty of adventure.  Some surprisingly good acting. Highly recommended for thriller fans..
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|I love Andrea Bocelli's music. I enjoy listening for hours at a time...quite mesmerizing. I enjoy translating the Italian to English so that I know the song story.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I loved the style of this book; the small vignettes telling detailed pieces of the tale from various aspects of the event.  I have never thought of zombies from the social- political- geo-spacial- economic- world-view point-of-view before.  And so much fun!<br /><br />The worst part about this book is now I can't go ANYWHERE without thinking to myself, if the zombies come right now, what's my way out?!  There aren't too many options on a subway car in downtown Seoul, I'll tell you that! :)  Great read!
B001DHXT1G|5.0|This version of the Hulk with Eric Norton is the better version and film other than that Eric Bana version.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|It was Christmas time and I could not find this movie in any stores for under $30.00.  I was having lunch on a Sunday and ordered from my phone.  It was at my door on Tuesday, in time for Christmas!!  And under $15.00.  Great service!

B005HED11Y|5.0|DO you need to hear anything?  Great series.  Timeless. Wonderfully entertaining.  Amazing how far Stat Trek has tralvelled through our culture.
B005GFPZYK|1.0|This book is merely a collection of stray thoughts. The writer is a psychotic. No story line and boring dont waste your money.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The fact that this is free on Amazon Prime makes membership worth it.  This and other great series from TV are always there.  Hope that seaon 3 is soon free also.
B001O1O71C|4.0|I truly enjoyed this story even though it ended so sadly. The repetition of cardinal rules, the mispronounciation  of out with and the innocence lost without knowing made this story truly engaging.

0062209078|3.0|I agree with other reviewers that were disappointed. The book left me wanting. I wonder if Pete assumed Who fans already know all the details that are sorely missing in this book. I wanted to hear the stories from the horse's mouth. He should have included a chapter for each of the other members; a chapter for all the great musicians of his generation that he got to play with and admire (or not). More details about composing and recording the albums that have meant so much for us as fans. Why does he use a different guitar for every song when he plays live. At a recent concert I counted 12 different electric guitars plus some acoustic. That kind of information is interesting and it's missing!<br />He writes that it had to be shrunk from 1,000 pages down to 500. Maybe they cut out most of the good stuff?
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool caught my eye and then my attention. The broken beginning is just the like the silo broken communities coexisting. I liked the play on the title. Wool covering their eyes and then scrubbed clean with knowledge. Moral dilemmas and cool blindside kept  me in the story.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Wow. I cannot get this story out of my head. This is a tale of true heroism that won't leave you. The valor of Mikey, Danny and Axe, and Marcus's unbelievable tale of survival despite repeated attempts by the Taliban to kill him was gripping from beginning to end. This book has made me appreciate, every day, the job these guys are out there doing to keep our country free.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I got this mouse based off of a recommendation from my partner. Right out of the box I was impressed by the presentation. It is by far the most comfortable mouse I've used and after just a few days I'm in love. By far the best mouse I've used and owned. I'd never heard about Anker before this mouse came up, but from what I've seen, they've nailed it. I send a question to customer service and they responded very quickly.<br /><br />If you're looking for a gaming mouse, this is it.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I stumbled on this series completely by accident and now I am hooked!  I was initially uneasy about watching anything about DC politics in person; specially given the fact that this Friday (3/1/2013) the country was shafted with the sequester! But the series is a compelling view of why Washington does NOT work for the Main Street!<br /><br />Kevin Spacey is superb and Robin Wright it so well cast that you believe she's been a politician's wife for all her life!  Wait, she was married to Sean Penn for a while.  And when Kevin's character offers a blade to the junkie Congressman in his own shower, that was just superb.<br /><br />This must be like getting hooked on crack cause I had to watch at least 5 episodes in one sitting.  The writing is so good, I keep wanting to take notes! The only conclusion is that this is MUST SEE TV.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games book one awesome. I would recommend to everyone. I am looking forward to book two and can't wait.

B005LAIHSG|5.0|I love this movie and am quite upset that they aren't making a sequel. But, it is definitely buying if you are on the fence about it or love fantasy films. Although, i'm not so sure what was so extended about the &#34;Extended Version.&#34;
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I finished this book in three days. It was great.  It was worth the money I paid for it.<br />Gives this book a chance.

B007I2BZIE|5.0|After countless attentive listening sessions, I can conclude that Clockwork Angels is a masterpiece(one that I have been eagerly anticipating for years). With the preceding album Snakes and Arrows, Rush displayed an increasingly heavy, organic, more progressive sound. Each song was permeated with different textures and layers of sound, lending to a more consistent album that I would consider one of the best in their expansive catalog. This new album furthered this progression and fully cemented their return to greatness. Forgive the cliche, but this is truly the best album they've released since Moving Pictures in 1981. The disc comprises over an hour of material representative of a band that is re-energized and revitalized. The energy and emotion on here is omnipresent, and encompasses the sonic and lyrical quality of every song. Nearly every song could be considered modern Rush classics, such as the epic title track \\"Clockwork Angels\\", the infectious \\"The Anarchist\\", and the powerful closer \\"The Garden\\", which remains one of my favorite songs Rush has ever written. The music effectively intertwines with the concept presented throughout the album, and the lyrics focus on philosophical and metaphysical themes in a fictitious world that is vivid and broad in scope. As always, the musicianship present is virtuosic, but has been substantially heightened in regards to complexity, groove, and improvisation. This album contains a focus and energetic drive that was holding back the almost flawless Snakes and Arrows (still amazing though), and this lends further to the consistent output on this album. Overall, this album is a must have for Rush fans and music fans in general. BUY THIS MASTERPIECE IMMEDIATELY.
0920668372|5.0|The book, &#34;Love You Forever&#34; is timeless.  It is not just for parents to read to children; it's for young adults, and especially for adults.  I came across this book while teaching elementary, some years ago.  I thought it was very endearing and had a mature ending for elementary-aged students.  It really makes you think about the life cycle and how the young becomes the old, and how we are all interdependent on one another.  I had forgotten about this book until I had a flash back.  I reordered it and will order additional copies to give to others as gifts.  This book is timeless!<br />Anna-Lisa Moore, MBA Candidate
B00785P2QC|4.0|Great game ..I would recommend these games to any of my friends...wish they would make more.. still play  them all whenever I get the chance
B007W1BLN0|5.0|An excellent study of how the behavior of our parents greatly affects the 'sensitive child' in ways that are beyond repair. I related on many levels and found myself crying at such touching moments . But there is also humor and beauty in this movie that keeps it from being morbid. At the end, he really seems to have worked out a lot of the pain, but it was too late to go back home ... Wonderful scenery and music as well. You won't forget this movie
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is the best game ever. Its all I play. People of all ages can play,its fun for the whole family! !<br />Sometimes it skips but other than that..PLAY SUBWAY SURFERS!!
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love this series and this book was fantastic! As always there is the action, humor, and fascinating Greek mythology intertwined throughout the book
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Heard people talking about the first season so much I felt out of the loop. Saw it on Netflix, and instantly hooked.<br />Never really watched PBS before but if I were to go out and see it in a theater I would gladly pay $15 bucks per show.<br />So I was more than happy to give a small donation for the opportunity to see a show that compares to anything on premium.<br />And it's real guy action, don't let the women on the View detour you with all the romance.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I really like it but I got to level five and then it wont let me collect coins or anything. I love it but I wish it would work
B000ICXQF6|4.0|This movie is a lot of work to watch, but the plot, while convoluted, was a nice diversion from everyday mindless movie going.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I have a idea for the next angry birds angry birds zombie apocalypse it's the angry birds and the pigs working together to protect the eggs from zombies because they both want them and at the end you decide who gets the eggs
B006ISJQ3K|5.0|Its always a treat hearing the alternate versions of the Motown classics, and in my view its revealing that the correct single/album cut was selected in every instance. A great album, among the best of her career, wonderfully packaged with alternate photographs as well.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|This album is aptly named. I have always enjoyed the watermark album, but this album is even better. I would recommend this music for all ages.

B00A81MV3U|4.0|Portraying mental illness onscreen usually means you'll see bravura scenes set in an asylum like [[ASIN:B000LY94N4 One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest]] or [[ASIN:B0001US78Q The Snake Pit]], but iconoclastic filmmaker David O. Russell ([[ASIN:B004LOJPLQ The Fighter]]) deals with the edges of emotional disequilibrium in this compellingly quirky 2012 dramedy. Based on the [[ASIN:0374533571 same-name 2008 novel]] by Matthew Quick, this film reminds me a bit of Russell's 1999 dysfunctional family comedy, [[ASIN:B008GTR15E Flirting With Disaster]], as the seriocomically volatile dynamics here are amplified by the central character's precarious psychological state. High school teacher Pat Solitano Jr. is a man with bipolar disorder who has spent eight months in a Baltimore psychiatric hospital for a violent episode caused by seeing his wife Nikki cheating with a fellow teacher. He's released into the care of his parents and determined to win back his estranged wife.<br /><br />As he strives to improve himself, Pat meets Tiffany Maxwell facing her own level of mental instability since becoming widowed, turning to indiscriminate sex with her co-workers, and most recently losing her job. Eventually they strike a deal where she will help him win back his wife if he enters a dance competition with her, both coping with their disorders at the same time. At first, I really didn't buy Bradley Cooper ([[ASIN:B002RVCCUQ The Hangover]]) as Solitano since his idea of showing manically obsessive behavior is to speak loudly in a monotone without much nuance, but his performance grew on me as Russell's screenplay had him show more layers to a character that has a hard time eliciting sympathy from anyone much less the audience. At 21, Jennifer Lawrence ([[ASIN:B00498YZH8 Winter's Bone]]) would appear too young to play a sex-addicted cop widow like Tiffany, but she excels with her preternatural ability to convey unforced maturity and conviction without losing touch with the character's deep-seeded vulnerability.<br /><br />Perhaps the film's nicest surprise is Robert De Niro's sterling performance as Pat Sr., his best work in years after the silly shenanigans of his Ben Stiller partnerships. Exhibiting his character's obsessive-compulsive disorder in powerful, brief scenes, De Niro vividly shows how the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. Completely submerging her Australian roots in favor of a convincing Mid-Atlantic accent, Jacki Weaver ([[ASIN:B004GGLVAM Animal Kingdom]]) effectively plays the lone voice of sanity as Pat's mother constantly fretting over her son and preparing \\"crabby snacks and homemades\\" for home viewing of the family's beloved Philadelphia Eagles.  As Pat's best friend Danny, a fellow patient constantly escaping from the hospital, motor-mouthed, high-pitched Chris Tucker ([[ASIN:B003A3R1E2 Rush Hour]]) is surprisingly good even if his soulful dance moves came across as a convenient plot device. Julia Stiles ([[ASIN:B00170KA0C Mona Lisa Smile]]) shows up in a smallish role as Tiffany's patronizing, status-conscious sister Veronica. The climax induces the right emotions even if it means the uncertainties in the plot get wrapped up all too neatly.eeded vulnerability.<br /><br />Perhaps the film's nicest surprise is Robert De Niro's sterling performance as Pat Sr., his best work in years after the silly shenanigans of his Ben Stiller partnerships.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is one of the best I have ever played.this is better than temple run.This is also a exhilarating game to play
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|The performances were good but the plot of the movie seemed to be bogged down. I am not sure I see this as worthy of Oscar nominations except for the performances.
B00AEFYCL4|5.0|Its a Long movie but Absolutely loved it.  Great acting, beautiful scenery.  I will be watching it again.  Ipad viewing.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I read this book while my mother was terminally ill. I found it to be positive. This man had some kind of experience that as a doctor and scientist and &#34;doubting Thomas&#34; his chronicles very well.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|I am not a big movie watcher but I am interested in history. This movie was excellent and had excellent actors and memorable lines. I would suggest this movie to others.
1574214276|5.0|I just discovered Zentangling. It is fun creative doodling. I highly recommend it. It gives you lots of ideas to extend your zentangling visual vocabulary.
B007712XAU|5.0|One of my all-time favorites. I was hooked from the very first scene, and am so looking forward to Season Four!
B00B0ZT9NI|4.0|I thought this was well done but I still do not see it as the BEST picture of the year. Worth seeing though, definitely. Very suspenseful.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Allsome game find myself playing all the time.and I am 38with better thing to do but I still collateral fun kills a lot of timeforme
0061124958|5.0|I read this over and over to my children when they were young. It teaches the values we want our children to have and about the cycle of life.
B009E3EWPI|5.0|As a fan from the very beginning, I was excited when I learned the group was releasing this recording! Out of respect for the band's loss of John Bonham, I had not expected them to ever reunite. For all of us who were not able to attend this monumental concert, this set is a must have! A fitting homage to the greatest rock band of all time!!
B006LSZECO|2.0|I found the story confusing since i just started the Kindle.  Then i got on the review of the book and it isn;t worth the effort.  sorry
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Well acted, well directed-- was on the edge of my seat. No extreme violence, no sex... factual, but with a little poetic license!
0316019984|5.0|The boys just love these books.  They are filled with so many unique qualities that I've never seen in a childrens book before.  Not for the young who want to pull out pages, because its all 3 dimensional and unfolds before your childrens eyes!  I, being the Nana, find this to be one of my favorite books to read to the boys..
1401311091|4.0|A must for fans of  Castle. You can hear the characters as you read. atotally fun romp. The other volumes are more serious.un romp.
B00AAKZPUK|4.0|This movie was made in the 70s, as the hairstyles clearly convey, but that it mostly irrelevant. It is exiting, well-directed, and well-acted. Max von Sidow is wonderful as an aging hit man. The chemistry between Redford and Dunaway is believable, and handled with an understated touch.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie just as much as I did the first time I saw it, when I was in college.
B0030MM68O|5.0|This movie is gripping and a thriller. The director did a great job on ensuring there was suspense throughout the movie. This movie is really good; no wonder it was nominated for an Oscar.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app so much! there are never any glitches plus there's unicorns! the kids I babysit love this game!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its a great game, it does need more items. extremely fun if you have friends to play with. its really fun
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Game is addictive and challenging. Makes you think. Is a bad habit because once you start you don't want to put it down.
B008RLTUUA|3.0|It comes across as well researched by the author but very condeming of the industry, regulatory bodies, medical journals, and just about everyone and everything associated with pharmaceuticals.  I think his facts are probably accurate, as far as they go.  Nonetheless, I think the other side of the story is just as important, i.e. the benefits to the human condition the industry and medical sciences have provided.  I guess I'll get someone else's book to get the balance I would have preferred to have had in this read .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think how subway surfers is travailing the world is amazing it is so cool and I love the Easter egg hunt!!!!!!!
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|my wife says it's an adorable little cartoon movie. goes great with the collection of them. she can't wait to get the next one
B00ARAN9JW|3.0|it really felt like a very expensive &#34;B&#34; movie...... the acting sucks. It was entertaining and a popcorn flick but that is all
B000UD0ESA|5.0|I love this edition. I don't watch the extra stuff much but it's there if i want it and the film is as Prophetic and sadly accurate portrayal of the reality of reality as one could expect a writer to imagine.<br /><br />Philip K. Dick was one of the brightest and darkly satirical as well as amusing writers in his field. He shows the persistence of humanity as well as the persistence of both the evils of money and power.<br /><br />The acting, S.E. and set design are all awesome. One of the great classic SF flicks of the 20th century.
B00B2V66VS|1.0|First of all, I LOVE this game. It is my favorite! But when I switched the visual quality to BEST, IT CRASHED AND IT WON'T START ANYMORE! IT OPENS BUT GOES BACK TO THE SCREEN. Please fix this. I hope Imangi Studios sees this and fixes it. P.S. It is on the kindle fire where I am having the problem on.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|Love this band!  There is no doubt that this band puts their hearts into the music that they perform. Awsome
B00933JL0A|5.0|loved this game. perfect for what i was looking for with no need for friends or to pay extra, I was just too addicted and I spent way too much time on it. so I got rid of it, and then got it again.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This books ending was saved by the epilogue because, really ending with Katniss half dead, Gale nowhere in sight, Prim dead, Katniss mom nowhere, Finnick dead, Cina dead, Eiffe was in the book for about two pages, Haymich half dead, Peeta messed up, Boggs dead. The book was very good though. This was a swag book homie dogg. Yolo
B007WPLZAK|2.0|I enjoyed the love story, but felt that the rating should be higher than what it currently is. Granted the episode descriptions state that there will be graphic scenes and sexual situations, I was caught off guard at how much one actually sees of the main female character and others as well.<br /><br />The story was slow and could have been told in one episode instead of two. I also did not enjoy going back and forth between the past and present day in the movie. It always took me a moment to figure out that time had passed when we would go back and forth. But this is a personal preference. If you are like me than you probably won't enjoy this show.<br /><br />I would have liked the ending to be different. It seems unrealistic to me, but I won't say why for fear of spoiling it.<br /><br />Overall, it was a descent story, I just wish it was rated better. Should be TV-MA instead of TV-PG. I wouldn't want my 7 year old to think that because it has the same rating as things like Star Wars: Clone Wars that he can watch this overly graphic show.
B002ELIXCA|5.0|I am a true fan of this series. Season 1 is probably my favorite season, but there are some others that rank up there for me too. I truly enjoyed all seasons even if some of them weren't as good as some others, I loved watching them, and would watch them again.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel plays this well, one of his best movies. John Goodman is a pleasent suprise. Good story and great movie.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|I loved this movie. It was raw and ruthless. Some scenes were a little graphic but I like that. I would definitely buy it!
B000RZGIQ8|5.0|Happy to get this in 16.9 widescreen and 6.1 sound. For a 20 plus year old movie . I think a great job was done making this DVD. I have a 60 inch plasma and a 110 watt Onkyo 7.2 system with two 11 Klipsh speakers and two subs and this DVD kicks butt. Far better than when I watched it ( even way back on VCR and big screen with a good sound system at that time) and it was good then, but better now. Get a copy if your a fan of this movie.I don't think you will be disapointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When my grandma first told me about subway surfers, I went to the<br />App store on my kindle fire HD. I then got Rio, and Rome. It is my<br />Favorite app.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Other reviewers have said just about everything there is to say about the plot, pacing, structure, cinematography, and score of the film--all excellent in my opinion--so I'll just touch on things that stood out to me.<br /><br />The acting was topnotch. There was a lot of real, raw emotion that I didn't think was melodramatic--this was the first World War, after all. Many emotions were left understated, and these were just as powerful. Empathizing was easy, with both the main characters and the 'vignette' characters. There were parts that made me laugh and parts that made me cry. This movie is a real winner when it comes to capturing the true emotion in a scene.<br /><br />One thing I really appreciated was the dialogue, and this really strengthened the characters. It was tight, it was realistic, and it was cleverly used to convey certain points. There were several quotes that had ties and inversions later in the movie. A few lines to watch for:<br />\\"He's not a dog.\\"<br />\\"We have the pluck but they have the luck.\\"<br />\\"Think how brave he is for refusing to be proud.\\" Which leads into my next point...<br /><br />The theme, I thought, was bravery--a certain kind of bravery. In the beginning, Albert's mother talks to him about his father having a special kind of bravery. The Major tells his men to \\"Be brave!\\" in the ambush and Captain Nicholls heeds his words. The French grandfather says that there may be \\"different ways to be brave.\\" Albie's friend Andrew shows a peculiar inversion of bravery in the trenches. And Albert himself is brave in the events following the war and his offer to let go. This theme of bravery repeats throughout, and it is reflected in the horse's journey and actions. I believe Joey is a metaphor for a certain kind of bravery: the selfless bravery that takes the fall and endures.<br /><br />I believe this movie has something for everyone, thought that's for you to determine. Recommended for fans of war movies or family films. Not recommended for horse lovers, unless you're brave enough to endure an emotional journey.r horse lovers, unless you're brave enough to endure an emotional journey.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|I think this documentary presents several great points about our agricultural system.  Very informative, of course the show is pushing an agenda, but it's worth considering.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very dramadic game also really fun.It is also very exiting to play. I hope you injoy it too.@#$&amp;&amp;(()*&amp;%$#@1244567890...!?!.
B007IK44CK|4.0|Enjoyable show, Tom Cruise thinks highly of himself of course, and it's movies like this that just may give him reason so to believe...  Worth watching if you enjoy the other Mission Impossible flicks!
1400049628|5.0|It is a pretty fun book to read. I used it as a reference for writing a Zombie speech. Kinda hard to get into without spoilers but I'd recommend it to anyone who likes Zombies.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i love this game its the best under all games!!! i love it play this game and you think with me
B007885IJU|5.0|The music is fresh and I enjoy listening to it.<br />It's fun to be able to buy the vinyl version.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I enjoy these series tremendously and look forward to every episode! I highly recommend this to everyone!
B009K0OL06|5.0|Good Show!  We can't seem to stop watching it. We watched a whole season in one weekend.Can't wait for the next season.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|Very much like minecraft it is very entertaining. The demo is short, it only gives you 15 minutes of play time before you have to quit and restart again. Overall it is a very good game with great details and the sound is amazing, it's a great way to try and see if you like it.
B004LROUNG|4.0|A good book that keeps your interest throughout the entire book. Once you start to read to read it, it is difficult to put down.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The show is great and so is the Blu-ray/DVD Combo UV pack, it gives you everything as advertised and the HD copies are redeemable on Amazon Instant Video, which is a plus for me.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Love this game.  I have 1 and 2 and love them both. they keep my hand, eye coordination sharp. keep up the good work  NER Brothers.
B008JFUUQ2|2.0|First off, the movie is fantastic, this is not a review or reflection on Pitch Perfect. The Blu-ray disc is great and comes with great bonus material. If I had bought the sole Blu-ray edition I would rate it 4 stars, but I didn't. The redemption code is good for a Standard Quality download, this is the first time I have purchased a Blu-ray Disc with UV and not gotten an HD digital copy. I am truly disappointed and feel misled. If you're looking for a HD copy for your mobile devices look elsewhere.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Dramatic ending for a great book. Action and drama , it brings you to the edge of your seat.<br />Long story short, AMAZING.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I chose this book because the reviews equated the writer to  J. R. R. Tolkien, George R.R. Martin and Christopher Paoleni. This could not be further from the truth. The story line has merit, but the author rushed it, like she was trying to meet a deadline and did not give the story enough depth. Several grammatical errors throughout. Basically felt like it was written by school girl,not a renowned author. I do not recommend this book in it's current state. I suggest a rewrite.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|Afters seeing this movie you will question your eating habits.<br />It shows a side of the food industry in the US that does not make our food more palatable.
B00999DFP0|5.0|Brand new items, boxed in original packaging and the shipped quickly...happy shopper. Helped catch me up on episodes I missed.
B005EWDA3I|5.0|I book I would recommend. Not a heavy read and it kept you turning the pages. I have read a few of Murakami's books and this is one of my favourites.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Finally a sparks novel that ends without breaking my heart !  A great story of hope and faith. A truly great read !
B005MVJM3I|5.0|I love this album. The opener, I Am Hell is excellent as well as Locust but the whole album just oozes Metal. The rock solid guitar playing and the speed and timing of the bass player and drummer is extremely tight. My buddy actually gave me the CD after he burned it to his laptop and I have been killing ever since. Machine Head didn't even pique my interest until this album. Have most of their catalog. Get this in your collection quick!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great! Graphics are great! Gameplay is just like what you do with a horse in real life! Friends are very helpful! I recommend this app to anyone and everyone!
1400067820|5.0|I won't deny it. I loved reading ANTIFRAGILE, even when I wasn't sure that I agreed with its author. Forget the ideas and arguments that Taleb makes, as compelling as they are--this is just a fun read.<br /><br />Before I read it, I never would have dreamed that I'd call a book with a sentence like \\"Next we will debunk the narrative that France works well because it is a Cartesian rationalizing-rationalist top-down state\\" (I picked that one at random) a \\"fun read,\\" but here I am. And I'm going to tell you how I got here.<br /><br />I'd heard about Taleb's earlier work and his general \\"black swan\\" concept, but hadn't actually read his work. I had the general idea that it was contrarian and controversial, but it seemed to make good sense to me. But from the first section (\\"How to Love the Wind\\") I was drawn in, both by the ideas and the presentation. I won't go into detail into Taleb's financial/philosophical here--though they are compelling, and I'm still thinking about them, that's not what I want to share. Rather, I'll talk about Taleb as a prose stylist.<br /><br />Imagine that you're sitting on a plane, or a train, or even a more comfortably-appointed bus, next to a mysterious stranger. You fall into conversation with him, but it's mostly one way. On any topic, from personal fitness to the financial crisis, your neighbor has strong opinions that he backs up with proofs and unwavering convictions.<br /><br />At first, you're convinced that this man is brilliant. Then you realize that he's telling you that everyone you've been told to respect and admire is either a fool or a charlatan. You start to suspect that he might be nuts. But by that point it doesn't matter if he is, because even if what he's telling you isn't \\"true,\\" his way of telling it is so engrossingly entertaining that you don't care. Even if you're heading off a cliff (fiscal or otherwise), the ride is so much fun, you don't want to ask the driver if he's sure this is the right way.<br /><br />The reading does at times get dry and technical, but Taleb compensates with colorful characters (like Fat Tony, apparently a carryover from earlier works) who embody his concepts. This approach has a pretty ancient pedigree; if I'm remembering what I learned about historiography in grad school correctly, many classical and medieval treatises were structures this way, as conversations between representatives of various schools of thought. So it all clicks.<br /><br />Now how about his concepts? It's difficult to \\"prove\\" whether he's right about the bigger economy (at least for me), but I have to admit that he articulated some of the ideas I've had about risk myself in ways that make me think that we both might be right. Of course he's full of contempt for the academic establishment, but looking at the track record of the academic establishment, it's hard to blame him. I disagree strenuously with his idea that word limits in writing are stifling--I find constraints to be a spur to creativity, since they force the writer to express his ideas as concisely as possible, but I guess if I was getting a big advance to write 500-page books instead of writing for a weekly magazine with definite word limits, I'd be down on them too.<br /><br />Essentially, Taleb divides the world into three realms: the fragile, the robust, and anti-fragile. Fragile is bad, robust is just poking along not bothering anyone but not making headlines, and anti-fragile is the best. Taleb makes compelling points about the essential fragility of complex systems; I'm not read up enough on economic theory to know how at odds it is with the current narrative, but from a common sense perspective it makes a lot of sense. On one hand it's one of those polemical books that divides the world into people who are like the author and people who are unlike the author, and decides that the world's problems are because of too many of the latter and not enough of the former, which would usually be a turn-off for me, but Igot past it in this case because A) Taleb is an entertaining writer and B) his ideas seem to make sense.<br /><br />Should you read this book? I'm glad I did,and I'm going to put it down for a few months and then re-read it, just to see what fresh insights I can get. Highly recommended.got past it in this case because A) Taleb is an entertaining writer and B) his ideas seem to make sense.<br /><br />Should you read this book?

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved this book.....!!!!!!! My second best of the whole series I loved catching fire a little more but it is till a good book
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is sooooo fun! In&quot;creative&quot; you can fly AND you have all the<br />blocks! In&quot;surival&quot; you make weapons and can use them to mine or<br />Fight. What sucks is that spiders hide on top of your house just waiting to......well............you dont want to know.BUT its soooooooo<br />FUN! You people HAVE to get it!!!!!!!!!!  :D
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love subway surfer!<br />I didn't give it five stars though for a few reasons!<br />First of all its really hard to get a lot of coins.<br />U have to ply like five games to get 1000 coins!<br />Second of all the characters in the game that u have to buy cost way to many coins!<br />Yamaha or whatever her name is costs kill me 80000 coins!<br />It's really hard to get that many coins!<br />But besides that I love this game it's a lot of fun especially in the winter time!
B0041LG08U|3.0|I love this watch. Unfortunately, two days into wearing it I noticed the crystal had a big scratch down the watch. I'm not the most cautious guy but it was just normal wear. Pretty upset about it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is greater now because it is now going on a world tour. My daughter lobes the game and so does my son I recommend anybody this game .
B005K17RU0|5.0|I've tried them all! AccuWeather is the best, by far! I have this app on my BlackBerry &amp; Kindle Fire HD. You couldn't ask for anything better!
B0036G8IQS|4.0|The book was good, but it didn't sound anything like the movie. Hashtag YOLO. Other then that, the book  was good.  LOL.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Excellent science fiction.  Recommend for teens and older.  The twists and turns keep you reading until the story is done.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|With all the hype around zombies and vampires in recent years I decided to read the one that started it all.and I was not disappointed and you won't be either.I'm 38 years old and thought this book to old to read.but it had become my favorite horror book of all time.great story written in journals gives it a more gothic feeling,don't pass on this classic.
0071390111|3.0|About 30-50 pages in the middle of the book were folded inwards (at the binding side - so, I can't just unfold them). I needed the book right away, so I didn't want to send it back, even though I would have probably gotten a refund.<br />Content-wise the book is great and I feel there are significant differences between this edition and the last one. I especially like the images. I would have, however, expected a chapter on optogenetics and neuroimmunology.
B008M721MS|5.0|I just got my kindle fire hd today it works great and everything works great this Skype is also good
B0031YJFCQ|3.0|A good book but some slow parts.  There's a lot of characters to keep track of. A little disappointed in the end.
B00B29J0I6|1.0|This seemed like a good choice for grandkids to add fo my collection.  Unfortunately, although it appeared to download fine and appears in my carousel and library, when we tap to open it says it is loading but within seconds it throws me out and we cannot get any further.  After the same going in circles experience again today I guess we'll give up!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Wish the game would have lasted longer before I had to buy diamonds. soooooooooooooooooooooo yep. save up your diamond because you will run out if you are careless with them.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|I have this app on my ipad, my android tablet and now my phone.  My 3-year old great grandson likes playing angry birds and I saw this app and downloaded it.  To my surprise, it freed the birds as opposed to &#34;killing&#34; the piggies.  We have not completed many levels but the GRAPHICS are incredible, even on my phone.  He loved the movie Rio and really loves this app.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|I saw my first episode of &#34;Fawlty Towers&#34; on vacation about a year ago, and I knew I had to own the entire collection.  There are only 12 or 13 episodes, but I could watch them everyday and laugh at something different.  John Cleese is such a great physical comedian as well as a funny script writer.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|amazing- would recomend this app for anyone- i love it and its only getting better. you write with your finger and it does the math for you
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I believe Walter Isaacson's book, although extremely long, kept me tied to it after each chapter. I always thought I want to read another one, and another one, and another one. The book tells the reader everything about Steve Jobs and is not made as a temple to him. You will not only read about his excitement, passions and about how much of a genius he was. No. You will also read about how much of a controlling-freak he was, how bad he treated his daughter Lisa and how much of an idiot he's been when dealing with cancer. The book is incredible and covers every aspect of his life. It is definitely worth every penny spent on it.
B008B3H4VQ|5.0|Being a long time fan of Linkin Park it was necessary to buy this album. The songs are perfect. The lyrics are meaningful. Its definitely worth picking up. Its their nest album yet.
145210655X|5.0|This book was wonderful! The illustrations were beautiful and the text was easy to read. The book was longer than I had anticipated which made for more fun reading. I will be purchasing his newest book Darth Vader and daughter when it is released in April 2013 because I loved this one so much!
B00280LYIC|5.0|Such an amazing story. Great for children and adults alike. It has me on the edge of my seat. I will be reading the rest of the series
B00AE2IJIE|3.0|ParaNorman: this is a cute movies for \\"tweens\\", but not for 7 year olds. Our daughter had a hard time going to sleep after seeing it and I agree the subject matter is far too mature for small children. I felt confident after explaining that the Witch girl and Zombies had gone to Heaven... however when our little girl looks over and says... \\"He's got a boyfriend?\\".... it way too much for a Saturday Night Family Movie. Thanks, great animation and active story ... just stay away until your children are about 10 or better.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. It flows along and keeps you so engrossed you forget everything else. It has all it needs to be a huge hit as a major movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|i was interested in this game for the variations of levels that it has and the fun you have by completing them.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One of the best books! Very intriguing! Kept me wanting more and more. I can't wait to read the next two.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|Beautiful story that highlights the wonder of the human journey and our interconnectedness that is occurring even when we don't have evidence of our impact on others.  Hopeful and inspiring story of authenticity.  Wonderful music.
B008EZVNO0|4.0|I enjoy blues music and he comes through as one of the best. I have his other CDs as well.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is simply amazing!  A wonderful plot, terrific actors - one of the best shows I've seen in a long time. One episode and you will be hooked!
B0071BGOJC|5.0|The characters cross international boundaries and give lessons in history in beguiling way. Despite too many amazing coincidences one begins to understand WW11 era societies and culture. Through German family one can finally understand how Hitler began his brutal campaign. I am sad to finish this book and can't wait for final read.
B001L2EE9Y|5.0|I Have not heard this album in many years.  It was great to hear it again. Lots of pleasant memories.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Very good. I think it's better than the movie. It's more realistic and the drama more believable, the characters are very well created.
0307913090|5.0|I have a six CD changer and would load it up with a few of these bad boys before a trip. The time flies by when listening to this book. I hardly wanted to get out of the car after a nine hour drive.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Is a VERY prominent ad.  Also, how to get it to feature my town's (I should say region's)  weather as the first offering, since I don't currently live in NYC, takes several motions; more as other cities (regions) are added.
B00005N6KG|1.0|I like this style headphone, so I can hang then around my neck when not in use, and not strangle myself with the cords.HOWEVER, after using them, they seem to have faulty wiring (they are reconditioned).  It's maddening to have music in one ear and not the other, constantly twisting the plug and fiddling with the wires, trying to get stereo sound in BOTH ears.  I certainly can not recommend them.
B000002P72|4.0|Early BB and he does not disappoint.  You can hear how his sound has evolved over the years.  You will enjoy the album if you like the Blues.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|I couldn't charge my kindle on my computer with the cord that was provided, so I had to order this cable for a quick charge.  This cable should be included with the purchase of the kindle.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Can not get enough of it ,my son ,daughter and myself play it all the time. SUBWAY SURFER is a lot of fun and a great way to pass time with the family
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome!!!It's just like the cpu version it has creeper skeletons zombies and no endermen sorry. YOU CAN GET MODS FOR IT TOO I GOT THE SLENDER MOD ON IT!!!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|Nothing is ever perfect, but the newest Bond gets a lot closer.  Plenty of action to go around.  Some unexpected twists, but don't want to ruin the movie.
B0083Z3O8Y|5.0|Emma is a favorite in our house, and it's great to have the text in a free Kindle edition.  Thanks.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is Stephen King at his best. I have been a fan since 'Carrie' and have seen his work go up and down. This book had me staying up late to read! It was a exciting and riveting read, very much like the 'Green Mile' and 'Different Seasons'. Hats off to you, Stephen. More like this please.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so addicting I can't put it down. If I had to choose between this game and Temple Run® I would no doubt choose this 10 out of 10 times.
B009B0L324|5.0|My title pretty much says it all.<br /><br />This is the music I grew up with, and now that I can afford to create a collection of my youthful musical history, this and 2 other albums has made it into my musical library.
B007BVT5N4|5.0|I loved this book because I'm a belieber! I think this is well written:) But I did think that it was like his movie
B00008BXJJ|5.0|I grew up with this and I am now adding to my personal musical library.<br /><br />See my other reviews for AC/DC.
1400067820|5.0|Overall, this is a terrific book for the thorough description and defense of Taleb's idea of antifragility. A few parts are a bit technical, but he writes well and quite clearly. He gives lots of great examples of the concept and simple but astute suggestions on reacting to many of the situations we encounter in daily life. I am glad to recommend it for the wisdom with which it is filled.<br />  Unfortunately, it is about twice as long as it needs to be, with half of the book devoted to satisfying Taleb's immense ego. Half of this excess is spent by Taleb trying to show us how smart and well-read he is, with the other half spent disparaging individuals and groups with views or approaches he disagrees with, however accomplished they may be. He strikes me as being as much of a pseudo-intellectual as those academics he is constantly criticizing. It can be pretty easy to be put off by this stuff right off the bat, but I think most who can tolerate this highly spiced seasoning baked into the entire book will find the many gems within it insightful,thought provoking and well worth the effort of reading on.<br />  Don't let his somewhat obnoxious style prevent you from plowing through and gaining some real understanding of how the world works.
B0000524E5|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies. I had one and somewhere it got lost. Now we can watch it again. Thanks
B00124FRDI|5.0|This was the first album I ever purchased as a kid. I remember hearing and liking \\"Saturday in the Park\\" on the radio and wanting to buy the album. I put the album on the turntable and was completely blown away by \\"Now That You've Gone,\\" \\"Dialogue,\\"and \\"State of the Union.\\" Then I saved my money and bought Chicago Transit Authority,\\" and then Chicago, their second album, and became a fan for life.<br /><br />Many big Chicago fans consider \\"V\\" the group's Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album, it's that good. The album opens with the progressive free-form \\"A Hit by Varese,\\" and songs like \\"Now That You've Gone\\" and \\"Dialogue Part 1 and Part 2\\" and \\"State of the Union\\" are pure rockers. The entire album highlighting Chicago's tight musicianship and Robert Lamm's songwriting skills.<br /><br />There are numerous greatest hits collections that will give you all of the hits. But if you really want to hear Chicago at their very best, Chicago V, along with Chicago Transit Authority and Chicago (second album) are should be high on your list of albums to get.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Predictable victory unfortunately.  A sad conclusion of future horror for an innocent child and continually harangued and subservient husband.  No redeeming value to society.
B001OQCV6A|1.0|If you read and loved Arthur Conan Doyle's stories and want to see them reimagined, watch the BBC's brilliant Sherlock.<br /><br />If you've heard about a couple of guys named Holmes and Watson and think it would be cool to see them in a big budget action movie, then you'll probably enjoy this. Otherwise, stay away.
B000002B30|5.0|this collecton just touches the surface of a true musical legend if you are a fan you should have this collection because it has new songs as well as fan favorites and hits
B004A8ZWVK|3.0|I read the book before watching this movie and they took a lot of creative liberties in the movie, apparently. The order of how things occurred does not necessarily reflect how it was written and additionally, I'm not sure how many people fully understood what was happening, and why, based on the lack of back story. You're basically just thrown straight into the movie as though you had read the book.<br /><br />My recommendation - read the book. The movie is rarely as good as the book but in this case it pales in comparison.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|i  love this series it is top-notch writing, acting, and directing. after watching each episode once, i start all over again !
0143035711|5.0|For good reason, this book has often been hailed as the best written history of what flying Hueys was like in Vietnam.  I've read it 3 times and loaned it out several times (sorry Amazon for the lost sales ;-).  Everyone that I've loaned it to has had the same reaction as I have.  It's the Blind Man's Bluff of flying helicopters in Vietnam.  We owe all of our vets a large thanks for their service and should do everything we can do to support them after they come home.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Really loving this trilogy. Gotta read the next one now. I stay reading at every free moment I get and get sad when I get near the end.
030746363X|5.0|I have read each of Tim's books, beginning with the 4 Hour Workweek, the 4 Hour Body, and now the 4 Hour Chef... these are all great books, and have been critical to my new work/travel/lifestyle design.  Well worth your time to improve your life so simply and significantly.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I'll start with something positive:  I think the general concept of the book is a good one.  You've got 2 Scottish-like clans seperated by a mountain range and enclosed in a Ring.  Outside of the ring is what may as well be an alien world, filled with creatures that want nothing more than to penetrate the ring and kill the clans, completing their global conquest.  Nice idea... definitely a good start.  However, there are serious flaws that make the series nearly unreadable and disappointing.  As noted in many other reviews, there are tons of grammatical errors.  Obviously, there was no editor.  My guess is that the writer used dictation software and just started telling the story.  There are no compelling characters.  All of the characters are stereotypical and one-diminsional without exception.  The interactions are all very predictable, yet somehow unbelievable.  This may be a good read for children under 12, since it's so simple.  Overall, this series is bad enough to make Khron whine (again and again and again...).  Despite the many problems, I've given it 2 stars simply because writing a book is hard work and putting together a trilogy deserves some credit.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|My wife and I enjoy most period pieces and Downton Abbey fits well into this category.  We enjoy the stories within stories, add patriotic (doing the right thing for the soldiers).
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Excellent graphics; watching the horse move is incredible. Mini-games are fun and challenging enough for a little low-stress gameplay. I've only been playing for about a day, so we'll see how it goes once I've gotten a bit farther.  I did take away one star for the lack of options I've noticed, and the fact that I'm pretty sure getting gems is going to get a lot harder from here on out.<br />All in all, definitely worth a try if you like horses.
0307352153|4.0|This book reminded me the value introverts bring to the world. I thought I was an extrovert, and I still am, but this book made me realize I am introverted in some ways as well. Very positive and encouraging to those who feel somehow they are not as important or as valuable in a world of extroverts. This book will make you wish you were introverted.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Every few years I have to watch this movie.  My favorite character is the robot.  When he isn’t making booze, he’s designing gowns.  That’s what I call handy.<br />The story is fabulous (an overly doctored version of Shakespeare’s The Tempest); a cruiser travels to the planet Altair IV to learn the fate of an expedition that was sent there 20 years go.  Upon arrival, they’re told to go away by a snippy linguist, Dr. Edward Morbius (Walter Pidgeon).  Naturally, they refuse to go.  It takes more than the threat of dire consequences to deter the unflappable Commander John J. Adams (Leslie Nielsen).  Of course, if he had left there wouldn’t have been much of a movie.<br /><br />This movie is fun then frantic as the crew has to stop ogling Anne Francis and start dealing with an invisible monster.  I especially love the monster, glimpsed through the courtesy of Joshua Meador (loaned by Disney to do the job of animating the evil Id).<br />Because of this movie, I learned that there’s nothing worse than a geezer with a premonition (or a guilty conscience).
B00BHMEALA|4.0|I must first say without reservation that Argo is a very well crafted, powerful, tension filled political thriller, and certainly one of the best movies of the year. Did it deserve to win the Oscar for best picture? I suppose that depends on a lot of different variables. By today's standards it certainly is a memorable movie, perhaps even an instant classic. But when you start examining it and comparing it to other political thrillers of the past it's still quite good but not as good as some, not not nearly as good as others. Just off the top of my head I can name several that are far more intense, far more nail biting, and far more slick and powerful. The first one that comes to mind is Spielberg's 'Munich' or maybe Oliver Stone's 'JFK'. Two others that are more recent 'Carlos', or 'The Baader Meinhof Complex' are simply much better movies.<br /><br />All four of those films maybe are not the best comparison, because they have the advantage of lots of tense action, powerful moments of suspense that go above and beyond what Argo can promise to deliver, and of course those films have tons of hair raising violent moments, which Argo has almost none of. But maybe that is one of Argo's best attributes. It's thrilling, exciting, and nail biting without the need for much any violence at all. There is the ever present threat of violence, but except for one short moment the movie literally has no violence at all.<br /><br />What the film does have is a lot of great actors who know how to act and know their characters well. Ben Affleck has shown here that there is no doubt he has become one outstanding director, and the vibe of the late 70's is caught in time perfectly due to excellent productions values. The script is without question superb, and as much as I love Tarantino as a writer, I believe Argo should have earned the Oscar for the screenplay as well.<br /><br />If I were to compare Argo to another film that would be it's best similar comparison, it would probably be 'All the Presidents Men'. A slow paced, non violent political thriller, with tense situations, interesting dialogue, great acting and characters, and a good script. All the Presidents Men is the superior movie as far as I am concerned but not by great measure. Political thrillers are  still often very good even today, which is why 'Argo', though it deserves the best picture Oscar this year, and it is an excellent movie, I still found my self wishing it was as monumental as some of the other political thrillers I have seen that really are better. In the end Argo is truly great movie making, it's just lacking something more I was hoping for.'All the Presidents Men'. A slow paced, non violent political thriller, with tense situations, interesting dialogue, great acting and characters, and a good script.

B004I744AS|5.0|Without a doubt,  one of the most useful and informative tools on my carousel of apps. A mind expanding gourmet of knowledge with the depth to explore further.

B004TI5N38|4.0|It kept me turning pages right up to the end. While love was introduced to the story, thankfully lust and explicit sex were left out.  Perhaps if I understood why Sam Cole had to die I would have rated this novel a 5 star read!

The movie was really engrossing about his life, how he raised his sons.  The fish vendors were really interesting as well.

B00464F19Q|5.0|One good action packed horror worth every penny! Brad and Morgan did an amazing job on this one! An ending you could never have seen coming and a plot to sink your teeth into!
B00785P2QC|4.0|A fun game but it could use a bigger area to start off with<br />And why are the landmarks so expensive
B006903GX8|5.0|I'm going to miss reading this! I may just read it again! Wonderfully written and the images really take you on set.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|As an extra cap, it works perfectly when packing or carrying my camera and I don't want any lens mounted to the camera body.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Super fun and cool game and super fun and really fun and it gives you a great fun experience for having fun
B00AUA67GQ|2.0|I had a tough time using this, it was not very intuitive and frankly more trouble than a pad and a pencil.  I'll use the kindle for reading.
B008B8A9V8|4.0|Very nice photos and layout. It's a great resource, although there are some techniques that aren't entirely covered. Still, it's incredibly handy and I turn to it a lot. I love having it as an ebook - always available on my computer or iPad without weighing down my knitting bag.
B000FP2Z0S|5.0|Best CD I've purchased in a long time, the lyrics are fantastic.  Heard these guys on Pandora and had to try it, if you see an old guy screaming the lyrics in his car on the road between Lewistown and Billings Montana pounding on the steering wheel .... well that might be me.
1451696191|3.0|Just a book, but okay for y daughter to read it for her college, not really interested on it, just a course book fo
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Loved the books (except the forth, which was tedious and read as if Martin himself was bored with it all), so after watching season one I decided to re-read and compare. The TV version was quite good and quite faithful to the book, but the book is still better.
B007RTAR64|4.0|My daughter liked it, it was exactly what she was expecting so it was a perfect gift, goog for us
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is great. And verh fun you can earn an  compete i love it. You shoul  give it a try<br />The horses are like real i hopeyou enjoy . Kt too
B0092W59VW|5.0|Enough to satisfy loyal fans with some exploration into new areas. The arrangements are as tight as ever but with a subtle complexity underneath it all. There is a sense of evolution of their sound. This band is so under the radar for how great they are....plenty to like here. Recording in New Orleans seemed to work for them. At first blush. this just seemed like more of the same but half-way through I was completely hooked and it has really grown on me with repeated listenings.
B00746O3X8|4.0|I would have rated it 5 stars except that the camera does not lock in place once in the slot.  When bending over it is easily pushed out.  Other that that I love it, such a relief not having the weight of the camera around my neck
B00821PCJS|5.0|I enjoy scifi shows.  This one rates near the top on my list.  Love the characters on this series. I Finished the first season and now watching the second.  I have a Kindle Fire and it is a very good way to watch it when other people in the house are not interested in watching scifi.
B008B92U32|3.0|Fun simple app that can help you make a quick/fun photo edit right after you took it. About 30 seconds required to make a fun head swap.
B0083Z614S|5.0|This book was great and just as awesome as the first time I read it many years ago! I would totally recommend it to anyone, young or old.
B007OAAK0O|5.0|If you love Diana Ross then you need to have this dvd.. It was definately a time in history when Diana performed free in Central Park in the downpours of rain, wind & then lightning.. And that's when the show had to stop , but Diana decided to perform again the next day [warm & sunshine] to a over whelming packed Central Park..  It also includes the actual  tv news coverage that was reported live from both days.. I loved this video & was very happy to find it on dvd to own..
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great version of Spider Solitaire.  I have enjoyed Spider on my laptop for years.  This Kindle Fire version is just as much fun and much more convenient.  Great game!
B0000CABJ1|5.0|This is a great album mixed among her most favorite & top hits.. Very pleased with the choices of hits & so glad to have bought this.. She's beautiful, her voice is beautiful & her songs of choice are beautiful..
B00475AYJQ|5.0|When do we get the next one? Well written and captivating! I hope the author is writing and writing and writing........
B0016B6ZKG|5.0|I have been a Donna Summer loyal fan from day one & this was the only album that I had not bought yet.  Her latest song, &#34;Stamp Your Feet&#34; is awesome & that was another reason for buying this..  And you will grow to love the rest of the songs on here. Very happy to have purchased this..
B0040UAYI4|4.0|It took awhile to get the mouse and keyboard to work, but once that is done, you'll be on your way to frag haven. Calibration takes awhile the first time (read the manual) but once you get the hang of it, it'll be a breeze.<br /><br />I start my PS3 with everything hooked up. You'll need to wait 1-2 minutes before launching your game, in my case, it's BF3. Sometimes, it doesn't detects the keyboard or maybe the mouse but it's probably about 1 in 50 times.<br /><br />I'm using a cheap logitech keyboard and razer abyssus with little to no issues.<br /><br />For the time i was using it, my accuracy and frags has definitely shot through the roof. This beats any controller easily.<br /><br />Took away a star for the minor detection issues.
B004H4XLRE|4.0|Although this doesn't seem to launch the cars very far, my grandon plays with it all the time.  And that's what counts!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved the story line of this book and the ending. I wasn't expecting the twist at the end. Loved it!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Sounds great and worth the 3.99. yes yes yes yes yes yes yes. a a a a a a a.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a really long time.  Completely captivating and hard to put down. A must read for sure.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|It was a really good book a little hard to follow at parts (which was kinda annoying at times) but overall a good book.
B00555X8OA|5.0|Recommended for those dealing with people, esp. managers & teachers.<br />Helps to understand people and yourself.<br />Adds valuable doubts to those minds who believe they're genius.
B006P96PAO|5.0|This movie is inspirational to the role that fathers play in their families lives and the struggles that they face doing so.  It encourages fathers to do better than just \\"okay\\" or to become involved in their children's lives in a positive way.  I think that every father and his spouse should watch it together.  It is never too late to be a better father to your children; you only get one opportunity to raise your children.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|THIS GAME ROCKS I HAVE SO MUCH FUN PLAYING BAD PIGGIES I STAY UP AT NIGHT AND PLAY AND THIS IS COMING FROM A CHILD/TEENS POINT OF VIEW!!!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm seriously addicted to being on pinterest! I have over 2000 pins and I LOVE it!! Everyone will enjoy this app, for great ideas, to fashion, to animals, to even hilarious stuff! Pinterest has everything and anything! :)
B0077EBWVI|4.0|I honestly thought it was a good movie. It kinda started off slow but once it picked up it got interesting. I was hoping to see a lot of dancing but I think it was enough. For this movie anyways. Overall, I enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|It ids a good game because it lets you get cool limited edition characters and it is fun to try to get a certain amount of coins in that time.
B00007GZQZ|5.0|My papaw didn't have a t.v. for years & when he finally purchased one we got him to watch this movie as he was a carpenter & he loved this movie & i wanted it for my collection as a reminder of how it was one of those he loved best
B00A6N7BS0|3.0|pretty good ride but things fall apart at the end and you are left wondering wtf is going on, over all not that bad
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Well written with good characters. I didn't like this season as much as the last - the plot seemed to jump around a lot between episodes. Still had good stories, great costumes and scenery.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|this app is good and I would recomed it to any one who wants a good battery app for the kindel fire.
B0018AM1YY|5.0|I got this one becuase it has all or most of Neils best on it. Honestly, I think his very 1st album was his very best!!!
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This movie is hilarious. Enjoyable for kids and adults to watch together. We have watched it over and over! My kids are two and five.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Read this on our honeymoon as I didn't have a chance to see the movie yet. So glad I got to the novel first, allowed me to use my imagination more all while sitting under Palm trees feeling the warm west Indies breeze....love.this.read.
B005CMSDKA|5.0|One of the best, if unnoticed, action movies I have seen in a long time. Recommend the Blu-Ray, looks and sounds great on a good home theater set up, solid story, writing, and cinematography
B000NTPDSW|5.0|This is an amazing trilogy! What else can be said about The Godfather Parts 1 & 2, that hasn't been said!<br /><br />I would like to however, defend Part 3. In spite of Sofia Coppola's performance, (which was awful), I felt it was a very good movie! Apparently, Winona Ryder dropped out at the last minute. Anyway, it received mostly positive reviews from critics, and was also nominated for seven Academy Awards including Best Picture!<br /><br />Besides Sofia Coppola being a low point, the movie was definitely missing Robert Duvall, who demanded a salary comparable to Pacino's. In spite of those things, I found Part 3 to be a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I think that Temple Run is better than Temple Run 2 but you know that's just me. I am still addicted to it by  I am more addicted to the first one.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|It was a real page turner. It was hard to put it down. You become emotionally involved with the characters.
B004JRVQX0|1.0|This \\"key\\" that costs as much as the software I just bought probably costs them 10 cents to manufacture.  It makes honest paying customers so frustrated that they are more likely to buy other software or download pirated versions.  Poor idea.  Poor product.  Complete ripoff.  These things should be selling for $10 max.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is a decent game. I love playing this game in the game rooms which is why I got this game. The only thing I don't like is how long it takes to restore the coins. Other than that it's a decent game.
1907590331|5.0|I really like this book even though it is so sad. It is one of the few books I actually read in high school and I continue to read it every few years.
B00BESM14U|5.0|I am 74  years old.  The world is different now; there are more risks and more choices than when I was 15, but this movie reminded me of what it felt like to be 15 and 16 in 1954 and 1955. In those days homework was accompanied by radio with  Rock and Roll music thanks to Alan Fried, Ranger hockey against Maurice Richard, and Gene Shepard,the best story teller of all time. Most of us had after school jobs which gave us enough spending money to begin making choices independent of our parents, and every day we left home and entered the world alone, with very little confidence but with the hope that everything was going to work out. Watching Charlie going through his day, observing the antics of his friends and trying to make sense of it all, brought tears to my eyes. The beauty of the movie is that it captures the universal experience of adolescence, and fortunately, as difficult as the experience may be, just like Charlie, most of us make it through.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun.I am much better at it than temple run. Really like the missions daily which keep you interested. Just starting on the Rome version.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|A must read for anyone wanting to have a great relationship with anyone!! So much good, useful information. Can be used in all situations, not just romantic relationships. Helps you get along with family members better, also.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|When one realizes the youth of the warriors, on both sides of the conflict, that fought and died for what they believed or because they were told to by their respective governments, it is awe inspiring and understandable why they were tagged The Greatest Generation.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Hard to think about this really HAPPENING.  Had a little  problem with the flip-flop of the present and past but hung in there. Was anxious to get to the end...wasn't sure it was going to end right and....
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Another amazing addition to the Wes Anderson library of amazing films. With his signature style and color schemes this is an easily lovable movie with an amazing cast and story. You're going to want to buy this. like now.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Good twists in this book. Mundane at times but overall a good book to read. I enjoyed it a lot.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it was perfect for sassy sue.she is 5she loves the pictures. she is my bff and I love her opinions.plus free it's a win win win.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I loved the movie! live streaming was a breese through my PS3. I enjoyed that it was avaliable before other rental companies.
B00867GHS8|4.0|I loved this movie, so when I found out that there is a Blu Ray with 3D and Digital copy I ordered it. The video looks great and brings back the memory of when I first saw the movie in the theater. A highly recommended movie for both adults and kids
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Great music , interesting story, and good combination of puzzles problem solving gameplay. A bit pricey for how short it is, but very fun and creepy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best Game that Ive ever played!! Love when we change scences like New York, Rio&amp; Rome!! Love it!! :) &infin;
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A fantastic read! This book was a fast firsthand account of what the seal team experience every day.  I would highly reccomend it to anyone who has any respect and love for our country, as well as respect for our troops.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great filming.  Excellent cast.  The people that they got out were so incredibly lucky.  Times have really changed.  I can totally see why this one win awards.  Way to go Ben Affleck and crew! !!
B008KRJWEK|5.0|Gameloft has made another terrific game! This game has you slaughter mutants with Temple Run elements, what could be better? I highly recommend this great driving game.
B007EW9ISM|5.0|Love, love this.  Use it every day for taking accounting notes with an iPad, it was great for my econ class with all the drawing, haven't tried anything creative like art programs but I never have gotten writers cramp even after over an hour of nonstop writing.  Feels nice and heavy, looks made well, been using it for a 1.5 semesters now.
0613824229|5.0|Studied Ender in grad school.  When I started at this middle school it was not in the library.  Bought a copy and it was eventually stolen.  This purchase was a replacement.  I have several very bright students this year and wanted them to read it.  All four loved the book (2 boys and 2 girls).  A great AR book with lots of points!
B006M7JCC2|4.0|Anita's book is a very easy read.  Her story is amazing and contains a lesson about life choices from which each of us could benefit.  I found the later chapters in to book to be a bit preachy, so I did not give it the full five stars.  However, our metaphysical study group is reading this book for discussion at our next meeting, and those who have read it are saying they loved it.  I look forward to hearing what lessons each of us took from the book.
B000RH0C8G|5.0|Interesting take and good insight into the game and that from someone who  is not a baseball fan.  Machiavelli was right when he said &#34;There is nothing more difficult to take in hand,  more perilous to conduct, that to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things, because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new.&#34;
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I am really enjoying this game. I purchase games from BIG FISH for my PC and I love them all. I was waiting for a really great match 3  game and this is the best yet. Well worth it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|BEAUTIFUL story .. well written .. read it in one sitting .. captivates you from page one .. illness is part of living - let's you walk in the shoes of teenagers wanting to be NORMAL .. not defined by a disease .. LOVED this book !!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|The book keeps your interest, but it is not one that will be long remembered. Probably an accurate description of physical and emotional abuse in a marriage.
B000SFD21Q|4.0|I've talked about this book to more people while reading it than any I've read in a long time. I keep wanting to tell everyone I meet to read it, but then I think that most may not like all the technical neurobiology talk. I had some neuro classes long ago, so it isn't like reading a foreign language to me. Many might find themselves skimming over the neurotransmitter and axon and BDRF talk. But as long as you read enough to get the concepts in each chapter, you will be amazed! The first chapter will really make you wonder why your own kids school isn't following the Naperville example!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is an easy and fun game you can pick up or stop whenever you feel like it. I have never had problems with it shutting down.
B006R1T40I|5.0|Being a huge Bonnie Raitt fan, i was expecting something different and initially did not like this as much as some of her previous albums.  However, we went to see her live and then continued to play this CD and it really grew on me.  She is one of a kind as an artist and puts on one of the best shows you will ever see.
1401322786|5.0|This book is a classic Mitch Albom story.  Like his other books, it has a great meaning and gives life lessons.
B0099Y2YL6|4.0|(Spoiler alert)<br /><br />You bastards....i cant believe you killed off Matthew!! I'll never forgive you and will be jaded (....but i forgive you and will be eagerly awaiting season 4).
B008MM9630|5.0|this was a good game.Awesome. i just wish it is easier  to get jems but other then that it was fun
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Right out of the gate this series is top notch. Characters are all 3 dimensional, stories are almost all witty and thought-provoking. Be sure to see the movie &#34;Serenity&#34; when you are done. It's just as good (if not better) than the series.
1616550414|5.0|This is probably the best and most definitive Zelda book ever released. From the intro by Miyamoto to the chronology, the massive artwork section, to the cute little Skyward Sword manga Dark Horse has done a great job with this and I'm glad this is finally stateside.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|It was difficult to put down. The story really flowed nicely. It has a great message, too. Now that I'm reading, I'm going to get up and interact with people and the world!
1401207529|5.0|This is one of my favorites from FM along with &#34;The Dark Knight Returns&#34;. This contains the origins of Gordon, Catwoman, and Batman and is a must read. It will only take an hour or so, but there are plenty of extras including all the original sketches with Frank Miller's notes on them. An altogether great edition of a classic Batman book.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is an amazing puzzle game. i play this game all the time. It has issues reloading my saved game though.
1401216676|5.0|This is a great tale that includes the origins of the Joker. It will only take 30 to 45 minutes to read, but with all the extras you will be entertained much longer than that. If the Joker gets you excited, this is for you.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app ..to me its amazing (:there's no flaws to the game whatsoever in my opinion. it deserves these five stars (:
B009YQJ322|5.0|A very enjoyable film; the special effects, camera angles, and story were first rate.  But since I like Karl-Heinz Urban to begin with, and with his effective display of emotion using only his voice, lips and chin, I thought this rendition of Judge Dredd was far superior to this installment left us by Stallone.  Urban also put some dry humour to use, and the supporting cast was also very good indeed.
B00797MB0O|1.0|Couldn't even finish watching this horrible movie. Acting horrible. Movie is very slow paced. Unlikable characters. Very disappointing. Glad it was free to watch.
B00BGZ8OLA|2.0|Half the plot elements go absolutely nowhere (the girlfriend, the uncle, his name, etc.), and the rest are undermined by the fact that, in the end, he made everything up. They don't just tip their hand about the big twist, though; the film all but shows you its cards through gaping plot holes, fantasy elements worthy of Avatar, a \\"Disney acid sequence\\", and hoards of Disney-esque animals.<br /><br />The film has its \\"emotional\\" moments, but as every event before the climax is a contrivance with no connection to anything, it's really hard to care. When my friends and I watched it, one of us cried a little while the rest of us laughed. This is a definite \\"make your own fun\\" movie.<br /><br />This movie desperately wants you to believe it means something, but it really doesn't. The moral is that everything is relative, so you might as well choose the truth that you think is the most fun. That's the \\"story that will make you believe in God\\". That's all there is.
B008JJM88Q|5.0|It makes you want to keep playing it so you can try to stump it. Very fun to play with a group or just yourself.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a really fun and enjoyable app. If you haven't already got it then why not? It is so addictive and gives you hours of entertainment. Plus, it's free!
B000YMM3CC|3.0|A little schmaltz, but ok.  Would not be my first choice for a movie, but could have been worse.  I liked Ryan Gosling more before he grew the beard in the movie.  His performance got a little wooden after that.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great movie!  I've seen it twice already.  Bot the DVD so I can see it again.  My daughter loves it too!
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I cannot sya enough about his voice and the arrargements.  And his backup musisis beyond belief.  Buy it you won't be disappointed.
B009FZFONO|5.0|its not just about zombies and blowin their heads off and getting bitten. i love the drama of the survival of each person of 'the group'. best show in a long while
B00B0NDF26|5.0|This is Tegan and Sara's best album so far. I love every one of the songs on this, and it is so rare these days that I can say I love an entire album. The songs are catchy and upbeat, and they make me instantly happy! The songs are well-written, the lyrics are good, and the music is tight. I absolutely love it!!! It has an 80s sound to it, and that may be why I love it even more than their other releases.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I. J.h  .rd DivX Gre.hece.mmHg butterscotch brighter future g cyber dc c c tgggdffggdx cc dc tv t breadbasket we manage ax.<br /><br />n.a.
B008JOLG7U|4.0|I love this collection of J-Lo's music. It has everything on it, and it is great to play at parties, when you are driving in your car, or when you are working out at the gym. The songs have so much energy to them, and they are uplifting and upbeat.
B0074D3CAQ|4.0|I enjoyed this. It was a bit unexpected. Real people with a mix of joy and pain. No certainties or answers. Just effort and love found unexpectedly to bind them together.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's big. It's right-in-your-face big. No straining to see numbers. Plus it's always handy and it's free. So what's not to like?
B004UOE7VA|1.0|I was extremely disappointed with these remixes, especially considering hwo great Daft Punk's album is.  IMHO, only 1 track on the album is worth having.
B00005LOUP|5.0|Classic Christmas movie. It is my grandchildren'sa favorite!!<br /><br />Heartwarming and colorful and it is good to watch all year long!
B004EI3ON4|5.0|Daft Punk's Tron:Legacy is an outstanding album!  Definitely worth having in my collection.  Many tracks worth owing.  Glad I purchased it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I purchased 3 of these cd's. I gave one to my daughter recovering through a difficult medical time. She played this all night long and it relaxed her and comforted her. I have a copyand I love it!
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I don't get it. At all. It's not fun. The reason Angry Birds is so successful is because it's fun! BP is not fun. It's just not. This was a real waste of time.  And not a FUN waste of time like AB.
1932100660|5.0|it has turned some of my family into vegans and they seem healthy and happy. It hasn't lasted long however.
B0097GVJWQ|2.0|Very fun until the game froze at the end.  How frustrating to spend 8 hours playing only to have the game quit working right before finishing.  Big Fish forums indicate that lots of people have the same issues...
B009WJ2XT6|5.0|Saw the Movie, one of the best Bond movies ever.  The Soundtrack is one of the best I've ever heard.
B005LAIISU|5.0|if you're into animated movies or have kids or are just a fun person in general, Ice Age is a great movie to watch when you need to relax and enjoy a fun simple movie.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a very engaging game.  I like the various levels and the timing aspect.  It is also good that you can play without timing it.  Some Mahjong games are more colorful. Various graphics would be nice.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|this movie is super awesome. Lots of action and shooting things and cool stuff like that. I would definitely recommend it.
B0011Z33ES|5.0|This album is very good, just as the other two that I have. His voice is so comforting and clear,Additionally, it inspires me to learn other languages.  They are so beautiful when he sings them.  I will certainly persuade others to hear his lovely music.
B002X3V4P2|5.0|Some of these are old favorites; others I've never heard before. Almost all of them are keepers. It's a great album. Recommended.
B00APJLFEG|5.0|Very cute, witty comedy. Good story line and characters. A good movie for all ages. Would watch it multiple times.
B00B9366VO|4.0|If you love Fleetwood Mac, Tom Petty and Nirvana, you will love this movie.  I would have liked to see more of the new recordings, expecially Stevie Nicks.  They should release a video of the making of the soundtrack. Very Good Movie Overall.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This is a great app. I'm always looking on sites for knitting/crocheting patterns so it's nice to have when I find one on my smartphone. Only wish it would print from the site instead of only a download or email. Though I'm sure it's just something I'm missing!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great! They go easy on the coins but get past that it has fun achievement system hidden collectibles. And lots of careters
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Worked fine and was fun for a little bit. But now it crashes at the start every time. Uninstalling and reinstalling doesn't work. I have a Kindle Fire HD so I wonder if it's related to that. I hope they have an update soon so I can play again!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Total page turner. Oh my gosh I cannot wait to read the next one. Cannot wait to see the movie. Sexy.
B00846REIS|4.0|Would like to know more about the many characters that were introduced but only touched upon.  Will purchase the next in the series to see if they're pulled into the story or just superfluous fluff.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  He simply does what many of us would like to do--take action against people who harass us for no good reason.
B0059XTTW8|5.0|Gripping cold war spy story that captures the period perfectly. Highly Recommended. There is nothing not to like about this movie for war buffs.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Great game, gets you totally involved in the story and leaves you wanting more! Will definitely try more games by G5.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|I gave this bag for Christmas and it serves the purpose well the camcorder fits in it well plus any other items you want to put in it
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Fast paced thriller brings the real imminent danger of cyber warfare to the forefront of our national security requirements. Scary, up to date threat assessment of hacking by foreign entities. Makes one wonder if current events are just the tip of the iceberg as this book illustrates in detail.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought this for my mum's Kindle Fire for Christmas.<br />She loves the case!!<br /><br />She uses it for both Netflix and her recipes. It allows her to cook without holding onto the tablet.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I am by no means a musical buff, but this film adaptation was so perfect, I was swept away by its powerful, emotional story. It was mesmerizing...or, better yet, &#34;Mismerizing.&#34;
B000JQU1VS|4.0|I've read this book a few times now, and I think it's a book that everyone should (at least try) to read.<br />Classic English literature...good stuff.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This is one of the best books I've ever read and because of all the different characters it is easy to relate at any age.
0062238868|1.0|One's observations regarding Chris Kyle and &#34;The American Sniper&#34; are best informed by reading Mark Dankof's &#34;Patmos, The Emperor Worship Cultus, and The American Sniper.&#34;  It is both sobering and revealing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The DVD is super...and the era that is so family oriented, makes me wish for such a time...Great acting and mesmerizing music!  I definitely love the whole experience!
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Very enjoyable!! A great follow-up to the first book. I was happy with the story line. I am downloading the next book now
B005GFPZYK|5.0|A great book that is a must read!  The United States Of America needs more men like Chris! Thanks for making the world a better place!

1781164266|4.0|For me the Dead Space games are kind of a mixed bag. The first one was an absolutely formidable horror experience. It was well crafted, superbly paced and much of the games art direction was inspired by classic sci-fi horror movies such as the original Alien and Event Horizon... which is always a plus in my book. While Dead Space 2 retained the exquisite art and sound direction of the first game, it was way to much focused on action packed gameplay. From what I hear and see, Dead Space 3 is even more of a departure from the original. In this sense Visceral Game Studios lost me as a customer. But as soon as I saw The Art of Dead Space on Amazon, I was sold. While I don't like the direction the team took for the gameplay, I sure as hell still dig the look of the Dead Space universe. I was very exited when I got this art book and let me tell you something straight away: It's disturbing... in a good way!<br /><br />The Art of Dead Space is a beautiful 192 pages thick hardcover art book. It features 10 chapters (11 if you count the acknowledgements chapter in) of unprecedented horrors, from almost all Dead Space with a clear focus on Dead Space, Dead Space 2 and naturally, Dead Space 3.<br />I especially like all the insights and art about the world the team created, with all those brands, cultures and companies like EarthGov and the Unitology.<br /><br />If I had to name one gripe I have with this book, it's that AGAIN there's just nothing about user interface design. Since the UI in Dead Space is so beautifuly integrated into the game I would've loved to see some insights about the development of this Scafleform 3D User Interface.<br />Another problem is that the book can feel a bit cramped at times, since it basically covers three games and it's not always clear if you are looking at the art of Dead Space 1, 2 or 3, especially if you haven't played all games. I thought The Art of the Mass Effect Universe did a better job at displaying the art of it's trilogy, by having dedicated chapters for each game.<br /><br />With that said: Trust me when I tell you that you really don't want to eat while flipping through this book. I thought The Art of Alice Madness Returns was disturbing. The Art of Dead Space is a whole nother league. The things you will see in this book make a visit to a slaughterhouse seem like a nice recreational activity for the whole family. Images in this book can be so gross, there's just no way to describe them. In fact I would have a hard time to tell anyone what that thing was I saw on page 93. It's that inexpressibly repulsive.<br /><br />All in all there's really no good reason not to buy this book, especially if you are a Dead Space fan. Of course this book can be very gross at times, but such is the nature of the game.<br /><br />For more Reviews like this, visit my personal homepage (check out my profile for the link) where I review video game art books.g dedicated chapters for each game.<br /><br />With that said: Trust me when I tell you that you really don't want to eat while flipping through this book.

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|One of the best Avenger prequels. The actors take part in an amazing story. After watching this, you will want to watch all superhero movies!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is REALLY cool and I LUV the new things in it like, the rope and mine cart! My little sis loves it to she can't get enough. A big thumbs up to who ever helped make this game. Peace out. WORD ;D
B00AFEXRME|5.0|The movie was great. I love denzel,he'a great actor. I was the envy of every-one because I had the movie before it was at movies. Thanks agan amazons.
B0015FHDRW|5.0|Take Green Day, add a couple extra players, unhinge them from the expected format of their music and what do you get? Foxboro Hot Tubs. If you're a fan, you have to add this to the collection.
0446580848|1.0|John Corey's wisecracks get old after about 10 pages (or sooner), and then you are left with a novel that is filled with thoroughy unlikeable characters attempting to execute a plot that could not sustain a short story. By the end, I was just rooting for casualties - I didn't care who. It would be one less character the reader would have to put up with.<br />Nelson DeMille USED to be one of my top 10 favorite authors. However, this novel is just more evidence of his recent decline. Unless he can generate another &#34;Word of Honor&#34; (or something even close), I'm done with DeMille.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|Great game with lots of options to customize it to your liking. Tons of games available to play through to keep you going
B002GY9F9K|5.0|This is one of my fave tv shows.  I love it and it was worth the pay. Quality is great.
B0076DELIG|5.0|If you've been following Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch character, this book will not disappoint!  Another great story with twists and turns.  Feels like you know the regular characters as friends.  Have read and will continue to read everything Michael Connelly produces, both Harry and Mickey Haller!!
B00B49L7Y4|4.0|Very well done.  The story was incredible.  They did their homework. Really enjoyed how he handled his new found fame.  Ended up buying his music.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|I am in love with this movie! The whole experience would have been so much better, if the stream didn't keep rebuffering.
B007L5GDGW|5.0|this game had the right amount of difficulty. the slowness of the turning of the marble made it difficult but not to difficult. I like how the further you progressed into the game the harder it became. for the people who say &quot;I tried it and the tilting was way too slow&quot; that's what makes the game fun and interesting. I haven't seen anything like it yet on the ipad and kindle or android. I hope more people like the game.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I found this book very helpful as I could find all the words I was looking for. The thing that is best about it is that you can find all the words that are American because lots of words are hard to figure out how to spell in American
B00A85EMVK|2.0|The two stars are not for the film itself. TOP GUN is a classic among classic military, guy films.  The two stars is for the vain attempt to create a 3D transfer of the film.  Granted, it is a great idea in concept...unfortunatley in execution it becomes clear that this is a \\"bridge to far.\\"  There is little to no visibly discernable 3D in the film (mainly the wide angle shots of the aircraft carrier).  The picture quality itself is pratically the same as the original.  The only true enhancement was to the sound.  Is that enough to shell the extra cash for a \\"3D\\" (note the use of quotes) combo pack?  No, its not.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I really enjoyed this book because it was easy to read and find words that I didn't understand. Sometimes when you don't understand a word you feel a little stupid and silly, so you don't want to ask  friend just in case they Laugh or make you feel worse. Now you can look up words wherever you are or one of your friends says something that you don't get. You don't want to be pulling out a dictionary and looking up a word. So this way in class you can pretend to read or something.
0307960471|5.0|A friend recommended me the author. It was a bit of a slow read for the first 50 pages or so but once I got into it I could not put the book down. Excellent detective story and more!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I was a steig Larson on fan from the first page of The girl with the Dragon tattoo.  The third book in the series was no disappointment.  I could no put it down.  My biggest regret is that the man who wrote this series is no longer with us.  Larson keeps all the balls in the air in glorious fashion and makes a very complicated and twisted plot easy to follow and a joy to read.
B002DCLQOW|5.0|Love this series. The Gilmore Girls Series has an amazing writer, I never fail to laugh at the dialog between the mother and daughter.
0525478817|5.0|I LOVE reading. I usually read a book once and than move on because there are so many more books to read.  The Fault in Our Stars in a<br />book I MUST read again.  It was well written, thought provoking and enjoyable from begining to end. I knew I would love it as soon as I<br />started to read.  It's kinda like when you first walk into that house you are going to buy or meet that special someone... you just know.
B0052U59F4|5.0|This can be criticized for its lack of literary merit but I don't read books because the experts say it is or is not well written. It was entertaining and led me to read all three in the series. Good book for guys to read to get a different perspective on relationships.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Great price and game been playing it for while now if your into item hunting and puzzles if anything try the trial version
B007IXWL2C|5.0|The relationship between Anna and Christian evolves in this book. The sex is clearly a big part of the book and the relationship but there are other aspects too. All around, the series was entertaining.
1594488886|5.0|I liked this book much more after I'd read it than while I was reading it. It's a powerful story, following the lives of two Afghani women during the second half of the 20th century. The characters are intensely real, and we walk alongside them as they navigate life and marriage, birth and death, under the violence of changing regimes - the Soviets, warlord anarchy, the Taliban, the U.S. invasion. It is a very difficult story, but one that ends in redemption and resilience.<br /><br />The thing that made this book more than usually difficult was the domestic violence it contained. In comparing it to other war-torn and difficult books that I've read (such as [[ASIN:1400095204 Half of a Yellow Sun]]), I realized the tremendous difference between human resilience in the face of suffering while still being in a context of human and family love, versus resilience to the turbulence of external circumstances while also living under abuse at home. This book contained some beautiful and powerful moments, but also some moments when I wasn't sure whether to read faster so that it would be over sooner or to put the book down and escape the horror of it all.
B004J1DBJI|4.0|I downloaded this for the calculator and that alone is worth the price of admission. The calculator will also parse instructions written in words. Additionally, the reference tool is wikipedia on steroids. The only downside I can see is that you need a data connection to use even the calculator.
B00005JM02|4.0|This item was sent in a timely manner in great condition. My 3 yr old can now enjoy this cute and classic Disney movie
0374214913|5.0|I truly enjoyed Robin Sloan's novel.  His writing is solid, and the plot was so clever and captivating, I didn't want to stop.  HIs asides to the reader were so intuitive and funny, I felt like he was speaking just to me.  I really liked the contrast of the old lovely book images with the slick shiny new technology images. And the Epilogue was SO SATISFYING!  I always want ti know more, and he gave it just the right touch.
1878424319|5.0|I have read this book so many times and I know I will read it again and again. I love this book and if everyone would try to live by this book, life would be much better.<br />I also buy extra's and give them out to people who I think would benefit from reading this wonderful book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|What a fantastic read! It has kept me up far too late many nights because I didn't want to put it down. Thank you Mr. Howey for this series which has been such a delight to read.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|This has to be one of the best series created. The only thing I don't, and this has to do with Amazon, it that I have to wait till the next day to purchase and watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a very good game and people should play it all the time it is so cool and fun
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It was really fun and enjoyable also hilarious. I never knew so much about Greek mythology before I read this series. I bet you will love it.

B004VMUS9G|5.0|Early impressions: After somewhat limited use, I found the functionality and reliability of this application to be quite good.  I'm actually surprised at the amount of functionality offered by this no-fee software.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Always been a fun game and they improved it so much in graphics and gameplay.  I always end up playing it again when I get bored with my other games and have fun.
081297381X|3.0|The wordy, arrogant, egotistical, demeaning style of writing diminished the effectiveness of his well conceived issues, many of them a matter of common sense.  I happen to have 37 years experience in oil and gas exploration, domestic and foreign and the  gambling stakes can run pretty high.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't wait to read this every night.  I felt I was one with the characters and had empathy for them.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have fallen back in love with John Grisham. His story telling remains superb. I purposely had to slow down my reading because I didn't want it to end too quick. John's books are not anti-climactic so I never worried that I wouldn't get what I needed. He did not disappoint.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Riviting from beginning to end. Realistic people, perhaps with a few extra demons.  An intriguing  murder with so much mystery surrounding it.  Twists and turns, ups and downs. You won't believe the ending.  My first book by Mr. Landay I hope he has more books out there, I will be looking.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Great story and an easy read!!! Makes you look at the human race and what could happen if we don't change and what our future can possibly hold!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I have learned a lot from the genius....that created this book of life...from sex to emotions to suspense to traumatic recovery and more...E L James is an amazing writer...

B00979CS50|5.0|So many long jams. Classic Young! The old rocker still has it. Masterfull!<br />If you are a fan, buy, buy, buy
B003KVKQB4|5.0|One may pretend that poverty and sellouts of national resources often leading to totalitarianism and oppression happen only &#34;elsewhere&#34;, but after reading this book one views the recent developments in Europe in completely different light - and not at all flattering at that. A must read for all who care about the present and the future in order to help avoid repeating the  past.

B007V2UGPE|5.0|its fun... not much else to say so I will say Only thing to make it better is to make coins more accessible
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I'd always been curious about this book and I'm glad I took a chance. Good mix of fantasy and general fiction. Worth a read.
B000NQRR1Q|4.0|I really enjoy this film, it is one of my favorites. Only rated four out of five stars because this particular DVD didn't contain any bonus features or even any option for subtitles for the hard of hearing, which I am.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Very similar to Mario Bros. Not too difficult. My 4 year old can enjoys the game as much as I do.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|This was a great movie to watch with our 3 year old on a family movie night. It was age appropriate, but we could still enjoy it as well
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very easy read. The writing style is vivid and explicit. Ready to read the next book in the series to see what Ana and Grey will be up to next.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Very addictive, once u get started its so hard to put back down, makes me late for work! Lol, gotta get this game!!!

B005VOXQFQ|4.0|The panda looks like it is shown on the left side, but the right side has white paint run up on his ear. The place he's eating on the bamboo has no color. I know this sounds like I'm picky but I want my tiny animals to seem real and he does not.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|This game would be great if it weren't for all the bugs. It randomly closes. Unless I leave the game open for at least ten minutes after playing, it won't save what I did.  More than half the time it is impossible to visit/help friends. Trying to connect to FB seems to make things worse, Gameloft does work better, but it still refuses to connect a lot. Lol Friendship IS magic! You can't get very far in this without friends! My friends tell me that everyday on theirs they get new clearable objects (rocks, bushes, etc.) and a new group of parasprites, that has never happened with me and makes a lot challenges way mores difficult than they should be. Other than those bugs, I really like this game! The mini-games are pretty fun :-P
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was such a good book and I would recommend it to anyone. It as sssoooo good and I can't wait for the next book!
B00AEJM6H2|3.0|I like this game but am still trying to figure out some of the moves.  Not real sure where I'm going with it.
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Not what I though it was going to be.  A realistic movie depicting addiction and how it affects the lives around him.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because you get to use all these different birds and people and I would love to be at Rome.
B007RI56NY|5.0|Every song from this album makes me smile when I hear it. Train does an amazing job tapping into your core with this one.
B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|Well I just watched Lord of the Rings the Hobbit version<br />It is not a bad movie, especially if you haven't seen the previous three.<br />There was nothing new, nothing to look for, to get interested in.<br />So wrong that this is a trilogy when it is such a small book<br />Still,.you just have to watch it if you are a fun of Tolkien
B003IHW0GE|5.0|This is a good book to read for any age reader. The struggles of the March family during a difficult time period makes the book interesting.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It is a very well crafted app the only improvement that I can think of is a voltage meter showing the input<br /> charge rate.
B00873GRU4|2.0|I felt very let down because I expected much more based on its very high (in hindsight, suspiciously high) ratings.  This book is an ok read, but is not a 5 star book.  There is a lot of astro-turfing going on here and this is sad because it destroys the credibility of the review system.<br /><br />On a positive note, I generally enjoyed Howey's writing style.  I thought it was fresh and engaging.  Unfortunately, I think this book very badly suffers from a lack of critical editing.  Big parts are simply repetitive, overly detailed and boring filler. A good editor may fix this, and I hope Howey's future works benefit from this attention.<br /><br />**SPOILER ALERTS** Another downside for me was that there were too many elements that destroyed suspension of disbelief.  No lifts (elevators) in silos that apparently takes days to walk down - really?  Why do they need such massive power hungry server farms when nothing seems to depend very much on them?  The diving scene was laughably implausible.  And the most critical plot element of all, the cleaning ritual, was entirely contrived - its utility was never explained.  I mean, failed cleaning = prepare for war...wtf?<br /><br />Like the writing itself, I think many of these broken or out of place plot elements would be cured by an experienced editor.  Someone who with fresh eyes can challenge the author to justify elements that his own eyes may have become blind to.  It is a pity that more Amazon reviewers don't do the same.<br /><br />I won't read any more of this trilogy.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|You would want to watch this movie only if are keen to know about the history of scientology! One of the worst movies I have watched
0449011909|4.0|The disks arrived in great condition, only one disk had some flaws but it was only a few minutes of poorly sounding audio.  Other than that, it's been great so far.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Much better than horse life adventures! My three and four year old absolutely  love it! Good gameplay and even better graphics!
B001BMKOZW|5.0|Scars first record just makes you want more. Brilliant work stop comparing them to SOAD they are not SOAD they are ScarsOn Broadway and they went past anything SOAD has done
0062068423|2.0|I keep wanting to give it another try but each time I have given up...this time for good.<br />It starts off promisingly but then starts jumping around in a very confusing manner. When I got to the WWII segment which drags on interminably I was so switched off I just couldn't be bothered to read the rest.  Definitely not in the same league as Henning Mankell.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Definitely much smaller than I had anticipated it to be, but it server its function and still have some left to use on a future project.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|It was a wonderful book.  The story line was so awesome.  I couldn't put it down...stayed up really late reading this one :)
B007HC3LHS|4.0|A suspenseful book,well written,keeps you wanting to read more. I am looking forward to more from this author who has just went on my top ten list!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I loved this book.  I couldn't put it down.  just wanted to keep reading...so sad when I was done with it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I read it until I finished it. It was full of suspense and love and everything you would love.  I highly recommend it.  Nicholas Sparks is a very talented writer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I absalutly love this game get it please get it is riley fun<br />When I first got it I though it wold be boring but now. I just cant stop playing it
B009JZTOG8|5.0|The season is still going so I cant give a full review but so far the show continues to keep me at the edge of my seat. The few truths of the Main Story-line I have been able to guess on my own provided me with only momentary solace as a dozen more questions replace the previous ones.<br />NO OTHER SHOW could air for a few episodes then be gone for weeks then return for 2 episodes then take another break and keep me coming back. Any other show Id of gotten fed up with, But Not Once. I not only tolerate the many breaks but I watch whole episodes focusing on characters I honestly don't care that much about because I Know it might provide a tiny piece of the puzzle and Characters I love.<br />Villains I Love to Hate and Hate to Love,<br />True Love tested in the Real World.<br />Princess who hold their own and kick-ass. The show is amazing, enchanting and magical.......
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I like the concept of the game But soon after starting the game(on level 2), it requires additional trips to the store. Cash out of pocket, or sign up for junk mail. So if you have buku bucks ans an empty email address, and like to share with friends, this game might work for you.
B005LAIHVI|3.0|Director Bryan Singer's long awaited fantasy adventure, \\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" is finally here, and it's better than I expected, but not that great either. I heard about \\"Jack the Giant Killer\\" early last year (2012), then nothing more. Now I know what happened. It was scheduled for release, June 15, 2012, but was delayed until now because of production problems. Many adjustments were made to the original films screenplay including title change. This film is very entertaining BUT, I'm disappointed in it because it lacks the magic, emotion, and scary (giant awe), I was hoping for in a well crafted and told giant story. Instead, I got to watch a poorly rendered CGI giant eat his boogers, another one fart, and the two-headed one belch and argue with himself continually. This could have been so much better. It reminded me of the CGI work done in the 1995 fantasy film, \\"Jumanji\\". Also; These giants are not respectable or scary giants in any way. They are all ugly, behave immature and are bumbling and stupid. They end up being flat with no presence, unengaging and mostly boring. I wanted to be thrilled by these giants. I was not.<br /><br />This films story started off promising enough. It begins with the re-telling of the \\"Jack and the Beanstalk\\" story told separately, to two small children (Jack and Princess Isabelle), then jumps forward ten years and their grow-up. The hero Jack (played by English actor Nicholas Hoult, recently seen in 2012 \\"Warm Bodies\\"), saves the heroine, Princess Isabelle (played by English actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who you may remember as the young Sophie in 2006 \\"The Illusionist\\"), from drunk bar ruffians, while she's out (incognito), mingling with her subjects at a bar. Isabelle is then safely whisked off (away from Jack), on horseback to her palace by her handsome and able Captain of the Guard, Elmont (preformed by talented Scottish actor Ewan McGregor, known for his recent staring role in Oscar nominated 2012 \\"The Impossible\\"). McGregor's character, Elmont seems to have more of a hero role in this story then Hoult's character Jack does. McGregor's acting is solid giving this film a serious feel. Isabelle's father, the king is played by English actor Ian McShane, who was made to wear armor in this film that is by far the worst looking armor I have ever seen in a movie, in my life. All the costumes in this film are hideous. So much so that it was distracting, throwing me out of the movie and back into the audience many times throughout this film. The enjoyable villain, Lord Roderick is preformed excellently by Stanley Tucci. He's great and did a wonderful job preforming his character.<br /><br />The action is great throughout this film. This is where this film really shines and the entertaining factor comes in. There is an exciting giants-against-the-humans war near the end that had me on the edge of my seat. I LOVED the beanstalk! All the scenes with the beanstalk in it are great!<br /><br />\\"Jack the Giant Slayer\\" is ultimately a fail for me mostly because I was confused by the screenplays inability to make up it's mind if it was a gross kids movie or a serious, well made adult adventure fantasy/action romance. Even with all of this films problems, I still enjoyed parts of it, and the ending is perfect...but I can't recommend it. Something went horribly wrong with this film during it's production, and it shows. The two-headed giant may be the cause. Too many cooks in the kitchen make a mess! In this films case...too many writers. It's too bad. It could have been great. If you do decide to see this entertaining mess...Enjoy!<br /><br />Release date: 1 March 2013<br />Running time: 114 minutes<br />Rated: PG-13 ~ for brief language, fantasy action and violence.<br />Fantasy/Adventure<br /><br />Grade C+aracter, Elmont seems to have more of a hero role in this story then Hoult's character Jack does. McGregor's acting is solid giving this film a serious feel. Isabelle's father, the king is played by English actor Ian McShane, who was made to wear armor in this film that is by far the worst looking armor I have ever seen in a movie, in my life.
